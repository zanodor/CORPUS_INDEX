Links
Sumerian shell money. (Okay, not exactly "links", but you get
the idea.)
Here are some links to internet programs that are very useful
for anyone studying Sumerology.
ePSD: The PennsylvaniaSumerian Dictionary
(http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html). This
program gives the cuneiform symbols and their definitions,
and provides access to tablets and translations. (Note: many
of the links to the tablets are broken. See below.)
ePSD2 (http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/epsd2/sux): This
the updated version of the original ePSD. It is a bit more
difficult to use, and
the cuneiform fonts are not as attractive or accessible.
However, it has functional links to
the tablets on the CDLI and it provides additional information
on the transliterations.
ETCSL: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
(http://etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/). The ETCSL provides
complete translations of Sumerian literary works. The ETCSL
and the ePSD are inter-linked. The ePSD gives the signs and



the words, the ETCSL gives the sentences and the stories.
The ETCSL also has a good introduction to the mechanics of
the Sumerian language (http://www
etcsl.orient.ox.ac.uk/edition2/language.php).
CDLI: The Cuneiform Digital Library Initiative
(http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/). The CDLI is the Big Kahuna in the
field of cuneiform studies. It's a massive effort to catalogue
all of the Sumerian tablets in the world.
BDTNS: The Data Base of Neo-Sumerian Texts
(http://bdts.filol.csic.es/). (BDTNS is the way the words
would be said in the "backwards" Sumerian way of writing
things (Base-Data Texts-Neo-Sumerian)).
The BDTNS provides access to tablets in museums all around
the world. Like the CDLI above, parts of the BDTNS are
restricted to members only, but most of it is readily available
to the general public.
Sumerian.org (http://sumerian.org/): A wealth of information
about Sumerian writing and culture, with many links to other
related websites.
All Mesopotamia (http://allmesopotamia.wordpress.com/):
As the name implies, this website is devoted to all
of Mesopotamian history and culture (Sumerian, Akkadian,
Babylonian, and Assyrian). Their Tumblr, Twitter, and
Facebook pages are a good source for news and
photographs.
TheSumerians
(https://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/
shared/docs/sumerians.pdf), by Samuel Noah Kramer. This is
the best online book (pdf) for a general introduction to
Sumerian history. Other books by Kramer are also available
online.



AManualofSumerianGrammarandTexts, by John L. Hayes.
An excellent book for learning the Sumerian language.
