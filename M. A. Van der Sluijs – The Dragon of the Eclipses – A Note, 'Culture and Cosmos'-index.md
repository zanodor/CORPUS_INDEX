The Dragon of the Eclipses—A Note
_____________________________________________________
Marinus Anthony van der Sluijs
Abstract. The astrological concept of the ‘dragon of the lunar nodes’, responsible for eclipses of the sun and the moon, may have derived from a combination of ideas prevailing in Late Antiquity with respect to the ourobóros or ‘tail-biting serpent’—that it constituted a ring of darkness, that it was bent around the sun and that it was positioned on the ecliptic band. Various Mithraic, astrological and alchemical images of celestial dragons appear to represent this aspect of the dragon.
The dragon of the eclipses as a development of ourobóros symbolism From the classical period onwards, astronomers have been able to understand the causes of solar and lunar eclipses in terms of the so-called lunar nodes, ‘the points at which the moon crosses the ecliptic, at the ascending node (anabibazon ...) from south to north and at the descending node (katabibazon ...) from north to south. Eclipses can take place only when the sun and moon are simultaneously at or near the same node (solar eclipses) or different nodes (lunar eclipses)’.1 Curiously,

Beck, Beck on Mithraism; Collected Works with New Essays (Hampshire: Ashgate, 2004) [hereafter Beck, Mithraism], p. 171. ‘Only when the moon is on (or very close to) the ecliptic at one of the nodes, and simultaneously the sun is at the same point on the ecliptic or else at the diametrically opposite point, does an eclipse take place. If the sun and moon are in conjunction at the same node the eclipse is solar (the moon interposes itself in line of sight between the earth and the sun). If the sun and moon are in opposition at different nodes the eclipse is lunar (the earth blocks the sunlight from reaching the moon)’, p. 161; cf. W.

Indian, Persian and Arabic astrologers customarily refer to the lunar nodes as the ‘head’ and ‘tail’ of a cosmic dragon, who is known as Gawzar in Arabic; the conventional Latin names are caput draconis for the head, at the ascending node, and cauda draconis for the tail, at the descending node. 2 Though this terminology has been abundantly documented, modern scholars have seldom speculated on the original motivation to connect the lunar nodes with dragon symbolism. It is here argued that the dragon of the eclipses is best understood as a theoretical development of a number of traits—prominent in Late Antiquity—in the symbolism of the ourobóros or tail-biting serpent.3 Particularly manifest in ancient Egyptian art and magic are the age-old notions that the ourobóros personifies darkness and that it encloses or devours the sun god.4 In the early centuries of the present era, these ideas survived especially within the context of Gnosticism. In an eschatological scene in the Coptic text Pistis Sophia (2nd or 3rd century CE), ‘the disc of the sun was a great dragon whose tail was in its

mouth’.5 While the ourobóros is here a manifestation of the sun god, its cosmic proportions and its links with darkness and the infernal region were preserved in an enunciation attributed to Jesus: ‘The outer darkness is a great dragon whose tail is in its mouth, and it is outside the whole world, and it surrounds the whole world’.6 In Late Antiquity, moreover, a tendency arose to describe the ourobóros as an expression of the ecliptic band, the circular ‘pathway’ within which the planets are seen to make their circuits. As the sun was deemed the chief planet, the ourobóros’ affinity with the ecliptic band generally amounted to a close association with the ‘year’.7 Virgil’s

Buchanan-Brown, (London: Penguin, 1996), p. 846, s. v. ‘serpent’. Beck’s argument that the zodiacal dragon represented the diurnal rotation of the heavens conflates the symbolism of the equator with that of the ecliptic, overlooking the ancient emphasis on the year rather than the day as the ourobóros’ responsibility (Mithraism, p. 163). Compare: ‘These ideas of cosmic serpents surrounding the universe were quite appropriate as symbols of the recurrence of the planetary revolutions, accurate in their several periods but incommensurable’, J.

commentator, Maurus Servius (4th century CE), referred the linkage of the ourobóros and the year back to the Egyptians: ‘For according to the Egyptians, the year was indicated before the invention of letters by the image of a dragon biting its own tail, because it returns in itself’.8 The late Egyptian scholar, Horapollo (5th century CE), added to this:
When they wish to depict the Universe, they draw a serpent devouring its own tail, marked with variegated scales. By the scales they suggest the stars in the heavens. ... And, as each year it sheds its skin, it [represents] old age. But as each season of the year returns successively, it grows young again.9

century CE), reduced the ourobóros to an emblem held in the right hand of the god Saturn and identified with the year: ‘In his right hand he held a fire-breathing dragon devouring its own tail—a dragon which was believed to teach the number of days in the year by the spelling of its own name’.10 Through Martianus’ work, the specific association of the ourobóros and the year with Saturn survived throughout the Middle Ages, with attestations in the works of the French theologian, Remigius of Auxerre († 908 CE),11 the anonymous Third Vatican Mythographer (12th century CE),12 and Albericus Philosophus of London (13th or 14th century CE).13 Bearing the above in mind, astrological terminology involving the ‘head’ and ‘tail’ of a celestial dragon makes most sense if this creature is conceived in a circular or at least a curved form, id est, as an adaptation of the ourobóros. Insofar as the eclipse of the sun or moon entails the ‘consumption’ of that luminary, a motif with a strong mythological resonance, the head of the eclipsing dragon would logically be located at the same node as the sun or moon. The placement of the tail-end would

Johnson (New York: Columbia University Press, 1977), p. 26. The Latin for ‘a fire-breathing dragon devouring its own tail’ is flammivomus draco caudae suae ultima devorans. ‘It is not clear what Martianus means by saying that the number of days in the year is signified in the spelling of the dragon’s name; the medieval commentators interpret this by claiming that the dragon’s name is Greek, Tex, the letters of which have a numerical value totalling 365—but there is no such Greek word or name’, pp. 26–27, note 97.

depend on the particular type of eclipse: in case of a solar eclipse, it would be situated at the same node, producing a fully circular ourobóros, whilst a lunar eclipse would require it to be at the opposite node, limiting the section of the ecliptic band occupied by the dragon to a semicircle.14 This interpretation ties in with the serpent’s rotatory movement around the cosmos, expressed through the theme of the head chasing the tail,15 as ‘The nodes are not fixed points on the ecliptic but move slowly westwards, and they are of course always diametrically opposite each other’.16 The ‘dragon of the lunar nodes’ thus moves within the zodiac ‘as a symbol of the progress of sun and moon, or of the sun alone, and hence of genesis and time’.17
The dragon of the eclipses in western esotericism
The dragon of the lunar nodes is a common fixture in medieval Arab and Hindū astronomy, yet its significance in the western esoteric tradition has perhaps been underestimated. With the theoretical prerequisites of the idea – the ourobóros as embodying darkness, encircling the sun and occupying a segment of the ecliptic band –firmly in place towards the end of the Imperial Age, the dragon of the eclipses could have been conceived as early as at this time. A stucco zodiac on the ceiling of the cult niche from the Mithra Temple on the island of Ponza in the Tyrrhenian Sea sports ‘a coiled snake ... that entwines both Bears on the

northern side and whose menacing head is turned towards the muzzle of the Little Bear’.18 The snake ‘occupies one half of the circle lying between the zodiac and the bears on the ceiling of the Ponza Mithraeum’ (See Figure 1).

from Leo to Capricorn was set well before the building of the Ponza Mithraeum ...’19 ‘The 180° extent of the dragon reflects, of course, the fact that the nodes occupy diametrically opposite points on the ecliptic’.20 Another Mithraic reflex of the ‘nodal’ dragon can be recognised in the circular snake crowning a blue marble pedestal found at the Flaminian Gate, Rome, and dedicated Inuicto Soli Mithrae, ‘to the Invincible Sun Mithras’ (See Figure 2).21 Because ‘the serpent’s head is crested and radiate, as is characteristic of solar creatures, and on the last section of the tail, just before the mouth, can be made out a sort of meniscus or figure of the moon’,22 it is reasonable to infer that the two luminaries on the head and the tail of the dragon—producing a solar eclipse in unison—establish the link of these extremities with the lunar nodes.
19 Beck, Mithraism, pp. 171–72, 152–57, refuting the assumption that this creature denoted the constellations of Draco, Hydra or Serpens. ‘The zodiac ... is so positioned that Leo and the head of the snake lie towards the west and are closest to the site of the tauroctony; Capricorn and the snake’s tail lie towards the east and the entrance to the Mithraeum ...’, p. 153. The ‘dragon of the lunar nodes’ thus moved within the zodiac ‘as a symbol of the progress of sun and moon, or of the sun alone, and hence of genesis and time’, p. 197.

A purportedly ‘Chaldaean’ variant—apparently complemented by a duplicate copy of itself to complete the circle—is featured in an astrological codex (12th century CE) asserting that the pneuma drakontoeidés, the ‘dragon-like soul’ of the cosmos, carries the name Athalía and possesses two heads and two tails, apparently with one pair

stretching from Libra to Taurus, the other from Scorpio to Aries, such that the two heads adjoin as well as the two tails.23 The name Athalía is authentic, as it corresponds to Akkadian attalû, with variants antalû, antallû, namtallû, and nantallû, which means ‘(lunar or solar) eclipse’.24 This word was borrowed into Aramaic as ’ātaljā and occurs in what is arguably the most detailed portrait of the ‘eclipse dragon’ found in the astrological literature—a refutation of the dragon’s existence furnished by the Syrian writer, Severus Sebokht, bishop of Qennešrê (±575–±666 CE), which is worth being cited in full:

The ‘two circles’ indicate the ecliptic and the lunar orbit, Beck, Mithraism, p. 161. A. Mastrocinque outrightly identified Athalía with the ourobóros, but did not explain how its semicircular shape relates to the circular form of the ourobóros. Nor did he produce evidence for his claim that the authors of these passages identified it with the constellation Draco. (A. Mastrocinque, From Jewish Magic to Gnosticism (Tübingen: Mohr Siebeck, 2005), p. 162).

... des hommes renommés dans cette science disent que les éclipses et la disparition des astres ont lieu à cause du Dragon (Ataliâ). Pour confirmer leurs paroles, ils dessinent une figure de ce genre, et ils disent que le dragon (Ataliâ) est un corps qui a une figure de dragon: souvent aussi ils l’appellent dragon et serpent. La largeur de son corps est de 24°, et le longueur est de 180 degrés, ce qui fait six signes du zodiaque ou la moitié de la sphère; on voit ainsi dès maintenant que sa tête et sa queue se font vis-à-vis et sont toujours diamétralement opposées. Ce dragon (Ataliâ) marche toujours dans deux signes du zodiaque, sa tête dans l’un et sa queue dans l’autre. Le milieu de son corps est en dehors de toute la couronne des signes du zodiaque, vers le nord, du côté du char, car il est courbé et a la forme d’un demi-cercle, comme un arc ... Son mouvement a lieu non comme celui des planètes, de l’Occident à l’Orient, mais comme celui des douze signes, de l’Orient à l’Occident. Il se déplace de 3 ́11ʺ en un jour et une nuit, de 1°33 ́ en un mois, et de 19°20 ́ en un an. Il fait donc une révolution complète en 18 ans, 7 mois et 16 jours. Parce que ce dragon (Ataliâ) est en dessous du soleil et de la lune, chaque fois que la lune est en conjonction avec le soleil dans le signe et le degré où se trouve la tête du Dragon (Ataliâ) ou sa queue, le Dragon (Ataliâ) se tient devant la lune et cache aussi le côté du soleil ...25
In addition, a 16th-century German manuscript discussing the Astéra melané or ‘black star’ responsible for eclipses features an illustration of this lunar dragon, coloured red, in which the head biting the tail is situated in the centre of the creature (Fig. 3).26
