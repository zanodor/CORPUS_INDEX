EDITOR’S PREEAGE.
It is my pleasant lot to introduce to the English reader another volume of
Professor Maspero’s important work. It is no longer the Dawn of Civiliza
tion in which we find ourselves, but the full light .of an advanced culture.
The nations of the ancient East are no longer each pursuing an isolated
existence, and separately developing the seeds of civilization and culture
on the hanks of the Euphrates and the Nile. Asia and Africa have met in
mortal combat. Babylonia has carried its empire to the frontiers of Egypt,
and Egypt itself has been held in bondage by the Hyksos strangers from
Asia. In return, Egypt has driven back the wave of invasion to the borders
of Mesopotamia, has substituted an empire of its own in Syria for that of
the Babylonians, and has forced the Babylonian king to treat with its Pharaoh
on equal terms. In the track of war and diplomacy have come trade and
commerce; Western Asia is covered with roads, along which the merchant
and the courier travel incessantly, and the whole civilised world of the Orient
is knit together in a common literary culture and common commercial
interests.
The age of isolation has thus been succeeded by an age of intercourse, partly
military and antagonistic, partly literary and peaceful. Professor Maspero
paints for us this age of intercourse, describes its rise and character, its decline
and fall. For the unity of Eastern civilization was again shattered. The
Hittites descended from the ranges of the Taurus upon the Egyptian province
of Northern Syria, and cut off the Semites of the west from those of the east.
The Israelites poured over the Jordan out of Edom and Moab, and took
possession of Canaan, while Babylonia itself, for so many centuries the ruling
power of the Oriental world, had to make way for its upstart rival Assyria.
The old imperial powers were exhausted and played out, and it needed time
before the new forces which were to take their place could acquire sufiicient
strength for their work.
As usual, Professor Maspero has been careful to embody in his history the

very latest diseoverios and iiddriuation. Notice, it will be fouml, has been
taken even of the dcJa of Meneptah, disinterred last spring by Professor
Petrie, on which the name of the Israelites is engraved. Other di.scoveries of
the past year whieh relate to the period covered by the Datvn of Givilizatioic
must wait to be noticed until a new edition of that volume is called for. Thus,
at Elephantine, I found last winter, on a granite boulder, an inscription of
Khufuankh — whose sarcophagus of red granite is one of the most beautiful
objects in the Gizeh Museum— which carries back the history of the island to
the age of the pyramid-builders of the fourth dynasty. The boulder was
subsequently concealed under the southern side of the city-wall, and as
fragments of inscribed papyrus coeval with the sixth dynasty have been
discovered in the immediate neighbourhood, on one of which mention is made
of “this domain” of Pepi II., it would seem that the town of Elephantine
must have been founded between the period of the fourth dynasty and that of
the sixth. Manetho is therefore justified in making the fifth and sixth
dynasties of Elephantine origin.
It is in Babylonia, however, that the most startling discoveries have been
made. At Tello, M. de Sarzec has found a library of more than thirty thousand
tablets, all neatly arranged, piled in order one on the other, and belonging to
the age of Gudea (b.c. 2700). Many more tablets of an early date have been
unearthed at Abu-Habba (Sippara) and Jokha (Isin) by Dr. Scheil, working
for the Turkish government. But the most important finds have been at
Niffer, the ancient Nippur, in Northern Babylonia, where the American ex
pedition has at last brought to a close its long work of systematic excavation.
Here Sir. Haynes has dug down to the very foundations of the great temple
of El-lil, and the chief historical results of his labours have been published
by Professor Hilprecht (in The Bahjlonian Expedition of the University of
Pennsylvania, vol. i. pt. 2, 1890).
About midway between the summit and the bottom of the mound,
Mr. Haynes laid bare a pavement constructed of huge bricks stamped with the
names of Sargon of Akkad and his son Naram-Sin. He found also the ancient
wall of the city, which had been built by Narara-Sin, 13'75 metres wide. The
debris of ruined buildings which lies below the pavement of Sargon is as much
as 9'25 metres in depth, while that above it, the topmost stratum of which
brings us down to the Christian era, is only 11 metres in height. We may
form some idea from this of the enormous age to which the history of
Babylonian culture and writing reaches back. In fact. Professor Hilprecht
quotes with approval Mr. Haynes’s words: “We must cease to apply the
adjective ‘ earliest ’ to the time of Sargon, or to any age or epoch within a



EDITOR'S PREFACE. V
thousand years of his advanced civilization.” “ The golden age of Babylonian
history seems to include the reign of Sargon and of Ur-Gur.”
Many of the inscriptions which belong to this remote age of human culture
have been published by Professor Hilprecht. Among them is a long inscription,
in 132 lines, engraved on multitudes of large stone vases presented to the
temple of Eblil by a certain Lugal-zaggisi. Lugal-zaggisi was the son of
Ukus, the patesi or high priest of the “ Land of the Bow,” as Mesopotamia,
with its Bedawin inhabitants, was called. He not only conquered Babylonia,
then known as Kengi, “ the land of canals and reeds,” but founded an empire
which extended from the Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean. This was
centuries before Sargon of Akkad followed in his footsteps. Erech became the
capital of Lugal-zaggisi’s empire, and doubtless received at this time its
Sumerian title of “ the city ” par excellence.
For a long while previously there had been war between Babylonia and
the “ Land of the Bow,” whose rulers seem to have established themselves in
the city of Kis. At one time we find the Babylonian prince En-sag(sag)-ana
capturing Kis and its king ; at another time it is a king of Kis who makes
offerings to the god of Nippur, in gratitude for his victories. To this period
belongs the famous “ Stela of the Vultures ” found at Tello, on which is depicted
the victory of E-dingh’-ana-gin, the King of Lagas (Tello), over the Semitic
hordes of the Land of the Bow. It may be noted that the recent discoveries
have shown how correct Professor Maspero has been in assigning the kings of
Lagas to a period earlier than that of Sargon of Akkad.
Professor Hilprecht would place E-dingir-ana-gin after Lugal-zaggisi, and
see in the Stela of the Vultures a monument of the revenge taken by the
Sumerian rulers of Lagas for the conquest of the country by the inhabitants of
the north. But it is equally possible that it marks the successful reaction of
Chaldsea against the power established by Lugal-zaggisi. However this may
be, the dynasty of Lagas (to which Professor Hilprecht has lately added a new
king, En-Kbegal) reigned in peace for some time, and belonged to the same
age as the first dynasty of Ur. This was founded by a certain Lugal-kigub
nidudu, whose inscriptions have been found at Niffer. The dynasty which
arose at Ur in later days (cir. B.c. 2700), under Ur-Gur and Dungi, which has
hitherto been known as “the first dynasty of Ur,” is thus dethroned from its
position, and becomes the second. The succeeding dynasty, which also made
Ur its capital, and whose kings, Ine-Sin, Pur-Sin IL, and Gimil-Sin, were the
'immediate predecessors of the first dynasty of Babylon (to which Khammurabi
belonged), must henceforth be termed the third.
Among the latest acquisitions from Tello are the seals of the patesi,



VI KI) 1 TOR S rniib'A UK.
1 Aigul-iisiinif^al, which liniilly reniovo nil doubt as to tlio identity of “ Sargaui,
king of the city,” with tlie famous iSai'gou of Akkad. 'J’he historical accuracy
of kSargon’s annals, moreover, have beeji fidly vindicated. Not only have the
American excavators fouiul the contemporary monuments of him and his son
Narain-Sin, but also tablets dated in the years of his campaigns against “ the
land of the Amorites.” In short, fSargon of Akkad, so lately spoken of as
“ a half-mythical ” personage, has now emerged into the full glare of authentic
history.
That the native chronologists had sutticieiit material for reconstructing
the past history of their country, is also now clear. The early Babylonian
contract-tablets are dated by events which officially distinguished the several
years of a king’s reign, and tablets have been discovered compiled at the close
of a reign which give year by year the events which thus characterised them.
One of these tablets, for example, from the excavations at Niffer, begins with
the words: (1) “The year when Pur-Sin (II.) becomes king. (2) The year
when Pur-Sin the king conquers Urbillum,” and ends with “the year when
Gimil-Sin becomes King of Ur, and conquers the land of Zabsali” in the
Lebanon.
Of special interest to the biblical student are the discoveries made by
Mr. Pinches among some of the Babylonian tablets which have recently been
acquired by the British Museum. Four of them relate to no less a personage
than Kudur-Laghghamar or Chedor-laomer, “ King of Elam,” as well as to
Eri-Aku or Arioch, King of Larsa, and his son Dur-makh-ilani ; to Tudghula or
Tid’al, the son of Gazza[ui], and to their war against Babylon in the time of
Khammu[rabi]. In one of the texts the question is asked, “ Who is the son of
a king’s daughter who has sat on the throne of royalty ? Uur-makh-ilani, the
son of Eri-Aku, the son of the lady Kur . . . has sat on the throne of royalty,”
Ifom which it may perhaps be inferred that Eri-Aku was the son of Kudur
Laghghamar’s daughter ; and in another we read, “ Who is Kudur-Laghghamar,
the doer of mischief? He has gathered together the Umman Manda, has
devastated the land of Bel (Babylonia), aud [has marched] at their side.” The
Umman Manda were the “Barbarian Hordes ” of the Kurdish mountains, on
the northern frontier of Elam, and the name corresponds with that of the
Goyyim or “nations” in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis. We here see
Kudur-Laghghamar acting as their suzerain lord. Unfortunately, all four
tablets are in a shockingly broken condition, and it is therefore difficult to
discover in them a continuous sense, or to determine their precise nature.
They have, however, just been supplemented by further discoveries made
by Dr. Scheil at Constantinople. Among the tablets preserved there, he has



EDITOR’S PREFACE. Vll
found letters from Kliammurabi to his vassal Sin-idinnam of Larsa, from which
we learn that Sin-idinnam had been dethroned by the Elamites Kudur-Mabug
and Eri-A.ku, and had fled for refuge to the court of Khammurabi at Babylon.
In the war which subsequently broke out between Khammurabi and Kudur
Laghghamar, the King of Elam (who, it would seem, exercised suzerainty over
Babylonia for seven years), Sin-idinnam gave material assistance to tlie
Babylonian monarch, and Khammurabi accordingly bestowed presents upon
him as a “recompense for his valour on the day of the overthrow of Kudur
Laghghamar.”
I must not conclude this Preface without referring to a fine scarab
found in the rubbish-mounds of the ancient city of Kom Ombos, in Upper
Egypt—which bears upon it the name of Sutkhu-Apopi. It shows us that the
author of the story of the Expulsion of the Hyksos, in calling the king
Ra-Apopi, merely, like an orthodox Egyptian, substituted the name of the god
of Heliopolis for that of the foreign deity. Equally interesting are the scarabs
brought to light by Professor Flinders Petrie, on which a liitherto unknown
Ya’aqob-hal or Jacob-el receives the titles of a Pharaoh.

TRANSLATOR’S PREFACE.
In presenting to the public Professor IMaspero’s latest volume, the “ Premieres
Melees des Peuples,” in its English form, I have little to add to the words
I prefixed to the first volume of the series. I have in the present, as in
the previous work, preserved Professor Maspero’s spelling of the Egyptian
proper names, inserting in the Index the forms in general use among
English Egyptologists. With legard to such Syrian 'personal and place
names as occur in the Bible, I have followed the spelling of the Revised
Version; though here, as in the Assyrian portion of the work, the forms
1‘epresented on the monuments, whether cuneiform texts, Tel el-Amarna
tablets, or Egyptian hieroglyphs, are also given.
While this translation was passing through the press, fresh discoveries
were made which have thrown further light upon a few points dealt with
in the text, and in these cases the Editor or Translator has ventured to add
such short notes as seemed needful. As an example of these, I may call
attention to the notes on p. 29, in which Professor Hommel’s unhesitating
identification of Khammurabi with the Amraphel of Genesis xiv. 1 is given,
and also the true reading of Rim-Sin as determined by Mr. Pinches.
I have not referred in the notes to Professor HommeTs letter in the
Academy of October 17th last, dealing with the word “ Arpachshad,” which
he considers to be an Egypticised form of the territorial name “ Ur Kasdim,”
or “Ur of the Chaldees.” This important elucidation of an ethnological
term occurring in Genesis x., in a passage ascribed by recent critics to
the time of the Exile, will doubtless receive the consideration it merits.

S OME countries seem destined from their
origin to become the battle-fields of the
contending nations which environ them. Into
such regions, and to their cost, neighbour
ing peoples come from century to century to
settle their quarrels and bring to an issue the
questions of supremacy which disturb their
little corner of the world. The nations around
are eager for the possession of a country thus
situated ; it is seized upon bit by bit, and in
the strife dismembered and trodden underfoot
at best the only course open to its inhabitants
is to join forces with one of its invaders, and
while helping the intruder to overcome the rest,
to secure for themselves a position of permanent
servitude. Should some unlooked-for chance relieve them from the presence
of their foreign lord, they will probably be quite incapable of profiting by the

respite which fortune puts in tlieir way, or of making any effectual attempt to
organize themselves in view of future attacks. They tend to become split up
into numerous rival communities, of which even the pettiest will aim at
autonomy, keeping up a perpetual frontier war for the sake of becoming
possessed of or of retaining a glorious sovereignty over a few acres of corn in
the plains, or some wooded ravines in the mountains. Year after year there
will be scenes of bloody conflict, in which petty armies will fight petty battles
on behalf of petty interests, but so fiercely, and with such furious animosity,
that the country will suffer from the strife as much as, or even more than,
from an invasion. There will be no truce to their struggles until they all fall
under the sway of a foreign master, and, except in the interval between two
conquests, they will have no national existence, their history being almost
entirely merged in that of other nations.
From remote antiquity Syria was in the condition just described, and thus
destined to become subject to foreign rule. Chaldaia, Egypt, Assyria, and
Persia presided in turn over its destinies, while Macedonia and the empires of
the West were only waiting their opportunity to lay hold of it. By its position
it formed a kind of meeting-place where most of the military nations of the
ancient world were bound sooner or later to come violently into collision.
Confined between the sea and the desert, Syria offers the only route of easy
access to an army marching northwards from Africa into Asia, and all
conquerors, whether attracted to Mesopotamia or to Egypt by the accumulated
riches on the banks of the Euphrates or the Nile, were obliged to pass through
it in order to reach the object of their cupidity. It might, perhaps, have
escaped this fatal consequence of its position, had the formation of the country
permitted its tribes to mass themselves together, and oppose a compact body
to the invading hosts ; but the range of mountains which forms its backbone
subdivides it into isolated districts, and by thus restricting each tribe to a
narrow existence maintained among them a mutual antagonism. The twin
chains, the Lebanon and the Anti-Lebanon, which divide the country down the
centre, are composed of the same kind of calcareous rocks and sandstone, while
the same sort of reddish clay has been deposited on their slopes by the glaciers
of the same geological period.^ Arid and bare on the northern side, they
send out towards the south featureless monotonous ridges, furrowed here and
" Drake remarked in the Lebanon several varieties of limestone (Bueton-Deake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. pp. 90, 91), which have been carefully catalogued by Blanche and Lartet (Duo de Ldynes, Voyage d’ exploration a la mer Morte, vol. iii. pp. 40, 41, 49-58). Above these strata, which belong to the Jurassic formation, come reddish sandstone, then beds of very hard yellowish limestone, and finally marl. The name Lebanon, in Assyrian Libnana, W'ould appear to signify “ the white mountain;” the Amorites called the Anti-Lebanon Saniru, Shenir, according to the Assyrian texts (Fk. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Parodies? p. 104) and the Hebrew books {Dent. iii. 9; 1 Ghron. V. 23).

there by short narrow valleys, hollowed out in places into basins or funnel
shaped ravines, which are widened year by year by the down-rush of torrents.
These ridges, as they proceed southwards, become clothed with verdure and offer
a more varied outline, the ravines being more thickly wooded, and the summits
less uniform in contoiir and colouring. Lebanon becomes white and ice-crowned
in winter, but none of its peaks rises to the altitude of perpetual snows : the
highest of them. Mount Timarun, reaches 10,52G feet, while only three others
exceed 9000.^ Anti-Lebanon is, speaking generally, 1000 or 1300 feet lower than
its neighbour : it becomes higher, however, towai’ds the south, where the triple
peak of Mount Hermon^ rises to a height of 9184 feet. The Orontes and the
Litany drain the intermediate space. The Orontes rising on the west side of the
Anti-Lebanon, near the ruins of Baalbek,^ rushes northwards in such a violent
manner, that the dwellers on its banks call it the rebel—Nahr el-Asi.^ About a
third of the way towards its mouth it enters a depression, which ancient dykes
help to transform into a lake ; it flows thence, almost parallel to the sea-coast, as
far as the 36th degree of latitude. There it meets the last spurs of the Amanos,
but, failing to cut its way through them, it turns abruptly to the west, and then to
the south, falling into the Mediterranean after having received an increase to its
volume from the waters of the Afrin.^ The Litany rises a short distance from the
Orontes ; it flows at first through a wide and fertile plain, which soon contracts,
however, and forces it into a channel between the spurs of the Lebanon and
the Galileean hills.® The water thence makes its way between two cliffs of
* Bokton-Drake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. p. 88, attributed to it an altitude of 9175 English feet others estimate it at 10,539 feet. The mountains which exceed 3000 metres are Dahr el-Kozib, 3046 metres ; Jebel-Miskiyah, 3080 metres ; and Jebel-Makhmal or Makmal, 3040 metres (Elisee Eeclus, Nouvelle G^ographie universelle, vol. ix. pp. 693, 694). As a matter of fact, these heights are not yet determined with the accuracy desirable. ^ It was sometimes called in the plural, Hermonim, the Hermons (Ps. xlii. 6). ® Pliny, Natural History, Bk. V. xviii. : “Amnis Orontes, natus inter Libanum et Antilibanum, juxta Heliopolin.” On the source of the Orontes, cf. Burton-Drake, Unexplored Syria, vol. i. pp. 58-66. * The Egyptians knew it in early times by the name of Aunrati, or Araunti (E. de Eouge, Le Poeme de Pen-ta-our, 1856, p. 8, whose opinion has since been adopted by all Egyptologists) ; it is mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions under the name of Arantti (Fr. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Parodies? p. 274). All are agreed in acknowledging that this name is not Semitic, and an Aryan origin is attributed to it, but without convincing proof ; according to Strabo (xvi. ii. § 7, p. 750), it was originally called Typhon, and was only styled Orontes after a certain Orontes had built the first bridge across it. The name of Axios which it sometimes bears appears to have been given to it by Greek colonists, in memory of a river in Macedonia (Sozomen, History, vii. 15). This is probably the origin of the modern name of Asi, and the meaning, rebellious river, which Arab tradition attaches to the latter term, probably comes from a popular etymology which likened Axios to Asi : the identification was all the easier since it justifies the epithet by the violence of its current (Pococke, Travels, French trans. 1777, vol. iii. pp. 414, 415). ^ The Afrin is the Aprie of cuneiform inscriptions, at first confounded with one of the two rivers of Damascus, the Baradah (Finzi, Eicerche per lo Studio dell’ Antichita Assira, p. 284), the exact position of which was discovered by H. Eawlinson (G. Eawlinson, The Five Monarchies, vol. ii. p. 89). ® The Litany was identified b}' Eeland {Paliestina ex monumentis veteribus illustrata, vol. i. pp. 290, 291) with the river of the Lion, aIovtos woTap.6s of Ptolemy (v. 15), commonly called Leontes Strabo, who mentions the river, gives it no name at all (xvi. ii. § 24, p. 758).

readily leap across it. Near Yakhmur some detached rocks appear to have been
arrested in their fall, and, leaning like flying buttresses against the mountain
face, constitute a natural bridge over the torrent.^ The basins of the two rivers
lie in one valley, extending eighty leagues in length, divided by an almost
imperceptible watershed into two beds of unequal slope. The central part of
the valley is given up to marshes. It is only towards the south that we find
cornfields, vineyards, plantations of mulberry and olive trees, spread out over
the plain, or disposed in terraces on the hillsides. Towards the north, the
alluvial deposits of the Orontes have gradually formed a black and fertile
soil, upon which grow luxuriant crops of cereals and other produce. Coele
Syria, after having generously nourished the Oriental empires which had
preyed upon her, became one of the granaries of the Eoman world, under the
capable rule of the Caesars.
Syria is surrounded on all sides by countries of varying aspect and soil.
That to the north, flanked by the Amanos, is a gloomy mountainous region,
with its greatest elevation on the seaboard : it slopes gradually towards the
interior, spreading out into chalky table-lands, dotted over with bare and
rounded hills, and seamed with tortuous valleys which open out to the
Euphrates, the Orontes, or the desert. Vast, slightly undulating plains succeed
the table-lands : the soil is dry and stony, the streams are few in number
a,nd contain but little water. The Sajur flows into the Euphrates,^ the Afrin
n,nd the Karasu when united yield their tribute to the Orontes,® while the
others for the most part pour their waters into enclosed basins. The Khalus
of the Greeks sluggishly pursues its course southward, and after reluctantly
leaving the gardens of Aleppo, finally loses itself on the borders of the desert
in a small salt lake full of islets : ^ about halfway between the Khalus and the
passage de Scylax, pp. 39, 40), and it is now acknowledged that the Lion Kiver and the Litany have nothing in common (Kiepeet, Handhuch der Alien Geographie, p. 159, n. 2). The Samaritan Chronicles published by Neubauer call it the Nahar Litah [Journal Asiatique, 1869, vol. ii. p. 442). The Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xs. 1. 8, pi. xxi. 1. 8, mentions a watercourse between Tyre and Sidon, called the Nazana, which can only be the Nahr Kasi'miye'h, that is to say, the lower stream of the Litany (Maspeeo, Notes sur diffdrents points de grammaire et d’histoire, § 13, in the Melanges d' Archeblogie Egyptienne et Assyrienne, vol. i. pp. 140, 141). * The gorges of the Litany are described by Vax den Velde, Beise dureh Syrien und Palastina, vol. i. p. 113; and the natural bridge at Yakhmur by Robinson, Later Biblioal Researches, pp. 421, 423. ® The Sajur is the Sagurra of the cuneiform texts (Fe. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies ? p. 183).
’For the Afrin, cf. p. 6 of this volume. The modern Karasu was called by the Assyrians Saluara, the River of Eels, and it preserved this name until the Arab period (Halevt, Recherches hibliques, § xii. p. 278 ; Sachad, Zur historischen Geographie von Nordsyrien, in the Sitzungsberichte of the Academy of Science at Berlin, vol. xxi. pp. 329-336).
^ The Assyrian monuments have not yet given us the native name of this river ; Xenophon [Anabasis, vol. 1, iv. 9) calls it Khalus, and says that it was full of large edible fish.

Euphrates a second salt lake receives the Nahr ed-Dahab, the “golden riverd”
The climate is mild, and the temperature tolerably uniform. The sea-breeze
which rises every afternoon tempers the summer heat : the cold in winter is
never piercing, except when the south wind blows which comes from the
mountains, and the snow rarely lies on the ground for more than twenty-four
hours. It seldom rains during the autumn and winter months, but frequent
showers fall in the early days of spring. Vegetation then awakes again, and
the soil lends itself to cultivation in the hollows of the valleys and on the
table-lands wherever irrigation is possible. The ancients dotted these now
all but desert spaces with wells and cisterns ; they intersected them with
canals, and covered them with farms and villages, with fortresses and populous
cities. Primeeval forests clothed the slopes of the Amanos, and pinewood from
this region was famous both at Babylon and in the towns of Lower Chaldsea.^
The plains produced barley and wheat in enormous quantities, the vine throve
there, the gardens teemed with flowers and fruit, and pistachio and olive trees
grew on every slope. The desert was always threatening to invade the plain,
and gained rapidly upon it whenever a prolonged war disturbed cultivation,
or when the negligence of the inhabitants slackened the work of defence
beyond the lakes and salt marshes it had obtained a secure hold. At the present
time the greater part of the country between the Orontes and the Euphrates
is nothing but a rocky table-land, ridged with low hills and dotted over with
some impoverished oases, excepting at the foot of Anti-Lebanon, where two
rivers, fed by innumerable streams, have served to create a garden of marvellous
beauty. The Barada, dashing from cascade to cascade, flows for some distance
through gorges before emerging on the plain : ^ scarcely has it reached level
ground than it widens out, divides, and forms around Damascus a miniature
delta, into which a thousand interlacing channels carry refreshment and
fertility. Below the town these streams rejoin the river, which, after having
flowed merrily along for a day’s journey, is swallowed up in a kind of elongated
chasm from whence it never again emerges. At the melting of the snows a
regular lake is formed here, whose blue waters are surrounded by wide grassy
margins “ like a sapphire set in emeralds.” This lake dries up almost
completely in summer, and is converted into swampy meadows, filled with
gigantic rushes, among which the birds build their nests, and multiply as
unmolested as in the marshes of Chaldma. The Awaj, unfed by any tributary,
' The ancient native name of the Nahr ed-Dahab, like that of the Khalus, is unknown. ^ On the transport of timber from the Amanos, and on the ancient use of it in the small states of Chaldiea, cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 614. ® The Barada is the Abana or Amana, mentioned in the Hebrew books as one of the rivers which watered the country round Damascus (2 Kings v. 12), the Bardines or Chrysorrhoas of the Greeks.

fills a second deeper though smaller basin/ while to the south two other
lesser depressions receive the waters of the Anti-Lebanon and the Hauran.
Syria is protected from the encroachments of the desert by a continuous
barrier of pools and beds of reeds : towards the east the space reclaimed
resembles a verdant promontory thrust boldly out into an ocean of sand.
The extent of the cultivated area is limited on the west by the narrow
strip of rock and clay which forms the littoral. From the mouth of
the Litany to that of the Orontes, the coast presents a rugged, precipitous,
and inhospitable appearance. There are no ports, and merely a few ill
protected harbours, or narrow beaches lying under formidable headlands. One
river, the Nahr el-Kebir,^ which elsewhere would not attract the traveller’^
attention, is here noticeable as being the only stream whose waters flow
constantly and with tolerable regularity ; the others, the Leon,^ the Adonis,'*'
and the Nahr el-Kelb,® can scarcely even be called torrents, being precipitated
as it were in one leap from the Lebanon to the Mediterranean. Olives, vines,,
and corn cover the maritime plain, while in ancient times the heights were
clothed with impenetrable forests of oak, pine, larch, cypress, spruce, and
cedar. The mountain range drops in altitude towards the centre of the country
and becomes merely a line of low hills, connecting Gebel Ansarieh with the
Lebanon proper ; beyond the latter it continues without interruption, till at
length, above the narrow Phoenician coast road, it rises in the form of an
almost insurmountable wall.
Near to the termination of Coele-Syria, but separated from it by a range
of hills, there opens out on the western slopes of Hermon a valley unlike any
other in the world. At this point the surface of the earth has been rent in pre
historic times by volcanic action, leaving a chasm which has never since closed
up. A river, unique in character—the Jordan-— flows down this gigantic
* The modern Awaj is identified with the Pharpar of the Hebrew text (2 Kings v. 12). ^ The Nahr el-Kebir is the Eleutheros of classical geographers (Stkabo, xvi. ii., § 12, 15, pp.
754, 755 ; Pliny, Natural History, iv. 17), its Phcenician name has not yet been discovered ; it was perhaps called Shabtuna or Shabtun, from whence the river-name Sabbaticus might be derived. ^ The Leon of Ptolemy (v. 15) is perhaps the river which the majority of Roman geographers call Tamyras (Steabo, xvi. ii., § 22, p. 756), or Damuras (Polybius, v. 68, 69), the present NahrDamnr (Poulain de Bossay, Essais de restitution et d’ interpretation d’un passage de Scylax, pp. 39, 40).
* The Adonis of classical authors is now Nahr-Ibrahim. We have as yet no direct evidence as to the Phoenician name of this river ; it was probably identical with that of the divinity worshipped on its hanks. The fact of a river bearing the name of a god is not surprising ; the Belos, in theneighbourhood of Acre, affords us a parallel case to the Adonis (Renan, Mission de PMniciey p. 283). ® The present Nahr el-Kelb is the Lykos of classical authors. The Due de Luynes (Voyage d’exploration a la mer Morte, vol. i. p. 9, n. 1) thought he recognized a corruption of the Phoenician name in that of Alcobile, which is mentioned hereabouts in the Itinerary of the pilgrim of Bordeaux. The order of the Itinerary does not favour this identification, and Alcobile is probably Jebail (M. dbt Vogue, Melanges d'Aroh. Orientale, pp. 16, 17) : it is none the less probable that the original name of the Nahr el Kelb contained from earliest times the Phoenician equivalent of the Arab word leelb, “ dog.”"

Jud., V. iii. 1 ; VIII. viii. 4) as being that of the Little Jordan, eAdcraovos ’lopSdyov, tov pnKpov ’lopSduov. * The ancient geographers do not appear to have considered the Nahr el-Hasbany as a source of the Jordan. This is proved by the passage where S. Jerome (Comm, in Mathxum, xvi. 3), after his own fashion, gives the etymology of the name : “ Jordanes oritur ad radices Libanis, et habet duos fontes, unum nomine Jor et alterum Daw ; qui simul mixti Jordanis nomen efiSciunt.” The two sources which he indicates being those of Banias and Tell el-Qadi, the Nahr el-Hasbany is thus excluded. ^ For the source of the Jordan at Banias, cf. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XV. x. 3; and Jewish TFar, I. xxi. 3 : III. xv. 7 ; for the difference between the ancient and present condition of the place, see Guerin, Galilee, vol. ii. pp. 312-314. ® Lake Huleh is called the Waters of Merom, Me-Merom, in the Book of Joshua, xi. 5, 7; and Lake Sammoehonitis in JosEimus, Antiquities of the Jeivs, V. v. 1 ; cf. Jewish War, III. x. 7 ; IV. i. 1. The name of Ulatha, which was given to the surrounding country (Josephus, Jewish War, XV. x. 3), shows that the modern word Huleh is derived from an ancient form, of which unfortunately the original has not come down to us (Neubauer, La Geographic du Talmud, p. 17).

the Mediterranean, but instead of maintaining it, the river makes a sudden
drop on leaving the lake, cutting for itself a deeply grooved channel. It has
a fall of some 300 feet before reaching the Lake of Genesareth,^ where it is
only momentarily arrested, as if to gather fresh strength for its headlong
career southwards. Here and there it makes furious assaults on its right and
left banks, as if to escape from its bed, but the rocky escarpments which
hem it in present an insurmountable barrier to it ; from rapid to rapid it
descends with such capricious windings that it covers a course of more
than 62 miles before reaching the Dead Sea, nearly 1300 feet below the
level of the Mediterranean.^ Nothing could offer more striking contrasts than
the country on either bank. On the east, the ground rises abruptly to a
height of about 3000 feet, resembling a natural rampart flanked with towers
and bastions : behind this extends an immense table-land, slightly undulating
and intersected in all directions by the affluents of the Jordan and the Dead

forms a little world in itself, whose inhabitants, half shepherds, half bandits,
live a life of isolatiou, with no ambition to take part in general history. West
of the Jordan, a confused mass of hills rises into sight, their sparsely covered
slopes affording an impoverished soil for the cultivation of corn, vines, and
olives. One ridge—Mount Carmel—detached from the principal chain near the
southern end of the Lake of Grenesareth, runs obliquely to the north-west, and
finally projects into the sea. North of this range extends Galilee, abounding
in refreshing streams and fertile fields ; while to the south, the country falls
naturally into three parallel zones—the littoral, composed alternately of dunes

Ashdod, and Ascalon—are surrounded by flourishing orchards and gardens.
The plain yields plentiful harvests every year, the ground needing no manure and
very little labour. The higher ground and the hill-tops are sometimes covered
with verdure, but as they advance southwards, they become denuded and
burnt by the sun. The valleys, too, are watered only by springs, which are
dried up for the most part during the summer, and the soil, parched by the
continuous heat, can scarcely be distinguished from the desert. In fact, till
the Sinaitic Peninsula and the frontiers of Egypt are reached, the eye merely
encounters desolate and almost uninhabited solitudes, devastated by winter
torrents, and overshadowed by the volcanic summits of Mount Seir. The
spring rains, however, cause an early crop of vegetation to spring up, which
for a few weeks furnishes the flocks of the nomad tribes with food.
We may summarise the physical characteristics of Syria by saying that
Nature has divided the country into five or six regions of unequal area, isolated
by rivers and mountains, each one of which, however, is admirably suited to
become the seat of a separate independent state. In the north, we have the
country of the two rivers—the Naharaim—extending from the Orontes to the
Euphrates and the Balikh, or even as far as the Khabur.; ^ in the centre, between
the two ranges of the Lebanon, lie Ccele-Syria and its two unequal neigh
bours, Aram of Damascus and Phoenicia ; while to the south is the varied
collection of provinces bordering the valley of the Jordan. It is impossible
at the present day to assert, with any approach to accuracy, what peoples
inhabited these different regions towards the fourth millennium before
our era. Wherever excavations are made, relics are brought to light of
a very ancient semi-civilization, in which we find stone weapons and imple
ments, besides pottery, often elegant in contour, but for the most part coarse
in texture and execution. These remains, however, are not accompanied by
any monument of definite characteristics, and they yield no information with
regard to the origin or affinities of the tribes who fashioned them.^ The study
‘ The Naharaim of the Egyptians (cf. for the pronunciation, Maspeeo, A travers la vocalisation ggijptienne, in the Becueil des Travaux, vol. xv. pp. 189-192) was first identified with Mesopotamia (Brxjgsch, Geographisclie Inschriften, vol. ii. p. 30) ; it was located between the Orontes and the Balikh or the Euphrates by Maspero (De Carchemis oppidi situ et Historid antiquissimd, map No. 2). This opinion is now adopted by the majority of Egyptologists, with slight differences in detail (W. Max Mhllee, Asien und Europa nach altdgyptischen Denkmdlern, p. 219, et seq.). Ed. Meyer (Geschichte JEgyptens, p. 227) has accurately compared the Egyptian Naharaim with the Parapotamia of the administration of the Seleucid® (Polyb., v. 69 ; Sieabo, xvi. ii., § 11, p. 753). - Kesearches with regard to the primitive inhabitants of Syria and their remains have not as yet been prosecuted to any extent. The caves noticed by Hedenborg at Ant-Elias, near Tripoli, and by Botta atNahr el-Kelb (Observations sur leLiban et I’Antiliban in the Mdinoires de la Socidld g^ologique de France, 1st series, vol. i. p. 135), and at Adluu by the Due de Luynes, have been successively explored by Lartet (Due de Luynes, Voyage d’exploration a la mer Morte, vol. i. p. 23; vol. iii. pp. 213-210), Tristram, Lortet, and Dawson (Notes on prehistoric Man in Egypt and the Lebanon, in the Transactions of the Victoria Institute, vol. xviii. pp. 287-301).

of the geographical nomenclature in use about the VF'^ century B.c. reveals
the existence, at all events at that period, of several peoples and several
languages. The mountains, rivers, towns, and fortresses in Palestine and Ccele
Syria are designated by words of Semitic origin : it is easy to detect, even
in the hieroglyphic disguise which they bear on the Egyptian geographical
lists, names familiar to us in Hebrew or Assyrian.^ But once across the
Orontes, other forms present themselves which reveal no affinities to
these languages, but are apparently connected with one or other of the
dialects of Asia Minor.^ The tenacity with which the place-names, once given,
cling to the soil, leads us to believe that a certain number at least of those
we know in Syria were in use there long before they were noted down by the
Egyptians, and that they must have been heirlooms from very early peoples.
As they take a Semitic or non-Semitic form according to their geographical
position, we may conclude that the centre and south were colonized by Semites,
and the north by the immigrant tribes from beyond the Taurus. Facts are not
wanting to support this conclusion, and they prove that it is not so entirely
arbitrary as we might be inclined to believe. The Asiatic visitors who, under
a king of the dynasty, came to offer gifts to Khnumhotpu, the Lord of
Beni-Hasan,^ are completely Semitic in type, and closely resemble the Bedouins
of the present day. Their chief—Abisha— bears a Semitic name,^ as too does
the Sheikh Ammianshi, with whom Sinuhit took refuge.® Ammianshi himself
Bethzur, at Gilgal near Jericho, and at Tibneh, have been the subject of keen controversy ever since their discovery (Laetet, in the Bulletin de la Societe de G^ologie, 2nd series, vol. xxii. p. 527 ; in the Mat^riaux pour servir a I’histoire de I’homme, 1st series, 1869, vol. v. p. 237 ; cf.

The Abbe Eichard desired to identify the flints of Gilgal and Tibneh with the stone knives used by Joshua for the circumcision of the Israelites after the passage of the Jordan (Josh. v. 2-9), some of which might have been buried in that hero’s tomb (Eichaed, D^eouvertes d’instruments de pierre en Egypte, au Sinai et dans le Tombeau de Josuf, in the Comptes rendus de VAcaddmie des Sciences, 1871, vol. Ixxii. p. 540). * On the question of the transcription of Syrian geographical names into the hieroglyphs, see Beugsch, Geogr. Ins., vol. i. pp. 5-15 ; E. de Eouge, Mgmoire sur I’origine dgyptienne de
Valphabet phdnicien; and lastly, W. Max Muller, Asfen und Europa nach alldgyptischen Denhmdlern, pp. 58-109. ^ The non-Semitic origin of the names of a number of towns in Northern Syria preserved in the Egyptian lists, is admitted by the majority of scholars who have studied the question (Lenoemant, Les Origines de I’Histoire, vol. iii. p. 319, et seq. ; Max MUiajeu, Asien und Europa nach altdgyptischen Denhmdlern, pp. 286-292 ; cf. for the question of Semitic origin, Halevy, Recherches bibliques, § 12, pp. 270-288). ® See the representation of the whole scene in the Dawn of Civilization, pp. 468, 469. ^ His name has been shown to be cognate with the Hebrew Abishai (1 Sam. xxvi. 6-9 ; 2 Sam. ii. 18, 24 : xxi. 17) and with the Chaldseo-Assyrian Abeshukh (cf. the list of Babylonian kings on p. 27 of the present volume). * The name Ammianshi at once recalls those of Ammisatana, Ammizadugga, and perhaps Ammuxabi, or Khammurabi, of one of the Babylonian dynasties ; it contains, with the element Ammi, a final anshi (Maspebo, Notes sur quelques points de grammaire et d’histoire, § T, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. p. 76 ; cf. Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 63, 64, 206). Chabas connects it with two Hebrew words Am-nesh, which he does not translate (Etudes sur I’antiquitd historique, 2ud edit., pp. 105, 106).

reigned over the province of Kadima, a word which in Semitic denotes the
Eastd Finally, the only one of their gods known to us, Hadad, was a Semite
deity, who presided over the atmosphere, and whom we find later on ruling
over the destinies of Damascus.^ Peoples of Semitic speech and religion must,
indeed, have already occupied the greater part of that region on the shores of
the Mediterranean which we
find still in their possession
many centuries later, at
the time of the Egyptian
conquest.^
For a time Egypt pre
ferred not to meddle in their
affairs. When, however,
the “lords of the sands”
grew too insolent, the Pha
raoh sent a column of light
troops against them, and in
flicted on them such a severe
punishment, that the remembrance of it kept them within bounds for years.
Offenders banished from Egypt sought refuge with the turbulent kinglets,
who were in a perpetual state of unrest between Sinai and the Dead Sea.
Egyptian sailors used to set out to traffic along the seaboard, taking to
piracy when hard pressed ; Egyptian merchants were accustomed to penetrate
by easy stages into the interior.® The accounts they gave of their journeys
were not reassuring. The traveller had first to face the solitudes which
confronted him before reaching the Isthmus, and then to avoid as best
he might the attacks of the pillaging tribes who inhabited it. Should he
escape these initial perils, the Amu — an agricultural and settled people
inhabiting the fertile region—would give the stranger but a sorry recep
tion : he would have to submit to their demands, and the most exorbitant

A seal affixed to contracts of the time of Khammurahi belonged to a “servant of the god of lUartu,” who is none other than the god usually known as Eamman (cf. Dawn of Civilization, pp. 658-663). This fact was elucidated by Hommel {Gesehiclite Bahyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 349, 412). Schrader (Die Namen Hadad, Hadadezer, in the Zeitschrift fiir Keilforschung, vol. ii. pp. 366384) and Oppert (Adad, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. viii. pp. 310-314) have 23roved that the god Eamman was also called Hadad. “ Chabas (Etude sur Vantiquite' historique, d’apres les sources dgyptiennes et les monuments reputes pr^historiques, 2nd edit., p. 99, et seq.) had already arrived at the same conclusions, which are also those of W.

TEE ABSENCE OF EGYPTIAN INFLUENCE IN STRIA. 17
levies of toll did not always preserve caravans from their attacks.^ The
country seems to have been but thinly populated ; tracts now denuded were
then covered by large forests in which herds of elephants still roamed,^ and
wild beasts, including lions and leopards, rendered the route through them
dangerous.® The notion that Syria was a sort of preserve for both big and
small game was so strongly
implanted in the minds of
the Egyptians, that their
popular literature was full
of it : the hero of their
romances betook himself
there for the chase, as a
prelude to meeting with
the princess whom he was
destined to marry,® or, as in
the case of Kazarati, chief
of Assur, that he might
encounter there a monstrous
hyena with which to en
gage in combat.’ These
merchants’ adventures and explorations, as they were not followed by any mili
tary expedition, left absolutely no mark on the industries or manners of the
primitive natives : those of them only who were close to the frontiers of
Egypt came under her subtle charm and felt the power of her attraction, but
this slight influence never penetrated beyond the provinces lying nearest to the
Dead Sea. The remaining populations looked rather to Chaldsea, and received,
though at a distance, the continuous impress of the kingdoms of the Euphrates.

subjection of the people of the Amanos and the Orontes, probably contains but

a slight element of truth ; ^ but if, while awaiting further information, we hesitate
to believe that the armies of these princes ever crossed the Lebanon or landed
in Cyprus, we must yet admit the very early advent of their civilization in
those western countries which are regarded as having been under their rule.
More than three thousand years before our era, the Asiatics w’ho figure on the
tomb of Klinumhotpii clothed themselves according to the fashions of Uru
and Lagash, and affected long robes of striped and spotted stuffs.^ We may
well ask if they had also borrowed the cuneiform syllabary for the purposes of
their official correspondence,^ and if the professional scribe with his stylus and
clay tablet was to be found in their cities. The Babylonian courtiers were, no
doubt, more familiar visitors among them than the Memphite nobles, while the
Babylonian kings sent regularly to Syria for statuary stone, precious metals,
and the timber required in the building of their monuments : ^ Urban and
Gudea, as well as their successors and contemporaries, received large convoys
of materials from the Amanos, and if the forests of Lebanon were more rarely
utilised, it was not because their existence was unknown, but because distance
rendered their approach more difficult and transport more costly. The
Mediterranean marches were, in their language, classed as a whole under one
denomination—Martu, Amurru,^ the West—but there were distinctive names
for each of the provinces into which they were divided. Probably even at that
date they called the north Kfiati,*^ and Coele-Syria, Amurru, the land of the
’ Cf. what is said on the subject of these conquests in Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 598-600. ^ Cf. Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, for the Asiatics received by the Prince of Beni-Hasan, pp. 468, 469; for the resemblance of their costume to that of the Chaldseans, cf. ibid.jp. 719, note 4. “ The most ancient cuneiform tablets of Syrian origin are not older than the XI V*'' century before our era ; they contain the official correspondence of the native princes with the Pharaohs Amenothes III. aiid IV. of the XVIIP'' dynasty, as will be seen later on in this volume ; they were discovered in the ruins of one of the palaces at Tel el-Amarna in Egypt. ' This communication with Syria has been pointed out by Maspero in the Dawn of Civilization, pp. 610, 614. It has been carefully described by Hosimel, Geschichte, Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 325-330. ® Formerly read Akharru. For a general notice of these names, see Fr. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Parodies ? pp. 271-273 ; and Schrader, Die Keilinscliriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd edit., pp. 90-92. Martu would be the Sumerian and Akharru the Semitic form, Akharru meaning that which is behind. The discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets threw doubt on the reading of the name Akharru : some thought that it ought to be kept in any case (Halevy, Notes g^ographiques, § 34, in the Revue S^mitique, vol. i. p. 185); others, with more or less certainty, think that it should be replaced by Amuru, Amurru, the country of the Amorites (Delattre, Azirou, in the Proceedings of the Biblical Archeeol. Soe., 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp. 233, 234 ; cf. Morris Jastrow, On Palestine and Assyria in the Days of Joshua, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. ii. p. 2, note 1; Bezold-Budge, 'Z’Ae Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, p. xviii., note 2). But the question has now been settled by Babylonian contract and law tablets of the period of Khammurabi, in which the name is written A-mu-ur-ri {-hi). Hommel originated the idea that Martu might be an abbreviation of Amartu, that is, Amar with the feminine termination of nouns in the Canaanitish dialect ; Martu would thus actually signify the country of the Amorites (Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 270; cf. Assyriological Notes, § 5, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1893-94, vol. xvi. p. 212). ® The name of the Khati, Khatti, is found in the Booh of Omens (Hommel, Die Semitischen Volher und Sprache, p. 176, et seq.), which is supposed to contain an extract from the annals of Sargon and

Amorites. The scattered references in their writings seem to indicate frequent
intercourse with these countries, and that, too, as a matter of course which excited
no surprise among their contemporaries : a journey from Lagash to the moun
tains of Tidanum and to Gubin, or to the Lebanon and beyond it to Byblos,^
meant to them no voyage of discovery. Armies undoubtedly followed the
routes already frequented by caravans and flotillas of trading boats, and
the time came when kings desired to rule as sovereigns over nations with
whom their subjects had peaceably traded. It does not appear, however,
that the ancient rulers of Lagash ever extended their dominion so far.
The governors of the northern cities, on the other hand, showed themselves
more energetic, and inaugurated that march westwards which sooner or later
brought the peoples of the Euphrates into collision with the dwellers on the
Nile: for the first Babylonian empire without doubt comprised part if not
the whole of Syria.^
Among the most celebrated names in ancient history, that of Babylon
is perhaps the only one which still suggests to our minds a sense of vague
magnificence and undefined dominion. Cities in other parts of the world,
it is true, have rivalled Babylon in magnificence and power: Egypt could
boast of more than one such city, and their ruins to this day present to our
gaze more monuments worthy of admiration than Babylon ever contained in
the days of her greatest prosperity. The pyramids of Memphis and the
colossal statues of Thebes still stand erect, while the ziggurats and the
palaces of Chaldsea are but mounds of clay crumbling into the plain : but
the Egyptian monuments are visible and tangible objects; we can calculate to
within a few inches the area they cover and the elevation of their summits,
and the very precision with which we can gauge their enormous size tends
to limit and lessen their effect upon us. How is it possible to give free rein
Naramsin (cf. Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, p. 599) ; as, however, the text which we possess of it is merely a copy of the time of Assurbanipal, it is possible that the word Khati is merely the translation of a more ancient term, perhaps Martu (Fn. Lesoemant, Les Origines de Vhistoire, vol. iii. pp. 336, 337; Hommel, Geschichte Bdbyloniens und Assyriens, p. 271, note 6). Winckler (dZfonewtalische Forschungen, p. 142, note 1) thinks it to be included in Lesser Armenia and the Melitene •of classical authors. ’ Gubin is probably the Kuphna, Khpna, of the Egyptians, the Byblos of Phcenicia (Hommel, Geschichte Bahyloniem und Assyriens, p. 229). Amiaud QSirpourla, pp. 11-13) had proposed a most unlikely identification with Koptos in Egypt. In the time of Ine-Sin, King of Ur, mention is found of Siinurru, Zimyra (Hommel, Aus der Bahylonisehen Altertumslcunde, in Die Aula, 1895, vol. i. p. 550). “ It is only since the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets that the fact of the dominant influence of Chaldsea over Syria and of its conquest has been definitely realized. It is now clear that the state of things of which the tablets discovered in Egypt give us a picture, could only be explained by the hypothesis of a Babylonish supremacy of long duration over the peoples situated between the Euphrates and the Mediterranean (M. Jastrow, On Palestine and Assyria in the Days of Joshua, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. vii. pp. 1-7 ; Winckler, Bahyloniens Herrschaft in Mesopotamien und seine Eroberungen in Paldstina im zweiten Jahrtausend, in the Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 140-158, 224-226; and Geschichte Israels, vol. i. pp. 126-132; S ay ce, Patriarchal Palestine, p. 55, et seq.).

to the imagination when the subject of it is strictly limited by exact and
determined measurements ? At Babylon, on the contrary, there is nothing
remaining to check the flight of fancy : a single hillock, scoured by the
rains of centuries, marks the spot where the temple of Bel stood erect in its
splendour ; another represents the hanging gardens, while the ridges running to
the right and left were once the ramparts. The vestiges of a few buildings
remain above the mounds of rubble, and as soon as the pickaxe is applied
to any spot, irregular layers of bricks, enamelled tiles, and inscribed tablets
are brought to light—in fine, all those numberless objects which bear witness
to the presence of man and to his long sojourn on the spot. But these vestiges
are so mutilated and disfigured that the principal outlines of the buildings
cannot be determined with any certainty, and afford us no data for guessing
their dimensions. He who would attempt to restore the ancient appearance
of the place would find at his disposal nothing but vague indications, from
which he might draw almost any conclusion he pleased. Palaces and temples
would take a shape in his imagination on a plan which never entered the
architect’s mind ; the sacred towers as they rose would be disposed in more
numerous stages than they actually possessed ; the enclosing walls would
reach such an elevation that they must have quickly fallen under their
own weight if they had ever been carried so high : ^ the whole restoration,.

of the people were closely built around these stately piles, on either side of
narrow lanes. A massive wall surrounded the whole, shutting out the view on
all sides ; it even ran along the bank of the Euphrates, for fear of a surprise
from that quarter, and excluded the inhabitants from the sight of their own
river.^ On the right bank rose a suburb, which was promptly fortified and
enlarged, so as to become a second Babylon, almost equalling the first in extent
and population. Beyond this, on the outskirts, extended gardens and fields,
finding at length their limit at the territorial boundaries of two other towns,

results, until the day came when some more energetic or fortunate dynasty at
length crushed its rivals, and united under one rule first all the kingdoms
of Northern and finally those of Southern Chaldsea.

Babili—and their authority was not considered legitimate until officially
confirmed by the god. Each ruler was obliged to go in state to the temple
of Bel Merodach within a year of his accession : there he had to take the
hands of the divine statue, just as a vassal would do homage to his liege,
and those only of the native sovereigns or the foreign conquerors could
legally call themselves Kings of Babylon—sharru Babili — who had not only
performed this rite, but renewed it annually.^ Sargon the Elder had lived
in Babylon, and had built himself a palace there ; hence the tradition of later
times attributed to this city the glory of having been the capital of the great
empire founded by the Akkadian dynasties.^ The actual sway of Babylon,
though arrested to the south by the petty states of Lower Chaldaea, had not
encountered to the north or north-west any enemy to menace seriously its
progress in that semi-fabulous period of its history. The vast plain extending
between the Euphrates and the Tigris is as it were a continuation of the
Arabian desert, and is composed of a grey, or in parts a whitish, soil impreg
nated with selenite and common salt, and irregularly superimposed upon a
bed of gypsum, from which asphalt oozes up here and there, forming slimy pits.
Frost is of rare occurrence in winter, and rain is infrequent at any season ; the
sun soon burns up the scanty herbage which the spring showers have en
couraged, but fleshy plants successfully resist its heat, such as the common
salsola, the salsola soda, the pallasia, a small mimosa, and a species of very
fragrant wormwood, forming together a vari - coloured vegetation which
gives shelter to the ostrich and the wild ass, and affords the flocks of the
nomads a grateful pasturage when the autumn has set in.^ The Euphrates
bounds these solitudes, but without watering them. The river flows, as far as
the eye can see, between two ranges of rock or bare hills, at the foot of which
a narrow strip of alluvial soil supports rows of date-palms intermingled here
and there with poplars, sumachs, and willows. Wherever there is a break
‘ The meaning of the ceremony in which the kings of Babylon “ took the hands of Bel ” has been given by Winckler {Be inscriptione Sargonis regis Asayrix quse vocatur Annalium, thesis iv., and Studien und Beitrdge zur Babylonisch-Assyrischen Gescliichte, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. ii. p. 302, et seq., and Die Keihchrifttexte Sargons, p. xxxvi. ; cf. Lehmann, ScJiamaschschumuMn, Eonig von Bahylonien, pp. 44-53); Tiele {Babyloniscli-Amjriscjie GescMchte, pp. 276, 516) compares
it very aptly with the rite performed by the Egyptian kings —at Heliopolis, for example, when they entered alone the sanctuary of Ea, and tliere contemplated the god face to face. The rite was probably repeated annually (Lehmann, Sehamaschschumulnn, pp. 51, 53 ; Winckler, Studien und Beitrdge, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. ii. pp. 303, 304, and Untersuchungen zur Altorientalischer Gescliichte, p. 85), at the time of the Zakmuku, that is, the New Year festival. ^ Cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 597. According to Nabonidos and his contemporaries, Sargon and Nurainsin were kings of Babylon (Kawlinson, Gun. Ins. TV. As., vol. i. pi. 69, col. ii.
pp. 29, 30). ^ This region, which comprises the second and third zones into which the country lying between the Tigris and Euphrates may be divided, has been admirably depicted by Olivier, Voyage dans I’Empire Otlioman, VEgypte, la Perse, vol. ii. pp. 419-422 ; we are indebted to modern travellers for precise details, but not any of them has studied the country with the method and power of generalisation displayed by Olivier.

embouchure of the Khabur ; but there a black alluvial soil replaces the
saliferous clay, and if only the water were to remain on the land in suffi
cient quantity, the country would be unrivalled in the world for the abundance
and variety of its crops. The fields, which are regularly sown in the neigh

of game, emerge covered with red, blue, and yellow pollen.^ This fragrant

accustomed to wander over the plain, dwelling in tents, and supporting life by
the chase and by the rearing of cattle ; but the bulk of the inhabitants were
concentrated around the affluents of the Euphrates and Tigris, or at the foot
of the northern mountains wherever springs could be found, as in Assur,
Singar, Nisibis, Tilli,^ Kharranu, and in all the small fortified towns and
nameless townlets whose ruins are scattered over the tract of country
between the Khabur and the Balikh. Kharranu, or Harran, stood, like an
advance guard of Chaldman civilization, near the frontiers of Syria and Asia
Minor.^ To the north it commanded the passes which opened on to
the basins of the Upper Euphrates and Tigris; it protected the roads
leading to the east and south-east in the direction of the table-land of Iran
and the Persian Gulf, and it was the key to the route by which the commerce
of Babylon reached the countries lying around the Mediterranean. We have
no means of knowing what affinities as regards origin or race connected it
with Uru, but the same moon-god presided over the destinies of both towns,
and the Sin of Harran enjoyed in very early times a renown nearly equal to
that of his namesake. He was worshipped under the symbol of a conical
stone, probably an aerolite, surmounted by a gilded crescent,^ and the ground
plan of the town roughly described a crescent-shaped curve in honour of
its patron.^ His cult, even down to late times, was connected with cruel
practices; generations after the advent to power of the Abbasside caliphs,
his faithful worshippers continued to sacrifice to him human victims, whose
heads, prepared according to the ancient rite, were accustomed to give oracular
responses.® The government of the surrounding country was in the hands of
princes who were merely vicegerents : ® Chaldaean civilization before the

V. 12), the Carrhse of classical authors (Strabo, xvi. 1, § 23, p. 747 ; Pliny, Nat. Hist, v. 24), and this identification is still generally accepted (Finzi, Ricerche per lo studio delV Anticliit'a Assira, pp. 268-270 ; Fe. Schrader, Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd edit., pp. 134, 149) cf., however, what is said on p. 65 of this work. ^ Winckler (Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 83, 84) believes that the Sin of Harran is probably a moon-god of the Semites, in contradistinction to Nannar of Uru, who would be more specially the moon-god of the Sumerians. For the two Sins, cf. Sayce, The Religion of the Ancient Babylonians, pp. 160-165, who gives his opinion with greater reserve. * Sachau, Reise in Syrien und Mesopotamien, p. 223 ; and Baal-Harrdn in einer Altaramaisahen Inschrift auf einem Belief des Eoniglichen Museums zu Berlin, p. 3. * For the cultus of Sin at Harran, cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 658, 659. Without seeking to specify exactly which were the doctrines introduced into Harranian religion subsequently to the Christian era, we may yet afBrm that the base of this system of faith was merely a very distorted form of the ancient Chaldaean worship practised in the town. The information collected with regard to their history by Chwolson, Die Ssabier, vol. i., has been completed by the text published by Dozy-Goeje, Nouveaux Documents pour I’Aude de la religion des Harraniens, in the Actes du 6‘ Congres des Orientalistes, tenu en 1883, a Leyde, 2nd part, sect. 1, pp. 281-366. ® Only one vicegerent of Mesopotamia is known at present, and he belongs to the Assyrian epoch.

beginnings of history had more or less laid hold of them, and made them,
willing subjects to the kings of Babylond
These sovereigns were probably at the outset somewhat obscure personages,
without much prestige, being sometimes independent and sometimes subject to
the rulers of neighbouring states, among others to those of Agade. In later
times, when Babylon had attained to universal power, and it was desired to
furnish her kings with a continuous history, the names of these earlier rulers were
sought out, and added to those of such foreign princes as had from time to time
enjoyed the sovereignty over them—thus forming an interminable list which
for materials and authenticity would well compare with that of the Thinite
Pharaohs.^ This list has come down to us incomplete, and its remains do not
permit of our determining the exact order of reigns, or the status of the
individuals who composed it. We find in it, in the period immediately subse
quent to the Deluge, mention of mythical heroes, followed by names which are
still semi-legendary, such as Sargon the Elder ; the princes of the series were,
however, for the most part real beings, whose memories had been preserved
by tradition, or whose monuments were still existing in certain localities.®'
Towards the end of the XXV‘’^ century before our era, however, a dynasty rose
into power of which all the members come within the range of historv.^ The
first of them, Sumuabim, has left us some contracts bearing the dates of one

Dawn of Civilization, p. 596, note 2), is justly combated by Tiele in the Zeitsclirift fur Assyriologie, vol. vii. pp. 368-370. * For the composition of these dynasties, cf. Maspero, Daivn of Civilization, pp. 236-242.
“ The kings subsequent to the Deluge are mentioned in the Dawn of Civilization, p. 592. * This dynasty, which is known to us in its entirety by the two lists of G.

His opinion has not been generally adopted, but every Assyriologist dealing with this period proposes a different date for the reigns in this dynasty ; to take only one characteristic example, Khammurabi is placed by Oppert {The Beal Chronology and the True History of the Babylonian Dynasties, in the Babylonian and Oriental Becord, vol. ii. p. 108) in the year 2394-2339, by Delitzsch-Miirdter {Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, 2nd edit., p. 85 and vol. i.) in 2287-2232, by Winckler {Untersuchungen zur Altorientalischen

Sumulailu, who reigned after him, was only distantly related to his predecessor ;
but from Sumulailu to Samshusatana the kingly power was transmitted from
father to son without a break for nine generations, if we may credit the testi
mony of the official lists.^ Contemporary records, however, prove that the course
of affairs did not always run so smoothly. They betray the existence of at least
one usurper—Immeru —who, even if he did not assume the royal titles, enjoyed
the supreme power for several years between the reigns of Zabu and Abilsin.^
The lives of these rulers closely resembled those of their contemporaries of
Southern Chaldma.^ They dredged the ancient canals, or constructed new
ones ; ® they restored the walls of their fortresses, or built fresh strongholds on
the frontier they religiously kept the festivals of the divinities belonging to
their terrestrial domain, to whom they annually rendered solemn homage."^
They repaired the temples as a matter of course, and enriched them according
to their means ; we even know that Zabu, the third in order of the line of
sovereigns, occupied himself in building the sanctuary Eulbar of Anunit, in
Sippara.® There is evidence that they possessed the small neighbouring
kingdoms of Kishu, Sippara, and Kuta, and that they had consolidated them
into a single state, of which Babylon was the capital. To the south their

decessor, since both are placed in the same dynasty. A few contracts of Sumulailu are given by Meissner, Beitrdge zum althahylonischen PrivcttrecM, p. 4. Samsuiluna calls him “ my forefather {d-gula-mu), the fifth king before me ’ {Cyl.

The exact site of Tutu-khegal is still unknown. ® Sumulailu had built six such large strongholds of brick, which were repaired by Samsuiluna five generations later (Winckler, Vntersuchungen zur altorientalischen Geschichte, pp. 7, 142, and Keilinschriftliche Bibliotheh, Yol. iii. pp. 132,133; Hommel, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, p. 353). A fortress on the Elamite frontier, Kar-Dur-Abilsin, mentioned in a mutilated inscription (Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iii. p. 38, No. 2, verso, 1. 64), had probably been built by Abilsin, whose name it perpetuated (Fr. Delitzsch, Die Sprache der Kossxer, pp. 67, 68 ; Hommel, Geschichte
Bahyloniens und Assyriens, p. 355). A contract of Sinmuballit is dated the year in which he built the great wall of a strong place, the name of which is unfortunately illegible on the fragment which we possess (Meissner, Beitrdge, etc., pp. 81, 82). ’’ Contract of Sinmuballit, dated “ the year of the throne of Sin ” (Meissner, Beitrdge, etc., p. 70) ; also “ the year of Shamash and of Ramman ” (In., ibid., p. 72). ® Rawlinson, Cun.

Hommel, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, p. 354, believes that the passage merely indicates the ruin of the temple subsequent to the time of Zabu, and not by any means its restoration by that prince.



KINGS ANTERIOR TO EHAMMURABL 29'
possessions touched upon those of the kings of Uru, but the frontier was con
stantly shifting, so that at one time an important city such as Nippur belonged
to them, while at another it fell under the dominion of the southern provinces.
Perpetual war was waged in the narrow borderland which separated the two
rival states, resulting apparently in the balance of power being kept tolerably
equal between them under the immediate successors of Sumuabim ^—the
obscure Sumulailu, Zabum, the usurper Immeru, Abilsin and Sinmuballit
until the reign of Khammurabi (the son of Sinmuballit), who finally made it
incline to his side.^ The struggle in which he was engaged, and which, after
many vicissitudes, he brought to a successful issue, was the more decisive,,
since he had to contend against a skilful and energetic adversary who had
considerable forces at his disposal. Rimsin ^ was, in reality, of Elamite race,
and as he held the province of Yamutbal in appanage, he was enabled to
muster, in addition to his Chaldaean battalions, the army of foreigners who had
conquered the maritime regions at the mouth of the Tigris and the Euphrates.
It was not the first time that Elam had audaciously interfered in the
* None of these facts are as yet historically proved; we may, however, conjecture with someprobability what was the general state of things, when we remember that the first kings of Babylon were contemporaries of the last independent sovereigns of Southern Chaldsea.
^ The name of this prince has been read in several ways—Hammurabi, Khammurabi, by the earlier Aasyriologists, subsequently Hammuragash, Khammuragash, as being of Elamite or Cossseaii extraction : the reading Khammurabi is at present the prevailing one. The bilingual list published by Pinches (Notes on a New List of Early Babylonian Kings, in the Proceedings of the Biblical Archaeological Society, 1880-81, p. 38) makes Khammurabi an equivalent of the Semitic names Kimta-rapashtum. Hence Hale vy concluded that Khammurabi was a series of ideograms, and that Eiimtarapashtum was the true reading of tlie name (Melanges de Critique et d’ Histuire, p. 396 ; Recherches hihliques, pp. 254-258, 307-310 ; cf. Guyard, La Question Sum^ro-AccadMnne, in the Revue des Religions, vol. v. p. 274); his proposal, partially admitted by Hommel (Gishgallahi, Babylon, in the Proceedings, 1892-93, vol. XV. p. 110; Assyriological Notes, in the Proceedings, 1893-94, vol. xvi. p. 212), furnishes us with a mixed reading of Khammurapaltu, Amraphel. [Hommel is now convinced of the identity of the Amraphel of Gen. xiv. 1 with Khammurabi. Tr.] Sayce, moreover, adopts the reading Khammurabi, and assigns to him an Arabian origin (Fatriarc/ml Palestine, pp. vii.,viii., 62-64). The part played by this prince was pointed out at an early date by Me'nant (Inscriptions de Hammurabi,,
roi de Babylone, XVP siecle avant J.-C., 1863). Kecent discoveries have shown the important share which he had in developing the Chaldeeau empire, and have increased his reputation with Assyriologists (Tiele, Babylonisch-Assyrisclie, pp. 124, 127 ; Hommel, Geschiclite Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 407, et seq. ; Delitzsch-Murdter, Geschiclite Bab. und Ass 2nd edit., pp. 85-87 ; WiNCKLER, Geschiclite Bab. und Ass., pp. 60-65). ® The name of this king has been the theme of heated discussions : it was at first pronounced Aradsin, Ardusin, or Zikarsin (Oppert, Expedition en Mesopotamie, vol. i. p. 261) ; it is now read in
several different ways— Eimsiu (Delitzsch-Murdter, Geschiclite Bab. und Ass., 2nd edit., pp. 83, 84 WiNCKLEE, Geschiclite Bab. und Ass., p. 48), or Eriaku, Eiaku, Eimagu (Hommel, Gesch. Bah. u. Ass.,. pp. 362, 363 ; Hie Semitischen Volker und Sprache, p. 345 ; Halevy, Notes Sumeriennes, § 5, in the Revue Semitique, vol. ii. pp. 270-276; Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, p. 65, et seq.). Others have made a distinction between the two forms, and have made out of them the names of two different kings (G. Smith, Early History of Babylonia, in the Transactions of the Biblical Arch. Soc., vol. i. pp. 42, 43, and 53-55, where the author preserves, side by side with Eimsin, Oppert’s reading of Ardusin, Aradsin ; Ee. Delitzsch, Hie Sprache der Kossxer, pp. 68, 69 ; Tiele, Bab. Assyrische Geschiohte, pp. 122-124). They are all variants of the same name. I have adopted the form Eimsin, which is preferred by a few Assyriologists. [The tablets recently discovered by Mr. Pinches, referring to Kudur-lagamar and Tudkhula, which he has published in a Paper read before the Victoria Institute, Jan. 20, 1896, have shown that the true reading is Eri-Aku- The Elamite name Eri-Aku, “ servant of the moon-god,” was changed by some of his subjects into the Babylonian Eim-Sin,, “ Have mercy, 0 Moon-god ! ” just as Abesukh, the Hebrew Abishu'a (“ the father of welfare ”) was
transformed into the Babylonian Ebisum (“the actor”).— d.]

affairs of her neighbours. In fabulous times, one of her mythical kings
Khumbaha the Ferocious—had oppressed Uruk, and Gilgames with all his
valour was barely able to deliver the town.^ Sargon the Elder is credited
with having subdued Elam ; the kings and vicegerents'of Lagash had measured
forces with Anshau as well as with Uru and Larsam, but with uncertain issue.
From time to time they obtained an advantage, and we find recorded in the
annals victories gained by Gudea, Ine-sin, or Bursin,^ but to be followed
only by fresh reverses ; at the close of such campaigns, and in order to seal
the ensuing peace, a princess of Susa would be sent as a bride to one of the
Chaldaean cities, or a Chaldman lady of royal birth would enter the harem of a
king of Anshan.^ Elam was protected along the course of the Tigris and on
the shores of the Nar-Marratum by a wide marshy region, impassable except
at a few fixed and easily defended places.^ The alluvial plain extending
behind the marshes was as rich and fertile as that of Chaldaea. Wheat and
barley ordinarily yielded an hundred and at times two hundredfold ; ® the
towns were surrounded by a shadeless belt of palms ;
^ the almond, fig, acacia,
poplar, and willow extended in narrow belts along the rivers’ edge.'^ The
climate closely resembles that of Chaldma : if the midday heat in summer is
more pitiless, it is at least tempered by more frequent east winds.® The ground,
however, soon begins to rise, ascending gradually towards the north-east. The
distant and uniform line of mountain-peaks grows loftier on the approach of the
traveller, and the hills begin to appear one behind another, clothed halfway
up with thick forests, but bare on their summits, or scantily covered with
meagre vegetation. They comprise, in fact, six or seven parallel ranges,
' Cf. what is said on this subject in Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 579, 580. A much mutilated text, published by A. Strong {Three Cuneiform Texts, in the Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. vi. pp. 4-9), appears to refer in the same way to some fabulous struggle between a very ancient king of Chaldaea and a certain Khumbasitir, King of Elam. ' Contract dated “the year in which the King Ine-Sin ravaged Anshan” (Scheil, Notes d’Epig. et d’ Archdologie Assyriennes, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. p. 37; cf. Constantinople, N. 394). ® Contract dated “the year in which tlie king’s daughter went to Anshan” (Scheil, Notes d’Epigraphie et d' Archdologie Assyriennes, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. p. 38) ; an unpublished contract of Constantinople is dated “ the year in which the daughter of the King lue-Sin became vicegerent in Anshan and in Markhasi,” probably by marriage with the vicegerent of these countries. The title of “vicegerent” used in this passage appears to denote that Anshan was subject to the King Ine-Sin. * The geography of Elam has been made the subject of minute study in the monograph by Billeebeck, Susa, eine Studie zur Alien Geschichte Westasiens, pp. 1-23. ‘ Strabo, xv. 3, § 11, p. 731, who appears, however, to have taken his information in this case from the stories of Aristobulus, which should always be received with caution. “ Strabo, xv. 3, § 10, p. 731 ; xvi. 1, § 5, p. 739. Assyrian sculptures show us that these grew around the towns in the time of Assurbanipal as commonly as at the present day (Latard, Monuments of Nineveh, vol. ii. pi. 49). ' Loftus, Travels and Researches in Chaldsea and Susiana, pp. 270, 346. ® Strabo, xv. 3, § 10, p. 731, again following Aristobulus, relates that in summer the heat at midday is so excessive that snakes cannot cross the streets without running the risk of being literally baked by the sun. Modern travellers have shown themselves less susceptible to a high temperature, and have rarely left record of a day when the heat was unbearable (Loftds, Travels and Researches in Chaldxa and Susiana, pp. 290, 307).

came into contact with a white-skinned people of medium height, who were
probably allied to the nations of Northern and Central Asia—to the Scythians,
(Arkian, ^na&asis, vii. 7 ; Diodorus Siculus, xix. 19), also called Pasitigris (Arrian, Hist. lnd.,xin. Strabo, xv. 3, § 46, pp. 718-729 ; Pliny, Hist. Nat., vi. 31). It is the Karun of the present day (Fe.

for instance, if it is pernaissible to use a vague term
employed by the Ancients.^ Semites of the same
stock as those of Chaldma pushed forward as far
as the east bank of the Tigris, and settling mainly
among the marshes led a precarious life
by fishing and pillaging.^ The country
of the plain was called Anzan, or Anshan,®
and the mountain region Numma, or
Ilamma, “ the high lands : ” these two
names were subsequently used to denote
the whole country, and Ilamma has sur
vived in the Hebrew word Elam.^ Susa,
most important and flourishing town in
kingdom, was situated between the Ulai and
the Ididi, some twenty-five or thirty miles from the nearest of the mountain
1 This last-mentioned people is, by some authors, for reasons which, so far, can hardly be considered conclusive, connected with the so-called Sumerian race, which we find settled in Chaldsea (cf. Maspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 550, 551). They are said to have been the first to employ horses and chariots in warfare (Billerbeck, Susa, p. 24). 2 From the earliest times we meet beyond the Tigris with names like that of Durilu(cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 598), a fact which proves the existence of races speaking a Semitic dialect in the countries under the suzerainty of the King of Elam : in the last days of the Chaldaean empire they had assumed such importance that the Hebrews made out Elam to be one of the sons of Shem(Gen. x. 22). ^ Anzan, Ansban, and, by assimilation of the nasal with the sibilant, Ashshan. This name has already been mentioned in the inscriptions of the kings and vicegerents of Lagash (cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 603, 610) and in the Book of Prophecies of the ancient Chaldsean astronomers ; it also occurs in the royal preamble of Cyrus and his ancestors (Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. v. pi. 35,11. 12, 21), who like him were styled “kings of Ansh5,n.” It had been applied to the whole country of Elam (Halevy, Mdanges de Critique et d'Histoire, pp. 6, 7, 117-119, 129, 130), and afterwards to Persia (Amiaud, Cyrus, roi de Perse, in the Mdanges Renier, pp. 243-260 ; Oppeet, in the Gottingische gelehrte Anzeigen, 1881, No. 40, 1254-56, where the author questions the identity of Anshan with Anzan, regarding the latter word as the name of Elam, and the former as that of a Persian town, Pasargadse or Marrhasion); others are of opinion that it was the naine of a part of Elam, viz. that inhabited by the Turanian Medes who spoke the second language of the Acbsemenian inscriptions (Delattre, Le Peuple et la Langue des Perses, pp. 44, et seq.), the eastern half (H. Kawlinson, Notes on a Clay Cylinder of Cyrus the Great, in the J. B. As. S., new series, vol. xii. pp. 70-97, where the author connects the name with a town called Assan, mentioned as being in the neighbourhood of Shuster ; Tiele, Bahylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, p. 469), bounded by the Tigris and the Persian Gulf, consisting of a flat and swampy land (Satce, The Languages of the Cun. Inscr. of Elam, in the Trans. Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. iii. p. 475, and The Inscriptions of Mai-Amir, pp. 4, 5). These differences of opinion gave rise to a heated controversy ; it is now, however, pretty generally admitted that Anzan-Anshan was really the plain of Elam, from the mountains to the sea, and one set of authorities affirms that the word Anzan may have meant “ plain ” in the language of the country (Oppert, Les Inscriptions en langue susienne, in the MCm. du Congres internat. des Orientalistes de Paris, vol. ii. p. 194 ; cf. Fr. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Parodies ? p. 326), while others hesitate as yet to pronounce definitely on this point (Weissbach, Anzanisdie Inschriften, in the Abhandlungen of the Sax. Academy of Sciences, vol. xii. p. 137 ; vol. xiv. p. 736). * The meaning of “ Numma,” “Ilamma,” “Ilamtu,” in the group of words used to indicate Elam, had been recognised even by the earliest Assy riologists; tlie name originally referred to the hilly country on the north and east of Susa (Fe. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Parodies? p. 320). To the Hebrews, Elam was one of the sons of Shem {Gen. x. 22). The Greek form of the name is Elymais, and some of the classical geographers were well enough acquainted with the meaning of the word to be able to distinguish the region to which it referred from Susiana proper: ’EAv/zai (var. ’EAv/uai's), X<iiga.

Delitzsch, TFo lag das Parodies ? pp. 326, 327). ^ On the site of the citadel, cf. M. Diedlafoy, L’Acropole de Suse, p. 117, et seq. Strabo (xv. 3, § 2, p. 728) tells us, on the authority of Polycletus, that the town had no walls in the time of Alexander, and extended over a space two hundred stadia in length ; in the VIP'* century B.C. it was enclosed by walls with bastions, which are shown on a bas-relief of Assurbanipal, but it was surrounded by unfortified suburbs (Layard, Monuments of Nineveh, vol. ii. pi. 49). “ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after a plate in Chesney’s Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers Tigris and Euphrates, vol. ii. p. 356. It represents the tumulus of Susa as it appeared prior to the excavations of Loftus and the Dieulafoys. * Madaktu, Mataktu, the Badaka of Diodorus (xix. 19), situated on tlie Eulseos, between Susa and Ecbatana, has been placed by Eawlinson (The Five Great Monarchies, vol. ii. p. 173, No. 3) near the bifurcation of the Kerkhah, either at Paipul or near Aiwan-i-Kherkah, where there are some rather important and ancient ruins; Billerbeck (Susa, pp. 71, 72) prefers to put it at the mouth of the valley of Zal-fer, on the site at present occupied by the citadel of Kala-i-Eiza. * Naditu is identified by Finzi (Ricerche intorno alio Studio dell’ Antichita Assira, p. 298) with the village of Natanzah, near Ispahan ; it ought rather to be looked for in the neighbourhood of Sarna. " Til-Khumba, the Mound of Khumba, so named after one of the principal Elamite gods, was, perhaps, situated among the ruins of Budbar, towards the confluence of the Ab-i-Kirind and Kerkhah, or possibly higher up in the mountain, in the vicinity of Asmanabad (Billerbeck, Susa, p. 72). ’ Dur-Undash, Dur-Undasi, has been identified, without absolutely conclusive reason, with the fortress of Kala-i-Dis on the Disful-Kud (Billerbeck, Susa, p. 72). ® Khaidalu, Khidalu, is perhaps the present fortress of Dis-Malkan (Billerbeck, Susa, p. 72).

of several tribes—tlae Habardip, the Kbushshi/ the Umliyash, the people of
Yamutbal and of Yatbur ^—all independent of each other, but often united under
the authority of one sovereign, who as a rule chose Susa as the seat of govern
ment. The language is not represented by any idioms now spoken, and its
affinities with the Sumerian which some writers have attempted to establish,
are too uncertain to make it safe to base any theory upon them.^ The little
that we know of Elamite religion reveals to us a mysterious world, full of strange
names and vague forms.^ Over their hierarchy there presided a deity who was
called Shushinak (the Susian), Dimesh or Samesh, Dagbag, Assiga, Adaene, and
possibly Khumba and Umman, whom the Chaldmans identified with their god
Ninip ;

The Mardi or Amardians are the Habardip of the Assyro-Chaldsean inscriptions, the Khapirti-Apirti of the Susian and Achsemenian texts, who inhabited the region to the north-east of Susa, where are the monuments of Mal-Amir (Noreis, Scythia Version of the Behistun Inscription in tlie Journ. B. As. Soc., vol. xv. pp. 4, 164; Sayce, The Languages of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Elam and Media, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. iii. p. 468, and The Inscriptions of Mal-Amir, pp. 6-9) ; the Uxians are the Khushshi (Oppert, Les Inscriptions en langue susienne, Essai d’ interpretation, in the Mimoires du Congres international des Orientalistes de Paris, vol. ii. p. 183), and the Elymaeans are the Elamites (cf. p. 33, note 3, of the present work). The identity of the Cossaeans will be discussed at greater length on pp. 113-120 of this volume. ® The countries of Yatbur and Yamutbal extended into the plain between the marshes of the Tigris and the mountain ; the town of Durilu was near the Yamutbal region, if not in that country itself (Er. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies ? p. 230 ; Hommel, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 342, 354, who derives this name from that of Mutabil, governor of Durilu). Umliyash lay between the Uknu and the Tigris (Fe. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies? pp. 230, 231).
® A great part of the Susian inscriptions have been collected by Fr. Lenoemant, Choix de Textes cuneiformes inedits, pp. 115-141. They have been studied successively by Oppert, ies Inscriptions en langue susienne, Essai d’interpretation (in the Memoires du Congres international des Orientalistes de Paris, 1873, vol. ii. pp. 79-216) ; by Sayce, The Languages of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Edam (in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. iii. pp. 465-485), and The Inscriptions of Mal-Amir and the Language of the Second Column of the Achsemenian Inscriptions (in the Actes du sixieme Congres des Orientalistes, tenu en 1883 a Leyde, vol. ii. pp. 637-756) ; subsequently by WeissBACH, Anzanische Inschriften (in the Abhandlungen der Kgl. Sdchsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften, vol. xii. pp. 119-150), and Neue Beitrage zur Kunde der Susischen Inschriften (vol. xiv. pp. 731-777 of ihe same); by Quentin, Textes Susiens (in the Journal Asiatique, 1891, vol. xvii. p. 150, et seq.) and lastly by Wincklee, Zu den altsusischen Inschriften (in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. vi.
pp. 317-326). An attempt has been made to identify the language in which they are written with the Sumero-accadian (Lenoemant, La Magie chez les Chalddens,pp. 322-328, and La Langue primitive de la Chaldee, pp. 313-316), and authorities now generally agree in considering the Achaemenian inscriptions of the second type as representative of its modern form, cf. Weissbach, Anzanische Inschriften, pp. 149, 150. Hommel {Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 46, 47, 274, et seq., and Die Sumero-AJchadische Sprache, in the Zeitschrift fiir Keilschriftforschung, vol. i. pp. 330-340) •connects it with Georgian, and includes it in a great linguistic family, which comprises, besides these two idioms, the Hittite, the Cappadocian, the Armenian of the Van inscriptions, and the Cosssean. Oppert claims to have discovered on a tablet in the British Museum a list of words belonging to one of the idioms (probably Semitic) of Susiana, which ditfers alike from the Suso-Medic and the Assyrian {La Langue des Elamites, in the Revue d' Assyriologie, vol. i. pp. 45-49). * There are only about twenty lines or so on the religion of the Elamites in Fe.

This deity was associated with six others of the first rank, who were divided into
two triads—Shumudu, Lagamaru, Partikira ; Ammankasibar, Uduran, and
Sapak : of these names, the least repellent,
Ammankasibar, may possibly be the Memnon of
the Greeks.^ The dwelling of these divinities
was near Susa, in the depths of a sacred forest to
which the priests and kings alone had access
their images were brought out on certain days
to receive solemn homage, and were afterwards
carried back to their shrine accompanied by a
devout and reverent multitude. These deities
received a tenth of the spoil
after any successful campaign
the offerings comprising statues
of the enemies’ gods, valuable
vases, ingots of gold and silver,
furniture, and stuffs.^ The
Elamite armies were well or
ganized, and under a skilful
general became irresistible. In
other respects the Elamites
closely resembled the Chal
dseans, pursuing the same indus
tries and having the same agri
cultural and commercial instincts. In the absence of any bas-reliefs and
inscriptions peculiar to this people, we may glean from the monuments of
Lagash and Babylon a fair idea of the extent of their civilization in its
earliest stages.
The cities of the Euphrates, therefore, could have been sensible of but little
change, when the chances of war transferred them from the rule of their native
princes to that of an Elamite. The struggle once over, and the resulting evils

repaired as far as practicable, the people of these towns resumed their usual
ways, hardly conscious of the presence of their foreign ruler. The victors, for
their part, became assimilated so rapidly with the vanquished, that at the
close of a generation or so the conquering dynasty was regarded as a
legitimate and national one, loyally attached to the traditions and religion
of its adopted country. In the year 2285 B.c., towards the close of the
reign of Nurramman, or in the earlier part of that of Siniddinam,^ a King
of Elam, by name Kudur-nakhunta,^ triumphantly marched through Chaldsea
from end to end, devastating the country and sparing neither town nor
temple: Uruk lost its statue of Nana, which was carried off as a trophy
nnd placed in the sanctuary of Susa. The inhabitants long mourned the
detention of their goddess, and a hymn of lamentation, probably composed
for the occasion by one of their priests, kept the remembrance of the disaster
fresh in their memories. “ Until when, oh lady, shall the impious enemy
ravage the country !—In thy queen-city, Uruk, the destruction is accom
plished,—in Eulbar, the temple of thy oracle, blood has flowed like water,
upon the whole of thy lands has he poured out flame, and it is spread abroad
like smoke.—Oh, lady, verily it is hard for me to bend under the yoke of
misfortune ! — Oh, lady, thou hast wrapped me about, thou hast plunged me,
in sorrow !-— The impious mighty one has broken me in pieces like a reed,
and I know not what to resolve, I trust not in myself,—like a bed of reeds
I sigh day and night !— I, thy servant, I bow myself before thee !
” ^ It
would appear that the whole of Chaldaea, including Babylon itself, was
forced to acknowledge the supremacy of the invader ;

’ Cf. Maspebo, Dawn of Civilization, p. 619, for a summary of the little we know in regard to <tlie reigns of Nurramm§,n and Siniddinam. “ G. Smith, History of Assurhanipal, pp. 249-251, where Assurbanipal tells how he recovered, at .Susa, the statue of Nana, which King Kudurnankhundi had carried off 1635 years (other copies of the same text give 1535 years) before his time. This document, discovered by G. Smith {Egyptian Campaigns of Esarliaddon and Assur-bani-pal in the Zeitschrift fur Mgyptische Sprache, 1868, pp. 115, 116), has enabled historians to establish approximately the chronology of the first Babylonian empire. As we do not know the date of the capture of Susa by Assurbanipal, the possible error in regard to the date of this Kudurnankhundi is about twenty years, more or less; the invasion of •Chaldaea falls, therefore, between 2275 and 2295 b.c. if we accept the figures 1635, or between 2175 and 2195 if we take 1535 to be correct. Kudurnankhundi is a corruption of the name Kudurnakhunta, which occurs in the Susian inscriptions. As Kudur, or rather Kutur, means servant (Sayce, The Languages of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Elam, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. iii. p. 476), Kudurnakhunta signifies “ servant of the goddess Nakhunta.” “ Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. pi. 19, No. 3; cf. Fk. Lenoemant, Etudes Accadiennes, Yol. ii. pp. 101-106, and vol. iii. pp. 36, 37 ; Hommel, Die Semitischen Vollcer, p. 225, and Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyrians, p. 345. Another relic of this conquest has been discovered by Hilpeecht, The Babylonian Expedition, vol. i. p. 31 ; it is an agate tablet dedicated toNinS., for the life of Dungi, King of Uru, by an unknown vicegerent, carried off into Elam, and recovered some time in the XV*’' century by Kurigalzu. ^ The submission of Babylon Is evident from the title Adda Martu, “sovereign of the "West,” assumed by several of the Elamite princes (cf. p. 47 of the present work) : in order to extend his authority beyond the Euphrates, it was necessary for the King of Elam to be first of all master of

absorbed Chaldsea, reducing its states to feudal provinces, and its princes to
bumble vassals. Kudur-nakhunta having departed, the people of Larsa
exerted themselves to the utmost to repair the harm that he had done, and
they succeeded but too well, since their very prosperity was the cause only
a short time after of the outburst of another storm. Siniddinam, perhaps,
desired to shake off the Elamite yoke. Simtishilkhak, one of the successors of
Kudur-nakhunta, had conceded the principality of Yamutbal as a fief to Kudur
mabug, one of his sons. Kudur-mabug appears to have been a conqueror of
no mean ability, for he claims, in his inscriptions, the possession of the whole
of Syria.^ He obtained a victory over Siniddinam, and having dethroned him,
placed the administration of the kingdom in the hands of his own son Rimsin.^
This prince, who was at first a feudatory, afterwards associated in the govern
ment witli his father, and finally sole monarch after the latter’s death, married
a princess of Chaldrean blood,^ and by this means legitimatized his usurpation in
the eyes of his subjects. His domain, which lay on both sides of the Tigris
and of the Euphrates, comprised, besides the principality of Yamutbal, all the
towns dependent on Sumer and Accad—Uru, Larsa, Uruk, and Nippur. He
acquitted himself as a good sovereign in the sight of gods and men ; he
repaired the brickwork in the temple of Nannar at Uru ;
^ he embellished
the temple of Shamash at Larsa, and caused two statues of copper to be cast
in honour of the god ; he also rebuilt Lagash and Girsu.^ The city of Uruk
had been left a heap of ruins after the withdrawal of Kudur-nakhunta: he
set about the work of restoration, constructed a sanctuary to Papsukal, raised
the ziggurat of Nana, and consecrated to the goddess an entire set of temple
Babylon. In the early days of Assyriology it was supposed that this period of Elamite supremacy coincided with the Median dynasty of Berosus (G. Rawlinson, The Five Great Monarchies, vol. L p. 159, et seq. ; Oppert, Histoire des Emjnres de Chaldee et d’Assyrie, pp. 10-13). ‘ His preamble contains the titles adda Marlu (Rawlinson, Cm. Ins. W. As., vol. i. pi. 2, No. 3,. 1. 4), “prince of Syria; ” adda lamuthal (In., ibid., pi. 5, No. 16, 1. 9), “prince of Yamutbal.” The word adda seems properly to mean “ father,” and the literal translation of the full title would probably be ‘•‘father of Syria,” “father of Yamutbal,” whence the secondary meanings “ master, lord, prince” (G. Smith, Early History of Babylonia, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. i. p. 42), which have been provisionally accepted by most Assyriologists. Tiele (Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte,TpTp. 123, 124), and Winckler after him (TJntersuchungen zur altorientalischen Geschichte, p. 37, n. 2), have suggested that Martu is here equivalent to Yamutbal, and that it was merely used to indicate the western part of Elam ; Winckler afterwards rejected this hypothesis, and has come round to the general opinion {Altorientalische Forschungen, p. 143, et seq., and Geschichte Israels, vol. i. pp. 130, 131). In regard to the reading of the word Rimsiu, cf. p. 29, n. 3, of the present work. His preamble contains the titles “Benefactor of Uru, King of Larsa, King of Shumir and of Accad” (Rawlinson, Gun.

furniture to replace that carried off by the Elamitesd He won the adhesion of
the priests by piously augmenting their revenues, and throughout his reign dis
played remarkable energy,^ Documents exist which attribute to him the reduction
of Durilu, on the borders of Elam and the Chaldsean states ; ^ others contain dis
creet allusions to a perverse enemy who disturbed his peace in the north, and
whom he successfully repulsed.^ He drove Sinmuballit out of Ishin,® and this
victory so forcibly impressed his contemporaries, that they made it the starting
point of a new semi-official era ; twenty-eight years after the event, private con
tracts still continued to be dated by reference to the taking of Ishin. Sinmu
ballit’s son, Khammurabi, was more fortunate. Kimsin vainly appealed for help
against him to his relative and suzerain Kudur-lagamar, who had succeeded
Simtishilkhak at Susa. Kimsin was defeated, and disappeared from the scene of
action, leaving no trace behind him, though we may infer that he took refuge in
his fief of Yamutbal.® The conquest by Khammurabi was by no means achieved
at one blow, the enemy offering an obstinate resistance. He was forced to
destroy several fortresses, the inhabitants of which had either risen against him
or had refused to do him homage, among them being those of Meir and Malgu.®

A variant, indicating that it was a time of peace, is found on another contract of the same year (Eawlinson, Gun. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. pi. 36, No. 2; cf. G. Smith, Early History, in the Transactions Bib. Arch. Soc., vol. i. p. 55 ; Hommel, GescMchte Babyloniens, etc., p. 361). Many Assyriologists regard this as indicating a defeat suffered by Khammurabi (G. Smith, Early History of Babylonia, in the Transactions, vol. i. pp. 55-57). The contract published by Meissner, Beitrage zum altbabyl. Privatrecht, pp. 32, 33, proves that the event took place under Sinmuballit. This prince is there stated to have been then alive, an oath in the body of the document being sworn by him and by the town of Sippar, but the date is that of “ the year of the taking of Ishin.” * Contracts dated “ the taking of Ishin ” (Meissner, Beitrdge zum altbabyl.

Smith, Early History, p. 54, where the name is transcribed Karrak). ® This is a contract dated the year in which Khammurabi defeated Eimsin, thanks to the help of Anu and Bel (Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. IF. As., vol. iv. pi. 36, No. 21 ; cf. G. Smith, Early History of Babylonia, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archxology, vol. i. p. 57 ; Hommel, Geschiclite Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 361, 362) ; Jensen {Inschriften aus der Zeit Hammurabi's, in the Eeilinschriftliche Bibliothek, voi. iii. p. 127, note) is, so far as I know, alone in believing that we cannot with any
certainty deduce from this passage that Eimsin was really defeated by Khammurabi. A notice of the wars of Eimsin and Kudur-lagamar has been discovered by Pinches (Hommel, Aus der Babylonischen Alterthumshunde, in Die Aula, 1705, vol. i. pp. 551, 552 ; Sayce, Recent Discoveries in Babylonian and Egyptian History, in the Academy, Sept. 7, 1895, p. 189, and Patriarchal Palestine, pp. v., vi., 64-70).

40 THE FIBST CHALDEAN EMPIRE.
When the last revolt liad been put down, all the countries speaking the
language of Chaldfea and sharing its civilization were finally united into
a single kingdom, of which Khammurabi proclaimed himself the head.
Other princes who had preceded him had enjoyed the same opportunities, but
their efforts had never been successful in establishing an empire of any dura
tion ; the various elements had been bound together for a moment, merely to
be dispersed again after a short interval. The work of Khammurabi, on the
contrary, was placed on a solid foundation, and remained unimpaired under his
successors. Not only did he hold sway without a rival in the south as in the
north, but the titles indicating the rights he had acquired over Sumer and
Accad were inserted in his Protocol after those denoting his hereditary pos
sessions,—the city of Bel and the four houses of the world. Khammurabi’s
victory marks the close of those long centuries of gradual evolution during which
the peoples of the Lower Euphrates passed from division to unity. Before his
reign there had been as many states as cities, and as many dynasties as there
were states ; after him there was but one kingdom under one line of kings.
Khammurabi’s long reign of fifty-five years has hitherto yielded us but a
small number of monuments—seals, heads of sceptres, alabaster vases, and
pompous inscriptions, scarcely any of them being of historical interest. He was
famous for the number of his campaigns, no details of which, however, have
come to light, but the dedication of one of his statues celebrates his good
fortune on the battle-field. “ Bel has lent thee sovereign majesty : thou, what
awaitest thou ?— Sin has lent thee royalty : thou, what awaitest thou ?—Ninip
has lent thee his supreme weapon : thou, what awaitest thou ?—The goddess of
light, Ishtar, has lent thee the shock of arms and the fray : thou, what awaitest
thou?—Shamash and Kamman are thy varlets : thou, what awaitest thou?
It is Khammurabi, the king, the ijowerl'ul chieftain— who cuts the enemies in
pieces, — the Avhirlwind of battle—who overthrows the country of the rebels
who stays combats, who crushes rebellions,— who destroys the stubborn like
images of clay, — who overcomes the obstacles of inaccessible mountains.” ^ The
majority of these expeditions were, no doubt, consequent on the victory which

destroyed the power of Eimsin. It would not have sufficed merely to drive
back the Elamites beyond the Tigris ; it was necessary to strike a blow within
their own territory to avoid a recurrence of hostilities, which might have
endangered the still recent work of conquest.
Here, again, Khammurabi seems to have met
with his habitual success. Ashnunak was a border
district, and shared the fate of all the provinces
on the eastern bank of the Tigris, being held
sometimes by Elam and sometimes by Chaldaea;
properly speaking, it was a country of Semitic
speech, and was governed by viceroys owning
allegiance, now to Babylon, now to Susa.^ Kham
murabi seized this province,^ and permanently
secured its frontier by building along the river a line head op a sceptire in coppeb, beae
ING THE NAME OP KHAMMURABI/ of fortresses surrounded by earthworks.^ Following
the example of his predecessors, he set himself to restore and enrich the temples.
The house of Zamama and Ninni, at Kish, was out of repair, and the ziggurat
threatened to fall; he pulled it down and rebuilt it, carrying it to such a
height that its summit “ reached the heavens.” ® Merodach had delegated to him
the government of the faithful, and had raised him to the rank of supreme ruler
over the whole of Chaldsea. At Babylon, close to the great lake which served
as a reservoir for the overflow of the Euphrates, the king restored the sanctuary
of Esagilla, the dimensions of which did not appear to him to be proportionate
to the growing importance of the city. “ He completed this divine dwelling
with great joy and delight, he raised the summit to the firmament,” and then
* POGNON, Quelques Bois du pays d’Achnounnak (in the Mus^on, 1892, pp. 249-253), discovered inscriptions of four of the vicegerents of Ashnunak, which he assigns, with some hesitation, to the
time of Khammurabi, rather than to that of the kings of Telloh. Three of these names are Semitic,
the fourth Sumerian ; the language of the inscriptions bears a resemblance to the Semitic dialect of
Ohaldma (cf. Pinches, Discoveries in Ashnunnak, in the Babylonian and Oriental Becord vol vi pp. 66-68).
“ Proof of his conquest of these two countries is afforded by inscriptions on contracts dated “ the
year in which Ashnunak was inundated, under King Khammurabi ” (Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As.

pp. 30-47, 48, 69; Scheil, Notes d' Bpigraphie et d'ArcMologie Assyriennes, in the Becueilde Travaux,
vol. xvii. p. 35). Ashnunak, or Ishnunak, is, according to some documents, the same country as
Umliyash (Fr. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Parodies ? pp. 230, 231); the probability is, however, that it
was originally an independent province, subsequently incorporated with Umliyash.

earthly inhabitants,^ he did not forget Shamash and Malkatu, the celestial
patrons of the town. He enlarged in their honour the mysterious Ebarra, the
sacred seat of their worship, and “ that which no king from the earliest times
had known how to build for his divine master, that did he generously for
Shamash his master.”^ He restored Ezida, the eternal dwelling of Merodach,

KHAMMURABI REGULATES TEE SYSTEM OF CANALIZATION. 43
he could count on their gratitude in securing for him the people’s obedience,
and thus prevent the outbreak of a revolt. He had, indeed, before him
a difficult task in attempting to allay the ills which had been growing
during centuries of civil discord and foreign conquest. The irrigation
of the country demanded constant attention, and from
earliest times its sovereigns had directed the work
with real solicitude ; but owing to the breaking
up of the country into small states, their respec
tive resources could not be combined in such
general operations as were needed for controlling
the inundations and effectually remedying the excess
or the scarcity of -water. Khammurabi witnessed the
damage done to the whole province of TJmliyash by
one of those terrible floods which still sometimes ravage
the regions of the Lower Tigris,^ and possibly it may have
been to prevent the recurrence of such a disaster that he under
took the work of canalization. He was the first that we know of
who attempted to organize and reduce to a single system the com
plicated network of ditches and channels which intersected the
territory belonging to the great cities between Babylon and the
sea.^ Already, more than half a century previously, Siniddinam had
enlarged the canal on which Larsa was situated,^ while Eimsin had
provided an outlet for the “Eiver of the Gods” into the Persian Gulf: ® by the
junction of the two a navigable channel was formed between the Euphrates and
the marshes, and an outlet was thus made for the surplus waters of the inun
dation. Khammurabi informs us how Anu and Bel, having confided to him the
government of Sumer and Accad, and having placed in his hands the reins of
power, he dug the Mr-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to the people, which
brings abundance of water to the country of Sumir and Accad. “ I turned both

its banks into cultivated ground, I heaped up mounds of grain and I furnished
perpetual water for the people of Sumir and Accad. The country of Sumer
and Accad, I gathered together its nations who were scattered, I gave them
pasture and drink, I ruled over them in riches and abundance, I caused them
to inhabit a peaceful dwelling-place. Then it was that Khammurabi, the
powerful king, the favourite of the great gods, I myself, according to the
prodigious strength with which Merodach had endued me, I constructed a high
fortress, upon mounds of earth ; its summit rises to the height of the mountains,
at the head of the Nar-Khammurabi, the source of wealth to the people. This
fortress I called Dur-Sinmuballit-abim-ualidiya, the Fortress of Sinmuballit,
the father who begat me, so that the name of Sinmuballit, the father who begat
me, may endure in the habitations of the world.” ^ This canal of Khammurabi
ran from a little south of Babylon, joining those of Siniddinam and Kimsin, and
probably cutting the alluvial plain in its entire length.^ It drained the stag
nant marshes on either side along its course, and by its fertilising effects, the
dwellers on its banks were enabled to reap full harvests from the lands which pre
viously had been useless for purposes of cultivation. A ditch of minor importance
pierced the isthmus which separates the Tigris and the Euphrates in the neigh
bourhood of Sippar.^ Khammurabi did not rest contented with these ; a system
of secondary canals doubtless completed the whole scheme of irrigation which he
liad planned after the achievement of his conquest, and his successors had merely
to keep up his work in order to ensure an unrivalled prosperity to the empire.
Their efforts in this direction were not unsuccessful. Samsuiluua, the son
of Khammurabi, added to the existing system two or three fresh canals, one at
least of which still bore his name nearly fifteen centuries later ;

The inscription is now preserved in the Louvre. Many contracts are dated from the year in which this canal was finished (Meissner, Beitrdge zum ulthahylonisclien Privatrecht, pp. 23, 48, 86). 2 Delattre, Les Travaux hiydrauliques en Babylonie, pp. 35, 36, is of opinion that the canal dug by Khammurabi is the Arakhtu of later epochs (Fe. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies ? p2i. 74-76), which began at Babylon and extended as far as the Larsa canal. It must therefore be approximately identified with the Shatt-en-Nil of the present day, which joins Shatt-el-Kaher, the canal of Siniddinam. 3 Cylindre de Hammourabi, col. i. 11. 20-23, in Winckler-Strassmaiee, Einige neuverbffentliche Texte Hammurabis, Nabopolatsars, und Ncbucadnezars, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. ii. pj). 118-123, where it is evidently not the Euphrates which is meant, as Winckler seems to think (cf. Ein Text Nabopolassars, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. ii. p. 74). The canal which Khammurabi caused to be dug or dredged may be the Nar-Malka, or “royal canal” (Winckler, Ein Text Nabojmlassars, p. 70; Delattre, Les Travaux hydrauliques en Babylonie, p. 36), which ran from the Tigris to the Euphrates, passing Sippar on the way.

The annalistic tablet S'. 16 in the museum of Constantinople gives, after the year in which the king dug the canal, that in which “ the canal gave abundance.” The canal in question is mentioned in a list of canals and rivers from the library of Assurbanipal (Kawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. Js., vol. ii. pi. 51, No. 2, recto, 1. 51 ; cf. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies‘1 p. 190 ; Delattee, Les Travaux hydrauliques en Bahylonie, pp. 37, 48). • Abishukh (the Hebrew Abishua) is the form of the name which we find in contemporary contracts (Wincklee, Altorientalische Forschurtgen, p. 284 ; Meissner, Beitrage ztim ultbahylonischen Privatrecht, pp. 4, 17, 18). The official lists contain the variant Ebishu, Ebishurn. * The name has been transcribed Ammiditana (Delitzsch-Murdtee, Gesch. Bah. und Assyrians, 2nd edit., p. 88 ; Hommel, Geschichte Babylonians und Assyrians, pp. 416, 417) : others prefer Ammisatana (Pinches, Text of Ammisatana, King of Babylon, in the Racords of the Past, 2nd series, vol. V. pp. 102-105; Wincklee, Gaschichte Babylonians und Assyrians, p. 66). The Nar- Ammisatana is mentioned in a Sippar contract (Meissnee, Baitrdge, etc., p. 28). Another contract is dated “the year in which Ammisatana, the king, repaired the canal of Samsuiluna ” (Id., ibid., p. 59). ’ This was, at first, read Ammididugga (Fe. Delitzsch, Die Sprache der Kossaer, p. 70, n. 6).
Ammizadugga is mentioned in the date of a contract as having executed certain works —of what
nature it is not easy to say —on the banks of the Tigris (Meissner, Beitrage zum althabylonischen Privatrecht, pp. 61, 62); another contract is dated “the year in which Ammizadugga, the king, by supreme command of Shamash, his master, [dug] the Ndr-Ammizadugga-nuhhus-nishi (canal of Ammizadugga), prosperity of men” (Id., ibid., pp. 86, 87). In the Miusean inscriptions of Southern Arabia the name is found under the form of Ammi-Zaduq. * Sometimes erroneously read Samdiusatana (but see Wincklee, Geschichte Babylonians und Assyrians, p. 60) ; but, as a matter of fact, we have contracts of that time, in which a royal name is plainly written as Samsusatana (Meissner, Beitrage, etc., p. 45). ® Contracts of the time of Ammizadugga, dated from the enthronement of Shamash and Merodach (Meissner, Beitrage, etc., pp. 18, 19), or from “the year in which he proclaimed, in the temple at Enamtila, a god” whose name is uncertain (Id., ibid., pp. 41, 42). ® Contract dated “ the year in which Samsuiluna, the king, made the true light ” (Meissnee, Beitrage, etc., pp. 80, 81). At present we have no exact knowledge of what this ceremony was. ’ Contracts dated the year in which Samsuiluna placed the statues plated with gold before Merodach, in Esagilla at Babylon (Rawlinson, Gun. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. pi. 36, Nos. 66, 67), or in Ebabbara at Larsa, before Shamash (Id., ibid., pi. 36, No. 58) ; cf. G.

of any king occurred, he was immediately replaced by his son,^ the notaries’
acts and the judicial documents which have come down to us betraying no
confusion or abnormal delay in the course of affairs. We may, therefore,
conclude that the last century and a half of the dynasty was a period of peace
and of material prosperity. Chaldsea was thus enabled to fully reap the advan
tage of being united under the rule of one individual. It is quite possible
that those cities—Uru, Larsa, Ishin, Uruk, and Nippur—which had played
so important a part in the preceding centuries, suffered from the loss of their
prestige, and from the blow dealt to their traditional pretensions. Up to this
time they had claimed the privilege of controlling the history of their country,
and they had bravely striven among themselves for the supremacy over the
southern states ; but the revolutions which had raised each in turn to the
zenith of power, had never exalted any one of them to such an eminence as to
deprive its rivals of all hope of supplanting it and of enjoying the highest
place. The rise of Babylon destroyed the last chance which any of them had
of ever becoming the capital ; the new city was so favourably situated, and
possessed so much wealth and so many soldiers, while its kings displayed
such tenacious energy, that its neighbours were forced to bow before it and
resign themselves to the subordinate position of leading provincial towns.
They gave a loyal obedience to the officers sent them from the north, and
sank gradually into obscurity, the loss of their political supremacy being some
what compensated for by the religious respect in which they were always
held. Their ancient divinities—Nana, Sin, Anu, and Ea—were adopted, if we
may use the term, by the Babylonians, who claimed the protection of these
gods as fully as they did that of Merodach or of Nebo, and prided them
selves on amply supplying all their needs. As the inhabitants of Babylon had
considerable resources at their disposal, their appeal to these deities might be
regarded as productive of more substantial results than the appeal of a merely
local kinglet. The increase of the national wealth and the concentration,
under one head, of armies hitherto owning several chiefs, enabled the rulers,
not of Babylon or Larsa alone, but of the whole of Chaldaea, to offer an
invincible resistance to foreign enemies, and to establish their dominion
in countries where their ancestors had enjoyed merely a precarious sove
reignty. Hostilities never completely ceased between Elam and Babylon ; if

arrested for a time, they broke out again in some frontier disturbance, at times
speedily suppressed, but at others entailing violent consequences and ending
in a regular war. No document furnishes us with any detailed account of
these outbreaks, but it would appear that the balance of power was maintained on
the whole with tolerable regularity, both kingdoms at the close of each genera
tion finding themselves in much the same position as they had occupied at its
commencement. The two empires were separated from south to north by the
sea and the Tigris, the frontier leaving the river near the present village of
Amara and running in the direction of the mountains. Durilu probably fell
ordinarily under Chaldsean jurisdiction. Umliyash was included in the original
domain of Khammurabi, and there is no reason to believe that it was evacuated
by his descendants.^ There is every probability that they possessed the plain
east of the Tigris, comprising Nineveh and Arbela, and that the majority of
the civilized peoples scattered over the lower slopes of the Kurdish mountains
rendered them homage. They kept the Mesopotamian table-land under their
suzerainty, and we may afSrm, without exaggeration, that their power extended
northwards as far as Mount Masios, and westwards to the middle course of the
Euphrates.
At what period the Chaldseans first crossed that river is as yet unknown.
Many of their rulers in their inscriptions claim the title of suzerains over Syria,
and we have no evidence for denying their pretensions.

claims himself “ adda ” of Martu, Lord of the countries of the West,^ and we
are in the possession of several facts which suggest the idea of a great Elamite
empire, with a dominion extending for some period over Western Asia, the
existence of which was vaguely hinted at by the Greeks, who attributed its glory
to the fabulous Memnon.^ Contemporary records are still wanting which might
show whether Kudur-mabug inherited these distant possessions from one of his
predecessors —such as Kudur-nakhunta, for instance or whether he won them
himself at the point of the sword ; but a fragment of an old chronicle, inserted
in the Hebrew Scriptures, speaks distinctly of another Elamite, who made war
in person almost up to the Egyptian frontier.® This is the Kudur-lagamar
‘ Cf. what has been said in regard to Umliyash on p. 43 of the present work. * See remarks on this title and its probable meaning on p. 37 of the present work. ^ We know that to Herodotus (v. 55) Susa was the city of Memnon, and that Strabo (xv. 3, § 2, p. 728) attributes its foundation to Tithonus, father of Memnon. According to Oppert (ies Inscriptions en langue susienne, Essai d’interpretation, in the Memoires du Congres international des Orientalistes a Paris, vol. ii. p. 179) the word Memnon is the equivalent of the Susian Umman-anin, “the house of the king:” Weissbach (Anzanische Inschriften, p. 136) declares that “anin” does not mean king, and contradicts Oppert’s view, though he does not venture to suggest a new explanation of the name. * In regard to Kudur-nakhunta, see what has been said above on pp. 36, 37 of the present work. ^ Gen. xiv. From the outset Assyriologists have never doubted the historical accuracy of this chapter, and they have connected the facts which it contains with those which seem to be revealed by the Assyrian monuments.

(Chedorlaomer) who helped Eimsiu against Khammurabi, but was unable to
prevent his overthrow. In the thirteenth year of his reign over the East, the
cities of the Dead Sea—Sodom, Gomorrah, Adamah, Zeboim, and Bela—revolted ‘
against him : he immediately convoked his great vassals, Amraphel of Chaldaea,
Arioch of Ellasar,^ Tida‘lo the Guti, and marched with them to the confines of
his dominions. Tradition has invested many of the tribes then inhabiting
Southern Syria with semi-mythical names and attributes. They are represented
as being giants—Eephaim ; men of prodigious strength—Zuzim ; as having
a buzzing and indistinct manner of speech—Zamzummim ; as formidable
monsters ^—Emiin or Anakim, before whom other nations appeared as grass
hoppers ; ^ as the Hoiim who were encamped on the confines of the Sinaitic desert,
and as the Amalekites who ranged over the mountains to the west of the Dead
Sea. Kudur-lagamar defeated them one after another—the Kephaim near to
Ashtaroth-Karnaim, the Zuzim near Ham,^ the Emim at Shaveh-Kiriathaim,
and the Horim on the spurs of Mount Seir as far as El-Paran ; then retracing
his footsteps, he entered the country of the Amalekites by way of En-mish
and Oppert places him about tbe same period (Histoire des empires de Chaldee et d’Assyrie d'apres les monuments, pp. 10, 11). Fr. Lenormant regards him as one of the successors of Kudur-mabug, possibly bis immediate successor (La Langue primitive de la Chaldee et les idiomes touraniens, pp. 375, 37G). G. Smith does not hesitate to declare positively that the Kudur-mabug and Kudurnakhunta of tbe inscriptious are one and tbe same with the Kudur-lagamar (Chedor-laomer) of the Bible (Egiiplian Campaign of Esarliaddon, in the Zeitschrift fiir ASgyptisclie Sprache, 1868, vol. i. p. 116). Finally, Schrader, while he repudiates Smith’s view, agrees in tbe main fact with the other
Assyriologists (Die Keilinschri/ten und das alte Testament, 2ud eiit., pp. 136, 137). We find the same view, with but slight modification, in Delitzsch-Miirdter (GescMclite Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 83, note), in Ed. Meyer (Gescliichte des Alterthunis, vol. i. pp. 165, 166), and in Hommel (GescMclite Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 363, et seq.). On tbe other hand, the majority of modern Biblical critics have absolutely refused to credit the story in Genesis, e.g. Reuss (L’Hisloire Saint et la Loi, vol. i. pp. 345-350), Noldeke (Uniersuchungen zur Kritik des Alte Testament, p. 156, et seq.), Tiele (Babylonisch-Assyrische GescMclite, pp. 123, 124), Winckler (GescMclite Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 48, where Kudur-lagamar is not noticed at all). Sayce (The Higher Criticism, etc., 3rd edit., pp. 160-160) thinks that the Bible story rests on an historic basis, and his view is strongly confirmed by Pinches’ discovery of a Chahlsean document which mentions Kudur-lagamar and two of his allies (Hommel, Aus der Babylonische Alterlumskunde, in Die Aula, 1895, vol. i. p. 552 ; Sayce, Recent Discoveries in Babylonian and Egyptian History, in the Academy, Sept. 7, 1895, p. 189, and Patriarchal Palestine, pp. v., vi., 64-76). The Hebrew historiographer reproduced an authentic fact from the chronicles of Babylon, and connected it with one of the events in the life of Abraham. The very late date generally assigned to Gen. xiv. in no way diminishes the intrinsic probability of the facts narrated by the Chaldsean document which is preserved to us in the pages of the Hebrew book. * Ellasar has been identified with Larsa since the researches of Rawlinson and Norris (Fe. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Parodies? p. 224; Schrader, Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament. 2ud edit., pp. 135, 136); the Goim, over whom Tidal was king, with the Guti (Schrader, Die Keilinschriften, p. 137). * Sayce, The Higher Criticism and the Verdict of the Monuments, 3rd edit., pp. 160, 161, considers
Zuzim and Zamzummim to be two readings of the same word Zamzum, written in cuneiform characters
on the original document. The sounds represented, in the Hebrew alphabet, by the letters m and w, are expressed in the Chaldsean syllabary by the same character, and a Hebrew or Babylonian scribe, who had no other means of telling the true pronunciation of a race-name mentioned in the story of this campaign, would have been quite as much at a loss as any modern scholar to say whether he ought to transcribe the word as Z-m-z-m or as Z-w-z-w; some scribes read it Zuzim, others preferred Zamzronmim. ^ Numb. xiii. 33. ' In Deut. ii. 20 it is stated that the Zamzummim lived in the country of Ammon. Sayce points out
that we often find the variant Am fur the character usually read Ham or Eham—the name Khammurabi,

pat, and pillaged the Amorites of Hazazon-Taraar. In the mean time, the
kings of the five towns had concentrated their troops in the vale of Siddim,
and were there resolutely awaiting Kudur-lagamar. They were, however,
completely routed, some of the fugitives being swallowed up in the pits of
bitumen with which the soil abounded, while others with difficulty reached
the mountains. Kudur-lagamar sacked Sodom and Gomorrah, re-established
his dominion on all sides, and returned laden with booty, Hebrew tradition adding
that he was overtaken near the sources of the Jordan by the patriarch Abraham.^
After his victory over Kudur-lagamar, Khammurabi assumed the title of
King of Martu,^ which we find still borne by Ammisatana sixty years later.^
We see repeated here almost exactly what took place in Ethiopia at the time
of its conquest by Egypt : merchants had prepared the way for military occu
pation, and the civilization of Babylon had taken hold on the people long before
its kings had become sufficiently powerful to claim them as vassals. The
empire may be said to have been virtually established from the day when the
states of the Middle and Lower Euphrates formed but one kingdom in
the hands of a single ruler. We must not, however, imagine it to have been
a compact territory, divided into provinces under military occupation, ruled by
a uniform code of laws and statutes, and administered throughout by functionaries
of various grades, who received their orders from Babylon or Susa, according
as the chances of war favoured the. ascendancy of Chaldtea or Elam. It was in
for instance, is often found written Ammurabi (cf. p. 15, n. 5, of the present work); the Ham in the narrative of Genesis would, therefore, be identical with the land of Ammon in Deuteronomy, and the difference between the spelling of the two would be due to the fact that the document reproduced in the XIV"' chapter of Genesis had been originally copied from a cuneiform tablet in which the name of the place was expressed by the sign Eam-Am (Satoe, The Higher Criticism, 3rd edit., pp. 160, 101). ' An attempt has been made to identify the three vassals of Kudur-lagamar with kings mentioned on the Chaldsean monuments. Tidcal, or, if we adopt the Septuagint variant, Thorgal, has been considered by some as the bearer of a Sumerian name, Tur-gal = “ great chief,” “ great son ” (Oppeht, Histoire des Empires de Chaldee, p. 11), while others put him on one side as not having been a Babylonian (Halevy, Eecherches Bihliques, p. 254, and Notes Sum^riennes, in the Revue S^mitique, vol. ii. pp. 278-280); Pinches, Sayce, and Hommel identify him with Tudkhula, an ally of Kudur-lagamar against Khammurabi (Homjiel, Aus der Bahylonischeii Altertumskunde, in Die Aula, 1895, vol. i. p. 552; Sayce, Recent Discoveries, in the Academy, Sept. 7, 1895, p. 189, and Patriarchal Palestine, p. 70). Arioch is Eimaku, Eri-Aku (cf. p. 29, n. 2, of the present work,, and Fe. Lenokmant, La Langue primitive de la Chaldee, pp. 378, 379 ; Scheadee, Die Keilinschri/ten, 2ud edit., pp. 135, 136 ; Hoauuel, Die Semitische Vollcer, p. 48 ; Halevy, Reeherches Bihliques, pp. 253, 254, and Notes Sum^riennes, in the Revue S^mitique, vol. ii. pp. 272-276). Schrader was the first to suggest that Amraphel was really Khammurabi {Die Keilinschriftliche Bahylonisclie Kdnigsliste, pp. 22-27), and emended the Amraphel of the biblical text into Amraphi or Amrabi, in order to support this identification. Halevy, while on the whole accepting this theory, derives the name from the pronunciation Kimtarapashtum or Kimtarapaltum, which he attributes to the name generally read Khammurabi {Reeherches Bihliques, pp. 254-258, 303-315), and in this he is partly supported by Hommel, wdio reads “ Khammurapaltu ” {Assyriological Notes, in the Proceedings of Soc. of Bibl. Arch., vol. xvi. p. 212), ® It is, indeed, the sole title which he attributes to himself on a stone tablet now in the British Museum ; cf. Wincklee, Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 145, 146. ’ In an inscription by this prince, copied probably about the time of Nabonidus by the scribe Belushallim, he is called “king of the vast land of Martu” (Pinches, Text of Ammisatana, King of Babylon, from about 2115 to 2090 B.C., in the Records of the Past, 2nd series, vol. v. pp. 102-105).

50 THE FIRST CHALDjFAN EMPIRE.
reality a motley assemblage of tribes and principalities, whose sole bond of union
Avas subjection to a common yoke. They were under obligation to pay tribute,
and furnish military contingents and show other external marks of obedience, but
their particular constitution, customs, and religion were alike respected : they
had to purchase, at the cost of a periodical ransom, the right to live in their
own country after their own fashion, and the head of the empire forbore all
interference in their affairs, except in cases where their internecine quarrels
and dissensions threatened the security of his suzerainty. Their subordination
lasted as best it could, sometimes for a year or for ten years, at the end of which
period they would neglect the obligations of their vassalage, or openly refuse
to fulfil them : a revolt would then break out at one point or another, and it
was necessary to suppress it without delay to prevent the bad example from
spreading far and wide.^ The empire was maintained by perpetual re-conquests,
and its extent varied with the energy shown by its chiefs, or with the resources
which were for the moment available.
Separated from the confines of the empire by only a narrow isthmus, Egypt
loomed on the horizon, and appeared to beckon to her rival. Her natural
fertility, the industry of her inhabitants, the stores of gold and perfumes which
she received from the heart of Ethiopia, were well known by the passage to
and fro of her caravo,ns, and the recollection of her treasures must have fre
quently provoked the envy of Asiatic courts.^ Egypt had, however, strangely
declined from her former greatness, and the line of princes who governed her had
little in common with the Pharaohs who had rendered her name so formidable
under the XIP'‘ dynasty. She was now under the rule of the Xoites, whose
influence was probably confined to the Delta, and extended merely in name
over the Said and Nubia.^ The feudal lords, ever ready to reassert their
’ Cf. the account of the revolt of tlie kings of the valley of Siddim against Kudur-lagamar (pp. 48, 49 of the present work), which, if not absolutely accurate in every detail, gives nevertheless a very clear idea of what the Elamite or Chaldman rule meant in these early epochs; we shall come upon the same state of things later on at the time of the Egyptian conquest. ^ As we proceed, we shall continually meet indications, in letters written by Asiatic princes, of the existence of this idea that Egypt was a kind of El Dorado where gold was as plentiful as dust upon the high-road (Delatthe, Manages princiers en Egypte, in the Rev. des Quest, hist., vol. 1. p. 231). ® See what is said concerning the Xoites in Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 533, 534. I may recall the fact that Lepsius placed the Hyksus invasion first at the end of the XIE'‘ dynasty and then at the beginning of the XIII‘'“ (Kow'gshuch der Alten Algypter,p. 21, et seq.), and that his theory, at first adopted by Bunsen (ASgyptens Stelle in der Weltgeschichte, vol. iii. p. 9, et seq.), by Ijieblein (AUgypt. Chron., pp. C2-7C, and Recherehes sur la Chron. Egypt., pp. 84-135), was vigorously contested by E. de Rouge' {Examen de V Ouvrage de M. de Bunsen, ii. pp. 35-59). It has gradually been abandoned by most Egyptologists, and finally by Naville (2?«5astfs, pp. 15, 16). The history of the HyksOs has been dealt with by Chabas {Les Pasteurs en Egypte, 1868) in a special monograph, then by Padre Cesare di Cara (Gli Ilyhsos di Egitto, 1889), who collected with much care and discussed at great length all the references to them contained in the texts of ancient writers and in all the Egyptian documents; finally, Naville devotes a chapter in his Buhastis, pp. 16-29, to the history of the shepherd kings. Here, as in the preceding pages, the materials are so scanty that we are obliged to fall back on conjecture in endeavouring to interpret them and to work out the elements of a connected narrative; from the various hypotheses I have chosen those which appeared to be the simplest and best adapted to the scope of my work.



TEE E7KS0S INVASION. 51
independence as soon as tlie central power waned, shared between them the
possession of the Nile valley below Memphis : the princes of Thebes, who were
probably descendants of Usirtasen, owned the largest fiefdom, and though some
slight scruple may have prevented them from donning the pschent or placing
their names within a cartouche, they assumed notwithstanding the plenitude
of royal power. A favourable opportunity was therefore offered to an invader,
and the Chaldmans might have attacked with impunity a people thus divided
among themselves.^ They stopped short, however, at the southern frontier
of Syria, or if they pushed further forward, it was without any important
result : distance from head-quarters, or possibly reiterated attacks of the
Elamites, prevented them from placing in the field an adequate force for such
a momentous undertaking. What they had not dared to venture, others more
audacious were to accomplisli. At this juncture, so runs the Egyptian record,
“ there came to us a king named Timaios.^ Under this king, then, I know not
wherefore, the god caused to blow upon us a baleful wind, and in the face of
all probability bands from the East, people of ignoble race, came upon us
unawares, attacked the country, and subdued it easily and without fighting.” ^
It is possible that they owed this rapid victory to the presence in their armies
of a factor hitherto unknown to the African— the war-chariot —and before the
horse and his driver the Egyptians gave way in a body.^ The invaders appeared
* The theory that the divisions of Egypt, under the XIV''‘ dynasty, and the discords between its feudatory princes, were one of the main causes of the success of the Shepherds (Maspero, Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de VOrient, 4th edit., p. 162), is now admitted to be correct, amongst others, by Ed. Meyer, Geschichte Mgyptens, p. 201, et seq., and by Naville, Bubastis, pp. 19, 20. ^ Eruin emended rtij.7v Tijuaios in the text of Manetho into ' Aixev^ixalos or ’Ai^ev^nfis {Manethonis Sebennytee Reliq., pp. 53-55), and Lepsius first identified this new Amenemes with the last Pharaoli of the XII“‘ dynasty, AmenemhMt IV., then with the third king of the XIIP'‘, Ra-Amenemhait (Konigshuch, p. 24). Bunsen (JEgyptens Stelle, vol. iii. p. 42, note 5) suggests the emendation ’hfxovvTly.aios ; as the sole object of this is to identify the name of the king defeated by the shepherds with that of ’AfA.ov6dpTaios, mentioned by Eratosthenes, I do not think it worth accepting. We know too little of Manetho’s style to be able to decide a priori whether the phrase ’EyeVero ^aaiMhs rifliv Ti'ittaios ovopa ia or is not in harmony with his manner of narrating historical facts; the phrase is correct, and that should be enough to deter us from altering it, at any rate in our present stage of knowledge. ® Manetho, in Muller-Didot, Fragmenta Eistoricorum Grxcorum, vol. ii. p. 566. The apparent contradiction between the terms in which Manetho explains the conquest of Egypt, paSiws dp.axrj'r^ ravTi)v Kara Kpdros eiXov, has been noticed and explained by Feuin, Manetlionis Sehennytse Reliquise, p. 59 : Padre di Cara (Gli Eyltsos o Re Pastori di Egitto, p. 293, et seq.) sees in it a proof that the Hyksos had not been guilty of the atrocities of which the Egyptians accused them. * The horse was unknown, or at any rate had not been employed in Egypt prior to the invasion (cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 32, note 2); we find it, however, in general use immediately after the expulsion of the Shepherds, see the tomb of Pihiri (Champollion, Monuments de VEg^jpte et de la Nubie, pi. cxlv. 1, and vol. i. p. 268 ; Eosellini, Monumenti Civili, pi. cxvi. 5, vol. iii. pp. 238240; Lepsius, Denkmdler, iii. 10 a*"'®). Moreover, all historians agree in admitting that it was introduced into the country under the rule of the Shepherds (Prisse d’Ayennes, Des Chevaux cliez les Anciens Egyptiens,m Perron, Le Na^dri, vol. i. pp. 128-135; Fe. Lenormant, Les Premieres Civilisations, vol. i. pp. 299-305 ; Pietrement, Les Chevaux dans les temps anWiistoriques et historiques, p. 459, et seq.; Ed. Meyer, Geschichte JEgyptens, pp. 210, 211). The use of the war-chariot in Chaldsea at an epoch prior to the Hyksos invasion, is proved by a fragment of the Vulture Stele (cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 606, 607, 722) ; it is, therefore, natural to suppose that the Hyksos used the chariot in war, and that the rapidity of their conquest was due to it.



52 THE HYKSOS IN EGYPT.
as a cloud of locusts on the banks of the Nile. Towns and temples were alike
pillaged, burnt, and ruined ; they massacred all they could of the male popula
tion, reduced to slavery those of the women and children whose lives they spared,
and then proclaimed as king Salatis, one of their chiefs.^ He established a
semblance of regular government, chose Memphis as his capital, and imposed
a tax upon the vanquished.^ Two perils, however, immediately threatened the
security of his triumph : in the south the Theban lords, taking matters into
their own hands after the downfall of the Xoites, refused the oath of allegiance
to Salatis, and organised an obstinate resistance ;
^ in the north he had to take
measures to protect himself against an attack of the Chaldseans or of the
Elamites who were oppressing Chaldaea.^ From the natives of the Delta, who
were temporarily paralysed by their reverses, be had, for the moment, little to
fear : restricting himself, therefore, to establishing forts at the strategic points in
the Nile valley in order to keep the Thebans in check, he led the main body
of his troops to the frontier on the isthmus. Pacific immigrations had already
introduced Asiatic settlers into the Delta, and thus prepared the way for
securing the supremacy of the new rulers : in the midst of these strangers, and
on the ruins of the ancient town of Hawarit-Avaris,® in the Sethroite nome
* The name Salatis (var. Saites) seems to be derived from a Semitic word, ShalIt = “ the chief,” “ the governor ; ” this was the title which Joseph received when Pharaoh gave him authority over the whole of Egypt (Gen. xli. 43). Salatis may not, therefore, have been the real name of the first Hyksos king, but his title, which the Egyptians misunderstood, and from which they evolved a proper name : Uhlemann bus, indeed, deduced from this that Manetho, being familiar with the passage referring to Joseph, had forged the name of Salatis (Jsraeliten und Hylcsus in JEgypten, p. 76). Ebers imagined that he could decipher the Egyptian form of this prince’s name on the Colossus of Tell-Mokdiim {lEgypten und die Bucher Moses, p. 202 ; cf. Ed. Meyek, Set-Typhon, p. 56 ; Lauth, Aus JEgyptens Vorzeit, p. 229), where Naville has since read with certainty the name of a Pliaraoh of the XIIP'' and XIV'''' dynasties, Nahsiri {Le Roi Neliasi, ia the Reaueil de Travaux, vol. sv. pp.- 97-101). “ Manetho, in Muli.ee-Didot, Fragmenta Historicorum Grsecorum, vol. ii. pp. 566, 567. ^ The text of Manetho speaks of taxes which he imposed on the high and low lauds, riiv re avu Kul Kara which would Seem to include the Thebaid in the kingdom ; it is, however, stated in the next few pages that the successors of Salatis waged an incessant war against the Egyptians, which can only refer to hostilities against the Thebans. We are forced, therefore, to admit, either that Manetho took the title of lord of the high and low lands which belonged to Salatis, literally, or that the Thebans, after submitting at first, subsequently refused to pay tribute, thus provoking a war. * Manetho here speaks of Assyrians ; this is an error which is to be explained by the imperfect state of historical knowledge in Greece at the time of the Macedonian supremacy. We need not for this reason be led to cast doubt upon the historic value of the narrative (Wiedemann, Hlgyptische Geschichte, p. 298); we must remember the suzerainty which the kings of Babylon exercised oyer Syria (cf. p. 47, et seq., of the present work), and read Chaldxans where Manetho has written Assyrians. In Herodotus “ Assyria ” is the regular term fur “ Babylonia,” and Babylonia is called “ the land of the Assyrians ” (ii. 193). ^ The manuscripts of Josephus placed this town in the Saite nome ; this error of a copyist is easily corrected from the royal lists, where the Sethroite nome is indicated (Manetho, in Muller-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grxe., vol. ii. p. 567). The first commentators on Manetho placed Avaris on the site of Pelusium (Marsuam, Can. C/iron., Lipsiae, 1670, pp. 107, 108; Zoega, He Origine Obelise., pp. 577, 578), relying on the fact that Chaeremon (Fragm. 1, in Muller-Didot, Frag., vol. iii. p. 495) names Pelusium as the town which Manetho and Ptolemy of Mendes (Fragm. 1, in Muller-Didot, Frag., vol. iv. p. 485) call Avaris. Iiarcher identified it with Heroopolis, and Champollion (JYEgypte sous les Pharuons, vol. ii. pp. 87-92) endeavoured to support this view by evidence derived from Egyptian mythology ; finally Lepsius connected Avaris with the name of the Hebrews, and tried to make out that it had been occupied by that people during their sojourn in Egypt (fihron. der HSgypter, p. 341).



TEE ENTEENOEEE CAMP AT AVARI8. 53
a place connected by tradition with the myth of Osiris and Typhon— Salatis
constructed an immense entrenched camp, capable of sheltering two hundred
and forty thousand men. He visited it yearly to witness the military man
oeuvres, to pay his soldiers, and to preside over the distribution of rations. This
permanent garrison protected him from a Chaldsean invasion, a not unlikely
event as long as Syria remained under the supremacy of the Babylonian kings ;
it furnished his successors also with an inexhaustible supply of trained soldiers,
thus enabling them to complete the conquest of Lower Egypt. Years elapsed
before the princes of the south would declare themselves vanquished, and five
kings —Bnon, Apachnas, Apophis I., lannas, and Asses—-passed their lifetime
“ in a perpetual warfare, desirous of tearing up Egypt to the very root.” ^ These
Theban kings, who were continually under arms against the barbarians, were sub
sequently classed in a dynasty by themselves, the of Manetho, but they at
last succumbed to the invader, and Asses became master of the entire country.
His successors in their turn formed a dynasty, the XVI“', the few remaining
monuments of which are found scattered over the length and breadth of the
valley from the shores of the Mediterranean to the rocks of the first cataract.^
The Egyptians who witnessed the advent of this Asiatic people called
The hieroglyphic name for the town of Tauis was added by Champollion {Bict. p, 116); then E. de Eouge read it as “Zan,” which seemed to confirm the assimilation theory ; then the same scholar discovered the true reading, Hawarit, and at once proposed to recognise in this name the original of Avaris, while still continuing to identify the site with that of Tanis (Summary of a lecture : see the Atli€nxum Frangais, 1854, p. 532). This conjecture found general acceptance, but doubts were expressed in regard to the identity of the two cities, and it was rightly pointed out that in the text of Manetho Avaris is described as an entrenched camp. Lepsius, returning to the old theory, proposed to look for the site in the environs of Pelusium (Koniggbuch, p. 45, note 1), and was not long in locating it among the ruins of Tell-Her, the name of which city would probably bo derived from that of Hawaret (Entdecltung eines bilingues Dekretes, in the Zeitschrift, 1866, pp. 31, 32). Ebers (JDurch Gosen, etc., pp. 73,74) recognised even_Pelusium,and consequently Avaris, in Tell-Her. This hypothesis, approved by Chabas (Les Pasteurs en Egypte, p. 42), does not seem to be in favour at present; the only person who appears to support it is Padre di Cara (Gli Hylcsos, p. 332, et seq.). Hawarit is placed either at Tanis (Bhugsch, Beitrdge iiber Tanis, in the Zeitschrift, 1872, pp. 19, 20, Diet, g^og., pp. 143, 144), or in the neighbourhood of Daphnte (Ed. Meyek, Gesch. JEgyptens, p. 207), or at Migdol Tell-es-Semtit (Brugsch, Die Mgyptologie, p. 36). * None of these five kings have left monuments which can be identified with certainty, unless, indeed, we agree with Naville in supposing that Khiani (cf pp. 59, 60 of the present work) represents Annas or lannas (JBubastis, pp. 23-26). De've'ria {Lettre a M. Auguste Mariette, etc., in the Revue Arch^ol,
1861, vol. iv. pp. 253-256) thought he could recognise three of them —Bnon, Apakhnas, and Apophis in the three half-effaced names on fragment No. 112 of the royal canon at Turin (Lepsius, Auswahl, etc., pi. viii.) ; he connected fragment No. 150, on which he made out tlie name of the god Sit, with the same series. His hypothesis was accepted by Pleyte (La Religion des Prd-lsraelites, p. 35), and Lauth, who had made the same suggestion almost simultaneously with Deveria, added to the two fragments 112150 fragment 144, on which he thought he could decijiher traces of the name Salatis (Manetho und der Turiner Konigspapyrus, p. 247) ; the theory is now only accepted with large reserves. Lauth had also found the name of Bnon on the Saltier Papyrus, No. 1, pi. ii. 1. 7, but Erman proved that in this passage
the correct reading was Ati = sovereign,” and not a proper name at all (Varia, in the Zeitschrift, 1877, p. 37). Finally, Erman, in the same article in which he pointed out Lauth’s mistake, proposed to recognise Apakhnas in the Sit-apahiti Nubiti of the stele of the year 400 (Ibid., p. 37) ; it appears to me, however, that this refers not to a mortal king, but to the god Sit, described by his ethnical title Nubiti, the man of Ombos, and considered as king of the divine dynasties. “ Monuments of Susirniri Khiani and of Ausirri Apopi II. at Gebelein, in Daressy, Notes et llemarqites, §§ xxx., Ixxxviii., in the Recueil de Travaux, vol, xiv. p. 26; xvi. p. 42.

them by the general term Amuu, Asiatics,^ or Monatiu, the men of the desert.^
They had already given the Bedouin the opprobrious epithet of Shausu
pillagers or robbers — which aptly described them ;
^ and they subsequently
applied the same name to the intruders—^Hiq Shausu—from which the Greeks
derived their word Hyksos, or Hykoussos, for this people.^ But we are without
any clue as to their real name, language, or origin. The writers of classical
times were unable to come to an agreement on these questions: some con
founded the Hyksos with the Phoenicians, others regarded them as Arabs.®
‘ Goleniscueff, Notice sur un texte de Stahl-Antar, in the Becueil, vol. iii. pp. 2, 3, and vol. vii. pi. i. 1. 37. Ed. Meyer thinks that these princes extended their rule over a part of Syria; he points out in this connection, though he admits the hypothesis to he a bold one, the identity of date established by the Jewish chronicler {Numh. xiii. 22) for the foundations of Tanis and Hebron (Gesch. JEgypt., p. 210). ^ The meaning of the term Moniti was discovered by E. de Rouge, who translated it Shepherd, and applied it to the Hyksos {Examen de VOmrage de M. de Bunsen, vol. ii. pp. 41, 42; Me'm. sur V Inscrip. d’Ahmes, p. 171); from thence it passed into the works of all the Egyptologists who concerned themselves with this question (Beugsch, JEgijpt. Stud., vol. ii. pp. 19, 20, and Gesch. ASgypt., pp. 217, 218; Chabas, Melanges Egyptolog., 1st series, pp. 33-35, and Les Pasteurs en Egypte, pp. 24, 25), hut Shepherd has not been universally accepted as the meaning of the word. It is generally agreed that it was a generic term, indicating the races with which their conquerors were supposed to be connected, and not the particular term of which Manetho’s word Uoi'iuei'es would be the literal translation. “ The name seems, in fact, to be derived from a word which meant “to rob,” “to pillage.” The name Shausu, Shosu, was not used by the Egyptians to indicate a particular race. It was used of all Bedouins, and in general of all the marauding tribes who infested the desert or the mountains. The Shausu most frequently referred to on the monuments are those from the desert between Egypt and Syria, but there is a reference, in the time of Ramses II., to those from the Lebanon and the valley of Orontes. Krall finds an allusion to them in a word (^Shosini) in Judges ii. 14, which is generally translated by a generic expression, “tlie spoilers” {Studien zur Geschichte des Alten AEgypjtens II., aus demotischen Vrhunden, p. 69). * Maiietho (Mullee-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grxc., vol. ii. p. 567) declares that the people were called Hyksos, from Eyh, which means “ king ” in the sacred language, and sos, which means “shepherd” in the popular language. As a matter of fact, the word Ilijhu means “prince” in the classical language of Egypt, or, as Manetho styles it, the sacred language, i.e. in the idiom of the old religious, historical, and literary texts, which in later ages the populace no longer understood. Shos, on the contrary, belongs to the spoken language of the later time, and does not occur in the ancient inscriptions, so that Blanetho’s explanation is valueless ; there is but one material fact to he retained from his evidence, and that is the name Ilylc-Shos or Ilyhu-Shus given by its inventors to the alien kings. Champollion {Lettres a 31. de Blacas, relatives au 3lus€e Royal de Turin, ATM Lettre, p. 57) and Roselliui {3Ionumeuti Storici,yo\. i. pp. 175-178) were the first to identify these Shos with the Shaush whom they found represented on the monuments, and their opinion, adopted by some (Beugsch, Uistoire d’Egypte,p. 77, and Geschichte Mgyptens,p. 216; Wiedemann, Geschichte, pp. 288, 289; Ed. BIeyee, Geschichte AEgyptens, p. 205), contested by others (Chabas, Bldlanges Egyptologiques, 1st series, p. 33, and Voyage d’un Egyptien, p. 116), seems to me an extremely plausible one : the Egyptians, at a given moment, bestowed the generic name of Shaush on these strangers, just as they had given those of Amuu and Monatiu. The texts or writers from whom Manetho drew his information evidently mentioned certain kings /tyga-Shahsh ; other passages, or the same passages wrongly interpreted, were applied to the race, and were rendered hyliu-Sha,usti = “ the prisoners taken from the Shatisu,” a substantive derived from the root halca = “ to take ” being substituted for the noun 7i?/gu = “ prince.” Josephus (Contra Apionem, i. 14) declares, on the
authority of Manetho, that some manuscripts actually suggested this derivation —a fact which is easily explained by the custom of the Egyptian record offices (Kkall, Stud, zur Gesch. der Alien Mgyptens II., aus demot. Urh., p. 69). I may mention, in passing, that Mariette (Extrait d’un M^moire intitule; Questions relatives aux nouvelles fouilles a faire en Egypte, p. 41) recognised in the element “Sos”
au Egyptian word shos = “ soldiers,” and in the name of King Mirmashaft, which he read Mirshosu, an equivalent of the title Hyq-Shosu (cf. BIaspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 531-533, in regard to Blirmashau). ® Manetho (BIullee-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grxc., Vol. ii. p. 567) takes them to be Phoenicians,



THEIR UNCERTAIN ORIGIN. 55
Modern scholars have put forward at least a dozen contradictory hypotheses
on the matter. The Hyksos have been asserted to have been Canaanites/
Elamites/ Hittites/ Accadians, Scythians.^ The last opinion found great
favour with the learned, as long as they could believe that the sphinxes dis
covered by Mariette represented Apophis or one of his predecessors. As a
matter of fact, these monuments present all the characteristics of the Mongoloid
type of countenance—the small and slightly oblique eyes, the arched but some
what flattened nose, the pronounced cheek-bones and well-covered jaw, the
salient chin and full lips slightly depressed at the corners.® These peculiarities
are also observed in the three heads found at Damauhur,® in the colossal
torso dug up at Mit-Fares in the Fayum,'^ in the twin figures of the Nile
removed to the Bulaq Museum from Tanis,® and upon the remains of a

Brugsch favours this latter view {Geschichte JEgyptens, pp. 214-217), but tlie Arab legend of a conquest of Egypt by Sheddad and the Adites is of recent origin, and was inspired by traditions in regard to the Hyksos current during the Byzantine epoch ; we cannot, therefore, allow it to influence us (Wiedemann, ASgyptische GeschieMe, p. 288). We must wait before expressing a defluite opinion in regard to the facts wliich Glaser believes he has obtained from the Minsean inscriptions which date from the time of the Hyksos. * The theory of the Cananseo-Kushite origin has been defended by Lepsius (Nuh. Gram. Einleitung, pp. cxiii.-cxv.) and by Maspero (Hist. Ana. des Peuples de V Orient, 4th edit., pp. 161, 162), who base their argument on the tradition that the Plia3nicians came from the shores of the Erythrman Sea (cf. infra, pp. 62-64), and on the Phoenician origin attributed to the Shepherd kings by one of Manetho’s authorities ; cf. Ed. Meyer, Gescli. Algypt., p. 206, and G. Steindoeee, Zur GeschieMe der Hyksos, pp. 3-7. * Ed. Meyer, Gesch. des Alterth., vol. i. pp. 166, 167 ; he has since rejected this view (Gesch.

Lenoemant, Manuel de VHistoire Ancienne des Peuples de V Orient, 3rd edit., vol. i. p. 365). Later on Hamy imagined that he could distinguish traces of Mongolian influences, and Fr.

THE EYES OS IN EGYPT.

type of face is also found to exist among" the present inhabitants of the
villages scattered over the eastern part of the Delta, particularly on the
shores of Lake Menzaleh, and the conclusion was drawn that these people
were the direct descendants of the Hyksosd This theory was abandoned,
however, when it was ascertained that the sphinxes of San had been
carved, many centuries before the invasion, for Amenemhait III.,^ a king of
the dynasty. In spite of the facts we possess, the problem therefore
still remains unsolved, and the origin of the Hyksos is as mysterious as ever.
We gather, however, that the third millennium before our era was repeatedly
disturbed by considerable migratory movements. The expeditions far afield of
Elamite and Chaldsean princes could not have taken place without seriously
perturbing the regions over which they passed. They must have encountered
by the way many nomadic or unsettled tribes whom a slight shock would easily
displace. An impulse once given, it needed but little to accelerate or increase
the movement : a collision with one horde reacted on its neighbours, who either
displaced or carried others with them, and the whole multitude, gathering
momentum as they went, were precipitated in the direction first given.® A
tradition, picked up by Herodotus on his travels, relates that the Phoenicians
had originally peopled the eastern and southern shores of the Persian Gulf ;
^ it
was also said that Indathyrses, a Scythian king, had victoriously scoured the
whole of Asia, and had penetrated as far as Egypt.® Either of these invasions
may have been the cause of the Syrian migration. In comparison with the
meagre information which has come down to us under the form of legends, it
is provoking to think how much actual fact has been lost, a tithe of which
would explain the cause of the movement and the mode of its execution.
The least improbable hypothesis is that which attributes the appearance of
the Shepherds about the XXIIF® century B.C., to the arrival in Naharaim
of those Khati wlio subsequently fought so obstinately against the ar-mies
both of tlie Pharaohs and the Ninevite kings. They descended from the
' Maiuette, Lettre a M. le Vicomte de Rougd sur las fouilles de Tunis, pp. 10, 11, and Note sur les Biahmites et les Baschmourites, in the Melanges d’Archdologie Egyftienne et Assyrienne, vol. i. pp. 91-93. ^ Golenischefp, Amencmhd 111 et les Sphinx de San, in the Recueil de Travaux,\o\. xv. pp. 13113G ; cf.

Hist. Grxc., vol. ii. p. 416; cf. Strabo, 1, § 6, p. 687, and Arrianus, Indica, v. § 6; Justikus, i. 1. A certain number of commentators are of opinion that the wars attributed to Indathyrses have been confounded with what Herodotus tells of the exploits of Madyes (IV. ciii., et seq.), and are nothing more than a distorted remembrance of the great Scythian invasion which took place in the latter half of the VI1“' century b.c.



PROBABLE IDENTIFICATION WITH THE KHATI. 57
mountain region in which the Halys and the Euphrates take their rise,
and if the bulk of them proceeded no further than the valleys
of the Taurus and the Amanos, some at least must have pushed
forward as far as the provinces on the western shores of the Dead
Sea. The most adventurous among them, reinforced by the Canaanites
and other tribes who had joined them on their southward course,
crossed the isthmus of Suez, and finding a people weakened by
discord, experienced no difficulty in replacing the native dynasties
by their own barbarian chiefsd Both their name and origin were
doubtless well known to the Egyptians, but the latter nevertheless
disdained to apply to them any term but that of “ shemau,’’^ strangers,
and in referring to them used the same vague appellations which
they applied to the Bedouin of the Sinaitic peninsula,— Monatiu, the
shepherds, or Satin, the archers. They succeeded in hiding the
original name of their conquerors so thoroughly, that in the end they
themselves forgot it, and kept the secret of it from posterity.
The remembrance of the cruelties with which the invaders sullied
their conquest lived long after them ; it still stirred the anger of
Manetho after a lapse of twenty centuries.^ The victors were known as
the “ Plagues ” or “ Pests,”^ and every possible crime and impiety was
attributed to them. But the brutalities attending the invasion once
past, the invaders soon lost their barbarity and became rapidly civi
lized. Those of them stationed in the encampment at Avaris retained a hyksos
the military qualities and characteristic energy of their race
the remainder became assimilated to their new compatriots, and were soon
' Mariette, Aferqu de V Histoire de VEqypte, 1874, pp. 49-54, 172-175, deliberately committed himself to this view, and Padre Cesaee di Cara, Gli Hyksos di Egitto, has written in support of it. At the present time, those scholars who admit the Turanian origin of the Hyksos are of opinion that only the nucleus of the race, the royal tribe, was composed of Mongols, while the main body consisted of
elements of all kinds— Canaanitish, or, more generally, Semitic (Naville, Buhastis, pp. 18, 28). “ The term shamamu, variant of shemau, is applied to them by Queen Hatshopsitu (Goleniscueff, Notice sur un tezte de Stabl-Antar, in the Recueil, vol. iii. p. 3) : the same term is employed shortly afterwards by Thutmosis III., to indicate the enemies whom he had defeated at Megiddo (Brugsch, Recueil de Mon., vol. i. pi. xliii. 1. 1, where the text is defective). “ He speaks of them in contemptuous terms as men of ignoble race, avdpa-Kot to ytfos aoripot (Moller-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grxe., vol. ii. p. 566). ^ The epithet AUi, laiti, laditi, was applied to the Nubians by the writer of the inscription of Ahmosi-si-Abina (1. 21), and to the Shepherds of tlie Delta by the author of the Saltier Papyrus, No. 1, pi. 1, 1. 1. Brugsch explained it as “the rebels,” or “ disturbers ”. (Algypt. Stud., § ii. p. 10),
and Goodwin translated it “invaders” (Hier. Pap., in the Camb. Essays, 1858, p. 243); Chabas rendered it by “ plague-stricken,” an interpretation which was in closer conformity with its etymological meaning {Mel. Egyptolog., 1st series, pp. 35-41), and Groff pointed out that the malady called Ait, or Adit in Egyptian, is the malignant fever still frequently to be met with at the present day in the marshy cantons of the Delta, and furnished the proper rendering, which is “The Feverstricken” {Btudes Areh^olog.: la Malaria). ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by M. de Mertens.

Their sovereigns seem to have realised from the first that it was more to
their interest to exploit the country than to pillage it ; as, however, none of
them was competent to understand the intricacies of the treasury, they
were forced to retain the
services of the majority
of the scribes, who had
managed the public ac

kiugs.^ Once schooled
to the new state of affairs,
they readily adopted the
refinements of civilized
life. The court of the
Pharaohs, with its pomp
and its usual assemblage
of officials, both great
and small, was revived around the person of the new sovereign ;
^ the titles of
the Amenemhaits and the Usirtasens, adapted to these “princes of foreign
lands,” ^ legitimatised them as descendants of Horus and sons of the Sun.®
They respected the local religions, and went so far as to favour those of the gods
whose attributes appeared to connect them with some of their own barbarous
divinities. The chief deity of their worship was Baal, the lord of all,® a cruel and'

Meyer, Geschichte .Egyptens, p. 219, note 2); his is the second figure on the right, holding tlie hilts of the plough. ’ The narrative of the Saltier Papyrus, No. 1, shows us the civil and military chiefs collected round the Shepherd-king ApOpi, and escorting him in the solemn processions in honour of the gods (pi. i. 1. 4). They are followed by the scribes and magicians, who give him advice on important occasions (pi. ii. 1. 2). * Hiqu Situ : this is the title of Abisha at Beni-Hassan (cf. Maspeuo, D. of Civiliz., p. 468), which is also assumed by Khiani on several small monuments (cf. Petrie, Hist. Scarabs, pi. 25, No. 729); Steindorff (Zur Gesch. der Hyksos, pp. 4, 5) has attempted to connect it with the name of the Hyksos. ^ The preamble of the two or three Shepherd-kings of whom we know anything, contains tlie two cartouches, the special titles, and the names of Horus, which formed part of the title of the kings of pure Egyptian race; thus Apophis II. is proclaimed to be the living Horus, ivho joins the two earths in peace, the good god, Aqnunri, son of the Sun, Apopi, who lives for ever, on the statues of Mirraashau, which he had appropriated (E. and .1. de Hodge, Inscrip, hidrogl. en Egypte, pi. Ixxvi., where the proper name has been misread), and on the pink granite table of offerings in the Gizeh Museum (Mariette, Notice des Princip. Mon., 1876, p. 299, No. 1001, and Mon. divers, pi. 38,
pp. 10, 11). ^ The name of Baal, transcribed Ba&lu, is found on that of a certain Petebadlu, “ the Gift of Baal,” who must have flourished in the time of the last shepherd-kings, or rather under the Theban kings of the XVIP'' dynasty, who were their contemporaries (Lieblein, Becherches sur la Ghronologie Egyptienne, pp. 129-182, whose conclusions have been adopted by Brugsch, Gesch. AUgypt., pp. 238, 239).

sented as a fully armed warrior,
wearing a helmet of circidar form,
ornamented with two plumes ; but
he also borrowed the emblematic
animal of Sit, the fennec, and the

deserts of the Thebaid.^ His
temples were erected in the cities
of the Delta, side by side with
the sanctuaries of the feudal gods,
both at Bubastis * and at Tanis.® Tanis, now made the capital, reopened
its palaces, and acquired a fresh impetus from the royal presence within
its walls. Apophis Aqnunri,® one of its kings, dedicated several tables of
offerings in that city, and engraved his cartouches upon the sphinxes and
standing colossi of the Pharaohs of the XIP^ and XIIP‘' dynasties. He was,
however, honest enough to leave the inscriptions of his predecessors intact,
and not to appropriate to himself the credit of works belonging to the
Amenemhaits or to MirmashM."^ Khiani, who is possibly the lannas of

of the conquerors’ god —a transliteration of the Phoenician Sydyk, and would only see in it that of the nearest Egyptian deity.

Manetho, was not, however, so easily satisfied.^ The
statue bearing his inscription, of which the lower part

have been really carved for himself or for one of
his contemporaries. It is a work possessing
no originality, though of very commend
able execution, such as would render it
acceptable to any museum ; the artist
who conceived it took his inspiration
with considerable cleverness from the
best examples turned out by the schools of the Delta under the Sovkhotpus and
the Nofirhotpus. But a small grey granite lion, also of the reign of Khiani,
which by a strange fate had found its way to Bagdad, does not raise our estima
tion of the modelling of animals in the Hyksos period. It is heavy in form,
and the muzzle in no way recalls the fine profile of the lions executed by the
sculptors of earlier times. The pursuit of science and the culture of learning
appear to have been more successfully perpetuated than the fine arts ; a treatise

Mr. Petrie proposed to read Khian, Khiani, and the fragment discovered at Gebelein confirms this reading (Dakessy, Notes et Remarques, in the Itecueil, vol. xvi. p. 42, § Ixxxviii.), as well as a certain number of cylinders and scarabs (Pi.. Petrie, Hist. Scarabs, pi. 25). Mr. Petrie prefers to place this Pharaoh in the VHP'' dynasty {Hist, of Egypt, vol. i. pp. 117-121), and makes him one of the leaders in the foreign occupation to which he supposes Egypt to have submitted at that time (as to this point, cf. JlAsrERO, Urmm o/ CiDiVizotfon, pp. 440, 441) ; but it is almost certain that he ought to be placed among the Hyksos of the XVP'' dimasty (Steindorpf, Zur Gesch. der Hyksos, pp. 4, 5).

Smith, who believed he could detect on it the name of Salatis {Assyrian Discoveries, p. 420). Mr. Tomkins made a new drawing of it, and published it in his Studies on the Times of Abraham, pi. xi. pp. 140-142. The discovery of the true reading of the cartouche, Susirniii, and its identification with the cartouche-prenomen of Khiani, are due to Griffith (Naville, Bubastis, pp. 24, 25). Ed. Meyer {Geschichte des Alterthums, vol. i. p. 136) considers this lion not to bo Egyptian work at all, but pseudo-Egyptian, and that it was executed in Asia; the head, which had been mutilated, has been restored at a much later date, and has thus lost its ancient character, but the body shows it to have been of pure Egyptian origin. “ The cartouche-name Ausirri, which is only to be found in the papyrus, was pointed out by Birch {Geometric Papyrus, in the Zeitschrift, 1868, p. 109), who did not classify it; Eisenlohr recognised the fact that it must date from the time of the XVIP'' dynasty {Ueber altdgyptische Maasse, in the Zeitschrift, 1876, p. 44, and Ein Mathematisches Handbuch der Alten HUgypter, pp. 7, 8), and



THE MONUMENTS OF EHIANL
If we only possessed more monuments or documents treating of this period,
we should doubtless perceive that their sojourn on the banks of the Nile
was instrumental in causing a speedy change in the appearance and character
of the Hyksos. The
strangers retained to a
certain extent their
coarse countenances and
rude manners : they
showed no aptitude for
tilling the soil or sowing
grain, but delighted in
the marshy expanses of
the Delta, where they
gave themselves up to
a semi-savage life of
hunting and of tending
cattle. The nobles
among them, clothed and
schooled after the Egyp
tian fashion, and holding
fiefs, or positions at court,
differed but little from
the native feudal chiefs.

which by a stroke of fortune they may have conquered : as soon as the Hyksos

were all but transformed into Egyptians.

02 THE HYKSoS IN EG YPT.
the attraction which she possessed for them must have increased in inten
sity under the shepherds. They would now find the country in the hands of
men of the same races as themselves—Egyptiauised, it is true, but not to such
an extent as to have completely lost their own language and the knowledge of
their own extraction. Such immigrants were the more readily welcomed,
since there lurked a feeling among the Hyksos that it was necessary to
strengthen themselves against the slumbering hostility of the indigenous
population. The royal palace must have more than once opened its gates to
Asiatic counsellors and favourites. Canaanites and Bedouin must often have
been enlisted for the camp at Avaris. Invasions, famines, civil wars, all seem
to have conspired to drive into Egypt not only isolated individuals, but whole
families and tribes. That of the Beni-Israel, or Israelites, who entered the
country about this time, has since acquired a unique position in the world’s
history. They belonged to that family of Semitic extraction which we know
by the monuments and tradition to have been scattered in ancient times along
the western shores of the Persian Gulf and on the banks of the Euphrates.
Those situated nearest to Chaldsea and to the sea probably led a settled exist
ence ; they cultivated the soil, they employed themselves in commerce and
industries, their vessels—from Dilmun, from Magan, and from Milukhkha
coasted from one place to another, and made their way to the cities of
Sumer and Accad. They had been civilized from very early times, and some
of their towns were situated on islands, so as to be protected from sudden
incursions.* Other tribes of the same family occupied the interior of the con
tinent ; they lived in tents, and delighted in the unsettled life of nomads.
There appeared to be in this distant corner of Arabia an inexhaustible reserve
of population, which periodically overflowed its borders and spread over the
world. It was from this very region that we see theKashdim, the true Chaldaeans,
issuing ready armed for combat, — a people whose name was subsequently used
to denote several tribes settled between the lower waters of the Tigris and the
Euphrates.^ It was there, among the marshes on either side of these rivers,
that the Aramreans established their first settlements after quitting the desert.^
There also the oldest legends of the race placed the cradle of the Phoenicians ;
^
it was even believed, about the time of Alexander, that the earliest ruins
attributable to this people had been discovered on tlie Bahrein Islands, the
* E.g. the ancieut town of Dilmun (Fr.

Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies ? p. 134, et seq. ^ The Assyrian inscriptions show that there were Aramoeans in this region also (Fii. Delitzsch, IFo lag das Paradies ^ pp. 257, 258). The tendency to trace all the Aramseans who settled in Syria to the marshy regions which border on the lower Euphrates has become very pronounced of late; cf., amongst others, IIalevy, Melanges, pp. 29-31 ; Becherclies Bib., pp. 57, 58, 165, 287, 288 ; and Renan, Ilist. du Peuple d'lsravl, vol. i. p. 10.

largest of which, Tylos and Arados, bore names resembling the two great ports
of Tyre and Arvadd We are indebted to tradition for the cause of their emigra
tion and the route by which they reached the Mediterranean. The occurrence
of violent earthquakes forced them to leave their home ; they travelled as
far as the Lake of Syria, where they halted for some time; then resuming their
march, did not rest till they had reached the sea, where they founded Sidon.^
The question arises as to the position of the Lake of Syria on whose shores
they rested, some believing it to be the Bahr-i-Nedjif and the environs of
Babylon;^ others, the Lake of Bambykes near the Euphrates,^ the emigrants
doubtless having followed up the course of that river, and having approached
the country of their destination on its north-eastern frontier. Another
theory would seek to identify the lake with the waters of Merom, the Lake
of Galilee, or the Dead Sea ; in this case the horde must have crossed the
neck of the Arabian peninsula, from the Euphrates to the Jordan, through
one of those long valleys, sprinkled with oases, which afforded an occasional
route for caravans.® Several writers assure us that the Phoenician tradition of
this exodus was misunderstood by Herodotus, and that the sea which they
remembered on reaching Tyre was not the Persian Gulf, but the Dead Sea. If
this had been the case, they need not have hesitated to assign their departure
to causes mentioned in other documents. The Bible tells us that, soon
after the invasion of Kudur-lagamar, the anger of God being kindled by the
wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah, He resolved to destroy the five cities
situated in the valley of Siddim. A cloud of burning brimstone broke over
them and consumed them ; when the fumes and smoke, as “ of a furnace,” had
passed away, the very site of the towns had disappeared.® Previous to their
destruction, the lake into which the Jordan empties itself had had but a re
stricted area : the subsidence of the southern plain, which had been occupied
by the impious cities, doubled the size of the lake, and enlarged it to its present
* Strabo, xvi. 3, § 4, p. 766, according to the missing narrative of Androsthenes, one of
Alexander’s admirals. A place on the Persian Gulf named Dora (Strabo, s. v.) is also mentioned it was known to Ptolemy (vi. 7) by the name of Tharo, @a.pw. “ JusTiNus, xviii., iii. 2-4 : “ Tyriorum gens condita a Phcenicibus fuit, qui terrse motu vexati relicto patrise solo ad Syrium stagnum primo, mox mari proximum litus ineoluerunt, condita ibi urbe, quam a piscium ubertate Sidona appellaverunt : nam pisces Pboenices sfdow vocant.” The ancient editions read “ Assyrium stagnum primo, mox mari proximum litus ineoluerunt.” ’ G. Eawlinson, Herod., vol. iv. p. 201, and Hist, of Phoenicia, pp. 53, 54, from the reading “Assyrium.” * A. VON Gutschmid, Beitrdge zur Geschiclite des Alien Orients, p. 36, note. Gutsebmid afterwards abandoned this view (Phoenicia, in the Encyclopedia Britannicu, 9th edit., vol. xviii. p. 803 B ; cf. Eleine Schri/ten, vol. ii. pp. 41, 42, 86, 87). They would thus have arrived at the shores of Lake Merom (Hitzig, Urgeseh. der Philistxer, pp. 181-184), or at the shores either of the Dead Sea or of the Lake of Gennesareth (Kenrick, Phoenicia, Tg. 47); the Arab traditions speak of an itinerary which would have led the emigrants across the desert (C. de Perceval, Histoire des Arahes, vol. i. p. 38, et seq.), but they possess no historic value in so far as these early epochs are concerned (Noldeke, Ueber die Amaleldter, p. 34). “ Gen. xix, 24-29 ; the whole of this episode belongs to the Jehovistic narrative.

dimensions.^ The earthquake which caused the Phoenicians to leave their
ancestral home may have been the result of this cataclysm, and the sea on
whose shores they sojourned would thus be our Dead Sea. One fact, however,
appears to be certain in the midst of many hypotheses, and that is that the
Phoenicians had their origin in the regions bordering on the Persian Gulf.^
It is useless to attempt, with the inadequate materials as yet in our possession,
to determine by what route they reached the Syrian coast, though we may
perhaps conjecture the period of their arrival. Herodotus asserts that the
'J’yrians placed the date of the foundation of their principal temple two thou
sand three hundred years before the time of his visit,® and the erection of a
sanctuary for their national deity would probably take place very soon after
their settlement at Tyre : this would bring their arrival there to about the
XX VHP’' century before our era. The Elamite and Babylonian conquests
would therefore have found the Phoenicians already established in the country,
and would have had appreciable effect upon them.
The question now arises whether the Beni-Israel belonged to the group of
tribes which included the Phoenicians, or whether they were of Chaldsean race.
Their national traditions leave no doubt upon that point. They are regarded
as belonging to an important race, which we find dispersed over the country of
Padan-Aram, in Northern Mesopotamia, near the base of Mount Masios, and
extending on both sides of the Euphrates.^ Their earliest chiefs bore the names
of towns or of peoples,—Nakhor, Peleg, and Serug : ^ all were descendants of
Arphaxad,® and it was related that Terakh, the direct ancestor of the Israelites,
had dwelt in Ur-Kashdim, the Ur or Uru of the Chaldaeans.'^ He is said to have
' Tlio theory which endeavours to prove that the southern part of the Dead Sea was originally a jilaiu covered with cities, has been vigorously opposed by Lartet (Due de Luynes, Voyage d’ Exploration a la liter Morte, vol. iii. p. 241, et seq. ; cf. Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 177-179). = This opinion was, 1 believe, first put forward by Bunsen (^p. Stelle,\o\.\y. pp. 291, 292); at first rejected by Gutsehmid {Gesch. dus Alien Orients, pp. 26, 27), was afterwards accepted by him (Kleine Schri/t.,yo\. ii. pp. 41,42,86,87), and from him passed into Pietschmann, Ges.derPhonizier,pp. 114-116. ^ Heuouotus, II. xliv. ; cf. WTeuemaxn’s commentary on Herodots zweites Buck, pp. 207-211. ^ The country of Padan-Aram is situated between the Euphrates and the upper reaches of the
Khabur, on both sides of the Balikh, and is usually explained as the “ plain ” or “ table-land ” of Aram, thougli the etj mology is not certain ; the word seems to be preserved in that of Tell-Faddan, near llarran. ^ NakhOr has been associated with the ancient vdlage of Khaura, or with the ancient village of Haditha-en-Naura, to the south of Anah ; Peleg probably corresponds with Phalga or Phaliga, which was situated at the mouth of the Khabur ; Serug with the present Sarudj in the neighbourliood of
Edessa, and the other names in the genealogy were probably borrowed from as many different localities. “ The site of Arphaxad is doubtful, as is also its meaning : its second element is undoubtedly the
name of the Chaldieans, but the first is interpreted in several ways— “ frontier of the Chaldmaus,” “ domain of the Chaldajans.” The similarity of sound was the cause of its being for a long time
associated with the Arrapakhitis ot classical times; the tendency is now to recognise in it the country nearest to the ancient domain of the Chaldceans, t.e. Babylonia proper (Pit. Delitzsch, TFo
lag das Paradiesi pp. 264, 265; Schuaueb, Die Keilinschriften, 1888, pp. 112, 113; Budde, Die Bib.
Vrgesch., p. 444, note). ^ Ur-Kashdim has long been sought for in the north, either at Orfa, in accordance with the
tradition of the Syrian Churches still existing in the East, or in a certain Ur of Mesopotamia, placed
by Ammianus Marcellinus (xxxv. 8, 7) between Nisibis and the Tigris (cf. for a very clear summary of these early opinions, Vigouroux, La Bible et les D^oouvertes modernes, 1884, vol. i. pp. 33o—394)>



THE MIGBATION OF THE ISRAELITES FROM CHALDEA INTO SYRIA. 65
had three sons —Abraham, Nakhor, and Haran. Haran begat Lot, but died
before his father in Ur-Kashdim, his own country ; Abraham and Nakhor both
took wives, but Abraham’s wife remained a long time barren. Then Terakh,
with his son Abraham, his grandson Lot, the son of Haran, and his daughter
in-law Sarah,^ went forth from Ur-Kashdim (Ur of the Chaldees) to go into
the land of Canaan ; and they came unto Kharan, and dwelt there, and
Terakh died in Kharan.^ It is a question whether Kharan is to be identified ,
with Harran in Mesopotamia, the city of the god Sin ; or, which is more pro
bable, with the Syrian town of Hauran,^ in the neighbourhood of Damascus.^
The tribes who crossed the Euphrates became subsequently a somewhat im
portant people. They called themselves, or were known by others, as the ‘Ibrim,
or Hebrews, the people from beyond the river and this appellation, which we
are accustomed to apply to the children of Israel only, embraced also, at the
time when the term was most extended, the Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites,
Ishmaelites, Midianites, and many other tribes settled on the borders of the
desert to the east and south of the Dead Sea.*^ These peoples all traced their
descent from Abraham, the son of Terakh, but the children of Israel claimed the
privilege of being the only legitimate issue of his marriage with Sarah, giving
naive or derogatory accounts of the relations which connected the others with
at the present day Hale'vy still looks for it on the Syrian bank of the Euphrates, to the south-east of Thapsaous {Mdanges d’Epigraphie et d’ Arch^ologie S^mitiques, p. 84, and Recherch.es Bibliques, p. 715, note 1). Kawlinson’s proposal to identify it with the town of Uru has been successively accepted by nearly all Assyriologists ; by Oppert {Les Inscriptions de Dur-Sarkayan, in Place’s Ninive et I’Assyrie, vol. ii. p. 289, note 1), by Schrader (Die Keilinschriften und das alte Testament, 1872, pp. 283, 284, and latterly in the article, Ur-Kasdim, in the Handwdrterbuch des Biblischen Altertums, 1894, pp. 1729, 1730). Sayce remarks that the worship of Sin, which was common to both towns, established a natural link between them, and that an inhabitant of Uru would have felt more at home in Harran than in any other town (The Higher Criticism and the Verdict of the Monuments, 3rd edit., p. 159, and Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 166, 167). ' The names of Sarah and Abraham, or rather the earlier form, Abram, have been found, the latter under the form Abiramu, in the contracts of the first Chaldsean empire (Halevy, Recherches Bibliques, p. 270 ; Sayce, The Higher Criticism, etc., p. 159). For the explanation of Sara in Chaldsean use, cf. Meissner, Beitrdge zum altbabylonischen Privatrecht, p. 213. * Gen. xi. 27-32. In the opinion of most critics, verses 27, 31, 32 form part of the document which was the basis of the various narratives still traceable in the Bible ; it is thought that the remaining verses bear the marks of a later redaction, or that they may be additions of a later date. The most important part of the text, that relating the migration from Ur-Kashdim to Kharan, belongs, therefore, to the very oldest part of the national tradition, and maybe regarded as expressing the knowledge which the Hebrews of later times possessed concerning the origin of their race. ’ Kenan, Histoire du Peuple d’Israel, vol. i. pp. 91, 92, where the name of Terakh is compared with that of Trachonitis, and the Biblical Kharan identified with the modern Hauran. ‘ Halevy, Mdanges d’Epigraphie et d’Archeologie S^mitiques, pp. 82-84, where Kharan is connected with Spelunca, a Roman station in Central Syria; cf. Recherches Bibliques, 715, note 1. * The most ancient interpretation identified this nameless river with the Euphrates ; an identification still admitted by most critics (Budde, Die Biblische Urgeschichte, p. 505, note 1 ; Kenan, Histoire du Peuple d’Israel, vol. i. p. 91); others prefer to recognise it as being the Jordan (Ed. Meyer, Geschichte des Alterthums, vol. i. p. 215; Stade, Geschichte des Volkes Israel, vol. i. pp. 110, 113). Halevy (Melanges d’Epigraphie, etc., p. 81) prefers to identify it with one of the rivers of Damascus, probably the Abana (cf. p. 8 of the present volume). “For the way in which Hebrew historians have taken cognisance of the relationship which connected them with neighbouring peoples, cf.

their common ancestor ; Ammon and Moab were, for instance, the issue of the
incestuous union of Lot and his daughters.^ Midian and his sons were descended
from Keturah, who was merely a second wife,^ Ishmael was the son of an Egyptian
slave,^ while the “ hairy ” Esau had sold his birthright and the primacy of the
Edomites to his brother Jacob, and consequently to the Israelites, for a dish of
lentilsJ Abraham left Kharan at the command of Jahveh, his Grod, receiving
from Him a promise that his posterity should be blessed above all others.
Abraham pursued his way into the heart of Canaan till he reached Shechem, and
there, under the oaks of Moreh, Jahveh, appearing to him a second time,
announced to him that He would give the whole land to his posterity as an
inheritance. Abraham virtually took possession of it, and wandered over it
with his flocks, building altars at Shechem, Bethel, and Mamre,® the places where
God had revealed Himself to him, treating as his equals the native chiefs,
Abimelech of Gerar and Melchizedek of Jerusalem,** and granting the valley
of the Jordan as a place of pasturage to his nephew Lot, whose flocks had
increased immensely.'^ His nomadic instinct having led him into Egypt, he
was here robbed of his wife by Pharaoh.® On his return he purchased the
field of Ephron, near Kirjath-Arba, and the cave of Machpelah, of which he made
a burying-place for his family.® Kirjath-Arba, the Hebron of subsequent times,

Sainte et la ioi, vol. i. p. 363, n. 3 : it appears from the passage in Deut. ii. 9, 19, which speaks of the Moabites and Ammonites, that the writer did not then know of this tradition, or did not choose to take it into consideration, and confined himself to stating the descent of the two peoples without connecting it with any incestuous origin. * Gen. XXV. 1-6. OtherHebrew documentsprefertoclassifytheMidianitesamongthe descendants of Ishmael {Gen. xxxvii. 25, 27, 28; Judges viii. 24). ^ Gen. xvi., xxi. 9-21, xxv. 12-18, where we have two different forms of the narrative, the first Jehovistic (ch. xvi.), the second Elohistic (xxi. 9-21) ; cf. Eeuss, L'Histoire Sainte et la Loi, vol, i. p. 127, note 78, for the comparison of the two versions. * Gen. xxvii. For Wellhausen’s theory of the probable date of this episode, cf his Prolegomena/ zur Geschichte Israels, p. 328, et seq. ^ Gen. xii. 1-4, 6-8. The mention of these three places would indicate, as far as the redaction ia concerned, that it was made at a period anterior to that when all other localities for worship except the temple at Jerusalem were proscribed by the law. “ Cf. the meeting with Melchizedek after the victory over the Elamites (Gen. xiv. 18-20) and the agreement with Abimelech about the well {Gen. xxi. 22-34). The mention of the covenant of Abraham with Abimelech belongs to the oldest part of the national tradition, and is given to us in the Jehovistic narrative (Eeuss, L’Histoire Sainte et la Loi, vol. i. pp. 368, 369). Many critics hav& questioned the historical existence of Melchizedek, and believed that the passage in which he is mentioned is merely a kinil of parable intended to show the head of the race paying tithe of the spoil to the priest of the suiireme God residing at Jerusalem (Eeuss, L’Histoire Sainte et la Loi, vol. i. p. 349) the information, however, furnished by the Tel-el-Amarua tablets about the ancient city of Jerusalem (ZiMMEEN, Lie Keilschrif(briefe aus Jerusalem, in tlie Zeitschri/tfur Assyriologie, vol. vi. pp. 245-263) and the character of its early kings have determined Sayce to pronounce Melchizedek to be an historical personage {The Higher Criticism and the Monuments, pp. 174-178, and Patriarchal Palestine, p. 71, et seq.). ' Gen. xiii. 1-13. Lot has been sometimes connected of late with the people called on the Egyptian monuments Eotanu, or Lotanu, whom we shall have occasion to mention frequently further on : he is supposed to have been their eponymous hero (Eenan, Histoire du Peuple Hebreu, vol. i. pp. 12, 115).

became from henceforward his favourite dwelling-place, and he was residing
there when the Elamites invaded the valley of Siddim,^ and carried
off Lot among their prisoners. Abraham set out in pursuit of them, and
succeeded in delivering his nephew.® God (Jahveh) not only favoured him on
every occasion, but expressed His will to extend over Abraham’s descendants
His sheltering protection. He made a covenant with him, enjoining the use
on the occasion of the mysterious rites employed among the nations when effect
ing a treaty of peace. Abraham offered up as victims a heifer, a goat, and a
three-year-old ram, together with a turtle-dove and a young pigeon ; he cut
the animals into pieces, and piling them in two heaps, waited till the evening.
“ And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abraham ; and lo, an
horror of great darkness fell upon him,” and a voice from on high said to him :
“ Know of a surety that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs,
and shall serve them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years ; and also
that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge : and afterward shall they come
out with great substance. ... And it came to pass, that when the sun went
down, and it was dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed
between those pieces.” Jahveh sealed the covenant by consuming the offering.*
Two less important figures fill the interval between the Divine prediction of
Mohammedans to exist to the present day in the cave which is situated within the enclosure of the mosque at Hebron, and the tradition on which this belief is based goes back to early Christian times cf.

servitude and its accomplishment. The birth of one of them, Isaac, was ascribed
to the Divine intervention at a period when Sarah had given up all hope of be
coming a mother. Abraham was sitting at his tent door in the heat of the day,
when three men presented themselves before him, whom he invited to repose
under the oak while he prepared, to offer them hospitality. After their meal,
he who seemed to be the chief of the three promised to return within a year,
when Sarah should be blessed with the possession of a son. The announce
ment came from Jahveh, but Sarah was ignorant of the fact, and laughed to
herself within the tent on hearing this amazing prediction ; for she said, “ After
I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also ? ” The child
was born, however, and was called Isaac, “ the laugher,” in remembrance of
Sarah’s mocking laugh.^ There is a remarkable resemblance between his life
and that of his father.^ Like Abraham he dwelt near Hebron,® and departing
thence wandered with his household round the wells of Beersheba. Like him he
was threatened with the loss of his wife ; like him, also, he renewed relations
with Abimelech of Gerar.^ He married his relative Kebecca, the granddaughter
of Nakhor and the sister of Laban.® After twenty years of barrenness, his
wife gave birth to twins, Esau and Jacob, who contended with each other from
their mother’s womb, and whose descendants kept up a perpetual feud.® We
know how Esau, under the influence of his appetite, deprived himself of
the privileges of his birthright, and subsequently went forth to become the
founder of the Edomites.'^ Jacob spent a portion of his youth in Padan-Aram ;
here he served Laban for the hands of his cousins Rachel and Leah ; then,
owing to the bad faith of his uncle, he left him secretly, after twenty years’
service, taking with him his wives and innumerable flocks.® At first he
wandered aimlessly along the eastern bank of the Jordan, where Jahveh re
vealed Himself to him in his troubles. Laban pursued and overtook him, and,
acknowledging his own injustice, pardoned him for having taken flight. Jacob
* Gen. xviii. 1-16, according to the Jehovistic narrative. Gen. xvii. 15-22 gives another account, in which the Elohistic writer predicts the birth of Isaac in a different way. The name of Isaac, “ the laugher,” possibly abridged from Isaak-el, “ he on whom God smiles ” (Renan, Hintoire du Peuple Israel, vol. i. p. 107), is explained in three different ways; first, by the laugh of Abraham (ch. xvii. 17); secondly, by that of Sarah (xviii. 12) when her son’s birth was foretold to her ; and lastly, by the laughter of those who made sport of the delayed maternity of Sarah (xxi. 6). “ Many critics see in the life of Isaac a colourless cop3' of that of Abraham, while others, on the contrary, consider that the primitive episodes belonged to the former, and that the parallel portions of the two lives were borrowed from the biography of the son to augment that of his father (WellHATJSEN, Prolegomena zur Geschiehte Israels, p. 338). ^ Gen. XXXV. 27., Elohistic narrative. * Gen. xxvi. 1-31, Jehovistic narrative. In Gen. xxv. 11 an Elohistic interpolation makes Isaac also dwell in the south, near to the “ Well of the Living One Who seeth me.” ^ Gen. xxiv., where two narratives appear to have been amalgamated; in the second of these, Abraham seems to have played no part, and Eliezer apparently conducted Rebecca direct to her husband Isaac (vers. 61-67). “ Gen. xxv. 20-26.

raised a heap of stones on the site of their encounter, known at Mizpah to
after-ages as the “ Stone of Witness ”—Gal-Ed (Galeed).^ This having been
accomplished, his difficulties began with his brother Esau, who bore him no
good will. One night, at the ford of the Jabbok, when he had fallen behind
his companions, “there wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day,”
without prevailing against him. The stranger endeavoured to escape before day
break, but only succeeded in doing so at the cost of giving Jacob his blessing.
“ What is thy name? And he said, Jacob. And he said. Thy name shall be
called no more Jacob, but Israel : for thou hast striven with God and with men,
and hast prevailed.” Jacob called the place Peniel, “for,” said he, “I have
seen God face to face, and my life is preserved.” The hollow of his thigh was
“ strained as he wrestled with him,” and he became permanently lame.^ Im
mediately after the struggle he met Esau, and endeavoured to appease
him by his humility, building a house for him, and providing booths for his
cattle, so as to secure for his descendants the possession of the land. From
this circumstance the place received the name of Succoth —the “ Booths ”— by
which appellation it was henceforth known.^ Another locality where Jahveh
had met Jacob while he was pitching his tents, derived from this fact the
designation of the “Two Hosts”— Mahanaim.^ On the other side of the river,
at Shechem,® at Bethel,® and at Hebron, near to the burial-place of his family,'^
traces' of him are everywhere to be found blent with those of Abraham. By
his two wives and their maids he had twelve sons. Leah was the mother of
Eeuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zabulon; Gad and Asher were
the children of his slave Zilpah ; while Joseph and Benjamin were the only
sons of Rachel — Dan and Naphtali® being the offspring of her servant Bilhah.
The preference which his father showed to him caused Joseph to be hated
by his brothers ; they sold him to a caravan of Midianites on their way to
Egypt, and persuaded Jacob that a wild beast had devoured him. Jahveh
vvas, however, with Joseph, and “made all that he did to prosper in his hand.”
' Gen. xxxi. 45-54, -where the -writer evidently traces the origin of the word Grilead to Gal-Ed.
We gather from the context that the narrative was connected with the cairn at Mizpah which separated the Hebrew from the Aramaean speaking peoples. ^ Gen. xxxii. 22-32. This is the account of the Jehovistic writer. The Elohist gives a different version of the circumstances which led to the change of name from Jacob to Israel ; he places the scene at Bethel, and suggests no precise etymology for the name Israel (Gen. xxxv. 9-15). ’ Gen. xxxiii. 1-17.

He was bought by Potipbar, a great Egyptian lord and captain of Pharaoh’s
guard, wlio made him his overseer ; his master’s wife, however, “ cast her eyes
upon Joseph,” but finding that he rejected her shameless advances, she accused
him of having ofifered violence to her person/ Being cast into prison, he
astonished his companions in misfortune by his skill in reading dreams, and
was summoned to Court to interpret to the king his dream of the seven lean
kine who had devoured the seven fat kine, which he did by representing the
latter as seven years of abundance, of which the crops should be swallowed up
by seven years of famine. Joseph was thereupon raised by Pharaoh to the rank
of prime minister. He stored up the surplus of the abundant harvests, and
as soon as the famine broke out, distributed the corn to the hunger-stricken
people in exchange for their silver and gold, and for their fiocks and fields.
Hence it was that the whole of the Nile valley, with the exception of the
lands belonging to the priests, gradually passed into the possession of the royal
treasury. Meanwhile his brethren, who also suffered from the famine, came
down into Egypt to buy corn. Joseph revealed himself to them, pardoned the
wrong they had done him, and presented them to the Pharaoh. “And Pharaoh
said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren. This do ye ; lade your beasts, and go,
get you unto the land of Canaan ; and take your father and your household,
and come unto me : and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye
shall eat the fat of the land.” Jacob thereupon raised his camp and came to
Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac ; and
Jahveh commanded him to go down into Egypt, saying, “ I Avill there make
of thee a great nation : I will go down with thee into Egypt : and I will also
surely bring thee up again : and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine eyes.”
The whole family were installed by Pharaoh in the province of Goshen, as far
as possible from the centres of the native population, “ for every shepherd is
an abomination unto the Egyptians.” ^
In the midst of these stern yet touching narratives in which the Hebrews of
later times delighted to trace the history of their remote ancestors, one im
portant fact arrests our attention : the Beni-Israel quitted Southern Syria and
settled on the banks of the Nile. They had remained for a considerable time
in what was known later as the mountains of Judah. Hebron had served as
their rallying-point ; the broad but scantily watered wadys separating the cul
tivated lands from the desert, were to them a patrimony, which they shared

Ebers, JEgypten und die Bucher Moses, pp. 314, 315; and Maspeeo, Les contes populaires de VEgypte Ancienne, 2nd edit., pp. xii.-xiv. ^ The history of Joseph is contained in Gen. xxxvii., xxxix.-xlvi. The commentary of Vigourodx, La Bible et les Decouvertes modernes, vol. ii. pp. 1-227, and that of Beugsch, Stcinschrift und Bibelwort, pp. 77-103, give an idea of the manner in which orthodox commentators and Egyptologists can defend the authenticity of the narrative by references to the ancient monuments.

with, the inhabitants of the neighbouring towns. Every year, in the spring,
they led their flocks to browse on the thin herbage growing in the bottoms of
the valleys, removing them to another district only when the supply of fodder
was exhausted. The women span, wove, fashioned garments, baked bread,
cooked the viands, and devoted themselves to the care of the younger children,
whom they suckled beyond the usual period. The men lived like the Bedouin
periods of activity alternating regularly with times of idleness, and the daily
routine, with its simple duties and casual work, often gave place to quarrels
for the possession of some rich pasturage or some never-failing well.^
A comparatively ancient tradition relates that the Hebrews arrived in
Egypt during the reign of Aphobis, a Hyksos king, doubtless one of the Apopi,
and possibly the monarch who restored the monuments of the Theban Pharaohs,
and engraved his name on the sphinxes of AmenemhMt III. and on the colossi
of Mirmashau.^ The land which the Hebrews obtained is that which, down to
the present day, is most frequently visited by nomads, who find there an uncertain
hospitality. The tribes of the isthmus of Suez are now, in fact, constantly
shifting from one continent to another, and their encampments in any
place are merely temporary. The lord of the soil must, if he desire to keep
them within his borders, treat them with the greatest prudence and tact.
Should the government displease them in any way, or appear to curtail their
liberty, they pack up their tents and take flight into the desert. The district
occupied by them one day is on the next vacated and left to desolation.^
Probably the same state of things existed in ancient times, and the border
nomes on the east of the Delta were in turn inhabited or deserted by the
Bedouin of the period. The towns were few in number, but a series of forts
protected the frontier. These were mere village-strongholds perched on the
summit of some eminence, and surrounded by a strip of cornland. Beyond the
frontier extended a region of bare rock, or a wide plain saturated with the ill
regulated surplus water of the inundation. The land of Goshen was bounded by
* Compare the picture of the Semitic nomads traced by Eenan, Hisioire du Peuple d'Israel, vol. i. pp. 13-25, with that of the Bedouin furnished by the Memoirs of Sinuhit (cf. Maspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 471-473) ; the narrative of Genesis bears witness to a state of things analogous to that revealed by the Egyptian text as existing in the age of the XIB’* and XIII''* dynasties. " The year XVII. of Apophis has been pointed out as the datp of their arrival (Georgius Syncellus, Chronography, Dindorp’s edit., p. 201), and this combination, probably proposed by some learned Jew •of Alexandria, was adopted by Christian chroniclers. It is unsupported by any fact of Egyptian history, but it rests on a series of calculations founded on the information contained in the Bible. Starting from the assumption that the Exodus must have taken place under Ahmosis, and that the children of Israel had been four hundred and thirty years on the banks of the Nile, it was found that the beginning of their sojourn fell under the reign of the Apophis mentioned by Josephus, and, to be still more correct, in the XVIB'* year of that prince (Eeman, Zur Ghronologie der Hyksos, in the Zeitschrift, 1880, pp. 125-127). ^ In the last century, and even in our own times, we have examples of several migrations of tribes established on the isthmus in the eastern districts of the Delta, who passed from Egypt into Syria or from Syria into Egypt, to escape the exactions of Egyptian or Turkish governors.

the cities of Heliopolis on the south, Bubastis on the west, and Tanis andMendes
on the north: the garrison at Avaris could easily keep watch over it and maintain
order within it, while they could at the same time defend it from the incursions
of the Monatiu and the Hiru-Shaitud The Beni-Israel throve in these sur
roundings so well adapted to their traditional tastes. Even if their subsequent
importance as a nation has been over-estimated, they did not at least share
the fate of many foreign tribes, who, when transplanted into Egypt, waned
and died out, or, at the end of two or three generations, became merged in
the native population.^ In pursuing their calling as shepherds, almost within
sight of the rich cities of the Nile valley, they never forsook the God of
their fathers to bow down before the Enneads or Triads of Egypt ; whether
He was already known to them as Jahveh, or was worshipped under the
collective name of Elohim, they served Him with almost unbroken fidelity
even in the presence of Ea and Osiris, of Phtah and Sutkhu.^
The Hyksos conquest had not in any way modified the feudal system of
the country.^ The Shepherd-kings must have inherited the royal domain just
as they found it at the close of the XIV“' dynasty, but doubtless the whole
Delta, from Avaris to Sais, and from Memphis to Buto, was their personal
appanage.® Their direct authority probably extended no further south than
the pyramids, and their supremacy over the fiefs of the Said was at best
* The limits of the laud of Gosheu are uot clearly defined : I have adopted those indicated by Ebers, Durch Gosen zurn Sinai, pp. 73, 74, 488-513, and Naville, Goshen and the Shrine of Saft el Henneh, pp. 14-20; also Brugsch, Steininschrift und Bibelwort, pp. 116, 117. Goshen comprised the provinces situated on the borders of the cultivable coruland, and watered by the infiltration of the Nile, which caused the growth of a vegetation sufficient to support the flocks during a few weeks ; and It may also have included the imperfectly irrigated provinces which were covered with pools and reedy swamps after each inundation ; cf. the description of the districts frequented by the Bedouin in Jomard, Observations sur les Arabes de VEgypte Moyenne, in the Description de VEgypte, vol. xii. pp. 310, 311. ^ We are told that when the Hebrews left Kamses, they were “about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, beside children. And a mixed multitude went up also with them ; and flocks and herds, even very much cattle” (Exod. xii. 37, 38). ® Kenan, Histoire du Peuple d’ Israel, vol. i. pp. 142-153, where exception must be taken to what the author says with regard to the pernicious influence of Egypt. If any Egyptian influence took effect, it is impossible to say at the present time whether it were good or bad ; every definite trace of it has disappeared from the Biblical narrative. * This is evident from the very passage in which Manetho describes the expulsion of the Hyksos : Mera ravra 5e riiiv iK rtjs QrjfiatBos Kal ttjs aAAT?s Alyvirrov fiaaiAeaiv yeveaBai (pnalv iwl tovs Iloi/teyas fivaud(jTacriv (Muller-Didot, Fragnientu Historicorum Grxcorum, vol. ii. p. 567). Hence the document of which Manetho made use inferred that not only the Theban princes but those of the whole of Egypt were subject to the Shepherds, since it describes them as rebelling against their masters. * The monuments found at Tanis and Bubastis (cf. pp. 58, 59 of the present work) sufficiently prove that the eastern part of the Delta was under the immediate authority of the Shepherd-kings. As for the remainder of the country, there is adequate proof afforded by a passage of the inscription in the Stabl-Antar, in which Queen Hatshopsith relates that she “ raised up the monuments destroyed in the times when the Amhu reigned over the country of the north ” (Golenischeff, Notice sur un Texte lii^roghypihique du Stabl-Antar, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. iii. pp. 2, 3). The fragment of the text in which Miuephtah speaks “ of the kings of Lower Egypt who possessed the whole land” (Domichen, Historische Inschriften, vol. i. pi. 4, 11. 39, 40; Mariette, Earnalc, pi. 53, 11. 39, 40) refers to the same period, but it recalls the fact of their suzerainty over the entire valley (E. de Rouge, M^moire sur les Attaques dirigees contre VEgypte par les peuples de la Mer, p. 7).



THEBES REVOLTS AGAINST TEE EYESOS. 73
precarious. The turbulent lords who shared among them the possession of the
valley had never lost their proud or rebellious spirit, and under the foreign as
under the native Pharaohs regulated their obedience to their ruler by the energy
he displayed, or by their regard for the resources at his disposal. Thebes had
never completely lost the ascendency which it obtained over them at the fall of
the Memphite dynasty. The accession of the Xoite dynasty, and the arrival of
the Shepherd-kings, in relegating Thebes unceremoniously to a second rank, had
not discouraged it, or lowered its royal prestige in its own eyes or in those of
others : the lords of the south instinctively rallied around it, as around their
natural citadel, and their resources, combined with its own, rendered it as
formidable a power as that of the masters of the Delta. If we had fuller
information as to the history of this period, we should doubtless see that the
various Theban princes took occasion, as in the Heracleopolitan epoch, to pick
a quarrel with their sovereign lord, and did not allow themselves to be dis
couraged by any check.^ The centuries of rule attributed by the chronicles
to the Hyksos of the XVP’* dynasty were not probably, as far as they were
concerned, years of perfect tranquillity, or of undisputed authority. In
inscribing their sole names on the lists, the compilers denoted merely the
shorter or longer period during which their Theban vassals ^ failed in their
rebellious efforts, and did not dare to assume openly the title or ensigns of
royalty. A certain Apophis, probably the same who took the prsenomen of
Aqnunri, was reigning at Tanis when the decisive revolt broke out, and
Saqnunri Tiuaa I., who was the leader on the occasion, had no other title of
authority over the provinces of the south ^ than that of liiqii,, or regent.
‘ The length of time during which Egypt was subject to Asiatic rule is not fully known. Historians are agreed in recognising the three epochs referred to in the narrative of Manetho (Mdllbr-Didot, Frag. Hisioricorum Grxcorum, vol. ii. pp. 566-568) as corresponding with (1) the conquest and the six first Hyksos kings, including the XV“* Theban dynasty ; (2) the complete submission of Egypt to the XV1“* foreign dynasty; (3) the war of independence during the XVIP*' dynasty, wliich consisted of two parallel series of kings, the one Shepherds (Pharaohs), the other Thebans (Maspeeo, Une Enquetejudiciaire a Thebes, pp. 79, 80, and Bevue Critique, 1870, vol. ii. pp. 118, 119). There has been considerable discussion as to the duration of the oppression. The best solution is still that given by Erman (Xwr CAronoZogieder Hy&sos, in the Xe^^sc7^r^yf, 1879, pp. 125-127), according to whom the XV*** dynasty lasted 284, the XVP** 234, and the XVII“' 143 years, or, in all, 661 years. The invasion must, therefore, have taken place about 2346 b.c., or about the time when the Elamite power was at its highest. The advent of the XVI‘** dynasty would fall about 2062 b.c.,. and the commencement of the war of independence between 1730 and 1720 b.c. * The supremacy of Thebes over the other principalities is proved by the title of Theban ” dynasty, which Manetho attributed to the indigenous Pharaohs who contended with the last of the Shepherds (Mdller-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grsecorum, vol. ii. pp. 567, 568), as well as by the account given in the Saltier Papyrus, No. 1, which makes the “ Eegent of Thebes ” the rival of the Sovereign of Avaris (pi. i. 11. 1, 2). ® Saltier Papyrus, No. 1, pi. i. 1. 1 ; cf. Maspeeo, Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. i. pp. 198, 199. The early Egyptologists who studied this period thought that the founder of the XVIP*^ Theban dynasty was the king mentioned at El-Kab, Saqnunri Tiuaqni (E. de Eouge, Examen de I’Ouvrage de M. te Chev. de Bunsen, ii. p. 31, and Atli€nseum Frangais, 1852, p. 432 ; Beugsch, Egyptische Studien,. § ii. p. 12). Chabas says that this must be the first of the two Saqnunris mentioned in the Abbott Papyrus (pi. iii. 11. 8-11), who bore the name of Tiuaa (Les Pasteurs enEgypte, pp. 37-40). The proof that the Apophis of the Sallier Papyrus is probably Apopi Aqnunri is furnished by the form of the

VVe are unacquainted with the cause of the outbreak or with its sequel, and
the Egyptians themselves seem to have been not much better informed
on the subject than ourselves. They gave free flight to their fancy, and
accommodated the details to their taste, not shrinking from the introduction
of daring fictions into the account. A romance, which was very popular with
the literati four or five hundred years later, asserted that the real cause of
the war was a kind of religious quarrel.^ “ It happened that the land of
Egypt belonged to the Fever-stricken, and, as there was no supreme king at
that time, it happened then that King Saqnunri was regent of the city of the
south, and that the Fever-stricken of the city of Ka were under the rule of
Ea-Ap6pi in Avaris.^ The Whole Land tribute to the latter in manu
factured products, and the north did the same in all the good things of the
Delta. Now, the King Ea-Ap6pi took to himself Sutkhu for lord, and he did
not serve any other god in the Whole Land except Sutkhu, and he built a
temple of excellent and everlasting work at the gate of the King Ea-Ap6pi,
and he arose every morning to sacrifice the daily victims, and the chief vassals
were there with garlands of flowers, as it was accustomed to be done for the
temple of Phra-Harmakhis.” ^ Having finished the temple, he thought of
imposing upon the Thebans the cult of his god, but as he shrank from employ
ing force in such a delicate matter, he had recourse to stratagem. He took
counsel with his princes and generals, but they were unable to propose any plan.
<5artouclie prffinomeu, as Brugscli saw as soon as Mariette had given the true reading of the name (^GescMchte lEgyptens, p. 824, where the prsenomen of one of the two Tineas is mistakenly read Aqnunri, like tliat of the Shepherd-king); the two epithets, Saqnunri, Aqnunri, are formed on the same model, and as Apopi reigned before his rival, it was evidently Tiuaa who derived his prsenomen Saqnunri from that of Aqnunri. * The Sallier Papyrus, No. 1, was written in the year X., probably in the reign of Minephtah ; in any case, under tlie rule of a Pharaoh who is to be placed in the second half of the XIX**^ dynasty. The value of the document forming its first pages was recognised by E. de Eouge (Ath^nseum Frangais, 1854, p. 532), and the interpretation of a few lines attempted shortly after by Brugsch {JEgyptisclte Studien, voh i. pp. 8-21). It has since been translated by Goodwin {Hieratic Papyri, in the Cambridge Essays, 1858, pp. 243-245), by Chabas {Les Pasteurs en Egypte, pp. 16-19), by Brugsch {Histoire d'Egypte, p. 78 ; Gescliiehte Mgyptens, pp. 222-226), by Ebers {Mgypten und die Eiicher Moses, p. 204, et seq ), by Lushington {Frag, of the 1st Sallier Pap., in the Becords of the Past, 1st series, vol. viii. pp. 1-4); by Maspero {Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. i. pp. 198-214). The results were at first received as historical, except by Goodwin (cf. Bunsen, Egypt's Place, vol. iv. p. 671). The true nature of the document was indicated at length by Maspero {Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. i. pp. 195216, and Les Contes populaires de VEgypte Ancienne, 2nd edit., pp. xxviii.-xxxi.), and the majority of Egyptologists have since fallen in with this opinion (Wiedemann, Geschichte JEgyptens, p. 71, and AEgyptische Geschichte, pp. 299, 300 ; Eeman, Neuxgyptische Grammatik, p. 2, and Algypten und AEgyptisches Leben, p. 502; Ed. Meyer, Geschichte des Alterthums, vol. i. pp. 135, 256, and Geschichte .Eigyptens, p. 212), without, however, accepting my view that the Egyptian story belongs to the class of wager and riddle narratives. ^ The text is here uncertain, and Piehl, Varia, § xiv., in the Zeitschrift, 1885, p. 60, as well as Lefisbdrb, Un des Noms de la BoyautC septentrionale, in the Zeitschrift, 1893, vol. xxxi. p. 116, has propounded readings of it different from mine. Lefe'bure renders it, “ The scourge of the towns, Apepi-Ka, was chief of the north in Avaris, while Sekenen-Ea was chief of the south at Thebes,” but “ there was no king in that day.” ^ Sallier Papyrus, No. 1, pi. i. 11. 1-4 ; cf. Maspero, Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. i. pp. 198-203, and Contes populaires de VEgypte Ancienne, 2nd edit., pp. 278, 279.



THE ROMANCE OF APOPI AND OF SAQNUNRI. 75
The college of diviners and scribes was more complaisant : “ Let a messenger
go to the regent of the city of the South to tell him : The King Ra-Ap6pi
commands thee : ‘ That the hippopotami which are in the pool of the town are
to be exterminated in the pool, in order that slumber may come to me by day
and by night.’ He will not be able to reply good or bad, and thou
shalt send him another messenger : The King Ra-Ap6pi commands
thee : ‘ If the chief of the South does not reply to my message, let
him serve no longer any god but Sutkhu. But if he replies to it, and
will do that which I tell him to do, then I will impose nothing
further upon him, and I will not in future bow before any other god
of the Whole Land than Amonra, king of the gods !
’ ” Another
Pharaoh of popular romance, Nectanebo, possessed, at a much later
date, mares which conceived at the neighing of the stallions of
Babylon, and his friend Lycerus had a cat which went forth every
night to wring the necks of the cocks of Memphis : ^ the hippopo
tami of the Theban lake, which troubled the rest of the King of Tanis,
were evidently of close kin to these extraordinary animals. The
sequel is unfortunately lost. We may assume, however, without
much risk of error, that Saqnunri came forth safe and sound from the
ordeal ; that Apopi was taken in his own trap, and saw himself driven
to the dire extremity of giving up Sutkhu for Amonra or of de
claring war. He was likely to adopt the latter alternative, and the
end of the manuscript would probably have related his defeat.
Hostilities continued for a century and a half from the time when
Saqnunri Tiuaa declared himself son of the Sun and king of the two Egypts.
From the moment in which he surrounded his name with a cartouche, the princes
of the Said threw in their lot with him, and the XVIP'^ dynasty had its begin
ning on the day of his proclamation.^ The strife at first was undecisive and
without marked advantage to either side at length the Pharaoh whom the

nected with iEsop : cf. La Vie d’Esope le Phrygien, translated by La Fontaine (Fables, ed. Lemerre

Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte, etc., pi. cxci. A, 3, and Pierret, Catalogue de la Salle Hislorique de la Galerie Egyptienne, p. 153, No. 614 his. This small object, which was attributed to Saqnunri III. Tiuaqni, has been restored to Tihaa by Maspero, Une Enquete judiciaire a Thebes, p. 78. 3 Maspero, Une Enquete judiciare, pp. 79, 80; cf. Revue Critique, 1870, vol. ii. pp. 119, 120. In
this, as in many other cases, a change of dynasty in the lists of Manetho does not indicate the accession of a new family, but a change in the condition of the reigning family. * Manetho says so formally ; rav iK r^s Qy^atSos ual rys &X\7}s Alyvinov ffacriAewv yeveo-6aL (pyalv firi Tovs TTOifieyas iwavdaraaiv, Kal Tr6\ep.ov avTois eTvppayijvai. fiiyav ual iroKvxpAv i-ov (Mullbr-DidOT, Frag.

Frman thinks, on the contrary, that Tiuaa found no support among the petty princes, but that they preferred to continue vassals of a foreigner rather than recognise the sovereignty of one of their equals {Mgypten und jEgyptisches Lehen, p. 152).



76 THE HTKSOS IN EGYPT.
Grreek copyists of Manetlio call Alisphragmouthosis, defeated the barbarians,
drove them away from Memphis and from the western plains of the Delta,
and shut them up in their entrenched camp at Avaris,^ between the
Sebennytic branch of the Nile and the Wady Tumilat. The monuments
bearing on this period of strife 'and misery are few in number, and it is
a fortunate circumstance it some insignificant object turns up which
would elsewhere be passed over as unworthy of notice. One of
the officials of Tiuaa I. has left us his writing palette, on which
the cartouches of his master are incised with a rudeness baffling
description. We have also information of a prince of the blood,
a king’s son, Tuau, who accompanied this same Pharaoh in his
expeditions; and the Gizeh Museum is proud of having in its pos
session the wooden sabre which this individual placed on the mummy
of a certain Aqhotu, to enable him to defend himself against the
monsters of the lower world. A second Saqnunri Tiuaa succeeded
the first, and like him was buried in a little brick pyramid on the
border of the Theban necropolis.'^ At his death the series of rulers
was broken, and we meet with several names which are difficult to
classify — Sakhontinibii, Sanakhtu-niri,^ Hotpuri, Manhotpuii,
* Manetho, in Mulleu-Didot, JVag'. Hist. Grxc. ,yo\. ii. pp. 567, 568. The variant readings Mephramouthosis and Misphramoiitbosis are found in the MSS., and much labour' has been expended in the effort to identify the disfigured name with one of the known kings. Unger sees in it that of Ahmassipiri (cf. p. 94 of the present work), one of the sons of Ahmosis who did not reign (Chronologie des Manetho, pp. 155, 156), but the majority of Egyptologists have identified it with the name of Thutmosis III., following Lepsius in assuming that the Hyksos were not expelled until the reign of that prince, which is incorrect, as we shall see later on; others are of opinion tliat the Hyksos were expelled in the reign of Ahmosis, but consider Manetho’s account to be a romance in which facts and names are jumbled together without any regard to truth (Wiedemann, Mgyptische GeschicMe, p. 302). “ The two Tiftaas and their pyramids were made known by the Abbott Papyrus, pi. iii. 11. 8-11, where Tiuaa is called Tiuaa-aa, i.e. Tin, the twice great. Their true place in the series was determined by Chabas, Les Pasteurs en Egypte, pp. 38-40. It is worth considering whether Tiuaa-aa is not the same person as Tiftaqni, whose name is sometimes written in the short form Tiufia (Boueiant, Notes de Voyage, § 6, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xi. p. 159), and that there were, therefore, only two instead of the usually assumed three Tidaas.

The object is reproduced by Mariette, Monuments divers, pi. 51 V, and p. 16; Album Photographique du Mus^e de Boulaq, pi. 37. * No contemporary monument of Sakhontiuibri or Sanakhtuniri has yet been found. The first is mentioned, as far as I know, only in the series of Theban kings to whom the oflicial of the Necropolis, Khabokhni, rendered homage in the time of the XX'** dynasly (Burton, Excerpta Hieroglyphica, pi. 35 ; Wilkinson, Extracts from several Eieroglyphical Subjects, pi. v. 2 ; Ohampollion, Monuments de V Egypte et de la Nubie, vol. ii. p. 866 ; Prisse d’Avennes, Monuments, pi. iii. p. 1 ; Lepsius, Denkmdler, iii. 2 aj.

Rahotpu.^ As we proceed, however, information becomes more plentiful, and the
list of reigns almost complete. The part which the princesses of older times
played in the transmission of power had, from the XIP' dynasty downward, con
siderably increased in importance, and threatened to overshadow that of the
princes.^ The question presents itself whether, during these centuries of per
petual warfare, there had not been a moment when, all the males of the family
having perished, the women alone were left to perpetuate the solar race on
the earth and to keep the succession unbroken. As soon as the veil over this
period of history begins to be lifted, we distinguish among the personages
emerging from the obscurity as many queens as kings presiding over the
destinies of Egypt. The sons took precedence of the daughters when both
were the offspring of a brother and sister born of the same parents, and when,
consequently, they were of equal rank ; but, on the other hand, the sons for
feited this equality when there was any inferiority in origin on the maternal
side, and their prospect of succession to the throne diminished in proportiop to
their mother’s remoteness from the line of Ra. In the latter case all their
sisters, born of marriages which to us appear incestuous, took precedence of
them, and the eldest daughter became the legitimate Pharaoh, who sat in the
seat of Horus on the death of her father, or even occasionally during his
lifetime. The prince whom she married governed for her, and discharged
those royal duties which could be legally performed by a man only,—such as
offering worship to the supreme gods, commanding the army, and administering
justice; but his wife never ceased to be sovereign, and however small the
intelligence or firmness of which she might be possessed, her husband was
obliged to leave to her, at all events on certain occasions, the direction of
affairs. At her death her children inherited the crown : their father had

They might, strictly speaking, be called secondary kings, who were contemporaneous with the Saqnunris or Ahmosis (Maspero, Les Mamies royales de Deir-el-Bahari, in the M^moires publics par les memhres de la Mission du Caire, vol. i. pp. 638, 639. * Hotpuri and Manhotphri are both mentioned in the fragments of a fantastic story (copied during the XX‘** dynasty), bits of which are found in most European museums (Maspero, Les Contes populaires de VEgypte ancienne, 2ad edit., pp. 287-296). In one of these fragments, preserved in the Louvre, mention is made of Hotphri’s tomb, certainly situated at Thebes (Id., ibid., pp. 291, 292) ; we possess scarabs of this king, and Petrie discovered at Coptos a fragment of a stele bearing his name and titles, and describing the works which he executed in the temples of the town {History of Egypt, pp. 246, 247). The XIV*'' year of Manhotpflri is mentioned in a passage of the story, as being the date of the death of a personage born under Hotpuri (Maspero, Les Contes populaires de VEgypte ancienne, 2nd edit., p. 293). These two kings belong, as far as we are able to judge, to the middle of the XVIT*' dynasty; I am inclined to place beside them the Pharaoh Nhbhotpuri, of whom we possess a few rather coarse scarabs (Flinders Petrie, Historical Scarabs, pi. 26). 2 On the subject of these queens, see Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 258, 259, 270-276.

formally to invest the eldest of them with royal authority in the room of the
deceased, and with him he shared the
externals, if not the reality, of power.^
It is doubtful whether the third
Saqnunri Tiuaa known to us—he
who added an epithet to his name,
and was commonly known as Tiuaqni,
“ Tiuaa the brave ” ^—united in his
person all the requisites of a Pharaoh
qualified to reign in his own right.
However this may have been, at all
events his wife, Queen Ahhotpu,
possessed them. His eldest son
Ahmosu died prematurely; the two
younger brothers, Kamosu and a
second Ahmosu, the Amosis of the
Grreeks, assumed the crown after him.
It is possible, as frequently happened,
that their young sister Ahmasi
Hofritari entered the harem of both
brothers consecutively. We cannot
be sure tliat she was united to Kamosu,
but at all events she became the wife

It is to him that the Tiuaa cartouche refers, which is to be found on the statne mentioned by Daninos-Pasha, published by Bodeiant {Notes de Voyage, § 6, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xi. p. 159), and on which we find Ahmosis, a princess of the same name, together with Queen Ahhotpil I. ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Flinders Petrie. * I have attempted to construct a genealogy of this family in Les Momies royales de Deir-el-Bahari (Memoire de la Mission de Gaire, vol. i. pp. 620-637). One part of it is certain : (1) the marriage of Ahhotpu I. with Tiuaa III.

very probably waged war against the Shepherds, and it is not known whether
he fell upon the field of battle or was the victim of some plot ; the appearance
of his mummy proves that he died a violent death when
about forty years of aged Two or three men,
whether assassins or soldiers, must have
surrounded and despatched him before help
was available. A blow from an axe must
have severed part of his left cheek, exposed
the teeth, fractured the jaw, and sent him
senseless to the ground ; another blow must
have seriously injured the skull, and a dagger
or javelin has cut open the forehead on the right
side, a little above the eye. His body must have
remained lying where it fell for some time : when
found, decomposition had set in, and the embalming
had to be hastily performed as best it might. The the head of saonunui hi.^
hair is thick, rough, and matted ; the face had been
shaved on the morning of his death, but by touching the cheek we can
ascertain how harsh and abundant the hair must have been. The mummy
is that of a fine, vigorous man, who might have lived to a hundred years,
and he must have defended himself resolutely against his assailants ; his
features bear even now an expression of fury. A flattened patch of exuded
brain appears above one eye, the forehead is wrinkled, and the lips, which
are drawn back in a circle about the gums, reveal the teeth still biting
into the tongue. Kamosu did not reign long;® we know nothing of the
and bis sister Ahmosis, probably the future Queen Ahmasi-Nofritari. The other sons are not named on this monument, which is dedicated to the deceased by his father, his mother, and the sister who would have reigned with him had he lived ; (2) the parentage of Ahhotph I. and of Ahmosis (Stele of Edfh, published by U. Botjeiaht, Petits Monuments et Petits Textes, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. ix. pp. 92, 93; cf. Maspero, ies iifomfes royaZes, pp. 625-628); (3) the fact that Nofritari was her husband’s sister, both on the father’s side, as is shown by the words “royal sister ” on lier protocol between the titles “ daughter ” and “ wife of a king ” (Les Momies royales, p. 535), and alao on the mother’s side, as is proved by the place which she occupies by the side of Ahhotpu on Daninos-Pasha’s statue (Botjeiant, Notes de Voyage, § 6, in the Rec.ueil de Travaux, vol. i. p. 159). The order in wliich Kamosh should be placed is not quite certain ; the probability is, however, that he ought to come between Tiuaqni and Ahmosis, and that he was a brother of the latter. ‘ All these details as to the king’s appearance and the manner of his death are furnished by the mummy which is at present in the museum at Gizeh (Maspero, Les Momies royales de Deir-el-Baliarir in the M^moires de la Mission Franyaise, vol. i. pp. 526-529). The name Taaaten, which Wiedemann assigns to this prince {AUgyptische GeschioMe, p. 301), is merely a misspelling of the name Tiuaqni, due to the engraver who executed the inscription on the coffin (Maspero, Les Momies royales, pp. 526, 527).

events of his life, but we owe to him one of the prettiest examples of the
goldsmith’s art — the gold boat mounted on a carriage of w'ood and
bronze, which was to convey his double on its journeys through Hades. This
boat was afterwards appropriated by his mother Ahhotpu. Ahmosis ^ must
have been about twenty-five years of age when he ascended the throne ; he
was of medium height, as his body when mummied measured only 5 feet 6 inches
in length, but the development of the neck and chest indicates extraordi
nary strength. The head is small in proportion to the bust, the forehead
low and narrow, the cheek-bones project, and the hair is thick and wavy.
The face exactly resembles that of Tiuaqni, and the likeness alone would
proclaim the affinity, even if we w'ere ignorant of the close relationship which
united these two Pharaohs.^ Ahmosis seems to have been a strong, active,
warlike man ; he was successful in all the wars in which we know him to
have been engaged, and he ousted the Shepherds from the last towns occupied
by them. It is possible that modern writers have exaggerated the credit
due to Ahmosis for expelling the Hyksos. He found the task already half
accomplished, and the warfare of his forefathers for at least a century
must have prepared the way for his success ; if he appears to have played
the most important role in the history of the deliverance, it is owing to
our ignorance of the work of others, and he thus benefits by the oblivion
into which their deeds have passed. Taking this into consideration, we must
still admit that the Shepherds, even when driven into Avails, ivere not adver
saries to be despised. Forced by the continual pressure of the Egyptian armies
into this corner of the Delta, they were as a compact body the more able to make
a protracted resistance against very superior forces. The impenetrable marshes
of Menzaleh on the north, and the desert of the Red Sea on the south, com
pletely covered both their wings ; the shifting network of the branches of the
Nile, together with the artificial canals, protected them as by a series of moats
in front, while Syria in their rear offered them inexhaustible resources for
revictualling their troops, or levying recruits among tribes of kindred race.
As long as they could hold their ground there, a re-invasion was always possible ;

His pyramid was at Drah-Abu’l-Neggah, beside those of Tiuaa and Amenothes I. {Ahhott Papyrus, 1. iii. 1. 12). * The name Ahmosu or Ahmosi is usually translated “ Child of the Moon-god ” (Beugsch, Geschichte JEgyptens, p. 254) ; the real meaning is, “ the Moon-god has brought forth,” “ him ” or ^‘her” (referring to the person who bears the name) being understood (Maspero, in the Revue Critique, 1880, vol. i. p. 106). ^ Here again my description is taken from the present appearance of the mummy, which is now in the Gizeh Museum (Maspero, Les Mamies royales de Beir-el-Bahari, in the M^moires de la Mission du Caire, vol. i. pp. 533-535). It is evident, from the inspection which I have made, that Ahmosis was about fifty years old at the time of his death, and, allowing him to have reigned twenty-five years, he must have been twenty-five or twenty-six when he came to the throne.

one victory would bring them to Memphis, and the whole valley would again
fall under their suzerainty. Ahmosis, by driving them from their last strong
hold, averted this danger. It is, therefore, not without reason that the official
chroniclers of later times separated him from his ancestors and made him
the head of a new dynasty. His predecessors had in reality been merely
Pharaohs on sufferance, ruling in the south within the confines of their
Theban principality, gaining in power, it is true, with every generation, but
never able to attain to the suzerainty of the whole country. They were reckoned

Lepsius thought he saw grounds for preferring the second reading, and identified this Tethmosis with Thutmosi Manakhpirri, the Thutmosis III. of our lists ; Ahmosis could only have driven out the greater part of the nation. This theory, to which Naville still adheres {Bubastis, pp. 29, 30), as also does Steindorff (^Zur Geschichte der Hylcsos, pp. 7, 8), was disputed nearly fifty years ago by E. de Eouge (^Examen de I’ouvrage de M. le Chevalier de Bunsen, ii. pp. 36-43) : nowadays we are obliged to admit that, subsequent to the V*‘* year of Ahmosis, there were no longer Shepherd-kings in Egypt, even though a part of the conquering race may have remained in the country in a state of slavery, as we shall soon have occasion to observe (cf. pp. 88, 89 of the present work). ’ This is evident from a passage in the biography of Ahmosi-si-Abina (1. 14), where it is stated that, after the taking of Avaris, the king passed into Asia in the year VI. (cf. p. 88 of the present work). The first few lines of the Great Inscription of El-Kab (11. 5-15) seem to refer to four successive campaigns, i.e. four years of warfare up to the taking of Avaris, and to a fifth year spent in
pursuing the Shepherds into Syria.

fortune of his house another of them, Ai, married Khonsu, one of the
daughters of Sovkumsauf I. and his Queen Nubkhas,^ and it is possible that
the misshapen pyramid of Qulah, the most southern in Egypt proper, was
built for one of these royally connected personages. The descendants of
Ai attached themselves faithfully to the Pharaohs of the XVIP'* dynasty,
and helped them to the utmost in their struggle against the invaders. Their
capital, Nekhabit, was situated between the Nile and the Arabian chain, at
the entrance to a valley which penetrates some distance into the desert, and
leads to the gold-mines on the Eed Sea. The town profited considerably from
the precious metals brought into it by the caravans, and also from the extraction
of natron, which from prehistoric times was largely employed in embalming.^
It had been a fortified place from the outset, and its walls, carefully repaired
by successive ages, were still intact at the beginning of this century. They
described at this time a rough quadrilateral, the two longer sides of which
measured some 1900 feet in length, the two shorter being about one-fourth
less. The southern face was constructed in a fashion common in brick build
ings in Egypt, being divided into alternate panels of horizontally laid courses,
and those in which the courses were concave ; on the north and west fagades
the bricks were so laid as to present an undulatiug arrangement running unin
terruptedly from one end to the other.^ The walls are 33 feet thick, and their
average height 27 feet ; broad and easy steps lead to the foot-walk on the top.
The gates are unsymmetrically placed, there being one on the north, east,
and west sides respectively ; while the southern side is left without an open
ing. These walls afforded protection to a dense but unequally distributed
population, the bulk of which was housed towards the north and west sides,
where the remains of an immense number of dwellings may still be seen.
The temples were crowded together in a small square enclosure, concentric
with the walls of the enceinte, and the principal sanctuary was dedicated to
Nekhabit, the vulture goddess, who gave her name to the city.® This
enclosure formed a kind of citadel, where the garrison could hold out when

the outer part had fallen into the enemy’s hands.^ The times were troublous ;
the open country was repeatedly wasted by w^ar, and the peasantry had more
than once to seek shelter behind the protecting ramparts of the town, leaving
their lands to lie fallow. Famine constantly resulted from these disturbances,
and it taxed all the powers of the ruling prince to provide at such times for
his people. A chief of the Commissariat, Bebi by name, who lived about this
period, gives us a lengthy account of the number of loaves, oxen, goats, and
pigs, which he allowed to all the inhabitants both great and little, down even to
the quantity of oil and incense, which he had taken care to store up for them ; his
prudence was ahvays justified by the issue, for “ during the many years in which
the famine recurred, he distributed grain in the city to all those who hungered.” ®

There are still some doubts as to the descent of this Ahmosi. Some authorities hold that Babai was the name of his father and Abina that of his grandfather (E.

Stern, in the Zeitschrift, 1885, p. 57) ; others, again, make out Babai and Abina to be variants of the same name, probably a Semitic one, borne by the father of Ahmosi (Brugsch, Gescliichte Mgijptens, p. 227, et seq. ; Krall, AUgyptische Studien, pp. 70, 71) ; the majority of modern Egyptologists (including myself) regard this last hypothesis as being the most probable one.



86 THE HYK8U8 IN EGYPT.
sepulchre, for the benefit of posterity, the most praiseworthy actions of his
long life. He had scarcely emerged from childhood when he was called upon
to act for his father, and before his marriage he was appointed to the command
of the barque The Calf. From thence he was promoted to the ship The Norths
and on account of his activity he was chosen to escort his namesake the king
on foot, whenever he drove in his chariot. He repaired to his post at the
moment when the decisive war against the Hyksos broke out.^ The tradition
current in the time of the Ptolemies reckoned the number of men under the
command of King Ahmosis when he encamped before Avaris at 480,000. This
immense multitude failed to bring matters to a successful issue, and the siege
dragged on indefinitely. The king at length preferred to treat with the
Shepherds, and gave them permission to retreat into Syria safe and sound,
together with their wives, their children, and all their goods.^ This account,
however, in no way agrees with the all too brief narration of events furnished
by the inscription in the tomb. The army to which Egypt really owed its
deliverance was not the undisciplined rabble of later tradition, but, on the con
trary, consisted of troops similar to those which subsequently invaded Syria, some
15,000 to 20,000 in number, fully equipped and ably officered, supported, more
over, by a fleet ready to transfer them across the canals and arms of the river in
a vigorous condition and ready for the battle.^ As soon as this fleet arrived at
the scene of hostilities, the engagement began. Ahmosi-si-Abina conducted the
manoeuvres under the king’s eye, and soon gave such evidence of his capacity,
that he was transferred by royal favour to the liising in Memphis —a vessel with
a high freeboard. . He was shortly afterwards appointed to a post in a division
told off for duty on the river Zadiku, which ran under the walls of the enemy’s
fortress,^ Two successive and vigorous attacks made in this quarter were barren
of important results. Ahmosi-si-Abina succeeded in each of the attacks in
killing an enemy, bringing back as trophies a hand of each of his victims, and
his prowess, made known to the king by one of the heralds, twice procured for
him “ the gold of valour,” probably in the form of collars, chains, or bracelets.®

Transport by water always played considerable part in the wars which were carried on in Egyptian territory ; I have elsewhere drawn attention to campaigns conducted in this manner under the Heracleopolitan dynasties (Maspeeo, Baimi of Civilization, pp. •156-4;58), and we shall see that the Ethiopian conquerors adopted the same mode of transit in the course of their invasion of Egypt. * The name of this canal was first recognised by Brugsch (Eeiseberichte aus NSgypten, p. 218), then misunderstood and translated “ the water bearing the name of the water of Avaris ” {Histoire d’Egypte, p. 81 ; cf. Chabas, Les Pasteurs en Egypte, p. 19). It is now read “ Zadikfl,” and, with the Egyptian article, Pa-zadikfl, or Pzadiku (Brugsch, Diet.

TEE TAKING OF AVARIS. 87
The assault having been repulsed in this quarter, the Egyptians made their
way towards the south, and came into conflict with the enemy at the village of
Taqimit.^ Here, again, the battle remained undecided, but Ahmosi-si-Abina
had an adventure. He had taken a prisoner, and in bringing him back lost
himself, fell into a muddy ditch, and, when he had freed himself from the
dirt as well as he could, pursued his way by mistake for some time in the

direction of Avaris. He found out his error, however, before it was too late, came
back to the camp safe and sound, and received once more some gold as a reward
of his brave conduct.^ A second attack upon the town was crowned with complete
success ; it was taken by storm, given over to pillage, and Ahmosi-si-Abina suc
ceeded in capturing one man and three women, who were afterwards, at the dis
tribution of the spoil, given to him as slaves.^ The enemy evacuated in haste the
last strongholds which they held in the east of the Delta, and took refuge
in the Syrian provinces on the Egyptian frontiei’. Whether it was that they

crushing blow before they could find time to breathe, or to rally around them
sufficient forces to renew the offensive, he made up his mind to cross the frontier,
which he did in the 5th year of his reign.^ It was the first time for centuries that
a Pharaoh had trusted himself in Asia, and the same dread of the unknown which
had restrained his ancestors of the XII® dynasty, doubtless arrested Ahmosis also
on the threshold of the continent. He did not penetrate further than the border
provinces of Zahi, situated on the edge of the desert, and contented himself with
pillaging the little town of Sharuhana.^ Ahmosi-si-Abina was again his com
panion, together with his cousin, Ahmosi-Pannekhabit, then at the beginning
of his career, who brought away on this occasion two young girls for his
household.^ The expedition having accomplished its purpose, the Egyptians
returned home with their spoil, and did not revisit Asia for a long period. If
the Hyksos generals had fostered in their minds the idea that they could
recover their lost ground, and easily re-enter upon the possession of their
African domain, this reverse must have cruelly disillusioned them. They
must have been forced to acknowledge that their power was at an end, and to
renounce all hope of returning to the country which had so summarily ejected
them. The majority of their own people did not follow them into exile, but re
mained attached to the soil on which they lived, and the tribes which had suc
cessively settled down beside them—including the Beni-Israel themselves—no
longer dreamed of a return to their fatherland. The condition of these people
varied according to their locality. Those who had taken up a position in the
plain of the Delta were subjected to actual slavery. Ahmosis destroyed the camp
at Avails, quartered his officers in the towns, and constructed forts at strategic
points, or rebuilt the ancient citadels to resist the incursions of the Bedouin. The
' Cliampollion’s copy is dated iu the year V. (Monuments de VEgypte et de la Nubie, vol. i. p. 656, 1. 14, as also that of Lepsius, Denlim,, iii. 12, d, 1. 14); Brugsch (Beiseberichten aus BSgypten, p. 218, and Geschichte JEgypten, p. 282) has read “ year VI.” According to Piehl (Notes de Philologie Egyptienne, in the Proceedings, 1892-93, vol. xv. p. 258), we ought to assume, not that Sharuhana was taken in the year V., but that tlie Egyptians besieged it for five years. 2 Sharuhana, whicli is mentioned again under Thutmosis III. (Lepsius, Benkm., iii. 31 b, 1. 12), is not the plain of Sharon, as Birch imagined (The Annals of Thotmes 111., as derived from the Hieroglyphical Inscriptions, p. 38), but the Sharuhen of the Biblical texts, in the tribe of Simeon (Josh. xix. 6), as Brugsch recognised it to be (Geographische Inschriften, vol. ii. p. 32). It is probably identical with the modern Tell-esh-Sheriah, which lies north-west of Beersheba. “ Inscription of El-Kab, 11. 13-15 ; Inscription of the statue of Ahmosi Pannekhabit, face A, 11. 3, 4. Ahmosi Pannekhabit lay in tomb No. 2, at El-Kab (Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte et de la Nubie, pi. cxlv. 4). His histery is briefly told on one of the walls (Ephrem Poitevin, Notice sur Ahmes, dit Pensouvan, in the Bevue Archdologique, 1st series, vol. xi. pp. 65-73; Lepsius, Benkm., iii. 43 a, 5), and on two sides of the pedestal of his statues. We have one of these, or rather two plates from the pedestal of one of them, in the Louvre (Peisse d’Avennes, Monuments Egyptiens, pi. iv. 2, 3 ; Lepsius, Auswahl der ivichtigsten Urkunden, pi. xiv. A, B ; cf. Birch, The Annals of Thoutmes III., as derived from the Hieroglyphical Inscriptions, pp. 33, 34; Chabas, Mdmoire sur les Pasteurs,pp. 22, 23; Brugsch, Geschichte JEgyptens, pp. 235, 236 ; C. di Cara, Gli Hyksos, pp. 328-330) ; the other is in a good state of preservation, and belongs to Mr. Finlay (MASPERO,iVb^es sur quelques Points de Grammaire, etc., § xliv., in the Zeitschrift, 1885, pp. 77, 78). The inscription is found in a mutilated condition on the wall of the tomb (Lepsius, Hcr/ito., iii. 43), but the three monuments which have come down tons are sufficiently complementary to one another to enable us to restore nearly the whole of the original text.

TEE WARS OF AEMOSIS L IN NUBIA.
vanquished people in the Delta, hemmed in as they were by a network of
fortresses, were thus reduced to a rabble of serfs, to be taxed and subjected to
the corvee without mercy. But further north, the fluctuating population which
roamed between the Sebennytic and Pelusiac branches of the Nile were not
exposed to such rough treatment. The marshes of the coast-line afforded them
a safe retreat, in which they could take refuge at the first threat of exactions
on the part of the royal emissaries. Secure within dense thickets, upon islands
approached by interminable causeways, often covered with water, or by long
tortuous canals concealed in the thick growth of reeds, they were able to defy
with impunity the efforts of the most disciplined troops, and treason alone
could put them at the mercy of their foes. Most of the Pharaohs felt that the
advantages to be gained by conquering them would be outweighed by the diffi
culty of the enterprise ; all that could result from a campaign would be the
destruction of one or two villages, the acquisition of a few hundred refractory
captives, of some ill-favoured cattle, and a trophy of nets and worm-eaten
boats. The kings, therefore, preferred to keep a close watch over these un
disciplined hordes, and as long as their depredations were kept within reason
able limits, they were left unmolested to their wild and precarious life.
The Asiatic invasion had put a sudden stop to the advance of Egyptian
rule in the vast plains of the Upper Nile. The Theban princes, to whom
Nubia was directly subject, had been too completely engrossed in the wars
against their hereditary enemy, to devote much time to the continuation of
that work of colonization in the south which had been carried on so vigorously
by their forefathers of the XII“^ and dynasties.^ The inhabitants
of the Nile valley, as far as the second cataract, rendered them obedience, but
without any change in the conditions and mode of their daily life, which
appear to have remained unaltered for centuries. The temples of Usirtasen
and Amenemhait were allowed to fall into decay one after another,^ the towns
waned in prosperity, and were unable to keep their buildings and monuments
in repair ; the inundation continued to bring with it periodically its fleet of
boats, which the sailors of Kush had laden with timber, gum, elephants’ tusks,
and gold dust ; from time to time a band of Bedouin from Uauait or Mazaiu
would suddenly bear down upon some village and carry off its spoils ; the nearest
garrison would be called to its aid, or, on critical occasions, the king himself,
at the head of his guards, would fall on the marauders and drive them back
into the mountains. Abmosis, being greeted on his return from Syria by
the news of such an outbreak, thought it a favourable moment to impress

upon the nomadic tribes of Nubia the greatness of bis conquest^ On this
occasion it was the people of Kbontbanunofir, settled in the wadys east of the
Nile, above Semneb, which required a lesson. The army which had just
expelled the Hyksos was rapidly conveyed to the opposite borders of the
country by the fleet, the two Ahmosi of Nekhabit occupying the highest
posts. The Egyptians, as was customary, landed at the nearest point to the
enemy’s territory, and succeeded in killing a few of the rebels. Ahmosi
si-Abina brought back two prisoners and three hands, for which he was
rewarded by a gift of two female Bedouin slaves, besides the “ gold of valour.”
This victory in the south following on such decisive success in the north,
filled the heart of the Pharaoh, with pride, and the view taken of it by
those who surrounded him is evident even in the brief sentences of the narra
tive. He is described as descending the river on the royal galley, elated in
spirit and flushed by his triumph in Nubia, which had followed so closely
on the deliverance of the Delta. But scarcely had he reached Thebes, when
an unforeseen catastrophe turned his confidence into alarm, and compelled him
to retrace his steps. It would appear that at the very moment when he was
priding himself on the successful issue of his Ethiopian expedition, one of
the sudden outbreaks, which frequently occurred in those regions, had cul
minated in a Sudanese invasion of Egypt, VVe are not told the name of
the rebel leader, nor those of the tribes who took part in it. The Egyptian
people, threatened in a moment of such apparent security by this inroad
of barbarians, regarded them as a fresh incursion of the Hyksos, and applied
to these southerners the opprobrious term of “ Fever-stricken,” already used to
denote their Asiatic conquerors. The enemy descended the Nile, committing
terrible atrocities, and polluting every sanctuary of the Theban gods which
came within their reach. They had reached a spot called Tentoa,^ before
they fell in with the Egyptian troops. Ahmosi-si-Abina again distinguished
himself in the engagement. The vessel which he commanded, probably the
Rising in Memi^his, ran alongside the chief galliot of the Sudanese fleet, and
took possession of it after a struggle, in which Ahmosi made two of the enemy’s
sailors prisoners with his own hand. The king generously rewarded those
whose valour had thus turned the day in his favour, for the danger had
appeared to him critical ; he allotted to every man on board the victorious
* Inscription of El-Kab, 11. 15-17. As to the position of the land of KonthanCinofir, cf. what is said in Maspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, p. 400. ^ The name of this locality does not occur elsewhere ; it would seem to refer, not to a village, but rather to a canal, or the branch of a river, or a harbour somewhere along the Nile. I am unable to locate it definitely, but am inclined to think we ought to look for it, if not in Egypt itself, at any rate in that part of Nubia which is nearest to Egypt. M. Revillout, taking up a theory which had been abandoned by Chabas {M^moire sur les Pasteurs, pp. 45, 46), and recognising in this expedition an offensive incursion of the Shepherds, suggests tliat Tantoa may be the modern Tantah in the Delta (Bevue Egyptologique, vol. vii. p. 82, n. 1).



TEE RESUMING OF BUILDING WORKS. 91
vessel five slaves, and five arura of land situated in his native province of
each respective] yd The invasion was not without its natural consequences to
Egypt itself. A certain Titianu, who appears to have been at the head of a
powerful faction, rose in rebellion at some place not named in the narrative,
but in the rear of the army. The rapidity with which Ahmosis repulsed the
Nubians, and turned upon his new enemy, completely baffled the latter’s
plans, and he and his followers were cut to pieces, but the danger had for the
moment been serious.^ It was, if not the last expedition undertaken in
this reign, at least the last commanded by the Pharaoh in person. By his
activity and courage Ahmosis had well earned the right to pass the remainder
of his days in peace.
A revival of military greatness always entailed a renaissance in art, followed
by an age of building activity. The claims of the gods upon the spoils of war
must be satisfied before those of men, because the victory and the booty obtained
through it were alike owing to the divine help given in battle. A tenth, there
fore, of the slaves, cattle, and precious metals was set apart for the service of
the gods, and even fields, towns, and provinces were allotted to them, the
produce of which was applied to enhance the importance of their cult or to repair
and enlarge their temples. The main body of the building was strengthened,
halls and pylons were added to the original plan, and the impulse once given
to architectural work, the co-operation of other artificers soon followed.
Sculptors and painters whose art had been at a standstill for generations
during the centuries of Egypt’s humiliation, and whose hands had lost their
cunning for want of practice, were now once more in demand. They had
probably never completely lost the technical knowledge of their calling, and
the ancient buildings furnished them with various types of models, which they
had but to copy faithfully in order to revive their old traditions. A few years
after this revival a new school sprang up, whose originality became daily more
patent, and whose leaders soon showed themselves to be in no way inferior to
* Inscription of El-Kab, 11. 17-21. * Inscription of El-Kab, 11. 21-23. The wording of the text is to much condensed that it is difficult to be sure of its meaning. Modern scholars agree with Brugsch (Reisebericlite aus RUgypten, pp. 219,. 220, and Geschichte Mgyptem, p. 233) that Titianu is the name of a man, but several .Egyptologists believe its bearer to have been chief of the Ethiopian tribes (Wiedemann, .Egyptisclie Geschichte, pp. 309, 310), while others think him to have been a rebellious Egyptian prince (Ebman, .^gypten und Mgyptisches Leben, p. 152 ; Maspero, Histoire Ancienne des Peuples de VOrient, Ith edit., p. 170), or a king of the Shepherds (Eevillout, Revue Egyptologique, vol. vii. p. 82, note 1), or give up the task of identification in despair (Chabas, MCmoire sur les Pasteurs en Egypte, p. 46). The tortuous wording of the text, and the expressions which occur in it, seem to indicate that the rebel was a prince of the royal blood, and even that the name he bears was not his real one. Later on we shall find that, on a similar occasion, the official documents refer to a prince who took part in a plot against Eamses III. by the fictitious name of Pentauirit (Deveria, Le Papyrus judiciare de Turin, pp. 60-63, 155, 156) ; Titianu was probably a nickname of the same kind inserted in place of the real name. It seems that,, in cases of high treason, the criminal not only lost his life, but his name was proscribed both in this world and in the next.



1)2 THE BEGINNING OF THE XVIII''" DYNASTY.
the masters of the older schools. Ahraosis could not be accused of ingratitude
to the gods ; as soon as his wars allowed him the necessary leisure, he began
his work of temple-building. The accession to power of the great Theban
families had been of little advantage to Thebes itself. Its Pharaohs, on
assuming the sovereignty of the whole valley, had not hesitated to abandon
their native city, and had made Heracleopolis, the Fayum or even Memphis,
their seat of government, only returning to Thebes in the time of the
dynasty, when the decadence of their power had set in. The honour of
furnishing rulers for its country had often devolved on Thebes, but the city had
reaped but little benedt from the fact ;
^ this time, however, the tide of fortune
was to be turned. The other cities of Egypt had come to regard Thebes as
their metropolis from the time when they had learned to rally round its
princes to wage Avar against the Hyksos. It had been the last town to lay
down arms at the time of the invasion, and the first to take them up again in
the struggle for liberty. Thus the Egypt which vindicated her position
among the nations of the world was not the Egypt of the Memphite dynasties.
It was the great Egypt of the Amenemhaits and the Usirtasens, still further
aggrandised by recent victories. Thebes was her natural capital, and its
kings could not have chosen a more suitable position from whence to command
elFectually the whole empire. Situated at an equal distance from both frontiers,
the Pharaoh residing there, on the outbreak of a war either in the north or
south, had but half the length of the country to traverse in order to reach the
scene of action. Ahmosis spared no pains to improve the city, but his
resources did not allow of his embarking on any very extensive schemes ; he
did not touch the temple of Amon, and if he undertook any buildings in
its neighbourhood, they must have been minor edifices. He could, indeed,
have had but little leisure to attempt much else, for it was not till the XXI1“‘’
year of his reign that he was able to set seriously to work.^ An opportunity
then occurred to revive a practice long fallen into disuse under the foreign
kings, and to set once more in motion an essential part of the machinery of
Egyptian administration. The quarries of Turah, as is well known, enjoyed
the privilege of furnishing the finest materials to the royal architects
nowhere else could be found limestone of such whiteness, so easy to cut, or so
calculated to lend itself to the carving of delicate inscriptions and bas-reliefs.^
The commoner veins had never ceased to be worked by private enterprise,
‘ Cf. wliat is said in regard to this neglect of Thebes in Maspero, Daivn of Civilization, pp. 464, 528. ^ E. DE Rouge, Etude des Monuments du Massif de Karnali, in the MAanges d’ Arch^ulogie Egyptienne et Assyrienne, vol. i. p. 41. In the inscription of the year XXII., Ahmosis expressly states that he opened new chambers in the quarries of Turah for the works in connection with the Theban Amon, .as well as for those of the temple of the Memphite Phtah (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 3 a, 11. 3, 4). ^ Cf. what is said in regard to the Turah limestone in Maspero, Daimi of Civilization, pp. 383, 384.

gangs of quarrymen being always employed, as at the present day, in cutting
small stone for building purposes, or in ruthlessly chipping it to pieces to
burn for lime in the kilns of the neighbouring villages ; but the finest veins
were always kept for State purposes. Contemporary chroniclers might have
formed a very just estimate of national prosperity by the degree of activity
shown in working these royal preserves ; when the amount of stone extracted
was lessened, prosperity was on the wane, and might be pronounced to be at its
lowest ebb when the noise of the quarryman’s hammer finally ceased to be
heard. Every dynasty whose resources were such as to justify their resumption
of the work proudly recorded the fact on stelse which lined the approaches to

the masons’ yards. Ahmosis reopened the Turah quarry-chambers, and pro
cured for himself “ good stone and white ” for the temples of Amon at Thebes
and of Phtah at Memphis. No monument has as yet been discovered to throw
any light on the fate of Memphis subsequent to the time of the Amenemhaits.
It must have suffered quite as much as any city of the Delta from the Shepherd
invasion, and from the wars which preceded their expulsion, since it was
situated on the highway of an invading army, and would offer an attraction
for pillagers. By a curious turn of fortune it was the “ Fankhui,” or Asiatic
prisoners, who were set to quarry the stone for the restoration of the
monuments which their own forefathers had reduced to ruins.^ The bas-reliefs
sculptured on the stelse of Ahmosis show them in full activity under the corvee ;
we see here the stone block detached from the quarry being squared by the
chisel, or transported on a sledge drawn by oxen.^

Abmosis had several children by his various wives ; six at least owned
Nofritari for their mother and possessed near claims to the crown, but
she may have borne him others whose existence is unrecorded. The
eldest appears to have been a son, Sipiri ; he received all the honours
due to an hereditary prince, but died without having reigned,^ and his
second brother, Amenhotpu—called by the Greeks Amenothes^—took his
place. Ahmosis was laid to rest in the chapel which he had prepared for
himself in the cemetery of Drah-abu’l-Neggah, among the modest pyramids
of the XP^, XIIP‘, and XVII*'* dynasties.® He was venerated as a god,
-and his cult was continued for six or eight centuries later, until the in
creasing insecurity of the Theban necropolis at last necessitated the removal
of the kings from their funeral chambers.'* The coffin of Ahmosis was found
to be still intact, though it was a poorly made one, shaped to the contours of
the body, and smeared over with yellow ; it represents the king with the false
beard depending from his chin, and his breast covered with a pectoral ornament,
the features, hair, and accessories being picked out in blue. His name has
been hastily inscribed in ink on the front of the winding-sheet, and when the
lid was removed, garlands of faded pink flowers were still found about the neck,
laid there as a last offering by the priests who placed the Pharaoh and his
compeers in their secret burying-place.® Amenothes I. had not attained his
majority when his father “thus winged his way to heaven,” leaving him as heir

mann, Zur XXI dynastie Manetho’s, in the Zeitschrift, 1882, pp. 86-88); the true Greek transcription -of the Ptolemaic epoch, corresponding to the pronunciation Amenhotpe, or Amenhopte, is Amenothes (Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d’Histoire, § xxsvi., in the Zeitschrift, 1882, pp. 128, 129). Under the XVIIP'' dynasty the cuneiform transcription of the tablets of Tel-el Amarna, Amankhatbi, seems to indicate the pronunciation Amanhautpi, Amanhatpi, side by side with the pronunciation Amauhautpu, Amenhotpu. ^ The precise site is at present unknown : we see, however, that it was in tliis place, when we observe that Ahmosis was worshipped by the Servants of the Necropolis, amongst the kings and princes of his family who were biuded at Drah-abuT-Neggah (Lepsids, Denhm., iii. 2 a, b). ' His priests ami the minor employ€s of his cult are mentioned on a stele in the museum at Turin (No. 85, Obcuuti, Catalogo lllustrato dei Monumenti Egizii, vol. ii. pp. 42, 43), and on a brick iu the Berlin Museum (Lepsids, Denhm., iii. 25, his E). He is worshipped as a god, along with Osiris, Horus, and Isis, on a stele in the Lyons Museum (Deveria, Notices sur les Antiques Egyptiennes du MusCe de Lyon, pp. 12, 13, and pi. ii.. No. 85), brought from Abydos : he had, probably, during one of his journeys across Egypt, made a donation to the temple of that city, on condition that he should be worshipped there for ever ; for a stele at Marseilles shows him offering homage to Osiris in the bark of the god itself (Maspero, Catalogue du Musee Egyptien de Marseille, No. 32, pp. 20, 21), and another stele in the Louvre informs us that Pharaoh Thutmosis IV. several times sent one of his messengers to Abydos for the purjiose of presenting land to Osiris and to his own ancestor Ahmosis (C 53, in I’lERRET, Recueil d’ Inscriptions in^dites du Musde Egyptien du Louvre, vol. ii. pp. 14, 15). ^ Maspero, Les Momies royales de Deir-el-Bahari, in the M^moire de la Mission, vol. i. pp. 533, 535.

majority of them are for feminine use ; a fan with a handle plated with gold, a
mirror of gilt bronze with ebony handle, bracelets and ankle-rings, some of solid
and some of hollow gold, edged with fine chains
of plaited gold wire, others formed of beads of
gold, lapis-lazuli, cornelian, and green felspar,
many of them engraved with the cartouche of
Ahmosis. Belonging also to Ahmosis we have
a beautiful quiver, in which figures of the king
and the gods stand out in high relief on a gold
plaque, delicately chased with a graving tool ;
the background is formed of small pieces of lapis
and blue glass, cunningly cut to fit each other.
One bracelet in particular, found on the queen’s
wrist, consisted of three parallel bands of solid
gold set with turquoises, and having a vulture
with extended wings on the front. The queen’s
hair was held in place by a gold circlet, scarcely
as large as a bracelet ; a cartouche was affixed
to the circlet, bearing the name of Ahmosis in
blue paste, and flanked by small sphinxes, one
on each side, as supporters. A thick flexible
chain of gold was passed several times round
her neck, and attached to it as a pendant was
a beautiful scarab, partly of gold and partly of
blue porcelain striped with gold. The breast

one of gold and one of silver, originally intended for the Pharaoh Kamosu

Nofritari thus reigned conjointly with Amenothes, and even if we have
no record of any act in which she was specially concerned, we know at least
that her rule was a prosperous one, and that her memory was revered by
her subjects. While the majority of queens were relegated after death to
the crowd of shadowy ancestors to whom habitual sacrifice was offered, the
worshippers not knowing even to which sex these royal personages belonged,
the remembrance of Nofritari always remained distinct in their minds, and
her cult spread till it might be said to have become a kind of popular
religion. In this veneration Ahmosis was rarely associated with the queen,
but Amenothes^ and several of her other children shared in it—her son
Sipiri, for instance,'^ and her daughters Sitamon,® Sitkamosi,® and Maritamon ;
Nofritari became, in fact, an actual goddess, taking her place beside Amon,
Khonsu, and Maut,® the members of the Theban Triad, or standing alone as
an object of worship for her devotees.^ She was identified with Isis, Hathor,
and the mistresses of Hades, and adopted their attributes, even to the black or

and in that of Unnofir, at Sheikh Abd el-Qurnah (Id., ibid., p. 524). Her face is painted blue in the tomb of Kasa (Wiedemann, Tombs of the Dyn. at Der el-Medineh, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1886, vol. viii. p. 226). The representations of this queen with a black skin have caused her to be taken for a negress, the daughter of an Ethiopian Pharaoh (Rosellini, Monumenti Storici, vol. iii. 1, p. 92 ; Aeundale-Bonomi-Birch, Gallery of Antiquities, ii. p. 74 ; Beugsch, Hist. d’Egypte, pp. 85, 86 ; Lepsius, Briefe aus AEgypten, p. 268 ; Wiedemann, Mgyptisclie Geschichte, p. 309), or at any rate the daughter of a chief of some Nubian tribe (Ed. Meter, Geschichte JEgyptens, p. 224, note 1) ; it was thought that Ahmosis must have married her to secure the help of the negro tribes in his wars, and that it was owing to this alliance that he succeeded in expelling the Hyksos. Later discoveries have not confirmed these hypotheses. Nofritari was most probably an Egyptian of unmixed race, as we have seen, and daughter of Ahhotpu I. (see p. 77 of this volume), and the black or blue colour of her skin is merely owing to her identification with the goddesses of the dead (Beugsch, Gesch. Mgyptens, pp. 259, 260 ; Lauth, Aus AUgyptens Vorzeit, pp. 245, 246). * The monuments connected with her priests, her cultus, and the appanage of her tomb are enumerated exhaustively in Wiedemann, Mgypt.

of which are painted blue on a yellow background. The Queen’s hands are
crossed over her breast, and clasp the crux ansata, the symbol of life. The whole
mummy-case measures a little over nine feet from the sole of the feet to the
top of the head, which is furthermore surmounted by a cap, and two long ostrich
feathers. The appearance is not so much that of a coffin as of one of those
enormous caryatides which we sometimes find adorning the front of a temple.^
We may perhaps attribute to the influence of Nofritari the lack of zest
evinced by Amenothes for expeditions into Syria. Even the most energetic
kings had always shrunk from penetrating much beyond the isthmus. Those
who ventured so far as to work the mines of Sinai had nevertheless felt a secret
fear of invading Asia proper—a dread which they never succeeded in overcoming.
When the raids of the Bedouin obliged the Egyptian sovereign to cross the
frontier into their territory, he would retire as soon as possible, without
attempting any permanent conquest.^ After the expulsion of the Hyksos,
Ahmosis seemed inclined to pursue a less timorous course. He made an
advance on Sharfihana and pillaged it, and the booty he brought back ought
to have encouraged him to attempt more important expeditions ; but he never
returned to this region, and it would seem that when his first enthusiasm had
subsided, he was paralysed by the same fear which had fallen on his ancestors.
Nofritari may have counselled her son not to break tlirough the traditions
which his father had so strictly followed, for Amenothes I. confined his
campaigns to Africa, and the traditional battle-fields there. He embarked for
the land of Kush on the vessel of Ahmosi-si-Abina “ for the purpose of enlarging
the frontiers of Egypt.” It was, we may believe, a thoroughly conventional
campaign, conducted according to the strictest precedents of the XIP'’ dynasty.
The Pharaoh, as might be expected, came into personal contact with the enemy,
and slew their chief with his own hand ; the barbarian warriors sold their
lives dearly, but were unable to protect their country from pillage, the victors
carrying off whatever they could seize^— men, women, and cattle. The pursuit
of the enemy had led the army some distance into the desert, as far as a halting
place called the “Upper cistern ”—KlmmnU hirit; instead of retracing his
.steps to the Nile squadron, and returning slowly by boat, Amenothes resolved
to take a short cut homewards. Ahmosi conducted him back overland in
two days, and was rewarded for his speed by the gift of a quantity of gold,
and two female slaves.® An incursion into Libya followed quickly on the

and the Oasis of Amon, had probably attacked in an audacious manner the
western provinces of the
Delta ;
^ a raid was organ
ized against them, and the
issue was commemorated by
a small wooden stele, on
which we see the victor
represented as brandishing
his sword over a barbarian
lying prostrate at his feet.^
The exploits of Amenothes
appear to have ended with
this raid, for we possess no
monument recording any
further victory gained by
him. This, however, has not
prevented his contemporaries
from celebrating him as a
conquering and victorious

102 THE BEGINNING OF THE XVIIF^^ DYNASTY.
These are, indeed, but conventional pictures
of war, to which we must not attach an
undue importance. Egypt had need
of repose in order to recover from the
losses it had sustained during the
years of struggle with the invaders.
If Amenothes courted peace from
preference and not from political
motives, his own generation profited
as much by his indolence as the pre
ceding one had gained by the energy
of Ahmosis. The towns in his reign
resumed their ordinary life, agriculture
flourished, and commerce again fol
lowed its accustomed routes. Egypt
increased its resources, and was thus
able to prepare for future conquest.
The taste for building had not as yet
sufliciently developed to become a drain upon the public treasury. We have,
however, records showing that Amenothes excavated a cavern in the mountain
of Ibrim in Nubia, dedicated to Satit, one of the goddesses of the cataract.^ It
is also stated that he worked regularly the quarries of Silsileli, but we do not
know for what buildings the sandstone thus extracted was destined.^ Karnak
was also adorned with chapels, and with at least one colossus,^ while several
chambers built of the white limestone of Thrah were added to Ombos.® Thebes
had thus every reason to cherish the memory of this pacific king. As Nofritari
had been metamorphosed into a form of Isis, Amenothes was similarly

No. 480). * The chambers of white limestone are marked I, K, on Mariette’s plan {Karnak, pi. v.); it is possible that they may have been merely decorated under Thutmosis III., whose cartouches alternate with those of Amenothes I. (Mariette, Karnak, pp. 31, 37). The colossus is now in front of the third Pylon, and Wiedemann concluded from this fact that Amenothes had begun extensive works for enlarging the temple of Amon {Mgyptische Geschichte, p. 318) ; Mariette believed, with greater probability, that the colossus formerly stood at the entrance to the XIP'* dynasty temple, but was removed to its present position by Thhtmosis III. {Karnak, pp. 27, note 3, 60), “ Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Gram, et d’Hist., in the Zeitschrift, 1883, p. 78; the fragments have since disappeared (Morgan, Catalogue des Monuments, vol. ii. p. 1).

represented as Osiris, the protector of the Necropolis, and he was depicted as
such with the sombre colour of the funerary divinities ;
^ his image, moreover,
together with those of the other gods, was used to decorate the interiors of
coffins, and to protect the mummies of his devotees.^ One of his statues, now
in the Turin Museum, represents him sitting on his throne in the posture of a
king giving audience to his subjects, or in that of a god receiving the homage
of his worshippers. The modelling of the bust betrays a flexibility of handling
which is astonishing in a work of art so little removed from barbaric times ; the
head is a marvel of delicacy and natural grace. We feel that the sculptor
has taken a delight in chiselling the features of his sovereign, and in repro
ducing the benevolent and almost dreamy expression which characterised them.^
The cult of Amenothes lasted for seven or eight centuries, until the time
when his coffin was removed and placed with those of the other members of his
family in the place where it remained concealed until our own times.® It is
’ Drawn by Faucber-Gudiu, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey, taken in 1882. " The cult of Amenothes I. and the principal monuments which are as yet known connected
with it are given in Wiedemann, AUgyptische GescMchte, pp. 319, 320. A black Amenothes, followed by his son Sipiri, is reproduced in Kosellini, Monumenti Storioi, vol. iii. 1, pp. 88-106, pi. xxix. 3. “ Wiedemann (ASgyptisclie GescMchte^ p. 319) has collected several examples, to which it would be easy to add others. The names of the king are in this case constantly accompanied by unusual epithets, which are enclosed in one or other of his cartouches : Mons. Eevillout, deceived by these unfamiliar forms, has made out of one of these variants, ona painted cloth in the Louvre, a new Amenothes,
whom he styles Amenothes V. {Le RoiAmenopMs F.,in the Bulletin des Musdes, vol. i. pp. 112-114). For
“ Pa-abiti-ni-Amon,” a surname of the deified Amenothes L, frequently met with, and signifying “ the intimate friend or image of Amon,” see Lepsius, Denltm., iii. 2 &, o ; and cf. A. B.

the face resembles that of his statue, and the eyes of enamel, touched with
kohl, give it a wonderful appearance of animation. The body is swathed in
orange-coloured linen, kept in place by bands of brownish linen, and is further
covered by a mask of wood and cartonnage, painted to match the exterior of
the coffin. Long garlands of faded flowers deck the mummy from head to
foot. A wasp, attracted by their scent, must have settled upon them at the
moment of burial, and become imprisoned by the lid ; the insect has been
completely preserved from corruption by the balsams of the embalmer, and
its gauzy wings have passed uncrumpled through the long centuries.^
Amenothes had married Ahhotpu II., his sister by the same father and
mother;^ Ahmasi,the daughter born of this union, was given in marriage to Thut
mosis, one of her brothers, the son of a mere concubine, by name Sonisonbu.®
Ahmasi, like her ancestor Nofritari, had therefore the right to exercise all the
royal functions, and she might have claimed precedence of her husband. Whether
from conjugal affection or from weakness of character, she yielded, however, the
priority to Thutmosis, and allowed him to assume the sole government. He was
crowned at Thebes on the 21st of the third month of Pirit ; and a circular,
addressed to the representatives of the ancient seignorial families and to the
officers of the crown, announced the names assumed by the new sovereign.
“ This is the royal rescript to announce to you that my Majesty has arisen
king of the twm Egypts, on the seat of the Horus of the living, without equal,
for ever, and that my titles are as follows : The vigorous bull Horus, beloved
of Mait, the Lord of the Vulture and of the Urmus who raises itself as a flame,
most valiant,—the golden Horus, whose years are good and who puts life into
all hearts, king of the two Egypts, Akhopirkeri, sou of the Sun, Thutmosis,

The remains of it have not yet been discovered. ' Masi’ero, Les Momies royules, in the M^moires de la Mission Franyaise, vol. i. pp. 536, 537. * Ahhotptt II. may be seen beside lier husband on several monuments given by Wiedemann, .Egypt. Gescliiclite, pp. 316, 317. The proof that she was full sister of Amenothes I. is furnished by the title of “hereditary princess” which is given to her daughter Ahmasi; this princess would not have taken precedence of her brother and husband Thutmosis, who was the sou of an inferior wife, had she not been the daughter of the only legitimate spouse of Amenothes I. The marriage had already taken place before the accession of Thvitmosis I., as Ahmasi figures in a document dated the first year of his reign (FmiA.s,Rundschreiben Thutmosis' I an die Behorden mit der Anzeige seines Itcgierungsantrittcs, in the Zeitschrift, ,\ol. xxix. p. 117). * Eeman, ibid., in the Zeitschrift, vol. xxix. pp. 117-119. The absence of any cartouche shows that Sonisonbfi did not belong to the royal family, and the very form of the name points her out to have been of the middle classe8,'aud merely a concubine. The accession of her son, however, ennobled her, and he represents her as a queen on the walls of the temple at Deir el-Bahaii (Naville, The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, etc., pp. 12-14); even then he merely styles her “ Royal Mother,” the only title she
could really claim, as her inferior position in the harem prevented her from using that of “ Royal Spouse. ’ * This is really the protocol of the king, as we find it on the monuments (Lepsius, Konigsbuch, pi. xxiv.), with his two Horus names and his solar titles.

be conquered in that direction was scarcely worth the trouble of reducing to
a province or of annexing as a colony ; it comprised a number of tribes hope
lessly divided among themselves, and consequently, in spite of their renowned
bravery, without power of resistance. Light columns of troops, drafted at
intervals on either side of the river, ensured order among the submissive, or
despoiled the refractory of their possessions in cattle, slaves, and precious stones.
Thutmosis I. had to repress, however, very shortly after his accession, a revolt
of these borderers at the second and third cataracts, but they were easily over
come in a campaign of a few days’ duration, in which the two Ahmosis of
El-Kab took an honourable part. There was, as usual, au encounter of the
two fleets in the middle of the river ; the young king himself attacked the
enemy’s chief, pierced him with his first arrow, and made a considerable
number of prisoners. Thutmosis had the corpse of the chief suspended as a
trophy in front of the royal ship, and sailed northwards towards Thebes, where,
however, he was not destined to remain long.^ An ample field of action
presented itself to him in the north-east, affording scope for great exploits,
as profitable as they were glorious.^ Syria offered to Egyptian cupidity a
virgin prey in its large commercial towns inhabited by an industrious popu
lation, who by maritime trade and caravan traffic had amassed enormous
wealth. The country had been previously subdued by the Chaldteans, who still
exercised an undisputed influence over it, and it was but natural that the
conquerors of the Hyksos should act in their turn as invaders. The incursion
of Asiatics into Egypt thus provoked a reaction which issued in an Egyptian
invasion of Asiatic soil. Thutmosis and his contemporaries had inherited
none of the instinctive fear of penetrating into Syria which influenced
Ahmosis and his successor : the Theban legions were, perhaps, slow to advance,

Gazzera does not say that the object in question was discovered at Bleroe, but only that the wood out of which it is cut is wood from Meroii, “ un pezzetto di legno duro di Bleroe, tagliato in forma di stele.” The date of “ I’anno ventisei,” attributed to this monument, is not in reality traced on it, but the Italian author, applying au erroneous hypothesis of Champollion’s, counted the spikes on the palm stems surrounding the stele; as there are twenty-six on each side, he thought that the Egyptian draughtsman intended to notify in this manner the twenty-sixth year of the king’s reign.

That this expedition must be placed at the beginning of the king’s reign, in his first year, is shown by two facts: (1) It precedes the Syrian campaign in the biography of the two Ahmosis of El-Kab; (2) the Syrian campaign must have ended in the second year of the reign, since Thfitmosis I., on the stole of Tombos which bears that date (Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 5 a, 11. 13, 14), gives particulars of the course of the Euphrates, and records the submission of the countries watered by that river (E.

warfare and pillaging expeditions from the plains of the Blue Nile to those
of the Euphrates, so that scarcely a year passed without bringing to the city
of Amon its tribute of victories and riches gained at the point of the sword.
One day the news would be brought that the Amorites or the Khati had
taken the field, to be immediately followed by the announcement that their
forces had been shattered against the valour of the Egyptian battalions.
Another day. Pharaoh would re-enter the city with the flower of his generals

The date of the invasion may be placed between 2300 and 2250 b.o. ; if we count 661 years for the three dynasties together, as Erman proposes (Zur Chronologie der EyTcsoSym the Zeiisc^rz/i, 1879, pp. 125-127), we find that the accession of Ahmosis would fall between 1640 and 1590 (see p. 73, note 1, of the present volume). I should place it provisionally in the year 1600, in order not to leave the position of the succeeding reigns uncertain ; I estimate the possible error at about half a century.

of the altars, while fantastic processions of richly clothed captives, beasts led
by halters, and slaves bending under the weight of the spoil would stretch in
an endless line behind him. Meanwhile the Timihu, roused by some unknown
cause, would attack the outposts stationed on the frontier, or news would come
that the Peoples of the Sea had landed on the western side of the Delta ; the
Pharaoh had again to take the field, invariably with the same speedy and
successful issue. The Libyans seemed to fare no better than the Syrians, and
before long those who had survived the defeat would be paraded before the
Theban citizens, previous to being sent to join the Asiatic prisoners in the mines
or quarries ; their blue eyes and fair hair showing from beneath strangely
shaped helmets, while their white skins, tall stature, and tattooed bodies excited
for a few hours the interest and mirth of the idle crowd. At another time, one
of the customary raids into the land of Kush would take place, consisting of a
rapid march across the sands of the Ethiopian desert and a cruise along the
coasts of Puanit. This would be followed by another triumphal procession, in
which fresh elements of interest would appear, heralded by flourish of trumpets
and roll of drums ; Pharaoh would re-enter the city borne on the shoulders of
his officers, followed by negroes heavily chained, or coupled in such a way that
it was impossible for tliem to move without grotesque contortions, while the
acclamations of the multitude and the chanting of the priests would resound
from all sides as the cortege passed through the city gates on its way to the
temple of Amon. Egypt, roused as it were to warlike frenzy, hurled her armies
across all her frontiers simultaneously, and her sudden appearance in the heart
of Syria gave a new turn to human history. The isolation of the kingdoms
of the ancient world was at an end ; the conflict of the nations was about to
begin.

rpHE world beyond the Arabian desert presented to the eyes
of the enterprising Pharaohs an active and bustling
scene. Babylonian civilization still maintained its hold
there without a rival, but Babylonian rule had ceased
to exercise any longer a direct control, having probably
disappeared with the sovereigns who had introduced it.
When Ammisatana died, about the year 2099, the line of
Khammurabi became extinct, and a family from the Sea-lands
came into power.^ This unexpected revolution of affairs did
not by any means restore to tlie cities of Lower Chaldtea the
supreme authority which they once possessed. Babylon had
made such good use of its centuries of rule that it had gained
upon its rivals, and was not likely now to fall back
into a secondary place. Henceforward, no matter what
dynasty came into power, as soon as the fortune of war had placed it upon
the throne, Babylon succeeded in adopting it, and at once made it its own.

Champollion, Monuments de V£gypte et de la Nuhie, pi. cclxvii. 2; Kosellini, Monumenti Storici, pi. clvii. The origin of this second dynasty and the reading of its name still afford matter for discussion. The name was provisionally written Shishku, Sisku, by Pinches, who was the first to discover it {Notes on a Neio List of Early Babylonian Kings, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1880-81, vol. iii. pp. 21, 22) ; it was at once connected by Lauth {Remarks on the Name Shishku, ibid., 1880-81, vol. iii. pp. 46-48) with the name Sheshach, which signifies Babylon in Jeremiah (ch. xxv. 26 and

The new lord of the country, Ilumailu, having abandoned his patrimonial
inheritance, came to reside near to Merodachd He was followed during
the four next centuries by a dynasty of ten princes, in uninterrupted suc
cession. Their rule was introduced and maintained without serious oppo
sition. The small principalities of the south were theirs by right, and
the only town which might have caused them any trouble—Assur—was de
pendent on them, being satisfied with the title of vicegerents for its princes,
Khallu, Irishum, Ismidagan and his son Samsiramman I., Igurkapkapu and
his son Samsiramman As to the course of events beyond the Khabur,
and any efforts Ilumailu’s descendants may have made to establish their
authority in the direction of the Mediterranean, we have no inscriptions to
inform us, and must be content to remain in ignorance. The last two of these
princes, Melamkurkurra and Eagamil, were not connected with each other,
and had no direct relationship with their predecessors.^ The shortness of their

But Shesliacli is only an indirect way of writing Babel by athash, and Pinches had observed that the group might be read Shishazag, tJruazag, or TJruku, as well as Shishku : the reading Uruku even inclined H. Eawlinson to make Uruk-Erech the cradle of the 11'“' Bab3doniau dynasty {Proceedings, 1880-81, vol. iii. pp. 48, 49). Eastlake endeavoured to prove by means of philology what excellent grounds there were for this comparison {Uruku versus Shishku, ibid., 1881-82, vol. iv. pp. 3G-40), which Tielo declares improbable {Bahylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, p. 104); while Hoinmel, after having inclined for a short time to the reading Uruazagga {Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 109, 352), now declares Uruku to be nearly certain {A Supplementary Note to Gibil-Gamish, in the Proceedings, 1893-94, vol. xvi. pp. 13-15). Fr. Delitzsch accepts the reading Uruazagga and recognizes Babylon in it, but Winckler {Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 07, 68, 327, 328) believes it to be merely the name of a district of Babylon, where the dynasty may have originated. Finallj^ llilprecht {Assyriaca, vol. i. pp. 25-28, 101-108) asserts, from Knudtzon’s copy {Assyrische Gebeie an den Sonnengott, vol. i. p. 60), that the second sign in the name is the syllable kha; and while recognizing the attractiveness of H. Kawlinson’s and Hommel’s hyiiothesis, declares himself unable to affirm anything concerning the value and the true signification of the group written Shish-kha. Among these conflicting opinions, it behoves us to remember that Gulkisliar, the only prince of this dynasty whose title we possess, calls himself King of the Country of the Sea, that is to say, of the marshy country at the mouth of the Euphrates (Hilpeecht, Babyl. Exped. of University of Pennsylvania, vol. i. pi. 30, 11. 3, G) : this simple fact directs us to seek the cradle of the family in those districts of Southern Chaldrea (Hilpeecht, Assyriaca,\o\. i. pp. 24-29). Sayce rejects this identification on philological and chronological grounds, and sees in Gulkishar, “King of the Sea-lands,” a vassal Kalda prince {Academy, March 2, 1895). ‘ The name has been read An-ma-an or Anmau by Pinches (iVbteso)i a Neio List of Early Babylonian Kings, in Proc. Bib. Arch. Soc., 1880-81, vol. iii. pp. 43-45 ; cf. Hilpeecht, Assyriaca,\ol. i. pp. 101-106), subsequently Ilumailu (in Fe. Delitzsch-Muedter, Gesch. Bab. und Assyr., 2nd ed..

The true reading of it is still unknown. Hommel believed ho had discovered in Hilprecht’s book {Bab. Exp. of Univ. of Pennsylv., vol. i. pi. 15, No. 26) an inscription belonging to the reign of this prince ; but Hilprecht {Assyriaca, vol. i. pp. 101-106) has shown that it belonged to a king of Erech, An-a-an, anterior to the time of An-ma-an.

and probably indicates a period of war or revolution. When these princes
disappeared, we know not how or why, about the year 1714 B.C., they were
succeeded by a king of foreign extraction ; and one of the semi-barbarous race
of Kashshu ascended the throne which had been occupied since the days of
Kliammurabi by Chaldseans of ancient stockd
These Kashshu, who spring up suddenly out of obscurity, had from the
earliest times inhabited the mountainous districts of Zagros, on the confines
of Elymai’s and Media, where the Cossmans of the classical historians flourished
in the time of Alexander.^ It was a rugged and unattractive country, protected
by nature and easy to defend, made up as it was of narrow' tortuous valleys,
of plains of moderate extent but of rare fertility, of mountain chains whose
grim sides were covered with forests, and whose peaks were snow-crowned during

Gulkishar mentioned in this place is identical with the one in the lists (GulJcischar—Muabbit

aiitumn. The entrance to this region was by two or three well-fortified passes
if an enemy w'ere unwilling to incur the loss of time and men needed to carry
these by main force, he had to mahe a detour by narrow goat-tracks, along
which the assailants were obliged to advance in single file, as best they could,
exposed to the assaults of a foe concealed among the rocks and trees,
Tlie tribes who were entrenched behind this natural rampart made frequent
and unexpected raids upon the marshy meadows and fat pastures of
Chaldaea: they dashed through the country, pillaging and burning all that
came in their way, and then, quickly regaining their hiding-places, were
able to place their booty in safety before the frontier garrisons had re
covered from the first alarm These tribes were governed by numerous
chiefs acknowledging a single king ianzi—whose will was supreme over
nearly the whole country:^ some of them had a slight veneer of Chaldeean
civilization, while among the rest almost every stage of barbarism might
be found. The remains of their language show that it was remotely allied
to the dialect of Susa, and contained many Semitic words.^ What is recorded
of their religion reaches us merely at second hand, and the groundwork of it
has doubtless been modified by the Babylonian scribes who have transmitted
it to us,'^ They worshipped twelve great gods, of whom the chief—Kashshn,
the lord of heaven —gave his name to the principal tribe, and possibly to the
whole race ; ® Shumalia, queen of the snowy heights, was enthroned beside
' It was thus ill the time of Alexander and his successors (Polybius, V. xliv. 7 ; Diodorus Siculus, viii. Ill : Strabo, XI. xiii.,§ 6, p. 52-1, and XVI. i., § 13, 18, pp. 742, 744 ; Arrian, Anabasis, VII. XV. 1), and the information given by the classical historians about this jieriod is equally applicable to earlier times, as we may conclude from the numerous passages from Assyrian inscriptions which have been collected by Fr. Delitzsch, Die Sprache der Kossxer, pp. 2, 3, 30-33. 2 Delitzsch conjectures that Ianzi, or lanzu, had become a kind of proper name, analogous to the term Pharaoh employed by the Egyptians (Id., ibid., pp. 25, 29-38).
^ A certain number of Cosssean words has been preserved and translated, some in one of the
royal Babylonian lists (Rawlinson, Gun. Ins. W. As., vol. ii. pi. 45, No. 2, verso; Pinches, Notes on a New List of Early Babylonian Kings, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1880-81, vol. iii. pp.
38, 41), and some on a tablet in the British Museum, discovered and interpreted by Fr. Delitzsch ( Die Spraebe der Kossxer, pp. 23-29). Several Assyriologists think that they show a marked affinity
with the idiom of the Susa inscriptions, and with that of the Achtemenian inscriptions of the second
type (Sayce, The Languages of the Cuneiform Inscriptions of Elam and Media, in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. See., vol. iii. pp. 475, 47G ; Hommel, Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 275-278) ; others deny the proposed connection (Delitzsch, Die Sprache der Kossieer, pp. 39-50), or suggest that the Cossaean language was a Semitic dialect, related to the Chaldseo-Assyriau (OiTERT, La Langue des Elamites, in the Revue d' Assyriologie, vol. i. pp. 45-49 ; Halevy, Notes Assyriologiques, § 24. Les Cossgens et leur Langue, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. iv. pp.
207-222 ; cf. Revue Critique, 1884, vol. i. pp. 482-480). Oppert, who was the first to point out tlie existence of this dialect, thirty years ago, believed it to be the Elamite (Expg'dition de Mg’sopotamie, vol. i. p. 275) : he still persists in his opinion, and has published several notes in defence of it, the principal of which is La Langue Oissienne ou Cassite non Coss^enne {Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. iii.
pp 421-423; cf. vol. v. pp. 100, 107), besides his memorandum on the Langue des Elamites.
> It has been studied by Fr. Delitzsch, Die Sprache der Kossxer, pp. 51-54, who insists on the influence which daily intercourse with the Chaldaeans had on it after the conquest; Hale'vy {Revue Critique, 1884, vol. i. pp. 482-484), in most of the names of the gods given as Cosssean, sees merely the names of Chaldsean divinities slightly disguised in the writing.
^ The existence of Kashshu is proved by the name of Kashshuuadinakhe (Fr. Delitzsch, Die Sprache der Kossxer, pp. 29, 51) : Ashshur also bore a name identical with that of his worshijrpers.

him,^ and the divinities next in order were, as in the cities of the Euphrates,
the Moon, the Sun (Sakh or Shuriash), the air or the tempest (Ubriash), and
Khudkha.^ Then followed the stellar deities or secondary incarnations of the
sun, —Mirizir, who represented both Istar and Beltis; "^ and Khala, answering
to Gula.^ The Chaldaean Ninip corresponded both toGidar and Maruttash, Bel
to Kharbe and Turgu, Merodach to Shipak, Nergal to Shugab.® The Cossaean
kings, already enriched by the spoils of their neighbours, and supported by a
warlike youth, eager to enlist under their banner at the first call,*’ must have
been often tempted to quit their barren domains and to swoop down on the rich
country which lay at their feet. We are ignorant of the course of events which,
towards the close of the XVIII“* century B.c., led to their gaining possession
of it. The Cossaean king who seized on Babylon v'as named Gandish, and the few
inscriptions we possess of his reign are cut with a clumsiness that betrays the
barbarism of the conqueror. They cover the pivot stones on which Sargon of
Agade or one of the Bursins had hung the doors of the temple of Nippur, but
which Gandish dedicated afresh in order to win for himself, in the eyes of
posterity, the credit of the work of these sovereigns.'^ Bel found favour in the
‘ She is mentioned in a rescript of Nebuchadrezzar I., at the head of the gods of Namar, that is to say, the Cossaean deities, as “ the lady of the shining mountains, the inliabitaut of tlie summits, the frequenter of peaks ” (Rawlisson, Can. Ins. W. As., vol. v. pi. 57, col. ii. 11. 46, 47 ; cf. Pe:ser, Inschrijten Nebulcadnezar's I., in Schrader, KeilinscJiriflliche Bibliothels, vol. iii. pt. 1, pp. 170, 171). She is called Shimalia in Rawlinson, Can. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. pi. 59, 1. 23, where Delitzsch lias restored her name, which was slightly mutilated (Die Sprache der Kossoeer, p. 28, note 1) ; one of her statues was taken by Samsiramman III., King of Assyria, in one of that sovereign’s campaigns against Chaldsea (Reiser-Winckler, Die sogenannte synclironistiche GescliicMe, in Schrader, Keilinscliriftliche Bibliothelc, vol. i. pp. 202, 203, col. iv. 1. 8). “ All these identifications are furnished by the glossary of Delitzsch (Die Sprache der Eossxer, p. 25). Ubriash, under the form of Buriash, is met with in a largo number of proper names, Burnaburiash, Shagashaltiburiash, Ulamburiash, Kadashmanburiash, where the Assyrian scribe translates it Bel-matdfi, lord of the world ; Buriash is, therefore, an epithet of the god who was called Ramnian in Chaldma (Id., ibid., pp. 22, 23, 27). The name of the moon-god is mutilated, and only the initial syllable Shi . . . remains, followed by an indistinct sign : it has not yet been restored. Hale'vy (Notes Assyriologiques, § 24.

Les Coss^ens et leur Langue, 'm the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. iv. p. 210) considers Khala, or Khali, as a harsh form of Gula (cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 665) : if this is the case, the Cossasans must have borrowed the uame, and perhaps the goddess herself, from their Chaldaean neighbours. ‘ Fr.

eyes of the Cossseans who saw in Iiim Kharbe or Turgii, the recognised patron
of their royal family : for this reason Gandish and his successors regarded Bel
with peculiar devotion. These kings did all they could for the decoration and
endowment of the ancient temple of Ekur, which had been somewhat neglected
by the sovereigns of purely Babylonian extraction, and this devotion to one
of the most venerated Chaldaean sanctuaries contributed largely towards
their winning the hearts of the conquered people.^
The Cossfean rule over the countries of the Euphrates was doubtless
similar in its beginnings to that which the Hyksos exercised at first over the
nomes of Egypt. The Cossaean kings did not merely bring with them an
army to protect their persons, or to occupy a small number of important posts
they were followed by the whole nation, who spread themselves over the entire
country.^ The bulk of the invaders instinctively betook themselves to districts
where, if they could not resume the kind of life to which they were accustomed
in their own land, they could at least give full rein to their love of a free and
wild existence. As there were no mountains in the country, they turned to the
marshes, and, like the Hyksos in Egypt, made themselves at home about the
mouths of the rivers, on the half-submerged low lands, and on the sandy islets
of the lagoons which formed an undefined borderland between the alluvial
region and the Persian Gulf. The covert afforded by the thickets furnished
scope for the chase which these hunters had been accustomed to pursue in the
depths of their native forests, while fishing, on the other hand, supplied them
with an additional element of food. When their depredations drew down upon
them reprisals from their neighbours, the mounds occupied by their fortresses,
and surrounded by muddy swamps, offered them almost as secure retreats as
their former strongholds on the lofty sides of the Zagros. They made
alliances with the native Arammans — with those Kashdi, properly called Chal
dmans, whose name w'e have imposed upon all the nations who, from a very
early date, bore rule on the banks of the Lower Euphrates. Here tliey formed
themselves into a State —Karduniash —whose princes at times rebelled against
all external authority, and at other times acknowledged the sovereignty of the

OCCUPATION OF CHALDEA BY THE COSS^ANS. 117
Babylonian monarchs.^ The people of Sumir and Akkad, already a composite
of many different races, absorbed thus another foreign element, which, while
modifying its homogeneity, did not destroy its natural character. Those
Cossaean tribes who had not quitted their own country retained their original
barbarism, but the hope of plunder constantly drew them from their haunts,
and they attacked and devastated the cities of the plain unhindered by the
thought that they were now inhabited by their fellow-countrymen. The raid once
over, many of them did not return home, but took service under some distant
foreign ruler—the Syrian princes attracting many, who subsequently became the
backbone of their armies,^ while others remained at Babylon and enrolled them
selves in the body-guard of the kings. To the last they were an undisciplined
militia, dangerous, and difficult to please : one day they would hail their chiefs
with acclamations, to kill them the next in one of those sudden outbreaks
in which they were accustomed to make and unmake their kings.^ The first
* The state of Karduniash, whose name appears for the first time on the monuments of the Cossajan period, has been localised in a somewhat vague manner, in the south of Babylonia, in the country of the Kashdi, by Pognon (HInscription de Bavian, pp. 122-125), and afterwards formally identified with the Countries of the Sea, and with the principality which was called Bit-Yakin in tlie Assyrian period, by Tiele (Bab.-Asstjrische Gescliichte, pp. 78-80), whose opinion Winckler first rejected (Sumer und Ahltad, in the Mitteilungen des Ahadernisch-Orientalischen Vereins zu Berlin, vol. i. pp. 13, Id), but afterwards accepted (Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 86). In the Tel-el-Amarna tablets the name is already applied to the entire country occupied by the Cosssean kings or their descendants, that is to say, to the whole of Babylonia. Sargon II. at that time distinguishes between an Upper and a Lower Karduniash, Karduniash elish u shaplish (Great Inscription of Khorsahad, 1. 21) ; and in consequence the earliest Assyriologists considered it as an Assyrian designation of Babylon, or of the district surrounding it (Fe. Lenokmant, Les Premieres Civ., vol. ii. p. 250, n. 2; Etudes Accad., vol. i. pt. 3, pp. 68, 69), an opinion which was opposed by Delitzsch, as he believed it to be an indigenous term which at first indicated the district round Babylon, and afterwards the whole of Babylonia ( Wo lag das Paradies ? pp. 133-136 ; cf. Delitzsch-Muedtek, Gesch. Bahyl. und Assyr., 2nd edit., p. 89 ; Hommel, Gesch. Bahyl. und Assyr., pp. 433, 434). From one frequent spelling of the name, the meaning appears to have been Fortress of Buniash (Fe. Lenoemant, Les Premieres Civ., vol. ii. p. 250, note 2, where Duniash is considered to be a hero, not a god) ; to this Delitzsch preferred the translation Garden of
Buniash, from an erroneous different reading—Ganduniash (TFo lag das Paradies^ pp. 135, 136): Duniash, at first derived from a Chaldman god Bun, whose name may exist in Bunghi (ibid., p. 136), is a Cosssean name, which the Assyrians translated, as they did Buriash, Belmatdti, lord of the country. Winckler rejects the ancient etymology (Untersuchungen zur Altoriental. Gesch., pp. 135, 136), and proposes to divide the word as Kardu-niash, and to see in it a Cosssean translation of the expression mdt-lcaldi, country of the Chaldseans ; Hommel on his side, as well as Delitzsch, had thought of seeking in the Chaldseans proper Kaldi for Kashdi, or Kash-da, “ domain of the Cossseaus ’’—the descendants of the Cossseans of Karduniash, at least as far as race is concerned (Hommel, Gescliichte Bab. und Ass., p. 426, note 1 ; Fe. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies ? p. 129 ; and Bie Sprache der
Kossaser, p. 61). In the cuneiform texts the name is written Kara—D. P. Duuiyas, “ the Wall of the god Duniyas ” (cf. the Median Wall or Wall of Semiramis which defended Babylonia on the north). ^ Hale'vy has at least proved that the Khabiri mentioned in the Tel el-Amarna tablets were Cossaeans (Note sur quelques Noms propres Assyro-Palestiniens, in the Journal Asiatique, 1891, vol. xvii. pp. 547, 548, and Becherches Bibl., pp. 720, 724; cf. Soheil, Notes d’ Epigraphie, in the Bee. de Travaux, vol. xvi. p. 32, and Hilpeecht, Assyriaca, vol. i. p. 33, note 1), contrary to the opinion of Sayce, who makes them tribes grouped round Hebron (Bahyl. Tablets from Tel el-Amarna, in the Proceedings, 1887-88, vol. X. p. 496 ; The Higher Criticism, etc., p. 175, and Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 116149), which W. Max Muller seems to accept (Asien und Europa, p. 396) ; Winckler (Gesch. Israels, vol. i. pp. 16-21), returning to an old opinion, believes them to have been Hebrews. ^ This is the opinion of Hommel (Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 434), supported by the testimony of the Synchronous Hist. in this latter document the Cossaeans are found revolting against King Kadashmankharbe, and replacing him on the throne by a certain Nazibugash, who was of obscure origin (i., 11. 8-12 ; cf. WiNCKLEB, Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 115, 116).



1L8 SYlilA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST.
invaders were not long in acquiring, by means of daily intercourse with the old
inhabitants, the new civilization: sooner or later they became blended with
the natives, losing all their own peculiarities, with the exception of their
outlandish names,^ a few heroic legends,^ and the worship of two or three gods

Shumalia, Shugab, and Shukamuna.^ As in the case of the Hyksos in Africa,
the barbarian conquerors thus became merged in the more civilized people which
they had subdued. This work of assimilation seems at first to have occupied
the whole attention of both races, for the immediate successors of Gandish
were unable to retain under their rule all the provinces of which the empire
was formerly composed. They continued to possess the territory situated on
the middle course of the Euphrates as far as the mouth of the Balikh, but
they lost the region extending to the east of the Khabur, at the foot of the
Masios, and in the upper basin of the Tigris : the vicegerents of Assur also
withdrew from them, and, declaring that they owed no obedience excepting
to the god of their city, assumed the royal dignity. The first four of these
kings whose names have come down to us, Sulili, Belkapkapu, Adasi, and
Belbaui,^ appear to have been but indifferent rulers, but they knew how
to hold their own against the attacks of their neighbours,® and when, after a
century of weakness and inactivity, Babylon reasserted herself, and endeavoured
to recover her lost territory, they had so completely established their in
dependence that every attack on it was unsuccessful. The Cosstean king at
that time— an active and enterprising prince, whose name was held in honour
' Tide has called attention (Bahjhnisch-Assijrische Geschichte, p. G3) to the fact that a considerable nmuber of these names are constructed with Cossaean words after the Babylonian manner ; cf. Delitzscu, Die Sjjraclie der E.ossxer, p. 5i ; Howmel, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, p. 434, note 1. ^ Fr. Delitzsch ( TFo lag das I’aradies ? pp. 53-55, 124, 128, and Die Spruche der Kossxer, p. 61) and Schrader {Die Keilinschri/ten und das Alte Test, 2ud ed., pp. 87-89) compare their name with that of Knsh, who appears in the Bible as the father of Nimrod {Gen. x. 8-12) ; Hommel {Gesch. Bah. und Assyr., jrp. 276-278) and Sayce {Higher Criticism and the Monuments, pp. 122, 123, 148-151, and Patriarchal Palestine, p. 269) (hink that the history of Nimrod is a reminiscence of the Cossaeanrule. Jensen is alone in his attempt {Gischgimasch-Gilgamisch, ein Eossiier, in Zeits.f. Assyr., vol. vi. pp. 340-342) to attribute to the Cossroaus the first idea of the epic of Gilgames (cf. Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 574-591). ^ What the goddess Shhmalia became has been shown above, p. 115, note l,of the present volume. The god Shukamnua, or Shuqamuna, is mentioned in the text published by Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. TF. As., vol. iv. pi. 59, col. 2, 1. 23, side by side with Shimalia. * These four names do not so much represent four consecutive reigns as two separate traditions which were current respecting the beginnings of Assyrian royalty. The most ancient of them gives the chief place to two personages named Belkapkapu and Sulili; this tradition has been transmitted to ns by Rammannirari III., because it connected the origin of his race with these kings (RawlinsoNj Cun. Ins. IF. As., vol. i. pi. 35, No. 3, 11. 23-27; cf. Abel, Inschriften Rammdn-nirdri’s, in Scheadei:, Keilinschriftliche Bihliothel:, v(d. i. pp. 188-191). The second tradition placed a certain Belbani, the son of Adasi, in the room of Belkapkapu and Sulili : Esarhaddou made use of it in order to ascribe to his own family an antiquity at least equal to that of the family to which Rammannirari III. belonged (G. Smith, Assyrian History, in the Zeitschrift fur Aigyjdische Sprache, 1869, pp. 93, 94). Each king appropriated from the ancient popular traditions those names which seemed to him best calculated to enhance the prestige of his dynast}’, but w’e cannot tell how far the personages selected enjoyed an authentic historical existence : it is best to admit them at least provisionally into the royal series, without trusting too much to what is related of them. ^ IIOM.MEL, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 425, 426 ; Delitzscu-Muedtee, Geschichte Bahy loniens und Assyriens, pp. 17, 18, 88, 89 ; Wincklee, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 162-154.

up to the days of the Ninevite supremacy— was Agumkakrime, the son of
Tassigurumashd This “ brilliant scion of Shukamuna ” entitled himself lord
of the Kashshu and of Akkad, of Babylon the widespread, of Padan, of Alman,
and of the swarthy Guti.^ Ashnunak had been devastated ; he repeopled it,
and the four “ houses of the world ” rendered him obedience ; on the other hand,
Elam revolted from its allegiance, Assur resisted him, and if he still exercised
some semblance of authority over Northern Syria, it was owing to a traditioual
respect which the towns of that country voluntarily rendered to him, but which
did not involve either subjection or control. The people of Khani still retained
possession of the statues of Merodach and of his consort Zarpanit, which
had been stolen, we know not how, some time previously from Chaldsea.®
Agumkakrime recovered them and replaced them in their proper temple. This
was an important event, and earned him the good will of the priests. The king
reorganised public worship ; he caused new fittings for the temples to be made
to take the place of those which had disappeared, and the inscription which
records this work enumerates with satisfaction the large quantities of crystal,
jasper, and lapis-lazuli which he lavished on the sanctuary, the utensils of
silver and gold which he dedicated, together with the “ seas ” of wrought bronze
decorated with monsters and religious emblems.'* This restoration of the statues,

Delitzsch, Assijrisehe Miscellen, in the Berichte of the Saxony Academy of Seieuce, 1893, ii. pp. 184-186, and Knudtzon, Assyrische Gehete an den Sonnengott, vol. i. p. 60). The inscription of Agumkakrime, containing a genealogy of this prince which goes back as far as the fifth generation, has led to the restoration of the earlier part of the list as follows ; Gandish, Gaddash, Gande . 1714-1707 b.c.

This restoration is accepted by Tiele (Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, p. 104) and by Hommel (Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 420, 421); Winckler has not yet endorsed it (Untersiichungen zur Altorientalischen Geschichte, pp. 30, 31, and Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 79, 80). * Inscription of Agumhahrime, 11. 3, 4, 31-39 ; cf. Jensen, Inschrift Agumhahrimi’s, d.i. Agiim’s des Jiingeren, in Schrader, Keilinsehriftliehe Bibliothek, vol. iii. pt. 1, pp. 134-137. The translation blach-headed, i.e. dark-haired and complexioned, Guti, is uncertain; Jensen (1. L, p. 137) interprets the epithet nishi sahlati to mean “ the Guti, stupid (foolish ? culpable ?) people.” The Guti held both banks of the lower Zab, in the mountains on the east of Assyria. Delitzsch has placed Padan and Alman in the mountains to the east of the Diyaleh (TFo lag das Parodies? p. 205); Jensen places them in the chain of theKhamrin (Inschrift Agumlcahrimi’s, p. 137, note), and Winckler compares Alman or Halman with the Holw8,n of the present day (Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 81, 82). ’ The Khani have been placed by Delitzsch (Wo lag das Parodies? pp. 102, 104, 105, 270, 271, and Die Sprache der Kossxer, p. 60) in the neighbourhood of Mount Khana, mentioned in the accounts of the Assyrian campaigns, that is to say, in the Amanos, between the Euphrates and the bay of Alexandretta : he is inclined to regard the name as a form of that of the Khati, but on this point Tiele disagrees with him (Babylonisch-Assyrische Geschichte, p. 130, note 1), and is followed by Hommel (Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 418, note 1), by Jensen (Inschrift Agumkakrimi’s, in the Keilinsehriftliehe Bibliothek, vol. iii.pt. 1, p. 135, note), and by Hale'vy (Delta; Inscriptions hdtdennes de Zindjirli, in the Revue Semitique, vol. i. p. 328). Winckler places the Khani in Western Media (Gesch. Bab. und Assyr., p. 83) owing to an observation made by G. Smith (Assyrian Discoveries, p. 228).
* We do not possess the original of the inscription which tells us of these facts, but merely an early copy (G. Smith, Account of Recent Excavations and Discoveries made on the Site of Nineveh, in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. iii. pp. 452, 453).



120 SYRIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST.
so flattering to the national pride and piety, \A'ould have been exacted and insisted
upon by a Khammurabi at the point of the sword, but Agumkakrimc doubtless
felt that he was not strong enough to run the risk of war ; he therefore sent
an embassy to the Khani, and such was the prestige which the name of Baby
lon still possessed, from the deserts of the Caspian to the shores of the
Mediterranean, that he was able to obtain a concession from that people
which he would probably have been powerless to extort by force of arms.^
The Egyptians had, therefore, no need to anticipate Chaldsean interference
when, forsaking their ancient traditions, they penetrated for the first time into
the heart of Syria. Not only was Babylon no longer supreme there, but the
coalition of those cities on which she had depended for help in subduing the
West was partially dissolved, and the foreign princes who had succeeded to
her patrimony were so far conscious of their weakness, that they voluntarily
kept aloof from the countries in which, previous to their advent, Babylon
had held undivided sway. The Egyptian conquest of Syria had already begun
in the days of Agumkakrimc, and it is possible that dread of the Pharaoh was
one of the chief causes which influenced the Cossteans to return a favourable
answer to the Khani.^ Thutmosis I., on entering Syria, encountered there
fore only the native levies, and it must be admitted that, in spite of their
renowned courage, they were not likely to prove formidable adversaries in
Egyptian estimation. Not one of the local Syrian dynasties was sufficiently
powerful to collect all the forces of the country around its chief, so as to
oppose a compact body of troops to the attack of the African armies. The
whole country consisted of a collection of petty states, a complex group of
peoples and territories which even the Egyptians themselves never completely
succeeded in disentangling. They classed the inhabitants, however, under three
or four very comprehensive names—Kharu, Zahi,^ Lotanu, and Kefatiti— all of
which frequently recur in the inscriptions, but without having always that
exactness of meaning we look for in geographical terms. As was often the
case in similar circumstances, these names were used at first to denote the
districts close to the Egyptian frontier with which the inhabitants of the Delta
had constant intercourse. The Kefatiti seem to have been at the outset the
people of the sea-coast, more especially of the region occupied later by the
Phoenicians, but all the tribes with whom the Phoenicians came in contact on
’ strictly speaking, one might suppose that a war took place (Tiele, Bahylonisch-Assyrisahe Geschichte, p. 130) ; but most Assyriologists declare unhesitatingly that there was merely an embassy and a diplomatic negotiation (Hommel, Geschichte Bahjloniens und Assijriens, pp. 82-84). 2 This is Hommtd’s explanation {ibid., pp. 424, 425), which I admit, but only indirectly, the Khani being, as I believe, situated near Media. ^ W. Max Muller {Asien und Europa, pp. 17G-183), after E. de Eouge {Notice de quelques fragments de V Inscription de Karnak, p. 24), gives the name of Zaha or Zahi to the whole of Phoenicia, and, by a misapplication, to Coele-Syria ; for the original meaning of the name and for the probable history of the subsequent changes which it underwent, cf. Maspeeo, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d'llistoire, § x., in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. pp. 140-142.

the Asiatic and European border were before long included under the same
named Zahi originally comprised that portion of the desert and of the mari
time plain on the north-east of Egypt which was coasted by the fleets, or traversed
by the armies of Egypt, as they passed to and fro between Syria and the banks
of the Nile. This region had been ravaged by Ahmosis during his raid upon
Sharuhana,the year after the fall of Avaris.^ To the south-east of Zahi lay Kharu
it included the greater part of Mount Seir, whose wadys, thinly dotted over with
oases, were inhabited by tribes of more or less stationary habits. The approaches
to it were protected by a few towns, or rather fortified villages, built in the neigh
bourhood of springs, and surrounded by cultivated fields and poverty-stricken
gardens ; but the bulk of the people lived in tents or in caves on the mountain
sides. The Egyptians constantly confounded those Khauri, whom the Hebrews
in after-times found scattered among the children of Edom, with the other tribes
of Bedouin marauders, and designated them vaguely as Shausu.^ Lotanh lay
beyond, to the north of Kharu and to the north-east of Zahi, among the hills
which separate the “Shephelah” from the Jordan.^ As it was more remote
from the isthmus, and formed the Egyptian horizon in that direction, all the
new countries with which the Egyptians became acquainted beyond its
northern limits were by degrees included under the one name of Lotanu, and
this term was extended to comprise successively the entire valley of the Jordan,
then that of the Orontes, and finally even that of the Euphrates. Lotanu
* The Kefatih, -whose name -was first read Kefa, and later Kefto, were originally identified with the inhabitants of Cyprus or Crete (Beugsch, G. Ins., vol. ii. pp. 87, 88 ; cf. Pietschmann, Geschichte der Phonizier, pp. 255-257, and Steindoeff, ASgypten imd die Mylienisclie Cultur, in the Jahrhuch des K. Arch. Instituts, 1892, vol. vii. p. 15, who hesitates whether to place them in Cyprus or Northern Syria), and subsequently with those of Cilicia (W. Max Mullee, Asien und Europa, pp. 337-353),
although the decree of Canopus locates them in Phoenicia (Z. 9 M^r. — 1. 17 gr.). Cf. Maspeeo, Notes sur quelques points de Graminaire et d’Histoire, § x., in the Becueil, vol. xvii. p. 138, et seq. “ Cf. what is said above with regard to this campaign on p. 88 of the present volume. “ Kharh has been identified with the whole of Syria by Birch (^Observations on the Statistical Tablet of Karnalc, pp. 49, 50), by Brugsch (Geographische Insohriften, vol. i. pp. 59, 60), and by Chabas (Voyage d'un Egyptien, pp. 97, 112-115); W. Max Muller restricts the name to the land of Canaan (Asien und Europa, pp. 148-156). The identification of the name with that of the Hoiim or Horites of the Bible (Gen. xiv. 6, xxxvi. 20-30 ; Rent. ii. 12, 22) has been proposed by Haigh (Xaru, Beten and Shasu, in the Zeitschrift, 1875, pp. 29-31) and by L. Stern (Die XXII Manethonische Dynastie, in the Zeitschrift, 1883, p. 26, note 1), acknowledged to be possible by Ed. Mejei (Geschichte lEgyptens, p. 217, note 3), but opposed by W. Max Muller (Asien und Europa, pp. 155, 156) ; cf. Maspeeo, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d’Histoire, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. pp. 140-142. * The name of Lotanh or Eotanh has been assigned by Brugsch (Geographische Inschriften, vol. ii. pp. 31, 599) to the Assyrians, but subsequently, by connecting it, more ingeniously than plausibly, with the Assyrian iltdnu, he extended it to all the peoples of the north (Die altdgyptische Volkerlafel, in the Abhandlungen of the International Congress at Berlin, African section, pp. 27-29) : we now
know that in the texts it denotes the whole of Syria, and, more generally, all the peoples dwelling in the basins of the Orontes and the Euphrates (W. Max Mullee, Asien und Europa nach altdgyptischen DenJcmdlern, p. 143, et seq.). The attempt to connect the name Eotanu or Lotanu with that of the Edomite tribe of Lotan (Gen. xxxvi. 20, 22) was first made by E. de Saulcy (Lettres a M. Chabas sur quelques points de la Geographic antique de la Syrie selon la Science Egyptienne, in the Melanges d' Archeologie Egyptienne et Assyrienne, vol. i. pp. 98-100) ; it was afterwards taken up by Haigh (Xaru, Beten and Shasu, in the Zeitschrift, 1875, p. 30) and adopted by Eenan (Hist, du Peuple d’Israel, vol. i.pp. 12,115; cf. p. 66, note 7, of the present volume).

became thenceforth a vague and fluctuating term, which the Egyptians applied
indiscriminately to widely differing Asiatic nations, and to which they added
another indefinite epithet when they desired to use it in a more limited
sense : that part of Syria nearest to Egypt being in this case qualified as
Upper Lotanu, while the towns and kingdoms further north were described
as being in Lower Lotanu. In the same way the terms Zahi and Kharu were
extended to cover other and more northerly regions. Zahi was applied to the
coast as far as the mouth of the Nahr el-Kebir and to the country of the
Lebanon which lay between the Mediterranean and the middle course of
the Orontes. Kharu ran parallel to Zahi, but comprised the mountain district,
and came to include most of the countries which were at first ranged under
Upper Lotanu ; it was never applied to the region beyond the neighbourhood
of Mount Tabor, nor to the trans-Jordauic provinces. The three names in
their wider sense preserved the same relation to each other as before,
Zahi lying to the west and north-west of Kharu, and Lower Lotanu to the
north of Kbaru and north-east of Zahi, but the extension of meaning did not
abolish the old conception of their position, and hence arose confusion in the
minds of those who employed them ; the scribes, for instance, who registered
in some far-off Theban temple the victories of the Pharaoh would sometimes
write Zahi where they should have inscribed Kharu, and it is a difficult matter
for us always to detect their mistakes. It would be unjust to blame them
too severely for their inaccuracies, for what means had they of determining
the relative positions of that confusing collection of states with which the
Egyptians came in contact as soon as they had set foot on Syrian soil ?
A choice of several routes into Asia, possessing unequal advantages, was
open to the traveller, but the most direct of them passed through the town
of Zalud The old entrenchments running from the Bed Sea to the marshes
of the Pelusiac branch^ still protected the isthmus, and beyond these, forming
an additional defence, was a canal on the banks of which a fortress was con
structed. This was occupied by the troops who guarded the frontier, and no
traveller was allowed to pass without having declared his name and rank, signified
the business which took him into Syria or Egypt, and shown the letters with
which he was entrusted.^ It was from Zalu that the Pharaohs set out with

their troops, when summoned to Kharu by a hostile confederacy ;
^ it was to
ZaKi they returned triumphant after the campaign, and there, at the gates of
the town, they were welcomed by the
magnates of the kingdom.^ The road
ran for some distance over a region
which was covered by the inundation
of the Nile during six months of
the year; it then turned eastward,
and for some distance skirted the
sea-shore, passing between the Medi
terranean and the swamp which
writers of the Greek period called
the Lake of Sirbonis.^ This stage
of the journey was beset with diffi
culties, for the Sirbonian Lake did
not always present the same aspect,
and its margins were constantly shift
ing. When the canals which con
nected it with the open sea happened
to become obstructed, the sheet of
water s ubsided from evaporation , leav
ing in many places merely an expanse
of shifting mud, often concealed
under the sand which the wind brought
up from the desert. Travellers ran
imminent risk of sinking in this quagmire, and the Greek historians tell of
large armies being almost entirely swallowed up in it. About halfway along
the length of the lake rose the solitary hill of Mount Casios; beyond this the
sea-coast widened till it became a vast slightly undulating plain, covered with

scanty herbage, and dotted over witli wells containing an abundant supply of
water, which, however, was brackish and disagreeable to drinkd Beyond these
lay a grove of palms, a brick prison, and a cluster of miserable houses, bounded
by a broad wady, usually dry. The bed of the torrent often served as the boundary
between Africa and Asia, and the town was for many years merely a convict
prison, where ordinary criminals, condemned to mutilation and exile, were con
fined ; indeed, the Greeks assure us that it owed its name of Rhinocolura to the
number of noseless convicts who were to be seen there.^ At this point the
coast turns in a north-easterly direction, and is flanked with high sand
hills, behind which the caravans pursue their way, obtaining merely occasional
glimpses of the sea. Here and there, under the shelter of a tower or a half
ruined fortress, the traveller would have found wells of indifferent water, till on
reaching the confines of Syria he arrived at the fortified village of Raphia,
standing like a sentinel to guard the approach to Egypt.^ Beyond Raphia
vegetation becomes more abundant, groups of sycomores and mimosas and
clusters of date-palms appear on the horizon, villages surrounded with fields
and orchards are seen on all sides, while the bed of a river, blocked with
gravel and fallen rocks, winds its way between the last fringes of the desert
and the fruitful Shephelah ; ^ on the further bank of the river lay the suburbs
of Gaza, and, but a few hundred yards beyond, Gaza itself came into view among
the trees standing on its wall-crowned hill.® The Egyptians, on their march from
the Nile valley, were wont to stop at this spot to recover from their fatigues ; it

Griffith, The Antiquities of Tell elYahudiyeh, pp. 70-74, and Maspeho, Dawn of Civilization, p. 169). Brugsch believed he could identify its site witli that of the Syrian town Ilurniklieri, which he erroneously reads Harinkola (Geschichte Aiqyptens, p. 369); tlie ancient form of the name is unknown, the Greek form varies between Rhinocorflra (Stephen of Btsiantifm, s. v. 1. Josephus, Antiquities of the Jews, XIII. xv. 4, and XIV. xiv. 2) and Rhinocolura. The history of the mutilated convicts is to be found in Diodorus Siculus, I. lx., as well as in Strabo, XVI. ii., § 31, p. 759 ; it rests on a historical fact. Under the
XV 1IP'‘ dynasty Zalu was used as a place of confinement for dishonest officials (Bouriant, A Thebes, in the liecucil de Travaux, vol. vi. p. 43, 11. 17, 22). For this purpose it was probably replaced by Rhinocolura, wlien the Egyptian frontier was removed from the neighbourhood of Selle to that of El-Arish. ^ For all this part of the road, cf. Guerin, La Jud^e, vol. ii. pp. 233-237. Raphia, whose name is preserved in that of the well Bir-Rafah, is mentioned once during the XIX'*' dynasty under the name of Rapihui (Anastaei Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xxvii. 11. 7, 8; cf. Chabas, Voyage d’un JEgyptien,pp. 291293) ; it is also found under that of Rapikhi in the Assyrian inscriptions of the time of Sargon II., King of Assyria (Oppekt-Menant, La Grande Inscription du Palais de Khorsahad, 1. 25, p. 74. ’ The term Shephelah signifies the plain (cf. p. 13 of the present volume) ; it is applied by the Biblical writers to the plain bordering the coast, from the heights of Gaza to those of Joppa, which were inhabited at a later period by the Philistines (Josh. xi. 16; Jer. xxxii. 44 and xxxiii. 13). ® Gverin, La J^id^e, vol. ii. pp. 223-283, describes at length the road from Gaza to Raphia. The only town of importance between them in the Greek period was Icuysos (Herodotus, III. v. and V. liii.), the ruins of which arc to be found near Khan Yunes, but the Egyptian name for this locality is unknown : Aunaugasa, the name of which Brugsch thought he could identify with it (Geschichte AigypUns, p. 269), should be placed much further away, in Northern or in Coele-Syria.

was their first halting-place beyond the frontier, and the news which would
reach them here prepared them in some measure for what awaited them
further on. The army itself, the “ trcop of Ra,” was drawn from four great
races, the most distinguished of which came, of course, from the banks of the
Nile : the Amu, born of Sokhifc, the lioness-headed goddess, were classed in the
second rank ; the Nahsi, or negroes of Ethiopia, were placed in the third
while the Timihu, or Libyans, with the white tribes of the north, brought up
the rear.^ The Syrians belonged to the second of these families, that next in
order to the Egyptians, and the name of Amu, which for centuries had been
given them, met so satisfactorily all political, literary, or commercial require
ments, that the administrators of the Pharaohs never troubled themselves
to discover the various elements concealed beneath the term.^ We are, how
ever, able at the present time to distinguish among them several groups of
peoples and languages, all belonging to the same family, but possessing
distinctive characteristics. The kinsfolk of the Hebrews, the children of
Ishmael and Edom, the Moabites and Ammonites, who were all qualified as
Shaiisu, had spread over the region to the south and east of the Dead
Sea, partly in the desert, and partly on the confines of the cultivated land.^
The Canaanites were not only in possession of the coast from Gaza to a point
beyond the Nahr el-Ivebir, but they also occupied almost the whole valley of
the Jordan, besides that of the Litany, and perhaps that of the Upper Orontes.^
There were Aramaean settlements at Damascus, in the plains of the Lower
Orontes, and in Naharaim.® The country beyond the Aramaean territory,
including the slopes of the Amanos and the deep valleys of the Taurus, was
inhabited by peoples of various origin ; the most powerful of these, the Khati,
were at this time slowly forsaking the mountain region, and spreading by
degrees over the country between the Afiin and the Euphrates.®
‘ Tliis is the way they are frequently rcpresenteil in the tombs of the Theban kings of tlie XVIII"' and XX"' dynasties (Champollion, Monuments de VI’gijpte et de la Nuhie, pis. ccxxxviii.ccxli. ; ItosEi.LiNi, Monumenti Storiei, pis. clv.-elix. ; Lepsids, Denlcm., iii. 135, 13G).
For tlie compi’elieusivo use at this period of the name Amu, cf. AV. Max Muller, Asien und
Earopa, pp. 121-125.
^ See what is said of the Shausu on p. 5-1 of the present volume. AV. Max Muller (Asien und Enropa, pp. 131-11:2) appears to me to restrict too closely the area of country inhabited by the people to whom the Egyptians gave this name. ^ I use the term Canannite with the meaning most frequently attached to it, according to the Hebrew use (Gen. x. 15-19). For the presence of this word in the Egyptian texts, cf. tlie examples
collected by AV. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 205-208. It is found several times under the forms Kiuakhna, Kinakhkhi, and probably Kuuakhaiu, in the cuneiform texts of Tel el-Amarna (AVinckler, Verzeich. der aus dem Funde voji El-Amarna lierriihrenden Thontafel, in Zeitschrift, 1889, p. 45, n. 4). As far as I know, the term Ai-amxan is not to be found in any Egyptian text of the time of the Pharaohs; the only known example of it (Aiiastasi Papyrus III, pi. v., verso, 1. 5) is a writer’s error corrected by Chabas ( Recherclies pour Vllistoire de I’Egypte sous la X[X‘ dynastie, pp. 97, 107). AV. Max Miiller (Asien und Europa, p. 234) very justly observes that the mistake is itself a proof of the existence of the name and of the acquaintance of the Egyptians with it. “ Thutmosis III. shows that, at any rate, they were established in these regions about the XVI"‘ century b.c. The Egyptian pronunciation of their name is Eldti, with the feminine Khitait, Khitlt, as



THE GANAANITES. 127
The Canaanites were the most numerous of all these groups, and had they
been able to amalgamate under a single king, or even to organize a lasting
confederacy, it would have been impossible for the Egyptian armies to
have broken through the barrier thus raised between them and the rest of
Asia ; but, unfortunately, so far from showing the slightest tendency towards
unity or concentration, the Canaanites were
more hopelessly divided than any of the
surrounding nations. Their mountains con
tained nearly as many states as there were
valleys, while in the plains each town repre
sented a separate government, and was built
on a spot carefully selected for purposes of
defence. The land, indeed, was chequered
with these petty states, and so closely were
they crowded together, that a horseman,
travelling at leisure, could easily passthrough
two or three of them in a day’s journey.^ Not
only were the royal cities fenced with walls,
but many of the surrounding villages were
fortified, while the watch-towers, or migdols,^ built at the bends of the roads, at
the fords over the rivers, and at the openings of the ravines, all testified to
the insecurity of the times and the aptitude for self-defence shown by the in
habitants. The aspect of these migdols, or forts, must have appeared strange to
the first Egyptians who beheld them. These strongholds bore no resemblance
to the large square or oblong enclosures to which they were accustomed, and
which in their eyes represented the highest skill of the engineer.^ In Syria,
however, the positions suitable for the construction of fortresses hardly ever
lent themselves to a symmetrical plan. The usual sites were on the projecting
I have long ago pointed out (cf. W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 324, note 3) ; but the Tel elAmarna texts employ the vocalisation Khdti, Khdte, which must be more correct than that of the Egyptians. The form Kliili seems to me to be explicable by an error of popular etymology. Egyptian ethnical appellations in -iti formed their plural by -dtiu, -dteu, -dti,-dte, so that if Khdte, Khdti, were taken for a plural, it would naturally have suggested to the scribes the form Khiti for the singular. > Thutmosis III., speaking to his soldiers, tells them that all the chiefs in the country are shut up in Megiddo, so that “to take it is to take a thousand cities” (Maspero, It^cit de la campagne contre Mageddo, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. ii. p. 148) ; this is evidently a hyperbole in the mouth of the conqueror, but the exaggeration itself shows how numerous were the chiefs and consequently the small states in Central and Southern Syria.

Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte et de la Nuhie, vol. ii. p. 90 : Eosellini, Monumenti Storici, pi. xlix. 1 ; Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 126 h. “ This Canaanite word was borrowed by the Egyptians from the Syrians at the beginning of their Asiatic wars; they employed it in forming the names of the military posts which they established on the eastern frontier of the Delta : it appears for tlie first time among Syrian places in the list of cities conquered by Thutmosis III. (Mariette, Karndk, pi. 19, No. 71, and Texte, p. 34). ‘ Cf- what is said of Egyptian fortifications in Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 450-452.

spur of some mountain, or on a solitary and more or less irregularly shaped
eminence in the midst of a plain, and the means of defence had to be adapted
in each case to suit the particular configuration of the ground. It was usually
a mere wall of stone or dried brick, with towers at intervals ; the wall measuring
from nine to twelve feet thick at the base, and from thirty to thirty-six feet
high, thus rendering an
assault by means of port
able ladders nearly im
practicable.^ The gate
way had the appearance
of a fortress in itself.
It was composed of three
large blocks of masonry,
forming a re-entering face,
considerably higher than
the adjacent curtains, and
pierced near the top with
square openings furnished
with mantlets, so as to
give both a front and
flank view of the as
sailants. The wooden
doors in the receded face
were covered with metal
and raw hides, thus afford
ing a protection against axe or fire.^ The building was strong enough not
only to defy the bands of adventurers who roamed the country, but was able
to resist for an indefinite time the operations of a regular siege. Sometimes,
however, the inhabitants when constructing their defences did not confine
themselves to this rudimentary plan, but threw up earthworks round the
selected site. On the most exposed side they raised an advance wall, not

Another representation of the same town was found at Luxor, on one of the walls which have been excavated since 1884. ^ Most of the Canaanite towns taken by Ramses II. in tlie campaign of his VIII"' year were fortified in this manner (Champoleion, Monuments de I'Eqypte el de la Nubie, vol. i. pp. 880, 881 IjEPSUts, Penlim , iii. 15G). It must have been the usual method of fortification, as it seems to have served as a type for conventional representation, and was sometimes used to denote cities which had fortifications of another kind. For instance, Dapur-Tabor is represented in this way in the list referred to above, while a picture on another monument, which is reproduced in the illustration on this page, represents what scorns to have been the particular form of its encompassing walls (Caieliaud, Voijaqe ti M^rod’, vol. ii. pi. Ixxiii. 1 ; Cuampoeeion, Monuments de VEgypte et de la Nubie, pi. cccxxxi. Lepsius, Dcnlnn., iii. IGG).

exceeding twelve or fifteen feet in height, at the left extremity of which the
entrance was so placed that the assailants, in endeavouring to force their
way through, were obliged to expose an unprotected flank to the defenders.
By this arrangement it was necessary to break through two lines of
fortification before the place could be entered. Supposing the enemy to
have overcome these first obstacles, they would find themselves at their
next point of attack confronted with a citadel which contained, in addition
to the sanctuary of the principal god, the palace of the sovereign himself.
This also had a double enclosing wall and massively built gates, which could
be forced only at the expense of fresh losses, unless the cowardice or treason
of the garrison made the assault an easy one.^ Of these bulwarks of Canaanite
civilization, which had been thrown up by hundreds on the route of the invad
ing hosts, not a trace is to be seen to-day. They may have been razed to the
ground during one of those destructive revolutions to which the country was
often exposed, or their remains may lie hidden underneath the heaps of ruins
which thirty centuries of change have raised over them.^ The records of

130 ISYRIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST.
victories graven on the walls of the Theban temples furnish, it is true, a general
conception of their appearance, but the notions of them which we should obtain
from this source would be of a very confused character had not one of the last
of the conquering Pharaohs, Ramses III., taken it into his head to have one
built at Thebes itself, to contain within it, in addition to his funerary chapel,
accommodation for the attendants assigned to the conduct of his worship.^ In
the Greek and Roman period a portion of this fortress was demolished, but the
external wall of defence still exists on the eastern side, together with the
gate, which is commanded on the right by a projection of the enclosing-wall,
and flanked by two guard-houses, rectangular in shape, and having roofs which
jut out about a yard beyond the wall of support. Having passed through
these obstacles, we find ourselves face to face with a migdol of cut stone, nearly
square in form, with two projecting wings, the court between their loop-holed
walls being made to contract gradually from the point of approach by a series
of abutments. X careful examination of the place, indeed, reveals more than
one arrangement which the limited knowledge of the Egyptians would hardly
permit us to expect. We discover, for instance, that the main body of the
building is made to rest upon a sloping sub-structure which rises to a height
of some sixteen feet. This served two purposes : it increased, in the first place,
the strength of the defence against sapping ; and in the second, it caused the
weapons launched by the enemy to rebound with violence from its inclined
surface, thus serving to keep the assailants at a distance.^ The whole struc
ture has an imposing look, and it must be admitted that the royal architects
charged with carrying out their sovereign’s idea brought to their task an atten
tion to detail for which the people from whom the plan was borrowed had no
capacity, and at the same time preserved the arrangements of their model so
faithfully that we can readily realise what it must have been. Transport this
migdol of Ramses III. into Asia, plant it upon one of those hills which the
Canaanites were accustomed to select as a site for their fortifications, spread out
at its base some score of low and miserable hovels, and we have before us an
improvised pattern of a village which recalls in a striking manner Zerin or
Beilin, or any other small modern town which gathers the dwellings of its
fellahiu round some central stone building—whether it be a hostelry for be
nighted travellers, or an ancient castle of the Crusading age.
There were on the littoral, to the north of Gaza, two large walled towns,
Ascalon and Joppa, in whose roadsteads merchant vessels were accustomed to

also, and on the lower slopes of the mountains, a number of similar fortresses
and villages, such as lurza, Migdol, Lachish, Ajalon, Shocho, Adora, Aphukin,
Keilah, Gezer, and Ono ; and, in the neighbourhood of the roads which led to
the fords of the Jordan, Gibeah, Beth-Anoth, and finally Urusalim, our Jeru

Its port, “Maiumas Ascalonis,” was probably merely a narrow bay or creek, now, for a long period, filled up by the sand. Neither the site nor the remains of the port have been discovered (Guerin, Judge, voh ii. pp. 149-152). The name of the town is
always spelled in Egyptian with an “s”—Askaluna (E. de Eouge, Mgmoire sur VAlphabet Egyptien, p. 71), which gives us the pronunciation of the time.

maintained themselves upon the soil. The
plough which they employed was like that
used by the Egyptians and Babylonians,
being nothing but a large hoe to which a couple of oxen were harnessed.'^ The
scarcity of rain, except in certain seasons, and the tendency of the rivers to run
low, contributed to make the cultivators of the soil experts in irrigation and
agriculture. Almost the only remains of these people which have come
down to us consist of indestructible wells and cisterns, or wine and oil presses
hollowed out of the rock.^ Fields of wheat and barley extended along the flats
of the valleys, broken in upon here and there by orchards, in which the white
and pink almond, the apple, the fig, the pomegranate, and the olive flourished side
by side. If the slopes of the valley rose too precipitously for cultivation, stone

It resembles the ancient Egyptian plough illustrated in Dawn of Civilization, p. 67. ^ Monuments of this kind are encountered at every step in Judsea, but it is very difficult to date them. The aqueduct of Siloam, which goes back perhaps to tlie time of Hezekiah, and the canals which conducted water into Jerusalem, possibly in part to be attributed to the reign of Solomon, are the only instances to which anything like a certain date may be assigned. But these are long posterior to the XVIII"' dynasty. Good judges, however, attribute some of these monuments to a very distant period ; the masonry of the wells of Beersheba is very ancient (H. Palmer, The Desert of the Exodus, vol. ii. pp. 387-390), if not as it is at present, at least as it was when it was repaired in the time of the Cmsars (Guerin, Jud^e, vol. ii. pj). 283, 281); the olive and wiue presses hewn in the rock do not all date back to the Roman empire, but many belong to a still earlier period, and modern descriptions (cf. Guerin, Judge, vol. iii. pp. 261-273) correspond with what we know of such presses from the Bible (e.g. Micah vi. 15 ; Isa. v. 2, xvi. 10 ; Jer. xxv. 30, xlviii. 33). * Guerin, Description de la Palestine, Judge, vol. iii. pp. 260, 261, 288, etc.

nomenclature in the Egyptian geographical lists reflects as in a mirror the
agricultural pursuits of its ancient inhabitants : one village, for instance, is called
Aubila, “ the meadow ;
” while others bear such names as Ganutu, “ the gardens ;
”
Magraphut, “ the mounds;” and Karman, “ the vineyard.”'^ The further we
proceed towards the north, we find, with a diminishing aridity, the hillsides
covered with richer crops, and the valleys decked out with a more luxuriant and
warmly coloured vegetation. Shechem lies in an actual amphitheatre of verdure,
which is irrigated by countless unfailing streams ; rushing brooks babble on
every side, and tbe vapour given off by them morning and evening covers the
entire landscape with a luminous haze, where the outline of each object becomes
blurred, and quivers in a manner to which we are accustomed in our Western
lands.^ Towns grew and multiplied upon this rich and loamy soil, but as these
lay outside tbe usual track of the invading hosts—which preferred to follow the
more rugged but shorter route leading straight to Carmel across the plain

sandy clay took the place of the dark and compact loam : oaks began to appear,
sparsely at first, but afterwards forming vast forests, which the peasants of our
own days have thinned and reduced to a considerable extent. The stunted
trunks of these trees are knotted and twisted, and the tallest of them do not
exceed some thirty feet in height, while many of them may be regarded as
nothing more imposing than large bushes.’^ Muddy rivers, infested with croco
diles, flowed slowly through the shady woods, spreading out their waters
here and there in pestilential swamps. On reaching the seaboard, their exit
was impeded by the sands which they brought down with them, and the
banks which were thus formed caused the waters to accumulate in lagoons
extending behind the dunes. For miles the road led through thickets, inter
rupted here and there by marshy places and clumps of thorny shrubs. Bands
of Shausii were accustomed to make this route dangerous, and even the bravest
heroes shrank from venturing alone along this route.^ Towards Aluna the way
began to ascend lllount Carmel by a narrow and giddy track cut in the rocky
side of the precipice.® Beyond the Mount, it led by a rapid descent into a
plain covered with corn and verdure, and extending in a width of some thirty
miles, by a series of undulations, to the foot of Tabor, where it came to an end.
Two side ranges running almost parallel —little Herinon and Gilboa— dis
posed in a line from east to west, and united by an almost imperceptibly rising
ground, serve rather to connect the plain of Megiddo with the valley of the Jordan
than to separate them. A single river, the Kishon, cuts the route diagonally—or,
to speak more correctly, a single river-bed, which is almost waterless for nine
months of the year, and becomes swollen only during the winter rains with the
numerous torrents bursting from the hillsides. As the flood approaches the sea it
becomes of more manageable proportions, and finally distributes its waters among
the desolate lagoons formed behind the sand-banks of the open and wind-swept

Birkana apj^ears to be tlie modern Brukin (Maspero, Sur les Nnms G^ogra^hiques, etc., pp. 19, 20), and Dutina is certainly Dothain, now Tell-Dothan (Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d’Histoire, in the Zeitschrift, 1881, p. 122). * The forest was well known to the geographers of the Greco-Eoman period (Strabo, xvi. 2, § 28, p. 758), and was still in e.vistence at the time of the Crusades; cf. Conder, Medixval Topography of Palestine, in the Pal. Fjxpl. Fund, Quarterly Statements, 1875, pp. 91, 92. Its present condition is described by Guerin, Description de la Palestine, Samarie, vol. ii. p. 388. ^ For all this part of the route, which had been previously wrongly placed owing to the ignorance of the existence of a forest in tliis region, see Maspero, iJ/itre Joppd et Mageddo, in the Etudes Arche'ol. Linguist, et Historiques, d^di€es a M. le D’’ C. Leemans, pp. 3-6. This defile is described at length in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xxiii. 1. 1, et seq., and the terms used by the writer are in themselves sufficient evidence of the terror with which the place inspired the Egyptians. The annals of Tliutmosis III. are equally explicit as to the difficulties whicli an army had to encounter here (Maspero, Le Recit de la campagne contre Mageddo sous Thoutmos III., in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. ii. pp. 51-56, 140, 141). 1 have placed this defile near the point which is now called Umm-el-Fahm {Sur les Noms Gdographiques, etc., jip. 6, 7), and this site seems
to me to agree better with the account of the expedition of Thutmosis III. than that of Arraneh proposed by Conder {Palestine Fxpl. Fund, Quarterly Statements, 1880, p. 223).

has been the scene of more sanguinary engagements, or has witnessed century
after century so many armies crossing its borders and coming into conflict
with one another. Every military leader who, after leaving Africa, was
able to seize Gaza and Ascalon, became at once master of Southern Syria.
He might, it is true, experience some local resistance, and come into con
flict with bands or isolated outposts of the enemy, but as a rule he had no
need to anticipate a battle before he reached the banks of the Kishon. Here,
behind a screen of woods and mountain, the enemy would concentrate his forces
and prepare resolutely to meet the attack. If the invader succeeded in over
coming resistance at this point, the coirntry lay open to him as far as the
Orontes ; nay, often even to the Euphrates. The position was too important for
its defence to have been neglected. A range of forts, Ibleam, Taanach,^ and

southern face, and beyond these a series of strongholds and villages followed one

could find safe anchorage after leaving the mouths of the Nile, and whoever
was able to make himself master of it had in his hands the key of Syria, for
it stood in the same commanding position with regard to the coast as that

a safe harbourage from the attacks of pirates or the perils of bad vveatherd From
this point the hills come so near tlie shore that one is sometimes obliged to
wade along the beach to avoid a projecting spur, and sometimes to climb a zig
zag path in order to cross a headland. In more than one place the rock has
been hollowed into a series of rough steps,
giving it the appearance of a vast
ladder.^ Below this precipitous
path the waves dash with fury,
and when the wind sets towards
the land every thud causes
the rocky wall to trenable, and
detaches fragments from its
surface. The majority of the
towns, such as Aksapu (Ec
dippa), Maslial, Lubina, Ushu

the mountain ridges, out of the
reach of pirates; several, however,
were built on the shore, under the
shelter of some promontory, and the
inhabitants of these derived a miserable subsistence from fishing and the chase.^

throughout its entire length, from town to town, by the coast road, which

pasture-land, which attracted the Bedouin from every side, and scattered over
it were a number of walled towns, such as Hamath, Magato, Ashtaroth, and
Ono-Eephad Probably Damascus was already at this period the dominant
authority over the region watered by these two rivers, as well as over the villages
nestling in the gorges of Hermon,—Ahila, Helbon of the vineyards, and
Yabrud,—but it had not yet acquired its renown for riches and power. Pro
tected by the Anti-Lebanon range from its turbulent neighbours, it led a sort
of vegetative existence apart from invading hosts, forgotten and hushed to
sleep, as it were, in the shade of its gardens.
The third road from Megiddo took the shortest way possible. After crossing
the Kishon almost at right angles to its course, it ascended by a series of steep
inclines to arid plains, fringed or intersected by green and flourishing valleys,
which afforded sites for numerous towns, —Pahira, Merom near Lake Huleh,
Qart-Nizanu, Beerotu, and Lauisa, situated in the marshy district at the head
waters of the Jordan.^ From this point forward the land begins to fall, and taking
a hollow shape, is known as Coele-Syria, with its luxuriant vegetation spread
between the two ranges of the Lebanon. It was inhabited then, as at the time
of the Babylonian conquest, by the Amorites, who probably included Damascus
also in their domain.^ Their capital, the sacred Qodshu, was situated on the left
bank of the Orontes, about five miles from the lake which for a long time bore its
name, Bahrel-Kades.^ It crowned one of those barren oblong eminences which
' Proof that the Egyptians knew this route, followed even to this day in certain circumstances, is furnished by the lists of Thutmosis III., in which the principal stations which it comprises are enumerated among the towns given up after the victory of Megiddo (Nos. 13-17, 28-30). Dimasqu was identified with Damascus by E. de Eouge, Etude sur divers Monuments du regne de Thoutmh 111., p. 47, and Astarotu with Ashtarotli-Qarnaim (ibid., p. 49). Hamatu (No. 16) is probably Hamath of the Gadarenes; Magato (No. 30), the Maged of the Maccabees, is possibly the present Mukatta; and Ono-Eepha (No. 29), Eaphon, Eaphana, Arpha of Decapolis, is the modern Er-Eafeh (Maspero, Sur les Noms G^jgmphiques, etc., qu’on pent rapporter a la Galilde, pp. 4, 5). * Pahira is probably Safed ; Qart-Nizanu, the “flowery city,” the Kartha of Zabulon (Josh. xxi. 31); and Beerut, the Berotha of Josephus (Hist, of the Jews, v. 1. 18), near Merom (Maspero, Sur les Noms, etc., qu’on pent rapporter a la Galilee, pp. 3-5). Maroma and Lauisa, Laisa, have been identified with Merom and Laish by Brugsch (G. Ins., vol. ii. pp. 72, 74) and by E. de Eouge (Etude sur divers Mon. du regne de Thoutmes IIL, p. 50). “ The identification of the country of Amauru with that of the Amorites was admitted from the first by OsBUEN, Egypt, her Testimony to Truth, pp. 65, 66 ; Hincks, An Attempt to ascertain the Number, etc., of Hieroglyphic Alphabet, p. 45 ; Budgsch, Qeog. Ins., vol. ii. pp. 21, 48, 61, etc. The only doubt was as to the locality occupied by these Amorites : the mention of Qodshu on the Orontes, in the country of the Amurru, showed that Coele-Syria was the region in question. In the Telel-Amarna tablets the name Amurru is applied also to the country east of the Phoenician coast (Bezold- Bodge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the Brit. Mus., pi. xlvii., note 2), and we have seen that there is reason to believe that it was used by the Babylonians to denote all Syria (cf. p. 18, note 5, of this volume). If the name given Ijy the cuneiform inscriptions to Damascus and its neighbourhood, “ Gar-Imirishu,” “ Imirishu,” “Imirish,” really means “the Fortress of the Amorites” (Satce, in the Academy, 1881, p. 161; Hoiihel, Hie Semitischen Volker, p. 178 ; Fr. Lenormant, Les Origines de VHistoire, vol. ii. pp. 288, 338), we should have in this fact a proof that this people were in actual possession of the Damascene Syria. This must have been taken from tliem by the Hittites towards the XX*'' century before our era, according to Hommel ; about the end of tlie XVIfP'' dynasty, according to Lenormant. If, on the other hand, the Assyrians read the name “ Sha-imiri-shu,” with the signification, “ the town of its asses ” (Happt, Her Keilschriftliche Name des Reiches von Hamaslcus, in the Zeits. fiir Assyr., vol. ii. pp. 321, 322), it is simply a play upon words, and has no bearing upon the primitive meaning of the name. * The name Qodshu-Kadesh was for a long time read Uatesh, Badesh, Atesh, and, owing to a

are so frequently met with in Syria. A muddy stream, the Tannur, flowed, at
some distance away, around its base, and, emptying itself into the Orontes at a
point a little to the north, formed a natural defence for the town on the
Avest. Its encompassing Avails, slightly elliptic in form, Avere strengthened by
towers, and surrounded by two concentric ditches which kept the sapper at
a distance. A dyke running across the Orontes above the town caused the
waters to rise and to overflow in a northern direction, so as to form a shalloAV
lake, which acted as an additional protection from the enemy. Qodshu Avas
thus a kind of artificial island, connected with the surrounding country by two
confusion with Qodi, Ati, or Atet. The town was identified by Champollion with Bactria (Lettres ecrites d’iJgypte, 2nd edit., pp. 267, 268, compared with 287), then transferred to Mesopotamia by Eosellini, in the land of Omira, which, according to Pliny {Hist. Nat., v. 24), was close to the Taurus {Monumenti Storici, vol. hi., pt. 1, pp. 441-443), not far from the Khabur or from the province of Aleppo (Birch, Observations on the Statistical Tablet of KarnaJ:, pp. 19-23) ; Osburn {Egypt, her Testimony to the Truth, pp. 65, 66, 85, 86) tried to connect it with Hadashah {Josh. xv. 21), an Amorite town in the southern part of the tribe of Judah; while Hincks placed it in Edessa (Eeport Syro-Egypt. Soc., 1847, p. 6 ; cf. Brugsch, Beiseberichte aus Mgypten, p. 1 26). The reading Kedesh, Kadesh, Qodshu, the result of the observations of Lepsius, has finally prevailed. Brugsch connected this name with that of Bahr el-Kades, a designation attached in the Middle Ages to the lake through which the Orontes flows, and placed the town on its shores or on a small island on the lake (Geo. Ins., vol. ii. pp. 21, 23). Thomson {The Land and the Booh, p. 110) pointed out Tell Neby-Mendeh, the ancient Laodicea of the Lebanon, as satisfying the requirements of the site. Conder developed this idea, and showed that all the conditions prescribed by the Egyptian texts in regard to Qodshu find here, and here alone, their application {Kadesh, in Pal. Expl. Fund, Quarterly Statement, 1881, pp. 163-173). The description given in the text is based on Conder’s observations. ' Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph : cf.

flying bridges, which could be opened or shut at pleasure. Once the bridges
were raised and the gates closed, the boldest enemy had no resource left but to
arm himself with patience and settle down to a lengthened siege. The invader,
fresh from a victory at Megiddo, and following up his good fortune in a forward
movement, had to reckon upon further and serious resistance at this point, and
to prepare himself for a second conflict. The Amorite chiefs and their allies
had the advantage of a level and firm ground for the evolutions of their
chariots during the attack, while, if they were beaten, the citadel afforded them
a secure rallying-place, whence, having gathered their shattered troops, they
could regain their respective countries, or enter, with the help of a few devoted
men, upon a species of guerilla warfare in which they excelled.
The road from Damascus led to a point south of Qodshu, while that from
PhuBuicia came right up to the town itself or to its immediate neighbourhood.
The dyke of Bahr el-lvacles served to keep the plain in a dry condition, and thus
secured for numerous towns, among which Hamath stood out pre-eminently,
a prosperous existence.^ Beyond Hamath,^ and to the left, between the
Orontes and the sea, lay the commercial kingdom of Alasia, protected from
the invader by bleak mountains.^ On the right, between the Orontes and
the Balikh, extended the land of rivers, Naharaim. Towns had grown up
here thickly,—on the sides of the torrents from the Amanos, along the banks
of rivers, near springs or wells—wherever, in fact, the presence of water
made culture possible. The fragments of the Egyptian chronicles which have
come down to us number these towns by the hundred,^ and yet of how many
more must the records have perished with the crumbling Theban walls upon
which the Pharaohs had their names incised! Khalabu was the Aleppo of our

upon one of its rivals.^ The boundaries of this portion of the Lower Lotanu
have come down to us in a singularly indefinite form, and they must also,
moreover, have been subject to continual modifications from the results of
tribal conflicts. We are at a loss to know whether the various principalities
were accustomed to submit to the leadership of a single individual, or whether
we are to relegate to the region of popular fancy that Lord of Naharaim of
whom the Egyptian scribes made
such a hero in their fantastic narra
tives.^ Carchemish represented in
this region the position occupied by
Megiddo in relation to Kharu, and by
Qodshu among the Amorites; that is
to say, it was the citadel and sanctuary
of the surrounding country. Who
ever could make himself master of it
would have the whole country at his
feet. It lay upon the Euphrates, the winding of the river protecting it on its
southern and south-eastern sides, while around its northern front ran a deep
stream, its defence being further completed by a double ditch across the inter
vening region. Like Qodshu, it was thus situated in the midst of an artificial island
beyond the reach of the battering-ram or the sapper. The encompassing wall,
which tended to describe an ellipse, hardly measured two miles in circumference ;
but the suburbs extending, in the midst of villas and gardens, along the river
banks furnished in time of peace an abode for the surplus population. The wall
still rises some five and twenty to thirty feet above the plain. Two mounds divided
by a ravine command its north-western side, their summits being occupied by
the ruins of two fine buildings — a temple and a palace.® Carchemish was the

Nirab is mentioned under the form Nrjpa^os by Nicholas of Damascus {Frag. 25, in Mdller-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grxcorum, vol. iii. p. 372). Nil, long confounded with Nineveh after Champolliou {Gram, dgyptienne, p. 150), was identified by Lenormant {Les Origines, vol. iii. p. 316, et seq.) with Ninus Vetus, Membidj, and by Max Muller {Asien und Europa, p. 267) with Balls on the Euphrates: I am inclined to make it Kefer-Naya, between Aleppo and Turmanin.

last stage in a conqueror’s march coming from the south. For an invader
approaching from the east or north it formed his first station. He had before
him, in fact, a choice of the three chief fords for crossing the Euphrates.
That of Thapsacus, at the bend of the river where it turns eastward to the
Arabian plain, lay too far to the south, and it could be reached only after
a march through a parched and desolate region where the army would run
the risk of perishing from thirst. For an invader proceeding from Asia Minor,
or intending to make his way through the defiles of the Taurus, Samosata
offered a convenient fording-place ; but this route would compel the general,
who had Naharaim or the kingdoms of Chaldma in view, to make a long
detour, and although the Assyrians used it at a later period, at the time of
their expeditions to the valley of the Halys, the Egyptians do not seem ever
to have travelled by this road. Carchemish, the place of the third ford, was
about equally distant from Thapsacus and Samosata, and lay in a rich and
(Hincks, An Attempt to ascertain the Number, etc., of the Hieroglyphic Alphabet, p. 46; Birch, Ohs. on the Statisticnl Tablet of Karnak, p. 15) ; but as the latter was wrongly identified with Circesium, it was naturally located at the confluence of the Khahur with the Euphrates. Hincks {Hi^roglyphes et Cuneiformes, in Chabas ,Mglanges Egyptologiques, 2nd series, p. 280) fixed the site at Eum-Kaleh. G. Rawlinson (Carchemish, in Smith’s Diet.) referred it cursorily to Hierapolis-JIabog, which position Maspero (De Carchemis Oppidi situ et historid antiquissimd, 1873) endeavoured to confirm. Finzi (Ricerche per lo Studio dell Antichita Assira, pp. 257, 260), and after him G. Smith, thought to find the site at .Jerabis, the ancient Europos (Fe. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies? p. 256), and excavations carried on there by the English have brought to light in this place Hittite monuments which go back in part to the Assyrian epoch. This identification is now generally accepted (cf. J. jMenant, KarKemish, sa position d'apres les d^couvertes modernes, 1891), although tliere is still no direct proof attainable, and competent judges (Wilson, Recent Bibl. Researches, in the Pal. Expl. Fund, Quart. Stat., 1884, p. 49) continue to prefer the site of Memhij. I fall in with the current view, but with all reserve.

not be likely to enter into the expectations of its inhabitants. Hither pilgrims,
merchants, soldiers, and all the wandering denizens of the world were accus

the habit once established was
perpetuated for centuries.^ On
the left bank of the river, and

Inschr., vol. i. pis. 11, 12, 16, 17) ; but its importance was not recognised until after the discovery of the Tel el-Amarna tablets and of its situation (W. Max JMullee, Asien und Europa, pp. 281-286). The fact that a letter from the Prince of IMitanni is stated in a Hieratic docket to liave come from Naharaim (Erman, Nachtrag zu Winclder's Verzeichniss, in the Zeitschrijt, 1889, V(d. xxvii. p. 63) has been used as a proof that the countries were identical (Erman, Her Tiumtafclfund von Tell-Amarna, in the Berliner Sitzungsherichte, 1888, vol. ii. p. 584 ; also tlie observations of Schrader, p. 587 : cf. Brugscii, I'he Land Mitani on the Egyptian Monuments, in the Proceedings of the American Oriental Society, vol. xiv. pp. clxiv.-clxvii.) ; I have shown that the docket proves only tliat Mitanni formed a part of Naharaim (Journ. des B^hats, October 12, 1888). It extended over tlie province of Edessa and Harran, stretching out towards the sources of tlie Tigris (cf. Jensen, Vorstudien znr Entziffering des Mitanni, in tlie Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. vi. p. 62). Niebuhr places it on the southern slope of the Masios, in Mygdonia (Studien und Bemerhungen zur Geschichte des Alien Orients, i. pp. 88-96) ; Th. Reinach connects it with the Matieni (Un Peuple ouhJi^, les Matienes, in the Revue des Etudes Grecques, 1894, pp. 317, 318), and asks whether this was not the region occupied by this people before their emigration towards the Caspian. ^ Several of the Tel el-Amarna tablets are couched in this language, and three experts are now engaged in an attempt to decipher them (Jensen, Vorstudien zur Entzifferung des Mitanni, in the Zeitschrift fUr Assyriologie, vol. v. pp. 166-208, and vol. vi. pp. 34-72 ; Brunnow, Bie Mitani- Sprache, ibid., vol.

distribution of the Canaanites, Amorites, and Aramaeans, and to indicate the
precise points where they came into contact with their rivals of non-Semitic
stock. Frontiers between races and languages can never be very easily de
termined, and this is especially true of the peoples of Syria. They are so
broken up and mixed in this region, that even in neighbourhoods where one
predominant tribe is concentrated, it is easy to find at every step representatives
of all the others. Four or five townships, singled out at random from the middle
of a province, would often be found to belong to as many different races, and
their respective inhabitants, while living within a distance of a mile or two,
would be as great strangers to each other as if they were separated by the
breadth of a continent.^ It would appear that the breaking up of these
populations had not been carried so far in ancient as in modern times, but the
confusion must already have been great if we are to judge from the number of
different sites where we encounter evidences of people of the same language and

blood. The bulk of the Khati had not yet departed, from the Taurus region,
but some stray bands of them, carried away by the movement which led to the
invasion of the Hyksos, had. settled around Hebron, where the rugged, nature of
the country served to protect them from their neighbours.^ The Amorites had
their head - quarters around
Qodshu^ in Ccele-Syria, but one
section of them had taken up
a position on the shores of the
Lake of Tiberias in Galilee,
others had established them
selves within a short distance
of Jaffa ^ on the Mediterranean,
while others had settled in the
neighbourhood of the southern
Hittites in such numbers that
their name in the Hebrew Scrip
tures was at times employed
to designate the western moun
tainous region about the Dead
Sea and the valley of the Jordan,® Their presence was also indicated on
the table-lands bordering the desert of Damascus, in the districts frequented
by Bedouin of the tribe of Terah, Ammon and Moab, on the rivers Yarmuk and
Jabbok, and at Edrei and Heshbon.® The fuller, indeed, our knowledge is
' In very early times they are described as dwelling near Hebron or in the mountains of Judab (Gen. xxiii., xxv. 9, 10, xxvi. 34, 35, xlix. 29-32; Numh. xiii. 29; cf. Josh. xi. 3). Since we have learned from the Egyptian and Assyrian monuments that the Kliati dwelt in Northern Syria, the majority of commentators have been indisposed to admit the existence of southern Hittites ; this name, it is alleged, having been introduced into tlie Biblical text tbroiigb a misconception of tlie original documents, where the term Hittite was the equivalent of Canaanite (Ed. Meyer, Gesch. des Alterthums, vol. i. pp. 213, 214 ; Bcdue, Die Biblische Urgeschichte, p. 347, n. 1 ; Stade, Geschichte des Volhes Israels, vol. i. p, 143). ^ Cf. the present volume, pp. 18, 19, 142, 143. Ed. Meyer, Kritilc der Beriohte uber die Eroherung raliistina’s, in the Zeitschrift fur alttestamentUche Wissenschaft, 1881, vol. i. p. 117, et seq., and vol. iii. p. 306, et scq., has established the fact tliat the term Amorite, as well as the parallel word Canaanite, was the designation of the inhabitants of Palestine before the arrival of the Hebrews : the former belonged to the prevailing tradition in the kingdom of Israel, the latter to that which was current in Judah (cf. Winckler, Geschichte Israels, vol. i. pp. 51-54). Tliis view confirms the conclusion which may be drawn from the Egyptian monuments as to the power of expansion and the
diffusion of the people ; cf. for the Egyptian side of the question, W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp 229-233.

Revised Version the “ ascent of Akrabbim.” — Tn.] to the south-west of the Dead Sea (Judges i. 36). ® This was afterwards the domain of Sihon, King of the Amorites (Numb. xxi. 21-32, 34 ; Deid. ii. 24, iii. 2, xxix. 7; Judges xi. 19-23), and that of Og (Numh. xxi. 33-35; Dent. iii. 8-11, xxix. 7).

of the condition of Syria at the time of the Egyptian conquest, the more we
are forced to recognise the mixture of races therein, and their almost infinite
subdivisions. The mutual jealousies, however, of these elements of various
origin were not so inveterate as to put an obstacle in the way, I will not say
of political alliances, but of daily intercourse and frequent contracts. Owing
to intermarriages between the tribes,
and the continual crossing of the
results of such unions, peculiar cha
racteristics were at length eliminated,
and a uniform type of face was the
result. From north to south one
special form of countenance, that
which we usually call Semitic, pre
vailed among them.^ The Syrian
and Egyptian monuments furnish us
everywhere, under different ethnical
names, with representations of a
broad-shouldered people of high sta

with a fatal tendency to obesity in old age.
narrow, and artificially flattened or deformed, like those of several modern tribes
in the Lebanon.^ Their high cheek-bones stand out from their hollow cheeks,
and their blue or black eyes are buried under their enormous eyebrows. The
lower part of the face is square and somewhat heavy, but it is often concealed
by a thick and curly beard. The forehead is rather low and retreating, while
the nose has a distinctly aquiline curve. The type is not on the whole so fine
as the Egyptian, but it is not so heavy as that of the Chaldseans in the time of
Gudea. The Theban artists have represented it in their battle-scenes, and while
individualising every soldier or Asiatic prisoner with a happy knack so as to avoid
monotony, they have with much intelligence impressed upon all of them the
marks of a common parentage. One feels that the artists must have recognised
them as belonging to one common family. They associated with their efforts
after true and exact representation a certain caustic humour, which impelled
them often to substitute for a portrait a more or less jocose caricature of their

Max Muller, Asieii und Europa, pp. 293, 294, and, in a contrary sense, Sayoe, The Paces of the Old Testament, pp. 100-129, who distinguishes several types on the Egyptian monuments: the Amorites must have had the same physiognomy, and must have belonged to the same race as the Libyans of the monuments (cf. Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine,
pp. 47, 48). ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Petrie, Racial Types, No. 222. Hamy, Etude sur lee peintures ethniques d'un Tombeau Th^hain dela XVIIP dynastie, pp. 12, 13.

adversaries. On the walls of the Pylons, and in places where the majesty of a
god restrained them from departing too openly from their official gravity, they
contented themselves with exaggerating from panel to panel the
contortions and pitiable expressions of the captive chiefs as they
followed behind the triumphal chariot of the Pharaoh on his
return from his Syrian campaigns.^ Where religious scruples
offered no obstacle they abandoned themselves to the inspi
ration of the moment, and gave themselves freely up to carica
ture. It is an Amorite or Canaanite —that thick-lipped, flat
nosed slave, with his brutal lower jaw and smooth conical
skull— who serves for the handle of a spoon in the museum
of the Louvre. The stupefied air with which he trudges
under his burden is rendered in the most natural manner,
and the flattening to which his forehead had been subjected
in infancy is unfeelingly accentuated. The model which
served for this object must have been intentionally brutalised
and disfigured in order to excite the laughter of Pharaoh’s
subjects.^
The idea of uniformity with which we are impressed when
examining the faces of these people is confirmed and extended
when we come to study their costumes. Men and women
we may say all Syrians according to their condition of life
had a choice between only two or three modes of dress, which,
whatever the locality, or whatever the period, seemed never to change.'* On
closer examination slight shades of difference in cut and arrangement may,
however, be detected, and it may be affirmed that fashion ran even in ancient
' Au illustration of this will be found in the line of prisoners, brought by Seti I. from his great Asiatic campaign, which is depicted on the outer face of the north wall of the hypostyle at Karnak (CiiAMPOLLiON, Monuments de V Egypte, etc., pi. ccxcii. ; Eosellini, Monumenti Storici, pi. L). With regard to the humorous representation of foreign races on the Egyptian monuments of the second empire, see Eeman, Mgyjpten und Aiijyptisclies Lehen, p. 084. ^ Dr. Eegnault, Les D^'ormations crdniennes, etc. (in La Nature, vol. xxii. pp. 157, 158), thinks that the head was artificially deformed in infency ; the bandage necessary to efiect it must have been applied very low on the forehead in front, and to the whole occiput behind. If this is the case, the instance is not an isolated one, for a deformation of a similar character is found in the case of the numerous Semites represented on the tomb of Eakhmiri : a similar practice still obtains in certain parts of modern Syria (Hamy, Etude sur les Pcintures ethniques ... de la XVIIP dynastie, pp. 12, 13) ; see p. 119 of this volume. “ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the original wooden object (consigned to the Louvre since Champollion’s travels) : cf.

variations, which were evident to the eyes of the people of the time, are not
sufficiently striking to enable us to classify the people, or to fix their date.
The peasants and the lower
class of citizens required
no other clothing than a
loin-cloth similar to that
of the Egyptians,^ or a
shirt of a yellow or white
colour, extending below
the knees, and furnished
with short sleeves.^ The
opening for the neck was
cruciform, and the hem
was usually ornamented
with coloured needle
work or embroidery. The burghers and nobles wore over this a long strip of
cloth, which, after passing closely round the hips and chest, was brought up and
spread over the shoulders as a sort of cloak.^ This was not made of the light
material used in Egypt, which offered no protection from cold or rain, but was
composed of a thick, rough wool, like that employed in Chaldsea, and was
commonly adorned with stripes or bands of colour, in addition to spots and other
conspicuous designs. Rich and fashionable folk substituted for this cloth two
large shawls—one red and the other blue—in which they dexterously arrayed
themselves so as to alternate the colours : ® a belt of soft leather gathered the

the little ones among the Egyp
tians.^ With the exception of bracelets, anklets, rings
on the fingers, and occasionally necklaces and earrings, the
Syrians, both men and women, wore little jewellery. The
Chaldsean women furnished them with models of fashion
to which they accommodated themselves in the choice of
stuffs, colours, cut of their mantles or petticoats, arrangement
of the hair, and the use of cosmetics for the eyes and cheeks.
In spite of distance the modes of Babylon reigned supreme. The
Syrians would have continued to expose their right shoulder to
the weather as long as it pleased the people of the Lower Euphrates
to do the same ; but as soon as the fashion changed in the latter
region, and it became customary to cover the shoulder, and to wrap
the upper part of the person in two or three thicknesses of heavy wool,
they at once accommodated themselves to the new mode, although
it served to restrain the free motion of the body. Among the
upper classes, at least, domestic arrangements were modelled upon

* Examples of Syrian feminine costume are somewhat rare on the Egyptian monuments. In the scenes of the capturing of towns we see a few. Here the women are represented on the walls imploring the mercy of the besieger (Champollion, Mon. de VEgypte, pis. xii., Ixv., civ. 1, where the draughtsman has restored the head of a male figure; Eosellini, iHow. jSion'cf, Ixvii., Ixviii., Ixxx.

154 SYRIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST.
From all that we can gather, in short, from the silence as well as from the
misunderstandings of the Egyptian chroniclers, Syria stands before us as a
fruitful and civilized country, of which one might be thankful to be a native,
in spite of continual wars and frequent revolutions.
The religion of the Syrians was subject to the same influences as their
customs ; we are, as yet, far from being able to draw a complete picture of
their theology, but such knowledge as we do possess recalls the same names
and the same elements as are found in the religious systems of Chaldma.^ The
myths, it is true, are still vague and misty, at least to our modern ideas; the
general characteristics of the principal divinities alone stand out, and seem
fairly well defined. As with the other Semitic races, the deity in a general
sense, the primordial type of the godhead, was called El or Ilh, and his
feminine counterpart Hat, but we find comparatively few cities in which these
nearly abstract beings enjoyed the veneration of the faithful.^ The gods of Syria,
like those of Egypt and of the countries watered by the Euphrates, were feudal
princes distributed over the surface of the earth, their number corresponding with
that of the independent states. Each nation, each tribe, each city, worshipped
its own lord Acloni '^—or its master BaaP— and each of these was designated
by a special title to distinguish him from neighbouring Baalim, or masters.
The Baal who ruled at Zebub was styled “ Master of Zebub,” or Baal-Zebub ;
®
found even in the XX“‘ dynasty (Cuampollion, Mon. de VEgypte, pi. xxix. ; Eosellini, Mon. Ecali, pi. clviii.). The Tel el-Aiuarna tablets prove that, as far as the scribes were concerned, the customs and training of Syria and Chalda3a were identical. The Syrian princes are there represented as employing the cuneiform character in their correspondence, being accompanied by scribes brought up after the Chaldsean manner. (For the materials used by the scribe, see Dawn of Civilization, p. 370, et seq.) We shall see later on that the king of the Khati, who represented in the time of Ramses II. the type of an accomplished Syrian, had attendants similar to those of the Chaldaean kings. * The Syrian deities which have been reproduced by the Egyptians on their monuments have been studied by M. de YogHe, Melanges d’Arch.

Max Mullek, Asien und Europa, pp. 300-318. ~ The frequent occurrence of the term Ilu or El in names of towns in Southern Syria seems to indicate pretty conclusively that the inhabitants of these countries used this term by preference to designate their supreme god (Maspeuo, Sur les Nonis Gdograph. de la liste de Thoutmos III., etc,, p. 10; cf. Bitsliailu, on p. 133, n. 4, of the present work). Similarly we meet with it in Aramaic names (Levy, Phdnizische Stud., ii. 20, 31, 32), and later on among theNabath8Bans(M. de Vogue, Inscr. Semit., p. 107) it predominates at Byblos and Berytus (cf. pp. 172, 178, 170 of the present work) in Phoenicia and among the Aramaic peoples of North Syria; in the Samalla country, for instance, during the VHP'' century b.o. (Halevy, Deux Inscriptions he't€ennes de Zindjirli, in the Revue Se'mitique, vol. ii. p. 28). ® The extension of this term to Syrian countries is proved in the Israelitish epoch by Cauaanitish names, such as Adonizedek (Josli,. x. 1) and Adonibezek {Judges i. 5-7), or Jewish names such as Adonijah (2 Sam. iii. 4 ; 2 Chron. xvii. 8 ; Neh. x. 16), Adonikam {Ezra ii. 13, viii. 13), AdoniramAdoram (2 Sam. xx. 24; 1 Kings iv. 6, xii. 18). ’ Movers tried to prove that there was one particular god named Baal {Die Phonizier, vol. i. pp. 160-100), and his ideas, ijojiularised in France by M. de Vogue {Melanges di Arch. Orientate, pp. 5053), prevailed for some time : since then scholars have gone back to the view of Miinter {Religion der Karthaginicr, p. 5, et seq.) and of the writers at the beginning of this century, who regarded the term Baal as a common epithet applicable to all gods. Baal-Zcbub was worshipped at Ekron during the Philistine supremacy (2 Kings i. 2). As to

[This is not quite certain, as the last character of the name is written ma instead of 6a, and Bezold claims
to have found the name of hil-zabahi in one of the Konyunjik tablets. — Ed.] * The mountain of Baal-Hermon {Judges iii. 3 ; cf. 1 Chron. v. 23) is the mountain of Baniks, where the Jordan has one of its sources, and the town of Baal-Hermon is Banias itself. The variant Baal-Gad occurs several times in the Biblical books {Josh. xi. 17, xii. 7, xiii. 5); as to Gad the goddess of good luck, cf. p. 158 of the present work. * Baal-Berith, like Baal-Zebub, only occurs, so far as we know at present, in the Hebrew Scriptures {Judges viii. 33, ix. 4, 46), where, by the way, the first element, Baal, is changed to El, El-Berith (ix. 46). “ Drawn by Faueher-Gudin, from coloured sketches by Prisse d’Avennes, Au Mus. d'Hist. naturelle. ^ This appears under the name Or or Ur in the Samalla inscriptions of the VIIP'^ century B.c. (Halevy, Sur deux Inscriptions het^ennes de Zindjirli, in the Bevue SJmitique, vol. ii. pp. 29, 30); it is, so far, a unique instance among the Semites. ^ The designation of this god is found among the Canaanites in the names of cities such as Bethshemesh or Irshemesh {Josh. xv. 10, xxi. 10 ; 1 Sam. vi. 12 ; 1 Chron. vi. 59, etc.), Shemeshaduma (Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Gram., etc., in the Zeitschrift, 1879, p. 126 ; cf.W. Max Muller, Europa und Asien, pp. 265, 316). He is repeatedly mentioned in the texts of Tel el-Amarna, among the titles given to the Pharaoh ; we meet with it again in the Samalla inscriptions of the VHP'' century b.c. in Southern Syria (Halevy, Deux Inscrip. h€tfynnes de Zind., in Bevue Se'mit., vol. ii. p. 29).
® We find the term applied in the Bible lo the national god of the Ammonites, under the forms Moloch, Molech, Millcom, Milkdm, and especially with the article, Ham-moleh ; the real name hidden beneath this epithet was probably Ammon or Amman, and, strictly speaking, the god Moloch only exists in the imagination of scholars (for a contrary opinion, however, cf. Baddissin, lahve et Moloch, etc., pp. 24-36). The epithet was used among the Canaanites in the name Melchizedek {Gen. xiv. 18), a similar form to Adonizedek {Josh. x. 1), Abimelech (Gew. xx. 2; Judges ix. 1), Ahimelech (1 Sam. xxi. 1); it w'as in cuirent use among the Phoenicians, in reference to the god of Tyre, Mclek-Karta or Melkarth, and in many proper names, such as Melekiathon (M. de Vogue,

Mdanrjes d' Arch. Orientale, pp. 5, 6), Baalmelek, Bodmalek, etc., not to mention the god Milichus worshipped in Spain (SiLins Italicus, iii. 104), who was really none other than Melkarth. As to the identification of Melek with the Chaldaean Malik, cf. Savce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 82, 258, 259. ’ The character and nature of the god Beslieph or Rashuf were elucidated by M. db Vogue, Mglanges d'Arch. Orientale, pp. 49, 78-92. The Egyptian name of the god had been read as Eenpu by the early Egyptologists (Wilkinson, Manners and Customs, 1st edit., vol. iii. pp. 234, 235, and pi. iv. ; Peisse d’Avennes, Monuments Egyptiens, pi. xxvii., and Notice sur les Antiquit^s Egyptiennes du Mus€e Britannique, pp. 17, 18; E. db Rouge, Letter inserted in Lajard, Recherches sur le Culte du Cypres Pyramidal, etc., in the Me'm. de VAcad. des Inscriptions et Belles-Letti-es,Tol. xx., pt. 2, p. 174); Birch was the first to restore it to its real form {MCmoire sur une Patere Egyptienne du Mus^e du Louvre, p. 59). Rashuf has since been made an object of study by Ed. Meyer, Uher einige Semitische Goiter, in the Zeitschrift der D. Morgenl. Gesellschaft, 1877, Yol. xxi. p. 710 ; by Clermont-Ganneau, Jlorus et Saint Georges, d’apres un bas-relief in€dit du Louvre, pp. 15-25, and Recueil d’Arch. Orientale, vol. i. pp. 176-182 ; by Ledrain, Algypto-Semitica, in the Gazette ArclMologique, 1880, pp. 199-202 ; by PiETSCHMANN, Geschichte der Phbnizier, pp. 149-152 ; by W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 311, 312; and by Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 250, 251, 256. Resheph has been vocalised Rashuf in deference to the Egy[)tian orthography Rashupu. It was a name common to a whole family of lightning and storm-gods, and M. de Rouge pointed out long ago the passage in the Great Inscription of Ramses III. at Medinet-Habu, in which the soldiers who man the chariots are compared to the Rashupu; the Rabbinic Hebrew still employs this plural form in the sense of “demons” (M. de VoGii^ Mdanges d'Arch. Orientale, pp. 76-79 ; cf. W. IMax Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 313). The Phoenician inscriptions contain references to several local Rashufs ; the way in which this god is coupled with the goddess Qodshu on the Egyptian stelaj leads me to think that, at the epoch now under consideration, lie was specially worshipped by the Amorites, just as his equivalent Hadad was by the inhabitants of Damascus, neighbours of the Amorites, and perhaps themselves Amorites (cf. p. 142 of the present work). “ Hadad and Rimmoii are represented in Assyro-Chaldiean by one and the same ideogram, which may be read either Dadda-Hadad or Rammanu ; cf. on this point what is said in Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 658, note 5. The identity of the expressions employed shows how close the connection between the two divinities must have been, even if they' were not similar in all respects ; from the Hebrew writings we know of the temple of Rimmon at Damascus (2 Kings v. 18) and that one of the kings of that city was called Tahrimmon = “Rimmon is good” (1 Kings xv. 18), while Hadad gave
his name to no less than ten kings of the same city (Nicholas of Dauascvs, Fragm. 31, in MullerDidot, Fragm. Hist. Grxe., vol. iii. p. 373 ; cf. Josephus, Ant. Jud., VII. v. 2). Even as late as the Grmco-Roman epoch, kingship over the other gods was still attributed both to Rimmon (Hesychius8. V. 'Paulas, compared with Stephen op Byzantium, s. v. 'Pa/idveas, who again quotes Philo of Byblos ashis authority; cf. Mlller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. (irac.,!^!. iii.p.575)and to Hadad (Philo op Byblos, Fragm. 2, § 24, in Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grasc., vol. iii. p. 569 ; Macrobius, Saturn., i. 23), but
this latter was identified with the sun. As to the true status of Rimmon and Hadad, cf. Schrader, Ramman-Pi immun, in the Zeitschrift fur prot. Theologie, 1875, vol. i. p, 334, et seq., 342, and Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Test., 2nd edit., pp. 205, 206; Baudissin, Studien zur Semit. Eeligionsgeseh., vol. i. p]!. 305-317 ; Sayce, The Higher Criticism, pp. 89, 394, and Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 82, 257. “ The documents which wc jicssess in regard to Dagon date from the Hebrew epoch, and represent him as worshipped by the Philistines {Judges xvi. 23-30 ; 1 Sam. v. 2 ; 1 Citron, x. 10). We know, however, from the Tel el-Amarna tablets, of a Dagantakala(BEZOLD-BuDGE, The Tell Amarna Tablets, p. Ixxxiii.), a name which proves the presence of the god among the Cauaanites long before the Philis
tine invasion, and we find two Beth-Dagons— one in the plain of Judah {Josh. xv. 41), the other in the tribe of Asher {Josh. xix. 27) ; Philo of Byblos makes Dagon a Phoenician deity {Fragm. 2, § 14, 25 ; Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grsec., vol. iii. pp. 567-569), and declares him to be the genius
of fecundity, master of grain and of labour. The representation of his statue which appears on the Grfeco-Roman coins of Abydos, reminds us of the fish-god of Chaldma (cf. Maspero, Davvn of Civilization, pp. 546,547); as to his attributes, cf. Clermont-Ganneau, PJorHS et Saint Georges, cV aprh du bas-relief in€dit du Louvre, pp. 12, 13, 22, 24-31 ; Pietschmann, Geschichte der Phonizier, pji. 144-146, and Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 259, 260.

of Carmel. Eashuf is the only one whose appearance is known to us. He
possessed the restless temperament usually attributed to the thunder-gods,
and was, accordingly, pictured as a soldier armed with javelin and mace,
bow and buckler ; a gazelle’s head with pointed horns surmounts his helmet,
and sometimes, it may
be, serves him as a cap.
Each god had for his com
plement a goddess, who
was proclaimed “ mis
tress ” of the city, Baalat,
or “ queen,” Milkat, of
heaven, just as the god
himself was recognised as
“ master ” or “ king.” ^
As a rule, the goddess
was contented with the generic name of Astarte ; but to this was often added
some epithet, which lent her a distinct personality, and prevented her from
being confounded with the Astartes of neighbouring cities, her companions or
rivals.^ Thus she would be styled the “good” Astarte, Ashtoreth Naamah,^
or the “ horned ” Astarte, Ashtoreth Qarnaim, because of the lunar crescent
which appears on her forehead, as a sort of head-dress.® She was the goddess
' As to the general character of the goddesses, cf. Ed. Meter, Geschichte des Altertliums, vol. i. pp. 211, 246-248, 250, 251. Arnong goddesses to whom the title “Baalat” was referred, we have the goddess of Byblos, Baalat-Gebal {Corpus Ins. Semit, vol. i. pp. 4, 5), also the goddess of Berytus, BaalatBerith, or Boyrnt (Philo op Byblos, Fragm. § 12, in Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxc., vol. iii. p. 567). The epithet “ queen of heaven ” is apiplied to the Phcsnician Astarte by Hebrew {Jer. vii. 18, xliv. 18-29) and classic writers (Herodi.\nt3S, v. 6, 10 ; ObpavCav ^oiviKes ’Aarpodpxv^ ovo/j.d^ov<Tt, (T^Xrivriv ehai eeAoyres}. The Egyptians, when they adopted these Canaanitish goddesses, preserved tlie title, and called each of them mbit pit, “lady of heaven” (Prisse d’Avennnes, Monuments Egyptiens, pi. xsxvii. and p. 7 ; Bergmann, Die Inschriftliclie Denhmdler, in the Recueil de Travau.r, vol. vii. p. 196). In the Phoenician inscriptions their names are frequently preceded by the word Rahhat : rabbat Baalat-Gebal, “ (my) lady Baalat-Gebal ” {Gorp. Ins. Semit., vol. i. p. 4). 2 Drawn by Faucher-Guden, from a copy of an original in chased gold ; cf. Prisse d’Avennes, Eist. de V Art Egyptien, p. 99. ^ The Hebrew writers frequently refer to the Canaanite goddesses by the general title “ the Ashtaroth” or “Astartes” {Judges ii. 13, x. 6 ; 1 Sam. vii. 3, 4, xii. 10), and a town in Northern Syria
bore the significant name of Istarati = “ the Ishtars, the Ashtaroth ” (Bezold-Budge, The Tell Amarna
Tablets, No. 43, pi. 88, 1. 10), a name which finds a parallel in Anathoth = “ the Anats,” a title assumed by a town of the tribe of Benjamin; similarly, the Assyro-Chaldasans called their goddesses by the plural of Ishtar (cf. Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 674). The inscription on an Egyptian amulet in the Louvre tells us of a personage of the XX'** dynasty, who, from his name, Eabrabina, must have been of Syrian origin, and who styled himself “ Prophet of the Astartes,” Honndtib Astiratu (Maspero, Mdmoire sur guelques Papyrus du Louvre, pp. 2, 3 ; cf. W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, etc., p. 313, n. 5). * This is the Astronoe mentioned by Damascius, a name which ought rather to be written ^AaTpovdjjLt], as suggested by Movers {Die Phonizier, vol. i. p. 636, et seq. ; cf. Fr. Lenorjiant, Lettres Assyriologiques, vol. ii. p. 285, note 1). ^ The two-horned Astarte gave her name to a city beyond the Jordan, of which she was, probably, the eponymous goddess {Gen. xiv. 5) : she would seem to be represented on the curious monument called by the Arabs “ the stone of Job,” which was discovered by M. Schumacher in the centre of the Hauran (in the Zeitschrift des Palestina Vereins, vol. xiv. p. 142, et seq. ; cf. vol. xv. p. 206). It was

of good luck, and was called Gad ;
^ she was Anat,^ or Asiti,^ the chaste and the
warlike. The statues sometimes represent her as a sphinx with a woman’s head,
but more often as a woman standing on a lion passant, either nude, or encircled
round the hips by merely a girdle, her hands filled with flowers or with serpents,
her features framed in a mass of heavy tresses—a faithful type of the priestesses
whodevoted themselves to her service, the Qedeshot. She was the goddess of love in
its animal, or rather in its purely physical, aspect, and in this capacity was styled
Qaddishat the Holy, like the hetairse of her family ; Qodshu, the Amorite capital,
was consecrated to her service, and she was there associated with Eashuf, the
thiinder-god.^ But she often comes before us as a warlike Amazon, brandishing
a club, lance, or shield, moiinted on horseback like a soldier, and wandering
through the desert in quest of her prey.'^ This dual temperament rendered
her a goddess of uncertain attributes and of violent contrasts ; at times
reserved and chaste, at other times shameless and dissolute, but always cruel,
an analogous goddess whom the Egyptians sometimes identified with their Hathor, and whom they represented as crowned with a crescent. • Gad, tiie goddess of fortune, is mainly known to us in eonnection with the Aramaeans ; we find mention made of lier by the Hebrew writers {Isa. Ixv. 11), and geographical names, such as Baal-Gad and Migdol-Gad (Josh. xi. 17, xv. 37), prove that she must have been worshipped at a very early date in the Canaanite countries. - Anat, or Anaiti, or Aniti, has been found in a Phoenician inscription by M. de Vogue, Melanges d’ArcJi. Orientale, pp. 3G-38, which enables us to reconstruct the history of the goddess (ibid., p. 41, et seq.). Her worship was largely practised among the Canaanites, as is proved by the existence in the Hebrew epoch of several towns, such as Beth-Anath (Josh. xix. 38 ; Judges i. 33), Beth-Anoth (Josh. XV. 59), Anathoth (Josh. xxi. 18 ; 1 Kings ii. 20 ; Jer. i. 1, xxix. 27) ; at least one of which, BitAniti, is mentioned in the Egyptian geographical lists (BIariette, Les Listes G^ographiques des Pylones de Karnak, p. 42; Kart-Aniti is a correction by BV. BIax BIuller, As/en m?i(Z Eitropa, p. 195). The appearance of Anat-Aniti is known to us, as she is represented in Egyptian dress on several stelae of the XIX‘'' and XX‘'‘ dynasties : cf. Prisse d’Avennes, Monuments Egyptiens, pi. xxxvii. Her name, like that of Astarte, had become a generic term, in the plural form Anathoth, for a whole group of goddesses : cf. as to her attributes, Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 256, 257. “ Asiti is represented at Eadcsieh, on a stele of the time of Seti I. (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 138; cf. Golenisciiefe, Vne Excursion a B^r^nicc, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xiii. p. 76, where the correct reading is given for the first time) ; she enters into the composition of a compound name, Asitiiakhuru (perhaps “ the goddess of Asiti is enflamed with anger ”), which we find on a monument in the Vienna Bluseum (E. he Bergmann, Inschriftliche Denkmdler, in the Becueil, vol. vii. p. 196). W. BIax BIuller makes her out to have been a divinity of the desert (Asien und Europa, pp. 316, 317), and the place in which the picture representing her was found would seem to justify this hypothesis; the Egyjitians connected her, as well as the other Astartes, with Sit-Typhon, owing to her cruel and warlike character. * Qaddishat is known to us from the Egyptian monuments referred to above, p. 157, note 5. The name was sometimes written Qodshu, like that of the town ; E. de Eouge argued from this that Qaddishat must have been the eponymous divinity of Qodshu (BI. de Vogue, Melanges d’Arch. Orientale, p. 44), and that her real name was Kashit or Kesh (Robiod, Legons de M. de Bouge, etc., in the Melanges d’Arch. Bgypt. et Assyr., vol. ii. p. 269); he recalls, however, the role played by the Qedeshotb, and admits that “the Holy here means the prostitute.” Chabas (Voyage d'un Egyptien,

Gesellschaft, 1877, vol. xxxi. p. 729, and Geschichte des Alterthums, vol. i. pp. 241, 242) adopt E. de Rouge’s theory in its entirety; BIax Bliiller rejects the geographical connection, and deals only with the wanton temperament of the goddess (Asien und Europa, p. 315). ^ Cf. the pictures of Aniti and of Asiti; a fragment of a popular tale preserved in the British Bluseum, and mentioned by Birch ( Faria, in the Zeitschrift, 1871, pp. 119, 120), seems to show us Astarte in her character of war-goddess, and the sword of Astarte is mentioned by Chabas (Le Papyrus Magique
Harris, pp. 55,125, 127). A bas-relief at Edfu (Naville, Le Mythe d’Eorus, pi. xiii.) represents her standing upright in her chariot, drawn by horses, and trampling her enemies underfoot : she is there identified with Sokhit the warlike, destroyer of men; cf. BIaspero, Hawn of Civilization, pp. 165, 166.

> This conception of the Syrian goddesses had already become firmly established at the period with which we are dealing, for an Egyptian magical formula defines Aniti and Astarte as “ the great goddesses who conceiving do not bring forth young, for the Horuses have sealed them and Sit hath established them ” (Chabas, Le Papyrus Magique Harris, pp. 55-58). ^ For details in regard to the mountains, streams, and forests held sacred by the Syrian populations, see Baudissin, Studien zur Semitisclien EeligionsgescMohte, vol. ii. pp. 145-269. The Baal of Lebanon is mentioned in an archaic Phoenician inscription (Corpus Ins. Semit, vol. i. pp. 22-26), and the name “ Holy Cape ” (Rosh-Qodshu), borne in the time of Thhtmosis HI. either by Haifa or by a neighbouring town, proves that Carmel was held sacred as far back as the Egyptian epoch (cf. supra, p. 135, note 5). Baal-Hermon has already been mentioned on p. 154 ; the evidence in reference to the worship of ElKasiu (Zeus Kd Ties) has been collected by M. db Vogue (Syrie Centrale, Inscriptions, pp. 103-105). ® The source of the Jordan, near Banias, was the seat of a Baal whom the Greeks identified with Pan. This was probably the Baal-Gad who often lent his name to the neighbouring town of BaalHermon (cf. supra, p. 155) : many of the rivers of Phoenicia were called after the divinities worshipped in the nearest city, e.g. the Adonis, the Belos, the Asclepios, the Damuras (Baudissin, Studien zur Semitischen BeligionsgescMchte, vol. ii. pp. 159-165). * These are the “ high places ” (bamdtli) so frequently referred to by the Hebrew prophets, and which we find in the country of Moab, according to the Mesha inscription (1. 3), and in the placename Bamoth-Baal (Numb. xxi. 19, xxii. 41 ; Josh. xiii. 17) ; many of them seem to have served for Canaanitish places of worship before they were resorted to by the children of Israel.

Southern Syria.^ Side by side with these plant-gods we find everywhere, in the
inmost recesses of the temples, at cross-roads, and in the open fields, blocks of
stone hewn into pillars, isolated boulders, or natural rocks, sometimes of meteoric
origin, which were recognised by certain mysterious marks to be the house of
the god, the Betyli or Beth-els in which he enclosed a part of his intelligence
and vital force.^
The worship of these gods involved the performance of ceremonies more
bloody and licentious even than those practised by other races. The Baalim
thirsted after blood, nor would they be satisfied with any common blood such
as generally contented their brethren in Chaldma or Egypt : they imperatively
demanded human as well as animal sacrifices. Among several of the Syrian
nations they had a prescriptive right to the firstborn male of each family;*’
this right was generally commuted, either by a money payment or by sub
jecting the infant to circumcision.'* At important junctures, however, this
pretence of bloodshed would fail to appease them, and the death of the child
alone availed.® Indeed, in times of national danger, the king and nobles
would furnish, not merely a single victim, but as many as the priests chose
to demand.® While they were being burnt alive on the knees of the statue,
or before the sacred emblem, their cries of pain were drowned by the piping
of flutes or the blare of trumpets, the parents standing near the altar, without
a sign of pity, and dressed as for a festival : the ruler of the world could
refuse nothing to prayers backed by so precious an offering, and by a
‘ As to the AfiliO'otli (or, sometimes in the masculine, Aslierini), who have been made out to have been regular divinities, analogous to the Astartes, or distinct from them (cf. especially Movers, Die Phunizier, vol. i. pp. 500-584), see Stade, GescMclite des Volkes Israels, vol. i. pp. 458-461, and Vernes, Du pr^endu Folytli^isme des Ildbreux, vol. i. pp. 94-98.
2 A stone hewn into a pillar, or stele, was called a masscbah by the Hebrews and Phoenicians (Corpus Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 63, 08, 76-80), less frequently nerth (Gen. xis. 26, A.V., “pillar of salt ; ” Corpus Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 154, 155, 194). As to the Betyli and their history, cf the very exhaustive article by Fr. Lenormant, Lcs B^tyles, in the Revue de V Histoire des Religions, vol. iii. pp. 31-53, and Pn. Berger, Note sur les pierres sacre'es, extracted from the Journal Asiatique, 1877. 3 This fact is proved, in so far as the Hebrew people is concerned, by the texts of the Pentateuch {Exod. xxii. 29, xxxiv. 19, 20) and of the prophets (Micali vi. 7 ; Ezel. xx. 26); amongst the Moabites also it was his eldest son whom King Mesha took to offer to his god (2 Kings iii. 27). We tind the same custom among other Syrian races : Philo of Byblos (Fragm. S, § 24, in MullerDidot, Fragm. Hist. Grsee., vol. iii. p. 569) tells us, in fact, that El-Kronos, god of Byblos, sacrificed his firstborn son and set the example of this kind of offering. Cf for the antiquity of this practice, Ed. IMeyer, Gescldclde des Alterthums, vol. i. pp. 249, 250, who does not hesitate to conclude that it was in full force from the time of the Egyptian supremacy onwards. ' lledemption by a payment in money was the case among the Hebrews (Numb, xviii. 15, 16), as also the substitution of an animal in the place of a child (Gen. xxii. 1-13); as to redemption by circumcision, cf the story of Moses and Zipporah, where the mother saves her son from Jahveh by circumcising him (Exod. iv. 24-26). Circumcision was practised among the Syrians of Palestine in the time of Herodotus (II. civ. : cf. Wiedemann, Ilerodots zweites Buck, pp. 410-413 ; Ed. Meyer, Gescliichte des Alterthums, vol. i. p. 250 ; and Th. Keinach, De Quelques faits relatifs a Vhistoire de la circoncision, in L’ Anthropologie, 1893, pp. 28-31). = As to sacrifices of children among peoples of Syrian origin, cf the texts collected by Movers, Die Fhuiiizier, vol. i. pp. 299-311. ® Plutarch, De Superstifione, § 13 : if we may credit Tertullian (Apolog., 9), the custom of offering up children as sacrifices lasted down to the proconsulate of Tiberius.

purpose so determiued
to move him. Such sacrifices were,
however, the exception, and the
shedding of their own blood, by his priests sufficed, as a rule, for the daily
wants of the god. Seizing their knives, they would slash their arms and
breasts with the view of compelling, by this ofi’ering of their own persons,
the good will of the Baalim.^ The Astartes of all degrees and kinds were
hardly less cruel ; they imposed frequent flagellations, self-mutilation, and
sometimes even emasculation, on their devotees.^ Around the majority of
these goddesses was gathered an infamous troop of profligates (kedeshim),
“dogs of love” (Jcelahim), and courtesans (hedeshfd),* The temples bore
little resemblance to those of the regions of the Lower Euphrates : nowhere
do we find traces of those ziggurdt which serve to produce the peculiar
jagged outline characteristic of Chaldsean cities.® The Syrian edifices were
stone buildings, which included, in addition to the halls and courts reserved
for religious rites, dwelling-rooms for the priesthood, and. storehouses for
provisions : though not to be compared in size with the sanctuaries of Thebes,

“ Cf., for the Hebraic epoch, the scene where the priests of Baal, in a trial of power with Elijali before Ahab, offered up sacrifices on the highest point of Carmel, and finding that their offerings did not meet with the usual success, “ cut themselves . . . with knives and lancets till the blood gushed out upon them ” (1 Kings xviii. 28). ’ See, on this point, the passages collected by Movers, Die Phonizier, vol. i. pp. 681-688. The legend of Combabos at Hierapolis (Lucian, De Ded Syria, §§ 19-27) is supposed to explain the origin of emasculation in honour of the goddess. * As to the hedesMm and hedeshot, cf. Movers, Die Phonizier, vol. i. pp. 677-681, where most of the facts concerning them have been collected.

they yet answered the purpose of strongholds in time of need, and were
capable of resisting the attacks of a victorious foed A numerous staff, con
sisting of priests, male and female singers, porters, butchers, slaves, and
artisans, was assigned to each of these temples: here the god was accus
tomed to give forth his oracles, either by the voice of his prophets, or by the
movement of his statues.^ The greater number of the festivals celebrated in
them were closely connected with the pastoral and agricultural life of the
country ; they inaugurated, or brought to a close, the principal operations of
the year—the sowing of seed, the harvest, the vintage, the shearing of the
sheep. At Shechem, when the grapes were ripe, the people flocked out of
the town into the vineyards, returning to the temple for religious observances
and sacred banquets when the fruit had been trodden in the winepress.® In
times of extraordinary distress, such as a prolonged drought or a famine, the
priests were wont to ascend in solemn procession to the high places in order
to implore the pity of their divine masters, from whom they strove to extort
help, or to obtain the wished-for rain, by their dances, their lamentations^ and
the shedding of their blood.^ Almost everywhere, but especially in the regions
east of the Jordan, were monuments which popular piety surrounded with a
superstitious reverence. Such were the isolated boulders, or, as we should call
them, “ menhirs,” reared on the summit of a knoll, or on the edge of a table
land ; dolmens, formed of a flat slab placed on the top of two roughly hewn
supports, cromlechs, or, that is to say, stone circles, in the centre of which
might be found a beth-el. We know not by whom were set up these monuments
there, nor at what time : the fact that they are in no way difierent from those
which are to be met with in Western Europe and the north of Africa has given
rise to the theory that they were the work of some one primeval race which
wandered ceaselessly over the ancient world, A few of them may have marked
the tombs of some forgotten personages, the discovery of human bones beneath
them confirming such a conjecture ; while others seem to have been holy
* The slory of Abimelech gives us some idea of what the Canaanite temple of Baal-Berith at Shechem was like {Judges ix. 27, 46-49). ^ As to the regular organisation of Baal-worship, we possess only documents of a comparatively late period, such as the fragments of accounts published in the Corp. Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 92-99, or the remnants of sacrificial tariffs discovered at Marseilles and in Africa. In the Hebraic era we have incidental mention of the prophets and priests of Baal, e.g. in 1 Kings xviii. 19, 22-29, 40. The priesthood of Baal, Astarte, and Qaddishat, as organised in Egypt under the Theban dynasties, is familiar to us from the stelm so frequently quoted (cf. supra, pp. 155, 161), and from other small monuments ; the titles are, naturally, those assumed by the Egyptian priests, the inscriptions being written in hieroglyphics. “ Judges ix. 26, 27. It is probable that the vintage festival, celebrated at Shiloh in the time of the Judges {Judges xxi. 19-23), dated back to a period of Canaanite history prior to the Hebrew invasion, i.e. to the time of the Egyptian supremacy. * Cf., in the Hebraic period, the scene where the priests of Baal go up to the top of Mount Carmel with the prophet Elijah (1 Kings xviii. 20-40).

places and altars from tlie beginning.^ The nations of Syria did not in all
cases recognise the original purpose of these monuments, but regarded them as
marking the seat of an ancient divinity, or the precise spot on which he had
at some time manifested himself. When the children of Israel caught sight
of them again on their return from Egypt, they at once recognised in them
the work of their patriarchs. The dolmen at Shechem was the altar which
Abraham had built to the Eternal after his arrival in the country of Canaan.^
Isaac had raised that at Beersheba, on the very spot where Jehovah had
appeared in order to renew with him the covenant that He had made with
Abraham.^ One might almost reconstruct a map of the wanderings of Jacob
from the altars which he built at each of his principal resting-places—at
Gilead [Galeed], at Ephrata, at Bethel, and at Shechem.® Each of such
* Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph. = The Syrian dolmens were first mentioned by Ieby-Mangles, Travels in Egypt and Nubia, etc., during the Years 1817-18, pp. 99, 143, probably those at Ala-Safat and at Manfumieii; others were afterwards discovered by F. de Saulcy, in the land of Ammon, at Sileimeh (Fojfage en Terre- Sainie, vol. i. pp. 312-315), and at Shalabfin, not far north of Nazareth (ibid., vol. ii. pp. 275, 276) ; both one and the other have been carefully examined by Lortet in the work of the Duo de Ldynes, Voyage d’exploration autour de la mer Morte, vol. i. pp. 134-137, and vol. iii. pp. 233-240. Since then, quite a large number of these remains have been reported, especially near the Jaulan and the Hauran, where there are whole fields of them (Schumachee, Across the Jordan, p. 62, et seq., and The Jaulan, p. 123, et seq.). In the Hebrew books, menhirs are classed with sacred stelss, under the name of maggehdh, and dolmens with altars (mizheahh) ; cromlechs are called gilgal, or circles of stone (Josh. iv. 20). ’ Gen. xii. 6, 7 ; there is an altar-menhir by Jacob in the same locality (Gen. xxxiii. 20), probably identical with that which another tradition attributes to Abraham.

still existing objects pi’obably bad a history of its own, connecting it insepar
ably with some far-off event in the local annals. Most of them were objects
of worship : they were anointed with oil, and victims were slaughtered in
their honour; the faithful even came at times to spend the night and sleep
near them, in order to obtain in their dreams glimpses of the future.^
Men and beasts were supposed to be animated, during their lifetime, by a
breath or soul which ran in their veins along with their blood, and served to move
their limbs; the man, therefore, who drank blood or ate bleeding flesh assimi
lated thereby the soul which inhered in it.^ After death the fate of this soul was
similar to that ascribed to the spirits of the departed in Egypt and Chaldfea.
The inhabitants of the ancient world were always accustomed to regard the
surviving element in man as something restless and unhappy—a weak and
pitiable double, doomed to hopeless destruction if deprived of the succour
of the living. They imagined it as taking up its abode near the body wrapped
in a half-conscious lethargy ; or else as dwelling with the other rephaim
(departed spirits) in some dismal and gloomy kingdom, hidden in the bowels
of the earth, like the region ruled by the Chaldman Allat, its doors gaping
wide to engulf new arrivals, but allowing none to escape who had once passed
the threshold.^ There it wasted away, a prey to sullen melancholy, under the
sway of inexorable deities, chief amongst whom, according to the Phoenician
idea, was Mout (Death), ^ the grandson of El ; there the slave became the
equal of his former master, the rich man no longer possessed anything which
could raise him above the poor, and dreaded monarchs were greeted on their
entrance by the jeers of kings who had gone down into the night before them.^
Tlie corpse, after it had been anointed with perfumes and enveloped in linen,
tlie way to Ephrata was the tomb of Rachel (Gen. xxxv. 20); the altar and stele at Bethel marked the spot where God appeared unto Jacob (Gea. xxviii. 10-22, xxxv. 1-15); for the altar at Sheciiem, •see Gen. xxxiii. 20. ‘ For the anointing with oil, cf. Gen. xxviii. 18, xxxi. 13, xxxv. 14; and for sacrifices, Gen. xxxi. 54. The menhir at Bethel was the identical one whereon Jacob rested his head on the night in which Jehovah appeared to him in a dream (Gen. xxviii. 18). In Phcenicia there was a legend which told how Usoos set up two stelm to the elements of wind and fire, and how he offered the blood of the animals he had killed in the chase as a libation (Philo op Byblos, Fraijm. 2, § 8, in Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxc., vol. iii. p. 566) ; cf. infra, p. 184, for what is said on this subject. This is the nepliesli of the Bible. As to the Hebrew view of the blood and the soul, cf. Dent. xli. 23 ; 1 Sam. xiv. 32-34. The Phoenician doctrines in regard to the soul and its condition liave heen very clearly summarised by Perrot-Chipiez, Histoire de I’Art dans VAntiquifg', vol. iii. ])p. 137-144, and by Pietschmank, Geschichte der Phonizier, pp. 191-196. ’ The expression rephaim (Corp. Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 13, 14, 19, 20, I. 8) means “the feeble” (cf. Jsa. xiv. 10); it was the epithet applied by the Hebrews to a part of the primitive races of Palestine (cf. supra, p. 48). A description of this kingdom of the departed, as conceived by the Hebrews as late as the VP'‘ century, occurs in Isa. xiv. 9-20, and in Ezelc. xxxii. 17-32 ; cf. the description of the Chaldsean hell in Maspero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 689, et seq. * Philo of Byblos, Fragm. 2, § 24, in Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grsec., vol. iii. p. 568 : among the Hebrews his name was Maweth, who feeds the departed like sheep, and himself feeds on them in liell (Ps. xlix. 14). Some writers have sought to identify this or some analogous god with the lion represented on a stele of Pirmus (Corp. Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 139-141, pi. xxiii.) which threatens to devour the body of a dead man (Pietschmann, Geschichte der Phonizier, pp. 193, 194). ® .Toh iii. 11-19; Isa. xiv. 9-20; Ezek. xxxii. 17-32.

The Jews sometimes embalmed the bodies of the dead, at any rate in the case of their kings (2 Chron. xvi. 14). As to burial in caverns, see Gen. xxiii. 3-20, xxv. 9, 10, 1. 13 ; the caves were merely artificial, or partly artificial grottoes (Eenan, J/issiom de Phdnicie, p. 832). “ The pillar or stele was used among both Hebrews (Gen. xxxv. 19, 20) and Phoenicians (Eenan, Mission de Phgnicie, pp. 79, 80) to mark the graves of distinguished persons. Among the Semites speaking Aramaic it was called nephesh (Corp. Ins. Semit., p. ii. vol. i. pp. 117, 118, etc.), especially when it took the form of a pyramid (Corp. Ins. Semit., p. ii. vol. i. p. 195, and Ecbens Duval, Note sur le monument fundraire appeld nephesh, in the Revue Se'mitique, vol. ii. pp. 259-263); the word means “ breath,” “ soul,” and clearly shows the ideas associated with the object.

these “ eternal ” ^ houses have disappeared in the course of the various wars by
which Syria suffered so heavily : in almost all cases, therefore, we are ignorant
as to the sites of the various cities of the dead in which the nobles and
common people of the Canaanite and Amorite towns were laid to rest.^ In
Phoenicia alone do we meet with burial-places which, after the vicissitudes
and upheavals of thirty centuries, still retain something of their original
arrangement.® Sometimes the site chosen was on level ground : perpendicular
shafts or stairways cut in the soil led down to low-roofed chambers, the
number of which varied according to circumstances : they were often arranged
in two stories, placed one above the other, fresh vaults being probably added
as the old ones were filled up. They were usually rectangular in shape, with
horizontal or slightly arched ceilings; niches cut in the walls received the
dead body and the objects intended for its use in the next world, and were
then closed with a slab of stone.* Elsewhere some isolated hill or narrow
gorge, with sides of fine homogeneous limestone, was selected.® In this case
the doors were placed in rows on a sort of fagade similar to that of the
Egyptian rock-tomb, generally without any attempt at external ornament.
The vaults were on the ground-level, but were not used as chapels for the
celebration of festivals in honour of the dead : they were walled up after every
funeral, and all access to them forbidden, until such time as they were again
required for the purposes of burial. Except on these occasions of sad necessity,
those whom “ the mouth of the pit had devoured ” dreaded the visits of the
living, and resorted to every means afforded by their religion to protect
themselves from them. Their inscriptions declare repeatedly that neither
gold nor silver, nor any object which could excite the greed of robbers,
was to be found within their graves ; they threaten any one who should dare
to deprive them of such articles of little value as belonged to them, or to turn
them out of their chambers in order to make room for others, with all sorts
of vengeance, divine and human.® These imprecations have not, however,

Gautier in 1893-94, on the little island of Bahr-el-Kadis, at one time believed to have been the site of the town of Qodshu, have revealed the existence of a number of tombs in the enclosure which forms the central part of the tumulus : some of these may possibly date from the Amorite epoch, but they are very poor in remains, and contain no object which permits us to fix the date with accuracy. ^ A summary of the researches undertaken by Eenan, and described in detail in the Mission de PMiiicie, will be found in Perrot-Chipiez, Histoire de I’ Art, vol. iii. pp. 144-173. * E.g. the Arabian tombs described by Eenan, Mission de Phe'nicie, pp.''.75-79. ^ Such was the necropolis at Adlun, the last rearrangement of which took place during the Grseco-Eoman period (Reiman, [Mission, etc., pp. 657, 660, et seq.), but whicli externally bears so strong a resemblance to an Egyptian necropolis of the XVIIP'“ or XIX^'' dynasty, that we may, without violating the probabilities, trace its origin back to the time of the Pharaonic conquest. ® Cf. the curses with which Eshmunazar threatens any one who should venture to decorate his

of tenants between the date of their first making and the close of the Eoman
supremacy. When the modern explorer chances to discover a vault which
has escaped the spade of the treasure-seeker, it is hardly ever the case that the
bodies whose remains are unearthed prove to be those of the original proprietors.
The gods and legends of Chaldaea had penetrated to the countries of
Amauru and Canaan, together with the language of the conquerors and their
system of writing: the stories of Adapa’s struggles against the south-west
wind, or of the incidents which forced Irishkigal, queen of the dead, to wed
Nergal, were accustomed to be read at the courts of Syrian princes.^ Chaldsean
theology, therefore, must have exercised influence on individual Syrians and on
their belief; but although we are forced to allow the existence of such influence,
we cannot define precisely the effects produced by it. Only on the coast and
in the Phoenician cities do the local religions seem to have become formulated
at a fairly early date, and crystallised under pressure of this influence into
cosmogonic theories. The Baalim and Astartes reigned there as on the banks
of the Jordan or Orontes, and in each town Baal was “ the most high,” master
of heaven and eternity, creator of everything which exists, though the character
of his creating acts was variously defined according to time and place. Some
regarded him as the personification of Justice, Sydyk, who established the
universe with the help of eight indefatigable Cabiri.^ Others held the
whole world to be the work of a divine family, whose successive generations
gave birth to the various elements. The storm-wind, Colpias, wedded to Chaos,
had begotten two mortals, tllom (Time) and Kadmon (the First-Born), and
these in their turn engendered Qen and Qenath, who dwelt in Phoenicia :
then came a drought, and they lifted up their heads to the Sun, imploring
him, as Lord of the Heavens (Baalsamin), to put an end to their woes.^ At
tomb (Corp. Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 9-20), and the last lines of the stele at Byblos (Corp. Ins. Semit., vol. i. pp. 1-8). ' These fragments were discovered at Tel el-Amarna, among the diplomatic correspondence between the Syrian princes and Amenothes III. and IV. (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets, pp. Ixxxv., Ixxxvi.). The legend of Adapa will be found in Maspeeo, Baton of Civilization, pp. 659661 ; as to the significance attached to it in Syria, cf. Satce, Patriarchal Palestine, pp. 265, 266. * This is the account of the cosmogony preserved for us by Photius from a fragment cf Damascius (Sanchoniathonis Berytii qux feruntur fragmenta, ed. Ohelli, p. 32) ; its general tenor recalls the teaching of the Hermopolitan Ennead (cf. Maspero, Bawn of Civilization, p. 145, et seq.), a fact which may be due to Egyptian influence. 3 Philo of Byblos, Fragm. 2, § 5, in Mullee-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grse.c., vol. iii. pp. 565, 566. Colpias is most probably a transliteration of the composite name Kol-piakha, “ the Voice of the Breath ” (Roth, Geschichte unserer Abendldndischen Philosophic, vol. i. p. 251 ; Schroder, Bie PhSnizische Sprache, p. 86) : as with the Hebrews, Chaos is Bohu. Renan {M^moire sur I’origine et sur le caractere veritable de VHistoire Ph^nicienne que porte le nom de Sanchoniathon, pp. 257-260) has shown that the words Alu>v and UpcDTSyoros in the Greek text correspond to the expressions Oldm, in Phoenician Ulom (Schroder, Bie PhSnizische Sprache, pp. 125-132), and Kadmon. Baalsamin is an Aramaic form of Baal-samim or Bal-samem (Schroder, Bie PhSnizische Sprache, p. 131, note 2, p. 175).



1G8 SYRIA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST.
Tyre it was thought that Chaos existed at the beginning, but chaos of a dark
and troubled nature, over which a Breath (rttaJch) floated without affecting it
“ and this Chaos had no ending, and it was thus for centuries and centuries.
Then the Breath became enamoured of its own principles, and brought about
a change in itself, and this change was called Desire :—now Desire was the
principle which created all things, and the Breath knew not its own creation.
The Breath and Chaos, therefore, became united, and Mot the Clay was born,
and from this clay sprang all the seed of creation, and Mot was the father of
all things ; now Mot was like an egg in shape. —And the Sun, the Moon, the
stars, the great planets, shone forth. There were living beings devoid of
intelligence, and from these living beings came intelligent beings, who were
called Zophesamm, or ‘ watchers of the heavens.’ ^ Now the thunder-claps in
the war of separating elements awoke these intelligent beings as it were
from a sleep, and then the males and the females began to stir themselves
and to seek one another on the land and in the sea.” ^ A scholar of the Eoman
epoch, Philo of Byblos, using as a basis some old documents hidden away in
the sanctuaries, which had apparently been classifled by Sanchoniathon, a
priest long before his time, has handed these theories of the cosmogony
down to us : after he has explained how the world was brought out of Chaos,
he gives a brief summary of the dawn of civilization in Phoenicia and the
legendary period in its history.^ No doubt he interprets the writings from
which he compiled his work in accordance with the spirit of his time : he has
none the less preserved their substance more or less faithfully. Beneath the
veneer of abstraction with which the Greek tongue and mind have overlaid the
fragment just quoted, we discern that groundwork of barbaric ideas which is to be
met with in most Oriental theologies, whether Egyptian or Babylonian. At first
‘ Mot, the clay formed by the corruidiou of earth and water, vSarwSovs /ui^ews arjipiv, is probably a Fhcenician form of a word which means water in the Semitic languages (Eoth, Geschichie unserer ubendidndischen PMlosophie, vol. i. p. 251 ; Scukodek, Die PhSuizisclie Sprache, p. 133). Cf. the Egyptian theory, according to which the clay, heated by the sun, was supposed to have given birth to animated beings (Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 155-157) ; this same clay modelled by Khnhmu into the form of an egg was supposed to have produced the heavens and the earth (Maspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, p. 128). As to an emendation of the text which proposes to alter Mof, clay, into Tomot or Tamat, sea, cf. Halevy, Melanges de Critique et d'Histoire, pp. 387, 388. ^ Like the name Baalsamin, Zophesamin has been handed down to us by Philo of Byblos in its Aramaic form (Scheodee, Die Phonizische Sprache, pp. 131, 175, note 2, 209). “ Philo of Byblos, Fragm. 2, § 1, in Mlllee-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxe., vol. iii. p. 565. I have quoted this passage from the proposed restoration of the original text suggested by Eenan {M^moire sur I’origine et sur le curactere veritable de VHistoire Ph^nicienne, etc., pp. 275, 276). * Philo of Byblos’ work no longer exists, but the fragments of it will be found collected by MiiLLEE-DiDOT, Fragm. Hist. Grxe., vol. iii. pp. 560-573, and by Bunsen, Philonis Byblii Fragmenta, etc., in Egypt’s Place in Universal History, vol. v. pp. 789-854.

Baudissin, Studien zur Semitischen Religiomgeschichte, vol. i. pp. 1-46 Fb. Lenoemant, Les Origines de VHistoire, vol. i. pp. 532-552. All these works ought properly to be revised in the light of the new elements contributed by Assyriologists.

BAAL OF ARVAD.^
we have a black mysterious Chaos, stagnatiug in eternal waters, the primordial
Nu or Apsu ; then the slime which precipitates in this chaos and clots into the
form of an egg, like the mud of the Nile under the hand of Khnumu; then the
hatching forth of living organisms and indolent generations of barely conscious
creatures, such as the Lakhmh, the Anshar, and the Illinu of Chaldasan specula
tion ; finally the abrupt appearance of intelligent beingsd The Phoenicians, how
ever, accustomed as they were to the Mediterranean,
with its blind outbursts of fury, had formed an idea of
Chaos which differed widely from that of most of the
inland races, to whom it presented itself as something
silent and motionless : they imagined it as swept by
a mighty wind, which, gradually increasing to a roaring
tempest, at length succeeded in stirring the chaos to
its very depths, and in fertilising its elements amidst
the fury of the storm. No sooner had the earth been
thus brought roughly into shape, than the whole family of the north winds
swooped down upon it and reduced it to civilized order.^ It was but natural
that the traditions of a seafaring race should trace its descent from the winds.
In Phoenicia the sea is everything: of land there is but just enough to
furnish a site for a score of towns, with their surrounding belt of gardens.^
Mount Lebanon, with its impenetrable forests,® isolated it almost entirely from
Coele-Syria, and acted as the eastward boundary of the long narrow quadrangle
hemmed in between the mountains and the rocky shore of the sea. At
frequent intervals, spurs run out at right angles from the principal chain,
forming steep headlands on the sea-front: these cut up the country, small
to begin with, into five or six still smaller provinces, each one of which
possessed from time immemorial its own independent cities, its own religion,
and its own national history. To the north were the Zahi, a race half sailors,
half husbandmen, rich, brave, and turbulent, ever ready to give battle to
their neighbours, or rebel against an alien master, be he who he might.®

a stone wall, built on the outermost ledges
of the rocks, which were levelled to form
its foundation. The courses of the masonry
were irregular, laid without cement or mortar
of any kind. This bold piece of engineering
served the double purpose of sea-wall and
rampart, and was thus fitted to withstand
alike the onset of hostile fleets and the
surges of the Mediterranean.® There was
no potable water on the island, and for
drinking purposes the inhabitants were
obliged to rely on the fall of rain, which they stored in cisterns—still in use
among their descendants.^ In the event of prolonged drought they were obliged
to send to the mainland opposite ; in time of war they had recourse to a sub
marine spring, which bubbles up in mid-channel. Their divers let down a leaden
bell, to the top of which was fitted a leathern pipe, and applied it to the orifice
of the spring ; the fresh water coming up through the sand was collected in this
bell, and rising in the pipe, reached the surface uncontaminated by salt water.®
Inscription of the Obelisk of the Atmeiddn at Constantinople, p. 9, note 30), who, with Hincks, at first saw in the name a reference to the peoples of Ararat {Observations on the Statistical Tablet of Karnak, pp. 14, 15); Birch’s identification, adopted by Brugsch {Geogr. Ins., vol, ii. p. 35), is now accepted by all Egyptologists. The name is written Aruada or Arada in the Tel el-Amarna tablets (BezoldBudge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, p. lix., n. 1 ; cf. Bezoli), Oriental Diplomacy, p. xii., § 4, as to the reading of one of the signs which enter into the composition of the name). * The ancient Arvad of the Graeco-Eoman period has been described by Strabo, XVI. ii., § 13, p. 754 ; for details in regard to the modern Arvad, see Eenan, Mission de Ph^nicie, pip. 19-42. “ The Arvad Astarte had been identified by the Egyptians with their goddess Bastit (Eenan, Mission de PhCnkie, pp. 56, 57 ; cf. Brugsch, Die fremde Aphrodite in Memphis, in the Zeitsohrift, 1863, p. 9). The sea-Baal, who has been connected by some with Dagon of Askalon, is represented on the earliest Arvadian coins : cf. one of them on the preceding page. He has a fisli-like tail, the body and bearded head of a man, with an Assyrian head-dress ; on his breast we sometimes find a circular opening which seems to show the entrails (Babelon, Les Perses Ach^m^nides, les Satrapes et les Dynastes tributaires de leur Empire, Cypre et Ph^nieie, pp. cliv.-clvi., and pi. xxii., Nos. 1-6). ® The antiquity of the wall of Arvad, recognised by travellers of the last century, is now universally admitted by all archpeologists (Eenan, Mission de Ph^nicie, pp. 39, 40 ; Perrot-Ouipiez, Histoire de I’Art dans VAntiquity, vol. iii. p. 106). * Strabo, XVI. ii.,§ 13, p. 754; cf. what is said as to these cisterns in Eenan, Mission, etc., pp). 10-41. * Strabo, XVI. ii., § 13, p. 754.

The harbour opened to the east, facing the mainland : it was divided into two
basins by a stone jetty, and was doubtless insuflScient for the sea-traffic, but
this was the less felt inasmuch as there was a safe anchorage outside it—the
best, perhaps, to be found in
these waters.^ Opposite to
Arvad, on an almost continu

fortified it.® The cities of the dead lay close together in the background,
on the slope of the nearest chain of hills still further back lay a plain
celebrated for its fertility and the luxuriance of its verdure : Lebanon, with its
wooded peaks, was shut in on the north and south, but on the east the mountain
sloped downwards almost to the sea-level, furnishing a pass through which ran
the road which joined the great military highway not far from Qodshu.® The

Antarados, which prior to the Grseco-Roman era was a place of no importance (Ptolemy, V. xv. 16), occupies the site of Tortosa (Kenan, Mission de Phenicie, pp. 20, 21, 47, et seq.). Enhydra (Strabo, L. XVI. ii.,§ 12, p. 753) is not known, and Karne has been replaced by Karnun to the north of Tortosa (Renan, Mission de Phenicie, pp. 21, 22). None of the “ neighbours of Arados” (ot ’ApdSa) irpSaoiKoi, Arrian, Anab., II. xiii. 17) are mentioned by name in the Assyrian texts ; but W. Max Muller has with great ingenuity demonstrated that the Egyptian form Aratiit or Aratiut corresponds with a Semitic plural Arvadot, and consequently refers not only to Arad itself, but also to the fortified cities and towns which formed its continental suburbs (Asien und Europa, pp. 186, 187). * Renan, Mission de Phenicie, pp. 75-80. ® In regard to this pass, see what is said on pp. 138-141, supra.

Orontes, and is believed to have gradually extended as far as Hamath itself
in other words, over the whole of Zahid For the most part, however, its rule
was confined to the coast between Gabala and the Nahr el-Kebir; Simyra at
one time acknowledged its suzerainty, at another became a self-supporting
and independent state, strong enough to compel the respect of its neighbours.^
Beyond the Orontes, the coast curves abruptly inward towards the west, and
a group of wind-swept hills ending in a promontory called Phaniel,^ the
reputed scene of a divine manifestation, marked the extreme limit of Aradian
influence to the north, if, indeed, it ever reached so far. Half a dozen obscure
cities flourished here, Arka,^ Siani,® Mahallat, Kaiz, Maiza, and Botrys,® some
of them on the seaboard, others inland on the bend of some minor stream.
Botrys,'^ the last of the six, barred the roads which cross the Phaniel headland,
and commanded the entrance to the holy ground where Byblos and Berytus
celebrated each year the amorous mysteries of Adonis.

most ancient city in the world.® The god El had founded it at the dawning

Eenan questions whether Phaniel ought not to be taken in the same sense as the Pne-Baal of the Carthaginian inscriptions, and applied to a goddess to whom the promontory had been dedicated ; he also suggests that the modern name Cap Madonne may be a kind of echo of the title Rahhath borne by this goddess from the earliest times {Mission de Ph€nicie, p. 145). ’ Arka is perhaps referred to in the tablets of Tel el-Amarna under the form Irkuta or Irkat (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, p. Ixxii.) ; it also appears in the Bible {Gen. x. 17) and in the Assyrian texts (Fr. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Parodies ? p. 282). It is the Ccesarea of classical geographers, which has now resumed its old Phoenician name of Tell- Arka (Renan, Mission de la Ph^nicie, pp. 115, 116). ^ Sianu or Siani is mentioned in the Assyrian texts (Pr. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies‘1 p. 282) and in the Bible {Gen. x. 17) ; Strabo knew it under the name of Sinna (XVI. ii., § 18, p. 755), and a village near Arka was called Sin or Syn as late as the XV*'' century (B. von Breydenbach, Reise des Heiligen Landes, vol. i. p. 115). “ According to the Assyrian inscriptions, these were the names of the three towns which formed the '1 ripolis of Grseco-Eoman times (Fr. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Parodies ? pp. 282, 283). ' Botrys is the hellenized form of the name Bozruna or Bozrun, which appears on the tablets of Tel el-Amarna (Bezold-Budge, Tablets of Tell el-Amarna, p. Ixxiii.) ; the modern name, Butrun or Batrun, preserves the final letter which the Greeks had dropped. * Gublu or Gubli is the pronunciation indicated for this name in the Tel el-Amarna tablets (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, p. 148) ; the Egyptians transcribed it Eupuna or Kupna by substituting n for I, as Chabas was the first to point out {Voyage d’un Egyptien, pp. 157-161). The Greek name Byblos was obtained from Gublu by substituting a b for the g, as in 0\€(papoi/ from yk€<papov, eyelid (Eenan, Mission de Phenicie, p. 153). “ Philo of Byblos, Fragm. 2, § 17, in Muller-Didot, Fragm.

sea.’ A small bay, now fllled up, made it an important shipping centre.
The temple stood on the top of the hill, a few fragments of its walls still
serving to mark the site ; it was, perhaps, identical with that of which we
find the plan engraved on certain imperial coins.® Two flights of steps led
up to it from the lower quarters of the town, one
of which gave access to a chapel in the Greek
style, surmounted by a triangular pediment, and
dating, at the earliest, from the time of the Se
leucides ; the other terminated in a long colon
nade, belonging to the same period, added as a
new fagade to an earlier building, apparently in
order to bring it abreast of more modern require
ments. The sanctuary which stands hidden be

on the coins, in a very archaic style, and is by no
means wanting in originality or dignity. It con

lines drawn from the centres of the two doors seem to cross one another stands
a conical stone mounted on a cube of masonry, which is the beth-el animated by
the spirit of the god : an open-work balustrade surrounds and protects it from
the touch of the profane. The building was perhaps not earlier than the Assyrian
or Persian era, but in its general plan it evidently reproduced the arrangements
of some former edifice.® At an early time El was spoken of as the first king
of Gablu in the same manner as each one of his Egyptian fellow-gods had been
in their several nomes, and the story of his exploits formed the inevitable pre

make of the origin of Adonis, and of the legends which treat him as a hero—the
representation of him as the incestuous offspring of a certain King Kinyras and
his own daughter Myrrha is a comparatively recent element grafted on the
original myth ; at any rate, the happiness of the two lovers had lasted but a few
short weeks when a sudden end was put to it by the tusks of a monstrous wild
boar, Baalat-Gublu wept over her lover’s body and buried it ; then her grief
triumphed over death, and Adonis, ransomed by her tears, rose from the tomb,
his love no whit less passionate than it had been before the catastrophe.^
This is nothing else than the Chaldaean legend of Ishtar and Dumuzi
presented in a form more fully symbolical of the yearly marriage of Earth
and Heaven. Like the Lady of Byblos at her master’s approach. Earth is
thrilled by the first breath of spring, and abandons herself without shame
to the caresses of Heaven: she welcomes him to her arms, is fructified by
him, and pours forth the abundance of her flowers and fruits. Then comes
summer and kills the spring : Earth is burnt up and withers, she strips herself
of her ornaments, and her fruitfulness departs till the gloom and icy numbness
of winter have passed away. Each year the cycle of the seasons brings back
with it the same joy, the same despair, into the life of the world; each year
Baalat falls in love with her Adonis and loses him, only to bring him back
to life and lose him again in the coming year.
The whole neighbourhood of Byblos, and that part of Mount Lebanon in
which it lies, were steeped in memories of this legend from the very earliest
times.^ We know the precise spot where the goddess first caught sight of her
lover, where she unveiled herself before him, and where at the last she buried
his mutilated body, and chanted her lament for the dead. A river which
flows southward not far off was called the Adonis,® and the valley watered
by it was supposed to have been the scene of this tragic idyll. The Adonis
rises near Aphaka,^ at the base of a narrow amphitheatre, issuing from
the entrance of an irregular grotto, the natural shape of which had, at some
remote period, been altered by the hand of man ; in three cascades it bounds
et seq.) have discussed the question as to whether the proper name of Adonis was not lao or leuo. That of Tammuz, which he takes after his death, probably came to him through Chaldsean influence, when he was assimilated to Dumuzi (cf. Maspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, p. 693, et seq.). ' In Movers, Die Phonizier, pp. 191-253, 542-545, 585, et seq., will be found a collection of texts of the ancient writers who enable us to reconstitute the final forms of the Adonis legend. “ As to this aspect of Byblos and of the localities in its neighbourhood, cf. what Eenan says in Mission de Ph^nicie, pp. 219-222 ; they possessed the legend from the very earliest times, and the scribe of the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xx. 7, 8, speaking of them in the time of Eamses II., refers to Byblos as a mysterious city, whose tutelary goddess he prefers to name at another time, being no doubt actuated by the same motive of religious discretion which deterred Herodotus from uttering the name of Osiris (Chabas, Le Voyage d’un Egyptien, pp. 56-61 ; cf. W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 188-191). ’ Eenan, Mission de Phenicie, pp. 282-284. This is the Nahr- Ibrahim (cf. supra, p. 9).

into a sort of circular basin,
where it gathers to itself the
waters of the neighbouring springs, then it dashes onwards under the single arch
of a Roman bridge, and descends in a series of waterfalls to the level of the valley
below. The temple rises opposite the source of the stream on an artificial
mound, a meteorite fallen from heaven having attracted the attention of the
faithful to the spot. The mountain falls abruptly away, its summit presenting a
red and bare appearance, owing to the alternate action of summer sun and winter
frost. As the slopes approach the valley they become clothed with a garb of
wild vegetation, which bursts forth from every fissure, and finds a foothold on
every projecting rock : the base of the mountain is hidden in a tangled mass
of glowing green, which the moist yet sunny Spring calls forth in abundance
whenever the slopes are not too steep to retain a shallow layer of nourishing
mould. It would be hard to find, even among the most picturesque spots of
Europe, a landscape in which wildness and beauty are more happily combined,
or where the mildness of the air and sparkling coolness of the streams offer a
more perfect setting for the ceremonies attending the worship of Astarte.^ In

the basin of the river and of the torrents by which it is fed, there
appears a succession of charming and romantic scenes — gaping chasms
with precipitous ochre-coloured walls ; narrow fields laid out in terraces on
the slopes, or stretching in emerald strips along the ruddy river-banks
orchards thick with almond and walnut trees; sacred grottoes, into which
the priestesses, seated at the corner of the roads, endeavour to draw the
pilgrims as they proceed on their way to make their prayers to the goddess ;
^
sanctuaries and mausolea of Adonis at Yanukh, on the table-land of Mashnaka,
and on the heights of Ghineh.^ According to the common belief, the actual
tomb of Adonis was to be found at Byblos itself,® where the people were
accustomed to assemble twice a year to keep his festivals, which lasted for
several days together.^ At the summer solstice, the season when the wild
boar had ripped open the divine hunter, and the summer had already done
damage to the spring, the priests were accustomed to prepare a painted
wooden image of a corpse made ready for burial,® which they hid in what
were called the gardens of Adonis—terra-cotta pots filled with earth in which
wheat and barley, lettuce and fennel, were sown. These were set out at the
door of each house, or in the courts of the temple, where the sprouting plants
had to endure the scorching effect of the sun, and soon withered away.® For
several days troops of women and young girls, with their heads dishevelled or
shorn, their garments in rags, their faces torn with their nails, their breasts
and arms scarified with knives, went about over hill and dale in search of their
idol, giving utterance to cries of despair, and to endless appeals : “ Ah, Lord 1
Ah, Lord ! what is become of thy beauty.” Once having found the image, they
upon the site of a more ancient structure ; this was probably the edifice which the author of De Bed Sijrd considered to be tire temple of Venus, built by Kinyras witliin a day’s journey of Byblos in the Lebanon. * Kenan points out at Byblos the existence of one of these caverns which gave shelter to the hcileshoth {Mission de PMnicie, pp. 204, 653). Many of the caves met with in the valley of the NahrIbrahim have doubtless served for the same purpose, although their walls contain no marks of the cult. “ Kenan, Mission de Ph^nioie, pp. 284-295, 301, 302. ’ De Ded Syria, § 6, 7 : Melito placed it, however, near Aphaka (cf. 'Ret^A'S, 3Ielitonis Ep. Sardium Apoloy. ad 31. Aurel Imp. Fragm., in the Spicilegiuni Solesmense, vol. ii. p. 43), and, indeed, there must have been as many difl’ereut traditions on the subject as there were celebrated sanctuaries. * For the date and the ceremonies peculiar to this festival, see the testimonies of ancient authors put together by Movers, Die Phonizier, p. 205, et seq. The analogy which they exhibit with the festivals of Osiris in the month of Khoiak (Lortet, Les Fetes d' Osiris au mois de Khoialc, in the Becueil, vol. iii. pp. 43-57 ; vol. iv. pp. 21-33), and especially the rite of the Gardens, lead me to believe that they were practically the same at the time of the Egyptian conquest and that of the Caesars. ® Plutarch, Nictas, § 8; efScuAa veKpois iKKopLi^op.eeoLs opoia', cf. Abibiianus Marcellinus, xix. 1, § 10 : “ Iccluli . . . figmenta vehentes hominum mortuorum ita curate pollincta ut et imagines essent corporihus jam sepidtis,” where the context shows that the object in view was to imitate the ceremonial used at the burying of Adonis. •* Hesyohios, s.v. ’ASiiviSos Krpnoi.

Movers, Phonizier, pp. 244-253.

brought it to the feet of the goddess, washed it while displaying its wound,
anointed it with sweet-smelling unguents, wrapped it in a linen and woollen
shroud, placed it on a catafalque, and, after expressing around the bier their
feelings of desolation, according to the rites observed at funerals, placed it
solemnly in the tombd The close and dreary summer passes away. With
the first days of September the autumnal rains begin to fall upon the hills,
and washing away the ochreous earth lying upon the slopes, descend in muddy
torrents into the hollows of the valleys. The Adonis river begins to svvell
with the ruddy waters, which, on reaching the sea, do not readily blend with
it. The wind from the offing drives the river water back upon the coast, and
forces it to cling for a long time to the shore, where it forms a kind of crimson
fringe.^ This was the blood of the hero, and the sight of this precious stream
stirred up anew the devotion of the people, who donned once more their weeds
of mourning until the priests were able to announce to them that, by virtue
of their supplications, Adonis was brought back from the shades into new life.^
Shouts of joy immediately broke forth, and the people who had lately sym*
pathized with the mourning goddess in her tears and cries of sorrow, now
joined with her in expressions of mad and amorous delight. Wives and virgins

all the women who had refused during the week of mourning to make a
sacrifice of their hair— were obliged to atone for this fault by putting themselves
at the disposal of the strangers whom the festival had brought together, the
reward of their service becoming the property of the sacred treasury.*
Berytus shared with Byblos the glory of having had El for its founder.^
The road which connects these two cities makes a lengthy detour in its course
along the coast, having to cross numberless ravines and rocky summits : before
reaching Palai-Byblos, it passes over a headland by a series of steps cut into the
rock, forming a kind of “ ladder ” similar to that which is encountered lower
down, between Acre and the plains of Tyre.® The river Lykos runs like a kind
‘ Theocritus has described in his fifth Idyll (Tlie Syracusans, v. 78, et seq.) the laying out and burial of Adonis as it was practised at Alexandria in Egypt in the Iir‘* century before our era. ^ De Ded Syrd, § 8. The same phenomenon occurs in spring. Maundrell (Voyage, pp. 57, 58) saw it on March 17, and Eenan (Mission de Plienicie, p. 283) in the first days of February. ^ De Ded Syrd, § 6 ; cf.

The name Berytus was found by Hincks in the Egyptian texts (An Attempt to ascertain the Number, etc., of the Hieroglyphic Alphabet, p. 47) under the form Birutu, Beirutu ; it occurs frequently in the Tel el-Amarna tablets (Bbzold-Bodge, The Tell elAmarna Tablets in the British Museum, p. xlvi.). ° This is the KKipa^ of Strabo (XIV. ii., § 19, p. 755), which Eenan (Mission de Phdnicie, pp. 333, 334) places “ on the flank of the mountain which forms the northern side of the bay of Juni, and which takes the form of a staircase in a gorge of the rocks ; ” he is inclined to place Palai-Byblos at the modern village of Sarbah (Id., Hid., pp. 332, 333). The name Palai-Byblos contains probably a Phoenician word Which the Greeks wrongly identified with iraAtuds (Movers, Das Phonizische

of natural fosse along the base of this steep headland. It forms at the present
time a torrent, fed by the melting snows of Mount Sannin, and is entirely
unnavigable. It was better circumstanced formerly in this respect, and even in
the early years of the Eoman conquest, sailors from Arvad (Arados) were accus
tomed to sail up it as far as one of the passes of the lower Lebanon, leading into
Coele-Syria.^ Berytus was installed at the base of a great headland which stands
out boldly into the sea, and forms the most striking promontory to be met
with in these regions from Carmel to the vicinity of Arvad. The port is
nothing but an open creek with a petty roadstead, but it has the advantage
of a good supply of fresh water, which pours down from the numerous springs
to which it is indebted for its name.^ According to ancient legends, it
was given by El to one of his offspring called Poseidon^ by the Greeks.
Adonis desired to take possession of it, but was frustrated in the attempt,
and the maritime Baal secured the permanence of his rule by marrying one
of his sisters — the Baalat-Beyrut who is represented as a nymph on Grmco
Koman coins.^ The rule of the city extended as far as the banks of the
Tamur, and an old legend narrates that its patron fought in ancient times
with the deity of that river, hurling stones at him to prevent his becoming
master of the land to the north. The bar formed of shingle and the
dunes which contract the entrance were regarded as evidences of this con
flict.^ Beyond the southern bank of the river, Sidon sits enthroned as
“ the firstborn of Canaan.” In spite of this ambitious title it was at first
nothing but a poor fishing village founded by Bel, the Agenor of the Greeks,
on the southern slope of a spit of laud which juts out obliquely towards the
Alterthum, vol. i. p. lOti, note 101 ; Renan, Mission de Phdnicie, p. 577 ; Pietschmann, Geschkhie der I’hdnizier, p, 48). * Strabo, XVI. ii., § 0, p. 755. Renan (Mission, etc., p. 342 ; cf. Pietschmann, Ges. der I’honizier, p. 50) does not accept the testimony of Strabo, while other historians regard it as correct (Kenrick, Thaenicia, pp. 12, 13), and modern geologists have pointed out on the banks of this small river traces of the waters liaving once attained a higher level than at present. The Due de Luynes has shown
that the present name, Nahr el-Kelb, probably preserves the chief element—Kelb—of the ancient name which the Greeks rendered AvKhs, “wolf” (Voyage d'explor. autour de la mer Murte, vol. i. p. 9, n. 1) : cf. p. 9, note 5, of the jiresent work. 2 The name Beyrut lias been often derived from a Phenician word signifying cypress, and which may have been applied to the pine tree (Renan, Mission, etc., pp. 352, 353). The Phoenicians themselves derived it from Bir, “ wells ; ” cf. Stephen of Byzantium, s.v. Bypurds, iKAydy Sta to GjoSpoyPtip yap rh eppeap irap’ avroTs. 2 Philo Byblius, Fragm. 2, § 25, in Muller-Dipot, Fragm. Hist. Grxe., vol. iii. p. 569. * The poet Nonuus (Dionysiaca, 11. xli.-xliii.) has preserved a highly embellished account of this rivalry, where Adonis is called Dionysos ; for the coins of Berytus, on which the nymph appears, cf. Babelon, Les Perses Ach^mdnides, pi. xxv.. No. 23, and pp. 180, 18G.
The original name appears to have been Tamur, Tamyr, from a word signifying “palm” in the Phoenician language (Schroder, Die Phoiiizische Sprache, p. 135) ; it has been rendered in Greek sometimes by Aapovpas (Polybius, V. Ixviii. 9), sometimes by Tajuupas (Strabo, XVI. ii., § 22, p. 176). The myth of the conflict between Poseidon and the god of the river, a Baal-Demarous (Philo
Byblius, Fragm. 2, § 22, in Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxe., vol. iii. p. 658), has been explained by
Renan (Mission de Ph^nicie, p. 615), who accepts the identification of the river-deity with BaalThamar, already mentioned by Movers (Die PMnizier, pp. 661, 662).

south-west.^ It grew from year to year, spreading out over the plain, and
became at length one of the most prosperous of the chief cities of the country

a “ mother ” in Phoenicia.^ The port, once so celebrated, is shut in by three
chains of half-sunken reefs, which, running out from the northern end of the
peninsula, continue parallel to the coast for some hundreds of yards : narrow
passages in these reefs afford access to the harbour ; one small island, which
is always above water, occupies the centre of this natural dyke of rocks, and
furnishes a site for a maritime quarter opposite to the continental city.^ The
necropolis on the mainland extends to the east and north, and consists of an
irregular series of excavations made in alow line of limestone cliffs which must
have been lashed by the waves of the Mediterranean long prior to the beginning
of history. These tombs are crowded closely together, ramifying into an in
extricable maze, and are separated from each other by such thin walls that one
expects every moment to see them give way, and bury the visitors in the
ruin. Many date back to a very early period, while all of them have been
re-worked and re-appropriated over and over again. The latest occupiers
were contemporaries of the Macedonian kings or the Koman Ctesars. Space
was limited and costly in this region of the dead : the Sidonians made the
best use they could of the tombs, burying in them again and again, as
the Egyptians were accustomed to do in their cemeteries at Thebes and
Memphis.^ The surrounding plain is watered by the “ pleasant Bostrenos,” and
is covered with gardens which are reckoned to be the most beautiful in all
Syria — at least after those of Damascus : their praises were sung even in
ancient days, and they had then earned for the city the epithet of “the flowery
Sidon.” ® Here, also, an Astarte ruled over the destinies of the people, but a
chaste and immaculate Astarte, a self-restrained and warlike virgin, sometimes
identified with the moon, sometimes with the pale and frigid morning
' Sidon is called “ the firstborn of Canaan ” in Gen. x. 15 : the name means a fishing-place, as
the classical authors already knew—“nam piscem Phcenices sidon appellant” (Justin, xviii. 3,2; cf. Isidore op Seville, Origines, xv. 1, 28, where the passage from Justin is reproduced almost verbally). Its name was recognised in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xx. 1. 8, under the form Ziduna, by Hincks {An Attempt to ascertain the Number, etc., of the Hieroglyphic Alphabet, p. 45). It appears frequently in the Tel el-Amarna tablets (Bezold-Bddgb, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the
British Museum, p. xlvii.).
2 In the coins of classic times it is called “Sidon, the mother Om—oi Kambe, Hippo, Citium, and Tyre” (Babelon, Les Perses Ache'm^nides, pp. 236, 237). => Eenan, Mission de Ph^nicie, pp. 362, 363; Guerin, GaliUe, vol. ii. pp. 488-506. The only description of the port which we possess is that in the romance of Clitophon and Leucippus by Achilles Tatius ; Pietscbmann {Gesch. der Phonizier, pp. 54-58) has commented on it at length, and has endeavoured to reproduce on a modern map its different parts. * Excavations were made at these cemeteries some thirty years ago, and the results described by Eenan {Mission de Ph^nicie, p. 400, et seq.).

star.’^ In addition to this goddess, the inhabitants worshipped a Baal-Sidon, and
other divinities of milder character—an Astarte Shem-Baal, wife of the supreme
Baal, and Eshmun, a god of medicine—each of whom had his own particular
temple either in the town itself or in some neighbouring village in the mountain.^
Baal delighted in travel, and was accustomed to be drawn in a chariot through the
valleys of Phoenicia in order to receive the prayers and offerings of his devotees.®
The immodest Astarte, excluded, it would seem, from the official religion, had her
claims acknowledged in the cult offered to her by the people, but she became
the subject of no poetic or dolorous legend like her namesake at Byblos, and
there was no attempt to disguise her innately coarse character by throwing
over it a garb of sentiment. She possessed in the suburbs her chapels and
grottoes, hollowed out in the hillsides, where she was served by the usual
crowd of Eioliehm and sacred courtesans.^ Some half-dozen towns or fortified
villages, such as Bitziti,® the Lesser Sidon, and Sarepta, were scattered along
the shore, or on the lowest slopes of the Lebanon. Sidonian territory reached
its limit at the Cape of SarejDta, where the high-lands again meet the sea
at the boundary of one of those basins into which Phoenicia is divided. Passing
beyond this cape, w'e come first upon a Tyrian outpost, the Town of Birds ;
®
then upon the village of Nazana"* with its river of the same name; beyond
this upon a plain hemmed in by low hills, cultivated to their summits ; then
* Astarte is represented in the Bible as the goddess of the Sidonians (1 Kings xi. 5, 83 ; 2 Kings xxiii. 13), and she is in fact the object of the invocations addressed to the mistress Deity in the Sidonian inscriptions {Corpus Inscript. Semiticarum, vol. i. pp. 21, 22), the patroness of the town (Johannes Lydds, De Mensibus, iv. 44; Achilles Tatids, Leucippe et Clitophon, bk. i. § 1). Kings
and queens were her priests and priestesses respectively {Corp. Ins. Sem., vol. i. pp. 13, 20 ; E. Eenan, Le Sarcophage de Tabnit roi de Sidon, pp. 2, 3). For the character of this Sidonian goddess, see with the necessary reserves. Movers, Die I’honizier, pp. G01-G07. 2 These deities and their temples are mentioned in the inscriirtion of Eshmunazar, 11. 16-18, in the Corp. Ins. Sem., vol. i. pp. 13, 20.

Babelon, Les Perses Acli^m., pi. xxxii,. Nos. 10 and 15). •* Renan has described the grottoes consecrated to the popular Astarte near El-Zeitun and Magdushe, in the neighbourhood of Sidon {Mission de Pli^iiicie, pp. 517, 518). = Bitziti is not mentioned except in the Assyrian texts, and has been identified by Delitzsch {Wo lag das Parodies ? p. 284) with the modern region Ain ez-Zeitun to the south-east of Sidon (Renan, Mission de Phdiicie, pp. 516, 517). It is very probably the Elaia of Philo of Byblos {Fragm. 17, in Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxc., vol. iii. p. 575), the Elais of Dionysios Periegetes (Muller-Didot, Geog. Grmei Min., vol. ii. p. 60), which Renan {Mission, etc., pp. 525, 526) is inclined to identify with Heldua, Khan-Khaldi, by substituting Eldis as a correction (Maspero, De Quelques LocaliWs voisines de Sidon, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. pp. 101, 102). As for Little Sidon, known to-day as Khurbet-Sidon, see Maspero, op. cit., vol. xvii. pp. 101, 102. Sarepta was recognised in the Egyptian texts for the first time by Hincks, An Attempt to ascertain, etc., of the Hieroglyphs, p. 45. ® The Phoenician name of Ornithonpolis is unknown to us: the town is often mentioned by the geographers of classic times, Scylax (Muller-Didot, Geog. Grmei Min.,\o\.i. p. 78), Strabo (XVI. ii., § 24, p. 757), Pliny {H. Nat, v. 17), but with certain diflerences, some placing it to the north and
others to the south of Sarepta. It was near to the site of Adlun, the Adnonum of the Latin itineraries, if it was not actually the same place. ’ Nazana was both the name of the place and the river, as Kasimiyeh and Khan Kasimiyeh, near the same locality, are to-day. It is known only from the Anastasi Papyrus,'No. 1, pi. 20, 11. 8-21, 1. 1 ; cf. p. 5, note 6, of the present work.

As in other places of ancient date, the inhabitants rejoiced in stories of the
origin of things in which the city figured as the most venerable in the world.^

male children—twins : Samemrum, the lord of the supernal
heaven, and Usoos, the hunter.^ Human beings at this time lived a savage life,
wandering through the woods, and given up to shameful vices. Samemrum took
up his abode among them in that region which became in later times the
Tyrian coast, and showed them how to build huts, papyrus, or other reeds ; Usoos
in the mean time pursued the avocation of a hunter of wild beasts, living
upon their flesh and clothing himself with their skins. A conflict at length
broke out between the two brothers, the inevitable result of rivalry between
the ever-wandering hunter and the husbandman attached to the soil. Usoos
* Autu was identified by Brugsch (Geogr. Inscli., vol. ii. p. 43) with Avatha, which is probably El-Awwatin, on the hill facing Tyre (Renan, Mission, etc., pp. 589-591 ; cf. Masfero, Notes sur diff^rents 'points de Grammaire, in the M^l. d' Arch. Egyptienne et Assyrienne, vol. ii. p. 293). Max Muller, who reads the word as Authu, Ozu, prefers the Uru or Ushu of the Assyrian texts (Asien und Europa, p. 194), which we shall have occasion to consider lower down. In the Tel el-Amarna tablets it appears under the form Zurn, Zurri (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in British Museum, p. Ivi., n. 2), and in the Egyptian texts with the transliteration Zaura, Zauru (^Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. 21, 1. 1 ; cf. Hinges, An Attempt, etc., p. 15). Dionysios Periegetes calls it aiyvyiri (v. 911, in Mullee-Didot, Geog. Grxci Min., vol. ii. p. 160), and Strabo (XVI. ii., § 22, p. 756) hpxaiordTri irSXis 'Tvpos. ^ Philo Btblids, Fragni. 2, § 7, 8, in Mullee-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxc., vol. iii. p. 506, where all the Tyrian views as to the origin of the city are given. * The identification of the peak of Brathy is uncertain. The name has been associated with Tabor (Renan, Me'm. sur Vorigine, etc., de VHistoire pMnicienne gui ports le nom de Sanchoniathon, pp. 262, 276, accepts the correction proposed by Nolte of Bpadv into Ae^padv) since it exactly recalls the name of the cypress (Movers, Die Phonizier, p. 576) and of Berytus, it would be more prudent, perhaps, to look for the name in that of one of the peaks of the Lebanon near the latter town. ^ Some editions of Philo read M.r)tipovp.os for the name of the first brother, which has led to a comparison of the name with that of Lake Huleh (Movers, Die Phonizier, pp. 395, 667). The true reading is 'S.afj.rip.povpios o KaX 'Xtpovpdvtos, which agrees, according to some, with the shortened form of Balsamem- . rum, “the high lord of heaven” (Schroder, Die Phon. Sprache,pp. 131, 132); according to others, more probably with Shame-merum, “ the high Uranus ” (Baddissin, Stud, zur Sem. Eeligionsg., vol. ii. p. 166, n. 3; Fr. Lenormant, Les Orig. de VHist., vol. i. p. 539). The name and the legend of Usoos, the hunter, have been commonly associated with the history of Esau (Movers, Die Phonizier, pp. 396, 397 ; Renan, MismoiVe, etc., deZ’jEfist. Phenicienne, pp. 262-266); Fr. Lenormant (Les Orfgiines, etc., vol. i. p. 539) has preferred to identify him with the god Bisuof the Egyptians ; cf.

succeeded in holding his own till the day when fire and wind took the
part of his enemy against himd The trees, shaken and made to rub against
each other by the tempest, broke into flame from the friction, and the forest
was set on fire. Usoos, seizing a leafy branch, despoiled it of its foliage, and
placing it in the water let it drift out to sea, bearing him, the first of his race,
with it. Landing on one of the islands, he set up two menhirs, dedicating them
to fire and wind that he might thenceforward gain their favour. He poured
out at their base the blood of animals he had slaughtered, and after his
death, his companions continued to perform the rites which he had inaugurated.
The town which he had begun to build on the sea-girt isle was called
Tyre, the “ Rock,” ^ and the two rough stones which he had set up remained
for a long time as a sort of talisman, bringing good luck to
its inhabitants. It was asserted of old that the island had
not always been fixed, but that it rose and fell with the waves
like a raft. Two peaks looked down upon it—the “ Ambro
sian Rocks ”—between which grew the olive tree of Astarte,
sheltered by a curtain of flame from external danger. An
eagle perched thereon watched over a viper coiled round
the trunk ; the whole island would cease to float as soon
as a mortal should succeed in sacrificing the bird in honour of the gods.
Usoos, the Herakles, destroyer of monsters, taught the people of the coast
how to build boats, and how to manage them ; he then made for the
island and disembarked : the bird ofi'ered himself spontaneously to his knife,
and as soon as its blood had moistened the earth, Tyre rooted itself fixedly
opposite the mainland.^ Coins of the Roman period represent the chief
elements in this legend ; sometimes the eagle and olive tree, sometimes the
olive tree and the stelm, and sometimes the two stelm only.® From this time
forward the gods never ceased to reside on the holy island ; Astarte herself was
born there,® and one of the temples there showed to the admiration of the
faithful a fallen star—an aerolite which she had brought back from one of her
journies.'^ Baal was called the Melkarth,® king of the city, and the Greeks
* The text simply states the material facts, the tempest and the fire: the general movement of the narrative seems to prove that the intervention of these elements is an episode in the quarrel between
the two brothers —that in which Usoos is forced to fly from the region civilized by Samemrum. ^ This is tlio etymology given by the learned of classic times: 'Swp, irerpa, ii Tvplwv woAis (St. .Jekojie, Lexicon Nominum Hehraicorum, s.v.).

afterwards identified him with their Herakles. His worship was of a
severe and exacting character : a fire burned perpetually in his sanctuary ;
his priests, like those of the Egyptians,
had their heads shaved ; they wore gar
ments of spotless white linen, held pork in
abomination, and refused permission to
married women to approach the altarsd
Festivals, similar to those of Adonis at
Byblos, were held in his honour twice a
year: iu the summer, when the sun burnt
up the earth with his glowing heat, he
offered himself as an expiatory victim to
the solar orb, giving himself to the flames
in order to obtain some mitigation of the
severity of the sky ;
^ once the winter had
brought with it a refreshing coolness, he
came back to life again, and his return was
celebrated with great joy His temple stood
in a prominent place on the largest of the
islands furthest away from the mainland.^ It served to remind the people of the
remoteness of their origin, for the priests relegated its foundation almost to the
period of the arrival of the Phoenicians on the shores of the Mediterranean.® The
town had no supply of fresh water, and there was no submarine spring like that of
Arvad to provide a resource in time of necessity ; the inhabitants had, therefore,
to resort to springs which were fortunately to be found everywhere on the hill
sides of the mainland. The waters of the well of Has el- Ain had been led down to
the shore and dammed up there, so that boats could procure a ready supply from
this source in time of peace : in time of war the inhabitants of Tyre had to trust
to the cisterns in which they had collected the rains that fell at certain seasons.®
' The worship of Melkarth at Gades (Cadiz) and the functions of his priests are described by Silius Italicus (iii. 21-31) : as Gades was a Tyrian colony, it has been naturally assumed that the main features of the religion of Tyre were reproduced there, and Silius’s account of the Melkarth of Gades thus applies
to his namesake of the mother city (Moyers, Die Phon., p. 401, et seq. ; Keneick, Plioen., pp. 322, 323).
^ The festival commemorating his death by fire was celebrated at Tyre, where his tomb was shown
(Clement op Eome, Becognitiones, x. 24), and in the greater number of the Tyrian colonies (Movers,
Die Phonizier, pp. 153-155, 394, 395 ; Pietschmann, Gesch. der PhOtiizier, p. 234, n. 3).
^ The festival of the “ Awakening of Melkarth,” rov 'UpaKkeovs eyepa-is, is mentioned by Menander,
Frag. 1, in Muller-Didot, Frag. Hist. Grxc., vol. iv. p. 446, where the editor gives a different text, rh fiiu Tov UpaKkeovs irpaTov i-Kati]ffaTo iv Ylepirltp p-Ttvi, taken from JoSEPHUS, Contra Apionem, i. 18 ;

The strait separating the island from the mainland was some six or seven
hundred yards in breadth,^ less than that of the Nile at several points of its
course through Middle Egypt, but it was as effective as a broader channel to
stop the movement of an army : a fleet alone would have a chance of taking
the city by surprise, or of capturing it after a lengthened siege. Like the
coast region opposite Arvad, the shore which faced Tyre, lying between the
mouth of the Litany and Ras el-Ain, was an actual suburb of the city itself—with
its gardens, its cultivated fields, its cemeteries, its villas, and its fortifications.
Here the inhabitants of the island were accustomed to bury their dead, and
hither they repaired for refreshment during the heat of the summer. To the
north the little town of Mahalliba,on the southern bank of the Litany, and almost
hidden from view by a turn in the hills, commanded the approaches to the Bekaa,
and the high-road to Coele-Syria.^ To the south, at Eas el-Ain, Old Tyre
(Palaetyrus) looked down upon the route leading into Galilee by way of the
mountains.^ Eastwards Autu commanded the landing-places on the shore, and
served to protect the reservoirs ; it lay under the shadow of a rock, on which was
built, facing the insular temple of Melkarth, protector of mariners, a sanctuary
of almost equal antiquity dedicated to his namesake of the mainland.^ The
latter divinity was probably the representative of the legendary Saraemrum, who
sie«'e his town would neither have water nor wood (Bezold-Bodge, Tlie Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 30,° p. 65, 11. 37-44; No. 28, p. 61, 11. 74-76 ; No. 31, pp. 66, 67, II. 18-20, 49-54 ; No. 29, pp. 62, 63, 11. 63-66). Mention of vessels bringing water is made in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xxi. 1. 2 ; of. CiiAEAS, Voyage d’mi Egyptien, pp. 168, 169. Aqueducts and conduits of water are spoken of by Menander as existing in the time of Shalmaneser (Josephus, Ant. Jud., IX. xiv. 2); all modern historians agree in attributing their construction to a very remote antiquity (Movers, Das Phbmzisclie Alterthum, vol. i. pp. 231-240 ; Kenrick, Phcenicia, p. 384 ; Eenan, Mission de Phe'tiicie, pp. 593, 594 ; PiETSCHiiANN, Geschiclite der Phonizier, p. 70). * According to the writers who were contemporary with Alexander, the strait was 4 stadia wide (nearly ^ mile), or 500 paces (about 3 mile), at the period when the Macedonians undertook the siege of the town (Diodorus Siculus, xvii 40; Quintus Curtius, IV. ii. 7); the author followed by Pliny says {PI. Nat, v. 17) 700 paces, possibly over | mile wide. From the observations of Poulain de Bossay (Recherches sur Tyr et Pal^tyr, p. 7, et seq.), Eenan thinks the space between the island and the mainland might be nearly a mile in width, but we should perhaps do well to reduce this higher figure and adopt one agreeing better with the statements of Diodorus and Quintus Curtius {Mission de
PMnicie, pp. 527, 528). 2 Mahalliba is the present Khurbet-Mahallib (Clermont-Ganneau, Epigraphie et Antiquite's se'mitiques en 1891, in the Journal Asiatique, vol. xix., 1892, p. 118 ; and Maspeeo, De Quelques Localitgs voisines de Sidon, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. p. 101). ^ Palietyrus has often been considered as a Tyre on the mainland of greater antiquity than the town of the same name on the island (Movers, Das Phunizische Alterthum, vol. i. pp. 171-177 ; Kenrick, Phoenicia, pp. 342-346) ; it is now generally admitted that it was merely an outpost (Eenan, Mission de Ph^nicie, pp. 576, 577 ; Pietschmann, Geschiclite der Phonizier, pp. 68-70), which is conjecturally placed by most scholars in the neighbourhood of Eas el-Ain. * For Autu, cf. p. 183 of the present work. If the name has been preserved, as I believe it to be, in that of El-Awwatin, the town must be that whose ruins we find at the foot of Tell-Mashuk, and which are often mistaken for those of Palaetyrus (Eenan, Mission de Ph^nicie, pp. 578, 579). The temple on the summit of the Tell was probably that of Heracles Astrochiton mentioned by Nonnus {Dionysiaca, xl. 396), as was conjectured by Bertou (Essais sur la Topographic de Tyr, p. 68), but not accepted by Movers {Das Phonizische Alterthum, vol. i. p. 241, note 170)— a conjecture, however, which has appeared possible, and even probable, to other scholars (Eenan, Mission de Plafnicie, pp. 582, 583) ; this is the temple which the Tyrians represented to Alexander as being older than that of insular Tyre (Justin, xi. 10 ; Quintus Curtius, iv. 2).

had built his village on the coast, while Usoos had founded his on the ocean.
He was the Baalsamim of starry tunic, lord of heaven and king of the sun.^
As was customary, a popular Astarte was associated with these deities of high
degree, and tradition asserted that Melkarth purchased her favour by the gift of
the first robe of Tyrian purple which was ever dyed. Priestesses of the goddess
had dwellings in all parts of the plain, and in several places the caves are still
pointed out where they entertained the devotees of the goddess.® Behind Autu
the ground rises abruptly, and along the face of the escarpment, half hidden by
trees and brushwood, are the remains of the most important of the Tyrian bury
ing-places, consisting of half-filled-up pits, isolated caves, and dark galleries,
where whole families lie together in their last sleep. In some spots the chalky
mass has been literally honeycombed by the quarrying gravedigger, and regular
lines of chambers follow one another in the direction of the strata, after the
fashion of the rock-cut tombs of Upper Egypt. They present a bare and dismal
appearance both within and without. The entrances are narrow and arched,
the ceilings low, the walls bare and colourless, unrelieved by moulding, picture,
or inscription.^ At one place only, near the modern village of Hanavveh, a few
groups of figures and coarsely cut stelae are to be found, indicating, it would
seem, the burying-place of some chief of very early times. These figures

run in parallel lines along the rocky sides of a wild ravine. They vary
from 2 feet 6 inches to 3 feet in height, the bodies being represented by
rectangular pilasters, sometimes merely rough-hewn, at others grooved with
curved lines to suggest the folds of the Asiatic garments ; the head is carved
full face, though the eyes are given in profile, and the summary treatment
of the modelling gives evidence of a certain skill.^ Whether they are to be
regarded as the product of a primitive Amorite art or of a school of Phoenician
craftsmen, we are unable to determine. In the time of their prosperity the
Tyrians certainly pushed their frontier as far as this region. The wind-swept
but fertile country lying among the ramifications of the lowest spurs of
the Lebanon bears to this day innumerable traces of their indefatigable
industry—remains of dwellings, conduits and watercourses, cisterns, pits,
millstones and vintage-troughs, are scattered over the fields, interspersed with
oil and wine presses. The Phoenicians took naturally to agriculture, and
carried it to such a high state of perfection as to make it an actual science, to
which the neighbouring peoples of the Mediterranean were glad to accom
modate their modes of culture in later times.^ Among no other people was
the art of irrigation so successfully practised, and from such a narrow strip of
territory as belonged to them no other cultivators could have gathered such
abundant harvests of wheat and barley, and such supplies of grapes, olives, and
other fruits. Prom Arvad to Tyre, and even beyond it, the littoral region and
the central parts of the valleys presented a long ribbon of verdure of varying
breadth, where fields of corn were blended with gardens and orchards and shady
woods. The whole region was independent and self-supporting, the inhabitants
having no need to address themselves to their neighbours in the interior,
or to send their children to seek their fortune in distant lands. To insure
prosperity, nothing was needed but a slight exercise of labour and freedom
from the devastating influence of war.
The position of the country was such as to secure it from attack, and from
the conflicts Avhich laid waste the rest of Syria. Along almost the entire
eastern border of the country the Lebanon was a great wall of defence running
parallel to the coast, strengthened at each extremity by the additional pro
tection of the rivers Nabr el-Kebir and Litany. Its slopes were further defended
by the forest, which, with its lofty trees and brushwood, added yet another
barrier to that afforded by rocks and snow. Hunters’ or shepherds’ paths led
' Lortet, Syrie d'aujourd’kui, pp. 138-140, iu whicli tlie author expresses his belief that this is a very ancient work of the Phojaicians. ^ Their taste for agriculture, and the comparative perfection of their modes of culture, are proved by the greatness of the remains still to be observed : “ The Phoenicians constructed a winepress, a trough, to last for ever” (Kenan, Blissmi de Pkenicie, pp. 633-G35 ; cf. p. 321). Their colonists at Carthage carried with them the same clever methods, and the Romans borrowed many excellent things in the way of agriculture from Carthaginian books, especially from those of Mago.

here and there in tortuous courses from one side of the mountain to the other.
Near the middle of the country two roads, practicable in all seasons, secured com
munications between the littoral and the plain of the interior. They branched
off on either side from the central road in the neighbourhood of Tubakhi, south
of Qodshu, and served the needs of the wooded province of Magara.^ This
region was inhabited by pillaging tribes, which the Egyptians called at one
time Lamnana, the Libanites,^ at others Shausu, using for them the same appella
tion as that which they bestowed upon the Bedouin of the desert.^ The roads
through this province ran under the dense shade afforded by oaks, cedars, and
cypresses, in an obscurity favourable to the habits of the wolves and hyaenas which
infested it, and even of those thick-maned lions known to Asia at the time ;
and then proceeding in its course, crossed the ridge in the neighbourhood of the
snow-peak called Shaua, which is probably the Sannin ^ of our times. While
one of these roads, running north along the lake of Yamuneh and through the
gorge of Akura, then proceeded along the Adonis ® to Byblos, the other took a
southern direction, and followed the Nahr el-Kelb to the sea.® Towards the
mouth of the latter a wall of rock opposes the progress of the river, and leaves
at length but a narrow and precipitous defile for the passage of its waters ; a
pathway cut into the clifi" at a very remote date leads almost perpendicularly from
the bottom of the precipice to the summit of the promontory. Commerce
followed these short and direct routes, but invading hosts very rarely took
‘ Magaia is mentioned in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, p. xix. 1. 2, and Chabas (Voyage d’uii Egyptien, pp. 12G, 127) has identified it with the plain of Macra, which Strabo (XVI. ii., § 17, p. 755) places in Syria, in the neighbourhood of Eleutheros. The same locality has been associated by Chabas (Etudes sur VAntiguitd Historique, 2nd edit., p. 216, note 2) with the Makhar-pit named in a papyrus at Bologna (Lincke, Correspondenzen aus der Zeit der Eamessiden, pi. vii. 1. 9), and by the same writer (Beilr'dge zur Kenntniss der altxgyptischen Literatur, pp. 21, 22) with the Magra-put of the lists of Thutmosis III. (Maeiette, Les Listes Gdog. de Karnak, p. 39, No. 91); for arguments against this view, see W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 71.3, note 2, and p. 391, note 1. The context shows that the wooded region extending along the eastern slopes of the Lebanon, on the level of Tell Nebi-Mindoh and Baalbek, is meant. Perhaps an echo of the name is preserved in the name Magoras, which was that of the river of Be} rut in Grseco-Koman times. ^ The name Lamnana is given in a picture of the campaigns of Seti I. (Chajipollion, Mon. de VEgypte, etc., pi. ccxc., and vol. ii. pp. 87, 88 ; Kosellini, Mon. Storici, pi. xlvi.), where Wilkinson was the first to recognise the name of Lebanon (Topog. of Thebes and General View of Egypt, p. 192, note 3). Brugsch was inclined to see in them the Armenians (Geog. Insch., vol. ii. pp. 38, 39), but Wilkinson’s identification now holds its ground (Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 197, et seq.). ^ Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xix. 11. 1—1 ; cf. Chabas, Voyage d’un Egyptien, p. Ill, et seq. * Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xix. 1. 4 ; cf. Chabas, Voyage d’un Egyptien, p. 128. W. Max Muller (Asien und Europa, p. 199, note 2) has rightly associated the Egyptian form Shaua with the name Saue, which serves to designate in the inscriptions of Tiglath-Pileser III. (Kost, Die Keilschrifttexte Tiglat-Pileser’s III., pp. 20, 21, 78, 79) one of the peaks of the Lebanon. From the general import of the Egyptian context Shaua can hardly be other than the Sannin of the present day. ^ This is the road pointed out by Henan (Mission de PhAhicie, pp. 305-309) as the easiest but least known of those which cross the Lebanon ; the remains of an Assyrian inscription graven on the rocks near Ain el-Asafir show that it was employed from a very early date, and Kenan thought that it was used by the armies which came from the upper valley of the Orontes. ® This road, which runs along the Nahr el-Kelb, is probably that followed by the Egyptian in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xix. 1. 6 (cf. Chabas, Voyage d’un Egyptien, p. 130, et seq.), to pass from the neighbourhood of Qodshu to Byblos and Beyrut in the valley of the Orontes.

advantage of them, although they offered access into the very heart of Phcenicia.
Invaders would encounter here, in fact, a little known and broken country, lending
itself readily to surprises and ambuscades ; and should they reach the foot of the
Lebanon range, they would find themselves entrapped in a region of slippery
defiles, with steep paths at intervals cut into the rock, and almost inaccessible
to chariots or horses, and so narrow in places that a handful of resolute men
could have held them for a long time against whole battalions. The enemy
preferred to make for the two natural breaches at the respective extremities of
the line of defence, and for the two insular cities which flanked the approaches
to them—Tyre in the case of those coming from Egypt, Arvad and Simyra for
assailants from the Euphrates. The Arvadians, bellicose by nature, would offer
strong resistance to the invader, and not permit themselves to be conquered
without a brave struggle with the enemy, however powerful he might be.^
When the disproportion of the forces which they could muster against the
enemy convinced them of the folly of attempting an open conflict, their
island-home offered them a refuge where they would be safe from any attacks.
Sometimes the burning and pillaging of their property on the mainland might
reduce them to throw themselves on the mercy of their foes, but such sub
mission did not last long, and they welcomed the slightest occasion for regaining
their liberty. Conquered again and again on account of the smallness of
their numbers, they were never discouraged by their reverses, and Phoenicia
owed all its military history for a long period to their prowess. The Tyrians
were of a more accommodating nature, and there is no evidence, at least
during the early centuries of their existence, of the display of those obstinate
and blind transports of bravery by which the Arvadians were carried away.^
Their foreign policy was reduced to a simple arithmetical question, which they
discussed in the light of their industrial or commercial interests. jTAs soon as
they had learned from a short experience that a certain Pharaoh had at his
disposal armies against which they could offer no serious opposition, they at
' Thatmoeis III. was obliged to enter on a campaign against Arvad in the year XXIX. (Annals, II. 4-7), in the year XXX. (id., 11. 7-9), and probably twice in the following years. Under Amenothes III. and IV. we see that these people took part in all the intrigues directed against Egypt (BezoldBudge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, pp. lix., Ixxiii., Ixxiv.) ; they were the allies of the Khati against Kumscs II. in the campaign of the year V. (Poeme de Pentaouirit, ed. E. J. DE EouGii, in the Revue Egyptulogique, vol. iii. p. 157, 1. 6), and later on we find them involved in most of the wars against Assyria. ^ No campaign against Tyre is mentioned in any of the Egyptian annals : the expedition of Thutmosis III. against Senzauru (Inscription, d’Amenemhahi, 1. 20) was not directed against “ the double Tyre,” as Ebers thought (Das Grab, etc., des Feldhauptmanns Am^nemhd), in the Zeitschrift der D. Morg. Gesellschaft,, vol. xxxi. p. 4G0), or against the “other Tyre,” if one takes without discussion Lieblein’s interpretation of the name (Sur la Ville de Tyr, in the Atti del IV Congresso, p. 33), but against a town of Coele-Syria mentioned in the Tel el-Amarna tablets with the orthography Zinzar (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets, pp. Ixvii., Ixviii.), the Sizara-Larissa of Grseco-Eoman times (Stephen op Byzantium, s.v. the Shaizar of the Arab Chronicles. On the contrary, the Tel el-Amarna tablets contain several passages which manifest the fidelity of Tyro and its governors to the King of Egypt (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets, pp. Ivi.-lxii.).

from the vassalage to which they were condemned. The obligation to pay
tribute did not appear to them so much in the light of a burthen or a sacrifice,
as a means of purchasing the right to go to and fro freely in Egypt, or in
the countries subject to its influence. The commerce acquired by these
privileges recouped them more than a hundredfold for all that their overlord
demanded from them. The other cities of the coast— Sidon, Berytus, Byblos

usually followed the example of Tyre, whether from mercenary motives, or
from their naturally pacific disposition, or from a sense of their impotence ; and
the same intelligent resignation with which, as we know, they accepted the supre
macy of the great Egyptian empire, was doubtless displayed in earlier centuries
in their submission to the Babylonians. Their records show that they did not
accept this state of things merely through cowardice or indolence, for they
are represented as ready to rebel and shake off the yoke of their foreign master
when they found it incompatible with their practical interests.^ But their
resort to war was exceptional ; they generally preferred to submit to the
powers that be, and to accept from them as if on lease the strip of coast-line at
the base of the Lebanon, which served as a site for their warehouses and dock
yards. Thus they did not find the yoke of the stranger irksome—the sea open^

for the limitations of both territory and liberty imposed upon them at homa
The epoch which was marked by their first venture on the Mediterranean, and
the motives which led to it, were alike unknown to them. The gods had taught
them navigation, and from the beginning of things they had taken to the sea
as fishermen, or as explorers in search of new lands.^ They were not driven by
poverty to leave their continental abode, or inspired thereby with a zeal for
distant cruises. They had at home sufficient corn and wine, oil and fruits, to
meet all their needs, and even to administer to a life of luxury. And if they
lacked cattle, the abundance of fish within their reach compensated for the
absence of flesh-meat. Nor was it the number of commodiously situated ports
on their coast which induced them to become a seafaring people, for their
harbours were badly protected for the most part, and offered no shelter when

Hist. Grxc., vol. iii. p. 566). According to another legend, Melkarth showed the Tyrians how to make a raft from the branches of a fig tree (Nonnus, Dionys., xl. 443, et seq.), while the construction of the first ships is elsewhere ascribed to the CaWri (Philo BYBLius,PVa5fm. 2, § 11, in Muller- Didot, Fragm.

the wind set in from the north, the rugged shore presenting little resource
against the wind and waves in its narrow and shallow havens. It was the nature
of the country itself which contributed more than anything else to make them
mariners. The precipitous mountain masses which separate one valley from
another rendered communication between them difficult, while they served also
as lurking-places for robbers. Commerce endeavoured to follow, therefore, the
sea-route in preference to the devious ways of this highwayman’s region, and it
accomplished its purpose the more readily because the common occupation of
sea-fishing had familiarised the people with every nook and corner on the
coast. The continual wash of the surge had worn away the bases of the limestone
cliffs, and the superincumbent masses tumbling down into the sea formed
lines of rocks, hardly rising above the water-level,^ which fringed the head
lands with perilous reefs, against which the waves broke continuously at
the slightest wind. It required some bravery to approach them, and no little
skill to steer one of the frail boats, which these people were accustomed to
employ from the earliest times, scatheless amid the breakers. The coasting trade
was attracted from Arvad successively to Berytus, Sidon, and Tyre, and finally
to the other towns of the coast.^ It was in full operation, doubtless, from
the VI“^ Egyptian dynasty onwards, when the Pharaohs no longer hesitated to
embark troops at the mouths of the Nile for speedy transmission to the provinces
of Southern Syria, and it was by this coasting route that the tin and amber of the
north succeeded in reaching the interior of Egypt.^ The trade was originally,
it would seem, in the hands of those mysterious Kefatiu of whom the name only
was known in later times. When the Phoenicians established themselves at the
foot of the Lebanon, they had probably only to take the place of their pre
decessors and to follow the beaten tracks which they had already made. We
have every reason to believe that they took to a seafaring life soon after their
arrival in the country, and that they adapted themselves and their civilization
readily to the exigencies of a maritime career.^ In their towns, as in most sea
ports, there was a considerable foreign element, both of slaves and freemen, but
the Egyptians confounded them all under one name, Kefatiu, whether they were
Cypriotes, Asiatics, or Europeans, or belonged to the true Tyrian and Sidonian
race. The costume of the Kafiti was similar to that worn by the people of the
interior—the loin-cloth, wdth or without a long upper garment; while in tiring

the hair they adopted certain refinements, specially a series of curls which
the men arranged in the form of an aigrette above their foreheads. This
motley collection of races was ruled over by
an oligarchy of merchants and shipowners,
whose functions were hereditai’y, and who
usually paid homage to a single king, the
representative of the tutelary god, and abso
lute master of the city.^ The industries
pursued in Phoenicia were somewhat similar
to those of other parts of Syria ; the stuffs,
vases, and ornaments made at Tyre and Sidon
could not be distinguished from those of
Hamath or of Carchemish. All manufactures
bore the impress of Babylonian influence, and
their implements, weights, measures, and
system of exchange were the same as those
in use among the Chaldmans. The products
of the country were, however, not sufficient
to freight the fleets which sailed from Phoe
nicia every year bound for all parts of the
known world, and additional supplies had to
be regularly obtained from neighbouring
peoples, who thus became used to pour into
Tyre and Sidon the surplus of their manu
factures, or of the natural wealth of their
country. The Phoenicians were also accustomed to send caravans into regions
which they could not reach in their caracks, and to establish trading stations
at the fords of rivers, or in the passes over mountain ranges.® We know
of the existence of such emporia at Laish near the sources of the Jordan,^ at
Thapsacus,® and at Nisibis,® and they must have served the purpose of a series

of posts on the great highways of the world. The settlements of the Phoenicians
always assumed the character of colonies, and however remote they might be
from their fatherland, the colonists never lost the manners and customs of their
native country. They collected together into their ohels or storehouses such
wares and commodities as they could purchase in their new localities, and,
transmitting them periodically to the coast, shipped them thence to all parts
of the world.
Not only were they acquainted with every part of the Mediterranean, hut
they had even made voyages beyond its limits. In the absence, however, of
any specific records of their naval enterprise, the routes they followed must be
a subject of conjecture. They were accustomed to relate that the gods, after
having instructed them in the art of navigation, had shown them the way to
the setting sun, and had led them by their example to make voyages even
beyond the mouths of the oceand El of Byblos was the first to leave Syria ;
he conquered Greece and Egypt, Sicily and Libya, civilizing their inhabitants,
and laying the foundation of cities everywhere^ The Sidonian Astarte, with
her head surmounted by the horns of an ox, was the next to begin her wanderings
over the inhabited earth.^ Melkarth completed the task of the gods by dis
covering and subjugating those countries which had escaped the notice of his
predecessors. Hundreds of local traditions, to be found on all the shores of the
Mediterranean down to Roman times, bore witness to the pervasive influence of
the old Canaanite colonisation. At Cyprus, for instance, we find traces of the
cultus of Kinyras,^ King of Byblos and father of Adonis ; ® again, at Crete, it is
the daughter of a Prince of Sidon, Europa, who is carried off by Zeus under the
form of a bull ;
^ it was Kadmos, sent forth to seek Europa, who visited Cyprus,
Rhodes, and the Cyclades before building Thebes in Boeotia and dying in the
forests of Illyria.’' In short, wherever the Phoenicians had obtained a footing,

their audacious activity made such an indelible impression upon the mind of
the native inhabitants that they never forgot those vigorous thick-set men
with pale faces and dark beards, and soft and specious speech, who appeared
at intervals in their large and swift sailing vessels. They made their way
cautiously along the coast, usually keeping in sight of land, making sail when
the wind was favourable, or taking to the oars for days together when occasion
demanded it, anchoring at night under the shelter of some headland, or in bad
weather hauling their vessels up the beach until the morrow. They did not
shrink when it was necessary from trusting themselves to the open sea, direct
ing their course by the Pole-star ;
^ in this manner they often traversed long
distances out of sight of land, and they succeeded in making in a short time
voyages previously deemed long and costly. It is hard to say whether they
were as much merchants as pirates—indeed, they hardly knew themselves—and
their peaceful or warlike attitude towards vessels which they encountered on
the seas, or towards the people whose countries they frequented, was probably
determined by the circumstances of the moment.^ If on arrival at a port they
felt themselves no match for the natives, the instinct of the merchant pre
vailed, and that of the pirate was kept in the background. They landed
peaceably, gained the good will of the native chief and his nobles by small
presents, and spreading out their wares, contented themselves, if they could do
no better, with the usual advantage obtained in an exchange of goods. They
were never in a hurry, and would remain in one spot until they had exhausted
all the resources of the country, while they knew to a nicety how to display
their goods attractively before the expected customer. Their wares comprised
weapons and ornaments for men, axes, swords, incised or damascened daggers with
hilts of gold or ivory, bracelets, necklaces, amulets of all kinds, enamelled vases,
glass-work, stuffs dyed purple or embroidered with gay colours. At times the
natives, whose cupidity was excited by the exhibition of such valuables, would
attempt to gain possession of them either by craft or by violence. They would
kill the men who had landed, or attempt to surprise the vessel during the
together and construed with an exaggeration habitual to the author. As in the story of Europa, we must here see in the person and adventures of Kadmos merely a type as well as a collection of legends of Hellenic origin. Here again we are forced to recall the fact that the Greeks connected these traditions with memories of Phoenician colonisation. ' The Greeks for this reason called it Phcenike, the Phoenician star (Hyginus, Asfronom., ii., § 2) cf. also in Movers, Has Phbnizische Alterlhum, vol. iii. pp. 185, 18G, the passages from ancient writers referring to the use which the Phoenicians made of the Pole-star to guide them in navigation. ^ The manner in which the Phoenicians plied their trade is strikingly described in the Odyssey, XV. 40.8-481, in the part where Eumaios relates how he was carried oft’ by a Sidonian vessel and sold as a slave ; cf. the passage which mentions the ravages of the Greeks on the coast of the Delta, xiv. 2G2-2G5. Herodotus (I. i.) recalls the rape of lo, daughter of Inachos, by the Phoenicians, who carried her and her companions into Egypt ; on the other hand, during one of their Egyptian expeditions they had taken two priestesses from Thebes, and had transported one of them to Dodona, the other into Libya (II. liv., Ivi.).



19G SYIUA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EGYPTIAN CONQUEST.
night. But more often it was the Phoenicians who took advantage of the friend
liness or the weakness of their hosts. They would turn treacherously upon the
unarmed crowd when absorbed in the interest of buying and selling ; robbing
and killing the old men, they would make prisoners of the young and strong,
the women and children, carrying them off to sell them
in those markets where slaves were known to fetch the
highest price. This was a recognised trade, but it
exposed the Phoenicians to the danger of reprisals,
and made them objects of an undying hatred.
AVhen on these distant expeditions they were
subject to trivial disasters which might lead to
serious consequences. A mast might break, an
oar might damage a portion of the bulw'arks,
a storm might force them to throw over
board part of their cargo or their
provisions ; in such predicaments they
had no means of repairing the damage,
and, unable to obtain help in any
of the places they might visit, their pros
pects were of a desperate character. They
soon, therefore, learned the necessity of
establishing cities of refuge at various points in the
countries with which they traded—stations where
they could go to refit and revictual their vessels, to
fill up the complement of their crews, to take in
new freight, and, if necessary, pass the winter or
wait for fair w'eather before continuing their voyage.
For this purpose they chose by preference islands lying within easy distance of
the mainland, like their native cities of Tyre and Arvad, but possessing a good
harbour or roadstead. If an island were not available, they selected a
peninsula with a narrow isthmus, or a rock standing at the extremity of a
promontory, which a handful of men could defend against any attack, and
which could be seen from a considerable distance by their pilots. Most of
their stations thus happily situated became at length important towns. They
were frequented by the natives from the interior, who allied themselves with
the new-comers, and furnished them not only with objects of trade, but with
soldiers, sailors, and recruits for their army ; and such was the rapid spread of

these colonies, that before long the Mediterranean was surrounded by an almost
unbroken chain of Phoenician strongholds and trading stations.
All the towns of the mother country —Arvad, By bios, Berytus, Tyre, and
Sidon—possessed vessels engaged in cruising long before the Egyptian con
quest of Syria.^ We have no direct information from any existing monument
to show us what these vessels were like, but we are familiar with the construc
tion of the galleys which formed the fleets of the Pharaohs of the XVIIP’^
dynasty. The art of shipbuilding had made considerable progress since the
times of the Memphite kings.^ From the period when Egypt aspired to
become one of the great powers of the world, she doubtless endeavoured to
bring her naval force to the same pitch of perfection as her land forces could
boast of, and her fleets probably consisted of the best vessels which the dock
yards of that day could turn out. Phoenician vessels of this period may there
fore be regarded with reason as constructed on lines similar to those of the
Egyptian ships, differing from them merely in the minor details of the
shape of the hull and manner of rigging. The hull continued to be built
long and narrow, rising at the stem and stern. The bow was terminated by a
sort of hook, to which, in time of peace, a bronze ornament was attached,
* For tlie existence of a navy at Byblos, see p. 172 of the present work; its vessels, together witli those of Sirayra, Berytus, and Sidon, are mentioned in the Tel cl-Amarna tablets (Bezold-Budgk, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 13, pi. 30, 11. 12-1-1, 17-20 ; No. 30, pis. 61, 65, 11. 65-68 ; No. 28, p. 61, II. 57-63). ^ Drawn by Bondier, from a photograph by Beato. ’ For the Egyptian navy of the Memphite period, cf.

fashioned to represent the head of a divinity, gazelle, or hull, while in time of
war this was superseded by a metal cut-water made fast to the hull by several
turns of stout rope, the blade rising some couple of yards above the level of the
deck.^ The poop was ornamented with a projection firmly attached to the
body of the vessel, but curved inwards and terminated by an open lotus-flower.
An upper deck, surrounded by a wooden rail, was placed at the bow and stern
to serve as forecastle and quarter-decks respectively, and in order to protect
the vessel from the dauger of heavy seas the ship was strengthened by a
structure to which we find nothing analogous in the shipbuilding of classical
times : an enormous cable attached to the gammonings of the bow rose obliquely
to a height of about a couple of yards above the deck, and, passing over four small
crutched masts, was made fast again to the gammonings of the stern. The hull
measured from the blade of the cut-water to the stern-post some twenty to five
and twenty yards, but the lowest part of the hold did not exceed five feet in
depth. There was no cabin, and the ballast, arms, provisions, and spare-rigging
occupied the open hold.^ The bulwarks were raised to a height of some two
feet, and the thwarts of the rowers ran up to them on both the port and star
board sides, leaving an open space in the centre for the long-boat, bales of
merchandise, soldiers, slaves, and additional passengers.® A double set of
steering-oars and a single mast completed the equipment. The latter, which
rose to a height of some twenty-six feet, was placed amidships,^ and was held
in an upright position by stays. The masthead was surmounted by two arrange
ments which answered respectively to the top [“ gabie ”] and calcet of the
masts of a galley.® There were no shrouds on each side from the masthead to
the rail, but, in place of them, two stays ran respectively to the bow and
stern. The single square-sail was extended between two yards some sixty to
' To get a clear idea of the details of this structure, we have only to compare the appearance of ships with and witliout a cut-water in the scenes at Thebes, representing the celebration of a festival at the return of the licet (Mariette, Ihir el-Bahari, pis. 11, 12). ^ M. Glaser thinks that there were cabins for the crew under the deck, and he recognises in the sixteen oblong marks on the sides of the vessels at Deir el-Bahari so many dead-lights (Das Seewesen der alien lEgijpter, p. 16); as there could not have been space for so many cabins, I had concluded that these wei'e ports for oars to be used in time of battle (Be quelques Navigations des Fgyptiens, p. 13, and notes 1, 8), but on further consideration I saw that they represented the ends of the beams supporting the deck. “ One of the bas-reliefs exhibits a long-boat in the water at the time the fleet was at anchor at I'uanit (Mariette, Delr el-Bahari, pi. 6). As we do not find any vessel towing one after her, we naturally conclude that the boat must have been stowed on board. •* For the mode in which the mast was stepped and maintained firmly in its place, see Belgek, Deck, Ruderhdnke und Masthefestigung an JEggptischen Schiffsmodellen, in the Zeitsclirift, vol. xxxiii. pp. 27-32. The “ gabie ” was a species of top where a sailor was placed on the look-out. It is the Kapxnaiov of the Greeks, the “ calcese ” of the Italians. The “ calcet ” is, properly speaking, a square block of wood containing the sheaves on which the halyards travelled. The Egyptian apparatus had no sheaves, and answers to the “ calcet ” on the masts of a galley only in its serving the same purpose. Its details are given on a large scale by Dumichex, Die Flotte einer JEgyptischen Konigin, pi. x.



THE PHCENICIAN CREWS. 199
seventy feet long, and each made of two pieces spliced together at the centre.
The upper yard was straight, while the lower curved upward at the ends. The
yard was hoisted and lowered by two halyards, which were made fast aft at the
feet of the steersmen. The yard was kept in its place by two lifts which came
down from the masthead, and were attached respectively about eight feet from
the end of each yard-arm. When the yard was hauled up it was further sup
ported by six auxiliary lifts, three being attached to each yard-arm. The
lower yard, made fast to the mast by a figure-of-eight knot, was secured by
sixteen lifts, which, like those of the upper yard, worked through the “ calcet.”
The crew comprised thirty rowers, fifteen on each side, four top-men, two
steersmen, a pilot at the bow, who signalled to the men at the helm the course
to steer, a captain and a governor of the slaves, who formed, together with ten
soldiers, a total of some fifty men.’^ In time of battle, as the rowers would be
exposed to the missiles of the enemy, the bulwarks were further heightened
by a mantlet, behind which the oars could be freely moved, while the
bodies of the men were fully protected, their heads alone being visible
above it. The soldiers were stationed as follows : two of them took their
places on the forecastle, a third was perched on the masthead in a sort of cage
improvised on the bars forming the top, while the remainder were posted on
the deck and poop, from which positions and while waiting for the order to
board they could pour a continuous volley of arrows on the archers and sailors
of the enemy.^
The first colony of which the Phoenicians made themselves masters was that
island of Cyprus whose low, lurid outline they could see on fine summer
evenings in the glow of the western sky.® Some hundred and ten miles in
length and thirty-six in breadth, it is driven like a wedge into the angle which
Asia Minor makes with the Syrian coast : it throws out to the north-east a
narrow strip of land, somewhat like an extended finger pointing to where the
two coasts meet at the extremity of the gulf of Issos. A limestone cliff, of
almost uniform height throughout, bounds, for half its length at least, the
northern side of the island, broken occasionally by short deep valleys,
which open out into creeks deeply embayed. A scattered population of
fishermen exercised their calling in this region, and small towns, of which
" I have made this calculation from an examination of the scenes in which ships are alternative!}' represented as at anchor and under weigh (Makieite, jDeir el-Baliari,\>\. 6); I know of vessels of
smaller size, and consequently with a smaller crew, but I know of none larger or more fully manned.
^ The details are taken from the only representation of a naval battle which we possess up to this moment, viz, that of whicli I shall have occasion to’ speak further on in connection with the reign of
Eamses III. (Champollion, Monuments de I’Egypte, etc., pi. cc.xxii. ; KosELLixr, Monumenti Storici, pis. cxxx., cxxxi.). “ For the various names of Cyprus in classical antiquity, see Exgel, Kypros, vol. i. pp. 11-2-1.

we possess only the Greek or Grecised names — Karpasia, Aphrodision, Kerynia,
Lapethos—led there a slumbering existence. Almost in the centre of the
island two volcanic peaks, Troodes and Olympos, face each other, and rise to a
height of nearly 7000 feet, the range of mountains to which they belong
that of Aous—forming the framework of the island. The spurs of this range
fall by a gentle gradient towards the south, and spread out either into stony
slopes favourable to the culture of the vine, or into great maritime flats fringed
with brackish lagoons. The valley which lies on the northern side of this
chain runs from sea to sea in an almost unbroken level. A scarcely per
ceptible watershed divides the valley into two basins similar to those of Syria,
the larger of the two lying opposite to the Phoenician coast. The soil consists
of black mould, as rich as that of Egypt, and renewed yearly by the overflowing
of the Pediseos and its affluents. Thick forests occupied the interior, promising
inexhaustible resources to any naval power. Even under the Roman emperors
the Cypriotes boasted that they could build and tit out a ship from the keel to
the masthead without looking to resources beyond those of their own island.^
The ash, pine, cypress, and oak flourished on the sides of the range of xlous,^
while cedars grew tlu re to a greater height and girth than even on the Lebanon.^
Wheat, barley, olive trees, vines, sweet-smelling woods for burning on the altar,
medicinal plants such as the poppy and the ladanim,^ henna for staining
with a deep orange colour the lips, eyelids, palm, nails, and finger-tips of
the w'omen,® all found here a congenial habitat ; while a profusion everywhere
of sweet-smelling flowers, which saturated the air with their penetrating odours

spring violets, many-coloured anemones, the lily, hyacinth, crocus, nar
cissus, and wild rose—led the Greeks to bestow upon the island the designa
tion of “the balmy Cyprus.” Mines also contributed their share to the
riches of which the island could boast. Iron in small quantities, alum,
asbestos, agate and other precious stones, are still to be found there, and
in ancient times the neighbourhood of Tamassos yielded copper in such

The ancients derived the name of the island from that of the plant (Stephen of
Byzantium, s.v. Kvtrpos-, Eustathius, Com. ad IHomjsium Periegeten, v. 508, 509, in Mullee-Didot, Gengraplii Grseci Mtiiores, vol. ii. p. 312).

Europe.^ It is uot easy to determine the race to which the first inhabitants of the
island belonged, if we are notto see in them a branch of theKefatiu, who frequented
the Asiatic shores of the Mediterranean from a very remote period.^ In the time
of Egyptian supremacy they called their country Asi, and this name inclines one
to connect the people with the ^Egeans.^ An examination of the objects found
in the most ancient tombs of the island seems to confirm this opinion. These
consist, for the most part, of weapons and implements of stone—knives, hatchets,
hammers, and arrow-heads ; and mingled with these rude objects a score of
different kinds of pottery, chiefly hand-made and of coarse design— pitchers;with
contorted bowls, shallow buckets, especially of the milk-pail variety, provided
with spouts and with pairs of rudimentary handles. The pottery is red or black
in colour, and the ornamentation of it consists of incised geometrical designs.
Copper and bronze, where we find examples of these metals, do not appear to
have been employed in the manufacture of ornaments or arrow-heads, but
' For the copper mining industry in ancient times, see Ekgel, Kyprof, vol. i. pp. 42-53. ^ Bii!CH and Chabas saw in Cyprus the Egyptian name Kafit, Kafiti, M^moire sur une Patere ggyptienne du Mus^e du Louvre, pp. 23-28, 50-52. Birch thought that the first syllable of Kuirpos contained the element “Kef,” “Kaf,” from which Kafit is derived, and that the name ^cprjKss given to the Cypriotes is another form of the same word ; cf. Brugsch, Geog. Insehr., vol. ii. pp. 86, 87, who
connects it with the Hebrew Kaphthor. “ “ Asi,” “ Asii,’’ was at first sought for on the Asiatic continent— at Is on the Euphrates (Birch, Ohs. on the Statistical Tablet of Karnal;, pp. 46, 47), or in Palestine (Brugsch, Geog. Ins., vol. ii. pp. 51, 52): the discovery of the Canopic decree allows us to identify it with Cyprus, and this has^now been generally done (Brugsch, Gesch. Mgypten^, p. 301 ; Ed. Meyer, Gesch. Mgyptens, p. 230 ; W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 336, 337). The reading “ Asebi ” is still maintained by some. On the possible connection of Asi and ' haia , see Maspbro, in the Bevue Critique, 1886, vol. ii. p. 199. W. Max Muller has tried to show that Asi and Alasia are two forms of the same word, and cunsequently that Alasia is also Cyprus (Dos Land Alaschya, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. x. pp. 257-264).

usually iu making daggers. There is no indication anywhere of foreign
influence, and yet Cyprus had already at this time entered into relations with
the civilized nations of the continent.^ According to Chaldsean tradition, it
was conquered about the year 3800 b.c. by Sargon of Agade; ^ without insist
ing upon the reality of this conquest, which in any case must have been
ephemeral in its nature, there is reason to believe that the island was sub
jected from an early period to the influence of the various peoples which lived
one after another on the slopes of the Lebanon, Popular legend attributes to
King Kinyras and to the Giblites [i.e. the people of Byblos] the establishment
of the first Phcenician colonies in the southern region of the island— one of them
being at Paphos, where the worship of Adonis and Astarte continued to a very late
date.^ The natives preserved their own language and customs, had their own
chiefs, and maintained their national independence, while constrained to submit at
the same time to the presence of Phcenician colonists or merchants on the coast,
and in the neighbourhood of the mines in the mountains. The trading centres
of these settlers—Kition, Amathus, Solius, Golgos, and Tamassos — were soon,
however, converted into strongholds, which ensured to Phoenicia the monopoly
of the immense wealth contained in the island.^
Tyre and Sidon had no important centres of industry on that part of the
Canaanite coast which extended to the south of Carmel, and Egypt, even in
the time of the shepherd kings, woidd not have tolerated the existence on her
territory of any great emporium not subject to the immediate supervision of
her official agents. We know that the Libyan cliffs long presented an obstacle
to inroads into Egyptian territory, and baffled any attempts to land to the west
wards of the Delta ; the Phoenicians consequently turned with all the greater
ardour to those northern regions which for centuries had furnished them with
most valuable products— bronze, tin, amber, and iron, both native and wrought.
A
little to the north of the Orontes, where the Syrian border is crossed and Asia
Minor begins, the coast turns due west and runs in that direction for a considerable
distance. The Phoenicians were accustomed to trade along this region, and
we may attribute, perhaps, to them the foundation of those obscure cities
* An examination into the origin of the Cypriotes formed part of the original scheme of this work, together with that of the monuments of tlie various races scattered along the coast of Asia Minor and the islands of the iEgean ; but I have been obliged to curtail it, in order to keep within the limits I had prescribed for myself, and I have merely epitomised, as briefly as possible, the results of the researches undertaken iu those regions duiing the last fewyears, particularly thoseof Ohnefalsch-Richter. ^ Cf. what is said on the subject of tliis conquest in Maspeko, Dawn of Civilization, p. 598. ^ All the legends relating to the foundation of Paphos have been brought together by Engel, Kypros, vol. i. pp. 123, 1G8-173, vol. ii. p.91, et seq , and by Movers, Das PhdnizischeAlterthum, vol. ii. pp. 226,227. ^ The Plicenician origin of these towns is proved by the passages from classical writers collected by Engel, Kypros, vol. i. pp. 71, 72, 103-105, 109-111, 121-121 (who admits it only in the case of Paphos, Amathus, and Kition), and by Movers, Das Phonizische Alterthum, vol. ii. p. 221, et seq.). The date of the colonisation is uncertain, but with the knowledge we possess of the t fficient vessels belonging to the various Phoenician towns, it would seem difficult not to allow that the toasts at least of Cyprus must have been partially occupied at the time of the Egyptian invasions.

served their apparently Semitic names down to the time of the Roman epoch.
The whole of the important island of Rhodes fell into their power, and its
three ports, lalysos, Lindos, and Ramiros, afforded them a well-situated base
of operations for further colonisation.^ On leaving Rhodes, the choice of two
routes presented itself to them. To the south-west they could see the distant
outline of Karpathos, and on the far horizon behind
it the summits of the Cretan chain. Crete itself
bars on the south the entrance to the .dSgean, and
is almost a little continent, self-contained and self
sufficing. It is made up of fertile valleys and
mountains clothed with forests, and its inhabitants
could employ themselves in mines and fisheries.
The Phoenicians effected a settlement on the coast
at Itanos, at Kairatos, and at Arados,® and obtained possession of the peak of
Cythera, where, it is said, they raised a sanctuary to Astarte.* If, on
leaving Rhodes, they had chosen to steer due north, they would soon have
come into contact with numerous rocky islets scattered in the sea between
the cohtinents of Asia and Europe, which would have furnished them with
as many stations, less easy of attack, and more readily defended than
posts on the mainland. Of these the Giblites occupied Melos, while the
Sidonians chose Oliaros and Thera,® and we find traces of them in every
island where any natural product, such as metals, sulphur, alum, fuller’s
earth, emery, medicinal plants, and shells for producing dyes, offered an
attraction.® The purple used by the Tyrians for dyeing is secreted by several
varieties of molluscs common in the Eastern Mediterranean ; those most
esteemed by the dyers were the Murex trunculus and the Murex Brandaris,
and solid masses made up of the detritus of tliese shells are found in enormous

(][Ticiiitities in the neighbourhood of many Phoenician towns. The colouring
matter was secreted in the head of the shellfish. To obtain it the shell was
broken by a blow from a hammer, and the small quantity of slightly yellowish
liquid which issued from the fracture was carefully collected and stirred
about in salt water for three days. It was then boiled in leaden
vessels and reduced by simmering over a slow fire ; the remainder was
strained through a cloth to free it from the particles of flesh still
floating in it, and the material to be dyed was then plunged into the
liquid. The usual tint thus imparted was that of fresh blood, in some
lights almost approaching to black ; but careful manipulation could
produce shades of red, dai’k violet, and amethystd Phoenician settle
ments can be traced, therefore, by the heaps of shells upon the shore,
the Cyclades and the coasts of Greece being strewn with this refuse.
The veins of gold in the Pangaion range in IMacedonia attracted them
to that region, while the islands off the Thracian coast ^ received also
frequent visits from them, and they carried their explorations even
through the tortuous channel of the Hellespont into the Propontis,
drawn thither, no doubt, by the silver mines in the Bithynian moun
tains^ which were already being worked by Asiatic miners. Beyond
the calm waters of the Propontis, they encountered an obstacle to
their progress in another narrow channel, having more the character of
a wide river than of a strait ; it was with difficulty that they could
make their way against the violence of its current, which either tended to drive
their vessels on shore, or to dash them against the reefs which hampered the
navigation of the channel. When, however, they succeeded in making the
passage safely, they found themselves upon a vast and stormy sea, whose wooded
shores extended east and west as far as eye could reach. From the tribes
who inhabited them, and who acted as intermediaries, the Phoenician traders
were able to procure tin, lead, amber, Caucasian gold, bronze, and iron, all
products of the extreme north — a region which always seemed to elude their

persevering efforts to discover it. We cannot determine the furthest limits
reached by the Phoenician traders, since they were wont to designate the distant
countries and nations with which they traded by the vague appellations of
“ Isles of the Sea ” and “ Peoples of the Sea,” ^ refusing to give more accurate
information either from jealousy or from a desire to hide from other nations
the sources of their wealth.

with worthless objects of barter;^ their clients included the inhabitants of

the ^gean, who, if inferior to the great nations of the East, possessed an
independent and growing civilization, traces of which are still coming to light
from many quarters in the shape of tombs, houses, palaces, utensils, ornaments,
representations of the gods, and household and funerary furniture,—not only
in the Cyclades, but on the mainland of Asia Minor and of Greece. No
inferior goods or tinsel wares would have satisfied the luxurious princes who
reigned in such ancient cities as Troy and Mycenae, and who wanted the best
industrial products of Egypt and Syria — costly stuffs, rare furniture, ornate and
well- wrought weapons, articles of jewellery, vases of curious and delicate
design— such objects, in fact, as would have been found in use among the sove
reigns and nobles of Memphis or of Babylon. For articles to offer in exchange
they were not limited to the natural or roughly worked products of their own
country. Their craftsmen, though less successful in general technique than
their Oriental contemporaries, exhibited considerable artistic intelligence and
an extraordinary manual skill. Accustomed at first merely to copy the objects
sold to them by the Phoenicians, they soon developed a style of their own ; the
Mycenaean dagger in the illustration on this page, though several centuries
later in date than that of the Pharaoh Ahmosis, appears to be traceable to this
ancient source of inspiration, although it gives evidence of new elements in

its method of decoration and in its greater freedom of treatment. The inhabitants
of the valleys of the Nile and of the Orontes, and probably also those of the
Euphrates and Tigris, agreed in the high value they set upon these artistic
objects in gold, silver, and bronze, brought to them from the further shores of
the Mediterranean, which, while reproducing their own designs, modified them
to a certain extent; for just as w'e now imitate types of ornamental work in
vogue among nations less civilized than ourselves, so the .^gean people set
themselves the task through their potters and engravers of reproducing exotic
models. The Phoenician traders who exported to Greece large consignments
of objects made under various influences in their own workshops, or purchased
in the bazaars of the ancient world, brought back as a return cargo an
equivalent number of works of art, bought in the towns of the West, which
eventually found their way into the various markets of Asia and Africa. These
energetic merchants were not the first to ply this profitable trade of maritime
carriers, for from the time of the Memphite empire the products of northern
regions had found their way, through the intermediation of the Hauinibu, as
far south as the cities of the Delta and the Thebaid. But this commerce
could not be said to be either regular or continuous; the transmission was
carried on from one neighbouring tribe to another, and the Syrian sailors were
merely the last in a long chain of intermediaries — a tribal war, a migration, the
caprice of some chief, being sufficient to break the communication, and even
cause the suspension of transit for a considerable period. The Phoenicians
desired to provide against such risks by undertaking themselves to fetch the
much-coveted objects from their respective sources, or, where this was not
possible, from the ports nearest the place of their manufacture. Eeappear
ing with eacli returning year in the localities where they had established
emporia, they accustomed the natives to collect against their arrival such
products as they could profitably use in bartering with one or other of their
many customers. They thus established, on a fixed line of route, a kind of
maritime trading service, which placed all the shores of the Mediterranean in
direct communication with each other, and promoted the blending of the
youthful West with the ancient East.

rpHE account of the first expedition undertaken by Thutmosis
in Asia, a region at that time new to the Egyptians,
would be interesting if we could lay our hands upon it. We
should perhaps find in the midst of official documents, or
among the short phrases of funerary biographies, some indica
tion of the impression which the country produced upon its
conquerors. With the exception of a few merchants or
adventurers, no one from Thebes to Memphis had
any other idea of Asia than that which could be
gathered from the scattered notices of it in the
semi-historical romances of the preceding age.
The actual sight of the country must have been
a revelation ; everything appearing new and para
doxical to men of whom the majority had never left
their fatherland, except on some warlike expedition into Ethiopia dr on some
rapid raid along the coasts of the Eed Sea. Instead of their own narrow

they had before them wide irregular plains, owing their fertility not to
inundations, but to occasional rains or the influence of insignificant streams
hills of varying heights covered with vines and other products of cultivation
mountains of different altitudes irregularly distributed, clothed with forests,
furrowed with torrents, their summits often crowned with snow even in the
hottest period of summer : and in this region of nature, where everything
was strange to them, they found nations differing widely from each other in
appearance and customs, towns with crenellated walls perched upon heights
difficult of access ; and finally, a civilization far excelling that which they
encountered anywhere in Africa outside their own boundaries.
Thutmosis succeeded in reaching on his first expedition a limit which none
of his successors was able to surpass, and the road taken by him in this
campaign—from Gaza to Megiddo, from Megiddo to Qodshu, from Qodshu
to Carchemish—was that which was followed henceforward by the Egyptian
troops in all their expeditious to the Euphrates. Of the difficulties which he
encountered on his way we have no information. On arriving at Naharaim,
however, we know that he came into contact with the army of the enemy, which
was under the command of a single general—perhaps the Xing of Mitanni
himself, or one of the lieutenants of the Cossman King of Babylon— who had
collected together most of the petty princes of the northern country to resist the
advance of the intruder.^ The contest was hotly fought out on both sides, but
victory at length remained with the invaders, and innumerable prisoners fell
into their hands. The veteran Ahmosi, son of Abina, who was serving in his
last campaign, and his cousin, Ahmosi Pannekhabit, distinguished themselves
according to their wont. The former, having seized upon a chariot, brought it,
with the three soldiers who occupied it, to the Pharaoh, and received once more
“ the collar of gold ;
” ^ the latter killed twenty-one of the enemy, carrying off
their hands as trophies, captured a chariot, took one prisoner, and obtained as
reward a valuable collection of jewellery, consisting of collars, bracelets, sculp
tured lions, choice vases, and costly weapons.^ A stele, erected on the banks of
the Euphrates not far from the scene of the battle, marked the spot which the
conqueror wished to be recognised henceforth as the frontier of his empire.^
He re-entered Thebes with immense booty, by which gods as well as men
profited, for he consecrated a part of it to the embellishment of the temple of
Amon, and the sight of the spoil undoubtedly removed the lingering prejudices

which the people had cherished against expeditions beyond the isthmus.
Thiitmosis was held up by his subjects to the praise of posterity as having come
into actual contact with that country and its people, which had hitherto been
known to the Egyptians merely through the more or less veracious tales of exiles
and travellers. The aspect of the great river of the Naharaim, which could
be compared with the Nile for the volume of its waters, excited their admiration.
They were, however, puzzled by the fact that it flowed from north to south,
and even were accustomed to joke at the necessity of reversing the terms
employed in Egypt to express going up or down the river.^ This first Syrian
campaign became the model for most of those subsequently undertaken by
the Pharaohs. It took the form of a bold advance of troops, directed from Zalu
towards the north-east, in a diagonal line through the countr}^ who routed on the
way any armies which might be opposed to them, carrying by assault such towns
as were easy of capture, while passing by others which seemed strongly defended

pillaging, burning, and slaying on every side. There was no suspension of hos
tilities, no going into winter quarters, but a triumphant return of the expedition
at the end of four or five months, with the probability of having to begin fresh
operations in the following year should the vanquished break out into revolt.^
The troops employed in these campaigns were superior to any others hitherto
put into the field. The Egyptian army, inured to war by its long struggle with
the Shepherd-kings, and kept in training since the reign of Ahmosis by having
to repulse the perpetual incursions of the Ethiopian or Libyan barbarians,
had no difSculty in overcoming the Syrians ; not that the latter were wanting
in courage or discipline, but owing to their limited supply of recruits, and the
political disintegration of the country, they could not readily place under arms
such enormous numbers as those of the Egyptians. Egyptian military organi
sation had remained practically unchanged since early times : the army had
always consisted, firstly, of the militia who held fiefs, and were under the obli
gation of personal service either to the prince of the nome or to the sovereign ;

Now, lihodu means to go north, and hhonit, to go south, so that the literal translation of the phrase would call the Euphrates, “ The river where he who goes north sails as if he were going south,” that is to say, where the contrary term to that used on the Nile must be employed in speaking of going up or down the river. The solution of this little problem was first given by E. de Eouge {Etude des Monuments du Massif de Karnah, in the Mdanges d’Archdlogie Egyptienne et Assyrienne, vol. i. p. 41, n. 4; cf. Piehl, Pelites Etudes Egyptologigues,
p. 26, n. 58), from whom it was borrowed by Brugsch (Gesehichte lEgyptens, p. 265 ; Bie .^gyptische Volkertafel, in the Ahhandlungen of the Berlin Congress, Afrikanische Section, pp. 33, 34; and Die .^gyptologie, pp. 260, 261), and from Brugsch has been passed on to other Egyptologists. * From the account of the campaigns of Amenothes II., I thought we might conclude that this Pharaoh wintered in Syria at least once {Histoire Ancienne des peuples de V Orient, 1875, p. 207; cf. Lieblein, Sur un nouvel argument chronologique tir€ des r^oits datfs des guerres pharaoniques en Syrie, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. i. p. 101) ; but the text does not admit of this interpretation, and we must, therefore, for the present give up the idea that the Pharaohs ever spent more than a few months of the year on hostile territory (W. Max Mullee, Asien und Europa, p. 265, n. 4). ’ At that time, the active part of this contingent which served in the infantry went by the name

secondly, of a permanent force,^ which was divided into two corps, dis
tributed respectively between the Said and the Delta. Those companies
which were quartered on the frontier, or about the king either at Thebes or
at one of the royal residences, were bound to hold themselves in readiness to
muster for a campaign at any given moment.^ The number of natives liable
to be levied when occasion required, by “ generations,” ^ or as we should say by
classes, may have amounted to over a hundred thousand men,^ but they were
never all called out, and it does not appear that the army on active service ever
contained more than thirty thousand men at a time, and probably on ordinary
occasions not much more than ten or fifteen thousand.^ The infantry was, as
we should expect, composed of troops of the line and light troops. The former
wore either short wigs arranged in rows of curls, or a kind of padded cap by
way of a helmet, thick enough to deaden blows; the breast and shoulders were
undefended, but a short loin-cloth was wrapped round the hips, and the stomach
and upper part of the thighs were protected by a sort of triangular apron,
sometimes scalloped at the sides, and composed of leather thongs attached to
a belt. A buckler of moderate dimensions had been substituted for the
gigantic shield of the earlier Theban period ;
® it was rounded at the top and
of Vda, or, as a collective, auitu (Maspeeo, Notes au jour le jour, § 3, in the Proceedings, 1890-91,

The soldiers taken from these classes are represented at Deir elBahari, as hastening armed to meet the troops returning from the Piianit (Mariette, Deir el-Baliari, pis. 11, 12). * The only numbers which wn know are those given by Herodotus for the Sa'ite period (II. clxvi.). which are evidently exaggerated (Wiedemann, Herodot's zweites Buck, p. 577). Coming down to modern times, we see that Mehemet-Ali, from 1830 to 1840, had nearly 120,000 men in Syria, Egypt, and the Sudan; and in 1841, at the time when the treaties imposed upon him the ill-kept obligation
of reducing his army to 18,000 men, it still contained 81,000. We shall probably not be far wrong in estimating the total force which the Pharaohs of the XYIIP'' dynasty, lords of the whole valley of the Nile, and of part of Asia, had at their disposal at 120,000 or 130,000 men ; these, however, were never all called out at once. * We have no direct information respecting the armies acting in Syria ; we only know that, at the battle of Qodshu, Ramses II. had against him 2500 chariots containing three men each, making 7500 charioteers, besides a troop estimated at the Ramesseum at 8000 men, at Luxor at 9000 (Gdieysse, Textes historiques d' Ipsamboul, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. viii. p. 138), so that the Syrian army probably contained about 20,000 men. It would seem that the Egyptian army was less numerous, and I estimate it with great hesitation at about 15,000 or 18,000 men: it was considered a powerful
army, while that of the Ilittites was regarded as an innumerable host. A passage in the Anastasi
Papyrus, No. 1, pis. xiv. 1. 1, —xvi. 1. 5, tells us the composition of a corps led by Ramses II. against
the tribes in the vicinity of Qoceir and the Rahanu valley : it consisted of 5000 men, of whom 620 were Sbardana, 1600 Qabak, 70 Mashaiiasha, and 880 Negroes (Chabas, Voyage d’un Egyptien, pp. 49-72). “ For an illustration of this shield, taken from the tombs of Siut,'see Maspero, Dawn of Civiliza' lion, p. 457.

quiver, of the use of which their ancestors were ignorant, liad been borrowed
from the Asiatics, probably from the HyksOs, and was carried hanging at the side
or slung over the shoulderd Both spearmen and archers were for the most part
pure-bred Egyptians, and were divided into regiments of unequal strength,
each of which usually bore the name of some god—as, for example, the regiment
of Ka or of Phtah, of Amon or of Sutkhu ^—in which the feudal contingents,
each commanded by its lord or his lieutenants, fought side by side with the
king’s soldiers furnished from the royal domains. The effective force of the
army was made up by auxiliaries taken from the tribes of the Sahara and from
the negroes of the Upper Nile.® These auxiliaries were but sparingly em
ployed in early times, but their numbers were increased as wars became more
frequent and necessitated more troops to carry them on. Tlie tribes from which
they were drawn supplied the Pharaohs with an inexhaustible reserve; they
were courageous, active, indefatigable, and inured to hardships, and if it had
not been for their turbulent nature, which incited them to continual internal
dissensions, they might readily have shaken off the yoke of the Egyptians.
Incorporated into the Egyptian army, and placed under the instruction of
picked officers, who subjected them to rigorous discipline, and accustomed them
to the evolutions of regular troops, they were transformed from disorganised
hordes into tried and invincible battalions.^
The old army, which had conquered Nubia in the days of the Papis and
the Usirtasens, had consisted of these three varieties of foot-soldiers only, but
shemmo, which signifies foreigner (Bktjgsch, Dictionnaire Hi^roglyphique, pp. 1391, 1392, and Die AUgyptologie, pp. 240-213); but it is no longer admissible since the true reading of the word is
known piditi—and the pictures at Deir el-Bahari, in which the archers are represented, show that they, as well as the heavy infantry, belonged to the old Egyptian race. * The questions relating to the introduction of the quiver are discussed in Maspebo, Notes au jour ie jour, § 18, in the Proceedings of the Soc. Bibl. Arch., 1891-92, vol. xiv. pp. 184-187. ^ On the division of the Egyptian armies into battalions and regiments, cf. Wilkinson, Manners and Customs, 2nd edit., vol. i. p. 193, et seq. ; Ebman, ASgypten, pp. 716, 717. The army of Ramses II. at the battle of Qodshu comprised four corps, which bore the names of Amon, Ea, Phtah, and Shtkhu. Other lesser corps, designated by the name of sa, sau, the (pvXai or tribes, were named the Tribe of Pharaoh, the Tribe of the Beauty of the Solar dish (Maeiette, Catalogue general des monuments d’Abydos, pp. 385, 386, Nos. 1062, 1063; pp. 388, 389, No. 1070; p. 391, No. 1076): these, as far as I can judge, must have been troops raised on the royal domains by a system of local recruiting, who were united by certain common privileges and duties which constituted them an hereditary militia, whence they were called tribes. These military tribes are probably what the author of the treatise De Iside (§ 72,
Paethey’s edit., pp. 126, 127) calls the yivn, those races into which the army of Osiris was divided, and who each bore as a standard some divine emblem, the worship of which was common to all who composed the army ; cf. Brugsch, Die AUgyptologie, pp. 235, 236. ^ These Ethiopian recruits are occasionally represented in the Theban tombs of the XVIIP'' dynasty, among others in the tomb of Pahshkhir (Vieet, Le Tombeau de Pehsuhher, in the M^moires de la Mission Frangaise du Caire, vol. v. pp. 294, 295). * The armies of Hatshopsith already included Libyan auxiliaries, some of which are represented at Deir el-Bahari (Dumichen, Die Flotte einer .Egyptischen Konigin, pis. vi., xi. ; Maeiette, Deir el-Bahari, pi. 12) ; others of Asiatic origin are found under Amenothes IV. (Lepsitis, Denhm., iii. 92), but they are not represented on the monuments among the regular troops until the reign of Ramses II., when the Shardana appear for the first time among the king’s body-guard (E. de Rouge, Extrait d’un Memoire sur les attaques des peuples de la mer, pp. 23-25).

narrow hind-quarters, the lean and sinewy legs, and the long flowing tail which
had characterised it in its native country. The climate, however, was
enervating, and constant care had to be taken, by the introduction of new
blood from Syria, to prevent the breed from deteriorating.^ The Pharaohs
kept studs of horses in the principal cities of the Nile valley, and the great
feudal lords, following their example, vied with each other in the possession of
numerous breeding stables. The office of superintendent to these establish
ments, which was at the disposal of the Master of the Horse, became in later

(32 mares are mentioned in 1. 5, 188 in 1. 8, 26 in 1. 9, 260 in 1. 22, 180 in 1. 40), and the number would be far larger were the inscription not mutilated. Besides the usual species, powerful stallions were imported from Northern Syria, which were known by the Semitic name of Abiri, the strong (Anastasi Papyrus IV., pi. xvii. 11. 8, 9 ;

or ash and leather ; metal, whether gold or silver, iron or bronze, being used but
sparingly, and then only for purposes of ornamentation. The wheels usually had

of a single stout pole of acacia. The framework of the chariot was composed

large quivers were liung at the sides. The chariot itself was very liable to
upset, the slightest cause being sufficient to overturn it. Even when moving
at a slow pace, the least inequality of the ground shook it terribly, and when
driven at full speed it vvas only by a miracle of skill that the occupants could
maintain their equilibrium. At such times the charioteer would stand astride
of the front panels, keeping his right foot only inside the vehicle, and planting
the other firmly on the pole, so as to lessen the jolting, and to secure a wider
base on which to balance himself.^ To carry all this into practice long educa
tion was necessary, for which there were special schools of instruction, and
those who were destined to enter the army were sent to these schools when little
more than children. To each man, as soon as he had thoroughly mastered all
the difficulties of the profession, a regulation chariot and pair of horses were
granted, for which he was responsible to the Pharaoh or to his generals, and he
might then return to his home until the next call to arms.^ The warrior took
precedence of the shield-bearer, and both were considered superior to the foot
soldier; the chariotry, in fact, like the cavalry of the present day, was the
aristocratic branch of the army, in which the royal princes, together with the
nobles and their sons, enlisted.® No Egyptian ever willingly trusted himself
to the back of a horse, and it was only in the thick of a battle, when his chariot
was broken, and there seemed no other way of escaping from the melee, that a
w’arrior would venture to mount one of his steeds.^ There appear, however, to
have been here and there a few horsemen, who acted as couriers or aides-de
camp; they used neither saddle-cloth nor stirrups, but were provided with
reins with which to guide their animals, and their seat on horseback was even
less secure than the footing of the driver in his chariot.®
The infantry was divided into platoons of six to ten men each, commanded
by an officer and marshalled round an ensign, which represented either a

It was a posture frequently adopted in the melee, when the king was about to strike the enemy on either hand with the javelin, club, or spear ; when he drew the bow he would stand with both feet on the floor of the chariot. ^ Anastasi Papyrus IIL, pi. vi. 11. 2-10 ; cf.

In the great inscription in which Minephtah relates his victory over the peoples of the sea, Chabas thought he discovered the mention of officers iclio were on the king’s horses, and who set off in pursuit of the vanquished {Etudes surV Antiquity historique,2ndL edit., pp. 197, 433, u. 2); but, on the 'contrary, the text says that it was charioteers, sinniu, not riders, who did this (Mariette, Karnak, pi. 53, 1. 38) . ^ There is a figure of a horseman on an incised bronze axe in the British Museum (Wilkinson, Manners and Customs, 2nd edit., vol. i. p. 278), and several others are represented in battle pictures, as in Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte et de la Nubie, pi. xiii. ; or Eosellini, Monumenti Givili, pi. cxx., vol. iii. p. 240, et seq. ; and Monumenti Storici, pis. xlvi. 2, Ivii., Ixxxvii., xcv., cviii., cx.,cxx., where there are as many Egyptians as Asiatics.

each other, or what was their relative order of rank. Bodies of men, to the

may be merely by chance, or because the draughtsman did not take the trouble
to give the proper number accurately. The inferior officers were equipped very
much like the soldiers, with the exception of the buckler, which they do not
appear to have carried, and certainly did not when on the march ; the superior
officers might be known by their umbrella or flabellum, a distinction which gave
them the right of approaching the king’s person.^ The military exercises to which
all these troops were accustomed probably differed but little from those which
were in vogue with the armies of the Ancient Empire ; ^ they consisted in

The success of the Egyptians in battle was due more to the courage and
hardihood of the men than to the strategical skill of their commanders. We
find no trace of manoeuvres, in the sense in which we understand the word,
either in their histories or on their bas-reliefs, but they joined battle boldly
with the enemy, and the result was decided by a more or less bloody conflict.®

volleys of arrows and stones, which through the skill of the bowmen and slingers
did deadly execution ; then the pikemen laid their spears in rest, and pressing
straight forward, threw their whole weight against the opposing troops. At the
same moment the charioteers set off at a gentle trot, and gradually quickened
their pace till they dashed at full speed upon the foe, amid the confused
rumbling of wheels and the sharp clash of metal. The Egyptians, ac
customed by long drilling to the performance of such evolutions, executed
these charges as methodically as though they were still on their parade-ground
at Thebes ; if the disposition of the ground were at all favourable, not a single
chariot would break the line, and the columns would sweep across the field

without swerving or falling into disorder. The charioteer had the reins tied
round his body, and could, by throwing his weight either to the right or the
left, or by slackening or increasing the pressure through a backward or forward
motion, turn, pull up, or start his horses by a simple movement of the loins : he
went into battle with bent bow, the string drawn back to his ear, the arrow
levelled ready to let fly, while the shield-bearer, clinging to the body of the
chariot with one hand, held out his buckler with the other to shelter his com
rade, It would seem that the Syrians were less skilful ; their bows did not
carry so far as those of their adversaries, and consequently they came within
the enemy’s range some moments before it was possible for them to return the
volley with effect. Their horses would be thrown down, their drivers would
fall wounded, and the disabled chariots would check tlie approach of those
following and overturn them, so that by the time the main body came up with
the enemy the slaughter would have been serious enough to render victory
hopeless. Nevertheless, more than one charge would be necessary finally to
overturn or scatter the Syrian chariots, which, once accomplished, the Egyptian
charioteer would turn against the foot-soldiers, and, breaking up their ranks,,
would tread them down under the feet of his horses.^ Nor did the Pharaoh spare
himself in the fight ; his splendid dress, the urseus on his forehead, and the
nodding plumes of his horses made him a mark for the blows of the enemy, and
he would often find himself in positions of serious danger. In a few hours, as a
rule, the conflict would come to an end. Once the enemy showed signs of giving
way, the Egyptian chariots dashed upon them precipitously, and turned the
retreat into a rout : the pursuit was, however, never a long one ;
^ some fortress
was always to be found close at hand where the remnant of the defeated host
could take i-efuge.^ The victors, moreover, would be too eager to secure the
booty, and to strip the bodies of the dead, to allow time for following up the foe.

trophies of a kind unknown in modern warfare. When an Egyptian killed or
mortally wounded any one, he cut off, not the head, but the right hand or the
phallus, and brought it to the royal scribes. These made an accurate inventory
of everything, and even Pharaoh did not disdain to be present at the registration^
The booty did not belong to the persons who obtained it, but was thrown into a
common stock which was placed at the disposal of the sovereign : one part he
reserved for the gods, especially for his father Amon of Thebes, who had given
him the victory ; another part he kept for himself, and the remainder was dis
tributed among his army. Each man received a reward in proportion to his
rank and services, such as male or female slaves, bracelets, necklaces, arms, vases,
or a certain measured weight of gold, known as the “ gold of bravery.” ^ A
similar sharing of the spoil took place after every successful engagement : from
Pharaoh to the meanest camp-follower, every man who had contributed to the
success of a campaign returned home richer than he had set out, and the profits
which he derived from a war were a liberal compensation for the expenses
in which it had involved him.
The results of the first expedition of Thfitmosis I. were of a decisive cha
racter ; so much so, indeed, that he never again, it would seem, found it necessary
during the remainder of his life to pass the isthmus. jSTorthern Syria, it is true,
did not remain long under tribute, if indeed it paid any at all after the depar
ture of the Egyptians, but the southern part of the country, feeling itself in the
grip of the new master, accepted its defeat : Gaza became the head-quarters of
a garrison which secured the door of Asia for future invasion,^ and Pharaoh,
freed from anxiety in this quarter, gave his whole time to the consolidation of
his power in Ethiopia. The river and desert tribes of this region soon forgot
the severe lesson which he had given them : as soon as the last Egyptian
soldier had left their territory they rebelled once more, and began a fresh series
of inroads which had to be repressed anew year after year. Thutinosis I. had
several times to drive them back in the years II. and but was able to make

On the other hand, we learn from details in the lists (Mauiette, Karnak, pis. 18, 19) that the mountains and plains beyond Gaza were in a state of open rebellion. * Inscription of the year II., engraved on the rocks of the Tangur cataract, published in the Graphic, January 10, 1885, p. 43, interpreted by Birch, Hieroglyphic Inscription near the Cataract of Tangur, in

short work of their rebellions. An inscription at Tombos on the Nile, in the
very midst of the disturbed districts, told them in brave words what he was,
and what he had done since he had come to the throne. Wherever he had
gone, weapon in hand, “ seeking a warrior, he had found none to withstand
him; he had penetrated to valleys which were unknown to his ancestors, the
inhabitants of which had never beheld the wearers of the double diadem.”^
All this would have produced but little effect had he not backed up his words
by deeds, and taken decisive measures to restrain the insolence of the barbarians.
Tombos lies opposite to Hannek, at the entrance to that series of rapids known
as the Third Cataract. The course of the Nile is here barred by a formidable
dyke of granite, through which it has hollowed out sis winding channels of
varying widths, dotted here and there with huge polished boulders and verdant
islets. When the inundation is at its height, the rocks are covered and the
rapids disappear, with the exception of the lowest, which is named Lokoli,
where faint eddies mark the place of the more dangerous reefs ; and were it
not that the fall here is rather more pronounced and the current somewhat
stronger, few would suspect the existence of a cataract at the spot. As the
waters go down, however, the channels gradually reappear. When the river is
at its lowest, the three westernmost channels dry up almost completely, leaving
nothing but a series of shallow pools ; those on the east still maintain their
How, but only one of them, that betw'een the islands of Tombos and Abadin,^
remains navigable. Here Thutmosis built, under invocation of the gods of
Heliopolis, one of those brickwork citadels, with its rectangular keep, which set at
nought all the efforts and all the military science of the Ethiopians : attached
to it was a harbour, where each vessel on its way downstream put in for the
purpose of hiring a pilot.^ The monarchs of the XIP' and dynasties
had raised fortifications at the approaches to Wady Haifa, and their engineers
skilfully chose the sites so as completely to protect from the ravages of the

Inscriptions of the year III., at Sehel and at Assuan, have been published by Wilboue, Canalizing the Cataract, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xiii. p. 202, and by J. de Moegan, De la Frontiere de Nuhie a Kom-Ombos, p. 41, No. 185, and p. 85, Nos. 13, 10.

Piehl, Petites Etudes hi^roglyphiques, pp. 3,4, 24, 25). Quarries of considerable size, where Cailliaud imagined he could distinguish an overturned colossus, show the importance which the establishment had attained in ancient times (Cailliaud, Voyage a MCro^, vol. iv. pp. 233-235) ; the ruins of the town cover a fairly large area near the modern village of Kerman (Lepsius, Briefe aus jEgypten und Mlhiopien, pp. 253, 254).

Henceforward the garrison at Tombos was able to defend the mighty curve
described by the river through the desert of Mahas, together with the island of
ArgOj and the confines of Dongola. The distance between Thebes and this
southern frontier was a long one, and communication was slow during the winter
months, when the subsidence of the waters had rendered the task of navigation
difficult for the Egyptian ships. The king was obliged, besides, to concentrate
his attention mainly on Asiatic affairs, and was no longer able to watch the
movements of the African races with the same vigilance as his predecessors
had exercised before Egyptian armies had made their way as far as the banks
of the Euphrates. Thutmosis placed the control of the countries south of
Assuan in the hands of a viceroy, who, invested with the august title of “ Eoyal
Son of Kush,” must have been regarded as having the blood of Ea himself
running in his veins.^ Sura, the first of these viceroys whose name has
reached us, was in office at the beginning of the campaign of the year
He belonged, it would seem, to a Theban family, and for several centuries
afterwards his successors are mentioned among the nobles who were in the habit
of attending the court. Their powers were considerable : they commanded
armies, built or restored temples, administered justice, and received the homage
of loyal sheikhs or the submission of rebellious ones.^ The period for which
they were appointed was not fixed by law, and they held office simply at the
king’s pleasure.^ During the XIX*'' dynasty it was usual to confer this office,
the highest in the state, on a son of the sovereign, preferably the heir-apparent.
Occasionally his appointment was purely formal, and he continued in attendance
on his father, while a trusty substitute ruled in his place : often, however, he
took the government on himself, and in the regions of the Upper Nile served
an apprenticeship to the art of ruling. This district was in a perpetual state
of war—a war without danger, but full of trickery and surprises : here he
prepared himself for the larger arena of the Syrian campaigns, learning the arts
‘ The meaning of this title was at first misunderstood. Champollion (Lettres tfcrites d’Egypte, 2Dd edit., p. 160) and Eosellini (Monumenti Storici, vol. iii. pt. 1, pp. 259, 260) took it literally, and tliought it referred to Ethiopian princes, who were vassals or enemies of Egypt. Birch persists in regarding them as Ethiopians driven out by their subjects, restored by the Pharaohs as viceroys, while admitting that they may have belonged to the solar family (Abundale-Bonomi-Bikch, Gallery of Antiquities selected from the British Museum, pp. 94, 95, 110). ^ He is mentioned in the Sehel inscription as “the royal son Sura” (Wilbotjr, Canalizing the Cataract, in the Eecueil de Travaux, vol. xiii. p. 202). Nahi, who had been regarded as the first holder of the ofiice (Birch, Upon a Historical Tablet of Ramses II., p. 20 ; Brugsch, Geogr. Ins., vol. i. p. 53, and Geschichte JEgyptens, p. 265), and who was still in ofiice under Thiitmosis III., had been appointed by Thutmosis 1. (Lepsics, Denltm., iii. 47 c, 1. 6), but after iSura. “ Under Thutmosis III., tlie viceroy Nahi restored the temple at Semneh (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 47 a, c, 56 a); under Tutankhamen, the viceroy Hui received tribute from the Ethiopian princes, and presented them to tire sovereign (Lepsids, Denkm., iii. 117, 118).

of generalship more perfectly than was possible in the manoeuvres of the
parade-ground. Moreover, the appointment was dictated by religious as well
as by political considerations. The presumptive heir to the throne was to his
father what Horus had been to Osiris—his lawful successor, or, if need be, his
avenger, should some act of treason impose on him the duty of vengeance : and
was it not in Ethiopia that Horus had gained his first victories over Typhon ?
A CITY OP MODERN NDBIA—THE ANCIENT DONGOLA.*
To begin like Horus, and flesh his maiden steel on the descendants of the
accomplices of Sit, was, in the case of the future sovereign, equivalent to affirm
ing from the outset the reality of his divine extraction.^
As at the commencement of the Theban dynasties, it was the river valley
only in these regions of the Upper Hile w'hich belonged to the Pharaohs.
From this time onward it gave support to an Egyptian population as far
as the juncture of the two Niles : it was a second Egypt, but a poorer one,
whose cities presented the same impoverished appearance as that which we
find to-day in the towns of Nubia. The tribes scattered right and left in the
desert, or distributed beyond the confluence of the two Niles among the plains
of Sennar, were descended from the old indigenous races, and paid valuable
tribute every year in precious metals, ivory, timber, or the natural products of

had passed far beyond the boundaries reached in early campaigns, and had
brought the Egyptians into contact with nations, with whom they had
been in only indirect commercial relations in former times. Some of these

bright colours, even in those early times, being betrayed by the red or

waved from the top of the head or were fastened on one side to the fillet
confining the hair, which was arranged in short curls and locks, stiffened
with gum and matted with grease, so as to form a sort of cap or grotesque
aureole round the skull. The men delighted to load themselves with rings,
bracelets, earrings, and necklaces, while from their arms, necks, and belts
hung long strings of glass beads, which jingled with every movement of the

nearly naked, having merely a loin-oloth of some woven stuff or an animal’s
skin thrown round their hips. Their heads were either shaven, or adorned with
tufts of hair stiffened with gum.’^ The children of both sexes wore no clothes
until the age of puberty ; the women wrapped themselves in a rude garment
or in a covering of linen, and carried their children on the hip or in a basket
of esparto grass on the back, supported by a leather band which passed across
the forehead.^ One characteristic of all these tribes was their love of singing
and dancing, and their use of the drum and cymbals ; they were active and
industrious, and carefully cultivated the rich soil of the plain, devoting them
selves to the raising of cattle, particularly of oxen, whose horns they were
accustomed to train fantastically into the shapes of lyres, bows, and spirals, with
bifurcations at the ends, or with small human figures as terminations. As in the
case of other negro tribes, they plied the blacksmith’s and also the goldsmith’s
trade, working up both gold and silver into rings, chains, and quaintly shaped
vases, some specimens of their art being little else than toys, similar in design
to those which delighted the Byzantine Ctesars of later date. A wall-painting
remains of a gold epergne, which represents men and monkeys engaged in
gathering the fruit of a group of dom-palms. Two individuals lead each a tame
giraffe by the halter, others kneeling on the rim raise their hands to implore
mercy from an unseen enemy, while negro prisoners, grovelling on their stomachs,
painfully attempt to raise their head and shoulders from the ground. This,
doubtless, represents a scene from the everyday life of the people of the Upper
Nile, and gives a faithful picture of what took place among many of its tribes
during a rapid inroad of some viceroy of Kush or a raid by his lieutenants.^
The resources which Thutmosis I. was able to draw regularly from these
southern regions, in addition to the wealth collected during bis Syrian cam
paign, enabled him to give a great impulse to building work. The tutelary deity
of his capital— Amou-Ra—who had ensured him the victory in all his battles,
had a prior claim on the bulk of the spoil ; he received it as a matter of course,
and his temple at Thebes was thereby considerably enlarged ;
^ we are not,
however, able to estimate exactly what proportion fell to other cities, such as
the Egyptian, the Ethiopian empire was governed by a succession of queens, the Candaces of classical historians (Wiedemann, L’ Ethiopie au temps de Tibere, p. 10). ‘ Boueiant, Le Tnmheau d’ Harinhabi, pi. iv. ; Scheil, Tombeau de Mai, in the M^moires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. v. p. 551, where different examples of this mode of dressing the hair are shown. ^ See the processions of negro tributaries or captives in Chamcollion, Monuments de I’Egypte et de la Nuhie, pis. xvi. and xvi. 5fs, xxxv., Ixx., clviii., clxxvi. 3; Virey, Le Tombeau de Be]chmard,pl.vm., and Boceiant, Le Tombeau d’ Harmliabi, pi. iv.

indeed, a curious one ; although defacto absolute in power, his children by Queen
Ahmasi took precedence of him, for by her mother’s descent she had a better
right to the crown than her husband,'^ and legally the king should have retired

year of the latter’s reign, and he also held a military command in the Delta,

succeed him. The mother
of this prince was a certain

rank in the royal family that

her son from being recog
nised as heir-apparent, hence
the occupation of the “ seat

more to a woman, Hatshop
situ, the eldest daughter of
Ahmasi. Hatshopsitu her
self was not, however, of
purely divine descent. Her
maternal ancestor, Sonisonbu,
had not been a scion of the
royal house, and this haw in her pedigree threatened to mar, in her case, the
sanctity of the solar blood. According to Egyptian belief, this defect of
birth could only be remedied by a miracle,^ and the ancestral god, becoming

incarnate in the earthly father at the moment of conception, had to condescend
to infuse fresh virtue into his race in this manner. The inscriptions with which
Hatshopsitu decorated her chapel relate how, on that fateful night, Amon
descended upon Ahmasi in a flood of per
fume and light. The queen received him
favourably, and the divine spouse on leaving
her announced to her the approaching birth
of a daughter, in whom his valour and
strength should be manifested once more
here below. The sequel of the story is dis
played in a series of pictures before our
eyes. The protecting divinities who preside
over the birth of children conduct the queen
to her couch, and the sorrowful resignation
depicted on her face, together with the
languid grace of her whole figure, display in
this portrait of her a finished work of art.
The child enters the world amid shouts of
joy, and the propitious genii who nourish
both her and her double constitute them
selves her nurses. At the appointed time,
her earthly father summons the great nobles
to a solemn festival, and presents to
them his daughter, who is to reign with
him over Egypt and the world.^ From
henceforth Hatshopsitu adopts every
possible device to conceal her real sex.
She changes the termiaation of her name, and calls herself Hatshopsiu, the chief
of the nobles, in lieu of Hatshopsitu, the chief of the favourites.® She becomes
the King Makeri, and on the occasion of all public ceremonies she appears in
male costume. We see her represented on the Theban monuments with

two other sovereigns, viz. Amenothes III., whose father, Thutmosis IV., was born under conditions analogous to those attending the birth of Thutmosis I. ; and Ptolemy Cmsarion, whose father, Julius Csesar, was not of Egyptian blood. > These sculptures were brought to light by Xaville, The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, Introductory
Memoir, p. 15. The association of Hatshopsith with her father on the throne, first suggested by E. de
Eouge (^Etude des monuments de Karnak, in the Melanges d’ Arcli^ologie, etc., pp. 46—48), has now been
placed beyond doubt by the inscriptions discovered and commented on by Naville in 1895 (Trois Inscriptions de la Seine Hatsliepsou, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xviii. pp. 91-99).

keflieh, while the diadem rests
on her closely cut hair, and
the false beard depends from
her chin. She retained, how
ever, the feminine pronoun in
speaking of herself, and also
an epithet, inserted in her
cartouche, which declared
her to be the betrothed of
Amon — TilinumU Amaunu.'^
Her father united her while
still young to her brother
Thutmosis, who appears to
have been her junior, and
this fact doubtless explains
the very subordinate part
which he plays beside the
queen. When Thutmosis I.
died, Egyptian etiquette de
manded that a man should
be at the head of affairs, and this youth succeeded his father in office : but
Hatshopsitu, while relinquishing the semblance of power and the externals of
pomp to her husband,^ kept the direction of the state entirely in her own hands.
' Cf. Xaville, The Temple of Deir el-Baliari, Introductory Memoir, p. 15, et seq. We know how greatly puzzled the early Egyptologists were by this manner of depicting the queen, and how Chanipollion, in striving to explain the monuments of the period, was driven fo suggest the existence of a regent, Amenenthes, the male counterpart and husband of Hatshopsitu (Champollion, Lettres Sorites d’Eijypte, 2nd edit., pp. 293-298), whose name he read Amense. This hypothesis, adopted by Rosellini (Monumenti Storici, vol. i. pp. 220-230, and vol. iii. pt. 1, p. 129, et seq.) with some slight modifications, was rejected by Birch. This latter writer pointed out (he identity of the two personages separated by Champollion, and proved them to be one and the same queen, the Amenses of Manetho ; he called her Amiin-num-ho ( Akundale-Bonojii-Birch, Gallery of Antiquities selected from the British Museum, pp. 77-79), but he made her out to be a sister of Amenothes I., associated on the ihrouewith her brothers Thutmosis I. and Thi'itmosis II., and regent at the beginning of the reign of Thutmosis III. Hincks tried to show that she was the daughter of Thutmosis I., the wife of Thutmosis II. and the sister of Thutmosis III. (On the Years and Cycles used by the Ancient Egyptians, in the Memoirs of the Dublin Academy, vol. xviii. pt. 2, p. 192, et seq., and On the Defacement of Divine and Boy al Names, pp. 3-5; cf. Birch, On the Obelisk on the Atmeidan at Constantinople, p. 4) ; it is only quite I’ecently that her true descent and place in the family tree has been recognised. She was, not the sister, but the aunt of Thutmosis III. (Maspeuo, Notes au jour lejour, § 16, in the Proceedings of the Soc. of Bibl. Arch.,
1892, vol. xiv. pp. 170-182). The queen, called by Birch Amun-num-het, the latter part of her name being dropped and the royal prenomen being joined to her own name, was subsequently styled Ha-asfi or Hatasu, and this form is still adopted by some writers; the true reading is Hatshopsitu or Hatshepsitu, then Hatshopsiu or Hiltshepsiu, as Naville has pointed out.

The portraits of her which have been preserved
represent her as having refined features, with
a proud and energetic expression. The oval
of the face is elongated, the cheeks a little
hollow, and the eyes deep set under the
arch of the brow, while the lips are thin
and tightly closed. She governed with
so firm a hand that neither Egypt nor

from her authority. One raid, in which
several prisoners were taken, punished a
rising of the Shausu in Central Syria,
while the usual expeditions maintained
order among the peoples of Ethiopia,
and quenched any attempt which they
might make to revolt. When in the
second year of his reign the news was
brought to Thutmosis II. that the in
habitants of the Upper Nile had ceased to
observe the conditions which his father had imposed upon them, he “ became
furious as a panther,” and assembling his troops set out for war without
further delay. The presence of the king with the army filled the rebels with

It appears to me more probable that Thutmosis I. married her to her brother after she had heen raised to the throne, with a view to avoiding complications which miglit have arisen in the royal family after liis own death. The inscription at Slmtt-er-Ragel (Eisenlohr, Au Historical Monument, in the Proceedings of the Soc. of Bibl. Arch., 1880-81, p. 101 ; FniNnEES Petrie, A Season in Egypt, 1887, pi. xv.. No. 476, and p. 15), which has furnished Mariette with the hypothesis that Thutmosis I. and Tliutmosis II. reigned simultaneously (Deir el-Bahari, Text, p. 37), proves that the person mentioned in it, a certain Penaiti, flourished under both these Pharaohs, but hy no means shows that tliese two reigned together; he exercised the functions wliich he held hy their authority during their successive reigns.

period in ruins, and their tombs almost all lay buried under the waves of sand

This site was seized on by the architects of Thutmosis, who laid there the
foundations of a building which was destined to be unique in the world. Its

buildings destined for purposes connected with the daily worship of the

Mariette, struck by the strange appearance of the edifice, thought that it betrayed a foreign influence, and supposed that Queen Hatshopsitfl had constructed it on the model of some buildings seen by her oliicers in the land of Puanit {Heir el-Bahari, pp. 10, 11). It is, however, a purely Egyptian structure of the Hemi-Speos kind. * The English nomenclature employed in describing this temple is that used in the Guide to Heir

Both E. de Eouge (^Etude des Mon. du Massif de Karnak, in the MAanges d’Archeologie Egyptienne, vol. i. pp. 48, 49) and Mariette {Deir el-Bahari, p. 35) were opposed to the view that the temple was founded by Thutmosis I., and Naville agrees with them {The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, pp. 16, 17). Judging from tlie many new texts discovered by Naville, I am inclined to think that Thhtmosis I. began the structure, but from plans, it would appear, which had not been so fully developed as they afterwards became. From indications to be found here and there in the inscriptions of the Eamesside period, I am not, moreover, inclined to regard Deir el-Bahari as the funerary chapel of tombs which were situated in some unknown place elsewhere (Mariette, Deir el-Bahari, pjr. 2, 3; Naville, The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, pp. 6-8), but I believe that it included the burial-places of Thutmosis I., Thhtmosis II., Queen Hatshopsitu, and of numerous representatives of their family ; indeed, it is probable that Thutmosis III. and his children found here also their last resting-place. ® The coffin of Thutmosis I. was usurped by the priest-king Pinozmh I., son of Pionkhi (Maspeeo, Les Momies royales, in the M^m. de la Mission Fran^aise, vol. i. p. 545), and the mummy was lost. I fancy I have discovered it in mummy No. 5283, of which the head presents a striking resemblance to those of Thutmosis 11. and III. (Id., ibid., pp. 581, 582), a fact which may be established by comparing the illustration given above with those on pages 243 and 290. ^ The latest year up to the present known of this king is the IP"’, found upon the AswS.n stele (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 16 a). Erman {lEgypten, p. 71), followed by Ed. Meyer {Geschiehte A^gyptens, pp. 232, 238), thinks that Hatshopsitu could not have been free from complicity in the premature death of Thutmosis II. ; but I am inclined to believe, from the marks of disease found on the skin of his mummy, that the queen was innocent of the crime here ascribed to her (cf. Wiedebiann, Mgyptische Geschiehte, Supplement, p. 38). * Drawn by Buudier, from a photograph taken by Emil Brugseh-Bey in 1881 ; cf.

had scarcely reached the age of thirty when
he fell a victim to a disease of which the
process of embalming could not remove
the traces. The skin is scabrous in patches,
and covered with scars, while the upper
part of the skull is bald ; the body is thin
and somewhat shrunken, and appears to
have lacked vigour and muscular power.^
By his marriage with his sister, Thut
mosis left daughters only,^ but he had one
son, also a Thutmosis, by a woman of low birth,
perhaps merely a slave, whose name was Isis.^
Hatshopsitu proclaimed this child her successor, fur
his youth and humble parentage could not excite her
jealousy. She betrothed him to her one surviving
daughter, Hatshopsitu II.,^ and having thus settled the succession in the male
line, she continued to rule alone in the name of her nephew who was still
a minor, as she had done formerly in the case of her half-brother.
Her reign was a prosperous one, but whether the flourishing condition of
things was owing to the ability of her political administration or to her fortunate
choice of ministers, we are unable to tell. She pressed forward the work of
building with great activity, under the direction of her architect Sanmut,® not
only at Deir el-Bahari, but at Karnak, and indeed everywhere in Thebes. The

plans of the building had been arranged under Thutmosis I., and their
execution had been carried out so quickly, that in many cases the queen
had merely to see to the sculptural ornamentation on the all but com
pleted walls. This work, however, afforded her sufficient excuse, according
to Egyptian custom, to attribute the whole structure to herself, and the
opinion she had of her own powers is exhibited with great naiveness

ler actions long beforehand, and as never venturing on
he smallest undertaking without reference to her divine
father. “ This is what I teach to mortals who shall live
in centuries to come, and whose hearts shall inquire
concerning the monument which I have raised to my
father, speaking and exclaiming as they contemplate it

him two obelisks of electrum, whose apices should pierce
the firmaments, before the noble gateway which is be

who shall see my monuments in after-years and who shall
speak of my great deeds : Beware of saying, ‘ I know not,
I know not why it was resolved to carve this mountain

makes seven months from the day when they began to quarry it.” ^ One of these
two monoliths is still standing among the ruins of Karnak, and the grace of its
outline, the finish of its hieroglyphics, and the beauty of the figures which
cover it, amply justify the pride which the queen and her brother felt in con
templating it. The tops of the pyramids were gilt, so that “they could be seen

on, in the VIF' or VIIL*' year of the queen’s reign, Amon enjoined a work
which was more difficult to carry out.^ On a day
when Hatshopsitu had gone to the temple to
offer prayers, “ her supplications arose up
before the throne of the Lord ot Karnak,
and a command was heard in the sanc
tuary, a behest of the god himself, that
the ways which lead to Puanit should be ex

of Incense ’ should be trodden.” ^ The
aromatic gums required for the temple
service had hitherto reached the Theban
priests solely by means of foreign inter
mediaries ; so that in the slow transport
across Africa they lost much of their
freshness, besides being defiled by pass
ing through impure hands. In addition
to these drawbacks, the merchants con
founded under the one term “Aniti” sub

in value and character, several of them,
indeed, scarcely coming under the cate

was accounted a pious work to send

procure the plants themselves for ac

regent of the gods, that the aromatic gum may be gathered at will, that the
vessels may be laden joyfully with living incense trees and with all the products
of this earth.” ^ Hatshopsitu chose out five well-built galleys, and manned them
with picked crews. She caused them to be laden with such merchandise as would
be most attractive to the barbarians, and placing the vessels under the command
of a royal envoy, she sent them forth on the Eed Sea in quest of the incense.^
We are not acquainted with the name of the port from which the fieet set
sail, nor do we know the number of weeks it took to reach the land of Puanit,
neither is there any record of the incidents which befell it by the way.
It sailed past the places frequented by the mariners of the dynasty
Suakin, Massowah, and the islands of the Eed Sea ; it touched at the country
of the Him which lay to the west of the Bab el-Mandeb, went safely through the
Straits, and landed at last in the Land of Perfumes on the Somali coast.^ There,
between the bay of Zeilah and Eas Hafun, stretched the Barbaric region,
frequented in later times by the merchants of Myos Hormos and of Berenice.
The first stations which the latter encountered beyond Cape Direh—Avails,
Malao, Mundos, and Mosylon—were merely open roadsteads offering no secure

Maspeeo, Le Papyrus de Berlin, No. I., in the Mdanges d’Arch^ologie Egyptienne, vol. iii. p. 160. “ It was for some time believed that the five vessels portrayed were merely representative of a more numerous fleet (Beugsch, Geseh. ^gyptens, p. 281); the proofthat they formed the entire squadron is given in Maspeeo, De quslques Navigations des Egyptiens, p. 11, No. 1. ’ That part of Puanit where the Egyptians landed was at first located in Arabia by Brugsch (Geogr. Insch., vol. ii. p. 14, and iii. pp. 63, 64), then transferred to Somali-land by Mariette {Les Listes g^og. des Pyldnes de Karnalc, pp. 60-66, and Deir el-Bahari, pp. 26-35), whose opinion was accepted by most Egyptologists (Beugsch, Gesch. AUgyptens, pp. 281, 282 ; Maspeeo, De quelqices Navigations des Egyptiens, pp. 5, 6). Diimichen, basing his hypothesis on a passage where Puanit is mentioned as “ being on both sides of the sea ” (Maeiette, Deir el-Bahari, pi. 5, 2nd reg.), desired to apply the name to the Arabian as well as to the African coast, to Yemen and Hadhramaut as well as to Somaliland (Gesch. des Alien AJgyptens, pp. 119-122) ; this suggestion was adopted by Lieblein (Handel und Schifffahrt, etc., p. 52, et seq.), and subsequently by Ed. Meyer, who believed that its inhabitants were the ancestors of the Sabseans (Gesch. des Alien Mgyptens, p. 234). Since then Krall has endeavoured to shorten the distance between this country and Egypt, and he places the Puanit of Hatshopsith between Suakin and Massowah (Studien zur Gesch. des Alien AEgyp., IV. Das Land Punt, pp. 21, 22). This was, indeed, the part of the country known under the XIP‘* dynasty (cf. Dawn of Civilization, pp. 495, 496) at the time when it was believed that the Nile emptied itself thereabouts into the Eed Sea, in the vicinity of the Island of the Serpent King (Maspeeo, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d’Hist., § v., in the Bee. de Travaux, vol. xvii. pp. 76-78), but I hold, with Mariette,
that the Puanit where the Egyptians of Hatshopsith’s time landed is the present Somali-land—a view which is also shared by Naville (The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, pp. 21, 22, and Egypt Expl. Fund, Archseological Beport, 1894-95, p. 34), but which Brugsch, in the latter years of his life, abandoned (ScHWEiNPUETH, Uber seine Beise nach dem gliicklichen Arabia, pi. 5, et seq., from the Verhandl. der Gesell. fur Erdhunde zu Berlin, 1889, No. 7). * For the roadsteads of Malao, Mundos, and Mosylon, cf. the information furnished in the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, §§ 8, 9, 10, in Mullee-Didot, Geographi Grasci Minores, vol. i. pp. 264, 265.

she alighted in order to gain a closer view of the strangers. She was endowed
with a type of beauty much admired by the people of Central Africa, being so

After an exchange of compliments, the more serious business of the expedition
was introduced. The Egyptians pitched a tent, in which they placed the objects
of barter with which they were jjrovided, and to prevent these from being too
great a temptation to the
natives, they surrounded
the tent with a line of
troops. The main con
ditions of the exchange
were arranged at a ban
quet, in which they spread
before the barbarians a
sumptuous display of
Egyptian delicacies, con
sisting of bread, beer,
wine, meat, and carefully
prepared and flavoured
vegetables.^ Payment for
every object was to be
made at the actual moment
of purchase. For several days there was a constant stream of people, and asses
groaned beneath their burdens. The Egyptian purchases comprised the most
varied objects: ivory tusks, gold, ebony, cassia, myrrh, cynocephali and green
monkeys, greyhounds, leopard skins, large oxen, slaves, and last, but not least,
thirty-one incense trees, with their roots surrounded by a ball of earth and placed
in large baskets. The lading of the ships was a long and tedious affair. All
available space being at length exhausted, and as much cargo placed on
board as was compatible with the navigation of the vessel, the squadron
set sail and with all speed took its way northwards.^
The Egyptians touched at several places on the coast on their return journey,
making friendly alliances with the inhabitants; the Him added a quota to their
freight, for which room was with difficulty found on board,—it consisted not
only of the inevitable gold, ivory, and skins, but also of live leopards and a
giraffe, together with plants and fruits unknown on the banks of the Nile.^

focal sheikhs, as pledges to the Pharaoh of good will or as commercial hostages.
National vanity, no doubt, prompted the Egyptians to regard them as vassals
coming to do homage, and their gifts as tributes denoting subjection. The
Queen inaugurated a solemn festival in honour of the explorers. The Theban
militia was ordered out to meet them, the royal flotilla escorting them as far as
the temple landing-place, where a procession was formed to carry the spoil to
the feet of the god. The good Theban folk, assembled to witness their arrival,
beheld the march past of the native hostages, the incense sycamores, the
precious gum itself, the wild animals, the giraffe, and the oxen, whose numbers
were doubtless increased a hundredfold in the accounts given to posterity with
the usual official exaggeration.® The trees were planted at Deir el-Bahari,

{GescMcUe des Alien ^gypiens, pp. 236, 237). The completed text proves that there was but a
single expedition, and that the explorers of Puanit visited the Him also. The chiefs and their tributes are represented in Ddmichen, Hist. Inscliriften, vol. ii. pis. xiv., xvii., as well as in Maeiette,

Hatshopsitu commanded the history of the expedition to be carved on the wall
of the colonnades which lay on the west side of the middle platform of her
funerary chapel : we there see the little fleet with sails spread, winging its way
to the unknown country, its safe arrival at its destination, the meeting with
the natives, the animated palavering, the consent to exchange freely accorded ;
and thanks to the minuteness with which the smallest details have been
portrayed, we can as it were witness, as if on the spot, all the phases of life
on board ship, not only on Egyptian vessels, but, as we may infer, those of other
Oriental nations generally. Eor we may be tolerably sure that when the Phoeni
cians ventured into the distant parts of the Mediterranean, it was after a
similar fashion that they managed and armed their vessels. Although the
natural features of the Asiatic or Greek coast on which they effected a landing
differed widely from those of Puanit, the Phoenician navigators were themselves
provided with similar objects of exchange, and in their commercial dealings
with the natives the methods of procedure of the European traders were
doubtless similar to those of the Egyptians with the barbarians of the Eed
Sea.^
Hatshopsitu reigned for at least eight years after this memorable expedition
and traces of her further activity are to be observed in every part of the Nile
valley. She even turned her attention to the Delta, and began the task of

liere than in any other part of Egypt. The canals were silted up with mud,
the marshes and the desert had encroached on the cultivated lands, the towns
had become impoverished, and there were some provinces whose population
consisted solely of shepherds and bandits. Hatshopsitu desired to remedy these
evils, if only for the purpose of providing a practicable road for her armies
marching to Zalu en route for Syria.^ She also turned her attention to
the mines of Sinai, which had not been worked by the Egyptian kings
since the end of the XII“^ dynasty. In the year XVI. an officer of the queen’s
household was despatched to the Wady Magharah, the site of the ancient works,
with orders to inspect the valleys, examine the veins, and restore there the

It seems to me tliat the queen is simply boasting that she had repaired the monuments which had been injured by the Shepherds during the time they sojourned in Egypt, in the land of Avaris. Up to the present time no trace of these restorations has been found on the sites.

bringing with him a consignment of those blue and green stones which were
so highly esteemed by the Egyptians.^
Meanwhile, Thutmosis III. was approaching manhood, and his aunt, the
queen, instead of abdicating in his favour, associated him with herself more
frequently in the external acts of government.^ She was forced to yield him
precedence in those religious ceremonies which could be performed by a man
only, such as the dedication of one of the city gates of Ombos, and the foundation
and marking out of a temple at Medinet-Habu ; ® but for the most part she obliged
him to remain in the background and take a secondary place beside her. We
are unable to determine the precise moment when this dual sovereignty came
to an end. It was still existent in the XVI*’' year of the reign, but it had
ceased before the year.^ Death alone could take the sceptre from the
hands that held it, and Thutmosis had to curb his impatience for many a long
day before becoming the real master of Egypt.® He was about twenty-five years
of age when this event took place, and he immediately revenged himself for
the long repression he had undergone, by endeavouring to destroy the very
remembrance of her whom he regarded as a usurper. Every portrait of her
that he could deface without exposing himself to being accused of sacrilege was
cut away, and he substituted for her name either that of Thutmosis I. or of
Thutmosis II.® A complete political change was effected both at home and
abroad from the first day of his accession to power. Hatshopsitu had been
averse to war. During the whole of her reign there had not been a single cam
paign undertaken beyond the isthmus of Suez, and by the end of her life she
had lost nearly all that her father had gained in Syria ; the people of Kharu had

Brugsch accepted as actual history a poetical passage where the king identifies himself with Horus, son of Isis, and goes so far as to attribute to himself the adventures of the god (Maspero, in the Revue Critique, 1880, vol. i. p. 107, n. 1, and Notes sur diffArents points de Grammaire, § xxviii., in the Zeitschrift, 1882, p. 133 ; Nayille, The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, p. 27). “ Dedication of the gate of Ombos by Thutmosis III. and by his queen, in Champollion, Mon. de I’Egypte, etc., vol. i. pp. 231, 232, and in 'RosELi.m J, Monument i del Culto, pi. xxviii. and pp. 196-198 scenes in the dedication of the little temple of Medinet-Habfi, in Champollion, Mon. de I’Egypte, etc., pi. cxcv., and in Lepsids, Denkm., iii. 38 a, h. * Stele from Sinai, engraved in the XVI*'‘ year of her joint reign with Thutmosis III.

sovereign is the year XXL (Lepsids, Denkm., iii. 30 a, 1. 20). ^ Erman (AUgypten und Mgyptisches Lehen, p. 72) and Ed.

Brugsch, Ges'^hichte Ahjyptens, p. 289 ; Wiedemann, AUgyptische Geschielite, p. 334). There is nothing in the passage cited but the mention of the usual annual dues paid by the chiefs of Puanit and of the Him (Lieblein, Schifffahrt und Handel, p. 30; Ed. Meyer, Geschidite des Alien AUgyptens, p. 232, n. 4). ^ This is at least what may be inferred from the account of the campaign, where the Prince of Qodshh, a town of the Amahru (Amorites), figures at the head of the coalition formed against Thhtraosis III. (Maspero, Le Edcit de la Campagne contre Mageddo, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. ii. pp. 51, 52). ’ This is the conclusion to be adopted from the beginning of the inscription of Thutmosis III. “ Now, during the duration of these same years, the country of the Lotanh was in discord until other times succeeded them, when the people who were in the town of Sharuhana, from the town of Yurza, to the most distant regions of the earth, succeeded in making a revolt against his Majesty ” (Maspero, Rfyit de la campagne, etc., in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. ii. pp. 49, 50). * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Petrie ; cf.

month of Pakhons, in time to keep the anniversary of his coronation in that
town, and to inaugurate tlie 24th year of his reign by festivals in honour
of his father Amend They lasted the usual length of time, and all the
departments of State took part in them, but it was not a propitious moment
for lengthy ceremonies. The king left Gaza the following day, the 5th of
Pakhons ; he marched but slowly at first, following the usual caravan route, and
despatching troops right and left to levy contributions on the cities of the Plain
-—Migdol, Yapu (Jaffa), Lotanu, Ono—and those within reach on the mountain
spurs, or situated within the easily accessible wadys, such as Sauka (Socho),
Hadid, and Haiilud On the 16th day he had not proceeded further than Yahmu,
where he received information which caused him to push quickly forward. The
lord of Qodshu had formed an alliance with the Syrian princes on the borders
of Naharaim, and had extorted from them promises of help ; he had already
gone so far as to summon contingents from the Upper Orontes, the Litany,
and the Upper Jordan, and was concentrating them at Megiddo, where he
proposed to stop the way of the invading army. Thutmosis called together his
principal officers, and having imparted the news to them, took counsel with them
as to a plan of attack. Three alternative routes were open to him. The most
direct approached the enemy’s position on the front, crossing Mount Carmel by
the saddle now known as the Umm el-Fahm ; but the great drawback attached to
this route was its being so restricted that the troops would be forced to advance
in too thin a file ; and the head of the column would reach the plain and come
into actual conflict with the enemy while the rear-guard would only be entering
the defiles in the neighbourhood of Aluna. The second route bore a little to
the east, crossing the mountains beyond Dutina and reaching the plain near
Taanach ; but it offered the same disadvantages as the other. The third road
ran north of Zafiti, to meet the great highway which cuts the hill-district of
Nablus, skirting the foot of Tabor near Jenin, a little to the north of Megiddo.
It was not so direct as the other two, but it was easier for troops, and the king’s

THE BATTLE OF MEOIDDO. 257
generals advised that it should be followed. The king was so incensed that he
was tempted to attribute their prudence to cowardice. “ By my life ! by the
love that Ea hath for me, by the favour that I enjoy from my master Amon, by
the perpetual youth of my nostril in life and power, My Majesty will go by the
way of Aluna, and let him that will go by the roads of which ye have spoken,
and let him that will follow My Majesty. What will be said among the
vile enemies detested of Ea ; ‘ Doth not His Majesty go by another way ?
For fear of us he gives us a wide berth,’ they will cry.” The king’s coun
sellors did not insist further. “May thy father Amon of Thebes protect
thee ! ” they exclaimed ; “ as for us, we will follow Thy Majesty whither
soever thou goest, as it befitteth a servant to follow his master.” The word
of command was given to the men ; Thutmosis himself led the vanguard,
and the whole army, horsemen and foot-soldiers, followed in single file,
wending their way through the thickets which covered the southern slopes
of Mount Carmel.^
They pitched their camp on the evening of the 19th near Aluna, and on
the morning of the 20th they entered the wild defiles through which it was
necessary to pass in order to reach the enemy. The king had taken pre
cautionary measures against any possible attempt of the natives to cut the main
column during this crossing of the mountains. His position might at any
moment have become a critical one, had the allies taken advantage of it and
attacked each battalion as it issued on to the plain before it could re-form. But
the Prince of Qodshu, either from ignorance of his adversary’s movements, or
confident of victory in the open, declined to take the initiative. Towards one
o’clock in the afternoon, the Egyptians found themselves once more united on
the further side of the range, close to a torrent called the Qina, a little to the
south of Megiddo. When the camp was pitched, Thutmosis announced his
intention of engaging the enemy on the morrow. A council of war was held to
decide on the position that each corps should occupy, after which the officers
returned to their men to see that a liberal supply of rations was served out, and to
organise an efficient system of patrols. They passed round the camp to the cry ;
’ The position of the towns mentioned and of the three roads has been ditcnssed by E. de Ronge' {Etude sur divers monuments de Thoutmes III., pp. 37-39), also by F. de Saulcy {Lettre a M. Chahas sur quelques points de la G^ograpliie antique de la Syrie, etc., in the Hglanges d’ Archiologie Egyptienne, vol. i. pp. 120-127), who fixed the position of Yahnm at El-Kheimeh, and showed that the Egyptian army must have passed through the defiles of TJmm el-Fahm. Conder disagreed with this opinion in certain respects, and identified Aluna, Aruna, at first with Arrabeh, and afterwards with Arraneh he thought that Thutmosis came out upon Megiddo from the south-east, and he placed Megiddo at Mejeddah, near Beisan {Palestine before Joshua, in the Quarterly Statements, 1876, pp. 90, 91, and Megiddo, ibid., 1877, pp. 13-20), while Tomkins placed Aruna in the Wady el-Arrian {The Karnak Tribute-Lists of Thotmes III., in the Proceedings Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1877, vol. ix. pp. 162-164, and Transactions, vol. ix. pp. 261, 262). W. Max Miiller seems to place Yahmu too much to the north, in the neighbourhood of Jett {Asien und Europa, pp, 157-160).



258 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
‘‘ Keep a good heart : courage ! Watch well, w-atch well ! Keep alive iu the
camp ! ” The king refused to retire to rest until he had been assured that “ the
country was quiet, and also the host, both to south and north.” By dawn the
next day the whole army was in motion. It was formed into a single line,
the right wing protected by the torrent, the left extended into the plain, stretch
ing beyond Megiddo towards the north-west. Thutmosis and his guards occupied
the centre, standing “ armed in his chariot of electrum like unto Horus bran
dishing his pike, and like Month the Theban god.” The Syrians, who had not
expected such an early attack, were seized with panic, and fled in the direction
of the town, leaving their horses and chariots on the field ; but the citizens,
fearing lest in the confusion the Egyptians should effect an entrance with
the fugitives, had closed their gates and refused to open them. Some of the
townspeople, however, let down ropes to the leaders of the allied party, and drew
them up to the top of the ramparts : “ and would to heaven that the soldiers of
His Majesty had not so far forgotten themselves as to gather up the spoil left
by the vile enemy ! They would then have entered Megiddo forthwith ; for
while the men of the garrison were drawing up the Lord of Qodshu and their
own prince, the fear of His Majesty was upon their limbs, and their hands failed
them by reason of the carnage which the royal uraeus carried into their ranks.”
The victorious soldiery were dispersed over the fields, gathering together the
gilded and silvered chariots of the Syrian chiefs, collecting the scattered weapons
and the bands of the slain, and securing the prisoners; then rallying about the
king, they greeted him with acclamations and filed past to deliver up the spoil.
He reproached them for having allowed themselves to be drawn away from the
heat of pursuit. “ Had you carried Megiddo, it would have been a favour
granted to me by Ea my father this day ; for all tlie kings of the country being
shut up within it, it would have been as the taking of a thousand towns to have
seized Megiddo.” The Egyptians had made little progress in the art of ’be
sieging a stronghold since the times of the XIH’ dynasty. When scaling failed,
they had no otlier resource than a blockade, and even the most stubborn of the
Pharaohs would naturally shrink from the tedium of such an undertaking.
Thutmosis, however, was not inclined to lose the opportunity of closing the
campaign by a decisive blow, and began the investment of the town according
to the prescribed modes. His men were placed under canvas, and working
under the protection of immense shields, supported on posts, they made a ditch
around the w'alls, strengthening it with a palisade. The king constructed
also on the east side a fort which he called “ Manakhpirri-holds-the- Asiatics.”
Famine soon told on the demoralised citizens, and their surrender brought
about the submission of the entire country. Most of the countries situated
between the Jordan and the sea— Shunem, Cana, Kinnereth, Hazor, Ecdippa,

easily they had been routed ; but they had abandoned considerable supplies,
all of whicli had fallen into the hands of the victors. Some 724 chariots,
2041 mares, 200 suits of armour, 502 bows, the tent of the Prince of Qodshu
with its poles of cypress inlaid with gold, besides oxen, cows, goats, and more
than 20,000 sheep, were among the spoil. Before quitting the plain of Es
draelon, the king caused an official survey of it to be made, and bad the
harvest reaped. It yielded 208,000 bushels of wheat, not taking into account
what had been looted or damaged by the marauding soldiery. The return
homewards of the Egyptians must have resembled the exodus of some
emigrating tribe rather than the progress of a regular army.®
Thutmosis caused a long list of the vanquished to be engraved on the
walls of the temple which he was building at Karnak, thus affording the
good people of Thebes an opportunity for the first time of reading on the
monuments the titles of the king’s Syrian subjects written in hieroglyphics.

the catalogue, however, was not to end even here. Having once set out on a
career of conquest, the Pharaoh had no inclination to lay aside his arms. From
the XXIIP'' year of his reign to that of his death, we have a record of
twelve military expeditions, all of which he led in person. Southern Syria was
conquered at the outset—the whole of Kharu as far as the Lake of Gennesareth,
and the Amorite power was broken at one blow. The three succeeding
campaigns consolidated the rule of Egypt in the country of the Negeb, which
lay to the south-west of the Dead Sea, in Phoenicia, which prudently resigned
itself to its fate, and in that part of Lotanu occupying the northern part of the

basin of the Orontes.^ None of these expeditions appear to have been marked
by any successes comparable to the victory at Megiddo, for the coalition of
the Syrian chiefs did not survive the blow which they then sustained ; but
(^odshh long remained the centre of resistance, and the successive defeats which
its inhabitants suffered never disarmed for more than a short interval the hatred
which they felt for the Egyptian. During these years of glorious activity
considerable tribute poured in to both Memphis and Thebes ; not only ingots
of gold and silver, bars and blocks of copper and lead, blocks of lapis-lazuli
and valuable vases, but horses, oxen, sheep, goats, and useful animals of every
kind, in addition to all of which we find, as in Hatshopsitu’s reign, the mention
of rare plants and shrubs brought back from countries traversed by the armies
in their various expeditions. The Theban priests and savants exhibited much
interest in such curiosities, and their royal pupil gave orders to his generals
to collect for their benefit all that appeared either rare or novel. They

endeavoured to acclimatise the species or the varieties likely to be useful, and
in order to preserve a record of these experiments, they caused a representation
of the strange plants or animals to be drawn on the walls of one of the chapels
which they were then building to one of their gods. These pictures may still be

side by side with many plants peculiar to the regions of the Euphrates, others
having their habitat in the mountains and valleys of tropical Africa.^
This return to an aggressive policy on the part of the Egyptians, after the
weakness they had exhibited during the later period of Hatshopsitu’s regency,
seriously disconcerted the Asiatic sovereigns. They had vainly flattered them
selves that the invasion of Thutmosis I. was merely the caprice of an adventurous
prince, and they hoped that when his love of enterprise had expended itself,
Egypt would permanently withdraw within her traditional boundaries, and that
the relations of Elam with Babylon, Carchemish with Qodshu, and the barbarians
of the Persian Gulf with the inhabitants of the Iranian table-land would resume

their former course. This vain delusion was dispelled by the advent of a new
Thutmosis, who showed clearly by his actions that he intended to establish and
maintain the sovereignty of Egypt over the western dependencies, at least, of
the ancient Clialdsean empire, that is to say, over the countries which bordered
the middle course of the Euphrates and the coasts of the Mediterranean. The
audacity of his marches, the valour of his men, the facility with which in
a few hours he had crushed the assembled forces of half Syria, left no room
to doubt tliat he was possessed of personal qualities and material resources
sufficient to carry out projects of the most ambitious character. Babylon,
enfeebled by the perpetual dissensions of its Cossaean princes, was no longer in
a position to contest with him the little authority she still retained over the
peoples of Naharaim or of Ccele-Syria ; protected by the distance which
separated her from the Nile valley, she preserved a sullen neutrality, while
Assyria hastened to form a peaceful alliance with the invading power. Again
and again its kings sent to Thutmosis presents in proportion to their resources,
and the Pharaoh naturally treated their advances as undeniable proofs of their
voluntary vassalage. Each time that he received from them a gift of metal
or lapis-lazuli, he proudly recorded their tribute in the annals of his reign
and if, in exchange, he sent them some Egyptian product, it was in smaller
quantities, as might be expected from a lord to his vassal.^ Sometimes there
would accompany the convoy, surrounded by an escort of slaves and women,
some princess, whom the king would place in his harem or graciously pass on
to one of his children ; but when, on the other hand, an even distant relative
of the Pharaoh was asked in marriage for some king on the banks of the
Tigris or Euphrates, the request was met with a disdainful negative : the
daughters of the Sun were of too noble a race to stoop to such alliances, and
they would count it a humiliation to be sent in marriage to a foreign
court.'^
Free transit on the main road which ran diagonally through Kharu was
ensured by fortresses constructed at strategic points,^ and from this time
forward Thutmosis was able to bring the whole force of his army to bear
‘ The “ tribute of Assiir ” is mentioned in this way under the years XXIII. and XXIV. (Lepsius, Denlan., iii. 32, 11. 32, 36). The presents sent by the Pharaoli in return are not mentioned in any Egyptian text, but there is frequent reference to them in the Tel el-Amarna tablets (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets in the British Museum, pp. xxx.-xxxii.). It may be mentioned hero that the name of Nineveh does not occur on the Egyptian monuments, but only that of the town Nil, in which Champollion {Grammaire Egyptienne, j). 150) wrongly recognised the later capital of Assyria. ^ On the subject of these complaints of King Kallimmasin of Babylon to Amenothes III., see Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets, pp. xxviii., xxix. ; Tielb, Western Asia according to the more recent Discoveries, pp. 12-14. “ The castle, for instance, near Megiddo, previously referred to, which, after having contributed to the siege of the town, probably served to keep it in subjection ; see p. 258 of the present work.

to yield themselves prisoners. Thutmosis “with a joyous heart” was carry
ing them away captive, when it occurred to him that the district of Zahi,
which lay away for the most part from the great military high-roads, was
a tempting prey teeming with spoil. The barns were stored with wheat
and barley, the cellars were filled with wine, the harvest was not yet gathered
in, and the trees bent under the weight of their fruit. Having pillaged Sen
zauru on the Orontes,^ he made his way to the westwards through the ravine
formed by the Nahr el-Kebir, and descended suddenly on the territory of
Arvad. The towns once more escaped pillage, but Thutmosis destroyed the
harvests, [)luudered the orchards, carried off the cattle, and pitilessly wasted
the whole of the maritime plain. There was such abundance within the
camp that the men were continually getting drunk, and spent their time
in anointing themselves with oil, which they could do only in Egy[)t at
the most solemn festivals.'-^ They returned to Syria in the year XXX., and
their good fortune again favoured them. The stubborn Qodshu was harshly
dealt with ; Simyra and Arvad, which hitherto had held their own, now
opened their gates to him ; the lords of Upper Lotanu poured in their con
tributions without delay, and gave up their sous and brothers as hostages.® In
the year XXXI., the city of Anamut in Tikhisa, on the shores of Lake Nisrana,
yielded in its turn ; ^ on the 3rd of Pakhons, the anniversary of his corona
tion, the Lotanu renewed their homage to him in person. The return of
the expedition was a sort of triumphal procession. At every halting-place
tlie troops found quarters and provisions prepared for them, bread and cakes,
[)erfumes, oil, wine, and honey being provided in such quantities that they were
obliged on their departure to leave the greater part behind them. The scribes
took advantage of this peaceful state of affairs to draw up minute accounts
of the products of Lotanu—corn, barley, millet, fruits, and various kinds
of oil — prompted doubtless by the desire to arrive at a fairly just apportion
ment of the tribute. Indeed, the results of the expedition were considered
so satisfactory that they were recorded on a special monument dedicated in the
palace at Thebes.*' The names of the towns and peoples might change with

W. Max MiiLLEU, Asien und Europa, p. 185, note 3). It is, I believe, the Sizara of classical writers, the Shaizar of the Arabs, and is mentioned in one of the Tel el-Amarua tablets in connection with Nii. “ The account of this campaign is taken from the Annals of Thutmosis IIL, 11. 1-7, except the mention of Sinzaurii, which occurs only in the Inscription of Amenemhabi, 11. 11-13. ^ Annals of Thutmosis IIL, 11. 7-9; Inscription of Amenemhabi, 11. 13-lG.

Nisrana was seemingly applied to the marshy lake into which the Koweik flows, and it is perhaps to be found in the name Kin-uesiin (Kan-nishraya in Neubacer, G^og. du Talmud, p. 30). In this case Tikhisa would be the country near the lake; the district of the Grteco-Koman Chalkis is situated on the right of the military road. * Annals of Thutmosis III., 11. 9-15 ; cf. the Inscription of Amenemhabi, 11. 15-21.



THE CAMPAIGN OF THE YEAR XXXIIl. 265
every war, but the spoils suffered no diminution. In the year XXXIII.,
the kingdoms situated to the west of the Euphrates were so far pacified that
Thutmosis was able without risk to carry his arms into Mesopotamia. He
entered the country by the fords of Carchemish, near to the spot where his
grandfather, Thutmosis L, had erected his stele half a century previously.
He placed another beside this, and a third to the eastward to mark the
point to which he had extended the frontier of his empire. The Mitanni,
who exercised a sort of hegemony over the whole of Naharaim, were this
time the objects of his attack. Thirty-two of their towns fell one after
another, their kings were taken captive and the walls of their cities were
razed, without any serious resistance. The battalions of the enemy were
dispersed at the first shock, and Pharaoh “ pursued them for the space of
a mile, without one of them daring to look behind him, for they thought
only of escape, and fled before him like a flock of goats.” Thutmosis pushed
forward as far certainly as the Balikh, and perhaps on to the Khabur or
even to the Hermus ; and as he approached the frontier, the king of Singar, a
vassal of Assyria, sent him presents of lapis-lazuli. When this prince had
retired, another chief, the lord of the Great Khati, whose territory had not
even been threatened by the invaders, deemed it prudent to follow the
example of the petty princes of the plain of the Euphrates, and despatched
envoys to the Pharaoh bearing presents of no great value, but testifying to
his desire to live on good terms with Egypt. Still further on, the inhabitants
of Mi begged the king’s acceptance of a troop of slaves and two hundred and
sixty mares ; he remained among them long enough to erect a stele com
memorating his triumph, and to indulge in one of those extensive hunts which
were the delight of Oriental monarchs. The country abounded in elephants.
The soldiers were employed as beaters, and the king and his court succeeded
in killing one hundred and twenty head of big game, whose tusks were added
to the spoils. These numbers indicate how the extinction of such animals in
these parts was brought about. Beyond these regions, again, the sheikhs of
the Lamnaniu came to meet the Pharaoh. They were a poor people, and
had but little to offer, but among their gifts were some birds of a species
unknown to the Egyptians, and two geese, with which, however. His Majesty
deigned to be satisfied.^
' The campaign of the year XXXIIl. is mentioned in the Annals of Thutmosis III., 11. 17-27 ; the reference to the elephant-hunt occurs only in the Inscription of Anienemhabi, 11. 22, 23 ; an allusion to the defeat of the kings of Mitanni is found in a mutilated inscription from the tomb of Manakhpirrisonbu (Virey, Le Tombeau de Bamenkhepersenb, in the MCm. de la Miss, frang., vol. v. p. 205). It was probably on his return from this campaign that Thutmosis caused the great list to be engraved which, while it includes a certain number of names assigned to places beyond the Euphrates (Tomkins, On the Topog. of N. Syria, in Trans. Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. ix. pp. 227-254 ; W. M. Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 281-292), ought necessarily to contain the cities of the Mitanni (Mariette, Karnak, pis. 20, 2] ). As to the site of Nii and of the Lamnaniu- Labnana, see p. 142, note 6, and p. 189 of this vol.



266 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
In the year XXXIV. the Egyptians reappeared in Zahi. The people
of Anangasa having revolted, two of their towns were taken, a third sur
rendered, wliile the chiefs of the Lotanu hastened to meet their lord with
their usual tribute. Advantage was taken of the encampment being at the
foot of thb Lebanon to procure wood for building purposes, such as beams
and planks, masts and yards for vessels, which were all shipped by the
Kefatiu at Byblos for exportation to the Deltad This expedition was, indeed,
little more than a military march through the country. It would appear that
the Syrians soon accustomed themselves to the presence of the Egyptians in
their midst, and their obedience henceforward could be fairly relied on. We
are unable to ascertain what were the circumstances or the intrigues which,
in the year XXXV,, led to a sudden outbreak among the tribes settled on
the Euphrates and the Orontes. The King of Mitanni rallied round him the
princes of Naharaim, and awaited the attack of the Egyptians near Aruna.
Thutmosis displayed great personal courage, and the victory was at once
decisive. We find mention of only ten prisoners, one hundred and eighty
mares, and sixty chariots in the lists of the spoil.^ Anaugasa again revolted,
and was subdued afresh in the year XXXVIII. ; the Shausu rebelled in
the year XXXIX., and the Lotanu or some of the tribes connected with them
two years later.^ The campaign of the year XLII. proved more serious.
Troubles had arisen in the neighbourhood of Arvad. Thutmosis, instead
of following the usual caravan route, marched along the coast-road by way
of Phoenicia. He destroyed Arka in the Lebanon and the surrounding
strongholds, which were the haunts of robbers who lurked in the mountains
then turning to the north-east, he took Tunipa and extorted the usual tribute
from the inhabitants of Naharaim. On the other hand, the Prince of Qodshu,
trusting to the strength of his walled city, refused to do homage to the
Pharaoh, and a deadly struggle took place under the ramparts, in which each
side availed themselves of all the artifices which the strategic warfare of the
times allowed. On a day when the assailants and besieged were about to
come to close quarters, the Amorites let loose a mare among the chariotry
of Thutmosis. The Egyptian horses threatened to become unmanageable, and
had begun to break through the ranks, when Amenemhabi, an officer of the
guard, leaped to the ground, and, running up to the creature, disembowelled
it with a thrust of his sword ; this done, he cut off its tail and presented it
to the king. The besieged were eventually obliged to shut themselves
within their newly built walls, hoping by this means to tire out the patience
of their assailants ; but a picked body of men, led by the same brave

TEE TRIBUTES OF ETHIOPIA. 267
Amenemhabi who had killed the mare, succeeded in making a breach and
forcing an entrance into the townd Even the numerous successful campaigns
we have mentioned, form but a part, though indeed an important part, of the
wars undertaken by Thutmosis to “ fix his frontiers in the ends of the earth.”
Scarcely a year elapsed without the viceroy of Ethiopia having a conflict
with one or other of the tribes of the Upper Nile ;
^ little merit as he might
gain in triumphing over such foes, the spoil taken from them formed a con
siderable adjunct to the treasure collected in Syria, while the tributes from
the people of Kush and the Uauaiu were paid with as great regularity as the
taxes levied on the Egyptians themselves. It comprised gold both from the
mines and from the rivers, feathers, oxen with curiously trained horns, giraffes,
lions, leopards, and slaves of all ages. The distant regions explored by
Hatshopsitu continued to pay a tribute at intervals. A fleet went to Puanit
to fetch large cargoes of incense,^ and from time to time some Him chief
would feel himself honoured by having one of his daughters accepted as an
inmate of the harem of the great king.^ After the year XLII. we have
no further records of the reign, but there is no reason to suppose that its
closing years were less eventful or less prosperous than the earlier. Thutmosis
III., when conscious of failing powers, may have delegated the direction of
his armies to his sons or to his generals, but it is also quite possible that he
kept the supreme command in his own hands to the end of his days. Even
when old age approached and threatened to abate his vigour, he was upheld
by the belief that his father Amon was ever at hand to guide him with his
counsel and assist him in battle. “I give to thee, declared the god,® the
rebels that they may fall beneath thy sandals, that thou mayest crush the
rebellious, for I grant to thee by decree the earth in its length and breadth.
^ Annals of Thutmosis III., 11, 64-72; these liaea are almost as much mutilated as the account of the preceding campaigns.

The poem became celebrated. When Seti I., two centuries later, com
manded the Poet Laureates of his court to celebrate his victories in verse, the
latter, despairing of producing anything better, borrowed the finest strophes
from this hymn to Thutmosis III., merely changing the name of the hero.®
The composition, unlike so many other triumphal inscriptions, is not a mere
piece of official rhetoric, in which the poverty of the subject is concealed by a
multitude of common-places whether historical or mythological. Egypt indeed
ruled the world, either directly or through her vassals, and from the mountains
of Abyssinia to those of Cilicia her armies held the nations in awe with the
threat of the Pharaoh.

Wiedemann, Gescli. der (ichtzelinten lEgyptischen Dynastie, p. 74, note 3, has pointed out in Dumichen, Historische Inschriften, vol. i. pis. xi., xii., 1. 18, some expressions which recall those of our text.



TEE ORGANISATION OF THE EGYPTIAN EMPIRE. 271
The conqueror, as a rule, did not retain any part of their territory. He
confined himself to the appropriation of the revenue of certain domains for the
benefit of his gods.^ Amon of Karnak thus became possessor of seven Syrian
towns which he owed to the generosity of the victorious Pharaohs.^ Certain
cities, like Tunipa, even begged for statues of Thutmosis for which they built a
temple and instituted a cultus. Amon and his fellow-gods too were adored
there, side by side with the sovereign the inhabitants had chosen to represent
them here below.® These rites were at once a sign of servitude, and a proof of
gratitude for services rendered, or privileges which had been confirmed. The
princes of neighbouring regions repaired annually to these temples to renew
their oaths of allegiance, and to bring their tributes “ before the face of the
king.” ^ Taking everything into account, the condition of the Pharaoh’s
subjects might have been a pleasant one, had they been able to accept their
lot without any mental reservation. They retained their own laws, their
dynasties, and their frontiers, and paid a tax only in proportion to their resources,
while the hostages given were answerable for their obedience. These hostages
were as a rule taken by Thvitmosis from among the sons or the brothers of the
enemy’s chief. They were carried to Thebes, where a suitable establishment
was assigned to them,® the younger members receiving an education whicJi
practically made them Egyptians. As soon as a vacancy occurred in the
succession either in Syria or in Ethiopia, the Pharaoh would choose from
among the members of the family whom he held in reserve, that prince on
whose loyalty he could best count, and placed him upon the throne.® The
' Tlie seven towns which Amon possessed in Syria are mentioned, in the time of Eamses III., in the list of the domains and revenues of the god {The Great Harris Papyrus, Birch, pi. 68 a, 1. 1). “ In the year XXIIL, on his return from liis first campaign, Thutmosis III. provided offerings, guaranteed from the three towns Anaugasa, Intramu, and Hurnikaru, for his father Amonra (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 30, 11. 8-10; Beugsch, Recueil de Monuments, vol. i. pi. xlii. 11. 8-10). * The statues of Thutmosis HI. and of the gods of Egypt erected at Tunipa are mentioned in a letter from the inhabitants of that town to Amenothes III. (Bezold-Budge, The Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 41, pp. Ixx., Ixxi. ; Halevy, Notes G^ograpMques, § 1, in the Revue Se'mitique, vol. i. pp. 379-382, and Correspondance d' Am^nophis III. et d' Am^nophis IV., ihid., vol. ii. pp. 15, 16; Delattre, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings of the Bihl. Arch. Soc., 1892-93, vol. xv.
pp. 16-20). Later, Eamses II., speaking of the two towns in the country of the Khati in which
were two statues of His Majesty, mentions Tunipa as one of them (Brugsch, Recueil de 3Ionuments, vol. ii. pi. liv. 2, and Geschichte Mgyptens, p. 514). “ This is the expression used, in the time of Eamses HI., in the Great Harris Papyrus, pi. ix.
11. 1-3 : cf. Brugsch, Gesch. Algyptens, pp. 608, 609, and \V. Max Muller, Asien und Europa’p. 271.
* The various titles of the lists of Thutmosis HI. at Thebes show us “the children of the
Syrian chiefs conducted as prisoners” into the town of Suhanu (Maeiette, Karnak, pi. 17), which is
elsewhere mentioned as the depot, the prison of the temple of Amon {Id., pi. 19). W. Max Muller
was the first to remark the historical value of this indication {Asien und Europa, p. 268), but without
sufficiently insisting on it ; the name indicates, perhaps, as he says, a great prison, but a prison like
those where the princes of the family of the Ottoman sultans were confined by the reignino- monarch

method of procedure was not always successful, since these princes, whom one
would have supposed from their training to have been the least likely to have
asserted themselves against the man to whom they owed their elevation, often
gave more trouble than others. The sense of the supreme power of Egypt,
which had been inculcated in them during their exile, seemed to be
weakened after their return to their native country, and to give place to
a sense of their own importance. Their hearts misgave them as the time
approached for them to send their own children as pledges to their suzerain,
and also when called upon to transfer a considerable part of their revenue to
his treasury. They found, moreover, among their own cities and kinsfolk,
those who were adverse to the foreign yoke, and secretly urged their country
men to revolt, or else competitors for the throne who took advantage of the
popular discontent to pose as champions of national independence, and it was
difficult for the vassal prince to counteract the intrigues of these adversaries
without openly declaring himself hostile to his foreign master.^ A time quickly
came when a vestige of fear alone constrained them to conceal their wish for
liberty ; the most trivial incident then sufficed to give them the necessary
encouragement, and decided them to throw off the mask, —a repulse or the
report of a repulse suffered by the Egyptians, the news of a popular rising in
some neighbouring state, the passing visit of a Chaldseau emissary who left
behind him the hope of support and perhaps of subsidies from Babylon, and
the unexpected arrival of a troop of mercenaries whose services might be hired
for the occasion.^ A rising of this sort usually brought about the most disas
trous results. The native prince or the town itself could keep back the tribute
and own allegiance to no one during the few months required to convince
Pharaoh of their defection and to allow him to prepare the necessary means of

vengeance ; the advent of the Egyptians followed, and the work of repression
was systematically set in hand. They destroyed the harvests, whether green
or ready for the sickle, they cut down the palms and olive trees, they tore up
the vines, seized on the flocks, dismantled the strongholds, and took the
inhabitants prisoners.^ The rebellious prince had to deliver up his silver and
gold, the contents of his palace, even his children,^ and when he had Anally

obtained peace by means of endless sacrifices, he found himself a vassal as
before, but with an empty treasury, a wasted country, and a decimated
people. In spite of all this, some headstrong native princes never re
linquished the hope of freedom, and no sooner had they made good the
breaches in their walls as far as they were able, than they entered once
more on this unequal contest, though at the risk of bringing irreparable
disaster on their country. The majority of them, after one such struggle,
resigned themselves to the inevitable, and fulfilled their feudal obligations
regularly. They paid their fixed contribution, furnished rations and stores

to the army when passing through their territory, and informed the ministers
at Thebes of any intrigues among their neighbours^ Years elapsed before they
could so far forget the failure of their first attempt to regain independence,
as to venture to make a second, and expose themselves to fresh reverses.
The administration of so vast an empire entailed but a small expenditure
on the Egyptians, and required the ofiSces of merely a few functionaries.® The
garrisons which they kept up in foreign provinces lived on the country, and
were composed mainly of light troops, archers, a certain proportion of heavy
infantry, and a few minor detachments of chariotry dispersed among the
principal fortresses.^ The officers in command had orders to interfere as little
as possible in local affairs, and to leave the natives to dispute or even to fight
among themselves unhindered, so long as their quarrels did not threaten the
security of the Pharaoh.^ It was never part of the policy of Egypt to insist
on her foreign subjects keeping an unbroken peace among themselves. If,
theoretically, she did not recognise the right of private warfare, she at all
events tolerated its practice. It mattered little to her whether some particular
province passed out of the possession of a certain Eibaddu into that of a certain
Aziru, or vice versa, so long as both Eibaddu and Aziru remained her faithful
slaves.® She never sought to repress their incessant quarrelling until such time
as it threatened to take the form of an insurrection against her own power.
Then alone did she throw off her neutrality ; taking the side of one or other of
' We find in the Annals, 11. 12-14, 23, 24, 34, in addition to the enumeration of the tributes, the mention of the foraging arrangements which the chiefs were compelled to make for the army on its passage ; cf. the letter of Akizzi in Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 36, 11. 10-15, and Boscawen, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, in the Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. vi. p. 34. We find among the tablets letters from Aziru denouncing the intrigues of the Khati (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafel/und. Nos. 31-38, pis. 38-45; cf. Delattbe, Azirou, in the Proceedings, 1890-91, vol. xiii. p. 215, et seq.); letters also of Eibaddu pointing out the misdeeds of Abdashirti (WincklerAbel, Der Thonta/elfund, No. 72, pi. 76, and Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 12, pp. xliv., xlv. ; cf. Delattee, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings, 1892-93, vol. xiv. pp. 345, 346, 349-352), and other communications of the same nature, which demonstrate the supervision exercised by the petty Syrian princes over each other. - Under Thutmosis III. we have among others “ Mir,” or “ Nasi situ mihatitu,” “ governors of the northern countries,” the Tliutii who became afterwards a hero of romance (Deveria, (Euvres, vol. i. p. 35, et scq.) ; cf. p. 277 of the present work. The individuals who bore this title held a middle rank in the Egyptian hierarchy (Maspeeo, Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. ii. pp. 9, 49). On the
administration of the Syrian provinces, see W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 273-275.
^ The archers piddtiu, piddti, piddte— and the chariotry quartered in Syria are often mentioned in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence. Steindorff has recognised the term udu, auitu, meaning infantry (see p. 213, note 4, of the present volume), in the word ueu, uiu, of the Tel el-Amarna tablets (ZiJiaiERN, Die Keilsclir if(briefe aus Jerusalem, in the Zeitsclirift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vi. pp. 254, n. 4).
* A half at least of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence treats of provincial wars between the kings of
towns and countries subject to Egypt—wars of Abdashirti and his son Aziru against the cities of the Phoenician coast (Delattre, Azirou, in the Proceedings, 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp. 215-234, and Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, ibid., 1892-93, vol. xv. pp. 345-373, 501-520), wars of Abdikhiba, or Abdi-Tabba, King of Jerusalem, against the chiefs of the neighbouring cities (Zimmeen, Die Keilschriftbriefe aus Jerusalem, in the Zeitsclirift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vi. pp. 245-263, and Palestina um der Jahr I4OO vor Christi nach neuen Quellen, in the Zeitsclirift des Paldstina-Vereins, vol. xiii. p. 142, et seq.). ^ See in Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets,TAo. 13, pp. xlvi., xlvii., 30, 31, the letter in whi9h llibaddu denounces Aziru as a rebel, whilst Aziru elsewhere professes his fidelity.



TEE RELATIONS OF PHARAOH WITH HIS VASSALS. 275
the dissentients, she would grant him, as a pledge, of help, ten, twenty, thirty,
or even more archersd No doubt the discipline and personal courage of these
veterans exercised a certain influence on the turn of events, but they were after
all a mere handful of men, and their individual action in the combat would
scarcely ever have been sufficient to decide the result ; the actual importance
of their support, in spite of their numerical inferiority, lay in the moral weight
they brought to the side on which they fought, since they represented the
wliole army of the Pharaoh which lay behind them, and their presence in a
camp always ensured final success. The vanquished party had the right of
appeal to the sovereign, through whom he might obtain a mitigation of
the lot which his successful adversary had prepared for liim ; it was to the
interest of Egypt to keep the balance of power as evenly as possible between
the various states which looked to her, and when she prevented one or other of
the princes from completely crushing his rivals, she was minimising the danger
which might soon arise from the vassal whom she had allowed to extend his
territory at the expense of others.
These relations gave rise to a perpetual exchange of letters and petitions
between the court of Thebes and the northern and southern provinces, in which
all the petty kings of Africa and Asia, of whatever colour or race, set forth,
either openly or covertly, their ambitions and their fears, imploring a favour
or beggiug for a subsidy, revealing the real or suspected intrigues of their
fellow-chiefs, and while loudly proclaiming their own loyalty, denounciug
the perfidy and the secret projects of their neighbours. As the Ethiopian
peoples did not, apparently, possess an alphabet of their own, half of the
correspondence which concerned them was carried on in Egyptian, and written
on papyrus. In Syria, however, where Babylonian civilization maintained itself
in spite of its conquest by Thutmosis, cuneiform writing was still employed,
and tablets of dried clay.^ It had, therefore, been found necessary to establish
in the Pharaoh’s palace a department for this service, in which the scribes
should be competent to decipher the Chaldaean character. Dictionaries and
easy mythological texts had been procured for their instruction, by means of
* Abimilki (Abisharri) demands on one occasion from the King of Egypt ten men to defend Tyre (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 30, recto, 11. 14-16, p. 64), on another occasion twenty (Id., ibid.. No. 28, recto, 11. 17, 18, p. 59); the town of Gula requisitioned thirty or forty to guard it (Id., ibid.. No. 45, verso, 11. 30-32, p. 93; cf. Halevy, Gorrespondance d’Amenophes III., etc., in the Revue Sdmitique, yoI. ii. p. 20). Delattre thinks that these are rhetorical expressions answering to a general word, just as if we should say “ a handful of men ” (Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings, 1892-93, Yol. XV. p. 508) ; the difference of value in the figures is to me a proof of their reality. “ A discovery made by the fellahin, in 1887, at Tel el-Amarna, in the ruins of the palace of Khuuiatou (Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 23, 24), brought to light a portion of the correspondence between Asiatic monarchs, whether vassals or independent of Egypt, with the officers of Amenothes III. and IV., and with these Pharaohs themselves. The bibliography of the principal publications called forth by the discovery is to be found in Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, pp. Ixxxvii.-xcii.

whicli they had learned the meaning of words and the construction of sentences^
Having once mastered the mechanism of the syllabary, they set to work to
translate the despatches, marking on the back of each the date and the place
from whence it came, and if necessary making a draft of the reply.^ In these
the Pharaoh does not appear, as a rule, to have insisted on the endless titles
which we find so lavishly used in his inscriptions, but the shortened protocol
employed shows that the theory of his divinity was as fully acknowledged by
strangers as it was by his own subjects. They greet him as their sun, the god
before whom they prostrate themselves seven times seven, while they are his
slaves, his dogs, and the dust beneath his feet.^ The runners to whom these docu
ments were entrusted, and who delivered them with their own hand, were not, as
a rule, persons of any consideration ; but for missions of grave importance “ the
king’s messengers ” were employed, whose functions in time became extended to
a remarkable degree. Those who were restricted to a limited sphere of activity
were called “ the king’s messengers for the regions of the south,” or “ the king’s
messengei’s for the regions of the north,” according to their proficiency in the
idiom and customs of Africa or of Asia. Others were deemed capable of under
taking missions wherever they might be required, and were, therefore, designated
by the bold title of “ the king’s messengers for all lands.” ^ In this case
extended powers were conferred upon them, and they were permitted to
cut short the disputes between two cities in some province they had to
inspect, to excuse from tribute, to receive presents and hostages, and even
princesses destined for the harem of the Pharaoh, and also to grant the support
of troops to such as could give adequate reason for seeking it.® Their tasks
were always of a delicate and not infrequently of a perilous nature, and
constantly exposed them to the danger of being robbed by highwaymen or

Boscawen, Syllabaries from Tel elAmarna, in Babyl. and Oriental Record, vol. vi. p. 120, and Sayce in Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 31-36. ^ Several of these registrations are still to be read on the backs of the tablets at Berlin, London, and Gizeh (Erman-Winckler, Verzeichniss der aus dem Funde herruhrenden Thontafeln, in Zeitschrift, 1889, vol. xxvii. pp. 62-61, and Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund von El-Amarna, pis. 5 h, 11, 19; ScHEiL, Tahlettes de Tell el-Amarna, in the Mg'm. de la Mission Frangaise du Gaire, vol. vi. pp. 297-312). ^ The protocols of the letters of Abdashirti may be taken as an example (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, No. 97, p.99), or those of Abimilki (Bezold-Bodge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 30,p.lxi.) to Pharaoh (Delattre, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in Proa. Bibl. Ajch. Soc., 1892-93, vol. xv. pp. 501, 502, 505-508); sometimes there is a development of the protocol which assumes panegyrical features similar to those met with in Egypt (Bezold-Bodge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 29, p. 62, 11. 1-15). * As to the fiscal functions of the messengers, see Maspero, Atwdes Apyptiennes, vol. ii. pp. 38, 39 ; their political functions were brought to light in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence. * The Tel el-Amarna correspondence shows the messengers in the time of Amenothes III. and IV. as receiving tribute {Letter from Aziru, in Bezold-Bodge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 35, p. 73, 11. 51-56), as bringing an army to the succour of a chief in difficulties (Id., ibid., No. 28, p. 60, 11. 3817), as threatening with the anger of the Pharaoh the princes of doubtful loyalty (WincklerAbel, Der Thontafelfund, etc., p. 95 a, b), as giving to a faithful vassal compliments and honours from his suzerain {Letter of Abimilki, in Bezold-Bodge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 29, pp. 62, 63), as charged with the conveyance of a gift of slaves (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, p. 36, verso, 11. 6, 7), or of escorting a princess to the harem of the Pharaoh (Id., ibid., p. 18 a, recto, 11. 8-27).



THE ROYAL MESSENGERS, THUTII. 277
maltreated by some insubordinate vassal, at times even running the risk of
mutilation or assassination by the wayd They were obliged to brave the
dangers of the forests of Lebanon and of the Taurus, the solitudes of
Mesopotamia, the marshes of Chaldaea, the voyages to Puanit and Asia Minor.
Some took their way towards Assyria and Babylon, while others embarked at
Tyre or Sidon for the islands of the ^Egean Archipelago.^ The endurance of
all these officers, whether governors or messengers, their courage, their tact, the
ready wit they were obliged to summon to help them out of the difficulties into
which their calling frequently brought them, all tended to enlist the public
sympathy in their favour.^ Many of them achieved a reputation, and were
made the heroes of popular romance. More than three centuries after it was
still related how one of them, by name Thutii, had reduced and humbled Jaffa,
whose chief had refused to come to terms. Thutii set about his task by
feigning to throw off his allegiance to Thutmosis IIL, and withdrew from the
Egyptian service, having first stolen the great magic wand of his lord ; he then
invited the rebellious chief into his camp, under pretence of showing him this
formidable talisman, and killed him after they had drunk together. The cunning
envoy then packed five hundred of his soldiers into jars, and caused them to be
carried on the backs of asses before the gates of the town, where he made the
herald of the murdered prince proclaim that the Egyptians had been defeated,
and that the pack train which accompanied him contained the spoil, among
which was Thutii himself. The officer in charge of the city gate was deceived
by this harangue, the asses were admitted within the walls, where the soldiers
quitted their jars, massacred the garrison, and made themselves masters of the
town. The tale is, in the main, the story of Ali Baba and the forty thieves.^
The frontier was continually shifting, and Thutmosis III., like Thutmosis I.,
’ A letter of Kibaddu, iu the time of Amenothes III., represents a royal messenger as blockaded in Byblos by the rebels (Bezold-Bcdge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 13, pp. 30, 31, 11. 31-13). ^ We hear from the tablets of several messengers to Babylon, and the Mitanni, Easi (WincklerAbel, Rer Thontafelfund, p. 1, 11. 16, 17), Mani (Id., ibid., p. 18 a, b; Bezold-Budge, Tell elAmarna Tablets, pp. 18-21), Khamassi (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, p. 20, recto, 1. 37). The royal messenger Thutii, who governed the countries of the north, speaks of having satisfied the heart of the king in “ the isles which are in the midst of the sea ” (Birch-Ohabas, Md'moire sur une Patere Egyptienne du Musee du Louvre, pp. 4, 18, et seq.). This was not, as some think, a case of
hyperbole (W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 369, note 1), for the messengers could embark on Phoenician vessels ; they had a less distance to cover in order to reach the ^Egean than the royal messenger of Queen Hatshopsitu had before arriving at the country of the Somalis and the “ Ladders of Incense” (see p. 246, et seq., of the present work). * The hero of the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, with whom Chabas made us acquainted in his Voyage d’un Egyptien, is probably a type of the “ messenger ” of the time of Eamses II. ; in any case, his itinerary and adventures are natural to a “ royal messenger ” compelled to traverse Syria alone. * Tlie story of Thutii was discovered and published by Goodwin, Translation of a Fragment of aw Historical Narrative relating to the Reign of Thotmes IIL, in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. iii. p. 348, et seq., afterwards translated and annotated by Maspero, Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. i. pp. 49-72; cf. Les Contes populaires de VEgypte antique, 2nd edit., pp. 147-160, and Prof. F. Petrie, Egyptian Tales, 2nd series, pp. 1-12.

278 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
vainly endeavoured to give it a fixed character by erecting stelae along
the banks of the Euphrates, at those points where he contended it had
run formerly^ While Kharu and Phoenicia were completely in the hands
of the conqueror, his suzerainty became more uncertain as it extended
northwards in the direction of the Taurus. Beyond Qodshu, it could
only be maintained by means of constant supervision, and in Naharaim its
duration was coextensive with the sojourn of the conqueror in the locality
during his campaign, for it vanished of itself as soon as he had set out on his
return to Africa. It will be thus seen that, on the continent of Asia, Egypt
possessed a nucleus of territories, so far securely under her rule that they might
be actually reckoned as provinces ; beyond this immediate domain there was a
zone of waning influence, whose area varied with each reign, and even under
one king depended largely on the activity which he personally displayed. This
was always the case when the rulers of Egypt attempted to carry their
supremacy beyond the isthmus ; whether under the Ptolemies or the native
king.s, the distance to which her influence extended was always practically the
same, and the teaching of history enables us to note its limits on the map with
relative accuracy.^ The coast towns, which were in maritime communication
with the ports of the Delta, submitted to the Egyptian yoke more readily than
those of the interior. But this submission could not be reckoned on beyond
Berytus, on the banks of the Lykos, though occasionally it stretched a little
further north as far as Byblos and Arvad ; even then it did not extend inland,
and the curve marking its limits traverses Coele-Syria from north-west to
south-east, terminating at Mount Herraon. Damascus, securely entrenched
behind Anti-Lebanon, almost always lay outside this limit. The rulers of
Egypt generally succeeded without much difficulty in keeping possession of the
countries lying to the south of this line ; it demanded merely a slight effort,
and this could be furnished for several centuries without encroaching seriously
on the resources of the country, or endangering its prosperity. When, however,
some province ventured to break away from the control of Egypt, the whole
mechanism of the government was put into operation to provide soldiers and
the necessary means for an expedition. Each stage of the advance beyond
the frontier demanded a greater expenditure of energy, which, with prolonged
distances, would naturally become exhausted. The expedition would scarcely
' See the mention of these stelae at pp. 210, 265 of the present work. None of those which were erected in Naharaim exist now, but we still have some others at the mouth of the Nahr el-Kelb, which were put up in the time of Eamses II. (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 197). ^ The development of the Egyptian navy enabled the Ptolemies to exercise authority over the coasts of Asia Minor and of Thrace, but this extension of their power beyond the indicated limits only hastened the exhaustion of their empire (Deoysen, Geschichte der Epigonen, 2ad edit., vol. ii. pp. 161-163). This instance, like that of Mehemet Ali, thus confirms the position taken up ill the text.



THE SUBJECTS AND ALLIES OF EGYPT. 279
have reached the Taurus or the Euphrates, before the force of circumstances
would bring about its recall homewards, leaving but a slight bond of vassalage
between the recently subdued countries and the conqueror, which would speedily
be cast off or give place to relations dictated by interest or courtesy. Thut
mosis III. had to submit to this sort of necessary law ; a further extension of ter
ritory had hardly been gained when his dominion began to shrink within the
frontiers that appeared to have been prescribed by nature for an empire like that
of Egypt. Kharu and Phoenicia proper paid him their tithes with due regularity;
the cities of the Amurru and of Zahi, of Damascus, Qodshu, Hamath, and even of
Tunipa, lying on the outskirts of these two subject nations, formed an ill-defined
borderland, kept in a state of perpetual disturbance by the secret intrigues
or open rebellions of the native princes. The kings of Alasia, Naharaim, and
Mitanni preserved their independence in spite of repeated reverses, and they
treated with the conqueror on equal terms.^ The tone of their letters to the
Pharaoh, the polite formulas with which they addressed him, the special
protocol which the Egyptian ministry had drawn up for their reply, all differ
widely from those which we see in the despatches coming from commanders
of garrisons or actual vassals. In the former it is no longer a slave or a
feudatory addressing his master and awaiting his orders, but equals holding
courteous communication with each other, the brother of Alasia or of Mitanni
with his brother of Egypt. They inform him of their good health, and then,
before entering on business, they express their good wishes for himself, his
wives, his sons, the lords of his court, his brave soldiers, and for his horses.
They were careful never to forget that with a single word their correspondent
could let loose upon them a whirlwind of chariots and archers without number,*
but the respect they felt for his formidable power never degenerated into a
fear which would humiliate them before him with their faces in the dust.
This interchange of diplomatic compliments was called for by a variety
of exigencies, such as incidents arising on the frontier, secret intrigues, personal
alliances, and questions of general politics. The kings of Mesopotamia and of
Northern Syria, even those of Assyria and Chaldma, who were preserved by
distance from the dangers of a direct invasion, were in constant fear of an
unexpected war, and heartily desired the downfall of Egypt ; they endeavoured
meanwhile to occupy the Pharaoh so fully at home that he had no leisure to
attack them. Even if they did not venture to give open encouragement to
the disposition in his subjects to revolt, they at least experienced no scruple
in hiring emissaries who secretly fanned the flame of discontent. The Pharaoh,
' The difference of tone between the letters of these kings and those of the other princes, as well as the consequences arising from it, has been clearly defined by Delattre, La Correspondance Asiatique d’Amgnophis III. et d’ Am^nopMs IV., in the Revue des Questions Historiques, vol. liv. pp. 354-361.



•280 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
aroused to indignation by such plotting, reminded them of their former oaths
and treaties. The king in question would thereupon deny everything, would
speak of his tried friendship, and recall the fact that he had refused to help
a rebel against his beloved brother^ These protestations of innocence were
usually accompanied by presents, and produced a twofold effect. They soothed
the anger of the offended party, and suggested not only a courteous answer,
but the sending of still more valuable gifts. Oriental etiquette, even in those
early times, demanded that the present of a less rich or powerful friend should
place the recipient under the obligation of sending back a gift of still greater
worth. Every one, therefore, whether great or little, was obliged to regulate
his liberality according to the estimation in which he held himself, or to the
opinion which others formed of him, and a personage of such opulence as the
King of Egypt was constrained by the laws of common civility to display an
almost boundless generosity : was he not free to work the mines of the Divine
Land or the diggings of the Upper Nile; and as for gold, “was it not as the
dust of his country ” ? ^ He would have desired nothing better than to exhibit
such liberality, had not the repeated calls on his purse at last constrained
him to parsimony ; he would have been ruined, and Egypt with him, had he
given all that was expected of him.® Except in a few extraordinary cases,
the gifts sent never realised the expectations of the recipients ; for instance,
when twenty or thirty pounds of precious metal were looked for, the amount
despatched would be merely two or three. The indignation of these dis
appointed beggars and their recriminations were then most amusing : “ From
the time when my father and thine entered into friendly relations, they loaded
each other with presents, and never waited to be asked to exchange amenities ;

and now my brother sends me two minas of gold as a gift ! Send me abundance
of gold, as much as thy father sent, and even, for so it must be, more than

G6, et seq. ; cf. Delattre, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings, 1892-93, vol. XV. pp. 27, 28) ; see also the letter from Burnaburiash to Amenothes IV., in which he defends himself from the accusation of having plotted against the King of Egypt at any time, and recalls the circumstance that his father Kurigalzu had refused to encourage the rebellion of one of the Syrian tribes, subjects of Amenothes III.

thy father.” ^ , Pretexts were never wanting to give reasonable weight to such
demands : one correspondent had begun to build a temple or a palace in one
of his capitals/ another was reserving his fairest daughter for the Pharaoh,
and he gave him to understand that anything he might receive would help
to complete the bride’s trousseau.^ The princesses thus sent from Babylon or
Mitanni to the court of Thebes enjoyed on their arrival a more honourable
welcome, and were assigned a more exalted rank than those who came from
Kharu and Phoenicia. As a matter of fact, they were not hostages given over
to the conqueror to be disposed of at will, but queens who were united in
legal marriage to an ally.^ Once admitted to the Pharaoh’s court, they retained
their full rights as his wife, as well as their own fortune and mode of life.
Some would bring to their betrothed chests of jewels, utensils, and stuffs,
the enumeration of which would cover both sides of a large tablet ;
® others
would arrive escorted by several hundred slaves or matrons as personal
attendants.® A few of them preserved their original name,'^ many assumed
an Egyptian designation,® and so far adapted themselves to the costumes,
manners, and language of their adopted country, that they dropped all inter
course with their native land, and became regular Egyptians. When, after

The letter from which this passage was taken is from Burnaburiash, King of Babylon, to Amenothes IV. (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 2, recto, p. 6, 11. 7-13). ^ This is the pretext advanced by Burnaburiash in the letter just cited, 11, 15, 16. * This seems to have been the motive in a somewhat embarrassing letter which Dushratta, King of Mitanni, wrote to the Pharaoh Amenothes III. on the occasion of his fixing the dowry of his daughter (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, p. 18 a, 6 ; cf. Delattre, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp. 552, 553). * For the condition of these women, see Delattre, Mariages princiers en Egypte, d’apres les lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Revue des Questions Historiques, vol. li. pp. 222-235, and La Correspondance Asiatique d’Amdnophis III., etc., ibid., vol. liv. pp. 362-379. The daughter of the King of the Khati, wife of Kamses II., was treated, as we see from the monuments, with as much honour as would have been accorded to Egyptian princesses of pure blood (Mariette, Fragments relatifs aux fouilles de San, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. ix. pp. 10, 13). ^ Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, pp. 25, 26, where the objects belonging to the dowry of the sister of King Dushratta of Mitanni, are enumerated on the occasion of her marriage with Amenotiies IV. “ Gilukhipa, wlio was sent to Egypt to become the wife of Amenothes III , took with her a company of three hundred and seventy women for her service (Bregsch, Ueber ein merJcwurdiges historisches Denkmal aus den Zeiten Amenophis III., in the Zeitschrift, 1880, pp. 81-87 ; Birch, Scarabxi of Amenophis III., in the Records of the Past, 1st series, vol. xii. pp. 39, 40). She was a daughter of Sutarna, King of Mitanni, and is mentioned several times in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence (Erman, Neues aus der Tafeln von El-Amarna, in the Zeitschrift, vol. xxviii. p. 112 ; Evetts, Tatum-hipa und Gilu-hipa, ibid., p. 113; Winckler, Satarna, Konig von Naharina, ibid., pp. 114, 115). ’’ For example, Gilukhipa, whose name is transcribed Kilagipa in Egyptian, and another princess of Mitanni, niece of Gilukhipa, called Tadukhipa, daughter of Dushratta and wife of Amenothes IV. (Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 9, p. 22, 11. 5, 6). * The prince of the Khati’s daughter who married Eamses II. is an example ; we know her only by her Egyptian name Maitnofiihri (Lepsids, Denhm., iii. 196 a Mariette, Fragments et documents relatifs aux fouilles de San, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. ix. pp. 10, 13). The wife of Eamses III. (Lepsius, Konigsbuch, Nos. 490, 491) added to the Egyptian name of Isis her original name, Humazarati.

several years, an ambassador arrived with greetings from their father or
brother, he would be puzzled by the changed appearance of these ladies, and
would almost doubt their identity ; indeed, those only who had been about
them in childhood were in such cases able to recognise themd These
princesses all adopted the gods of their husbands,^ though without necessarily
renouncing their own. From time to time their parents would send them,
with much pomp, a statue of one of their national divinities—Ishtar, for
example— which, accompanied by native priests, would remain for some
months at the court.® The children of these queens ranked next in order to
those wliose mothers belonged to the solar race, but nothing prevented them
marrying their brothers or sisters of pure descent, and being eventually raised
to the throne. The members of their families who remained in Asia were
naturally proud of these bonds of close affinity with the Pharaoh, and they
rarely missed an opportunity of reminding him in their letters that they
stood to him in the relationship of brother-in-law, or one of his fathers-in
law ; their vanity stood them in good stead, since it afforded them another
claim on the favours which they were perpetually asking of him.^
These foreign wives had often to interfere in some of the contentions
which were bound to arise between two States whose subjects were in
constant intercourse with one another. Invasions or provincial wars may have
affected or even temporarily suspended the passage to and fro of caravans
between the countries of the Tigris and those of the Nile ; but as soon as
peace was re-established, even though it were the insecure peace of those
distant ages, the desert traffic was again resumed and carried on with renewed
vigour. The Egyptian traders who penetrated into regions beyond the
Euphrates, carried with them, and almost unconsciously disseminated along the
whole extent of their route, the numberless products of Egyptian industry,
hitherto but little known outside their own country, and rendered expensive
owing to the difficulty of transmission or the greed of the merchants. The
Syrians now saw for the first time in great quantities, objects which had been
known to them hitherto merely through the few rare specimens which made

'* Dushratta of Mitanni never loses an opportunity of calling Amenothes III., husband of his sister Gilukhipa, and of one of his daughters, “ akhiya,” my brother, and “ khatani-ya,” my son-in-law (Winckler-Abel, Der Thonta/elfund, p. 17, 11. 1-3).

their way across the frontier : arms, stuffs, metal implements, household utensils

in fine, all the objects which ministered to daily needs or to luxury. These
were now offered to them at reasonable prices, either by the hawkers who
accompanied the army or by the soldiers themselves, always ready, as soldiers
are, to part with their possessions in order to procure a few extra pleasures in
the intervals of fighting. On the other hand, whole convoys of spoil were
despatched to Egypt after every successful campaign, and their contents were
distributed in varying proportions among all classes of society, from the militia
man belonging to some feudal contingent, who received, as a reward of his
valour, some half-dozen necklaces or bracelets, to the great lord of ancient
family or the Crown Prince, who carried off waggon-loads of booty in their
train. These distributions must have stimulated a passion for all Syrian
goods, and as the spoil was insufficient to satisfy the increasing demands of

the consumer, the waning commerce which had been carried on from early
times was once more revived and extended, till every route, whether by land
or water, between Thebes, Memphis, and the Asiatic cities, was thronged
by those engaged in its pursuit. It would take too long to enumerate the
various objects of merchandise brought in almost daily to the marts on
the Nile by Phoenician vessels or the owners of caravans.^ They comprised
slaves destined for the workshop or the harem,^ Hittite bulls and stallions,
horses from Singar, oxen from Alasia,^ rare and curious animals such
as elephants from Nii, and brown bears from the Lebanon,^ smoked and
salted fish, live birds of many-coloured plumage,® goldsmiths’ work ® and
precious stones, of which lapis-lazuli was the chief, wood for building or for
ornamental work—pine, cypress, yew, cedar, and oak,'^ musical instruments,**
helmets, leathern jerkins covered with metal scales, weapons of bronze and iron,®
' A partial list has beeu drawn up by Beugsch, Gescliichte ASgyptens, pp. 342-3t5 ; by Ekman, AUgypten und ASgyptisches Leben, pp. 681, 682 ; by Bondi, Dem Hebraisch-Phonisischen Spraclizweige angehorige Lehnicorter, p. 24, et seq. ; and by W. Max Muller, Asi'en und Europa, pp. 305-309. * Syrian slaves are mentioned along with Ethiopian in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xvi. 11. 2-5 ; and there is mention in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence of Hittite slaves whom Dushratta of Mitanni brought to Amenothes III. (Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 9, p. 23, 11. 36-38), and of other presents of the same kind made by the King of Alasia as a testimony of his grateful homage. ^ Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xvii. 11. 8, 9 ; cf. as to the horses, p. 215 of the present work. * The elephant and the bear are represented on the tomb of Eakhmiri among the articles of tribute brought into Egypt (Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte, etc., pi. clxxvi. 1, 2 ; Eosellini, Monumenti Civili, pi. xxii. 3, 5 ; Virey, Le Tombeau de Belchmara, pi. vii., in the M^moires de la Mission, vol.

The Tell elAmarna letters also mention vessels of gold or blocks of precious stone sent as presents or as objects of exchange to the Pharaoh by the King of Babylon (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 2, p. 7, 1. 36, No. 3, p. 9, 11. 40-44), by the King of Mitanni (Id., ibid.. No. 9, p. 23, 11. 41-45), by the King of the Hittites (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, p. 14, 11. 11-15), and by other princes. The lapis-lazuli of Babylon, which probably came from Persia, was that which was most prized by the Egyptians on account of the golden sparks in it, which enhanced the blue colour; this is, perhaps, the Uknu of the cuneiform inscriptions, which has beeu read for a long time as “ crystal ” (Lyon, On a Lapis-lazuli Disc bearing a Cuneiform Inscription, in the Proceedings of the American
Oriental Society, 1889, pp. cxxiv.-cxxvii. ; Steindorff, Ugnu Stein = Lapis-Lazuli, in the Zeitschrift fixr Assyriologie, vol. vii. pp. 194-197). ’ Building and ornamental woods are often mentioned in the inscriptions of Thutmosis III. (Annals,
11. 26, 31, 32, 34). A scene at Kariiak represents Seti I. causing building-wood to be cut in the region of the Lebanon (Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte, etc., pi. cccxxxix., and vol. ii. pp. 87, 88 ;
Eosellini, Monumenti Storici, pi. xlvi. 1). A letter of the King of Alasia speaks of contributions of wood which several of his subjects had to make to the King of Egypt (Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 5, p. 12, 11. 27-29, and p. xxxv.). * Some stringed instruments of music, and two or three kinds of flutes and flageolets, are designated
in Egyptian by names borrowed from some Semitic tongue —a fact which proves that they were imported (Anastasi Papyrus, No. 4, pi. xii. 1. 1, et seq.) ; the wooden framework of the harp, decorated with sculptured heads of Astarte, figures among the objects coming from Syria in the temple of the Theban Amon (Prisse, Hist, de VArt Egyptien, vol. ii. pi. 99) ; cf. the cut on p. 283 of the present work. ** Several names of arms borrowed from some Semitic dialect have been noticed in the texts of this period. The objects as well as the woids must have been imported into Egypt, e.g. the quiver (Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. xxv. 1. 7; Dumichen, Eistorische Inschriften, vol. i. pi. iv. 1. 25), the

Syrian chariots —Markabuti—with a reference to the localities where certain parts of them were made

the country of the Amurru, that of Ahpa, the town of Pahira (pi. xvi, 1. 6, et seq.). The Tel el-Amarna correspondence mentions very frequently chariots sent to the Pharaoh by the King of Babylon, either as presents (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 2, p. 7,11. 37, 38) or to be sold in Egypt (Id., ibid.. No. 1, p. 5, 11. 88-95) ; others sent by the King of Alasia (Id., ibid.. No. 6, p. 14, 11. 21, 22) and by the King of Mitanni (Id., ibid., No. 9, p. 23, 11. 36-40). “ Some linen, cotton, or woollen stutfs are mentioned in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 4, pi. xvii. 1. 2, et seq., and elsewhere as coming from Syria. The Egyptian love of white linen always prevented their estimating highly the coloured and brocaded stuffs of Asia ; and one sees nowhere, in the representations, any examples of stuffs of such origin, except on furniture or in ships equipped with something of the kind in the form of sails. ‘ The perfumed oils of Syria are mentioned in a general way in the Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. XV. 11. 4, 5, pi. xvi. 1. 3 ; the King of Alasia speaks of essences which he is sending to Amenothes III. (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 6, pp. 14, 15, 11. 25, 50-53) ; the King of Mitanni refers to bottles of oil which he is forwarding to Gilukhipa (Id., ibid..

1286 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
of these objects had to pay the custom dues which were rigorously collected by
the officers of the Pharaoh. This, no doubt, was a reprisal tariff, since inde
pendent sovereigns, such as those of Mitanni, Assyria, and Babylon, were accus
tomed to impose a similar duty on all the products of Egypt.^ The latter,
indeed, supplied more than she received, for many articles which reached her
in their raw condition were, by means of native industry, worked up and
exported as ornaments, vases, and highly decorated weapons, which, in the
course of international traffic, were dispersed to all four corners of the earth.
The merchants of Babylon and Assyria had little to fear as long as they kept
within the domains of their own sovereign or in those of the Pharaoh ; but
no sooner did they venture within the borders of those turbulent states which
separated the two great powers, than they were exposed to dangers at every
turn. Safe-conducts were of little use if they had not taken the additional
precaution of providing a strong escort and carefully guarding their caravan,
for the Shausu concealed in the depths of the Lebanon or the needy sheikhs
of Kharu could never resist the temptation to rob the passing traveller.^ The
victims complained to their king, who felt no hesitation in passing on their
woes to the sovereign under whose rule the pillagers were supposed to
live. He demanded their punishment, but his request was not always
granted, owing to the difficulties of finding out and seizing the offenders. An
indemnity, however, could be obtained which would nearly compensate the
merchants for the loss sustained. In many cases justice had but little to
do with the negotiations, in which self-interest w'as the chief motive ; but
repeated refusals would have discouraged traders, and by lessening the
facilities of transit, have diminished the revenue which the state drew from
its foreign commerce.
The question became a more delicate one when it concerned the rights of
subjects residing out of their native country. Foreigners, as a rule, were well
received in Egypt ; the whole country was open to them ; they could marry,
they could acquire houses and lands, they enjoyed permission to follow their own
religion unhindered, they were eligible for public honours, and more than one
of the officers of the crown whose tombs we see at Thebes were themselves

Maspeko, Etudes Egyptitnnes, vol. ii. pp. 47-50 ; and see Brugsch, Die JEgyptologie, pp. 217, 255, for the mention of the maritime custom-house. ^ The scribe who in the reign of Ramses II. composed the Travels of an Egyptian, speaks in several places of marauding tribes and robbers, who infested the roads followed by the hero {Anastasi Papyrus, No. 1, pi. XX. 11. 1-6 ; pi. xxiii. 11. 6, 7 ; pi. xxiv. 1. 8 ; pi. xxv. 1. 7, et seq.). The Tel el-Amarna correspondence contains a letter from the King of Alasia, who exculpates himself from being implicated in the harsh treatment certain Egyptians had received in passing through his territory (WinckleeAbel, Der Thontafelfund, p. 10, 11. 7-22) ; and another letter in which the King of Babylon com
plains that Clialdeean merchants had been robbed at Khinnatun, in Galilee, by the Prince of Akku (Acre) and his accomplices ; one of them had his feet cut off, and the other was still a prisoner in Akku, and Burnaburiash demands from Amenothes IV. the deatli of the guilty persons (WinckleeAbel, Der Thontafelfund, p. 7, 1. 8, et seq.).



PROTECTION GRANTED TO NATIONAL INDUSTRIES. 287
Syrians, or born of Syrian parents on tbe banks of tbe Nile2 Hence, those who
settled in Egypt without any intention of returning to their own country enjoyed
all the advantages possessed by the natives, whereas those who took up a merely
temporary abode there were more limited in their privileges. They were
granted the permission to hold property in the country, and also the right to
buy and sell there, but they were not allowed to transmit their possessions at
will, and if by chance they died on Egyptian soil, their goods lapsed as a forfeit
to the crown. The heirs remaining in the native country of the dead man, who
were ruined by this confiscation, sometimes petitioned the king to interfere in
their favour with a view of obtaining restitution. If the Pharaoh consented to
waive his right of forfeiture, and made over the confiscated objects or their
equivalent to the relatives of the deceased, it was solely by an act of mercy, and
as an example to foreign governments to treat Egyptians with a like clemency
should they chance to proffer a similar request.^ It is also not improbable that
the sovereigns themselves had a personal interest in more than one commercial
undertaking, and that they were the partners, or, at any rate, interested in the
enterprises, of many of their subjects, so that any loss sustained by one of the
latter would eventually fall upon themselves. They had, in fact, reserved to
themselves the privilege of carrying on several lucrative industries, and of
disposing of the products to foreign buyers, either to those who purchased them
out and out, or else through the medium of agents, to whom they intrusted
certain quantities of the goods for warehousing. The King of Babylon, taking
advantage of the fashion which prompted the Egyptians to acquire objects of
Chaldsean goldsmiths’ and cabinet-makers’ art, caused ingots of gold to be sent to
him by the Pharaoh, which he returned worked up into vases, ornaments, house
hold utensils, and plated chariots. He further fixed the value of all such objects,
and took a considerable commission for having acted as intermediary in the trans
action.^ In Alasia, which was the land of metals, the king appears to have held a
monopoly of the bronze. Whether he smelted it in the country, or received it from
more distant regions ready prepared, we cannot say, but he claimed and retained
for himself the payment for all that the Pharaoh deigned to order of him.^
’ See letter from the King of Alasia (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 5, p. 13, 11. 3034), where there is question of a merchant who had died in Egypt. Among other monuments proving the presence of Syrians about the Pharaoh, is the stele of Ben-Azana, of the town of Zairabizana (cf. Sayce, Correspondence between Palestine and Egypt, in tlie Records of the Past, 2nd series, vol. v. p. 99, note 1), surnamed Eamses-Empiri (Maeiettb, Ahydos, vol. ii. pi. 50, and Cat. Generate des Monuments d'Ahydos, No. 1136, pp. 422, 423): he was surrounded with Semites like himself. ^ All this seems to result from a letter in which the King of Alasia demands from Amenothes HI., the restitution of the goods of one of his subjects who had died in Egypt (Bezold-Bddge, Tell elAmarna Tablets, No. 5, p. 13, 11. 30-34, and p. xxxv. ; of. Boscawen, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, in Babyl. and Oriental Record, vol. vi. pp. 30, 31) ; the tone of the letter is that of one asking a favour, and on the supposition that the King of Egypt had a right to keep the property of a foreigner dying on his territory. * Letter of Burnaburiash to Amenothes IV.

288 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
From sucli instances we can well understand the jealous watch which these
sovereigns exercised, lest any individual connected with corporations of workmen
should leave the kingdom and establish himself in another country without
special permission. Any emigrant who opened a workshop and initiated his
new compatriots in the technique or professional secrets of his craft, was regarded
by the authorities as the most dangerous of all evil-doers. By thus introducing
his trade into a rival state, he deprived his own people of a good customer, and
thus rendered himself liable to the penalties inflicted on those who were guilty
of treason. His savings were confiscated, his house razed to the ground, and his
whole family—parents, wives, and children—treated as partakers in his crime.
As for himself, if justice succeeded in overtaking him, he was punished with
death, or at least with mutilation, such as the loss of eyes and ears, or amputation
of the feet.^ This severity did not prevent the frequent occurrence of such
cases, and it was found necessary to deal with them by the insertion of a special
extradition clause in treaties of peace and other alliances. The two contracting
parties decided against conceding the right of habitation to skilled workmen
who should take refuge with either party on the territory of the other, and they
agreed to seize such workmen forthwith, and mutually restore them, but
under the express condition that neither they nor any of their belongings should
incur any penalty for the desertion of their country. It would be curious
to know if all the arrangements agreed to by the kings of those times were
sanctioned, as in the above instance, by properly drawn up agreements. Certain
expressions occur in their correspondence which seem to prove that this was the
case, and that the relations between them, of which we can catch traces, resulted
not merely from a state of things which, according to their ideas, did not neces
sitate any diplomatic sanction, but from conventions agreed to after some war,
or entered on without any previous struggle, when there was no question at
issue between the two states.^ When once the Syrian conquest had been
effected, Egypt gave permanency to its results by means of a series of inter
national decrees, which officially established the constitution of her empire,
and brought about her concerted action with the Asiatic powers.

buried, probably, at Heir el-Bahari, in the family tomb wherein
the most illustrious members of his house had been laid
rest since the time of Thutmosis I. His mummy was
not securely hidden away, for towards the close of the
XX*^ dynasty it was torn out of the coffin by robbers, who
stripped it and rifled it of the jewels Avith which it was
covered, injuring it in their haste to carry away the spoil.
It was subsequently re-interred, and has remained undis
turbed until the present day ; but before re-burial some
renovation of the wrappings was necessary, and as portions
of the body had become loose, the restorers, in order to
give the mummy the necessary firmness, compressed it
between four oar-shaped slips of wood, painted white.

that the artists have idealised their model. The forehead is abnormally low,

extremely prominent ; the whole recalling the physiognomy of Thutmosis II.,

firmness and vigour.® Amenothes II., who succeeded him, must have closely

Dr. Mahler (Konig Thutmosis III., in the Zeitschrift, 1889, pp. 97-105) has, with great precision, fixed the date of the accession of Thutmosis III. as the 20th of March, 1503, and that of his death as the 14th of February, 1449 b.c. I have mentioned {Dawn of Civilization, jip. 209, 210) the reasons which seem to me to make the application of astronomical calculations to Egyptian dates difficult. I do not think that the data furnished to Dr. Mahler by Brugsch will adrnit of such exact conclusions being drawn from them, and I should fix the fifty-four years of the reign of Thutmosis III. in a less decided manner, between 1550 and 1490 n.c., allowing, as I have said before, for an error of half a century more or less in the dates which go back to the time of the second Theban empire. ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the photograph taken by Emil Brugsch-Bey in 1881 ; cf.

resembled him, if we may trust bis official por
traits. He was the son of a princess of the
blood, Hatshopsitu II., daughter of the great
HatshopsitiV and consequently he came into
his inheritance with stronger claims to it than
any other Pharaoh since the time of Ameno
thes I. Possibly his father may have associated
him with himself on the throne as soon as
the young prince attained his majority ; ^ at
any rate, his accession aroused no appreciable
opposition in the country, and if any diffi
culties were made, they must have come from
outside. It is always a dangerous moment
in the existence of a newly formed empire
when its founder having passed away, and
the conquered people not having yet become
accustomed to a subject condition, they are
called upon to submit to a successor of
IS
whom they know little or nothing. It
always problematical whether the new sovereign will display as great activity
and be as successful as the old one ; whether he will be capable of turning
to good account the armies which his predecessor commanded with such
skill, and led so bravely against the enemy; whether, again, he will have
sufficient tact to estimate correctly the burden of taxation which each
province is capable of bearing, and to lighten it when there is a risk of its
becoming too heavy. If be does not show from the first that it is his purpose
to maintain his patrimony intact at all costs, or if his officers, no longer con
trolled by a strong hand, betray any indecision in command, his subjects will
become unruly, and the change of monarch will soon furnish a pretext for wide
spread rebellion. The beginning of the reign of Amenothes II. was marked by a
revolt of the Libyans inhabiting the Theban Oasis, but this rising was soon put
down by that Amenemhabi who had so distinguished himself under Thutmosis.^
' His parentage is proved by the pictures preserved in tlie tomb of his foster-father, where he is. represented in company with the rorjal mother, Marilri Hatshopsitu (CHASiroLi.iON, Monuments, pi. clx. 2 ; Lepsids, Denltm., iii. 62 b, c ; cf. pi. 64 a). * It is thus that Wiedemaun {Aigyptische Geschichte, p. 675), explains his presence by the side of Thutmosis' III. on certain bas-reliefs in the temple of Amada (Champollion, Monuments, pis.

Gre'baut, and taken in 1800 by Emil BrugschBey ; cf. the statue of the king on p. 255 of the present volume. * Inscription of Amenemhabi, 11. 39-42. Brugsch {Geschichte zEgyptens, p. 388) and Wiedemann {2Egyp. Gesch., p. 374) place this expedition at the time when Amenothes If. was either hereditary prince or associated with his father; the inscription of Amenemhabi places it explicitly after the death of Thutmosis III., and this evidence outweighs every other consideration until further discoveries are made.

the partisans of the Egyptian government had suffered persecution from a
considerable section of the natives, order was at once re-established as soon as
the king’s approach was made known. No doubt the rapidity of his marches
and the vigour of his attacks, while putting an end to the hostile attitude of
the smaller vassal states, were effectual in inducing the sovereigns of Alasia,
of Mitanni,^ and of the Hittites to renew with Amenothes the friendly relations
which they had established w'ith his father.^ This one campaign, which lasted
three or four months, secured a lasting peace in the north, but in the south
a disturbance again broke out among the Barbarians of the Upper Nile.
Amenothes suppressed it,^ and, in order to prevent a repetition of it, was
guilty of an act of cruel severity quite in accordance with the manners of the
time. He had taken prisoner seven chiefs in the country of Tikhisa, and had
brought them, chained, in triumph to Thebes, on the forecastle of his ship.
He sacrificed six of them himself before Amon, and exposed their heads and
hands on the fapade of the temple of Karnak ; the seventh was subjected to a
similar fate at Napata at the beginning of his third year, and thenceforth the
sheikhs of Kush thought twice before defying the authority of the Pharaoh.'*
Amenothes’ reign was a short one, lasting ten years at most,® and the end
of it seems to have been darkened by the open or secret rivalries which the
question of the succession usually stirred up among the kings’ sons. The
king had daughters only by his marriage with one of his full sisters, who
like himself possessed all the rights of sovereignty ; those of his sons who
did not die young were the children of princesses of inferior rank or of
concubines, and it was a subject of anxiety among these princes which of
them would be chosen to inherit the crown and be united in marriage
with the king’s heiresses, Khuit and Mutemuau. One of his sons, named
* Ameuutlies II. mentions tribute from Mitauni on one of the columns which he decorated at Ivarnak, in the Hall of the Caryatides, close to the pillars finished by his predecessors (E. and J. de Rouge, Insn-iptions h-ie'roglijpJiiqnes, pi. clxxvii. 1. 1 ; Piekl, Sur I’Origine des colonnes de la Salle des Caryatides du Grand Temple de Karnali, in the Actes du Congres de Leyden, 4tli part, pp. 213, 216). - Tlie cartouches on the pedestal of the throne of Amenothes II., in the tomb of one of his ofiScers

Thfitmosis, wlio resided at the “ White Wall,” was in the habit of betaking
himself frequently to the Libyan desert to practise with the javelin, or to
pursue the hunt of lions and gazelles in hi's chariot. On these occasions it
was his pleasure to preserve the strictest incognito, and he was accompanied
by two discreet servants only. One day, when chance had brought him into
the neighbourhood of the Great Pyramid, he lay down for his accustomed
siesta iu the shade cast by the Sphinx, the miraculous image of Khopri the
most powerful, the god to whom all men in Memphis and the neighbouring
towns raised adoring hands filled with offerings. The gigantic statue
was at that time more than half buried, and its head alone was seen
above the sand. As soon as the prince was asleep it spoke gently to him, as
a father to his son : “ Behold me, gaze on me, 0 my son Thutmosis, for I, thy
father Harmakhis-Khopri-Tumu, grant thee sovereignty over the two countries,
in both the South and the North, and thou slialt wear both the white and the
red crown on the throne of Sibu, the sovereign, possessing the earth in its
length and breadth ; the flashing eye of the lord of all shall cause to rain
on thee the possessions of Egypt, vast tribute from all foreign countries, and
a long life for many years as one chosen by the Sun, for my countenance is
thine, my heart is thine, no other than thyself is mine ! Now am I covered
by the sand of the mountain on which I rest, and have given thee this prize
that thou mayest do for me what my heart desires, for I know that thou
art my son, my defender; draw nigh, I am with thee, I am thy well-beloved
father.” The prince understood that the god promised him the kingdom on
condition of his swearing to clear the sand from the statue. He was, in fact,
chosen to be the husband of the queens, and immediately after his accession
he fulfilled his oath ; he removed the sand, built a chapel between the
paws, and erected against the breast of the statue a stele of red granite, on
which he related his adventure.^ His reign was as short as that of Amenothes,
and his campaigns both in Asia and Ethiopia were unimportant.^ He had
succeeded to an empire so firmly established from Naharaim to Kari,^ that,

The importance of this text in determining the position of Thutmosis IV. in the family of Auienuthes II. has not been generally recognised. 2 The latest date of his reign at present known is that of the year VII., on the rocks of Konosso (Champollion, Monuments, vol. i. p. 164; Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 69 a), and on a stele of Sarhut elKbadim (in the Survey of Sinai, Text,p. 188).

turb its peace. One
of the two heiress
princesses, Khuit, the
daughter, sister, and wife of a king, had no living male offspring, but her
companion Mutemuaii had at least one son, named Amenothes. In his case,
again, the noble birth of the mother atoned for the defects of the paternal
origin. Moreover, according to tradition, Amon-Ka himself had intervened to
renew the blood of his descendants : he appeared in the person of Thutmosis
IV., and under this guise became the father of the heir of the Pharaohs.'^

The manner in which she is represented at Luxor, and in all the texts where she figures, proves not only that she was of Egyptian race, but that she was the daughter of Amenothes II., and born of the marriago of that prince with one of his sisters, who was herself an hereditary princess.

provinces to his empire, as to prevent disturbances in the old ones. The kings
of Alasia, of the Khati, of Mitanni, of Singar,^ of Assyria, and of Babylon did not
dare to provoke so powerful a neighbour.* The remembrance of the victories
of Thutmosis III. was still fresh in their memories, and, even had their hands
been free, would have made them cautious in dealing with his great-grandson;
but they were incessantly engaged in internecine quarrels, and had recourse to

The long list of names of African peoples, engraved on the base of the colossus A IS in the Louvre, belonged to the Pharaoh of the XIP'' dynasty, who erected the statue (cf. Masfero, Dawn of Civilization, p. 491); Amenothes III. usurped it, probably because his campaigns had led him into the countries inhabited by the same peoples.

neutrality, and prevent him from joining their adversaries. Whatever might
have been the nature of
their private sentiments,
they professed to be anxious
to maintain, for their mu
tual interests, the relations
with Egypt entered on
half a century before, and
as the surest method of
attaining their object was
by a good marriage, they
would each seek an Egyp
tian wife for himself, or
would offer Amenothes a
princess of one of their
own royal families. The
Egyptian king was, how
ever, firm in refusing to
bestow a princess of the
solar blood even on the
most powerful of the foreign
kings ; his pride rebelled at the thought that she might one day be consigned
to a place among the inferior wives or concubines, but he gladly accepted,
and even sought for wives for himself, from among the Syrian and Chaldaean
princesses.^ Kallimmasin of Babylon gave Amenothes first his sister, and
when age had deprived this princess of her beauty, then his daughter
Irtabi in marriage.® Sutarna of Mitanni had in the same way given the
Pharaoh his daughter Gilukhipa ;
^ indeed, most of the kings of that period
had one or two relations in the harem at Thebes. This connexion usually
proved a support to the Asiatic sovereigns, such alliances being a safeguard

were the means of exposing them to serious dangers. When Sutarna died he
was succeeded by his son Dushratta, but a numerous party put forward
another prince, named Artassumara, who was probably Gilukhipa’s brother,
on the mother’s side ;
^ a Hittite king of the name of Pirkhi espoused the
cause of the pretender, and a civil war broke out. Dushratta was victtrious,
and caused Ids brother to be strangled, but was not without anxiety as to the
consequences which might follow this execution
should Gilukhipa desire to avenge the victim, and
to this end stir up the anger of the suzerain
against him. Dushratta, therefore, wrote a humble

a decisive blow to save his own life ; the
tablet was accompanied by various presents
to the royal pair, comprising horees, slaves,

bore Dushratta no ill-will, and the latter’s
anxieties were allayed. The so-called expe

endeavoured to perfect the military organisation which had rendered the
conquest of the East so easy a matter. A census, undertaken by his minister
Amenothes, the son of Hapi, ensured a more correct assessment of the taxes,
and a regular scheme of recruiting for the army. Whole tribes of slaves
were brought into the country by means of the border raids which were
always taking place, and their opportune arrival helped to fill up the vacancies
which repeated wars had caused among the rural and urban population; such
a strong impetus to agriculture was also given by this importation, that when,
towards the middle of the reign, the minister Khamhait presented the tax
gatherers at court, he was able to boast that he had stored in the State
granaries a larger quantity of corn than had been gathered in for thirty years.^
The traffic carried on between Asia and the Delta by means of both Egyptian
and foreign ships was controlled by custom-houses erected at the mouths of
the Nile, the coast being protected by cruising vessels against the attacks
of pirates. The fortresses of the isthmus and of the Libyan border, having
been restored or rebuilt, constituted a check on the turbulence of the nomad
tribes, while garrisons posted at intervals at the entrance to the Wadys leading
to the desert restrained, the plunderers scattered between the Nile and the
Ked Sea, and between the chain of Oases and the unexplored regions of the
Sahara.^ at once the most powerful as well as the most prosperous
kingdom in the world, being able to command more labour and more precious
metals for the embellishment of her towns and the construction of her monu
ments than any other.
Public works had been carried on briskly under Thutmosis III. and his
successors. The taste for building, thwarted at first by the necessity of
financial reforms, and then by that of defraying the heavy expenses incurred
through the expulsion of the Hyksos and the earlier foreign wars, had free
scope as soon as spoil from the Syrian victories began to pour in year by year.
While the treasure seized from the enemy provided the money, the majority
of the prisoners were used as workmen, so that temples, palaces, and citadels
began to rise as if by magic from one end of the valley to the other.® Nubia,
divided into provinces, formed merely an extension of the ancient feudal Egypt

at any rate as far as the neighbourhood of the Tacazzeh—though the Egyptian
religion had here assumed a peculiar character. The conquest of Nubia having
been almost entirely the work of the Theban dynasties, the Theban triad,
Amon, Maut, and Month, and their immediate followers were paramount in
this region, while in the north, in witness of the ancient Elephantinite coloni
sation, we find Khnumu of the cataract being worshipped, in connexion with
Didun, father of the indigenous Nubians.^ The worship of Amon had been
the means of introducing that of Ra and of Horus, and Osiris as lord of the
dead, while Phtah, Sokhit, Atumu, and the Memphite and Heliopolitan gods

were worshipped only in isolated parts of the province. A being, however,
of less exalted rank shared with the lords of heaven the favour of the people.
This was the Pharaoh, who as the son of Amon was foreordained to receive
divine honours, sometimes figuring, as at Bohani, as the third member of a
A.
triad, at other times as head of the Ennead. Usirtasen III. had had his chapels
at Semneh and at Kummoh,^ tli^y were restored by Thutmosis III., who
claimed a share of the worship offered in them, and whose son, Amenothes

spot now known as Soleb, built a temple there, of which he himself was the
protecting genius.^ The edifice was of considerable size, and the columns and
walls remaining reveal an art as perfect as that shown in the best monuments
at Thebes. It was approached by an avenue of ram-headed sphinxes, while
colossal statues of lions and hawks, the sacred animals
of the district, adorned the building. The sovereign
condescended to preside in person at its dedication on
one of his journeys to the southern part of his empire,
and the mutilated pictures still visible on the
fapade show the order and detail of the ceremony
observed on this occasion. The king, with the
crown upon his head, stood before the centre gate,
accompanied by the queen and his minister Ame
nothes, the son of Hapi, who was better
acquainted than any other man of his
time with the mysteries of the ritual.^
The king then struck the door twelve
times with his mace of white
stone, and when the approach
to the first hall was opened,
he repeated the operation at
the threshold of the sanctuary
previous to entering and placiug
his statue there. He deposited one of the basis of asienothes m.’
it on the painted and gilded
wooden platform on which the gods were exhibited on feast-days, and
enthroned beside it the other images which were thenceforth to constitute
the local Ennead, after which he kindled the sacred fire before them. The
queen, with the priests and nobles, all bearing torches, then passed through
the halls, stopping from time to time to perform acts of purification, or to
recite formulas to dispel evil spirits and pernicious influences; fin ally^ a

Amenothes III. bimself, or rather one of his statues animated by his double,
who occupied the chief place in the new building. Indeed, wherever we
come across a temple in Nubia dedicated to a king, Ave find the homage of the
inhabitants always offered to the image of the founder, which spoke to them
in oracles.^ All the southern part of the country beyond the second cataract
is full of traces of Amenothes, and the evidence of the veneration shown to
liim would lead us to conclude that he played an important part in the
organisation of the country, Sedeinga possessed a small temple under the
patronage of his wife Tii.^ The ruins of a sanctuary which he dedicated
to Amon, the Sun-god, have been discovered at Gebel-Barkal ; Amenothes
seems to have been the first to perceive the advantages offered by the site,
and to have endeavoured to transform the barbarian village of Napata into
a large Egyptian city. Some of the monuments Avith Avhich he adorned Soleb
Avere transported, in later times, to Gebel-Barkal, among them some rams
and lions of rare beauty. They lie at rest Avith their paws crossed, the head
erect, and their expression suggesting both poAver and repose.^ As Ave descend
the Nile, traces of the AA’ork of this king are less frequent, and their place
is taken by those of his predecessors, as at Sai,® at Semneh,*^ at Wady Halfa,'^
at Amada,® at Ibiim,^ and at Dakkeh.^'^ Distinct traces of Amenothes again

curved cornice,
rested on a hollow substructure raised rather more than six feet above the
ground, and surrounded by a breast-high parapet. A portico ran round the
building, having seven square pillars on each of its two sides, while at
each end stood two columns having lotus-shaped capitals ; a flight of ten
or twelve steps between two walls of the same height as the basement,
projected in front, and afforded access to the cella. The two columns of
the fagade were further apart than those at the opposite end of the
building, and showed a glimpse of a richly decorated door, while a second
door opened under the peristyle at the further extremity. The walls were
covered with the half-brutish profile of the good Khnumu, and those of
his two companions, Anukit and Satit, the spirits of stormy waters. The
treatment of these figures was broad and simple, the style free, light, and
graceful, the colouring soft; and the harmonious beauty of the whole is
unsurpassed by anything at Thebes itself. It was, in fact, a kind of oratory,
built on a scale to suit the capacities of a decaying town, but the design
was so delicately conceived in its miniature proportions that nothing more
graceful can be imagined.^

The two buildings of Amenothes III. at Elephantine were still in existence at the beginning of the present century.

304 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
Ancient Egypt and its feudal cities, Ombos,^ Edfu,^ Nekbalit,® Esneh,^
Medamot,® Coptos,® Denderali,’ Abydos,® Memphis,^ and Heliopolis,“ profited
largely by the generosity of the Pharaohs, Since the close of the XIP**
dynasty these cities had depended entirely on their own resources, and their
public buildings were either in ruins, or quite inadequate to the needs of the
population, but now gold from Syria and Kiish furnished them with the means
of restoration. The Delta itself shared in this architectural revival, but it had
suffered too severely under the struggle between the Theban kings and the
Shepherds to recover itself as quickly as the remainder of the country. All
effort was concentrated on those of its nomes which lay on the Eastern
frontier, or which were crossed by the Pharaohs in their journeys into Asia,
such as the Bubastite and Athribite nomes ; the rest remained sunk in their
’ BuildiDgs of Thutmosis III. at Ombos (Champollion, Monuments, vol. i. pp. 231, 232, 247 Rosellini, Monu.

canals which watered the plain. The monuments in these two new quarters
of the town were unworthy of the city of which they now formed part, and
Amenothes III. consequently bestowed much pains on improving them. He
entirely rebuilt the sanctuary of Maut, enlarged the sacred lake, and collected
within one of the courts of the temple several hundred statues in black granite

his Theban goddess.^ The statues were crowded together so closely that they

barbarous usage, and hardly retaining any traces of the inscriptions in which
Amenothes claimed them boastingly as his work. Triumphal processions pass
ing along this route from Luxor to Karnak would at length reach the great
court before the temple of Amon, or, by turning a little to the right after
jiassing the temple of Maut, would arrive in front of the southern fapade,
near the two gilded obelisks whose splendour once rejoiced the heart of the
famous Hatshopsitu. Thutinosis III. was also determined on his part to spare
no expense to make the temple of his god of proportions suitable to the patron
of so vast an empire. Not only did he complete those portions which his pre
decessors had merely sketched out, but on the south side towards Ashiru he
also built a long row of pylons, now half ruined, on which he engraved, according
to custom, the list of nations and cities which he had subdued in Asia and

Africa. To the east of the temple he rebuilt
some ancient structures, the largest of
which served as a halting-place for
processions, and he enclosed the whole
with a stone rampart. The outline of the sacred lake, on which the mystic boats
were launched on the nights of festivals, was also made more symmetrical, and
its margin edged with masonry.^ By these alterations the harmonious pro
portion between the main buildings and the facade had been destroyed, and the
exterior wall was now too wide for the pylon at the entrance. Amenothes III.
remedied this defect by erecting in front a fourth pylon, which was loftier,
larger, and in all respects more worthy to stand before the enlarged temple.
Its walls were partially covered with battle-scenes, which informed all be
holders of the glory of the conqueror.^
Progress had been no less marked on the left bank of the river. As long
as Thebes had been merely a small provincial town, its cemeteries had covered
but a moderate area, including the sandy plain and low mounds opposite
Karnak and the valley of Deir el-Bahari beyond ; but now that the city had
more than doubled its extent, the space required for the dead was propor
tionately greater. The tombs of private persons began to spread towards
the south, and soon reached the slopes of the Assassif, the hill of Sheikh
Abd-el-Qurnah and the district of Qurnet-Murrai— in fact, all that part which

the people of the country called the “ Brow ” of Thebesd On the borders of the
cultivated land a row of chapels and mastabas with pyramidal roofs sheltered
the remains of the princes and princesses of the royal family. The Pharaohs
themselves were buried either separately under their respective brick pyramids
or in groups in a temple, as was the case with the first three Thutmosis and
Hatshopsitu at Deir el-Bahari. Amenothes 11. and Thutmosis IV. could doubt
less have found room in this crowded necropolis,^ although the space was
becoming limited, but the pride of the Pharaohs began to rebel against this
promiscuous burial side by side with their subjects. Amenothes III. sought
for a site, therefore, where he would have ample room to display his mag
nificence, far from the vulgar crowd, and found wliat he desired at the further
end of the valley which opens out behind the village of Qurnah. Here, an
hour’s journey from the bank of the Nile, he cut for himself a magnificent
rock-tomb with galleries, halls, and deep pits, the walls being decorated
with representations of the Voyage of the Sun through the regions which
he traverses during the twelve hours of his nocturnal course. A sarcophagus
of red granite received his mummy, and Ushabtis of extraordinary dimensions
and admirable workmanship mounted guard around him, so as to release
him from the corvee in the fields of lalu.^ The chapel usually attached to
such tombs is not to be found in the neighbourhood. As the road to the
funeral valley was a difficult one, and as it would be unreasonable to condemn
an entire priesthood to live, in solitude, the king decided to separate the
component parts which had hitherto been united in every tomb since the
Memphite period, and to place the vault for the mummy and the passages
leading to it some distance aw'ay in the mountains, while the necessary
buildings for the cultus of the statue and the accommodation of the priests
were transferred to the plain, and were built at the southern extremity of
the lands which were at that time held by private persons.^ The divine
character of Amenothes, ascribed to him on account of his solar origin
and the co-operation of Amon-Ra at his birth, was, owing to this separation
of the funerary constituents, brought into further prominence. When once

from sight, the people soon became accustomed to think only of his Double
enthroned in the recesses of the sanctuary: seeing him receive there the

completed the ruin of Thebes in the year 27 b.c. The upper part toppled over
with the shock, and was dashed to pieces on the floor of the court, while the
lower half remained in its place. Soon after the disaster it began to be
rumoured that sounds like those produced by the breaking of a harp-string
proceeded from the pedestal at sunrise, whereupon travellers flocked to witness
the miracle, and legend soon began to take possession of the giant who
spoke in this marvellous way. In vain did the Egyptians of the neigh
bourhood declare that the statue represented the Pharaoh Amenothes; the
Greeks refused to believe them, and forthwith recognised in the colossus an
image of Memnon the Ethiopian, son of Tithonus and Aurora, slain by their
own Achilles beneath the walls of Troy—maintaining that the music heard
every morning was the clear and harmonious voice of the hero saluting his
mother. Towards the middle of the second century of our era, Hadrian
undertook a journey to Upper Egypt, and heard the wonderful song ; sixty
years later, Septimus Severus restored the statue by the employment of
courses of stones, which were so arranged as to form a rough representation
of a human head and shoulders. His piety, however, was not rewarded as
he expected, for Memnon became silent, and his oracle fell into obliviond
The temple no longer exists, and a few ridges alone mark the spot where
it rose ; but the two colossi remain at their post, in the same condition
in which they were left by the Eoman Csesar : the features are quite
obliterated, and the legs and the supporting female figures on either side are
scored all over with Greek and Latin inscriptions expressing the apprecia
tion of ancient tourists. Although the statues tower high above the fields
of corn and hersim which surround them, our first view of them, owing to
the scale of proportion observed in their construction, so different from that
to which we are accustomed, gives us the impression that they are smaller
than they really are, and it is only when we stand close to one of them and
notice the insignificant appearance of the crowd of sightseers clustered on its
pedestal that we realize the immensity of the colossi.
The descendants of Ahmosis had by their energy won for Thebes not only
the supremacy over the peoples of Egypit and of the known world, but had
also secured for the Theban deities pre-eminence over all their rivals. The
booty collected both in Syria and Ethiopia went to enrich the god Amon as
much as it did the kings themselves ; every victory brought him the tenth part
of the spoil gathered on the field of battle, of the tribute levied on vassals, and
of the prisoners taken as slaves. When Thutmosis III., after having reduced

Amenothes 11., Thutmosis IV., and Amenothes III., the patrimony of the Theban
priesthood continued to increase.^ The Pharaohs, perpetually called upon as
they were to recompense one or other of their servants, were never able to retain
for long their share of the spoils of war. Gold and silver, lands, jewels, and
slaves passed as quickly out of their hands as they had fallen into them,
and although their fortune was continually having additions made to it in
every fresh campaign, yet the increase was rarely in proportion to the trouble
expended. The god, on the contrary, received what he got for all time, and

addition of vineyards, and with his palm forests he combined fish-ponds full of
fish ; he added farms and villages to those he already possessed, and each
reign saw the list of his possessions increased He had his own labourers, his
own tradespeople, his own fishermen, soldiers, and scribes, and, presiding over
all these, a learned hierarchy of divines, priests, and prophets, who administered
everything. This immense domain,^ which was a kind of State within the
State, was ruled over by a single high priest, chosen by the sovereign from
among the prophets. He was the irresponsible head of it, and his spiritual
ambition had increased step by step with the extension of his material
resources. As the human Pharaoh showed himself entitled to homage from
the lords of the earth, the priests came at length to the conclusion that Amon
had a right to the allegiance of the lords of heaven, and that he was the
Supreme Being, in respect of whom the others were of little or no account,
and as he was the only god who was everywhere victorious, he came at length
to be regarded by them as the only god in existence. It was impossible that
the kings could see this rapid development of sacerdotal power without
anxiety, and with all their devotion to the patron of their city, solicitude
for their own authority compelled them to seek elsewhere for another divinity,
whose influence might in some degree counterbalance that of Amon. The
only one who could vie with him at Thebes, either for the antiquity of his
worship or for the rank which he occupied in the public esteem, was the Sun
lord of Heliopolis, head of the first Ennead. Thutmosis IV. owed his crown
to him, and displayed his gratitude in clearing away the sand from the Sphinx,
in which the spirit of Harmakhis was considered to dwell ; ^ and Amenothes
III., although claiming to be the son of Amon himself, inherited the dis
position shown by Thutmosis in favour of the Heliopolitan religions, but
instead of attaching himself to the forms most venerated by theologians, he
bestowed his affection on a more popular deity—Atonu, the fiery disk.^ He

may have been influenced in his choice by private reasons. Like his pre
decessors, he had taken, while still very young, wives
from among his own family, but neither these
reasonable ties, nor his numerous diplomatic
alliances with foreign princesses, were enough
for him. From the very beginning of his
reign he had loved a maiden who was not of
the blood of the Pharaohs, Tii, the daughter
of luia and his wife Tuia.^ Connexions of
this kind had been frequently formed by
his ancestors, but the Egyptian women of
inferior rank whom they had brought into
their harems had always remained in the
background, and if the sons of these concu
bines were ever fortunate enough to come to
the throne, it was in default of heirs of pure
blood. Amenothes III. married Tii, gave her for
her dowry the town of Zalu in Lower Egypt,^ and marriage scARABaius.'^
raised her to the position of queen, in spite of her
low extraction. She busied herself in the affairs of State, took precedence of
tonu’s reform was an attempt to establish a monotheistic religion in Egypt (Tiele, GescMchte der Eeligion im AUertum, vol. i. pp. 84-92 ; Breasted, De Hymnis in Solem, pp. G-9). ’ For the last thirty years Queen Tii has been the subject of many hypotheses and of much confusion. The scarabsei engraved under Amenothes III. (Kosellini, Mon. Star., pi. sliv. 1, and vol. iii. pt. 1, pp. 260-268; cf. Birch, Scarahxi of Amenophis III., in the Records of the Past, 1st series, p. 39) say explicitly that she was the daughter of two personages, luia and Tuia, but these names are not accompanied by any of the signs which are characteristic of foreign names, and were considered Egyptian by contemporaries. Hincks was the first who seems to have believed her to be a Syrian he compares her father’s name with that of Levi, and attributes the religious revolution which followed to the influence of her foreign education. This theory has continued to predominate ; it is found in Mariette, Apergu de I’Histoire d'Egypte, edit, of 1874, pp. 70, 71 ; in Brugsch, Geschichte E!gypiens, p. 418; and in Laeth, Aus A^gyptens Vorzeit, p. 268. Wiedemann, Mgyptisclie Geschichte, pp. 393, 394, and Ed. Meyer, Geschichte des Alten Aigyptens, p. 260, prefer a Libyan origin to the Asiatic one, and latterly there has been an attempt to recognise in Tii one of the princesses of Mitanni mentioned in the correspondence of Tel el-Amarna (Budge, On Cuneiform Despatches, in the Proceedings Soc. Bibl. Arch., 1887-88, vol. x. pp. 555, 556; Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, p. 40). As long ago as 1877, I showed at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes that Tii was an Egyptian of middle rank, probably of Heliopolitan origin, and pointed out shortly the reasons for this opinion given in Eayet, Les Monuments de V Art Antigue, vol. i.. Notice 7, in the Rapport sur une Mission en Italic {Recueil de Travaux, vol. iii. pp. 127, 128), and finally in the Revue Critique, 1893, vol. i. pp. 422, 423; they have been further developed by Bouriant, Le Tomheau de Ramses a Chdikh Ahd-el-Kournah (in the Revue Archiblogique, 1882, vol. xliii. p. 279, et seq.), and A Thebes (in the Eecueil, vol. vi. pp. 51-55), and partially adopted by Ed.

the princesses of the solar family, and appeared at her husband’s side in
public ceremonies, and was so figured on the monuments. If, as there is
reason to believe, she was born near Heliopolis, it is easy to understand how
her influence may have led Amenothes to pay special honour to a Heliopolitan
divinity. He had built, at an early period of his reign, a sanctuary to Atonu
at Memphis,^ and in the X*’* year he constructed for him a chapel at Thebes
itself,^ to the south of the last pylon of Thutmosis III., and endowed this deity
with property at the expense of Amon.
He had several sons ; ^ but the one who succeeded him, and who, like him,
was named Amenothes, was the most paradoxical of all the Egyptian sovereigns
of ancient times.^ He made up for the inferiority of his birth, on account of
the plebeian origin of his mother Tii,^ by his marriage with Nofrititi, a princess
of the pure solar race.*^ Tii, long accustomed to the management of affairs,
* Mariette, Honuments divers, pi. 50 h, and p. 18, wliere the collective representations, and above all the presence of the name of Amon, show that the stele belongs to the reign of Amenothes III. - This temple seems to have been raised on the site of the building marked S (E. de Rouge, Etude sur les monuments du Massif de Kama!;, in the Melanges d’Archeologie, etc., vol. i. pp. 42-45 ; Mariette, Karnal:, pi. 1, A-D, and Texte, pp. 11, 12), which is usually attributed to Amenothes II. and Amenothes III. The blocks bearing the name of Amenothes II. had been used previously, like most of those which bear the cartouches of Amenothes III. The temple of Atontt, which was demolished by Harmhabi or one of the Ramses, was subse(iuently rebuilt with the remains of earlier edifices, and dedicated to Amon. ^ One of them, Thutmosis, was high priest of Thtah (Mariette, Uenseignements sur les soixantequatre Apis, in Bull. Arch, de VAtlidn. Frangais, 1855, p. 53), and we possess several monuments erected by him in the temple of Memphis (Daressy, Notes et llemarques, in the Recueil, vol. xiv. pp. 174, 175) ; another, Tfitonkhainon, subsequently became king (cf. pp. 334, 335 of the present volume). He also
had several daughters by Tii — Sitamon (Birch, On a llemarhahle Object of the Reign of Amenophis ITT., p. 3 ; cf. Rosellini, Mon. Star., vol. i. p. 240), Isis, and Honitmarhabi (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 86 a, b). * The absence of any cartouches of Amenothes IV. or his successors in the table of Abydos prevented Champollion and Rosellini from classifying these sovereigns with any precision. Nestor L’hote tried to recognise in the first of them, whom he called Bakheu-Bakhnan, a king belonging to the very ancient dynasties, ptrhaps the Hyksos Apakhnan (Lettres e'crites d'Egyple, pp. 55, 56, 66, 67, 60-72), but Lepsius {Briefe atis AUgypttn,^)^. 100, 101) and Hincks (On the defacement of Egyptian Monuments, pp. 5-9) showed that he must be placed between Amenothes III. and Harmhabi, that he was first called Amenothes like his father, but that he afterwards took the name of Bakhnaten, which is now read Khunaten or Khfiniatou. His singular aspect made it difficult to decide at first whether a man or a woman was represented (Nestor L’hote, In fires dcrites d’Egypte, pp. 58,59; Bunsen, AUgyptens Stelle in der Welfgeschichte, vol. iii. pp. 88, 89). Mariette, while pronouncing him to be a man, thought that he had perhaps been taken prisoner in the Sudan and mutilated, which would have esplbined his effeminate appearance, almost like that of an eunuch {Remeignements, etc., in the Bulletin Arch., elc., 1855, p. 57). Recent attempts have been made to prove that Amenothes IV. and KhCiniaton were two distinct persons (Villiers-Stuart, A/fe Gleanings, pp. 299-301, and Egypt after the War, pp. 373-391), or that Khuniaton was a queen {LiiFKBimE, Sur Bifferents Motset Noms Egyptieus, Rroceedings, 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp. 479-483); but they have hitherto been rejected by Egyptologists. ^ The filiation of Amenothes IV. and Tii has given rise to more than one controversy. The Egyptian texts do not define it explicitly, and the title borne by Tii (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 101, 102) has been considered by some to prove that Amenothes IV. was her son (Brugsch, Gesehichte Aigyptens, pp. 419, 420; Wiedemann, AUgyptische Gesehichte, p.W\ ; Ed. Meyer, Gesehichte des Alten Mgyptens, p. 260), and by others that she was the mother of Queen Nofriliti (Wiedemann, Inscriptions of the Time of Amenophis IV., Proceedings Soe. Bibl. Arch., 1894-95, vol. xviii. pp. 156, 157). [The Tel el-Amarna correspondence solves the question, however, as it gives a letter from Dushratta to Khuniaton (trans. by Prof. Sayce in the Records of the Past, new ser.), in which Tii is called “thy
mother.”—Ed.] “ Nofriliti, the wife of Amenothes IV., like all the princesses of that time, has been supposed to

exerted her influence over him even more than she had done over her husband.
Without officially assuming the rank, she certainly for several years possessed
the power, of regent, and gave a definite Oriental impress to her son’s religious
policy. I^’o outward changes were made at first ; Amenothes, although showing
his preference for Heliopolis by inscribing in his protocol the title of prophet
of Harmakhis, which he may, however, have borne before his accession,^ main
tained his residence at Thebes, as his father had done before him, continued to
sacrifice to the Theban divinities, and to follow the ancient paths and the con
ventional practices.^ He either built a temple to the Theban god, or enlarged the
one which his father had constructed at Karnak, and even opened new quarries
at Syene and Silsileh for providing granite and sandstone for the adornment
of this monument.^ His devotion to the invincible Disk, however, soon began
to assert itself, and rendered more and more irksome to him the religious obser
vances which he had constrained himself to follow. There was nothing and no
one to hinder him from giving free course to his inclinations, and the nobles
and priests were too well trained in obedience to venture to censure anything
he might do, even were it to result in putting the whole population into
motion, from Elephantine to the sea-coast, to prepare for the intruded deity
a dwelling which should eclipse in magnificence the splendour of the great
temple. A few of those around him had become converted of their own
accord to his favourite worship, but these formed a very small minority.
Thebes had belonged to Amon so long that the king could never hope to
bring it to regard Atonu as anything but a being of inferior rank. Each
city belonged to some god, to whom was attributed its origin, its development,
be of Syrian origio, and to have change J her name on her arrival in Egypt (Lefebure, Sur Diff^rents Mots et Nome Egyytiens, in the Proceedings, 1890-91, vol. xiii. p. 478 ; Beyant-Kead, An Inscription of Khuenaten, ibid., 1892-93, vol. xv. p. 200). The place which she holds beside her husband is the same as that which belongs to legitimate queens, like Nofritari, Ahmosis, and Hatshopsitu, and the example of these princesses is enough to show us what was her real position ; she was most probably a daughter of one of the princesses of the solar blood, perhaps of one of the sisters of Amenothes III., and Amenothes IV. married her so as to obtain through her the rights which were wanting to him through his mother Tii. * Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 110 i, 1. 2. ^ The tomb of Eamses, governor of Thebes and priest of Mart, shows us in one part of it the king, still faithful to his name of Amenothes, paying homage to the god Amon, lord of Karnak (VilliehsStuaet, Egypt after the War, pi. 27, and pp. 386-388 ; Boukiant, Le Tombeau de Ramses a Cheikh Abd el-Gournah, in the Revue Arch^ologique, 1882, vol. xliii. p. 279, et seq.), while everywhere else the worship of Atonh predominates. The cartouches on the tomb of Pari, read by Bouriant Akhopiruri {Notes de Voyage, in the Recueil, vol. xiv. pp. 70, 71), and by Scheil more correctly Nofirkhopiruri {Le Tombeau de Pari, in the Mimoires de la Mission Franpaise, vol. v. p. 588), seem to me to represent a transitional form of the protocol of Amenothes IV., and not the name of a new Pharaoh ; the inscription in which they are to be found bears the date of his third year. ® Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 110 i. Of. Bbugsch, Gesch. ASgyptens, pp. 424, 425, where the value of this monument has been well shown ; the king in it still calls himself Amenothes. The remains of the temple, used later by Harmhabi, have been collected and commented on for the first time by Peisse d’Ayennes, Remarks on the Ancient Materials of the Propylssa of Karnak, in the Transactions of the Society of Literature, new series, vol. i. pp. 76-92, and Monuments Egyptiens, pis. x., xi., and

and its prosperity, and whom it could not forsake without renouncing its very
existence. If Thebes became separated from Amon it would be Thebes no
longer, and of this Amenothes was so well aware that he never attempted to
induce it to renounce its patron. His residence among surroundings which
he detested at length became so intolerable, that he resolved to leave the
place and create a new capital elsewhere. The choice of a new abode would
have presented no difficulty to him had he been able to make up his mind to
relegate Atonu to the second rank of divinities; IMemphis, Heracleopolis,
Siut, Khmunu, and, in fact, all the towns of the valley would have deemed
themselves fortunate in securing the inheritance of their rival, but not one
of them would be false to its convictions or accept the degradation of its own
divine founder, whether Phtab, Harshafitu, Anubis, or Thot. A newly pro
moted god demanded a new city ; Amenothes, therefore, made selection of a
broad plain extending on the right bank of the Nile, in the eastern part of
the Hermopolitan nome, to which he removed with all his court about the
fourth or fifth year of his reign.^ He found here several obscure villages
without any historical or religious traditions, and but thinly populated;
Amenothes chose one of them, the Et-Tel of the present day, and built
there a palace for himself and a temple for his god.^ The temple, like that
of Ea at Heliopolis, was named Hait-Banboml, the IMansion of the Obelisk.®
It covered an immense area, of which the sanctuary, however, occupied an
inconsiderable part ; it was flanked by brick storehouses, and the whole was
surrounded by a thick wall. The remains show that the temple w'as built
of white limestone, of flue quality, but that it was almost devoid of ornament,
for there was no time to cover it with the usual decorations.^ The palace was
‘ The last date with the name of Amenothes is that of the year V., on a papyrus from the Fayum (Petkie, lllahun, Kahun and Guroh,\>. 50) ; elsewhere we find from the year VI. the nameof Khuniatou (PiusSE d’Avennes, Monuments Egypiien, pis. xii.-xiv. ; Lepsius, DenJcm., iii. 1 10 5), by the side of monuments with the cartouche of Amenothes (Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, pi. xiii.) ; we may conclude from this that the foundation of the town dates from the year IV. or V. at the latest, when the prince, having renounced the worship of Amon, left Thebes that he might be able to celebrate freely that of Atonu. ‘ For the desciiption of the plain and of the ruins of Tel el-Amarna, see Jomaed, Description des Antiques de V Heptanomide, in the Description de VEgypte, vol. iv. pp. 308-312, and Nestor L’hote, Leltres Ccrites de VEgypte, pp. 53-78; and for its present condition, Villiers-Stuart, Egypt after the War, pp. 431-444, and above all, Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 1-6. The plan of it is briefly described in the Description de VEgypte, Ant., vol. iv. pi. 63, folio 6 ; iu Lepsids, Denkm., i. 63, 64, who seems to have developed the indications in the Description; and by Prisse d’Avennes, Eistoire de I’Art Egijptien, who confines himself to reproducing the data given in the Description and by Lepsius. ^ Lepsiijs, Denkm., iii. 97 b, where the king speaks of the chambers he has caused to be built and decorated in Hait-Banbonu of Pa-Atonu. * The ruins of the temple have been explored by Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 18-20, and the plan of it is given on plate xxxvii. of that work. The opinion of Brugsch {Gesch. jEgyptens, p. 421), that the arrangement of the various parts differed from that of other temples, and was the effect of foreign influence, has not been borne out by the excavations of Prof. Petrie, the little which he has brought to light being entirely of Egyptian character. The temple is represented on the tomb of the high priest Mariri (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 94-96 ; cf. Eiuian, .Egypten, pp. 387-390).

THE FOUNDATION OF EEUITATONU.
built of brick ; it was approached by a colossal gateway, and contained vast
halls, interspersed with small apartments for the accommodation of the house
hold, and storehouses for the necessary provisions, besides gardens which had
been hastily planted with rare shrubs and sycamores. Fragments of furniture
and of the roughest of the utensils contained in the different chambers are still
unearthed from among the heaps of rubbish, and the cellars especially are full
of potsherds and cracked jars, on which we can still see written an indica
tion of the reign and the year when the wine they once contained was made.
Altars of massive masonry rose in the midst of the courts, on which the king
or one of his ministers heaped offerings and burnt incense morning, noon, and
evening, in honour of the three decisive moments in the life of Atonud A
few painted and gilded columns supported the roofs of the principal apart
ments in which the Pharaoh held his audiences, but elsewhere the walls and
pillars were coated with cream-coloured stucco or whitewash, on which scenes
of private life were depicted in colours. The pavement, like the walls, was also
decorated^ In one of the halls which seems to have belonged to the harem,
* Naville discovered at Deir el-Bahari a similar altar, nearly intact {The Temple of Beir el-Bahari, pp. 10-12). No other example was before known in any of the ruined towns or temples, and no one had any idea of the dimensions to which these altars attained. * Peteie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 7-16 ; also the remains reproduced in pis, v.-xii. The plan of the palace is to be found in pi. xxxvi. of the same work.

there is still to be seen distinctly the picture of a rectangular piece of water
containing fish and lotus-tlowers in full bloom ; the edge is adorned with
water-plants and flowering shrubs, among which birds fly and calves graze
and gambol ; on the right and left were depicted rows of stands laden with
fruit, while at each end of the room were seen the grinning faces of a gang
of negro and Syrian prisoners, separated from each other by gigantic arches.
The tone of colouring is bright and cheerful, and the animals are treated
with great freedom and facility.^ The Pharaoh had collected about him
several of the best artists then to be found at Thebes, placing them under
the direction of Bauki, the chief of the corporation of sculptors,^ and probably
others subsequently joined these from provincial studios. Work for them was
not lacking, for houses had to be built for all the courtiers and government
officials who had been obliged to follow the king, and in a few years a large
town had sprung up, which was called Khuitatonu, or the “ Horizon of the
Disk.” It was built on a regular plan, with straight streets and open spaces,
and divided into two separate quarters, interspersed with orchards and shady
trellises.^ Workmen soon began to flock to the new city—metal-founders,
glass-founders, weavers ; in fine, all who followed any trade indispensable to
the luxury of a capital. The king appropriated a territory for it from the
ancient nome of the Hare, thus compelling the god Thot to contribute to
the fortune of Atonu ; he fixed its limits by means of stelae placed in the
mountains, from Gebel-Tunah to Deshluit on the west, and from Sheikh-Said
to El-Hauata on the eastern bank ;
^ it was a new nome improvised for the
divine parvenu.
Atonu was one of the forms of the Sun, and perhaps the most material
one of all those devised by the Egyptians. He was defined as “ the good
god who rejoices in truth, the lord of the solar course, the lord of the disk,
the lord of heaven, the lord of earth, the living disk which lights up the
two worlds, the living Harmakhis who rises on the horizon bearing his name
‘ The viguette ou p. 321 gives only an idea of it. To judge of the delicacy of detail and the richness of the effect, see the coloured plates in which Petrie has reproduced the principal scenes (Tell el-Amarna, pis. iii., iv.). * Bauki belonged to a family of artists, and his father Mani had filled before him the post of chief of the sculptors (Maiuette, Monuments divers, pi. 26 u). The part played by these personages was first defined by Biugtch, with perhaps some exaggeration of their artistic merit and originality of talent (Ueschichte A^gyptens, pp. 421-423). ^ Nestor L’hote, Leltres Sorites d’Egypte, pp. 76, 77, who considers them two separate towns. * We know at present of fourteen of these stelie, and the position of the principal of them will be seen in the map of tlie nome. The earliest discovered were published by Pkisse d’Avennes, Monuments Egypiiens, pis. xii.-xiv., partly from the copies made by Nestor L’hote; and others have been gradually added to tliem through the labours of Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 91, 110 a, b, of Daeessy, 2'ombeaux et Steles- Limites de Hagi-Qandil, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xv. pp. 36-62, and of Petrie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 5, 6. A certain number must still remain to be discovered on both banks of the Nile.

of Shu, which is disk, the eternal infuser of life.” ^ His priests exercised the
same functions as those of Heliopolis, and his high priest was called “ Oirimau,”
like the high priest of Ea in Aunu. This functionary was a certain IMariri,
upon whom the king showered his favours, and he was for some time the chief
authority in the State after the Pharaoh himself.^ Atonu was represented
sometimes by the ordinary figure of Horus,^ sometimes by the solar disk, but a
disk whose rays were prolonged towards the earth, like so many arms ready to
lay hold with their little hands of the offerings of the faithful, or to distribute
to mortals the crux ansata, the symbol of life. The other gods, except Amon,
were sharers with humanity in his benefits. Atonu proscribed him, and tolerated
him only at Thebes ; he required, moreover, that the name of Amon should he
effaced wherever it occurred, but he respected Ea and Horus and Harmakhis
all, in fact, but Amon : he was content with being regarded as their king, and
he strove rather to become their chief than their destroyer.^ His nature,
moreover, had nothing in it of the mysterious or ambiguous ; he was the
glorious torch which gave light to humanity, and which was seen every day
to flame in the heavens without ever losing its brilliance or becoming weaker.
When he hides himself “the world rests in darkness, like those dead who lie
in their rock-tombs, with their heads swathed, their nostrils stuffed up, their
eyes sightless, and whose whole property might he stolen from them, even
that which they have under their head, without their knowing it ; the lion
issues from his lair, the serpent roams ready to bite, it is as obscure as in a
dark room, the earth is silent whilst he who creates everything dwells in his
horizon.” He has hardly arisen when “ Egypt becomes festal, one awakens,
one rises on one’s feet ; when thou hast caused men to clothe themselves, they
adore thee with outstretched hands, and the whole earth attends to its work,
the animals betake themselves to their herbage, trees and green crops abound,
birds fly to their marshy thickets with wings outstretched in adoration of thy
double, the cattle skip, all the birds which were in their nests shake them
selves when thou risest for them ; the boats come and go, for every way is
open at thy appearance, the fish of the river leap before thee as soon as
thy rays descend upon the ocean.” It is not without reason that all living
things thus rejoice at his advent ; all of them owe their existence to him, for
“ he creates the female germ, he gives virility to men, and furnishes life to
* This is the title of Atonu, considered as god-king in Lepsius, Denhn., iii. 105 b, 107 d, 1. 1. - Some of the bas-reliefs from his tomb are reproduced in Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 97 b-e. ^ Bodriant, a Thebes, in the Eecueil de Travaux, vol. vi. p. 53. It was probably this form of
Horns whicli had, in the temple at Thebes, the statue called “ the red image of Atonu in Paatonu ” (Bouriant, Le Tombeau de Eamses a Ch^ikh-ahd-el-Gournah, p. 7). ^ Prisse d’A venues {Eemarhs on Propijlxa at Karnalc, in the 'Transactions of the Society of Literature, 2ud scries, vol. i. pp. 76-92) has found atlvarnak, on fragments of the temple, the names of other divinities than Atonii worshipped by Khuniatonii.



ATONU AND HIS WOBSHIP. 323
the infant in its mother’s womb ; he calms and stills its weeping, he nourishes
it in the maternal womb, giving forth the breathings which animate all that
he creates, and when the infant escapes from the womb on the day of its
birth, thou openest his mouth for speech, and thou satisfiest his necessities.
When the chick is in the egg, a cackle in a stone, thoii givest to it air while
within to keep it alive; when thou hast caused it to be developed in the
egg to the point of being able to break it, it goes forth proclaiming its
existence by its cackling, and walks on its feet from the moment of its leaving
the egg.” Atonu presides over the universe and arranges within it the lot of
human beings, both Egyptians and foreigners. The celestial Nile springs up
in Hades far awav in the north ; he makes its current run down to earth, and
spreads its waters over the fields during the inundation in order to nourish his
creatures. He rules the seasons, winter and summer ; he constructed the far
off sky in order to display himself therein, and to look down upon his works
below. From the moment that he reveals himself there, “ cities, towns, tribes,
routes, rivers—all eyes are lifted to him, for he is the disk of the day upon
the earth.” ^ The sanctuary in which he is invoked contains only his divine
shadow ;
^ for he himself never leaves the firmament. His worship assumes
none of the severe and gloomy forms of the Theban cults : songs resound
therein, and hymns accompanied by the harp or flute ;
^ bread, cakes, vegetables,
fruits, and flowers are associated with his rites, and only on very rare occasions
one of those bloody sacrifices in which the other gods delight. The king
made himself supreme pontiff of Atonu, and took precedence of the high
priest. He himself celebrated the rites at the altar of the god, and we see him
there standing erect, his hands outstretched, offering incense and invoking
blessings from on high."* Like the Caliph Hakim of a later age, he formed a
school to propagate his new doctrines, and preached them before his courtiers ;
if they wished to please him, they had to accept his teaching, and show
that they had profited by it.® The renunciation of the traditional religious

Arch. Soc., 1892-93, vol. xv. pp. 208, 213, 215). I think that this designation applied also to the statue or symbol of the god ; the shadoiv of a god was attached to the statue in the same manner as the “ double,” and transformed it into an animated body. ’ Choirs of singers and musicians are represented in Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 94, 9G a, 106 a; some of them seem to be blind. * Nestor L’hote, Lettres Sorites d'Fgijpte, pp. 62, 63. The altar on which the king stands upright is one of these cubes of masonry of which Naville discovered such a flue example in the temple of Hatshof.situ at Deir el-Bahaii (The Temple of Deir el-Bahari, pp. 10-12). ^ Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 107 a, 1. 10, where Tutu, the royal messenger who carried the letters of Tel el-Amarna, says that every morning he took lessons from the king, “ because of the great love which he bore to the royal teaching.” Ai affirms, moreover (ibid., 107 d, 1. 4), that his name penetrated

observances of tlie solar house involved also the rejection of such personal
names as implied an ardent devotion to the banished god ; in place of
Amenothes, “he to whom Amon is united,” the king assumed after a time
the name of Khuniatonu, “ the Glory of the Disk,” and all the members
of his family, as well as his adherents at court, whose appellations involved
the name of the same god, soon followed his example. The proscription of
Amon extended to inscriptions, so tl)at while his name or figure, wherever
either could be got at, was ehiselled out, the vulture, the emblem of Mut,
which expressed the idea of mother, was also avoided^ The king would
have nothing about him to suggest to eye or ear the remembrance of
the gods or doctrines of Thebes. It would consequently have been fatal
to them and their pretensions to the primacy of Egypt if the reign of
the young king had continued as long as might naturally have been ex
pected. After having been for nearly two centuries almost the national
liead of Africa, Amon was degraded by a single blow to the secondary rank
and languishing existence in which he had lived before the expulsion of the
Hyksos. He had surrendered his sceptre as king of heaven and earth, not
to any of his rivals who in old times had enjoyed the highest rank, but
to an individual of a lower order, a sort of demigod, while he himself had
thus become merely a local deity, confined to the corner of the Said in
which he had had his origin. There was not even left to him the peaceful
possession of this restricted domain, for he was obliged to act as host to
the enemy who had deposed him : the temple of Atonu was erected at the
door of his own sanctuary, and without leaving their courts the priests of
Amon could hear at the hours of worship the chants intoned by hundreds of
heretics in the temple of the Disk. Amon’s priests saw, moreover, the royal
gifts flowing into other treasuries, and the gold of Syria and Ethiopia no longer
came into their hands. Should they stifle their complaints, and bow to this
insulting oppression, or should they raise a protest against the action which had
condemned them to obscurity and a restricted existence ? If they had given
indications of resistance, they would have been obliged to submit to prompt
repression, but we see no sign of this. The bulk of the people—clerical as well
as lay — aceepted the deposition with complacency, and the nobles hastened to
into the palace owing to the zeal with which he applied himself “ to hear the doctrine ” of the king. Khuniatonu, speaking elsewhere to the high priest Mariii, calls him “ my servant sotmu dshu— who hears the doctrine ” (Id., ibid., 97). Other expressions of a similar kind are found in many of the inscriptions in the tombs at Tel el-Amarna, leaving no doubt in the mind as to the proselytising spirit which animated the prince. The Caliph Hakim seems to me, of all known individuals, to resemble Khuniatonu the most, both in his character and in the role he played ; his reign seems to have reproduced in Mahometan Egypt that of Khuniatonh in the Egypt of the Pharaohs. ‘ Lepsids, Ueber den AUgijptischen Gbtlerbreis, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, 1851, pp. 198, 199. We find, however, some instances where the draughtsman, either from custom or design, had used the vulture to express the word mailt, “ the mother,” without troubling himself to think whether it answered to the name of the goddess.

Wiedemann, Geschichte von Alten Mgypten, pp. 97-104, and Tiele, Geschichte der Religion im Altertum, vol. i. p. 89. Ed.

mode in which they were represented. The name and personality of an Egyptian
were so closely allied that interference with one implied interference with the
other.^ Klmniatonu could not continue to be such as be was when Amen6thes>
and, in fact, their respective portraits differ from each other to that degree that
there is some doubt at moments as to
their identity. Amenothes is hardly
to be distinguished from his father
he has the same regular and somewhat
heavy features, the same idealised
body and conventional shape as those
which we find in the orthodox
Pharaohs. Khuniatonii affects a long
and narrow head, conical at the top,
with a retreating forehead, a large
aquiline and pointed nose, a small
mouth, au enormous chin projecting
in front, the whole being supported by
a long, thin neck. His shoulders are
narrow, with little display of muscle,
but his breasts are so full, his abdomen
so prominent, and his hips so large,
that one would think they belonged
to a woman. Etiquette required the
attendants upon the king, and those
who aspired to his favour, to be por
trayed in the bas-reliefs of temples
or tombs in all points, both as regards
face and demeanour, like the king
himself. Hence it is that the majority of his contemporaries, after having
borne the likeness of Amenothes, came to adopt, without a break, that of
Klmniatonu. The scenes at Tel el-Amarna contain, therefore, nothing but
angular profiles, pointed skulls, ample breasts, flowing figures, and swelling
stomachs. The outline of these is one that lends itself readily to caricature,
and the artists have exaggerated the various details with the intention, it may
be, of rendering the representations grotesque. There was nothing ridiculous,
however, in the king, their model, and several of his statues attribute to him
a languid, almost valetudinarian grace, which is by no means lacking in
dignity. He was a good and affectionate man, and was passionately fond of

affairs. The architects, too, were not allowed to stand idle, and without
taking into account the repairs of existing buildings, had plenty to do
in constructieg edifices in honour of Atonu in the principal towns of the
Nile valley, at Memphis,^ Heliopolis,^ Hermopolis,'* Hermonthis,® and in the
Fayum.^ The provinces in Ethiopia remained practically in the same
condition as in the time of Amenothes III. ; Kush was pacified, notwith
standing the raids which the tribes of the desert were accustomed to make
from time to time, only to receive on each occasion rigorous chastisement
from the king’s viceroy. The sudden degradation of Amon had not brought
about any coldness betw'een the Pharaoh and his princely allies in Asia. The
aged Amenothes had, towards the end of his reign, asked the band of Dushratta’s
daughter in marriage, and the Mitannian king, highly flattered by the request,,
saw his opportunity and took advantage of it in the interest of his treasury.

were Simyra, Sini, Irqata, and Qodshu, and lie was already threatening Byblos,
Berytus, and Sidon. It was useless to complain of him, for he always
managed to exculpate himself to the royal messengers. Khai, DMu, Ame
nemaupit had in turn all pronounced him innocent. Pharaoh himself, after
citing him to appear in Egypt to give an explanation of his conduct, had
allowed himself to be won over by his fair speaking, and had dismissed him
uncondemned. Other princes, who lacked his cleverness and power, tried
to imitate him, and from north to south the whole of Syria could only be
compared to some great arena, in which fighting was continually carried on
between one tribe or town and another—Tyre against Sidon, Sidon against
Byblos, Jerusalem against Lachish. All of them appealed to Khuniatonu, and
endeavoured to enlist him on their side. Their despatches arrived by scores,
and the perusal of them at the present day would lead us to imagine that
Egypt had all but lost her supremacy. The Egyptian ministers, however, were
entirely unmoved by them, and continued to refuse material support to any
of the numerous rivals, except in a few rare cases, where a too prolonged
indifference would have provoked an open revolt in some part of the country.
Khuniatonu died young, about the XVIIP'^ year of his reign.^ He was
buried in the depths of a ravine in the mountain-side to the east of the town,
and his tomb remained unknown till within the last few years. Although one
of his daughters who died before her father had been interred there, the place
seems to have been entirely unprepared for the reception of the king’s body.
The funeral chamber and the passages are scarcely even rough-hewn, and the
reception halls show a mere commencement of decoration.^ The other tombs
of the locality are divided into two groups, separated by the ravine reserved for
the burying-place of the royal house. The noble families possessed each their
own tomb on the slopes of the hillside ; the common people were laid to rest in
pits lower down, almost on the level of the plain. The cutting and decoration of
all these tombs had been entrusted to a company of contractors, who had exe
cuted them according to two or three stereotyped plans, without any variation,
except in size.^ Nearly all the walls are bare, or present but few inscriptions
those tombs only are completed whose occupants died before the Pharaoh.
The ftifades of the tombs are cut in the rock, and contain, for the most part,
* The length of KhuniatomVs reign was fixed by Gritfith with almost absolute certainty by means of the dates written in ink on the jars of wine and preserves found in the ruins of the palace (Peteie, Tell el-Amarna, pp. 32-34, and pis. xxii.-xxv. ^ Tlie tomb has been found, as I anticipated, in the ravine which separates the northern from the southern group of burying-places. The Arabs opened it in 1891, and Gre'baut has since completely excavated it (Dauessy, Tomheaux et Steles-limites de Hagi-Qandil, in the Becueilde Travaux, vol. xv. p. 32). Tlie scenes depicted in it are connected with the death and funeral of the Princess Maqitatonh (Boueiant, Notes de voyage, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xviii. pp. 121-127. ^ Nestou L’hote, Lettres ecrites d'Egypte, p. 53, et seq. ; Boueiant, Deux Jours de fouilles a Tell el-Amarna, in the Memoires de la Mission franyaise du Caire, vol. i. pp. 8, 9, 15, 16, 21, 22.

but one door, the jurabs of which are covered on both sides by several lines of
hieroglyphs ; and it is just possible to distinguish traces of the adoration of the
radiant Disk on the lintels, together with the cartouches containing the names
of the king and god. The chapel is a large rectangular chamber, from one end
of which opens the inclined passage leading to the coffin. The roof is some
times supported by columns, having capitals decorated with designs of flowers
or of geese hung from the abacus by their feet with their heads turned upwards.^
The religious teaching at Tel el-Amarna presents no difference in the main
from that which prevailed in other parts of Egypt.^ The Double of Osiris was
supposed to reside in the tomb, or else to take wing to heaven and embark
with Atonu, as elsewhere he would embark with Ea. The same funerary
furniture is needed for the deceased as in other local cults —ornaments of
' Drawn by Boudier, after a photograph by Insinger of the interior of the tomb of Tutu. “ Cf. the drawing of the column ornamented with geese, in Lepsius, Denlcm., iii. 106 c; Peisse d’Avennes, Histoire de V Art Egyptien. Fragments of similar columns have been found in the palace of the kiog, in the middle of the ruins of the town, by Petrie, Tellel-Amarna, pis. vii., xi. G, and p. 8. ® According to Breasted, De Hymnis in Salem sub Amenophide IV. conceptis, p. 8, there was an essential difference. But the peculiar treatment of tbe two extremities of the sign for the sky, which surmounts the great scene on the tomb of Ahmosis, shows that there had been no change in the ideas concerning the two horizons or the divine tree found in them (Nestor L^hote, Rapiers inedits, vol. iii. fol. 286; : the aspirations for the soul of Mariri, the high priest of Atonu (Id., ibid., ful. 284), or for that of the sculptor Bauku, are the same as those usually found (Brdgsch, Geschichte ASgyptens, pp.
422, 423), and the formula on the funerary stelm differs only in the name of the god from that on the ordinary stelse of the same kind (Wiedemann, Inscriptions of the Time of Amenophis IV., in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archseology, vol. xvii. pp. 153-156).



332 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
vitreous paste, amulets, and Ushahtiu, or “ Eespondents,” to labour for the dead
man in the fields of lalu. Those of Khuniatonu were, like those of Ameno
thes III., actual statuettes in granite of admirable workmanship^ The dead
who reached the divine abode, retained the same rank in life that they had pos
sessed here below, and in order to ensure the enjoyment of it, they related, or
caused to be depicted in their tombs, the events of their earthly career. A citizen
of Khuitatonu would naturally represent the manners and customs of his native
town, and this would account for the local colouring of the scenes in which we
see him taking part. They bear no resemblance to the traditional pictures
of the buildings and gardens of Thebes with w'hich we are familiar ; we have
instead the palaces, colonnades, and pylons of the rising city, its courts planted
with sycamores, its treasuries, and its storehouses. The sun’s disk hovers above
and darts its prehensile rays over every object; its hands present the crux
ansata to the nostrils of the various members of the family, they touch caress
ingly the queen and her daughters, they handle the offerings of bread and
cakes, they extend even into the government warehouses to pilfer or to bless.
Throughout all these scenes Khuniatonii and the ladies of his harem seem to
be ubiquitous : here he visits one of the officers, there he repairs to the temple
for the dedication of its sanctuary. His chariot, followed at a little distance
by that of the princesses, makes its way peaceably through the streets. The
police of the city and the soldiers of the guard, whether Egyptians or foreigners,
run before him and clear a path among the crowd, the high priest Mariri stands
at the gate to receive him, and the ceremony is brought to a close by a dis
tribution of gold necklaces or rings, while the populace dance with delight
before the sovereign. Meantime the slaves have cooked the repast, the dancers
and musicians within their chambers have rehearsed for the evening’s festival,
and the inmates of the house carry on animated dialogues during their meal.
The style and the technique of these wall-paintings differ in no way from those
in the necropolis of the preceding period, and there can be no doubt that the
artists who decorated these monuments were trained in the schools of Thebes.
Their drawing is often very refined, and there is great freedom in their com
position ; the perspective of some of the bas-reliefs almost comes up to our own,
and the movement of animated crowds is indicated with perfect accuracy. It
is, however, not safe to conclude from these examples that the artists who
executed them would have developed Egyptian art in a new direction, had not
subsequent events caused a reaction against the worship of Atonu and his
followers. Although the tombs in which they worked differ from the
generality of Egyptian burying-places, their originality does not arise from any

effort, either conscious or otherwise, to break through the ordinary routine of
the art of the time; it is rather the result of the extraordinary appearance of
the sovereign whose features they were called on to portray, and the novelty
of several of the subjects which they had to treat. That artist among them
who first gave concrete form to the ideas circulated by the priests of Atonu,
and drew the model
cartoons, evidently pos
sessed a master - hand,
and wasendowed with un
deniable originality and
power.* No other Egyp
tian draughtsman ever
expressed a child’s grace
as he did, and the por
traits which he sketched
of the daughters of
Khuniatonii playing un
dressed at their mother’s
side, are examples of a
reserved and delicate
grace. But these models,
when once composed and
finished even to the
smallest details, were
entrusted for execution to workmen of mediocre powers, who were recruited
not only from Thebes, but from the neighbouring cities of Hermopolis and
Siut. These estimable people, with a praiseworthy patience, traced bit by bit
the cartoons confided to them, omitting or adding individuals or groups accord
ing to the extent of the wall-space they had to cover, or to the number of
relatives and servants whom the proprietor of the tomb desired should share
in his future happiness. The style of these draughtsmen betrays the influence
of the second-rate schools in which they had learned their craft, and the
clumsiness of their work would often repel us, were it not that the interest of
the episodes portrayed redeems it in the eyes of the Egyptologist.
Khuniatonu left no son to succeed him ; two of his sons-in-law succes
sively occupied the throne—Saakeri,^ who had married his eldest daughter

Maritatonu, and Tutankhamon, the husband of Ankhnasaton. The first had
been associated in the sovereignty by his father-in-law;^ he showed himself
a zealous partisan of the “ Disk,” and he continued to reside in the new
capital during the few years of his sole reign.^ The second son-in-law was
a son of Amenothes III., probably by a concubine.^ He returned to the
religion of Amon, and his wife, abjuring the creed of her father, changed her
name from Ankhnasaton to that of Ankhnasamon. Her husband abandoned
Khuitatonu ^ at the end of two or three years, and after his departure the
town fell into decadence as quickly as it had arisen. The streets were unfre
quented, the palaces and temples stood empty, the tombs remained unfinished
and unoccupied, and its patron god returned to his former state, aiid was
relegated to the third or fourth rank in the Egyptian Pantheon. The town
struggled for a short time against its adverse fate, which was no doubt re
tarded owing to the various industries founded in it by Khuniatonu, the manu
factories of enamel and coloured glass requiring the presence of many
workmen ;
^ but the latter emigrated ere long to Thebes or the neighbouring
city of Hermopolis, and the “ Horizon of Atonu ” disappeared from the list
of nomes, leaving of what might have been the capital of the Egyptian empire,
merely a mound of crumbling bricks with two or three fellahin villages
scattered on the eastern bank of tlie Nile.® Thebes, whose influence and
population had meanwhile never lessened, resumed her supremacy undisturbed.
If, out of respect for the past, Tutankhamon continued the decoration of the
* Lepsiijs, Denltm., iii. 99 a, where he and his wife are represented by the side of Khuniatonfl, with the protocol and the attributes of royalty. Petrie assigns to this double reign those minor objects on wliich the king’s prenomen Ankhkhopiruri is followed by the epithet beloved of Udnira, which formed part of the name of Khhniatonii {Tell el-Amarna, p. 42). ^ Petrie thinks, on the testimony of the lists of Manetho, which give twelve years to Akenkheres, daughter of Horos (Muller-Didot, Fragmenta Historicorum Grxcorum, vol. ii. pp. 573-578), that Saakeri reigned twelve years, and only two or three years as sole monarch without his father-in-law (Tell el-Amarna, pp. 43, 44). I think these two or three years a probable maximum length of his reign, whatever may be the value we should liere assign to the lists of Manetho. “ This relationship was recognised by the early Egyptologists (Wilkinson, Extracts from several Hieroglyphic Subjects, p. 11 ; Leemans, Lettre a M. Frangois SalvoUni, p. 68, et seq. ; E. de Kouge, Lettre a M. Alfred Maury, in the Revue Arch^ologique, 1847, pp. 120-123; Mariette, Renseignements sur les soixante-quatre Apis, in tlie Bulletin Arch^ologique de I’Ath^nxum Frangaia, 1855, pp. 53, 58), but was forgotten for some thirty years. It has been again pointed out by Loret, Tout-ankli-amen, fih d' Am^nophis III., in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xi. p. 212 (cf. Lefebdre, Sur diff^rents Mots et Noms Egyptiens, in the Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archseology, 1890-91, vol. xiii. p. 478). The Princess Maritri was neither his mother nor his grandmother, as Wiedemann {JEgyptische Geschichte, p. 401) and Lefebure {Sur diff^rents Mots et Noms Egypliens, p. 478) have affirmed, but was the mother of a King Nibkhopirniri, whoso position cannot yet be determined (Mariette, Abydos, vol. ii. pi. 40 n). * Petrie, in Tell el-Amarna, pp. 13, 41, judging from the number of minor objects which he has found in his e.xcavations at Tel el-Amarna, believes that he can fix the length of Tutankhamen’s sojourn at Khuitatonu at six years, and that of his whole reign at nine years. ^ Numerous specimens may be seen in Petrie’s Tell el-Amarna, pis. xiii.-xx. ® Petrie thinks that the temples and palaces were systematically destroyed by Harmhabi, and the ruins used by him in the buildings which he erected at different places in Egypt {Tell el-Amarna, p. 44). But there is no need for this theory: the beauty of the limestone which Khuuiatonh had used sufficiently accounts for the rapid disappearance of the deserted edifices.

temple of Atonu at Karnab,^ he placed in every other locality the name and
figure of Amon ; a little stucco spread over the parts which had been mutilated,
enabled the outlines to be restored to their original purity, and the alteration was
rendered invisible by a few coats of colour. Tutankhamon was succeeded by
the divine father Ai, whom Khtiniatonu had assigned as husband to one of his
relatives named Tii, so called after the widow of Amenothes III. Ai laboured
no less diligently than his predecessor to keep up the traditions which had
been temporarily interrupted.® He had been a faithful worshipper of the Disk,
‘ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, after the drawing of Prisse d’Avennes (cf. Histoire de I’ Art Egyptien, vol. ii., and Lepsius, Denkm., 113 0 . 3 .). ^ Stones from this temple bearing the name of Atonu have been noticed by Nestor L’hote, Letlres Sorites d’Egypte, pp. 94-97, by Peisse d’Avennes, Monuments Egyptians, pi. xi. 1, and by Lepsius Denkm., iii. 119 a, h (cf. Piehl, Lettre a M. A. Erman, sur une ddcouverte concernant le second pylone de Karnak, in the Zeitschrift, 1883, p. 41), in the construction of the pylons of Harmhabi at Karuak, and even in the buildings of Seti I. and Kamses II. at Luxor. ^ The name of this king and his place in the sequence of dynasties have been frequently discussed by early Egyptologists. Champollion called him Skhai, and placed him before the XVIP'' dynasty (Dettres ecrites d’Egypte, 2nd edit., p. 247). In this he was followed by Charles Lenormant (Eclaircissements sur le cercueil du Boi Memphite Mycdrinus, p. 24), while Eosellini {Monumenti Storici, vol. i. p. 145) calls him Nutei or Terei, and Nestor L’hote {Lettres dcrites d’Egypte, pp. 95, 96) Pinuterei, in order to identify him with Binothris of the II”'* dynasty. Wilkinson (Modern Egypt and Thebes, 2nd edit., vol. ii. p. 256) styles him Eesa, and Major Felix Asa (Note sopra le Dinastie dei Faraoni, p. 18). Prisse reads his name Schai or Scherai, and gives him his true position (Rccherehes sur les l^gendes royales et I’dpoque du regne de Schai et Scherai, in the Revue Arch^ologique, vol. ii. pp. 457-474), while Lepsius and Bunsen (AUg^jptens Stelle, vol. iii. pp. 88, 89), though they keep the form Beneter, Beneter-Imesi, place him among the last Pharaohs of the XVIIP'* dynasty. E. de Eouge', after having proposed the reading Acherei (Examen de I’ouvrage de M. le Chevalier de Bunsen, ii. pp. 57, 58), at last found the true one, viz. the divine father Ai (Notice des Monuments Egyptiens du Louvre, 1849, p. 57). The order of succession of the three sovereigns is not quite certain ; the one given in the text is accepted as the most probable by the majority of historians (Brugsch, Geschichte jEgyptens, pp. 433-438 ; Wiedemann, ASgyptische Geschichte, pp. 403-406). Ed. Meyer (Geschichte des Alten AEgyptens, pp. 269-271) reverses the order of the two last, and places Tutankhamen’s reign before that of Ai, but Petrie’s discoveries (Tell el-Amarna, pp. 42-44) have now rendered this view improbable.



336 THE EIGHTEENTH THEBAN DYNASTY.
and had given orders for the construction of two funerary chapels for himself
in the mountain-side above Tel el-Amarna, the paintings in which indicate
a complete adherence to the faith of the reigning king. But on becoming
Pharaoh, he was proportionally zealous in his submission to the gods of Thebes,
and in order to mark more fully his return to the ancient belief, he chose for
his royal burying-place a site close to that in which rested the body of Ameno
thes III.^ His sarcophagus, a large oblong of carved rose granite, still lies
open and broken on the spot. Figures of goddesses stand at the four angles
and extend their winged arms along its sides, as if to embrace the mummy of
the sovereign.^ Tutankhamen and Ai were obeyed from one end of Egypt to
the other, from Napata to the shores of the Mediterranean. The peoples of
Syria raised no disturbances during their reigns, and paid their accustomed
tribute regularly ;
® if their rule was short, it was at least happy. It would
appear, however, that after their deaths, troubles arose in the state. The lists
of Manetho give two or three princes—Eathotis, Khebres, and Akherres—whose
names are not found on the monuments.^ It is possible that we ought not to
regard them as historical personages, but merely as heroes of popular romance,
of the same type as those introduced so freely into the history of the preceding
dynasties by the chroniclers of the Saite and Greek periods.^ They were,
perhaps, merely short-lived pretenders who were overthrown one by the other
before either had succeeded in establishing himself on the seat of Horus. Be
that as it may, the XVIII'^ dynasty drew to its close amid strife and quarrel
ling, without our being able to discover the cause of its overthrow, or the
name of the last of its sovereigns.'^
Scarcely half a century had elapsed between the moment when the XVIIP‘
dynasty reached the height of its power under Amenothes III. and that of its
downfall. It is impossible to introduce with impunity changes of any kind
into the constitution or working of so complicated a machine as an empire
1 The first tomb seems to have been dug before his marriage, at the time when he had no definite ambitions ; the second (the No. 3 of Lepsius) was prepared for him and his wife Tii. The identity of the divine father Ai of Tel el-Aiuarna with the Pharaoh Ai who was buried at Thebes has been shown by Lepsius {Briefe aus Aigypten und Aithiopien, p. 415) ; only Wiedemann, as far as I know, has contested it. ^ For the description of the tomb, see Nestor L’kote, Lettres ecrites d'Egypte, pp. 2-11. “ Tutankhamon receives the tribute of the Kushites as well as that of tlie Syrians (Champollion, Monuments de I’Egypte et de la Nuhie, vol. i. pp. 477-480; Lepsius, Denkin., iii. 115-118); Ai is represented at Shataui in Nubia as accompanied by Pafiiru, the prince of Khsh (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 114 c. k.). * Manetho, in MuluePv-Didot, Fragmenta Historicorum Grxcorum, vol. ii. pp. 573-578. Wiedemann {Agyptische GescMchie, pp. 40C-4U8) has collected six royal names which, with much hesitation, he places about this time. * Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d'llistoire, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. pp. 56-68, 121-138. “ The list of kings who make up the XVIIP'' dynasty can be established with certainty, with the exception of the order of the three last sovereigns who succeed Khuniatonu.

founded on conquest. When the parts of the mechanism have been once put
together and set in motion, and have become accustomed to work harmoniously
at a proper pace, interference with it must not be attempted except to replace
such parts as are broken or worn out, by others exactly like them. To make
alterations while the machine is in motion, or to introduce new combinations,
however ingenious, into any part of the original plan, might produce an
accident or a breakage of the gearing when perhaps it would be least expected.
When the devout Khuniatonu exchanged one city and one god for another, he
thought that he was merely transposing equivalents, and that the safety of
the commonwealth was not concerned in the operation. Whether it was
Amon or Atonu who presided over the destinies of his people, or whether
Thebes or Tel el-Amarna were the centre of impulse, was, in his opinion,
merely a question of internal arrangement which could not affect the economy
of the whole. But events soon showed that he was mistaken in his calculations.
It is probable tliat if, on the expulsion of the Hyksos, the earlier princes of the
dynasty had attempted an alteration in the national religion, or had moved the
capital to any other city they might select, the remainder of the kingdom
would not have been affected by the change. But after several centuries of
faithful adhei’ence to Amon in his city of Thebes, the governing power would

Manetho s list, as we have it, is a very ill-made extract, wherein the official kings are mixed up with
the legitimate queens, as well as, at least towards the end, with persons of doubtful authenticity, •tseveral kings, between Khuniatonu and Harmhabi, are sometimes added at the end of the list
(Wiedemann, .^gyptisclie Geschiohte, pp. 100-108) ; some of these, I think, belonged to previous
dynasties, e.g. Teti to the VP*' (cf. Dawn of Civilization, p. 416, note 3), Eahotpu to the XVIIti* (cf.
p. 77 of this volume) ; several are heroes of romance, as Mernebphtah or Merkhopirphtah (Maspeeo,
Les Contes populaires, 2nd edit., pp. xxxviii.-xl.), while the names of the others are either variants
from the cartouche names of known princes, or else are nicknames, such as was Sesh, Ses‘(iri for
Kamses II. Dr. Mahler believes that he can fix, within a few days, the date of the kings of whom
the list is composed, from Ahmosis I. to Ai. I hold to the approximate date which I have given on p. 107 of this volume, and I give the years 1600 to 1350 as the period of the dynasty, with a possible •error of about fifty years, more or less.

find it no easy matter to accomplish such a resolution. During three centuries
the dynasty had become wedded to the city and to its patron deity, and the
locality had become so closely associated with the dynasty, that any blow aimed
at the god could not fail to destroy the dynasty with it ; indeed, had the
experiment of Khuniatonu been prolonged beyond a few years, it might have
entailed the ruin of the whole country. All who came into contact with
Egypt, or were under her rule, whether Asiatics or Africans, were quick to
detect any change in her administration, and to remark a falling away from the
traditional systems of the times of Thutmosis III. and Amenothes II. The
successors of the heretic king had the sense to perceive at once the first
symptoms of disorder, and to refrain from persevering in his errors; but how
ever quick they were to undo his work, they could not foresee its serious con
sequences. His immediate followers were powerless to maintain their dynasty,
and their posterity had to make way for a family who had not incurred the
hatred of Amon, or rather that of his priests. If those who followed them were
able by their tact and energy to set Egypt on her feet again, they were at the
same time unable to restore her former prosperity or her boundless confidence
in herself.

dynasty. By such a chance alliance Harmhabi,
who was himself descended from Thutmosis III.,
was raised to the kingly office.^ His mother,

character of her look and smiled It is possible that Mutnozmit was the
daughter of Amenothes III. by his marriage with one of his sisters ; it
was from her, at any rate, and not from his great-grandfather, that Harmhabi
derived his indisputable claims to royalty^ He was born, probably, in the
last years of Amenotlies, when Tii was the exclusive favourite of the sovereign ;
but it was alleged later on, when Harmhabi had emerged from obscurity, that
Araon, destining him for the throne, had condescended to become his father by
Iliitnozmit—a customary procedure with the god when his race on earth
threatened to become debased.^ It was he who had rocked the newly born
infant to sleep, and, while Harsiesis was strengthening his limbs with protective
amulets, had spread over the child’s skin the freshness and brilliance which are
the peculiar privilege of the immortals. While still in the nursery, the great
and the insignificant alike prostrated themselves before Harmhabi, making him
liberal offerings. Every one recognised in him, even when still a lad and inca
pable of refiection, the carriage and complexion of a god, and Horus of Cynopolis
was accustomed to follow his steps, knowing that the time of his advancement
was near. After having called the attention of the Egyptians to Harmhabi,
Amon was anxious, in fact, to hasten the coming of the day when he might confer
upon him supreme rank, and for this purpose inclined the heart of the reign
ing Pharaoh towards him. Ai proclaimed him his heir over the whole land.^
him Hornemneb {Lettres a M. le due de Blacas, vol. i. pp. 47-83), Eosellini, Horhemheb, H6r-em-bbai {Moiiumenti Storici, vol. i. p. 241, and vol. iii. pt. 1, p. 275), and both identified him with the Horos of ^Manetbo, hence the custom among Egyptologists for a long time to designate him by the name Horus. Deveria was the first to show that the name corresponded with the Armais of the lists of Manetho {Le Papyrus judiciare de Turin, pp. 68-81), and, in fact, Armais is the Greek transcription of the group Harmhabi in the bilingual texts of the Ptolemaic period (Brugsch, Sammlung Demotisch-Griecliischer Eigennameu Mgyptischer Prioatleute, p. 17, No. 150). ' See the tail-piece at bottom of p. 338 of the present work, drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugseh-Bey. Mariette called her Taia, thinking it was a statute of Tii. Excavations at Karnak have resulted in the discovery of some parts of the body which have inclined me to see in the statue some woman of the family of Harmhabi {Guide du Visiteur au Mus^e du Boulaq, p. 425, No. 617), probably Miitnozmit. * Mutnozmit was at first considered the daughter and successor of Harmhabi (Champollion, Lrttres it M. le due de Blaeas, vol. i. pp. 50-64; Kosellini, Mon. Storici, vol. i. pp. 240-244, and vol. iii. pt. 1, i)p. 290-202; Champollion-Figeac, L'Egypte Ancienne,])p. 320-322), or his wife (Wilkinson, Materia Hieroglyph., pt.ii.pl. 1; Lefsivs, Koingsbueh,p].xs.x., No. 411; Buvgsch, Hist. d’Egypte, 1x125, and Gesch. lEgyptens, pp. 421, 439, 441 ; Wiedemann, AUgyptische Gesch., p. 411 ; Ed. Meyer, Gesch. des Alien .Egyptens, p. 273). Birch showed that the monuments did not confirm these hypotheses, and he was inclined to think that she was Harmhabi’s mother {Inscription of Haremhebi on Ms Statue at Turin, in Trans. Bibl. Arch. Soc.,vol. iii. pp. 490,491). As far as I can see for the present, it is the only solution which agrees with the evidence on the principal monument which has made known her existence. * All that we know of the youth of Harmhabi is contained in the texts on a group preserved in the Turin Museum, and pointed out by Champollion {Lettres it de Blacas, vol. i. pp. 48-64), translated and published subsequently by Birch {Inscription of Haremhebi, in Trans. Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. iii. pp. 486-495, and Inscrip, of Haremhebi, in Records of the Past, 1st ser., vol. x. pp. 29-36) and by Brugsch ( Gerch. Hgyptens, pp. 440-444). The first lines of the inscription seem to me to contain an account of the union of Amon with the queen, analogous to those at Heir el-Bahaii treating of the birth of Hatshopsitii, and to those at Luxor bearing upon Amenothes III. (cf. pp. 236, 237, 295, 296 of the present work), and to prove for certain that Harmhabi’s mother was a princess of the royal line by right. * The king is not named in the inscription. It cannot have been Amenothes IV., for an individual

THE YOUTH AND ENTHRONEMENT OF HARMHABL
He never gave cause for any dissatisfaction when called to court, and
when he was asked questions by the monarch he replied always in fit terms,
in such words as were calculated to produce serenity, and thus gained for
himself a reputation as the incarnation of wisdom, all his plans and intentions
appearing to have been conceived by Thot the Ibis himself. For many years
he held a place of confidence with the sovereign. The nobles, from the moment
he appeared at the gate of the palace, bowed their backs before him ; the
barbaric chiefs from the north or south stretched out their arms as soon as
they approached him, and gave him the adoration they would bestow upon a
god.^ His favourite residence was Memphis, his preference for it arising from
his having possibly been born there, or from its having been assigned to him
for his abode. Here he constructed for himself a magnificent tomb, the bas
reliefs of which exhibit him as already king, with the sceptre in his hand and
the uraeus on his brow, while the adjoining cartouche does not as yet contain his
name.^ He was the mighty of the mighty, the great among the great, the
general of generals, the messenger who ran to convey orders to the people of
Asia and Ethiopia, the indispensable companion in council or on the field of
battle,® at the time when Horus of Cynopolis resolved to seat him upon his
eternal throne. Ai no longer occupied it. Horus took Harmhabi with him to
of the importance of Harmhabi, living alongside this king, would at least have had a tomb begun for him at Tel el-Amarna. We may hesitate between Ai and Tutankhamen; but the inscription seems to say definitely that Harmhabi succeeded directly to the king under whom he had held important offices for many years, and this compels us to fix upon Ai, who, as we have said at p. 334, et seq., was, to all appearances, the last of the so-called heretical sovereigns. ’ Turin Inscription, 11. 2-11; cf. Birch, Inscription of Haremhebi, in the Transactions Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. iii. pp. 492, 493, and Inscription of Haremhebi, in the Records of the Past, 1st series, vol. X. pp. 31-33; Beugsch, Geschichte HIgyptens, pp. 440, 441. The description given follows the text closely, and preserves the chief expressions. ^ This part of the account is not borrowed from the Turin inscription, but is baaed upon a study of a certain number of texts and representations all coming from Harmhabi’s tomb at Saqqarah, and
now scattered among the various museums —at Gizeh (Makiette, Monuments Divers, pis. 74, 75, and text, pp. 25, 26), at Leyden (Leemaus, Description raisonn^e des Mon. Fgyptiens, pp. 40, 41, c. 1-3,
and Monuments du Mm€e TAntiquit€s, vol. i. pis. 21-24), at London (Birch, Guide to the Egyptian Galleries, .Nos. 550-552, p. 36 ; cf. Sharpe, Egyptian Inscriptions, vol. ii. pi. 92), at Alexandria (Wiedemann, Texts of the Second Part of the XVIIP’' Dynasty, in the Proceedings Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1888-89, vol. xi. p. 424). Birch was the first to assign these monuments to the Pharaoh Harmhabi, supposing at the same time that he had been dethroned by Eamses I., and had lived at Memphis in an intermediate position between that of a prince and that of a private individual {Inse. of Haremhebi, vo the Transactions, vol. iii. p. 491); this opinion was adopted by Ed. Meyer {Die Stele des Horemheb, in the Zeitschrift, 1875, pp. 148, 149), rejected by Wiedemann (ASgyptisclie Geschichte, pp. 412, 413, and Supplement, p. 48) and by myself {Hist. Ancienne des Peuples de I’Orient, 4th edit., p. 213, note 6). After full examination, I think the Harmhabi of the tomb at Saqqarah and the Pharaoh Harmhabi are one and the same person; Harmhabi, sufficiently high placed to warrant his wearing the urseus, but not high enough to have his name inscribed in a cartouche, must have had his tomb constructed at Saqqarah, as Ai and possibly Eamses I. had theirs built for them at Tel elAmarna (see pp. 335, 336 of the present work) : this is now the opinion of Ed. Meyer, as recorded in Ids Geschichte des Alten Mgyptens, pp. 271, 272.

Leemans, Description raisonnde des Monuments Egyptiens, p. 40) show him leading to the Pharaoh Asiatics and Ethiopians, burthened with tribute ; the expressions and titles given in the text on this page are borrowed from the fragments at Gizeh (Mariette-Maspero, Monuments Divers, pi. 74, pp. 25, 26).

Thebes, escorted him thither amid expressions of general joy, and led him to Amon
in order that the god might bestow upon him the right to reign. The reception
took place in the temple of Luxor, which served as a kind of private chapel
for the descendants of Amenothes. Amon rejoiced to see Harmhabi, the heir of
the two worlds ; he took him with him to the royal palace, introduced him into
the apartments of his august daughter, Mtitnozmit ; then, after she had recog
nised her child and had pressed him to her bosom, all the gods broke out into
acclamations, and their cries ascended up to heavend “ Behold, Amon arrives
with his son before him, at the palace, in order to put upon his head the diadem,
and to prolong the length of his life ! We install him, therefore, in his office,
we give to him the insignia of Ea, we pray Amon for him whom he has brought
as our protector: may he as king have the festivals of Ea and the years of
Horus ; may he accomplish his good pleasure in Thebes, in Heliopolis, in Mem
phis, and may he add to the veneration with which these cities are invested.
And they immediately decided that the new Pharaoh should be called Horus
sturdy-bull, mighty in wise projects, lord of the Vulture and of the very marvel
lous Uraeus in Thebes, the conquering Horus who takes pleasure in the truth,
and wlio maintains tlie two lands, the lord of the south and north, Sozir
Khopiiuii chosen of Ea, the offspring of the Sim, Harmhabi Miamun, giver of
life. The cortege came afterwards to the palace, the king walking before Amon :
there the god embraced his son, placed the diadems upon his head, delivered to
him the rule of the whole world, over foreign populations as well as those of
Egypt, inasmuch as he possessed this power as the sovereign of the universe.^
This is the customary subject of the records of enthronement. Pharaoh is
the son of a god, chosen by his father, from among all those who might have
a claim to it, to occupy for a time the throne of Horus ; and as he became king
only by a divine decree, he had pmblicly to express, at the moment of his eleva
tion, his debt of gratitude to, and his boundless respect for, the deity, who had
made him what he was. In this case, however, the protocol embodied some
thing more than the traditional formality, and its hackneyed phrases borrowed a
special meaning from the circumstances of the moment. Amon, who had been
* Owing to a gap, the text cannot be accurately translated at this point {Turin Inscription,. 11. 15, 16). The reading can be made out that Amon “ betook himself to the palace, placing the prince before him, as far as the sanctuary of liis (Amon’s) daughter, the very august . . . ; she poured water on his hands, she embraced the beauties (of the prince), she placed herself before him.” It will be seen that the name of the daughter of Amon is wanting, and Bird) thought that a terresirial princess whom Harmliabi had married was in question {Inscription of Uaremhehi on a Statue at Turin, in the Transactions of the Biblical Archajological Society, vol. iii. pp. 489-491), Mutnozmit, according to Brugsch {Gesehiclite JEgyptens, pp. 442-444). If tbo reference is not to a goddess, who along with Amon took part in the ceremonies, but to Miitnozmit, we must come to the conclusion that she, as heir and queen by birth, must have ceded her riglits by some ritual to her son before he could becrowned. ^ Turin Inscription, 11. 12-20; cf.

centuries, but in the year 27 B.c. a great earthquake brought them abruptly tO'
light. We find everywhere among the ruins, at the foot of the dislocated
gates, or at the bases of the headless colossal figures, heaps of blocks detached
from the structure, on which can be made out remnants of prayers addressed

to the Disk, scenes of worship, and cartouches of Amenothes IV., Ai, and
Tiitankhamond The work begun by Harmhabi at Thebes was continued with
'Unabated zeal through the length of the whole river- valley. “He restored the
sanctuaries from the marshes of Athu even to Nubia; he repaired their sculp
tures so that they were better than before, not to speak of the fine things he
did in them, rejoicing the eyes of Ea. That which he had found injured he
put into its original condition, erecting a hundred statues, carefully formed of
valuable stone, for everyone which was lacking. He inspected the ruined towns
of the gods in the land, and made them such as they had been in the time of
the first Ennead,^and he allotted to them estates and offerings for every day, as
well as a set of sacred vessels entirely of gold and silver ; he settled priests in
them, bookmen, carefully chosen soldiers, and assigned to them fields, cattle,
all the necessary material to make prayers to Ea every morning.” ^ These
measures were inspired by consideration for the ancient deities ; but he added
to them others, which tended to secure the welfare of the people and the
stability of the government. Up to this time the officials and the Egyptian
soldiers had displayed a tendency to oppress the fellahin, without taking into
consideration the injury to the treasury occasioned by their rapacity. Constant
supervision was the only means of restraining them, for even the best-served
Pharaohs, Thutmosis, and Amenothes III. themselves, were obliged to have
frequent recourse to the rigour of the law to keep the scandalous depredations
of the officials within bounds.^ The religious disputes of the preceding years,
in enfeebling the authority of the central power, had given a free hand to these
oppressors. The scribes and tax-collectors were accustomed to exact contribu
tions for the public service from the ships, whether laden or not, of those who
were in a small way of business, and once they had laid their hands upon them,
they did not readily let them go. The poor fellow falling into their clutches
lost his cargo, and he was at his wits’ end to know' how to deliver at the royal
storehouses the various wares with which he calculated to pay his taxes. No
sooner had the Court arrived at some place than the servants scoured the neigh
bourhood, confiscating the land produce, and seizing upon slaves, under pretence
that they were acting for the king, while they had only their personal ends in
view'. Soldiers appropriated all the hides of animals with the object, doubtless, of
making from them leather jackets and helmets, or of duplicating their shields,
' The relics of these inscriptions have been put together in Nestor L’hote, Papiers in^dits, vol. iii. pp. SO, 90, 97, 101, 104, 105, in Peisse d’Avennes, Monuments, pis. x., xi., and in Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 110 c-g, 119 a, h.

EARMHABi INFUSES ORDER INTO TEE GOVERNMENT. 347
with the result that when the treasury made its claim for leather, none was to
be found. It was hardly possible, moreover, to bring the culprits to justice, for
the chief men of the towns and villages, the prophets, and all those who ought
to have looked after the interests of the taxpayer, took money from the
criminals for protecting them from justice, and compelled the innocent victims
also to purchase their protection. Harmhabi,
who was continually looking for opportunities to
put down injustice and to punish deceit, at
length decided to promulgate a very severe edict
against tlie magistrates and the double-dealing
officials ; any of them who was found to have
neglected his duty was to have his nose cut off,
and was to be sent into perpetual exile to Zalu,
on the eastern frontier.^ His commands, faith
fully carried out, soon produced a salutary effect,
and as lie would on no account relax the
severity of the sentence, exactions were no longer
heard of, to the advantage of the revenue of the
State. On the last day of each month the gates
of his palace were open to every one. Any one on giving his name to the
guard could enter the court of honour, where he would find food in abundance
to satisfy his hunger while he was awaiting an audience. The king all the
while was seated in the sight of all at the tribune, whence he would throw
among his faithful friends necklaces and bracelets of gold : he inquired into
complaints one after another, heard every case, announced his judgments in
brief words, and dismissed his subjects, who went away proud and happv at
having had their affairs dealt with by the sovereign himself.^
The portraits of Harmhabi which have come down to us give us the impres
sion ot a character at once energetic and agreeablei The most beautiful of these
is little more than a fragment broken off a black granite statue. Its mournful
expression is not pleasing to the spectator, and at the first view alienates
his sympathy. I’he face, which is still youthful, breathes an air of melancholy.
AMENOTHES IV., FROM A FRAGMENT ESED AGAIN BY HARMHAbI.^
' See pp. 22, 23 of the present work for a notice of Zalu and its convicts. ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a sketch by Prisse d’Avennes, Monuments Egyptiens, pi. xi. n. 2 It is one ot the bas-reliefs of the temple of Atonu at Karnak, re-employed by Harmhabi in the construction of one of his own pylons. All these details are taken from a stele discovered in 1882 (Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Grnmmaire, in the ZeiUchrift, 1882, p. 134), published in a brief summary by Bouriant (.4 Thihes, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. vi. pp. 41-56), afterwards translated and commented upon
by W. Max Miiller {ErJtldrung des Grossen Delirets des Kdnigs Ear-em-hebe, in the Zeitschrift, 1888, pp. 70-94). The text is so mutilated that it is impossible to give a literal rendering of it in all its parts, but the sense is sufficiently clear to warrant our filling up the whole with considerable certainty.



348 THE BEACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
an expression which is somewhat rare among the Pharaohs of the best period r
the thin and straiglit nose is well set on the face, the elongated eyes have some
what heavy lids ; the large, fleshy lips, slightly contracted at the corners of the
mouth, are cut with a sharpness that gives them singular
vigour, and the firm and finely modelled chin loses
little of its form from the false beard depending from
it. Every detail is treated with such freedom that
one would think the sculptor must have had some
soft material to work upon, rather than a
rock almost hard enough to defy the
chisel ; the command over it is so com
plete that the difficulty of the work is
forgotten in the perfection of the result.
The dreamy expression of his face,
however, did not prevent Harmhabi
from displaying beyond Egypt, as
within it, singular activity. Although
Egypt had never given up its claims to
dominion over the whole river-valley,
as far as the plains of Sennar, yet
since the time of Amenothes 111. no
sovereign had condescended, it would
appear, to conduct in person the ex
peditions directed against the tribes
of tlie Upper Nile. Harmhabi was
anxious to revive the custom which
imposed upon the Pharaohs the obliga
tion to make their first essay in arms in Ethiopia, as Horus, son of Isis, had
done of yore, and he seized the pretext of the occurrence of certain raids there
to lead a body of troops himself into the heart of the negro country. He had
just ordered at this time the construction of the two southern pylons at Karnak,
and there was great activity in the quarries of Silsileh. A commemorative
chapel also was in course of excavation here in the sandstone rock, and he had
dedicated it to his father, Amon-Ra of Thebes, coupling with him the local

At this period Egyptian ships were ploughing the Eed Sea, and their captains
were renewing official relations with Puanit. Somali chiefs were paying visits
to the palace, as in the time of Thutmosis Illd The wars of Amon had, in
fact, begun again. The god, having suffered neglect for half a century, had a
greater need than ever of gold and silver to fill his coffers ; he required masons
for his buildings, slaves and cattle for his farms, perfumed essences and
incense for his daily rites. His resources had gradually become exhausted,
and his treasury would soon be empty if he did not employ the usual means
to replenish it. He incited Harmhabi to proceed against the countries from
which in olden times he had enriched himself— to the south in the first place,
and then, having decreed victory there, and having naturally taken for himself
the greater part of the spoils, he turned his attention to Asia. In the latter
campaign the Egyptian troops took once more the route through Coele- Syria,
and if the expedition experienced here more difficulties than on the banks of
the Upper Nile, it was, nevertheless, brought to an equally triumphant conclusion.
Those of their adversaries who had offered an obstinate resistance were trans
ported into other lands, and the rebel cities were eitlier razed to the ground or
given to the flames : the inhabitants having taken refuge in the mountains,
where they were in danger of perishing from hunger, made supplications for
peace, which was granted to them on the usual conditions of doing homage and
paying tribute.^ We do not exactly know how far he penetrated into the
country ; the list of the towns and nations over which he boasts of having
triumphed contains, along with names unknown to us, some already famous
or soon to become so—Arvad, Pibukhu, the Khati, and possibly Alasia.^ The

their chiefs, associated, doubtless, with the Phoenicians, presented themselves

touched them ; the Egyptian campaign had not more effect, and Thut
mosis III. himself, after having crossed their frontiers and sacked several
of their towns, made no serious pretence to reckon them among his subjects.^
Their chiefs were accustomed, like their neighbours, to use, for correspondence
with other countries, the cuneiform mode of writing ; they had among them,
therefore, for this purpose, a host of scribes, interpreters, and official registrars
of events, such as we find to have accompanied the sovereigns of Assyria and
Babylon.^ These chiefs were accustomed to send from time to time a present
to the Pharaoh, which the latter was pleased to regard as a tribute,^ or they
would offer, perhaps, one of their daughters in marriage to the king at
Thebes, and after the marriage show themselves anxious to maintain good
faith with their son-in-law. They had, moreover, commercial relations with
Egypt, and furnished it with cattle, chariots, and those splendid Cappa
docian horses whose breed was celebrated down to the Greek period.^ They
were already, indeed, people of consideration ; their territory was so extensive
that the contemporaries of Thutmosis III. called them the Greater Khati
and the epithet “ vile,” which the chancellors of the Pharaohs added to their
name, only shows by its virulence the impression which they had produced upon

Upon this ignoring of the Khati in the time of Tln'itmosis III., cf. the position taken up by E. de ItouGii in Legons professees au College de France, in the Mdanges d’Arche'ologie Egyptienne et Assyrieiine, vol. ii. pp. 270, 271 ; this was the first serious contribution to the discussion of the subject, and has served as tlie starting-point of subsequent works on the rise of the Hittite power. “ A letter from the King of the Khati to the Pharaoh Amendthes IV. is written in cuneiform writing and in a Semitic language (Winckler-Abei., Der Thontafelfuiul von El-Aniarna, p. 17 ; cf. Delattue, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp548-550). It has been thought that other documents, drawn up in a non-Semitic language and coming from Mitanui and Arzapi (Winckler-Abel, Der Thontafelfund, pis. 9, 28-33; cf. the essays of Jensen, Vorstudien zur Entzifferung des Mitauiii-, Brunnow, Die Mitani-Sprache, and Satce, The Language of Mitanni, in the Zeilschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. v. pp. 166-274), contain a dialect of the
Hittite speech or that language itself. A “writer of books,” attached to the per.son of the Hittite King Khatusaru, is named amongst the dead found on tlie held of battle at Qodshu (E. de Eodge, Le Poeme de Pen-ta-our, 1856, pp. 9, 10). ’ It is thus perhaps we must understand the mention of tribute from the Khati in the Annals of Thutmosis III., 1. 26, in the year XXXIII., also in the year XL. (Lefsius, Denkm., iii. 30 a, 1. 7). One of the Tel el-Amarna letters refers to presents of this kind (Winckler-Abel, Her Thontafelfund. No. 18, pi. 15), which the King of Khati addresses to Amendthes IV. to celebrate his enthronement, and to ask him to maintain with himself the traditional good relations of their two families; see p. 329 of the present work. ^ * The horses of the Khati were called udart, strong, vigorous, as also their hulls (Auastast Papyrus IV., pi. xvii. 11. 8, 9 : cf. Bondi, Dem Hehraisch-phonizischen Sprachziceige angehiirige Lehnworter, pp. 24-26). The King of Alasia, while oftering to Amendthes III. a profitable speculation, advises him to have nothing to do with the King of the Khiiti or with the King of Sangar (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 5, p. 13, 11. 20, 21), and thus furnishes proof that the Egyptians held constant commercial relations with the Khiiti.

the mind of their adversaries^ Their type of face distinguishes them clearly
from the nations conterminous with them on the south. The Egyptian
draughtsmen represented them as squat and short in stature, though vigorous,
strong-limbed, and with broad and full shoulders in youth, but as inclined
frequently to obesity in
old age. The head is
long and heavy, the
forehead flattened, the
chin moderate in size,
the nose prominent, the
eyebrows and cheeks pro
jecting, the eyes small, !
oblique, and deep - set,
the mouth fleshy, and
usually framed in by two
deep wrinkles ; the flesh
colour is a yellowish or
reddish white, hut clearer „
than that of the Phoe
nicians or the Amurru.® Their ordinary costume consisted, sometimes of a
shirt with short sleeves, sometimes of a sort of loin-cloth, more or less ample
according to the rank of the individual wearing it, and bound round the waist
by a belt. To these they added a scanty mantle, red or blue, fringed like that
of the Chaldseans, which they passed over the left shoulder and brought back
under the right, so as to leave the latter exposed. They wore shoes with
thick soles, turning up distinctly at the toes,”* and they encased their hands
* Annah of Thutmosis 111., 1. 26, aud Lepsil'S, Denkm., iii. 30 o, 1. 7 : M. de Rouge suggested that Khati “the Little” was the name of the Hittites of Hebron {Lefons, in the Melanges d’ArcMologie, vol. ii. p. 270). The expression, “ Khati the Great,” has been compared with that of Khanirabbat, “ Khani the Great,” which in the Assyrian texts would seem to designate a part of Cappadocia, in which the province of Miliddi occurs, and the identification of the two has found an ardent defender in W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 320 ; cf. Niebuhr, Stndien und Bemerhungen zur Geschichte des Alien Orients, pp. 94-96. Until further light is thrown upon it, the most probable reading of the word is not Khani-rabbat, but KhanigoZbat (Jensen, Vorstudien zur Entzifferung des Mitanni, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. v. p. 177, note 1, and Grundlagen filr eine Entzifferung d(r Cilicischen Inschriften, pp. 4, 5; WiNCKLER, Gesch.

The name Kbani-Galbat is possibly preserved in Julbat, which the Arab geographers applied in the Middle Ages to a province situated in Lesser Armenia (Halevy, Deux Inscriptions heteennes de Zindjirli, in the Revue Semitique, vol. i. p. 244). ® Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Insinger.

in gloves, reaching halfway up the arm. They shaved off both moustache
and beard, but gave free growth to their hair, which they divided into
two or three locks, and allowed to fall upon their backs and breasts. The
king’s head-dress, which was distinctive of royalty, was a tall pointed hat,
resembling to some extent the white crown of the Pharaohs. The dress of the
people, taken all together, was of better and thicker material than that of
the Syrians or Egyptians.^ The mountains and elevated plateaus which they
inhabited were subject to extraordinary vicissitudes of heat and cold. If the
summer burnt up everything, the winter reigned here with an extreme rigour,
and dragged on for months : clothing and foot-gear had to be seen to, if the
snow and the icy winds of December were to be resisted. The character of their
towns, and the domestic life of their nobles and the common people, can only
be guessed at. Some, at least, of the peasants must have sheltered themselves
in villages half underground, similar to those which are still to be found in
this region.^ The town-folk and the nobles had adopted for the most part
the Chaldaean or Egyptian manners and customs in use among the Semites
of Syria. As to their religion, they reverenced a number of secondary deities
who had their abode in the tempest, in the clouds, the sea, the rivers, the
springs, the mountains, and the forests. Above this crowd there were several
sovereign divinities of the thunder or the air, sun-gods and moon-gods, of which
the chief was called Khati, and was considered to be the father of the nation.^
They ascribed to all their deities a warlike and savage character. The
Egyptians pictured some of them as a kind of Ka,^ others as representing Sit,
by Sayce (cf. Wright, TAe Empire of the lliltites, 1st edit,, pp. sii., xiii.). This characteristic is I'ouud on the majority of the monuments which the peoples of Asia Minor have left to us (Peerot, N^moires d’ ArchMogie, etc., pp. 52, 53, and llistoire de I'Art dans V Antiquity, vol. iv. pp. 562-564), and it is one of the most striking indications of the northern origin of the Khali (F. Lenormant, Les Origines dt I' llistoire, vol. iii. p. 299, et seq. ; W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 327, 328; see .Jensen for doubts on this subject Grundlage fiir eine Entzifferung der Cilicischen Inschriften, pp. 5, 6). The Egyptian artists and modern draughtsmen have often neglected it, and the majority of them have represented the Khati without shoes. ’ The information about the costume of the Ivhati was put together first by Osbdrn, Egypt, her Testimony to the Truth, pp. 130-132; afterwards completed by F. Lenormant, Les Origines de V Histoire, vol. iii. pp. 297-299, 303-305 ; by Perrot-Cuipiez, Histoire de V Art, vol. iv. pp. 562-564 and lastly by W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 324-330. ^ Perrot-Chipiez, Histoire de V Art dans V Antiquity, vol. iv. p. 587. ^ The little that can be gathered about the religion of the Khati has been summarised by E. de Rouge, Lefons profess^es au College de France, in the Melanges d’ Archeologie, vol. ii. pp. 274, 275, 278-280 ; afterwards by F. Lenormant, Les Origines, vol. iii. pp. 305-313, and by Wright, The Emptire of the Hittites, 1st edit., pp. 73-78 ; cf. W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 330, 331. The principal source of our information is the treaty of Ramses II. with Khatusaru, of which the later clauses (11. 26-32, 36, 37) invoke the gods of Egypt and those of the Khati ; seethe text in Bouriant’s Notes de Voyage, in the Becueil de Travaux, vol. xiii. pp. 157-160. ' The Cilician inscriptions of the Grmco-Roman period reveal the existence in this region of a god 'Pea, 'Peas (Sachau, Benierhungen zu Cilicischen Eigennamen, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vii. pp. 88-90). Did this god exist among the Khati, and did the similarity of the pronunciation of it to that of the god Ra suggest to the Egyptians the existence of a similar god among these people, or did they simply translate into their language the name of the Hittite god representing the sun ?

Sutkhh of Paliqa, Sutkhu of Khissapa, Sutkhu of
Sarsu, Sutkhu of Salpina. The goddesses in their
eyes also became Astartes, and this one fact suggests
that these deities were, like their Phoenician and
Canaanite sisters, of a double nature—in one aspect
chaste, fierce, and warlike, and in another lascivious
and pacific. One god was called Mauru, another Targu,
others Qaui and Khepa.^ Tishubu, the Ramman of
the Assyrians, was doubtless lord of the tempest and
of the atmosphere ; Shausbe answered to Shala and to
Ishtar the queen of love ;

’ The names Mauru and Qaui are deduced from the forms Maurusaru and Qauisaru, which were borne by the Khati (E. de Rouge, Legons, in the Melanges d’ArcMologie Egyptienne et Assyrienne, vol. ii. pp. 274, 275) : Qaui was probably the eponymous hero of the Qui people, as Khati was of the
Khati. Tarku and Tisubu appear to me to be contained in the names Targanunasa, Targazatas, and Tartisubu (E. de Rouge, 11. p. 275) ; Tisubu is probably the Tessupas mentioned in the letter from Dushratta written in Mitannian (Satce, The Language of the Mitanni, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. v. pp. 269, 270 ; cf. Jensen, Vorstudien zur Entzifferung des MUanni, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vi. pp. 59, 60, 65, 66, 68), and identical with the Tushupu of another letter from the same king (Bezold-Bddge, Tell el-Amarna Tahlets, No. 8, p. 18, 2, 11. 15, 75; of. Zimmeen, Briefe aus dem Funde in El-Amarna, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. v. pp. 154, 155, 162, 163), and in a despatch from Tarkondaraush (Abel-Wincklee, Der Thontafelfund, No. 10, 1. 22 ; cf. Boissibe, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. ix. pp. 421, 422). Targu, Targa, Targanu, resemble the god Tarkhu, which is known to us from the proper names of these regions preserved in Assyrian and Greek inscriptions (Satce, The Monuments of the Hittites, in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. vii. pp. 284-286 ; Jensen, Vorstudien, etc., in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vi. p. 70 ; Sachau, Bemerliungen zu Cilicischen Eigennamen, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vii. pp. 90-94).

Kheba, Khepa, Khipa, is said to be a denomination of Ramman (Boissiee, Notes sur les lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vii. p. 348); we find it in the names of the princesses Tadu-khipa, Gilu-khipa, Puu-khipa. ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the picture in Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 196 a.

before an altar, or stood each on the animal representing him —such as a lion, a
stag, or wild goatd The temples of their towns have disappeared, but they could
never have been, it would seem, either large or magnificent : the favourite places
of worship were the tops of mountains, in the vicinity of springs, or the depths
of mysterious gixrttoes, where the deity revealed himself to his priests, and
received the faithful at the solemn festivals celebrated several times a year.^
We know as little about their political organisation as about their religion.
We may believe, however, that it was feudal in character, and that every clan
had its hereditary chief and its proper gods ; the clans collectively rendered
obedience to a common king, whose effective authority depended upon his
character and age.^ The various contingents which the sovereign coirld
collect together and lead would, if he were an incapable general, be of little
avail against the well-officered and veteran troops of Egypt. Still they were
not to be despised, and contained the elements of an excellent army, superior
both in quality and quantity to any which Syria had ever been able to put into
the field. The infantry consisted of a limited number of archers or slingers.
They had usually neither shield nor cuirass, but merely, in the way of pro
tective armour, a padded head-dress, ornamented with a tuft. The bulk of
the army carried short lances and broad-bladed choppers, or more generally,
short thin-handled swords with flat two-edged blades, very broad at the base
and terminating in a point. Their mode of attack was in close phalanxes,,
whose shock must have been hard to bear, for the soldiers forming them were
in part at least recruited from among the strong and hardy mountaineers of
the Taurus.^ The chariotry comprised the nobles and the elite of the army,,
but it was differently constituted from that of the Egyptians, and employed
other tactics. The Hittite chariots were heavier, and the framework, instead
of being a mere skeleton, was panelled on the sides, the contour at the top

The evidence of the existence of a similar feudal organisation from the time of the XVIII'’‘ dynasty is furnished by a letter of Dusbratta, King of Mitanni, where he relates to Amenothes IV. the revolt of his brother Artassumara (see p. 298 of the present work), and speaks of the help which one of the neighbouring chiefs, Pirkhi, and all the Khati had given to the rebel. * The passages bearing upon the weapons of the Khati have been put together by W.

being sometimes quite square, at other times rudely curved. It was bound
together in the front by two disks of metal, and strengthened by strips of
copper or bronze, which were sometimes plated with silver or gold. There
were no quiver-cases as in Egyptian chariots, for the Hittite charioteers rarely
resorted to the bow and arrow. The occupants of a chariot were three in
number—the driver ; the shield-bearer, whose office it was to protect his com
panions by means of a shield,
sometimes of a round form,
with a segment taken out
on each side, and some
times square ; and finally,
the warrior, with his sword
and lance. The Hittite
princes whom fortune had
brought into relations with
Thutmosis III. and Ameno
thes II. were not able to
avail themselves properly of
the latent forces around them. It was owing probably to the feebleness of their
character or to the turbulence of their barons that we must ascribe the poor
part they played in the revolutions of the Eastern world at this time. The
establishment of a strong military power on their southern frontier was certain,
moreover, to be anything but pleasing to them ; if they preferred not to risk
everything by entering into a great struggle with the invaders, they could,
without compromising themselves too much, harass them with sudden attacks,
and intrigue in an underhand way against them to their own profit. Pharaoh’s
generals were accustomed to punish, one after the other, these bands of invading
tribes,^ and the sculptors duly recorded their names on a pylon at Thebes
among those of the conquered nations, but these disasters had little effect in
restraining the Hittites. They continued, in spite of them, to march south
ward, and the letters from the Egyptian governors record their progress year
after year. They had a hand in all the plots which were being hatched
among the Syrians, and all the disaffected who wished to be free from foreign

them for help in the way of chariots and mend Even in the time of Amenothes
III. they had endeavoured to reap profit from the discords of Mitanni, and had
asserted their supremacy over it. Dushratta, however, was able to defeat one
of their chiefs.^ Repulsed on this side, they fell back upon that part of
Naharaim lying between the Euphrates and Orontes, and made themselves
masters of one town after another in spite of the despairing appeals of the
conquered to the Theban king. From the accession of Khuniatonu, they set
to work to annex the countries of Nukhassi, Nii, Tunipa, and Zinzauru : they
looked witli covetous eyes upon Phcenicia, and were already menacing Coele
Syria.^ The religious confusion in Egypt under Tutankhamen and Ai left
them a free field for their ambitions, and whem Harmhabi ventured to cross
to the east of the isthmus, he found them definitely installed in the region
stretching from the Mediterranean and the Lebanon to the Euphrates. Their
then reigning prince, Sopalulu, appeared to have been the founder of a new
dynasty : he united the forces of the country in a solid body, and was
within a little of making a single state out of all Northern Syria.'^ All
Naharaim had submitted to him: Zahi, Alasia, and the Amurru had passed
under his government from that of the Pharaohs; Carchemish, Tunipa, Nii,
Hamath, figured among his royal cities, and Qodshu was the defence of his
southern frontier. His progress towards the east was not less considerable.
]\Iitanni, iVrzapi, and the principalities of the Euphrates as far as the Balikh,
possibly even to the Kbabur,® paid him homage : beyond this, Assyria and
Chaldma barred bis way. Here, as on his other frontiers, fortune brought
him face to face with the most formidable powers of the Asiatic world.
Had he sufficient forces at his disposal to triumph over them, or only
' Aziru defends himself in one of his letters against the accusation of having received four messengers from the King of the Khati, while he refused to receive those from Egypt (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 35, p. 73, 11. 47-53). The complicity of Aziru with the Khati is denounced in an appeal from the inhabitants of Tunipa (Id., ibid.. No. 41, pp. 84, 85, 11. 21-28). In a mutilated letter, published by Bezold-Budge, ibid.. No. 46, p. 95, an unknown person calls attention to the negotiations which a petty Syrian prince had entered into with the King of the Khati. ^ See p. 298 of the present work for the account of the quarrel between Dushratta and the Khati. “ See the letter from Akizzi, in which this individual relates the evils resulting from an invasion of the Khati, and asks help for himself and for the kings of Nukhassi, Nii, and Zizauru (BezoldBudge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 37, p. 78, 1. 40, et seq.). See also the letter from the inhabitants of Tunipa, who ask that an Egyptian army might be sent to protect them from Aziru and the Khati (Id., ibid.. No. 41, pp. 84, 85, 11. 21-28). * Sapalulu has the same name as that we meet with later on in the country of Patin, in the time of Salmanasar III., viz. Sajialulme (Monolith, col. i. 11. 41, 42). It is known to us only from a treaty with the Khati, which makes him coeval with Ramses I. (1. 3 ; cf. p. 401 of the present work) ; it was with him probably that Harmhabi had to deal in his Syrian campaigns (W. Max Muller, Asien und Eurofa, pp. 322, 332). The limit of his empire towards the south is gathered in a measure from what we know of the wars of Seti I. with the Khati, The latter prince was obliged to capture Qodshu, and to conquer the people of the Lebanon (see p. 371 of the present work). ‘ The text of the poem of Pentauirit (ed. J. de Rouge, in Revue Egyptolog., vol. iii. pp. 151, 159-161) mentions, among the countries confederate with the Khati, all Naharaim ; that is to say, the country on either side of the Euphrates, embracing Mitanni and the principalities named in the Amarna correspondence, and in addition some provinces whose sites have not yet been discovered, but which may be placed without much risk of error to the north of the Taurus ; see p. 389 of the present work.



EXTENSION OF TEE EITTITE EMPIRE TOWARDS THE NORTE. 359
enough to hold his ground ? Both hypotheses could have been answered in
the affirmative if each one of these great powers, confiding in its own resources,
had attacked him separately. The Amorites, the people of Zahi, Alasia, and
Naharaim, together with recruits from Hittite tribes, would then have put him
in a position to resist, and even to carry off victory with a high hand in the final
struggle. But an alliance between Assyria or Babylon and Thebes was always
possible. There had been such things before, in the time of Thutmosis IV. and
in that of Amenothes but they were lukewarm agreements, and their
effect was not much to boast of, for the two parties to the covenant had then
no common enemy to deal with, and their mutual interests were not, therefore,
bound up with their united action. The circumstances were very different now.
The rapid growth of a nascent kingdom, the restless spirit of its people, its
trespasses on domains in which the older powers had been accustomed to hold
the upper hand,— did not all this tend to transform the convention, more
commercial than militaiw, with which up to this time they had been content,
into an offensive and defensive treaty? If they decided to act in concert,
how could Sapalulu or his successors, seeing that he was obliged to defend
himself on two frontiers at the same moment, muster sufficient resources to
withstand the double assault? The Hittites, as we know them more espe
cially from the hieroglyphic inscriptions, might be regarded as the lords
only of Northern Syria, and their power be measured merely by the extent
of territory which they occupied to the south of the Taurus and on the
two banks of the Middle Euphrates. But this does not by any means
represent the real facts. This was but the half of their empire ; the rest
extended to the westward and northward, beyond the mountains into that
region, known afterwards as Asia Minor, in which Egyptian tradition had
from ancient times confused some twenty nations under the common vague
epithet of Haui-nibu.^ Official language still employed it as a convenient
and comprehensive term, but the voyages of the Phoenicians and the travels
of the “Eoyal Messengers,” as well as, probably, the maritime commerce
of the merchants of the Delta, had taught the scribes for more than a cen
tury and a half to make distinctions among these nations which they had
previously summed up in one. The Luku^ were to be found there, as well as
* See pp. 288, 296, 297 of the present work for notices of these alliances. * See the passages in the Daion of Civilization, pp. 391-393, bearing on the Haui-nibii. ^ The Luku, Luka, are mentioned in the Amarna correspondence under the form Lukki (AbelWiNCKLER, Der Thonfafelfund, No. 11, pi. 10, 11. 10-22 ; cf. Uelattee, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in Proc. Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1892-93, vol. xiv. pp. 129-131), as pirates and highway robbers. The identity of these people with the Lycians was pointed out for the first time by E. de Rouge, Extrait d’un M^m., etc., p. 4. It was opposed by Brugsch, who prefers the identification with the Ligyes (Gesch. JEgyptens, p. 578), by Unger (Manetho, p. 218), by Hale'vy {Etudes Berberes, pt. 1, Essai d’Epigr.

the Danaima/ the Shardaua,^ and others besides, who lay behind one another
on the coast. Of the second line of populations behind the region of the coast
tribes, we have up to the present no means of knowing anything with certainty.
Asia Minor, furthermore, is divided into two regions, so distinctly separated by
nature as well as by races that one would be almost inclined to regard them
as two countries foreign to each other.^ In its centre it consists of a well
defined undulating plain, having a gentle slope towards the Black Sea, and of
the shape of a kind of convex trapezium, clearly bounded towards the north
by the highlands of Pontus, and on the south by the tortuous chain of the
Taurus. A line of low hills fringes the country on the west, from the
Olympus of Mysia to the Taurus of Pisidia. Towards the east it is bounded
by broken chains of mountains of unequal height, to which the name Anti
Taurus is not very appropriately applied. An immense volcanic cone. Mount
Argreus, looks down from a height of some 13,000 feet over the wide isthmus
which connects the country with the lands of the Euphrates. This volcano is
now extinct, but it still preserved in old days something of its languishing
energy, throwing out flames ^ at intervals above the sacred forests which clothed
its slopes. The rivers having their sources in the region just described, have
not all succeeded in piercing the obstacles which separate them from the sea,
but the Pyramus and the Saras find their way into the Mediterranean and the
Iris, Halys and Sangarios into the Euxine. The others flow into the lowlands,
’ The Danauna are mentioned along with the Luku in the Amarna correspondence (BezoldBcdge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. dO, p. G5, 11. 52-55, and p. Ixi. ; cf. Delattee, Letires de Tell elAmarna, in the Proceedings Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1892-93, vol. xiv. pp. 6, 7, 8). E. de Eouge {Etude sur Monuments de Thutmes III., p. 29 ; cf. F. Lenoruant, Les Premieres Civilisations, vol. ii. p. 413, Les Antiquitds de la Troade, vol. i. pp. 73, 76, Les Origines de Vllistoire, vol. iii. pp. 46-48) tried to identify them with the Danaans ; Chabas (Atitdes sur V Antiquity historique, 2ad edit., p. 292, and Recherches -pour servir a Vhistoire de la XIXe dynastie, pp. 38 40) with the Daunians of Italy ; and Brugsch {Gesch. Mgyptens, p. 578) with the Libyans inhabiting the Tsenia of Lake Mareotis. The termination, -auna, -ona of this woi d appears to bo the ending in -awv (see a possible explanation of this term in Jensen, Vorstudien, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie,\o\. vi. pp. 68, 69) found in Asiatic names like LykaOn by the side of Lykos, Kataon by the side of Ketis and Kat-patuka; while the form of the name Danaos is preserved in Greek legend, Danaon is found only on Oriental monuments. The Danauna came “ from their islands,” that is to say, from the coasts of Asia Minor, or from Greece, the term not being pressed too literally, as the Egyptians were inclined to call all distant lands situated to the north beyond the Mediterranean Sea “islands.” * E. de Rouge {Extrait d'un m^nioire sur les Attaques dirig^es centre VEgypte par les peuples de la Me'diterranCe, pjj. 19-25) was inclined to identify the Shardana with the Sardes and the island of Sardinia; also Chabas {Etudes sur V Antiquity Historique, 2nd edit., 186, 187, 224, 298-308, 317-321, and Recherches pour servir a Vhistoire de la XIX‘ dynastie, pp. 35-38). Unger {Manetho, p. 218) made them out to be the Khartanoi of Libya, and was followed by Brugsch {Gesch. AUgyptens, pp. 578, 579). W. Max Muller {Asien und Europa, pp. 371-379) revived the hypotheses of De Rouge' and Chabas, and saw in them bands from the Italian island. I am still persuaded, as I was twenty-five years ago,
that they were Asiatics — the Mseonian tribe which gave its name to Sardis {Revue Critique, 1873, vol. i. pp. 84-86; 1878, vol. i. p. 320; 1880, vol. i. pp. 109, 110 : cf F. Lenormant, Les Antiques de la Troade, i. pp. 73, 75 ; Brugsch, Troie et VEgypte, in Schliemann, Troie, Egger’s trans., p. 983). The Serdani or Shardana are mentioned as serving in the Egyptian army in the Tel el-Amarna tablets. “ I am obliged here, for want of space, to limit my original plan. I have preserved of it only a summary description of Asia Minor, and the most necessary facts for understanding the history of Egypt and Syria.

forming meres, marshes, and lakes of fluctuating extent. The largest of these
lakes, called Tatta, is salt, and its superficial extent varies with the season.
In brief, the plateau of this region is nothing but an extension of the highlands
of Central Asia, and has the same vegetation, fauna, and climate, the same
extremes of temperature, the same aridity, and tlie same wretched and poverty
stricken character as the latter. The maritime portions are of an entirely
different aspect. The western coast which stretches into the ^Egean is furrowed
by deep valleys, opening out as they reach the sea, and the rivers — the Caicus,
the Hermos, the Cayster, and Meander—which flow through them are
effective makers of soil, bringing down with them, as they do, a continual
supply of alluvium, which, deposited at their mouths, causes the land to
encroach there upon the sea. The littoral is penetrated here and there by
deep creeks, and is fringed with beautiful islands —Lesbos, Chios, Samos, Cos,
Rhodes—of which the majority are near enough to the continent to act as
defences of the seaboard, and to guard the mouths of the rivers, while they are
far enough away to be secure from the effects of any violent disturbances
which might arise in the mainland. The Cyclades, distributed in two lines,
are scattered, as it were, at hazard between Asia and Europe, like great blocks
which have fallen around the piers of a broken bridge. The passage from one
to the other is an easy matter, and owing to them, the sea rather serves to bring
together the two continents than to divide them. Two groups of heights,
imperfectly connected with the central plateau, tower above the ..iEgean slope
wooded Ida on the north, veiled in cloud, rich in the flocks and herds upon its
sides, and in the metals within its bosom ; and on the south, the volcanic bastions
of Lycia, where tradition was wont to place the fire-breathing Chimgera. A
rocky and irregularly broken coast stretches to the west of Lycia, in a line
almost parallel with the Taurus, through which, at intervals, torrents leaping
from the heights make their way into the sea. At the extreme eastern point
of the coast, almost at the angle where the Cilician littoral meets that of Syria,
the Pyramus and the Sarus have brought down between them sufficient material
to form an alluvial plain, which the classical geographers designated by the
name of the Level Cilicia, to distinguish it from the rough region of the
interior, Cilicia Trachea.
The populations dwelling in this peninsula belong to very varied races. On
the south and south-west certain Semites had found an abode — the mysterious
inhabitants of Solyma, and especially the Phoenicians in their scattered
trading-stations.^ On the north-east, beside the Khati, distributed throughout
the valleys of the Anti-Taurus, between the Euphrates and Mount Argmus,.
there were tribes allied to the Khati '—possibly at this time the Tabal and
' See pp. 202, 203 of the present work for notices of the Phoenician trading posts.
A certain number of these tribes or of their towns are to be found in the list contained in the



THE POPULATIONS OF ASIA MINOB. 363
the Mushka—and, on the shores of the Black Sea, those workers in metal,
which, following the Greeks, we may call, for want of a better designation,
the Chalybes.^ We are at a loss to know the distribution of tribes in the
centre and. in the north-west, but the Bosphorus and the Hellespont, we may
rest assured, never formed an ethnographical frontier. The continents on
either side of them appear at this point to form the banks of a river, or the
two slopes of a single valley, whose bottom lies buried beneath the waters.
The barbarians of the Balkans had forced their way across at several points.
Dardanians were to be encountered in the neighbourhood of Mount Ida, as well
as on the banks of the Axios, from early times, and the Kebrenes of Macedonia
had colonised a district of the Troad near Ilion, while the great nation of
the Mysians had issued, like them, from the European populations of the
Hebrus and the Strymon. The hero Dardanos, according to legend, had at
first founded, under the auspices of the Idaean Zeus, the town of Dardania ; and
afterwards a portion of his progeny followed the course of the Scamander,.
and entrenched themselves upon a precipitous hill, from the top of which they
could look far and wide over the plain and sea.^ The most ancient Ilion, at
first a village, abandoned on more than one occasion in the course of centuries,
was rebuilt and transformed, earlier than the XV‘'' century before Christ, into
an important citadel, the capital of a warlike and pro.sperous kingdom. The
ruins on the spot prove the existence of a primitive civilization analogous to
that of the islands of the Archipelago before the arrival of the Phoenician
navigators.^ We find that among both, at the outset, flint and bone, clay,,
baked and unbaked, formed the only materials for their utensils and furniture;
metals were afterwards introduced, and we can trace their progressive employ
ment to the gradual exclusion of the older implements. These ancient Trojans
used copper, and we encounter only rarely a kind of bronze, in which the
proportion of tin was too slight to give the requisite hardness to the alloy, and
we find still fewer examples of iron and lead. They were fairly adroit workers
in silver, electrum, and especially in gold. The amulets, cups, necklaces,- and
jewellery discovered in their tombs or in the ruins of their houses, are some
times of a not ungraceful form. Their pottery was made by hand, and was
not painted or varnished, but they often gave to it a fine lustre by means of a
stone-polisher.^ Other peoples of uncertain origin, but who had attained a
treaty of Eamses II. with the Khati (11. 26-30 ; of. Boueiant, Fotes de Voyage, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xii. pp. 157-160, and W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 334, 335). ‘ Ed. Meyer, GeschicMe des Konigsreichs Pontos, pp. 11, 12, and C. de Cara, Gli Hetei-Pelasgi, vol. i. pp. 548-565, have brought together the greater part of the scattered notices we have of these races. ^ See the monograph of Ed. Meyer, GeacMchte von Troas, p. 9, et seq., for all the legends relating to the earliest Trojan population. ® See pp. 201, 202 of the present work. * For information on this early civilization, consult, in default of Schliemann’s Ilios and Troja, where the materials are scattered, the summary of them given by Peerot-Chipiez, Histoire de VArt, pp. 151—258, or Ed.

3G4 THE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
civilization as advanced as that of the Trojans, were the Maeonians, the
Leleges, and the Carians who had their abode to the south of Troy and of the
Mysians. The Maeonians held sway in the fertile valleys of the Hermos,
Cayster, and Maeander. They were divided into several branches, such as the
Lydians, the Tyrseni, the Torrhebi, and the Shardana, but their most ancient
traditions looked back with pride to a flourishing state to which, as they alleged*
they had all belonged long ago on the slopes of Mount Sipylos, between the
valley of the Hermos and the Gulf of Smyrna. The traditional capital of this
kingdom was Magnesia, the most ancient of cities, the residence of Tantalus,
the father of Niobe and the Pelopidse. The Leleges rise up before us from
many points at the same time, but always connected with the most ancient
memories of Greece and Asia. The majority of the strongholds on the
Trojan coast belonged to them —such as Antandros and Gargara—and Pedasos
on the Satniois boasted of having been one of their colonies, while several
other towns of the same name, but very distant from each other, enable us to
form some idea of the extent of their migrations.^ In the time of Strabo,
ruined tombs and deserted sites of cities were shown in Caria which the natives
regarded as Lelegia—that is, abode of the Leleges.^ The Carians were domi
nant in the southern angle of the peninsula and in the Aegean Islands ; and
the Lyciaus lay next them on the east, and were sometimes confounded with
them. One of the most powerful tribes of tlie Carians, the Tremilae, were in tire
eyes of the Greeks hardly to be separated from the mountainous district which
they knew as Lycia proper ; while other tribes extended as far as the Halys.
A district of the Troad, to tlie south of Mount Ida, was called Lycia, and there
was a Lycaonia on both sides of the Middle Taurus ; while Attica had its
Lycia, and Crete its Lycians. These three nations — the Lycians, Carians, and
Leleges — were so entangled together from their origin, that no one would
venture now to trace the lines of demarcation between them, and we are often
obliged to apply to them collectively what can be appropriately ascribed to
only one.
How far the Hittite power extended in the first years of its expansion we
have now hardly the means of knowing. It would appear that it took within
its scope, on the south-west, the Cilician plain, and the undulating region
bordering on it—that of Qodi : the prince of the latter distiict, if not his vassal,
was at least the colleague of the King of the Khati, and he acted in concert
’ Accoriling to tlie scholiast ou Nicander {Tlier., v. 804), the word “Pedasos” signified “mountain,” probably in the language of the Leleges. "Wo know up to the present of four Pedasi, or Pedasa: the first in Messenia (Stkabo, VIII. iv. § 3, p. 551), which later on took tlie name of Methone; the second in the Troad, ou the banks of the Satniois (Stbabo, XIII. i. § 7, p. 584); the third in the neighbourhood of Cyzicus (Agathocles, §4,in Mulleb-Didot, Frag. Hist. Greec., vol. iv. p. 289; and the fourth in Caria. * AVith regard to the Ijeleges, consult the somewhat confused work of Df jimlek.

with him in peace as well as in war.^ It embraced also the upper basin of
the Pyramos and its affluents, .as well as the regions situated between the
Euphrates and the Halys, but its frontier in this direction was continually
fluctuating, and our researches fail to follow it. It is somewhat probable that
it extended considerably towards the west and north-west in the direction of
the ^Egean Sea. The forests and escarpments of Lycaonia, and the desolate
steppes of the central plateau, have always presented a barrier difficult to
surmount by any invader from the east. If the Khati at that period attacked
it in front, or by a flank movement, the assault must rather have been of the
nature of a hurried reconnaissance, or of a raid, than of a methodically
conducted campaign.^ They must have preferred to obtain possession of the
valleys of the Thermodon and the Iris, which were rich in mineral wealth,
and from which they could have secured an inexhaustible revenue. The ex
traction and working of metals in this region had attracted thither from time
immemorial merchants from neighbouiing and distant countries — at first from
the south to supply the needs of Syria, Chaldaea, and Egypt, then from the
west for the necessities of the countries on the ^gean. The roads, which,
starting from the archipelago on the one hand, or the Euphrates on the
other, met at this point, fell naturally into one, and thus formed a continuous
route, along which the caravans of commerce, as well as warlike expeditions,
might henceforward pass. Starting from the cultivated regions of Maeonia,
the road proceeded up the valley of the Hermos from west to east ; then,
scaling the heights of the central plateau and taking a direction more and
more to the north-east, it reached the fords of the Halvs. Crossing this river
twice— for the first time at a point about two-thirds the length of its course,
and for the second at a short distance from its source—it made an abrupt
turn towards the Taurus, and joined, at Melitene, the routes leading to
the Upper Tigris, to Nisibis, to Singara, and to Old Assur, and connecting
further down beyond the mountainous region, under the walls of Carchemish,
with the roads which led to the Nile and to the river-side cities on the Persian
Gulf.® There were other and shorter routes, if we think only of the number
* The country of Qidi, Qadi, Qodi, has been connected by Chabas with Galilee {Voyage d'un Egyptien, pp. 108, 109), and Brugsch adopted the identification {Gesch. A^gyplens, p. 549). W. Max Muller identified it with Phoenicia {Asien und Europe, pp. 242-248). I think the name served to designate the Cilician coast and plain from the mouth of the Oronles, and the country which was known in the Graco-Eoman period by the name Ketis and Kataonia (Maspero, De Carchemis Oppidi Situ, map 2 ; cf. Satce, Monuments of the Eittites, in Trans. Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. vii. pp. 285, 289; F. Lenormant, Les Orig. de VHist., vol. iii. p. 72, et seq. ; Ed. Meyer, Gesch. des Altertums, vol. i. p. 277). “ The idea of a Hittite empire extending over almost all Asia Minor was advanced by Sajee {Monuments of the Hittitfs, in the Transactions Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. vii. pp. 268-293 ; cf. SayceMenant, Les HdtlVens, Eistoire d'un Empire ouhlid, p. 75, et seq.; Weight, The Empire of the Eittites, 1st edit., pp. 45-61). This view has been opposed by Hirschfeld {Die Felsenreliefs in Kleinasien, pp. 7, 8, 45, et sc q.), defended by Eamsay {Eist. Geog. of Asia Minor, pp. 38, 39, and Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, vol. i. pp. xiii.-xv.), and by Eadet (La Lydia et le Monde Grec., etc., p. 24, et leq.). ® The very early existence of this road, which partly coincides with the royal route of the Persian Achemenids, was proved by Kiepert, Ueber die Persische Konigsstrasse durch Vordi ratien nack

of miles, from the Hermos in Pisiclia or Lycaonia, across the central steppe
and through the Cilician Gates, to the meeting of the ways at Carchemish
but they led through wretched regions, without industries, almost without
tillage, and inhospitable alike to man and beast, and they were ventured on
only by those who aimed at trafficking among the populations who lived in
their neighbourhood^ The Khati, from the time even when they were
enclosed among the fastnesses of the Taurus, had within their control the most
important section of the great land route which served to maintain regular
relations between the ancient kingdoms of the east and the rising states of
the JEgean, and whosoever would pass through their country had to pay them
toll. The conquest of Naharaim, in giving them control of a new section,
placed almost at their discretion the whole traffic between Chaldsea and Egypt.
From the time of Thutmosis III. caravans employed in this traffic accom
plished the greater part of their journey in territories depending upon Babylon,
Assyria, or Memphis, and enjoyed thus a relative security; the terror of the
Pharaoh protected the travellers even when they were no longer in his domains,
and he saved them from the flagrant exactions made npon them by princes
who called themselves his brothers, or were actually his vassals.^ But the
time had now come when merchants had to encounter, between Qpdshu and
the banks of the Khabur, a sovereign owing no allegiance to any one, and
who would tolerate no foreign interference in his territory. From the out
break of hostilities with the Khati, Egypt could communicate with the cities
of the Lower Euphrates only by the Wadys of the Arabian Desert, which
were always dangerous and difficult for large convoys;^ and its commercial
relations with Chaldma were practically brought thus to a standstill, and, as
a consequence, the manufactures which fed this trade being reduced to a
limited production, the fiscal receipts arising from it experienced a sensible
diminution. When peace was restored, matters fell again into their old groove,
with certain reservations to the Khati of some common privileges : Egypt,
which had formerly possessed these to her own advantage, now bore the
burden of them, and the indirect tribute which she paid in this manner to
lier rivals furnished them with arms to fight her in case she should endeavour
to free herself from the imposition. All the semi-barbaric peoples of the

TEE TREATY BETWEEN EARMHABI AND SAPALTJLU. 367
They were always willing to set out on an expedition, under the leadership of
some chief of noble family or renowned for valour ; sometimes by sea in their
light craft, which would bring them unexpectedly to the nearest point of the
Syrian coast, sometimes by land in companies of foot-soldiers and charioteers.
They were frequently fortunate enough to secure plenty of booty, and return
with it to their homes safe and sound ; but as frequently they would meet with
reverses by falling into some ambuscade : in such a case their conqueror would
not put them to the sword' or sell them as slaves, but would promptly incor
porate them into his army, thus making his captives into his soldiers. The
King of the Ehati was able to make use of them without difficulty, for his
empire was conterminous on the west and north with some of their native
lands, and he had often whole regiments of them in his army—Mysians,^
Lycians, people of Augarit,^ of Ilion,^ and of Pedasos.^ The revenue of the
provinces taken from Egypt, and the products of his tolls, furnished him with
abundance of means for obtaining recruits from among them.®
All these things contributed to make the power of the Khati so consider
able, that Harmhabi, when he had once tested it, judged it prudent not to join
issues with them. He concluded with Sapalulu a treaty of peace and friendship,
’ Attempts were made to identify the Mausu with the Mysians by E. de Rouge' (^Extrait d'un M^moire sur les Attaques dirigges contre VEgypte par les peuples de la M^diterran^e, p. 4) ; and this view, adopted by Chabas (^Etudes sur VAntiquity historique, 2nd edit., p. 185), has been disputed without sufiScient reason by Brugsch (Gescfe. ASgypiens, pp. 578, 579), by Ed. Meyer {Gesch. des Alterlums, vol. i. p. 278, and Geseh. des Alien AEgyptens, p. 281), and by W. Max Miiller (Asien und Europa, p. 355). “ The country of Augarit, Ugarit, is mentioned on several occasions in the Tel el-Amarna correspondence (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 1, p. 3, 1. 39 ; No. 30, p. 65, 11. 55-57 ; cf. Delattee, Lettres de Tell el-Amarna, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp. 24, 27, 29, and 1892-93, vol. xv. pp. 506-508). The name has been wrongly associated with
Caria (F. Lenokmant, Les Origines de I’Histoire, vol. iii. p. 73); it has been placed by W. Max Muller {Asien und Europa, pp. 262-269) well within Naharaim, to the east of the Orontes, between Khalybon (Aleppo) and Apamaea, the writer confusing it with Akaiti, named in the campaign of Amenothes II. (see pp. 291, 292 of the present work). lam not sure about the site, but its association in the Amarna letters with Gugu and Khanigalbat inclines me to place it beyond the northern slopes of the Taurus, possibly on the banks of the Halys or of the Upper Euphrates. ^ The name of this people was read Eiuna by Champollion, who identified it with the lonians {Grammaire Hi^roglypMque, p. 151, and Dictionnaire, p. 66 ; cf. Rosellini, Monumenti Storici, vol. iii. p. 426) ; this reading and identification were adopted by Lenormant {Les Origines, vol. iii. p. 353) and by W. Max Muller {Asien und Europa, pp. 369-371). Chabas hesitates between Eiuna and Maihna, Ionia and Mseonia {Etudes sur V Antiquity Historique, 2nd edit., p. 185), and Brugsch read it Malunna {Geseh. ASgyptens, p. 491). Tlie reading Iriuna, Iliuna, seems to me the only possible one {Les Him, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. viii. p. 84), and the identification with Ilion as well. * E. de Rouge thought that Pidasa, owing to the transposition of letters, was for Pisada, Pisidia {Cours professes au College de France, in the Melanges d' ArchMogie, etc., vol. ii. p. 267), and this opinion has been adopted by W. Max Miiller {Asien und Europa, p. 355). Owing to its association with the Dardanians, Mysians, and Ilion, I think it answers to the Pedasos on the Satniois near Troy (Maspeeo, De Carcliemis oppidi situ, pp. 57, 58). ® E. de Rouge and the Egyptologists who followed him thought at first that the troops designated in the Egyptian texts as Lycians, Mysians, Dardanians, were the national armies of these nations, each one commanded by its king, who had hastened from Asia Minor to succour their ally the King of the Kh§,ti. I now think that these were bands of adventurers, consisting of soldiers belonging to these nations, who came to put themselves at the service of civilized monarchs, as the Oarians, lonians, and the Greeks of various cities did later on ; the individuals whom the texts mention as their princes were not the kings of these nations, but the warrior chiefs to which each band gave obedience.



368 THE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
which, leaving the two powers in possession respectively of the territory
each then occupied, gave legal sanction to the extension of the sphere of the
Khati at the expense of Egypt.^ Syria continued to consist of two almost equal
parts, stretching from Byblos to the sources of the Jordan and Damascus:
the northern portion, formerly tributary to Egypt, became a Hittite possession ;
while the southern, consisting of Phoenicia and Canaan,^ which the Pharaoh
had held for a long time with a more effective authority, and had more fully
occupied, was retained for Egypt. This could have been but a provisional
arrangement : if Thebes had not altogether renounced the hope of repossessing
some day the lost conquests of Thutmosis III., the Khati, drawn by the same
instinct which had urged them to cross their frontiers towards the south, were
not likely to be content with less than the expulsion of the Egyptians from
Syria, and the absorption of the whole country into the Hittite dominion.
Peace was maintained during Harmhabi’s lifetime. We know^ nothing of
Egyptian affairs during the last years of his reign. His rule may have come
to an end owing to some court intrigue, or he may have had no male heir to
follow him.^ Eamses, who succeeded him, did not belong to the royal line, or
was only remotely connected with it."^ He was already an old man when he
ascended the throne, and we ought perhaps to identify him with one or other
of the Ramses who flourished under the last Pharaohs of the XVIIP'' dynasty,
* It is not certain that Harmhabi was the Pharaoh with whom Sapalulu entered into treaty, and it might be insisted with some reason that Ramses I. was the party to it on the side of Egypt (Brugsch, Gesoh. A^gpptens, pp. 456, 457); but this hypothesis is rendered less probable by the fact of the extremely short reign of the latter Pharaoh. I am inclined to think, as W. Max Muller has supposed (Asien und Europa, p. 392, note 1), that the passage in the Treaty of Ramses II. with the Prince of the Khali (11. 5-7), which speaks of a treaty concluded with Sapalulu, looks back to the time of Eamses IP’s predecessor, Harmhabi. ^ This follows from the situation of the two empires, as indicated in the account of the campaign of Seti I. in his first year. The king, after having defeated the nomads of the Arabian desert, passed on without further fighting into the country of the Amurru and the regions of the Lebanon (see p. 371 of the present work), which fact seems to imply the submission of Kharu. W. Max Muller was the first to discern clearly this part of the history of Egyptian conquest {Asien und Europa, pp. 275, 276) ; he appears, however, to have circumscribed somewhat too strictly the dominion of Harmhabi in assigning Carmel as its limit. The list of the nations of the north who yielded, or are alleged to have yielded, submission to Harmhabi, were traced on the first pylon of this monarch at Karnak, and on its adjoining walls ; what remains of this list has been reproduced by Bouriant, Lettre a M. W. Max Muller sur le mur d' Iloremheb a Karnnh, in the Reeueil de Travaux, vol. xvii. pp. 41-43. Among others, the names of the Khati and of Arvad are to be read there. “ It would appear, from an Ostracon in the British Museum (Birch, Inscriptions in the Hieratic
and Demotic Characters, pi. xiv.. No. 5624, that the year XXL follows after the year VII. of Harmhahi’s reign (Brugsch, Die Gruppe man, in the Zeitschrift, 1876, pp. 122-124, and Gesch. ASgyptens, pp. 447, 448 ; cf. Wiedemann, .^gypthche Geschichte, p. 411); it is possible that the year XXI. may belong to one of Harmhabi’s successors, Seti I. or Ramses II., for example. •* The eflbrts to connect Ramses I. with a family of Semitic origin, possibly the Shepherd-kings themselves, have not heen successful (E. de Rouge, Lettre a M. Guigniaut, in the Revue Arche'ologique, 2nd series, vol. ix. p. 132; Mariette, Deuxieme Lettre a M. le vicomte de Rougd' sur les fouilles de Tanis, p. 2 ; La Stele de Van 400, p. 5 ; Chabas, Les Ramses sont-ils de la race des Pasteurs? Etudes sur la Stele de Van 400, in the Zeitschrift, 1865, pp. 29-38). Everything goes to prove that the Ramses family was, and considered itself to be, of Egyptian origin. Brugsch {Gesch. ASgyptens, p. 456) and Ed. Meyer {Gesch. JEgyptens, p. 274) were inclined to see in Eamses I. a younger brother of Harmhabi. This hypothesis has nothing either for or against it up to the present (Wiedemann, Gesch., p. 413).



HAMSES L AND EIS UNCERTAIN ORIOIN. 369
perhaps the one who governed Thebes under Khuniatonu/ or another, who
began but never finished his tomb in the hillside above Tel el-Amarna, in
the burying-place of the worshippers of the Disk. He had held important
•offices under Harmhabi,^ and had obtained in marriage for his son Seti the
hand of Tuia, who, of all the royal family, possessed the strongest rights to
the crown.^ Eamses reigned only six or seven years, and associated Seti with
•himself in the government from his second
expedition into Ethiopia, and perhaps a
raid into Syria ; and we find remains of
his monuments in Nubia, at Bohani near
Wady Haifa, and at Thebes, in the temple
•of Amon.® He displayed little activity,
bis advanced age preventing him from
entering on any serious undertaking : but
his accession nevertheless marks an im
portant date in the history of Egypt.
Although Harmhabi was distantly con
nected with the line of the Ahmessides, it
is difficult at the present day to know what position to assign him in the
Pharaonic lists : while some regard him as the last of the XVIIP* dynasty,
others prefer to place him at the head of the XIX^‘\ No such hesitation, how
ever, exists with regard to Eamses I., who was undoubtedly the founder of a new
family. The old familiar names ofThutmosis and Amenothes henceforward dis
appear from the royal lists, and are replaced by others, such as Seti, Minephtah,
* Cf. what is said about this Eamses, governor of Thebes, pp. 324, 325, supra. “ Boueiant, Deux jours de fouilles a Tell el-Amarna, in M€moires de la Mission franoaise, vol. i. pp. 9-11. This Tel el-Amarna Eamses is, perhaps, identical with the Theban one: he may have followed his master to his new capital, and have had a tomb dug for himself there, which he subsequently abandoned, on the death of Khuniatonu, in order to return to Thebes with Tutankhamen and Ai. ® Maspeeo, Essai sur Vinscription d’Abydos, pp. 68-70, and Revue Critique, 1870, vol. ii. p. 35.
The fact that the marriage was celebrated under the auspices of Harmhabi, and that, consequently, Eamses must have occupied an important position at the court of that prince, is proved by the appearance of Eamses 11., son of Tuia, as early as the first year of Seti, among the ranks of the combatants in the war carried on by that prince against the Tihonu (Cuampollion, Monuments, pi. ccscvii. 2) ; even granting that he was then ten years old (cf. p. 386, infra), we are forced to admit that he must have been born before his grandfather came to the throne. There is in the Vatican a statue of Tuia which has been remarked on by Lepsics, Notice sur deux statues dgyptiennes, in the Annales de VInstitut de Correspondance Arch^ologique, vol. iv. pp. 5-11, and pi. xl. ; other statues have been discovered at San (Makiette, Notice sur les principaux Monuments du Muse'e de Boulaq, 1864, p. 267, and Fragments ei Documents relatifs aux Fouilles de San, in the Reeueil de Travaux, vol. ix. pp. 14, 15; Peteie, Tanis, vol. i. pi. ii., No. 11, and vol. ii. p. 17).

and, especially, Eamses, which now figure in them for the first time. The
princes who bore these names showed themselves worthy successors of those
who had raised Egypt to the zenith of her power ; like them they were
successful on the battle-field, and like them they devoted the best of the
spoil to building innumerable monuments. No sooner had Seti celebrated
his father’s obsequies, than he assembled his army and set out for war.
It would appear that Southern Syria was then in open revolt. “Word had
been brought to His Majesty : ‘ The vile Shausii have plotted rebellion ; the
chiefs of their tribes, assembled in one place on the confines of Kharu, have
been smitten with blindness and with the spirit of violence ; every one cutteth
his neighbour’s throat.”^ It was imperative to send succour to the few tribes
who remained faithful, to prevent them from succumbing to the repeated
attacks of the insurgents. Seti crossed the frontier at Zalu, but instead of
pursuing his way along the coast, he marched due east in order to attack the
Shausu in the very heart of the desert. The road ran through wide wadys,
tolerably well supplied with water, and the length of the stages necessarily
depended on the distances between the wells. This route was one frequented
in early times, and its security was ensured by a number of fortresses and
isolated towers built along it, such as “ The House of the Lion ”—ta ait fa
mail — near the pool of the same name, the Migdol of the springs of Huzina,
the fortress of Uazit, the Tower of the Brave, and the Migdol of Seti at the
pools of Absakaba.^ The Bedawin, disconcerted by the rapidity of this move
ment, oftered no serious resistance. Their flocks were carried olf, their trees
cut down, their harvests destroyed, and they surrendered their strongholds at
discretion. Pushing on from one halting-place to another, the conqueror soon
reached Eabbiti, and finally Pakanana.® The latter town occupied a splendid

They have been tabulated and examined by Bkugsch, Reiseberichte aus ADgypten, pp. 149-157, and GescMchte Mgijptens, pp. 458-469 ^ then by Lauth, Ueber Sethosis’ TrfMmp/tzMgf, in the Keports of the Proceedings of the Munich Academy of Sciences, 1889, vol. i. pp. 319-355, and by Lushington, The Victories of Seti I. recorded in the Great Temple at Karnah, in the Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, vol. vii. pp. 509534 ; lastly, the texts have been carefully edited and translated by Gvieysse, Inscription Historique de S^i I", in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xi. pp. 52-77. * Brugsch has endeavoured to map out the route followed by Seti I., and his deductions led him to carry it to the south of the Dead Sea (^Dictionnaire G^ographique, pp. 590-597, and GescMchte AUgyptens, pp. 459, 460). I agree with Tomkins (T/je Fortress of Canaan, in the Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statements, 1884, pp. 59, 60) in thinking that the line followed by the Egyptian army coincided for tlie most part witli the route explored by Holland (A Journey on Foot through Arabia Petrsea, in the Quart. Stat, 1879, pp. 70-72 ; cf. Wilson, Notes to accompany a Map of the late Rev. F. IK. Holland's Journey, in the Quart. Stat., 1884, pp. 4-15). ’ The site of Pakanana has, with much probability, been fixed by Conder {The Fortress of Canaan, in the Quart. Statements, 1883, pp. 175, 176; cf. Tomkins, The Fortress of Canaan, in the Quart. Statements, 18Si, pp. 57-61) at El-Kenan or Khurbet-Kanaan, to the south of Hebron.

position on the slope of a rocky hill, close to a small lake, and defended tlie
approaches to the vale of Hebron. It surrendered at the first attack, and by
its fall the Egyptians became possessed of one of the richest provinces in the
southern part of Kharu. This result having been achieved, Seti took the
caravan road to his left, on the further side of Gaza, and pushed forward at full
speed towards the Hittite frontier. It was probably unprotected by any troops.

and the Hittite king was absent in some other part of his empire. Seti pillaged
the Amurru, seized lanuamu and Qodshu by a sudden attack, marched in an
oblique direction towards the Mediterranean, forcing the inhabitants of the
Lebanon to cut timber from their mountains for the additions which he was
premeditating in the temple of the Theban Amon, and finally returned by the
coast road, receiving, as he passed through their territory, the homage of
the Phoenicians. His entry into Egypt was celebrated by solemn festivities.
The nobles, priests, and princes of both south and north hastened to meet him
at the bridge of Zalu, and welcomed, with their chants, both the king and
261, vol. ii. p. 51 : cf. Lavth, Ueher Sethosig’ Triumphzug, pp. 337, 338), but Chabas rightly contested this view {Voyage d’un Egyptien, pp. 112, 113). W. Max Miiller took up the matter afresh : he perceived that we have here an allusion to the first town encountered by Seti I. in the country of Canaan to the south-west of Eaphia, the name of which is not mentioned by the Egyptian sculptor {Asien und Europa, pp. 149, 205, 206) ; it seems to me that this name should be Pakanaiia, and that the town bore the same name as the country. ‘ Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugscli-Bey.



372 THE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
the troops of captives whom lie was hringiug back for the service of his
lather Amoii at Karuak2 The delight of his subjects was but natural,
since for many years the Egyptians had not witnessed such a triumph, and
they no doubt believed that the prosperous era of Thutmosis III. was about
to return, and that the wealth of Naharaim would once more flow into Thebes
as of old. Their illusion was short-lived, for this initial victory was followed
by no other. Maurusaru, King of the Khati, and subsequently his son Mau
tallu, withstood the Pharaoh with such resolution that he was forced to
treat with them. A new alliance was concluded on the same conditions as
the old one, and the boundaries of the two kingdoms remained the same as
under Harmhabi, a proof that neither sovereign had gained any advantage
over his rival.'-^ Hence the campaign did not in any way restore Egyptian
supremacy, as had been hoped at the moment ; it merely served to strengthen
her authority in those provinces which the Khati had failed to take from Egypt.
The Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon had too many commercial interests on the
banks of the Nile to dream of breaking the slender tie which held them to the
Pharaoh, since independence, or siibmission to another sovereign, might have
ruined their trade. The Kharu and the Beda\\in, vanquished wherever they
bad ventured to oppose the Pharaoh’s troops, were less than ever capable of
throwing off the Egyptian yoke. Syria fell back into its former state. The
local princes once more resumed their intrigues and quarrels, varied at intervals
by appeals to their suzerain for justice or succour. The “Koyal Messengers”
appeared from time to time with their escorts of archers and chariots to claim
tribute, levy taxes, to make peace between quarrelsome vassals, or, if the case
required it, to supersede some iusubordinate chief by a governor of undoubted
loyalty ; in line, the entire administration of the empire was a continuation
of that of the preceding century.^ The peoples of Kush meanwhile had
remained quiet during the campaign in Syria, and on the western frontier
the Tihonu had suffered so severe a defeat that they were not likely to
recover from it for some time.'^ The bands of pirates, Shardana and others, who
infested the Delta, were hunted down, and the prisoners taken from among them

lion marauding abroad by hidden paths,” ^ and Egypt enjoyed a profound
peace in consequence of his ceaseless vigilance.
A peaceful policy of this kind did not, of course, produce the amount ot
spoil and the endless relays of captives which had enabled his predecessors to
raise temples and live in great luxury without overburdening their subjects
with taxes. Seti was, therefore, the more anxious to do all in his power to
develop the internal wealth of the country. The mining colonies of tbe
Sinaitic Peninsula had never ceased working since operations had been resumed
* We gather this, as E. de Eouge points out (Exiraii (I'lin M^moire sur leu aitaques dingoes par les
peuples de la nier, pp. 23, 24:), from passages in the inscriptions from the year V. onwards, in which
Eamses II. boasts that he has a number of Shardana prisoners in his guard ; Eouge was, perhaps, mistaken in magnifying these piratical raids into a war of invasion. ^ Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Emil Brugscli-Bey.

were incorporated into the royal guard. ^ Seti, however, does not appear to
have had a confirmed taste for war. He showed energy when occasion required
it, and he knew how to lead his soldiers, as the expedition of his first year
amply proved ; but when the necessity was over, he remained on the defensive,
and made no further attempt at conquest. By his own choice he was “the
jackal who prowls about the country to protect it,” rather than “the wizard

there under Hatsbopsilu and Thutmosis III., but the output had lessened
during the troubles under the heretic kings.^ Seti sent inspectors thither, and
endeavoured to stimulate the workmen to their former activity, but apparently
with no great success.^ We are not able to ascertain if he continued the
revival of trade with Puanit inaugurated by Harmhabi ;
^ but at any rate he
concentrated his attention on the regions bordering the Eed Sea and the gold
mines which they contained. Those of Etbai, which had been worked as early
as the XIP* dynasty, did not yield as much as they had done formerly ; not
that they were exhausted, but owing to the lack of water in their neighbour
hood and along the routes leading to them, they were nearly deserted. It
was well known that they contained great wealth, but operations could not be
carried on, as the workmen were in danger of dying of thirst. Seti despatched
engineers to the spot to explore the surrounding wadys, to clear the ancient
cisterns or cut others, and to establish victualling stations at regular intervals
for the use of merchants supplying the gangs of miners with commodities.
These stations generally consisted of square or rectangular enclosures, built
of stones without mortar, and capable qf resisting a prolonged attack. The
entrance was by a narrow doorway of stone slabs, and in the interior were a few
huts and one or two reservoirs for catching rain or storing the water of
neighbouring springs. Sometimes a chapel was built close at hand, consecrated
to the divinities of the desert, or to their compeers, Minu of Coptos, Horus,
Maut, or Isis. One of these, founded by Seti, still exists near the modern
town of Kedesieh, at the entrance to one of the valleys which furrow this gold
region. It is built against, and partly excavated in, a wall of rock, the face

Ethiopia, and, better still, the regular payment of taxes and custom-house duties,,
went to make up for the lack of foreign spoil all the more opportunely, for,
although the sovereign did not share the military enthusiasm of Thutmosis III.,
he had inherited from him the passion for expensive temple-building. He
did not neglect Nubia in this respect, but repaired several of the monuments

traces of the misfortunes lately brought about by the changes effected by the
heretic kings, had contemplated building at Karnak, in front of the pylon of
Amenothes III., an enormous hall for the ceremonies connected with the cult of
Amon, where the immense numbers of priests and worshippers at festival
times could be accommodated without inconvenience. It devolved on Seti to
carryout what had been merely an ambitious dream of his father’s.^ We long
to know who was the architect possessed of such confidence in his powers that he

ventured to design, and was able to carry out, this almost superhuman under
taking. His name would be held up to almost universal admiration beside
those of the greatest masters that we are familiar with, for no one in Greece or
Italy has left us any work which surpasses it, or which with such simple means
could produce a similar
impression of boldness
and immensity. It is
almost impossible to
convey by words to those
who have not seen it
the impression which it
makes on the spectator.
Failing description, the
dimensions speak for
themselves. The hall
measures one hundred
and sixty - two feet in
length, by three hundred
and twenty - five in
breadth. A row of twelve
columns, the largest ever
placed inside a building,
runsupthe centre, having
capitals in the form of
inverted bells. One
hundred and twenty-two
columns with lotiform
capitals fill the aisles, in
rows of nine each. The roof of the central bay is seventy-four feet above the
ground, and the cornice of the two towers rises sixty-three feet higher. The
building was dimly lighted from the roof of the central colonnade by means
of stone gratings, through which the air and the sun’s rays entered sparingly.
The daylight, as it penetrated into the hall, was rendered more and more
obscure by the rows of columns ; indeed, at the further end a perpetual twilight
must have reigned, pierced by narrow shafts of light falling from the ventilation
holes which were placed at intervals in the roof. The whole building now lies
open to the sky, and the sunshine which floods it, pitilessly reveals the mutilations

which it has suffered in the course of ages ; but the general effect, though less
mysterious, is none the less overwhelming. It is the only monument in which
the first coup d'ceil surpasses the expectations of the spectator instead of dis
appointing him. The
size is immense, and we
realise its immensity
the more fully as we
search our memory in
vain to find anything
with which to compare
it. Seti may have en
tertained the project of
building a replica of this
hall in Southern Thebes.
Amenothes III. had left
his temple at Luxor
unfinished. The sanc
tuary and its surround
ing buildings were used
for purposes of worship,
but the court of the
customary pylon was
wanting, and merely a
thin wall concealed the
mysteries from the sight
of the vulgar. Seti re
solved to extend the
building in a northerly
direction, without in
terfering with the thin screen which had satisfied his predecessors.
Starting from the entrance in this wall, he planned an avenue of giant
columns rivalling those of Karnak, which he destined to become the central
colonnade of a hypostyle hall as vast as that of the sister temple. Either
money or time was lacking to carry out his intention. He died before the
aisles on either side were even begun.^ At Abydos, however, he was more
successful. We do not know the reason of Seti’s particular affection for this

town ; it is possible that his family held some fief there, or it may be that he
desired to show the peculiar estimation in which he held its local god, and
intended, by the homage that he lavished on him, to cause the fact to be
forgotten that he bore the name of Sit the accursed. The king selected a
favourable site for his temple to the south of the town, on the slope of a sand
hill bordering the canal, and he marked out in the hardened soil a ground plan

of considerable originality.^ The building was approached through two pylons,,
the remains of which are now hidden under the houses of Aarabat el
Madfuneh. A fairly large courtyard, bordered by two crumbling walls, lies
between the second pylon and the temple facade, which was composed of
a portico resting on square pillars. Passing between these, we reach two
halls supported by columns of graceful outline, beyond which are eight chapels
arranged in a line, side by side, in front of two chambers built in to the hill
side, and destined for the reception of Osiris. The holy of holies in ordinary
temples is surrounded by chambers of lesser importance, but here it is con
cealed behind them. The building-material mainly employed here was the
white limestone of Tiirah, but of a most beautiful quality, which lent itself to

the execution of bas-reliefs of great delicacy, perhaps the finest in ancient Egypt.
The artists who carved and painted them belonged to the Theban school,
and while their subjects betray a remarkable similarity to those of the monuments
dedicated by Amenothes III., the execution surpasses them in freedom and per
fection of modelling; we can, in fact, trace in them the influence of the artists who
furnished the drawings for the scenes at Tel el-Amarna. They have represented
tlie gods and goddesses with the same type of profile as that of the king
type of face of much purity and gentleness, with its aquiline nose, its decided
mouth, almond-shaped eyes, and melancholy smile. When the decoration of
the temple was completed, Seti regarded the building as too small for its
divine inmate, and accordingly added to it a new wing, which he built along
the whole length of the southern wall ; but he was unable to finish it com
pletely. Several parts of it are lined with religious representations, but in others
the subjects have been merely sketched out in black ink with corrections in
red, while elsewhere the walls are bare, except for a few inscriptions, scribbled
over them after an interval of twenty centuries by the monks who turned the
temple chambers into a convent. This new wing was connected with the
second hypostyle hall of the original building by a passage, on one of
the walls of which is a list of seventy-five royal names, representing the
ancestors of the sovereign traced back to Mini. The whole temple must be
regarded as a vast funerary chapel, and no one who has studied the religion
of Egypt can entertain a doubt as to its purpose. Abydos was the place
where the dead assembled before passing into the other world. It was here,
at the mouth of the “ Cleft,” that they received the provisions and offerings
of their relatives and friends who remained on this earth. As the dead flocked
hither from all quarters of the world, they collected round the tomb of Osiris,
and there waited till the moment came to embark on the Boat of the Sun.^
Seti did not wish his soul to associate with those of the common crowd of his
vassals, and prepared this temple for himself, as a separate resting-place, close
to the mouth of Hades. After having dwelt within it for a short time sub
sequent to his funeral, his soul could repair thither whenever it desired,
certain of always finding within it the incense and the nourishment of which
it stood in need.
Thebes possessed this king’s actual tomb. The chapel was at Qurnah,
a little to the north of the group of pyramids in which the Pharaohs of the
XP'' dynasty lay side by side with those of the XIIP" and XVIP''. Ramses
had begun to build it, and Seti continued the work, dedicating it to the
cult of his father and of himself. Its pylon has altogether disappeared, but
the fafade with lotus-bud columns is nearly perfect, together with several

of the chambers in front of the sanctuary. The decoration is as carefully
carried out and the execution as delicate as that in the work at Abydos
we are tempted to believe from one or two examples of it that the same hands
have worked at both buildingsd The rock-cut tomb is some distance away
up in the mountain, but not in the same ravine as that in which Amenothes III.,

from the plain only by dangerous paths above the temple of Hatshopsitu.
This basin is divided into two parts, one of which runs in a south
easterly direction, while the other trends to the south-west, and is sub
divided into minor branches. To the east rises a barren peak, the outline
of which is not unlike that of the step-pyramid of Saqqara, reproduced on
a colossal scale. No spot could be more appropriate to serve as a cemetery for
a family of kings. The difficulty of reaching it and of conveying thither the
heavy accessories and of providing for the endless processions of the Pharaonic
funerals, prevented any attempt being made to cut tombs in it during the

Ancient and Middle Empires. About the beginning of the XIX‘'' dynasty, how
ever, some engineers, in search of suitable burial sites, at length noticed that this
basin was only separated from the wady issuing to the north of Qurnah by a rocky
barrier barely five hundred cubits in width. This presented no formidable obstacle
to such skilful engineers as the Egyptians. They cut a trench into the living
rock some fifty or sixty cubits in depth, at the bottom of which they tunnelled
a narrow passage giving access to the valley.^ It is not known \\'hether this
herculean work uas accomplished during the reign of Harmhabi or in that of
Eamses I. The latter was the first of the Pharaohs to honour the spot by his
presence. His tomb is simple, almost coarse in its workmanship, and comprises
a gently inclined passage, a vault and a sarcophagus of rough stone.^ That of
Seti, on the contrary, is a veritable palace, extending to a distance of 325 feet
into the mountain-side. It is entered by a wide and lofty door, which opens
•on to a staircase of twenty-seven steps, leading to an inclined corridor ; other
staircases of shallow steps follow with their landings ; then come successively
a hypostyle hall, and, at the extreme end, a vaulted chamber, all of which are
decorated with mysterious scenes and covered with inscriptions. This is, how
ever, but the first storey, containing the antechambers of the dead, but not their
living-rooms. A passage and steps, concealed under a slab to the left of the
hall, lead to the real vault, which held the mummy and its funerary furniture.
As we penetrate further and further by the light of torches into this sub
terranean abode, we see that the walls are covered with pictures and
formulm, setting forth the voyages of the soul through the twelve hours of the
night, its trials, its judgment, its reception by the departed, and its apotheosis
all depicted on the rock with the same perfection as that which characterises the
bas-reliefs on the finest slabs of Turah stone at Qurnah and Abydos. A gallery
leading out of the last of these chambers extends a few feet further and then
stops abruptly ; the engineers had contemplated the excavation of a third storey
to the tomb, when the death of their master obliged them to suspend their
task.^ The king’s sarcophagus consists of a block of alabaster, hollowed out,
polished, and carved with figures and hieroglyphs, wdth all the minuteness
which we associate with the cutting of a gem."* It contained a wooden coffin,

however, soon after his return, and his right to the crown devolved on his younger
brother, who, like his grandfather, bore the name of Eamses. This prince was
still very young,^ but Seti did not on that account delay enthroning with great
pomp this son who had a better right to the throne than himself. “ From the
time that I was in the egg,” Eamses writes later on, “ the great ones sniffed the
earth before me ; when I attained to the rank of eldest son and heir upon the
throne of Sibu, I dealt with affairs, I commanded as chief the foot-soldiers and
the chariots. My father having appeared before the people, when I was but a
very little boy in his arms, said to me : ‘ I shall have him crowned king, that I
may see him in all his splendour while I am still on this earth ! ’ The nobles
of the court having drawn near to place the pschent upon my head : ‘ Place the
diadem upon his forehead ! ’ said he.” ^ As Eamses increased in years, Seti
delighted to confer upon him, one after the other, the principal attributes of
power ; “ while he was still upon this earth, regulating everything in the land,
defending its frontiers, and watching over the welfare of its inhabitants, he
cried : ‘ Let him reign ! ’ because of tlie love he had for me.” Seti also chose for
him wives, beautiful “ as are those of his palace,” ^ and he gave him in marriage
his sisters Nofritari II. Mimut and Isitnofiit,^ who, like Eamses himself, had
claims to the throne. Eamses was allowed to attend the State councils at the
age of ten ; he commanded armies, and he administered justice under the direction
of his father and his vizieiu® Seti, however, although making use of his son’s
youth and activity, did not in any sense retire in his favour ; if he permitted
Eamses to adopt the insignia of royalty —the cartouches, the pschent, the
bulbous-shaped helmet, and the various sceptres—he still remained to the day
of his death the principal State official, and be reckoned all the years of this
dual sovereignty as those of his sole reign.® Eamses repulsed the incursions of

388 THE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
completing the decoration of the principal chambers of the resting-place built
by his father, and chose a site some 320 feet to the north-west of it for a similar
Memnonium for himself. He granted cultivated fields and meadows in the
Thinite nome for the maintenance of these two mausolea, founded a college of
priests and soothsayers in connexion with them, for which he provided endow
ments, and also assigned them considerable fiefs in all parts of the valley of
theNile.^ The Delta next occupied his attention. The increasing importance
of the Syrian provinces in the eyes of Egypt, the growth of the Hittite mon
archy, and the migrations of the peoples of the Mediterranean, had obliged
the last princes of the preceding dynasty to reside more frequently at Memphis
than Amenothes I. or Thutmosis III. had done. Amenothes III. had set to work
to restore certain cities which had been abandoned since the days of the Shep
herds, and Bubastis, Athribis, and perhaps Tanis, had, thanks to his efforts,
revived from their decayed condition.^ The Pharaohs, indeed, felt that at
Thebes they were too far removed from the battle-fields of Asia ; distance made
it difficult for them to counteract the intrigues in which their vassals in Kharu
and the lords of Naharaim were perpetually implicated, and a revolt which
might have been easily anticipated or crushed had they been advised of it
within a few days, gained time to increase and extend during the interval
occupied by the couriers in travelling to and from the capital. Ramses felt the
importance of possessing a town close to the Isthmus where he could reside in
security, and he therefore built close to Zalu, in a fertile and healthy locality, a
stronghold to which he gave his own name,*^ and of which the poets of the time
have left us an enthusiastic description. “ It extends,” they say, “ between Zahi
and Egypt—and is filled with provisions and victuals. — It resembles Hermon
this,—it is strong like Memphis,—and the sun rises—and sets in it-—so that men
quit their villages and establish themselves in its territory.”^—“The dwellers on

post, from whence the king could keep watch against all intriguing adversaries,
whether on the banks of the Orontes or the coast of the Mediterranean.
Nothing appeared for the moment to threaten the peace of the empire.
The Asiatic vassals had raised no disturbance on hearing of the king’s accession,
and Mautallu continued to observe the conditions of the treaty which he had
signed with Seti. Two military expeditions undertaken beyond the isthmus in
the IP*’ and IV^’’ years of the new sovereign were accomplished almost without
fighting. He repressed by the way the marauding Shausu, and on reaching the
N ahr el-Kelb, which then formed the northern frontier of his empire, he inscribed
at the turn of the road, on the rocks which overhang the mouth of the river,
two triumphal stelae in which he related his successes.^ Towards the end of
his IV**' year a rebellion broke out among the Khati, which caused a rupture
of relations between the two kingdoms and led to some irregular fighting.
Khatusaru, a younger brother of Maurusaru, murdered the latter and made him
self king in his stead.^ It is not certain whether the Egyptians took up arms
against him, or w'hether he judged it wise to oppose them in order to divert the
attention of his subjects from his crime. At all events, he convoked his Syrian
vassals and collected his mercenaries ; the whole of Naharaim, Khalupu,
Carchemish, and Arvad sent their quota, while bands of Dardanians, Mysians,
Trojans, and Lycians, together with the people of Pedasos and Girgasha,*
furnished further contingents, drawn from an area extending from the most dis
tant coasts of the Mediterranean to the mountains of Cilicia. Ramses, informed

W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 355). If we may identify the nation, not with the Oilicians, as W. Max Muller wishes to do {ibid., pp. 352-355), but with the Kashki or Kashku of the Assyrian texts, the ancestors of the people of Colchis of classical times, the termination -isha of the Egyptian word would be the inflexion -ash or -ush of the Eastern-Asiatie tongues which we find in so many race-names, e.g. Adaush, Saradaush, Ammaush.

of the enemy’s movement by his generals and the governors of places on the
frontier, resolved to anticipate the attack. He assembled an army almost as in
congruous in its component elements as that of his adversary ; besides Egyptians
of unmixed race, divided into four corps bearing the names of Amon, Phtah,
Harmakhis and Sutkhu, it contained Ethiopian auxiliaries, Libyans, Mazaiu,
and Shardana.^ When preparations were completed, the force crossed the
canal at Zalu, on the 9th of Payni in his V*^’* year, marched rapidly across
Canaan till they reached the valley of the Litany, along which they took
their way, and then followed up that of the Orontes.^ They encamped for a few
days at Shabtuna, to the south-west of Qodshu,^ in the midst of the Amorite
country, sending out scouts and endeavouring to discover the position of the
enemy, of whose movements they possessed but vague information. Khatusaru
lay concealed in the wooded valleys of the Lebanon ; he was kept well posted
by his spies, and only waited an opportunity to take the field ; as an occasion
did not immediately present itself, he had recourse to a ruse with which the
generals of the time were familiar. Ramses, at length uneasy at not falling in
with the enemy, advanced to the south of Shabtuna, where he endeavoured to
obtain information from two Bedawin. “ Our brethren,” said they, “ who are
' In the account of the campaign the Shardana only are mentioned ; but we learn from a list in the Anastati Papyrus I., pi. xvii. 1. 2, that the army of Kamses II. included, in ordinary circumstances, in addition to the Shardana, a contingent of Mashauasha, Kahaka, and other Libyan and negro mercenaries (Chabas, Voyage d’un Egyptien, pp. 51-72). ® The history of these events has been preserved to us in two documents of widely different character : 1st, that which E. de Kouge' described as the Bulletin de la Campagne (or Despatch) (Kobiou, Sesostris d’apres les nouveaux documents, in the Revue Contemporaine, 2nd series, 1868, vol. Ixv. pp. 483-488) ; 2nd, the poem of Pentauirit on the battle of Qodshu. Here I follow the Bulletin and the pictures which accompany it. Texts of it are still in existence at Abu Simbel (Champollion, Monuments, pis. xxvii.-ix., and vol. i. pp. 64, 65 ; Eosellini, Monumenti Storici, pis. c.-cii. ; Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 187), at Luxor (Brugsch, Recueil de Monuments, vol. ii. pi. lii. 1), at the Eamesseum (Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 153 ; Sharpe, Egyptian Inscriptions, 2nd series, pi. 52) ; it has been critically examined by Charles and Fran9ois Lenormant {Les Livres chez les Egyptiens, pp. 28-38), translated by Chabas {Traduction et Analyse de Vinscription hid'roglypMque d’lbsamboul, in the Revue ArchAologique, 1859, vol.

The pictures and their inscriptions have also been collected; those at Abu Simbel by Champollion {Monuments, pis. x.-xxxvii.) and by Eosellini {Monumenti Storici, pis. Ixxxvii.-ciii.) ; those in the Eamesseum by Champollion (pis. cccxxii.-cccxxxi.), Eosellini (pis. cviii.-cx.), and Lepsius {Denkm., iii. 153-155, 157-161, 164-166) ; those at Luxor by Eosellini (pis. civ.-cvii.) ; those at Karnak by Champollion {Monuments, vol. ii. pp. 119-125). The whole has been studied by E. de Eouge (Kobiou, Sdsostris d’apres les nouveaux documents, in the Revue Contemporaine, 2nd series, 1868, vol. Ixv. pp. 482-493), by Brugsch {Geschichte yEgyptens, pp. 493-500), by Pleyte {De Veldslag van Ramses tegen de Cheta, Leyden, 1878), by Tomkins {On the Campaign of Ramses the Second in his year against Kadesh on the Orontes, in the Transactions of the Soc.

information to your Majesty : We desire to serve the Pharaoh. We are deserting
the vile Prince of the Khati ; he is close to Khalupu (Aleppo), to the north of the
city of Tunipa, whither he has rapidly retired from fear of the Pharaoh.” ^ This
story had every appearance of probability ; and the distance—Khalupu was at
least forty leagues away—explained why the reconnoitring parties of the

Egyptians had not fallen in with any of the enemy. The Pharaoh, with this
information, could not decide whether to lay siege to Qodshu and wait until the
Hittites were forced to succour the town, or to push on towards the Euphrates
and there seek the engagement which his adversary seemed anxious to avoid.
He chose the latter of the two alternatives. He sent forward the legions of
Amon, Phra, Phtah, and Sutkhu, which constituted the main body of his troops,
and prepared to follow them with his household chariotry. At the verv
moment when this division was being effected, the Hittites, who had been
represented by the spies as being far distant, were secretly massing their
forces to the north-east of Qodshu, ready to make an attack upon the Pharaoh’s
flank as soon as he should set out on his march towards Khalupu. The enemy

had considerable forces at their disposal, and on the day of the engagement
they placed 18,000 to 20,000 picked soldiers in the fieldd Besides a well
disciplined infantry, they possessed 2500 to 3000 chariots, containing, as was
the Asiastic custom, three men in eacli.^

seated on his throne delivering his final commands, ordered them to be beaten
till the truth should be extracted from them. They at last confessed that
they had been despatched to watch the departure of the Egyptians, and
admitted that the enemy was concealed in ambush behind the town. Kamses
hastily called a council of war and laid the situation before his generals, not
without severely reprimanding them for the bad organisation of the intelligence
department. The officers excused themselves as best they could, and threw
the blame on the provincial governors, who had not been able to discover what
was going on. The king cut short these useless recriminations, sent swift

gave orders that all those remaining in camp should hold themselves in
readiness to attack. The council were still deliberating when news was
brought that the Hittites were in sight. Their first onslaught was so violent
that they threw down one side of the camp wall, and penetrated into the
enclosure. Kamses charged them at the head of his household troops.
Eight times he engaged the chariotry which threatened to surround him, and
each time he broke their ranks. Once he found himself alone with Manna, his
shield-bearer, in the midst of a knot of warriors who were bent on his destruc

accompanied him on his expeditions did terrible work by his side, and felled
many an Asiatic with his teeth and claws.^ The soldiers, fired by the king’s

example, stood their ground resolutely during the long hours of the afternoon;
at length, as night was drawing on, the legions of Phra and Sutkhu, who had
hastily retraced their steps, arrived on the scene of action. A large body of
Khati, who were hemmed in in that part of the camp which they had taken in
the morning, were at once killed or made prisoners, not a man of them escaping.
Khatusaru, disconcerted by
this sudden reinforcement of
the enemy, beat a retreat,
and nightfall suspended the
struggle. It was recom
menced at dawn the fol
lowing morning with un
abated fury, and terminated
in the rout of the con
federates. Garbatusa, the
shield-bearer of the Hittite
prince, the generals in com
mand of his infantry and
chariotry, and Khalupsaru,
the “ writer of books,” fell
during the action. The
chariots, driven back to the
Orontes, rushed into the
river in the hope of fording
it, but in so doing many
lives were lost. Mazraima,
the Prince of Khati’s brother,
reached the opposite bank in safety, but the Chief of Tonisa was drowned, and
the lord of Khalupu was dragged out of the water more dead than alive, and
had to be held head downwards to disgorge the water he had swallowed before
he could be restored to consciousness. Khatusaru himself was on the point of
perishing, when the troops which had been shut up in Qodshu, together with
the inhabitants, made a general sortie ; the Egyptians were for a moment held
in check, and the fugitives meanwhile were able to enter the town. Either
there was insufficient provision for so many mouths, or the enemy had lost all
heart from the disaster ; at any rate, further resistance appeared useless. The
next morning Khatusaru sent to propose a truce or peace to the victorious
Pharaoh. The Egyptians had probably suffered at least as much as their

distaste ; Eamses, therefore, accepted the offers made to him and prepared to
return to Egypt. The fame of his exploits had gone before him, and he himself
was not a little proud of the energy he had displayed on the day of battle.
His predecessors had always shown themselves to be skilful generals and brave
soldiers,,but none of them had ever before borne, or all but borne, single-handed
the brunt of an attack. Eamses loaded his shield-bearer Manna with rewards

free vent to his enthusiasm until the moment when he describes his hero, left
almost alone, charging the enemy in the sight of his followers. The Pharaoh
Avas surrounded by two thousand five hundred chariots, and his retreat was cut
off by the warriors of the “ perverse ” Khati and of the other nations who
accompanied them —the peoples of Arvad, Mysia, and Pedasos ; each of their
chariots contained three men, and the ranks were so serried that they formed
but one dense mass. “No other prince was with me, no general officers,
no one in command of the archers or chariots. My foot-soldiers deserted me,
my charioteers fled before the foe, and not one of them stood firm beside me
to fight against them.” Then said His Majesty; “Who art thou, then, my
father Araon ? A father who forgets his son ? Or have I committed aught
against thee ? Have I not marched and halted according to thy command ?
When he does not violate thy orders, the lord of Egypt is indeed great, and
he overthrows the barbarians in his path ! What are these Asiatics to thy
heart ? Anion will humiliate those who know not the god. Have I not
consecrated innumerable offerings to thee ? Filling thy holy dwelling-place
with my prisoners, I build thee a temple for millions of years, I lavish all my

' The author is unknown ; Pentahr, or rather Pentauirit, to whom E. de Eouge attributed the poem (Le Poeme de Pen-ta-our, pp. 6, 7, 30), is merely the transcriber of the copy we possess on papyrus (Erjian, Neudgyptische Grammatik, pp. 6, 7). The poem of Qodshh was discovered at Aix in Provence by Cliampollion {Lettres Sorites d’Egypte, 2nd edit.,p. 21), who at once made a precis of the contents, and it was edited later on by Salvolini (^Campagne de Ramses-Je-Grand contre les Sclidla, Paris, 1835); the manuscript, acquired by tlie Brit. Museum, was published in facsimile in Select Papyri, vol. i. pis. xxiv.-xxxiv., with a notice by Birch {ibid., text, pp. 3, 4). The poem was translated, just as it was found in the papyrus, by E. de Rouge {Le Poeme de Pen-ta-our, 185G), and it is from this masterly work that the analyses and translations of Goodwin (Ora the Hieratic Papyri, in the Cambridge Essays, 1858, pp. 239-243), of Brugsch {Hist. d’Egypte, pp. 140-145, and Gescli. jEgyptens, pp. 501-513), and of Lushington {The Third Saltier Papyrus, the War of Eameses II. with the Khita, of Pentaur, in the
Records of the Past, 1st series, vol. ii. pjj. 65-78) are deriyed. A new fragment discovered at M. Raifet’s, and given by him to the Louvre, enabled E. de Rouge to correct his first translation {Le Poeme de Pentaour, nouvelle traduction, in the Rec. de Travaux, vol. i. pp. 1-9) while preparing a critical edition of the text, in which were inserted the fragments found at Karnak (Champollion, Monuments de VEgypte et de la Nubie, vol. ii. p. 124 ; Brugsch, Recueil de Monuments, vol. ii. pis. xxix.-xxxii. ; Mariette, Karnak, pis. 48-51 ; E. and J. de Bodge, Inscriptions hidroglyphiques, pis. ccvi.-ccxxxi.), at Luxor (Brugsch, Recueil de Monuments, vol. i. pis. xl.-xlii. ; E. and J. de Rouge, Inscriptions recueillies era Egypte, pis. ccxxxii.-ccxlviii.), and in the temple at Abydos (Mariette, Abydos, vol. ii. pis. 4, 5). The two principal versions of the poem have been fully treated of by E. de Rouge', in his Lectures at the College de Prance from 1868 to 1870; a part of this work has appeared, thanks to the labours of J. de Rouge' {Le Poeme de Pentaour, in the Revue Egyptologique, vol. iii. pp. 149-161 ; vol. iv. pp. 89-94, 124-131 ; vol. v. pp. 15-23, 157-164; vol. vi. pp. 36-42, 81-89, 105-112; vol. vii. pp. 21-28).

loving heart. I invoke thee, 0 my father Amon ! Here am I in the midst
of people so numerous that it cannot he known who are the nations joined
together against me, and I am alone among them, none other is with me. My
many soldiers have forsaken me, none of my charioteers looked towards me
when I called them, not one of them heard my voice when I cried to them.
But I find that Amon is more to me than a million soldiers, than a hundred
thousand charioteers, than a myriad of brothers or young sons, joined all
together, for the number of men is as nothing, Amon is greater than all of
them. Each time I have accomplished these things, Amon, by the counsel of
thy mouth, as I do not transgress thy orders, I rendered thee glory even to the
ends of the earth.” ^ So calm an invocation in the thick of the battle would
appear misplaced in the mouth of an ordinary man, but Pharaoh was a god,
and the son of a god, and his actions and speeches cannot be measured by the
same standard as that of a common mortal. He was possessed by the religious
spirit in the hour of danger, and while his body continued to fight, his soul
took wing to the throne of Amon. He contemplates the lord of heaven face to
face, reminds him of the benefits which he had received from him, and sum
mons him to his aid with an imperiousness which betrays the sense of his own
divine origin. The expected help was not delayed. “ While the voice resounds
in Hermonthis, Amon arises at my behest, he stretches out his hand to me, and
I cry out with joy when he hails me from behind : ‘ Face to face with thee,
face to face with thee, Eamses Miamuu, 1 am with thee ! It is I, thy father I
My hand is with thee, and I am worth more to thee than hundreds of thousands.
I am the strong one who loves valour ; I have beheld in thee a courageous heart,
and my heart is satisfied ; my will is about to be accomplished !
’ 1 am like
Montu ; from the right I shoot with the dart, from the left I seize the enemy.
I am like Baal in his hour, before them ; I have encountered two thousand five
hundred chariots, and as soon as I am in their midst, they are overthrown
before my mares. Not one of all these people has found a hand wherewith to
fight ; their hearts sink within their breasts, fear paralyses their limbs ; they
know not how to throw their darts, they have no strength to hold their lances.
I precipitate them into the water like as the crocodile plunges therein ; they
are prostrate face to the earth, one upon the other, and I slay in the
midst of them, for I have willed that not one should look behind him, nor
that one should return ; he who falls rises not again.” ^ This sudden
descent of the god has, even at the present day, an effect upon the reader,

prepared though he is by his education to consider it as a literary artihce ; but
on the Egyptian, brought up to regard Amon with boundless reverence, its
influence was irresistible. The Prince of the Khati, repulsed at the very
moment when he was certain of victory, “ recoiled Avith terror. He sends
against the enemy the various chiefs, followed by their chariots and skilled
warriors,—the chiefs of Arvad, Lycia, and Ilion, the leaders of the Lycians
and Dardanians, the lords of Carchemish, of the Girgashites, and of
Khalupu ; these allies of the Khati, all together, comprised three thousand
chariots.” Their efforts, however, were in vain. “ I fell upon them like Month,
my hand devoured them in the space of a moment, in the midst of them I
hewed down and slew. They said one to another : This is no man who is
amongst us ; it is Sutkhu the great warrior, it is Baal incarnate ! These are
not human actions which he accomplishes : alone, by himself, he repulses
hundreds of thousands, without leaders or men. Up, let us flee before him, let
us seek to save our lives, and let us breathe again ! ” When at last, towards
evening, the army again rallies round the king, and finds the enemy completely
defeated, the men hang their heads with mingled shame and admiration as the
Pharaoh reproaches them : “ What will the whole earth say when it is known
that you left me alone, and Avithout any to succour me ? that not a prince,
not a cliarioteer, not a captain of archers, was found to place his hand in
mine ? I fought, I repulsed millions of people by myself alone. ‘ Victory-in
Thebes ’ and ‘ Nurit satisfied ’ Avere my glorious horses ; it was they that I found
under my hand Avhen I was alone in the midst of the quaking foe. I myself
Avill cause them to take their food before me, each day, when I shall be in my
palace, for I was with them when I was in the midst of the enemy, along with
the Prince Manna my shield-bearer, and with the officers of my house who
accompanied me, and who are my witnesses for the combat; these are those
Avhom I was with. I have returned after a victorious struggle, and I have
smitten with my sword the assembled multitudes.”^
The ordeal was a terrible one for the Khati ; but when the first moment
of defeat was over, they again took courage and resumed the campaign. This
single effort had not exhausted their resources, and they rapidly filled up the
gaps Avhich had been made in their ranks. The plains of Naharaim and the
mountains of Cilicia supplied them with fresh chariots and foot-soldiers in
the place of those they had lost, and bands of mercenaries were furnished from
the table-lands of Asia Minor, so that Avhen Kamses II. reappeared in Syria,
he found himself confronted by a completely fresh army. Khatusaru, having
profited by experience, did not again attempt a general engagement, but

contented himself with disputing step by step the upper valleys of the
Litany and Orontes. Meantime his emissaries spread themselves over Phoe
nicia and Kharu, sowing the seeds of rebellion, often only too successfully. In
the king’s VIIP^ year there was a general rising in Galilee, and its towns
Galaput in the hill-country of Bit-Aniti, Merom, Shalaraa, Dapur, and
Anauudm^ —had to be reduced one after another. Dapur was the hardest to
carry. It crowned the top of a rocky eminence, and was protected by a double
wall, which followed the irregularities of the hillside. It formed a rallying
point for a large force, which had to be overcome in the open country before the
investment of the town could be attempted. The siege was at last brought to
a conclusion, after a series of skirmishes, and the town taken by scaling, four
Egyptian princes having been employed in conducting the attack. In the
Pharaoh’s IX“' year a revolt broke out on the Egyptian frontier, in the Shephelah,
and the king placed himself at the head of his troops to crush it. Ascalon, in
which the peasantry and their families had found, as they hoped, a safe refuge,
opened its gates to the Pharaoh, and its fall brought about the submission of
several neighbouring places.^ This, it appears, was the first time since the
beginning of the conquests in Syria that the inhabitants of these regions
attempted to take up arms, and we may well ask what could have induced
them thus to renounce their ancient loyalty. Their defection reduced Egypt
for the moment almost to her natural frontiers. Peace had scarcely been
resumed when war again broke out with fresh violence in Coele-Syria, and one
year it reached even to Naharaim, and raged around Tunipa as in the
days of Thutmosis III. “ Pharaoh assembled his foot-soldiers and chariots,
and he commanded his foot-soldiers and his chariots to attack the perverse
Khati who were in the neighbourhood of Tunipa, and he put on his armour
and mounted his chariot, and he waged battle against the town of the perverse
Khati at the head of his foot-soldiers and his chariots, covered with his
armour ;

carried his arms still further afield, and with such results, that, to judge merely
fi’om the triumphal lists engraved on the walls of the temple of Karnak, the
inhabitants on the hanks of the Euphrates, those in Carchemish, Mitanni,
Singar, Assyria, and Mannus found themselves once more at the mercy of the
Egyptian battalions^ These victories, however brilliant, were not decisive
if after any one of them the princes of Assyria and Singar may have sent
presents to the Pharaoh, the Hittites, on the other hand, did not consider them
selves beaten, and it was only after fifteen campaigns that they were at length
sufficiently subdued to propose a treaty. At last, in the Egyptian king’s XXP*^
year, on the 21sfc of the month Tybi, when the Pharaoh, then residing in his
good town of Anakhitu, was returning from the temple where he had been
offering prayers to his father Amon-Ra, to Harmakhis of Heliopolis, to Phtah,
and to Sutkhu the valiant son of Nuit, Ramses, one of the “messengers” who
filled the office of lieutenant for the king in Asia, arrived at the palace and
presented to him Tartisubu, who was authorised to make peace with Egypt in
the name of Kliatusaru.^ Tartisubu carried in his hand a tablet of silver, on
which his master had prescribed the conditions which appeared to him just
and equitable. A short preamble recalling the alliances made between the
ancestors of both parties, was followed by a declaration of friendship, and a
reciprocal obligation to avoid in future all grounds of hostility. Not only was
a perpetual truce declared between both peoples, but they agreed to help
each other at the first demand. “ Should some enemy march against the
countries subject to the great King of Egypt, and should he send to the
great Prince of the Khali, saying ; ‘ Come, bring me forces against them,’
the great Prince of the Khati shall do as he is asked by the great King of
Egypt, and the great Prince of the Khati shall destroy his enemies. And if
the great Prince of the KhMi shall prefer not to come himself, he shall send
his archers and his chariots to the great King of Egypt to destroy his enemies.” ®

brother,” while two articles couched iu identical terms made provision against
the possibility of any town or tribe dependent on either of the two sovereigns
withdrawing its allegiance and placing it in the hands of the other party. In
this case the Egyptians as well as the Hittites engaged not to receive, or at
least not to accept, such offers, but to refer them at once to the legitimate
lord. The whole treaty was placed under the guarantee of the gods both of
Egypt and of the Khati, whose names were given at length : “ Whoever shall
fail to observe the stipulations, let the thousand gods of Kliati and the thousand
gods of Egypt strike his house, his laud, and his servants. But he who shall
observe the stipulations engraved on the tablet of silver, whether he belong
to the Hittite people or whether he belong to the people of Egypt, as he
has not neglected them, may the thousand gods of Khati and the thousand
gods of Egypt give him health, and grant that he may prosper, himself, the
people of his house, and also his land and his servants.” ^ The treaty itself
ends by a description of the plaque of silver on which it was engraved. It was,
in fact, a facsimile in metal of one of those clay tablets on which the Chaldaeans
inscribed their contracts. The preliminary articles occupied the upper part in
closely written lines of cuneiform characters, while in the middle, in a space
left free for the purpose, was the impress of two seals, that of the Prince of
the Khati and of his wife Puukhipa. Khatusaru was represented on them as
standing upright in the arms of Sutkhu, while around the two figures ran the
inscription, “ Seal of Sutkhu, the sovereign of heaven.” Puukhipa leaned on
the breast of a god, the patron of her native town of Aranna in Qazauadana,
and the legend stated that this was the seal of the Sun of the town of Aranna,
the regent of the earth.'^ The text of the treaty was continued beneath,
and probably extended to the other side of the tablet.® The original draft
had terminated after the description of the seals, but, to satisfy the Pharaoh,
certain additional articles were appended for the protection of the commerce
and industry of the two countries, for the prevention of the emigration of
artisans, and for ensuring that steps taken against them should be more effec
tual and less cruel. Any criminal attempting to evade the laws of his country,
and taking refuge in that of the other party to the agreement, was to be
expelled without delay and consigned to the officers of his lord; any fugitive

THE BALANCE OF POWER IN STRIA. 403
not a criminal, any subject carried off or detained by force, any able artisan
quitting either territory to take up permanent residence in the other, was
to be conducted to the frontier, but his act of folly was not to expose
him to judicial condemnation. “ He who shall thus act, his fault shall not
be brought up against him; his house shall not be touched, nor his wife, nor
his children; he shall not have his throat cut, nor shall his eyes be touched,
nor his mouth, nor his feet; no criminal accusation shall be made against
him.”i
This treaty is the most ancient of all those of which the text has come down
to us ; its principal conditions were—perfect equality and reciprocity between
the contracting sovereigns, an offensive and defensive alliance, and the extradi
tion of criminals and refugees. The original was drawn up in Chaldaean script by
the scribes of Khatusaru, probably on the model of former conventions between
the Pharaohs and the Asiatic courts,^ and to this the Egyptian ministers had
added a few clauses relative to the pardon of emigrants delivered up by one or
other of the contracting parties. When, therefore, Tartisubu arrived in the
city of Eamses, the acceptance of the treaty was merely a matter of form,
and peace was virtually concluded. It did not confer on the conqueror the
advantages which we might have expected from his successful campaigns
it enjoined, on the contrary, the definite renunciation of those countries,
Mitanni, Naharaim, Alasia, and Amurru, over which Thutmosis HI. and his
immediate successors had formerly exercised an effective sovereignty. Sixteen
years of victories had left matters in the same state as they were after the
expedition of Harmhabi, and, like his predecessor, Ramses was able to retain
merely those Asiatic provinces which were within the immediate influence of
Egypt, such as the Phoenician coast proper, Kharu, Persea beyond Jordan, the
oases of the Arabian desert, and the peninsula of Sinai.^ This apparently unsatis
factory result, after such supreme efforts, was, however, upon closer examination,
not so disappointing. For more than half a century at least, since the Hittite
kingdom had been developed and established under the impulse given to it by
Sapalulu, everything had been in its favour. The campaign of Seti had opposed

Egyptian rule on the other side of the Jordan seems to be proved by the monument discovered a few years ago in the Hauran, and known under the name of the “ Stone of Job” by the Bedawin of the neighbourhood {Zeitschrift des Palastina Vereins, vol. xiv. p. 142, et seq. ; cf. Ebman, Der Riohstein, ibid., vol. xiv. pp. 210, 211).



404 THE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
merely a passing obstacle to its expansion, and had not succeeded in discouraging
its ambitions, for its rulers still nursed the hope of being able one day to conquer
Syria as far as the isthmus. The check received at Qodshu, the abortive
attempts to foment rebellion in Gralilee and the Shephelah, the obstinate per
sistence with which Kamses and his army returned year after year to the attack,
the presence of the enemy at Tuuipa, on the banks of the Euphrates, and in the
provinces then forming the very centre of the Hittite kingdom —in short, all the
incidents of this long struggle — at length convinced Khatusaru that he was
powerless to extend his rule in this direction at the expense of Egypt. More
over, we have no knowledge of the events which occupied him on the other
frontiers of his kingdom, where he may have been engaged at the same time in
a conflict with Assyria, or in repelling an incursion of the tribes on the Black
Sea. The treaty with Pharaoh, if made in good faith and likely to be last
ing, would protect the southern extremities of his kingdom, and allow of his
removing the main body of his forces to the north and east in case of attack
from either of these quarters. The security which such an alliance would ensure
made it, therefore, worth his while to sue for peace, even if the Egyptians
should construe his overtures as an acknowledgment of exhausted supplies
or of inferiority of strength. Eamses doubtless took it as such, and openly
displayed on the walls at Karnak and in the Kamesseum a copy of the treaty
so flattering to his pride, but the indomitable resistance which he had
encountered had doubtless given rise to reflections resembling those of
Khatusaru, and he had come to realise that it was his own interest not to
lightly forego the good will of the Khati. Egypt had neighbours in Africa
who were troublesome though not dangerous : the Timihu, the Tihonu, the
Mashuasha, the negroes of Kush and of Puanit, might be a eontinual source
of annoyance and disturbance, even though they were incapable of disturbing
her supremacy. The coast of the Delta, it is true, was exposed to the piracy
of northern nations, but up to that time this had been merely a local
trouble, easy to meet if not to obviate altogether. The only real danger
was on the Asiatic side, arising from empires of ancient constitution like
Chaldeea, or from hordes who, arriving at irregular intervals from the north,,
and carrying all before them, threatened, after the example of the Hyksos, to
enter the Delta. The Hittite kingdom acted as a kind of buffer between the
Nile valley and these nations, both civilized and barbarous; it was a strongly
armed force on the route of the invaders, and would henceforth serve as a pro
tecting barrier, through which if the enemy were able to pass it would only be
with his strength broken or weakened by a previous encounter. The sovereigns
loyally observed the peace which they had sworn to each other, and in his
XXXIV“^ year the marriage of Eamses with the eldest daughter of Khatusaru,



TEE MARRIAGE OF RAMSES 11. WITH A EITTITE PRINCESS. 405
-strengthened their friendly relations. Pharaoh was not a little proud of
this union, and he has left us a naive record of the manner in which it came
about. The inscription is engraved on the face of the rock at Abu Simbel
in Nubia; and Eamses begins by boasting, in a heroic strain, of his own energy
and exploits, of the fear with which his victories inspired the whole world,
and of the anxiety of the Syrian kinglets to fulfil his least wishes. The
Prince of the Khati had sent him sumptuous presents at every opportunity,
and, not knowing how further to make himself agreeable to the Pharaoh,
had finally addressed
the great lords of his
uourt, and reminded
them how their country
had formerly been ruined
by war, how their master
Sutkhu had taken part
against them, and how
they had been delivered
from their ills by tlie
clemency of tlie Sun of Egypt. “ Let us therefore take our goods, and
placing my eldest daughter at the head of them, let us repair to the domains
of the great god, so that the King Sesostris may recognise us.” He accord
ingly did as he had proposed, and the embassy set out with gold and silver,
valuable horses, and an escort of soldiers, together with cattle and provisions
to supply them with i'ood by the way. When they reached the borders of
Kharu, the governor wrote immediately to the Pharaoh as follows : “ Here is the
Prince of the Khati, who brings his eldest daughter with a number of presents
of every kind ; and now this princess and the chief of the country of the Khati,
after having crossed many mountains and undertaken a difficult journey from
distant parts, have arrived at the frontiers of His Majesty. May we be
instructed how we ought to act with regard to them.” The king was then in
residence at Eamses. When the news reached him, he officially expressed his
great joy at the event, since it was a thing unheard of in the annals of the
country that so powerful a prince should go to such personal inconvenience in
order to marry his daughter to an ally. The Pharaoh, therefore, despatched his
nobles and an army to receive them, but he was careful to conceal the anxiety
which he felt all the while, and, according to custom, took counsel of his patron
god Sutkhu : “ Who are these people who come with a message at this time

to the country of Zahi ? ” The oracle, however, reassured him as to their
intentions, and he thereupon hastened to prepare for their proper reception.
The embassy made a triumphal entry into the city, the princess at its head,
escorted by the Egyptian troops told off for the purpose, together with the
foot-soldiers and charioteers of the Khati, comprising the flower of their
army and militia. A solemn festival was held in their honour, in which
food and drink were served without stint, and was concluded by the celebration
of the marriage in the presence of the Egyptian lords and of the princes of the
whole earth Ramses, unwilling to relegate a princess of such noble birth to
the companionship of his ordinary concubines, granted her the title of queen,
as if she were of solar blood, and with the cartouche gave her the new name
of Uirimaunofiruri—“ She who sees the beauties of the Sun.” She figures
henceforth in the ceremonies and on the monuments in the place usually
occupied by women of Egyptian race only, and these unusual honours may
have compensated, in the eyes of the young princess, for the disproportion in
age between herself and a veteran more than sixty years old.^ The friendly
relations between the two courts became so intimate that the Pharaoh
invited his father-in-law to visit him in his own country. “ The great Prince
of Khati informed the Prince of Qodi : ‘ Prepare thyself that we may go down
into Egypt. The word of the king has gone forth, let us obey Sesostris. He
gives the breath of life to those who love him; hence all the earth loves him,
and Khati forms but one with him.’ ” They were received with pomp at
Ramses-Auakhitu, and perhaps at Thebes. It was with a mixture of joy and
astonishment tliat Egypt beheld her bitterest foe become her most faithful
ally, “ and the men of Qimit having but one heart with the chiefs of the Khati,
a thing which had not happened since the ages of Ra.” ^
* The fact of the marriage is known to us by the decree of Phtah-Totunen at Abu Simbel in the XXXV“‘ year of the king’s reign (1. 2.5 ; cf. Naville, Le D^cret de Ftah-Totunen, in the Transactions of the Soc. of Bibl. Archseology, vol. vii. p. 12G). The account of it in the text is taken from the stele at Abu Simbel, imperfectly published in the Denlcm., iii. 191) a. The last lines, which had escaped the notice of Lepsius, were copied hy Bouriaut {Notes de Voyage, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xviii. pp. IGd-lGG) ; they are so mutilated that I have been obliged to paraphrase them. The stele of the Princess of Bakhtan has preserved the romantic version of this marriage, such as was current about the Saite period. The King of the Khati must have taken advantage of the expedition whicli the Pliaraoh made into Asia to send him presents by an embassy, at the head of wliich he placed' his eldest daughter : the ijrincess found favour with Kamses, who married her (11. d-G; cf. E. de Rouge, Etude sur une stele e'gyptienne appartenant a la Bibliotheque Impd^riale, pp. 35-54). ^ This princess is mentioned on the monuments at Tanis (Makiette, Fragments et Documents relatifs aux fouilles de San, in the Recueil de Travaux,yol. ix. p. 13 ; E. and J. de Rouge, Inscriptions hi^roglyphiques copNes en Egypte, pi.

COMMEBCE WITH SYRIA. 407
The half-century following the conclusion of this alliance was a period of
world-wide prosperity. Syria was once more able to breathe freely, her com
merce being under the combined protection of the two powers who shared
her territory. Not only caravans, but isolated travellers, were able to pass
through the country from north to south without incurring any risks beyond
those occasioned by an untrustworthy guide or a few highwaymen. It became
in time a common task in the schools of Thebes to describe the typical Syrian
tour of some soldier or functionary, and we still possess one of these imaginative

his position by one of those wondrous feats of equilibrium of which the
Orientals were masters. An open rail ran round the sides of the vessel, so as
to prevent goods stowed upon the deck from falling into the sea when the
vessel lurched,^ Voyages to Pfianit were undertaken more frequently in quest
of incense and precious metals. The working of the mines of Akiti had been
the source of considerable outlay at the beginning of the reign. The measures
taken by Seti to render the approaches to them practicable at all seasons had
not produced the desired results ;
^ as far back as the IIP^ year of Ramses the
overseers of the south had been forced to acknowledge that the managers of the
convoys could no longer use any of the cisterns which had been hewn and built
at such great expense. “ Half of them die of thirst, together with their asses,
for they have no means of carrying a sufficient number of skins of water to
last during the journey there and back.” The friends and officers whose
advice had been called in, did not doubt for a moment that the king would be
willing to complete the work which his father had merely initiated. “ If thou
sayest to the water, ‘ Come upon the mountain,’ the heavenly waters will
spring out at the word of thy mouth, for thou art Ea incarnate, Khopri visibly
created, thou art the living image of thy father Tumu, the Heliopolitan.”
“ If thou thyself sayest to thy father the Nile, father of the gods,” added the
Viceroy of Ethiopia, “ ‘ Raise the water up to the mountain,’ he will do all that
thou hast said, for so it has been with all thy projects which have been accom
plished in our presence, of which the like has never been heard, even in the
songs of the poets.” The cisterns and wells were thereupon put into such a
condition that the transport of gold was rendered easy for years to come.^ The
war with the Khati had not suspended building and other works of public
utility ; and now, owing to the establishment of peace, the sovereign was able

placed between two lateral chapels. A hall, nearly square in shape, connected
these mysterious chambers with the propylsea, which were open to the sky
and faced with Osiride caryatides. These appear to keep rigid and solemn
watch over the approaches to the tabernacle, and their faces, half hidden
in the shadow, still present such a stern appearance that the semi-barbaric
Nubians of the neighbouring villages believe them to be possessed by implac
able genii. They are supposed to move from their places during the hours
of night, and the fire which flashes from their eyes destroys or fascinates
whoever is rash enough to watch them.
Other kings before Ramses had constructed buildings in these spots, and
their memory would naturally become associated with his in the future ; he
wished, therefore, to find a site where he would be without a rival, and to this
end he transformed the cliff at Abu Sinibel into a monument of his greatness.
The rocks here project into the Nile and form a gigantic conical promontory,

the face of which was covered with triumphal stelae, on Avhich the sailors or
troops going up or down the river could spell out as they passed the praises
of the king and his exploits^ A few feet of shore on the northern side, covered
with dry and knotty bushes, affords in winter a landing-place for tourists.
At the spot where the
beach ends near the
point of the promon
tory, sit four colossi,
with their feet nearly
touching the water,
their backs leaning
against a sloping wall
of rock, which takes
the likeness of a
pylon. A band of
hieroglyphs runs above
their heads underneath
the usual cornice, over
which again is a row of
crouching cynocephali
looking straight before
them, their hands rest
ing upon their knees,
and above this line of
sacred images rises the
steep and naked rock.
One of the colossi is
broken, and the bust of
the statue, which must
have been detached by
some great shock, has fallen to the ground ; the others rise to the height of 63
feet, and appear to look across the Nile as if w'atching the wadys leading to the
gold-mines. The pschent crown surmounts their foreheads, and the two ends of
the head-dress fall behind their ears; their features are of a noble type, calm
and serious; the nose slightly aquiline, the under lip projecting above a square,
but rather heavy, chin. Of such a type we may picture Ramses, after the
conclusion of the peace with the Khati, in the full vigour of his manhood and

at the height of his power. The doorway of the temple is in the centre of tlie
fa(;ade, and rises nearly to a level with the elbows of the colossi ; above the lintel,
and facing the river, stands a figure of the god Ea, represented with a human
body and the head of a sparrow-hawk, while two images of the king in profile,
one on each side of the god, offer him a figure of Truth. The first hall, 130 feet
long by 58 feet broad, takes the place of the court surrounded by a colonnade
which in other temples
usually follows the
pylon. Here eight Osi
ride figures, standing
against as many square
pillars, appear to support
the weight of the super
incumbent rock. Their
profile catches the light
as it enters through, the
open doorway, and in
the early morning, when
the rising sun casts a
ruddy ray over their
features, their faces be
come marvellously life
like. We are almost
tempted to think that a smile plays over their lips as the first beams touch
them. The remaining chambers consist of a hypostyle hall nearly square in
shape, the sanctuary itself being between two smaller apartments, and of eight
subterranean chambers excavated at a lower level than the rest of the temple.
The whole measures 178 feet from the threshold to the far end of the Holy of
Holies.^ The walls are covered with bas-reliefs in which the Pharaoh has
vividly depicted the wars which he carried on in the four corners of his
kingdom ; here we see raids against the negroes, there the war with the Khati,
and further on an encounter with some Libyan tribe. Eamses, flushed
by the heat of victory, is seen attacking two Timihu chiefs : one has
already fallen to the ground and is being trodden underfoot ; the other, after
vainly letting fly bis arrows, is about to perish from a blow of the conqueror.

His knees give way beneath him, his head falls heavily backwards, and the
features are contracted in his death-agony. Pharaoh with his left hand has
seized him by the arm, while with his right he points his lance against his
enemy’s breast, and is about
to pierce him through the
heart. As a rule, this type >
of bas-relief is executed
with a conventional grace
which leaves the spectator
unmoved, and free to con
sider the scene merely from
its historical point of view,
forgetful of the artist. An
examination of most of the
other wall - decorations of
the speos will furnish
several examples of this
type : we see Ramses with
a suitable gesture brandish
ing his weapon above a
group of prisoners, and the
composition furnishes us
with a fair example of
official sculpture, correct,
conventional, but devoid of
interest. Here, on the con
trary, the drawing is so
full of energy that it carries the imagination back to the time and scene
of those far-off battles. The indistinct light in which it is seen helps the
illusion, and we almost forget that if is a picture we are beholding, and
not the action itself as it took place some three thousand years ago. A small
speos, situated at some hundred feet further north, is decorated with standing
colossi of smaller size, four of which represent Ramses, and two of them
his wife, Isit Nofritari.^ This speos possesses neither peristyle nor crypt,
and the chapels are placed at the two extremities of the transverse passage,
instead of being in a parallel line with the sanctuary ; on the other hand,

Seti had worked iudefatigably at Thebes, but the shortness of his reign
prevented him from completing the buildings he had begun there. There
existed everywhere, at Luxor, at Karnak, and on the left bank of the Nile, the

ink of their future bas-reliefs, and statues hardly blocked out, or awaiting the
final touch of the polisherd Eamses took up the work where his father had
relinquished it. At Luxor there was not enough space to give to the hypostyle
hall the extension which the original plans proposed, and the great colonnade
has an unfinished appearance. The Nile, in one of its capricious floods, had
carried away the land upon which the architects had intended to erect the
side aisles ; and if they wished to add to the existing structure a great
court and a pylon, without which no temple was considered complete, it
was necessary to turn the axis of the building towards the east. In their
operations the architects came upon a beautiful little edifice of rose granite,
which had been either erected or restored by Thutmosis III. at a time when
the town was an independent municipality and was only beginning to extend
its suburban dwellings to meet those of Karnak. They took care to make
no change in this structure, but set to work to incorporate it into their final

plans. It still stands at the north-west corner of the court, and the elegance
of its somewhat slender little columns contrasts happily with the heaviness
of the structure to which it is attached. A portion of its portico is hidden
by the brickwork of the mosque of Abu’i Haggag : the part brought to light
in the course of the excavations contains between each row of columns a colossal
statue of Kamses II. We are accustomed to hear on all sides of the degeneracy
of the sculptor’s art at this time, and of its having fallen into irreparable
neglect. Nothing can be further from the truth than this sweeping statement.
There are doubtless many statues and bas-reliefs of this epoch which shock
us by their crudity and ugliness, but these owed their origin for the most part
to provincial workshops which had been at all times of mediocre repute, and
where the artists did not receive orders enough to enable them to correct by
practice the defects of their education. We find but few productions of the
Theban school exhibiting bad technique, and if we had only this one monument
of Luxor from which to form our opinion of its merits, it would be sufficient to
prove that the sculptors of Ramses II. were not a whit behind those of Harm
habi or Seti I. Adroitness in cutting the granite or hard sandstone had in no
wise been lost, and the same may be said of the skill in bringing out the
contour and life-like action of the figure, and of the art of infusing into
the features and demeanour of the Pharaoh something of the superhuman
majesty with which the Egyptian people were accustomed to invest their
mouarchs. If the statues of Ramses II. in the portico are not perfect
models of sculpture, they have many good points, and their bold treatment
makes them effectively decorative.^ Eight other statues of Ramses are
arranged along the base of the facade, and two obelisks—one of which has
been at Paris for half a century^—stood on either side of the entrance. The
whole structure lacks unity, and there is nothing corresponding to it in
this respect anywhere else in Egypt. The northern half does not join on to
the southern, but seems to belong to quite a distinct structure, or the two
parts might be regarded as having once formed a single edifice which had
become divided by an accident, which the architect had endeavoured
to unite together again by a line of columns running between two walls.
The masonry of the hypostyle hall at Karnak was squared and dressed,
but the walls had been left undecorated, as was also the case with the
majority of the shafts of the columns and the surface of the architraves.
* Three of these colossal figures, one of them seateJ, are represented on p. 419; and another is given in Masi’ERO, ArcMolofjie EgypGenne, p. 223, fig. 196. 2 Tlie colonnade and the little temple of Thfltmosis III. were concealed under the houses of the village: they were first brought to light in the excavations of 1884-8G. The transportation of the obelisk to Paris was the occasion of a flood of literature, of which Wiedemann gives an account in NJgyptische Geschichte, p. 448, n. 5.

themselves in filling it with furniture, and in taking steps for the repair of
any damage that might accrue to the hall or pillars ; they had their car
touches or inscriptions placed in vacant spaces, but they did not dare to
modify its arrangement. It was reserved for the Ethiopian and Greek
Pharaohs, in presence of the hypostyle and pylon of the dynasty,
to conceive of others on a still vaster scale. Ramses, having completed the
funerary chapel of Seti at Qurneh upon the left bank of the river then began
to think of preparing the edifice destined for the cult of his “ double ”—that

emulation to do something yet more marvellous ? He erected here, at any rate,
a still more colossal figure. The earthquake which shattered Meranon brought
it to the ground, and fragments of it still strew the soil where they fell some
nineteen centuries ago. There are so many of them that the spectator would

up in the hollow of one of its ears as if on a sofa. Behind the court
overlooked by this colossal statue lay a second court, surrounded by a row of
square pillars, each having a figure of Osiris attached to it. The god is
represented as a mummy, the swathings throwing the body and limbs into
relief. His hands are freed from the bandages and are crossed on the breast,
and hold respectively the flail and crook ; the smiling face is surmounted by an
enormous head-dress. The sanctuary with the buildings attached to it has
perished, but enormous brick structures extend round the ruins, forming an
enclosure of storehouses. Here the priests of the “ double ” were accustomed

he constructed in the necropolis
or among the dwellings of the living, all those which he restored, or those
which he merely repaired or inscribed with his cartouches. These are often
cut over the name of the original founder, and his usurpations of monuments
are so numerous that he might be justly accused of having striven to blot out
the memory of his predecessors, and of claiming for himself the entire work
of the whole line of Pharaohs. It would seem as if, in his opinion, the glory
of Egypt began with him, or at least with his father, and that no victorious
campaigns had been ever heard of before those which he conducted against
the Libyans and the Hittites.

Epic reappears everywhere, in Nubia and in the Said, at Abu Simbel, at Beit

torpor into which they had fallen after their capture by Ahmosis. He made a
third capital of Tanis, which rivalled both Memphis and Thebesd Before
this it had been little more than a deserted ruin : he cleared out the debris,
brought a population to the place ; rebuilt the temple, enlarging it by aisles
which extended its area threefold; and here he enthroned, along with the
local divinities, a triad, in which Amonra and Sutkhii sat side by side with
his own deified “ double.” The ruined walls, the overturned stelse, the obelisks
recumbent in the dust, and the statues of his usurped predecessors, all bear
his name. His colossal figure of statuary sandstone, in a sitting attitude like
that at the Kamesseum, projected from the chief court, and seemed to look
down upon the confused ruin of his w'orks.^
We do not know how many wives he had in his harem, but one of the lists
of his children which has come down to us enumerates, although mutilated at
the end, one hundred and eleven sons, while of his daughters we know of
fifty-five.® The majority of these were the offspring of mere concubines or
foreign princesses, and possessed but a secondary rank in comparison with
himself; but by his union with his sisters Nofiitari Maritmut and Isitno
frit, he had at least half a dozen sons and daughters who might aspire to the
throne. Death robbed him of several of these before an opportunity was open
to them to succeed him, and among them Araenhikhopshuf, Amenhiunamif,
and Eamses, who had distinguished themselves in the campaign against the
Khati ; ^ and some of his daughters—Bitaniti, Maritamon, Hibittaiii—by
becoming his wives lost their right to the throne.® About the XXX**'
year of his reign, when he was close upon sixty, he began to think of an
associate, and his choice rested on the eldest surviving son of his queen
Isitnofiit, who was called Khamoisit.® This prince was born before the suc
cession of his father, and had exhibited distinguished bravery under the walls
of Qodshu and at Ascalon.'^ When he was still very young he had been

invested with the office of high priest of the Memphite Phtah, and thus had
secured to him the revenues of the possessions of the god, which were the
largest in all Egypt after those of the Theban Amon. He had a great
reputation for his knowledge of abstruse theological questions and of the
science of magic —a later age attributing to him the
composition of several books on magic giving direc
tions for the invocation of spirits belonging to this
world and the world beyond.^ He became the hero
also of fantastic romances, in which it was related of
liim how, in consequence of his
having stolen from the mummy
of an old wizard the books of
Thot, he became the victim of
possession by a sort of lascivious
and sanguinary ghoul.^ Ramses
relieved himself of the cares of
state by handing over to Khamoisit the government of the country, without,
however, conferring upon him the titles and insignia of royalty. The chief
concern of Kljamohit was to secure the scrupulous observance of the divine
laws. He celebrated at Silsilis * the festivals of the inundation ; he presided
at the commemoration of his father’s apotheosis,® and at the funeral rites of
the Apis who died in the XXX'** year of the king’s reign.® Before his time
each sacred bull had its separate tomb in a quarter of the Memphite
Necropolis known to the Greeks as the Serapeion. The tomb was a small cone
roofed building erected on a square base, and containing only one chamber.
Khamoisit substituted for this a rock-tomb similar to those used by ordinary
individuals. He had a tunnel cut in the solid rock to a depth of about a
hundred yards, and on either side of this a chamber was prepared for each Apis

His regency had lasted for nearly a quarter of a century, wlien, the burden of
government becoming too much for him, he was succeeded in the year of
Eamses by his younger brother Minephtah, who was like himself a son of
Isitnofrit.^ Minephtah acted, during the first twelve years of his
rule, for his_ father, who, having now almost attained the age of
a hundred, passed peacefully away at Thebes in the EXVir*^
year of his reign, full of days and sated with glory.^ He became
the subject of legend almost before he had closed his eyes upon
the world. He had obtained brilliant successes during his
life, and the scenes describing them were depicted in scores
of places. Popular fancy believed everything which he had
related of himself, and added to this all that it knew of
other kings, thus making him the Pharaoh of Pharaohs—the
embodiment of all preceding monarchs. Legend preferred
to recall him by the name Sesusu, Sesusturi— a designation
which had been applied to him by his contemporaries,
and he thus became better known to moderns as Sesostris
than by his proper name Kamses Miamun.® According
to tradition, he was at first sent to Ethiopia with a
fleet of four hundred ships, by which he succeeded
in conquering the coasts of the Red Sea as far as
the Indus. In later times several stelae in the
cinnamon country were ascribed to him. He is

where, on the shore of the Mseotic Sea, he left a number of his soldiers,
whose descendants afterwards peopled Colchis. It was even alleged that he
had ventured into Europe, but that the lack of provisions and the inclemency
of the climate had prevented him from advancing further than Thrace. He
returned to Egypt after an absence of nine years, and after having set up on
his homeward journey statues and stelse everywhere in commemoration of
his victories.^ Herodotus asserts that he
himself had seen several of these monu
ments in his travels in Syria and Ionia.
Some of these are of genuine Egyptian
manufacture, and are to be attributed to
our Eamses; they are to be found near Tyre,
and on the banks of the Nahr el-Kelb,^
M'here they mark the frontier to which his
empire extended in this direction. Others
have but little resemblance to Egyptian
monuments, and were really the work of
the Asiatic peoples among whom they
were found. The two figures referred to
long ago by Herodotus,® which have been
discovered near Ninfi between Sardis and
Smyrna, are instances of the latter. The
shoes of the figures are turned up at the
toe, and the bead-dress has more resemblance to the high hats of the people
of Asia Minor than to the double crown of Egypt, while the lower garment
is striped horizontally in place of vertically. The inscription, moreover, is
in an Asiatic form of writing, and has nothing Egyptian about it.
Eamses II. in his youth was the handsomest man of his time. He was tall
and straight ; his figure was well moulded—the shoulders broad, the arms full
and vigorous, the legs muscular ; the face was oval, with a firm and smiling
mouth, a thin aquiline nose, and large open eyes.® Old age and death did

allies.^ The nations, however, to the north and east, in Libya and in the Medi
terranean islands, had for some time past been in a restless condition, which boded
little good to the empires of the old world. The Timihli, some of them tributaries
from the and others from the first years of the XVIIL*' dynasty, had
always been troublesome, but never really dangerous neighbours. From time
to time it was necessary to send light troops against them, who, sailing along
the coast or following the caravan routes, would enter their territory, force
them from their retreats, destroy their palm groves, carry off their cattle, and
place garrisons in the principal oases—even in Siwah itself. For more than a
century, however, it would seem that more active and numerically stronger
populations had entered upon the stage. A current of invasion, having its
origin in the region of the Atlas, or possibly even in Europe, was setting
towards the Nile, forcing before it the scattered tribes of the Sudan. Who
were these invaders ? Were they connected with the race which had planted
its dolmens over the plains of the Maghreb ? ^ Whatever the answer to this
question may be, we know that a certain number of Berber tribes ®—the Labu
and Mashauasha—who had occupied a middle position between Egypt and
the people behind them, and who had only irregular communications with the
Nile valley, were now pushed to the front and forced to descend upon it.^
They were men tall of stature and large of limb, with fair skins, light hair, and
blue eyes ; everything, in fact, indicating their northern origin. They took
pleasure in tattooing the skin, just as the Tuaregs and Kabyles are now accus
tomed to do, and some, if not all, of them practised circumcision, like a portion
of the Egyptians and Semites.® In the arrangement of the hair, a curl fell
upon the shoulder, while the remainder was arranged in small frizzled locks.
Their chiefs and braves wore on their heads two flowering plumes. A loin
cloth, a wild-beast’s skin thrown over the back, a mantle, or rather a covering
of woollen or dyed cloth, fringed and ornamented with many-coloured needle
work, falling from the left shoulder with no attachment in front, so as
to leave the body unimpeded in walking,—these constituted the ordinary

those of theNumidians—Massyla, Blassinissa, Massiva (Chabas, Ji’tMdes sur VAntiquM Mstorique,2nd

costume of the people.^ Their arms were similar to those of the Egyp
tians, consisting of the lance, the mace, the iron or copper dagger, the
boomerang, the bow and
arrow, and the sling. They
also employed horses and
chariots.^ Their bravery
made them a foe not to
be despised, in spite of
their ignorance of tactics
and their want of discipline.
When they were afterwards
formed into regiments and
conducted by experienced
generals, they became the
best auxiliary troops which
Egypt could boast of. The
Labu from this time forward
were the most energetic of
the tribes, and their chiefs
prided themselves upon
possessing the leadership
over all the other clans in ^ libyan =
this region of the world.^
The Lahu might very well have gained the mastery over the other inhabi
tants of the desert at this period, who had become enfeebled by the frequent
defeats which they had sustained at the hands of the Egyptians. At the

Chabas, Etudes sur V Antiquity, 2nd edit., p. 189), according to the copy published by Brugsch (Geofj. Insclir., vol. ii. pi. xxv. 1. 5). Dumichen (Hut. Inschr., vol. i. pi. ii. I. 13) had read it MaraiuBadidi, making one name out of the two words: and Goodwin compared Badidi, Batita, with Battos, which in the Libyan language (Herodotus, IV. civ.) meant “king” (On the Name of a King of the RahuLihyans, in Zeitschrift, 1868, p. 39) ; Badidi-Batita would thus be a “ Battos,” to whom one would assign the title of “ First,” and who would have lived a long time before the Battos of Cyrene, of whom Herodotus has preserved the semi-legendary history. The name ought to be read Maraiu, son of Didi (Brugsch, Gesch. AEgypt, p. 569; Wiedemann, Algypt. Gesch.,p. 474); Hale'vy thought he had discovered Maraih and Didi in the Libyan inscriptions which he has deciphered (Etudes Berheres I., Essai d'^pigr. Lihyque, p. 168).

ruled over the immense territory lying between the Fajum and the two
Syrtes ; the Timihu, the Kahaka, and the Mashauasha rendered him the
same obedience as his own people. A revolution had thus occurred in Africa
similar to that which had taken place a century previously in Naharaim,
when Sapalulu founded the Hittite empire. A great kingdom rose into
being where no state capable of disturbing Egyptian control had existed
before. The danger was serious. The Hittites, separated from the Nile
by the whole breadth of Kharu, could not directly threaten any of the
Egyptian cities; but the Libyans, lords of the desert, were in contact
with the Delta, and could in a few days fall upon any point in the valley
they chose. Minephtah, therefore, hastened to resist the assault of the
westerns, as his father had formerly done that of the easterns, and,
strange as it may seem, he found among the troops of his new enemies some
of the adversaries with whom the Egyptians had fought under the walls of
Qodshu sixty years before. The Shardana, Lycians, and others, having
left the coasts of the Delta and the Phoenician seaports owing to the
vigilant watch kept by the Egyptians over their waters, had betaken them
selves to the Libyan littoral, where they met with a favourable reception.
Whether they had settled in some places, and formed there those colonies of
which a Greek tradition of a recent age speaks, we cannot say.^ They certainly
followed the occupation of mercenary soldiers, and many of them hired out
their services to the native princes, while others wei’e enrolled among the
troops of the King of the Khati or of the Pharaoh himself. Maraiu brought
with him Achaeans, Shardana, Tursha, Shagalasha,^ and Lycians in consider
able numbers when he resolved to begin the strife.^ This was not one of
those conventional little wars which aimed at nothing further than the im
position of the payment of a tribute upon the conquered, or the conquest of
one of their provinces. Maraiu had nothing less in view than tlie transport
of his whole people into the Nile valley, to settle permanently there as the
Hyksos had done before him.^ He set out on his march towards the end of

the year of the Pharaoh’s reign, or the beginning of his surrounded
by the elite of his troops, “the first choice from among all the soldiers and all
the heroes in each land.” The announcement of their approach spread terror
among the Egyptians. The peace which they had enjoyed for fifty years had
cooled their warlike ardour, and the machinery of their military organisation
had become somewhat rusty. The standing army had almost melted away
the regiments of archers and charioteers were no longer effective, and the
neglected fortresses were not strong enough to protect the frontier. As
a consequence, the oases of Earafrah and of the Natron lakes fell into the
hands of the enemy at the first attack, and the eastern provinces of the Delta
became the possession of the invader before any steps could be taken for their
defence. Memphis, which realised the imminent danger, broke out into open
murmurs against the negligent rulers who had given no heed to the country’s
ramparts, and had allowed the garrisons of its fortresses to dwindle away.
Fortunately Syria remained quiet. The Khati, in return for the aid afforded
them by Minephtah during the famine, observed a friendly attitude, and the
Pharaoh was thus enabled to withdraw the troops from his Asiatic provinces.
He could with perfect security take the necessary measures for ensuring
“ Heliopolis, the city of Tumu,” against surprise, “ for arming Memphis, the
citadel of Phtah-Tonen, and for restoring all things which were in disorder
he fortified Pibalisit, in the neighbourhood of the Shakana canal, on a branch
of that of Heliopolis,” and he rapidly concentrated his forces behind these
quickly organised lines.^ Maraiu, however, continued to advance ; in the
early months of the summer he had crossed the Canopic branch of the Nile,
and was now about to encamp not far from the town of Piriu. When the
king heard of this “ he became furious against them as a lion that fascinates
its victim ; he called his officers together and addressed them : ‘ I am about to
make you hear the words of your master, and to teach you this : I am the
sovereign shepherd who feeds you ; I pass my days in seeking out that which
is useful for you : I am your father ; is there among you a father like me who
makes his children live ? You are trembling like geese, you do not know what
is good to do : no one gives an answer to the enemy, and our desolated land is
it (Extrait d’un M^moire sur les attaques, pp. 6-13), by Lauth (Mgyptische Texte aus der Zeit Blenephtah, in the ZeitscJirift d. D. Morg. Gesellsch., 1867, vol. xxi. pp. 652-699), by Bircli (The Invasion of Egypt by the Greeks, in Becords of the Past, 1st series, vol. iv. pp. 37, 38), by Chabas (Etudes sur I’Antiquite, 2nd edit.,pp. 191-201, and Beeherches pour I’hist. de la XIX'^ dynastie, pp. 84-92), and lastly by Brugsch (Geseh. Mgyptens,pp. 567-577). There are extracts from it on a column at Memphis (Maspero, Notes sur diff^rents points de Grammaire, etc., in the ZeitscJirift, 1881, p. 118), which bears the date of the year V., the 3rd of Epiphi, and upon a stele at Athribis (Maspero, op. cit., in the Zeitsohrift, 1883, pp. 65-67). * With regard to these localities, see Beugsch, Diet.

434 THE BEACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
sibandoned to the incursions of all nations. The barbarians harass the frontier,
rebels violate it every day, every one robs it, enemies devastate our seaports,
they penetrate into the fields of Egypt; if there is an arm of a river they halt
there, they stay for days, for months; . . . they come as numerous as reptiles,
and no one is able to sweep them back, these wretcihes who love death and
hate life, whose hearts meditate the consummation of, our ruin. Behold, they
arrive with their chief; they pass their time on the land which they attack in
filling their stomachs every day ; this is the reason why they come to the land
of Egypt, to seek their sustenance, and their intention is to install themselves
there ; mine is to catch them like fish upon their bellies. Their chief is a dog,
a poor devil, a madman ; he shall never sit down again in his place.’ He
then announced that on the 14th of Epiphi he would himself conduct the
troops against the enemy.
These were brave words, but we may fancy the figure that this king of more
than sixty years of age would have presented in a chariot in the middle of the
fray, and his competence to lead an effective charge against the enemy. On the
other hand, his absence in such a critical position of affairs would have endangered
the morale of his soldiers and possibly compromised the issue of the battle. A
dream settled the whole question.^ While Minephtah was asleep one night,
he saw a gigantic figure of Phtah standing before him, and forbidding him
to advance. “‘Stay,’ cried the god to him, while handing him the curved
khopesh : ‘ put away discouragement from thee ! ’ His Majesty said to him :
* But what am I to do then ? ’ And Phtah answered him : ‘ Despatch thy infantry,
and send before it numerous chariots to tlie confines of the territory of Piriu.’ ” ^
The Pharaoh obeyed the command, and did not stir from his position. Maraiu
had, in the mean time, arranged his attack for the 1st of Epiphi, at the rising
of the sun : it did not take place, however, until the 3rd. “ The archers of His
Majesty made havoc of the barbarians for six hours; they were cut off by the
edge of the sword.” When Maraiu saw the carnage, “ he was afraid, his heart
i'ailed him ; he betook himself to flight as fast as his feet could bear him to save
his life, so successfully that his bow and arrows remained behind him in his
precipitation, as well as everything else he had upon him.” His treasure, his
arms, his wife, together with the cattle which he had brought with him for his

Meyer sees iu this nothing but a customary rhetorical expression, and tliinks that the god spoke in order to encourage the king to defend himself vigorously (Geschichte Mgyptens, p. 307, n. 2). ^ Tills name was read Pa-ariby E. de Kougc {Extrait d’un Memoire sur les attaques, pp. 7, 8), Paali by Lauth {Homer und lEgypten, p. 15), and was transcribed Pa-ari-shop by Brugsch, who identified with Prosopitis (in the ZeitschrifI, 1867, p. 98). The orthography of the text at Athribis {verso,]. 9) shows that we ought to read Piri, Pirfi, Piriu (W. M. Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 357, No. 3) ; possibly the name is identical with that of laru which is mentioned in the Pyramid-texts {Mirniri, 1. 182, PepiL, 1. 145).

use, became the prey of the conqueror ; “ he tore out the feathers from his head
dress, and took flight with such of those wretched Libyans as escaped the
massacre, but the officers wlio had the care of His Majesty’s team of horses
followed in their steps ” and put most of them to the sword. Maraiu suc
ceeded, however, in escaping in the darkness, and regained his own country
without water or provisions, and almost without escort. The conquering
troops returned to the camp laden with booty, and driving before them asses
carrying, as bloody tokens of victory, quantities of hands and phalli cut from
the dead bodies of the slain. The bodies of six generals and of 6359 Libyan
soldiers were found upon the field of battle, together with 222 Shagalasha, 724
Tursha, and some hundreds of Shardana and Achmans : several thousands of
prisoners passed in procession before the Pharaoh, and were distributed among
such of his soldiers as had distinguished themselves.^ These numbers show
the gravity of the danger from which Egypt had escaped : the announcement
of the victory filled the country with enthusiasm, all the more sincere because
of the reality of the panic which had preceded it. The fellahin, intoxicated
with joy, addressed each other : “ ‘ Come, and let us go a long distance on the
road, for there is now no fear in the hearts of men.’ The fortified posts may
at last be left ; the citadels are now open ; messengers stand at the foot of the
walls and wait in the shade for the guard to awake after their siesta, to give
them entrance. The military police sleej) on their accustomed rounds, and the
people of the marshes once more drive their herds to pasture without fear of
raids, for there are no longer marauders near at hand to cross the river ; the cry
of the sentinels is heard no more in the night : ‘ Halt, thou that comest, thou
that comest under a name which is not thine own —sheer off!’ and men no longer
exclaim on the following morning : ‘ Such or such a thing has been stolen ;
’
but the towns fall once more into their usual daily routine, and he who works
in the hope of the harvest, will nourish himself upon that which he shall
have reaped.” ^ The return from Memphis to Thebes was a triumphal march.
“ He is very strong, Binri Minephtah,” sang the court poets, “ very wise are his
projects—his words have as beneficial effect as those of Thot—everything which
lie does is completed to the end. — When he is like a guide at the head of his
armies—his voice penetrates the fortress walls. —Very friendly to those who bow
their backs —before Miamun—his valiant soldiers spare him who humbles him
self—before his courage and before his strength ;—they fall upon the Libyans

they consume the Syrian ;—the Shardana whom thou bast brought back
’ The numbers are partly mutilated in the Triumphal Inscription, 11. 50-61 ; and do not entirely coincide with those on the Athribis inscription (Maspero, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire, § xxsv., in the Zeitsohri/t, 1883, pp. 65-67). * Triumphal Inscription of the Amenophium, in Petrie, Egypt and Israel ( Contemporary Review, No. 365, p. 622) ; I have given a paraphrase of the Egyptian text from the English translation of GrifSth.

them to thy venerable father—Amon, husband
of his mother.” ^ And the poets amuse them
selves with summoning Maraiu to appear in
Egypt, pursued as he was by his own people and
obliged to hide himself from them. “He is
nothing any longer but a beaten man, and has
become a proverb among theLabu, and his chiefs
repeat to themselves : ‘ Nothing of the kind has
occurred since the time of Ra.’ The old men say
each one to his children : ‘ Misfortune to the
Labu ! it is all over with them ! No one can any
longer pass peacefully across the country ; but
the power of going out of our land has been
taken from us in a single day, and the Tihonu
have been withered up in a single year; Sutkhu has ceased to be their chief,
and he devastates their “duars; ” there is nothing left but to conceal oneself,.
and one feels nowhere secure except in a fortress.’ ” The news of the victory
was carried throughout Asia, and served to discourage the tendencies to revolt
which were beginning to make themselves manifest there. “ The chiefs gave
there their salutations of peace, and none among the nomads raised his head
after the crushing defeat of the Libyans ; Khati is at peace, Canaan is a
prisoner as far as the disaffected are concerned, the inhabitant of Ascalon is
led away, Gezer is carried into captivity, lanuamim is brought to nothing, the
Israilu are destroyed and have no longer seed, Kharu is like a widow of the land
of Egypt.” ^ Minephtah ought to have followed up his opportunity to the end,
but he had no such intention, and his inaction gave Maraiu time to breathe.
Perhaps the effort which he had made had exhausted his resources, perhaps

old age prevented him from prosecuting his success ; he was content, in any
case, to station bodies of pickets on the frontier, and to fortify a few new posi

position as that in which the Hittite had been after the campaign of Seti I.
its power had been checked for the moment, but it remained intact on the
Egyptian frontier, awaiting its opportunity.
Minephtah lived for some time after this memorable year V.,^ and the
number of monuments which belong to this period show that he reigned in
peace. We can see that he carried out w'orks in the same places as his
father before him ; at Tanis as well as Thebes, in Nubia as well as in the
Delta.® He worked the sandstone quarries for his building materials, and
continued the custom of celebrating the feasts of the inundation at Silsileh.

is really a chapel, with its architraves and columns, and still excites the

intrigues of princes who aspired to the throne, and by the
ambition of the ministers to whom he was obliged to delegate
his authority. One of the latter, a man of Semite origin,
named Ben-Azana, of Zor-bisana, wlio had assumed the appel
lation of his first patron, Eamsesupirniri, appears
to have acted for him as regent.^ Minephtah was
succeeded, apparently, by one of his sons, called
Seti, after his great-grandfather.^ Seti II. had
doubtless reached middle age at the time of his
accession, but his portraits represent him, never
theless, with the face and figure of a young man.®

haughty, and somewhat melancholic. It is the
type of Seti I. and Eamses II., but enfeebled
and, as it were, saddened. An inscrip

tion of his second year attributes to
him victories in Asia,^ but others of
the same period indicate the existence
of disturbances similar to those which
had troubled the last years of his father.
These were occasioned by a certain
Aiari, who was high priest of Phtah, and who had usurped titles which
belonged ordinarily to the Pharaoh or his eldest son, “ heir in the house of
Sibu, and hereditary prince of the two lands.” ® Seti died, it would seem, without

which is also the view of Brugsch ( Gesch, AGgyptens, p. 585), Wiedemann CEgyqAische Geschichte, p. 481),
and Ed. Meyer {Gesch. des alien . Egyptens, p. 308). The succession as it is now given does not seem to
me to be free from difficulties; the solution generally adopted has only the merit of being preferable to that of E. de Rouge, which I previously supported. ^ The last date known of his reign is the year II. (Champollion, Monuments de VEgyple, etc., vol. i. p. 258) which is found at Silsilis ; Chabas was, nevertheless, of tlie opinion that he reigned a
considerable time {Itecherches pour Vlnstoirc de la XIX‘ dynastie, p. 125). * Champollion, Monuments, etc., vol. i. p. 78; Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 204 a. Tiie expressions employed in this document do not vary much from the usual protocol of all kings of this period.

Meyer, Gesch. des Alien .Aigyptens, p. 308, n. 3), to the myth of Horus, similar to that which I pointed out further back (p. 254, n. 2) relating to Thhtmosis III., and which we more usually meet with in the cases of those kings who were not marked out from their birtli onwards for the throne. ^ Bai has lett two inscriptions behind him, one at Silsilis (Champollion, Monuments, etc., pi. cxx. 4 ; Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 202 o; cf. the translation of the text in Brdgsch, Geschichte AUgyptens, pp.

received in audience at Thebes messengers from all foreign nations.^ He
kept up so zealously the appearance of universal dominion, that to judge from
his inscriptions he must have been the equal of the most powerful of his
predecessors at Thebes.
Egypt, nevertheless, was proceeding at a quick pace towards its downfall.
No sooner had this monarch disappeared than it began to break up.® There
were no doubt many claimants for the crown, but none of them succeeded in
disposing of the claims of his rivals, and anarchy reigned supreme from one
end of the Nile valley to the other. “ The land of Qimit began to drift away,
and the people within it had no longer a sovereign, and this, too, for many years,
until other times came ; for the land of Qimit was in the hands of the princes
ruling over the nomes, and they put each other to death, both great and small.
Other times came afterwards, during years of nothingness, in which Arisu, a
Syrian,'* was chief among them, and the whole country paid tribute before him ;
•every one plotted with his neiglibour to steal the goods of others, and it was the
same with regard to the gods as with regard to men, offerings were no longer
made in the temples.” ® This was in truth the revenge of the feudal system upon
Pharaoh. The barons, kept in check by Ahmosis and Amenothes I, restricted by
the successors of these sovereigns to the position of simple officers of the king,
profited by the general laxity to recover as many as possible of their ancient
privileges. For half a century and more, fortune had given them as masters
only aged princes, not capable of maintaining continuous vigilance and firmness.

FOREIGN CAPTIVES IN EGYPT. 441
The invasions of the peoples of the sea, the rivalry of the claimants to the
throne, and the intrigues of ministers had, one after the other, served to break the
bonds which fettered them, and in one generation they were able to regain that
liberty of action of which they had been deprived for centuries. To this state
of things Egypt had been drifting from the earliest times. Unity could be
maintained only by a continuous effort, and once this became relaxed, the ties
which bound the whole country together
were soon broken. There was another
danger threatening the country beside that
arising from the weakening of the hands of
the sovereign, and the turbulence of the
barons. For some three centuries the Theban
Pharaohs were accustomed to bring into
the country after each victorious campaign
many thousands of captives. The number
of foreigners around them had, therefore, in
creased in a striking manner. The majority
•of these strangers either died without
issue, or their posterity became assimilated
to the indigenous inhabitants. In many places, however, they had accumulated
in such proportions that they were able to retain among themselves the remem
brance of their origin, their religion, and their customs, and with these the
natural desire to leave the country of their exile for their former fatherland.
As long as a strict watch was kept over them they remained peaceful subjects,
but as soon as this vigilance was relaxed rebellion was likely to break out,
especially amongst those who worked in the quarries. Traditions of the Greek
period contain certain romantic episodes in the history of these captives. Some
Babylonian prisoners brought back by Sesostris, these traditions tell us,
unable to endure any longer the fatiguing work to which they were condemned,
broke out into open revolt. They made themselves masters of a position almost
•opposite Memphis, and commanding the river, and held their ground there
with such obstinacy that it was found necessary to give up to them the province
which they occupied : they built here a town, which they afterwards called
Babylon. A similar legend attributes the building of the neighbouring village
of Troiu to captives from Troy.^ The scattered barbarian tribes of the Delta,

The name Babylon comes probably from Banbonu, Barhonu, Babonua term which, under the form Hdt-Banhonu, served to designate a quarter of Heliopolis, or rather a suburban village of that city (Brugsch, Diotionnaire g^ographique, pp. 194, 195).

whether Hebrews or tlie remnant of the Hyksos/ had endured there a miserable
lot ever since the accession of the Ramessides. The rebuilding of the cities
which had been destroyed there during the wars with the Hyksos had restricted
the extent of territory on which they could pasture their herds. Ramses II.
treated them as slaves of the treasury,^ and the Hebrews were not long under his
rule before they began to look back with regret on the time of the monarchs
“ who knew Joseph.” “ The Egyptians set over them taskmasters to afflict
them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure eities, Pithom
and Raamses. But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and
grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel.” ^ Further
details on their condition are supplied in the following verses of the Biblical
narrative : “ They made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar and in
brick, and in all manner of service in the field.” ^ The unfortunate slaves
awaited only an opportunity to escape from the cruelty of their persecutors.
The national traditions of the Hebrews inform us that the king, in dis
pleasure at seeing them increase so mightily notwithstanding his repression,
commanded the midwives to strangle henceforward their male children at
their birth. A woman of the house of Levi, after having concealed her
infant for three months, put him in an ark of bulrushes and consigned him
to the Nile, at a place where the daughter of Pharaoh was accustomed to
bathe. The princess on perceiving the child had compassion on him, adopted
him, called him Illoses—saved from the waters—and had him instructed in
all the knowledge of the Egyptians. Moses had already attained forty years
of age, when he one day encountered an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, and
slew him in his anger, shortly afterwards fleeing into the land of Midian.
Here he found an asylum, and Jethro the priest gave him one of his daughters
in marriage. After forty years of exile, God, appearing to him in a burning
bush, sent him to deliver His people. The old Pharaoh was dead, but Moses
and his brother Aaron betook themselves to the court of the new Pharaoh,
consulted were products of the Saite period, and intended to explain to Greeks the existence on Egyptian territory of names recalling those of Babylon in Olialdaea and of Homeric Troy. * See pp. 88, 89 of the present work for further information on these captives.
^ A very ancient tradition identifies Ramses II. with the Pharaoh “ who knew not Joseph ” {Exod.
i. 8). Recent excavations showing that the great works in the east of the Delta began under thisking, or under Seti II. at the earliest, confirm in a general way the accuracy ot the traditional view I have, therefore, accepted it in part, and placed the Exodus after the death of Ramses II. Other authorities place it further back, and Lieblein in 1863 was inclined to put it under Amenothes III. CEgyptische Chronologie, pp. 116-125). ^ Exod. i. 11, 12. Excavations made by Naville have brought to light near Tel el-Maskhutah the ruins of one of the towns which the Hebrews of the Alexandrine period identified with the citiesconstructed by their ancestors in Egypt: the town excavated by Naville is Pitumu, and consequently^ the Pithom ot the Biblical account, and at the same time also the Succoth of Exod. xii. 37, xiii. 20, the first station of the Bne-Israel after leaving Ramses (Naville, Tlie Store-City oj Ptthom and theRoute of the Exodus, pp. 1-13). * Exod. i. 13, 14.

and demanded from him permission for the Hebrews to sacrifice in the desert
of Arabia. They obtained it, as we know, only after the infliction of the ten
plagues, and after the firstborn of the Egyptians had been stricken.^ The
emigrants started from Eamses; as they were pursued by a body of troops, the
Sea parted its waters to give them passage over the dry ground, and closing up
afterwards on the Egyptian hosts, overwhelmed them to a man. Thereupon
Moses and the children of Israel sang this song unto Jahveli, saying: “ Jahveh
is my strength and song—and He has become my salvation.—This is my God,
and I will praise Him,—my father’s God, and I will exalt Him. —The Lord is
a man of war,—and Jahveli is His name.—Pharaoh’s chariots and his hosts
hath He cast into the sea,—and his chosen captains are sunk in the sea of
weeds. —The deeps cover them—they went down into the depths like a
stone. . . . The enemy said : ‘ I will pursue, I will overtake — I will divide the
spoil—my lust shall be satiated upon them—I will draw my sword — iny hand
shall destroy them.’—Thou didst blow with Thy wind—the sea covered them
they sank as lead in the mighty waters.”'^ From this narrative we see that
the Hebrews, or at least those of them who dwelt in the Delta, made their
escape from their oppressors, and took refuge in the solitudes of Arabia.^
According to the opinion of accredited historians, this Exodus took place in the
reign of Minephtah,^ and the evidence of the triumphal inscription, lately dis
covered by Prof. Petrie, seems to confirm this view, in relating that the people
of Israilu were destroyed, and had no longer a seed.® The context indicates
pretty clearly that these ill-treated Israilu were then somewhere south of Syria,
possibly in the neighbourhood of Ascalon and Gezer. If it is the Biblical

Recherches pour servir a I'histoire de V Egypte aux temps de VExode, p. 99, et seq.).

444 TEE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
Israelites who are here mentioned for the first time on an Egyptian monument,
one might suppose that they had just quitted the land of slavery to begin their
wanderings through the desert. Although the peoples of the sea and the
Libyans did not succeed in reaching their settlements in the land of Goshen,
the Israelites must have profited both by the disorder into which the Egyp
tians were thrown by the invaders, and by the consequent withdrawal to
Memphis of the troops previously stationed on the east of the Delta, to
break away from their servitude and cross the frontier. If, on the other
hand, the Israilu of Minephtah are regarded as a tribe still dwelling among
the mountains of Canaan, while the greater part of the race had emigrated
to the banks of the Nile,^ there is no need to seek long after Minephtah for
a date suiting the circumstances of the Exodus. The years following the
reign of Seti II. offer favourable conditions for such a dangerous enterprise
the break-up of the monarchy, the discords of the barons, the revolts among
the captives, and the supremacy of a Semite over the other chiefs,^ must have
minimised the risk. We can readily understand how, in the midst of national
disorders, a tribe of foreigners weary of its lot might escape from its settle
ments and betake itself towards Asia without meeting with strenuous opposition
from the Phai'aoh, who would naturally be too much preoccupied with his
own pressing necessities to trouble himself much over the escape of a band
of serfs.
Having crossed the Red Sea, the Israelites pursued their course to the
north-east on the usual road leading into Syria, and then turning towards
the south, at length arrived at Sinai. It was a moment when the nations
of Asia were stirring. To proceed straight to Canaan by the beaten track would
have been to run the risk of encountering their moving hordes, or of jostling
against the Egyptian troops, who still garrisoned the strongholds of the She
phelah. The fugitives had, therefore, to shun the great military roads if they
were to avoid coming into murderous conflict with the barbarians, or running into
the teeth of Pharaoh’s pursuing army. The desert offered an appropriate asylum
to people of nomadic inclinations like themselves ; they betook themselves
to it as if by instinct, and spent there a wandering life for several generations.®
' This is the. opinion adopted by Petrie, after mature consideration, in an article in which he has published on the Triumphal Inscription of Minephtah {Egypt and Israel, in the Contemporary Review, No. 365, pp. 625-627). [Spiegelbeeg, erste Erimlinung Israels in einem AUgyptischen Texte, in the Sitzungsherichte d. K. Preussischen Akad. d.Wissenschaften zu Berlin, sxv., gives no ojrinion, and Prof.

They have been accepted only by Wiedemann, JEgyptisohe Geschichte, p. 493. ’ This explanation of the •wanderings of the Israelites has been doubted by most historians : it has a cogency, once we admit the reality of the sojourn in Egypt and the Exodus.



TEE EXODUS OF THE HEBREWS. 445
Tlie Biblical narrative describes at length their marches and their halting
places, the great sufferings they endured, and the striking miracles which
Grod performed on their behalf^ Moses conducted them through all these
experiences, continually troubled by their murmurings and seditions, but
always ready to help them out of the difficulties into which they were led,,
on every occasion, by their want of faith. He taught them, under God’s
direction, how to correct the bitterness of brackish waters by applying to
them the wood of a certain tree.^ When they began to look back with
regret to the “ fleshpots of Egypt ” and the abundance of food there,
another signal miracle was performed for them. “ At even the quails came
up and covered the camp, and in the morning the dew lay round about the
host; and when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of
the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on
the ground. And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to
another, ‘What is it? ’.for they wist not what it was. And Moses said unto
them, ‘ It is the bread which the Lord hath given you to eat.’ ” ^ “ And the
house of Israel called the name thereof ‘ manna : ’ and it was like coriander
seed, white ; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey.” ^ “ And the
children of Israel did eat the manna forty years, until they came to a land
inhabited ; they did eat the manna until they came unto the borders of the
land of Canaan.”® Further on, at Eephidim, the water failed : Moses struck
the rocks at Horeb, and a spring gushed out.® The Amalekites, in the mean,
time, began to oppose their passage ; and one might naturally doubt the power
of a rabble of slaves, unaccustomed to war, to break through such an obstacle.
Joshua was made their general, “and MoSes, Aaron, and Hur went up to the
top of the hill : and it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel
prevailed, and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. But Moses’
' The itiaerary of the Hebrew people through the desert contains a very small number of names which were not actually in use. They represent possibly either the stations at which the caravans of the merchants put up, or the localities where the Bedawin and their herds were accustomed to sojourn. The majority of tliem cannot be identified, but enough can still be made out to give us a general idea of tlie march of the emigrants (Reuss, L'Histoire Sainte et la Loi, vol. ii. p. 273, n. 4, in connexion with Numb, xxxiii.). ^ Exod. XV. 23-25, The station Marah, “ the bitter waters,” is identified by modern tradition

of these regions— see F. de Lessees, L’lsthme de Suez, p. 10. ’ Exod. xvi. 13-15. * Exod. xvi. 31. From early times the manna of the Hebrews has been identified with the mannes-sama, “ the gift of heaven,” of the Arabs, which exudes in small quantities from the leaves of the tamarisk after being pricked by insects ; the question, however, is still under discussion whether another species of vegetable manna may not be meant. ® Exod. xvi. 35. ® Exod. xvii. 1-7. There is a general agreement as to the identification of Eephidim with the Wady Feiran, the village of Pharan of the Graeco-Roman geographers (Ebers, Durch Gosen zum Sinai,. p. 189, et seq.).



440 THE REACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
hands were heavy ; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat
tliereon ; and Aaron and Hur stayed up his hands, the one on the one side,
and the other on the other side, and his hands were steady until the going
down of the sun. And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the
edge of the sword.” ^ Three months after the departure of the Israelites from
Egypt they encamped at the foot of Sinai, and “ the Lord called unto Moses
out of the mountain, saying, ‘ Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and
tell the children of Israel: Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians,
-and liow I bare you on eagles’ wings, and brought you unto Myself. Now
therefore, if ye will obey My voice indeed, and keep My covenant, then ye
-shall be a peculiar treasure unto Me from among all peoples : for all the earth
is Mine : and ye shall be unto Me a kingdom of priests, and an holy nation.’
The people answered together and said, ‘ All that the Lord hath spoken we
will do.’ And the liOrd said unto Moses, ‘ Lo, I come unto thee in a thick
cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and may also believe
thee for ever.’ ” “ On the third day, when it was morning, there were thunders
and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of a trumpet
exceeding loud ; and all the people that were in the camp trembled. And
IMoses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet God ; and they stood
at the nether part of the mountain. And Mount Sinai was altogether on
smoke, because the Lord descended upon it in fire : and the smoke thereof
ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount quaked greatly.
And when the voice of the trumpet waxed louder and louder, Moses spake,
and God answered him by a voice.” ^ Then followed the giving of the supreme
law, the conditions of the covenant which the Lord Himself deigned to pro
mulgate directly to His people. It was engraved on two tables of stone,
and contained, in ten concise statements, the commandments which the Creator
of the Universe imposed upon the people of His choice.
“ I. I am Jahveh, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt. Thou
shalt have none other gods before Me.
11.
Thou shalt not make unto thee a graven image, etc.
III. Thou shalt not take the name of Jahveh thy God in vain.
IV. Kemember the sabbath day to keep it holy.
V. Honour thy father and thy mother.
VI. Thou shalt do no murder’.
Vll. Thou shalt not commit adultery.
VlII. Thou shalt not steal.
‘ Exod. xvii. 8-13. " Exod. xix. 3-G, !), 1G-I9.



THE 21ARCH OF THE HEBREWS TO SINAI. 447
IX. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.
X. Thou shalt not covet.” ^
“ And all the people saw the thunderings, and the lightnings, and the voice
of the trumpet, and the mountain smoking : and wlien the people saw it, they
trembled, and stood afar off. And they said unto Moses, ‘ Speak thou with us,
and we will hear : but let not God speak with us, lest we die.’ ” ^ God gave His
commandments to Moses in instalments as the circumstances required them :
on one occasion the rites of sacrifice, the details of the sacerdotal vest
ments, the mode of consecrating the priests, the composition of the oil and
the incense for the altar; later on, the observance of the three annual
festivals, and the orders as to absolute rest on the seventh day, as to the
distinctions between clean and unclean animals, as to drink, as to the puri
fication of women, and lawful and unlawful marriages.® The people waited
from week to week until Jahveh had completed the revelation of His com
mands, and in their impatience broke the new law more than once. On one
occasion, when “Moses delayed to come out of the mount,” they believed
themselves abandoned by heaven, and obliged Aaron, the high priest, to
make for them a golden calf, before which they offered burnt offerings. The
sojourn of the people at the foot of Sinai lasted eleven months. At the end
of this period they set out once more on their slow marches to the Promised
Land, guided during the day by a cloud, and during the night by a pillar of
fire, wliich moved before them. This is a general summary of what we find
in the sacred writings.
The Israelites, when they set out from Egypt, were not yet a nation.^ They
were but a confused horde, flying with their herds from their pursuers ; with
no resources, badly armed, and unfit to sustain the attack of regular troops.
After leaving Sinai, they wandered for some time among the solitudes of Arabia
Petrsea in search of some uninhabited country where they could fix their tents,
and at'length settled on the borders of Idumaea, in the mountainous region
surrounding Kadesh-Barnea.® Kadesh had from ancient times a reputation for
' We have two forms of the Decalogue—one in Exod. xx. 2-17, and the other in Deut. v. G-18. - Exod. XX. 18, 19. ^ This legislation and the history of the circumstances on which it was promulgated are contained in four of the books of the Pentateuch, viz. Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. Various works have appeared of late dealing with these books from a critical point of view. I confine myself here and afterwards only to such results as may fitly be used in a general liistory. * A hasty reconstruction of the liistory of the Exodus was attempted by Wellhausen, Abriss der GeschicMe Israels, in the Skizzen und Vorarbeiten, vol. i. pp. 6-14 ; and in a much more conservative fashion by Renan, Histoire du peuple d’ Israel, vol. i. pp. 165-210. ^ The site of Kadesh-Barnea appears to have been fixed with certainty at Ain-QaOis by C. Tru3Ibdll, A Visit to Ain Qadis, the supposed Site of Kadesh-Barnea, iu the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund, 1881, pp. 208-212.



448 THE BEACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
sanctity among the Bedawin of the neighbourhood : it rejoiced in the posses
sion of a wonderful well— the Well of Judgment—to which visits were made
for the purpose of worship, and for obtaining the “judgment” of GodJ The
country is a poor one, arid and burnt up, but it contains wells which never
fail, and wadys suitable for the culture of wheat and for the rearing of cattle.
The tribe which became possessed of a region in which there was a perennial
supply of water was fortunate indeed, and a fragment of the psalmody of Israel
at the time of their sojourn here still echoes in a measure the transports of joy
which the people gave way to at the discovery of a new spring : “ Spring up,
0 well ; sing ye unto it : the well which the princes digged, which the nobles
of the people delved with the sceptre and with their staves.”^ The wanderers
took possession of this region after some successful brushes with the enemy,
and settled there, without being further troubled by their neighbours or by
their former masters. The Egyptians, indeed, absorbed in their civil discords,
or in wars with foreign nations, soon forgot their escaped slaves, and never
troubled themselves for centuries over what had become of the poor wretches,
until in the reign of the Ptolemies, when they had learned from the Bible
something of the people of God, they began to seek in their own annals for
traces of their sojourn in Egypt and of their departure from the country. A
new version of the Exodus was the result, in which Hebrew tradition was
clumsily blended with the materials of a semi-historical romance, of which
Amenothes HI. was the hero. His minister and namesake, Amenothes, son
of Hapu, left ineffaceable impressions on the minds of the inhabitants of
Thebes : he not only erected the colossal figures in the Amenophium, but he
constructed the chapel at Heir el-Meclineh, which was afterwards restored in
Ptolemaic times, and where he continued to be worshipped as long as the
Egyptian religion lasted.® Profound knowledge of the mysteries of magic were
attributed to him, as in later times to Prince Khamoisit, son of Ramses 11.^
On this subject he wrote certain works which maintained their reputation for
' Gen. xiv. 7 mentions this “ Well of Judgment, En-Mishpat, — which is Kadesh.” S. Jerome, however, Unomasticon, s.v. Puteus Judicis, distinguishes En-Mishpat from Kadesh-Barnea, and places the former in a locality which lie calls Beer-dan, in the valley of Gerar. - Numb. xxi. 17, 18. The context makes it certain that this song was sung at Beer, beyond the Arnon, in the land of Moab. It has long been recognised that it had a special reference, and that it refers to an incident in the wanderings of the people through the de.sert. ’ With regard to Amenothes, son of Ilapu, see pp. 299, 301 of the present' work. On the worship given to him in the temple of Deir el-Medineh, cf. Ekman, Amenophis, Sohn des Paapis, in the ZeitscUrift, 1877, pp. 147, 148.

AN EGYPTIAN ROMANCE OF TEE EXODUS. 449
more than a thousand years after his death,^ and all that was known about
him marked him out for the important part he came to play in those
romantic stories so popular among the Egyptians. The Pharaoh in whose
good graces he lived had a desire, we are informed, to behold the gods, after
the example of his ancestor Horus.^ The son of Hapu, or Pa- Apis, informed
him that he could not succeed in his design until he had expelled from the
country all the lepers and unclean persons who contaminated it. Acting
on this information, he brought together all those who suffered from physical
defects, and confined them, to the number of eighty thousand, in the quarries
of Turah, There were priests among them, and the gods became wrathful
at the treatment to which their servants were exposed ; the soothsayer,
therefore, fearing the divine anger, predicted that certain people would
shortly arise who, forming an alliance with the Ilnclean, would, together
with them, hold sway in Egypt for thirteen years. He then committed
suicide, but the king nevertheless had compassion on the outcasts, and
granted to them, for their exclusive use, the town of Avaris, which had been
deserted since the time of Ahmosis. The outcasts formed themselves into
a nation under the rule of a Heliopolitan priest called Osarsyph, or Moses,
who gave them laws, mobilised them, and joined his forces with the de
scendants of the Shepherds at Jerusalem. The Pharaoh Amenophis, taken by
surprise at this revolt, and remembering the words of his minister Amenothes,
took flight into Ethiopia. The shepherds, in league with the Unclean, burned
the towns, sacked the temples, and broke in pieces the statues of the gods
they forced the Egyptian priests to slaughter even their sacred animals, to
cut them up and cook them for their foes, who ate them derisively in their
accustomed feasts. Amenophis returned from Ethiopia, together w'ith his son
Ramses, at the end of thirteen years, defeated the enemy, driving them back
into Syria, where the remainder of them became later on the Jewish nation.^

Harmhabi himself belonged to the XVIir** dynasty, for he modelled the form of his cartouches on those of the Ahmesside Pharaohs : the NIX**" dynasty began only, in all probability, with Eamses I., but the
course of the history has compelled me to separate Harmhabi from his preilecessors. Not knowing the length of the reigns, we cannot determine the total duration of the dynasty ; we shall not, however, he fur wrong in assigning to it a length of 130 years or thereabouts, i.e. from 1350 to somewhere near 1220 b.c.

450 THE EEACTION AGAINST EGYPT.
This is but a romance, in which a very little history is mingled with
a great deal of fable : the scribes as well as the people were acquainted
with the fact that Egypt had been in danger of dissolution at the time
when the Hebrews left the banks of the Nile, but they were ignorant of
the details, of the precise date and of the name of the reigning Pharaoh. A
certain similarity in sound suggested to them the idea of assimilating the
prince whom the Chroniclers called Menepthes or Amenepthes with Amenothes,
i.e. Amenophis III. ; and they gave to the Pharaoh of the XIX*'' dynasty the
minister who had served under a king of the XVIII"' ; they metamorphosed
at the same time the Hebrews into lepers allied with the Shepherds. From
this strange combination there resulted a narrative which at once fell in with
the tastes of the lovers of the marvellous, and was a sufficient substitute
for the truth which had long since been forgotten. As in the case of the
Egyptians of the Greek period, we can see only through a fog what took
place after the deaths of Minephtah and Seti II. We know only for certain
that the chiefs of the nomes were in perpetual strife with each other,
and that a foreign power was dominant in the country as in the time of
Apophis. The days of the empire would have been numbered if a deliverer
had not promptly made his appearance. The direct line of Ramses 11.
was extinct, but his innumerable sons by innumerable concubines had left a
posterity out of which some at least might have the requisite ability and zeal,
if not to save the empire, at least to lengthen its duration, and once more give
to Thebes days of glorious prosperity. Egypt had set out some five centuries
before this for the conquest of the world, and fortune had at first smiled upon
her enterprise. Thutmosis I., ThutmosisIII., and the several Pharaohs bearing
the name of Amenothes had marched with their armies from the upper waters
of the Nile to the banks of the Euphrates, and no power had been able to with
stand them. New nations, however, soon rose up to oppose her, and the Hittites
in Asia and the Libyans of the Sudan together curbed her ambition. Neither
the triumphs of Pi,amses II. nor the victory of Minephtah had been able to
restore her prestige, or the lands of which her rivals had robbed her beyond
her ancient frontier. Now her own territory itself was threatened, and her
own well-being was in question ; she was compelled to consider, not how to
rule other tribes, great or small, but how to keep her own possessions intact
and independent ; in short, her very existence was at stake.

1 S in a former crisis, Egypt once more owed her salvation
to a scion of the old Theban race. A descendant of
Seti I. or Ramses II., named Nakhtusit, rallied round him
the forces of tlie southern nomes, and succeeded, though not
without difficulty, in dispossessing the Syrian Arisu. “ When
he arose, he was like Sutkhu, providing for all the necessities
of the country which, for feebleness, could not stand,
killing the rebels which were in the Delta, purifying
the great throne of Egypt ; he was regent of the
two lands in the place of Tumu, setting himself to
reorganise that which had been overthrown, to such
good purpose, that each one recognised as brethren
those who had been separated from him as by a wall
for so long a time, strengthening the temples by
pious gifts, so that the traditional rites could be
celebrated at the divine cycles.” ^ Many w^ere the
difficulties that he had to encounter before he could restore to his country

that peace and wealtli which she had enjoyed under the long reign of Sesostris.
It seems probable that his advancing years made him feel unequal to the
task, or that he desired to guard against the possibility of disturbances in
the event of his sudden death ; at all events, he associated with himself on the
throne his eldest son Eamses—not, however, as a Pharaoh who had full rights
to the crown, like the coadjutors of the Amenemhaits and IJsirtasens, but as
a prince invested with extraordinary powers, after the example of the sons of the
Pharaohs Thiitmosis and Seti I. Kamses recalls with pride, towards the close of
his life, how his father “ had promoted him to the dignity of heir-presumptive
to the throne of Sibil,” and how he had been acclaimed as “ the supreme head
of Qimit for the administration of the whole earth united together.” ^ This
constituted the rise of a new dynasty on the ruins of the old —the last, how
ever, which was able to retain the supremacy of Egypt over the Oriental world.
We are unable to ascertain how long this double reign lasted. Nakhtusit,
fully occupied by enemies within the country, had no leisure either to build or
to restore any monuments ;
^ on his death, as no tomb had been prepared for him,
his mummy was buried in that of the usurper Siphtah and the Queen Tausirit.^
He was soon forgotten, and hut few traces of his services survived him ; his
Ufime was subsequently removed from the official list of the kings, while others
not so deserving as he —as, for instance, Siphtah-Minephtah and Amenmesis
were honourably inscribed in it.^ The memory of his son overshadowed his
own, and the series of the legitimate kings who formed the XX**' dynasty did
not include him. Kamses III. took for his hero his namesake, Kamses the
Great, and endeavoured to rival him in everything. This spirit of imitation
was at times the means of leading him to commit somewhat puerile acts, as,
for example, when he copied certain triumphal inscriptions word for word,
Vhistoire de la XIX‘ dynastie, pp. 23-27 ; Eisenlohr-Bircu, The Annals of Rameses III., in the Records of the Past, 1st series, vol. viii. pp. 46, 47. The exact relationship between Nakhtusit and Kamses II. is not known ; he was probably the grandson or great-grandson of that sovereign, though Ed. Meyer thinks he was perhaps the son of Seti II. (Gesoh. des Alien ASgyptens, p. 310). The name should be read either Nakldtsit, with the singular of the first word composing it, or Nakhitusit, Nakhtftsit, with the plural, as in the analogous name of the king of the XXX‘'‘ dynasty, Neotanebo. ’ The Greed Harris Pa-pyrus, pi. 75, 11. 10-76, 1. 1 ; the only certain monument that we as yet possess of this double reign is a large stele cut on the rock behind Medinet-Habfi (Lepsius, X>ew7rm., iii. 206 d). ^ 'Wiedemann (JEgyptische Gesch., p. 490) attributes to him the construction of one of the doors of the temple of Mut at Karnak ; it would appear that there is a confusion in his notes between the prenomen of this sovereign and that of Seti II., who actually did decorate one of the doorways of that temple (Cuampoi.lion, 3Ivn. de VEgypte, etc., vol. ii. p. 263). Nakliusit must have also worked on the temple of Phtah at Memphis CWtedemann, ^-Egyptische Geseli., p. 490). His cartouche is met with on a statue originally dedicated by a Pharaoh of the XTP'* dynasty, discovered at Tell-Nebesheh (Petkie, Tunis II., Tell-Nehesheh, pp. 11, 29, 31, pi. x. 6 h). ^ Champollion, Mon. de VEgypte, etc., vol. i. pp. 448, 459, 606-608 ; of.

necessary determination to accomplish them.
He began by restoring order in the admini

But since the death of Khatusaru, the power of the Khati had considerably
declined, and they retained their position merely through their former prestige ;
they were in as much need of peace, or even more so, than the Egyptians, for
the same discords which had harassed the reigns of Seti II. and his successors
had doubtless brought trouble to their own sovereigns. They had made no
serious efforts to extend their dominion over any of those countries which had
been the objects of the cupidity of their forefathers, while the peoples of
Kharu and Phoenicia, thrown back on their own resources, had not ventured
to take up arms against the Pharaoh. The yoke lay lightly upon them, and
in no way hampered their internal liberty ; they governed as they liked, they
exchanged one prince or chief for another, they waged petty wars as of old,
without, as a rule, exposing themselves to interference from the Egyptian troops
occupying the country, or from the “ royal messengers.” These vassal provinces

had probably ceased to pay tribute, or had done so irregularly, during the
years of anarchy following the death of Siphtah, but they had taken no
concerted action, nor attempted any revolt, so that when Kamses III. ascended
the throne he was spared the trouble of reconquering them. He had merely
to claim allegiance to have it at once rendered him —an allegiance which
included the populations in the neighbourhood of Qodshu and on the banks of
the Nahr el-Kelb.^ The empire, which had threatened to fall to pieces amid
the civil wars, and which would indeed have succumbed had they continued
a few years longer, again revived now that an energetic prince had been found
to resume the direction of affairs, and to weld together those elements which
had been on the point of disintegration.^
One state alone appeared to regret the revival of the Imperial power ; this
was the kingdom of Libya. It had continued to increase in size since the
days of Minephtah, and its population had been swelled by the annexation of
several strange tribes inhabiting the vast area of the Sahara. One of these,
the Mashauasha, acquired the ascendency among these desert races owing to
their numbers and valour, and together with the other tribes—the Sabati,
the Kaiakasha, the Shaiu, the Hasa, the Bikana, and the Qahaka formed
a confederacy, which now threatened Egypt on the west. This federation
was conducted by Didi, Mashaknu, and Slaraiu, all children of that Maraiu
who had led the first Libyan invasion, and also by Zamaru and Zautmaru,
two princes of less important tribes.^ Their combined forces had attacked
Egypt for the second time during the years of anarchy, and had gained
possession one after another of all the towns in the west of the Delta,
from the neighbourhood of Memphis to the town of Qarbina : the Canopic
branch of the Nile now formed the limit of their dominion, and they often
crossed it to devastate the central provinces.^ Nakhtusiti had been unable

to drive them out, and Kamses had not ventured on the task immediately
after his accession. The military institutions of the country had become
totally disorganised after the death of Minephtab, and that part of the com
munity responsible for furnishing the army with recruits had been so
weakened by the late troubles, that they were in a worse condition than before
the first Libyan invasion. The losses they had suffered since Egypt began its
foreign conquests had not been repaired by the introduction of fresh elements,
and the hope of spoil was now insufiScient to induce members of the upper classes
to enter the army. There was no difficulty in filling the ranks from the fellahin,
but the middle class and the aristocracy, accustomed to ease and wealth, no
longer came forward in large numbers, and disdained the military profession.
It was the fashion in the schools to contrast the calling of a scribe with that
of a foot-soldier or a charioteer, and to make as merry over the discomforts
of a military occupation as it had formerly been the fashion to extol its glory
and profitableness. These scholastic exercises represented the future officer
dragged as a child to the barracks, “ the side-lock over his ear.— He is beaten
and his sides are covered with scars,—he is beaten and his two eyebrows
are marked with wounds,—he is beaten and his head is broken by a badly
aimed blow ; — he is stretched on the ground ” for the slightest fault, “ and
blows fall on him as on a papyrus,—and he is broken by the stick.” His
education finished, he is sent away to a distance, to Syria or Ethiopia, and fresh
troubles overtake him. “ His victuals and his supply of water are about his
neck like the burden of an ass,—and his neck and throat suffer like those
of an ass,—so that the joints of his spine are broken. —He drinks putrid
water, keeping perpetual guard the while.” His fatigues soon tell upon his
health and vigour : “ Should he reach the enemy,—he is like a bird which
trembles.—Should he return to Egypt, —he is like a piece of old worm-eaten
wood.— He is sick and must lie down, he is carried on an ass,— while thieves
steal his linen,—-and his slaves escape.”^ The charioteer is not spared
either. He, doubtless, has a moment of vain-glory and of flattered vanity
when he receives, according to regulations, a new chariot and two horses,
with which he drives at a gallop before his parents and his fellow-villagers
but once having joined his regiment, he is perhaps worse off than the foot
soldier. “ He is thrown to the ground among thorns :—a scorpion wounds him
in the foot, and his heel is pierced by its sting.—When his kit is examined,

his misery is at its height.” No sooner has the fact been notified that his
arms are in a had condition, or that some article has disappeared, than “ he is
stretched on the ground—and overpowered with blows from a stick.” ^ This
decline of the warlike spirit in all classes of society had entailed serious modifica
tions in the organisation of both army and navy. The native element no longer
predominated in most battalions and on the majority of vessels, as it had done
under the XVIIP' dynasty ; it still furnished those formidable companies
of archers —the terror of both Africans and Asiatics—and also the most im
portant part, if not the whole, of the chariotry, but the main body of the infantry
was composed almost exclusively of mercenaries, particularly of the Shardana
and the Qahaka. Ramses began his reforms by rebuilding the fleet, which, in a
country like Egypt, was always an artificial creation, liable to fall into decay,
unless a strong and persistent effort were made to keep it in an efficient con
dition. Sliipbuilding had made considerable progress in the last few centuries,
perhaps from the impulse received through Phoenicia, and the vessels turned
out of the dockyards were far superior to those constructed under Hatshopsitu.^
The general outlines of the hull remained the same, but the stem and stern were
finer, and not so high out of the water ; the bow ended, moreover, in a lion’s head
of metal, which rose above the cut-water. A wooden structure running between
the forecastle and quarter-deck protected the rowers during the fight, their
heads alone being exposed. The mast had only one curved yard, to which the
sail was fastened ; this was run up from the deck by halyards when the sailors
wanted to make sail, and thus differed from the Egyptian arrangement, where
the sail was fastened to a fixed upper yard.^ At least half of the crews consisted
of Libyan prisoners, who were branded with a hot iron like cattle, to prevent
desertion ;
^ the remaining half was drawn from the Syrian or Asiatic coast,
or else were natives of Egypt, In order to bring the army into better con
dition, Ramses revived the system of classes, which empowered him to compel
all Egyptians of unmixed race to take personal service, while he hired mer
cenaries from Libya, Phoenicia, Asia Minor, and wherever he could get them,
and divided them into regular regiments, according to their extraction and the

BAMSES III. REORGANISES THE ARMY AND NAVY. 459
arms that they hore4 In the field, the archers always headed the column, to
meet the advance of the foe with their arrows ; they were followed by the
Egyptian lancers—the Shardana and the Tyrseni with their short spears and
heavy bronze swords—while a corps of veterans, armed with heavy maces,
brought up the rear.^ In an engagement, these various troops formed three
lines of infantry disposed one behind the other —the light brigade in front to
engage the adversary, the swordsmen and lancers who were to come into
close quarters with the foe, and the mace-bearers in reserve, ready to advance
on any threatened point, or to await the critical moment when their interven
tion would decide the victory : as in the times of Thutmosis and Ramses II.,
the chariotry covered the two wings.
It was well for Ramses that on ascending the throne he had devoted himself
to the task of recruiting the Egyptian army, and of personally and carefully
superintending the instruction and equipment of his men ; for it was thanks to
these precautions that, when the confederated Libyans attacked the country about
the year of his reign, he was enabled to repulse them with complete success.^
“Didi, Mashaknu, Maraiu, together with Zamaru and Zautmaru, had strongly
urged them to attack Egypt and to carry fire before them from one end of it
to the other.” ^ “ Their warriors confided to each other in their counsels, and
their hearts were full : ‘ We will be drunk ! ’ and their princes said within
their breasts : ‘ We will fill our hearts with violence ! ’ But their plans were
overthrown, thwarted, broken against the heart of the god, and the prayer of
their chief, which their lips repeated, was not granted by the god.” ® They
met the Egyptians at a place called “ Ramsisu-Kliasfi-Timihu ” (“Ramses

WiEOEMAm, Higyptische Gesch., p. 505) ; the word Zamau, which he translates “family ” or “ caste,” signifies “ generations,” i.e. the “ classes ” of the population submitted to the military regulations, as stated on p. 212, note 3, of this volume (cf.

ably led and displayed considerable valour. “ They bleated like goats surprised
by a bull who stamps its foot, who pushes forward its horn and shakes the
mountains, charging whoever seeks to annoy it.” ^ They fled afar, howling
with fear, and many of them, in endeavouring to escape their pursuers,
perished in the canals. “It is, said they, the breaking of our spines which
threatens us in the land of Egypt, and its lord destroys our souls for ever and
ever. Woe be upon them ! for they have seen their dances changed into
carnage, Sokhit is behind them, fear weighs upon them. ‘ VVe march no longer

their soldiers did not even need to measure arms with us in the struggle
Pharaoh alone was our destruction, a fire against us every time that he willed
it, and no sooner did we approach than the flame curled round us, and no water
could quench it on us.’ ” ® The victory was a brilliant one ; the victors counted
12,535 of the enemy killed,^ and many more who surrendered at discretion. The
latter were formed into a brigade, and were distributed throughout the valley of
the Nile in military settlements.® They submitted to their fate with that resig
nation which we know to have been a characteristic of the vanquished at that
date. They regarded their defeat as a judgment from God against which there
was no appeal ; when their fate had been once pronounced, nothing remained to
the condemned except to submit to it humbly, and to accommodate themselves
to the master to whom they were now bound by a decree from on high. The
prisoners of one day became on the next the devoted soldiers of the prince
against whom they had formerly fought resolutely, and they were employed
against their own tribes, their employers having no fear of their deserting to the
other side during the engagement. They were lodged in the barrticks at Thebes,
or in the provinces under the feudal lords and governors of the Pharaoh, and
were encouraged to retain their savage customs and warlike spirit. They inter
married either with the fellahin or wdth women of their own tribes, and were
reinforced at intervals by fresh prisoners or volunteers. Drafted principally into
the Delta and the cities of Middle Egypt, they thus ended by constituting a

resolved to naturalise the Libyans for much the
same purpose. His victory did not bear the
immediate fruits that we might have expected
from his own account of it ; the memory of
the exploits of Eamses II. haunted him, and,
stimulated by the example of his ancestor at
Qodshu,^ he doubtless desired to have the sole
credit of the victory over the Libyans. He cer
tainly did overcome their kings, and arrested their
invasion ; we may go so far as to allow that he
wrested from them the provinces which they had
occupied on the left bank of the Canopic branch,
from Marea to the Natron Lakes, but he did not conquer them, and their
power still remained as formidable as ever. He had gained a respite at
the point of the sword, but he had not delivered Egypt from their future
attacks.
He might perhaps have been tempted to follow up his success and assume
the offensive, had not affairs in Asia at this juncture demanded the whole of his
attention. The movement of great masses of European tribes in a southerly
and easterly direction was beginning to be felt by the inhabitants of the Balkans,
who were forced to set out in a double stream of emigration—one crossing the
Bosphorus and the Propontis towards the centre of Asia Minor, while the other
made for what was later known as Greece Proper, by way of the passes over
Olympus and Pindus. Tlie nations who had hitherto inhabited these regions,
now found themselves thrust forward by the pressure of invading hordes, and
were constrained to move towards the south and east by every avenue
which presented itself It was probably the irruption of the Phrygians into
the high table-land which gave rise to the general exodus of these various

nations^—the Pulasati, the Zakkala, the Shagalasha, the Danauna, and the
tfashasha—some of whom had already made their way into Syria and taken part
in campaigns there, while others had as yet never measured strength with the
Egyptians. The main body of these migrating tribes chose the overland
route, keeping within easy distance of the coast, from Pamphylia as far as the
confines of Naharaim. Tliey were accompanied by their families, who must

in which they travelled. The body of the vehicle was built either of roughly
squared planks, or* else of something resembling wicker-work. The round
axletree was kept in its place by means of a rude pin, and four oxen were
harnessed abreast to the whole structure. The children wore no clothes, and
had, for the most part, their hair tied into a tuft on the top of their heads; the
women affected a closely fitting cap, and were wrapped in large blue or red
garments drawn close to the body.^ The men’s attire varied according to
the tribe to which they belonged. The Pulasati undoubtedly held the chief
place ; they were both soldiers and sailors, and we must recognise in them the
foremost of those tribes known to the Greeks of classical times as the Carians,
who infested the coasts of Asia Minor as well as those of Greece and the
' This idea appears to Iiave been first put forth by Maspero, in the Revue Critique, 1877, vol. i. p. 320 ; W. Max Muller {Asien und Europa, p. 359) believes that the invasion was caused by the famine, during which Minephtah supplied the Kbati with corn (cf. pp. 431, 433 of this volume). The Shagalasha and the Danauna have been already mentioned on p. 360, note 1, and p. 432, note 2, of this volume; I may add, with regard to the latter name, that the texts of Eamses III. sometimes give the simple form Danau (Greene, Fuuilles ii Thebes, pi. ii. 1. 18) in place of the more developed form Danauna. ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from Champollion, Mon. de VEgypte, etc., pi. ccxx., and Kosellini, Monumenti Storici, pi. cxxviii. ® These details are taken from the battle-scenes at Medinet-Habu (Champollion, Mon. de VEgypte, etc., pis. ccxx.-ccxx. his\ Eosellini, Mon.

-.3Egean islands.^ Crete was at this time the seat of a maritime empire, whose
chiefs were perpetually cruising the seas and harassing the civilized states of
the Eastern Mediterranean. These sea-rovers had grown wealthy through piracy,
and contact with the merchants of Syria and Egypt had awakened in them
a taste for a certain luxury and refine
ment, of which we find no traces in the
remains of their civilization anterior to
this period. Some of the symbols in the in
scriptions found on their monuments recall
certain of the Egyptian characters, while
others present an original aspect and seem
to be of ^gean origin. We find in them, ar
ranged in juxtaposition, signs representing
flowers, birds, fish, quadrupeds of various
kinds, members of the human body, and
boats and household implements.^ From the
little which is known of this script we are
inclined to derive it from a similar source to that which has furnished those we
meet with in several parts of Asia Minor and Northern Syria. It would appear
that in ancient times, somewhere in the centre of the Peninsula—but under what
influence or during what period we know not—a syllabary was developed, of
which varieties were handed on from tribe to tribe, spreading on the one side
to the Hittites, Cilicians, and the peoples on the borders of Syria and Egypt, and
on the other to the Trojans, to the people of the Cyclades, and into Crete
* The Pulasati have been connected with the Philistines by Champollion, in his Dietionnaire Hieroqlypliique, and subsequently by the early English Egyptologists (Osbuen, Egypt, her Testimony to the Truth, pp. 107, 137, 141 ; Hincks, Oa the Number, Names and Power, p. 47), who thought they recognised in them the inhabitants of the Shephelah ; cf.

Chabas was the first to identify them with the Pelasgi (Etudes sur I’Antiquite' Hist, 2nd edit., pp. 284-291 ; Eecherches pour servir a I’histoire de VEgypte, pp. 99-101) ; Unger (Manelho, p. 218) and Brugsch (Gesch. Mgyptens, p. 592) prefer to attribute to them a Libyan origin, but the latter finally returns to the Pelasgic and Philistine hypothesis (Troie et I’Egijpte, in Schliemann, Troie, pp. 780, 781). They were without doubt the Philistines, but in their migratory state, before they settled on the coast of Palestine (Maspeeo, in the Revue Critique, 1873, vol. ii. pp. 84, 85, and also Hist, ancienne des peuples des V Orient, 1875; cf.

For the resemblance of their type to that of certain inhabitants still to be found in the neighbourhood of Gaza, cf. the observations made by Htacinthe Hdsson, La Lggende de Samson et les mythes solaires, in the Revue Arch^ologique, 2nd series, vol. xi. pp. 345, 346. * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato ; cf.

and Greeced It is easy to distinguish tlie Pulasati by the felt helmet which
they wore fastened under the chin by two straps and surmounted by a
crest of feathers. The upper part of their bodies was covered by bands of
leather or some thick material, below which hung a simple loin-cloth, while
their feet were bare or shod with short sandals. They carried each a round
buckler with two handles, and the stout bronze sword common to the northern
races, suspended by a cross belt passing over the left shoulder, and were further
armed with two daggers and two javelins. They hurled the latter from a
short distance while attacking, and then drawing their sword or daggers, fell
upon the enemy ; we find among them a few chariots of the Hittite type, each
manned by a driver and two fighting men.^ The Tyrseni appear to have been
the most numerous after the Pulasati, next to whom came the Zakkala. The
latter are thought to have been a branch of the Siculo-Pelasgi whom Greek
tradition represents as scattered at this period among the Cyclades and along
the coast of the Hellespont ; ^ they wore a casque surmounted with plumes like
that of the Pulasati. The Tyrseni may be distinguished by their feathered
head-dress,^ hut the Shagalasha affected a long ample woollen cap falling on the
neck behind, an article of apparel which is still worn by the sailors of the Archi
pelago ; otherwise they were equipped in much the same manner as their allies.
The other members of the confederation, the Shardana, the Danauna, and the
Uashasha, each furnished an inconsiderable contingent, and, taken all together,
formed but a small item of the united force.® Their fleet sailed along the coast
‘ Of. the cunclusious which have led Ramsay (T/je Cities and Bishoprics of Phrygia, p. xy.) to place the origin of the so-called Hittite writing in Asia Minor. Here again I am obliged, for lack of room, to refrain from giving all the reasons which induce me to derive the system of Cretan writing from the central regions of Asia Minor. * These details are taken from the bas-reliefs of Medinet-Habu {Description de VPgypte, A., vol. ii. pi. 8, No. 7 ; Chajipollion, Monuments de VEgyide, etc., pis. ccxx.-ccxx. his, ccxxxi., ccxxxii.

Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 361-367). ^ Tlie Zakkara, or Zakkala, have been identified with the Teucrians by I.auth (Homer und JEgypten, p. 81), Chabas (Recherches sur V Antiquity Historique, 2nd edit., pp. 286-288, and Etudes pour servir a VHistoire sous la XIX'^ Dynastie, pp. 47-49), and by Fr. Lenormaut (Antiquit^s de la Troade, pp. 3739); with the Zygritoe of Libya by Unger (Manetho, p. 218) and by Brugsch (Geschichte ASgyptens, p. 592), who subsequently returned to the Teucrian hypothesis (Troie et VEgypte, in Sculiejiann, Troie, trans. by Egger, pp. 980, 981); W. Max Miiller (Asien und Europa, pp. 362, 363, and 386) regards them as an Asiatic nation probably of the Lydian family. The identification with the SiculoPelasgi of the ZEgean Sea was proposed by Maspero (in the Revue Critique, 1880, vol. i. p. 110). ‘ Their portraits are partially destroyed in the bas-relief at Dledinet-Habu reirresenting their captive chiefs (cf. the group reproduced on p. 471), but W. Max Muller has been able to restore their head-dress with tolerable certainty (Asien und Europa, pp. 380, 381). ^ Chabas jrersisted in recognising in the Uashasha the Opici, Obsci, or Oscans of Roman history (Etude sur rAntiquitC Historique, 2nd edit., pp. 292-294, and Recherches pour servir a VHistoire d’Egypte sous la XX‘ Dynastie, pp. 38, 39), while Brugsch believed them to be the Ossetes of the Caucasus (Geschichte AVgijptens, p. 592), but afterwards came to see in them a ireople of Asia Minor related to the Shardana (Troie et VEgypte, in Sculiejiann, Troie, Egger’s translation, p. 983). The form of the word shows that it is of Asiatic origin, Uasasos, Uassos, which refers us to Caria or Lycia (Maspero, in the Revue Critique, 1878, vol. i. p. 320 ; cf. W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 326, 363, 379).

and kept within sight of the force on land. The squadrons depicted on the
monuments are without doubt those of the two peoples, the Pulasati and Zakkala.
Tlieir ships resembled in many respects those of Egypt, except in the fact that
they had no cut-water. The bow and stern rose up straight like the neck of a
goose or swan ; two structures
for fighting purposes were
erected above the deck, while
a rail running round the sides
of the vessel protected the
bodies of tlie rowers. An
upper yard curved in shape
hung from the single mast,
which terminated in a top
for the look-out during a
battle. The upper yard was
not made to lower, and the
top-men managed the sail
in the same manner as the
Egyptian sailors. The resemblance between this fleet and that of Eamses
is easily explained.^ The dwellers on the .Egean, owing to the knowledge
they had acquired of the Phoenician galleys, which were accustomed to cruise
annually in their waters, became experts in shipbuilding. They copied the
lines of the Phoenician craft, imitated the rigging, and learned to manoeuvre
their vessels so well, both on ordinary occasions and in a battle, that they could
now oppose to the skilled eastern navigators ships as well fitted out and
commanded by captains as experienced as those of Egypt or Asia.
There had been a general movement among all these peoples at the
very time when Eamses was repelling the attack of the Libyans ; “ the isles
had quivered, and had vomited forth their people at once.” ^ They were

subjected to one of those irresistible impulses such as had driven the Shepherds
into Egypt ; or again, in later times, had carried away the Cimmerians and the
Scyths to the pillage of Asia Minor ; “ no country could hold out against their
arms, neither Kh^i, nor Qodi, nor Carchemish, nor Arvad, nor Alasia, without
being brought to nothing.” The ancient kingdoms of Sapalulu and Khatusaru,
already tottering, crumbled to pieces under the shock, and were broken up into
their primitive elements. The barbarians, unable to carry the towns by assault,
and too impatient to resort to a lengthened siege, spread over the valley of the
Orontes, burning and devastating the country everywhere. Having reached
the frontiers of the empire, in the country of the Amorites, they came to a halt,
and constructing an entrenched camp, installed within it their women and the
booty they had acquired.^ Some of their predatory bands, having ravaged the
Bekaa, ended by attacking the subjects of the Pharaoh himself, and their
chiefs dreamed of an invasion of Egypt. Eamses, informed of their design
by the despatches of his officers and vassals, resolved to prevent its accom
plishment. He summoned his troops together, both indigenous and mer
cenary, in his own person looked after their armament and commissariat,
and in the VIIP'‘ year^ of his reign crossed the frontier near Zalu. He
advanced by forced marches to meet the enemy, whom he encountered somewhere
in Southern Syria, on the borders of the Shephelah,^ and after a stubbornly
contested campaign obtained the victory. He carried off from the field, in ad
dition to the treasures of the confederate tribes, some of the cliariots which had
been used for the transport of their families. The survivors made their way hastily
to the north-west, in the direction of the sea, in order to receive the support of

The sequence of facts is illustrated by a series of pictures of which the value was recognised from the first by CiiAiiroLLiON, Lettres Sorites d’Egyple, 2nd edit., pp. 354-358, and afterwards more fully brought out by Kosellini, Mon.

(Lettres dcrites d’Egypte, 2iid edit., p. 329) ; the text really gives the year VIII. (Chabas, Etudes sur VAntiquite', 2nd edit., p. 246). ^ No site is given for these battles. E. de Rouge placed the theatre of war in Syria (Notice de quelques textes, pp. 16, 17), and his opinion was accepfied by Rrugseh (Geogr. Inscr., vol. ii. p. 85; Hist. d’Egypte, 187, 188 ; Gesch, JEgyptens, pr. 592). Chabas referred it to the mouth of the Nile near Relusium (Etudes sur V Antiquite, 2nd edit., pp. 268-283), and his authority has prevailed up to the piresent. The remarks of W. Max Muller (Asien und Europa, ppx 177, 178) have brought me back to the opinion of the earlier Egyptologists ; but I differ from him in looking for the locality further south, and not to the mouth of Nuhr el-Kelb as the site of the naval battle. It seems to me that the fact that the Zakkala were prisoners at Dor, and the Pulasati in the Shepihelab, is enough to assign the campaign to the regions I have mentioned in the text.

occupied himself with lion-hunting en route after the example of the victors of

grass on one occasion on the banks of some river. He rejoined his ships,

commodious space for naval evolutions—possibly the mouth of the Belos, in
the neighbourhood of Magadil. The king drove their foot-soldiers into the
water at the same moment that his admirals attacked the combined fleet of
the Pulasati and Zakkala. Some of the Hlgean galleys were capsized and
sank when the Egyptian vessels rammed them with their sharp stems, and the
crews, in endeavouring to escape to land by swimming, were picked off by the
arrows of the archers of the guard who were commanded by Kamses and his
sons ; they perished in the waves, or only escaped through the compassion of
the victors.^ “ I had fortified,” said the Pharaoh, “ my frontier at Zahi ; I

to be a mighty rampart of galleys, barques, and vessels of all kinds,
equipped from the bow to the stern with valiant armed men. The infantry,
the flower of Egypt, were as lions roaring on the mountains ; the charioteers,
selected from among the most rapid warriors, had for their captains only
officers confident in themselves; the horses quivered in all their limbs, and
were burning to trample the nations underfoot. As for me, I was like the
warlike Month : I stood up before them and they saw the vigour of my
arms. I, King Ramses, I was as a hero who is conscious of his valour, and
who stretches his hands over the people in the day of battle. Those who have
violated my frontier will never more garner harvests from this earth : the
period of their soul has been fixed for ever. My forces were drawn up before
them on the ‘ Very Green,’ a devouring flame approached them at the river
mouth, annihilation embraced them on every side. Those who were on the
strand I laid low on the seashore, slaughtered like victims of the butcher-. I
made their vessels to capsize, and their riches fell into the sea.” ^ Those who
had not fallen in the tight were caught, as it were, in the cast of a net. A
rapid cruiser of the fleet carried the Egyptian standard along the coast as far
as the regions of the Orontes and Saros.^ The land troops, on the other hand,
following on the heels of the defeated enemy, pushed through Coele-Syria, and
in their first burst of zeal succeeded in reaching the plains of the Euphrates. A
century had elapsed since a Pharaoh had planted his standard in this region,
and the country must have seemed as novel to the soldiers of Ramses III. as
to those of his predecessor Thiitmosis. The Khati were still its masters ; and all
enfeebled as tliey were by the ravages of the invading barbarians, were never
theless not slow in preparing to resist their ancient enemies. The majority of
the citadels shut their gates in the face of Ramses, who, wishing to lose no
time, did not attempt to besiege them : he treated their territory with the
usual severity, devastating their open towns, destroying their harvests,
breaking down their fruit trees, and cutting away their forests. He was able,
moreover, without arresting his march, to carry by assault several of their
fortified towns, Alaza among the number, the destruction of which is repre
sented in the scenes of his victories.^ The spoils were considerable, and came
very opportunely to reward the soldiers or to provide funds for the erection
of monuments. The last battalion of troops, however, had hardly recrossed

the isthmus when Lotanu became again its own master, and Egyptian rule was
once more limited to its traditional provinces of Kbaru and Phoenicia. The
King of the Khati appears among the prisoners whom the Pharaoh is repre
sented as bringing to his father Amon ; Carchemish, Tunipa, Khalabu, Katna,
Pabukhu, Arvad, Mitanni, Mannus, Asi, and a score of other famous towns of
this period appear in the list of the subjugated nations, recalling the triumphs
of Thutmosis III. and Amenothes II.^ Kamses did not allow himself to be
deceived into thinking that his success was final. He accepted the protesta
tions of obedience which were spontaneously offered him, but he undertook no
further expedition of importance either to restrain or to provoke his enemies :
the restricted rule which satisfied his exemplar Eamses II. ought, he thought,
to be sufficient for his own ambition.
Egypt breathed freely once more on the announcement of the victory ;
lienceforward she was “ as a bed without anguish.” “ Let each woman now go
to and fro according to her will,” cried the sovereign, in describing the
campaign, “ her ornaments upon her, and directing her steps to any place she
likes ! ” And in order to provide still further guarantees of public security,
he converted his Asiatic captives, as he previously had his African prisoners,
into a bulwark against the barbarians, and a safeguard of the frontier. The
war must, doubtless, have decimated Southern Syria ; and he planted along its
coast what remained of the defeated tribes— the Philistines in the Shephelah,
and the Zakkala on the borders of the great oak forest stretching from Carmel
to Dor.® Watch-towers were erected for the supervision of this region, and for
rallying-points in case of internal revolts or attacks from without. One of these,
the Migdol of Ramses III., was erected, not far from the scene of the decisive
battle, on the spot where the spoils had been divided.^ This living barrier,
*
so to speak, stood between the Nile valley and the dangers which threatened
it from Asia, and it was not long before its value was put to the proof. The

intentions. “ Death fell upon them within Egypt, for they had hastened with

of arrows directed upon them to destroy them, and his sword, cuts like that of
Montfi. Kapur, wko had come to demand homage, blind with fear, threw
down his arras, and his troops did the same. He sent up to heaven a suppliant
cry, and his son [Mashashalu] arrested his foot and his hand ; for, behold, there
rises beside him the god who knows what he has in his heart : His Majesty
falls upon their heads as a mountain of granite and crushes them, the earth
drinks up their blood as if it had been water . . . ; their army was slaughtered,
slaughtered their soldiers,” near a fortress situated on the borders of the desert
called the “Castle of Usirmari-Miamon.” They were seized, “they were
stricken, their arms bound, like geese piled up in the bottom of a boat, under
the feet of His Majesty.” ^ The fugitives were pursued at the sword’s point
from the Castle of Usirmari-Miamon to the Castle of the Sands, a distance of
over thirty miles.^ Two thousand and seventy-five Libyans were left upon the
ground that day, two thousand and fifty-two perished in other engagements,
while two thousand and thirty-two, both male and female, were made prisoners.®
These were almost irreparable losses for a people of necessarily small numbers,
and if we add the number of those who had succumbed in the disaster of six
years before, we can readily realise how discouraged the invaders must have been,
and how little likely they were to try the fortune of war once more. Their power
dwindled and vanished almost as quickly as it had arisen ; the provisional
cohesion given to their forces by a few ambitious chiefs broke up after their
repeated defeats, and the rudiments of an empire which had struck terror into
the Pharaohs, resolved itself into its primitive elements, a number of tribes
scattered over the desert. They were driven back beyond the Libyan moun
tains ; fortresses guarded the routes they had previously followed, and they
were obliged henceforward to renounce any hope of an invasion en masse, and
to content themselves with a few raiding expeditions into the fertile plain of the
Delta, where they had formerly found a transitory halting-place. Counter-raids

of the Divine Lands “ from the innumerable products of Egypt ; and these
products were counted by myriads. Sailing through the great sea of Qodi,
they arrived at Puanit without mishap, and there collected cargoes for their
galleys and ships, consisting of all the unknown marvels of Tonutir, as
well as considerable quantities of the perfumes of Puatin, which they stowed
on board by tens of thousands without number. The sons of the princes of
Tonutir came themselves into Qimit with their tributes. They reached the
region of Coptos safe and sound, and disembarked there in peace with their
riches.” It was somewhere about Sau and Tuau that the merchants and
royal officers landed, following the example of the expeditions of the and
XVIIP' dynasties. Here they organised caravans of asses and slaves, which
taking the shortest route across the mountain—that of the valley of Eahanu
carried the precious commodities to Coptos, whence they were transferred to
boats and distributed along the river. The erection of public buildings,
which had been interrupted since the time of Minephtah, began again with
renewed activity. The captives in the recent victories furnished the requisite
labour, while the mines, the voyages to the Somali coast, and the tributes of
vassals provided the necessary money. Syria was not lost sight of in this
resumption of peaceful occupations. The overthrow of the Khati secured
Egyptian rule in this region, and promised a long tranquillity within its
borders. One temple at least was erected in the country—that at Pa-kanana
where the princes of Kharu were to assemble to offer worship to the Pharaoh,
and to pay each one his quota of the general tribute.^ The Pulasati were
employed to protect the caravan routes, and a vast reservoir was erected
near Aina to provide a store of water for the irrigation of the neighbouring
country.^ The Delta absorbed the greater part of the royal subsidies ; it had
suffered so much from the Libyan incursions, that the majority of the towns
within it had fallen into a condition as miserable as that in which they
were at the time of the expulsion of the Shepherds. Heliopolis,^ Bubastis,^

out in slight relief from a glazed and warm-coloured background, constitute
an immense mosaic-work of many hues. The few remains of the work
show great purity of design and an extraordinary delicacy of tone. All the
knowledge of the Egyptian painters, and all the technical skill of their
artificers in ceramic, must have been employed to compose such harmoniously
balanced decorations, with their free handling of line and colour, and their

once accomplished, uo subsequent attempt was made to construct a second like
it: all the remaining structures of Kamses III, whether at Memphis,^ in the
neighbourhood of Abydos,'^ or at Karnak,^ were in the conventional style of the
Pharaohs. He determined, nevertheless, to give to the exterior of the Mem
nonium, which he built near Medinet-Habu for the worship of himself, the pro
})ortions and appearance of an Asiatic “ Migdol,” influenced probably by his
remembrance of similar structures which he had seen during his Syrian campaign.
The chapel itself is of the ordinary type, with its gigantic pylons, its courts sur
rounded by columns—each supporting a colossal Osirian statue —its hypostyle
hall, and its mysterious cells for the deposit of spoils taken from the peoples of
the sea and the cities of Asia.^ His tomb was concealed at a distant spot in the
Biban-el-Moluk, and we see depicted on its walls the same scenes that we find in
the last resting-place of Seti I. or Kamses II., and in addition to them, in a
series of supplementary chambers, the arms of the sovereign, his standards,
his treasure, his kitchen, and the preparation of offerings which were to be
made to him.® His sarcophagus, cut out of an enormous block of granite, was
brought for sale to Europe at the beginning of this century, and Cambridge ^
obtained possession of its cover, while the Louvre secured the receptacle itself.’
These were years of profound tranquillity. The Pharaoh intended that
absolute order should reign throughout his realm, and that justice should
be dispensed impartially within it. There were to be no more exactions,
no more crying iniquities ; whoever was discovered oppressing the people,
no matter whether he were court official or feudal lord— was instantly de
prived of his functions, and replaced by an administrator of tried integrity.^
Kamses boasts, moreover, in an idyllic manner, of having planted trees
everywhere, and of having built arbours wherein the people might sit in
the shade in the open air; while women might go to and fro where they
would in security, no one daring to insult them on the way. The Shardanian

and Libyan mercenaries were restricted to the castles which they garrisoned,
and were subjected to such a severe discipline that no one had any cause
of complaint against these armed barbarians settled in the heart of Egypt.
“ I have,” continues the king, “ lifted up every miserable one out of his
misfortune, I have granted life to him, I have saved him from the mighty who
were oppressing him, and have secured rest for every one in his own town.” ^
The details of the description are exaggerated, but the general import of it
is true. Egypt had recovered the peace and prosperity of which it had been
deprived for at least half a century, that is, since the death of Minephtah. The
king, however, was not in such a happy condition as his people, and court
intrigues embittered the later years of his life. One of his sons, whose name
is unknown to us, but who is designated in the official records by the nick
name of Pentauirit, formed a conspiracy against him.'^ His mother, Tii, who
was a woman of secondary rank, took it into her head to secure the crown
for him, to the detriment of the children of Queen Isit. An extensive
plot was hatched in which scribes, officers of the guard, priests, and officials
in high place, both natives and foreigners, were involved. A resort to the
supernatural was at first attempted, and the superintendent of the Herds, a
certain Panhuibaunu, who was deeply versed in magic, undertook to cast a
spell upon the Pharaoh, if he could only procure certain conjuring books of
which he was not possessed. These were found to be in the royal library. He
managed to introduce himself under cover of the night into the harem,
where he manufactured certain waxen figures, of which some were to excite
the hate of his wives against their husband, while others would cause him
to waste away and finally perish. A traitor betrayed several of the conspirators,
who, being subjected to the torture, informed upon others, and these at
length brought the matter home to Pentauirit and his immediate accomplices.
All were brought before a commission of twelve members, summoned expressly
to try the case, and the result was the condemnation and execution of six
women and some forty men. The extreme penalty of the Egyptian code was
reserved for Pentauirit, and for the most culpable,—“ they died of themselves,”

of the mummies disinterred at Deir el-Baharid The coffin in which it was
placed was very plain, painted white and without inscription ; the customary
removal of entrails had not been effected, but the body was covered with a
thick layer of natron, which was applied even to the skin itself and secured
by wrappings. It makes one’s flesh creep to look at it : the hands
and feet are tied by strong bands, and are curled up as if under
an intolerable pain ; the abdomen is drawn up, the stomach pro
jects like a ball, the chest is contracted, the head is thrown
back, the face is contorted in a hideous grimace, the retracted lips
expose the teeth, and the mouth is open as if to give utterance
to a last despairing cry. The conviction is borne in upon us that
the man was invested while still alive with the wrappings of
the dead. Is this the mummy of Pentauirit, or of some other
prince as culpable as he was, and condemned to this frightful
punishment ? ^ In order to prevent the recurrence of such wicked
plots. Pharaoh resolved to share his throne with that one of
his sons who had most right to it. In the XXXII“’ ^ year of
his reign he called together his military and civil chiefs, the
generals of the foreign mercenaries, the Shardana, the priests,
and the nobles of the court, and presented to them, according to
custom, his heir-designate, who was also called Ramses. He placed
the double crown upon his brow, and seated him beside him
self upon the throne of Horus. This was an occasion for the
Idiaraoh to bring to remembrance all the great exploits he had
performed during his reign —his triumphs over the Libyans and
over the peoples of the sea, and the riches he had lavished upon the gods
at the end of the enumeration he exhorted those who were present to observe
the same fidelity towards the son which they had observed towards the father,
and to serve the new sovereign as valiantly as they had served himself.®

THE MUiMMY OP RAMSES III.''



THE MUMMY OF RAMSES III. 481
The joint reign lasted for only four years.^ Eamses III. was not much
over sixty years of age when he died. He was still vigorous and muscular,
but he had become stout and heavy. The fatty matter of the body having
been dissolved by the natron in the process of embalming, the skin distended
during life has gathered up into enormous loose folds, especially about the
nape of the neck, under the chin, on the hips, and at the articulations of the
limbs. The closely shaven head and cheeks present no trace of hair or beard.
The forehead, although neither broad nor high, is better proportioned than
that of Eamses II. ; the supra-orbital ridges are less accentuated than his, the
cheek-bones not so prominent, the nose not so arched, and the chin and jaw
less massive. The eyes were perhaps larger, but no opinion can be offered
on this point, for the eyelids have been cut away, and the cleared-out cavities
have been filled with rags. The ears do not stand out so far from the head as
those of Eamses II., but they have been pierced for ear-rings. The mouth,
large by nature, has been still further widened in the process of embalming,
owing to the awkwardness of the operator, who has cut into the cheeks at the
side. The thin lips allow the white and regular teeth to be seen ; the first
molar on the right has been either broken in half, or has worn away more
rapidly than the rest.^ Eamses III. seems, on the whole, to have been a sort of
reduced copy, a little more delicate in make, of Eamses II. ; his face shows
more subtlety of expression and intelligence, though less nobility than that of
the latter, while his figure is not so upright, his shoulders not so broad, and
his general muscular vigour less. What has been said of his personality may
be extended to his reign ; it was evidently and designedly an imitation of the
reign of Eamses II., but fell short of its model owing to the insufficiency of
his resources in men and money. If Eamses III. did not succeed in becoming
one of the most powerful of the Theban Pharaohs, it was not for lack of
energy or ability ; the depressed condition of Egypt at the time limited the
success of his endeavours and caused them to fall short of his intentions.
The work accomplished by him was not on this account less glorious. At
his accession Egypt was in a wretched state, invaded on the west, threatened
by a flood of barbarians on the east, without an army or a fleet, and with no
resources in the treasury. In fifteen years he had disposed of his inconvenient
neighbours, organised an army, constructed a fleet, re-established his authority

abroad, and settled the administration at home on so firm a basis, that the
country owed the peace which it enjoyed for several centuries to the institu
tions and prestige which he had given it. His associate in the government,
llamses lY., barely survived him. Then followed a series of rois faineants
bearing the name of Ramses, but in an order not yet clearly determined. It
is generally assumed that Ramses V., brother of Ramses III., succeeded
Ramses IV. by supplanting his nephews—who, however, appear to have soon
re-established their claim to the throne, and to have followed each other in
rapid succession as Ramses VI., Ramses VII., Ramses VIII., and Maritumu.^
Others endeavour to make out that Ramses V. was the son of Ramses IV., and
that the prince called Ramses VI. never succeeded to the throne at all. At
any rate, his son, who is styled Ramses VII., but who is asserted by some to
have been a son of Ramses III., is considered to have succeeded Ramses V.,
and to have become the ancestor from whom the later Ramessides traced their
descent.^ The short reigns of these Pharaohs were marked by no events which
would cast lustre on their names ; one might say that they had nothing else
to do than to enjoy peacefully the riches accumulated by their forefather.®
Ramses IV. was anxious to profit by the commercial relations which had been
again established between Egypt and Puanit, and, in order to facilitate the transit
between Coptos and Kosseir, founded a station, and a temple dedicated to Isis,
in the mountain of Bakhni ; by this route, we learn, more than eight thousand
men had passed under the auspices of the high priest of Amon, Nakhtu-ramses.'^
This is the only undertaking of public utility which we can attribute to any of
these kings. As we see them in their statues and portraits, they are heavy and
squat and without refinement, with protruding eyes, thick lips, flattened and
commonplace noses, round and expressionless faces. Their work was confined
to the engraving of their cartouches on the blank spaces of the temples at
Karnak and JMedinet-Habu, and the addition of a few stones to the buildings
at Memphis, Abydos, and Heliopolis. Whatever energy and means they
' The order of the Kamessides was first made out by Champollion the younger (cf. ChampollionFigeac, L'Egypte Ancienne, pp. 355, 35C) and by Rosellini (Mon. Storici, vol. ii. p. 59, and vol. iv. pp. 135, 130). Bunsen (ASgyptens Stellung, vol. iii. pp. 119, 120) and Im-psius (Konigsbuch, pis. xxxviii.-xli.) reckon in it thirteen kings ; E. de Rouge' puts the number at fifteen or sixteen (Etude sur une Stele de la Bill. Imp€rmle, pp. 181, 193, 191); Maspero makes the number to be twelve (Les Monties royales, etc., in the Me'moires de la Mission Eranyaise, vol. i. p. 602), which was reduced still further by Sethe (TJntersuchungen zur Geschichte yEgyptens, pp. 59-01). Erman thinks that Ramses IX. and Ramses X. were also possibly sons of Ramses III. (Die Suhne Ramses III., in the Zeitschrift, 1883, pp. 00, 61); he
consequently declines to recognise King Maritumu as a son of that sovereign, as Brugsch would make
out (Geschichte Higyptens, p. 025).
2 This is the position ably maintained by Sethe, Entersuclmngen zur Geschichte AEgyptens, pp. 59
01. The monuments of these later Ramessides are so rare and so doubtful that I cannot yet see my way to a solution of the questions which they raise.
’ For the probable duration of their reigns, which coincide with the lives of two high priests of Amon, see Maspero, Momies royales, in the Memoires, etc., vol. i. pp. 663-006. Eepsius, Den/fm. iii. 219 e; cf. Brugsch, Geschichte Algyptens, pp. 620-623.

possessed were expended on the construction of their magnificent tombs.
These may still be seen in the Biban el-Moluk, and no visitor can refrain from
admiring them for their magnitude and decoration. As to funerary chapels,
owing to the shortness of the reigns of
these kings, there was not time to construct
them, and they therefore made up for this
want by appropriating the chapel of their
father, which was at Medinet-Habu, and it
was here consequently that their worship
was maintained.^ The last of the sons
of Ramses III. was succeeded by another
and equally ephemeral Ramses ; after
whom came Ramses X. and Ramses XI.,
who re-established the tradition of more
lasting reigns. There was now no need
of expeditions against Rharu or Libya,
for these enfeebled countries no longer
disputed, from the force of custom, the
authority of Egypt. From time to time
an embassy from these countries would
arrive at Thebes, bringing presents, which
were pompously recorded as representing
so much tribute.^ If it is true that a
people which has no history is happy,
then Egypt ought to be reckoned as
more fortunate under the feebler descendants of Ramses III. tlian it had ever
been under the most famous Pharaohs.
Thebes continued to be the favourite royal residence. Here in its temple
the kings were crowned, and in its palaces they passed the greater part of
their lives, and here in its valley of sepulchres they were laid to rest when
their reigns and lives were ended. The small city of the beginning of the

(Champollion-Pigeac, Egypte Ancienne, p. 348), but which Lepsius rightly referred to that of Eamses IV.

484 THE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
XVIIP' dynasty had long encroached upon the plain, and was now trans
formed into an immense town, with magnificent monuments, and a motley
population, having absorbed in its extension the villages of Ashiru,^ and
Madit, and even thel southern Apit, which we now call Luxor. But their
walls could still be seen, rising up in the middle of modern constructions,
a memorial of the heroic ages, when the power of the Theban princes was
trembling in the balance, and when conflicts with the neighbouring barons
or with the legitimate king were on the point of breaking out at every
moment.^ The inhabitants of Apit retained their walls, which coincided
almost exactly with the boundary of Nsittaui, the great sanctuary of Amon
Ashiru sheltered behind its ramparts the temple of Mut, while Apit-risit
clustered around a building consecrated by Amenothes III. to his divine
father, the lord of Thebes. Within the boundary walls of Thebes extended
whole suburbs, more or less densely populated and prosperous, through
which ran avenues of sphinxes connecting together the three chief boroughs
of which the sovereign city was composed.^ On every side might have
been seen the same collections of low grey huts, separated from each other
by some muddy pool where the cattle were wont to drink and the women
to draw water; long streets lined with high houses, irregularly shaped open
spaces, bazaars, gardens, courtyards, and shabby-looking palaces which,
while presenting a plain and unadorned exterior, contained within them the
refinements of luxury and the comforts of wealth.^ The population did not
exceed a hundred thousand souls,® reckoning a large proportion of foreigners
attracted hither by commerce or held as slaves. The court of the Pharaoh
drew to the city numerous provincials, who, coming thither to seek their
fortune, took up their abode there, planting in the capital of Southern Egypt
types from the north and the centre of the country, as well as from Nubia and
the Oases ; such a continuous infusion of foreign material into the ancient
’ Upon tills extension of Thebes, see pp. 305, 306 of the present work. The village of Ashirii was situated to the south of the temple of Kaniak, close to the temple of Mht (Champollion, Monuments. etc., vol. ii. p. 262 ; Bbugsch, Diet, giog., pp. 73-75). Its ruins, containing the statues of Sokhit
collected by Amenothes III. (see p. 306 of the present work), extend around the remains marked X
in Mariette’s plan {Kurnalt, pi. B ; cf. Buugsch-Revillout, Donnies gebgraphiques et topographiques sur Thebes, in the Revue Egyptologique, vol. i. p. 180). ^ These are the walls which are generally regarded as marking the sacred enclosure of the temples : an examination of the ruins of Thebes shows us that, during the XX*'’ and XXI*' dynasties, brickbuilt houses lay against these walls botli on the inner and outer sides, so that they must have been half hidden by buildings, as are the ancient walls of Paris at the present day. ^ For the period during which these avenues were constructed, see pp. 308, 309 of the present work. ' The only researches, as far as I know, which have been carried out in these ruins are those of Maspero, Etudes de Mythologie et d' Arche'ologie Egyptiennes, vol. i. pp. 184-190. ® Letronne, after having shown that we have no authentic ancient document giving us the population, fixes it at 200,000 souls (QHuvres choisies, ed. Fagnan, pt. 1, vol. i. pp. 126-136). My estimate, which is, if anything, exaggerated, is based on the comparison of the area of ancient Thebes and that of such modern towns as Si^t, Girgeh, and Qina, whose populations are known for the last fifty years from the census.



TEEBES AND ITS PEOPLE. 485
Theban stock gave rise to families of a highly mixed character, in which
all the various races of Egypt were blended in the most capricious fashion.
In every twenty officers, and in the same number of ordinary officials,
about half would be either Syrians,^ or recently naturalised Nubians, or the
descendants of both, and among the ciiizens such names as Pakhari the Syrian,
Palamnani the native of the Lebanon, Pinahsi the negro, Palasiai the Alasian,
preserved the indications of foreign origin.^ A similar mixture of races was
found in other cities, and Memphis, Bubastis, Tanis, and Siut must have
presented as striking an aspect in this respect as Thebes.® At Memphis
’ See p. 438 of the present volume as to Ben-Azana of the town of Zor-Bisana, and p. 440 as to Arisu, the Syrian, who was for a short time King of Egypt. 2 Among the forty-three individuals compromised in the conspiracy against Ramses III. (see pp. 479, 480 of the present work) whose names have been examined by De'veria (Le Papyrus Judiciaire de Turin, etc., pp. 138-162), nine are foreigners, chiefly Semites, and were so recognised by the Egyptians
themselves—Adiram(p. 139), Balmahara (p. 141), Garapusa (p. 144), lunini the Libyan (pp. 144, 157, 158), Paiarisalama, possibly the Jerusalemite (pp. 144, 148, 149), Nanaiu, possibly the Ninevite (pp. 146, 147), Paluka the Lycian (pp. 152, 153), Qadendena (p. 156), and Uarana or Uaramu (pp. 160, 161). In regard to Kharui, Pakhari, see W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, p. 240 ; and for Palasiai, see Wiedemann, Stela at Freiburg in Baden, in the Proceedings Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1890-91, vol. xiii. pp. 31, 32; and Lieblein, Dictionnaire des noms propres. No. 888, p. 286. As to the part played by foreigners in Egypt and their number, see Brugsch, Geschichte AUgyptens, p. 197, et seq., and Eeman, AUgypten und ASgyptisclies Lehen, pp. 156, 1.57, 683, 684. ® An examination of the stelse of Abydos, published by Mariette in his Catalogue General, shows the extent of foreign influence in this city in the middle of the XVIIP** dynasty.



486 THE CLOSE OF TEE THEBAN EMPIRE.
there were regular colonies of Phoenician, Canaanite, and Amorite merchants
sufficiently prosperous to have temples there to their national gods, and
influential enough to gain adherents to their religion from the indigenous
inhabitants. They worshipped Baal, Aniti, Baal-Zaphuna, and Ashtoreth, side
by side with Phtah, Noflrtumu, and Sokhit,^ and this condition of things at
Memphis was possibly paralleled elsewhere—as at Tanis and Bubastis. This
blending of races was probably not so extensive in the country districts,
except in places where mercenaries were employed as garrisons ; but Sudanese
or Hittite slaves, brought back by the soldiers of the ranks, had introduced
Ethiopian and Asiatic elements into many a family of the fellahin.^ We have
only to examine in any of our museums the statues of the Memphite and
Theban periods respectively, to see the contrast between the individuals repre
sented in them as far as regards stature and appearance. Some members of
the courts of the Eamessides stand out as genuine Semites notwithstanding the
disguise of their Egyptian names ; and in the times of Kheops and Usirtasen
they would have been regarded as barbarians. Many of them exhibit on their
faces a blending of the distinctive features of one or other of the predominant
Oriental races of the time. Additional evidence of a mixture of races is forth
coming when we examine with an unbiased mind the mummies of the period,
and the complexity of the new elements introduced among the people by the
political movements of the later centuries is thus strongly confirmed. The
new-comers had all been absorbed and assimilated by the country, but the
generations which arose from this continual cross-breeding, while representing
externally the Egyptians of older epochs, in manners, language, and religion,
were at bottom something different, and the difference became the more
accentuated as the foreign elements increased. The people were thus
gradually divested of the character which had distinguished them before the
conquest of Syria ; the dispositions and defects imported from without counter
acted to such an extent their own native dispositions and defects that all
marks of individuality were effaced and nullified. The race tended to become
more and more what it long continued to be afterwards,—a lifeless and inert
mass, without individual energy —endowed, it is true, with patience, endurance,
cheerfulness of temperament, and good nature, but with little power of self
* These gods are mentioned in the preamble of a letter written on the verso of the Sallier Papyrus, No. iv. pi. i. 1. 6; they were first noticed by Goodwin (Rotes, in the Zeitschrift, 1873, p. 14). From the mode in which they are introduced we may rightly infer that they had, like the Egyptian gods who are mentioned wdth them, their chapels at Memphis. As to the other Semitic gods and god
desses worshijiiied in Egypt, see pp. 154, 159 of the present work. A place in Memphis is called “the district called the district of the Khatifi” in an inscription of the III'''* year of Ai (Daressy, Notes, etc., § cxiii., in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xvi. p. 123), and shows that Hittites were there by the side of Canaanites. ** One of the letters in the Great Bologna Papyrus treats of a Syrian slave, employed as a cultivator at Hermopolis, who had run away from his master (On abas, MAanges Egyptologiques, 3rd series, vol. i. pp. 232, 233).

government, and thus forced to submit to foreign masters who made use of
it and oppressed it without pity.
The upper classes had degenerated as much as the masses. The feudal
nobles who had expelled the Shepherds, and carried the frontiers of the empire
to the banks of the Euphrates, seemed to have expended their energies in the
effort, and to have almost ceased to exist. As long as Egypt was restricted to
the Nile valley, there was no such disproportion between the power of the
Pharaoh and that of his feudatories as to prevent the latter from maintaining
their privileges beside, and, when occasion arose, even against the monarch.
The conquest of Asia, while it compelled them either to take up arms them
selves or to send their troops to a distance, accustomed them and their
soldiers to a passive obedience. The maintenance of a strict discipline in the
army was the first condition of successful campaigning at great distances from
the mother country and in the midst of hostile people, and the unquestioning
respect which they had to pay to the orders of their general prepared them for
abject submission to the will of their sovereign. To their bravery, moreover,
they owed not only money and slaves, but also necklaces and bracelets of
honour, and distinctions and offices in the Pharaonic administration. The
king, in addition, neglected no opportunity for securing their devotion to him
self. He gave to them in marriage his sisters, his daughters, his cousins, and
any of the princesses whom he was not compelled by law to make his own wives.
He selected from their harems nursing-mothers for his own sons, and this
choice established between him and them a foster relationship, which was as
binding among the Egyptians and other Oriental peoples as one of blood.
It was not even necessary for the establishment of this relation that the foster
mother’s connexion with the Pharaoh’s son should be durable or even effective :
the woman had only to offer her breast to the child for a moment, and this
symbol was quite enough to make her his nurse —his true monciit. This
fictitious fosterage was carried so far, that it was even made use of in the case
of youths and persons of mature age. When an Egyptian woman wished to
adopt an adult, the law prescribed that she should offer him the breast, and
from that moment he became her son. A similar ceremony was prescribed in
the case of men who wished to assume the quality of male nurse mondi—or
even, indeed, of female nurse mondU—like that of their wives ; according to
which they were to place, it would seem, the end of one of their fingers in the
mouth of the child.^ Once this affinity was established, the fidelity of these
feudal lords was established beyond question ; and their official duties to the

488 THE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
sovereign were not considered as accomplished when they had fulfilled their
military obligations, for they continued to serve him in the palace as they
had served him on the field. Wherever the necessities of the government
called them—at Memphis, at Eamses, or elsewhere—they assembled around
the Pharaoh ; like him they had their palaces at Thebes, and when they
died they were anxious to be buried there beside him.^ Many of the old
houses had become extinct, while others, owing to marriages, were absorbed
into the royal family ; the fiefs conceded to the relations or favourites of the
Pharaoh continued to exist, indeed, as of old, but the ancient distrustful and
turbulent feudality had given place to an aristocracy of courtiers, who lived
oftener in attendance on the monarch than on their own estates, and whose
authority continued to diminish to the profit of the absolute rule of the king.
There would be nothing astonishing in the “count” becoming nothing more
than a governor, hereditary or otherwise, in Thebes itself ; he could hardly be
anything higher in the capital of the empire.^ But the same restriction of
authority was evidenced in all the provinces : the recruiting of soldiers, the
receipt of taxes, most of the offices associated with the civil or military
administration, became more and more affairs of the State, and passed from the
hands of the feudal lord into those of the functionaries of the Crown. The
few barons who still lived on their estates, while they were thus dispossessed
of the greater part of their prerogatives, obtained some compensation, on the
other hand, on the side of religion. From early times they had been by birth
the heads of the local cults, and their protocol had contained, together with those
titles which justified their possession of the temporalities of the nome, others
which attributed to them spiritual supremacy. The sacred character with which
they were invested became more and more prominent in proportion as their poli
tical influence became curtailed, and we find scions of the old warlike families or
representatives of a new lineage at Thinis, at Akhmim,^ in the nome of Baalu,"*

I have remarked in tombs not yet made public the mention of princes of El-Kab, who played an important part about the person of tlie Pharaohs down to the beginning of the XX‘'' dynasty. “ Kakhmiri and his son Manakhpirsonbu were both “counts” of Thebes under Thhtmosis III. (ViKEY, Le Tombeau de Behlimara, iu the Meinoires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. v. pp. 1-3, and Le Tombeau de Eamenlchepersenb, jj. 197, et seq.), and there is nothing to show that there was any other person among them invested with the same functions and belonging to a different family. ^ See, for example, the tomb of Anhhrimosu, high priest of Anhuri-Shh and prince of Thinis, under Minephtah (Mauiette-Maspero, Monuments divers, pp. 26, 27, and jr!. 78), where the sacerdotal character is almost exclusively prominent. The same is the case with the tombs of the princes of Akhmim in the time of Khtrniatonu and his successors: the few still existing in 1884-5 have not been published. The stelso belonging to them are at Paris and Berlin. * Griffith, The Inscriptions of Siut and Der-Rifeh, pis. 18, 10, where, iu the tomb of Priuce Nana, the religious features of the inscriptions eclipse the military ones.

at Hieraconpolis,^ at El-Kab/ and in every place where we have information
from the monuments as to their position, bestowing more concern upon
their sacerdotal than on their other duties. This transfiguration of the
functions of the barons, which had been completed under the and XX’^*^
dynasties, corresponded with a more general movement by which the Pharaohs
themselves were driven to accentuate their official position as high priests, and
to assign to their sons sacerdotal functions in relation to the principal deities.
This rekindling of religious fervour would not, doubtless, have restrained
military zeal in case of war ;
^ but if it did not tend to suppress entirely in
dividual bravery, it discouraged the taste for arms and for the bold adventures
which had characterised the old feudality. The duties of sacrificing, of offering
prayer, of celebrating the sacred rites according to the prescribed forms,
and rendering due homage to the gods in the manner they demanded, were
of such an exactingly scrupulous and complex character that the Pharaohs
and the lords of earlier times had to assign them to men specially fitted for,
and appointed to, the task ;
^ now that they had assumed these absorbing func
tions themselves, they were obliged to delegate to others an increasingly greater
proportion of their civil and military duties. Thus, while the king and his
great vassals were devoutly occupying themselves in matters of worship and
theology, generals by profession were relieving them of the care of command
ing their armies; and as these individuals were frequently the chiefs of
Ethiopian, Asiatic, and especially of Libyan bands, military authority, and,
with it, predominant influence in the State were quickly passing into the
hands of the barbarians. A sort of aristocracy of veterans, notably of Shardana
or Mashauasha, entirely devoted to arms, grew up and increased gradually
side by side with the ancient noble families, now by preference devoted to
the priesthood.®
The barons, whether of ancient or modern lineage, were possessed of
immense wealth, especially those of priestly families. The tribute and spoil
of Asia and Africa, when once it had reached Egypt, hardly ever left it
* Horimosa, Prince of HieraoonpolLs under Thutmosis III., is, above everything else, a prophet of the local Horus (Bouriant, Les Tomheaux d'Eierdconpolis, in the Etudes Archeblogiques, etc., dAdiees a M. le D’’ Leemans, pp. 39, 40). “ The princes of EL-Kab during the XIX^** and XX“‘ dynasties were, before everything, priests of Nekhabit, as appears from an examination of their tombs, which, lying in a side valley, far away from the tomb of Pihiri, are rarely visited. ® The sons of Eamses II,, Khamoioit and Maritumu, were brave warriors in spite of their being high priests of Phtah at Memphis, and of Ra at Heliopolis. With respect to Khamoitit, see pp. 424, 425 of the present work ; and in regard to Marithmh, see Ersian, Ausfuhrliches Verzeichniss der
.Fgyptischen AlUrlumer, 1894, p. 92, No. 7347. We shall see later on how the high jrriests of Amon, Hrihor, Pionkhi, Painozmu, took the title of commander-in-ohief. * For further information upon these “ men of the roll,” see Dawn of Civilization, pp. 124-127.
= This military aristocracy was fully developed in the XXP* and XXIP’'^ dynasties, but it began to take shape after Eamses III. had planted the Shardana and Qahaka in certain towns as garrisons; see on this subject, pp. 472-474, 479 of the present work.



490 TEE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
they were distributed among the population in proportion to the position occu
pied by the recipients in the social scale. The commanders of the troops, the
attendants on the king, the administrators of the palace and temples, absorbed
the greater part, but the distribution was carried down to the private soldier
and his relations in town or country, who received some of the crumbs.^
When we remember for a moment the four centuries and more durins: which
Egypt had been reaping the fruits of her foreign conquest, we cannot think
without amazement of the quantities of gold and other precious metals which
must have been brought in divers forms into the valley of the Nile.^ Every
fresh expedition made additions to these riches, and one is at a loss to know
whence in the intervals between two defeats the conquered could procure so much
wealth, and why the sources were never exhausted nor became impoverished.
This flow of metals had an influence upon commercial transactions, for although
trade was still mainly carried on by barter, the mode of operation was becoming
changed appreciably. In exchanging commodities, frequent use was now
made of rings and ingots of a certain prescribed weight in tabonh ; and it
became more and more the custom to pay for goods by a certain number of
tahoml of gold, silver, or copper, rather than by other commodities : it was
the practice even to note down in invoices or in the official receipts, alongside
the products or manufactured articles with which payments were made, the
value of the same in weighed metal.^ This custom, although not yet widely
extended, placed at the disposal of trade enormous masses of metal, which were
preserved in the form of ingots or bricks, except the portion which went to the
manufacture of rings, jewellery, or valuable vessels.^ The general prosperity
' See, on pp. 80, 87, 88 of this work, the notices of the quantity of spoils received by the two oflicers of suliordinate rank, both called Ahmosis of El-Kab. On one occasion there is (pp. 90, 91) the distribution of booty to the whole crew of a ship who had distinguished themselves brilliantly. ^ The quantity of gold in ingots or rings, mentioned in the Annals of Tliutmosis III., represents altogether a weight of nearly a ton and a quarter, or in value some £140,000 of our money. And this is far from being the whole of the metal obtained! from the enemy, for a large portion of the inscription has disappeared, and the unrecorded amount might be taken, without much risk of error, at as
much as that of which we have evidence —say, some two and a half tons, which Thtitmosis had
received or brought back between the years XXIII. and XLII. of his reign—an estimation rather under than over the reality. These figures, moreover, take no account of the vessels and statues, or of the furniture and arms plated with gold. Silver was not received in such large quantities, but it was of great value, and the like may be said of copper and lead. * The facts juslifying this position were observed and put together for the first time by Chabas, Itecherches sur les poids, etc., des Anciens Egyptiens, pp. 15-46 : a translation is given in this memoir of a register of the XX*'' or XXP* dynasty (Mariette, Les Papyrus Egyptiens du Musee de Boulaq, vol. ii. pis. iii., iv.), which gives the price of butcher’s meat, both in gold and silver, at this date. Fresh examples have been since collected by Spiegelberg, who has succeeded in drawing up a kind of tariff for the period between the XVIII"' and XX*** dynasties (Eechnungen aus der Zeit Seti's I., Test, pp. 87-93). ' There are depicted on the monuments bags or heaps of gold dust, ingots in the shape of bricks, rings, and vases, arranged alongside each other : to cite only one example, see the Treasure scenes at Medinet-llabu (Chasipollion, Monuments de I’Egypte, vol. i. pp. 365, 367 ; Dumichen, Historisclie Lisahriften, vol. i. pis. xxx.-xxxiv., and Besultate, vol. i. pis. xxviii., xxix., and pp. 22, 23), which reminded many Egyptologists of the legend of Ehampsinitos.



EICHNESS IN THE PRECIOUS METALS; GOLDSMITHS' WORK. 491
encouraged a passion for goldsmiths’ work, and the use of bracelets, necklaces,
and chains became common among classes of the people who were not pre
viously accustomed to wear themd There was henceforward no scribe or
merchant, however poor he might be, who had not his seal made of gold or
silver, or at any rate of copper gilt. The stone was sometimes fixed, but
frequently arranged so as to turn round on a pivot ; while among people of
superior rank it had some emblem or device upon it, such as a scorpion, a
sparrow-hawk, a lion, or a cynocephalous monkey. Chains occupied the same
position among the ornaments of Egyptian women as rings among men ; they
were indispensable decorations. Examples of silver chains are known of some
five feet in length, while others do not exceed two to three inches. There
are specimens in gold of all sizes, single, double, and triple, with large or
small links, some thick and heavy, while others are as slight and flexible as
the finest Venetian lace. The poorest peasant woman, alike with the lady of
the court, could boast of the possession of a chain, and she must have been
in dire poverty who had not some other ornament in her jewel-case. The
jewellery of Queen Ahhotpu shows to what degree of excellence the work of the
Egyptian goldsmiths had attained at the time of the expulsion of the Hyksos
they had not only preserved the good traditions of the best workmen of
the XII“* dynasty, but they had perfected the technical details, and had
learned to combine form and colour with a greater skill.^ The pectorals of
Prince Khamoisit and the Lord Psaru, now in the Louvre, but which were
originally placed in the tomb of the Apis in the time of Ramses II.,^ are
splendid examples. The most common form of these represents in miniature
the front of a temple with a moulded or flat border, surmounted by a curved
cornice. In one of them, which was doubtless a present from the king himself,
the cartouche, containing the first name of the Pharaoh-Usirmari, appears just
below the frieze, and serves as a centre for the design within the frame. The
wings of the ram-headed sparrow-hawk, the emblem of Amonra, are so dis
played as to support it, while a large urseus and a vulture beneath embracing
both the sparrow-hawk and the cartouche with outspread wings give the idea
of divine protection. Two didu, each of them filling one of the lower corners,
symbolise duration. The framework of the design is made up of divisions

marked out in gold, and filled either with coloured enamels or pieces of polished
stone. The general effect is one of elegance, refinement, and harmony, the
three principal elements of the design becoming enlarged from the top down
wards in a deftly adjusted gradation. The dead-gold of the cartouche in the
upper centre is set off below by the brightly variegated and slightly undulating
band of colours of the sparrow-hawk,
while the urseus and vulture, associated
together with one pair of wings, envelope
the upper portions in a half-circle of
enamels, of which the shades pass from
red through green to a dull blue, with
a freedom of handling and a skill in the
manipulation of colour which do honour
to the artist. It was not his fault if
there is still an element of stiffness in
the appearance of the pectoral as a whole,
for the form which religious tradition
had imposed upon the jewel was so rigid
that no artifice could completely get over this defect. It is a type which
arose out of the same mental concepts as had given birth to Egyptian
architecture and sculpture—monumental in character, and appearing often as
if designed for colossal rather than ordinary being.s. The dimensions, too
overpowering for the decoration of normal men or women, would find an
appropriate place only on the breasts of gigantic statues : the enormous
size of the stone figures to which alone they are adapted would relieve
them, and show them in their proper proportions. The artists of the second
Theban empire tried all they could, however, to get rid of the square frame
work in which the sacred bird is enclosed, and we find examples among
the pectorals in the Louvre of the sparrow-hawk only with curved wings,^
or of the ram-headed hawk with the wings extended ; but in both of them
there is displayed the same brilliancy, the same purity of line, as in the
square-shaped jewels, while the design, freed from the trammels of the
hampering enamelled frame, takes on a more graceful form, and becomes
more suitable for personal decoration. The ram’s head in the second case
excels in the beauty of its workmanship anything to be found elsewhere in

It is of the finest gold, hut its
value does not depend upon the
precious material : the ancient
engraver knew how to model it
' with a bold and free hand, and he has managed
to invest it with as much dignity as if he had
been carving his subject in heroic size out of
a block of granite or limestone. It is not an
example of pure industrial art, but of an art
for which a designation is lacking. Other examples, although more carefully
executed and of more costly materials, do not approach it in value : such,
for instance, are the ear-rings of Ramses XII. at G-izeh, which are made
up of an ostentatious combination of disks, filigree-work, chains,
beads, and hanging figures of the urseus.^
To get an idea of the character of the plate on the royal side
boards, we must have recourse to the sculptures in the
temples, or to the paintings on the tombs ; the engraved
gold or silver centrepieces, dishes, bowls, cups, and
amphorae, if valued by weight only, were too precious to
escape the avarice of the impoverished generations which
followed the era of Theban prosperity.^ In the fabrication of
these we can trace foreign influences, but not to the extent
of a predominance over native art : even if the subject to be
dealt with by the artist happened to be a Phoenician god or an Asiatic prisoner,
he was not content with slavishly copying his model ; he translated it and
interpreted it, so as to give it an Egyptian character.
The household furniture was in keeping with these precious objects. Beds
and armchairs in valuable woods, inlaid with ivory, carved, gilt, painted in
subdued and bright colours, upholstered with mattresses and cushions of many
hued Asiatic stuffs, or of home-made materials, fashioned after Chaldsean
patterns,® were in use among the well-to-do, while people of moderate means

had to be content with old-fashioned furniture of the ancient regime. The
Theban dwelling-house was indeed more sumptuously furnished than the
earliest Memphite, but we find the same general arrangements in both,
which provided, in addition to quarters for the masters, a similar number of
rooms intended for the slaves, for granaries, storehouses, and stables.^ While
the outward decoration of life was subject to change, the inward element
remained unaltered. Costume was a more complex matter
than in former times : the dresses and lower garments were
more gauffered, had more embroidery and stripes ; the wigs
were larger and longer, and rose up in capricious arrange
ments of curls and plaits.^ The use of the chariot had now
become a matter of daily custom, and the number of domestics,
already formidable, was increased by fresh additions in the
shape of coachmen, grooms, and saises, who ran before their
master to clear a way for the horses through the crowded
streets of the city.^ As material existence became more
complex, intellectual life partook of the same movement, and,
without deviating much from the lines prescribed for it by
the learned and the scribes of the Memphite age, literature had become in
the mean time larger, more complicated, more exacting, and more difficult to
grapple with and to master. It had its classical authors, whose writings were
committed to memory and taught in the schools. These were truly masterpieces,
for if some felt that they understood and enjoyed them, others found them almost
beyond their comprehension, and complained bitterly of their obscurity.® The
later writers followed them pretty closely, in taking pains, on the one hand,
to express fresh ideas in the forms consecrated by approved and ancient
usage, or when they failed to find adequate vehicles to convey new thoughts,

appearance of originality into their writings, had no influence upon their
method of composition. Their poetical ideal remained what it had been in
the time of their ancestors, but seeing that we are now unable to determine
the characteristic cadence of sentences or the mental attitude which marked
each generation of literary men, it is often difficult for us to find out the
qualities in their writings which gave them popularity, A complete library
of one of the learned in the Ramesside period must have contained a strange
mixture of works, embracing, in addition to books of devotion, which were in
dispensable to those who were solicitous about their souls,^ collections of hymns,
romances, war and love songs, moral and philosophical treatises, letters, and legal
documents. It Avould have been similar in character to the literary possessions
of an Egyptian of the Memphite period,^ but the language in which it was written
would not have been so stiff and dry, but would have flowed more easily, and
been more sustained and better balanced. The great odes to the deities which
we find in the Theban impjri are better fitted, perhaps, than the profane com
positions of the period, to give us an idea of the advance which Egyptian genius
had made in the width and richness of its modes of expression, while still main
taining almost the same dead-level of ideas which had characterised it from
the outset. Among these, one dedicated to Harmakhis, the sovereign sun, is no
longer restricted to a bare enumeration of the acts and virtues of the “Disk,”
but ventures to treat of his daily course and his final triumphs in terms which
might have been used in describing the victorious campaigns or the apotheosis
of a Pharaoh.^ It begins with his awakening, at the moment when he has torn
himself away from the embraces of night. Standing upright in the cabin of
the divine bark, “ the fair boat of millions of years,” with the coils of the serpent
IMihni around him, he glides in silence on the eternal current of the celestial
waters, guided and protected by those battalions of secondary deities with whose
Texten, 1886. It appears not to have been noticed that several of these words betray an Aramssan origin from the XVIII*'' dynasty onwards. ’ There are found in the rubrics of many religious books, for example that dealing with the unseen world (Maspeeo, Etudes de Mytliologie, etc. , vol. ii. pp. 54-57), promises of liealth and prosperity to the
soul which, “ 'while still on earth,” had read and learned them. A similar formula appears at the end of several important chapters of the Booh of the Dead (Guieysse, Bit. Fun^r. Egyptien, eh. 64, pp. 58, 59). ^ See Dawn of Civilization, pp. 398-401. The composition of these libraries may be gathered from the collections of papyii which have turned up from time to time, and have been sold by the Arabs to European buyers; e.g. the Sallier Collection, the Anastasi Collections, and that of Harris. They have found their way eventually into the British Museum or the Museum at Leyden, and have been published in the Select ra2)ijri of the former, or in the Monuments Egyptiens of the latter. ® The hymn to Harmakhis is in the Berlin Museum, and was published by Lepsitjs, Denhm., vi. 115, 117 a; it was translated by Maspero, Etudes de Mytliologie, vol. ii. pp. 454-457, and Hist. Ancienne des Feuples del’ Orient, 4tli edit., pp. 280-284. A hymn to Plitah in the same style, now also at Berlin
(Lepsius, Denhm., vi. 118-121), has been translated by PmmET, Etudes Egyptolog.pp. 1-19. Finally, the great hymn to Amon in the Bulaq Papyrus (Mariette, Les Papyrus Egyptiens, etc.,vol. ii. pis. 11-13) has been translated into French by Grebaut, Hymne a Amon-Bd des Pap. Egypt, du Mus^e du Boulaq, 1876, vol. i., into German by Stern, Ein Hymnus auf Amon-Ra, in Zeitsclirift, 1873, pp. 74-81, 125-127, and into English by Goodwin, Translation of an Egyptian Hymn to Amon, in Trans.

odd forms the monuments have made us familiar. “Heaven is in delight,
the earth is in joy, gods and men are making festival, to render glory to
Phra-Harmakhis, when they see him arise in his bark, having overturned his
enemies in his own time ! ” They accompany him from hour to hour, they
fight the good fight with him against Apopi, they shout aloud as he inflicts
each fresh wound upon the monster ; they do not even abandon him when the
west has swallowed him up in its darkness.^ Some parts of the hymn remind
us, in the definiteness of the imagery and in the abundance of detail, of a
portion of the poem of Pentauirit, or one of those inscriptions of Eamses III.
wherein he celebrates the defeat of hordes of Asiatics or Libyans.
The Egyptians took a delight in listening to stories. They preferred tales
which dealt with the marvellous and excited their imagination, introducing
speaking animals, gods in disguise, ghosts and magicd One of them tells of a
king who was distressed because he had no heir, and had no sooner obtained the
favour he desired from the gods, thau the Seven Hathors, the mistresses of Fate,
destroyed his happiness by predicting that the child would meet with his death
by a serpent, a dog, or a crocodile.'^ Efforts were made to provide against such
a fatality by shutting him up in a tower ; but no sooner had he grown to man’s
estate, than he procured himself a dog, went off to wander through the world, and

story describes two brothers, Anupu and Bitiu, who live happily together on
their farm till the wife of the elder falls in love with the younger, and on his

much, had not his animals warned him of danger, and had not Phra-Harmakhis
surrounded him at the critical moment with a stream teeming with crocodiles.

will lead a mysterious existence far from mankind ; he will retire to the Valley

498 THE CLOSE OF TEE THEBAN EMPIRE.
of the Acacia, place his heart on the topmost flower of the tree, and no one
will be able with impunity to steal it from him. The gods, however, who
frequent this earth take pity on his loneliness, and create for him a wife of
such beauty that the Nile falls in love with her, and steals a lock of her hair,
which is carried by its waters down into Egypt. Pharaoh finds the lock, and,
intoxicated by its scent, commands his people to go in quest of the owner.
Having discovered the lady, Pharaoh marries her, and ascertaining from her who
she is, he sends men to cut down the Acacia, but no sooner has the flower touched
the earth, than Bitiu droops and dies. The elder brother is made immediately
acquainted with the fact by means of various prodigies. The wine poured out
to him becomes troubled, his beer leaves a deposit. He seizes his shoes and
staff and sets out to find the heart. After a search of seven years he discovers
it, and reviving it in a vase of wmter, he puts it into the mouth of the corpse,
which at once returns to life. Bitiu, from this moment, seeks only to be
revenged. He changes himself into the bull Apis, and, on' being led to court,
he reproaches the queen with the crime she has committed against him. The
queen causes his throat to be cut ; two drops of his blood fall in front of the
gate of the palace, and produce in the night two splendid “Persea” trees, which
renew the accusation in a loud voice. The queen has them cut down, but a
chip from one of them flies into her mouth, and ere long she gives birth to
a child who is none other than a re-incarnation of Bitiu. When the child
succeeds to the Pharaoh, he assembles his council, reveals himself to them, and
punishes with death her who was first his wife and subsequently his mother.^ The
hero moves throughout the tale without exhibiting any surprise at the strange
incidents in which he takes part, and, as a matter of fact, they did not seriously
outrage the probabilities of contemporary life. In every town sorcerers could
be found who knew how to transform themselves into animals or raise the dead
to life : ^ we have seen how the accomplices of Pentauirit had recourse to spells
in order to gain admission to the royal palace when they desired to rid them
selves of Eamses III.^ The most extravagant romances differed from real life
merely in collecting within a dozen pages more miracles than were customarily
supposed to take place in the same number of years ; it was merely the
multiplicity of events, and not the events themselves, that gave to the narra

raised the tale out of the region of ordinary life; they are always the sons of
kings, Syrian princes, or Pharaohs ; sometimes we come across a vague and
undefined Pharaoh, who figures under the title of Piruiaui or Pruiti,^ but more
often it is a well-known and illustrious Pharaoh who is mentioned by name.^
It is related how, one day, Kheops, suffering from ennui within his palace,
assembled his sons in the hope of learning from them something which he did
not already know. They described to him one after another the prodigies
performed by celebrated magicians under Kanibri and Snofrui ; and at length
Mykerinos assured him that there was a certain Didi, living then not far
from Meidum, who was capable of repeating all the marvels done by former
wizards.^ Most of the Egyptian sovereigns were, in the same way, subjects of
more or less wonderful legends— Sesostris, Amenothes III., Thutmosis III.,
Amenemhait I., Khiti, Sahuri, Usirkaf, and Kakiu.^ These stories were put into
literary shape by the learned, recited by public story-tellers, and received by
the people as authentic history; they finally filtered into the writings of the
chroniclers, who, in introducing them into the annals, filled up with their
extraordinary details the lacunie of authentic tradition.® Sometimes the
narrative assumed a briefer form, and became an apologue. In one of them
the members of the body were supposed to have combined against the head,
and disputed its supremacy before a jury; the parties all pleaded their
cause in turn, and judgment was given in due form.® Animals also had their
place in this universal comedy. The passions or the weaknesses of humanity
were attributed to them, and the narrator makes the lion, rat, or jackal to
utter sentiments from which he draws some short practical moral. La Fontaine
had predecessors on the banks of the Nile of whose existence he little
dreamed.'^

subject after the manner of Kaqimni or Phtahhotpii2 One of their books,
in which the aged Ani inscribes his Instructions to his son, Khonshotpu, is
compiled in the form of a dialogue, and contains the usual commonplaces
upon virtue, temperance, piety, the respect due to parents from children, or
to the great ones of this world from their inferiors.^ The language in which
it is written is ingenious, picturesque, and at times eloquent; the work explains
much that is obscure in Egyptian life, and upon which the monuments have
thrown no light. “Beware of the woman who goes out surreptitiously in her
town, do not follow her or any like her, do not expose thyself to the experi
ence of what it costs a man to face an Ocean of which the bounds are unknown.^
The wife whose husband is far from home sends thee letters, and invites thee to
come to her daily when she has no witnesses ; if she succeeds in entangling
thee in her net, it is a crime which is punishable by death as soon as it is
known, even if no wicked act has taken place, for men will commit every sort
of crime when under this temptation alone.” ^ “ Be not quarrelsome in
breweries, for fear that thou mayest be denounced forthwith for words which
have proceeded from thy mouth, and of having spoken that of which thou art no
longer conscious. Thou fullest, thy members lielpless, and no one holds out
a hand to thee, but thy boon-companions around thee say : ‘ Away with the
drunkard ! ’ Thou art wanted for some business, and thou art found rolling
on the ground like an infant.”® In speaking of what a man owes to his mother,
Ani waxes eloquent : “ When she bore thee as all have to bear, she had in
thee a heavy burden without being able to call on thee to share it. When
thou wert born, after thy months were fulfilled, she placed herself under a
yoke in earnest, her breast was in thy mouth for three years ; in spite of the
increasing dirtiness of thy habits, her heart felt no disgust, and she never said :

writing, she followed thee every day with bread and beer from thy house.
Now thou art a full-grown man, thou hast taken a wife, thou hast provided
thyself with a house ; bear always in mind the pains of thy birth and the care
for thy education that thy mother lavished on thee, that her anger may not
rise up against thee, and that she lift not her hands to God, for he will hear
her complaint !
” ^ The whole of the book does not rise to this level, but we
find in it several maxims which appear to be popular proverbs, as for instance
“ He who hates idleness will come without being called ;
” “A good walker
comes to his journey’s end without needing to hasten;”^ or, “ The ox which
goes at the head of the flock and leads the others to pasture is but an animal
like his fellows.” ^ Towards the end, the son Khonshotpu, weary of such a
lengthy exhortation to wisdom, interrupts his father roughly ; “ Do not ever
lastingly speak of thy merits, I have heard enough of thy deeds ;
” ^ whereupon
Ani resignedly restrains himself from further speech, and a final parable gives
us the motive of his resignation : “ This is the likeness of the man who knows
the strength of his arm. The nursling who is in the arms of his mother cares
only for being suckled ; but no sooner has he found his mouth than he cries :
* Give me bread !
^
It is, perhaps, difficult for us to imagine an Egyptian in love repeating
madrigals to his mistress,® for we cannot easily realise that the hard and
blackened bodies we see in our museums have once been men and women
loving and beloved in their own day. The feeling which they entertained
one for another had none of the reticence or delicacy of our love ; they went
straight to the point, and the language in which they expressed themselves

504 THE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
is sometimes too coarse for our taste. ^ The manners and customs of daily
life among the Egyptians tended to blunt in them the feelings of modesty
and refinement to which our civilization has accustomed us. Their children
went about without clothes, or, at any rate, wore none until the age of puberty.
Owing to the climate, both men and women left the upper part of the body
more or less uncovered, or wore fabrics of a transparent nature. In the towns,
the servants who moved about their masters or his guests had merely a narrow
loin-cloth tied round their hips ; while in the country, the peasants dispensed
with even this covering, and the women tucked up their garments when at
work so as to move more freely. The religious teaching and the ceremonies
connected with their worship drew the attention of the faithful to the unveiled
human form of their gods, and the hieroglyphs themselves contained pictures
which shock our sense of propriety. Hence it came about that the young girl
who was demanded in marriage had no idea, like the maiden of to-day, of the
vague delights of an ideal union. The physical side was impressed upon her
mind, and she was well aware of the full meaning of her consent. Her lover,
separated from her by her disapproving parents, thus expresses the grief
which overwhelms him : “ I desire to lie down in my chamber, —for I am sick
on thy account,—and the neighbours come to visit me. — Ah ! if my sister but
came with them,—she would show the physicians what ailed me,—for she
knows my sickness!”^ Even while he thus complains, he sees her in his
imagination, and his spirit visits the places she frequents : “ The villa of my
sister,— (a pool is before the house), —the door opens suddenly,— and my sister
passes out in wrath. —Ah ! why am I not the porter,—that she might give me
her orders ! — I should at least hear her voice, even were she angry,—and I, like
a little boy, full of fear before her !
” ^ Meantime the young girl sighs in vain
for “ her brother, the beloved of her heart,” and all that charmed her before
has now ceased to please her. “ I went to prepare my snare, my cage and the
covert for my trap —for all the birds of Puanit alight upon Egypt, redolent
with perfume ; — he who flies foremost of the flock is attracted by my worm,
bringing odours from Puanit,— its claws full of incense. —But my heart is with
thee, and desires that we should trap them together, — I with thee, alone, and
that thou shouldest be able to hear the sad cry of my perfumed bird,—there
near to me, close to me, I will make ready my trap, — 0 my beautiful friend,

LOVE-SONGS. 505
thou who goest to the field of the well-beloved !
” ^ The latter, however, is
slow to appear, the day passes away, the evening conies on : “ The cry of the
goose resounds—which is caught by the worm-bait,—but thy love removes
me far from the bird, and I am unable to deliver myself from it ; — will carry
off my net, and what shall I say to my mother, —when I shall have returned
to her ?—Every day I come back laden with spoil,—but to-day I have not
been able to set my trap,—for thy love makes me its prisoner !
” “ The goose
flies away, alights,—it has greeted the barns with its cry ;—the flock of birds
increases on the river, but I leave them alone and think only of thy love,
for my heart is bound to thy heart—and I cannot tear myself away from thy
beauty.” ^ Her mother probably gave her a scolding, but she hardly minds
it, and in the retirement of her chamber never wearies of thinking of her
brother, and of passionately crying for him : “ 0 my beautiful friend ! I yearn
to be with thee as thy wife—and that thou shouldest go whither thou wishest
with thine arm upon my arm, — for then I will repeat to my heart, which is in
thy breast, my supplications. —If my great brother does not come to-night,—I am
as those who lie in the tomb—for thou, art thou not health and life,—he who
transfers the joys of thy health to my heart which seeks thee ? ” ^ The hours
pass away and he does not come, and already “ the voice of the turtle-dove
speaks,—it says : ‘ Behold, the dawn is here, alas ! what is to become of
me ? ’ ^ Thou, thou art the bird, thou callest me,—and I find my brother in
his chamber,—and my heart is rejoiced to see him !—I will never go away
again, my hand will remain in thy hand, —and when I wander forth, I will go
with thee into the most beautiful places, — happy in that he makes me the
foremost of women —and that he does not break my heart.” ^ We should like
to quote the whole of it, but the text is mutilated, and we are unable to fill
in the blanks. It is, nevertheless, one of those products of the Egyptian mind
which it would have been easy for us to appreciate from beginning to end,
without efibrt and almost without explanation. The passion in it finds ex
pression in such sincere and simple language as to render rhetorical ornament
needless, and one can trace in it, therefore, nothing of the artificial colouring

south they diminished in number, tombs and monuments becoming fewer and
appearing at wider intervals ; the Migdol of Ramses III. formed an isolated

The name of the Ramesseum was found in the ostraca by Wiedemann, Ein Fund Thehanischer Ostralca, in tlie Zeitschrift, 1863, p. 34. ® The name was transcribed in Greek with the masculine article Pa, Pasemis; in Coptic, Siime, Sime (Brugsch, G^ogr.

temples bad around it its enclosing wall of dried brick,^ and the collection
of buildings within this boundary formed the Khiru, or retreat of some one
of the Theban Pharaohs, which, in the official language of the time, was
designated the “august Khiru of millions of years.” ^ A sort of fortified
structure, which was built into one of the corners, served as a place of deposit
for the treasure and archives, and could be used as a prison if occasion
required.^ The remaining buildings consisted of storehouses, stables, and
houses for the priests and other officials. In some cases the storehouses were
constructed on a regular plan which the architect had fitted in with that
of the temple. Their ruins at the back and sides of the Kamesseum form a
double row of vaults, extending from the foot of the hills to the border of the
cultivated lands. Stone recesses on the roof furnished shelter for the watch
men.‘‘ The outermost of the village huts stood among the nearest tombs. The
population which had been gathered together there was of a peculiar character,
and we can gather but a feeble idea of its nature from the surroundings of the
cemeteries in our own great cities. Death required, in fact, far more attendants
among the ancient Egyptians than with us. The first service was that of mummi
fication, which necessitated numbers of workers for its accomplishment. Some
of the workshops of the embalmers have been discovered from time to time at
Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh and Deir el-Bahari, but we are still in ignorance as to
their arrangements, and as to the exact nature of the materials which they em
ployed.® A considerable superficial space was required, for the manipulations of
the embalmers occupied usually from sixty to eighty days, and if we suppose that
the average deaths at Thebes amounted to fifteen or twenty in the twenty-four
hours, they would have to provide at the same time for the various degrees of satu
ration of some twelve to fifteen hundred bodies at the least.® Each of the corpses,
moreover, necessitated the employment of at least half a dozen workmen to wash

hand, still preserves, where the operations have been properly conducted, its
natural form. The cheeks have fallen in slightly, the lips and the fleshy
parts of the nose have become thinner and more drawn than during life, but
the general expression of the face remains unaltered."* A mask of pitch was
placed over the visage to preserve it, above which was adjusted first a piece of
linen and then a series of bands impregnated with resin, which increased the
size of the liead to twofold its ordinary bulk.® The trunk and limbs were
thus obtaiued to ancient Thebes. The same result follows from calculations based on more recent figures, obtained before the great hygienic changes introduced into Cairo by Ismail Pacha, i.e. from August 1, 1858, to July 31, 1859 (Schnepp, Considerations surle mouvement de la population en Egypte, in the Memoires de VInstitut Egyptien, vol. i. p. 544), and from May 24, 1865, to May 16, 1866 (Ch.

Coarsely powdered natron was scattered here and there over the body as an
additional preservative. Packets placed between the legs, the arms and the
hips, and in the eviscerated abdomen, contained the heart, spleen, the dried
brain, tlie hair, and the eiittings of the beard and nails. In those days the hair
had a special magical virtue : by burning it while uttering certain incantations,
one might acquire an almost limitless power over the person to whom it had
belonged. The embalmers, therefore, took care to place with the mummy such
portions of the hair as they had been obliged to cut off, so as to remove them
out of the way of the perverse ingenuity of the sorcerers.^ Over the first
covering of the mummy already alluded to, there was sometimes placed a strip
of papyrus or a long piece of linen, upon whieh the scribe had transcribed
selections— both text and pictures—from “ The Book of the going forth

together at the back, and kept in place by transverse bands disposed at intervals
from head to foot. The son of the deceased and a “ man of the roll ” were

his limbs, and be protected from the dangers of the world beyond. These were
repeated to the dead person, however, for greater security, during the process
of embalming, and the son of the deceased, or the master of the ceremonies,,
took care to whisper to the mummy the most mysterious parts, which no living
ear might hear with impunity.^ The wrappings having been completed, the
deceased person became aware of his equipment, and enjoyed all the privileges
of the “ instructed and fortified Manes.” He felt himself, both mummy and
double, now ready for the tomb.
Egyptian funerals were not like those to which we are accustomed—mute
ceremonies, in which sorrow is barely expressed by a furtive tear : noise,
sobbings, and wild gestures were their necessary concomitants.^ Hot only was
it customary to hire weeping women, who tore their hair, filled the air with
their lamentations, and simulated by skilful actions the depths of despair, but
the relatives and friends themselves did not shrink from making an outward
show of their grief, nor from disturbing the equanimity of the passers-by by the
immoderate expressions of their sorrow. One after another they raised their
voices, and uttered some expression appropriate to the occasion : “ To the West,,
the dwelling of Osiris, to the West, thou who wast the best of men, and who
always hated guile.” ^ And the hired weepers answered in chorus : “ 0 chief,®
as thou goest to the West, the gods themselves lament.”® The funeral cortege

mummy pursued its undisturbed course towards the last stage of its mysterious
voyage.
The majority of the tombs —those which were distributed over the plain or
on the nearest spurs of the hill— were constructed on the lines of those brick
built pyramids erected on mastabas which were very common during the
early Theban dynasties.^ The relative proportions of the parts alone were
modified : the mastaba, which had gradually been reduced to an insignificant
base, had now recovered its original height, while the pyramid had cor
respondingly decreased, and was much reduced in size. The chapel was

constructed within the building, and the mummy-pit was sunk to a varying
depth below. The tombs ranged along the mountain-side were, on the other
hand, rock-cut, and similar to those at el-Bersheh and Beni-Hasan.^ The
heads of wealthy families or the nobility naturally did not leave to the last
moment the construction of a sepulchre worthy of their rank and fortune.
They prided themselves on liaving “ finished their house which is in the funeral
valley when the morning for the hiding away of their body should come.” ^
Access to these tombs was by too steep and difficult a path to allow of oxen
being employed for the transport of the mummy : the friends or slaves of the
deceased were, therefore, obliged to raise the sarcophagus on their shoulders
and bear it as best they could to the door of the tomb. The mummy was then
placed in an upright position on a heap of sand, with its back to the wall and
facing the assistants, like the master of some new villa who, having been
aecompanied by his friends to see him take possession, turns for a moment on

the threshold to take leave of them before entering. A sacrifice, an offering,
a prayer, and a fresh outburst of grief ensued ; the mourners redoubled their
cries and threw themselves upon the ground, the relatives decked the mummy
with flowers and pressed it to their bared bosoms, kissing it upon the breast
and knees. “ I am thy sister, O great one ! forsake me not ! Is it indeed thy
will that I should leave thee ? If I go away, thou shalt be here alone, and is
there any one w'ho will be with thee to follow thee ? O thou who lovedst
to jest with me, thou art now silent, thou speakest not ! ” Whereupon the
mourners again broke out in chorus : “ Lamentation, lamentation ! Make,
make, make, make lamentation without ceasing as loud as can be made. O
good traveller, who takest thy way towards the land of Eternity, thou hast
been torn from us ! 0 thou who hadst so many around thee, thou art now
in the land which bringest isolation ! Thou who lovedst to stretch thy limbs
in walkiug, art now fettered, bound, swathed ! Thou who hadst fine stuffs in
abundance, art laid in the linen of yesterday!”^ Calm in the midst of the
tumult, the priest stood and offered the incense and libation with the accus
tomed words: “To thy double, Osiris ISTofirhotpu, whose voice before the great
god is true ! ” This was the signal of departure, and the mummy, carried by
two men, disappeared within the tomb : the darkness of the other world had
laid hold of it, never to let it go again.
The chapel was usually divided into two chambers : one, which was of greater
width than length, ran parallel to the fapade ; the other, which was longer
than it was wide, stood at right angles with the former, exactly opposite to
the entrance.^ The decoration of these chambers took its inspiration from the
scheme which prevailed in the time of the Mempliite dynasties, but besides
the usual scenes of agricultural labour, hunting, and sacrifice, there were
introduced episodes from the public life of the deceased, and particularly the
minute portrayal of the ceremonies connected with his burial. These pictorial
biograpliies are always accompanied by detailed explanatory inscriptions
every individual endeavoured thus to show to the Osirian judges the rank he
had enjoyed here upon earth, and to obtain in the fields of lalu the place
which he claimed to be his due. The stele was to be found at the far end of
the second chamber ; it was often let in to a niche in the form of a round
headed doorway, or else it was replaced by a group of statues, either detached

sacrificial slaughterers had despatched the bull of the south, and cut it in
pieces, the priest seized the bleeding haunch, and raised it to the lips of the
mask as if to invite it to eat; but the lips still remained closed, and refused to
perform their office. The priest then
touched them with several iron instru
ments hafted on wooden handles, which
were supposed to possess the power
of unsealing them. The “ opening ”
once effected, the double became
free, and the tomb-paintings from
thenceforward ceasing to depict the
mummy, represented the double
only. They portrayed it “ under the
form which he had on this earth,”

it from robbers or archa3ologists.
At the period of the first Theban
empire the coffins were rectangular wooden chests, made on the models of the
limestone and granite sarcophagi, and covered with prayers taken from the
various sacred w'ritings, especially from the “ Book of the Dead ” : ^ during
the second Theban empire, they were modified into an actual sheath for the
body, following more or less tlie contour of the human figure. This external
model of the deceased covered his remains, and his figure in relief served

times, on the contrary, the coffin was merely a conventional reproduction of
the human form. The two feet and legs were joined together, and the model
ling of the knee, calf, thigh, and stomach was only slightly indicated in the
wood. Towards the close of the XVIIP' dynasty it was the fashion for wealthy
persons to have two coffins, one fitting inside the other, painted black or
white. From the XX*** dynasty onwards they were coated with a yellowish
varnish, and so covered with inscriptions and mystic signs that each coffin was
a tomb in miniature, and could well have done duty as such, and thus meet all

world was composed. The workmen, after having deposited the mummy in its
resting-place, piled upon the floor of the tomb the canopic jars, the caskets,
the provisions, the furniture, the bed, and the stools and chairs ; the Ushabtiu
occupied compartments in their allotted boxes, and sometimes there would be
laid beside them the mummy of a favourite animal—a monkey, a dog of some
rare breed, or a pet gazelle, wliose coffins were shaped to their respective outlines,

the better to place before the
deceased the presentment of the
living animal. A few of the prin
cipal objects were broken or
damaged, in the belief that, by
thus destroying them, their doubles
would go forth and accompany the
human double, and render him
their accustomed services during
the whole of his posthumous ex- .
istence ; a charm pronounced over
them bound them indissolubly to
his person, and constrained them
to obey his will. This done, the favoukite gazelle of
priest muttered a final prayer,
and the masons walled up the doorway. The funeral feast now took place
with its customary songs and dances. The ahnehs addressed the guests and
exhorted them to make good use of the passing hour : “ Be happy for one
day ! for when you enter your tombs you will rest there eternally throughout
the length of every day !
”^
Immediately after the repast the friends departed from the tomb, and the
last link which connected the dead with our world was then broken. The
sacred harper was called upon to raise the farewell hymn ;
^ “ 0 instructed
mummies,^ ennead of the gods of the coffin, who listen to the praises of this
dead man, and who daily extol the virtues of this instructed mummy, who is
living eternally like a god, ruling in Amentit, ye also who shall live in the
memory of posterity, all ye who shall come and read these hymns inscribed,
according to the rites, within the tombs, repeat : ‘ The greatness of the under
vvorld, what is it ? The annihilation of the tomb, why is it ? ’ It is to conform
to the image of the land of Eternity, the true country where there is no strife

still that which expressed most forcibly the melancholy thought paramount
in the minds of the friends assembled to perform the last rites. “ The im

The poor and insignificant had merely a place in the common pit, which was
situated in the centre of the Assassif,^ one of the richest funerary quarters of
Thebes. Yawning trenches stood ever open there, ready to receive their prey ;
the rites were hurriedly performed, and the grave-diggers covered the mummies
of the day’s burial with a little sand, out of which we receive them intact.

Vassalli assures me that he sometimes found the mummies piled one on another to the depth of sixty bodies, and even then he did not reach the lowest of the pile.

bandages of coarse linen, and have been consigned without further covering

side, so as to form a sort of primitive basket.'-^ The class above the poorest
people were buried in rough-hewn wooden boxes, smaller at the feet than
towards the head, and devoid of any inscription or painting.^ Many have
been placed in any coffin that came to hand, with a total indifference as to
suitability of size ; others lie in a badly made bier, made up of the fragments
of one or more older biers. None of them possessed any funerary furniture,
except the tools of his trade, a thin pair of leather shoes, sandals of cardboard
or plaited reeds, rings of terra-cotta or bronze, bracelets or necklets of a single
row of blue beads, statuettes of divinities, mystic eyes, scarabs, and, above
all, cords tied round the neck, arms, limbs, or waist, to keep off, by their
mystic knots, all malign influences.*
The whole population of the necropolis made their living out of the dead.
This was true of all ranks of society, headed by the sacerdotal colleges of
the royal chapels,^ and followed by the priestly bodies, to whom was entrusted
tlie care of the tombs in the various sections, but the most influential of
whom confined their attentions to the old burying-ground, “ Isit-mait,” the
True Place.*^ It was their duty to keep up the monuments of the kings,
and also of private individuals, to clean the tombs, to visit the funerary
chambers, to note the condition of their occupants, and, if necessary, repair
the damage done by time, and to provide on certain days the offerings pre
scribed by custom, or by clauses in the contract drawn up between the family
of the deceased and the religious authorities. The titles of these officials
indicated how humble was their position in relation to the deified ancestors in
whose service they were employed ; they called themselves the “ Servants of
the True Place,” and their chiefs the “ Superiors of the Servants,” but all the
while they were people of considerable importance, being rich, well educated,
and respected in their own quarter of the town. They professed to have a

six centuries of continuous homage, had come to be considered as the patrons

It is true that the officials were not always clear as to the identity of the
royal remains of which they had the care, and they were known to have changed
one of their queens or princesses into
a king or some royal prince.^ They j
were surrounded by a whole host of
lesser functionaries — bricklayers,
masons, labourers, exorcists, scribes
(who wrote out pious formulce for
poor people, or copied the Books of
the going forth by day ” for the
mummies), weavers, cabinet-makers,
and goldsmiths. The sculptors and
the painters were grouped into guilds
many of them spent their days in the
tombs they were decorating, while
others had their workshops above
ground, probably very like those of
our modern monumental masons. They
kept at the disposal of their needy
customers an assortment of ready
made statues and stelee, votive tablets
to Osiris, Anubis, and other Theban
gods and goddesses, singly or combined.

528 THE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
devoted themselves to work of a higher kind. Sculpture had reached a high
degree of development under the Thutmoses and the Karases, and the art of
depicting scenes in bas-relief had been brought to a perfection hitherto unknown.
This will be easily seen by comparing the pictures in the old mastabas, such
as those of Ti or Phtahhotpu, with the finest parts of the temples of Qurneh,
Abydos, Karnak, Deir
el-Bahari, or with the
scenes in the tombs of
Seti I. and Ramses 11.,
or those of private indi
viduals such as Hui.
The modelling is firm
and refined, showing a
skill in the use of the
chisel and an elegance
of outline which have
never been surpassed :
the Amenothes 111. of
Luxor and the Ivhamhait
of Sheikh Abd el-Qurneh
might serve for models
in our own schools of
the highest types which
Egyptian art could pro
duce at its best in this
particular branch. The drawing is freer than in earlier examples, the action
is more natural, the composition more studied, and the perspective less wild.
We feel that the artist handled his subject con amore. He spared no trouble in
sketching out his designs and in making studies from nature, and, as papyrus
was expensive, he drew rough drafts, or made notes of his impressions on
the flat chips of limestone with which the workshops were strewn. Nothing
at that date could rival these sketches for boldness of conception and freedom
in execution, whether it were in the portrayal of the majestic gait of a king
or the agility of an acrobat. Of the latter we have an example in tlie
Turin Museum. The girl is nude, with the exception of a tightly fitting belt
about her hips, and she is throwing herself backwards with so natural a motion,
that we are almost tempted to expect her to turn a somersault and fall once
more into position with her heels together. The unfinished figures on the

tomb of Seti I. show with what a steady hand the clever draughtsman could
sketch out his subjects. The head from the nape of the neck round to
the throat is described by a single line, and the contour of the shoulders
is marked by another. The form of the body is traced by two undu
lating lines, while the arms
and legs are respectively
outlined by two others.^
The articles of apparel
and ornaments, sketched
rapidly at first, had to be
gone over again by the
sculptor, who worked out
the smallest details. One
might almost count the
tresses of the hair, while
the folds of the dress and
the enamels of the girdle
and bracelets are minutely
chiselled. When the draughtsman had finished his picture from the sketch
which he had made, or when he had enlarged it from a smaller drawing, the
master of the studio would go over it again, marking here and there in red
the defective points, to which the sculptor gave his attention when working the
subject out on the wall. If he happened to make a mistake in executing it,
he corrected it as well as he was able by filling up with stucco or hard cement
the portions to be remodelled, and by starting to work again upon the fresh
surface. This cement has fallen out in some cases, and reveals to our eyes
to-day the marks of the underlying chiselling. There are, for example, two
profiles of Seti I. on one of the bas-reliefs of the hypostyle hall at Karnak,
one faintly outlined, and the other standing fully out from the surface of the
stone. The sense of the picturesque was making itself felt, and artists were no
longer to be excused for neglecting architectural details, the configuration of
the country, the drawing of rare plants, and, in fact, all those accessories which
had been previously omitted altogether or merely indicated. The necessity
of covering such vast surfaces as the pylons offered had accustomed them to
arrange the various scenes of one and the same action in a more natural and
intimate connexion than their predecessors could possibly have done. In these
scenes the Pharaoh naturally played the chief part, but in place of choosing
for treatment merely one or other important action of the monarch calculated

to exhibit his courage, the artist endeavoured to portray all the succes
sive incidents in his campaigns, in the same manner as the early Italian
painters were accustomed to depict, one after the other, and on the same
canvas, all the events of the
same legend. The details
of these gigantic composi
tions may sometimes ap
pear childish to us, and we
may frequently he at a loss
in determining the relations
of the parts, yet the whole
is full of movement, and,
although mutilated, gives
us even yet the impression
which would have been
made upon us by the tur
moil of a battle in those
distant days.^
The sculptor of statues
for a long time past was
not a whit less skilful than
the artist who executed
bas-reliefs. The sculptor
was doubtless often obliged
to give enormous propor
tions to the figure of the
king, to prevent his being
overshadowed bj" the mass of buildings among which the statue was to
appear ; but this necessity of exaggerating the human form did not
destroy in the artist that sense of proportion and that skilful handling of
the chisel which are so strikingly displayed in the sitting scribe or in the
princess at Meidfim ; it merely trained him to mark out deftly the principal
lines, and to calculate the volume and dimensions of these gigantic granite
figures of some fifty to sixty-five feet high,^ with as great confidence and skill
as he would have employed upon any statue of ordinary dimensions which

still witness to the incomparable skill of the Theban sculptors in the
difficult art of imagining and executing superhuman types. The decadence
of Egyptian art did not begin until the time of Ramses
but its downward progress was rapid, and the statues of the
Eamessicle period are of little or no artistic value. The form
of these figures is poor, the technique crude, and the ex
pression of the faces mean and commonplace.
They betray the hand of a
mechanical workman who,
while still in the possession
of the instruments of his
trade, can infuse no new
life into the traditions
of the schools, nor break
away from them alto
gether. We must look,
not to the royal studios,
but to the workshops con
nected with the necro
polis, if we want to find
statues of half life
size displaying intel
ligent workmanship,
all of which we might
be tempted to refer to the XVIII'’' dynasty if the inscriptions upon them
did not fix their date some two or three centuries later. An example of them
may be seen at Turin in the kneeling scribe embracing a ram-headed altar
the face is youthful, and has an expression at once so gentle and intelligent
that we are constrained to overlook the imperfections in the bust and legs of
the figure. Specimens of this kind are not numerous, and their rarity is easily
accounted for. The multitude of priests, soldiers, workmen, and small middle
class people who made up the bulk of the Theban population had aspirations
for a luxury little commensurate with their means, and the tombs of such people
are, therefore, full of objects which simulate a character they do not possess, and
are deceptive to the eye : such were the statuettes made of wood, substituted

from economical motives instead of the limestone or sandstone statues usually
provided as supporters for the “ double.” The funerary sculptors had acquired
a perfect mastery of the kind of art needed for people of small means, and we
find among the medley of commonplace objects which
encumber the tombs they decorated, examples of artistic
works of undoubted excellence, such as the ladies Nai
and Tui now in the Louvre, the lady Nehai now at
Berlin, and the naked child at Turin.^ The lady Tui
in her lifetime had been one of the singing-women of
Amon. She is clad in a tight-fitting robe, which accen
tuates the contour of the breasts and hips without
coarseness : her right arm falls gracefully along
side her body, while her left, bent across her
chest, thrusts into her bosom a kind of magic
whip, which was tlie sign of her profession. The
artist was not able to avoid a certain heaviness
in the treatment of her hair, and the careful
execution of the whole work was not without a
degree of harshness, but by dint of
scraping and polishing the
wood he succeeded in
softening the outline, and
removing from the figure
every sharp point. The
lady Nehai is smarter and
more graceful, in her close-fitting garment and her mantle thrown over the
left elbow ; and the artist has given her a more alert pose and resolute
air than we find in the stiff carriage of her contemporary Tui. The little
girl in the Turin Museum is a looser work, but where could one find a better
example of the lithe delicacy of the young Egyptian maiden of eight or ten
years old? We may see her counterpart to-day among the young Nubian
girls of the cataract, before they are obliged to wear clothes ; there is the same
thin chest, the same undeveloped hips, the same meagre thighs, and the
same demeanour, at once innocent and audacious. Other statuettes repre
sent matrons, some in tight garments, and with their hair closely confined.

her head is square-shaped, the shoulders narrow,
the chest puny, the pose of the arm stiff and awk
ward, but the eyes have such a joyful openness,
and her smile such a self-satisfied expression,
that one readily overlooks the other defects of
the statue. In this collection of miniature
figures examples of men are not wanting, and
there are instances of old soldiers, officials,
guardians of temples, and priests proudly
executing their office in their distinctive
panther skins. Three individuals in the

by the solar disk, and inserted on the top of a thick handle ; another, who
has been relegated to Turin, appears to be placed between two long staves,
each surmounted by an idol, and, to judge from his attitude, seems to have no
small idea of his own beauty and importance. The Egyptians were an obser
vant people and inclined to satire, and I have a shrewd suspicion that the
sculptors, in giving to
such statuettes this
character of childlike
vanity, yielded to the
temptation to be merry
at the expense of their
model.
The smelters and
engravers in metal oc
cupied in relation to
the sculptors a some
what exalted position.
Bronze had for a long
time been employed in funerary furniture, and usliabtm (respondents),^
amulets, and images of the gods, as well as of mortals, were cast in this
metal. Many of these tiny figures form charming examples of enamel-work,
and are distinguished not only by the gracefulness of the modelling, but
also by the brilliance of the superimposed glaze ; but the majority of them'
were purely commercial articles, manufactured by the hundred from the same
models, and possibly cast, for centuries, from the same moulds for the
edification of the devout and of pilgrims. We ought not, therefore, to be
surprised if they are lacking in originality ; they are no more to be dis
tiuguished from each other than the hundreds of coloured statuettes which
one may find on the stalls of modern dealers in religious statuary.^ Here
and there among the multitude we may light upon examples showing a
marked individuality : the statuette of the lady Takushit, which now forms
one of the ornaments of the museum at Athens,^ is an instance. She stands
erect, one foot in advance, her right arm hanging at her side, her left pressed
against her bosom ; she is arrayed in a short dress embroidered over with
religious scenes, and wears upon her ankles and wrists rings of value. A wig

details of the drapery and the ornaments are incised on the surface of the
bronze, and heightened with a thread of silver. The face is evidently a
portrait, and is that apparently
of a woman of mature age,
but the body, according to
the tradition of the Egyptian
schools of art, is that of a
young girl, lithe, firm, and
elastic. The alloy contains
gold, and the warm and soft

moniously with the white lines
of the designs. The joiners oc
after the workers in
bronze, an important position
in relation to the necropolis,
and the greater part of the
furniture which they executed for the mummies of persons of high rank
was remarkable for its painting and carpentry-work. Some articles of their
manufacture were intended for religious use —such as those shrines, mounted
upon sledges, on which the image of the god was placed, to whom prayers were
made for the deceased ; others served for the household needs of the mummy,
and, to distinguish these, there are to be seen upon their sides religious and
funereal pictures, offerings to the two deceased parents, sacrifices to a god or
goddess, and incidents in the Osirian life. Tlie funerary beds consisted, like
those intended for the living, of a rectangular framework, placed upon four feet
of equal height, although there are rare examples in which the supports are
so arranged as to give a gentle slope to the structure. The fancy wiiich actuated
the joiner in making such beds supposed that two benevolent lions had, of
their own free will, stretched out their bodies to form the two sides of the
couch, the muzzles constituting the pillow, while the tails were curled up under
the feet of the sleeper.^ Many of the heads given to the lions are so noble
and expressive, that they will well bear comparison with the granite statues
of these animals which Amenothes III. dedicated in his temple at Soleb.® The

other trades depended upon the proportion of their members to the rest of the
community for the estimation in which they were held. The masons, stone
cutters, and common labourers ^ furnished the most important contingent
among these ought also to be reckoned the royal servants—-of whose functions
we should have been at a loss to guess the importance, if contemporary docu
ments had not made it clear—fishermen, hunters, laundresses, wood-cutters,
gardeners, and water-carriers. ^ Without
reckoning the constant libations needed
for the gods and the deceased, the
workshops required a large
quantity of drinking water
for the men engaged in
them. In every gang of
workmen, even in the present
day, two or three men are
set apart to provide drinking
water for the rest; in some
arid places, indeed, at a dis
tance from the river, such as
, the Valley of the Kings, as
THE SWALLOW-GODDESS FROM THE THEBAN NECROPOLIS/ •' ° ’
many water-carriers are re
quired as there are workmen. To the trades just mentioned must be added the
low-caste crowd depending on the burials of the rich, the acrobats, female
mourners, dancers and musicians. The majority of the female corporations
were distinguished by the infamous character of their manners, and prostitution
among them had come to be associated with the service of the god.^
There was no education for all this mass of people, and their religion was
of a meagre character. They worshipped the official deities, Amon, Mut, Isis,
and Hathor, and such deceased Pharaohs as Amenothes I. and Nofritari, but

the name Maritsakro, the friend of silence. Three heads, or the single head
of a woman, attached to the one body, were assigned to it.^ It was
supposed to dwell in the mountain opposite Karnak, which fact gave to it, as
well as to the necropolis itself, the
two epithets of Khafitnibus and
Ta-tahnit, that is. The Summit.®
Its chapel was situated at the foot
of the hill of Sheikh Abd el
Qurneh, but its sacred serpents
crawled and wriggled through the
necropolis, working miracles and
elfecting the cure of the most dan
gerous maladies. The faithful were
accustomed to dedicate to them,
in payment of their vows, stelae, or
slabs of roughly hewn stone, with
inscriptions w’hich witnessed to
a deep gratitude. “ Hearken ! I,
from the time of my appearance
on earth, I was a ‘ Servant of the True Place,’ Nofirabu, a stupid ignorant
person, who knew not good from evil, and I committed sin against The Summit.

the miserable sinners among the people of the necropolis : ‘ Give heed to The
Summit, for there is a lion in The Summit, and she strikes as strikes a spell-cast
ing Lion, and she pursues him who sins against her!’ I invoked then my mistress,
and I felt that she flew to me like a pleasant breeze ; she placed herself upon
me, and this made me recognise her hand, and appeased she returned to me, and
she delivered me from suffering, for she is my life. The Summit of the AVest,

sinners, we may believe, among that ignorant and superstitious population, but
the governors of Thebes did not put their confidence in the local deities alone to
keep them within bounds, and to prevent tlieir evil deeds ; commissioners, with
the help of a detachment of Mazaiu, were an additional means of conducting
them into the right way.^ They had, in this respect, a hard work to accomplish,
for every day brought with it its contingent of crimes, which they had to follow
up, and secure the punishment of the authors.^ Xsisuamon came to inform them
that the workman Nakhtummaut and his companions had stolen into his house,
and robbed him of three large loaves, eight cakes, and some pastry ; they had
also drunk a jar of beer, and poured out from pure malice the oil which they
could not carry away with themd Panibi had met the wife of a comrade alone
near an out-of-the-way tomb, and had taken advantage of her notwithstanding
her cries ; this, moreover, was not the first offence of the culprit, for several
young girls had previously been victims of his brutality, and had not ventured
up to this time to complain of him on account of the terror with which he
inspired the neighbourhood.^ Crimes against the dead were always common ;
every penniless fellow knew what quantities of gold and jewels had been entombed
with the departed, and these treasures, scattered around them at only a few
feet from the surface of the ground, presented to them a constant temptation
to which they often succumbed.® Some were not disposed to have accomplices,
while others associated together, and, having purchased at a serious cost the

connivance of the custodians, set boldly to work on tombs both recent and
ancient.^ Not content with stealing the funerary furniture, which they disposed
of to the undertakers, they stripped the mummies also, and smashed the bodies
in their efforts to secure the jewels; then, putting the remains together again,,
they rearranged the mummies afresh so cleverly that they can no longer be
distinguished by their outward appearance from the originals, and the first
wrappings must be removed before the fraud can be discovered.^ From time to
time one of these rogues would allow himself to be taken for the purpose of
denouncing his comrades, and avenging himself for the injustice of which he
was the victim in the division of the spoil ; he was laid hold of by the Mazaiu,
and brought before the tribunal of justice. The lauds situated on the left bank
of the Nile belonged partly to the king and partly to the god Amon, and any
infraction of the law in regard to the necropolis was almost certain to come
within the jurisdiction of one or other of them.^ The commission appointed,
therefore, to determine the damage done in any case, included in many instances
the high priest or his delegates, as well as the officers of the Pharaoh."* The
office of this commission was to examine into the state of the tombs, to inter
rogate the witnesses and the accused, applying the torture if necessary : when
they had got at the facts, the tribunal of the notables condemned to impale
ment some half a dozen of the poor wretches, and caused some score of others
to be whipped.® But, when two or three months had elapsed, the remembrance
of the punishment began to die away, and the depredations began afresh.
The low rate of wages occasioned, at fixed periods, outbursts of discon
tent and trouble which ended in actual disturbances. The rations allowed to
each workman, and given to him at the beginning of each month, would possibly
have been sufficient for himself and his family, but, owing to the usual lack
of foresight in the Egyptian, they were often consumed long before the time
fixed, and the pinch soon began to be felt.® The workmen, demoralised by

Other examples are cited by Spiegelberg, Arheiter und Arheilerbewegung im Pharaonenreich, p. 24, and especially in the Translation of the Mayor Papyri A, B, in which 'a fair proportion of priests, scribes, and guardians are to be found among those accused of violating the tombs. ® Jomard pointed out some time ago cases of these re-made mummies of men and animals (Description des HypogAes de la ville de Thebes, in Description de I’Egypte, vol. iii. pp. 85, 86, 94, 95). Many were discovered among those of the princes and princesses of the XVIIP'' dynasty at Deir elBahari (Maspero, Les Momies royales, in M^m. de la Mission Frangaise, vol. i. pp. 538-542, 544, 547, 548). ® Maspero, Une Enquete judiciare a Thebes sous la dynastie, p. 69. * With regard to this organisation of the police and of the tribunals of justice, I can only refer to the work of Spiegelberg, already referred to, Studien und Materialien zum Reohtsiuesen des Pharaonenreiches, 1892. * This is how I translate a fairly common expression, which means literally, “ to be put on the wood.” Spiegelberg sees in this only a method of administering torture (pp. ciL, pp. 76-78, 123, n. 329). “ See pp. 342-344 of the Daum of Civilization for what is said on this subject.

their involuntary abstinence, were not slow to turn to the overseer : “ We
are perishing of hunger, and there are still eighteen days before the next
month.” ^ The latter was prodigal of fair speeches, but as his words were
rarely accompanied by deeds, the workmen would not listen to him ; they
stopped work, left the workshop in turbulent crowds, ran with noisy demon
•strations to some public place to hold a meeting—perhaps the nearest monu
ment, at the gate of the temple of Thutmosis behind the chapel of
Minephtah,^ or in the court of that of Seti Their overseers followed
them ; the police commissioners of the locality, the Mazaiii, and the scribes
mingled with them and addressed themselves to some of the leaders with whom
they might be acquainted. But these would not at first give them a hearing.
“ AVe will not return,” they would say to the peacemakers; “make it clear
to your superiors down below there.” It must have been manifest that from
their point of view their complaints were well founded, and the official, who
afterwards gave an account of the affair to the authorities, was persuaded of
this. “ We went to hear them, and they spoke true words to us.” ® For the
most part these strikes had no other consequence than a prolonged stoppage
of work, until the distribution of rations at the beginning of the next month
gave the malcontents courage to return to their tasks. Attempts were made
to prevent the recurrence of these troubles by changing the method and time
of payments. These were reduced to an interval of fifteen days, and at length,
indeed, to one of eight.® The result was very much the same as before : the
workman, paid more frequently, did not on that account become more prudent,
and the hours of labour lost did not decrease. The individual man, if he had
had nobody to consider but himself, might have put up with the hardships
of his situation, but there were almost always wife and children or sisters con
<;erned, who clamoured for bread in their hunger, and all the while the store
houses of the temples or those of the state close by were filled to overflowing
with durrah, barley, and wheat.^ The temptation to break open the doors and to
of tliese disorders have been given by Maspero, La Vie populaire a Thebes, of which a summary was l)ublished in the Bulletin du Cercle Ristorique, 1883, pp. 68-71, Lectures Historigues, pp. 34-38, and by Spiegelberg, Arheiter und Arheiterheivegung itn Fharaonenreicli, pp. 17-23.

help themselves in the present necessity must have been keenly felt. Some
bold spirits among the strikers, having set out together, scaled the two or three
boundary walls by which the granaries were protected, but having reached'
this position their heart failed them, and they contented themselves with
sending to the chief custodian an eloquent pleader, to lay before him their
very humble request : “ We are come, urged by famine, urged by thirst*
having no more linen, no more oil, no more fish, no more vegetables. Send
to Pharaoh, our mastei’, send to the king, our lord, that he may provide
us with the necessaries of life.”^ If one of them, with less self-restraint, was
so carried away as to let drop an oath, which was a capital olfence, saying,
‘‘ By Amon ! by the sovereign, whose anger is death ! ” if he asked to be taken
before a magistrate in order that he might reiterate there his complaint, the
others interceded for him, and begged that he might escape the punishment
fixed by the law for blasphemy ; the scribe, good fellow as he was, closed his
ears to the oath,^ and, if it were in his power, made a beginning of satisfying
their demands by drawing upon the excess of past months to such an extent
as would pacify them for some days, and by paying them a supplemental wage
in the name of the Pharaoh.^ d'hey cried out loudly : “ Shall there not be
served out to us corn in excess of that which has been distributed to us ; if
not we will not stir from this spot ? ” At length the end of the month
arrived, and they all appeared together before the magistrates, when tliey said r
“ Let the scribe, Khamoisit, who is accountable, be sent for ! ” He was there
upon brought before the notables of the town, and they said to him : “ See
to the corn which thou hast received, and give some of it to the people of
the necropolis.” Pmontuniboisit was then sent for, and “ rations of wheat were
given to us daily.” Famine was not caused only by the thriftlessness of the
multitude : administrators of all ranks did not hesitate to appropriate, each
one according to his position, a portion of the means entrusted to them for the
maintenance of their subordinates, and the latter often received only instal
ments of what was due to them. The culprits often escaped from their diffi
culties by either laying hold of half a dozen of their brawling victims, or by
yielding to them a proportion of their ill-gotten gains, before a rumour of
the outbreak could reach head-quarters. It happened from time to time,
however, when the complaints against them were either too serious or too
frequent, that they were deprived of their functions, cited before the tribunals,

and condemned. What took place at Thebes was repeated with some varia
tions in each of the other large cities. Corraptiou, theft, and extortion had
prevailed among the officials from time immemorial, and the most active
kings alone were able to repress these abuses, or confine them within narrow
limits ; ^ as soon as discipline became relaxed, however, they began to appear
again, and we have no more convincing proof of the state of decadence
into which Thebes had fallen towards the middle of the dynasty, than
the audacity of the crimes committed in the necropolis during the reigns of
the successors of Kamses III.
The priesthood of Ainon alone displayed any vigour and enjoyed any
prosperity in the general decline. After the victory of the god over the
heretic kings no one dared to dispute his supremacy, and the Ramessides
displayed a devout humility before him and his ministers.^ Henceforward
he became united to Ea in a deflnite manner, and his authority not only
extended over the whole of the land of Egypt, but over all the countries also
which were brought within her influence ; so that while Pharaoh continued to
be the greatest of kings. Pharaoh’s god held a position of undivided supremacy
among the deities. He was the chief of the two Enneads, the Heliopolitan and
the Hermopolitan, and displayed for the latter a special affection ; for the
vague character of its eight secondary deities only served to accentuate the
position of the ninth and principal divinity with whose primacy that of Amon
was identified. It was more easy to attribute to Amon the entire work of
creation when Shu, Sibu, Osiris, and Sit had been excluded—the deities whom
the theologians of Heliopolis had been accustomed to associate with the demi
urge ; and in the hymns which they sang at his solemn festivals they did not
hesitate to ascribe to him all the acts which the priests of former times had
assigned to the Ennead collectively. “ He made earth, silver, gold,—the true
lapis at his good pleasure.^—He brought forth the herbs for the cattle, the
plants upon which men live. — He made to live the fish of the river, —the birds
which hover in the air, —giving air to those which are in the egg. —He animates

branch. —May he be blessed for all this, he who is alone, but with many hands.”^
“ Men spring from his two eyes,” ^ and quickly do they lose their breath while
acclaiming him—Egyptians and Libyans, Negroes and Asiatics ; “ Hail to
thee ! ” they all say ; “ praise to thee because thou dwellest amongst us !
Obeisances before thee because thou createst us ! ”—“ Thou art blessed by
every living thing,—thou hast worshippers in every place, — in the highest of
the heavens, in all the breadth of the earth, —in the depths of the seas. — The
gods bow before thy Majesty,— magnifying the souls which form them,— rejoic
ing at meeting those who have begotten them,—they say to thee : ‘ Go in
peace,—father of the fathers of all the gods,— who suspended the heaven,
levelled the earth ; — creator of beings, maker of things, —sovereign king, chief
of the gods,—we adore thy souls, because thou hast made us,— we lavish
offerings upon thee, because thou hast given us birth,— we shower benedictions
upon thee, because thou dwellest among us.’”® We have here the same ideas
as those which predominate in the hymns addressed to Atonu,^ and in the
prayers directed to Phtah, the Nile, Shu, and the Sun-god of Heliopolis at the
same period.® The idea of a single god, lord and maker of all things, con
tinued to prevail more and more throughout Egypt—not, indeed, among the
lower classes who persisted in the worship of their genii and their animals, but
among the royal family, the priests, the nobles, and people of culture. The
latter believed that the Sun-god had at length absorbed all the various beings
who had been manifested in the feudal divinities; these, in fact, had sur
rendered their original characteristics in order to become forms of the Sun,
Amon as well as the others — and the new belief displayed itself in magni
fying the solar deity, but the solar deity united with the Theban Amon,

that is, Amon-Ra. The omnipotence of this one god did not, however, exclude
a belief in the existence of his compeers ; the theologians thought all the
while that the beings to whom ancient generations had accorded a complete
independence in respect of their rivals were nothing more than emanations
from one supreme being. If local pride forced them to apply to this single
deity the designation customarily used in their city—-Phtah at Memphis,
Anhuri-Shu at Thinis, Khnumu in the neighbourhood of the first cataract
they were quite willing to allow, at the same time, that these appellations
were but various masks for one face. Phtah, Hapi, Khnumu, Ea,—all the
gods, in fact,—were blended with each other, and formed but one deity
unique existence, multiple in his names, and mighty according to the impor
tance of the city in which he was worshipped. Hence Amon, lord of the
capital and patron of the dynasty, having more partisans, enjoyed more
respect, and, in a word, felt himself possessed of more claims to be the sole
god of Egypt than his brethren, who could not claim so many worshippers.
He did not at the outset arrogate to himself the same empire over the dead
as he exercised over the living ; he had delegated his functions in this respect
to a goddess, klaritsakro, for whom the poorer inhabitants of the left bank
entertained a persistent devotiond She was a kind of Isis or hospitable Hathoiv
whose subjects in the other world adapted themselves to the nebulous and
dreary existence provided for their disembodied “ doubles.” The Osirian and
solar doctrines were afterwards blended together in this local mythology, and
from the XI*'’ dynasty onwards the Theban nobility had adopted, along with
the ceremonies in use in the Memphite period, the Heliopolitan beliefs concerning
the wanderings of the soul in the west, its embarkation on the solar ship, and
its resting-places in the fields of lain. The rock-tombs of the XVIIP” dynasty
demonstrate that the Thebans had then no different concept of their life
beyond the world from that entertained by the inhabitants of the most ancient
cities : they ascribed to that existence the same inconsistent medley of contra
dictory ideas, from which each one might select what pleased him best— either
repose in a well-provisioned tomb, or a dwelling close to Osiris in the middle
of a calm and agreeable paradise, or voyages with Ea around the world.^ The
fusion of Ea and Amon, and the predominance of the solar idea which arose
from it, forced the theologians to examine more closely these inconsistent
notions, and to eliminate from them anything which might be out of harmony
* See what is said about this goddess and her cult, pp. 537, 538 of the present work. ^ Tlie Pyramid texts are found for the most part in the tombs of Nofiru (Maspero, La Pyramide dll roi Ounas, in tlie Recueil, vol. iii. pp. 201-210) and Harhotph (Maspero, Trois Annies de fouilles, in the, M^moires de la Mission, etc., vol. i. p. 137, et seq., 225-231, 236) ; the texts of the Book of the Dead are met with on the Theban coffins of the same period (Lepsius, ASlteste Texte, and Maspero, 'I'rois Annies de fouilles, in the M^moires de la Mission, vol. i. pp. 155-172, 177-180, 210-221).



AMON GOD OF THE DEAD. 545
with the new views. The devout servant of Amon, desirous of keeping in
constant touch with his god both here and in the other world, could not
imagine a happier future for his soul than in its going forth in the fulness of
light by day, and taking refuge by night on the very bark which carried the
object of his worship through the thick darkness of Hades. To this end he
endeavoured to collect the formulae which would enable him to attain to this
supreme happiness, and also inform him concerning the hidden mysteries of
that obscure half of the world in which the sun dwelt between daylight and
daylight, teaching him also how to make friends and supporters of the benevolent
genii, and how to avoid or defeat the monsters whom he would encounter. The
best known of the books relating to these mysteries contained a geographical
description of the future world as it was described by the Theban priests to
wards the end of the Eamesside period ; it was, in fact, an itinerary in which was
depicted each separate region of the underworld, with its gates, buildings, and
inhabitants.^ The account of it given by the Egyptian theologians did not exhibit
much inventive genius. They had started with the theory that the sun, after
setting exactly west of Thebes, rose again due east of the city, and they therefore
placed in the dark hemisphere all the regions of the universe which lay to the
north of those two points of the compass. The first stage of the sun’s journey,
after disappearing below the horizon, coincided with the period of twilight
the orb travelled along the open sky, diminishing the brightness of his fires
as he climbed northward, and did not actually enter the underworld till he
reached Abydos, close to the spot where, at the “ Mouth of the Cleft,” the souls
of the faithful awaited him. As soon as he had received them into his
boat, he plunged into the tunnel which there pierces the mountains, and the
cities through which he first passed between Abydos and the Fayilm were
known as the Osirian fiefs. He continued his journey through them for the
space of two hours, receiving the homage of the inhabitants, and putting such
of the shades on shore as were predestined by their special devotion for the Osiris

of Abydos and his associates, Horus and Anubis, to establish themselves in this
territory. Beyond Heracleopolis, he entered the domains of the Memphite
gods, the “ land of Sokaris,” and this probably was the most perilous moment
of his journey. The feudatories of Phtah were gathered together in grottoes,
connected by a labyrinth of narrow passages through which even the most fully
initiated were scarcely able to find their way ; the luminous boat, instead of
venturing within these catacombs, passed above them by mysterious tracks.
The crew were unable to catch a glimpse of the sovereign through whose realm
they journeyed, and they in like manner were invisible to him ; he could only
hear the voices of the divine sailors, aiid he answered them from the depth
of the darkness. Two hours were spent in this obscure passage, after which
navigation became easier as the vessel entered the nomes subject to the Osirises
of the Delta : four consecutive hours of sailing brought the bark from the
province in which the four principal bodies of the god slept to that in which
his four souls kept watch, and, as it passed, it illuminated the eight circles
reserved for men and kings who worshipped the god of Mendes. From the
tenth hour onwards it directed its course due south, and passed through
the Augarit, the place of fire and abysmal waters to which the Heliopolitans
consigned the souls of the impious ; then finally quitting the tunnel, it soared
up in the east with the first blush of dawn. Each of the ordinary dead was
landed at that particular hour of the twelve, which belonged to the god of his
choice or of his native town. Left to dwell there they suffered no absolute
torment, but languished in the darkness in a kind of painful torpor, from which
condition the approach of the bark alone was able to rouse them. They hailed
its daily coming with acclamations, and felt new life during the hour in which
its rays fell on them, breaking out into lamentations as the bark passed away
and the light disappeared with it. The souls who were devotees of the sun
escaped this melancholy existence ; they escorted the god, reduced though he
was to a mummied corpse, on his nightly cruise, and were piloted by him safe
and sound to meet the first streaks of the new day. As the boat issued from
the mountain in the morning between the two trees which flanked the gate
of the east, these souls had their choice of several ways of spending the day on
which they were about to enter. They might join their risen god in his course
through the hours of light, and assist him in combating Apophis and his accom
plices, plunging again at night into Hades without having even for a moment
quitted his side. They might, on the other hand, leave him and once more enter
the world of the living, settling themselves where they would, but always by
preference in the tombs where their bodies awaited them, and where they could
enjoy the wealth which had been accumulated there : they might walk within

the branches of the Bab el-Moluk valley, the plan of construction which they chose
was an exact copy of that employed by the Memphites and earlier Thebans,
and they hollowed out for themselves in the mountain-side a burying-place on
the same lines as those formerly employed within the pyramidal structure.
The relative positions of the tunnelled tombs along the valley were not deter
mined by any order of rank or of succession to the throne ;
^ each Pharaoh after
Kamses I. set to work on that part of the rock where the character of the stone
favoured his purpose, and displayed so little respect for his predecessors, that
the workmen, after having tunnelled a gallery, were often obliged to abandon it
altogether, or to change the direction of their excavations so as to avoid piercing
a neighbouring tomb.^ The architect’s design was usually a mere project
which could be modified at will, and which he did not feel bound to carry out
with fidelity ; the actual measurements of the tomb of Eamses IV. are almost
everywhere at variance with the numbers and arrangement of the working
drawing of it which has been preserved to us in a papyrus.^ The general
disposition of the royal tombs, however, is far from being complicated
we have at the entrance the rectangular door, usually surmounted by the sun,
represented by a yellow disk, before which the sovereign kneels with his hands
raised in the posture of adoration ; this gave access to a passage sloping gently
downwards, and broken here and there by a level landing and steps, leading
to a first chamber of varying amplitude, at the further end of which a second
passage opened which descended to one or more apartments, the last of which
contained the coffin. The oldest rock-tombs present some noteworthy ex
ceptions to this plan, particularly those of Seti I. and Kamses III ; ^ but
from the time of Ramses IV., there is no difference to be remarked in them
except in the degree of finish of the wall-paintings or in the length of the
passages. The shortest of the latter extends some fifty-two feet into the rock,
while the longest never exceeds three hundred and ninety feet. The same
artifices which had been used by the pyramid-builders to defeat the designs of
robbers® — false mummy-pits, painted and sculptured walls built across passages,
stairs concealed under a movable stone in the corner of a chamber—were also

employed by the Theban engineers. The decoration of the walls was suggested,
as in earlier times, by the needs of the royal soul, with this difference—that
the Thebans set themselves to render visible to his eyes by paintings that
which the Memphites had been content to present to his intelligence in writing,
so that the Pharaoh could now see what his ancestors had been able merely to
read on the walls of their tombs. Where the inscribed texts in the burial
chamber of Unas state that Unas, incarnate in the Sun, and thus representing
Osiris, sails over the waters on high or glides into the Elysian fields, the
sculptured or painted scenes in the interior of the Theban catacombs display
to the eye Ramses occupying the place of the god in the solar bark and in the
fields of lalu. Where the walls of Unas bear only the prayers recited over the
mummy for the opening of his mouth, for the restoration of the use of his
limbs, for his clothing, perfuming, and nourishment, we see depicted on those
of Seti I. or Ramses IV. the mummies of these kings and the statues of
their doubles in the hands of the priests, who are portrayed in the perform
ance of these various offices. The starry ceilings of the pyramids reproduce
the aspect of the sky, but without giving the names of the stars : on the
ceilings of some of the Ramesside rock-tombs, on the other hand, the con
stellations are represented, each with its proper figure, while astronomical
tables give the position of the heavenly bodies at intervals of fifteen days,
so that the soul could tell at a glance into what region of the firmament
the course of the bark would bring him each night. In the earlier Ramesside
tombs, under Seti I. and Ramses II., the execution of these subjects shows
evidence of a care and skill which are quite marvellous, and both figures
and hieroglyphics betray the hand of accomplished artists. But in the
tomb of Ramses III. the work has already begun to show signs of inferiority,
and the majority of the scenes are coloured in a very summary fashion ; a raw
yellow predominates, and the tones of the reds and blues remind us of a child’s
first efforts at painting. This decline is even more marked under the succeed
ing Ramessides; the drawing has deteriorated, the tints have become more
and more crude, and the latest paintings seem but a lamentable caricature of
the earlier ones.^
The courtiers and all those connected with the worship of Amon-Ra
priests, prophets, singers, and functionaries connected with the necropolis
shared the same belief with regard to the future world as their sovereign,
and they carried their faith in the sun’s power to the point of identifying
themselves with him after death, and of substituting the name of Ra for that
of Osiris;^ they either did not venture, however, to go further than this,

or were unable to introduce into their tombs all that we find in the Bab
el-Moluk. They confined themselves to writing briefly on their own coffins, or
confiding to the mummies of their fellow-believers, in addition to the “ Book
of the Dead,” a copy of the “Book of knowing what there is in Hades,
or of some other mystic writing which was in
-- harmony with their creed. Hastily
prepared copies of these were sold by
unscrupulous scribes, often badly written
and almost always incomplete, in which
were hurriedly set down haphazard
the episodes of the course of the sun
with explanatory illustrations. The
representations of the gods in them
are but little better than caricatures,
the text is full of faults and scarcely
decipherable, and it is at times
difficult to recognize the correspond
ence of the scenes and prayers
with those in the royal tombs.
Although Amon had become
the supreme god, at least for
this class of the initiated, he
was by no means the sole deity
worshipped by the Egyptians
the other divinities previously associated with him still held their own beside
him, or were further defined and invested with a inore decided personality. The
goddess regarded as his partner was at first represented as childless, in spite of
the name of Maut or Mut— the mother—by which she was invoked, and Amon
was supposed to have adopted Montii, the god of Hermonthis, in order to
complete his triad. IMontu, however, formerly the sovereign of the Theban
plain, and lord over Amon himself, was of too exalted a rank to play the
inferior part of a divine son. The priests were, therefore, obliged to fall back
upon a personage of lesser importance, named Khonsu, who up to that period
had been relegated to an obscure position in the celestial hierarchy. How
they came to identify him with the moon, and subsequently with Osiris and

supplementing Month, but finally supplanting him in the third place of the
Triad, From the time of Sesostris onwards, Theban dogma acknowledged
him alone side by side with Amon-Ra and Mut the divine mother.
It was now incumbent on the Pharaoh to erect to this newly made favourite
a temple whose size and magnificence should be worthy of the rank to which
his votaries had exalted him. To this end, Rainses III. chose a suitable site to
the south of the hypostyle hall of Karnak, close to a corner of the enclosing wall,
and there laid the foundations of a temple which his successors took nearly
a century to finish.^ Its proportions are by no means perfect, the sculpture
is wanting in refinement, the painting is coarse, and the masonry was so faulty,
that it was found necessary in several places to cover it with a coat of stucco
before the bas-reliefs could be carved on the walls ; yet, in spite of all this.
* It is possible that tins assimilation originated in the fact that Khonsh is derived from the verb
“khonsu,” to navigate : Kbonsu would thus have been he who crossed the heavens in his bark—that is, the moon-god (Brcgsch, JJe/jpiou und Mythologie der AJten Mgypter, pp. 117, 118); at Dawn of
Civilization, p. 507. ^ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Beato. “ The proof that the temple was founded by Eamses III. is furnished by the inscriptions of the sanctuary and the surrounding chambers ; cf. Lepsius, Denhm., iii. 207 h.

its general arrangement is so fine, that it may well be regarded, in preference
to other more graceful or magnificent buildings, as the typical temple of the
Theban period. It is divided into two parts, separated from each other by a
solid wall. In tlie centre
of the smaller of these is
placed the Holy of Holies,
which opens at both ends
into a passage ten feet in
width, isolating it from the
surrounding buildings. To
the right and left of the
sanctuary are dark chambers,
and behind it is a hall sup
ported by four columns, into
which open seven small
apartments. This formed
the dwelling-place of the
god and his compeers. The
sanctuary communicates, by
means of two doors placed
in the southern wall, with a
hypostyle hall of greater
width than depth, divided
by its pillars into a nave and
two aisles. The four columns
of the nave are twenty-three
,
, feet in height, and have
THE COURT OF THE TEMPLE OF KHONSU.' ° ’ bell-shaped capitals, while
those of the aisles, two on either side, are eighteen feet high, and are crowned
with lotiform capitals. The roof of the nave was thus five feet higher than
those of the aisles, and in the clear storey thus formed, stone gratings, similar
to those in the temple of Amon, admitted light to the building. The court
yard, surrounded by a fine colonnade of two rows of columns, was square, and
was entered by four side posterns in addition to the open gateway at the end
placed between two quadrangular towers. This pylon measures 104 feet in
length, and is 32 feet 6 inches wide, by 58 feet high. It contains no internal
chambers, but merely a narrow staircase which leads to the top of the door
way, and thence to the summit of the towers. Four long angular grooves

run up the facade of the towers to a height of about twenty feet from the
ground, and are in the same line with a similar number of square holes
which pierce the thickness of the building higher up. In these grooves
were placed Venetian masts, made of poles spliced together and held in their
place by means of hooks
and wooden stays which
projected from the four
holes ; these masts were
to carry at their tops
pennons of various colours.^
Such was the temple of
Khonsu, and the majority
of the great Theban build
ings—at Luxor, Qurneli,
the Kamesseum, or Medi
net-Habu—were constructed
on similar lines. Even
in their half-ruined con
dition there is something
oppressive and uncanny in
their appearance. The gods
loved to shroud themselves
in mystery, and, therefore,
the plan of the building
was so arranged as to
render the transition almost
imperceptible from the
blinding sunlight outside to the darkness of their retreat within. In the
courtyard, we are still surrounded by vast spaces to which air and light have
free access. The hypostyle hall, however, is pervaded by an appropriate
twilight, the sanctuary is veiled in still deeper darkness, while in the
chambers beyond reigns an almost perpetual night. The effect produced by
this gradation of obscurity was intensified by constructional artifices. The
different parts of the building are not all on the same ground-level, the
pavement rising as the sanctuary is approached, and the rise is concealed
by a few steps placed at intervals. The difference of level in the temple

of Khonsfi is not more than five
feet three inches, but it is com
bined with a still more considerable
lowering of the height of the roof.
From the pylon to the wall at the
further end the height decreases as
we go on ; the peristyle is more
lofty than the hypostyle hall, this
again is higher than the sanctuary
and the hall of columns, and the
chamber beyond it drops still further
in altitude.^
Karnak is an exception to this
rule ; this temple had in the course
of centuries undergone so many
restorations and additions, that it
formed a collection of buildings
rather than a single edifice. It
might have been regarded, as early
as the close of the Theban empire,
as a kind of museum, in which
every century and every period of
art, from the XIF” dynasty down
wards, had left its distinctive mark.^
All the resources of architecture
had been brought into requisi
tion during this period to vary,
at the will of each sovereign,
the arrangement and the general
effect of the component parts.

and lotiform capitals alternate with those of the bell-shape ; attempts
were even made to introduce new types altogether. The architect who
built at the back of the sanctuary what is now known as the colonnade of
Tutmosis III., attempted
to invert the bell-shaped
capital ; the bell was
turned downwards, and
the neck attached to the
plinth, while the mouth
rested on the top of the
shaft.^ This awkward
arrangement did not
meet with favour, for
we find it nowhere re
peated ; other artists,
however, with better
taste, sought at this
time to apply the flowers

Lower Egypt to the de
corations of the shafts.
In front of the sanctuary
of Karnak two pillars are
still standing which have

incongruous elements required frequent restoration—a wall which had been
undermined by water needed strengthening, a pylon displaying cracks claimed
attention, some unsafe colonnade, or a colossus w'hich had been injured by the
fall of a cornice, required shoring up—so that no sooner had the corvee for repairs
completed their work in one part, than they had to begin again elsewhere. The
revenues of Amon must, indeed, have been enormous to have borne the continual

drain occasioned by restoration, and the resources of the god would soon have
been exhausted had not foreign wars continued to furnish him during several
centuries with all or more than he needed. The gods had suffered severely in
the troublous times which had followed the reign of Seti II., and it required
all the generosity of Ramses III. to compensate them for the losses they
had sustained during the anarchy under Arish.^ The spoil taken from the
Libyans, from the Peoples of the Sea, and from the Hittites had flowed into
the sacred treasuries, while the able administration of the sovereign had done
the rest, so that on the accession of Ramses IV. the temples were in a more
prosperous state than ever.^ They held as their own property 169 towns, nine
of which were in Syria and Ethiopia ; they possessed 113,433 slaves of both
sexes, 493,386 head of cattle, 1,071,780 arurse of land, 514 vineyards and
orchards, 88 barks and sea-going vessels, 336 kilograms of gold both in
ingots and wrought, 2,993,964 grammes of silver, besides quantities of copper
and precious stones, and hundreds of storehouses in which they kept corn,
oil, wine, honey, and preserved meats —the produce of their domains. Two
examples will suffice to show the extent of this latter item : the live geese
reached the number of 680,714, and the salt or smoked fish that of 494,800.®
Amon claimed the giant share of this enormous total, and three-fourths of
it or more were reserved for his use, namely—86,486 slaves, 421,362 head of
cattle, 898,168 arureeoi cornland,433 vineyards and orchards, and 56 Egyptian
towns.^ The nine foreign towns all belonged to him, and one of them con
tained the temple in which he was worshipped by the Syrians whenever they
came to pay their tribute to the king’s representatives:® it was but just that
his patrimony should surpass that of his compeers, since the conquering Pharaohs
owed their success to him, who, without the co-operation of the other feudal
deities, had lavished victories upon them. His domain was at least five times
more considerable than that of Ra of Heliopolis, and ten times greater than
that of the Memphite Phtah,® and yet of old, in the earlier times of history,
’ Cf. what is said of the Syrian Arisu, supra, 440, 453. ^ The donations of Ramses III., or rather tlie total of the donations made to the gods by the predecessors of that Pharaoh, and confirmed and augmented by him, are enumerated at length in the Great Harris Papyrus, Birch’s edit., pis. 10-66. This information was first brought to notice by Erman, xEgypten und ASgyptisches Leben, etc., pp. 415, 416, and subsequently by Brugsch, Die Higyptologie, pp. 271-274. ^ An abridgement of these donations occupies seven large plates in the Great Harris Papyrus, Birch’s edit., pis. 67-74 ; cf.

THE REVENUES AND PRIESTHOOD OF AMON. 559
Ka and Phtah were reckoned the wealthiest of the Egyptian gods. It is
easy to understand the influence which a god thus endowed with the goods
of this world exercised over men in an age wlien the national wars had the
same consequences for the immortals as for their worshippers, and when
the defeat of a people was regarded as a proof of the inferiority of its
patron gods. The most victorious divinity became necessarily the wealthiest,
before whom all other deities bowed, and whom they, as well as their subjects,
were obliged to serve.
So powerful a god as Amon had but few obstacles to surmount before
becoming the national deity ; indeed, he was practically the foremost of the
gods during the Eamesside period, and was generally acknowledged as
Egypt’s representative by all foreign nations.^ His priests shared in the
prestige he enjoyed, and their influence in state affairs increased pro
portionately with his power. The chief of their hierarchy, however, did not
bear the high titles which in ancient times distinguished those of Memphis
and Heliopolis ; he was content with the humble appellation of first
prophet of Amon.^ He had for several generations been nominated by the
sovereign, but he was generally chosen from the families attached hereditarily
or otherwise to the temple of Karnak, and must previously have passed
through every grade of the priestly hierarchy. Those who aspired to this
honour had to graduate as “ divine fathers ;
” this was the first step in the
initiation, and one at which many were content to remain, but the more
ambitious or favoured advanced by successive stages to the dignity of third,
and then of second, prophet before attaining to the highest rank.^ The
Pharaohs of the dynasty jealously supervised the promotions made in
the Theban temples, and saw that none was elected except him who was devoted
to their interests—such as, for example, Baukuui-khonsu and Unnofri under
' From the XVIIP*' dynasty, at least, the first prophet of Amon had taken the precedence of the high priests of Heliopolis and Memphis, as is proved by the position he occupies in the Egyptian hierarchy in the Hood Pap2/rMs; cf. Maspero, Etudes Egijptiennes, vol. ii. pp. 33-35, and Brugsch, Die AUgijptologie, pp. 217, 218. * Maspero, Etudes Egyptiennes, vol. ii. pp. 53-55, where the fact and the consequences entailed by it are pointed out for the first time. ^ What we know on this subject has been brought to light mainly by the inscriptions on the statue of Baukuni-Khonsfi at Munich, published and commented on by Deveria, Monument biographique de Bakenhhonsou, grand pretre d’ Ammon et arcliitecte principal de Thebes, eontemporain de * Mo'ise, in the M^moires de I’Institut Egyptien, vol. i. pp. 701-754 (cf. M^moires et Fragments, vol. i. pp. 275-324), and by Lauth, Der Hohepriester und Oberbaumeister Bokenohons, ein Zeitgenosse Mosis, in the Zeitschrift der Morgenl. Gesellschaft, vol. xvii. Brugsch at first thought that the personage thus chosen was submitted to frequent re-elections {Eecueil de Monuments, vol. i. p. 39) ; his opinion has been refuted by A. Baillet, De V Election et de la dur^e des fonctions du Grand-Pretre d' Ammon a Thebes, in the Revue Arche'ologique, 1863, vol. vii. ; cf. Erman, ASgypten und Mgyptisches Leben, p. 397, et seq., and Brugsch, Die ZEgyptologie, pp. 275-278. The cursus honorum of Eam^ shows us that he was first third, then second prophet of Amon, before being raised to the pontificate in the reign of Minephtah.



560 THE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
Kamses II.^ Baukuni-khonsu distinguished himself by his administrative
qualities ; if he did not actually make the plans for the hypostyle hall at
Karnak, he appears at least to have superintended its execution and decoration.
He finished the great pylon, erected the obelisks and gateways, built the
lari or vessel of the god, and found a further field for his activity on the
opposite bank of the Nile, where he helped to complete both the chapel
at Qurneh and ulso the Eamesseum. Eamses II. had always been able to
make his authority felt by the high priests who succeeded Baukuni-khonsu,
but the Pharaohs who followed him did not hold the reins with such a strong
hand. As early as the reigns of Minephtah and Seti II. the first pi’ophets,
Eai and Eama, claimed the right of building at Karnak for their own
purposes, and inscribed on the walls long inscriptions in which their own
panegyrics took precedence of that of the sovereign ; they even aspired to a
religious hegemony, and declared themselves to be the “chief of all the
prophets of the gods of the South and North.” ^ We do not know what became
of them during the usurpation of Arisu, but Nakhtu-ramses, son of Miribastit,
who filled the office during the reign of Eamses III., revived these ambitious
projects as soon as the state of Egypt appeared to favour them. The king,
however pious he might be, was not inclined to yield up any of his authority,
even though it were to the earthly delegate of the divinity whom he reverenced
before all others; the sons of the Pharaoh were, however, more accommodating,
and Naklitu-ramses played his part so well that he succeeded in obtaining from
them the reversion of the high priesthood for his son Amenothes. The
priestly office, from having been elective, was by this stroke suddenly made
hereditary in the family.^ The kings preserved, it is true, the privilege
of confirming the new appointment, and the nominee was not considered
properly qualified until he had received his investiture from the sovereign.^
Practically the Pharaohs lost the power of choosing one among the sons of
the deceased pontiff ; they were forced to enthrone the eldest of his survivors,
and legalise his accession by their approbation, even when they would have
preferred another. It was thus that a dynasty of vassal High Priests came to
be established at Thebes side by side with the royal dynasty of the Pharaohs.

NAKHTU-BAMSES AND AMENOTHES. 561
Nabhtu-ramses and Amenothes lived to a great age—from the reign of
Ramses III. to that of Ramses X., at the least ; they witnessed the accession
of nine successive Pharaohs, and the unusual length of their pontificates no
doubt increased the already extraordinary prestige which they enjoyed through
out the length and breadth of Egypt. It seemed as if the god delighted
to prolong the lives of his representatives beyond the ordinary limits, while
shortening those of the temporal sovereigns.^ When the reigns of the Pharaohs
began once more to reach their normal length, the authority of Amenothes
had become so firmly established that no human power could withstand it,
and the later Ramessides were merely a set of puppet kings who were ruled
by him and his successors. Not only was there a cessation of foreign expedi
tions, but the Delta, Memphis, and Ethiopia were alike neglected, and the
only activity displayed by these Pharaohs, as far as we can gather from their
monuments, was confined to the service of Amon and Khonsu at Thebes. The
lack of energy and independence in these sovereigns may not, however, be
altogether attributable to their feebleness of character ; it is possible that they
would gladly have entered on a career of conquest had they possessed the means.
It is always a perilous matter to allow the resources of a country to fall into the
hands of a priesthood, and to place its military forces at the same time in the
hands of the chief religious authority.^ The warrior Pharaohs had always had
at their disposal the spoils obtained from foreign nations to make up the deficit
which their constant gifts to the temples were making in the treasury. The
sons of Ramses III., on the other hand, had suspended all military efforts,
without, however, lessening their lavish gifts to the gods, and they must, in the
absence of the spoils of war, have drawn to a considerable extent upon the
ordinary resources of the country ; their successors therefore found the treasury
impoverished, and they would have been entirely at a loss for money had
they attempted to renew the campaigns or continue the architectural work
of their forefathers. The priests of Amon had not as yet suffered materially
from this diminution of revenue, for they possessed property throughout
the length and breadth of Egypt, but they were obliged to restrict their
expenditure, and employ the sums formerly used for the enlarging of the
temples on the maintenance of their own body. Meanwhile public works
had been almost everywhere suspended; administrative discipline became
relaxed, and disturbances, with which the police were unable to cope,
were increasing in all the important towns. Nothing is more indicative of
the state to which Egypt was reduced, under the combined influence of the

priesthood and the Ramessides, than the thefts and pillaging of which the
Theban necropolis was then the daily scene. The robbers no longer confined
themselves to plundering the tombs of private persons ; they attacked the royal
burying - places, and their depredations
were carried on for years before they were
discovered. In the reign of Eamses IX.,
an inquiry, set on foot by Amenothes, re
vealed the fact that the tomb of Sovkum
sauf I. and his wife. Queen Nubkhas, had
been rified, that tliose of Amenothes I. and
of Antuf IV. had been entered by tunnelling,
and that some dozen other royal tombs in
the cemetery of Drab abu’l Neggah were
threatened.^ The severe means taken to
suppress the evil were not, however, suc
cessful ; the pillagings soon began afresh,
and the reigns of the last three E-amessides
were marked by a struggle between the
robbers and the authorities, in which the
latter did not always come off triumphant. A system of repeated inspections
secured the valley of Biban el-Moluk from marauders,^ but elsewhere the
measures of defence employed were unavailing, and the necropolis was given
over to pillage, although both Amenothes and Hrihor had used every effort
to protect it. Hrihor appears to have succeeded immediately after Ameno
thes, and his accession to the pontificate gave his family a still more exalted

position in the country. As his wife Nozmit was of royal blood, he assumed
titles and functions to which his father and grandfather had made no claim.^
He became the “Royal Son” of Ethiopia and commander-in-chief of the
national and foreign troops ; he engraved
his name upon the monuments he decorated,
side by side with that of Ramses XII.
in short, he possessed all the characteristics
of a Pharaoh except the crown and the
royal protocol. A century scarcely had
elapsed since the abdication of Ramses
III., and now Thebes and the whole of
Egypt owned two masters : one the em
bodiment of the ancient line, but a mere
nominal king ; the other the representative
of Amon, and the actual ruler of the
country.^
What then happened when the last
Ramses who bore the kingly title was
gathered to his fathers? The royal lists
record the accession after his death of a
new dynasty of Tanitic origin, whose founder was Xsbindidi or Smendes;^
but, on the other hand, we gather from the Theban monuments that the crown
was seized by Hrihor, who reigned over the southern provinces contem
poraneously with Smendes. Hrihor boldly assumed as prenomen his title
of “ First Prophet of Amon,” and his authority was acknowledged by Ethiopia,
over which he was viceroy, as well as by the nomes forming the temporal domain
of the high priests. The latter had acquired gradually, either by marriage
or inheritance, fresh territory for the god, in the lands of the princes of Nek
habit, Koptos, Akhmim, and Abydos, besides the domains of some half-dozen

564 THE CLOSE OF THE THEBAN EMPIRE.
feudal houses who, from force of circumstances, had become sacerdotal families
the extinction of the direct line of Ramessides now secured the High Priests the
possession of Thebes itself, and of all the lands within the southern provinces
which were the appanage of the crown. They thus, in one way or another,
became the exclusive masters of the southern half of the Nile valley, from
Elephantine to Siut ; beyond Siut also they had managed to acquire suzerainty
over the town of Khobit, and the territory belonging to it formed an isolated
border province in the midst of the independent baronies.^ The representative
of the dynasty reigning at Tanis held the remainder of Egypt from Siut to
the Mediterranean—the half belonging to the Memphite Phtah and the Helio
politan Ea, as opposed to that assigned to Amon. The origin of this Tanite
sovereign is uncertain, but it would appear that he was of more exalted rank
than his rival in the south. The official chronicling of events was marked by
the years of his reign, and the chief acts of the government were carried out in
his name even in the Thebaid.^ Repeated inundations had caused the ruin of
part of the temple of Karnak, and it was by the order and under the auspices
of this prince that all the resources of the country w'ere employed to accomplish
the much-needed restoration.® It would have been impossible for him to have
exercised any authority over so rich and powerful a personage as Hrihor had he
not possessed rights to the crown, before which even the high priests of Amon
were obliged to bow, and hence it has been supposed that he was a descendant
of Ramses II. The descendants of this sovereign were doubtless divided into
at least two branches, one of which had just become extinct, leaving no nearer
heir than Hrihor, while another, of w'hich there were many ramifications, had)
settled in the Delta. The majority of these descendants had become mingled
with the general population, and had sunk to the condition of private indi
viduals ; they had, however, carefully preserved the tradition of their origin,
and added proudly to their name the qualification of royal son of Ramses.
They were degenerate scions of the Ramessides, and had neither the features
' The extent of the iiriucipality of Thebes under the high priests has been determined by meansof the sacerdotal titles of the Theban princesses, by Maspeko, Les Mamies royales de Deir el-Bahari, in tlie Me’moires de la Mission Fran^aise, vol. i. pp. 712-718. ^ I have pointed out that the years of the reign mentioned in the inscriptions of the high priestsand the kings of the sacerdotal line must be attributed to tlieir suzerains, the kings of Tanis (Maspeeo, op. cit, in the Me'inoires, vol. i. p. 723, et seq ). Hrihor alone seems to have been an exception, since to him are attributed the dates inscribed in the name of the King Siamon; M. Daressy, however, will not admit this, and asserts that this Siamon was a Tanite sovereign who must not be identified with Hrihor, and must be placed at least two or three generations later than the last of the Kamesside&

nor the energy of their ancestor.^ One of them, Zodphtahaufonkhi, whose
mummy was found at Deir el-Bahari, appears to have been tall and vigorous,
but the head lacks the haughty refinement which characterizes those of Seti I.
and Ramses IL, and the features are heavy and coarse, having a vulgar, common
place expression. It seems probable that one branch of the family,
endowed with greater capability than the rest, was settled at
Tanis, where Sesostris had, as we have seen, resided for many
years; Smendes was the first of this branch to ascend the
throne. The remembrance of his remote ancestor, Ramses II.,
which was still treasured up in the city he had corn
rebuilt, as well as in the Delta into which he
had infused new life, was doubtless of no small service in
securing the crown for his descendant, when, the line of
the Theban kings having come to an end, the Tanites put
in their claim to the succession. We are unable to dis
cover if war broke out between the two competitors, or if
they arrived at an agreement without a struggle ; but,
at all events, we may assume that, having divided
Egypt between them, neither of them felt himsell'
strong enough to overcome his rival, and contented
himself with the possession of half the empire, since
he could not possess it in its entirety. We may
fairly believe that Smendes had the greater right
to the throne, and, above all, the more effi(
army of the two, since, had it been other

The unity of Egypt was, to outward appearances, preserved, through the
nominal possession by Smendes of the suzerainty ; but, as a matter of fact, it had
ceased to exist, and the fiction of the two kingdoms had become a reality for the
first time within the range of history. Henceforward there were two Egypts,
governed by different constitutions and from widely remote centres. Theban
Egypt was, before all things, a community recognizing a theocratic government,
in which the kingly office was merged in that of the high priest. Separated
from Asia by the length of the Delta, it turned its attention, like the Pharaohs

of the VI*'‘ and XIP'‘ dynasties, to Ethiopia, and owing to its distance from the
Mediterranean, and from the new civilization developed on its shores, it became
more and more isolated, till at length it was reduced to a purely African state.
Northern Egypt, on the contrary, maintained contact with European and
Asiatic nations ; it took an interest in their future, it borrowed from them
to a certain extent whatever struck it as being useful or beautiful, and when
the occasion presented itself, it acted in concert with the Mediterranean
powers. There w'as an almost constant struggle between these two divisions
of the empire, at times breaking out into an open rupture, to end as often
in a temporary re-establishment of unity. At one time Ethiopia would
succeed in annexing Egypt, and again Egypt would seize some part of
Ethiopia ; but the settlement of affairs was never final, and the conflicting
elements, brought with difficulty into harmony, relapsed into their usual
condition at the end of a few years. A kingdom thus divided against itself
could never succeed in maintaining its authority over those provinces which,
even in the heyday of its power, had proved impatient of its yoke. Asia was
associated henceforward in the minds of the Egyptians with painful memories
of thwarted ambitions, rather than as offering a field for present conquest. They
were pursued by the memories of their former triumphs, and the very monu
ments of their cities recalled what they were anxious to forget. Wherever they
looked within their towns they encountered the representation of some Asiatic
scene; they read the names of the cities of Syria on the walls of their temples
they saw depicted on them its princes and its armies, whose defeat was re
corded by the inscriptions as well as the tribute which they had been forced
to pay. The sense of their own weakness prevented the Egyptians from
passing from useless regrets to action ; when, however, one or other of the
Pharaohs felt sufficiently secure on the throne to carry his troops far afield,
he was always attracted to Syria, and crossed her frontiers, often, alas 1
merely to encounter defeat.

flRIE cessation of Egyptian authority over countries
in which it had so long prevailed did not at
once do away with the deep impression which it
had made upon their constitution and customs.
While the nobles and citizens of Thebes were
adopting the imported worship of Baal and Astarte,
and were introducing into the spoken and written
language words borrowed from Semitic speech,^ the
Syrians, on the other hand, were not unrecep)tive of
the influence of their conquerors. They had applied
themselves zealously to the study of Egyptian arts,
industry, and religion, and had borrowed from these
as much, at least, as they had lent to the dwellers
on the Nile. The ancient Babylonian foundation
of their civilization was not, indeed, seriously modified, but it was covered

over, so to speak, with an African veneer which varied in depth according
to the locality.^ Phoenicia especially assumed and retained this foreign
exterior. Its merchants, accustomed to establish themselves for lengthened
periods in the principal trade-centres on the Nile, had become imbued therein
with something of the religious ideas and customs of the land,^ and on
returning to their own country had imported these with them and propagated
them in their neighbourhood. They were not content
with other household utensils, furniture, and jewel
lery than those to which they had been accustomed
on the Nile, and even the Phoenician gods seemed
to be subject to this appropriating mania, for
they came to be recognised in the indigenous
deities of the Said and the Delta. There was, at the
outset, no trait in the character of Baalat by which
she could be assimilated to Isis or Hathor: she
was fierce, w^arlike, and licentious, and wept for
her lover, while the Egyptian goddesses were
accustomed to shed tears for their husbands only.^
It was this element of a common grief, however,
THE THEE GROWING ON THE served to associate the Phoenician and Egyp
tian goddesses, and to produce at length a strange
blending of their persons and the legends concerning them : the lady of
Byblos ended in becoming an Isis or a Hathor,® and in playing the part
assigned to the latter in the Osirian drama. This may have been occasioned
by her city having maintained closer relationships than the southern towns
with Buto and Mendes, or by her priests having come to recognise a funda
mental agreement between their theology and that of Egypt. In any case, it
was at Byblos that the most marked and numerous, as well as the most ancient,
examples of borrowing from the religions of the Nile were to be found. The
theologians of Byblos imagined that the coffin of Osiris, after it had been
thrown into the sea by Typhon, had been thrown up on the land somewhere

EGYPTIAN MYTHS IN PECENICIA. 571
near their city at the foot of a tamarisk, and that this tree, in its rapid growth,
had gradually enfolded within its trunk the body and its case. King Mal
kander cut it down in order to use it as a support for the roof of his palace : a
marvellous perfume rising from it filled the apartments, and it was not long
before the prodigy was bruited abroad. Isis, who was travelling through the
world in quest of her husband, heard of it, and at once realised its meaning :
clad in rags and weeping, she sat down by the well whither the women of Byblos
were accustomed to come every morning and evening to draw water, and, being
interrogated by them, refused to reply ; but when the maids of Queen Astarte ^
approached in their turn, they were received by the goddess in the most
amiable manner-—Isis deigning even to plait their hair, and to communicate
to them the odour of myrrh with which she herself was impregnated. Their
mistress came to see the stranger who had thus treated her servants, took her
into her service, and confided to her the care of her lately born son. Isis
became attached to the child, adopted it for her own, after the Egyptian
manner, by inserting her finger in its mouth ; ^ and having passed it through
the fire during the night in order to consume away slowly anything of a
perishable nature in its body, metamorphosed herself into a swallow, and flew
around the miraculous pillar uttering plaintive cries. Astarte came upon
her once while she was bathing the child in the flame, and broke by her
shrieks of fright the charm of immortality. Isis was only able to reassure
her by revealing her name and the object of her presence there. She opened
the mysterious tree-trunk, anointed it with essences, and wrapping it in
precious cloths, transmitted it to the priests of Byblos, who deposited it
respectfully in their temple : she put the coffin which it contained on board
ship, and brought it, after many adventures, into Egypt.® Another tradition
asserts, however, that Osiris never found his way back to his country : he was
buried at Byblos, this tradition maintained, and it w'as in his honour that the
festivals attributed by the vulgar to the young Adonis were really celebrated.
A marvellous fact seemed to support this view. Every year a head of papyrus,
thrown into the sea at some unknown point of the Delta, was carried for six
days along the Syrian coast, buffeted by winds and waves, and on the seventh
’ Astarte is the name taken by the queen in the Phoenician version : the Egyptian counterpart
of the same narrative substituted for it Nemanous or Saosis; that is to say, the two principal forms
of Hathor the Hermopolitan NahmaMt and the Heliopolitan lusasit (see Dawn of Civilization, p. 104), avr-Q 5e ot Aar&prriv oi 5e ^aoicriv ol 5e No/ttaj'oOj/, orrep Sj'“E\A7)vej ^Adriva'ida TTpoarelwowi/ {De Iside et Osiride, § 15, edit. Paethey, p. 26). It would appear from the presence of these names
that there must have been in Egypt two versions at least of the Phoenician adventures of Isis —the
one of Hermopolitan and the other of Heliopolitan origin. “ Upon this detail in the legend, which the author of De Iside, etc., did not understand (§ 16, edit.
Paethey, p. 26), see supra, pp. 487, 488 ; Isis, in putting her finger in the mouth, was following the ordinary rite of adoption.

it and exhibited it solemnly to the peopled The
details of these different stories are not in every
case very ancient, but the first fact in them carries
us back to the time when Byblos had accepted
the sovereignty of the Theban dynasties, and was
maintaining daily commercial and political rela

city proclaimed Horus to be a great god.'* El
Kronos allied himself with Osiris as well as with
Adonis ; Isis and Baalat became blended to2:ether
at their first encounter, and the respective peoples
made an exchange of their deities with the same
^ light-heartedness as they displayed in traffickina:

After Osiris, the Ibis Thot was the most important among the deities
who had emigrated to Asia.^ He was too closely connected with the Osirian
cycle to be forgotten by the Phoenicians after they had adopted his com
panions. We are ignorant of the particular divinity with whom he was
identified, or would be the more readily associated from some similarity in
the pronunciation of his name : we know only that he still preserved in
* De Bed Syria, § 7. In the later Eoman period it was letters announcing the resurrection of
Adonis-Osiris that the Alexandrian women cast into the sea, and these were carried by the current as far as Byblos. See on this subject the commentaries of Cyril of Alexandria and Procopius of Gaza on chap, xviii. of Isaiah. “ It is worthy of note that Philo gives to the divinity with the Egyptian name Taautos the part in the ancient history of Phoenicia of having edited the mystic writings put in order by Sanchoniathon at a very early epoch {Fragm. 1, § 4, in Muller-Didot, Fragmenta Historicorum Grxcorum, vol. iii. pp. 563, 564). ^ This is confirmed by one of the names inscribed on the Tel el-Amarna tablets as being that of a governor of Byblos under Amenothes IV. This name was read Eabiinur (Delattre, Azirou, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1890-31, vol. xiii. pp. 219, 220), Anrabimur, or Ilrabimur (Hauevy, La Correspondance d’ AmCnophis 111., etc., in the Journal Asiatique, 1891, vol. xviii. pp. 171, 172), and finally llurabihur (Sayce, Patriarchal Palestine, p. 131) ; the meaning of it is, “Muru is the great god,” or “ Horus is the great god.” Muru is the name which we find in an appellation of a Ilittite king, Manrusaru, “ Mauru is king ” (cf. supra, p. 355, note 1). On an Aramajan cylinder in the British Museum, representing a god in Assyrian dress fighting with two griffins, there is the inscription “ Horkhu,” Harmakhis (M. de Vogue, Melanges d’Arclidologie Orientals, p. 127, and pi. vi..

had done at Thebes, Memphis, Thinis, and before the chief of each Helio
politan Ennead. He became the usual adviser of El-Kronos at Byblos, as
he had been of Osiris and Horus ; he composed charms
for him, and formulae which increased the warlike zeal
of his partisans ; he prescribed the form and insignia
of the god and of his attendant deities, and came
finally to be considered as the inventor of letters.^ The

the ancient world had been content from their origin.
Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, Arvad, had employed up to this period the most intricate
of these systems. Like most of the civilized nations of AVestern Asia, they had
conducted their diplomatic and commercial correspondence in the cuneiform
character impressed upon clay tablets. Their kings had had recourse to a Baby
lonian model for communicating to the Amenothes Pharaohs the expression
of their wishes or their loyalty ; we now behold them, after an interval of four
hundred years and more®— during which we have no examples of their
monuments—possessed of a short and commodious script, without the encum
brance of ideograms, determinatives, polyphony and syllabic sounds, such as
had fettered the Egyptian and Chaldman scribes, in spite of their cleverness in
dealing with them. Phonetic articulations were ultimately resolved into twenty
two sounds, to each of which a special sign was attached, which collectively
took the place of the hundreds or thousands of signs formerly required. This
was an alphabet, the first in point of time, but so ingenious and so pliable that
the majority of ancient and modern nations have found it able to supply all their

and Semites of all kinds, Persians and Hindus on the other. It must have
originated between the end of the XVIIP'^ and the beginning of the
dynasties, and the existence of Pharaonic rule in Phoenicia during this period
has led more than one modern scholar to assume that it developed under
Egyptian influenced Some affirm that it is traceable directly to the hieroglyphs.
while others seek for some intermediary in the shape of a cursive script,
and find this in the Hieratic writing, which contains, they maintain, proto
types of all the Phoenician letters. Tables have been drawn up, showing at a
glance the resemblances and differences which appear respectively to justify
or condemn their hypothesis. Perhaps the analogies would be more evident
a.nd more numerous if we were in possession of inscriptions going back nearer
to the date of origin.^ As it is, the divergencies are sufficiently striking to
' The hypothesis of an Egyptian origin, suggested casually by Champollion {Lettre a M. Bader, p. 80 ; cf. Salvolini, Analyse grammaticale de I’inscription de Rosette, p. 86, et seq.), has been ably dealt with by E. de Rouge' {Mdnoire sur Vorigine ^gijptienne de V Alphabet Plie'ntden, read at the Academy of Inscriptions and Belles-Lettres in 1859, criticised iu the Comptes Rendus, 1859, vol. iii. pp. 115-124, and published in 1874 by E. de Rouge). E. de Rouge' derives the alphabet from the Hieratic, and his identifications liave been accepted by Lauth (JJeher den AEgyptisclien Ursprung unserer Ruclistaben und Ziffern, iu the Sitzungsberiehte of the Academy of Sciences at Munich, 1867, vol. ii. pp. 84-124), by Brugsch (JJeber Rildung und Entwiclcclung der Sclirift, 1866), by P. Lenormant (Essai sur la propagation de VAlphabet Phdiidea dans I'Anden Monde, vol. i. pp. 85-97), and by Isaac Taylor (The Alphabet, vol. i.). Hale'vy would take it from the Egyptian hieroglyphics directly without the intervention of the Hieratic (Melanges d’Epigraphie et d' Archeologie Stfmitiques, pp. 168-183). The Egyptian origin, strongly contested of late, has been accepted by the majority of scholars; cf. Ph. Bergek, Histoire de V Ecriture dans V Antiquitd, pp. 115-122. “ Drawn by Paucher-Gudin, from a heliogravure in the Corpus Inscr. Semit., vol. i. pi. iv. This is the cup of the Baal of the Lebanon, mentioned iu the preceding page, note 3. ^ The table on the next page (575) contains the principal identifications proposed by E. de Rouge',
but varies from it in a few minor points. I derive the Phoenician from the hieratic and not
from n : the form is that which is used, in fact, to express the Semitic g in the names Megiddo and Gargamish, and a hieratic form in which the ring is reduced to a simple stroke like that of the Phoenician alphabet is common in all Egyptian epochs. The h, comes also from the which is easily explained, the Egyptians having but one sign and one sound for the g and It of Semitic speech : the Phoenicians must have taken two hieratic variants to make the two separate letters equivalent to their G and k. The appears tome to be derived from the Archaic form of the “ owl,” nud not from that with which E. de Rouge' identifies it, and which was more in use in Theban times.

which are attributed to the primitive inhabitants of the island.^ It is no easy
matter to get at the truth amid these conflicting theories. Two points only

and the ^ appear to me to be the same character, although I cannot say whether the former came from the latter or vice versa. I have preferred to use in my comparison the hieratic signs in the manuscripts of the XIX*'' dynasty, which is the period approximately of the beginning of Phoenician writing. The Greek alphabet is given merely to show the values of the Egyptian and Phoenician signs. * This position was taken up by Deecke, Die Ursprung des altsemitischen Alphabets aus der neuassyrischen Eeilschrift, in the Zeitsch. der D. Morgenl. Gesellscha/t, 1877, pp. 102-154, afterwards by Peters, The Babylonian Origin of the Phoenician Alphabet, in the Proceedings of the Bibl. Arch.

To return to the religion of the Phoenicians ; the foreign
deities were not content with obtaining a high place in
the estimation of priests and people ; they acquired such
authority over the native gods that they persuaded them
to metamorphose themselves almost completely into
Egyptian divinities. One finds among the majority of
them the emblems commonly used in the Pharaonic
temples, sceptres with heads of animals, head-dress like the
Pschent, the cnix ansata, the solar disk, and the winged
scarab.^ The lady of Byblos placed the cow’s horns upon
her head from the moment she became identified with
Hathor.^ The Baal of the neighbouring Arvad—^probably
a form of Eashuf— was still represented as standing
upright on his lion in order to traverse the high places :

figure of the god, both lion and mountain are given

disk floating above his head lends to him, it is
true, a Phoenician character, but the winged

to these metamorphosed gods was as much
changed as the deities themselves ; the
altars assumed something of the Egyptian

by the monuments which the Egyptians erected for their dead. The pyramids
which met their gaze, as soon as they liad reached the apex of the Delta,
must have far surpassed tlieir ideas of them, no matter how frequently they
may have been told about them,
and they must have been at a
loss to know why such a number of
stones should have been brought
together to cover a single corpse.
At the foot of these colossal
monuments, lying like a pack
of hounds asleep around their
master, the mastabas of the early
dynasties were ranged, half buried
under the sand, but still visible,
and still visited on certain days
by the descendants of their in
habitants, or by priests charged
with the duty of keeping them
up. Chapels of more recent
generations extended as a sort of

affording examples of the two archaic types combined —the mastabamore or less
curtailed in its proportions, and the pyramid with a more or less acute point.^
The majority of these monuments are no longer in existence, and only one of
them has come down to us intact— that which Amenotbes III. erected in the
Serapeum at Memphis in honour of an Apis which had died in his reign.
Phcenicians visiting the Nile valley must have carried back Avith them to their
native country a remembrance of this kind of burying-place, and have suggested
it to their architects as a model. One of the cemeteries at Arvad contains a
splendid specimen of this imported design.'^ It is a square tower some thirty
the Theban dynasties, as well as on a little wooden vessel, No. 292 in tlie Hoffmann Collection,. Antiques Eqyptiennes, p]). 84, 85.

Pietschmann (Geschichte der Plionizier, p. 196, note 2) thinks that the monument is not older than the Greek epoch, and it must be admitted that the cornice is not such as we usually meet with in Egypt in Theban times; nevertheless, the very marked resemblance to the Theban mastaba shows that it must have been directly connected with the Egyptian type which prevailed from the XYHI"' to the XX"' dynasties.

The spirit of imitation which we find in the religion and architecture of
Phoenicia is no less displayed in the minor arts, such as goldsmiths’ work,
sculpture in ivory, engraving on gems, and glass-making. The forms, de
signs, and colours are all rather those of Egypt than of Chaldaea. The many
hued glass objects, turned out by the manufacturers of the Said in millions,
furnished at one time valuable cargoes for the Phoenicians ; they learned at length
to cast and colour copies of these at home, and imitated their Egyptian models

SO successfully that classical antiquity was
often deceived by them.^ Their engravers,
while still continuing to employ cones
and cylinders of Babylonian form,
borrowed the scarab type also, and
made use of it on the bezils of rings,
the pendants of necklaces, and on
a kind of bracelet used partly for
ornament and partly as a protec
tive amulet. The influence of the
Egyptian model did not extend,
however, amongst the masses, and
we find, therefore, no evidence of it
in the case of common objects, such as
those of coarse sand or glazed earthen
ware. Egyptian scarab forms were thus confined to the rich, and the material
upon which they are found is generally some costly gem, such as cut and
polished agate, onyx, hiumatite, and lapis-lazuli.^ The goldsmiths did not
slavishly copy the golden and silver bowls which were imported from the
Delta ; they took their inspiration from the principles displayed in the orna
mentation of these objects, but they treated the subjects after their own manner,
grouping them afresh and blending them with new designs.^ The intrinsic
value of the metal upon which these artistic conceptions had been impressed
led to their destruction, and among the examples which have come down to us
I know of no object which can be traced to the period of the Egyptian con
quest. It was Theban art for the most part which furnished the Phoenicians
with their designs. These included the lotus, the papyrus, the cow standing
in a thicket and suckling her calf, the sacred bark, and the king threatening with
his uplifted arm the crowd of conquered foes who lie prostrate before him. The
king’s double often accompanied him on some of the original objects, impassive
and armed with the banner bearing the name of Horus. The Phoenician artist
modified this figure, which in its original form did not satisfy his ideas of
' Glass manufacture was carried to such a degree of perfection among the Phoenicians, that many ancient authors attributed to them the invention of glass (Pliny, Nat. Hist., v. § 17 ; cf. xxxvi. § 190). As to Phoenician glasswork, see Peerot-Chipiez, Hist, de VArt, etc., vol. iii. p. 733, et seq. ; and on the

human nature, by transforming it into a protective genius, who looks with
approval on the exploits of bis protege, and gathers together the corpses of
those be bas slain. Once these designs bad become current among tbe gold
smiths, they continued to be supplied for a long period, without much modi
fication, to the markets of the Eastern and Western worlds. Indeed, it was
natural that they should have taken a stereotyped form, when we consider that
tbe Phoenicians who employed them held continuous commercial relations with
the country whence they had come —a country of which, too, they recognised the
supremacy. Egypt in the Ramesside period was, as we have seen, distinguished
for the highest development of every branch of industry ; it had also a population
which imported and exported more raw material and more manufactured pro
ducts than any other. The small nation which acted as a commercial inter
mediary between Egypt and the rest of the world had in this traffic a steady
source of profit, and even in providing Egypt with a single article—for example,
bronze, or the tin necessary for its preparation—could realise enormous profits!
The people of Tyre and Sidon had been very careful not to alienate the good
will of such rich customers, and as long as the representatives of the Pharaoh
held sway in Syria, they had shown themselves, if not thoroughly trustworthy
vassals, at least less turbulent than their neighbours of Arvad and Qodshu.
Even when the feebleness and impotence of the successors of Ramses III.
relieved them from the obligation of further tribute, they displayed towards
their old masters such deference that they obtained as great freedom of trade
with the ports of the Delta as they had enjoyed in the past. They maintained
Avith these ports the same relations as in the days of their dependence, and
their ships sailed up the river as far as Memphis, and even higher, while the
Egyptian galleys continued to coast the littoral of Syria.^ An official report
addressed to Hrihor by one of the ministers of the Theban Amon, indicates at
one and the same time the manner in which these voyages were accomplished,
and the dangers to which their crews were exposed. Hrihor, who was still high
priest, was in need of foreign timber to complete some work he had in hand,
probably the repair of the sacred barks, and commanded the official above
mentioned to proceed by sea to Byblos, to King Zikarbal,^ in order to purchase
cedars of Lebanon. The me.ssenger started from Tanis, coasted along Kharu,

sailors ran away with the

Badilu,^ expressed at first
his sympathy at this misfor
tune, and gave his help to
capture the robber ; then
unaccountably changing his
mind he threw the messenger
into prison, who had accordingly
to send to Egypt to procure fresh
funds for his liberation and the accom
plishment of his mission. Having
arrived at By bios, nothing occurred
there worthy of record. The wood • '

by contrary winds, the vessel was thrown upon the coast of Alasia, where the crew

where, it may be stated, as to the friendly disposition displayed, either with or
without the promptings of interest, towards the representative of the Theban
pontiff. Had he been ill-used, the Phoenicians living on Egyptian territory
would have been made to suffer for it.
Navigators had to take additional precautions, owing to the presence of
JEigeaxi or Asiatic pirates on the routes followed by the mercantile marine, which
rendered their voyages dangerous and sometimes interrupted them altogether.

584 THE EISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
The Syrian coast-line was exposed to tliese marauders quite as much as the
African had been during the sixty or eighty years which followed the death of
Eamses 11. ; the seamen of the north—Achaeans and Tyrseni, Lycians and Shar
danians—had pillaged it on many occasions, and in the invasion which followed
these attacks it experienced as little mercy as Naharaim, the Khati, and the
region of the Amorites. The fleets which carried the Philistines, the Zakkala,.
and their allies had devastated the whole coast before they encountered the
Egyptian ships of Kamses III. near Magadil, to the south of Carmel. Arvad
as well as Zahi had succumbed to the violence of their attack, and if the cities
of Byblos, Berytus, Sidon, and Tyre had escaped, their suburbs had been
subjected to the ravages of the foe.^ Peace followed the double victory of the
Egyptians, and commerce on the Mediterranean resumed once more its wonted
V ays, but only in those regions where the authority of the Pharaoh and the fear
of his vengeance were effective influences. Beyond this sphere there were
continual warfare, piracy, migrations of barbaric hordes, and disturbances of all
kinds, among which, if a stranger ventured, it was at the almost certain risk of
losing his life or liberty. The area of undisturbed seas became more and more
contracted in proportion as the memory of past defeats faded away. Cyprus
was not comprised within it, and the ^Bgeans, who were restrained by the fear
of Egypt from venturing into any region under her survey, perpetually flocked
thither in numerous bodies. The Achaeans, too, took up their abode on this
island at an early date— about the time when some of their bands were infest
ing Libya, and offering their help to the enemies of the Pharaoh. They
began their encroachments on the northern side of the island — the least rich, it
is true, but the nearest to Cilicia, and the easiest to hold against the attacks of
their rivals.^ The disaster of Piriu had no doubt dashed their hopes of finding
a settlement in Egypt : ^ they never returned thither any more, and the current
of emigration which had momentarily inclined towards the south, now set
steadily towards the east, where the large island of Cyprus offered an unpro
tected and more profitable field of adventure. We know not how far they
penetrated into its forests and its interior. The natives began, at length,
under their influence, to despise the customs and mode of existence with which
they had been previously contented : they acquired a taste for pottery rudely
decorated after the Mycenean manner, for jewellery, and for the bronze swords
which they had seen in the hands of the invaders. The Phoenicians, in order to

raaintain their ground against the intruders, had to strengthen their ancient
posts or found others—such as Carpasia, Cerynia, and Lapathos on the Achaean
coast itself, Tam assos near the copper-mines, and a new town, Qart-hadashat, which
is perhaps only the ancient Citium under a new named They thus added to their
earlier possessions on the island regions on its northern side, while the rest either
fell gradually into the hands of Hellenic adventurers, or continued in the posses
sion of the native populations. Cyprus served henceforward as an advance-post
against the attacks of Western nations, and the Phoenicians must have been
thankful for the good fortune which had made them see the wisdom of fortifying
it. But what became of their possessions lying outside Cyprus ? They retained
several of them on the southern coasts of Asia Minor, and Ehodes remained
faithful to them, as well as Thasos, enabling them to overlook the two extremities
of the Archipelago ; ^ but, owing to tlie movements of the People of the Sea and
the political development of the Mycenean states, they had to give up the
stations and harbours of refuge which they held in the other islands or on
the continent. They still continued, however, to pay visits to these localities
sometimes in the guise of merchants and at others as raiders, according to their
ancient custom. They went from port to port as of old, exposing their wares
in the market-places, pillaging the farms and villages, carrying into captivity
the women and children whom they could entice on board, or whom they might
find defenceless on the strand ; but they attempted all this with more risk than
formerly, and with less success. The inhabitants of the coast were possessed of
fully manned ships, similar in form to those of the Philistines or the Zakkala,
which, at the first sight of the Phcenicians, set out in pursuit of them, or,
following the example set by their foe, lay in wait for them behind some
headland, and retaliated upon them for their cruelty. Piracy in the Archipelago
was practised as a matter of course, and there was no islander who did not give
himself up to it when the opportunity offered, to return to his honest occu
pations alter a successful venture. Some kings seem to have risen up here
and there who found this state of afiairs intolerable, and endeavoured to
remedy it by every means within their power ; they followed on the heels of
the corsairs and adventurers, whatever might be their country ; they followed
them up to their harbours of refuge, and became an effective police force in

Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies t pp. 292-294). 2 This would appear to be the case, as far as Ehodes is concerned, from the traditions which ascribed the final expulsion of the Phoenicians to a Doric invasion from Argos; cf. Thucydides,. viii. 57, 'Po§ioi ’ApyeToi yei/os. The somewhat legendary accounts of the state of affairs after the Hellenic conquest are in the fragments of Ergias and Polyzelos (Muller-Didot, Fragm. Hist. Grxc.,. vol. iv. pp. 405, 406, 481).



586 THE BISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
all parts of the sea where they were able to carry their flag. The memory of
such exploits was preserved in the tradition of the Cretan empire which Minos
had constituted, and which extended its protection over a portion of continental
Greece.
If the Phcenicians had had to deal only with the piratical expeditions of
the peoples of the coast or with the jealous watchfulness of the rulers of the
sea, they might have endured the evil, but they had now to put up, in addition,
with rivalry in the artistic and industrial products of which they had long had
the monopoly. The spread of art had at length led to the establishment of
local centres of production everywhere, which bade fair to vie with those of
Phoenicia. On the continent and in the Cyclades there were produced statuettes,
intaglios, jewels, vases, weapons, and textile fabrics which rivalled those of
the East, and were probably much cheaper. The merchants of Tyre and
Sidon could still find a market, however, for manufactures requiring great
technical skill or displaying superior taste— such as gold or silver bowls, en
graved or decorated with figures in outline—but they had to face a serious
falling off in their sales of ordinary goods.^ To extend their commerce they
had to seek new and less critical markets, where the bales of their wares,
• of which the .iEgean population was becoming weary, would lose none of
their attractions. We do not know at what date they ventured to sail
into the mysterious region of the Hesperides, nor by what route they first
reached it. It is possible that they passed from Crete to Cythera, and
from this to the Ionian Islands and to the point of Calabria, on the other
side of the straits of Otranto, whence they were able to make their way
gradually to Sicily. “ Did the fame of their discovery, we may ask, spread so
rapidly in the East as to excite there the cupidity and envy of their rivals ?
However this may have been, the People of the Sea, after repeated checks in
Africa and Syria, and feeling more than ever the pressure of the northern tribes
encroaching on them, set out towards the west, following the route pursued
by the Phcenicians. The traditions current among them and collected after
wards by the Greek historians give an account, mingled with many fabulous
details, of the causes which led to their migrations and of the vicissitudes

Meyeh, GeschicMe des AUerthums, vol. ii. pp. 368-370, where a brief summary of all that is known on the subject is given ; for details, see Helbic, L'Epop^e hotMrique, translated by Trawinski, pp. 23, 24. 27, et seq. ® Ed. Meyer, op. cil., vol. i. pp. 235, 337-348, and vol. ii. pp. 90, 689-690, thinks that the extension of Phceuician commerce to the Western Mediterranean goes back to the XVIIP*' dynasty, or, at the latest, the XV"' century before our era. Without laying undue stress on this view, I am inclined to ascribe with him, until we get further knowledge, the colonisation of the West to the period immediately following the movements of the People of the Sea and the diminution of Phoenician trade in the Grecian Archipelago. Exploring voyages had been made before this, but the founding of colonies was not earlier than this epoch.



THE PH(ENICIANS IN TEE WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN. 587
which they experienced in the course of them. Daedalus having taken flight
from Crete to Sicily, Minos, who had followed in his steps, took possession of
the greater part of the island with his Eteocretes.^ lolaos was the leader of
Pelasgic bands, whom he conducted first into Libya and finally to Sardinia.^
It came also to pass that in the days of Atys, son of Manes, a famine broke out
and raged throughout Lydia : the king, unable to provide food for his people,
had them numbered, and decided by lot which of the two halves of the popu
lation should expatriate themselves under the leadership of his son Tyrsenos.
Those who were thus fated to leave their country assembled at Smyrna, con
structed ships there, and having embarked on board of them what was necessary,
set sail in quest of a new home. After a long and devious voyage, they at
length disembarked in the country of the Umbrians, where they built cities,
and became a prosperous people under the name of Tyrseni, being thus called
after their leader Tyrsenos.^ The remaining portions of the nations who had
taken part in the attack on Egypt— of which several tribes had been planted
by llamses III. in the Shephelah, from Gaza to Carmel —proceeded in a series
of successive detachments from Asia Minor and the ..iEgean Sea to the coasts
of Italy and of the large islands ; the Tursha into that region which was known
afterwards as Etruria, the Shardana into Sardinia, the Zakkala into Sicily, and
along with the latter some Pulasati, whose memory is still preserved on the
northern slope of Etna.^ Fate thus brought the Phcenician emigrants once
more into close contact with their traditional enemies, and the hostility which
they experienced in their new settlements from the latter was among the
influences which determined their further migration from Italy proper, and
from the region occupied by the Ligurians between the Arno and the Ebro.
‘ For the traditions of the colonisation of Sicily by Cretans, see Hock, Kreta, vol. i. pp. 372-391, and Holm, Geschichte Siciliens, vol. i. pp. 90, 91. [The Eteocretes are mentioned in the Odyssey,
xis. 175 . —Te.] ^ For the traditions as to the original inhabitants of Sardinia, see, with much reserve. Movers, Das Phonizische Alterthum, vol. ii. p. 562, et seq. ^ Herodotus, I. xciv., whence all the information of other classical writers is directly or indirectly taken. Most modern historians reject this tradition. I see no reason for my own part why they should do so, at least in the present state of our knowledge. The Etrurians of the historical period were the result of a fusion of several different elements, and there is nothing against the view
that the Tursha—one of these elemenis—-should have come from Asia Minor, as Herodotus says. Properly understood, the tradition seems well founded, and the details may have been added afterwards, either by the Lydians themselves, or by the Greek liistorians who collected the Lydian traditions. * This view was put forth by Maspeeo in the Revue Cntique, 1873, vol. i. pp, 84-86 ; 1878, vol. i, p.=320; 1880, vol. i. pp. 109, 110: for the contrary views, which make the tribes mentioned on the Egyptian monuments to have come from Italy and Sicily, see pp. 360, note 2 ; 364, 432, note 2, supra. The Pulasati of Sicily are known only from a passage in Appian : Mera Se toCto tV llaAaia-TTivwu yrjy fKeipe (Bell. Civ., V. cxvii.), which Cluvier and most geographers after him have corrected into tV ’ A^aKaivivwv yriv. Movers was the first to identify these Palestines of Sicily with the Philistines of Syria, and saw in them the remains of a Cretan coiony (Das Phiinizische Alterthum, vol. ii. pp. 318, 1319), and was followed with some reserve by Holm (Gesch. Siciliens, vol. i. pp. 91,376).



588 THE BISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
They had already probably reached Sardinia and Corsica, but the majority of
their ships had sailed to the southward, and having touched at Malta, Gozo,
and the small islands between Sicily and the Syrtes, had followed the coast-line
of Africa, until at length they reached the straits of Gibraltar and the
southern shores of Spaind No traces remain of their explorations, or of their
early establishments in the western Mediterranean, as the towns which they
are thought— with good reason in most instances—to have founded there
belong to a much later date. Every permanent settlement, however, is pre
ceded by a period of exploration and research, which may last for only a few
years or be prolonged to as many centuries. I am within the mark, I think,
in assuming that Phoenician adventurers, or possibly even the regular trading
ships of Tyre and Sidon, had established relations with the semi-barbarous
chiefs of B;etica as early as the XII'" century before our era, that is, at the
time when the power of Thebes was fading away under the weak rule of the
pontiffs of Amon and the Tanite Pharaohs.
The Phoenicians were too much absorbed in their commercial pursuits
to aspire to the inheritance which Egypt was letting slip through her
fingers. Their numbers were not more than sufficient to supply men for
their ships, and they were often obliged to have recourse to their allies or
to mercenary tribes—the Leleges or Carians—in order to provide crews for
their vessels or garrisons for their trading posts ;
^ it was impossible, there
fore, for them to think of raising armies fit to conquer or keep in check the
ruleis on the Orontes or in Naharaim. They left this to the races of
the interior — the Amorites and Hittites — and to their restless ambition.
The Hittite power, however, had never recovered from the terrible blow
inflicted on it at the time of the Asianic invasion.® The confederacy of
feudal chiefs, which had been brought momentarily together by Sapalulu
and his successors, was shattered by the violence of the shock, and the
elements of which it was composed were engaged henceforward in struggles
with each other. At this time the entire plain between the Amanus and the
Euphrates w'as covered with rich cities, of which the sites are represented
to-day by only a few wretched villages or by heaps of ruins. Arabian and
Byzantine remains sometimes crown the summit of the latter, but as soon as
we reach the lower strata we find in more or less abundance the ruins of build
ings of the Greek or Persian period, and beneath these those belonging to a
still earlier time. The history of Syria lies buried in such sites, and is waiting

Gurgum ^ around Marqasi, the Qni ^ and Khilakku ^ in the classical Cilicia, and
the Kasku ® and Kummukh in a bend of the Euphrates to the north and north
east of the Khati. The ancient Mitanni to the east of Carchen3,ish, which was
so active in the time of the later Amenothes, had now ceased to exist, and
there was but a vague remembrance of its former prowess. It had foundered
probably in the great cataclysm which engulfed the Hittite empire, although
its name appears inscribed once more among those of the vassals of Egypt
on the triumphal lists of Kamses III.'^ Its chief tribes had probably
migrated towards the regions which were afterwards described by the Greek
geographers as the home of the Matieni on the Halys and in the neigh
bourhood of Lake Urmiah.® Aramtean kingdoms, of which the greatest
was that of Bit-Adini,’^ had succeeded them, and bordered the Euphrates on
* The country of Samalla, in Egyptian Samalua (Maeiette, Karnak, pi. 2, No. 314; cf. Tomkins, On the Topography of Northern Syria, in the Tranmctions Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. ix. p. 251), extended around the Tell of Zinjirli, at the foot of the Amanus, in the valley of Marash of the Arab historians (Saciiav, Zur Historischen Geographic von Nordsyrien, pp. 2, 7). “ The name has been read Gamgumu, Gaugum (Waldemak Schmidt, Asfyriens og Aigyptens Gamle Ilistorie, p. 735, who places it near Zeugma, on the Euphrates;, and connected by Tomkins (Notes on the Geography of Northern Syria, in the Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. iii. pp. 3, 44) with the Egyptian Augama, which he reads Gagama, in the lists of Thdtmosis III. (Maeiette, Karnali, pi. 21, No. 315). The Aramman inscription on the statue of King Panammu shows that it must be read Gurgumu, and Sachau has identified this new name with that of Jurjum, which was the name by which the province of the Amanus, lying between Baias and the lake of Antioch, was known in the Byzantine period (Zur Historischen Geographic von Nordsyrien, pp. 2-17) ; the ancient Gurgum stretches further towards the north, around the town of Marqasi, which Tomkins (Notes on the Geog. of Northern Syria, pp. 3, 44) and Sachau (op. cit., pp. 6, 7) have identified with Marash. “ Tlic site of the country of Qui was determined by Schrader (Keilinschriften and Geschichtsforschung, pp. 238-242) ; it was that part of the Cilician plain which stretches from the Amanus to the mountains of the KOtis, and takes in the great town of Tarsus. F. Lenormant has pointed out that this country is mentioned twice in the Scriptures (1 Kings x. 28 and 2 Chron. i. 16) [The Eevised Version does not support this, but the LXX. gives “of Thecue,” and the Vulgate “de Coha.” Te.} in the time of Solomon (Les Origines de VHistoire, vol. iii. p. 9, n. 2). The designation of the country, transformed into tlie appellation of an eponymous god (see p. 355, note 1, supra), is found in the name Qauisaru, “ Qaui is king” (F. Lenoemant, op. cit., vol. iii. pp. 79, 273, n. 6). * Khilakku, the name of which is possibly the same as the Egyptian Khalakka (Maspeeo, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire, etc., in the Zeitschrift, 1879, p. 58), is the Cilicia Trachsea of classical geographers (Delitzsch, Ho lug das Paradies? p. 245). ^ The country of Kashku, which has been connected with Kashkisha, which takes the jilace of Karkisha in an Egyptian text (see p. 389, note 4, supra), was still a dependency of the Hittites in the time of Tiglath-pileser (Annals, ii, 1. 101). It was in the neighbourhood of the Urumu, whose capital seems to have been Urum, the ( lurima of Ptolemy (V. xv. § 14), near the bend of the Euphrates between Sumeisat and Birejik ; it extended into the Commagene of classical times, on the borders of Melitene and the Tubal (Delattee, L’Asic Occidentale dans les Inscriptions Assyriennes, pp. 64, 65, and Encore un mot sur la Gdbgraphie Assyrienne, pp. 27-31). Kummukh lay on both sides of the Euphrates and of the Upper Tigris (Delattee, L’Asie Occidentale, etc , pp. 41-43) ; it became gradually restricted, until at length it was conterminous with the Commagene of classical geographers (Scheadee, Keilinschriften, etc., pp. 127-155, 181-213).

each side as far as the Chalus and Balikh respectively ; the ancient Harraii
belonged also to them, and their frontier stretched as far as Hamath, and to
that of the Patinu on the Orontes. It was, as we have seen, a complete
breaking up of the old nationalities, and we have evidence also of a similar
disintegration in the countries to the north of the Taurus, in the direction of
the Black Sea. Of the mighty Khati with whom Thutmosis III. had come
into contact, there was no apparent trace : either the tribes of which they were
composed had migrated towards the south, or those who had never left their
native mountains had entered into new combinations and lost even the remem
brance of their name. The Milidu, Tabal (Tubal), and Mushku (Meshech)'
stretched behind each other from east to west on the confines of the Tokhma-Su,^'
and still further away other cities of less importance contended for the possession
of the Upper Saros and the middle region of the Halys. These peoples, at
once poor and warlike, had been attracted, like the Hittites of some centuries
previous, by the riches accumulated in the strongholds of Syria. Eevolutions
must have been frequent in these regions, but our knowledge of them is more
a matter of conjecture than of actual evidence. Towards the year 1170 b.c.
the Mushku swooped down on Kummukh, and made themselves its masters;
then pursuing their good fortune, they took from the Assyrians the two
provinces, Alzi and Purukuzzi, which lay not far from the sources of the Tigris
and the Balikh.^ A little later the Kashku, together with some Aramaeans,
broke into Shubarti, then subject to Assyria, and took possession of a part of
it.^ The majority of these invasions had, however, no permanent result : they
never issued in the establishment of an empire like that of the Khati, capable
by its homogeneity of offering a serious resistance to the march of a conqueror
from the south. To sum up the condition of affairs : if a redistribution of
races had brought about a change in Northern Syria, their want of cohesion
was no less marked than in the time of the Egyptian wars ; the first enemy
to make an attack upon the frontier of one or other of these tribes was sure

(cf. Winckler, Gescliichte Babyloniens, etc.,, pp. 171, 172). I think that the invasion of the Mushku was a purely local aflair, and had nothing in common with the general catastrophe occasioned by the movement of the Asiatic armies (see supra, p. 461, et seq.).

592 THE RISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
of victory, and if he persevered in his efforts could make himself master of as
much territory as he might choose. The Pharaohs had succeeded in welding
together their African possessions, and their part in the drama of conquest
had been played long ago ; but the cities of the Tigris and the Lower Euphrates
— Nineveh and Babylon—were ready to enter the lists as soon as they felt
themselves strong enough to revive their ancient traditions of foreign conquest.
The successors of Agumkakrime were not more fortunate than he had
been in attempting to raise Babylon once more to the foremost rank ; their
want of power, their discord, the insubordination and sedition that existed
among their Oosssean troops, and the almost periodic returns of the Theban
generals to the banks of the Euphrates, sometimes even to those of the Balikh
and the Khabur, all seemed to conspire to aggravate the helpless state into
which Babylon had sunk since the close of the dynasty of Uruazagga.^ Elam
was pressing upon her eastern, and Assyria on her northern frontier, and their
kings not only harassed her with persistent malignity, but, by virtue of their
alliances by marriage with her sovereigns, took advantage of every occasion to
interfere both in domestic and state affairs ; they would espouse the cause of
some pretender during a revolt, they would assume the guardianship of such of
their relatives as were left widows or minors, and, when the occasion presented
itself, they took possession of the throne of Bel, or bestowed it on one of their
creatures. Assyria particularly seemed to regard Babylon with a deadly hatred.
The capitals of the two countries were not more than some one hundred and
eighty-five miles apart, the intervening district being a flat and monotonous
alluvial plain, unbroken by any feature which could serve as a natural frontier.
The line of demarcation usually followed one of the many canals in the narrow
strip of land between the Euphrates and the Tigris ; it then crossed the latter,
and was formed by one of the rivers -draining the Iranian table-land,—either
the Upper Zab, the lladanu, the Turnat, or some of their ramifications in the
spurs of the mountain ranges. Each of the two states strove by every means
in its power to stretch its boundary to the farthest limits, and to keep it
there at all hazards. This narrow area was the scene of continual war, either
between the armies of the two states or those of partisans, suspended from time
to time by an elaborate treaty which was supposed to settle all difficulties,
but, as a matter of fact, satisfied no one, and left both parties discontented
with their lot and jealous of each other. The concessions made were never
of sufficient importance to enable the conqueror to crush his rival and regain
for himself the ancient domain of Khammurabi ; his losses, on the other hand,
were often considerable enough to paralyse his forces, and prevent him from
extending his border in any other direction. When the Egyptians seized on
* Cf. pp. 115-120 of the present work.



THE RELATIONS OF ASSYRIA AND BABYLON WITH EGYPT. 593
Naharaim, Assyria and Babylon each adopted at the outset a different attitude
towards the conquerors. Assyria, which never laid any permanent claims to
the seaboard provinces of the Mediterranean, was not disposed to resent their
occupation by Egypt, and desired only to make sure of their support or their
neutrality. The sovereign then ruling Assyria, but of whose name we have na
record, hastened to congratulate Thutmosis III. on his victory at Megiddo, and
sent him presents of precious vases, slaves, lapis-lazuli, chariots and horses, all
of which the Egyptian conqueror regarded as so much tribute.^ Babylon, on
the other hand, did not take action so promptly as Assyria ; it was only towards
the latter years of Thutmosis that its king, Karaindash, being hard pressed by
the Assyrian Assurbelnishishu, at length decided to make a treaty with the
intruder.^ The remoteness of Egypt from the Babylonian frontier no doubt
relieved Karaindash from any apprehension of an actual invasion by the
Pharaohs ; but there was the possibility of their subsidising some nearer enemy,
and also of forbidding Babylonish caravans to enter Egyptian provinces, and
thus crippling Chaldaean commerce.^ Friendly relations, when once estab
lished, soon necessitated a constant interchange of embassies and letters between
the Nile and the Euphrates. As a matter of fact, the Babylonian king could
never reconcile himself to the idea that Syria had passed out of his hands.
While pretending to warn the Pharaoh of Syrian plots against him,^ the Baby
lonians were employing at the same time secret agents, to go from city to city
and stir up discontent at Egyptian rule, praising the while the great Cossman
king and his armies, and inciting to revolt by promises of help never meant
to be fulBlled. Assyria, whose very existence would have been endangered by
the re-establishment of a Babylonian empire, never missed an opportunity of
denouncing these intrigues at head-quarters : they warned the royal messengers
and governors of them, and were constantly contrasting the frankness and honesty
* Cf. p. 262 of the present work. * We have no direct testimony in support of this hypothesis, but several important considerations give it probability. As no tribute from Babylon is mentioned in the Annals of Thutmosis III., we must place the beginning of the relations between Egypt and Chaldaea at a later date. On the other hand, Burnaburiash II., in a letter written to Amenothes III., cites Karaindash as the first of his fathers, who had established friendly relations with the fathers of the Pharaoh (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, etc., No. 3, p. 28, 11. 8-10, and p. xxxi.), a fact which obliges us to place the interchange of presents before the time of Amenothes III. : as the reigns of Amenothes II. and of Thutmosis IV. were both short (cf. supra, pp. 289-295), it is probable that these relations began in the latter years of Thutmosis III. * Cf. p. 279, et seq., of tlie present work. Burnaburiash II. had taken the precaution to warn Amenothes IV. of what the Assyrians might say of him, and dissuaded him from forming an alliance with them (Bezold-Bodge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, etc.. No. 2, p. 7, 11. 31-35 ; cf. Zimmern, Briefe aus dem Funde in El-Amarna, in the Zeitsehrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. v. pp. 152, 153; Delattee.

594 TEE RISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
of their own dealings with the duplicity of their rivald This state of affairs
lasted for more than half a century, during which time both courts strove to
ingratiate themselves in the favour of the Pharaoh, each intriguing for the
exclusion of the other, by exchanging presents with him, by congratulations
on his accession, by imploring gifts of wrought or unwrought gold, and by
offering him the most beautiful women of their family for his harem. The son
of Karaindash, whose name still remains to be discovered, bestowed one of his
daughters on the young Amenothes III. : Kallimasin, the sovereign who suc
ceeded him, also sent successively two princesses to the same Pharaoh.^ But
the underlying bitterness and hatred would break through the veneer of polite
formulae and protestations when the petitioner received, as the result of his
advances, objects of inconsiderable value such as a lord might distribute to his
vassals, or when he was refused a princess of solar blood, or even an Egyptian
bride of some feudal house ; at such times, however, an ironical or haughty
epistle from Thebes would recall him to a sense of his own inferiority.
As a fact, the lot of the Cossaean sovereigns does not appear to have been
a happy one, in spite of the variety and pomposity of the titles which they
continued to assume. They enjoyed but short lives, and we know that at least
three or four of them—Kallimasin, Burnaburiash I., and Kurigalzu I. ascended
the throne in succession during the forty years that Amenothes III. ruled over
Egypt and Syria.^ Perhaps the rapidity of this succession may have arisen from
* Cf. the letter of Assuruballit, King of Assyria, to Pharaoh Amenothes IV., in Winckler-Abel, Per Tlioniafelfund von El-Amarna, No. 9, p. 8. * See, lor example, the correspondence between Kallimasin and Amenothes III. (Winokler-Abel, Per ThontafeTfund, etc.. No. 1, pi. 1, and Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, etc.. No. 1, pp. 2-5, and pp. xxv.-xxx.), and the letters of Burnaburiash to Amenothes IV. (Winckler-Abel, op. cit.^ No. 3, p. 3, and Bezold-Budge, op. cit.. No. 3, pp. 8, 9, and pp. xxxi., xxxii.). ’ Winckler, AUorientalische Forschungen, p. 120. The copy we possess of the Eoyal Canon of Babylon is mutilated at this point (Pinches, The Babylonian Kings of the Second Period, in the Transactions, 1883-84, vol. vi. pp. 195, 196, and pi. i. col. ii. ; cf. Knddtzon, Assyrisehe Gebete an den Sonnengott, vol. i. pi. 60), and the original documents are not sufficiently complete to fill the gap. .\bout two or three names are missing after that of Agumkakrime (cf. p. 119, note 1, of the present work, for the list of the first seven kings of the Cossman dynasty), and the reigns must have been very short, if indeed, as I think, Agumkakrimi and Karaindash were both contemporaries of the earlier Pharaohs bearing the name of Tbutmosis. The order of the names which have come down to us is not indisputably established; Hilprecht (T/m Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania, vol. i. pp. 37, 38, and Assyriaca, vol. i. pp. 85-99) and Winckler {AUorientalische Forschungen, pp. 109-139) do not agree on the subject (cf. Tiele, in the Zeitschrift fur Assyriologie, vol. X. pp. 105-112). The following order appears to me to be the most probable at present :
Karaindash. Karakhardash. Kadashmankharbe I. Nazibugasu. Kurigalzu II. Nazimaruttash. Kadashmanturgu.
Kallimasin. Burnaburiash I. Kurigalzu I. Burnaburiash II.
This is, with a slight exception, the classification adojited by Winckler (Altorientalische Forschungen, p. 133), and that of Hilprecht {Assyriaca, vol. i. p. 99) differs from it only in the intercalation of Kudurturgii and Shagaraktiburiash between Burnaburiash II. and Karakhardash.

-some internal revolution or from family disturbances. The Chaldaeans of the
old stock reluctantly rendered obedience to these Cossaean kings, and, if we may
judge from the name, one at least of these ephemeral sovereigns, Kallimasin,
appears to have been a Semite, who owed his position among the Cossaean
princes to some fortunate chance.^ A few rare inscriptions stamped on bricks,
one or two letters or documents of private interest, and some minor objects
from widely distant spots, have enabled us to ascertain the sites upon which
these sovereigns erected buildings ; Karaindash restored the temple of
Nana at TJruk,^ Burnaburiash and Kurigalzu added to that of Shamash at
Larsam,® and Kurigalzu took in hand that of Sin at Uru.* We also
possess a record of some of their acts in the fragments of a document,
which a Ninevite scribe of the time of Assurbanipal had compiled, or rather
jumbled together,® from certain Babylonian chronicles dealing with the wars
against Assyria and Elam, with public treaties, marriages, and family quarrels.®
We learn from this, for example, that Burnaburiash I. renewed with Buzur
assur the conventions drawn up between Karaindash and Assurbelnishishu.'^
These friendly relations were maintained, apparently, under Kurigalzu 1. and
• This is the opinion of Egbert W. Kogees, Outlines of the History of Early Babylonia, p. 55, and I propose to adopt it for the present. I ought, however, to remark that Kallimasin may have been born of a Cossaean king and a Babylonian concubine, which would explain the form of his name without excluding him from the royal line. ® Brick in the British Museum mentioned in Rawlinson, Can.

596 TEE BISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
Assur-nadin-akhi, the son of Buzurassur : ^ if Kurigalzu built or restored th&
fortress, long called after him Dur-Kurigalzu,^ at one of the fords of the
Narmalka, it was probably as a precautionary measure rather than because of
any immediate danger. The relations between the two powers became some
what strained when Burnaburiash II. and Assuruballit had respectively suc
ceeded to Kurigalzu and Assur-nadin-akhi ; ^ this did not, however, lead to
hostilities, and the subsequent betrothal of Karakhardash, son of Burnaburiash
II., to Muballitatserua, daughter of Assuruballit, tended to restore matters to
their former condition. The good will between the two countries became still
more pronounced when Kadashmankharbe succeeded his father Karakhardash.
The Cosstean soldiery had taken umbrage at his successor and had revolted,,
assassinated Kadashmankharbe, and proclaimed king in his stead a man of
obscure origin named Nazibugash. Assuruballit, without a moment’s hesitation,
took the side of his new relatives ; he crossed the frontier, killed Nazibugash,
and restored the throne to his sister’s child, Kurigalzu II., the younger.^ The
young king, who was still a minor at his accession, appears to have met with
no serious difticulties ; at any rate, none were raised by his Assyrian cousins,
Belniravi I. and his successor Budilu.'^ Towards the close of his reign, how
ever, revolts broke out, and it was only by sustained efforts that he was able
to restore order in Babylon, Sippara, and the Country of the Sea. While the
king was in the midst of these dilBculties, the Elamites took advantage of
his troubles to steal from him a portion of his territory, and their king,
Khurbatila, challenged him to meet his army near Dur-Dungi. Kurigalzu
accepted the challenge, gained a decisive victory, took his adversary prisoner,
and released him only on receiving as ransom a province beyond the Tigris
he even entered Susa, and, from among other trophies of past wars, resumed
possession of an agate tablet belonging to Dungi, which the veteran Kudurna
khunta had stolen from the temple of Nipur nearly a thousand years previously.*^
Assur-nadin-akhi I. is mentioned in a Tel el-Amarna tablet as being the father of Assuruballit (Winckleii-Abel, Der Thontafelfund von El-Amnrna, No. 9, p. 8, 11. 19-25). This is the present Akerkuf, as is proved by the discovery of bricks bearing the name of Kurigalzu (Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. TF. As., vol. i. pi. 4, xiv., No. 1 ; cf. Winckleb, Inschriften von bah. Kassiten-Konigen, in Schrader, Keilinsehrift. Bibliothek, \o\. iii.pt. 1, pp. 154,155); but perhaps what I have attributed to Kurigalzu I. must be referred to the second king of that name. For mention
of Dur-Kurigalzu, cf. the documents collected by Fb. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Parodies? jjp. 207, 208. “ We infer this from the way in which Burnaburiash speaks of the Assyrians in the correspondence witli Amenothes IV. (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 2, p. 7, 11. 30-35) ; cf. pp. 279, et seq., and 593, note 1, of the present volume. * Synchronous History, col. i. 11. 8-17, in which the errors of the Assyrian scribe have been corrected by the Chronicle of Pinches, An Early Tablet of the Babylonian Chronicle, in the Records of the Past, 2nd series, vol. v. pp. 107, 108; cf Winckler, Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 115, 116, For the succession of the Babylonian kings of this period, cf Lehmann, Inschrift Kurigalzu's II., in the ZeitschriftfarAssyrivlogie,\o\. v. pp. 417-419, and Winckler, Kurigalzu sihru, ibid., vol. vi. pp. 454-457. ^ The Synchronous History erroneously places the events of the reign of Kamman-niia,ri in that of Belnirari (AVinckler, Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 115, 116). Tlie order of succession of Buzurassur, Assuruballit, Belnirari, and Budilu, has been established by the bricks of Kalah-Shergat (Fit. Lenormant, Inscriptions cun^iformes inedites, in the Revue Arc/ie'ofogu'gMe, 1869, vol. xix. jip. 360-367. ^ Hilprecht, The Babylonian Expedition, vol. i. p. 31 ; and p. 37, note 3, of the present volume.



KURIOALZU Ii:S FIRST CONQUESTS. 597
This victory was followed by the congratulations of most of his neighbours,
with the exception of Eamman-nirari II., who had succeeded Budilu in
Assyria, and probably felt some jealousy or uneasiness at the news. He
attacked the Cossaeans, and overthrew them at Sugagi, on the banks of the
Salsallat ; their losses were considerable, and Kurigalzu could only obtain
peace by the cession to Assyria of a strip of territory the entire length of the
north-west frontier, from the confines of the Shubari country, near the sources
of the Khabur, to the suburbs of Babylon itself.^ Nearly the whole of Meso
potamia thus changed hands at one stroke, but Babylon had still more serious
losses to suffer. Nazimaruttash, who attempted to wipe out the disaster sus
tained by his father Kurigalzu, experienced two crushing defeats, one at Kar
Ishtar and the other near Akarsallu,^ and the treaty which he subsequently
signed was even more humiliating for his country than the preceding one. All
that part of the Babylonian domain which lay nearest to Nineveh was ceded to
the Assyrians, from Pilaski on the right bank of the Tigris to the province of
Lulume in the Zagros mountains.® It would appear that the Cossman tribes
who had remained in their native country, took advantage of these troublous
times to sever all connection with their fellow-countrymen established in the
cities of the plain ; for we find them henceforward carrying on a petty warfare
for their own profit, and leading an entirely independent life. The descendants
of Gandish, deprived of territories in the north, repulsed in the east, and
threatened in the south by the nations of the Persian Gulf, never recovered
their former ascendency, and their authority slowly declined during the century
which followed these events. Their downfall brought about the decadence of
the cities over which they had held sway ; and the supremacy which Babylon
had exercised for a thousand years over the countries of the Euphrates passed
into the hands of the Assyrian kings.
Assyria itself was but a poor and insignificant country when compared with
‘her rival. It occupied, on each side of the middle course of the Tigris, the
territory lying between the 35th and 37th parallels of latitude.^ It was bounded

on the east by the hills and mountain ranges running parallel to the Zagros
Chain—Gebel Guar, Gebel Gara, Zerguizavan-dagh, and Baravan-dagh, with
their rounded monotonous limestone ridges, scored by watercourses and destitute
of any kind of trees. On the north it was hemmed in by the spurs of the
Masios, and bounded on the east by an undefined line running from Mount
Masios to the slopes of Singar, and from these again to the Chaldman plain ;
to the south the frontier followed the configuration of the table-land and the
curve of the low cliffs, which in prehistoric times had marked the limits of the
Persian Gulf ; from here the boundary was formed on the left side of the Tigris
by one of its tributaries, either the Lower Zab or the Radanu. The territory
thus enclosed formed a compact and healthy district: it was free from extremes
of temperature arising from height or latitude, and the relative character and
fertility of its soil depended on the absence or presence of rivers. The eastern
part of Assyria was well watered by the streams and torrents which drained the
Iranian plateau and the lower mountain chains which ran parallel to it. The
beds of these rivers are channelled so deeply in the alluvial soil, that it is
necessary to stand on the very edge of their banks to catch a sight of their
silent and rapid waters ; and it is only in the spring or early summer, when
they are swollen by the rains and melting snow, that they spread over the
adjacent country. As soon as the inundation is over, a vegetation of the
intensest green springs up, and in a few days the fields and meadows are
covered with a luxuriant and fragrant carpet of verdure. This brilliant growth
is, however, short-lived, for the heat of the sun dries it up as quickly as it
appears, and even the corn itself is in danger of being burnt up before
reaching maturity. To obviate such a disaster, the Assyrians had constructed^
a network of canals and ditches, traces of which are in many places still
visible, while a host of sliadufs placed along their banks facilitated irrigation
in the dry seasons.^ The provinces supplied with water in this manner enjoyed
a fertility which passed into a proverb, and was well known among the

Delitzscii, Wo lag das Paradies‘1 p. 252); from tlie Persian epoch onwards, the name was applied to the whole course of the Tigris as far as the mountain district (IlEBonoT., i. 106, 192, iii. 92; cf. Pliny, Nat. Hist., viii. 26; Stbabo, XVI. i. § 1, p. 725, who applies the name Aturia especially to Nineveh). The ancient orthography of the name is Aushar (H. Kawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. ii. pi. 46, 2 c, d, and vol. iii. pi. 2, No. 5, vol. iv. pis. 18, 32 5), which we shall meet with later on (p. 602 of the present work) as applied to both the god and the town. * For the irrigation by means of shadufs, cf. Dawn of Civilization, p. 764; the illustration on that page is taken from an Assyrian monument. The course of an Assyrian canal and the works undertaken to keep it up are described by F. Jones, Topography of Nineveh, in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, vol. xv. pp. 310, 311 ; the inscriptions mention the opening of new and the cleaning out of old canals {Annals of Assur-nazir-pal. col. iii. 1. 135, and Hunting Inscriptions, col. ii. 11. 20-24).

ancients ; ^ they yielded crops of cereals which rivalled those of Babylonia, and
included among their produce wheat, barley, millet, and sesame. But few olive
trees were cultivated, and the dates were of inferior quality ; indeed, in the
Greek period, these fruits were only used for fattening pigs and domestic
animals.^ The orchards contained the pistachio, the apple, the pomegranate,
the apricot, the vine, the almond, and the fig, and, in addition to the essences
common to both Syria and Egypt, the country produced cedrats of a delicious
scent which were supposed to be an antidote to all kinds of poisons.^ Assyria
was not well wooded, except in the higher valleys, where willows and poplars
bordered the rivers, and sycamores, beeches, limes, and plane trees abounded,

latter, from whose branches manna was obtained.^ This is a saccharine substance,

whicli is deposited in small lumps, and is found in greater abundance during wet
years and especially on foggy days. When fresh, it has an agreeable taste and
is pleasant to eat ; but as it will not keep in its natural state, the women prepare
it for exportation by dissolving it in boiling water, and evaporating it to a
sweetish paste, which has more or less purgative qualities. The aspect of
the country changes after crossing the Tigris westward. The slopes of Mount
Masios are everywhere furrowed with streams, which feed the Khabur and its
principal affluent, the Kharmis ;
^ woods become more frequent, and the valleys
green and shady. The plains extending southwards, however, contain, like
those of the Euphrates, beds of gypsum in the sub-soil, which render the
water running through them brackish, and prevent the growth of vegetation.
The effects of volcanic action are evident on the surface of these great steppes ;
blocks of basalt pierce through the soil, and near the embouchure of the
Kharmis, a cone, composed of a mass of lava, cinders, and scorim, known as the
Tell-Kokab, rises abruptly to a height of 325 feet. The mountain chain of
8ingar, which here reaches its western termination, is composed of a long ridge
of soft white limestone, and seems to have been suddenly thrown up in one of
the last geological upheavals which affected this part of the country : in some
places it resembles a perpendicular wall, while in others it recedes in natural
terraces which present the appearance of a gigantic flight of steps. The summit
is often wooded, and the spurs covered with vineyards and fields, which flourish
vigorously in the vicinity of streams ; when these fail, however, the table-land
resumes its desolate aspect, and stretches in bare and sandy undulations to
the horizon, broken only where it is crossed by the Thartar, the sole river in
this region which is not liable to be dried up, and whose banks may be traced
by the scanty line of vegetation which it nourishes.^
In a country thus unequally favoured by nature, the towns are necessarily dis
tributed in a seemingly arbitrary fashion. Most of them are situated on the left
bank of the Tigris, where the fertile nature of the soil enables it to support a
dense population. They were all flourishing centres of population, and were in
close proximity to each other, at all events during the centuries of Assyrian
hegemony.^ Three of them soon eclipsed their rivals in political and religious
vol. ii. pp. 359, 3G0: Chesney, The Expedition for the Survey of the Rivers Euphrates and Tigris, vol. i. pp. 123, 124. ' The Kharmis is the Mygdonios of Greek geographers, the Hiriaas of the Arabs ; the latter name may be derived from Kharmis (G. Rawlinson, The Five Great Monarchies, vol. ii. p. 87, note 2; Schrader, Keilinschriften und Geschichtsfurschung, pp. 141, note 2, 532 ; Hommel, Gesohichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 577, note 2), or it may be that it merely presents a fortuitous resemblance to it (Noldekf, in the Zeitschrift der I)eut. Morgenl. Ges., vol. xxxiii. p. 328). * For the countries to the west of the Tigris, cf. Layard, Nineveh and Babylon, p. 199, et seq., where the author describes his journey to the Khabur and his return to Koyuujik. ^ AVe find, for example, in the inscription of Bavian (H. Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. TF. As., vol. iii. pi. 14), a long enumeration of towns and villages situated almost within the suburbs of Nineveh, on
the banks of the Klioser (Pognon, U Inscription de Bavian, pp. 8, 9, llG-119).

importance; these were Kalakh and Nina on the Tigris, and Arbailu, lying
beyond the Upper Zab, in the broken plain which is a continuation eastwards of
the first spurs of the Zagrosd On the right bank, however, we find merely
some dozen cities and
towns, scattered about
in places where there
was a supply of water
sufficient to enable the
inhabitants to cultivate
the soil; as, for example,
Assur on the banks of
the Tigris itself, Sin
gara near the sources of
the Thartar, and Nazibina near those of the Kharmis, at the foot of the
Masios.^ These cities were not all under the rule of one sovereign when
Thutmosis III. appeared in Syria, for the Egyptian monuments mention,
besides the kingdom of Assyria, that of Singara ^ and Araphka in the upper
basin of the Zab.® Assyria, however, had already asserted her supremacy over
this corner of Asia, and the remaining princes, even if they were not mere vice
gerents depending on her king, were not strong enough in wealth and extent
of territory to hold their own against her, since she was undisputed mistress
of Assur, Arbeles, Kalakh, and Nineveh, the most important cities of the plain.
Assur covered a considerable area, and the rectangular outline formed by the
remains of its walls is still discernible on the surface of the soil. Within
the circuit of the city rose a mound, which the ancient builders had trans
formed, by the addition of masses of brickwork, into a nearly square platform,
surmounted by the usual palace, temple, and ziggurat; it was enclosed within a
wall of squared stone, the battlements of which remain to the present day.®
' The name of Arbeles is written in a form whioh appears to signify “the town of the four gods” {arhd-ilu) ; of. the analogous orthography of Arab-lcha, “ tue town of the four fish,” which the Assyrians use for the name of the country of Arrapakhitis (Fn. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies^ pp. 124, 125, 256). ^ Drawn by Boudier, from the cut in Latard, Ninemh and Babylon, p. 274. “ For Singara and its ruins, cf. Layard, op. cit., pp. 211, 212; for Nazibina (Nisibis) and its ruins, ef. G. Smith, Assyrian Discoveries, pp. 39, 109, 1 10.
* This kingdom of Singara is mentioned in the Egyptian lists of Thutmosis III. (W. Max Muller, Asien und Europa, etc., p. 279). Schrader was doubtful as to its existence {Keilinsdirijten und, GeschichUforsclmng, pp. 473-475, note), but one of its kings is mentioned in a letter from the King of Alasia to Amenothes IV. (Bezold-Budge, Tell el-Amarna Tablets, No. 5, p. 13, 1. 49, and p. xxxv. note 2); according to Niebuhr (^Studien und Bemerkungen, etc., p. 91, et seq.), the state of which Singara was the capital must have been identical, at all events at one period, with the Mitanni of the Egyptian texts (cf. what is said of Mitanni on p. 146, note 2, of the present volume). * The Arapakha of the Egyptian monuments has been identified with the Arrapakhitis of the Greeks by Brugsch (Geog. Inschriften, vol. ii. pp. 52, 56). “ Layarh, Nineveh and its Remains, vol. i. p. 5, and vol. ii. pp. 48-64. Ainsworth {Journal of the ^Geographical Society, vol. xi. p. 5) states the circumference of the principal mound of Kalah-Shergat to be 4685 yards, which would make it one of the most extensive ruins in the whole country.

602 THE RISE OF TEE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
The Avhole pile was known as the Ekharsagkurkurra,” or the “ House of the
terrestrial mountain,” ^ the sanctuary in whose decoration all the ancient
sovereigns had vied with one another, including Samsiramman I. and Irishum,
who were merely vicegerents dependent upon Babylon.^ It was dedicated
to Anshar, that duplicate of Anu who had led the armies of heaven in the
struggle with Tiamat ; the name Anshar, softened into Aushar, and sub
sequently into Ashshur, was first applied to the town and then to the whole
country.^ The god himself was a deity of light, usually represented under
the form of an armed man, wearing the tiara and having the lower half of his
body concealed by a feathered disk. He was supposed to hover continually
over the world, hurling fiery darts at the enemies of his people, and protecting
his kingly worshippers under the shadow of his wings.^ Their wars were his
wars, and he was with them in the thick of the attack, placing himself in the
front rank with the soldiery,® so that when he gained the victory, the bulk
of the spoil—precious metals, gleanings of the battle-field, slaves and pro
ductive lands—fell to his share. The gods of the vanquished enemy,
moreover, were, like their princes, forced to render him homage. In the
person of the king he took their statues prisoners, and shut them up in his
sanctuary ; sometimes he would engrave his name upon their figures and
send them back to their respective temples, where the sight of them
‘ For the “ terrestrial mountain,” cf. what is said in Dawn of Civilization, pp. 543, 544. The name of this temple is met with for the first time in the inscription of Ramman-nirari I., discovered by G. Smith (H. Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. pi. 45, verso, 1. 28). “ Bricks in the British Museum found at Kalah-Shergat, bearing the names of Samsiramman (H. Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. i. pi. 6, Nos. 1, 2) and of Irishum (H. Rawlinson, op. city vol. i. pi. 6, No. 2 ; cf. Schrader, Alteste Assyrische Inschriften, in the Keil. Bihliotheh, vol. i. pp. 2, 3). ® Another name of the town in later times was Palbeki, ‘‘ the town of the old empire,” “ the ancient capital,” or Sliauru (Fr. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies ? pp. 254, 255). Many Assyriologists believe that the name Ashur, anciently written Aushar, signified “the plain at the edge of the water,” a+ushar and that it must have been applied to the town before being applied to the country and the god (Fr. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies ? pp. 252-254 ; Homjiel, Gesch. Bab. und Assyriens, pp. 280,
479). Others, on the contrary, think, with more reason, that it was the god who gave his name to the town and the country (Schrader, Die Keilinscliriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd edit., pp. 35-37): they make a point of the very ancient play of words, which in Assyria itself attributed the meaning “ good god ” to the word Ashur (Oppert, Grande Inscription du Palais de Khorsabad, in the Journal Asiatique, 1865, vol. vi. p. 237). Jensen was tlie first to state that Ashur was the god Anshar of the account of the creation (JJeber einige Sumero-Akkadische und Bab. -Assyrische Gotternamen, in the Zeitschrift, vol. i. pp. 1-7, and Die Kosmologie, p. 275). Against this opinion, cf. Schrader, Bemerkungen zu D’’ Jensen, etc., in the Zeitschrift, vol. i. pp. 209-217; Schrader had, however, traced the same connection in Die Keilinscliriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd edit., p. 36. Jensen’s opinion has been adopted by Ilommel (Gesch. Bab. und Assyriens, p. 492, note 2), by Sayce (The Religion of the Ancient Babylonians, pp. 125, 126),'and by Tiele (Gesch. der Religion im Altertum, vol. i. p. 186). * See the picture of Assur, drawn by Faucher-Gudin at the head of the present chapter, p. 567 cf. Layard, The Monuments of Nineveh, vol. i. pi. 21. I have used, in describing the god, the very
words of the inscriptions, pulkhu adiru milam Ashur, “ the fear inspired by the splendour of Ashur ” (Inscription of Tiglath-pileser L, col. ii. 1. 38), namrisi Ashur, “the fearful brightness of Assur” (Annals of Assurbanipal, Rassam Cylinder, col. i. 1. 48). * In one of the pictures, for instance, representing the assault of a town, we see a small figure of the god, hurling darts against the enemy (Layard, Monuments of Nineveh, vol. i. pi. 19). The inscriptions also state that the peoples “are alarmed and quit their cities before the arms of Assur, the powerful one" (Annals of Samsiramman, col. iii. 11. 28-30).

would remind their worshippers of his own omuipoteuce.^ The goddess
associated with him as
his wife had given her
name, Nina, to Nine
veh,^ and was, as the
divine lady Belit ; she
was, in fact, a chaste and
warlike Ishtar, who led
the armies into battle
with a boldness charac
teristic of her father.®
These two divinities
formed an abstract and
solitary pair, around
whom neither story nor
myth appears to have
gathered,and who never
became the centre of
any complex belief.

Assur seems to have
had no parentage assigned to liim, no statue erected to him, and he was
> As, for instance, the statues of the gods taken from the Arabs in the time of Esarhaddon (Cylinders A and C, col. iii. 11. 7-12). Tiglath-pileser I. had carried away twenty-five statues of gods taken from the peoples of Kurkhi and Kummukh, and had placed them in the temples of Beltis, Ishtar, Anu, and Kamman (Annals, col. iv. 11. 32-39) ; he mentions other foreign divinities who had been similarly treated, in the Annals, col. ii. 1. 31, col. iii. 1. 106, col. iv. 1. 23, col. vi. 11. 8-10. * The ideogram of the name of the goddess Nina serves to write the name of the town Nineveh (Oppert, Sur quelques-unes des Inscriptions cun^iformes d^couvertes en Chaldee, in the Actes du Congres
de Leyden, vol. ii. p. 628). The name itself has been interpreted by Schrader as “ station, habitation ” (Die Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd edit., p. 102), in the Semitic languages, and by Fr. Delitzsch “ repose of the god ” (cf. Hojimel, Die Semitischen Volker und Sprache, vol. i. pp. 382, 492, 493, and Gescli. Bab. und Assyriens, p. 280), an interpretation which Delitzsch himself repudiated later on ( Wo lag das Paradies ? p. 260). It is probable that the town, which, like Assur, was a Chaldsean colony, derived its name from the goddess to whom it was dedicated, and whose temple existed there as early as the time of the vicegerent Samsiramman (G. Smith, Assyrian Discoveries, pp. 247-249). ® Belit is called by Tiglath-pileser I. “ the great spouse beloved of Assur ” (Annals, col. iv. 11. 34, 35 cf. K, 100, 1. 5, in Satce, The Religion of the Ancient Babylonians, p. 128, note), but Belit, “ the lady,” is here merely an epithet used for Ishtar (Delitzsch-Mordter, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., 2nd edit., pp. 108, 109). For the Chaldsean Ishtar, see Dawn of Civilization, pp. 658, 670, 672, 693, et seq. : the Assyrian Ishtar, Ishtar of Assur (Annals of Tiglath-pileser L, col. iv. 1. 36, col. vi. 11. 86, 87), Ishtar
of Nineveh (Annals of Assurnazirpal, col. iii. 11. 91, 92), or rather— especially from the time of the
Sargonids—Ishtar of Arbeles, is almost always a fierce and warlike Ishtar, the “lady of combat, who directs battles” (Annals of Tiglath-pileser J.,col. i. 11. 13, 14), “ whose heart incites her to the combat and the struggle ” (Annals of Assurbanipal, Cylinder B, col. v. 11. 52-76). Sayce thinks that the union of Ishtar and Assur is of a more recent date (The Religion of the Ancient Babylonians, pp. 123, 126, 127, 271, et seq.). * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from squeezes brought back by M. de Morgan ; cf.

not associated with the crowd of other divinities ; on the contrary, he was called
their lord, their “ peerless king,” and, as a proof of his supreme sovereignty over
them, his name was inscribed at the head of their lists, before those of the
triads constituted by the Chaldman priests—even before those of Ann, Bel, and
Ead The city of Assur, which had been the first to tender him allegiance for
many years, took precedence of all the rest, in spite of the drawbacks with
which it had to contend. Placed at the very edge of the Mesopotamian
desert, it was exposed to the dry and burning winds which swept over the
plains, so that by the end of the spring the heat rendered it almost intolerable
as a residence. The Tigris, moreover, ran behind it, thus leaving it exposed
to tlie attacks of the Babylonian armies, unprotected as it was by any natural
fosse or rampart. The nature of the frontier was such as to afford it no safe
guard ; indeed, it had, on the contrary, to protect its frontier. Nineveh, on the
other hand, was entrenched behind the Tigris and the Zab, and was thus secure
from any sudden attack. Northerly and easterly winds prevailed during the
summer, and the coolness of the night rendered the heat during the day more
bearable. It became the custom for the kings and vicegerents to pass the most
trying months of the year at Nineveh, taking up their abode close to the temple
of Nina, the Assyrian Ishtar, but they did not venture to make it their habitual
residence, and consequently Assur remained the official capital and chief sanc
tuary of the empire. Here its rulers concentrated their treasures, their archives,
their administrative offices, and the chief staff of the army; from this town they
set out on their expeditions against the Cossmans of Babylon or the mountaineers
of the districts beyond the Tigris, and it was in this temple that they dedicated
to the god the tenth of the spoil on their return from a successful campaign.^
The struggle with Chaldaea, indeed, occupied the greater part of their
energies, though it did not absorb all tlieir resources, and often left them
times of respite, of which they availed themselves to extend their domain
to the north and east. We cannot yet tell which of the Assyrian sove
reigns added the nearest provinces of tlie Upper Tigris to his realm ; but
when the names of these districts appear in history, they are already in a
state of submission and vassalage, and their principal towns are governed
by Assyrian officers in the same manner as those of Singara and Nisibe.

borough of, Lagash (cf. Daion of Civilization, p. 003, note 5), and had nothing in common with Nineveh, in si)ite of Hommel’s assumption to the contrary {Gesch. Bab. und As?., pp. 280, 327, 328, 489, 490, where the name of the goddess is read Ghanna, and that of the town Ghanna-ki).

Assuruballit, the conqueror of the Cossseans, had succeeded in establish
ing his authority over the turbulent hordes of 8hubari which occupied the
neighbourhood of the Masios, between the Khabur and the Balikh, and ex
tended perhaps as far as the Euphrates ; at any rate, he was considered
by posterity as the actual founder of the Assyrian empire in these districts.^
Belnirari had directed his efforts in another direction, and had conquered
the petty kingdoms established on the slopes of the Iranian table-land, around
the sources of the two Zabs, and those of the Radanu and the Turnat.^ Like
Susiana, this part of the country was divided up into parallel valleys, separated
from each other by broken ridges of limestone, and watered by the tributaries
of the Tigris or their affluents. It was thickly strewn with walled towns and
villages ; the latter, perched upon the precipitous mountain summits, and
surrounded by deep ravines, owed their security solely to their position,

and, indeed, needed no fortification. The country abounded in woods and
[pastures, interspersed with cornlands ; access to it was gained by one or two
passes on the eastern side, which thus permitted caravans or armies to reach
the districts lying between the Erythraean and Caspian Seas, The tribes who
inhabited it had been brought early under Chaldaean civilization, and had
adopted the cuneiform script; such of their monuments as are still extant
resemble the bas-reliefs and inscriptions of Assyria.’^ It is not always easy
to determine the precise locality occupied by these various peoples ; the Guti
were situated near tlie upper courses of the Turnat and the Eadanu, in the
vicinity of the Kashshu ; ^ the Lulume had settled in the neighbourhood of
the Batir, to the north of the defiles of Zohab;^ the Namar separated the
Lulume from Elam, and were situated half in the plain and half in the moun
tain,^ while the Arapkha occupied both banks of the Great Zab. Budilu carried
his arms against these tribes, and obtained successes over the Turuki and the
Kigimkhi, the princes of the Guti and the Shuti, as well as over the Akhlami
and the Tauri.® The chiefs of the Lulume had long resisted the attacks of
their neighbours, and one of them, Anubanini, had engraved on the rocks
overlianging the road not far from the village of Seripul, a bas-relief cele
brating his own victories. He figures on it in full armour, wearing a turban
on his head, and treadinsf underfoot a fallen foe, while Ishtar of Arbeles leads
’ Pinches has published an inscription of a king of Kliani, named Tukultimir, son of Ilushaba, written in Chaldeo-Assyrian, and found in the temple of Shamash at Sippara, where the personage himself had dedicated it {Babylonian Art illustrated by M. A. Rassam’s latest discoveries, in the Transactions of the Soc. of Bibl. Arch., vol. viii. pp. 351-353). Winckler gives another inscription of a king of the Guti {Eine neu-veroffentUclite Inschrift eines unbelcannten Konigs, in the Zeitschri/t, vol. iv. p. 40(1), which is also in Semitic and in cuneiform character. - The name is written sometimes Quti, at others Guti, which induced Pognon to believe that they were two diiferent peoples {Inscription de Me'rou-n^rar 1., p. 78, note 1) : the territory occupied by this nation must have been originally to the east of the Lesser Zab, in the upper basins of the Adhem and the Diyaleh (Delitzsch, IVo lag das Paradiesl pp. 233, 234). Oppert proposes to recognise in tliese Guti “ the ancestors of the Goths, who, fifteen hundred years ago, pushed forward to the Russia of the present day : we find” (he adds), “in this passage and in others, some of which go back to the third millennium before the Christian era, the earliest mention of the Germanic races ” {Adad-nirar, King of Ellassar, p. 18). ^ The people of Lulume-Lullubi have been pointed out as living to the east of the Lesser Zab by Schrader {Keilinscliriften und Geschichtsforschung, pp. 270, 271) ; their exact position, together with that of Mount Padir-Balir in whose neighbourhood they were, has been determined by Pore Scheil {Les deux Steles de Zolidb, in the Recueil de Travaux, vol. xiii. pp. 104, 105). ’ For the locality of Namar, see the observations of Boscawen, The Horses of Namar, in the Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. vi. pp. 139, 140. ^ Inscription of Rammdn-nirdri I., recto, 11. 14-22. For the Guti, see supra, note 2 of this page ; tlie Shutu or Shuti, who are always found in connection with the Guti, appear to have been the inhabitants of the lower mountain slopes which separate the basin of the Tigris with the regions of Elam, to the south of Turnat (Fr. Delitzsch, JVo lag das Paradies ? pp. 234, 235). The Akhlame were neighbours of the Shuti and the Guti ; they were settled partly in the Mesopotamian plain and partly in the neighbourhood of Turnat (Hommel, Geseh. Bab. und Ass., p. 432). The territory of the lauri is not known; the Turuki and the Nigimkhi, the latter of whom are called Nisikhkhi by Otpert, Adad-nirar, roi d’ Ellassar, pp. 9, 13, and Nigimti by Winckler, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 158, were probably situated somewhere to the east of the Great Zab ; in the same way that Oppert connects the Goths with the Guti, so Hommel sees in the Turuki the Turks of a very early date {Gesch. Bab. und Assyriens, p. 501).

towards him a long file of naked captives, bound ready for sacrifice.^ The
resistance of the Lulume was, however, finally overcome by
Ramman-nirari, the son of Budilii ; he strengthened the suzerainty
gained by his predecessor over the Guti, the Cossaeans, and the
Shubarti, and he employed the spoil taken from them in beau
tifying the temple of Assur.^ He had occasion to spend some
time in the regions of the Upper Tigris, warring against the
Shubari, and a fine bronze sabre belonging to him has been found
near Diarbekir, among the ruins of the ancient Amidi, where, no
doubt, he had left it as an offering in one of the temples.^
He was succeeded by Shalmanuasharid,^ better known to us
as Shalmaneser I., one of the most powerful sovereigns of this
heroic age of Assyrian history. His reign seems to have been
one continuous war against the various races then in a state of
ferment on the frontiers of his kingdom. He appears in the
main to have met with success, and in a few years had doubled
the extent of his dominions.® His most formidable attacks were
directed against the Aramaeans of Mount Masios, whose numerous
tribes had advanced on one side till they had crossed the Tigris,
while on the other they had pushed beyond the river Balikh, and

had probably reached the Euphrates^ He captured their towns one after
another, razed their fortresses, smote the agricultural districts with fire and
sword, and then turned upon the various peoples who had espoused their
cause—the Kirkhu, the Euri, the Kharriu,'^ and the Muzri, who inhabited
the territory between the basins of the two great rivers ;
^ once, indeed, he
even crossed tlie Euphrates and ventured within the country of Khanigalbat,
a feat which his ancestors had never even attempted.'^ He was recalled by a
revolt which had broken out in the scattered cities of the district of Dur
Ivurigalzu ; he crushed the rising in spite of the help which Kadash-manburiash,
King of Babylon, had given to the rebels,® and was soon successful in subduing
the princes of Lulume.® These were not the raids of a day’s duration, under
taken, without any regard to the future, merely from love of rapine or adventure.
Shalmaneser desired to bring the regions which he annexed permanently under
the authority of Assyria, and to this end he established military colonies
in suitable places, most of which were kept up long after his death ’ He
seems to have directed the internal affairs of his kingdom with the same
* The identity of the Arami (written also Armaya, Arumi, Ariini) with the Aramaeans, admitted by the earlier Assyriologists, Eawlinson, Oppert, Hincks, Talbot (cf., latterly, Norris, Assyrian Dfcf.,. vol. i. p. 52, and Finzi, Ricerche per lo Studio dell' Anticliita Assira, pp. 206-212), is still universally accepted (Fr. Delttzsch, TFo lag das Paradiesi pp. 257, 258 ; Hommel, Gesch. Bah. und Ass , p. 507 \ViscKLER, Gesch. Israels, vol. i. p. 136). - Tlie people of the country of Kilkhi, or Kirkhi, the Kurkhi, occupied the region between the Tigris at Diarbekir and the mountains overlooking the lake of Urumiali (Schrader, Keilinschriflen, etc., pp. 1-15-147 ; Homjiel, Gesch. Bah. und Ass , p. 522). The position of the Ruri is not known, but it is certain tliat on one side they joined the Araiueeans, and that they were in the neighbourhood of Tushkiian (Anna/s of Assurnazirpal, col. ii. 11. 2-8). Kharran is the Harrau of the Balikh,. mentioned on pp. 26, 27 of the present work. ^ The name of Muzri frequently occurs, and in various positions, among the countries mentioned by the Assyrian conquerors (Opi’ert, Ilistoire des Empires de Chaldee et d’ Assyrie, pp. 52, 109 Fr. Lenormant, Sur une pr^tendue mention de I’Egyple dans un texte assyrien, in the Zeitschrift, 1870, pp. 21-24, 71, 72; Schrader, Das Balctrische Kamel und das ostliche Land Musri der Keilinsehriften, in the Zeils. der Deut. Morgenl. Ges., vol. xxiv. p. 436, et seq., and Keilinsehriften und Geschichtsjorschung,
pp. 246-282) : tlie frequency of its occurrence is easily explained if, according to Hommel {Gesch. Bah. und Ass., p. 530, note 2), we are to regard it as a purely Assyrian term used to designate the military confines or marches of the kingdom at different epochs of its history. The Muzri hero in question is the borderland situated in the vicinity of Cilicia (Tiele, Bah.-Assyrische Gesch., p. 201), probably the Sophene and the Gumathene of classical geographers : Winckler appears to me to exaggerate their importance when he says they were spread over the whole of Northern Syria as early as the time of Shalmaneser I. (Alttestamejitliche Untersuchungen, p. 172). * Khanigalbat is the name of the province in which Milid was placed (Schrader, Keilinsehriften und Gesch ichtsforschung, pp. 151, et seq., 530, 531); for the connection which has been attempted
between this name, transcribed Khani-rabbat and translated “ Khani the Great,” and that of the Khati, cf. wliat I have already stated, supra, p. 353. * In interpreting this passage I have followed the translation of G. Smith {On Fragments of an Inscription giving part of the Chronology, etc., in the Transactions of., the ,Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. iii.
pp. 366, 367), who appears to have read the text when in a less mutilated state than it is now in
(Hommel, Gesch. Bab. und Assyriens, p. 437, note 2). ® This campaign against the people of Lulume is known to us through the fragmentary inscription
discovered by G. Smith at Kalah-Shergat {Assyrian Discoveries, pp. 248, 249 ; cf. Hommel, Gesch.

TVKULTI-NINIP L TAKES BABYLON. 609
firmness and energy which he displayed in his military expeditions. It was
no light matter for the sovereign to decide on a change in the seat of govern
ment; he ran the risk of offending, not merely his subjects, but the god who
presided over the destinies of the State, and neither his throne nor his life
would have been safe had he failed in his attempt. Shalmaneser, however, did
not hesitate to make the change, once he was fully convinced of the drawbacks
presented by Assiir as a capital. True, he beautified the city, restored its
temples, and permitted it to retain all its privileges and titles; but having done
so, he migrated with his court to the town of Kalakh, where his descendants con
tinned to reside for several centuries. His son Tukulti-ninip made himself master
of Babylon, and was the first of his race who was able to claim the title of King
of Sumir and Akkad. The Cossaeans were still suffering from their defeat at the
hands of Eamman-nirari. Four of their princes had followed Kazimaruttash
on the throne in rapid succession—Kadashmanturgu, Kadashmanburiash, who
was attacked by Shalmaneser, a certain Isammeti whose name has been mutilated,
and lastly, Shagaraktiburiash : Bibeiasdu, son of this latter, was in power at
the moment when Tukulti-ninip ascended the throne. War broke out between
the two monarchs, but dragged on without any marked advantage on one side
or the other, till at length the conflict was temporarily suspended by a treaty
similar to others which had been signed in the course of the previous two or
three centuries.^ The peace thus concluded might have lasted longer but for
an unforeseen catastrophe which placed Babylon almost at the mercy of her
rival. The Elamites had never abandoned their efforts to press in every
conceivable way their claim to the supremacy, which, prior to Khammurabi,
' The passage from the Synchronous History (col. ii. 11. 1, 2), republished by Winckler (Untersuchungen zur Altorientalischen Geschichte, p. 152, 3“ recto, 11. 9, 10), contains the termination of the mutilated name of a Babylonian king . . . ashu, which, originally left undecided by Winckler (JJntersuchungen, p. 32), has been restored “Bibeiashu” by Hilprecht, in the light of monuments discovered at Nipur {The Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania, vol. i. p. 11, and Assyriaca, vol. i. p. 85, et seq.), an emendation which has since then been accepted by Winckler {Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 109, 110, 123). Winckler, on his part, has restored the passage on the assumption that the name of the King of Assyria engaged against Bibeiashu was Tukulti-ninip; then, combining this fragment with that in the Pinches Chronicle, which deals with the taking of Babylon, he argues that Bibeiashu was the king dethroned by Tukulti-ninip {Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 123-127, 137). An examination of the dates, in so far as they are at present known to us from the various documents, seems to me to render this arrangement inadmissible. The Pinches Chronicle practically tells us that Tukulti-ninip reigned over Babylon for seven years, when the Chaldseans revolted, and named Kammanshumusur king (col. iii. 11. 7-9). Now, the Babylonian Canon gives us the following reigns lor this epoch : Bibeiashu 8 years, Belnadinshumu 1 year 6 months, Kadashmankharbe 1 year 6 months, Eammannadlnshumu 6 years, Kammanshumusur 30 years, or 9 years between the end of the reign of Bibeiashu and the beginning of that of Kammanshumusur, instead of the 7 years given us by the Pinches Chronicle for the length of the reign of Tukulti-ninip at Babylon. If we reckon, as the only documents known require us to do, seven years from the beginning of the reign of Kammanshumusur to the date of the taking of Babylon, we are forced to admit that this took place in the reign of Kadashmankharbe II., and, consequently, that the passage in the Synchronous History, in which mention is made of Bibeiashu, must be interpreted as I have done in the text, by the hypothesis of a war prior to that in which Babylon fell, which was followed by a treaty between this prince and the King of Assyria.

GIO THE RISE OF TEE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
had been exercised by their ancestors over the whole of Mesopotamia; they
swooped down on Karduniasb with an impetuosity like that of the Assyrians,
and probably with the same alternations of success and defeat. Their king,
Kidinkhutrutash, unexpectedly attacked Belnadinshumu, son of Bibeiashu,
appeared suddenly under tlie walls of Nipur and forced the defences of Durilu
and Etimgarkalamma : Belnadinshumu disappeared in the struggle after a
reign of eighteen months. Tukulti-ninip left Belnadinshumu’s successor, Ka
dashmankharbe II., no time to recover from this disaster ; he attacked him in
turn, carried Babylon by main force, and put a number of the inhabitants to
the sword. He looted the palace and the temples, dragged the statue of Mero
dach from its sanctuary and carried it off into Assyria, together with the badges
of supreme power; then, after appointing governors of his own in the various
towns, he returned to Kalakh, laden with booty : he led captive with him
several members of the royal family —among others, Rammanshumusur, the
lawful successor of Bibeiashu.
This first conquest of Chaldsea did not, however, produce any lasting results.
The fall of Babylon did not necessarily involve the subjection of the whole
country, and the cities of the south showed a bold front to the foreign intruder,
and remained faithful to Kadashmankharbe ; on the death of the latter, some
months after his defeat, they hailed as king a certain Rammanshumnadin,
who by some means or other had made his escape from captivity. Ramman
shumnadin proved himself a better man than his predecessors ; when Kidin
khutrutash, never dreaming, apparently, that he would meet with any serious
resistance, came to claim his share of the spoil, he defeated him near Ishin,
drove him out of the districts recently occupied by the Elamites, and so
effectually retrieved his fortunes in this direction, that he was able to concen
trate his whole attention on what was going on in the north. The effects of
his victory soon became apparent : the nobles of Akkad and Karduniash
declined to pay homage to their Assyadan governors, and, ousting them from
the offices to which they had been appointed, restored Babylon to the inde
pendence w'hich it had lost seven years previously. Tukulti-ninip paid dearly
for his incapacity to retain his conquests : his son Assurnazirpal I. conspired
with the principal officers, deposed him from the throne, and confined him in the
fortified palace of Kar-Tukulti-ninip, wdiich he had built not far from Kalakh,
where he soon after contrived his assassination. About this time Rammanshum
nadin disappears, and we can only suppose that the disasters of these last years
had practically annihilated the Cossaean dynasty, for Rammanshumusur, who
was a prisoner in Assyria, was chosen as his successor. The monuments tell us
nothing definite of the troubles which next befell the two kingdoms ; we seem
to gather, however, that Assyria became the scene of civil wars, and that the



BELKIJBUEUSUR AND THE LAST OF THE C0SSH:ANS. 611
sons of Tukulti-ninip fought for the crown among themselves. Tukultiassurbel,
who gained the upper hand at the end of six years, set Eammanshumusur at
liberty, probably with the view of purchasing the support of the Chaldaeans, but
he did not succeed in restoring his country to the position it had held under
Shalmaneser and Tukulti-ninip The history of Assyria presents a greater
number of violent contrasts and extreme vicissitudes than that of any otlier
Eastern people in the earliest times. No sooner had the Assyrians arrived,
thanks to the ceaseless efforts of five or six generations, at the very summit
of their ambition, than some incompetent, or perhaps merely unfortunate, king
appeared on the scene, and lost in a few years all the ground which had been
gained at the cost of such tremendous exertions : then the subject races would
rebel, the neighbouring peoples would pluck up courage and reconquer the
provinces which they had surrendered, till the dismembered empire gradually
shrank back to its original dimensions. As the fortunes of Babylon rose, those
ot Nineveh suffered a corresponding depression: Babylon soon became so
powerful that Eammanshumusur was able to adopt a patronising tone in
his relations with Assurnirari 1. and Nabodainani, the descendants of Tukul
tiassurbel, who at one time shared the throne together.^ This period of
subjection and humiliation did not last long. Belkudurusur, who appears
on the throne not long after Assurnirari and his partner, resumed military
operations against the Cossseans, but cautiously at first ; and though he
fell in the decisive engagement, yet Eammanshumusur perished with him,
and the two states were thus simultaneously left rulerless. Milishikhu suc
ceeded Eammanshumusur, and Ninipabalesharra filled the place of Belku
durusur ; the disastrous invasion of Assyria by the Chaldaeans, and their
subsequent retreat, at length led to an armistice, which, while it afforded
* The sole authority for all these events is the Pinches Chronicle (col. iii. 11. 3-23). In classifying them, I have accepted, in addition to the hypothesis put forward on p. 609, supra, Hommel’s conjecture, put forward by Winckler, Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 138, 139. The scribe must have divided the events which took place during these years into two series. He first relates those which refer to the relations of Babylon with Assyria (11. 3-13), then he comes to the events which took place between Babylonia and Elam (11. 14-20). I have restored them to their proper order. C. Niebuhr regards the name of Tukultiassurbel as being that of the Assyrian limmu, under which the events of the sixth year took [place ; the Babylonian author, unfamiliar with Assyrian usages, misunderstood the text in which this person is mentioned, and takes him to be a king {Studien und Bemerkungen zur Geschichte des Alien Orients, pp. 83-87). Wincklee, Altorientalische Forschungen, p. 269, n. 1, accepts Niebuhr’s conjecture. ^ All that we know of these two kings is contained in the copy, executed in the time of Assurbanipal, of a letter addressed to them by Rammanshumusur, fragments of which have been published by Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iii. pi. 4, No. 5. They have been placed, at one time or another, either at the beginning of Assyrian history before Assurbelnishishu (Menant, Annales des rois d’Assyrie, p. 21 ; Wincklee, Gesch.Bdb. und Assyr., pp. 102, 103, 156, 157, 330, 331), or after Tiglathpileser I., about the XB** or X*’’, or even the VIIB'' century before our era (Hommel, Gesch. Bab. und Assyr., pp. 156, 422, n. 1, 639, n. 1, 645, 646 ; Tiele, Bdbyl.-Assyrische Gesch., pp. 166, 177). It has since been discovered that the Eammanshumusur who wrote this letter was the successor of Tukultininip I. in Chaldsea (Bezold, Kurzgefasster Ueberhlick, p. 20 ; Sayce, Records of the Past, 2nd series, vol. ii. p. 207, vol. v. p. Ill, note 2; Wincklee, Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 124, 125, 136, 137).



612 THE BISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
evidence of the indisputable superiority of Milishikhu, proved no less plainly
the independence of his rival.^ Meroilaehabaliddina I. replaced Milishikhu,
Zamamashumiddin followed Merodachabaliddina : Assurdau I., son of Ninipaba
lesharra, broke the treaty, captured the towns of Zaban, Irria, and Akarsallu,
and succeeded in retaining them. The advantage thus gained was hut a
slight one, for these provinces lying between the two Zabs had long been
subject to Assyria, and had been wrested from her since the days of Tukulti
ninip : however, it broke the run of ill luck which seemed to have pursued
her so relentlessly, and opened the way for more important victories.^ This
was the last Cosseean war ; at any rate, the last of which we find any mention
in history : Belnadinshumu II. reigned three years after Zamamashumiddin,
but when he died there was no man of his family whom the priests could
invite to lay hold of the hand of Merodach, and his dynasty ended with him.
It included thirty-six kings, and had lasted five hundred and seventy-six
years and six months.^ It had enjoyed its moments of triumph, and at one
time had almost seemed destined to conquer the whole of Asia ; but it
appears to have invariably failed just as it was on the point of reaching the
goal, and it became completely exhausted by its victories at the end of every
two or three generations. It had triumphed over Elam, and yet Elam re
mained a constant peril on its right. It had triumphed over Assyria, yet
Assyria, after driving it back to the regions of the Upper Tigris, threatened to
bar the road to the Mediterranean by means of its Masian colonies : were they
once to succeed in this attempt, what hope would there be left to those who
ruled in Babylon of ever after re-establishing the traditional empire of the
ancient Sargon and Khammurabi ?
The new dynasty sprang from a town in Pashe, the geographical position

of which is not known.^ It was of Babylonian origin, and its members placed,
at the beginning of their protocols, formulte which were intended to indicate,
in the clearest possible manner, the source from which they sprang : they
declared themselves to be scions of Babylon, its vicegerents, and supreme
masters.^ The names of the first two we do not know: the third, Nebuchad
rezzar, shows himself to have been one of the most remarkable men of all
those who flourished during this troubled era.^ At no time, perhaps, had
Chaldma been in a more abject state, or assailed by more active foes. The
Elamite had just succeeded in wresting from her Namar, the region from
whence the bulk of her chariot-horses were obtained,^ and this success had
laid the provinces on the left bank of the Tigris ® open to their attacks. They
had even crossed the river, pillaged Babylon, and carried away the statue of
Bel and that of a goddess named Eria, the patroness of Khussi :

‘ The term Dynasty of Pashe occurs in the Eoyal Canon (Pinches, Babylonian Kings of the Second Period, in the Proceedings oi Bibl. Arch. Soc., 1883-8i, vol. vi. p. 19G). From a passage in the list published by Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. ii. pi. 53, 1. 13 a, Sayce is led to think that Pashe was one of the names of Ishin {The Dynastic Tablets and Chronicles of the Babylonians, in the Records of the Past, 2nd series, vol. i. p. 17). ^ Hommel, Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 451. * The names of the first eight kings have disappeared from the only copy we possess of the Eoyal Canon (Pinches, Babylonian Kings of the Second Period, p. 19G). Nebuchadrezzar I.’s place in the series has, therefore, been the subject of much controversy. Several Assyriologists were from the first inclined to place him in the first or second rank, some being in favour of the first (Hommel, Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, pp. 448, 451 ; M. Jasteow, A Cylinder of Marduhtabihzirim, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. iv. pp. 317, 318), others preferring the second (Oppbrt, La Nonidentity de Phul et de Tiglathphalasar, prouvye par les texles cuneiformes, in the Revue d' Assyriologie, vol. i. pp. 169, 170) ; Delitzsch put him into the fifth place (Delitzsch-Murdter, Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, 2nd edit., Tabelle), and Winckler, without pronouncing definitely on the position to be assigned him, thought he must come in about half-way down the dynasty (JJntersuchungen zur altorientalischen Geschichte, pp. 28, 29, and Geschichte Babyloniens und Assyriens, p. 94). Hilprecht, on taking up the questions, adduced reasons for supposing hiin to have been the founder of the dynasty (The Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania, vol. i. pp. 39-44, and Assyriaca, vol. i. pp. 20-32), and his conclusions have haenadoptedhy Oppeit {La Fondation consacrye a la dyesse Nina, in the Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. vii. pp. 361-3G6) ; they have been disputed by Tiele {Zeitschrift fiir Assyriologie, vol. x. pp. 107-110), who wishes to put the king back to fourth or fifth in order, and by Winckler, who places him fourth or fifth {Altorientalische Forschungen, pp. 130, 131, 138, 266-268 ; cf. Eogees, Outlines of the History of Early Babylonia, p. 64). It is difficult, however, to accejit Hilprecht’s hypothesis, plausible though it is, so long as Assyriologists who have seen the original tablet (Pinches, Babylonian Kings of the Second Period, p. 196 : Schrader, Die Keilinschriftliehe Babylonische Konigsliste, in the Sitzungsberichte of the Berlin Academy of Sciences, 1887, vol. xxxi. ; Bezold, in the Zeitschr. fiir Ass., vol. iv. p. 317, note 1 ; Fr. Delitzsch, Assyritche Miscellen, in the Berichte of the Leipzig Academy of Sciences, 1893, p. 186 ; Knudtzon, Assyrische Gebete an den Sonnengott, vol. i. p. GO) agree in declaring that the name of the first king began with the sign of Merodach and not with that of Nebo, as it ought to do, were this prince really our Nebuchadrezzar. “* As to the breed of horses referred to, cf. Boscawen, The Morses of Namar, in the Babylonian and Oriental Record, vol. vi. pp. 139, 140. ‘ These facts are manifest from the events recorded in the Donation to Rittimerodach, published by H.

could no longer “ take his hands ” on their coming to the throne, and were
obliged to reign without proper investiture in consequence of their failure to
fulfil the rite required by religious lawsd Nebuchadrezzar arose “in Babylon,

roaring like a lion, even as Ramman roareth, —and his chosen nobles roared
like lions with him. —To Merodach, lord of Babylon, rose his prayer :—‘ How
long, for me, shall there be sighing and groaning?—How long, for my land,
weeping and mourning ?— How long, for my countries, cries of grief and
tears ? Till what time, 0 lord of Babylon, wilt thou remain in hostile
regions ?—Let thy heart be softened, and make Babylon joyful,—and let
thy face be turned toward Esbaggil which thou lovest !
’ ” Merodach gave
ear to the plaint of his servant ; he answered him graciously and promised
his aid.^ Namar, united as it had been with Chaldaea for centuries, did
not readily become accustomed to its new masters. The greater part of the
land belonged to a Semitic and Cossaean feudality, the heads of which,
while admitting their suzerain’s right to exact military service from them,
refused to acknowledge any further duty towards him. The kings of Susa
declined to recognise their privileges : they subjected them to a poll-tax,
levied the usual imposts on their estates, and forced them to maintain at their
own expense the troops quartered on them for the purpose of guaranteeing
their obedience.^ Several of the nobles abandoned everything rather than
submit to such tyranny, and took refuge with Nebuchadrezzar: others entered
into secret negotiations with him, and promised to support him if he came to
their help with an armed force.^ He took them at their word, and invaded

parclied-up country. One of the malcontents, Rittimerodach, lord of Bitkarzi
abku, joined Nebuchadrezzar with all the men he could assemble, and together
they penetrated as far as Ulai. The King of Elam, taken by surprise, made no
attempt to check their progress, but collected his vassals and awaited their
attack on the banks of the river in front of Susa. Once “ the fire ” of the
combat “ had been lighted between the opposing forces, the face of the sun
grew dark, the tempest broke forth, the whirlwind raged, and in this whirl
wind of the struggle none of the characters could distinguish the face of his
neighbour.” Nebuchadrezzar, cut off from his own men, was about to sur
render or be killed, when Eittimerodach flew to his rescue and brought him off
safely. In the end the Chaldseans gained the upper hand.^ The Elamites
renounced their claims to the possession of Namar, and restored the statues of
the gods : Nebuchadrezzar “ at once laid hold of the hands of Bel,” and thus
legalised his accession to the throne.^ Other expeditions against the peoples
of Lulume and against the Cossaeans restored his supremacy in the regions
of the north-east, and a campaign along the banks- of the Euphrates opened
out the road to Syria.^ He rewarded generously those who had accompanied
him on his raid against Elam. After issuing regulations intended to maintain
the purity of the breed of horses for which Namar was celebrated,^ he rein
stated in their possessions Shamua and his son Shamai, the descendants of one
of the priestly families of the province, granting them in addition certain
domains near IJpi, at the mouth of the Turnat. He confirmed Eittimerodach
in possession of all his property, and reinvested him with all the privileges of
which the King of Elam had deprived him. From that time forward the
domain of Bitkarziabku was free of the tithe on corn, oxen, and sheep ; it was
no longer liable to provide horses and mares for the exchequer, or to afford
free passage to troops in time of peace; the royal jurisdiction ceased on the
boundary of the fief, the seignorial jurisdiction alone extended over the inha
bitants and their property. Chaldaean prefects ruled in Namar, at Khalman,®

bear in mind that the text lays emphasis on the drought and severity of the season, we are tempted to agree with Pinches and Budge (Om an Edict of Nebuchadnezzar I., in the Proceedings, 1883-84, vol. vii. p. 145) that its statements should be taken literally. The affair may have been begun in a cloud of dust, and have ended in a downpour of rain so lieavy as to partly blind the combatants. The king was probably drawn away from his men in the confusion ; it was probably then that he was in danger of being made prisoner, and that Eittimerodach, suddenly coming up, delivered him from the foes who surrounded him.

and at the foot of the Zagros, and Nebuchadrezzar no longer found any to
oppose him save the King of Assyria.
The long reign of Assurdan in Assyria does not seem to have been dis
tinguished hy any event of importance either good or bad : it is true he won
several towns on the south-east from the Babylonians, but then he lost several
others on the north-west to the Mushku,^ and the loss on the one side fully
balanced the advantage gained on the other. His son Mutakkilnusku lived
in Assur at peace,^ but his grandson, Assurishishi, was a mighty king, con
queror of a score of countries, and the terror of all rebels; he scattered the
hordes of the Akhlame and broke up their forces ; then Ninip, the champion
of the gods, permitted him to crush the Lulume and the Guti in their valleys
and on their mountains covered with forests.'"^ He made his way up to the
frontiers of Elam,^ and his encroachments on territories claimed by Babylon
stirred up the anger of the Chaldaeans against him ; Nebuchadrezzar made
ready to dispute their ownership with him. The earlier engagements went
against the Assyrians ; they were driven back in disorder, but the victor lost
time before one of their strongholds, and, winter coming on before he could take
it, he burnt his engines of war, set fire to his camp, and returned home. Next
year, a rapid march carried him right under the walls of Assur; then As
surishishi came to the rescue, totally routed his opponent,® captured forty of
his chariots, and drove him flying across the frontier. The war died out of
itself, its end being marked by no treaty : each side kept its traditional position
and supremacy over the tribes inhabiting the basins of the Turnat and Eadanu.
* Hommel, Geschichte Bahyloniens und Assyriens, p. 510, has proved, by a very simple calculation, that Assurdaii must have been the king iu whose reign the Mushku made the inroad into the basin of the Upper Tigris and of the Baliklj, which is mentioned iu the Annals of Tiglath-pileser I, col. i. 11. 62-G9 ; cf. what is said on this point on p. 591, supra. These Annals, col. vii. 11. 4:9-54, are our authority for stating that Assurdan was on the throne for a long period, though the exact length of his reign is not known. “ Annals of Tiglath-pileser 1., col. vii. 11. 45-48.

TEE LEGEND OF NINOS AND SEMISAMIS. 617
The same names reappear in line after line of these mutilated Annals, and the
same definite enumerations of rebellious tribes who have been humbled or
punished. These kings of the plain, both Ninevite and Babylonian, were
continually raiding the country up and down for centuries without ever arriving
at any decisive result, and a detailed account of their various campaigns would
be as tedious reading as that of the ceaseless struggle between the Latins and
Sabines which fills the opening pages of Roman history. Posterity soon grew
weary of them, and, misled by the splendid position which Assyria attained
when at the zenith of its glory, set itself to fabricate splendid antecedents for
the majestic empire established by the later dynasties. The legend ran that,
at the dawn of time, a chief named Ninos had reduced to subjection one after
the other — Babylonia, Media, Armenia, and all the provinces between the
Indies and the Mediterranean. He built a capital for himself on the banks of
the Tigris, in the form of a parallelogram, measuring a hundred and fifty stadia
in length, ninety stadia in width ; altogether, the walls were four hundred and
eighty stadia in circumference. In addition to the Assyrians who formed the
bulk of the population, he attracted many foreigners to Nineveh, so that in a
few years it became the most flourishing town in the whole world. An inroad
of the tribes of the Oxus interrupted his labours : Ninos repulsed the invasion,
and, driving the barbarians back into Bactria, laid siege to it ; here, in the
tent of one of his captains, he came upon Semiramis, a woman whose past was
shrouded in mystery. She was said to be the daughter of an ordinary mortal
by a goddess, the Ascalonian Deiketo. Exposed immediately after her birth,
she was found and adopted by a shepherd named Simas, and later on her beauty
aroused the passion of Oannes, governor of Syria. Ninos, amazed at the
courage displayed by her on more than one occasion, carried her off, made her
his favourite wife, and finally met his death at her hands. No sooner did she
become queen, than she founded Babylon on a far more extensive scale than
that of Nineveh. Its walls were three hundred and sixty stadia in length,
with two hundred and fifty lofty towers, placed here and there on its circuit,
the roadway round the top of the ramparts being wide enough for six chariots
to drive abreast. She made a kind of harbour in the Euphrates, threw a bridge
across it, and built quays one hundred and sixty stadia in length along its
course ; in the midst of the town she raised a temple to Bel. This great work
was scarcely finished when disturbances broke out in Media ; these she promptly
repressed, and set out on a tour of inspection through the whole of her pro
vinces, with a view to preventing the recurrence of similar outbreaks by her
presence. Wherever she went she left records of her passage behind her,
cutting her way through mountains, quarrying a pathway through the solid

rock, making broad highways for herself, bringing
rebellious tribes beneath her yoke, and raising
tumuli to mark the tombs of such
of her satraps as fell beneath the
blows of the enemy. She built
Ecbatana in Media, Semiramocarta
on Lake Van in Armenia, and Tarsus in
Cilicia ; then, having reached the confines of
THE DOVE-GODDESS.*1
Syria, she crossed the isthmus, and conquered
Egypt and Ethiopia. The far-famed wealth of India recalled her from the
banks of the Nile to those of the Euphrates, en route for the remote east, but
at this point her good fortune forsook her ; she was defeated by King Strato
bates, and returned to her own dominions, never again to leave them. She
had set up triumphal stelae on the boundaries of the habitable globe, in the
very midst of Scythia, not far from the laxartes, where, centuries afterwards,
Alexander of Macedon read the panegyric of herself which she had caused
to be engraved there. “Nature,” she writes, “gave me the body of a woman,
but my deeds have put me on a level with the greatest of men. I ruled over
the dominion of Ninos, which extends eastwards to the river Hinaman, south
wards to the countries of Incense and Myrrh, and northwards as far as the
Sacse and Sogdiani. Before my time no Assyrian had ever set eyes on the
sea : I have seen four oceans to which no mariner has ever sailed, so far remote
are they. I have made rivers to flow where I would have them, in the places
where they were needed ; thus did I render fertile the barren soil by watering
it with my rivers. I raised up impregnable fortresses, and cut roadways through
the solid rock with the pick. I opened a way for the wheels of my chariots in
places to which even the feet of wild beasts had never penetrated. And,
amidst all these labours, I yet found time for my pleasures and for the society
of my friends.” On discovering that her sonNinyaswas plotting her assassina
tion, she at once abdicated in his favour, in order to save him from committing
a crime, and then transformed herself into a dove ; this last incident betrays
the goddess to us. Ninos and Semiramis are purely mythical, and their mighty
deeds, like those ascribed to Ishtar and G-ilgames, must be placed in the same
category as those other fables with which the Babylonian legends strive to fill
up the blank of the prehistoric })eriod.^

THE RACE AND ITS POLITICAL CONSTITUTION. 619
The real facts were, as we know, far less
brilliant and less extravagant than those sup
plied by popular imagination. It would be a
mistake, however, to neglect or despise them
on account of their tedious monotony and
the insignificance of the characters who appear
on the stage. It was by dint of fighting her
neighbours again and again, without a single
day’s respite, that Rome succeeded in forging
the weapons with which she was to conquer
the world ; and any one who, repelled by their
tedious sameness, neglected to follow the his
tory of her early struggles, would find great
difficulty in understanding how it came about
that a city which had taken centuries to subjugate
her immediate neighbours should afterwards overcome
all the states on the Mediterranean seaboard with such AS ASSYRIAN.'
magnificent ease. In much the same way the ceaseless
struggles of Assyria with the Chaldaeans, and with the mountain tribes of
the Zagros Chain, were unconsciously preparing her for those lightning-like
campaigns in which she afterwards overthrew all the civilized nations of tlie
East one after another. It was only at the cost of unparalleled exertions that
she succeeded in solidly welding together the various provinces within her
borders, and in kneading (so to speak) the many and diverse elements of her vast
population into one compact mass, containing in itself all that was needful for
its support, and able to bear the strain of war for several years at a time without
giving way, and rich enough in men and horses to provide the material for an
effective army without excessive impoverishment of her trade or agriculture.
Tlie race came of an old Semitic strain, somewhat crude as yet, and almost
entirely free from that repeated admixture of foreign elements which had
marred the purity of the Babylonian stock. The monuments show us a type
similar in many respects to that which we find to-day on the slopes of Singar,
or in the valleys to the east of Mossul.^ The figures on the monuments are
tall and straight, broad-shouldered and wide in the hips, the arms well developed,
the legs robust, with good substantial feet. The swell of the muscles on the
naked limbs is perhaps exaggerated, but this very exaggeration of the modelling
suggests the vigour of the model ; it is a heavier, more rustic type than the

promising greater strength and power of resistance, and in so far an
indisputable superiority in the great game of war. The head is somewhat
small, the forehead low and flat, the eyebrows heavy, the eye of a bold almond
shape, with heavy lids, the nose aquiline, and full at the tip, with wide nostrils
terminating in a hard well-defined curve ; the lips are thick and full, the chin
bony, while the face is framed by the coarse dark wavy hair and beard, which
tell in curly masses over the nape of the neck and the breast. The expression
of the face is rarely of an amiable and smiling type, such as we find in the
statues of the Theban period or in those of the Memphite empire, nor, as a
matter of fact, did the Assyrian pride himself on the gentleness of his manners :
he did not overflow with love for his fellow-man, as the Egyptian made a
pretence of doing ; on the contrary, he was stiff-necked and proud, without pity
lor others or for himself, hot-tempered and quarrelsome like his cousins of
Chaldaea, but less turbulent and more capable of strict discipline. It mattered
not whether he had come into the world in one of the wretched cabins of a
fellah village, or in the palace of one of the great nobles ; he was a born soldier,
and his whole education tended to develop in him the first qualities of the
soldier-—temperance, patience, energy, and unquestioning obedience ; he was
enrolled in an army which was always on a war footing, commanded by the god
Assur, and under Assur, by the king, the vicegerent and representative of the
god. His life was shut in by the same network of legal restrictions which con
fined that of the Babylonians, and all its more important events had to be re
corded on tablets of clay ; the w'ording of contracts, the formalities of marriage
or adoption, the status of bond and free, the rites of the dead and funeral
ceremonies, had either remained identical with those in use during the earliest
years of the cities of the Lower Euphrates, or differed from them only in their
less important details.^ The royal and municipal governments levied the same
taxes, used the same procedure, employed the same magistrates, and the grades
of their hierarchy were the same, witli one exception. After the king, the
highest office was filled by a soldier, the tartan who saw to the recruiting of
the troops, and led them in time of war, or took command of the staff-corps
whenever the sovereign himself deigned to appear on the scene of action.^
The more influential of these functionaries bore, in addition to their other titles,
one of a special nature, which, for the space of one year, made its holder the
most conspicuous man in the country ; they became limmii, and tliroughout
‘ In regard to all these points, cf. what is said in Maspeeo, Dawn of Civilization, p. VIS, et seq., 2ud edit. “ We can determine the rank occupied by the tartanu at court by the positions they occupy in the

those of the Greek archons and Roman consuls—furnished the annalists with a

with certainty.®

According to Delitzsch, the term lirau or limmu (Assyrisches Handworterhuch, p. 379, s. v.) meant at first any given period, then later more especially the year during which a magistrate filled his office ; in the opinion of most other Assyriologists it referred to the magistrate himself as eponymous archon. “ Drawn Boudier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum ; cf.

The king still retained the sacerdotal attributes with which Chaldaean
monarchs bad been invested from the earliest times, but contact with the
Egyptians had modified the
popular conception of his
personality. His subjects
were no longer satisfied to

they had come to discover
something of the divine
nature in him, and some
times identified him — not
with Assur, the master of
all things, who occupied a

courtiers, therefore, went as
far as to call him “ Sun ”
when they addressed him, and he himself adopted this title in his inscrip
tions.^ Formerly he had only attained this apotheosis after death, later on he
was permitted to aspire to it during his lii'etime.'^ The Chaldseans adopted
the same attitude, and in both countries the royal authority shone with the
(Peiseu, Bie Sleinplaltnyiin^olirift Rammun-nirari's I., in the Keilinschri/tliche Bihliotheic, vol. i. pp. 8, 9). Three diftereiit versions of the canon have come down to us. In the most important one the names of the eponymou.s ofUcials are written one after another without titles or any mention of important events ; in the other two, the titles of each personage, and any important occurrences which took place during his year of office, are entered after the name. ‘ Drawn by Bouilier, from a bas-relief in the British Museum ; cf. Layaud, The Monuments of Nineveh, vol. i. pi. 10. ^ Nebuchadrezzar I. of Babylon assumes the title of Shamash mati-shu, the “ Sun of his country ” {Donation to Rittimerodach, col. i. 1. 5), and Hilprecht rightly sees in this expression a trace of Egyptian influences {The BahijJonia)i Exp. of the Uniu. of Penn., vol. i. p. -12) ; later on, Assurnazirpal, King of Assyria, similarly describes himself as Shamshu hMishut nishi, the “ Sun of all mankind ” {Annals, col. i. 1. 10 ; cf.

Tide is of opinion that these expressions do not necessarily point to any theory of the actual incarnation of the god, as was the case in Egypt, but that they may be mere rhetorical figures {Bahylonisch-Assyrisi’hc Geschichte, p. 192). ^ In regard to the apotheosis of the Chaldaiau kings after thdr death, cf.

His chief amusement lay in the hunting of wild beasts : the majority of
the princes who reigned over Assyria had a better right than even Amen
othes III. himself to boast of the hundreds of lions which they had slain.^
They set out on these hunting expeditions with quite a small army of
charioteers and infantry, and were often away several days at a time, provided
urgent business did not require their presence in the palace. They started
their quarry with the help of large dogs,^ and followed it over hill and dale till
they got within bowshot : if it was but slightly wounded and turned on them,
they gave it the finishing stroke with their lances without dismounting.
Occasionally, however, they were obliged to follow their prey into places where

been rarely equalled in modern times. But while the Theban artist generally
re^u’esents it in an attitude of repose, the Assyrians prefer to show it in violent
action in all the various attitudes which it assumes during a struggle, either
crouching as it prepares to spring, or fully extended in the act of leaping
sometimes it rears into an upright position, with arched back, gaping jaws, and
claws protruded, ready to bite or strike its foe ; at others it writhes under a
spear-thrust, or rolls over and over in its dying agonies. In one instance, an
arrow has pierced the skull of a male lion, crashing through the frontal bone
a little above the left eyebrow, and protrudes obliquely to the right between
his teeth : under the shock of the blow he has risen on his hind legs, with
contorted spine, and beats the air with his fore paws, his head thrown back as

though to free himself of the fatal shaft. Not far from him the lioness lies
stretched out upon its back in the rigidity of death.^
The “rimu,” or urus, was, perhaps, even a more formidable animal to
encounter than any of the felidce, owing to the irresistible fury of his attack.
No one would dare, except in a case
of dire necessity, to meet him on foot.
The loose flowing robes which the king
and the nobles never put aside — not
even in such perilous pastimes as these

were ill fitted for the quick move
ments i-equired to avoid the attack of
such an animal, and those who were
unlucky enough to quit their chariot
ran a terrible risk of being gored or
trodden underfoot in the encounter.
It was the custom, therefore, to attack
the beast by arrows, and to keep it
at a distance. If the animal were
able to come up with its piirsueT,
the latter endeavoured to seize it by
the horn at the moment when it
lowered its head, and to drive his
dagger into its neck. If the blow were adroitly given it severed the spinal cord,
and the beast fell in a heap as if struck by lightning.® A victory over such
animals was an occasion for rejoicing, and solemn thanks were offered to Assur
and Ishtar, the patrons of the chase, at the usual evening sacrifice. The
slain beasts, whether lion or urus, were arranged in a row before the altar,
while the king, accompanied by his flabella- and umbrella-bearers, stood along
side them, holding his bow in his left hand. While the singers intoned the
hymn of thanksgiving to the accompaniment of the harp, the monarch took the
bowl of sacred wine, touched his lips with it, and then poured a portion of the
contents on the heads of the victims. A detailed account of each hunting
exploit was preserved for posterity either in inscriptions or on bas-reliefs.^

62G THE RISE OF TEE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
The chase was iu those days of great service to the rural population ; the kings
also considered it to be one of the duties attached to their office, and on a
level with their obligation to make war on neighbouring nations devoted by the
will of Assur to defeat and destruction.
The army charged to carry out the will of the god had not yet acquired

the homogeneity and efficiency which it afterwards attained, yet it had been
for some time one of the most formidable in the world, and even the Egyptians
themselves, in spite of their long experience in military matters, could not put
into the field such a proud array of effective troops. We do not know how
this army was recruited, but the bulk of it was made up of native levies, to
which foreign auxiliaries were added iu numbers varying with the times.^ A
permanent nucleus of troops was always in garrison in the capital under the
“ tartan,” or placed in the principal towns at the disposal of the governors.^
The contingents wliich came to be enrolled at these centres on the first rumour

Everything in the description which follows is taken from the monuments of Assurnaziri)al and Shalmaneser II., revised as far as possible by the inscriptions of Tiglath-pileser ; the armament of both infantry and chariotry must have been practically the same in the two periods. ^ This is based on the account given in the Ohelislc of Shalmaneser, where the king, for example, after having gathered his soldiers together at Kalakh [Calah], put at their head Dainassur the artan, “ the master of his innumerable troops” (11. 146-149; cf. 11. 141, 142, 175, 176).

of war may have been taken from among the feudal militia,
as was the custom in the Nile valley, or the whole popu
lation may have had to render personal military service,
each receiving while with the colours a certain daily pay.
The nobles and feudal lords were accustomed to call their
own people together, and either placed themselves at their
head or commissioned an ofScer to act in their behalf.^
These recruits were subjected to the training necessary for
their calling by exercises similar to those of the Egyptians,
but of a rougher sort and better adapted to the cumbrous
character of their equipment. The blacksmith’s art had
made such progress among the Assyrians since the times
of Thutmosis III. and Eamses II., that both the character
and the materials of the armour were entirely changed.
While the Egyptian of old entered into the contest almost
naked, and without other defence than a padded cap, a light shield, and a
leather apron, the Assyrian of the new
age set out for war almost cased in
metal. ^ The pikemen and archers of
whom the infautry of the line was com
posed wore a copper or iron helmet,
conical in form, and having cheek
pieces covering the ears ; they were clad
in a sort of leathern shirt covered with
plates or imbricated scales of metal,

short sword passed through the girdle, and an enormous shield, sometimes
round and convex, sometimes arched at the top and square at the bottom.
The bowmen did not encumber themselves with a buckler, but carried, in
addition to the bow and quiver, a poignard or mace. The light infantry
consisted of pikemen and archers—each of whom wore a crested helmet and a
round shield of wicker-work— of slingers and club-bearers, as well as of men
armed with the two-bladed battle-axe. The cliariots were heavier and larger

panels Avere of solid wood, sometimes covered with embossed or carved metal,
but frequently painted; they were further decorated sometimes with gold,
silver, or ivory mountings, and with precious stones. The pole, which was
long and heavy, ended in a boss of carved wood or incised metal, repre
senting a flower, a rosette, the muzzle of a lion, or a horse’s head. It was
attached to tne axle under the floor of the vehicle, and as it had to bear a
great strain, it was not only fixed to this point by leather thongs such as were
employed in Egypt, but also bound to the front of the chariot by a crossbar
shaped like a spindle, and covered with embroidered stuff—an arrangement
which prevented its becoming detached when driving at full speed. A pair of
horses were harnessed to it, and a third was attached to them on the right side
for the use of a supplementary warrior, who could take the place of his comrade
in case of accident, or if he were wounded. The trappings were very simple
but sometimes there was added to these a thickly padded caparison, of which
the various parts were fitted to the horse by tags so as to cover the upper
part of his head, his neck, back, and breast. The usual complement of
charioteers was two to each vehicle, as in Egypt, but sometimes, as among the

these animals, and a standing figure of Assur letting fly his arrows.^ The
chariotry formed, as in most countries of that time, the picked troops of the
service, in which the princes and great lords were proud to be enrolled. Upon
it depended for the most part the issue of the conflict, and the position assigned
to it was in the van, the king or commander-in-chief reserving to himself the
privilege of conducting the charge in person. It was already, however, in a
state of decadence, both as regards the number of units composing it ^ and its

Sennacherib was obliged to arrest his inarch against Elam, owing to his inability to cross the torrents swollen by the rain (Tay/o;- Prism, col. iv. 11. 7-1-79) ; a similar contretemps must have met Assurbanipal on the banks of the Ididi (Annals, col. v. 11. 95-103). ^ The Assyrian monarchs dwell with pleasure on the difliculties of the country which they have to overcome ; see, for instance, what Tiglath-pileser 1. says in his Atmah, col. ii. 11. 6-10, 69-77, col. iii. 11. 11-29, 11-60, col. iv. 11. 13-17, 5:V70.



TEE CROSSING OF RIVERS. G.31
cleared the way for the mass of infantry marching in columns, and for
the chariots, in the midst of which the king and his household took up
their station ; the baggage followed, together with the prisoners and their
escortsd If they came to a river where there was neither ford nor bridge,
they were not long in effecting a passage. Each soldier was provided with
a skin, which, having inflated it by the strength of his lungs and closed
the aperture, he embraced in his arms and cast himself into the stream.
Partly by floating and
partly by swimming, a
whole regiment could
soon reach the other
side. The chariots
could not be carried
over so easily. If the
bed of the river was
not very wide, and the
current not too violent,
a narrow bridge was
constructed, or rather
an improvised dyke
of large stones and rude gabions filled with clay, over which was spread
a layer of branches and earth, supplying a sufficiently broad passage for
a single chariot, of which the horses w'ere led across at walking pace.^ But
when the distance between the banks wms too great, and the stream too
violent to allow of this mode of procedure, boats were requisitioned from the
neighbourhood, on which men and chariots were embarked, while the horses,
attended by grooms, or attached by their bridles to the flotilla, swam across
the river.^ If the troops had to pass through a mountainous district intersected
by ravines and covered by forests, and thus impracticable on ordinary
occasions for a large body of men, the advance-guard were employed in cutting
a passage through the trees with the axe, and, if necessary, in making
with the pick pathways or rough-hewn steps similar to those met wdth in the

Those represented on pp. 629, 630 belong to the time of Shalmaneser II. * It was in this manner that Tiglath-pileser I. crossed the Euphrates on his way to the attack of Carchemish {Annals, col. v. 11. 57, 58).

Lebanon on the Phoenician coasts The troops advanced in narrow columns,
sometimes even in single file, along these improvised roads, always on the
alert lest they should be taken at a disadvantage by an enemy concealed
in the thickets. In case of attack, the foot-soldiers had each to think of
himself, and endeavour to
give as many blows as he
received ; but the chario
teers, encumbered by their
vehicles and tlie horses,
found it no easy matter
to extricate themselves
from tlie danger. Once the
chariots had entered into
the forest region, the driver
descended from his vehicle,
and led the horses by the
head, while the warrior and
his assistant were not slow
to follow his example, in
order to give some relief
to the animals by tugging
at the wheels. The king
alone did not dismount,
more out of respect for his
dignity than from indifference to the strain upon the animals ; for, in spite
of careful leading, he had to submit to a rough shaking from the inequali
ties of this rugged soil ; sometimes he had too much of this, and it is related
of him in his annals that he had crossed the mountains on foot like an
ordinary mortal.® A halt was made every evening, either at some village,
whose inhabitants were obliged to provide food and lodging, or, in default of
this, on some site which they could fortify by a hastily thrown up rampart of
earth. If they were obliged to remain in any place for a length of time, a
regular encircling wall was constructed, not square or rectangular like those

Tiglatli-pileser I. speaks on several occasions, and not without pride, of the roads that he had made for himself with bronze hatchets through the fore-sts and over the mountains (Annals, col. ii. 11. 7-10, col. iv. 11. 66, 67). ^ Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph by Mansell, taken in the British Museum. ^ Annals of Tiglatli-pileser I., col. ii. 11. 69-77, col. iii. 11. 45-47, col. vi. 11. 51, 52. The same fact is found in the accounts of every expedition, but more importance is attached to it as we approach the end of the Ninevite emirire, when the kings were not so well able to endure hardship. Sennacherib mentions it on several occasions, with a certain amount of self-pity for the fatigue he had undergone, but with a real pride in his own endurance (Taylor Prism, col. i. 11. 66-69, col. iii. 11. 71-82).

place to place ; they were surrounded with less pretentious buildings reserved
for the king’s household, and the stables. The tent-poles at the angles of
these habitations were plated with metal, and terminated at their upper
extremities in figures of goats and other animals made of the same material.
The tents of the soldiers were conical in form, and each was maintained in its
position by a forked pole placed inside. They contained the ordinary require
ments of the peasant —bed and head-rest, table with legs like those of a
gazelle, stools and folding-chairs ; the household utensils and the provisions
hung from the forks of the support. The monuments, which usually give
few details of humble life, are remarkable for their complete reproductions of
the daily scenes in the camp. We see on them the soldier making his bed,
grinding corn, dressing the carcase of a sheep which he has just killed, or
pouring out wine ; the pot boiling on the fire is watched by the vigilant eye
of a trooper or of a woman, while those not actively employed are grouped

Assur in the hope of surprising their enemy, and they often succeeded in
penetrating into the very heart of his country before he liad time to mobilise
or concentrate his forces. The work of subduing him was performed piecemeal
they devastated his fields, robbed his orchards, and, marching all through the
night, they would arrive with such suddenness before one or other of his towns,
that lie would have no time to organise a defence. Most of their campaigns
were mere forced marches across plains and mountains, wdthout regular sieges
or pitched battles. Should the enemy, however, seek an engagement, and the

execution took place without delay ; they were made to kneel down, with
their backs to the soldiery, their heads bowed, and their hands resting
on a flat stone or a billet of wood, in which position they were despatched
with clubs. The scribes, standing before their tent doors, registered the
number of heads cut off ; each soldier, bringing his quota and throwing it

their hands by some stroke of good fortune, they would at once attempt,
by an immediate assault, to terrify the garrison into laying down their
armsd The archers and slingers led the attack by advancing in couples
till they were within the prescribed distance from the walls, one of the two
taking careful aim, while the other sheltered his comrade behind his round
topped shield. The king
himself would sometimes
alight from his chariot and
let fly his arrows in the
front rank of the archers,
while a handful of resolute
men would rush against
the gates of the town and
attempt either to break
them down or set them
alight with torches. An
other party, armed with
stout helmets and quilted
jerkins, which rendered
them almost invulnerable
to the shower of arrows or stones poured on them by the besieged, would attempt
to undermine the walls by means of levers and pick-axes, and while thus en
gaged would be protected by mantelets flxed to the face of the walls, resembling
in shape the shields of the archers. Often bodies of men would approach the
suburbs of the city and endeavour to obtain access to the ramparts from the roofs
of the houses in close proximity to the W'alls. If, however, they could gain
admittance by none of these means, and time was of no consideration, they would
resign themselves to a lengthy siege, and the blockade would commence by
a systematic desolation of the surrounding country, in which the villages
scattered over the plain would be burnt, the vines torn up, and all trees
cut down. The Assyrians waged war with a brutality which the Egyptians
would never have tolerated. Unlike the Pharaohs, their kinsrs were not content
to imprison or put to death the principal instigators of a revolt, but their wrath
would fall upon the entire population. As long as a town resisted the efforts
of their besieging force, all its inhabitants bearing arms who fell into their
hands were subjected to the most cruel tortures ; they were cut to pieces

or impaled alive on stakes, whicli were planted in tlie ground just in front
of the lines, so that the besieged should enjoy a full view of the sufferings
of their comrades. Even during the course of a short siege this line of
stakes would be prolonged till it formed a bloody pale between the two
contending armies.^ This horrible spectacle had at least the effect of
shaking the courage of the besieged, and of hastening the end of hostilities.

were either massacred or transplanted en masse elsewhere.^ If the bulk of the
population w'ere spared and condemned to exile, the wealthy and noble were
shown no clemency ; they were thrown from the top of the city towers, their
ears and noses were cut off, their hands and feet were amputated, or they and
their children were roasted over a slow fire, or flayed alive, or decapitated, and
their heads piled up in a heap. The victorious sovereigns appear to have
taken a pride in the ingenuity with which they varied these means of torture,
and dwell with complacency on the recital of their cruelties. “I constructed a
pillar at the gate of the city,” is the boast of one of them ; “ I then flayed the
chief men, and covered the post with their skins; I suspended their dead bodies

Two or three executions of this kind usually sufficed to demoralise the
enemy. The remaining inhabitants assembled : terrified by the majesty of
Assur, and as it were blinded by the brightness of his countenance, they
sunk down at the knees of the victor and embraced his feet.^ The peace
secured at the price of their freedom left them merely with their lives and such
of their goods as could not be removed from the soil. The scribes thereupon
surrounded the spoil seized by the soldiery, and drew up a detailed inventory
of the prisoners and their property : everything worth carrying away to Assyria
was promptly registered, and despatched to the capital. The contents of the
royal palace led the way ; it comprised the silver, gold, and copper of the
vanquished prince, his caldrons, dishes and cups of brass, the women of his
harem, the maidens of his household, his furniture and stuffs, horses and
chariots, together with his men and women servants.^ The enemy’s gods,

642 THE RISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
AVe must, however, beware of thinking that the defeat of these tribes was as
crushing or their desolation as terrible as the testimony of the inscriptions
would lead us to suppose. The rulers of Nineveh were but too apt to
relate that this or that country had been conquered and its people destroyed,
when the Assyrian army had remained merely a week or a fortnight within its
territory, had burnt some half-dozen fortified towns, and taken two or three
thousand prisoners.^ If we were to accept implicitly all that is recorded
of the Assyrian exploits in Nairi or the Taurus, we should be led to believe
that for at least half a century the valleys of the Upper Tigris and Middle
Euphrates were transformed into a desert ; each time, however, that they are
subsequently mentioned on the occasion of some fresh expedition, they appear
once more covered with thriving cities and a vigorous population, whose
generals offer an obstinate resistance to the invaders. AA^e are, therefore,
forced to admit that the majority of these expeditions must be regarded as
mere raids. The population, disconcerted by a sudden attack, w^ould take
refuge in the woods or on the mountains, carrying with them their gods, whom
they thus preserved from captivity, together with a portion of their treasures
and cattle ; ^ but no sooner had the invader retired, than they descended
once more into the plain and returned to their usual occupations. The
Assyrian victories thus rarely produced the decisive results which are claimed
for them ; they almost always left the conquered people with sufficient energy
and resources to enable them to resume the conflict after a brief interval,
and the supremacy which the suzerain claimed as a result of his conquests
was of the most ephemeral nature. A revolt would suffice to shake it, while
a victory w'oukl be almost certain to destroy it, and once more reduce the
empire to the limits of Assyria proper.
Tukultiabalesharra, familiar to us under the name of Tiglath-pileser,^ is the
first of the great warrior-kings of Assyria to stand out before us with any definite
individuality. AVe find him, in the interval between two skirmishes, engaged
in hunting lions or in the pursuit of other wild beasts, and we see him lavishing
offerings on the gods and enriching their temples with the spoils of his
victories ; these, how'ever, w'ere not the normal occupations of this sovereign,
for peace with him was merely an interlude in a reign of conflict. He led all
' For example, Tiglatli-pileser I. conquers the Kummukh in the first year of his reign, burning, destroying, and depopulating the towns, and massacring “ the remainder of the Kummukh ” who had taken refuge in the mountains {Annals, col. i. 1. 89, col. ii. 11. 16, 56-58), after which, in his second campaign, he again pillages, burns, destroys, and depopulates the towns, and again massacres the remainder of the inhabitants hiding in the mountains {Annals, col. iii. 11. 11-35). He makes the same statements with regard to most of the other countries and peoples conquered by him, but we find them reappearing with renewed vigour on the scene, soon after their supposed destruction. “ Annals of Tiglatli-inleser I., col. ii. 11. 39-42, col. iii. 11. 16-25, 72-75. ^ Tiglath-pileser is one of the transcriptions given in the LXX. for the Hebrew version of the name : it signifies, “ The child of Esharra is my strength.” By “ the child of Esharra ” the Assyrians, like the Chaldseans, understood the child of Xiuib (Lotz, Die Inschriften Tiglath-pileser' s L, pp. 1-3).

his expeditions in person, undeterred by any consideration of fatigue or danger,
and scarcely had he returned from one arduous campaign, than he proceeded
to sketch the plan of that for the following year ; in short, he reigned only
to wage ward His father, Assurishishi, had bequeathed him not only a pros
perous kingdom, but a well-organised army, which he placed in the field
without delay. During the fifty years since the Mushku, descending through
the gorges of the Taurus, had invaded the Alzi and the Purukuzzi,^ Assyria
had not only lost possession of all the countries bordering the left bank of
the Euphrates, but the whole of Kummukh had withdrawn its allegiance from
her, and had ceased to pay tribute. Tiglath-pileser had ascended the throne
•only a few weeks ere he quitted Assur, marched rapidly across Eastern
Mesopotamia by the usual route, through Singar and Nisib, and climbing
the chain of the Kashiara, near Mardin, bore down into the very heart of
Kummukh, where twenty thousand Mushku, under the command of five kings,
resolutely awaited him. He repulsed them in the very first engagement, and
pursued them hotly over hill and vale, pillaging the fields, and encircling the
towns with trophies of human heads taken from the prisoners who had fallen into
his hands ; the survivors, to the number of six thousand, laid down their arms,
and were despatched to Assyria.^ The Kummukh contingents, however, had
been separated in the rout from the Mushku, and had taken refuge beyond
the Euphrates, near to the fortress of Shirisha, where they imagined them
selves in safety behind a rampart of mountains and forests. Tiglath-pileser
managed, by cutting a road for his foot-soldiers and chariots, to reach
their retreat : he stormed the place without apparent difficulty, massacred
the defenders, and then turning upon the inhabitants of Kurkhi,^ who were on
* We possess two different documents as materials for a study of the reign of Tiglath-pileser ; 1st. The Annals of his first five years, of which there are four copies published in Eawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. i. pis. 9-16, and also in Winckler, Sammlung von Keilschrifttexten L, pp. 1-25, translated in 1857 by four Assyriologists under the title of Inscription of Tiglath-Pileser L, King of Assyria, B.G. 1150, as translated hy Sir H. Raiclinson, Fox Talbot, Dr. Hincks and Dr. Oppert, and also in 1865 by Oppeet alone, Histoire des Empires de ChaldAeet d’Assyrfe, etc., pp. 44-59, transcribed, translated, and commented on by Lotz, Die Inschr. Tiglath-pileser's I., pp. 12-188, and finally transcribed and translated by WiNCKLEE, Inschr. Tiglath-Pileser’s I., in Schrader, Keil.

Lotz, Die Inschriften Tiglath-pileser's 1., pp. 16-19. The king, starting from Assur, must have followed the route through Sindjar, Nisib, Mardin, and
Diarbekir— a road used later by the Eomans, and still in existence at the present day. As he did not penetrate that year as far as the provinces of Alzi and Purukuzzi, he must have halted at the commencement of the mountain district, and have beaten the allies in the plain of Kuru-tchai, before Diarbekir, in the neighbourhood of the Tigris. * The country of the Kurkhi appears to have included at this period the provinces lying between the Sebbeneh-Su and the mountains of Djudi, probably a portion of the Sophene, the Anzanene and the Gordyene of classical authors (Schrader, ifeiZinscftr/ften und Geschichtsforschung, pp. 145-147, note, 188, 189); for the reading Kurti of this name, cf.

their way to reinforce the besieged, drove their soldiers into the Nami,
whose waters carried the corpses down to the Tigris. One of their princes,
Kiliteshnb, son of Kaliteshub-Sarupi,^ had. been made prisoner during the
action. Tiglath-pileser sent him, together with his wives, children, treasures,
and gods,^ to share the captivity of the Mushku ; then retracing his steps,
lie crossed over to the right bank of the Tigris, and attacked tlie stronghold
of Urrakhinas which crowned the summit of Panari. The people, terror
stricken by the fate of their neighbours, seized their idols and liid themselves
within the thickets like a flock of birds. Their chief, Shaditeshub, son of
Khatusaru,^ ventured from out of his hiding-place to meet the Assyrian
conqueror, and prostrated himself at his feet. He delivered over his sons
and the males of his family as hostages, and yielded up all his possessions
in gold and copper, together with a hundred and twenty slaves and cattle of
all kinds ; Tiglath-pileser thereupon permitted him to keep his principality
under the suzerainty of Assyria, and such of his allies as followed his example
obtained a similar concession. The king consecrated the tenth of the spoil
thus received to the use of his god Assur and also to Ramman ;
^ but before
returning to his capital, he suddenly resolved to make an expedition into
the almost impenetrable regions which separated him from Lake Van. This
district was, even more than at the present day, a confused labyrinth of wooded
mountain ranges, through which the Eastern Tigris and its affluents poured
their rapid waters in tortuous curves. As hitherto no army had succeeded
in making its way through this territory with sufficient speed to surprise
the fortified villages and scattered clans inhabiting the valleys and mountain
slopes, Tiglath-pileser selected from his force a small troop of light infantry
and thirty chariots, with which he struck into the forests ; but, on reaching
' The names of these princes have been read Kiliauterus, Kalianterus, and lower down Shadian
terus. Fr. Lenormant connected them with the Asiatic names ending in -andros,— Maiandros, Scamandros he identified in the same way the first element of the Lydian name Sadyattes with Shadianterus, and traced back Sndiandros {Les antiquit^s de la Troade, etc., i. pp. 65, 66, and Les Oriyines de VEistoire, vol. iii. p. 76 ; cf. Satce, The Monuments of the Hittites, in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vul. vii. p, 291). Briiunow has shown that we ought to recognise in the second element the name of the god Teshub, Tessupas, Tisubu, Teshupu (cf. supra, p. 355, note 1), and read Kiliteshnb, Kaliteshub, Shaditeshub (Jensen, Grundlagen fiir eine Entzifferung der Hatischen oder Cilicischen Inschriften, p. 165). “ Aiinals of Tiglath-pileser I., col. i. 11.

which could belong equally well to the Kummukh or to the Kurkhi, and the mention of the crossing of the Tigris seems to indicate that it was on the right bank of the river, probably in the mountain group of Tur-Abdin.



TEE CONQUEST OF THE EURKHI AND THE UPPER ZAB. 645
the Aruma, he was forced to abandon his chariotry and proceed with the
foot-soldiers only. The Mildish, terrified by his sudden appearance, fell an
easy prey to the invader : the king scattered the troops hastily collected to
oppose him, set fire to a few fortresses, seized the peasantry and their flocks,
and demanded hostages and the usual tribute as a condition of peace.^ In
his first campaign he thus reduced the upper and eastern half of Kummukh,
namely, the part extending to the north of the Tigris, while in the following
campaign he turned his attention to the regions bounded by the Euphrates
and by the western spurs of the Kashiari. The Alzi and the Purukuzzi had
been disconcerted by his victories, and had yielded him their allegiance almost
without a struggle.^ To the southward, the Kashku and the Urumi, who had,
to the number of four thousand, migrated from among the Khati and compelled
the towns of the Shubarti to break their alliance with the Niiievite kings,
now made no attempt at resistance ; they laid down their arms and yielded
at discretion, giving up their goods and their hundred and twenty war
chariots, and resigning themselves to the task of colonising a distant corner
of Assyria.^ Other provinces, however, were not so easily dealt with; the
inliabitants entrenched themselves within their wild valleys, from whence
they had to be ousted by sheer force ; in the end they always had to yield,
and to undertake to pay an annual tribute. The Assyrian empire thus re
gained on this side the countries which Shalmaneser I. had lost, owing to
the absorption of his energies and interests in the events which were taking
place in Chaldaea.^
In his third campaign Tiglath-pileser succeeded in bringing about the
pacification of the border provinces which shut in the basin of the Tigris to
the north and east. The Kurkhi did not consider themselves conquered
by the check they had received at the Nami; several of their tribes were
stirring in Kharia, on the highlands above the Arzania, and their rest
lessness threatened to infect such of their neighbours as had already
submitted themselves to the Assyrian yoke. “ My master Assur commanded
me to attack their proud summits, which no king has ever visited. I
assembled my chariots and my foot-soldiers, and I passed between the Idni
and the Aia, by a difficult country, across cloud-capped mountains whose
peaks were as the point of a dagger, and unfavourable to the progress of

The Mildish of our iuscription is to be identified with the country of Mount Umildish, mentioned by
Sargon of Assyria (Great Inscription, 1. 37). Hommel appears to me to place it too far north; if, as
he says (Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 523, note 2), the troops had touched at Arzauia and Lake Van, I think the king would not have omitted to mention the fact. 2 Annals, col. ii. 11. 89-96 ; cf. Lotz, Die Inschriften Tiglath-pileser' s I., pp. 24, 25.

my chariots ; I therefore left my chariots in reserve, and I climbed these
steep mountains. The community of the Kurkhi assembled its numerous
troops, and in order to give me battle they entrenched themselves upon
the Azubtagish ; on the slopes of the mountain, an incommodious position,
I came into conflict with them, and I vanquished them,” This lesson cost
them twenty-five towns, situated at the feet of the Aia, the Shuira, the Idni,
the Shizu, the Silgu, and the Arzanabiu ^—all twenty-five being burnt to the
ground. The dread of a similar fate impelled the neighbouring inhabitants
of Adaush to beg for a truce, which was granted to them ; ^ but the people
of Saraush and of Ammaush, who “from all time had never known what it
was to obey,” were cut to pieces, and their survivors incorporated into the
empire —a like fate overtaking the Isua and the Daria, who inhabited
Khoatras.^ Beyond this, again, on the banks of the Lesser Zab and the
confines of Lulume, the principalities of Muraddash and of Saradaush refused
to come to terms. Tiglath-pileser broke their lines within sight of Muraddash,
and entered the town with the fugitives in the confusion which ensued ; this
took place about the fourth hour of the day. The success was so prompt and

sixteen mountain ridges one after the other by paths hitherto considered
impracticable, and finally crossed the Euphrates by improvised bridges, this

with bas-reliefs, which exhibit a glaring imitation of Babylonian art; we
can still see on these the king, vested in his long flowing robes, praying
before an altar, while further on is a procession of dignitaries following a
troop of rams led by a priest to be sacrificed ; another scene represents two
individuals in the attitude of worship, wearing short loin-cloths, and climbing
a ladder whose upper end has an uncertain termination, while a third person

composition of the scenes is rude, the drawing incorrect, and the general

sculptors than of the high projection characteristic of the artists of the Lower

the now crumbling brick walls, the upper surface of which was covered with
rough plastering.^ Here and there a few inscriptions reveal the name, titles,

indeed, came from the coast-towns of the ^gean, thus showing that Western

Since these first attempts, many tentative efforts have been made to understand the texts written in this script : Halevy was opposed to the usual theory that they were Hittite, and proposed to call them Anatolian (Introduction au d^chiffrement des inscriptions pseudo-hittites ou anatoliennes, in the Revue sgmitique, vol. i. pp. 55-62, 126-137). Jensen, following Halevy’s theory, proposed to regard both the writing and the language as those of Ciliciau tribes (Grundlagen fur eine Entzifferung der Hatischen oder Cilicischen Inschriften, in tlie Z. der D. Morgenl. Ges., vol. xlviii.). The Cappadocian tablets studied by Fe. Delitzsch, Beitrdge zur Entzifferung und ErhVdrung der Eappadohischen Keilschrifttafeln (in the Abhandlungen of the Saxon Academy of Sciences, Philology and Hist. Section, vol. xiv., No. 4, pp. 207-276), probably belong to the period before or after Tiglath-pileser I. ; Jensen, however, believes that they should be attributed to the earliest times of Assyrian history, before the XX*’* century b.c.

so numerous as those of the Pharaohs and Ninevite hings, bear, nevertheless,
an equally striking evidence of its power. Examples of it have been pointed
out in a score of different places in the valleys of the Taurus and on the plains
of Cappadocia, in bas-reliefs, stelae, seals, and intaglios, several of which must
be nearly contemporaneous with the first Assyrian conquest. One instance of

it apjiears on the rocks at Ibriz, where a king stands in a devout attitude before
a jovial giant whose hands are full of grapes and wheat-ears, while in another
bas-relief near Erakhtin we have a double scene of sacrifice. The rock-carving
at Ibriz is, perhap.s, of all the relics of a forgotten world, that which impresses
the spectator most favourably. The concept of the scene is peculiarly naive ;
indeed, the two figures are clumsily brought together, though each of them,
when examined se[)arately, is remarkable for its style and execution. The
king has a dignified bearing in spite of his large head, round eyes, and
the unskilful way in which his arms are set on his body. The figure of the
god is not standing firmly on both feet, but the sculptor has managed to
invest him with an air of grandeur and an expression of vigour and ’bonhomie,
which reminds us of certain types of the Greek Hercules.
Tiglath-pileser was probably attracted to Asia Minor as much by considera
tions of mercantile interest as by the love of conquest or desire for spoil. It
would, indeed, have been an incomparable gain for him had he been able, if
not to seize the mines themselves, at least to come into such close proximity
to them that he would be able to monopolise their entire output, and at

the same time to lay hands on the great commercial highway to the trade
centres of the westd The eastern terminus of this route lay already within
his domains, namely, that
which led to Assur by way
of Amid, Nisibe, Singar,

sirous of acquiring that

tite empire, and a certain
sense of unity still lingered
among them in spite of their
continual feuds ; they constituted, in fact, a sort of loose confederation, whose
members never failed to help one another when they were threatened by
a common enemy.^ As soon as the news of an Assyrian invasion reached
them, they at once put aside their mutual quarrels and combined to oppose
the invader with their united forces. Tiglath-pileser had, therefore, scarcely
crossed the Euphrates before he was attacked on his right flank by twenty
three petty kings of Nairi,‘‘ while sixty other chiefs from the same neigh
bourhood bore down upon him in front. He overcame the first detachment
of the confederates, though not without a sharp struggle ; he carried carnage

into their ranks, “ as it were the whirlwind of Kamman,” and seized a hun
dred and twenty of the enemy’s chariotsd The sixty chiefs, whose domains
extended as far as the “ Upper Sea,” were disconcerted by the news of the
disaster, and of their own accord laid down their arms, or offered but a feeble
resistance. Tiglath-pileser presented some of them i n chains to the god Shamash
he extorted an oath of vassalage from them, forced them to give up tbeir children
as hostages, and laid a tax upon them en masse of 1200 stallions and 2000 bulls,
after which he permitted them to return to their respective towns. He had,
however, singled out from among them to grace his own triumph, Sini of
Dayana, the only chief among them who had offered him an obstinate resistance ;
but even lie was granted his liberty after he had been carried captive to Assur,
und made to kneel before the gods of Assyria.® Before returning to the capital,
Tiglath-pileser attacked Khanigalbat, and appeared before Milidia : as the
town attempted no defence, he spared it, and contented himself with levying
a small contribution upon its inhabitants.'* Tliis expedition was rather of the
nature of a reconnaissance than a conquest, but it helped to convince the king
of the difficulty of establishing any permanent suzerainty over the country.
The Asiatic jieoples were quick to bow before a sudden attack ; but no sooner
had the conqueror departed, than those who had sworn liim eternal fealty
sought only how best to break their oaths. The tribes in immediate proximity
to those provinces which had been long subject to tlie Assyrian rule, were
intimidated into showing some respect for a power which existed so close to
their own borders. But those further removed from the seat of government
felt a certain security in their distance from it, and were tempted to revert to the
state of independence they had enjoyed before the conquest ; so that unless
the sovereign, by a fresh campaign, promptly made them realise that their
disaffection would not remain unpunished, they soon forgot their feudatory
condition and the duties which it entailed.

Some believe it to be the Caspian Sea (Menant, Annales des rois d’Assyrie, p. 34) or the Black Sea (Ed.

TIGLATH-PILESER L AT CAECEEMISE AND IN MUSRI. 655
Three years of merciless conflict with obstinate and warlike mountain tribes
had severely tried the Assyrian army, if it had not worn out the sovereign ; the
survivors of so many battles were in sore need of a well-merited repose, the gaps
left by death bad to be filled, and both infantry and chariotry needed the re-model
ling of their corps. The fourth year of the king’s reign, therefore, was employed
almost entirely in this work of reorganisation ; we find only the record of a raid of
a few weeks against the Akhlami and other nomadic Aramaeans situated beyond
the Mesopotamian steppes. The Assyrians spread over the district between
the frontiers of Sukhi and the fords of Carchemish for a whole day, killing all
who resisted, sacking the villages and laying hands on slaves and cattle. The
fugitives escaped over the Euphrates, vainly hoping that they would be secure
in the very heart of the Khati. Tiglath-pileser, however, crossed the river
on rafts supported on skins, and gave the provinces of Mount Bishri over to
fire and sword : ^ six walled towns opened their gates to him without having
ventured to strike a blow, and he quitted the country laden with spoil before
the kings of the surrounding cities had had time to recover from their alarm.^
This expedition was for Tiglath-pileser merely an interlude between two more
serious campaigns ; and with the beginning of his fifth year he reappeared in
the provinces of the Upper Euphrates to complete his conquest of them. He
began by attacking and devastating Musri, which lay close to the territory of
Milid. \Yhile thus occupied he was harassed by bands of Kumani ; he turned
upon them, overcame them, and imprisoned the remainder of them in the
fortress of Arini, at the foot of Mount Aisa, where he forced them to kiss his
feet. His victory over them, however, did not disconcert their neighbours.
The bulk of the Kumani, whose troops had scarcely suffered in the engage
ment, fortified themselves on Mount Tala, to the number of twenty thousand ;
the king carried the heights by assault, and hotly pursued the fugitives as far
as the range of Kharusa before Musri, where the fortress of Khunusa afforded
them a retreat behind its triple walls of brick. The king, nothing daunted,
broke his way through them one after another, demolished the ramparts, razed
the houses, and strewed the ruins with salt ; he then constructed a chapel of

The name is preserved in that of Tell Basher still borne by the ruins, and a modern village on the banks of the Sajur (Fe. Delitzsch, TFo lag das Paradies? p. 268 ; Schrader, Keilinschriften und GescMchtsforschung, p. 226, note 1 ; Winckler, Gesch. Bah. und Ass., p. 332). The Gebel Bishri to wliich Hommel alludes (Gesch. Bab. und .4ss.,p. 463, note 4) is too far to the south to correspond to the description given in the inscription of Tiglath-pileser. - Annals of Tiglath-pileser I., col. v. 11. 44-63 ; cf. Lotz, Die Inschr.' Tiglath-pileser' s I., pp. 44, 45. Hommel (Gesch.

Peiser-Winckler, Die sogenannte synchronistische Gesch., in Schrader, Keilinschriftliche Bihliothek, vol. i. pp. 198, 199), and which refers to a second expedition undertaken in these regions probably in the year preceding the taking of Babylon (cf. pp. 656-658 of the present work).

brick as a sort of trophy, and dedicated within it what was known as a copper
thunderbolt, being an image of the missile which Kamman, the god of thunder,
brandished in the face of his enemies. An inscription engraved on the
object recorded the destruction of Khunusa, and threatened with every divine
malediction the individual, whether an Assyrian or a stranger, who should
dare to rebuild the city. This victory terrified the Kumani, and their capital,
Kibshuna, opened its gates to the royal troops at the first summons. Tiglath
pileser completely destroyed the town, but granted the inhabitants their lives
on condition of their paying tribute ; he chose from among them, howevei',
three hundred families who had shown him the most inveterate hostility, and
sent them as exiles into Assyria.^ With this victory the first half of his reign
drew to its close ; in five years Tiglath-pileser had subjugated forty-two
peoples and their princes within an area extending from the banks of the
Lower Zab to the plains of the Khati, and as far as the shores of the Western
Seas.^ He revisited more than once these western and northern regions in
which he had gained his early triumphs. The reconnaissance which he had
made around Carchemish had revealed to him the great wealth of the Syrian
table-land, and that a second raid in that direction could be made more
profitable than ten successful campaigns in Nairi or upon the banks of the Zab.
He therefore marched his battalions thither, this time to remain for more than
a few days. He made his way through the whole breadth of the country,
pushed forward up the valley of the Orontes, crossed the Lebanon, and emerged
above the coast of the Mediterranean in the vicinity of Arvad. This is the first
time for many centuries that an Oriental sovereign had penetrated so far west
and his contemporaries must have been obliged to look back to the almost
fabulous ages of Sargon of Agade or of Khammurahi,^ to find in the long lists
of the dynasties of the Euphrates any record of a sovereign who had planted
his standards on the shores of the Sea of the Setting Sun.-^ Tiglath-pileser

penetrated into this region by the Jihun, and consequently seeks to identify the names of towns and mountains, e.g. Dlount Ilamuni with Jaur-dagb, the Kharusa with Shorsh-dagh, and the Tala with the Kerraes-dagh {Encore un Mot, etc., pp. 45, 46); but it is difacult to believe that, if the king took this route, he would not mention the town of Marqasi-Marash, which lay at the very foot of the Jaur-dagh, and would have stoj)ped his passage. It is more probable that the Assyrians, starting from Melitene, which they had just subdued, would have followed the route which shirts the northern slope of the Taurus by Albistau ; the scene of the conflict in this case would probably have been the mountainous district of Zeiiuti.

embarked on its waters, made a cruise into tbe open, and killed a porpoise, but
we have no record of any battles fought, nor do we know how he was received
by the Phcenician townsd He pushed on, it is thought, as far as the Nahr el

to be cut there three centuries previously aroused his emulation.^ Assyrian
conquerors rarely quitted
the scene of their exploits
without leaving behind
them some permanent me
morial of their presence.
A sculptor having hastily
smoothed the surface of a
rock cut out on it a figure
of the king, to which was
usually added a commemo

of this stele was erected
an altar, upon which sacri
fices were made, and if the
monument was placed near a stream or the seashore, the soldiers were accus
tomed to cast portions of the victims into the water in order to propitiate the
river-deities. , One of the half-effaced Assyrian stelse adjoining those of the
Egyptian conqueror is attributed to Tiglath-pileser.^ It Avas on his return,
perhaps, from this campaign that he planted colonies at Pitru on the right, and
at Mutkinu on the left bank of the Euphrates, in order to maintain a watch over
Carchemish, and the more important fords connecting Mesopotamia with the

was not long in reaching the Delta, and the Egyptian monarch then reigning
at Tanis was thus made acquainted with the fact that there had arisen in Syria

by when Egypt was prompt to take up arms at the slightest encroachment on
her Asiatic provinces. Her influence at this time was owing merely to her
former renown, and her authority beyond the isthmus was purely traditional.^
The Tanite Pharaoh had come to accept with resignation the change in the
fortunes of Egypt, and he therefore contented himself with forwarding to the

rare wild beasts and a few crocodiles. In olden times Assyria had welcomed
tlie arrival of Thutmosis III. on the Euphrates by making him presents, which
the Theban monarch regarded in the light of tribute : the case was now
reversed, the Egyptian Pharaoh taking the position formerly occupied by the
Assyrian monarch. Tiglath-pileser graciously accepted this unexpected
homage, but the turbulent condition of the northern tribes prevented his
improving the occasion by an advance into Phoenicia and the land of Canaan.
Nairi occupied his attention on two separate occasions at least ; on the second
of these he encamped in the neighbourhood of the source of the river Subnat.
This stream had for a long period issued from a deep grotto, where in ancient
times a god was supposed to dwell. The conqueror was lavish in religious
offerings here, and caused a bas-relief to be engraved on the entrance in
remembrance of his victories. He is here represented as standing upright, the
tiara on liis brow, and his right arm extended as if in the act of worship, while

his left, the elbow brought up to his side, holds a club. The inscription
appended to the figure tells, with an eloquence all the more effective from its
brevity, how, “ with the aid of Assur, Shamash, and Kamraan, the great gods,
my lords, I, Tiglath-pileser, King of Assyria, son of Assurishishi, King of
Assyria, son of Mutakkilnusku, King of Assyria, conqueror from the great sea,
the Mediterranean, to the great sea of
Kairi, I went for the third time to Kairi.” ^
The gods who had so signally favoured
the monarch received the greater part of
the spoils which he had secured in his
campaigns. The majority of the temples
of Assyria, which were founded at a time
when its city was nothing more than a
provincial capital owing allegiance to
Babylon, were either, it would appear,
falling to ruins from age, or presented
a sorry exterior, utterly out of keeping
with the magnitude of its recent wealth.
The king set to work to enlarge or restore
the temples of Ishtar, Martu, and the
ancient Bel ;
^ he then proceeded to re
build, from the foundations to the summit,
that of Anu and Eamman, which the
vicegerent Samsiramman, son of Ismida
gan, had constructed seven hundred and
one years previously.^ This temple w'as the principal sanctuary of the city,
because it was the residence of the chief of the gods, Assur, under his
appellation of Anu.® The soil was cleared away down to the bed-rock, upon
which an enormous substructure, consisting of fifty courses of bricks, was laid,
and above this were erected two lofty ziggurMs, whose tile-covered surfaces
shone like the rising sun in their brightness ; the completion of the whole

was commemorated by a magnificent festival. The special chapel of Ramman
and his treasury, dating from the time of the same Samsiramman who
had raised the temple of Anu, were also rebuilt on a more important
scale.^ These works were actively carried on notwithstanding the fact that
war was raging on the frontier ; how'ever preoccupied he might be with

warlike projects, Tiglath-pileser never neglected the temples, and set to
work to collect from every side materials for their completion and adorn
ment. He brought, for example, from Nairi such marble and hard stone
as might be needed for sculptural purposes, together with the beams of cedar
and cypress required by his carpenters. The mountains of Singar and of
the Zab furnished the royal architects with building stone for ordinary
uses, and for those facing slabs of bluish gypsum on which the bas-reliefs
of the king’s exploits were carved; the blocks ready squared w'ere brought
down the affluents of the Tigris on rafts or in boats, and thus arrived at their
destination without land transport.
The kings of Assyria, like the Pharaohs, had always had a passion for
rare trees and strange animals ; ® as soon as they entered a country, they
inquired what natural curiosities it contained, and they would send back to

of the monarch were thus almost always of a double nature, comprising not
merely a conflict with men, but a continual pursuit of wild beasts. Tiglath-pileser,
“ in the service of Ninib, had killed four great specimens of the male urus in
the desert of Mitanni, near to the town of Araziki, opposite to the countries of
the Khati ; ^ he killed them with his powerful bow, his dagger of iron, his
pointed lance, and he brought back their skins and horns to his city of Assur.

and Andaria. His advance in this direction must have considerably provoked
the Chaldeans, and, indeed, it was not long before actual hostilities broke
out between the two nations. The first engage
ment took place in the valley of the Lower Zab,
in the province of Arzukhina, without any decisive
result, but in the following year fortune favoured
the Assyrians, for Dur-kurigalzu, both Sipparas,
Babylon, and Upi opened their gates to them, while
Akarsallu, the Akhlame, and the whole of Sukhi
as far as Eapiki tendered their submission to
Tiglath-pileserd Merodach-nadin-akhi, who was
at this time reigning in Chaldaea, was, like his
ancestor Nebuchadrezzar I., a brave and warlike
sovereign ; he appears at first to have given way
under the blow thus dealt him, and to have ac
knowledged the suzerainty of his rival, who there
upon assumed the title of Lord of the four Houses
of the World, and united under a single empire
the vallevs of the Tigris and Euphrates. But
this state of things lasted for a few years only ;
Merodach-nadin-akhi once more took courage,
and, supported by the Chaldcean nobility, suc
ceeded in expelling the intruders from Sumir and
Akkad. The Assyrians, however, did not allow themselves to be driven out
without a struggle, but fortune turned against them ; they were beaten, and
the conqueror infiicted on the Assyrian gods the humiliation to which they had
so often subjected those of other nations. He took the statues of Kamman and
Shala from Ekallati, carried them to Babylon, and triumphantly set them up
within the temple of Bel. There they remained in captivity for 418 years.^

(H. Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iii. pi. xiv., 11. 48-50 ; cf. Pognon, EInscription de Bavian, pp. 18, 19, 89, 90). I have followed the commonly received opinion (Hohmel, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., pp. 161-163, 531), which places the defeat of Tiglath-pileser after the taking of Babylon ; others think that it preceded the decisive victory of the Assyrians (Delitzscu-Muedtee, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., 2nd edit., pp. 155, 156 ; Winckxer, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 97). It is improbable that, if the loss of the statues preceded the decisive victory, the Assyrian conquerors should have left their gods prisoners in a Babylonian temple, and should not have brought them back immediately to Ekallati.



6G4 THE RISE OF TEE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
Tiglath-pileser did not long survive this disaster, for he died about the
year IlUO n.c.d and two of his sons succeeded him on the throne. The elder,
Assur-belkala,^ had neither sufficient energy nor resources to resume the
offensive, and remained a passive spectator of the revolutions which distracted
Babylon. Merodach-nadin-akhi had been followed by his son Merodach
shapik-zirim,^ but this prince was soon dethroned by the people, and Kamman
abaliddin, a man of base extraction, seized the crown. Assur-belkala not only
extended to this usurper the friendly relations he had kept up with the legiti
mate sovereign, but he asked for the hand of his daughter in marriage, and
the rich dowry which she brought her husband n6 doubt contributed to the
continuation of his pacific policy.^ He appears also to have kept possession of
all the parts of Mesopotamia and Kumraukh conquered by his father, and it
is possible that he may have penetrated beyond the Euphrates.^ His brother,
Samsi-ramman III., does not appear to have left any more definite mark upon
history than Assur-belkala;® he decorated the temples built by his pre
decessors,'^ but beyond this we have no certain record of his achievements.
We know nothing of the kings who followed him, their names even having
been lost, but about a century and a half after Tiglath-pileser,® a certain
' The death of Tiglath-pileser must have followed quickly on the victory of Babylon ; the contents of the inscription of Bavian permit us to fix the taking of Ekallati by the Chaldseans about the year 1108-1100 B.c. (Homjiel, Gesch. Rah. und ^ss., pp. 402, 531 ; Delitzsch-Mukdteb, 2nd edit., Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 158). We shall not be far wrong in supposing Tiglath-pileser to have reigned six or eight years after his defeat. ^ I follow the usually received classification (Tiele, Bab.-Ass. Gesch., pp. 156, 165 ; Hommel, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 535). It is, however, possible that we must reverse the order of the sovereigns (Sayce, Synch. Hist, of Ass. and Bab., in the Transaclions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. ii. p. 132, note 2 ; Delitzsch-Muhdtek, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., 2nd edit. p. 150; Winckler, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 180). ^ The name of the Babylonian king has been variously read Merodach-sbapik-zirat (Gr. Smith, Early Hist, of Babylonia, in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. i. p. 74), Merodach-shapikkullat (Sayce, Synch. Hist, of Ass. and Bab., in the Transactions of the Bibl. Arch. Soc., vol. ii. p. 133; Winckler, Gesch.

Arch. Soc., vol. vii. p. 338). “ T’he proof that he was the brother of Assur-belkala is furnished by the preamble of his votive inscriptions (Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. jik 3, Nos. 9, 11), where he calls himself son of Tiglath-pileser, grandson of Assurrishishi, and great-grandson of Mutakkilnusku. ’ He restored the palace and temple of Ishtar at Nineveh (Rawlinson, Cun. Ins. W. As., vol. iv. pi. 3, Nos. 9, 11 ; cf. G. Smith, Assyrian Discoveries, p. 252, and Hommel, Gesch. Bab. und Ass., p. 537). “ For this period, cf. Hommel, Gesch.

END OF TEE PASHE DYNASTY.
Assurirba seems to have crossed Northern Syria, and following in the footsteps
of his great ancestor, to have penetrated as far as the Mediterranean : on the
rocks of Mount Amanus, facing the sea, he left a triumphal inscription in which
he set forth the mighty deeds he had accomplished^ This is merely a gleam
out of the murky night which envelops his history, and the testimony of one
of his descendants informs us that his good fortune soon forsook him ; the
Aramaeans wrested from him the fortresses of Pitru and Mutkinu, which com
manded both banks of the Euphrates near Carchemish.^ Nor did the retrograde
movement slacken after his time : Assyria slowly wasted away down to the end
of the century, and but for the simultaneous decadence of the Chaldaeans,
its downfall would have been complete. But neither Ramman-abaliddin nor
his successor was able to take advantage of its weakness ; discord, and want
of energy soon brought about their own ruin. The dynasty of Pashe dis
appeared towards the middle of the century,® and a family belonging to
the “ Countries of the Sea ” took its place : it had continued for about one
hundred and thirty-two years, and had produced eleven kings.^

THE RISE OF THE ASSYRIAN EMPIRE.
(iBT)
What were the causes of this depression, from which Bahylou suffered at
almost regular intervals, as though stricken with some periodic malady ? The
main reason soon becomes apparent if we consider the nature of the country
and the material conditions of its existence. Chaldaea was neither extensive
enough nor sufficiently populous to afford a solid basis for the ambition of her
princes. Since nearly every man capable of bearing arms was enrolled in the
army, the Chaldsean kings had no difficulty in raising, at a moment’s notice,
a force which could be employed to repel an invasion, or make a sudden attack
on some distant territory ; it was in schemes which required prolonged and
sustained effort that they felt the drawbacks of their position. In that age
of hand-to-hand combats, the mortality in battle was very high, forced marches
through forests and across mountains entailed a heavy loss of men, and three
or four consecutive campaigns against a stubborn foe soon reduced an army
to a condition of dangerous weakness. Kecruits might be obtained to fill the
earlier vacancies in the ranks, but they soon grew fewer and fewer if time was not
given for recovery after the opening victories in the struggle, and the supply
eventually ceased if operations were carried on beyond a certain period.
A reign which began brilliantly often came to an impotent conclusion, owing
to the king having failed to economise his reserves ; and the generations which
followed, compelled to adopt a strictly defensive attitude, vegetated in a sort
of anaemic condition, until the birth-rate had brought the proportion of males
up to a figure sufficiently high to provide the material for a fresh army.
When Nebuchadrezzar made war upon Assurishishi, he was still weak from
the losses he had incurred during the campaign against Elam, and could not
conduct his attack with the same vigour as had gained him victory on the
banks of the Ulai ; in the first year he only secured a few indecisive ad
vantages, and in the second he succumbed. Merodach-nadin-akhi was suffering
from the reverses sustained by his predecessors when Tiglath-pileser provoked
him to war, and though he succeeded in giving a good account of an adversary
who was himself exhausted by dearly bought successes, he left to his descendants
a kingdom which had been drained of its last drop of blood. The same
reason which explains the decadence of Babylon shows us the cause of the
periodic eclipses undergone by Assyria after each outburst of her warlike
spirit. She, too, had to pay the penalty of an ambition which was out of all
proportion to her resources. The mighty deeds of Shalmaneser and Tukulti-ninip
were, as a natural consequence, followed by a state of complete prostration
under Tukultiassurbel and Assurnirari : the country was now forced to pay for
the glories of Assurishishi and of Tiglath-pileser by falling into an inglorious
state of languor and depression. Its kings, conscious that their rule must be

necessarily precarious as long as they did not possess a larger stock of recruits
to fall back on, set their wits to work to provide by various methods a more
adequate reserve. While on one band they installed native Assyrians in
the more suitable towns of conquered countries, on the other they imported
whole hordes of alien prisoners cbosen for their strength and courage, and
settled them down in districts by the banks of the Tigris and the Zab. We
do not know what Rammanirani and Shalmaneser may have done in this way,
but Tiglath-pileser undoubtedly introduced thousands of the Mushku, the
Urumaeans, the people of Kummukh and Nairi, and his example was followed
by all those of his successors whose history has come down to us. One might
have expected that such an invasion of foreigners, still smarting under the
sense of defeat, might have brought with it an element of discontent or
rebellion ; far from it, they accepted their exile as a judgment of the gods,
which the gods alone had a right to reverse, and did their best to mitigate the
hardness of their lot by rendering unhesitating obedience to their masters.
Their grandchildren, born in the midst of Assyrians, became Assyrians them
selves, and if they did not entirely divest themselves of every trace of their
origin, at any rate became so closely identified with the country of their
adoption, that it was difficult to distinguish them from the native race. The
Assyrians who were sent out to colonise recently acquired provinces were at
times exposed to serious risks. Now and then, instead of absorbing the natives
among whom they lived, they were absorbed by them, which meant a loss of
so much fighting strength to the mother country ; even under the most
favourable conditions a considerable time must have passed before they could
succeed in assimilating to themselves the races amongst whom they lived. At
last, however, a day would dawn when the process of incorporation was accom
plished, and Assyria, having increased her area and resources twofold, found
herself ready to endure to the end the strain of conquest. In the interval, she
suffered from a scarcity of fighting men, due to the losses incurred in her
victories, and must have congratulated herself that her traditional foe was not
in a position to take advantage of this fact.
The first wave of the Assyrian invasion had barely touched Syria ; it had
swept hurriedly over the regions in the north, and then flowed southwards to
return no more, so that the northern races were able to resume the wonted
tenor of their lives. For centuries after this their condition underwent no
change ; there was the same repetition of dissension and intrigue, the same
endless succession of alliances and battles without any signal advantage on
either side. The Hittites still held Northern Syria : Carchemish was their
capital, and more than one town in its vicinity preserved the tradition of their

dress, their language, their arts, and their culture in full vigour. The Greek
legends tell us vaguely of some sort of Cilician empire which is said to have
brought the eastern and central provinces of Asia Minor into subjection about
ten centuries before our era.^ Is there any serious foundation for such a belief,
and must we assume that there existed at this time and in this part of the
world a kingdom similar to that of Sapalulu ? Assyria was recruiting its
forces, Chaldaea was kept inactive by its helplessness, Egypt slumbered by the
banks of its river, there was no actor of the first rank to fill the stage ; now
was the opportunity for a second-rate performer to come on the scene and play
such a part as his abilities permitted. The Cilician conquest, if this be indeed
the date at which it took place, had the boards to itself for a hundred years
after the defeat of Assurirba. The time was too short to admit of its striking
deep root in the country. Its leaders and men were, moreover, closely related
to the Syrian Hittites ; the language they spoke was, if not precisely the Hittite,
at any rate a dialect of it ; their customs were similar, if, perhaps, somewhat
less refined, as is often the case with mountain races, when compared with the
peoples of the plain. We are tempted to conclude that some of the monuments
found south of the Taurus were their handiwork, or, at any rate, date from their
time. For instance, the ruined palace at Sinjirli, the lower portions of which
are ornamented with pictures similar to those at Pteria,^ representing pro
cessions of animals, some real, others fantastic, men armed with lances or bend
ing the bow, and processions of priests or officials. Then there is the great
lion at Marash, which stands erect, with menacing head, its snarling lips
exposing the teeth ; its body is seamed with the long lines of an inscription
in the Asiatic character, in imitation of those with which the bulls in the
Assyrian palaces are covered. These Cilicians gave an impulse to the civiliza
tion of the Khati which they sorely needed, for the Semitic races, whom
they had kept in subjection for centuries, now pressed them hard on all the
territory over which they had formerly reigned, and were striving to drive
them back into the hills. The Aramoeans in particular gave them a great
' Soliniis, relying on the indirect evidence of Hecatajus of Miletus, tells us that Cilicia extended not only to the countries afterwards known as Cataonia, Commagene, and Syria, but also included Lydia, Media, Armenia, Pamphylia, and Cappadocia ; the conquests of the Assyrian kings must have greatly reduced its area (Polyhistor, ed. Mommsen, p. 179, c. 38, § 1, et seq.). Mordtmann had already applied this hypothesis in the interpretation of tlie Asiatic monuments, and consequently regarded them as belonging to this Cilician empire (La Sceau de Tarlcoumdimmi, roi de Tarsous, in Guote, Munzstudien, iii. pp. 130, 131); his theory was taken up by Lehmann (Wochenschrift fiir classische PhiJologie, 1893, No. 22), and has been worked out by Jensen in his Grundlagen fiir eine entzijferung der llatischen oder Cilicischen Inschriften, pp. 17-19. I am of opinion that the tradition preserved by Ilecatseus referred both to the kingdom of Sapalulu and to that of the monarchs of this second epoch. In regard to this palace, which is probably later than the X*"* century, cf. Pereot-Chipiez, Histoire de I’Art dans V Antiquity, vol. iv. pp. 533, 534.

tribes from which, soon after, the Kaldi nation ^ was formed, were marauding
round Eridu, Uru, and Larsa, and may have already begun to lay the foundations
of their supremacy over Babylon : it is, indeed, an open question whether those
princes of the Countries of the Sea who succeeded the Pashe dynasty did not
come from the stock of the Kaldi Aramaeans.^ While they were thus consoli
dating on the south-east, the bulk of the nation continued to ascend north
wards, and rejoined its outposts in the central region of the Euphrates, which
extends from the Tigris to the Khabur, from the Khabur to the Balikh and
the Aprie. They had already come into frequent conflict with most of the
victorious Assyrian kings, from Raramanirari down to Tiglath-pileser ; the weak
ness of Assyria and Chaldaea gave them their opportunity, and they took full
advantage of it. They soon became masters of the whole of Mesopotamia ; a
part of the table-land extending from Carchemish to Mount Amanus fell into

their hands, their activity was still greater in the basin of the Oroutes, and
their advanced guard, coining into collision with the Amorites near the
sources of the Litany, began gradually to drive farther and farther southwards
all that remained of the races which had shown so bold a front to the
Egyptian troops. Here was an almost entirely new element, gradually
eliminating from the scene of the struggle other elements which had grown
old through centuries of war, and while this transformation was taking place in
Northern and Central, a similar revolution was effecting a no less surprising
metamorphosis in Southern Syria. There, too, newer races had gradually come
to displace the nations over which the dynasties of Thutmosis and Ramses
had once held sway. The Hebrews on the east, the Philistines and their allies
on the south-west, were about to undertake the conquest of the Kharu and its
cities. As yet their strength was inadequate, their temperament undecided,
their system of government imperfect ; but they brought with them the quality
of youth, and energies which, rightly guided, would assure the nation which
first found out how to take advantage of them, supremacy over all its rivals,
and the strength necessary for consolidating the whole country into a single
kingdom.

into several families^ Eacli of these families had its chief or “ ruler,” to
whom it rendered absolute obedience, while the united chiefs formed an
assembly of elders who administered justice when required, and settled any
differences which arose among their respective followers.^ The clans in their
turn were grouped into tribes,^ according to certain affinities which they
mutually recognised, or which may have been fostered by daily intercourse on
a common soil, but the ties which bound them together at this period were of
the most slender character. It needed some special event, such as a projected
migration in search of fresh pasturage, or an expedition against a turbulent
neighbour, or a threatened invasion by some stranger, to rouse the whole
tribe to corporate action ; at such times they would elect a “ nasi,” or ruler,
the duration of whose functions ceased with the emergency which had called
him into office.^ Both clans and tribes were designated by the name of some
ancestor from whom they claimed to be descended, and who appears in some
cases to have been a god for whom they had a special devotion ; some writers
have believed that this was also the origin of the names given to several of
the tribes, such as Gad, “ Good Fortune,” or of the totems of the hyena and
the dog, in Arabic and Hebrew, “ Simeon ” and “ Caleb.” ^ Gad, Simeon, and
Caleb were severally the ancestors of the families who ranged themselves under
their respective names, and the eponymous heroes of all the tribes were held
to have been brethren, sons of one father, and under the protection of one
God. He was known as the Jahveh with whom Abraham of old had made
a solemn covenant;® His dwelling-place was Mount Sinai or Mount Seir, and
He revealed Himself in the storm ; His voice was as the thunder “ which
shaketh the wilderness,” His breath was as “a consuming fire,” and He was
decked with light “ as with a garment.” When His anger was aroused. He
' The clan was called mishpdkhdh (Lev. xxv. 10 ; Numb. iii. 30, 35 ; Josh. xiii. 15) ; for its constitution, cf. Stade, Gesch. des Volhes Israel, vol. i. p. 396, et seq. “ The elders were called zeJcen, in the plural zehenim (Exod. iii. 18, xxiv. 14 ; Deut. xxxi. 28). “ The tribe was designated by two words signifying “ statf” or “branch;” the first is mattek {Numb. i. 49, x. 16, xxxiv. 13, et seq., xxxvi. 3), the second shabet (Exod. xxiv. 4, xxviii. 21 ; Numb. xxxvi. 3; Josh. iv. 5; Judges xviii. 1). * The word nasi, first applied to the chiefs of the tribes (Exod. xxxiv. 31 ; Lev. iv. 22 ; Numb. ii. 3), became, after the captivity, the title of the chiefs of Israel, who could not be called Icings owing to the foreign suzerainty (Esdras i. 8). * For this onomastic procedure, cf. Kobertson S.mitii, On Animal Worship and Animal Tribes amongst the Arabs and in the Old Test., in the Journal of Philology, vol. ix. p. 75, et seq. For its applicability to the clans and tribes of Israel, see Stade, Gesch. des Vollces Israel, vol. i. p. 403-409. For Gad, see supra, pp. 157, 158. Simeon is derived by some from a word which at times denotes a hyena, at others a cross between a dog and a hyena, according to Arab lexicography (Robertsox Smith, On Animal Worship, p. 80). With regard to Caleb, Renan prefers a different interpretation ; it is supposed to be a shortened form of Kalbel (cf. Kcdbelim in the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum, vol. i. pp. 70, 71, No. 49, and pp. 72, 73, No. 52), and “ Dog of El ” is a strong expression to denote the devotion of a tribe to its patron god. * For the covenant made by God with Abraham, sec supra, pp. 66, 67.

appeased, the heavens again poured their fruitful showers upon the fieldsd He
is described as being a “jealous (3-od,” brooking no rival, and “visiting the
iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth genera
tion.” We hear of His having been adored under the figure of a “calf,”^ and
of His Spirit inspiring His prophets, as well as of the anointed stones which
were dedicated in His honour.® The common ancestor of the nation was
acknowledged to have been Jacob, who, by his wrestling with God, had
obtained the name of Israel ; the people were divided theoretically into as
many tribes as he had sons, but the number twelve to which they were
limited does not entirely correspond with all that we know up to the present
time of these “ children of Israel.” ^ Some of the tribes appear never to have
had any political existence, as for example that of Levi,® or they vvere merged
at an early date into some fellow-tribe, as in the case of Reuben with Gad ;
®
others, such as Ephraim, Manasseh, Benjamin, and Judah, apparently did
not attain their normal development until a much later date. The Jewish
chroniclers attempted by various combinations to prove that the sacred
number of tribes was the correct one. xit times they included Levi in the
list, in which case Joseph was reckoned as one ; while on other occasions
Levi or Simeon was omitted, when for Joseph would be substituted his two
sons Ephraim and Manasseh.® In addition to this, the tribes were very
unequal in size : Ephraim, Gad, and Manasseh comprised many powerful and
wealthy families ; Dan, on the contrary, contained so few, that it was some
times reckoned as a mere clan.
The tribal organisation had not reached its full development at the
* See 1 Kings xvii., xviii., where the conflict between Elijah and the prophets of Baal for the obtaining of rain is described. ^ The most common of these animal forms was that of a calf or bull {Exod. xxxii. ; Deut. ix. 21 and in the kingly period, 1 Kings xh. 28-30 ; 2 Kings x. 29); we are not told the form of the image of Micah the Ephraimite {Judges xviii. 14, 17, 18, 20, 30, 31). [The ephods mentioned as objects of reverence in Judges viii. 27, and 1 Sam. xxi. 9, cannot come under this category, as the Hebrew word used implies that there was no figure connected with them. Ed.] “ For the stones which marked the sites of the appearances of Jahveh, cf. supra, pp. GO, 68, 69, 162-164. * For Jacob-Israel and his twelve sons, and for the division of their descendants into twelve tribes, cf. supra, 68-70. ^ Levi appears to have suffered dispersion after the events of which there are two separate accounts combined in Gen. xxxiv. In conjunction with Simeon, he appears to have revenged the violation of liis sister Dinah by a massacre of the Shechemites, and the dispersion alluded to in Jacob’s blessing {Gen. xlix. 5-7) is mentioned as consequent on this act of barbarism. For remarks on this subject, see Stade, Gesch. des Volkes Israel, vol. i. pp. 152-154. ® In the IX*'’ century Mesha ofMoabdoes not mention the Reubenites, and speaks of the Gadites only as inhabiting the territory formerly occupied by them. Tradition attributed the misfortunes of the tribe to the crime of its chief in his seduction of Bilhah, his father’s concubine {Gen. xlix. 3, 4 ; cf. xxxv. 22). ’ As, for instance, in Jacob’s blessing {Gen. xlix. 5-7) and in the enumeration of the patriarch’s sons at the time of his journey to Egypt {Gen. xlvi. 9-26). * Numb. i. 20, et seq., where the descendants of Levi are not included among the twelve, and Deut. xxxiii. 6-25, where Simeon is omitted from among the tribes blessed by Moses before his death.

time of the sojourn in the desert. The tribes of Joseph and Judah, who
subsequently played such important parts, were at that period not held in
any particular estimation ; Eeuben, on the other hand, exercised a sort of
right of priority over the rest.^ The territory which they occupied soon
became insufficient to support their numbers, and they sought to exchange
it for a wider area, such as was offered by the neighbouring provinces of
Southern Syria. Pharaoh at this time exercised no authority over this
region, and they were, therefore, no longer in fear of opposition from his
troops ; the latter had been recalled to Egypt, and it is doubtful even whether
he retained possession of the Shephelah by means of his Zakkala and
Philistine colonies ; the Hebrews, at any rate, had nothing to fear from him
so long as they respected Gaza and Ascalon. They began by attempting to
possess themselves of the provinces around Hebron, in the direction of the
Dead Sea, and we read that, before entering them, they sent out spies to
reconnoitre and report on the country.^ Its population had undergone
considerable modifications since the Israelites had quitted Goschen. The
Amorites, who had seriously suffered from the incursions of Asiatic hordes, and
had been constantly harassed by the attacks of the Aramaeans, had abandoned
the positions they had formerly occupied on the banks of the Orontes and
the Litany, and had moved southwards, driving the Canaanites before them
their advance was accelerated as the resistance opposed to their hordes became
lessened under the successors of Ramses III., until at length all opposition was
withdrawn. They had possessed themselves of the regions about the Lake
of Genesareth, the mountain district to the south of Tabor, the middle valley
of the Jordan, and, pressing towards the territory east of that river, had attacked
the cities scattered over the undulating table-land. This district had not
been often subjected to incui'sions of Egyptian troops, and yet its inhabitants
had been more impressed by Egyptian influence than many others. Whereas,
in the north and west, cuneiform writing was almost entirely used, attempts
had been made here to adapt the hieroglyphs to the native language. The
only one of their monuments which has been preserved is a rudely carved
bas-relief in black basalt, representing a two-horned Astarte, before whom
stands a king in adoration ; the sovereign is Ramses II., and the inscriptions
accompanying the figures contain a religious formula, together with a name
borrowed from one of the local dialects.^ The Amorites were everywhere
' This conclusion is drawn from the position of eldest son given to him in all the genealogies enumerating the children of Jacob.

victorious, but our information is confined to this bare fact ; soon after their
victory, however, we find- the territory they had invaded divided into two
kingdoms : in the north that of Bashan, which comprised, besides the
Hauran, the plain watered by the Yarmuk ; and to tlie south that of Heshbon,
containing the district lying
around the Arnon, and the
Jabbok to the east of the
Dead Sea.^ They seem to have
made the same rapid progress in
the country between the Jordan
and the Mediterranean as else
where. They had subdued
some of the small Canaanite
states, entered into friendly
relations with others, and pene
trated gradually as far south
as the borders of Sinai, while
we find them establishing petty
kings among the hill-country of
Shechem around Hebron, on the confines of the Negeb, and the Shephelah.^
When the Hebrew tribes ventured to push forward in a direct line northwards,
they came into collision with the advance posts of the x^morite population, and
suffered a severe defeat under the walls of Hormah J The check thus received,
however, did not discourage them. As a direct course was closed to them,
they turned to the right, and followed, first the southern and then the eastern
shores of the Bed Sea, till they reached the frontier of Gilead.® There again
they were confronted by the Amorite.s, but in lesser numbers, and not so
securely entrenched within their fortresses as their fellow-countrymen in the

The friendly welcome accorded to them in the regions situated to the east of the Dead Sea, has been accounted for either by an alliance made with Moab and Ammon against their common enemy, the Amorites (Wellhausen, Abiiss der Gesch. Israels und Judas, in the Skizzen und Vorarbeiten, vol. i. p. 7, and with more reserve by Eenan, Hist, du peuple d’Israel, vol. i. p. 211, et seq.), or by the fact that Ammon and Moab did not as yet occupy those regions ; the inhabitants in that case would have been Edomites and Midianites, who were in continual warfare with each other (Winokler, Gesch. Israels, vol. i. pp. 46-51, 203-205).

It was not merely due to indifference on their part; their resources were fully
taxed in defending themselves against the Aramseans and Bedawins, and from
the attacks of Moab and Ammon. Gad, continually threatened, struggled
for centuries without being discouraged, but Reuben lost heart,^ and soon
declined in power, till at length he became merely a name in the memory
of his brethren.
Two tribes having been thus provided for, the bulk of the Israelites
sought to cross the Jordan without further delay, and establish themselves
as best they might in the very heart of the Canaanites. The sacred writings
speak of their taking possession of the country by a methodic campaign,
undertaken by command of and under the visible protection of Jahveh.^
IMoses had led them from Egypt to Kadesh, and from Kadesh to the land
of Gilead; he had seen the promised land from the summit of Mount Nebo,
but he had not entered it, and after his death, Joshua, son of Nun, became
their leader, brought them across Jordan dryshod, not far from its mouth,
and laid siege to Jericho, The walls of the city fell of themselves at the
blowing of the brazen trumpets,^ and its capture entailed that of three

at once put a truce to their petty discords, and united in arms against the
strangers. At the instigation of Adoni-zedeck, King of Jerusalem, the
Canaanites collected their forces in the , south ; but they were routed not
far from Gibeon, and their chiefs killed or mutilated.^ The Amorites in the
north, who had assembled round Jabin, King of Hazor, met with no better
success ; they were defeated at the waters of Merom, Hazor was burnt, and
Galilee delivered up to fire and sword.^ The country having been thus to
a certain extent cleared, Joshua set about dividing the spoil, and assigned
to each tribe his allotted portion of territory.® Such, in its main outlines,

is the account given by the Hebrew chroniclers ; but, if closely examined, it
would appear that the Israelites did not act throughout with that unity of
purpose and energy which we might at first sight have attributed to them.
They did not gain possession of the land all at once, but established them
selves in it gradually by detachments, some settling at the fords of Jericho,^
others more to the north, and in the central valley of the Jordan as far up as
Shechem.^ The latter at once came into contact with a population having
a higher civilization than themselves, and well equipped for a vigorous
resistance ; the walled towns which had defied the veterans of the Pharaohs
had not much to fear from the
bands of undisciplined Israelites
wandering in their neighbour
hood. Properly speaking, there
were no pitched battles between
them, but rather a succession
of raids or skirmishes, in which
several citadels would succes
sively fall into the hands of
the invaders. Many of these
strongholds, harassed by re
peated attacks, would prefer to
come to terms with the enemy,
and would cede or sell them some portion of their territory ; others would
open their gates freely to the strangers, and their inhabitants would ally
themselves by intermarriage with the Hebrews. Judah and the remain
ing descendants of Simeon and Levi established themselves in the south ;
Levi comprised but a small number of families, and made no important
settlements; whereas Judah took possession of nearly the whole of the
mountain district separating the Shephelah from the western shores of
the Dead Sea, while Simeon made its abode close by on the borders
of the desert around the wells of Beersheba.^ The descendants of Rachel
and her handmaid received as their inheritance the regions situated more
to the centre of the country, the house of Joseph taking the best domains

lor its branches of Ephraim and Manasseh. Ephraim received some of the
old Canaanite sanctuaries, such as Eamah, Bethel, and Shiloh, and it was
at the latter spot that they deposited the ark of the covenant, Manasseh
settled to the north of Ephraim, in the hills and valleys of the Carmel group,
and to Benjamin were assigned the heights which overlook the plain of
.Terichod Four of tlie less important tribes, Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and
Zebulon, ventured as far north as the borders of Tyre and Sidon, behind the
Phoenician littoral, but were prevented by the Canaanites and Amorites from
spreading over the plain, and had to confine themselves to the mountains.
All the fortresses commanding the passes of Tabor and Carmel, Megiddo,
Taanach, Ibleam, Jezreel,^ Endor, and Bethshan remained inviolate, and
formed as it were an impassable barrier-line between the Hebrews of Galilee
and their brethren of Ephraim. The Danites were long before they found a
resting-place ; they attempted to insert themselves to the north of Judah,
between Ajalon and Joppa, but were so harassed by the Amorites, that they
had to content themselves with the precarious tenure of a few towns such as
Zora, Shaalbin, and Eshdol,^ The foreign peoples of the Shephelah and the
Canaanite cities almost all presei'ved their autonomy ; the Israelites had no
chance against them wherever they had sufficient space to put into the field
large bodies of infantry or to use their iron-bound chariots. Finding it
therefore impossible to overcome them, the tribes were forced to remain
cut off from each other in three isolated groups of unequal extent which
they were powerless to connect: in the centre were Joseph, Benjamin, and
Dan ; in the south, Judah, Levi, and Simeon ; while Issachar, Asher, Naphtali,
and Zebulon lay to the north.
The period following the occupation of Canaan constituted the heroic age
of the Hebrews. The sacred writings agree in showing that the ties which
bound the twelve tribes together were speedily dissolved, while their fidelity
and obedience to God were relaxed with the growth of the young generations
to whom Moses or Joshua were merely names. The conquerors “ dwelt among
the Canaanites ; the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the

Jezreel is not explicitly mentioned as being one of the cities which remained independent ; it is, however, probable that for a long time it formed one of the group of autonomic fortresses (Bddde, Die Bucher Richter und Samuelis, pp. 45-47). ’ For Dan and its subsequent history, cf.

Hivite, and the Jebusite: and they took their daughters to be their wives,
and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their gods. And the
children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of the Lord their Grod,
and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.” ^ When they had once abandoned
their ancient faith, poli
tical nnity was not long
preserved. War broke
out between one tribe
and another; the stronger
allowed the weaker to
be oppressed by the
heathen, and were them
selves often powerless to
retain their indepen
dence. In spite of the
thousands of men among
them, all able to bear
arms, they fell an easy
prey to the first comer;
the Amorites, the Am
monites, the Moabites,
and the Philistines, all
oppressed them in turn,
and repaid with usury
the ills which Joshua
had inflicted on the
Canaanites. “ Whither
soever they went out, the hand of the Lord was against them for evil, as the
Lord had spoken, and as the Lord had sworn unto them : and they were sore
distressed. And the Lord raised up judges, which saved them out of the hand
of those that spoiled them. And yet they hearkened not unto their judges, for
they went a-whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves down unto them :
they turned aside quickly out of the way wherein their fathers walked obeying
the commandments of the Lord ; hut they did not so. And when the Lord
raised them up judges, then the Lord was with the judge, and saved them
out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge : for it repented
the Lord because of their groaning by reason of them that oppressed them
and vexed them. But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they

turned back, ami dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other
gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them ; they ceased not from their
doings, nor from their stubborn way.” ^ The history of this period lacks the
unity and precision with w'hich we are at first tempted to credit it. The
Israelites, when transplanted into the promised land, did not immediately
lose the nomadic habits they had acquired in the desert. They retained the
customs and prejudices they had inherited from their fathers, and for many
years treated the peasantry, whose fields they had devastated, with the same
disdain that the Bedawin of our own day, living in the saddle, lance in hand,
shows towards the fellahin who till the soil and bend patiently over the
plough. The clans, as of old, were impatient of all regular authority ; each
tribe tended towards an isolated autonomy, a state of affairs which merited
reprisals from the natives and encouraged hatred of the intruders, and it was
only when the Canaanite oppression became unendurable that those who
suffered most from it united themselves to make a common effort, and rallied
for a moment round the chief who was ready to lead them. Many of these
liberators must have acquired an ephemeral popularity, and then have sunk
into oblivion together with the two or three generations who had known them
those whose memory remained green among their kinsmen were known by
posterity as the judges of Israel.^ These judges were not magistrates invested
with official powers and approved by the whole nation, or rulers of a highly
organised republic, chosen directly by God or by those inspired by Him.
They were merely local chiefs, heroes to their own immediate tribe, well
known in their particular surroundings, but often despised by those only
at a short distance from them. Some of them have left only a name behind
them, such as Shamgar, Ibzan, Tola, Elon, and Abdon ; indeed, some scholars
have thrown doubts on the personality of a few of them, as, for instance, Jair,
whom they affirm to have personified a Gileadite clan, and Othniel, who is
said to represent one of the Kenite families associated with the children of
Israel.'^ Others, again, have come down to us through an atmosphere ot
popular tradition, the elements of which modern criticism has tried in vain
to analyse. Of such unsettled and turbulent times we cannot expect an
* Judges ii. 15-19. ^ Tile word “judges,” which has been adopted to designate these rulers, is somewhat misleading, as it suggests the idea of an organized civil magistracy. The word “ shophet,” the same that we meet with in classical times under the form svffetes, had indeed that sense, but its primary meaning denotes a man invested with an absolute authority, regular or otherwise ; it would be better translated chief, prince, captain. ^ For a general treatment of these lesser judges, cf. Noldeke, Vlitersuchungen zur Kritili des Alten Testaments, p. 181, et seq. The name Tola occurs as that of one of the clans of Issachar
{Gen. xlvi. 13; Numh. xxvi. 23); Elon was one of the clans of Zebulon {Gen. xlvi. 11; Numb. xxvi. 20).



THE MOABITES AND BENJAMIN—EHUD. 685
uninterrupted history : some salient episodes alone remain, spread over a
period of nearly two centuries, and from these we can gather some idea of the
progress made by the Israelites, and observe their stages of transition from
a cluster of semi-barbarous hordes to a
settled nation ripe for monarchy.
The first of these episodes deals
merely with a part, and that the least
important, of the tribes settled in Central
Canaan.^ The destruction of the Amorite
kingdoms of Heshbon and Bashan had
been as profitable to the kinsmen of the
Israelites, Ammon and Moab, as it had
been to the Israelites themselves. The
Moabites had followed in the wake of
the Hebrews through all the surround
ing regions of the Dead Sea ; they had
pushed on from the banks of the Am on
to those of the Jabbok, and at the time
of the Judges were no longer content
with harassing merely Eeuben and Gad.
They were a fine race of warlike, well
armed Bedawins. Jericho had fallen
into their hands, and their King Eglon
had successfully scoured the entire hill
country of Ephraim,^ so that those who
wished to escape being pillaged had to safeguard themselves by the payment
of an annual tribute. Ehud the Left-handed concealed under his garments
a keen dagger, and joined himself to the Benjamite deputies who were
to carry their dues to the Moabite sovereign. The money having been paid,
the deputies turned homewards, but when they reached the cromlech of
* Renan, Hist, du peuple d’Israel, vol. i. p. 302, however, believes that the judges “ formed an almost continuous line, and that there merely lacks a descent from father to son to make of them an
actual dynasty. The chronology of the Booh of Judges appears to cover more than four centuries, from Othniel to Samson, but this computation cannot be relied on, as “ forty years ” represents an
indefinite space of time. We must probably limit this early period of Hebrew history to about a century and a half, from cir. 1200 to 10.50 b.c. ^ The episode of Othniel and Cushan-rishathaim, placed at the beginning of the history of this
period (^Judges iii. 8-11), is by many critics rejected as spurious. ^ The text seems to infer {Judges iii. 13-15) that, after having taken the City of Palm Trees, i.e. Jericho {Deut. xxxiv. 3; 2 Gliron. xxviii. 15), Eglon had made it'his residence, which makes the story incomprehensible from a geographical point of view. ButalldiflSculties would disappear if we agreed to admit that in ver. 15 the name of the capital of Eglon has dropped out (Budde, Die Bucher Richter und Samuelis, p. 99). * Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the original brought back by F. de Saulcy, and placed in the Louvre ; cf.

Gilgal,^ and were safe beyond the reach of the enemy, Ehud retraced his steps,
and presenting himself before the palace of Eglon in the attitude of a prophet,
announced that he had a secret errand to the king, who thereupon commanded
silence, and ordered his servants to leave him with the divine messenger in bis
summer parlour. “ And Ehud said, I have a message from God unto thee.
And he arose out of his seat. And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the
sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly : and the haft also went
in after the blade ; and the fat closed upon the blade, for he drew not the sword
out of his belly ; and it came out behind.” Then Ehud locked the doors and
escaped. ‘‘ Now when he was gone out, his servants came ; and they saw, and,
behold, the doors of the parlour were locked ; and they said, Surely he covereth
his feet in his summer chamber.” But by the time they had forced an
entrance, Ehud had reached Gilgal and was in safety. He at once assembled
the clans of Benjamin, occupied the fords of the Jordan, massacred the bands
of Moabites scattered over the plain of Jericho, and blocked the routes by
which the invaders attempted to reach the hill-country of Ephraim. Almost
at the same time the tribes in Galilee had a narrow escape from a still more
formidable enemy J'hey had for some time been under the Amorite yoke,
and the sacred writings represent them at this juncture as oppressed either by
Sisera of Harosheth-ha-Goyim or by a second Jabin, who was able to bring nine
hundred chariots of iron into the field.'^ At length the prophetess Deborah
of Issachar sent to Barak of Kadesh a command to assemble his people,
together with those of Zebulon, in the name of the Lord ; ^ she herself led the
contingents of Issachar, Ephraim, and Miichir to meet him at the foot of Tabor,
where the united host is stated to have comprised forty thousand men. Sisera,^
' Cf. supra, p. 103. The cromlech at Gilgal was composed of twelve stones, which, we are told, were erected by Joshua as a remembrance of the crossing of the Jordan (Josh. iv. 19-24). ^ The text tells us that, after the time of Ehud, the land had rest eiglity years (Judges iii. 30). This, again, is one of those numbers which represent an indefinite space of time. ^ It has been maintained that two versions are here blended together in the text, one in which the principal part is played by Sisera, the other in which it is attributed to Jabin (Coenill, Einleitung in das Alte Testament, 2ud edit., p. 94, et seq.). For the identity of Jabin II. with the Jabin of Joshua, cf. supra, p. OSO. The episode of Deborah and Barak (Judges iv., v.) comprises a narrative in prose (chap, iv.), and the song (chap, v.) attributed to Deborah (Budde, Die Bucher Richter und Samuelis, p. 101, et seq.). Maurice Vernes is the only writer who has contested the authenticity of this song (Les Dehuts de la nation juive, in the Revue de VHist des Religions, vol. vii. pp. 332338) : the prose account probably is derived from tbe song. According to Wellhausen-Bleek, Einleitung ins Alte Testament, 4th edit., p. 487, et seq., the differences in the two accounts arise partly from an imperfect understanding of the poetic text, and partly from one having come down from some other source (Bddde, Die Bucher Richter und Samuelis, pp. C8-71, 105-107 ; cf. Wildeboerliiscu. Die Litteratur des Alien Testaments nach der Zeitfolge Hirer Entstehung, pp. 30, 31). * Some critics suppose that the prose narrative (Judges iv. 5) has confounded the prophetess Deborah, wife of Lapidoth, with Deborah, nurse of Rachel, who was buried near Bethel, under the ' Oak of AVeeping ” (Ge?n xxxv. 8), and consequently place it between Rama and Bethel, in the hill-country of Ephraim. “ In the prose narrative (Judges iv. 2-7) Sisera is stated to have been the general of Jabin

who commanded the Canaanite force, attacked the Israelite army between
Taanach and Megiddo in that plain of Kishon which had often served as a
battle-field during the Egyptian campaigns.^ It would appear that heavy
rains had swelled the streams, and thus prevented the chariots from rendering
their expected service in the engagement ; at all events, the Amorites were
routed, and Sisera escaped with the survivors towards Hazor. The people of
Meroz facilitated his retreat, but a Kenite named Jael, the wife of Heber,
traitorously killed him with a blow from a hammer while he was in the act of
drinking.^ This exploit was commemorated in a song, the composition of which
is attributed to Deborah and Barak : “ For that the leaders took the lead in
Israel, for that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye the Lord.
Hear, 0 ye kings, give ear, 0 ye princes ; I, even I, will sing unto the Lord ; I
will sing praise to the Lord, the God of Israel.” ^ The poet then dwells on the
there is nothing incompatible in this statement with the royal dignity elsewhere attributed to Sisera. Harosheth-ha-Goyim has been identified with the present village of El-Haretiyeh, on the right bank of the Kishon. * Drawn by Boudier, from a photograph in Lortet’s La Syrie d’aujourd’hui, p. 456. ' Cf., for the site of Megiddo and the victory gained there by Thutmosis III., pp. 134-136, 256-259 of the present work. ^ Meroz is the present Marus, between the Lake of Huleh and Safed. I have followed the account given in the song (Judges v. 24-27). According to the prose version (iv. 17-22), Jael slew Sisera while he was asleep with a tent-pin, which she drove into his temple. [The text of Judges v. 24-27 does not seem to warrant the view that he was slain “ in the act of drinking,” nor does it seem

enumerates the tribes who took part in the conflict as well as those who
turned a deaf ear to the appeal. "Then came down a remnant of the nobles

soul, march on with strength.—Then did the horsehoofs stamp—by reason of
the pransings, the pransings of their strong ones.” Sisera flies, and the poet
follows him in fancy, as if he feared to see him escape from vengeance. He
curses the people of Meroz in passing “ because they came not to the help of
the Lord.” He addresses Jael and blesses her, describing the manner in which
tlie chief fell at her feet, and then proceeds to show how, at the very time of
Sisera’s death, his people were awaiting the messenger who should bring the
news of his victory; “through the window she looked forth and cried—the
mother of Sisera cried through the lattice—‘Why is his chariot so long in
coming ?—Why tarry the wheels of his chariot ? ’—Her wise ladies answered
her,—yea, she returned answer to herself,—‘ Have they not found, have
they not divided the spoil?—A damsel, two damsels to every man; to

on both sides, on the necks of the spoil?— So let all Thine enemies perish,

restricted in its development by the neighbouring Canaanite tribes, was forced
to seek a more congenial neighbourhood to the east of the Jordan—not close
to Gad, in the land of Gilead, but to the north of the Yarmuk and its northern
affluents in the vast i-egion extending to the mountains of the Hauran. The
families of Machir and Jair migrated one after the other to the east of the
Lake of Gennesaret, while that of Nobah proceeded as far as the brook of
Kanah, and thus formed in this direction the extreme outpost of the children
of Israel : these families did not form themselves into new tribes, for they
were mindful of their affiliation to Manasseh, and continued beyond the river
to regard themselves still as his children.^ The prosperity of Ephraim and

Manasseh, and the daring nature of their exploits, could not fail to draw
upon them the antagonism and jealousy of the people on their borders. The
jMidianites were accustomed almost every year to pass through the region beyond
the Jordan which the house of Joseph had recently colonised. Assembling in
the springtime at the junction of the Yarmuk with the Jordan, they crossed the
latter river, and, spreading over the plains of Mount Tabor, destroyed the grow
ing crops, raided the villages, and pushed, sometimes, their skirmishing parties
over hill and dale as far as Gaza.^ A perpetual terror reigned wherever they
were accustomed to pass : no one dared beat out wheat or barley in the open
air, or lead his herds to pasture far from his home, except under dire necessity
and even on such occasions the inhabitants would, on the slightest alarm,
abandon their possessions to take refuge in caves or in strongholds on the
mountaius.'^ During one of these incursions two of their sheikhs encountered
some men of noble mien in the vicinity of Tabor, and massacred them without
compunction.^ The latter were people of Ophrah,^ brethren of a certain J erubbaal
(Gideon) who was head of the powerful family of Abiezer.'^ Assembling all his
people at the call of the trumpet, Jerubbaal chose from among them three
hundred of the strongest, with whom he came down unexpectedly upon the
raiders, put them to flight in the plain of Jezreel, and followed them beyond
the Jordan. Having crossed the river, “ faint and yet pursuing,” he approached
the men of Succoth, and asked them for bread for himself and his three

It is not certain that all the families which constituted the half-tribe of Manasseh took their origin from Manasseh : one of tlieni, for example, that of Jair, was regarded as having originated parti}' from Judah (1 Chron. ii. 21-24). ' Judges vi. 2-6. The inference that they dare not beat wheat in the open follows from ver. 11, where it is said that “Gideon was l)eating out wheat in his winepress to hide it from the Midianites.” * The history of the Midianite oppression (Judges vi.-viii.) seems to be from two different sources; tlie second (Judges viii. 4-21) is considered by some to represent the more ancient tradition. The double name of the hero, Gideon-Jerubbaal, has led some to assign its elements respectively to Gideon, judge of the western portion of Manasseh, and Jerubbaal, judge of the eastern Manasseh (cf. Niebuhd, Studien und Bemerliungen zur GescJiichte des Alien Orients, pp. 1-29), and to the consequent fusion of the two men in one. ^ This is an assumption which follows reasonably from Judges viii. 18, 19. * The site of the Ophrah of Abiezer is not known for certain, but it would seem from the narrative that it was in the neiglibourhood of Shechem. ‘‘ The position of Gideon-Jerubbaal as head of the house of Abiezer follows clearly from the narrative ; if he is rejiresented in the first part of the account as a man of humlde origin (Judges vi. 15, 16), it was to exalt the power of Jahveh, who was accustomed to choose His instruments from amongst the lowly. The name Jerubbaal (1 Sam. xii. 11 ; 2 Sam. xi. 21, where the name is transformed into Jerubbesheth, as Ishbaal and Meribbaal are into Ishbosheth and Mephibosheth respectively), in which “ Baal ” seems to some not to represent the Canaanite God, but the title Lord as applied to .Tahveh, was supposed to mean “ Baal fights against him,” and was, therefore, offensive to the orthodox. Kuenen, De Godsdienst van Israel, vol. i. p. 408, thought it meant “ Lord, fight for him ! ” Renan read it Yarebaal, from the Vulgate form Jerobaal, and translated “ He who fears Baal ” (Hist, du peuple d’Israel, vol. i. p. 319). Gideon signifies “He who overthrows” in the battle.



JERUBBAAL AND THE OFFER OF SOVEREIGNTY. 691
hundred followers. Their fear of the marauders, however, was so great that the
people refused to give him any help, and he had no better success with the
people of Penuel whom he encountered a little further on. He did not stop
to compel them to accede to his wishes, but swore to inflict an exemplary
punishment upon them on his return. The Midianites continued their retreat,
in the mean time, “by the way of them that dwelt iu tents on the east of Nobah
and Jogbehah,” but Jerubbaal came up with them near Karkar, and discomfited
tlie host. He took vengeance upon the two peoples who had refused to give
him bread, and having thus fulfilled his vow, he began to question his prisoners,
the two chiefs : “ What manner of men were they whom ye slew at Tabor ? ”
“ As thou art, so were they ; each one resembled the children of a king.”
“And he said, They were my brethren, the sons of my mother: as the Lord
liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I would not slay you. And he said unto
Jether his firstborn. Up, and slay them. But the youth drew not his sword
for he feared, because he was yet a youth.” True Bedawins as they were, the
chiefs’ pride revolted at the idea of their being handed over for execution to
a child, and they cried to Jerubbaal : “ Rise thou, and fall upon us : for as the
man is, so is his strength.” From this victory rose the first monarchy among
the Israelites. The Hidianites, owing to their marauding habits and the amount
of tribute which they were accustomed to secure for escorting caravans, were
possessed of a considerable quantity of gold, wliich they lavished on the decora
tion of their persons : their chiefs were clad in purple mantles, their warriors
were loaded with necklaces, bracelets, rings, and ear-rings, and their camels also
were not behind their masters in the brilliance of their caparison. The booty
which Gideon secured was, therefore, considerable, and, as we learn from the
narrative, excited the envy of the Ephraimites, who said : “ Why hast thou
served us thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight with
Hidian ? ” ^ The spoil from the golden ear-rings alone amounted to one thou
sand seven hundred shekels, as we learn from the narrative, and this treasure
in the hands of Jerubbaal was not left unemployed, but was made, doubtless,
to contribute something to the prestige he had already acquired : the men of
Israel, wliom he had just saved from their foes, expressed their gratitude by
offerino' the crown to him and his successors. The mode of life of the Hebrews
o
had been much changed after they had taken up their abode in the mountains
of Canaan. The tent had given place to the house, and, like their Canaanite
neighbours, they had given themselves up to agricultural pursuits. This
change of habits, in bringing about a greater abundance of the necessaries of
life than they had been accustomed to, had begotten aspirations which threw

into relief the inadequacy of the social organisation, and of the form of
government with which they had previously been content. In the case of
a horde of nomads, defeat or exile would be of little moment. Should they
be obliged by a turn in their affairs to leave their usual haunts, a few days
or often a few hours would .suffice to enable them to collect their effects
together, and set out without trouble, and almost without regret, in search
of a new and more favoured home. But with a cultivator of the ground the
case would be different : the farm, clearings, and homestead upon which he
had spent such arduous and continued labour ; the olive trees and vines
which had supplied him with oil and wine —everything, in fact, upon which
he depended for a livelihood, or which was dependent upon him, would bind
him to the soil, and expose his property to disasters likely to be as keenly
felt as wounds inflicted on his person. He would feel the need, therefore, of
laws to secure to him in time of peace the quiet possession of his wealth,
of an army to protect it in time of war, and of a ruler to cause, on the one hand,
the laws to be respected, and to become the leader, on the other, of the military
forces. Jerubbaal is said to have, in the first instance, refused the crown,
but everything goes to prove that he afterwards virtually accepted it. He
became, it is true, only a petty king, whose sovereignty was limited to
]\fanasseh, a part of Ephraim, and a few towns, such as Succoth and Penuel,
beyond the Jordan. The Canaanite city of Shechem also paid him homage.
Like all great chiefs, he had also numerous wives, and he recognised as the
national Heity the God to whom he owed his victories.^ Out of the spoil
taken from the Midianites he formed and set up at Ophrah an ephod, which
became, as we learn, “a snare unto him and unto his house,” but he had
also erected under a terebintli tree a stone altar to Jahveh-Shalom (“Jehovah
is peace This sanctuary, with its altar and ephod, soon acquired great
celebrity, and centuries alter its foundation it w'as the object of many
pilgrimages from a distance.
Jerubbaal Avas the father by his Israelite wdves of seventy children, and, by
a Canaanite woman whom he had taken as a concubine at Shechem, of one son,
called Abimelech.^ The succession to the throne would naturally have fallen
to one of the seventy, but before this could be arranged, Abimelech “ went to
Shechem unto his mother’s brethren, and spake with them, and with all the

The sanctuary of Ophrah was possibly in existence before the time of Jerubbaal, and the sanctity of tlie place may have determined his selection of the spot for placing the altar and ephod there. ^ Judges viii. 30, 31.

family of the house of his mother’s father, saying, Speak, I pray you, iu the
ears of all the men of Shechem, Whether is better for you, that all the sons
of Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, rule over you, or that one
rule over you ? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. ’ This
advice was well received ; it flattered the vanity of the people to think that
the new king was to be one of themselves ; “ their hearts inclined to follow
Abimelech; for they said. He is our brother. And they gave him three
score and ten pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith (the Lord of the
Covenant), 1 wherewith Abimelech hired vain and light fellows, which followed
him. ... He slew his brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and
ten persons, upon one stone.” The massacre having been effected, “ all the men
of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo,'-^ and
made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar which was in Shechem.” ^ He
dwelt at Ophrah, in the residence, and near the sanctuary, of his father, and
from thence governed the territories constituting the little kingdom of
Manasseh, levying tribute upon the vassal villages, and exacting probably
tolls from caravans passing through his domain. This condition of things
lasted for three years, and then the Shechemites, who had shown themselves
so pleased at the idea of having “ one of their brethren ” as sovereign, found it
irksome to pay the taxes levied upon them by him, as if they were in no way
related to him. The presence among them of a certain Zebul, the ofiicer and
representative of Abimelech, restrained them at first from breaking out into
rebellion, but they returned soon to their ancient predatory ways, and demanded
ransom for the travellers they might capture even when the latter were in
possession of the king’s safe conduct. This was not only an insult to their lord,
but a serious blow to his treasury : the merchants who found themselves no
longer protected by his guarantee employed elsewhere the sums which would
have come into his hands. The king concealed his anger, however; he was
not inclined to adopt premature measures, for the place was a strong one,
and defeat would seriously weaken his prestige. The people of Shechem,
on their part, did not risk an open rupture for fear of the consequences.
' See p. 155, supra, for what is there said on Baal-berith. == The word “ Millo ” is a generic term, meaning citadel or stronghold of the city : there was a Millo in every important town, Jerusalem included. ^ The “oak of the pillar” was a sacred tree overshadowing probably a cippus : it may have been the tree mentioned in Gen. xxxv. 4, under which Jacob buried the strange gods; or that referred to in Josh. xxiv. 26, under which Joshua set up a stone commemorative of the establishment of the law. Jotham, the youngest son of Gideon, escaped the massacre. As soon as he heard of the election of Abimelech, he ascended Mount Gerizim, and gave out from there the fable of the trees, applying it to the circumstances of the time, and then fled. Some critics think that this fable— which is confessedly
old—was inserted in the text at a time when prophetical ideas prevailed and monarchy was not yet accepted.

Gaal, son of Ebed,’ a soldier of fortune and of Israelitish blood, arrived
upon the scene, attended by his followers : he managed to gain the confi
dence of the people of Shechem, who celebrated under his protection the
feast of the Vintage.^ On this occasion their merry-making was disturbed
by the presence among them of the officer charged with collecting the
tithes, and Gaal did not lose the opportunity of stimulating their ire by
his ironical speeches : “ Who is Abimelech, and who is Shecheua, that we
should serve him? is not he the son of Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer?
serve ye the men of Ilamor the father of Shechem : but why should we
serve him ? And wmuld to God this people were under my hand ! then
would I remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
army, and come out.” Zebul promptly gave information of this to his master,
and invited him to come by niglit and lie in ambush in the vicinity of the
town, “ that iu the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shalt rise early,
and set upon the city : and, behold, when he and the people tliat is with him
come out against thee, thou mayest do to them as thou shalt find occasion.”
It turned out as he foresaw ; the inhabitants of Shechem went out in order to
take j)art in the gathering iu of tlie vintage, while Gaal posted his men at the
entering in of the gate of the city. As he looked towards the hills he thought
he saw an unusual movement among the trees, and, turning round, said to
Zebul who was close by, “ Behold, there come people down from the tops of the
mountains. And Zebul said unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the moun
tains as if they were men.” A moment after he looked in another direction,
“ and spake again and said. See, there come people down by the middle of th^
land, and one company cometh by the way of the terebinth of the augurs.”
Zebul, seeing the affair turn out so well, threw off the mask, and replied rail
ingly, “ AVhere is now thy mouth, wherewith thou saidst, AVho is Abimelech,
that we should serve him ? is not this the people that thou hast despised ?
go out, I pray, now, and fight with him.” The King of Mauasseh had no
difficulty iu defeating his adversary, but arresting the pursuit at the gates of
the city, he withdrew to the neighbouring village of Arumah.'^ He trusted that
the inhabitants, who had taken no part iu the aftair, would believe that his
wrath had been appeased by the defeat of Gaal ; and so, in fact, it turned out
' The name Ebeil (“ slave,” “ servant ”) is assumed to have been snb.stituted iu the Massoretic text for the original name Jobaal (which api)ears in tlie LXX. as TwySiyA), because of the element Baal in the latter word, whicli was regarded as that of the strange god, and would thus have the sacrilegious meaning, “ Jahveh is Baal.” Tlie term of contempt, Ebed, was, according to this view, thus used to replace it. ’ See on the subject of this festival, p. 102, supra. ^ This is now El-Ormeh, i.e. Kharbet el-Eurmah, to the south-west of Nablus (Gukiun, Sumarie^

they dismissed their unfortunate cham[iion, and on the morrow returned to
their labours as if notliing had occurred. Abimelech had arranged his Abiezer
ites in three divisions : one of which made for the gates, while the other two
fell upon the scattered labourers in the vineyards. Abimelech then fought
against the city and took it, but the chief citizens had taken refuge in “ the
hold of the house of El-berith.” “ Abimelech gat him up to Mount Zalmon,
he and all the people that were with him ; and Abimelech took an axe in his
hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his
shoulder : and he said unto the people that were with him, What ye have
seen me do, make haste, and do as I have done. And all the people likewise
cut down every man Ids bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the
hold, and set the hold on tire upon them ; so that all the men of the tower of
Shechem died also, about a thousand men and women.” This summary ven
geance did not, however, prevent other rebellions. Thebez imitated Shechem,

the city had taken refuge, when
a woman threw a millstone
down upon his head “ and brake
his skull.” The narrative tells
us that, feeling himself mortally
wounded, he called his armour
bearer to liim and said, “ Draw
thy sword, and kill me, that men
say not of me, A woman slew
him.” His monarchy ceased
with him, and the ancient
chronicler recognises in the
catastrophe a just punishment
for the atrocious crime he had
committed in slaying his half
brothers, the seventy children
of Jerubbaal.^ His fall may be
regarded also as the natural issue
of his peculiar position : the
resources upon which he relied were inadequate to secure to him a supremacy
in Israel. Manasseh, now deprived of a chief, and given up to internal dissen
sions, became still further enfeebled, and an easy prey to its rivals. The divine
w'ritings record in several places the success attained by the central tribes
in their conflict with their enemies. They describe how a certain Jephthah
<listinguished himself in freeing Gilead from the Ammonites ;
^ but his
triumph led to the loss of his daughter, w’hom he sacrificed in order to
fulfil a vow he had made to Jahveh before the battle.^ These were, however,
comparatively unimportant episodes in the general history of the Hebrew
' Judges ix. 23, 21. “ And (Jod sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Sbechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherousl)' with Abimelech : that the violence done to the three•score and ten sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother, which slew them, and upon the men of Shechem, which strengthened his hands to slay his brethren.” - Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a bas-relief in the Ramesseum ; cf.

This is a portion of the picture representing the capture of Ascalon by Ramses II. ^ The story of Jephthah is contained in chajis. xi., xii. 1-7, of the Book of Judges. The passage (xi. 12-29) is regarded by some, owing to its faint echo of certain portions of Numb, xx., xxi., to be an interpolation. .Jephthah is said to have had Gilead for his father and a harlot for his mother. Various views have been put forward as to the account of his victories over the Midiauites, some seeing in it, ns well as in the origin of the four days’ feast in honour of Jephthah’s daughter, insertions of a later date. ' There are two views as to the nature of the sacrifice of Jephthah’s daughter. Some think she was vowed to perpetual virginity, while others consider that she was actually sacrificed (see Reuss, Hist, des Israelites, pp. 199, 200).

race. Beclawins from tlie East, sheikhs of the Midianites, Moabites, and
Ammonites—all these marauding peoples of the frontier whose incursions
are put on record—gave them continual trouble, and rendered their existence
so miserable that they were unable to develop their institutions and attain
the permanent freedom after which they aimed. But their real dangers
the risk of perishing altogether, or of falling back into a condition of servitude

did not arise from any of these quarters, but from the Philistines.
By a decree of Pharaoh, a new country had been assigned to the remnants
•of each of the maritime peoples : the towns nearest to Egypt, lying between
Eaphia and Joppa, were given over to the Philistines, and the forest region and
the coast to the north of the Philistines, as far as the Phoenician stations of Dor
and Carmel,^ were appropriated to the Zakkala. The latter was a military
colony, and was chiefly distributed among the five fortresses which commanded
the Shephelah.'^ Gaza and Ashdod were separated from the Mediterranean by a
line of sand-dunes, and had nothing in the nature of a sheltered port—nothing,
in fact, but a “ maiuma,” or open roadstead, with a few dwellings and storehouses
arranged along the beach on which their boats were drawn up, Ascalon was
built on the sea, and its harbour, although well enough suited for the small
craft of the ancients, could not have been entered by the most insignificant
of our modern ships. The Philistines had here their naval arsenal, where their
fleets were fitted out for scouring the Egyptian waters as a marine police,

or for piratical expeditions on their own account, when the occasion served,
along the coasts of Phoenicia^ Ekron and
Gath kept watch over the eastern side of
the plain at the points where it was most
exposed to the attacks of the people of
the hills—the Canaanites in the first in
stance, and afterwards the Hebrews. These
foreign warriors soon changed their mode
of life in contact with the indigenous in
habitants ; daily intercourse, followed up
by marriages with the daughters of the
land, led to the substitution of the language,
mnnners, and religion of the environing
race for those of their mother country.
The Zakkala, who were not numerous, it is true, lost everything, even
to their name, and it was all that the Philistines could do to preserve
their own. At the end of one or two generations, the “ colts ” of Palestine
could only speak the Canaanite tongue, in which a few words of the old
Hellenic ijcitois still continued to survive.^ Their gods were henceforward
those of the towns in which they resided, such as Mama and Dagon and
Gaza,^ Dagon at Ashdod,® Baalzebub at Ekron,® and Derketo in xlscalon ;
and their mode of worship, with its mingled bloody and obscene rites, followed

It seems more probable that they belonged to one of the non-Semitic tribes which had settled in that island, and that they were, as Hitzig points out (Urgeschichte der Philister, p. 37, et seq.), allied to the insular and continental Greeks. Hitzig attempted to identify the name Anchises with tliat of Akish, King of Gath, and Kenan thought there still survived in Hebrew a few Greek words which had come from their language, e.g. prhr, nepi^oKos, mekera, pidlex, irdwa^ {Hist, du peuple d’ Israel, vol. ii. p. 33). Akish is met with from the XIA'** dynasty onwards (W. M.v.k Mulleu, Die Keflo-Namen, in the Zeitschrifl fiir Assyriologie, vol. is. pp. 394, 395), and under Sargou of Assyria (W.

Ste])hen of Byzantium gives the name as Zeus Kprirayerns, s.v. Tdfa. The worship of Dagon at Gaza is mentioned in the story of Samson {Judges xvi. 21-30). •’ The temple .and statue of Dagon are mentioned in the account of the events following the taking of the ark in 1 Sam. v. 1-7. It is, perhaps, to him that 1 Chron. .v. 10 refers, in relating how the Philistines hung up Saul’s arms in the house of their gods, although 1 Sam. xxxi. 10 calls the place the ‘‘ house of the Aslitoreth.” “ Baalzebub was the god of Ekron (2 Kings i. 2-0), and his name was doubtfully translated ” Lord of Elies.” The discovery of the name of the town Zebub on the Tell el-Amarna tablets shows that it means the “Baal of Zebub” (HALEVY,Kec7(erc/ies Bihliques, xxvii., in the Revue Se'mitique, vol. i. p. 23; 5V1NCKLER, Geschichte Israels, vol. i. pj). 223, note 1 , 225). Zebub was situated in the Philistine plains, not fur from Ekron. Hale'vy thinks it may have been a suburb of that town.

temperament which had enabled them to fight their way through many
obstacles from the shores of the ^gean to the frontiers of Egypt. Tliey
could recall their island of Caphtor,'^ and their neighbours in their new home
were accustomed to bestow upon them the designation of Cretans, of which
they themselves were not a little proud.'^ Gaza enjoyed among them a kind
of hegemony, alike on account of its strategic position and its favourable
situation for commerce, but this supremacy was of very precarious character,
and brought with it no right whatever to meddle in the internal affairs
* Drawn by Fauclier-Gudin, from a photograph taken by Insinger in 1881. ^ Jer. xlvii. 4 calls them “ the remnant of the isle of Caphtor ; ” Amos (ix. 7) knew that the Lord had brought “ the Philistines from Caphtor; ” and in Deut. ii. 23 it is related how “ the Caphtorim which came forth out of Caphtor destroyed the Avvim, which dwelt in villages as far as Gaza, and dwelt in their stead.” Classical tradition falls in with the sacred record, and ascribes a Cretan origin to the Philistines ; it is suggested, therefore, that in Gen. x. 14 the names Casluhim and Caphtorim should be transposed, to bring the verse into harmony with history and otlier parts of Scripture. ^ In an episode in the life of David (1 Sam. xxx. 14), there is mention of the “ south of the Cherethites,” which some have made to mean Cretans— that is to say, the region to the south of the Philistines, alongside the territory of Judah, and to the “south of Caleb.” Ezelc. xxv. 16 also mentions in juxtaposition with the Philistines the Cherethites, and “the remnant of the sea-coast,” as objects of God’s vengeance for the many evils they had inflicted on Israel. By the Cherethini& here, and the Cherethites in Zeph. ii. .5, the Cretans are by some thought to be meant, which would account for their association with the Philistines.

of other members of the confederacy. Each of the latter had a chief of
its own, a Seren,^ and the office of this chief was hereditary in one case at
least — Gath, for instance, where there existed a larger Canaanite element
tlian elsewhere, and was there identified with that of “ melek,” ^ or king. The
five Sarnim assembled in council to deliberate upon common interests, and
to offer sacrifices in the name of the Pentapolis. These chiefs were
respectively free to make alliances, or to take the field on their own account,
but in matters of common importance they acted together, and took their
places each at the head of his own contingent.® Their armies were made up of
regiments of skilled archers and of pikemen, to whom were added a body of
charioteers made up of the princes and the nobles of the nation. The armour
for all alike was the coat of scale mail and the helmet of brass; their
weapons consisted of the two-edged battle-axe, the bow, the lance, and a large
and heavy sword of bronze or iron.'^ Their war tactics were probably similar
to those of the Egyptians, who were unrivalled in military operations at this
period throughout the whole East. Under able leadership, and in positions
favourable for the operations of their chariots, the Philistines had nothing to
fear from the forces which any of their foes could bring up against them. As to
tlieir maritime history, it is certain that in the earliest period, at least, of their
sojourn in Syria, as well as in that before their capture by Ramses III., they
Avere successful in sea-fights, but the memory of only one of their expeditious
lias come down to us : a squadron of theirs having sailed forth from Ascalon
somewhere towards the end of the XIP'‘ dynasty,*" succeeded in destroying
the Sidonian fleet, and pillaging Sidon itself. But however vigorously they
may have plied the occupation of Corsairs at the outset of their career, there
was, it would appear, a rapid falling off“ in their maritime prowess : it was on land,
and as soldiers, that they displayed their bravery and gained their fame. Their
geographical position, indeed, on the direct and almost only route for caravans
jiassing between Asia and Africa, must have contributed to their success.
* Tlie same plisMim figure in the narrative of the last Philistine campaign against Saul (1 Sam. xxix. Z-4, 7, 9). Their number, five, is expressly mentioned in 1 Sam. vi. 4, 16-18, as well as the names of the towns over which they ruled. - Achish was King of Gath (1 Sam. xxi. 10, 12, xxvii. 2), and probably Maoch before him. ^ Achish, for example. King of Gath, makes war alone against the pillaging tribes, owing to the intervention of David and his men, without being called to account by the other princes (1 Sam. xxvii.
2-12, xxviii. 1, 2), btit as soon as an ail'air of moment is in contemplation— such as the war against
Saul— they demand the dismissal of David, and Achish is obliged to submit to his colleagues acting together (1 Sam. xxix.). ^ Philistine archers are mentioned in the battle of Gilboa (1 Sam. xxxi. 3) as well as chariots (2 Sam. i. 0). The horsemen mentioned in the same connexion are regarded by some critics as an interpolation, because they cannot bring themselves to think that the Philistines had cavalry corps in tlie X‘'‘ century b.c. The Philistine arms are described at length in the duel between David and Goliath (1 Sam. xvii. 5-7, 38, 39). They are in some respects like those of the Homeric heroes. ^ Justinus, xviii. 3, § 5. The memory of this has been preserved, owing to the disputes about precedence which raged in the Greek period between the Phoenician towns. The destruction of Sidon must have allowed Tyre to develop and take the first j)lace.

The number of such caravans was considerable, for although Egypt had

of the East. A very great part of her trade with foreign countries was carried
on through the mouths of the Nile, and of this commerce the Phoenicians had
made themselves masters ; the remainder followed the land-routes, and passed
continually through the territory of the Philistines. These people were
in possession of the tract of land which lay between the Mediterranean and
the beginning of the southern desert, forming as it were a narrow passage, into
which all the roads leading from the Nile to the Euphrates necessarily converged.
The chief of these routes was that which crossed Mount Carmel, near Meo-iddo,
and passed up the valleys of the Litany and the Orontes. This was met
at intervals by other secondary roads, such as that which came from
Damascus by way of Tabor and the plain of Jezreel, or those which, starting
out from the highland of Gilead, led through the fords of the Lower Jordan
to Ekron and Gath respectively. The Philistines charged themselves, after
the example and at the instigation of the Egyptians, with the maintenance of
the great trunk road which was in their hands, and also with securing safe
transit along it, as far as they could post their troops, for those who confided
themselves to their care. In exchange for these good offices they exacted the
same tolls which had been levied by the Canaanites before them.

702 IHE IlEBBEWS AND THE FIIILIHTINES — DA^IASGUS.
In their efforts to put down brigandage, they had been brought into contact
with some of the Hebrew clans after the latter had taken possession of Canaan.
Judah, in its home among the mountains of the Dead Sea, had become
acquainted Avith the diverse races which were found there, and consequently
there had been frequent intermarriages between the Hebrews and these
peoples. Some critics have argued from this that the chronicler had this fact
in his mind when he assigned a Canaanite wife, Shuah, to the father of the
tribe himseltj He relates how Judah, having separated from his brethren,
turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name Avas Hirah,” and that here he
became acquainted with Shuah, by Avhom he had three sons. With Tamar,
file widoAv of the elde.st of the latter, he had accidental intercourse, and two
<!hildren, Perez and Zerah, the ancestors of numerous families, Avere born of
tliat union.^ Edomites, Arabs, and Midianites Avere associated Avith this semi
Canaanite stock — for example, Kain, Caleb, Othniel, Kenaz, Shobal, Ephah, and
Jerahmeel, but the Kenites took the first place among them, and played an
important part in the history of the conquest of Canaan.'^ It is related how
one of their sul)divisions, of Avhich Caleb was the eponymous hero, had driven
Irom Hebron the three sons of Anak — Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai— and had
then promised his daughter Achsah in marriage to him Avho sliould capture
1 >ebir ; this turned out to be his youngest brother Othniel, Avho captured the
<ity, and at tlie same time obtained a wite.^ Hobab, another Ivenite, who is
lepiesented to have been the brother-in-hiAv of Moses, occupied a position to
the soutli of Arad, in Idumrean territoi'y.® These heterogeneous elements
existed alongside eacli otlier for a long time Avithout intermingling; they
combined, hoAvever, now and again to act against a common foe, for Ave knoAv
that the people of Judah aided the tribe of Simeon in the reduction of the
city of Zephath ;
® but they followed an independent course for the most part,
and their isolation prevented their obtaining, for a lengthened period, any
extension of territory. Ihey failed, as at first, in their attempts to subjugate
the province of Arad, and in their efforts to capture the fortresses Avhich
guaided the caravan routes between Ashdod and the mouth of the Jordan.
It is related, however, that they overthrew Adoni-bezek, King of the Jebusites,
and that they had dealt Avith him as he Avas accustomed to deal Avith his
piisoneis. ‘And Adoni-bezek said. Threescore and ten kings, having their

as I have done, so God hath requited me.” ^ Although Adoni-bezek had
been overthrown Jerusalem still remained independent, as did also Gibeon,
Beeroth, Kirjath-Jearim, Ajalon, Gezer, and the cities of the plain, for the
Israelites could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley, because they had
chariots of iron, with which the Hebrew foot-soldiers found it difficult to deal.'^
This independent and isolated group was not at first, however, a subject of
anxiety to the masters of the coast, and there is but a bare reference to the
exploits of a certain Shamgar, son of Anath, who “ smote of the Philistines
six hundred men with an ox-goad.”^ These cities had also to reckon with
Ephraim, and the tribes which had thrown in their lot with her. Dan
had cast his eyes upon the northern districts of the Shephelah— which were
dependent upon Ekron or Gath—and also upon the semi-Phmnician port of
Joppa ; but these tribes did not succeed in taking possession of those
districts, although they had harassed them from time to time by raids in
which the children of Israel did not always come off victorious. One of
their chiefs—Samson—had a great reputation among them for his bravery
and bodily strength, and we have some details of his history. The episodes
which have been preserved deal with some of his exploits against the Philis
tines, and there is a certain humour in the chronicler’s account of the weapons

which he employed : “ with the jawbone of an ass have I smitten a thousand men ;
” he burned up their harvest also by letting go three hundred foxes,
with torches attached to their tails, among the standing corn of the Philis
tines. Various events in his career are subsequently narrated; such as
his adventure in the house of the harlot at Gaza, when he carried off the
gate of the city and the gate-posts “to the top of the mountain that is
before Hebron.” By Delilah’s treachery he was finally delivered over to his
enemies, who, having put out his eyes, condemned him to grind in the prison
house. On the occasion of a great festival in honour of Dagon he was brought
into the temple to amuse his captors, but while they were making merry at
his expense, he took hold of the two pillars against which he was resting, and
bowing “ himself with all his might,” overturned them, “ and the house fell
upon the lords, and upon all the people that were therein.”^ The tribe of Dan
at length became weary of these unprofitable struggles, and determined to
seek out another and more easily defensible settlement. They sent out
five emissaries, therefore, to look out for a new home. While these Avere
passing through the mountains they called upon a certain Michah in the hill
country of Ephraim and lodged there. Here they took counsel of a Levite
Avhom Michah liad made his priest, and, in answer to the question whetlier
their journey would be prosperous, he told them to “Go in peace: before the
Lord is the way wherein ye go.” Their search turned out successful, for they
discovered near the sources of tlie Jordan the town of Laish, whose people, like
the Zidonians, dwelt in security, fearing no trouble. On the report of the
emissaries, Dan decided to emigrate : the warriors set out to the number
of six hundred, carried off with them the priest of Michah and his ephod,
teraphim, and graven image, and succeeded in capturing Laish, to which they
gave the name of their tribe. “ The children of Dan set up for themselves the
o-raven ima"e : and Jonathan, the sou of Gershom, the son of Moses, he and
O
his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until tlie day of the captivity
of the land.” ^ Tlie tribe of Dan displayed in this advanced post of peril the
bravery it had shown on the frontiers of the Shephelah, and showed itself
tlie most bellicose of the tribes of Israel. It bore out well its character— “ Dan
is a lion’s whelp that leapeth forth from Bashan ” on the Hermon ;

^ Some critics see in the history of this migration, which is given summarily in Josh. xix. 17, a blcndin" of two accounts. Bodde, Die Biicher Richter, etc., pp. 138-14(1, has attempted a reconstruction of the narrative. The presence of a descendant of Moses as a priest in this local sanctuary probably offended the religious scruples of a copyist, who substituted Manasseh for Moses (Judges xviii. 30), but the correction was not generally accepted. [The R.V. reads “Moses” where the authorised
text (and the l.XX. also) has “ IManasseh.” — r.]. ^ See the lllessing of Moses (Deut. xxxiii, 22).

protect Galilee for centuries against the incursions of the Arammans.
Their departure, however, left the descendants of Joseph unprotected, with
Benjamin as their only bulwark. Benjamin, like Dan, was one of the tribes
which contained scarcely more than two or three clans, but compensated for

the smallness of their numbers by their energy and tenacity of character
lying to the south of Ephraim, they had developed into a breed of hardy
adventurers, skilled in handling the bow and sling, accustomed from child
hood to use both hands indifferently, and always ready to set out on any
expedition, not only against the Canaanites, but, if need be, against their own
kinsfolk.^ They had consequently aroused the hatred of both friend and foe,
and we read that the remaining tribes at length decreed their destruction ;
a massacre ensued, from which six hundred Benjamites only escaped to
continue the race.^ Their territory adjoined on the south that of Jerusalem,
the fortress of the Jebusites, and on the west the powerful confederation of
which Gibeon was the head. It comprised some half-dozen towns—Ramah,
Anathoth, Michmash, and Nob, and thus commanded both sides of the passes
leading from the Shephelah into the valley of the Jordan. The Benjamites

were in the habit of descending suddenly upon merchants who were making
their way to or returning from Gilead, and of robbing them of their wares ;
sometimes they would make a raid upon the environs of Ekron and Gath, “like
a wolf that ravineth : ” realising the prediction of Jacob, “ in the morning he
shall devour the prey, and at even he shall divide the spoil.” ^ The Philistines
never failed to make reprisals after each raid, and the Benjamites were no
match for their heavily armed battalions ; but the labyrinth of ravines and
nai’i’ow gorges into which the Philistines had to penetrate to meet their enemy
was a favourable region for guerilla warfare, in which they were no match for
their opponents. Peace was never of long duration on this ill-defined border
land, and neither intercourse between one village and another, alliances, nor
intermarriage between the two peoples had the effect of interrupting hostili
ties ; even when a truce was made at one locality, the feud would be kept
up at other points of contact. All details of this conflict have been
lost, and we merely know that it terminated in the defeat of the house
of Joseph, a number of whom were enslaved. The ancient sanctuary of
Shiloh still continued to be the sacred town of the Hebrews, as it had been
under the Canaanites, and the people of Ephraim kept there the ark of
Jahveh-Sabaoth, “the Lord of hosts.” ^ It was a chest of wood, similar in
shape to the shrine which surmounted the sacred barks of the Egyptian
divinities, but instead of a prophesying statue, contained the two tables of
the Mosaic law.® Yearly festivals were celebrated before it, and it was con
sulted as an oracle by all the Israelites. Eli, the priest to whose care it
was at this time consigned, had earned universal respect by the austerity
of his life and by his skill in interpreting the divine oracles.^ His two sons,
on the contrary, took advantage of his extreme age to annoy those who came
up to worship, and they were even accused of improper behaviour towards
the women who “served at the door of” the tabernacle. They appropriated
to themselves a larger portion of the victims than they were entitled to, ex
tracting from the caldron the meat offerings of the faithful after the sacrifice
was over by means of flesh-hooks. Their misdeeds were such, that “men
abhoired the offering of the Lord,” and yet the reverence for the ark was
' He is thus characterised in the Blessing of Jacob {Gen. xlix. 27).
“ At the very opening of the First Book of Samuel (i. 3), Shiloh is mentioned as being the sanctuary
of Jahveh-Sabaoth, Jahveh the Lord of hosts. The facts given in Josh, xviii. 1 show that the date of
its foundation there goes back to the earliest times of the Israelite conquest ; cf. supra, p. 682.
^ The statement that the tables of the law were enclosed within the ark is frequently repeated
in Exodus and in subsequent books of the Hexateuch. * The history of Eli extends over chaps, i.-iv. of the First Book of Samuel it is incorporated with
that of Samuel, and treats only of the events which accompanied the destruction of the sanctuary of
Shiloh by the Philistines. For the views of certain critics as to the sources of the narrative, cf.
Bleek-Wellhausen, Einleitung in das alte Testament, 4th edit., pp. 204-206 ; and lastly, Budde,
Die Bucher Richter und Samuelis, p. 196, et seq.).



BENJAMIN AND BIS POSITION ON THE PHILISTINE FRONTIEB. 707
so great in the minds of the people, that they continued to have recourse
to it on every occasion of national danger/ The people of Ephraim and
Benjamin having been defeated once between Eben-ezer and Aphek, bore
the ark in state to the battle-field, that its presence might inspire them
with confidence. The Philistines were alarmed at its advent, and exclaimed,
“God is come into the camp. Woe unto ns! Who shall deliver us out of
the hand of these mighty gods ? ... Be strong, and quit yourselves like
men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they
have been to you.” ^ In response to this appeal, their troops fought so boldly
that they once more gained a victory. “ And there ran a man of Benjamin
out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and
with earth upon his head. And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon his seat by
the wayside watching : for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out. And when Eli
heard the noise of the crying, he said, What meaneth the noise of this
tumult ? And the man hasted, and came and told Eli. Now Eli was ninety
and eight years old ; and his eyes were set, that he could not see. And the
man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army, and I fled to-day
out of the army. And he said. How went the matter, my son ? And he
that brought the tidings answered and said, Israel is fled before the Philis
tines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among the people, and thy
two sons also, Hophni and Phineas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken. And
it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that he fell from
off his seat backward by the side of the gate, and his neck brake, and he died
for he was an old man, and heavy.” ^
The defeat at Eben-ezer completed, at least for the time, the overthrow
of the tribes of Central Canaan. The Philistines destroyed the sanctuary of
Shiloh,^ and placed a garrison at Gibeah to keep the Benjamites in subjection,
and to command the route of the Jordan ;
® it would even appear that they
pushed their advance-posts beyond Carmel in order to keep in touch with the
independent Canaanite cities such as Megiddo, Taanach, and Bethshan, and to
ensure a free use of the various routes leading in the direction of Damascus,
Tyre, and Ccele-Syria.® The Philistine power continued dominant for at least
half a century. The Hebrew chroniclers, grieved at the successes of their
heathen oppressors, have left us but a meagre account of this period, and have

Friendly relations with Bethshan entailed almost as a matter of course some similar understanding with the cities of the plain of Jezreel.



708 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
confined themselves to a record of the few Israelite victories. Just at this time,
however, there lived a man who was able to inspire them with fresh hope. He
was a priest of Earn ah, Samuel, the son of Elkanah, who had acquired the
reputation of being a just and wise judge in the towns of Bethel, Gilgal, and
]\Iizpah ; “and he judged Israel in all those places, and his return was to
Kamah, for there was his house .... and he built there an altar unto the
Lord.” ^ To this man the whole Israelite nation attributed with pride the
deliverance of their race. The sacred writings relate how his mother, the pious
Hannah, had obtained his birth from Jahveh after years of childlessness, and
had forthwith devoted him to the service of God. She had sent him to Shiloh
at the age of three years, and there, clothed in a linen tunic and in a little
robe which his mother made for him herself, he ministered before God in the
presence of Eli. One night it happened, when the latter was asleep in his
place, “ and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down
to sleep in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, that the Lord
called Samuel : and he said. Here am 1. And he ran unto Eli, and said. Here
am I ; for thou calledst me. And he said, I called thee not; lie down again.”
Twice again the voice was heard, and at length Eli perceived that it was God
who had called the child, and he bade him reply : “ Speak, Lord ; for Thy
servant heareth.” From thenceforward Jahveh was “with him, and did let
none of his words fall to the ground. And all Israel from Dan even to Beer
sheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of the Lord.”'-^
Twenty years after the sad death of his master, Samuel felt that the moment
had come to throw off the Philistine yoke; he exhorted the people to put
away their false gods, and he assembled them at Mizpah to absolve them from
their sins. The Philistines, suspicious of this concourse, which boded ill for
the maintenance of their authority, arose against him. “ And when the
children of Israel heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. And Samuel
took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a whole burnt offering unto the Lord :
and Samuel cried unto the Lord for Israel, and the Lord answered him.” The
Philistines, demoralised bjr the thunderstorm which ensued, were overcome
on the very spot where they had triumphed over the sons of Eli, and fled
in disorder to their own country. “Then Samuel took a stone, and set it
between Mizpah and Shen, and called the name of it Eben-ezer (the Stone
of Help), saying. Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.” He next attacked
the Tyuians and the Amorites, and won back from them all the territory

anleiioi to liis relations with Saul. This account seems to reju’esent him as exercising merely a
restricted influence over tlie territory of Benjamin and the south of Ephraim; his position as judge
of all Israel seems to have developed at a later period. ^ 1 Sam. i.-iii.



SAMUEL AND TEE PHILISTINE RULE IN CANAAN. 709
they had conquered^ One passage, in which Samuel is not mentioned,
tells us how heavily the Philistine yoke had weighed upon the people, and
explains their long patience by the fact that their enemies had taken away
all their weapons. “Now there was no smith found throughout all the land
of Israel : for the Philistines said. Lest the Hebrews make them swords or
spears ; ” and whoever needed to buy or repair the most ordinary agricultural
implements was forced to address himself to the Philistine blacksmiths.^
The very extremity of the evil worked its own cure. The fear of the Midian
ites had already been the occasion of the ephemeral rule of Jerubbaal and
Abimelech ; the Philistine tyranny forced first the tribes of Central and then
those of Southern Canaan to unite under the leadership of one man. In face
of so redoubtable an enemy and so grave a peril a greater effort was required,
and the result was proportionate to their increased activity.
The Manassite rule extended at most over two or three clans, but that
of Saul and David embraced the whole Israelite nation.^ Benjamin at
that time reckoned among its most powerful chiefs a man of ancient and
noble family— Saul, the son of Kish — who possessed extensive flocks and
considerable property, and was noted for his personal beauty, for “there
was not among the children of Israel a goodlier person than he: from
his shoulders and upward he was higher than any of the people.”^ He had
already reached mature manhood, and had several children, the eldest of
whom, Jonathan, was well known as a skilful and brave soldier, while Saul’s
reputation was such that his kinsmen beyond Jordan had recourse to his aid
as to a hero whose presence would secure victory. The Ammonites had laid
siege to Jabesh-Cilead, and the town was on the point of surrendering ; Saul
came to their help, forced the enemy to raise the siege, and inflicted such a
severe lesson upon them, that during the whole of his lifetime they did not
again attempt hostilities. He was soon after proclaimed king by the Ben
jamites, as Jerubbaal had been raised to authority by the Manassites on the
* This manner of retaliating against the Philistines for the disaster they had formerly inflicted on Israel, is supposed by some critics to be an addition of a later date, either belonging to the time of the prophets, or to the period when the Jews, without any king or settled government, rallied at Mizpah. According to these scholars, 1 Sam. vii. 2-14 forms part of a biography, written at a time when the foundation of the Benjamite monarchy had not as yet been attributed to Saul (Recss, Hitt, des Israelites, p. 252); a resume of some of these theories is given in Stade, Gesch. des Volkes Israel, vol. i. pp. 197-206. * 1 Sam. xiii. 20, 21. ’ The beginning of Saul’s reign, up to his meeting with David, will be found in 1 Sam. viii.-xv.
We can distinguish the remains of at least two ancient narratives, which the writer of the Book of Samuel has put together in order to form a complete and continuous account. As elsewhere in this work, I have confined myself to accepting the results at which criticism has arrived, without entering into detailed discussions which do not come within the domain of history. * 1 Sam. ix. 2. In one account he is represented as quite a young man, whose father is still in the prime of life (1 Sam. ix.), but this cannot refer to the time of the Philistine war, where we find him accompanied, at the very outset of his reign, by his son, who is already skilled in the use of weapons.



710 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES —DAMASCUS.
morrow of his victory.^ We learn from the sacred writings that Samuel’s
influence had helped to briug about these events. It had been shown him
by the divine voice that Saul was to be the chosen ruler, and he had anointed
him and set him before the people as their appointed lord ; the scene of this
must have been either Mizpah or Gilgal.^ The accession of a sovereign who
possessed the allegiance of all Israel could not fail to arouse the vigilance of
their Philistine oppressors ; Jonathan, however, anticipated their attack and
captured Gibeah. The five kings at once despatched an army to revenge this
loss; the main body occupied Michmash, almost opposite to the stronghold
taken from them, wliile three bands of soldiers were dispersed over the country,
ravaging as they went, with orders to attack Saul in the rear. The latter had
only six hundred men, with whom he scarcely dared to face so large a force
besides which, he was separated from the enemy by the Wady Suweinit, here
narrowed almost into a gorge between two precipitous rocks, and through which
no body of troops could penetrate without running the risk of exposing them
selves in single file to tlie enemy. Jonathan, however, resolved to attempt a
surprise in broad daylight, accompanied only by his armour-bearer. “ There
was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side : and the
name of the one was Bozez (the Shining), and the name of the other Seneh
(the Acacia). The one crag rose up on the north in front of Michmash, and
the other on the south in front of Geba (Gibeah).”^ The two men descended
the side of the gorge, on the top of which they were encamped, and prepared
openly to climb the opposite side. The Philistine sentries imagined they
were deserters, and said as they approached : “ Behold, the Hebrews come
forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves. And the men of the
garrison answered Jonathan and his armour-bearer, and said, Come up to us,
and we will show you a thing. And Jonathan said unto his armour-bearer.
Come up after me : for the Lord hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.
And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armour
bearer after him : and they fell before Jonathan ; and his armour-bearer slew
tliem after him. And that first slaughter that Jonathan and his armour
bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow’s length in
an acre of land.” From Gibeah, where Saul’s troops were in ignorance of what
was passing, the Benjamite sentinels could distinguish a tumult. Saul guessed
* 1 Sam. xi. According to the text of the LXX., tlie war against the Ammonites broke out a month after Saul had been secretly anointed by Samuel ; his popular proclamation did not take place till after the return from the campaign. ^ One narrative appears to represent him as being only the priest or local prophet of Hamah, and depicts him as favourable to the establishment of the monarchy (1 Sam. ix. 1-27, x. 1-16); the other, however, admits that he was “judge” of all Israel, and implies that he was hostile to the choice of a king (1 Sam. viii. 1-22, x. 17, 27, xii. 1-25). ^ 1 Sam. xiv. 4, 5.






712 THE HEBBEWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
that a surprise had taken place, and marched upon the enemy. The Philis
tines were ousted from their position, and pursued hotly beyond Bethel as far
as Ajalon.i This constituted the actual birthday of the Israelite monarchy.
Gilead, the whole house of Joseph—Ephraim and Manasseh—and Benjamin
termed its nucleus, and were Saul’s strongest supporters. We do not know
how far his influence extended northwards ; it probably stopped short at the
ueiglibourhood of Mount Tabor, and the Galilseans either refused to submit to
his authority, or acknowledged it merely in theory. In the south the clans of
Judah and Simeon were not long in rallying round him, and their neighbours
the Kenites, with Caleb and Jerahmeel, soon followed their example. These
southerners, however, appear to have been somewhat half-hearted in their
allegiance, to the Benjamite king: it was not enough to have gained their
adhesion —^a stronger tie was needed to attach them to the rest of the nation.
Saul endeavoured to get rid of the line of Canaanite cities which isolated
them from Ephraim, but he failed in the effort, we know not from what
cause, and his attempt produced no other result than to arouse against
him the hatred of the Gibeonite inhabitants.'-^ He did his best to watch over
the security of his new subjects, and protected them against the Amalekites,.
who were constantly harassing them. Their king, Agag, happening to fall
into his hands, he killed him, and destroyed several of their nomad bands,,
thus inspiring the remainder with a salutary terror.^ Some critics think that
all the victories attributed to him—over Moab, Edom, and even the Aramreans
of Zobah— were not won by his own sword, and that some of the projects and
conquests of David have been transferred to his name. At any rate, the
constant incursions of the Philistines could not have left him much time for
fighting in the north and east of his domains. Their defeat at Gibeah was by
no means a decisive one, and they quickly recovered from the blow ; the
conflict with them lasted to the end of Saul’s lifetime, and during the whole
of this period he never lost an opportunity of increasing his army.'^
' The account of these events, separated by the parts relating to the biography of Samuel (1 Sam. xiii. 7li-15a, thought by some to be of a later date) and of the breaking by Jonathan of the fast enjoined by Saul (1 Sam. xiv. 23-45), covers 1 Sam. xiii. 3-7a, 155-23, xiv. 1-22, 46. The detailsappear to be strictly historical ; the number of the Philistines, however, seems to be exaggerated “ 30,000 chariots, and 6000 horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude” ( 1 Sam. xiii. 5). ^ The fact is made known to us by an accidental mention of it in 2 Sam. xxi. 1-11. The motive which induced Saul to take arms against the Gibeonites is immediately apparent when we realise the position occupied by Gibeon between Judah and the tribes of Central Canaan. ^ The part taken by Samuel in the narrative of Saul’s war against the Amalekites (1 Sam. xv.)is thought by some critics to have been introduced with a view of exalting the prophet’s office at the expense of the king and the monarchy. They regard 1 Sam. xiv. 48 as being the sole historic ground of the narrative. ^ 1 Sam. xiv. 47. We may admit his successful skirmishes with Moab, but some writers maintain that the defeat of the Edomites and Aramaeans is a mere anticipation, and consider that the passage is only a rcllection of 2 Sam. viii. 8, and reproduces the list of the wars of David, with the exception of the expedition against Damascus.



TEE GROWTH OF THE BEEJAMITE MONARCHY.
The monarchy was as yet in a very rudimentary state,
without either the pomp or accessories usually associated
with royalty in the ancient kingdoms of the East. Saul, as
King of Israel, led much the same sort of life as when he
was merely a Benjamite chief He preferred to reside at
Gibeah, in the house of his forefathers, with no further re
sources than those yielded by the domain inherited from his
ancestors, together with the spoil taken in battle.^ All that
he had, in addition to his former surroundings, were a priest
hood attached to the court, and a small army entirely at his
own disposal. Ahijah, a descendant of Eli, sacrificed for the
king when the latter did not himself officiate; he fulfilled the
office of chaplain to him in time of war, and was the mouth
piece of the divine oracles when these were consulted as to the
propitious moment for attacking the enemy.^ The army con
sisted of a nucleus of Benjamites, recruited from the king’s
clan, with the addition of any adventurers, whether Israelites or strangers, who
were attracted to enlist under a popular military chief. It comprised archers,
slingers, and bands of heavily armed infantry, after the fashion of the Phoeni
cians, bearing pikes. We can gain some idea of their appearance and equip
ment from the bronze statuettes of an almost contemporary period, which show
us the Phoenician foot-soldiers or the barbarian mercenaries in the pay of the
Phoenician cities : they wear the horizontally striped loin-cloth of the Syrians,
leaving the arms and legs entirely bare, and the head is protected by a
pointed or conical helmet. Saul possessed none of the iron-bound chariots
which always accompanied the Canaanite infantry ; these heavy vehicles would
have been entirely out of place in the mountain districts, which were the usual
field of operations for the Israelite force.^ We are unable to ascertain whether
' Gibeah is nowhere expressly mentioned as being the capital of Saul, but the name Gibeah of Saul which it bore shows that it must have been the royal residence; the names of the towns men
tioned in the account of Saul’s pursuit of David—Naioth, Eamah, and Nob— are all near to Gibeah.
It was also at Gibeah that the Gibeonites slew seven of the sons and grandsons of Saul (2 Sam. xxi. 6-9h no doubt to bring ignominy on the family of the first king in the very place in which they had governed. ^ Ahijah (1 Sam. xiv. 3), son of Ahitub, great-grandson of Eli, appears to be the same as Ahimelech, son of Ahitub, who subsequently helped David (1 Sam. xxi. 1-10), and was massacred by order of
Saul (1 Sam. xxii. 9-19). The scribe must have been shocked by the name Melech—that of the god
Milik [Moloch] —and must have substituted Jah or Jahveh. “ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from the bronze original in the Louvre; cf. Perrot-Chipiez, Hist, de I’Art dans I’Antiquity, vol. iii. p. 405. * With regard to the use of the bow among Saul’s soldiers, cf. 1 Sam. xx. 18-42, where we find the curious scene of the meeting of David and Jonathan when the latter came out of Gibeah on the pretext of practising with bow and arrows. The accoutrement of the Hebrews is given in the passage where Saul lends his armour to David before meeting with Goliath (1 Sam. xvii. 38, 39); it is the same as that of the Philistines described supra, p. 700.



714 TEE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—-DAMASGUS.
the king’s soldiers received any regular pay, but we know that the spoil was
d.ivided between the prince and his men, each according to his rank and in
proportion to the valour he had displayed.^ In cases of necessity the whole
of the tribes were assembled, and a selection was made of all those capable
of bearing arms. This militia, composed mainly of a pastoral peasantry in
the prime of life, capable of heroic efforts, was nevertheless ill-disciplined,
liable to sudden panics, and prone to become disbanded on the slightest
reverse.^ Saul had the supreme command of the whole ; the members of his
own family served as lieutenants under him, including his son Jonathan, to
whom he owed some of his most brilliant victories, together with his cousin
Abner, the sar-zaba, who led the royal guard.^ Among the men of distinguished
valour who had taken service under Saul, he soon singled out David, son of
Jesse, a native of Bethlehem of Judah.^ David was the first Judaean hero,
the typical king who served as a model to all subsequent monarchs. His
elevation, like that of Saul, is traced to Samuel. The old prophet had
repaired to Bethlehem ostensibly to offer a sacrifice, and after examining
all the children of Jesse, he chose the youngest, and “ anointed him in
the midst of his brethren : and the spirit of the Lord came mightily upon
David.” ^ His introduction at the court of Saul is variously accounted for.
According to one narrative, Saul, being possessed by an evil spirit, fell at
times into a profound melancholy, from which he could be aroused only
by the playing of a harp. On learning that David was skilled in this
instrument, he begged Jesse to send him his son, and the lad soon won the
king’s affection. As often as the illness came upon him, David took his
harp, and “ Saul was refreshed, and the evil spirit departed from him.”
Another account relates that he entered on his soldierly career by killing
with his sling Goliath of Gath,'^ who had challenged the bravest Israelites
' Cf. the quarrel which took place between the soldiers of David about the spoil taken from the Amalekites, and the manner in which the strife was decided by David (1 Sam. xxx. 21-25). ° Saul, for instance, assembles the people and makes a selection to attack the Philistines (1 Sam. xiii. 2, 4, 7) against the Ammonites ( 1 Sam. xi. 7, 8) and against the Amalekites (1 Sam. xv. 4). ^ 1 Sam. xiv. 50, 51. There is no record of the part played by Abner during Saul’s lifetime; he begins to figure in the narrative after the battle at Gilboa under the double reign of Ish-bosheth and David ; cf. supra, p. 721. ^ The name of David is a shortened form of Davdo, Dodo, “ tlie favourite of Him,” i.e. God. “ The intervention of the prophet occupies 1 Sam. xvi. 1-13. Some critics have imagined that this passage was interpolated at a later date, and reflects the events which are narrated in chap. x. They say it was to show that Saul was not alone in enjoying consecration by the prophet, and hence all doubt would be set at rest as to whether David was actually that “ neighbour of thine, that is better than thou,” mentioned in 1 Sam. xv. 28 (Budde, Die Biicher Richter und Samuelis, pp. 216, 217). * 1 Sam. xvi. 14-23. This narrative is directly connected with 1 Sam. xiv. 52, where we are told that when “Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he took him unto him” (Stade, Gescli. des Volkes Israel, vol. i. pp. 224, 225). ’ 1 Sam. xvii., xviii. 1-5. According to some writers, this second version, the best known of the two, is a development at a later period of the tradition preserved in 2 Sam. xxi. 19, where the victory •of Elhanan over Goliath is recorded (Stade, Gesch. des Volkes Israel, vol. i. pp. 225-229).

to combat ; though elsewhere the death of Goliath is attributed to Elhanau
of Bethlehem,^ one of the “ mighty men of valour,” wlio specially distinguished
himself in the wars against the Philistines. David had, however, no need
to take to himself the brave deeds of others ; at Ephes-dammim, in company
with Eleazar, the son of Dodai, and Shammah, the son of Agu, he had posted
himself in a field of lentils, and the three warriors had kept the Philistines
at bay till their discomfited Israelite comrades had had time to rally.^ Saul
entrusted him with several difficult undertakings, in all of which he acquitted
himself with honour. On his return from one of them, the women of the
villages came out to meet him, singing and dancing to the sound of timbrels,
the refrain of their song being : “ Saul hath slain his thousands, and David
his ten thousands.” The king concealed the jealousy which this simple
expression of joy excited within him, but it found vent at the next outbreak
of his illness, and he attempted to kill David with a speai’, though soon after
he endeavoured to make amends for his action by giving him his second
daughter Michal in marriage.® This did not prevent the king from again
attempting David’s life, either in a real or simulated fit of madness; but
not being successful, he despatched a body of men to waylay him. According
to one account it was Michal who helped her husband to escape,^ while another
attributes the saving of his life to Jonathan. This prince had already brought
about one reconciliation between his father and David, and had spared no
pains to reinstall him in the royal favour, but his efforts merely aroused the
king’s suspicion against himself. Saul imagined that a conspiracy existed
for the purpose of dethroning him, and of replacing him by his son ; Jonathan,
knowing that his life also was threatened, at length renounced the attempt,
and David and his followers withdrew from court. He was hospitably received
by a descendant of Eli,® Ahimelech the priest, at Nob, and wandered about
in the neighbourhood of Adullam, hiding himself in the wooded valleys of
Khereth, in the heart of Judah. He retained the sympathies of many of the
* 2 Sam. xsi. 19, where the duel of Goliath and Elhanau is placed in the reign of David, during the combat at Gob. Some critics think that the writer of Chronicles, recognising the difficulty presented by this passage, changed the epithet Bethlehemite, which qualified the name of Elhanan, into Lahmi, the name of Goliath’s brother (1 Glvron. xx. 5). Sayce thought to get over the difficulty by supposingthat Elhanan was David’s first name ; but Elhanan is the son of Jair, and not the son of Jesse. ^ The combat of Paz-Dammim or Ephes-Dammim is mentioned in 1 Sam. xvii. 1 ; the exploit of David and his two comrades, 2 Sam. xxiii. 9-12 (cf. 1 Chron. xi. 12-14, which slightly varies from 2 Sam. xxiii. 9-12). ^ The account of the first disagreement between Saul and David, and with regard to the marriage of David with Michal, is given in 1 Sam. xviii. 6-16, 20-29, and presents every appearance of authenticity. Verses 17-19, mentioning a project of union between David and Saul’s eldest daughter, Merab, has at some time been interpolated ; it is not given in the LXX., either because it was not in the Hebrew version they had before them, or because they suppressed it owing to the motive appearing to them insufficient. * 1 Sam. xix. 11-17. Blany critics regard this passage as an interpolation. * 1 Sam. xxi. 8, 9 adds that he took as a weapon the sword of Goliath which was laid up in the sanctuary at Nob.

-Benjamites, more than one of whom doubted whether it would not be to their
advantage to transfer their allegiance from their aged king to this more
youthful hero. Saul got news of their defection, and one day when he was
sitting, spear in hand, under the tamarisk at Gibeah, he indignantly upbraided
his servants, and pointed out to them the folly of their plans. “ Hear, now,
ye Benjamites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vine
yards ? will he make you all captains of thousands and captains of hundreds ? ”
Ahimelech was selected as the victim of the king’s anger : denounced by Doeg,
Saul’s steward, he was put to death, and all his family, with the exception of
Abiathar, one of his sons, perished with him.^ As soon as it became known
that David held the hill-country, a crowd of adventurous spirits flocked to
place themselves under his leadership, anticipating, no doubt, that spoil would
not be lacking with so brave a chief, and he soon found himself at the head
of a small army, with Abiathar as priest, and the ephod, rescued from Nob,
in his possession.^ The country was favourable for their operations ; it was

passes or by paths winding along the edges of precipices. Isolated rocks, acces

The most probable version is given in 1 Sam. xix. 8-10 [11-18 a], xxi. 1-7 [8-10], xxii., and is that which I have followed by preference ; the other version, according to these writers, attributes too important a role to Jonathan, and relates at length the efforts he made to reconcile his father and liis friend (1 Sam. xviii. 30, xix. 1-7, xx.). It is thought, from the confusion apparent in this part of the narrative, that a record of the real motives which provoked a rupture between the king and his son-in-law has not been preserved (Stade, Gesehichte, vol. i. pp. 240, 241). ^ 1 Sam. xxii. 20-23, xxiii. 6. For the use of the ephod by Abiathar for oracular purposes, cf. 1 Sam. xxiii. 9-12, xxx. 7, 8 ; the inquiry in 1 Sam. xxiii. 2-4 probably belongs to the same series, although neither Abiathar nor the ephod is mentioned.

sible only by rugged ascents, defied assault,
while extensive caves offered a safe hiding
place to those who were familiar with their
windings. One day the little band descended to the rescue of Keilah, which
they succeeded in wresting from the Philistines, but no sooner did they learn
that Saul was on his way to meet them than they took refuge in the south
of Judah, in the neighbourhood of Ziph and Maon, between the mountains
and the Dead Sea.^ Saul, already irritated by his rival’s successes, was still
more galled by being always on the point of capturing him, and yet always
seeing him slip from his grasp. On one afternoon, when the king had retired
into a cave for his siesta, he found himself at the mercy of his adversary ;
the latter, however, respected the sleep of his royal master, and contented
himself with cutting a piece off his mantle.^ On another occasion David, in
company with Abishai and Ahimelech the Hittite, took a lance and a pitcher
of water from the king’s bedside.'* The inhabitants of the country were not
all equally loyal to David’s cause; those of Ziph, whose meagre resources
were taxed to support his followers, plotted to deliver him up to the king,®

provisions, and brought it herself to the wanderers. David was as much
disarmed by her tact as by her beauty, and when she was left a widow he
married her. This union insured the support of the Calebite clan, the most
powerful in that part of the country, and policy as well as gratitude no doubt
suggested the alliance.^
Skirmishes were not as frequent between the king’s troops and the outlaws
as we might at first be inclined to believe, but if at times there was a truce
to hostilities, they never actually ceased, and the position became intolerable.
Encamped between his kinsman and the Philistines, David found himself
unable to resist either party except by making friends with the other. An
incursion of the Philistines near Maon^ saved David from the king, but when
Saul had repulsed it, David had no choice but to throw himself into the arms
of Achish, King of Gath, of whom he craved permission to settle as his vassal
at Ziklag, on condition of David’s defending the frontier against the Bedawin.a
Saul did not deem it advisable to try and dislodge him from this retreat. Peace
having been re-established in Judah, the king turned northward and occupied
the heights which bound the plain of Jezreel to the east; it is possible that he
contemplated pushing further afield, and rallying round him those northern
tribes who had hitherto never acknowledged his authority. He may, on the
other hand, have desired merely to lay hands on the Syrian highways, and
divert to his own profit the resources brought by the caravans which plied
along them.^ The Philistines, who had been nearly ruined by the loss of the
right to demand toll of these merchants, assembled the contingents of their
five principalities, among them being the Hebrews of David, who formed the
personal guard of Achish. The four other princes objected to the presence
of these strangers in their midst, and forced Achish to dismiss them. David
returned to Ziklag, to find ruin and desolation everywhere. The Amalekites
had taken advantage of the departure of the Hebrews to revenge themselves
once for all for David’s former raids on them, and they had burnt the town,
carrying off the women and flocks. David at once set out on their track, over
took them just beyond the torrent of Besor, and rescued from them, not only his
own belongings, but all the booty they had collected by the way in the southern
provinces of Caleb, in Judah, and in the Cherethite plain. He distributed part
of this spoil among those cities of Judah which had shown hospitality to himself

Juive, pp. 313-315. Saul must have taken this determination almost immediately after the flight of David to the Philistines ; indeed, Achish says to his fellow-kings, on the eve of the battle of Gilboa, that David had “been with me . . . these years ” (1 Sam. xxix. 3).

and his men, for instance, to Jattir, Aroer, Eshtemoa, Hormah, and Hebron.^
While he thus kept up friendly relations with those who might otherwise have
been tempted to forget him, Saul was making his last supreme effort against the
Philistines, but only to meet with failure. He had been successful in repulsing
them as long as he kept to the mountain districts, where the courage of his troops
made up for their lack of numbers and the inferiority of their arms ; but he
was imprudent enough to take up a position on the hillsides of Gilboa, whose
gentle slopes offered no hindrances to the operations of the heavy Philistine
battalions. They attacked the Israelites from the Shunem side, and swept
all before them. Jonathan perished in the conflict, together with his two
brothers, Malchi-shua and Abinadab ; Saul, who was wounded by an arrow,
begged his armour-bearer to take his life, but, on his persistently refusing, the
king killed himself with his own sword. The victorious Philistines cut off
his head and those of his sons, and placed their armour in the temple of
Ashtoreth,^ while their bodies, thus despoiled, were hung up outside the walls
of Bethshan, whose Canaanite inhabitants had made common cause with the
Philistines against Israel. The people of Jabesh-Gilead, who had never
forgotten how Saul had saved them from the Ammonites, hearing the news,
marched all night, rescued the mutilated remains, and brought them back

V.) cf. supra, p. 698, note 4 : it is possible that it was the temple at Gaza, Gaza being the chief of the Philistine towns.

to their own town, where they burned them, and buried the charred bones
under a tamarisk, fasting meanwhile seven days as a sign of mourningd
David afterwards disinterred these relics, and laid them in the burying-place
of the family of Kish at Zela, in Benjamin.^ The tragic end of their king
made a profound impression on the people. We read that, before entering on
his last battle, Saul was given over to gloomy forebodings : he had sought
counsel of Jahveh, but God “answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by
Urim, nor by prophets.” The aged Samuel had passed away at Ramah, and
had apparently never seen the king after the flight of David ;
^ Saul now
bethought himself of the prophet in his despair, and sought to recall him
from the tomb to obtain his counsel. The king had banished from the land
all wizards and fortune-tellers, but his servants brought him word that at
Endor there still remained a woman who could call up the dead. Saul dis
guised himself, and, accompanied by two of his retainers, went to find her; he
succeeded in overcoming her fear of punishment, and persuaded her to make
the evocation. “ Whom shall I bring up unto thee ? ” — “ Bring up Samuel.”
And when the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice, saying, “ Why
hast thou deceived me, for thou art Saul? ” And the king said unto her, “Be
not afraid, for what sawest thou ? ” —“ I saw gods ascending out of the earth.”
“What form is he of?”—“An old man cometh up, and he is covered with a
mantle.” Saul immediately recognised Samuel, and prostrated himself with his
face to the ground before him. The prophet, as inflexible after death as in
his lifetime, had no words of comfort for the God-forsaken man who had troubled
his repose. “ The Lord hath rent the kingdom out of thine hand, and given
it to thy neighbour, even to David, because thou obeyedst not the voice of the
Lord, . . . and to-morrow shalt thou and thy sons be with me. The Lord also
shall deliver the host of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”^ We learn,
also, how David, at Ziklag, on hearing the news of the disaster, had broken
into weeping, and had composed a lament, full of beauty, known as the “ Song
‘ 1 Sam. xxxi. It would seem that there were two narratives describing this war : in one, the Philistines encamped at Shuuem, and Saul occupied Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. xxviii. 4) ; in the other, the Philistines encamped at Aphek, and the Israelites ‘‘by the fountain which is in Jezreel” (1 Sam. xxix. 1). The first of these accounts is connected with the episode of the witch of Endor, the second with the sending away of David by Achish. The final catastrophe is in both narratives placed on Mount Gilboa, and Stade, Geseh. des Volkes Israel, vol. i. p. 255, has endeavoured to reconcile the two accounts by admitting that the battle was fought between Aphek and “ the fountain,” but that the final scene took place on the slopes of Gilboa. There are even two versions of the battle, one in 1 Sam. xxxi. and the other in 2 Sam. i. 6-10, where Saul does not kill himself, but begs an Amalekite to slay him ; many critics reject the second version. ^ 2 Sam. xxi. 12-14. ^ 1 Sam.

There is no reason why this scene should not be historical ; it was natural that Saul, like many an ancient general in similar circumstances, should seek to know the future by means of the occult sciences then in vogue.

as, for instance, the words attributed to Samuel —are of a later date.

“ Thy glory, 0 Israel, is slain upon thy high places ! How are the
mighty fallen! Tell it not in G-ath, publish it not in the streets of Ash
kelon ; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the
uncircumcised triumph ! Ye mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew nor
rain upon you, neither fields of offerings : for there the shield of the mighty
•was vilely cast away, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil ! From the
blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned
not back, the sword of Saul returned not empty. Saul and Jonathan were
lovely and pleasant in their lives, and in death they were not divided.” ^
The Philistines occupied in force the plain of Jezreel and the pass which
leads from it into the lowlands of Bethshan : the Israelites abandoned the
villages which they had occupied in these districts, and the gap between
the Hebrews of the north and those of the centre grew wider.^ The remnants
of Saul’s army sought shelter on the eastern bank of the Jordan, but found no
leader to reorganise them. The reverse sustained by the Israelitish champion
seemed, moreover, to prove the futility of trying to make a stand against the
invader, and even the uselessness of the monarchy itself : why, they might
have asked, burthen ourselves with a master, and patiently bear with his
exactions, if, when put to the test, he fails to discharge the duties for the
performance of which he was chosen ? And yet the advantages of a stable form
of government had been so manifest during the reign of Saul, that it never
for a moment occurred to his former subjects to revert to patriarchal institu
tions : the question which troubled- them was not whether they were to have
a king, but rather who was to fill the post. Saul had lelt a considerable
number of descendants behind him : ^ from these, Abner, the ablest of his
captains, chose Ishbaal, and set him on the throne to reign under his guidance.^

Jonathan left at least one son, Meribbaal (1 Chron. viii. 34, ix. 40, called Mephibosheth in 2 Sam. xxi. 7), and Merab had five sons by Adriel (2 Sam. xxi. 8). One of Saul’s concubines, Eizpah, daughter of Aiah, had borue him two sons, Ariuoni and Meribbaal (2 Sam. xxi. 8, where the name Meribbaal is changed into Mephibosheth) ; Abinadab, who fell with him in the fight at Mount Gilboa (1 Sam. xxxi. 2), whose mother’s name is not mentioned, was another son. •* Ishbaal was still a child when his father died : had he been old enough to bear arms, he would have taken a part in the battle of Gilboa with his brothers. The expressions used in the account of his elevation to the throne prove that he was a minor (2 Sam. ii. 8, 9) : the statement that he was forty years old when he began to reign would seem, therefore, to be an error (ii. 10).

position was still insecure ; Abner therefore installed Ishbaal at Mahanaim, in
the heart of the country of Gilead. The house of Jacob, including the tribe
of Benjamin, acknowledged him as king, but Judah held aloof. It had adopted
the same policy at the beginning of the previous reign, yet its earlier isola
tion had not prevented it from afterwards throwing in its lot witli the rest
of the nation. But at that time no leader had come forward from its own
ranks who was worthy to be reckoned among the mighty men of Israel ; now,
on the contrary, it had on its frontier a bold and resolute leader of its own
race. David lost no time in stepping into the place of those whose loss he
had bewailed. Their sudden removal, while it left him without a peer among
his own people, exposed him to the suspicion and underground machinations
of his foreign protectors ; he therefore quitted them and withdrew to Hebron,
where his fellow-countrymen hastened to proclaim him king.^ From that time
onwards the tendency of the Hebrew race was to drift apart into two distinct
bodies ; one of them, the house of Joseph, which called itself by the name of
Israel, took up its position in the north, on the banks of the Jordan; the
other, which is described as the house of Judah, in the south, between the
Dead Sea and the Shephelah. Abner endeavoured to suppress the rival
kingdom in its infancy: he brought Ishbaal to Gibeah and proposed to Joab,
who was in command of David’s army, that the conflict should be decided by
the somewhat novel expedient of pitting twelve of the house of Judah against
an equal number of the house of Benjamin. The champions of Judah are said
to have won the day, but the opjwsing forces did not abide by the result, and
the struggle still continued.^ An intrigue in the harem furnished a solution
of the difficulty. Saul had raised one of his wives of the second rank, named
Bizpah, to the post of favourite. Abner became enamoured of her and took
her. This was an insult to the royal house, and amounted to an act of open
usurpation : the wives of a sovereign could not legally belong to any but his
successor, and for any one to treat them as Abner had treated Kizpah, was
equivalent to his declaring himself the equal, and in a sense the rival, of his
master. Ishbaal keenly resented his minister’s conduct, and openly insulted
him. Abner made terms with David, won the northern tribes, including that
of Benjamin, over to his side, and when what seemed a propitious moment
had arrived made his way to Hebron with an escort of twenty men. He was
favourably received, and all kinds of promises were made him ; but when he
was about to depart again in order to complete the negotiations with the
disaffected elders, Joab, returning from an expedition, led him aside into a
gateway and slew him. David gave him solemn burial, and composed a lament
' 2 Sam. ii. 1-11. Very jirobably Abuer recognised the Philistine suzerainty as David had done, for the sake of jreace ; at any rate, we find no mention in Holy Writ of a war between Ishbaal and the Philistines. - 2 Sam, ii. 12-32, iii. 1.



DAVID DELIVERS ISRAEL FROM TEE PHILISTINE DOMINATION. 723
on the occasion, of which four verses have come down to us : having thus paid
tribute to the virtues of the deceased general, he lost no time in taking further
precautions to secure his power. The unfortunate king Ishbaal, deserted by
every one, was assassinated by two of his officers as he slept in the heat of the
day, and his head was carried to Hebron ; David again poured forth lamenta
tions, and ordered the traitors to be killedd There was now no obstacle between
him and the throne : the elders of the people met him at Hebron, poured oil
upon his head, and anointed him king over all the provinces which had obeyed
the rule of Saul in Gilead —Ephraim and Benjamin as well as Judah.^
As long as Ishbaal lived, and his dissensions with Judah assured their supre
macy, the Philistines were content to suspend hostilities : the news of his death,
and of the union effected between Israel and Judah, soon roused them from
this state of quiescence. As prince of the house of Caleb and vassal of the lord
of Gath, David had not been an object of any serious apprehension to them ; but
in his new character, as master of the dominions of Saul, David became at once
a dangerous rival, whom they must overthrow without delay, unless they were
willing to risk being ere long overthrown by him. They therefore made an attack
on Bethlehem with the choicest of their forces, and entrenched themselves there,
with the Canaanite city of Jebus as their base, so as to separate Judah entirely
from Benjamin, and cut off the little army quartered round Hebron from the
reinforcements which the central tribes would otherwise have sent to its aid,^
This move was carried out so quickly that David found himself practically
isolated from the rest of his kingdom, and had no course left open but to shut
himself up in Adullam, with his ordinary guard and the Judaean levies.^ The
whole district round about is intersected by a network of winding streams, and
abounds in rocky gorges, where a few determined men could successfully hold
their ground against the onset of a much more numerous body of troops. The
caves afford, as we know, almost impregnable refuges ; David had often hidden
' 2 Sam. iii. 1, 6-29, iv. ^ 2 Sam. V. 1-3 ; in 1 Chron. xi. 1-3, xii. 23-40, we find further details beyond those given in the Book of Samuel ; it seems probable, however, that the northern tribes may not have recognised David’s sovereignty at this time. ® The history of this war is given in 2 Sam. v. 17-25, where the test shows signs of having been much condensed. It is preceded by the account of the capture of Jerusalem, which some critics would like to transfer to chap, vi., following ver. 1 which leads up ta it. The events which followed are self-explanatory, if we assume, as I have done in the text, that the Philistines wished to detach Judah from Israel : at first (2 Sam. v. 17-21) David endeavours to release himself and etFect a juncture with Israel, as is proved by the relative positions assigned to the two opposing armies, the Philistines at Bethlehem, David in the cave of Adullam ; afterwards (2 Sam. v. 22-25) David has shaken himself free, has rejoined Israel, and is carrying on the struggle between Gibeah and Gezer. The incidents recounted in 2 Sam. xxi. 15-22, xxiii. 13-19, seem to refer almost exclusively to the earlier part of the war, at the time when the Hebrews were hemmed in in the neighbourhood of Adullam. ‘ The passage in 2 Sam. v. 17 simply states that David “ went down to the hold,” and gives no further details. This expression, following as it does the account of the taking of Jerusalem, would seem to refer to this town itself, and Eenan, Histoire du peuple d' Israel, vol. ii. pj). 17-23, 26-28, has thus interpreted it. It really refers to Adullam, as is shown by the passage in 2 Sam. xxiii. 13-17 (Stade, Geschichte des Volkes Israel, vol. i. p. 266, and note).



724 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
himself in them in the days when he fled before Saul, and now his soldiers
profited by the knowledge he possessed of them to elude the attacks of
the Philistines. He began a sort of guerilla warfare, in the conduct of
which he seems to have been without a rival, and harassed in endless skirmishes
his more heavily equipped adversaries. He did not spare himself, and freely
risked his own life ; but he was of small stature and not very powerful, so that
his spirit often outran his strength. On one occasion, when he had advanced
too far into the fray and was weary with striking, he ran great peril of being
killed by a gigantic Philistine : with difficulty Abishai succeeded in rescuing
him unharmed from the dangerous position into which he had ventured, and for
the future he was not allowed to run such risks on the field of battle.^ On
another occasion, when lying in the cave of Adullam, he began to feel a longing
for the cool waters of Bethlehem, and asked who would go down and fetch
him a draught from the well by the gates of the town. Three of his mighty
men, Joshebbasshebeth, Eleazar, and Shammah, broke through the host of the
Philistines and succeeded in bringing it; but he refused to drink tlie few
drops they had brought, and poured them out as a libation to Jehovah, saying,
“ Shall I drink the blood of men that went in jeopardy of their lives ? ” ^ Duels
between the bravest and stoutest champions of the two hosts were of frequent
occurrence. It was in an encounter of this kind that Elhanan the Bethlehemite
[or David] slew the giant Goliath at Gob.^ At length David succeeded in
breaking his way through the enemies’ lines in the valley of Rephaim, thus
forcing open the road to the north. Here he probably fell in with the
Israelitish contingent, and, thus reinforced, was at last in a position to give
battle in the open : he was again successful, and routing his foes pursued them
from Gibeon to Gezer.'* None of his victories, however, was of a sufficiently
decisive character to bring the struggle to an end : it dragged on year after year,
and when at last it did terminate, there was no question on either side of sub
mission or of tribute : ^ the Hebrews completely regained their independence,
but the Philistines do not seem to have lost any portion of their domain, and
apparently retained possession of all that they had previously held. But though
they suffered no loss of territory, their position Avas in reality much inferior to
' 2 Sam. xxi. 15-17. ^ 2 Sam. xxiii. 13-17 ; cf. 1 Ghron. xi. 15-19. Popular tradition furnishes many incidents of a similar type ; cf. Alexander in the desert of Gedrosia, Godfrey de Bouillon in Asia Minor, etc. For the conflicting accounts of the slaying of Goliath, and the etforts to reconcile them, see
p. 715, supra, and note 1 . —Tk.]
' The Hebrew text gives “ from Geba [or Gibeah] to Gezer ” (2 Sam. v. 25) ; the Septuagint, “ from
Gibeon to Gezer.” This latter reading [which is that of 1 Citron, xiv. 16 . — Tr.] is more in accordance with the geographical facts, and I have therefore adopted it. Jahveh had shown by a continual rustling in the leaves of the mulberry trees that lie was on David’s side. As to Elhanan, see p. 715, supra. In 2 Sam. viii. 1 we are told that David humiliated the Philistines, and took “ the bridle of the motlier city ” out of their hands, or, in other words, destroyed the supremacy which they had exercised over Israel ; he probably did no more than this, and failed to secure any part of their teriitory. Tlie passage in 1 Citron, xviii. 1, which attributes to him the conquest of Gatli and its dependencies, is probably an amplification of the somewhat obscure wording employed in 2 Sam. viii. 1.



CONSTITUTION OF THE HEBREW KINGDOM UNDER DAVID. 725
what it was before. Their control of the plain of Jezreel was lost to them for
ever, and with it the revenue which they had levied from passing caravans
the Hebrews transferred to themselves this right of their former masters,
and were so much the richer at their expense. To the five cities this was a
more damaging blow than twenty reverses would have been to Benjamin or
.Tudah. The military spirit had not died out among the Philistines, and they
were still capable of any action which did not require sustained effort ; but lack
of resources prevented them from entering on a campaign of any length, and
any chance they may at one time have had of exercising a dominant influence
in the affairs of Southern Syria had passed away. Under the restraining hand
of Egypt they returned to the rank of a second-rate power, just strong enough
to inspire its neighbours with respect, but too weak to extend its territory by
annexing that of others. Though they might still, at times, give David trouble
by contesting at intervals the possession of some outlying citadel, or by making
an occasional raid on one of the districts which lay close to the frontier, they
were no longer a permanent menace to the continued existence of his kingdom.
But was Judah strong enough to take their place, and set up in Southern
Syria a sovereign state, around which the whole fighting material of the
country might range itself vvith confidence ? The incidents of the last war
had clearly shown the disadvantages of its isolated position in regard to the
bulk of the nation. The gap between Ekron and the Jordan, which separated
it from Ephraim and Manasseh, had, at all costs, to be filled up, if a repetition
of the manoeuvre which so nearly cost David his throne at Adullam were to
be avoided. It is true that the Giheonites and their allies acknowledged the
sovereignty of Ephraim, and formed a sort of connecting link between the
tribes, but it was impossible to rely on their fidelity so long as they were
exposed to the attacks of the Jebusites in their rear : as soon therefore as David
found he had nothing more to fear from the Philistines, he turned his attention
to Jerusalem.^ This city stood on a dry and sterile limestone spur, separated on
three sides from the surrounding hills by two valleys of unequal length. That
of the Kedron, on the east, begins as a simple depression, but gradually
becomes deeper and narrower as it extends towards the south. About a mile
and a half from its commencement it is nothing more than a deep gorge, shut
in by precipitous rocks, which for some days after the winter rains is turned
into the bed of a torrent.^ During the remainder of the year a number of
* Tlie name Jerusalem occurs under the form Ursalimmu, or Urusalim, in the Tel el-Amarna tablets (cf. p. 131, note 3, supra). 8ion was the name of the citadel i^reserved by the Israelites after the capture of the place, and applied by them to the part of the city which contained the royal palace, and subsequently to the town itself. * The Kedron is called a nalial (2 Sam. xv. 23 ; 1 Kings ii. 37 ; Jer. xxxi. 40), i.e. a torrent which runs dry during the summer; in winter it was termed a brook, during the Greek epoch (1 Maec. xii. 37). Excavations show that the fall diminishes at the foot of the ancient walls, and that the bottom of the valley has risen nearly twelve yards.



726 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
springs, whicli well up at tlie bottom of the valley, furnish an unfailing supply
of water to the inhabitants of Gihon,^ Siloam,^ and Logel.^ The valley widens
out again near En-R6gel, and affords a channel to the Wady of the Children
of Hinnom, which bounds the plateau on the west. The intermediate space
has for a long time been nothing more than an undulating plain, at present
covered by the houses of modern Jerusalem. In ancient times it was traversed
by a depression in the ground, since filled up, which ran almost parallel with
the Kedron, and joined it near the Pool of Siloam.^ The ancient city of the
Jebusites stood on the summit of the headland which rises between these two
valleys, the town of Jebus itself being at the extremity, while the Millo lay
farther to the north on the hill of Sion, behind a ravine which ran down at
right angles into the valley of the Kedron.® An unfortified suburb had
gradually grown up on the lower ground to the west, and was connected by
a stairway cut in the rock ® with the upper city. This latter was surrounded
by ramparts with turrets, like those of the Canaanitish citadels which we
constantly find depicted on the Egyptian monuments. Its natural advantages
and efficient garrison had so far enabled it to repel all the attacks of its
enemies. When David appeared with his troops, the inhabitants ridiculed his
presumption, and were good enough to w'arn him of the hopelessness of his
enterprise: a garrison composed of the halt and the blind, without an able
bodied man amongst them, would, they declared, be able successfully to resist
him. The king, stung by their mockery, made a promise to his “ mighty men ”
that the first of them to scale the walls should be made chief and ^captain
of his host. We often find that impregnable cities owe their dowmfall to
negligence on the part of their defenders : these concentrate their whole
attention on the few vulnerable points, and give but scanty care to those
which are regarded as inaccessible.'^ Jerusalem proved to be no exception to
this rule; Joab carried it by a sudden assault, and received as his reward the
best part of the territory which he had won by his valour.® In attacking
* Now, possibly, the “ Fountain of the Virgin,” but its identity is not certain. 2 These are the springs which feed the group of reservoirs now known as the Pool ofSiloam. The name “ Silnam ” occurs only in Neh. iii. 15, but is undoubtedly more ancient. ^ En-Rogel, the “Traveller’s Well,” is now called the “Well of Job.” * This valley, which is not mentioned by name in the Old Testament, was called, in the time o Josephus, the Tyropoeon, or Cheesemakers’ Quarter (Bell. Jud., V. iv. 1). Its true position, which had been only suspected up to the middle of the present century, was determined with certainty by means of the excavations carried out by the English and Germans. The bottom of the valley was found at a depth of from forty to sixty feet below the present surface. ^ As to the application of the name Millo to fortresses in general, see p. 693, note 2, supra. The name Moriah, borne by the hill on which the temple stands, belongs to a different category; it is a symbolical term employed in Gen. xxii. 2, and is applied by the writer of 2 Ghron. iii. 1 to the site of Solomon’s temple. “ This is the Ophel of the Hebrew text. ’ Cf. the capture of Sardis by Cyrus (Herodotus, I. Ixxxiv.) and by Antiochus III. (Polybius, vii. IT), as also the taking of the Capitol by the Gauls. * The account of the capture of Jerusalem is given in 2 Sam. v. 6-9, where the text is possibly



JERUSALEM BECOMES TEE CAPITAL OF TEE HEBREW EINCDOM. 727
Jerusaleoi, David’s first idea was probably to rid himself of one of the more
troublesome obstacles which served to separate one-half of his people from the
other ; hut once he had set foot in the place, he was not slow to jjerceive its
advantages, and determined to make it his residence. Hebron had suflSced so
long as his power extended over Caleb and Judah only. Situated as it was
in the heart of the mountains, and in the wealthiest part of the province in
which it stood, it seemed the natural centre to which the Kenites and men of
Judah must gravitate, and the point at which they might most readily be
moulded into a nation ; it was, however, too far to the south to offer a
convenient rallying-point for a ruler who wished to bring the Hebrew com
munities scattered about on both banks of the Jordan under the sway of
a common sceptre. Jerusalem, on the other hand, was close to the crossing
point of the roads which lead from the Sinaitic desert into Syria, and from the
Shephelah to the land of Gilead ; it commanded nearly the whole domain of
Israel and the ring of hostile races by which it was encircled. From this lofty
eyrie, David, with Judah behind him, could either swoop down upon Moab,
whose mountains shut him out from a view of the Dead Sea, or make a sudden
descent on the seaboard, by way of Bethhoron, at the least sign of disturb
ance among the Philistines, or could push straight on across Mount Ephraim
into Galilee. Issachar, Naphtali, Asher, Dan, and Zebulun were, perhaps,
a little too far from the seat of government; but they were secondary tribes,
incapable of any independent action, who obeyed without repugnance, but also
without enthusiasm, the soldier-king able to protect them from external foes.
The future master of Israel would be he who maintained his hold on the
posterity of Judah and of Joseph, and David could not hope to find a more
suitable place than Jerusalem from which to watch over the two ruling houses
at one and the same time.
The lower part of the town he gave up to the original inhabitants,^ the
upper he filled with Benjamites and men of Judah he built or restored a
royal palace on Mount Sion, in which he lived surrounded by his warriors and
his family.^ One thing only was lacking—a temple for his God. Jerubbaal had
had a sanctuary at Ophrah, and Saul had secured the services of Ahijah the
prophet of Shiloh : ^ David was no longer satisfied with the ephod which had
corrupt, with interpolated glosses, especially in ver. 8 ; David’s reply to the mockery of the Jebusites is difficult to understand. 1 Ghron. xi. 4-8 gives a more correct text, but one less complete in so far as the portions parallel with 2 Sam. v. 6-9 are concerned ; the details in regard to Joab are undoubtedly historical, but we do not find them in the Book of Samuel. ' Judges i. 21 ; cf. Zecli. xi. 7, where Ekron in its decadence is likened to the Jebusite vassal of Judah. * Jerusalem is sometimes assigned to Benjamin (Judges i. 21), sometimes to Judah (Josh. xv. 63). Judah alone is right. ’ 2 Sam. V. 9, and the parallel passage in 1 Chron. xi. 7, 8. * Cf. what is said in regard to the sanctuary of Jerubbaal on p. 692, supra, and in regard to the priesthood attached to the person of Saul, on p. 713 of the present work.

been the channel of many wise counsels during his years of adversity and his
struggles against the Philistines. He longed for some still more sacred object
with which to identify the fortunes of his people, and by which he might raise
the newly gained prestige of his capital. It so happened that the ark of the
Lord, the ancient safeguard of Ephraim, had been lying since the battle of
Eben-ezer not far away, without a fixed abode or regular worshippers^ The
reason why it had not brought victory on that occasion, was that God’s anger
had been stirred at the misdeeds committed in His name by the sons of Eli,
and desired to punish His people ; true, it had been preserved from profanation,,
and the miracles which took place in its neighbourhood proved that it was still
the seat of a supernatural power. At first the Philistines had, according tO'
their custom, shut it up in the temple of Dagon at Ashdod. On the morrow,
when the priests entered the sanctuary, they found the statue of their god
prostrate in front of it, his fish-like body overthrown, and his head and hands
scattered on the floor at the same time a plague of malignant tumours broke
out among the people, and thousands of mice overran their houses. The
inhabitants of Ashdod made haste to transfer the ark to Gath ; from Gath it
was passed on to Ekron : it thus went the round of the five cities, its arrival
being in each case accompanied by the same disasters. The soothsayers, being
consulted at the end of seven months, ordered that solemn sacrifices should be
offered up, and the ark restored to its rightful worshippers, accompanied by
expiatory offerings of five golden mice and five golden tumours, one for each of
the five repentant cities.^ The ark was placed on a new cart, and two milch,
cows with their calves drew it, lowing all the way, without guidance from any
man, to the field of a certain Joshua at Bethshemesh. The inhabitants welcomed'
it with great joy, but their curiosity overcame their reverence, and they looked
w'ithin the shrine. Jehovah, being angered thereat, smote seventy men of'
them, and the warriors made haste to bring the ark to Kirjath-jearim, where it
remained for a long time, in the house of Abinadab on the hill, under charge
of his son EleazaiA Kirjath-jearim is only about two leagues from Jerusalem.
' The account of the events which followed the battle of Eben-ezer up to its arrival in the house of Abinadab, is taken from the history of the ark, referred to on pp. 700, 707, supra. It is given in. 1 Sam. V., vi., vii. 1, where it forms an exceedingly characteristic whole, composed, it may be, of twoseparate versions thrown into one ; the passage in 1 Sam. vi. 15, where the Levites receive the ark, is supposed by some to be interpolated. The statue here referred to is evidently similar to those of the Chaldsean gods and genii (cf. Masvero, Dawn of Civilization, pp. 537, 517), in which Dagon is represented as a man with his back and head enveloped in a fish as in a cloak. ^ In the Oustinoff collection at Jaffa, there is a roughly shaped image of a mouse, cut out of a piece of white metal, and perhaps obtained from the ruins of Gaza ; it would seem to be an ex-voto of the same kind as that referred to in the Hebrew text, but it is of doubtful authenticity. See the reproduction on p. 729 of the present work. ‘ The text of 1 Sam. vi. 21, vii. 1, gives the reading Kirjath-jearim, whereas the text of 2 Sam.



THE ABE OF GOD AT JERUSALEM. 729
David himself went thither, and setting “ the ark of God upon a new cart,”
brought it away2 Two attendants, called Uzzah and Ahio, drove the new cart,
“ and David and all Israel played before God with all their might : even with
songs, and with harps, and with psalteries, and with timbrels, and with cymbals,
and with trumpets.” An accident leading to serious consequences brought
the procession to a standstill; the oxen stumbled, and their sacred burden
threatened to fall ; Uzzah, putting forth his hand to hold
the ark, was smitten by the Lord, “and there he died before
the Lord.” David was disturbed at this, feeling some
insecurity in dealing with a Deity who had thus seemed
to punish one of His worshippers for a well-meant and
respectful act. He “ was afraid of the Lord that day,”
and “would not remove the ark ” to Jerusalem, but left
it for three months in the house of a Philistine, Obed
Edom of Gath ; but finding that its host, instead of ex
periencing any evil, was blessed by the Lord, he carried

out his original intention, and brought the ark to Jeru
salem. “ David, girded with a linen ephod, danced with all his might before
the Lord,” and “ all the house of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with
shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet.” When the ark had been placed
in the tent that David had prepared for it, he offered up burnt offerings and
peace offerings, and at the end of the festival there were dealt out to the people
gifts of bread, cakes, and wine (or flesh). There is inserted in the narrative ^
an account of the conduct of Michal his wife, who, looking out of the window
and seeing the king dancing and playing, despised him in her heart, and when
David returned to his house congratulated him ironically—“ How glorious was
the King of Israel to-day, who uncovered himself in the eyes of the handmaids
of his servants ! ” David said in reply that he would rather be held in honour
by the handmaids of whom she had spoken than avoid the acts which covered
him with ridicule in her eyes ; and the chronicler adds that “ Michal the
daughter of Saul had no child unto the day of her death.” ^
vi. 2 has Baale-Judah, which should be corrected to Baal-Judah. Baal-Jiidah, or, in its abbreviated form, Baala, is another name for Kirjath-jearim (Jbs/j. xv. 9-11 ; cf. 1 Chron. xiii. 6). Similarly, we find the name Kirjath-Baal {Josh. xv. 60). Kirjath-jearim is now Kharbet-el-Enab. ' The transport of the ark from Kirjath-jearim to Jerusalem is related in 2 Sam. vi. and in 1 Chron. xiii., xv., xvi. ^ Drawn by Fancher-Gudin, from a sketch published by Schick and Oldfield Thomas, in the Palestine Exploration Fund, Quarterly Statement, 1893, p. 296; 1891, p. 189. ^ Renan, Histoire du peuple d’ Israel, vol. ii. pp. 57, 58, would consider this to have been inserted in the time of Hezekiah. It appeared to him to answer “ to the antipathy of Hamutal and the ladies of the court to the worship of Jahveh, and to that form of human respect which restrained the people of the world from giving themselves up to it.” ' [David’s reply shows (2 Sam. vi. 21,22) that it was in gratitude to Jehovah who had exalted him
that he thus humbled himself. — r.]



730 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
The tent and the ark were assigned at this time to the care of two priests
Zadok, son of Ahitub, and Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, who was a descendant
of Eli, and had never quitted David throughout his adventurous careerd It is
probable, too, that the ephod had not disappeared, and that it had its place in
the sanctuary ; but it may have gradually fallen into neglect, and may have
ceased to be the vehicle of oracular responses as in earlier years. The king
was accustomed on important occasions to take part in the sacred ceremonies,
after the example of contemporary monarchs, and he had beside him at this
time a priest of standing to guide him in the religious rites, and to fulfil for
him duties similar to those which the chief reader rendered to Pharaoh. The
only one of these priests of David whose name has come down to us was Ira
the Jethrite, who accompanied his master in his campaigns, and would seem to
have been a soldier also, aud one of “ the thirty.” These priestly officials seem,
however, to have played but a subordinate part, as history is almost silent about
their acts.'^ While David owed everything to the sword and trusted in it, he
recognised at the same time that he had obtained his crown from Jahveh ;
just as the sovereigns of Thebes and Nineveh saw in Amon and Assur the
source of their own royal authority. He consulted the Lord directly when he
wished for counsel, and accepted the issue as a test whether his interpretation of
the Divine will was correct or erroneous. When once he had realised, at the
time of the capture of Jerusalem, that God had chosen him to be the champion
of Israel, he spared no labour to accomplish the task which the Divine favour
had assigned to him. He attacked one after the other the peoples who had
encroached upon his domaiir, Moab being the first to feel the force of his arm.
He extended his possessions at the expense of Gilead, and the fertile provinces
opposite Jericho fell to his sword. These territories were in dangerous proximity
to Jerusalem, aud David doubtless realised the peril of their independence.
The struggle for their possession must have continued for some time, but the
details are not given, and we have only the record of a few incidental exploits :
we know, for instance, that the captain of David’s guard, Benaiah, slew two
Moabite notables in a battle.^ Moabite captives were treated with all the severity
sanctioned by the law^s of war. They were laid on the ground in a line, and
two-thirds of the length of the row being measured off, all within it were
pitilessly massacred, the rest having their lives spared. Moab acknowledged
' 2 Sam. viii. 17, xx. 25 ; cf. 1 Savi. xxi. 1, xxii. 20 ; 1 Chron. xv. 11. 2 Sam. XX. 20, where he is called the Jairite, and not the Ithrite, owing to an easily understood confusion of the Hebrew letters. He figures in the list of the Gibhorim, “ mighty men,” 2 Sam. xxiii. 38. ^ 2 Sam. xxiii. 20-23; cf. 1 Chrvn. xi. 22-25. “Ariel,” who is made the .father of the two slain by Heuaiah, may possibly be the term in 11. 12, 17, 18 of the Inscription of Mesha (Moabite Stone) ; but its meaning is obscure, and has hitherto baffled all attempts to explain it.



WARS AGAINST THE AMMONITES AND ABAM^ANS. 731
its defeat, and agreed to pay tribute : it had suffered so much that it required
several generations to recover^ Gilead had become detached from David’s
domain on the south, while the Ammonites were pressing it on the east, and the
Aramaeans making encroachments upon its pasture-lands on the north. Nahash,
King of the Ammonites, being dead, David, who had received help from him in
his struggle with Saul, sent messengers to offer congratulations to his son Hanun
on his accession. Hanun, supposing the messengers to be spies sent to examine
the defences of the city, “ shaved off one-half of their beards, and cut off their
garments in the middle, even to their buttocks, and sent them away.” This
was the signal for war. The Ammonites, foreseeing that David would
endeavour to take a terrible vengeance for this insult to his people, came to
an understanding with their neighbours. The overthrow of the Amorite chiefs
had favoured the expansion of the Aramaeans towards the south. They had
invaded all that region hitherto unconquered by Israel in the valley of the
Litany to the east of Jordan, and some half-dozen of tbeir petty states had
appropriated among them the greater part of the territories which were
described in the sacred record as having belonged previously to Jabin of Hazor
and the kings of Basban.^ The strongest of these principalities—that which
occupied the position of Qodshu in the Bekaa, and had Zoba as its capital
was at this time under the rule of Hadadezer, son of Rehob. This warrior had
conquered Damascus, Maacah, and Geshur, was threatening the Canaanite
town of Hamath, and was preparing to set out to the Euphrates when the
Ammonites sought his help and protection. He came immediately to their
succour. Joab, who was in command of David’s army, left a portion of his
troops at Eabbath under his brother Abishai, and with the rest set out against
the Syrians. He overthrew them, and returned immediately afterwards. The
Ammonites, hearing of his victory, disbanded their army ; but Joab had suffered
such serious losses, that he judged it wise to defer his attack upon them until
Zoba should be captured. David then took the field himself, crossed the Jordan
with all his reserves, attacked the Syrians at Helam, put them to flight, killing
Shobach, their general, and captured Damascus. Hadadezer [Hadarezer] “ made
peace with Israel,” and Tou or Toi, the King of Hamath, whom this victory had
delivered, sent presents to David. This was the work of a single campaign.
The next year Joab invested Rabbath, and when it was about to surrender he

The kingdom of Zoba, under Hadadezer, must, in fact, have extended southward to the frontiers of Ammon, but I think that the small state which formed its nucleus was in the valley of the Upper Oroutes and that of the Litany. Zoba must have taken the place of Qodshu, whose name is only incidentally mentioned in 2 Sam xxiv. 6, where the Hebrew gives Tahtem-h’odshi, and the LXX. (Lucian’s recension) Kedesh.

conquest which had baffled the efforts of all their predecessors—Canaanites,
Amorites, and Hittites ? The Assyrians, thrown back on the Tigris, were
at this time leading a sort of vegetative existence in obscurity ; and as
for Egypt, it would seem to have forgotten that it ever had possessions in
Asia. There was, therefore, nothing to be feared from foreign intervention should
the Hebrews be inclined to weld
into a single state the nations lying between the Euphrates and the Eed Sea.
Unfortunately, the Israelites had not the necessary characteristics of a con
quering people. Their history from the time of their entry into Canaan
showed, it is true, that they were by no means incapable of enthusiasm and
solidarity : a leader with the needful energy and good fortune to inspire
them with confidence could rouse them from their self-satisfied indolence, and
band them together for a great effort. But such concentration of purpose was
ephemeral in its nature, and disappeai’ed with the chief who had brought it
about. In his absence, or when the danger he had pointed out was no longer
imminent, they fell back instinctively into their usual state of apathy and
disorganisation. Their nomadic temperament, which two centuries of a
sedentary existence had not seriously modified, disposed them to give way to
tribal quarrels, to keep up hereditary vendettas, to break out into sudden
tumults, or to make pillaging expeditions into their neighbours’ territories.
Long wars, requiring the maintenance of a permanent army, the continual
levying of troops and taxes, and a prolonged effort to keep what they had

acquired, were repugnant to them. The kingdom which David had founded
owed its permanence to the stroug will of its originator, and its increase or
even its maintenance depended upon the absence of any internal disturbance
or court intrigue, to counteract -which might make too serious a drain upon
his energy. David had survived his last victory sufficiently long to witness
around him the evolution of plots, and the multiplication of the usual miseries
which sadden, in the East, the last years of a long reign. It was a matter
of custom as well as policy that an exaltation in the position of a ruler
should be accompanied by a proportional increase in the number of his retinue
and his wives. David was no exception to this custom : to the two wives,
Abigail and Ahinoam, which he had while he was in exile at Ziklag, he now
added Maacah the Aramaean, daughter of the King of Geshur, Haggith,
Abital, Eglah, and several others.^ During the siege of Eabbath-Ammon
he also committed adultery -with Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite,
and, placing her husband in the forefront of the battle, brought about his
death. Rebuked by the prophet Nathan for this crime, he expressed his peni
tence, but he continued at the same time to keep Bathsheba, by whom he
had several children.^ There was considerable rivalry among the progeny
of these difierent unions, as the right of succession would appear not to have
been definitely settled. Of the family of Saul, moreover, there were still several
members in existence—the son which he had by Eizpah, the children of his
daughter Merab, Merib-baal, the lame offspring of Jonathan,^ and Shimei,'*

all of whom had partisans among the tribes, and whose pretensions might
be pressed unexpectedly at a critical moment. The eldest son of Ahinoam,
Amnon, whose priority in age seemed likely to secure for him the crown,
had fallen in love with one of his half-sisters named Tamar, the daughter of
Maacah, and, instead of demanding her in marriage, procured her attendance
on him by a feigned illness, and forced her to accede to his desires. His
love was thereupon converted immediately into hate, and, instead of marrying
her, he had her expelled from his house by his servants. With rent garments
and ashes on her head, she fled to her full-brother Absalom. David was very
wroth, but he loved his firstborn, and could not permit himself to punish
him. Absalom kept his auger to himself, but when two years had elapsed

ABSALOM'S BEBELLION, 735
he invited Amnon to a banquet, killed him, and fled to his grandfather Talmai,
King of Geshurd His anger was now turned against the king for not having
taken up the cause of his sister, and he began to meditate his dethronement.
Having been recalled to Jerusalem at the instigation of Joab, “ Absalom
prepared him chariots and horses, and fifty men to run before him,” thus
affecting the outward forms of royalty. Judah, dissatisfied at the favour
shown by David to the other tribes, soon came to recognise Absalom as their
chief, and some of the most intimate counsellors of the aged king began
secretly to take his part. When Absalom deemed things safe for action, he
betook himself to Hebron, under the pretence of a vow which he had made
during his sojourn at Geshur. All Judah rallied around him, and the excite
ment at Jerusalem was so great that David judged it prudent to retire, with
his Philistine and Cherethite guards, to the other side of the Jordan. Absalom,
in the mean while, took up his abode in Jerusalem, where, having received the
tacit adherence of the family of Saul and of a number of the notables, he
made himself king. To show that the rupture between him and David was
complete, he had tents erected on the top of the house, and there, in view
of the people, took possession of his father’s harem. Success would have
been assured to him if he had promptly sent troops after the fugitives, but
while he was spending his time in inactivity and feasting, David collected
together those who were faithful to him, and put them under the command
of Joab and Abishai. The king’s veterans were more than a match for the
undisciplined rabble which opposed them, and in the action which followed
at Mahanaim Absalom was defeated : in his flight through the forest of
Ephraim he was caught in a tree, and before he could disentangle himself was pierced through the heart by Joab.^
David, we read, wished his people to have mercy on his son, and he wept
bitterly. He spared on this occasion the family of Saul, pardoned the tribe of
Judah, and went back triumphantly into Jerusalem, which a few days before had
taken part in his humiliation. The tribes of the house of Joseph had taken no
side in the quarrel. They were ignorant alike of the motives which set the tribe
of Judah against their own hero, and of their reasons for the zeal with which they
again established him on the throne. They sent delegates to inquire about this,
who reproached Judah for acting without their cognisance : “ We have ten
parts in the king, and we have also more right in David than ye : why then did
It is to be noted that Tamar asked Amnon to marry her, and that the sole reproach directed
against t e iog s eldest son was that, after forcing her, he was unwilling to make her his wife. Unions
of brotter and sister were probably as legitimate among the Hebrews at this time as among the
Egyptians (cf. Dawn of Civilization, pp. 50-62, 270, and supra, pp. 77, 78).

ye despise us, that our advice should not be first had in bringing back our
king?” Judah answered with yet fiercer words; then Sheba, a chief of the
Benjamites, losing patience, blew a trumpet, and went off crying : “ We have
no portion in David, neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse : every
man to his tents, O Israel.” If these words had produced an echo among
the central and northern tribes, a schism would have been inevitable : some
approved of them, while others took no action, and since Judah showed no
disposition to put its military forces into movement, the king had once again
to trust to Joab and the Philistine guards to repress the sedition. Their
appearance on the scene disconcerted the rebels, and Sheba retreated to the
northern frontier without offering battle. Perhaps he reckoned on the support
of the Aramaeans. He took shelter in the small stronghold of Abel of Beth
maacah, where he defended himself for some time ; but just when the place
was on the point of yielding, the inhabitants cut off Sheba’s head, and threw
it to J oab from the wall.^ His death brought the crisis to an end, and peace
reigned in Israel, Intrigues, however, began again more persistently than
ever over the inheritance which the two slain princes had failed to obtain.
The eldest son of the king was now Adonijah, son of Haggith, but Bathsheba
exercised an undisputed sway over her husband, and had prepared him to
recognise in Solomon her son the heir to the throne. She had secured, too,
as his adherents several persons of influence, including Zadok, the prophet
Nathan, and Benaiah, the captain of the foreign guard. Adonijah had on his
side Abiathar the priest, Joab, and the people of Jerusalem, who had been
captivated by his beauty and his regal display. In the midst of these rivalries
the king was daily becoming weaker : he was now very old, and although
he was covered with wrappings he could not maintain his animal heat.
A young girl was sought out for him to give him the needful warmth.
Abishag, a Shunammite, was secured for the purpose, but her beauty inspired
Adonijah with such a violent ijassion that he decided to bring matters to
a crisis. He invited his brethren, with the exception of Solomon, to a banquet
in the gardens which belonged to him in the south of Jerusalem, near the well
of Eogel. All his partisans were present, and, inspired by the good cheer, began
to cry, God save King Adonijah ! ” When Nathan informed Bathsheba of what
was going on, she went in unto the king, who was being attended on by Abishag,
complained to him of the weakness he was showing in regard to his eldest
son, and besought him to designate his heir officially. He collected together
the soldiers, and charged them to take the young man Solomon with royal
pomp from the hill of Sion to the source of the Gihon : Nathan anointed his

DEATH OF DAVID AND ACCESSION OF SOLOMON. 737
forehead with the sacred oil, and in the sight of all the people brought him
•to the palace, mounted on his father’s mule. The blare of the coronation
trumpets resounded in the ears of the conspirators, quickly followed by the
tidings that Solomon had been hailed king over the whole of Israel : they fled
on all sides, Adonijah taking refuge at the horns of the altar. David did not
long survive this event : shortly before his death he advised Solomon to rid
himself of all those who had opposed his accession to the throne. Solomon
did not hesitate to follow this counsel, and the beginning of his reign was
marked by a series of bloodthirsty executions. Adonijah was the first to
suffer. He had been unwise enough to ask the hand of Abishag in marriage :
this request was regarded as indicative of a hidden intention to rebel, and
furnished an excuse for his assassination. Abiathar, at whose instigation
Adonijah had acted, owed his escape from a similar fate to his priestly
-character and past services : he was banished to his estate at Anathoth, and
-Zadok became high priest in his stead. Joab, on learning the fate of his
accomplice, felt that he was a lost man, and vainly sought sanctuary near the
.ark of the Lord ; but Benaiah slew him there, and soon after, Shimei, the last
survivor of the race of Saul, was put to death on some transparent pretext.
This was the last act of the tragedy : henceforward Solomon, freed from all
those who bore him malice, was able to devote his whole attention to the cares
of government.^
The change of rulers had led, as usual, to insurrections among the
•tributary races : Damascus had revolted before the death of David, and had
.not been recovered. Hadad returned from Egypt, and having gained adherents
.in certain parts of Edom, resisted all attempts made to dislodge him.^
-As a soldier, Solomon was neither skilful nor fortunate : he even failed to
jetain what his father had won for him. Though he continued to increase
his army, it was more with a view to consolidating his power over the
Bne-Israel than for any aggressive action outside his borders. On the other
hand, he showed himself an excellent administrator, and did his best, by
various measures of general utility, to draw closer the ties which bound the
tribes to him and to each other. He repaired the citadels with such
means as he had at his disposal. He rebuilt the fortifications of Megiddo,
' 1 Kings i., ii. This is the close of the history of David, and follows on from 2 Sam. xxiv. It would seem that Adonijah was heir-apparent (1 Kings i. 5, 6), and that Solomon’s accession was 'brought about by an intrigue, which owed its success to the old king’s weakness (1 Kings i. 12, 13, 17, 18, 30, 31). 2 It seems clear from the context that the revolt of Damascus took place during David’s lifetime. It cannot, in any case, have occurred at a later date than the beginning of the reign of Solomon, for we are told that Kezon, after capturing the town, “ was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon ” (1 Kings xi. 23-25). Hadad returned from Egypt when “ he had heard that David slept with his fathers, and that Joab the captain of the host was dead” (1 Kings xi. 21, 22, 25).

thus securing the control of the network of roads which traversed Southern'
Syria. He remodelled the fortifications of Tamar, the two Bethhorons,
Baalatb, Hazor, and of many other towns which defended his frontiers.
Some of them he garrisoned with foot-soldiers, others with horsemen and
chariots. By thus distributing his military forces over the whole country,
be achieved a twofold object ;
^ he provided, on the one hand, additional
security from foreign invasion, and on the other diminished the risk of internal
revolt. The remnants of the old aboriginal clans, which had hitherto
managed to preserve their independence, mainly owing to the dissensions
among the Israelites, w'ere at last absorbed into the tribes in whose territory
they had settled. A few still held out, and only gave way after long and
stubborn resistance : before he could triumph over Gezer, Solomon was forced'
to humble himself before the Egyptian Pharaoh. He paid homage to him,
asked the hand of his daughter in marriage, and having obtained it, persuaded
him to come to his assistance : the Egyptian engineers placed their skill at
the service of the besiegers and soon brought the recalcitrant city to reason,,
lianding it over to Solomon in payment for his submission.^ The Canaanites
were obliged to submit to the poll-tax and the corvee the men of the league
of Gibeon were made hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of
the Lord.^ The Hebrews themselves bore their share in the expenses of the
State, and though less heavily taxed than the Canaanites, were, nevertheless,,
compelled to contribute considerable sums ; Judah alone was exempt, probably
because, being the private domain of the sovereign, its revenues were already
included in the royal exchequeiA In order to facilitate the collection of the
taxes, Solomon divided the kingdom into twelve districts, each of which was
placed in charge of a collector ; these regions did not coincide with the
existing tribal boundaries, but the extent of each was determined by the
wealth of the lands contained within it. While one district included the whole
of Mount Ephraim, another was limited to the stronghold of Mahanaim and
its suburbs. Mahanaim was at one time the capital of Israel, and had playedi
an important part in the life of David:® it held the key to the regions
' 1 Kings ix. 15, 17-19 ; cf. 2 Chrori. viii. 4-0. The parallel passage in 2 Chron. viii. 4, and the marginal variant in the Book of Kings, give the reading Tadnior Palmyra for Tamar, thus giving rise to the legends which state that Solomon’s frontier extended to the Euphrates. The Tamar here referred to is that mentioned in Ezek. xlvii. 19, xlviii. 28, as the southern boundary of Judah ; it is perhaps identical with the modern Kharbet-Kurnub. - 1 Kings ix. 16.

The annexation of the Gibeonites and their allies is placed at the time of the conquest in Josh. ix. 3-27 ; it should be rather fixed at the date of the loss of independence of the league, probably in the time of Solomon. ^ Stade, Geschichte des Volkes Israel, vol. i. p. 305, thinks that Judah was not exempt, and that the original document must have given thirteen districts. ® Cf. what is said in regard to the part played by Mahanaim under David on pp. 722-735, supra.

beyond Jordan, and its ruler was a person of sucb influence that it was not
considered prudent to leave him too well provided with funds. By thus
obliterating the old tribal boundaries, Solomon doubtless hoped to destroy,
or at any rate greatly weaken, that clannish spirit which showed itself with
such alarming violence at the time of the revolt of Sheba, and to weld into
a single homogeneous mass the various Hebrew and Canaanitish elements
of which the people of Israel were composed.^ Each of these provinces was
obliged, during one month in each year, to provide for the wants of “ the king
and his household,” or, in other words, the requirements of the central govern
ment. A large part of these contributions went to supply the king’s table ;
the daily consumption at the court was—thirty measures of fine flour, sixty
measures of meal, ten fat oxen, twenty oxen out of the pastures, a hundred
sheep, besides all kinds of game and fatted fowl : nor need we be surprised at
these figures, for in a country where, and at a time when money was unknown,
the king was obliged to supply food to all his dependents, the greater part
of their emoluments consisting of these payments in kind.^ The tax-collectors
had also to provide fodder for the horses reserved for military purposes :
there were forty thousand of these, and tAvelve thousand charioteers, and
barley and straw had to be forthcoming either in Jerusalem itself or in
one or other of the garrison towns amongst which they were distributed.^
The levying of tolls on caravans passing through the country completed the
king s fiscal operations which were based on the systems prevailing in neighbour
ing States, especially that of Egypt.^ Solomon, like other Oi’iental sovereigns,
reserved to himself the monopoly of certain imported articles, such as yarn,
chariots, and horses. Egyptian yarn, perhaps the finest produced in ancient
times, was in great request among the dyers and embroiderers of Asia.
Chariots, at once strong and light, were important articles of commerce at a time
when their use in warfare was universal. As for horses, the cities of the Delta
and Middle Egypt possessed a celebrated strain of stallions, from which the
Syrian princes were accustomed to obtain their war-steeds.® Solomon decreed
’ 1 Kings iv. 7-19, where a liat of the districts is given ; the fact that two of Solomon’s sons-inlaw appear in it, show that the document from which it is taken gave the staff of collectors in office at the close of his reign.
- 1 Kings iv. 22, 23, 27. ^ 1 Kings iv. 26-28; the complementary passages in 1 Kings x. 26 and 2 Chron. i. 14 give the
number of chariots as 1400 and of charioteers at 12,000. The numbers do not seem excessive for a
kingdom which embraced the whole south of Palestine, when we reflect that, at the battle of Qodshff
Northern Syria was able to put between 2500 and 3000 chariots into the field against Kamses II. (cf!
what has been said on this point on p. 392, supra). The Hebrew chariots probably carried at least
three men, like those of the Hittites and Assyrians (cf. pp. 217, 357, supra).
* 1 Kings x. 15, where mention is made of the amount which the chapmen brought, and the traffic
of the merchants contains an allusion to these tolls (Eeuss, Histoiredes Israelites, p. 458, n. 2),

terms in which the text, 1 Kings x. 27-29 (cf. 2 Chron. i. 16, 17), speaks of the trade in horses, show
that the traffic was already in existence when Solomon decided to embark in it.

that for the future lie was to be the sole intermediary between the Asiatics and
the foreign countries supplying their requirements. His agents went down at
regular intervals to the banks of the Nile to lay in stock ; the horses and
chariots, by the time they reached Jerusalem, cost him at the rate of six hundred
silver shekels for each chariot, and one hundred and fifty shekels for each horse,
but he sold them again at a profit to the Aramaean and Hittite princes. In return
he purchased from themCilician stallions, probably to sell again to the Egyptians,
whose relaxing climate necessitated a frequent introduction of new blood
into their stables.^ By these and other methods of which we know nothing
the yeai'ly revenue of the kingdom was largely increased : and though it only
reached a total which may seem insignificant in comparison with the enormous
quantities of the precious metals which passed through the hands of the
Pharaohs of that time, yet it must have seemed boundless wealth in the eyes
of the shepherds and husbandmen who formed the bulk of the Hebrew nation.
In thus developing his resources and turning them to good account,
Solomon derived great assistance from the Phoenicians of Tyre and Sidon,
a race whose services were always at the disposal of the masters of Southern
Syria. The continued success of the Hellenic colonists on the eastern shores
of the Mediterranean had compelled the Phoenicians to seek with redoubled
boldness and activity in the Western Mediterranean some sort of compensation
for the injury which their trade had thus suffered.^ They increased and con
solidated their dealings with Sicily, Africa, and Spain, and established them
selves throughout the whole of that misty region which extended beyond
the straits of Gibraltar on the European side, from the mouth of the Guadalete
to that of the Guadiana. This was the famous Tarshish—the Oriental
El Dorado. Here they had founded a number of new towns, the most
flourishing of which, Gadir,^ rose not far from the mouths of the Betis, on a
small islet separated from the mainland by a narrow arm of the sea. In this
city they constructed a temple to Melkarth, arsenals, warehouses, and ship
building yards : it was the Tyre of the west, and its merchant-vessels sailed
to the south and to the north to trade with the savage races of the African

and European seaboard. On the coast of Morocco they built Lixos, a town
almost as large as Gaclir, and beyond Lixos, thirty days’ sail southwards, a
whole host of depots, reckoned later on at three hundred. By exploiting
the materials to be obtained from these lands, such as gold, silver, tin, lead,
and copper. Tyre and Sidon were soon able to make good the losses they had
suffered from Greek privateersmen and marauding Philistines. Towards the
close of the reign of Saul over Israel, a certain king Abibaal had arisen in
Tyre, and was succeeded by his son Hiram, at the very moment when David was
engaged in bringing the whole of Israel into subjection. Hiram, guided by
instinct or by tradition, at once adopted a policy towards the rising dynasty
which his ancestors had always found successful in similar cases.^ He made
friendly overtures to the Hebrews, and constituted himself their broker and
general provider : when David was in want of wood for the house he was
building at Jerusalem, Hiram let him have the necessary quantity, and hired
out to him workmen and artists at a reasonable wage, to help him in turning
his materials to good account.^ The accession of Solomon was a piece of
good luck for him. The new king, born in the purple, did not share the
simple and somewhat rustic tastes of his father. He wanted palaces and
gardens and a temple, which might rival, even if only in a small way, the
palaces and temples of Egypt and Chaldaea, of which he had heard such
glowing accounts : Hiram undertook to procure these things for him at a
moderate cost, and it was doubtless his influence which led to those voyages
to the countries which produced precious metals, perfumes, rare animals, costly
woods, and all those foreign knicknacks with which Eastern monarchs of
all ages loved to surround themselves.^ The Phoenician sailors were well
acquainted with the bearings of Puanit, most of them having heard of this
country when in Egypt, a few perhaps having gone thither under the direc
tion and by the orders of Pharaoh : and Hiram took advantage of the access
which the Hebrews had gained to the shores of the Red Sea by the annexa
tion of Edom, to establish relations with these outlying districts without
having to pass the Egyptian customs. He lent to Solomon shipwrights and
sailors, who helped him to fit out a fleet at Ezion-geber, and undertook

at Deir el-Bahari2 Ou their return, after a three years’ absence, they reported
that they had sailed to a country named Ophir, and produced in support of
their statement a freight well calculated to convince the most sceptical,
consisting as it did of four hundred and twenty talents of gold. The success
of this first venture encouraged Solomon to
persevere in such expeditious : he sent his
fleet on several voyages to Ophir, and pro
cured from thence a rich harvest of gold
and silver, wood and ivory, apes and pea
cocks.^ Was the profit from these distant
cruises so very considerable after all ? After
they had ceased, memory may have thrown
a fanciful glamour over them, and
the treasures they had yielded to fabulous
proportions : we are told that Solomon would
have no drinking vessels or other utensils
save those of pure gold, and that in his days “silver was as stone,” so common
had it become.^ Doubtless Hiram took good care to obtain his full share of the
gains. The Phoenician king began to find Tyre too restricted for him, the
various islets over which it was scattered affording too small a space to support
the multitudes which flocked thither. He therefore filled up the channels
which separated them ; by means of embankments and fortified quays he
managed to reclaim from the sea a certain amount of laud on the south ;
after which he constructed two harbours—one ou the north, called the Sidonian;
the other on the south, named the Egyptian. He was perhaps also the
originator of the long causeway, the lower courses of which still serve as a
breakwater, by which he transformed the projecting headland between the
island and the mainland into a well-sheltered harbour. Finally, he set to work
on a task like that which he had already helped Solomon to accomplish : ^ he

Hebrews culminated under David.

had been amply sufficient for the wants of the little Jebusite town ; it was
wholly inadequate to meet the requirements of the growing population of the
capital of Judah. Solomon made better provision for its distribution than there
had been in the past, and then tapped a new source of supply some distance away,
in the direction of Bethlehem ; it is even said that he made the reservoirs for its
storage which still bear his name.^ Meanwhile, Hiram had drawn up for him plans
for a fortified residence, on a scale commensurate with the thriving fortunes of
his dynasty. The main body was constructed of stone from the Judaean quarries,
cut by masons from Byblos, but it was inlaid with cedar to such an extent that
one wing was called “the house of the forest of Lebanon.” It contained every
thing that was required for the comfort of an Eastern potentate—a harem, with
separate apartments for the favourites (one of which was probably decorated in
the Egyptian manner for the benefit of Pharaoh’s daughter) ;

with the abode of the temporal ruler of the nation. No monarch in those
days could regard his position as unassailable until he had a sanctuary and a
priesthood attached to his religion, either in his own palace or not far away
from it.® David had scarcely entered Jerusalem before he fixed upon the
threshing-floor of Araunah the Jebusite as a site for the temple, and built an
altar there to the Lord during a plague which threatened to decimate his
people ; but as he did not carry the project any farther,^ Solomon set him
self to complete the task which his father had merely sketched out. The site
was irregular in shape, and the surface did not naturally lend itself to the
purpose for which it was destined. His engineers, however, put this right by
constructing enormous piers for the foundations, which they built up from the
slopes of the mountain or from the bottom of the valley as circumstances
required : the space between this artificial casing and the solid rock was filled

work. Solomon had written to
him that he should command
“that they hew me cedar trees
out of Lebanon ; and my servants
shall be with thy servants ; and I
will give thee hire for thy servants
according to all that thou shalt
say; for thou knowest that there
is not among us any that can skill
to hew timber like unto the Zido
nians.” Hiram was delighted to
carry out the wishes of his royal
friend with regard to the cedar
and cypress woods. “ My servants,”
he answered, “ shall bring them
down from Lebanon unto the sea
and I will make them into rafts
to go by sea unto the place that
thou shalt appoint me, and will
cause them to be broken up there,
and thou shalt receive them ; and
thou shalt accomplish my desire,
in giving food for my household.” The payment agreed on, which was in
kind, consisted of twenty thousand hor of wheat, and twenty hor of pure
oil per annum, for which Hiram was to send to Jerusalem not only the
timber, but architects, masons, and Gebalite carpenters {i.e. from Byblos),
smelters, sculptors, and overseers.® Solomon undertook to supply the neces
sary labour, and for this purpose made a levy of men from all the tribes.
The number of these labourers was reckoned at thirty thousand, and they
were relieved regularly every three months ; seventy thousand were occu
pied in the transport of the materials, while eighty thousand cut the stones

exaggerated in popular estimation, since the greatest Egyptian monuments
never required such formidable levies of workmen for their construction ; we
must remember, however, that such an undertaking demanded a considerable
effort, as the Hebrews were quite unaccustomed to that kind of labour. The
front of the temple faced eastward ; it was twenty cubits wide, sixty long, and
thirty high. The walls were of enormous squared stones, and the ceilings and
frames of the doors of carved cedar, plated with gold ; it was entered by a
porch, between two columns of wrought bronze, which were called Jachin and
Boazd The interior contained only two chambers ; the heJail, or holy place,
where were kept the altar of incense, the seven-branched candlestick, and the
table of shewbread ; and the Holy of Holies dehir— where the ark of God
rested beneath the wings of two cherubim of gilded wood. Against the outer
wall of the temple, and rising to half its height, were rows of small apartments,
three stories high, in which were kept the treasures and vessels of the sanctuary.
While the high priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies only once a
year, the holy place was accessible at all times to the priests engaged in the
services, and it was there that the daily ceremonies of the temple-worship took
place ; there stood also the altar of incense and the table of shewbread. The
altar of sacrifice stood on the platform in front of the entrance ; it was a cube
of masonry with a parapet, and was approached by stone steps ; it resembled,
pDi’obably, in general outline the monumental altars which stood in the forecourts
of the Egyptian temples and palaces. There stood by it, as was also customary
in Chaldma, a “ molten sea,” and some ten smaller lavers, in which the Levites
washed the portions of the victims to be offered, together with the basins,
knives, fiesh-hooks, spoons, shovels, and other utensils required for the bloody
sacrifice. A low wall surmounted by a balustrade of cedar-wood separated
this sacred enclosure from a court to which the people were permitted to have
free access.^ Both palace and temple were probably designed in that pseudo
Egyptian style which the Phoenicians were known to affect.® The few
Hebrew edifices of which remains have come down to us, reveal a method of
construction and decoration common in Egypt ; we have an example of this in
' ] Kinqa vii. 15-22; cf. 2 Citron, iv. 11-13. Tlie names were probably engraved each upon its respective column, and taken together formed an inseription whicli could be interpreted in various ways.

Eenan, Hist, du pniple d’lsrael, vol. ii. pp. 143, 144). For a tentative restoration of these columns, cf. Pekrot-Chipiez, Hist, de VArt dam V Antiquik', vol. iv. pp. 314-327 ; we may, on the other hand, see in them merely an
equivalent of the Egyptian Stele-Pillars — as, for instance, those of tlie temple of Karnak, reproduced supra, p. 557. 1 Kings vi.-vii. ; cf. 2 Chron. iii., iv.

like that employed in the naos of the Phoenician temples. The completion of
the whole plan occupied thirteen years ; at length both palace and temple
were finished in the XVIP*' year of the kings reign. Solomon, however, did
not wait for the completion of the work to dedicate tlie sanctuary to God. As
soon as the inner court was
ready, which was in his
year, he proceeded to
transfer the arlv to its new
resting-place ; it was raised
upon a cubical base, and
the long staves by which
it had been carried were
left in their rings, as was
usual in the case of the
sacred barks of the Egyptian
deities.^ The God of Israel
thus took up His abode
in the place in which He
was henceforth to be honoured. The sacrifices on the occasion of the
dedication were innumerable, and continued for fourteen days, in the presence
of the representatives of all Israel. The ornate ceremonial and worship
which had long been lavished on the deities of rival nations were now, for
the first time, offered to the God of Israel. The devout Hebrews who had
come together from far and near returned to their respective tribes filled with
admiration,^ and their limited knowledge of art doubtless led them to consider
their temple as unique in the -world ; as a fact, it presented nothing remark
able either in proportion, arrangement, or in the variety and richness of its
ornamentation and furniture. Compared with the magnificent monuments of
Egypt and Chaldma, the work of Solomon was what the Hebrew kingdom
appears to us among the empires of the ancient world —a little temple suited
to a little people.

The priests to whose care it was entrusted did not differ much from those
whom David had gathered about him at the outset of the monarchy^ They
in no way formed an hereditary caste confined to the limits of a rigid hierarchy ;
they admitted into their number—at least up to a certain point—men of varied
extraction, who were either drawn by their own inclinations to the service of the
altar, or had been dedicated to it by their parents from childhood. He indeed
was truly a priest “ who said of his father and mother, ‘ I have not seen him ;
’
neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew he his own children.” He
was content, after renouncing these, to observe the law of God and keep His
covenant, and to teach Jacob His judgments and Israel His law ; he put
incense before the Lord, and whole burnt offerings upon His altar.^ As in
Egypt, the correct offering of the Jewish sacrifices was beset with considerable
difficulties, and the risk of marring their efficacy by the slightest inadvertence
necessitated the employment of men who were thoroughly instructed in the
divinely appointed practices and formulae. The victims had to be certified as
perfect, while the offerers themselves had to be ceremonially pure ; and, indeed,
those only who had been specially trained were able to master the difficulties
connected with the minutiae of legal purity. The means by which the future
was made known necessitated the intervention of skilful interpreters of the
Divine will. We know that in Egypt the statues of the gods were supposed
to answer the questions put to them by movements of the head or arms,
sometimes even by the living voice; but the Hebrews do not appear to have
been influenced by any such recollections in the use of their sacred oracles. We
are ignorant, however, of the manner in which the ephod was consulted, and we
know merely that the art of interrogating the Divine will by it demanded a
long noviciate.® The benefits derived by those initiated into these mysteries
were such as to cause them to desire the privileges to be perpetuated to their
children. Gathered round the ancient sanctuaries were certain families who,
from father to son, were devoted to the performance of the sacred rites, as, for
instance, that of Eli at Shiloh, and that of Jonathan-ben-Gershom at Dan,
near the sources of the Jordan;'* but, in addition to these, the text mentions
functionaries analogous to those found among the Canaanites, diviners, seers

-who had means of discovering that which was hidden from the vulgar.

^ These are the expressions used in the Blessing of Moses CDeut. xxxiii. 8-12); though this text is by some writers placed as late as the VIIB'‘ century b.c., yet the state ot things there represented would apply also to an earlier date. The Hebrew priest, in short, had the same duties as a large proportion of the priesthood in Chaldsea and Egypt.
’ An example of the consulting of the ephod will be found in 1 Sam. xxx. 7, 8, where David desires to know if he shall pursue the Amalekites. * Cf., for these two families, supra, 704, 70G, 707,713, 715, 730.

even to the finding of lost objects, but whose powers sometimes rose to a higher
level when they were suddenly possessed by the prophetic spirit and enabled
to reveal coming events. Besides these, again, were the prophets—wa&l ^
who lived either alone or in communities, and attained, by means of a strict
training, to a vision of the future. Their prophetic utterances were accom
panied by music and singing, and the exaltation of spirit which followed their
exercises would at times spread to the bystanders, as is the case in the “ zikr ”
of the Mahomedans of to-day.^ The early kings, Saul and David, used to have
recourse to individuals belonging to all these three classes, but the prophets,
owing to the intermittent character of their inspiration and their ministry,
could not fill a regular office attached to the court. One of this class was raised
up by God from time to time to warn or guide His servants, and then sank
again into obscurity ; the priests, on the contrary, were always at hand, and
their duties brought them into contact with the sovereign all the year round.
The god who was worshipped in the capital of the country and his priesthood
promptly acquired a predominant position in all Oriental monarchies, and most
of the other temples, together with the sacerdotal bodies attached to them,
usually fell into disrepute, leaving them supreme. If Amou of Thebes
became almost the sole god, and his priests the possessors of all Egypt, it
was because the accession of the XVIII*'' dynasty had made his pontiffs the
almoners of the Pharaoh.^ Something of the same sort took place in Israel
the priesthood at Jerusalem attached to the temple built by the sovereign,
being constantly about his person, soon surpassed their brethren in other parts
of the country both in influence and possessions. Under David’s reign their
head had been Abiathar, son of Ahimelech, a descendant of Eli,* but on
Solomon’s accession the primacy had been transferred to the line of Zadok.
In this alliance of the throne and the altar, it was natural at first that the
throne should reap the advantage. The king appears to have continued to
be a sort of high priest, and to have officiated at certain times and occasions.®
The priests kept the temple in order, and watched over the cleanliness of its
chambers and its vessels; they interrogated the Divine will for the king
according to the prescribed ceremonies, and offered sacrifices on behalf of

the monarch and his subjects ; in short, they were at first little more than
chaplains to the king and his family.
Solomon’s allegiance to the God of Israel did not lead him to proscribe
the worship of other gods ; be allowed his foreign wives the exercise of their
various religions, and he raised an altar to Chemosh on the Mount of Olives
for one of them who was a Moabite.^ The political supremacy and material
advantages which all these establishments acquired for Judah could not fail
to rouse the jealousy of the other tribes. Ephraim particularly looked on
with ill-concealed anger at the prospect of the hegemony becoming estab
lished in the hands of a tribe which could be barely said to have existed
before tbe time of David, and was to a considerable extent of barbarous
origin. Taxes, homage, the keeping up and recruiting of garrisons, were all
equally odious to this, as well as to the other clans descended from Joseph
meanwhile their burdens did not decrease. A new fortress had to be built at
Jerusalem by order of the aged king. One of the overseers appointed for this
work—Jeroboam, the son of Nebat—appears to have stirred up the popular
discontent, and to have hatched a revolutionary plot. Solomon, hearing of
the conspiracy, attempted to suppress it ; Jeroboam was forewarned, and fled
to Egypt, where Pharaoh Sheshonq received him with honour, aud gave him;
his wife’s sister in marriage.'^ The peace of the nation had not been ostensibly
troubled, but the very fact that a pretender should have risen up in opposition
to the legitimate king augured ill for the future of the dynasty. In reality,
the edifice which David had raised with such difficulty tottered on its founda
tions before the death of his successor ; the foreign vassals were either in a
restless state or ready to throw off their allegiance ; money was scarce, and
tw'enty Galilman towns bad been perforce ceded to Hiram to pay the debts due
to him for the building of the temple ;
^ murmurings were heard among the
people, who desired an easier life. In a future age, when priestly and prophetie
influences had gained the ascendant, amid the perils which assailed Jerusalem,
and the miseries of the exile, the Israelites, contrasting their humiliation with
the glory of the past, forgot the reproaches which their forefathers had addressed
to the house of David, and surrounded its memory with a halo of romance.
David again became the hero, and Solomon the saint and sage of his race ; the
latter “ spake three thousand proverbs ; and his songs were a thousand and
five. And he spake of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon even unto the
hyssop that springeth out of the wall : he spake also of beasts, and of fowl,

and of creeping things, and of fishes.”^ We are told that God favoured him
with a special predilection, and appeared to him on three separate occasions
once immediately after the death of David, to encourage him by the promise
of a prosperous reign, and the gift of wisdom in governing ; again after the
dedication of the temple, to confirm him in his pious intentions ; and lastly
to upbraid him for his idolatry, and to predict the downfall of his house.^
Solomon is supposed to have had continuous dealings with all the sovereigns of
the Oriental world,® and a Queen of Sheba is recorded as having come to bring
him gifts from the furthest corner of Arabia.^ His contemporaries, however,
seem to have regarded him as a tyrant who oppressed them with taxes, and
whose death was unregretted ® His son Eehoboam experienced no opposition
in Jerusalem and Judah on succeeding to the throne of his father; when,
however, he repaired to Shechem to receive the oath of allegiance from the
northern and central tribes, he found them unwilling to tender it except
under certain conditions ; they would consent to obey him only on the promise
of his delivering them from the forced labour which had been imposed upon
them by his predecessors. Jeroboam, who had returned from his Egyptian
exile on the news of Solomon’s death, undertook to represent their grievances
to the new king. “ Thy father made our yoke grievous : now therefore make
thou the grievous service of thy father, and his heavy yoke which he put
upon us, lighter, and we will serve thee.” Eehoboam demanded three days
for the consideration of his reply ; he took counsel with the old advisers of the
late king, who exhorted him to comply with the petition, but the young men
who were his habitual companions urged him, on the contrary, to meet the
remonstrances of his subjects with threats of still harsher exactions. Their
advice was taken, and when Jeroboam again presented himself, Eehoboam
greeted him with raillery and threats. “My little finger is thicker than my
father’s loins. And now whereas my father did lade you with a heavy yoke, I
will add to your yoke : my father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise
you with scorpions.” This unwise answer did not produce the intimidating
effect which was desired ; the cry of revolt, which had already been raised in
the earlier days of the monarchy, was once more heard. “ What portion have
we in David? neither have we inheritance in the son of Jesse: to your tents,
O Israel : now see to thine own house, David.” Eehoboam attempted to carry

his threats into execution, and sent the collectors of taxes among the rebels to
•enforce payment ; but one of them was stoned almost before his eyes, and the
king himself had barely time to regain his chariot and flee to Jerusalem to
escape an outburst of popular fury. The northern and central tribes imme
diately offered the crown to Jeroboam, and the partisans of the son of Solomon
were reduced to those of his own tribe; Judah, Caleb, the few remaining
Simeonites, and some of the towns of Dan and Benjamin, which were too near
to Jerusalem to escape the influence of a great city, were all who threw in
their lot with him.^
Thus was accomplished the downfall of the House of David, and with it the
Hebrew kingdom which it had been at such pains to build up. When we
consider the character of the two kings who formed its sole dynasty, we
-cannot refrain from thinking that it deserved a better fate. David and
Solomon exhibited that curious mixture of virtues and vices which distinguished
most of the great Semite princes. The former, a soldier of fortune and
an adventurous liero, represents the regular type of the founder of a dynasty
crafty, cruel, ungrateful, and dissolute, but at the same time brave, prudent,
cautious, generous, and capable of enthusiasm, clemency, and repentance
at once so lovable and so gentle that he was able to inspire those about
him with the firmest friendship and the most absolute devotion. The latter
was a religious though sensual monarch, fond of display—the type of
sovereign who usually succeeds to the head of the family and enjoys the
wealth which his predecessor had acquired, displaying before all men the
i-esults of an accomplished work, and often thereby endangering its stability.
The real reason of their failure to establish a durable monarchy was the fact that
neither of them understood the temperament of the people they were called
upon to govern. The few representations we possess of the Hebrews of this
period depict them as closely resembling the nations which inhabited Southern
Byria at the time of the Egyptian occupation. They belong to the type with
which the monuments have made us familiar ; they are distinguished by an
aquiline nose, projecting cheek-bones, and curly hair and beard. They were
vigorous, hardy, and inured to fatigue, but though they lacked those qualities
•of discipline and obedience which are the characteristics of true warrior races,
David had not hesitated to employ them in war ; they were neither sailors,

financial circumstances seemed for the moment to be favourable. The onward
progress of Assyria towards the Mediterranean bad been arrested by the
Hittites, Egypt was in a condition of lethargy, the Aramaean populations
were fretting away their energies in internal dissensions; David, having
encountered no serious opposition after his
victory over the Philistines, liad extended
his conquests and increased the area of his
kingdom, and the interested assistance which
Tyre afterwards gave to Solomon enabled the
latter to realise his dreams of luxury and royal
magnificence. But the kingdom which had been
created by David and Solomon rested solely on
their individual efforts, and its continuance
could be ensured only by bequeathing it to
descendants who had sufficient energy and pru
dence to consolidate its weaker elements, and
build up the tottering materials which were constantly threatening to fall
asunder. As soon as the government had passed into the hands of the
weakling Kehoboam, who had at the outset departed from his predecessors’
policy, the component parts of the kingdom, Avhich had for a few years been held
together, now became disintegrated without a shock, and as if by mutual
consent. The old order of things which existed in the time of the Judges had
passed away with the death of Saul. The advantages which ensued from a
monarchical regime were too apparent to permit of its being set aside, and the
tribes who had been bound together by nearly half a century of obedience to
a common master now resolved themselves, according to their geographical
positions, into two masses of unequal numbers and extent—Judah in the
south, together with the few clans who remained loyal to the kingly house,
and Israel in the north and the regions beyond Jordan, occupying three
fourths of the territory which had belonged to David and Solomon.
Israel, in spite of its extent and population, did not enjoy the predominant
position which we might have expected at the beginning of its independent
existence. It had no political unity, no capital in which to concentrate its
resources, no temple, and no army ; it represented the material out of which
a state could be formed rather than one already constituted. It was sub
divided into three groups, formerly independent of, and almost strangers to

each other, and between whom neither David nor Solomon had been able
to establish any bond which would enable them to forget their former isolation.
The centre group was composed of the House of Joseph—Ephraim, Ben
jamin, and Manasseh—and comprised the old fortresses of Perea, Mahanaim,
Penuel, Succoth, and Eamoth, ranged in a line running parallel with the
Jordan, In the eastern group were the semi-nomad tribes of Beuben and
Gad, who still persisted in the pastoral habits of their ancestors, and remained
indifferent to the various revolutions which had agitated their race for several
generations. Finally, in the northern group lay the smaller tribes of Asher,
Naphtali, Issachar, Zebulon, and Dan, hemmed in between the Phoenicians and
the Aramaeans of Zoba and Damascus. Each group had its own traditions,
its own interests often opposed to those of its neighbours, and its own peculiar
mode of life, which it had no intention of renouncing for any one else’s benefit.
The difficulty of keeping these groups together became at once apparent.
tShechem had been the first to revolt against Eehoboam ; it was a large and
populous town, situated almost in the centre of the newly formed state, and
the seat of an ancient oracle, both of which advantages seemed to single it out
as the future capital. But its very importance, and the memories of its former
greatness under Jerubbaal and Abimelech, were against it. Built in the western
territory belonging to Manasseh, the eastern and northern clans would at once
object to its being chosen, on the ground that it would humiliate them before
the House of Joseph, in the same manner as the selection of Jerusalem had
tended to make them subservient to Judah. Jeroboam would have endangered
his cause by fixing on it as his capital, and he therefore soon quitted it to
establish himself at Tirzah. It is true that the latter town was also situated
in the mountains of Ephraim, but it was so obscure and insignificant a place that
it disarmed all jealousy ; the new king therefore took up his residence in
it, since he was forced to fix on some royal abode, but it never became
for him what Jerusalem was to his rival, a capital at once religious and
military. He had his own sanctuary and priests at Tirzah, as was but
natural, but had he attempted to found a temple which would have attracted
the whole population to a common worship, he would have excited jealousies
which would have been fatal to his authority. On the other hand, Solomon’s
temple liad in its short period of existence not yet acquired such a prestige as
to prevent Jeroboam’s drawing his people away from it: which he determined
to do from a fear that contact with Jerusalem would endanger the allegiance of
his subjects to his person and family. Such concourses of worshippers, assem
bling at periodic intervals from all parts of the country, soon degenerated into
a kind of fair, in which commercial as well as religious motives had their part.
These gatherings formed a source of revenue to the prince in whose capital they

were held, and financial as well as political considerations required that periodical
assemblies should be established in Israel similar to those which attracted
Judah to Jerusalem. Jeroboam adopted a plan which while safeguai’ding
the interests of his treasury, prevented his becoming unpopular with his
own subjects ; as he was unable to have a temple for himself alone, he chose
two out of the most venerated ancient sanctuaries, that of Dan for the northern
tribes, and that of Bethel, on the Judaean frontier, for the tribes of the east
and centre. He made two calves of gold, one for each place, and said to the
people, “It is too much for you to go up to Jerusalem; behold thy gods, O
Israel, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.” He granted the
sanctuaries certain [appanages, and established a priesthood answering to that
which officiated in the rival kingdom : “ whosoever would he consecrated him,
that there might be priests of the high places.” ^ While Jeroboam thus
endeavoured to strengthen himself on the throne by adapting the monarchy
to the temperament of the tribes over which he ruled, Rehoboam took measures
to regain his lost ground and restore the unity which he himself had destroyed.
He recruited the army which had been somewhat neglected in the latter years
of bis father, restored the walls of the cities which had remained faithful to
him, and fortified the places which constituted his frontier defences against
the Israelites.® His ambition was not as foolish as we might be tempted to

imagine. He had soldiers, charioteers, generals, skilled in the art of war,
well-filled storehouses, the remnant of the wealth of Solomon, and, as a last
resource, the gold of the temple at Jerusalem. He ruled over the same
extent of territory as that possessed by David after the death of Saul, but
the means at his disposal were incontestably greater than those of his grand
father, and it is possible that he might in the end have overcome Jeroboam,
as David overcame Ishbosheth, had not the intervention of Egypt discon
certed his plans, and, by exhausting his material forces, struck a death-blow
to all bis hopes.
The century and a half which had elapsed since the death of the last of
the Ramessides had, as far as we can ascertain, been troubled by civil wai’S and
revolutions.^ The imperious Egypt of the Theban dynasties had passed away,
but a new Egypt had arisen, not without storm and struggle, in its place. As
long as the campaigns of the Pharaohs had been confined to the Nile valley
and the Oases, Thebes had been the natural centre of the kingdom ; placed
almost exactly between the Mediterranean and the southern frontier, it had
been both the national arsenal and the treasure-house to which all foreign
wealth had found its way from the Persian Gulf to the Sahara, and from the
coasts of Asia Minor to the equatorial swamps. The cities of the Delta, lying
on the frontier of those peoples with whom Egypt now held but little inter
course, possessed neither the authority nor the resources of Thebes ; even
Memphis, to which the prestige of her ancient dynasties still clung, occupied
but a secondary place beside her rival. The invasion of the shepherds, by
Kings, is given from an ancient source. The writer affirms, in harmony with the ideas of his time, “that the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and came to Judah and Jerusalem; for •Teroboam and his sons cast them off, that they should not execute the Priest’s office unto the Lord.” ' I have mentioued above, on p. 482, the uncertainty which still shrouds the XX‘’‘ dynasty. Tlie following is the order in whicli I proposed, eight years ago, that its kings should be placed (Les Momies royales de Deir el-Bahari, in the Me'inoires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. i. p. G62)

making the Thebaid the refuge and last bulwark of the Egyptian nation, increased
its importance : in the critical times of the struggle, Thebes was not merely
the foremost city in the country, it represented the country itself, and the
heart of Egypt may be said to have throbbed within its walls. The victories
of Ahmosis, the expeditions of Thutmosis I. and Thutmosis III., enlarged her
horizon ; her Pharaohs crossed the isthmus of Suez, they conquered Syria, sub
dued the valleys of the Euphrates and the Balikh, and by so doing increased
her wealth and her splendour. Her streets witnessed during two centuries
processions of barbarian prisoners laden with the spoils of conquest. But with
the advent of the XIX*‘^ and XX“* dynasties came anxious times ; the peoples of
Syria and Libya, long kept in servitude, at length rebelled, and the long distance
between Karnak and Gaza soon began to be irksome to princes who had to be
constantly on the alert on the Canaanite frontier, and who found it impossible
to have their head-quarters six hundred miles from the scene of hostilities.
Hence it came about that Kamses II., Minephtah, and Kamses III. all took
up their abode in the Delta during the greater part of their active life ; they
restored its ancient towns and founded new ones, which soon acquired con
siderable wealth by foreign commerce.^ The centre of government of the
empire, which, after the dissolution of the old Memphite state, had been re
moved southwards to Thebes on account of the conquest of Ethiopia and the
encroachment of Theban civilization upon Nubia and the Sudan, now gradually
returned northwards, and passing over Heliopolis, which had exercised a
transitory supremacy, at length established itself in the Delta. Tanis, Bubastis,
Sais, Mendes, and Sebennytos all disputed the honour of forming the royal
residence, and all in turn during the course of ages enjoyed the privilege
without ever rising to the rank of Thebes, or producing any sovereigns to be
compared with those of her triumphant dynasties. Tanis was, as we have seen,
the first of these to rule the whole of the Nile valley.^ Its prosperity had
continued to increase from the time that Eamses II. besran to rebuild it
the remaining inhabitants of Avaris, mingled with the natives of pure race
and the prisoners of war settled there, had furnished it with an active and
industrious population, which had considerably increased during the peaceful
reigns of the XX*'^ dynasty. The surrounding country, drained and cultivated
by unremitting efforts, became one of the most fruitful parts of the Delta
there was a large exportation of fish and corn, to which were soon added the
various products of its manufactories, such as linen and woollen stuffs,

ornament?, and objects in glass and in precious metalsd These were embarked
on Egyptian or Phoenician galleys, and were exchanged in the ports of the
IMediterranean for Syrian, Asiatic, or ^gean commodities, which were then
transmitted by the Egyptian merchants to the countries of the East and to
Northern Africa.^ The port of Tanis was one of the most secure and con
venient which existed at that period. It was at sufficient distance ' from the
coast to be safe from the sudden attacks of pirates,'^ and yet near enough to
permit of its being reached from the open by merchantmen in a few hours of
easy navigation ; the arms of the Nile, and the canals which here flowed into
the sea, were broad and deep, and, so long as they were kept well dredged,
would allow the heaviest-laden vessel of large draught to make its way
lip them with ease. The site of the town was not less advantageous for
overland traffic. Tanis was the first important station encountered by caravans
after crossing the frontier at Zalu,"* and it offered them a safe and convenient
emporium for tlie disjiosal of their goods in exchange for the riches of Egypt
and the Delta. The combination of so many advantageous features on one
site tended to the rapid development of both civic and individual wealth ;
in less than three centuries after its rebuilding by Ramses II., Tanis had
risen to a position which enabled its sovereigns to claim even the obedience of
Thebes itself.
We know very little of the history of this Tanite dynasty; the monuments
have not revealed the names of all its kings, and much difficulty is experienced
in establishing the sequence of those already brought to light.^ Their actual
domain barely extended as far as Siut, but their suzerainty was acknowledged
' The immense number of designs taken from aquatic plants, as, for instance, the papyrus and the lotus, single or in groups, as well as from fish and aquatic birds, which we observe on objects of Phoenician goldsmiths’ work, leads me to believe that the Tyrian and Sidonian artists borrowed most of their models from the Delta, and doubtless from Tanis, the most flourishing town of the Delta during the centuries following the downfall of Thebes. * It was from Tanis that the Egyptian vessel set out carrying the messengers of Hrihor to Dyblos ; cf. supra, pp. 582, 583.
’ We may judge of the security aftbrded by such a position by the account in Homer (Odyssey, xiv. 185-359) which Ulysses gives to Eumaios of his pretended voyage to Egypt ; the Greeks having disembarked, and being scattered over the country, were attacked by the Egyptians before they could capture a town or carry their booty to the ships. Cf., for these legends. Mallet, Les Premiers dtahlissements des Grecs en Egyjyte, p. 12, et seq. * For the eastern frontier of the Delta and the station at Zalu, cf. supra, pp. 122, 123. ‘ The classification of the Tanite line has been complicated in the minds of most Egyptologists by the tendency to ignore the existence of the sacerdotal dynasty of high priests, to confuse with the Tanite Pharaohs those of the high priests who bore the crown, and to identify in the lists of Manetho (more or less corrected) the names they are in search of. I have discussed the various systems proposed, even to those of Lepsius and Wiedemann, in the Mamies royales de Detr el-Bahari (Memoires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. i. p. 640, et seq.), and I have also endeavoured to show the contemporaneousness of the two families in a clearer way than has been hitherto done. Daressy has added uew facts to those I had already pointed out, but he has made the mistake of supposing Painotmu to
have been of the Tanite line (Contribution « V Etude de la XXP dynastie, in the Revue Arclic'ologique,



TEE RELATIONS OF TEE THEBANS WITH TEE TANITES. 759
by the Said as well as by all or part of Ethiopia,^ aud the Tanite Pharaohs
maintained their authority with such vigour, that they had it in their power on
several occasions to expel the high priests of Araon, and to restore, at least for
a time, the unity of the empire. To accomplish this, it would have been
sufiScient for them to have assumed the priestly dignity at Thebes, and this
was what no doubt took place at times when a vacancy in the high priesthood
occurred ; but it was merely in an interim, and the Tanite sovereigns always
relinquished the office, after a brief lapse of time, in favour of some member of
the family of Hrihor whose right of primogeniture entitled him to succeed to it.^
It indeed seemed as if custom and religious etiquette had made the tsvo offices
of the pontificate and the royal dignity incompatible for one individual to hold
simultaneously. The priestly duties had become marvellously complicated
during the Theban hegemony, and the minute observances which they entailed
absorbed the whole life of those who dedicated themselves to their perform
ance.® They had daily to fulfil a multitude of rites, distributed over the various
hours in such a manner that it seemed impossible to find leisure for any fresh
occupation without encroaching on the time allotted to absolute bodily needs.
The high priest rose each morning at an appointed hour ; he had certain times
for taking food, for recreation, for giving audience, for dispensing justice, for
attending to worldly affairs, and for relaxation with his wives and children
1896, vol. xxviii. pp. 72-90). A fresh examination of the subject has led me to adopt provisionally the following order for the series of Tanite kings :

The dynasty must have reigned about a hundred and forty years, from cir. 1080 to 940 b.c. ; but these, of course, are merely approximate dates. ' Cf. supra, p. 564. ^ This is only true if the personage who entitles himself once within a cartouche, “the Master of
the two lands. First Prophet of Amon, Psiukhannit ” (Wiedemann, Zur XXL Dynastie Manetho’s, in the Zeitschrift, 1888, p. 88; Maspeeo, Les Momies royales de Deir el-Bahari, in the M^moires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. i. pp. 679, 728), is really the Tanite king, and not the high priest Psiukhannit (cf. pp. 761, 762 of the present volume), as Daressy is inclined to think (^Contributions a I'histoire
de la XXB dynastie, p. 17). ’ The first book of Diodorus contains a picture of the life of the kings of Egypt (i. 70, 71), which, in common with much information contained in the work, is taken from a lost book of Hecatseus. The historical romance written by the latter appears to have been composed from information taken from Theban sources. The comparison of it with the inscribed monuments and the ritual of the ciiltus of Amon proves that the ideal description given in this work of the life of the kings, merely reproduces the chief characteristics of the lives of the Theban and Ethiopian high priests ; hence the greater part of the minute observances which we remark therein apply to the latter only, and not to the Pharaohs properly so called.



760 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS,
at night he kept watch, or rose at intervals to prepare for the various cere
monies which could only be celebrated at sunrise. He was responsible for the
superintendence of the priests of Amon in the numberless festivals held in honour
of the gods, from which he could not absent himself except for some legitimate
reason. From all this it will be seen how impossible it was for a lay king, like
the sovereign ruling at Tanis, to submit to such restraints beyond a certain
point ; his patience would soon have become exhausted, want of practice would
have led him to make slips or omissions, rendering the rites null and void ;
^
and the temporal affairs of his kingdom—internal administration, justice,
finance, commerce, and war—made such demands upon his time, that he was
obliged as soon as possible to find a substitute to fulfil his religious duties.
The force of circumstances therefore maintained the line of Theban high
priests side by side with their sovereigns, the Tanite kings. They were, it is
true, dangerous rivals, both on account of the wealtli of their fief and of the
immense prestige which they enjoyed in Egypt, Ethiopia, and in all the nomes
devoted to the worship of Amon.^ They were allied to the elder branch of
the Ramessides, and had thus inherited such near rights to the crown that
Smendes had not hesitated to concede to Hrihor the cartouches, the preamble,
and insignia of the Pharaoh, including the pschent and the iron helmet inlaid
with gold.^ This concession, however, liad been made as a personal favour, and
extended only to the lifetime of Hrihor, without holding good, as a matter
of course, for his successors; his son Pionkhi had to confine himself to The
])riestly titles,^ and las grandson Painotmu enjoyed the kingly privileges only
during part of his life,'' doubtless in consequence of his marriage with a certain
Makeri, probably daughter of Psiiikhaunit I., the Tanite king.® Makeri
apparently died soon after, and the discovery of her coffin in the hiding-place
at Deir el-13ahari reveals the fact of her death in giving -birth to a little
daughter who did not survive her, and who rests in the same coffin beside

* The only monument of this prince as yet known (Maspeko, Notes sur quelques points de Grammaire et d’ Histoire, in the Zeitschri/t, 1883, p. 62)give8 him merely the usual titles of the high priest, and the inscriptions of his son Painotmu I. style him “First Prophet of Amon.” His name should probably be read PaiOnukhi or Pionukhi, ratlier than Pionkhi or Piankhi. It is not unlikely that some of the papyri imblished by Sf)iegelberg date from his pontificate (Spiegelbekg, Correspondances du temps des rois-pretres, etc., pp. 10, 11). ^ Cf. the history of his protocol in Maspeko, Les Momies royales de Deir el-Bahari, in the M^moires de la Mission Franyaise, vol. i. p. 670, et seep P'or Makeri and the monuments remaining of her reign, see Wiedemann, Mgyptische Qescli., (I. 534, and Maspeko, Les Momies royales de Deir el-Baliari, in the Menoires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. i. pp. 577, 692-698.

The relationship of which he boasted was a distant one, but many of his
contemporaries who claimed to be of the line of Sesostris, and called them
selves “ royal sons of Ramses,” traced their descent from a far more remote
ancestor. The death of one high priest, or the appointment of his successor,
was often the occasion of disturbances ; the jealousies between his children by
the same or by different wives were as bitter as those which existed in the
palace of the Pharaohs, and the suzerain himself was obliged at times to inter
fere in order to restore peace. It was owing to an intervention of this kind that

If the “ Psihkhannit, High Priest of Ainon,” who once (to our knowledge) enclosed his name in a cartouche, is really a high priest, and not a king (cf. supra, p. 759, note 2), his case would be analogous to that of Manakhpirri. ’ Drawn by Faucher-Gudin, from a photograph by Emil Brugsch-Bey ; cf.

jManakhpirri was called on to replace his brother Masahirti. A section of the
Theban population had revolted, but the rising had been put down by the
Tanite Siamon, and its leaders banished to the Oasis ; Manakhpirri had there
upon been summoned to court and officially invested with the pontificate in
the XXV“^ year of the king’s reign. But on his return to Karnak, the new
high priest desired to heal old feuds, and at once recalled the exiles.^ Troubles
and disorders appeared to beset the Thebans, and, like the last of the Kamessides,
they were engaged in a perpetual struggle against robbers.^ The town, de
prived of its former influx of foreign spoil, became more and more impoverished,
and its population gradually dwindled. The necropolis suffered increasingly
from pillagers, and the burying-places of the kings were felt to be in such
danger, that the authorities, despairing of being able to protect them, with
drew the mummies from their resting-places. The bodies of Seti I., Kamses II.,
and Ramses III. were once more carried down the valley, and, after various
removals, were at length huddled together for safety in the tomb of Amenothes
I. at Drah-abu’I-Neggah.^
The Tanite Pharaohs seemed to have lacked neither courage nor good will.
The few monuments which they have left show that to some extent they carried
on the works begun by their predecessors. An unusually high inundation had
injured the temple at Karnak, the foundations had been denuded by the water,
and serious damage would have been done, had not the Avork of reparation
been immediately undertaken. Nsbindidi reopened the sandstone quarries
between Erment and Gebelein, from which Seti I. had obtained the building
materials for the temple, and drew from thence what was required for the repair
of the edifice.^ Two of the descendants of Xsbindidi, Psiukhannit I. and

Amenemopit, remodelled the little temple built by Klieops in honour of hi&
daughter Honitsonu, at the south-east angle of his pyramid.^ Both Siamon
miamon and Psiukhannit I. have left traces of their work at Memphis, and
the latter inserted his cartouches on two of the obelisks raised by Eamses at
Heliopolis.^ But these were only minor undertakings, and it is at Tanis that
we must seek the most characteristic examples of their activity. Here it
Avas that Psiukhannit rebuilt the brick ramparts which defended the city,
and decorated several of the halls of the great temple.^ The pylons of this
sanctuary had been merely begun by Sesostris : Siamon completed them, and
added the sphinxes ; and the metal plaques and small objects which he con
cealed under the base of one of the latter have been brought to light in the
course of excavations.* The appropriation of the monuments of other kings,
Avhich we have remarked under former dynasties, was also practised by the
Tanites. Siamon placed his inscriptions over those of the Eamessides,^ and
Psiukhannit engraved his name on the sphinxes and statues of Amenemhait III.
as unscrupulously as Apophis and the Hyksos had done before him.*’ The
Tanite sovereigns, however, were not at a loss for artists, and they had revived,
after the lapse of centuries, the traditions of the local school which had
flourished during the XIP*^ dynasty. One of the groups, executed by order of
Psiukhannit, has escaped destruction, and is now in the Gizeh Museum. It
represents two figures of the Nile, marching gravely shoulder to shoulder, and
’ From this temple came the fragments reproduced by Maeiette, Monuments divers, pi. 102 h, c ; cf. Maspero, Guide du Visiteur au Musee de Boulaq, p. 423, and the part of an inscription now at
Berlin (Lepsius, tJher die XXL Manethonisehe Konigsdynastie, in the Zeitschrift, 1882, p. 106). Manetho transcribes the name Amenemopit as Amenophtis, which supposes a variant Amenopiti, a form actually found on some private stelse ; the usual transcription of the Egyptian name Amenem
opit is Amenophis (Wiedejiann, Zur XXL Dynastie Manetho’s, in the Zeitschrift, 1882, pp. 86-88). but this form is most often erroneously used to transcribe Amenhotpu instead of Amenothes (cf. supra, p. 94, note 2). ^ Block from Memphis bearing the name of Siamon, in Brugsch’s Becueil de Monuments, vol. i. pi. iv., No. 3; obelisks from Alexandria now at London and New York, see Lepsius, op. cit, p. 104. The two cartouches of Siamon have been generally assigned to Hrihor, and were thought to represent the royal protocol of this king used outside Thebes, in Lower Egypt (Naville, Inscription historique de Pinodjem III., p. 16, et seq. ; Wiedemann, op. cit., p. 87, and AUgyptische Geschichte, p. 532 Maspero, Les Mornies royales de Detr el-Bahari, in the Metnoires de la Mission Frangaise, vol. i. p. 673). Daressy has shown that Siamon must certainly be distinguished from Hrihor, and has given him his
proper place after Amenemopit in the Tanite dynasty (^Contribution a Vetude de la XXP dynastie ^gyptienne, pp. 8-10, 16). ’ Lepsius, Denkm., iii. 255 d ; Flinders Petrie, Tanis, i. p. 28, and ii. p. 13.

THE LIBYAN MEECENARIES. 7G5
to rest content with small results, for though their battalions were sufficiently
numerous and well disciplined to overcome the Cauaanite chiefs, or even
the Israelite kingdom, it is to be doubted whether they were strong enough to
attack the troops of the Aramaean or Hittite princes, who had a highly organised
military system, modelled on that of Assyria. Egyptian arms and tactics had not
made much progress since the great campaigns of the Theban conquerors ; the
military authorities still complacently trusted to their chariots and their light
troops of archers at a period when the whole success of a campaign was decided
by heavily armed infantry, and when cavalry had already begun to change
the issue of battles. The decadence of the military spirit in Egypt had been
particularly marked in all classes under the later Eamessides, and the native
militia, without exception, were reduced to a mere rabble—courageous, it is
true, and able to sell their lives dearly when occasion demanded, rather than
give way before the enemy, but entirely lacking that enthusiasm and resolution
which sweep all obstacles before them. The chariotry had not degenerated in
the same way, thanks to the care with which the Pharaoh and his vassals kept
up the breeding of suitable horses in the training stables of the principal
towns. Egypt provided Solomon with draught-horses, and with strong yet
light chariots, which he sold with advantage to the sovereigns of the Orontes
and the Euphrates.^ But it was the mercenaries who constituted the most
active and effective section of the Pharaonic armies. These troops formed the
backbone on which all the other elements —chariots, spearmen, and native archers

were dependent. Their spirited attack carried the other troops with them,
and by a tremendous onslaught on the enemy at a decisive moment gave the
commanding general some chance of success against the better-equipped aud
better-organised battalions that he would be sure to meet with on the plains
of Asia. The Tanite kings enrolled these mercenaries in large numbers ; they
entrusted them with the garrisoning of the principal towns, and confirmed the
privileges which their chiefs had received from the Eamessides, but the results
of such a policy were not long in manifesting themselves, and this state of
affairs had been barely a century in existence before Egypt became a prey
to the barbarians.
It would perhaps be more correct to say that it had fallen a prey to the
Libyans only. The Asiatics and Europeans whom the Theban Pharaohs had
called in to fight for them had become merged in the bulk of the nation, or
had died out for lack of renewal. Semites abounded, it is true, in the eastern
nomes of the Delta, but their presence had no effect on the military strength
of the country. Some had settled in the towns and villages, and were engaged

Avith the inhabitants of the Nile valley, while their kinsmen of the older stock
betrayed the knowledge of their origin by such disparaging nicknames as Pa

constituted the body-guard of Ramses II., and whose commanders had, under
Ramses III., ranked with the great officers of the crown, had all but disappeared.®
It had been found difficult to recruit them since the dislodgment of the People
of the Sea from the Delta and the Syrian littoral, and their settlement in Italy
and the fabulous islands of the Mediterranean ;
^ the adventurers from Crete
and the ^Egean coasts uoav preferred to serve under the Philistines, Avhere
they found those who were akin to their own race, and from thence they passed
on to the Hebrews, where, under David and Solomon, they were gladly hired
as mercenaries.® The Libyans had replaced the Shardana in all the offices
they had filled and in all the garrison towns they had occupied. The kingdom
of Maraiu and Kapur had not survived the defeats Avhich it had suffered from
jMiuephtah and Ramses III.,® but the Mashatiasha Avho had founded it still
kept an active hegemony over their former subjects; hence it was that the
Egyptians became accustomed to look on all the Libyan tribes as branches of
the dominant race, and confounded all the immigrants from Libya under the
common name of Mashauasha.’ Egypt was thus slowly flooded by Libyans
' Jeroboam (1 Kings xi. 40, xii. 2, 3) and Hadad (1 Kings xi. 17-22) took refuge in this way at the court of Pharaoh ; cf. supra, pp. 737, 750. - On these descendants of tlie Hyksos, cf. supra, pji. 88, 89, 441, 442.

it was a gradual invasion, which succeeded by pacific means where brute force
had failed. A Berber population gradually took possession of the country,
occupying the eastern provinces of the Delta, filling its towns— Sais, Damanhur,
and Marea—making its way into the Fayum, the suburbs of Heracleopolis, and
penetrating as far south as Abydos ; at the latter place they were not found
in such great numbers, but still considerable enough to leave distinct tracesd

from their belts over their thighs, and an ostrich’s feather waves above their
curly hail’d They never abandoned this special head-dress and manner of
arming themselves, and they can always be recognised on the monuments by
the plumes surmounting their foreheadd Their settlement on the banks of
the Nile and intermarriage with the Egyptians had no deteriorating effect on
them, as had been the case with the Shardana, and they preserved nearly all
their national characteristics. If here and there some of them became
assimilated with the natives, there was always a constant influx of new comers,
full of energy and vigour, who kept the race from becoming enfeebled. The
attractions of high pay and the prospect of a free-and-easy life drew them to
the service of the feudal lords. The Pharaoh entrusted their chiefs with con
fldential ofiices about his person, and placed the royal princes at their head.
The position at length attained by these Mashauasha was analogous to that
of the Cossmans at Babylon, and, indeed, was merely the usual sequel of
permitting a foreign militia to surround an Oriental monarch ; they became
the masters of their sovereigns.® Some of their generals went so far as to
attempt to use the soldiery to overturn the native dynasty, and place them
selves upon the throne ; others sought to make and unmake kings to suit their
own taste. The earlier Tanite sovereigns had hoped to strengthen their
authority by trusting entirely to the fidelity and gratitude of their guard ; the
later kings became mere puppets in the hands of mercenaries. At length
a Libyan family arose who, while leaving the externals of power in the hands
of the native sovereigns, reserved to themselves the actual administration,
and reduced the kings to the condition of luxurious dependence enjoyed
by the elder branch of the Eamessides under the rule of the high priests
of Amon.

combine with his function of chief
of the Mashauasha several religious
offices, and his grandson, also called
Sheshonq, had a still more brilliant
careerd We learn from the monu

he had ascended the throne, he was
recognised as king and prince of
princes, and had conferred on him
the command of all the Libyan troops.
Officially he was the chief person in the state after
the sovereign, and had the privilege of holding
personal intercourse with the gods, Amonra included

a right which belonged exclusively to the Pharaoh and the Theban high
priest. The honours which he bestowed upon his dead ancestors were of a
remarkable character, and included the institution of a liturgical office in con
nection with his father Namaroti, a work which resembles in its sentiments the
devotions of Eamses II. to the memory of Seti.^ He succeeded in arranging a
marriage between his son Osorkon and a princess of the royal line, the daughter
nsitakibashiru.2

of Psiukhannit IL, by which alliance he secured the Tanite succession ;
^ he
obtained as a wife for his second son Auputi, the priestess of Amon, and thus
obtained an indirect influence over the Said and Nubia.^ This priestess was
probably a daughter or niece of Painotmu II., but we are unacquainted
with her name. The princesses continued to play a preponderating part in
the transmission of power, and we may assume that the lady in question was
one of those whose names have come down to us —Nsikhonsu, Nsitanibashiru,
or Isimkhobiu II., who brought with her as a dowry the Bubastite fief.
We are at a loss whether to place Auputi immediately after Painotmu,
or between the ephemeral pontificates of a certain Psiukhannit and a
certain Nsbindidi. His succession imposed a very onerous duty upon
him. Thebes was going through the agonies of famine and misery, and
no police supervision in the Avorld could secure the treasures stored up
in the tombs of a more prosperous age from the attacks of a famished
people. Arrests, trials, and punishments Avere ineffectual against the
violation of the sepulchres, and even the royal mummies—including
those placed in the chapel of Amenothes I. by previous high priests—were
not exempt from outrage. The remains of the most glorious of the Pharaohs
were reclining in this chapel, forming a sort of solemn parliament : here
was Saqnunri Tiuaqni, the last member of the XVIP'' dynasty; here also
were the first of the XVIIP*’ —Ahmosis, Amenothes I., and the three of
the name Thtitmosis, together with the favourites of their respective harems

Nofritari, Ahhotpu II., Anhapu, Honittimihu, and Sitkamosis ; and, in
addition, Kamses I., Seti I., Ramses II. of the XIX^'' dynasty, Ramses III.
and Ramses X. of the XX“‘ dynasty. The “ Servants of the True Place ” ^
were accustomed to celebrate at the appointed periods the necessary rites
established in their honour. Inspectors, appointed for the purpose by
the government, determined from time to time the identity of the royal
mummies, and examined into the condition of their wrappings and coffins :
after each inspection a report, giving the date and the name of the functionary
responsible for the examination, was inscribed on the linen or the lid
covering the bodies. The most of the mummies had suffered considerably
before they reached the refuge in Avhich they were found. The bodies of

and bundles of rags had been substituted for them, so arranged with
pieces of wood as to resemble human figures^ Ramses I., Ramses II., and
Thutmosis had been deprived of their original shells, and were found
in extemporised cases.^ Hrihor’s successors, who regarded these sovereigns
as their legitimate ancestors, had guarded them with watchful care, but
Auputi, who did not feel himself so closely related to these old-world
Pharaohs, considered, doubtless, this vigilance irksome, and determined to
locate the mummies in a spot where they would henceforward be secure from
all attack. A princess of the family of Manakhpirri —Isimkhobiu, it would
appear—had prepared a tomb for herself in the rocky cliff which bounds
the amphitheatre of Deir el-Bahaii on the south. The position lent itself
readily to concealment. It consisted of a well some 130 feet deep, with a
passage running out of it at right angles for a distance of some 200 feet
and ending in a low, oblong, roughly cut chamber, lacking both ornament
and paintings. Painotmu 11. had been placed within this chamber in the
XVI“* year of the reign of Psiukhannit II.,^ and several members of his
family had been placed beside him not long afterwards. Afiputi soon trans
ferred thither the batch of mummies which, in the chapel of Amenothes I.,
had been awaiting a more definite sepulture ; the cofiSns, with wliat remained
of their funerary furniture, were huddled together in disorder. The chamber

Sheshonq, by assuming the control of the Theban priesthood, did not on^
this account extend his sovereignty over Egypt beyond its southern portion,,
and that part of N’ubia which still depended on it. Ethiopia remained
probably outside his jurisdiction, and constituted from this time forward an
independent kingdom, under the rule of dynasties which were, or claimed to
be, descendants of Hrihor. The oasis, on the other hand, and the Libyan
provinces in the neighbourhood of the Delta and the sea, rendered obedience
to his officers, and furnished him with troops which were recognised as among
his best. Sheshonq found himself at the death of Psiukhannit II., which
took place about 910 b.c,, sole master of Egypt, with an effective army and
well-replenished treasury at his disposal. What better use could he make of
his resources than devote them to reasserting the traditional authority of his
country over Syria ? The intestine quarrels of the only state of any impor
tance in that region furnished him with an opportunity of which he found
it easy to take advantage. Solomon in his eyes was merely a crowned vassal
of Egypt, and his appeal for aid to subdue Gezer, his marriage with a daughter
of the Egyptian royal house, the position he had assigned her over all his
other wives, and all that we know of the relations between Jerusalem and
T’anis at the time, seem to indicate that the Hebrews themselves acknow
ledged some sort of dependency upon Egypt.^ They were not, however,
on this account free from suspicion in their suzerain’s eyes, who seized
upon every pretext that offered itself to cause them embarrassment. Hadad,
and Jeroboam afterwards, had been well received at the court of the Pharaoh,
and it was with Egyptian subsidies that these two rebels returned to their
country, the former in the lifetime of Solomon, and the latter after his death.®'
When Jeroboam saw that he was threatened by Kehoboam, he naturally
turned to his old protectors. Sheshonq had two problems before him. Should
he confirm by his intervention the division of the kingdom, which had flourished
in Kharu for now half a century, into two rival states, or should he himself
give way to the vulgar appetite for booty, and step in for his own exclusive
interest ? He invaded Judrea four years after the schism, and Jerusalem
offered no resistance to him; Eehoboam ransomed his capital by emptying
the royal treasuries and temple, rendering up even the golden shields which
Solomon was accustomed to assign to his guards when on duty about his person.^

Beth-horon, Ajalon, Jud-liammelek, Migdol, Jerza, Shoko, and the villages
of the Negeb. Each locality, in consequence of the cataloguing of obscure
towns, furnished enough material to cover two or even three of the crenellated
cartouches in which the names of the conquered peoples are enclosed, and
Sheshonq had thus the puerile satisfaction of parading before the eyes of
his subjects a longer cortege of defeated chiefs than that of his predecessor.^
His victorious career did not last long : he died shortly after, and his son
Osorkon was content to assume at a distance authority over the Kharu.^ It
does not appear, how'ever, that either the Philistines, or Judah, or Israel, or
any of the petty tribes w-hich had momentarily gravitated around David and
Solomon, were disposed to dispute Osorkon’s claim, theoretic rather than
real as it was. The sword of the stranger had finished the work which the
intestine quarrel of the tribes had begun. If Kehoboam had ever formed the
project of welding together the disintegrated elements of Israel, the taking
of Jerusalem must have been a death-blow to his hopes. His ai’senals were
empty, his treasury at low ebb, and the prestige purchased by David’s victories
was effaced by the humiliation of his own defeat. The ease with which the
edifice so laboriously constructed by the heroes of Benjamin and Judah
had been overturned at the first shock, was a proof that the new possessors
readily admissible, especially if any force were attached to the Greek text of 1 Kings xii. 24, which makes Jeroboam to have been a son-in-law of the King of Egypt” (Hist, dio peuple d' Israel, vol. ii. p. 200, note 2); the same view had been already expressed by Stade (Geschichte des Volhes Israels, vol. i. !>. 354) ; others, as, for instance, Niebuhr (Jlfe Clironologie der Gescli. Israels, jsp. viii., ix.) and Winckler (Geschichte Israels, vol. i. p. 160), have thought that Sheshonq had conquered the country for his ally Jeroboam. Sheshonq, in fact, was following the Egyptian custom by which all countries and towns which paid tribute to the Pharaoh, or who recognised his suzerainty, were made to, or might, figure on his triumphal lists whether they had been conquered or not : the presence of Megiddo or Mabanaim on the lists does not prove that they were conquered by Sheshonq, but that the prince to whom they owned allegiance was a tributary of the King of Egypt. The name of Jud-ham-melek, which occupies the twenty-ninth place on the list, was for a long time translated as Icing or kingdom of Judah, and passed for being a portrait of Kehoboam (Champollion, Lettres dcrites d’Fgypte, 2nd edit., pp. 99, 100 ; Eosellini, Mon. Storici, vol. ii. pp. 79, 80, vol. iv. pp. 158, 159; E. de Eouge, Mem. sur I’origine dgyptienne de Valphabet phdnicicn, p. 53), which is impossible. The Hebrew name was read by W. Max Muller (The supposed Name of Judah in the List of Sheshonq, in the Proceedings of the Bib. Arch. Soc., vol. x. pp. 81-83; cf. Lepage-Renouf, Remarks, ibid., pp. 83-86, and Asieii und Europa nach allagyptischeii Denkmdlern, p. 167) Jad-ham-melek, the hand, the fort of the king. It appears to me to be more easy to see in it Jud-ham-melek (Maspebo, La Liste de Sheshonq a Karnak, pp. 8, 9), and to associate it with Jehudah, a town of the tribe of Dan, as Brugsch did long ago (Geog. Inschr., vol. ii. i)p. 62, 63). ‘ The text of the list was published by Ciiami^olliox, Monuments, pis. cclxxviii.’, cclxxxiv., cclxxxv., and vol. ii. p. 113, et scq. ; by Rosellini, Mon.

Max Muller, Asien und Europa, pp. 166-172. - Champollion identified Osorkon 1. with the Zerah, who, according to 2 Chron. xiv. 9-15, xvi. 8, invaded Judah and was defeated by Asa (Precis du Systeme hie'roglyphique, 2ud edit., pp. 257 262 ; cf. Ewald, Gesch. des VolJces Israel, 2nd crlit., vol. iii. [i. 470), but this has no historic value, for it is clear that Osorkon never crossed the isthmus.



THE RISE OF THE TWO HEBREW KINGDOMS. 775
of Canaan were as little capable of barring the way to Egypt in lier old age,
as their predecessors had been when she was in her youth and vigour. The
Philistines had had their day ; it seemed by no means improbable at one time
that they were about to sweep everything before them, from the Negeb to the
Orontes, but their peculiar position iu the furthest angle of the country, and
their numerical weakness, prevented them from continuing their efforts for a
prolonged period, and they were at length obliged to renounce in favour of
the Hebrews their ambitious pretensions. The latter, who had been making
steady progress for some half a century, had been successful where the
Philistines had signally failed, and Southern Syria recognised their supremacy
for the space of two generations. We can only conjecture what they might
have done if a second David had led them into the valleys of the Orontes
and Euphrates. They were stronger in numbers than their possible opponents,
and their troops, strengthened by mercenary guards, would have perhaps
triumphed over the more skilled but fewer warriors which the Amorite and
Aramaean cities could throw into the field against them. The pacific reign of
Solomon, the schism among the tribes, and the Egyptian invasion furnished
evidence enough that they also were not destined to realise that solidarity
which alone could secure them against the great Oriental empires when
the day of attack came.
The two kingdoms were then enjoying an independent existence. Judah,
in spite of its smaller numbers and its recent disaster, was not far behind the
more extensive Israel in its resources. David, and afterwards Solomon, had so
kneaded together the various elements of which it was composed —Caleb,
Cain, Jerahmeel and the Judaean clans—that they had become a homogeneous
mass, grouped around the capital and its splendid sanctuary, and actuated
with feelings of profound admiration and strong fidelity for the family which
had made them what they were. Misfortune had not chilled their zeal :
they rallied round Eehoboam and his race with such a persistency that they
were enabled to maintain their ground when their richer rivals had squandered
their energies and fallen away before their eyes. Jeroboam, indeed, and his
successors had never obtained from their people more than a pi’ecarious
support and a lukewarm devotion : their authority was continually coming
into conflict with a tendency to disintegration among the tribes, and they
could only maintain their rule by the constant employment of force.
Jeroboam had collected tosrether from the gran’isons scattered throughout
the country the nucleus of an army, and had stationed the strongest of these
troops in his residence at Tirzah when he did not require them for some
expedition against Judah or the Philistines. His successors followed bis
example in this respect, but this military resource was only an ineffectual



776 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
protection against the dangers which beset them. The kings were literally
at the mercy of their guard, and their reign was entirely dependent
on its loyalty or caprice : any unscrupulous upstart might succeed in suborn
ing his comrades, and the stroke of a dagger might at any moment send
the sovereign to join his ancestors, while the successful rebel reigned in his
steadd The Egyptian troops had no sooner set out on their homeward march,
than the two kingdoms began to display their respective characteristics.
An implacable and truceless war broke out between them. The frontier
garrisons of the two nations fought with each other from one year’s end to
another— carrying off each other’s cattle, massacring one another, burning
each other’s villages and leading their inhabitants into slavery.^ From time
to time, when the situation became intolerable, one of the kings took the field
in person, and began operations by attacking such of his enemy’s strongholds
as gave him the most trouble at the time. Hamah acquired an unenviable
reputation in the course of these early conflicts : its position gave it command
of the roads terminating in Jerusalem, and when it fell into the hands of
Israel, the Judtean capital was blockaded on this side. The strife for its
possession was always of a terrible character, and the party which succeeded
in establishing itself firmly within it was deemed to have obtained a great
success.^ The encounter of the armies did not, however, seem to produce
much more serious results than those which followed the continual guerilla
warfare along the frontier : the conqueror had no sooner defeated his enemy
than he set to work to pillage the country in the vicinity, and, having accom
plished this, returned promptly to his head-quarters with the booty. Rehoboam,
who had seen something of the magnificence of Solomon, tried to perpetuate
the tradition of it in his court, as far as his slender revenues would permit
him. He had eighteen women in his harem, among whom figured some of
his aunts and cousins. The titular queen was Maacah, who was represented
as a daughter of Absalom. She was devoted to the asheras, and the king
was not behind his father in his tolerance of strange gods ; the high places
continued to b6 tolerated by him as sites of worship, and even Jerusalem
was not free from manifestations of such idolatry as was associated with the
old Canaauite religion. He reigned seventeen years, and was interred in the
' Among nineteen kings of Israel, eight were assassinated and were replaced by the captains of
their guards—Nadab, Elah, Ziinri, Joram, Zachariah, Shallum, Pekahiah, and Pekah. ^ This is what is meant by the Hebrew historians when they say ‘'there was war between Kehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life ” (1 Kings xv. G ; cf. 2 Cliron. xii. 15), and “between Abijam and Jeroboam” (1 Kings xv. 7; 2 Chro/i. xiii. 2), and “between Asa and Baasha ” (1 K^Tlg^ XV. 16, 32) “all their days.” ^ The campaign of Abijah at Mount Zemaraim (2 Chron. xiii. 3-19), in which the foundation of the narrative and the geographical details seem fully historical (Clermont-Gakneau, La Campagne d'Abyah contre .T^rohoam et Vemplacement de Yechdnah, in the Journal Asialique, 1877, vol. ix. p. 190, •et seq.). See also the campaign of Baasha against Ramah (1 Kings xv. 17-22 ; cf. 2 Chron. xvi. 1-6).

city of David ;
^ Abijam, the eldest son of Maacah, succeeded him, and followed
in his evil ways. Three years later Asa came to the throne,'^ no opposition
being raised to his accession. In Israel matters did not go so smoothly.
When Jeroboam, after a reign of twenty-two years, was succeeded by his
son Nadab, about the year 905 b.c., it was soon evident that the instinct
of loyalty to a particular dynasty had not yet laid any firm hold on the ten
tribes. The peace between the Philistines and Israel was quite as unstable as
that between Israel and Judah : an endless guerilla warfare was waged on the
frontier, Gibbethon being made to play much the same part in this region as
Ramah had done in regard to Jerusalem. For the moment it was in the
hands of the Philistines, and in the second year of his reign Nadab had gone
to lay siege to it in force, vvhen he was assassinated in his tent by one of his
captains, a certain Baasha, son of Ahijah, of the tribe of Issachar ; the soldiers
proclaimed the assassin king, and the people found themselves powerless to
reject the nominee of the army.^
Baasha pressed forward resolutely his campaign against Judah. He seized
Ramah and fortified it ; and Asa, feeling his incapacity to dislodge him
unaided, sought to secure an ally. Egypt was too much occupied with its own
internal dissensions to be able to render any effectual help, but a new power,
which would profit quite as much as Judah by the overthrow of Israel, was
beginning to assert itself in the north. Damascus had, so far, led an obscure
and peaceful existence ; it had given way before Egypt and Chaldaea whenever
the Egyptians or Chaldseans had appeared within striking distance, but had
refrained from taking any part in the disturbances by which Syria was torn
asunder. Having been occupied by the Amorites, it threw its lot in with theirs,
keeping, however, sedulously in the background : while the princes of Qodshu
waged war against the Pharaohs, undismayed by frequent reverses, Damascus
did not scruple to pay tribute to Thutmosis III. and his descendants, or to
enter into friendly relations with them.^ Meanwhile the Amorites had been
overthrown, and Qodshu, ruined by the Asiatic invasion, soon became little
more than an obscure third-rate town ; ® the Aramaeans made themselves masters

daughter of Absalom (xv. 10), which would seem to indicate that he was the brother and not the son
of Abijam. The uncertainty on this point is of long standing, for the author of Chronicles makes Abijam’s mother out in one place to be Micaiah, daughter of Uriel of Gibeali (xiii. 2), and in another (xi. 20) Maacah, daughter of Absalom. ^ 1 Kings xv. 27-31. * 1 Kings xv. 17 ; cf. 2 Chron. xvi. 1. ‘ As to the early history of Damascus, cf. p. 140, note 3, supra. ® Cf. pp. 466, 468-470, 475, 588-590, supra, for information in regard to the effects of the Asiatic invasion on Syria.

of Damascus about tbe XIP’' century, and in their hands it continued to be,
just as in the preceding epochs, a town without ambitions and of no great
renown. We have seen bow the Aramaeans, alarmed at the sudden rise of tbe
Hebrew dynasty, entered into a coalition against David with the Ammonite
leaders : Zoba aspired to the chief place among tbe nations of Central Syria,
but met with reverses, and its defeat delivered over to tbe Israelites its revolted
dependencies in the Hauran and its vicinity, such as Maacab, Gesbur, and even
Damascus itself.^ Their supremacy was, however, short-lived ; immediately
after tbe death of David, a chief named Rezon undertook to free them from
tbe yoke of the stranger. He had begun his military career under Hadadezer,
King of Zoba : when disaster overtook this leader and released him from his
allegiance, he collected an armed force and fought for his own hand. A lucky
stroke made him master of Damascus ; he proclaimed himself king there,
harassed the Israelites with impunity during the reign of Solomon, and took
over the possessions of the kings of Zoba in the valleys of the Litany and the
Orontes.^ The rupture between the houses of Israel and Judah removed the
only dangerous rival from his path, and Damascus became the paramount
power in Southern and Central Palestine. While Judah and Israel wasted
their strength in fratricidal struggles, Tabrimmon, and after him Benhadad
I., gradually extended their territory in Ccele-Syria ; ® they conquered Hamath,
and the desert valleys which extend north-eastward in the direction of the
Euphrates, and forced a number of the Hittite kings to render them homage.
They had concluded an alliance with Jeroboam as soon as he established his
separate kingdom, and maintained the treaty with his successors, Nadab and
Baasha. Asa collected all the gold and silver which was left in the temple of
Jerusalem and in his own palace, and sent it to Benhadad, saying, “ There is
a league between me and thee, between thy father and my father : behold, I
have sent unto thee a present of silver and gold ; go, break thy league with
Baasha, King of Israel, that he may depart from me.” It would seem that
Baasha, in his eagerness to complete the fortifications of Hamah, had left his
northern frontier undefended. Benhadad accepted the proposal and presents
of the King of Judah, invaded Galilee, seized the cities of Ijon, Dan, and Abel
beth-Maacab, which defended tbe upper readies of the Jordan and the Litany,
' Cf. what is said in regard to tlie.se events on pp. YiSI, 732, supra. * 1 Kings xi. 23-25; for the early history of Damascus, cf. Winckleu, Alttestamentliche Untersuchungen, p. 00, et seq., and Gesoliichte des Volhes Israel, vol. i. pp. 143, 144. The reading “Esron” in the Septuagiut (1 Kuigs xi. 23) indicates a form “ Khezron,” hy which it was sought to replace the traditional reading “ Rezon.” ® Hezion, wliom the Jewish writer intercalates before Tabrimmon (1 Kings xv. 18), is probably a corruption of Rezon ; Winckler, relying on the Septuagiut variants Azin or Azael (1 Kings xv. 18),
proposes to alter Hezion into Hazael, and inserts a certain Hazael I. in this place. Tabrimmon is only mentioned in 1 Kingsxv. 18, where ho is said to have been the father of Benhadad. As to these
personages, cf. Wincklek, AUtestameiitliche Untersucliungen, pp. G(l-ti5, who, to my mind, pushes his ingenious criticism a little too far.

the lowlands of Genesareth, and all the land of Naphtali. Baasha hastily
withdrew from Judah, made terms with Benhadad, and settled down in
Tirzah for the remainder of his reign ;
^ Asa demolished Eamah, and built
the strongholds of Gebah and Mizpah from its ruins.^ Benhadad retained
the territory he had acquired, and exercised a nominal sovereignty over the
two Hebrew kingdoms. Baasha, like Jeroboam, failed to found a lasting
dynasty; his son Elah met with the same fate at the hands of Zimrr
which he himself had meted out to Nadab. As on the former occasion, the
army was encamped before Gibbethon, in the country of the Philistines,
when the tragedy took place. Elah was at Tirzah, “ drinking himself
drunk in the house of Arza, which was over the household ;
” Zimri, whO'
was “ captain of half his chariots,” left his post at the front, and assassinated
him as he lay intoxicated. The whole family of Baasha perished in the sub
sequent confusion, but the assassin only survived by seven days the date of
his crime. When the troops whom he had left behiod him in camp heard of
what had occurred, they refused to accept him as king, and, choosing Orari in
his place, marched against Tirzah. Zimri, finding it was impossible either to
win them over to his side or defeat them, set fire to the palace, and perished
in the flames. His death did not, however, restore peace to Israel ; while one
half of the tribes approved the choice of the army, the other flocked to the
standard of Tibni, son of Ginath. War raged between the two factions for four
years, and was only ended by the death — whether natural or violent we do not
know—of Tibni and his brother Joram.® Two dynasties had thus arisen in
Israel, and had been swept away by revolutionary outbursts, while at Jerusalem
the descendants of David followed one another in unbroken succession. Asa
outlived Nadab by eleven years, and we hear nothing of his relations with the
neighbouring states during the latter part of his reign. We are merely told
that his zeal in the service of the Lord was greater than had been shown by
any of his predecessors. He threw down the idols, expelled their priests, and
persecuted all those who practised the ancient religions. His grandmother
Maacah “ had made an abominable image for an asberah ;
” he cut it down,
and burnt it in the valley of the Kedron, and deposed her from the supremacy
in the royal household which she had held for three generations. He is, there
fore, the first of the kings to receive favourable mention from the orthodox
chroniclers of later times, and it is stated that he “ did that which was right in
the eyes of the Lord, as did David his father.” ^

780 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES —DAMASCUS.
Omri proved a warlike monarch, and his reign, though not a long one, was
signalised by a decisive crisis in the fortunes of Israeli The northern tribes
had, so far, possessed no settled capital, Shechem, Penuel, and Tirzah having
served in turn as residences for the successors of Jeroboam and Baasha.
Latterly Tirzah had been accorded a preference over its rivals ; but Zimri had
burnt the castle there, and the ease with which it had been taken and retaken
was not calculated to reassure the head of the new dynasty. Omri turned his
attention to a site lying a little to the north-west of Shechem and Mount Ebal,
and at that time partly covered by the hamlet of Shomeron or Shimron—our
modern Samaria.^ His choice was a wise and judicious one, as the rapid
development of the city soon proved. It lay on the brow of a rounded hill,
which rose in the centre of a wide and deep depression, and was connected by
a narrow ridge with the surrounding mountains. The valley round it is fertile
and well watered, and the mountains are cultivated up to their summits
throughout the whole of Ephraim it would have been difficult to find a site
which could compare with it in strength or attractiveness.^ Ornri surrounded
his city with substantial ramparts ; he built a palace for himself, and a temple
in which was enthroned a golden calf similar to those at Dan and Bethel.^ A
population drawn from other nations besides the Israelites flocked into this
well-defended stronghold, and Samaria soon came to be for Israel what Jeru
salem already was for Judah, an almost impregnable fortress, in which the
sovereign entrenched himself, and round which the nation could rally in times
of danger. His contemporaries fully realised the importance of this move on
Omri’s part ; his name became inseparably connected in their minds with that
of Israel. Samaria and the house of Joseph were for them, henceforth, the
house of Omri, Bit-Omri, and the name still clung to them long after Omri

state of independence since the days of Solomon, to acknowledge his rule ; he
conquered the country of Medeba, vanquished Kamoshgad, King of Moab, and
imposed on him a heavy tribute in sheep and woold Against Benhadad in the
north-west he was less fortunate. He was forced to surrender to him several
of the cities of Gilead—among others Ramoth-gilead, which commanded the
fords over the Jabbok and Jordan.^ He even set apart a special quarter in
Samaria for the natives of Damascus, where they could ply their trades and
worship their gods without interference. It was a kind of semi-vassalage, from
which he was powerless to free himself unaided : he realised this, and looked
for help from without; he asked and obtained the hand of Jezebel, daughter
of Ethbaal, King of the Sidonians, for Ahab, his heir. Hiram L, the friend of
David, had carried the greatness of Tyre to its highest point after his
death, the same spirit of discord which divided the Hebrews made its appear
ance in Phoenicia. The royal power was not easily maintained over this race
of artisans and sailors : Baalbazer, son of Hiram, reigned for six years, and his
successor, Abdastart, was killed in a riot after a still briefer enjoyment of power.
We know how strong was the influence exercised by foster-mothers in the great
families of the East ; the four sons of Abdastart’s nurse assassinated their foster
brother, and the eldest of them usurped his crown. Supported by the motley
crowd of slaves and adventurers which filled the harbours of Phoenicia, they
managed to cling to power for twelve years. Their stupid and brutal methods
of government produced most disastrous results. A section of the aristocracy
emigrated to the colonies across the sea and incited them to rebellion ; had this

state of things lasted for any time, the Tyrian empire would have been doomed.
A revolution led to the removal of the usurper and the restoration of the
former dynasty, but did not bring back to the unfortunate city the tranquillity
which it sorely needed. The three surviving sons of Baalbezer, Methuastart,
Astarym, and Phelles followed one another on the throne in rapid succession,
the last-named perishing by the hand of his cou&in Ethbaal, after a reign of
eight months.^ So far, the Israelites had not attempted to take advantage of
these dissensions, but there was always the danger lest one of their kings, less
absorbed than his predecessors in the struggle with J udah, might be tempted
by the wealth of Phoenicia to lay hands on it. Ethbaal, therefore, eagerly
accepted the means of averting this danger by an alliance with the new dynasty
oftered to him by Omri.'-^ The presence of a Phoenician princess at Samaria
seems to have had a favourable effect on the city and its inhabitants. The
tribes of Northern and Central Palestine had, so far, resisted the march of
material civilization which, since the days of Solomon, had carried Judah
along with it ; they adhered, as a matter of principle, to the rude and simple
customs of their ancestors. Jezebel, who from her cradle had been accustomed
to all the luxuries and refinements of the Phoenician court, was by no means
prepared to dispense with them in her adopted country. By their contact with
her, the Israelites—at any rate, the upper and middle classes of them—acquired
a certain degree of polish ; the royal office assumed a more dignified exterior,
and approached more nearly the splendours of the other Syrian monarchies,
such as those of Damascus, Hamatli, Sidon, Tyre, and even Judah.
Uni'ortunately, the effect of this material progress was marred by a religious
difficulty. Jezebel had been brought up by her fatlier, the high priest of the
Sidonian Astarte, as a rigid believer in his faith,^ and she begged Ahab to
permit her to celebrate openly the worship of her national deities. Ere long
the Tyrian Baal was installed at Samaria nithhis asherah, and his votaries had
their temples and sacred groves to worship in : their priests and prophets sat
at the king’s table. Ahab did not reject the God of his ancestors in order to

AHAB AND THE PROPHETS. 783
embrace the religion of his wife—a reproach which was afterwards laid to his
door ; he remained faithful to Him, and gave the children whom he had by
Jezebel names compounded with that of Jahveh, such as Ahaziah, Joram, aud
AthaliahJ This was not the first instance of such tolerance in the history of
the Israelites ; Solomon had granted a similar liberty of conscience to all his
foreign wives, and neither Rehoboam ‘nor Abijam had opposed Maacah in her
devotion to the Canaanitish idols.^ But the times were changing, aud the altar
of Baal could no longer be placed side by side with that of Jahveh without
arousing fierce anger and inexorable hatred. Scarce a hundred years had
elapsed since the rupture between the tribes, and already one-half of the
people were unable to understand how place could be found in the breast of a
true Israelite for any other god but Jahveh : Jahveh alone was Lord, for none
of the deities worshipped by foreign races under human or animal shapes
could compare with Him in might and holiness. From this to the repudiation
of all those practices associated with exotic deities, such as the use of idols
of wood or metal, the anointing of isolated boulders or circles of rocks,
the offering up of prisoners or of the firstborn, was but a step : Asa had
already furnished an example of rigid devotion in Judah, aud there were many
in Israel who shared his views aud desired to imitate him. The opposition to
what was regarded as apostasy on the part of the king did not come from the
official priesthood ; the sanctuaries at Dan, at Bethel, at Shiloh, and at Gilgal
were prosperous in spite of Jezebel, and this was enough for them. But the
influence of the prophets had increased marvellously since the rupture between
the kingdoms, and at the very beginning of his reign Ahab was unwise enough
to outrage their sense of justice by one of his violent acts : in a transport of
rage he had slain a certain Naboth, who had refused to let him have his vine
yard in order that he might enlarge the grounds of the palace he was building
for himself at Jezreel.^ The prophets, as in former times,^ were divided into
schools, the head of each being called its father, the members bearing the title
of “ the sons of the prophets ;
” they dwelt in a sort of monastery, each having
his own cell, where they ate together, performed their devotional exercises or
assembled to listen to the exhortations of their chief prophets : ® nor did their

sacred ofBce prevent tliem from marryingd As a rule, they settled near one
of tlie temples, and lived there on excellent terms v.dth the members of the
regular priesthood. Accompanied by musical instruments, they chanted the
songs in which the poets of other days extolled the mighty deeds of Jahveh,
and obtained from this source the incidents of the semi-religious accounts which
they narrated concerning the early history of the people; or, when the spirit
moved them, they went about through the land prophesying, either singly, or
accompanied by a disciple, or in bands.^ The people thronged round them to
listen to their hymns or their stories of the heroic age : the great ones of the
land, even kings themselves, received visits from them, and endured their
reproaches or exhortations with mingled feelings of awe and terror. A few of
the prophets took the part of Ahab and Jezebel,^ but the majority declared
against them, and of these, the most conspicuous, by his forcibleness of speech
and action, was Elijah. We do not know of what race or family he came, nor
even what he was : ^ the incidents of his life which have come down to us seem
to be wrapped in a vague legendary grandeur. He appeal’s before Ahab, and
tells him that for years to come no rain or dew shall fall on the earth save by
his command, and then takes flight into tlie desert in order to escape the
king’s anger. He is there ministered unto by ravens, which bring him bread and
meat every night and morning. When the spring from which he drinks dries
up, he goes to the house of a widow at Zarephath in the country of Sidon, and
there he lives with his hostess for twelve months on a barrel of meal and a
cruse of oil which never fail. The widow’s son dies suddenly : he prays to
Jahveh and restores him to life ; then, still guided by an inspiration from above,
he again presents himself before the king. Ahab receives him without resent
ment, assembles the prophets of Baal, brings them face to face with Elijah on
the top of Mount Carmel, and orders them to put an end to the drought by
which his kingdom is wasted. The Phoenicians erect an altar and call upon
their Baalim with loud cries, and gash their arms and bodies with knives, yet
cannot bring about the miracle expected of them. Elijah, after mocking at
their cries and contortions, at last addresses a prayer to Jahveh, and fire comes

down from heaven and consumes the sacrifice in a moment ; the people,
convinced by the miracle, fall upon the idolaters and massacre them, and the
rain shortly afterwards falls in torrents. After this triumph he is said to have
fled once more for safety to the desert, and there on Horeb to have had a
divine vision. “ And, behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind
rent the mountains, and brake in pieces the rocks before the Lord ; but the
Lord was not in the wind : and after the wind an earthquake ; but the Lord
was not in the earthquake : and after the earthquake a fire ; but the Lord was
not in the fire : and after the fire a still small voice. And it was so, when
Elijah heard it, that he wrapped his face in his mantle, and went out, and stood
in the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him,
and said. What doest thou here, Elijah ? ” God then commanded him to
anoint Hazael as King of Syria, and Jehu, son of Nimshi, as King over Israel,
and Elisha, son of Shaphat, as prophet in his stead, “ and him that escapeth
from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu slay : and him that escapeth from the
sword of Jehu shall Elisha slay.” The sacred writings go on to tell us that
the prophet who had held such close converse with the Deity was exempt
from the ordinary laws of humanity, and was carried to heaven in a chariot of
fire. The account that has come down to us shows the impression of awe left
by Elijah on the spirit of his age.^
Ahab was one of the most warlike among the warrior-kings of Israel. He
ruled Moab with a strong hand,^ kept Judah in subjection,^ and in his conflict
with Damascus experienced alternately victory and honourable defeat. Ha
dadidri [Hadadezer], of whom the Hebrew historians make a second Benhadad,*
had succeeded the conqueror of Baasha.® The account of his campaigns in the
Hebrew records has only reached us in a seemingly condensed and distorted
condition. Israel, strengthened by the exploits of Omri, must have offered him
a strenuous resistance, but we know nothing of the causes, nor of the opening
scenes of the drama. When the curtain is lifted, the preliminary conflict is
* The story of Elijah is found in 1 Kings xvii.-xix., xxi. 17-29, and 2 Kings i., ii. 1-14. ’ Inscription of Meslia, 11. 7, 8. ’ The subordination of Judah is nowhere explicitly mentioned : it is inferred from the attitude adopted by Jehoshaphat in presence of Ahab (1 Kings xxii. l,et seq.). ‘ The Assyrian texts call this Dadidri, Adadidri, which exactly corresponds to the Hebrew form Hadadezer ; cf.'on this subject the contradictory articles by Schrader, Keilinschriften und Geschichtsforschung, p. 538, et seq., Keilinschriften und das Alte Testament, 2nd edit., p. 200, et seq., Die Namen Hadad, Hadadezer, Benhadad und ihre Keilinschriftliche Eguivalente, in the Zeitschrift fur Keilforschung, vol. ii. pp. 366-384, and by Fr. Delitzsch, Assyriologischen Notizen zum Alten Testament, II., der Name Benhadad, in the Zeitschrift fiir Keilforschung, vol. ii. pp. 161-178, the former upholding the reading Adarezer, Adadidri, the latter that of Bouridri, Biridri. * The information in the Book of Kings does not tell us at what time during the reign of Ahab his first wars with Hadadezer (Benhadad II.) and the siege of Samaria occurred. The rapid success of Shalmaneser’s campaigns against Damascus, between 854 and 839 B.C., does not allow us to place these events after the invasion of Assyria. Ahab appears, in 854, at the battle of Karkar, as the ally of Benhadad, as I shall show later. *

over, and the Israelites, closely besieged in Samaria, have no alternative before
them but unconditional surrender. This was the first serious attack the city
had sustained, and its resistance spoke well for the military foresight of its
founder. In Benhadad’s train were thirty-two kings, and horses and chariots
innumerable, while his adversary could only oppose to them seven thousand
men. Ahab was willing to treat, but the conditions proposed were so outrageous
that he broke off the negotiations. We do not know how long the blockade
had lasted, when one day the garrison made a sortie in full daylight, and fell
upon the Syrian camp ; the enemy were panic-stricken, and Benhadad with
difficulty escaped on horseback with a handful of men. He resumed hostilities
in the following year, but instead of engaging the enemy in the hill-country of
Ephraim, where his superior numbers brought him no advantage, he deployed
his lines on the plain of Jezreel, near the town of Aphek. His servants had
counselled him to change his tactics : “ The God of the Hebrews is a God of
the hills, therefore they were stronger than we ; but let us fight against them
in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they.” The advice, however,
proved futile, for he sustained on the open plain a still more severe defeat
than he had met with in the mountains, and the Hebrew historians affirm that
he was taken prisoner during the pursuit. The power of Damascus was still
formidable, and the cajitivity of its king had done little to bring the war to an
end ; Ahab, therefore, did not press his advantage, but received the Syrian
monarch “ as a brother,” and set him at liberty after concluding with him an
offensive and defensive alliance. Israel at this time recovered possession of some
of the cities which had been lost under Baasha and Omri, and the Israelites once
more enjoyed the right to occupy a particular quarter of Damascus. Accord
ing to the Hebrew account, this was the retaliation they took for their previous
humiliations.^ It is further stated, in relation to this event, that a certain man
of the sons of the prophets, speaking by the word of the Lord, bade one of his
companions smite him. Having received a wound, he disguised himself with
a bandage over his eyes, and placed himself in the king’s path, “ and as the
king passed by, he cried unto the king : and he said. Thy servant went out
into the midst of the battle ; and, behold, a man turned aside, and brought
a man unto me, and said. Keep this man : if by any means h§ be missing,
then shall thy life be for his life, or else thou shalt pay a talent of silver.
And as thy servant was busy here and there, he was gone. And the King of
Israel said unto him. So shall thy judgment be; thyself hast decided it.
Then he hasted, and took the headband away from his eyes, and the King of
Israel discerned him that he was one of the prophets. And he said unto
‘ 1 Kings s.x, 1 -34 .



DAMASCUS BEFORE THE ASSYRIAN INVASION.
him, Thus saith the Lord, Because thou hast let go out of thy hand the
man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore thy life shall go for his life,
and thy people for his people. And the King of Israel went to his house heavy
and displeased, and came to Samaria.” ^ This story was in accordance with the
popular feeling, and Ahab certainly ought not to have paused till he had
exterminated his enemy, could he have done so ; but was this actually in his
power ?
We have no reason to contest the leading facts in this account, or to doubt
that Benhadad suffered some reverses before Samaria ; but we may perhaps
ask whether the check was as serious as we are led to believe, and whether
imagination and national vanity did not exaggerate its extent and results.
The fortresses of Peraea which, according to the treaty, ought to have been
.restored to Israel remained in the hands of the people of Damascus, and
the loss of Kamoth-gilead continued to be a source of vexation to such of the
tribes of Gad and Keuben as followed the fortunes of the house of Omri : ^
yet these places formed the most important part of Benhadad’s ransom. The
sole effect of Ahab’s success was to procure for him more lenient treatment;
he lost no territory, and perhaps regained a few towns, but he had to sign
conditions of peace which made him an acknowledged vassal to the King of
Syria.^ Damascus still remained the foremost state of Syria, and, if we rightly
interpret the scanty information we possesss, seemed in a fair way to bring
about that unification of the country which neither Hittites, Philistines, nor
Hebrews had been able to effect. Situated nearly equidistant from Raphia
and Carchemish, on the outskirts of the cultivated region, the city was protected
in the rear by the desert, which secured it from invasion on the east and north
east ; the dusty plains of the Hauran protected it on the south, and the wooded
cliffs of Anti-Lebanon on the west and north-west. It was entrenched within
these natural barriers as in a fortress, whence the garrison was able to sally
forth at will to attack in force one or other of the surrounding nations ; if the
city were victorious, its central position made it easy for its rulers to keep watch
over and preserve what they had won ; if it suffered defeat, the surrounding
mountains and deserts formed natural lines of fortification easy to defend
against the pursuing foe, but very difficult for the latter to force, and the
* 1 Kings XX. 35-43. * 1 Kings xxii. 3 : “ And the King of Israel said unto his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we be still, and take it not out of the hand of the King of Syria?” ^ No document as yet proves directly that Ahab was vassal to Benhadad II. The fact seems to follow clearly enough from the account of the battle of Karkar against Shalmaneser II., where the contingent of Ahab of Israel figures among those of the kings who fought for Benhadad II. against the Assyrians {Inscription on the Monolith of Kurhhi, col. ii. 11. 91, 92). I shall have occasion later on to refer to this subject.



788 THE HEBREWS AND THE PHILISTINES—DAMASCUS.
delay presented by this obstacle gave the inhabitants time to organise their
reserves and bring fresh troops into the field. The kings of Damascus at the
outset brought under their suzerainty the Aramaean principalities—Argob,
Maacah, and Geshur, by which they controlled the Hauran, and Zobah, which
secured to them Ccele-Syria from Lake Huleh to the Bahr el-Kades. They had
taken Upper Galilee from the Hebrews, and subsequently Peraea, as far as the
Jabbok, and held in check Israel and the smaller states, Ammon and Moab,
which followed in its wake. They exacted tribute from Hamath, the Phoenician
Arvad, the lower valley of the Orontes, and from a portion of the Hittites, and
demanded contingents from their princes in time of war. Their power was
still in its infancy, and its elements were not firmly welded together, but the
surrounding peoples were in such a state of weakness and disunion that they
miHit be left out of account as formidable enemies. The onlv danger that
menaced the rising kingdom was the possibility that the two ancient warlike
nations, Egypt and Assyria, might shake off their torpor, and reappearing on
the scene of their former prowess might attack her before she had consolidated
her power by the annexation of Naharaim.
