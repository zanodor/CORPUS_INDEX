In Orion: TheOrionNebula(M42 and M43)
Sky Conditions: Any skies
Eyepiece:
Low power for nebula; high power for Trapezium
Best Seen:
December through March
Where to Look: Find the constellation Orion, high in the south. Three bright stars in a line make up the “belt” of Orion; dangling like a sword from this belt is a line of very faint stars. Aim your telescope at these faint stars.
In the Finderscope: A star in the middle of this line (the sword) looks like a fuzzy patch of light rather than a sharp point. That’s the nebula; center your crosshairs there.
In the Telescope: Under low power, the nebula will appear to be a bright, irregular patch of light, with a few tiny stars set like jewels in the center of the patch. Under high power and good conditions you should be able to pick out four closely spaced stars which form a diamond or trapezoid shape. This is called TheTrapezium. With the Trapezium at the center of the low power field, at about a quarter of the way out to the northern edge of the field lies an eighth magnitude star. A patch of light envelopes this star, and extends a bit north of it. This is M43, which is really part of the same nebula system as M42.

Comments: The darker the sky, the more detail you can see in the cloud and the farther you can see the cloud spread out as it fades away into space. Under perfect conditions you might just be able to detect a slightly green hue in the nebula. The area around the Trapezium is a remarkable place to examine. Under low and medium power, you may make out several lanes of light, separated by darker gaps. Immediately around the Trapezium, there does not appear to be as much nebulosity. Part of this appearance is an optical illusion, as the brightness of the Trapezium stars makes our eye less able to pick up the fainter glow from the nebula; but part of this effect is real, too, as the light from the brighter stars apparently pushes away some of the gas, thinning out the nebula around these stars. Looking at M42 and M43, one gets the impression that a tendril of light almost extends between these two nebulae. But there is a definite dark gap between these two, possibly the result of a dark cloud of dust obscuring that part of the nebula from our sight.
What You’re Looking At: The Orion Nebula and the Trapezium are part of a large region of star formation, enveloping most of the stars we see as members of the constellation Orion. (Sigma Orionis is another member of this group – see page 52.) The diffuse nebulae M42 and M43 are a region of active stellar formation within this system, where the gas
is strongly illuminated by newly formed stars. The cloud visible in a small telescope is about 20 light years across from one side of the nebula to the other, while radio waves from this region indicate the presence of a cold, dark cloud of gas over 100 light years in diameter. There is enough matter in the visible nebula to make up hundreds of suns, while the surrounding dark clouds may hold many thousand solar masses. The nebula lies some 1,500 light years away from us. Of the four bright stars in the Trapezium, all but the brightest one (Star C) are in fact extremely close binary stars. None of them can be split in a telescope; but two of the pairs are eclipsingbinaries, stars that dim periodically as one member of the pair passes in front of the other. Star B, also known as BM Orionis, is the star at the north end of the trapezoid. It consists of two massive stars; together, they have over a dozen times as much material as is in our Sun, and they shine with about one hundred times its brightness. An eclipse occurs once every six and a half days and lasts for just under 19 hours. During that time it fades by over half a magnitude. Star A, the one to the west, is called V1016 Orionis. Even though astronomers have been studying the Trapezium for hundreds of years, it wasn’t until 1973 that anyone realized that this was a variable star. It goes into eclipse once every 65.4 days, fading by as much as a magnitude over 20 hours. Normally, this star is equal in brightness to Star D; if it appears dimmer, it’s in eclipse.

In addition, there are at least four other fainter stars which have been discovered in and around the Trapezium. Two of these, at eleventh magnitude, may be visible with a moderately sized telescope (4" or larger). The stars of the Trapezium are just the brightest of more than 300 stars that large telescopes can see in this nebula. The westernmost of the Trapezium stars is itself a double star. Two of this assemblage of young, newly formed stars stars near the Trapezium form the wide, bright double star Theta-2 Orionis. These stars, of magnitudes 5 and 6.5, are located about two arc minutes to the southeast of the Trapezium. Although discovered fairly early on in the history of astronomy, this nebula was first studied intensely in the late 1700s by, among others, Sir William Herschel. He was one of the great astronomers of his day; in fact, he discovered the planet Uranus. However, his drawings of the Trapezium region fail to show two somewhat faint stars which other observers with large telescopes, starting from the 1840s, have had no trouble finding. It may be possible that a cloud of dark material between those stars and us has been dissipating; or perhaps we’re watching new stars being born.
Also in the Neighborhood: To the south of M42, just on the edge of the low power field, is a multiple star, Iota Orionis. Two components are visible in a small telescope, with the dimmer star (magnitude seven and a half) located 11 arc seconds southeast of the third magnitude primary. Less than 9 arc minutes to the southwest of Iota is a wide, bright, easy double called Struve 747, comprised of a magnitude five and a half primary star, with a magnitude 6.5 star located 36 arc seconds northeast of it. The two components of Struve 747 line up nicely with Iota Orionis. Less than 5 arc minutes west of Struve 747 is a much dimmer double, Struve 745. This pair consists of equally dim stars (about magnitude eight and a half) stars, 29 arc seconds apart, aligned north–south.

The Orion nebula is a diffuse nebula, a huge cloud of gas, mostly hydrogen and helium. The gas of such a nebula is irradiated, and glows, bythe energy of the young stars inside it. For example, the Trapezium and the other stars inside M42, and the eighth magnitude star inside M43, provide more than just the light that shines through the gas. High energy ultraviolet light from these stars also causes the electrons of the gas atoms to break apart from the atoms, much like the electric current acts in a neon light. When the electrons recombine with the atoms, theyemit red and green light. The color photographic film used to photograph nebulae tends to pick up the red light better than our eyes do, so color photos of this nebula tend to be reddish; but our eye tends to see it as slightlygreen. What’s going on in this gas cloud? Apparentlythe force of gravity inside the cloud causes clumps of gas to gather together until they’re big enough to sustain nuclear reactions inside themselves, at which point theybecome stars. And so, we think, what we are looking at here are stars being born. There are several arguments supporting this theory. For one thing, the spectra (the relative brightnesses of the colors in the starlight) of the stars within the nebula match the spectra which theory predicts should occur in young stars. Also, it is possible to measure the speed at which these stars are moving, relative to one another. For instance, tracing backwards the motions of the stars around the Trapezium, one can conclude that theyall started out from more or less the same place within the last few hundred thousand years. This implies that these stars are mere infants in terms of the billions of years which most stars live. As one moves away from the Trapezium region, progressivelyolder stars ar e found. It is estimated that star formation began in this nebula about 10 million years ago. Manyother examples of diffuse nebulae exist throughout our galaxy, often in association with open clusters of stars. By looking at different nebulae and clusters, we can see different stages in the processes bywhich stars are born.

Finderscope View
In Orion: A Multiple Star System, Sigma Orionis
Sky Conditions: Steady skies
Eyepiece: High power
Best Seen:
December through March
Where to Look: Find Orion, and look to the three stars in his belt. From left to right, their names are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka. Just below Alnitak (the eastern one) is another, somewhat less bright star. This is Sigma Orionis.
In the Finderscope: The three stars of the belt will be visible in the finderscope. Sigma Orionis is only a little dimmer than these three bright stars, and should be very easy to find. Using Alnitak as the hub of a clock face, with south at 12 o’clock and the other belt stars lying in the 8 o’clock position, Sigma Orionis is positioned at about 11 o’clock.

Star Magnitude Color Location A 8 White Primary Star B 8.5 White 68" SSW from A C9 White 8.5" W from B
In the Telescope: The brightest star in the field is Sigma Orionis A and B, a double which is too close together for a small telescope to split. To the east of A/B is star D, which shows a reddish tinge especially in a larger telescope; northeast and about three times further away is star E. With a slightly larger telescope, you can see star C, a faint star southwest of A/B. In the same field of view, to the northwest, is another triple star system, called Struve 761. These three stars form a long narrow triangle, pointing to the north.
Comments: In most small telescopes (less than 4") Sigma Orionis will look like a triple star, as Cis too dim to make out next to the primary (A/B). However, Ccan be seen in a 6" telescope. All the components of Struve 761 are visible in a small telescope. With two complicated multiple stars so close together in the same field, it can be something of a challenge to keep track of which star is which.
What You’re Looking At: The Sigma Orionis system is located about 1,500 light years from us. A and B are a pair of extremely bright and massive stars, only about 100 AU apart (too close to be separated in a small telescope). Both Cand D are separated from A by great distances, at least 3,000 AU and 4,500 AU respectively, and E is almost a third of a light year from A.
SigmaOrionisathighpower
Sigma Orionis, Struve 761, the belt stars, and the Orion nebula are all part of the same aggregation of young double stars and nebulae, travelling together through the galaxy.
Also in the Neighborhood: Alnitak (the belt star near Sigma) and Mintaka are also doubles. Alnitak is a tough object to split in small telescopes, since the companion is very close to its primary (only 2.4 arc seconds southsoutheast). Another possible companion, a dim (tenth magnitude) star, is located about an arc minute to the north. The companion of Mintaka is easily separated from its primary (located 53 arc seconds north of the primary) but at seventh magnitude it is fairly dim.
