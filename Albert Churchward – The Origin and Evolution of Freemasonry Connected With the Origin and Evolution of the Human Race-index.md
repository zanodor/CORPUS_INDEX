TO ALL
MY BROTHER FREEMASONS
THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
WHO ARE SEEKING FOR
THE TRUTH






INTRODUCTION
At the present time many countries are suffering
from Socialism and Anarchy, with the attendant
evils that always have been associated with every
nation wherever the ignorant classes have been
allowed to predominate in the councils and the
government of the country, wdth the result that
civilization has not been retarded onlv, but set
back again for hundreds of years, at least in the
progress of evolution in these countries. This
evil is now threatening the whole of humanity
and can be arrested permanently only b}^ the Unity
of the Brotherhood of Freemasonry ; and it is
to point out these facts and the remed}' that it
has been willed I should write this book for the
knowledge of the Brotherhood. The Unity of all
the Brotherhood of Freemasonry throughout the
world is the only means for a permanent Universal
Peace. And what reasons are there against a
Universal Brotherhood being formed to establish
permanent Peace throughout the w^orld under
the principles and tenets of the Craft ? Herein
have I set forth details of the same.
It is at the request of many Brothers I publish
this book. I do so more readily because it supplies
7



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
a link missing in my former publications, giving to
the Brotherhood a further proof of that knowledge
which they seek, and which very few, if any,
members of the Craft have ever devoted such time
and study in scientific research as is necessary
to speak with authority on the subject matter.
In order to gain a true conception of the origin
and evolution of Freemasonry, its Signs, Symbols,
and all its Rituals and Ceremonies, one must have
also a knowledge of the origin and evolution of
the Human Race, with all the Totemic Mysteries
performed in Sign Language by Primitive Man.
They are linked together pari passu, and the
answer as to the origin of all our Brotherhood can
be found only by unravelling the mystery and
causes as to why we find different Types of the
Human Race, their different beliefs being in many
cases analogous, and all using the same Signs
and Symbols—although under -different termin
ology, and scattered over the face of earth and
water throughout this world.
There are two important subjects we must
study and master before v/e can arrive at the
critical truth.
The first is the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles,
which govern the evolution and devolution of
the Universe and by -which T.G.A.O.T.U. created
all things, and is for ever creating, and balances
devolution by evolution.
The second is the learning and comprehending
8



INTRODVCTION
" Sign Language " in all its phases, that being
the mode of registering the prehistoric past before
verbal language came into being, by a continual
repetition in the Totemic and other Mysteries or
Ceremonies of Primitive Man.
I therefore will try to teach you some knowledge
of the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles—in other
words, '' The Divine Laws of the Universe " ;
otherwise you will fail to understand how and
why progressive evolution is constantly and for
ever taking place, its objective being to a " higher
type of Homo " ; devolution being but one phase
of this progressive evolution.
W\ the facts I have herein set forth can be veri
fied as the truth b}' any Brother who will devote
sufficient study and scientific research to the
subject matter.
These can be found written on stones, papyri,
in the Ritual of the Restirrection of Ancient Egj'pt
(written in Sign Language), and amongst the
inner African and other native tribes in various
parts of the world, and follow the Laws of Evolu
tion and the migrations of the Human Race.
I am greatly indebted to the Rev. J. M. Douglas
Thomas, F.R.G.S., and Mrs. K. Watkins for
correcting the MS. and for the drawings contained

The Origin and Evolution
of Freemasonry
CHAPTER I
PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES AND SOCIALISTS
Recently Ethics has been preached and written
by men who have not the shghtest idea of the
harm they are doing to their fellow-creatures and
their country. They cannot have any real know
ledge of the past history and evolution of the
human race, or the causes of the rise and fall of
all great nations of the past, or from whence
originated the doctrines they believe in, or profess
to believe in ; also many fallacies are still written
and preached by some of our professors and great
divines as truths, whereas the truth is entirely
different. I therefore hope that this may awaken
and teach them before it is too late, and that the
human race may not be sent back to the dark
and degenerate age from which we have just
emerged.
15



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
One only has to think and understand that the
pursuit and acquisition of truth is of infinite con
cernment to mankind in the study of the evolution
of the human race, and the origin and beliefs
and meaning of all the doctrines found throughout
the world. By the cultivation of our reason we
are better enabled to distinguish good from evil,
as well as truth from falsehood ; both these are
matters of the highest importance^ whether we
regard this life or the life to come.
A great error is often committed on account of
the disguise and false colours in which many
things appear when presented to us in an imperfect
state. 1 have seen thousands of things which are
not in reality what they appear to be, and that,
both in the moral and natural world :
Knavery puts on the face of justice.
Hypocrisy and superstition wear the vizard of
piety.
Deceit and evil are often clothed in the shapes
and appearances of truth and goodness.
We are imposed upon at home as well as abroad ;
often deceived in our senses, by our imaginations,
by our passions and appetites, by the authority
of men, by education and custom : also led into
errors by judging according to these false and
flattering principles for the want of mature judg
ment, rather than according to the nature of
things and experience of the past, which is true
knowledge.
i6



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
Reason is the glory of human nature and one
of the chief eminences whereon we are raised above
our fellow-creatures in the lower world.
It is only by reasoning from past experiences
and understanding the Periodic Laws that a
country or a nation can save itself from downfall
and destruction and advance to a higher state
of evolution ; without this knowledge the humans
will not advance much further to a higher type
of man than the present highest Hom.o. But by
understanding and following these Laws, humanity
may attain a much higher type than it has hitherto
reached, and it is for our Brotherhood throughout
the world to assist and carry forward this great
work.
That my readers may better understand the
subject of the Periodic Law,' the result of different
groupings and the causes for changes in these
groupings of Corpuscles, I will give a short descrip
tion of how this is brought about by portraying
it in tabular form, but must first premise for their
information that a Corpuscle is a negative particle
of electricity which can exist alone, ^ the
size and weight of an Atom of Hydrogen, with a
velocity of about 100,000 miles per second, and
can penetrate through the thickest block of steel.
An Atom is made up of two or more Corpuscles
surrounded by Positive Electricity.
I T am indebted to Professors J. J. Thomson and R. R.
Dunkan for much information on this subject.
17 B



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Positive Electricity cannot exist alone. Matter
is a group of Atoms, either inorganic or organic.
With regard to the number and arrangem.ent of
Corpuscles, their structure as found in the form^ation
of Atoms, and the different properties that a
given structure would confer upon an Atom, they
follow the same Periodic Law as for the Elements.
If there are two Corpuscles only— i and 2— they
will be in equilibrium if placed on opposite sides
of the centre of a sphere :
If there are three Corpuscles—i, 2, 3—they will
be in equilibrium if they form an equilateral tri
angle with its centre at the centre of the sphere.
iri\
Four Corpuscles will arrange themselves at the
corners of a square




PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
When these Corpuscles exceed five, they break
up into two groups.
The group containing the smaller occupies the
surface of an inner shell towards the centre. The
others are on an outer shell concentric with
the inner one, the sphere of Positive Electrification
surrounding and balancing them all.
As the number of Corpuscles still further in
creases, there arrives a stage at which the equili
brium cannot be stable, even with two groups,
and the Corpuscles divide themselves into three
groups, on three concentric shells ; and as numbers
further increase, more and more groups are
necessary for equilibrium.
For example, the following table will show how
the Corpuscles group themselves.

PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
30, when we have a group of 5 surrounded by
10, surrounded by 15, and so on. It means,
simply, the periodic recurrence of certain groups
of corpuscles as the number of corpuscles consti
tuting the atom increases. We see in this way
that we can divide the various groups of corpuscles
into families

each member of the family is derived
from the preceding member and has certain similar
definite properties. Now, when any ring is subject
to an external disturbance, one or more corpuscles
may easily be detached from it. The negative
electricity of the collection of corpuscles is just
balanced by the sphere of positive electricity
surrounding and enclosing it—if, therefore, one
negative corpuscle is lost, the whole arrangement
will assume a positive change. Such an atom
would then behave like the atom of a strongly
electro-positive or basic element. Applied to
humans, the will, mind or action of an individual
would become positive or of an optimistic character.
In the case of 59 corpuscles, the number of cor
puscles inside is only just sufficient to make the
outer ring of 20 stable ; this ring will be, therefore,
on the verge of instability, and when its corpuscles
are displaced the force urging them back again
will be small. With the next group, 60 corpuscles,
the outer ring is more stable, because there is an
additional corpuscle inside it. While it may lose
a corpuscle it will not do so as readily as the group
59. Hence, it'Vill not so easily assume the posi
21



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
tive charge of electricity, and, therefore, will not
be so electro-positive an element as group 59.
In the human, the individual will not be so positive
in his opinions or force of arguments. Sixty-one
corpuscles will be still less electro-positive. When
the total number of corpuscles increases, say, up
to 63 or 64, the possibility of losing a corpuscle
from the outer ring vanishes. When the
stability of the atom becomes extreme, one or
more corpuscles of the outer ring may actually
lie on the surface of the atom without breaking
the ring. In this case the atom receives a charge
of negative electricity, and v/ould behave like
the atom of an electro-negative element. In
man, the thoughts, actions and opinions of the
individual must assume, therefore, a negative
character. This increase in the stability of the
ring, and consequently in the electro-negative
character of its atom, would augment until
it had as many as 67 corpuscles, when the stability
of the ring arrives at its maximum ; 67 corpuscles,
therefore, consequently represent a strongly electro
negative element, or in the human a pessimistic
character. Thus we see that, in losing or gaining
a corpuscle at the terminal ends in a definite group,
changes entirel}^ opposite are brought about, either
electro-positive or electro-negative. In the human
it would produce an optimistic or pessimistic
character, or the action of the individual would
become active or passive, whilst the corpuscles of
22



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
the centre of the group are neither electro-positive
nor electro-negative and are incapable of receiving
any charge of electricity whatever. In the human
this is depicted by senile dementia, or the loss of
recollection and thought. The atom would not
be electro-positive or electro-negative, and as the
brain cells are made up of atoms composed of these
corpuscles in various groups, almost in pure form,
it is easy now to understand why causes such as
shell shock, railway accidents, mental shock of
any kind, or the bombardment of these corpuscles
by others from an outside influence, will convert
a normal brain into an abnormal one. Also how
the Divine Creator, by increasing the number of
groups of these corpuscles, has produced the higher
types of Man and higher evolution of the human
race. One also obtains the physiological causes
for good and evil to which the human race is subject,
produced by evil or good influences outside the
individual, or individuals, acting on the various
groups of corpuscles in the brain cells of the
objective, causing one group of corpuscles to lose
a corpuscle at one of its terminals and another
to gain it, by this arrangement possessing different
properties. This occurs by what is called valency
(grabbing power). A univalent positive series is
one which, under certain circumstances, attains
stability by losing one corpuscle, A univalent
negative series is one that will acquire one, and one
only, of the corpuscles of another series.
23



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
A divalent positive series is one which will lose
two corpuscles and no more, and a divalent negative
series will acquire two or more.
The valency of the series is thus simply a ques
tion of the number of corpuscles that can escape
from, or be received by, the corpuscular groupings
which constitute any kind of series. We here
perceive how impressionable brains or an unstable
condition of the groups of corpuscles are easily
acted upon by outside influences, or by those
corpuscles which are grouped and possess strongly
positive or negative conditions. I give one group
as an example only to demonstrate to my readers
how changes take place by the subtraction or
addition to one or more corpuscles from the group,
proving how a positive can be converted into a
negative or vice versa ; whether it be actions,
thoughts or elements, either in inorganic or organic
matter, the results are always similar. For in
stance, we will take the inorganic element H^^drogen,
an atom of which possesses i,ooo corpuscles=H,
and Oxygenic, which has 16,000 corpuscles to
make up one atom.
Now, when these atoms combine under certain
conditions an interchange takes place in their
groupings, and what is called a chemical compound
is the result. Two atoms of Hydrogen grab one
of Oxygen, or one atom of Ox3'gen grabs two of
Hydrogen, and the oxide of Hydrogen, i.e., water,
is formed = H2O.
24



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
In the inorganic world, or in the elements, the
groupings and number of corpuscles are the sim
plest : in the vegetable world a greater evolution
takes place and the groupings are more complex ;
when we come to the animal world there are
still greater numbers of groupings and still more
complexity ; in the highest type of the human
race they are the greatest. In much of the in
organic world, radio-active matter is constantly
returning these corpuscles to their original form.
This inorganic world has been formed by the simple
process of lowering the temperature from 30,000°
Cent., when all were corpuscles only, and as the
temperature cooled, so the various elements were
formed at different degrees of temperature, by
different groupings : ultimately all will revert to
simple corpuscles again—because the Sun, the
centre of our system of all the planets that have
been thrown off from it, is cooling down, and
in time, how long it is impossible to say, will
become cold and dead ; then these will clash
together again with others that have arrived at the
same condition, the constant bombardment and
clashing together, each one being attracted to the
centre of the swarm, causing intense heat ; so
that ultimate^ a temperature of about 30,000°
Cent, will be produced, with the result that all
the elements and matter split up into the original
corpuscles from which they were formed and a
new star comes into existence. We can see and
25



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
prove by the telescope and spectroscope the
changes as they take place ; also, as the star
cools down again, we can see how the elements
are re-formed at the various temperatures that
occur in the process. This proves that evolu
tion and devolution in the Universe are balanced
and that nothing is lost : only a transference
and a transformation takes place of energy and
matter.
It is the same in the organic as in the inorganic
w^orld : given a person's mind or thoughts in a
stable condition upon any particular or definite
subject, his brain cells are made up of these
groups of corpuscles just on the balance of stability,
i.e. on the line or condition of a series that is in
a stable condition—electrically—a normal brain.
But something occurs outside his brain cells w^hich
affects this series, say shock or acute mental
emotion, or only a bombardment of this series
of corpuscles by others outside, for example
;
first it alters the grouping of this series and the
result is a change from the previous mental condi
tion, which has been a normal one, but now
becomes either a positive or negative state of
abnormal action or thought ; in certain events it
might render the grouping of the corpuscles into
that state which is 'neither positive nor negative,
and these groupings are incapable of receiving or
losing another corpuscle —his mind or brain then
w^ould become '' lost/' i.e. he would be quite
26



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
incapable of thought or impressions—" His mind
is a blank/'
The evolution of the organic follows the same
law, or rather is a continuance of the same laws
of the inorganic. As I stated supra, in the lower
forms of life the composition and groupings of
these corpuscles are comparatively few and simple.
The human follows on under the same lav;—take,
for example, the lowest Homo, the brain of a
Pygmy— Primitive Man. Here we find what is
called the grey matter, from which all thoughts,
will and ideas emanate, comparatively thin, and
the sulci of the brain are not deep. In the highest
type of man this grey matter is the thickest and
the brain has the deepest sulci. In the different
types between the highest and lowest we find
many variations, the grey matter always getting
thicker and the sulci deeper as we advance in the
upward trend of evolution.
Evolution being ever progressive, so these
corpuscles ever multiply in numbers and series,
and this is always the case normally. But if
from any cause or causes this progress is inter
rupted, then the negative which will constitute
a degenerative form will predominate, and a
retrograde action may be the result.
This is briefly the Periodic Law, or God's Law,
or as it is commonl}^ called the Law of Nature,
which few people study and fewTr comprehend.
Yet these Laws are true and immutable. In
27



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
them we possess the key to gain the whole know
ledge of the secrets of the Universe, Life and
Death and the Hereafter ; the causes and effects
of the rise and fall of all nations—for the causes
and the results we see developed in the human
for good or ill ; the actions, thoughts, the different
attitudes assumed by men and women, who may
live under the same surroundings, but who in
thoughts, actions, and words are diametrically
opposed to each other in their opinions on any
given subject, each one supposing and believing
himself to be right, yet at the same time many
labouring under the greatest fallacy, because the
normal condition of the corpuscles of the atoms
comprising their brain cells has received wrong
impressions, either positive or negative, the result
of different groupings. This may occur in many
ways, i.e. by reading that which is not true, being
erroneously taught, or having their brain cor
puscles bombarded by others outside, by suggestion,
or any other pernicious influence. Disease will
also produce the same results, or, if I may put it
in another way, some of these causes will produce
disease, which is a disarrangement of the corpuscles
of one or more series. In some cases where (too
many of) the brain corpuscles have not escaped
to any great extent from the one normal series, by
treatment, this may recover again the corpuscles
which have escaped, and so we have then a
return of a normal brain. As an example, a man
28



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
with a normal brain holds a certain and definite
opinion on a given subject : some one has im
pressed him, say by talking to him, or he may have
an objective shock in some form, which causes
him to change that previous and true opinion
into one which is false ; later he may, by physical
or some other evidence impressing a positive or
negative action on the corpuscles, find that his
first opinion was correct, and so will think again
rightly—normally. Here a corpuscle has escaped
from one series and joined another, but its electrical
attachment or attraction to its last series is not
great, and so it may easily detach itself and rejoin
its original series or group. The foregoing will
fully explain to the Physiologist the curious
pathological conditions which have recently been
developed, probably for the first time in the human,
causing the abnormal symptoms w'hich we term
" shell shock."
The cause of some diseases is that the normal
groupings of the corpuscles of the cells of certain
tissues or of the blood have from some cause or
another undergone different groupings, and the
tissue and blood become abnormal ; now, treat
ment will rectify this. For example, we want the
blood more acid : aluminium hydroxide in this
case will be effective, because it increases the
hydrogen ion concentration, and when absorbed
the metallic ion (Al) takes up three hydroxyl (OH)
molecules, being trivalent, and this leaves an excess
29



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
of Hydrogen (H) ions. On the other hand, saHcic
acid makes the blood more basic, because the
siHcon ion has the opposite charge to alumen, and
so by this means the corpuscles regain their
original groupings in the atoms forming the tissues
involved ; the disease thus becomes eliminated
and the patient cured. There is so much to be
learnt on this subject that I look forward to see
such a great advance made in the future medical
treatment on these lines as will astonish the world
and bring a great deal of human suffering to an
end, but it is not a subject to dilate on here.
There is no spontaneity in nature or the laws of
nature that can be demonstrated by scientific
research. The universe is harmonious, composed
of three physical entities, Matter, Ether, and
Energy. These three phases, although appearing
to be separate and distinct, are in reality one.
They are forms or phases of a reality, bound to
gether by the Divine God to form His Universe,
and, if I may express it, " His Laws of Nature,''
and you cannot create or destroy an atom or
corpuscle of the same, neither can you arrest the
devolution and evolution which is constantly
taking place. Is the poetry of nature destroyed
when one knows these laws ? In my opinion it
is a thousand times increased, and the wisdom of
man is but foolish in comparison. We know and
must believe in these days, because we can prove
it by scientific experiments, that everything in
30



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
God's Universe of World and Stars is made up of
corpuscles, the ultimate constituent part of the
atoms of all the elements as known to chemists.
Men and women, mice and elephants, the belts
of Jupiter and the rings of Saturn, every mechanical
work of earth, air, fire and water, every criminal
act, every human deed of love or valour—all are
made up of these corpuscles and the relation of
one swarm of corpuscles to another. Here, for
example, is a swarm of corpuscles vibrating,
scintillant, martial—they call it a soldier ; and
anon in France or Germany that swarm dissolves

dissolves, forsooth, because of another Httle
swarm they call shells. What a phantasmagoric
dance it is, these corpuscles of atoms ! Mark
you the mutabihties of things. These same
corpuscles, or others like them, come together
again, vibrating, clustering, interlocking, com
bining, and the result is a woman, a fiow^er, a black
bird or shark, as the case may be. But to-morrow
the dance is ended and the corpuscles and atoms
are far away—some in fever germs that broke
up the dance ; others are the green hair of the
grave, and others are blown about the antipodes
on the waves of the ocean, and the eternal ever
changing dance goes on.
One thing, therefore, is sure : that every action
of everything living or dead, within the bourne
of time and space, is the action of one swarm of
corpuscles on another, for without them there is
*» 31



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
but empty void. These are God's little servants
which nothing can destroy. You take a piece of
coal, composed of these corpuscles and atoms ;
you burn it, and you can convert this consecutively
into heat, into mechanical energy, into electrical
energy, and in some far away street into the
radiant energy of the arc-lamp. Or take a piece
of iron and heat it to 30,000° Cent. ; presto !
these little corpuscles fly off and unite with others

the moist atmosphere—and form clouds, de
scending again as rain to form rivers and oceans.
Again " the dead stars " clash together, and the
result an ever-increasing temperature, until it has
reached a degree of 30,000° Cent., and lo ! a new
star, a new world is formed, and at that tempera
ture all are in the form of our little corpuscles ;
these gradually cool down again until the chemical
elements of which this world is comxposed are
found. This evolution and devolution is repeated
and repeated, but God's little servants are never
destroyed, not one ; they only assume other forms
of swarms, or they can exist by themselves, and
then so small, ^ the size of an atom of
hydrogen. And how fast they can travel—90,000
to 100,000 miles per second—and what can stop
them ? Nothing, for they can penetrate the
biggest block of steel ; and with these little atoms
God has created all and everything, and is for
ever creating.
There is no spontaneity in the creations ; all
32



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
are governed by a well-known law—the Periodic
Law. These corpuscles, when existing alone,
possess the same properties, and when combined,
always in definite combinations, each possesses
definite properties which never exist precisely
the same in any other combination. If a different
quantity of these unite, or combine, a different
property is evolved. These form the Alphabet
of all things living or dead.
The Socialists state that " Nature is not like
the products or works of man " —no ; because
man could never produce that which God can with
His little servants. All man can do is to use these,
mechanically or otherwise, and produce different
forms of things, either material or diverse, such
as good or bad actions or thoughts. He cannot,
however, produce the ultimiate forms of the very
atoms with which he works. These are given to
him by a Divine Creator in order to attain a higher
type, a higher standard, for himself and those
who follow him. As man has advanced up the
ladder of evolution, so by the Divine Will these
corpuscles have with Time produced a higher
type of the human from the original, by different
combinations of the corpuscles forming the brain
cells, and the law of evolution is tending to be
always progressive and to evolve a superior Homo.
When men or nations do not follow the laws of
evolution, one little swarm of the brain cells will
convert another little swarm into a third form,
33 c



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
and those men or nations will eventually become
destroyed, and these corpuscles will unite again
somewhere to form a higher type in other men
or nations, for the progressive evolution which is
constantly taking place. How could these things
be if there was no Great Divine Creator ? It is
the eternal law of evolution, the key to learn. This
knowledge lies in the Periodic Law of the cor
puscles and elements. Here only can you fmd
your Alphabet, learn to spell and then read the
Universe of God—not the Socialist's Universe.
They contend that if the individual is a complete
and independent totality, if his end be in himself,
then any voluntary self-restraint, let alone self
sacrifice, on the part of the individual is unintelli
gible. If the individual contains his end wdthin
himself as person, where can the obligation lie
to prefer a painful course which can never possibly
redound to the ulterior interest ? He recognizes
the call to do and to forbear only in things which
directly affect the society, all actions not having a
direct social bearing being morally indifferent to
him. In this conception of duty, the individual
consciously subordinates himself to the commu
nity, not limited by frontier, but world embracing.
Thus we shall see later in this book that the only
difference betv/een the Aboriginal Tribes and the
present-day SociaHsts is, that the Aboriginal
Tribes' first and only Tribal Ethic was for the
Tribes or Totemic Clan alone into w^hich the
34



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
aboriginal was born, or belonged, but he believed
in a Supreme Being and a life hereafter. In the
case of the Socialists it embraces, or would do so,
all the Tribes of the world, but with no behef in
a Supreme Being or a life hereafter. In Socialism,
Ethics becomes political, and PoHtics become
Ethical, whilst Religion in the end is consigned to
be absorbed in a corporate social consciousness of
which the telos is the final purpose of Society,
thus implying that there is no life hereafter or
spiritual second life.
That is a great fallacy and the cause of unbelief in
the phenomena of Spirit Life hereafter. There is one
man I am glad to see who writes with the courage
of his convictions—Sir Oliver Lodge, F.R.S.
Although he has so7ne proof of the borderland and
the beyond, he is far from knowing the whole
truth, nor does he yet possess the key to gain the
entrance to the secrets of the future life. In his
various works, to one who knows and possesses
the key, this is evident. His article " Must Nature
Perish ? " I answered in the Freemason, April 22,
1916. His recent articles in the Daily Chronicle
and in his book on Raymond, or Life and Death,
prove to me beyond a doubt that he has not been
using a good spiritual medium—these are ver}^
few and rare to find, but many exist. He would
not have written Life and Death, and expressed his
experiences in the terminology that he has, if
his medium had been a good spirit, and this I
35



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
challenge to prove to him objectively if he so
desires. Much that he has written, however, is
absolutely true. He states :
'' A chief obstacle in
the way of recognizing the possibility of survival
of bodily death is the fact that loss of body means
the loss of brain, and that so the mind appears
to cease to work. At any rate, the brain ceases
to work ; and the question arises, how then can
memory persist ? If memory is located in the
brain and nowhere else, memory cannot survive
the destruction of that organ. But if survival of
memory is proved experimentally, we can take
it as demonstrated that memory is not, or not
solely, located in the brain." His answer to his
own question is bad logic, because if the brain
perishes so do all other parts of the body ; he is
at fault because he does not understand or know
the truth. If all perishes nothing can remain,
yet he knows memory does remain. I answer,
the truth is that memory is located in the brain
corpuscles, and in the brain corpuscles alone. And
although the matter part dies the corpuscles do
not die, but still exist, and can be seen, the same
as the body corpuscles. The whole spirit of the
man or woman after death has no material body or
material brain, but these exist as the likeness of
the body and brain - in a bright corpuscular form.
The Periodic Law provides for this. Many after
death do not remember anything of this life here
on earth until it is recalled to them. The brain
36



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
may be compared to a book with many blank
leaves, and each day you print or write a page
in this book during your Hfe on earth. How many
people can tell you all they have printed in this
book ? If asked about a certain thing that has
happened, they say they have forgotten

their
memory fails them ; and yet an hour or so after
they remember all about it, by some incident
perhaps that has been brought to their notice.
It has been photographed on the corpuscles all
the time, but they have not been able to turn to
the right page of the book. And so it is after
death ; at a certain time all is recalled to them.
In no part of the body have you matter which
possesses the same physiological effect as the
brain. Here you have the brain tissue composed
of corpuscles and ions almost in their pure form
embodied in so-called matter, and it is owing to
the disarrangement of these corpuscles and ions
from their normal conditions that men's minds
and memories become abnormal. It is by the
knowledge of how to use these corpuscles that the
mind, or will, of one who knows can operate upon
another body submitted to its temporary guidance
and control, also how to re-form these corpuscles
in their normal and original groups which consti
tute what is termed a normal brain. (In shell
shock and injuries to the brain by any concussion,
such as railway accidents, etc., these corpuscles
are disorganized from their normal group consti
37



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
tutions ; in other words, by the injury received
they have regrouped themselves under the Periodic
Law into groups and forms which possess different
properties from the original.)
Sir Oliver Lodge states : " However it be accom
plished, and whatever reception the present-day
scientific world may give to the assertion, there
are many now who know, by first-hand experience,
that communication is possible across the boundary

if there is a boundary betw^een the world appre
hended by our few animal-derived senses and the
larger existence concerning which our knowledge
is still more limited ; communication is not easy,
but it occurs/' Let me assure him that to those
who possess the secret and know, as the old Wise
Men of Eg37pt knew, it is quite easy if you under
stand the Periodic Law of the Corpuscles.
If you wish to know the truth you can only
work with good mediums, and you must never
use bad spiritual mediums. You ask, How do
you know, or how can you distinguish the one
from the other ? The answer is that it is quite
easily done when you possess the secret knowledge
of how to send them to the Gates of Paradise and
pass them through the Maa-Kheru of the Ancient
Egyptian High Priests. The knowledge of the
Periodic Law^ of the Corpuscles gives you the key
to unlock the book containing the hidden m3^steries
of the Universe. It points out to you clearly and
definitely the causes of the fall of every great nation.
38



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
In the course of time, Science, which now rightly
demands verification and proof, will discover the
secret and acknowledge the truth. But scientists
as a whole have much to learn, and until they
take the trouble to do so they will not make
any great advancement or gain any real know
ledge regarding the secrets of nature and the
cosmic law^s.
I have been induced to make these statements
because I know that I know, and because Sir
Oliver Lodge in his Life and Matter, p. 58, writes
on this subject as follows :
'' And those who think
they have such a contribution to make, and such
a revelation entrusted to them, are bound to express
it to the best of their ability, and leave it to their
contemporaries and successors to assimilate such
portions of it as are true and to develop it further/'
Although I have known some of the secrets of the
old Egyptian Urshi for many years, and proved
them to be true, I have not written these truths
before. All those who are interested in the Laws
of the Spiritual World must, therefore, thank Sir
Oliver Lodge for my setting these forth in this book.
I can only add that I quite agree with Sir Oliver
in his criticism of Professor Hackel's writings

only more so.
Herbert Spencer could find no origin for the
idea of an after-life save the conclusion which
the savage draws from the notion suggested b}'
dreams (Spencer, Facts and Comments, p. 210).
39



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
But whatsoever dreams the savage had, they would
become famihar in the course of time. He would
learn that dreams had no power to externalize
themselves in apparitions, had there been no
ghosts or visible spirits of the dead. He would
also learn readily enough, and the lesson would
be perpetually repeated, that howsoever great
his success when hunting in his dreams of the
night, there was no game caught when he awoke
in the morning. Clearly no reliance could be
placed on dreams for establishing the ghost, any
more than on the result of other dreams. More
over, the same savage who is assumed to have
panned out on dreams for a false belief also reports
that he sees the spirits of the dead by abnormal
vision and has the means of communicating with
them. But all the credulity of all the savages
who ever existed cannot compete or be compared
with the creduhty involved in this belief or assump
tion that the ghost itself, together with the
customs, the ceremonies, the religious rites of
evocation and propitiation, the priceless offerings,
the countless testimonies of the veritabilit}^ of
abnormal vision, the universal practices for induc
ing that vision for the purpose of communicating
with spiritual intelligence, had no other than a
subjective basis, and, a false belief that the dream
shadow was the sole realit}^ Can one conceive
anything more fatal to this, made on behalf of
evolution as a mode of nature's teaching than this
40



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
assumption that man universally has been the
victim of an illusion derived from a baseless
delusion ? If primitive men were the victims of
a delusion which has been continued for thousands
of years in defiance of all experience and observa
tion, what guidance or trust could there be in
evolution : or how are we to distinguish between
the false product and the true if man dreamed the
ghost into being when there was no ghost, if he
had been so far the victim of his own Frankenstein
as to found the whole body of his religious behefs
and customs on that which never existed ?
Primitive man was not a hundredth part so likely
to be the victim of hallucination or diseased
subjectivity as the modern. External nature is
not hallucinative ; it is the scene of continuous
education in primal or rudimentary and con
stantly recurring realities. His elemental spirits
or forces were real, and not the result of hallucina
tion ; why not his ancestral spirits ? African
spiritualism, which might be voluminously illus
trated, culminated in the Egyptian Mysteries.
The Mystery Teachers were so far advanced as
phenomenal spiritualists, and say so little about
it in any direct manner, that it has taken one who
owns to have a profound experience of the phe
nomena many years to come up with them in
studying the eschatology of the RituaL
There are many people in this world who
are Spiritualists—scientific men and others, but
41



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
few possess the true knowledge and secret of
action.
The Divine God creates new Stars or new Worlds
to serve His purpose and Will ; these when their
allotted task is finished decay and die out, and
then are re-formed into new Stars or Worlds ; so it
is with man from the lowest Pygmy : each type
rises to a higher type, evolution is progressive, and
it is only because the great masses of people do not
comprehend this and have follow^ed the teachings
of ignorant men that Socialism and Bureaucracy
have arisen, and consequent^ caused the destruc
tion of great nations.
The individual is only a partly complete totality
in this world, but to a great extent independent,
the influence of good spirits and bad spirits being
antagonistic ; his own consciousness and concep
tions being the individual factors to decide the
issue, the ultimate decision is often influenced by
material circumstances, other sw^arms of corpuscles
in present human craniums bombarding his own.
Education to a higher standard is the only means
to eradicate these bad influences and impressions,
which are thus against his ulterior interests. His
complete totality is only achieved in Paradise by
the blending of the male and female into one
whole. Therefore the fallacy of the Socialistic
arguments. The human has passed Totemic
Sociology ; he is partially an independent totality
in himself, but owes a duty to the State or country
42



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
to which he belongs, and above all has a duty to
the Divine Creator, inasmuch that if he does not
follow the Divine Laws laid down by evolution
he will ultimately become annihilated,^ both as
an earthly human and also a spirit form. He is
independent if he does not break the laws of the
country ; these are laid down in all well organized
society for the good and well-being of society :
although many of our laws are bad, yet it remains
with the majority to rectify them if they will.
He is independent to follow the Laws of the Divine
Creator ; if he obeys, he has his final reward,
eternal happiness—not as God Himself or a part
of Him, as the Socialists preach it must be, if
there is a Divine Creator, but as one of His servants.
The result, however, if he does not is total destruc
tion. The Ancient Egyptians knew^ these secrets,
but when their old Wise Men were destroyed the
only evidence left was written on stone and
papyrus. And this has ever been the case when
nations have been laid waste and ruined ; their
wise men were killed and all art and learning
ended, as far as the conquerors were able, and the
whole country lapsed into barbarism and decay.
But a few escaped to hand down the secrets to
posterity when the chosen people should know
them again, so hfting the human race to a still
higher standard. This time is beginning to dawn
^ I mean by this the annihilation and destruction of this
spiritual body into original corpuscles without groupings.
43



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
on humanity, if you stamp out and kill the cancer
that is consuming the life of the country; if you
do not, darkness and ignorance will still prevail
until new men or new nations arise with less
narrow-minded and bigoted opinions. The Socialist
is far inferior morally to the poor aborigine ; he
is so imbued with self-interest that to work or
act without personal advantage would be to
admit the inadequacy of himself as an end in
himself. He is so egotistic that he cannot admit
there is a Divine Creator Who formed and created
an infallible law—the Periodic Law^—to govern
and carry on the evolution and devolution of
the Universe. The Socialist is so conceited that
he places his own works and thoughts on a higher
plane than any Divine Creator. He states
:
" Did I become conscious, however dimly, however
transiently, of ' myself ' as having lived and played
a part amid the life of past ages, then I could
believe in a continuance in the future, but my
personal identity begins with a certain year
;
beyond that I have no personal identity.'' He
does not consider or understand that except the
doctrine of transmigration was true this could
not be the case, and inasmuch as this doctrine is
a fallacy, founded on the behef that the elemental
spirits were living personalities at one time, there
could be no knowledge of personal identity, how
ever dim, to remind him of a former hfe—which
did not exist.
44



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
The poor aborigines make little spirit-houses,
and place food therein to propitiate the spirits
of their ancestors, and offer sacrifices to the Great
Spirit ; they also propitiate the elemental or
animistic spirits—but they do not believe that
these latter ever possessed any form of humanity ;
they knew better, and it is through the ignorance
of later humans in not understanding this that
the doctrine of transmigration of souls arose and
came into existence. The above must be sufficient
proof, then, that the poor aborigines are morally
a higher standard of the human than the
Socialists.
The Socialist recognizes a duty, however, to
the world-wide society to which he belongs, but
to nothing else. His argument is fallacious because
ethically there can be no difference if the society
is a State, clan, or world-wide—it is a duty to
society, to which he belongs. He ignores recog
nizing a duty to his Divine Creator because he
professes not to believe in any, and yet, mark well
the consciousness of his brain cells, which inform
him that there is ; but he gets over this by ad
mitting a " first cause " only. Whatever that
may mean to him, he is still in the dark and
unable to make further explanation regarding it
;
he has jumped into a deep pit of mud from which
he cannot extricate himself, although he attempts
to do so by using metaphysical arguments and
Platonic terminology. His " first cause " is the
45



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Periodic Law of the Corpuscles and Elements,
which he does not understand. If he could compre
hend this, his consciousness would convince him
that the final purpose of this immutable law did
not end with him personally here, or yet the
telos of his society itself, but that his birth and
life on this earth was only one phase in the evolu
tion of Life Eternal. The whole human life has
been from the first, and is still so here, one state
of transition to a higher type, interrupted now and
again by the downfall of a great nation, which
has reached the highest type for the time, the
cause being in all cases the introduction of Socialism
and Bureaucracy. But gradually the course of
evolution continues, carried on by other nations,
which arise out of the ashes of the dead. Socialists
believe in the physical or materialistic principle
of the life of mankind.
If the materialist calls science to his aid, it is
only to find that his difficulties increase as his
scientific investigation goes on. He is met at
the outset with the fact that the purely material
istic hypothesis utterly fails to render any adequate
interpretation of the phenomena of life. To the
materialist the question " whence I came and
whither I go '' remains unanswered w^hen you
bid him look round, the universe and direct his
attention in turn to the animal and vegetable
kingdom, to the sea, to the stars and different
constellations by night, to life and death ; and
46



PERIODIC LAWS OF THE CORPUSCLES
when you ask him what is the meaning of it all,
he can only generalize on his unknown laws of
nature, and omits to account for the origin and
purpose of nature, or the future life which the
Spiritualist knows to exist.
The highest ethical code of our Brotherhood
embraces all the supreme principles of human
intelligence, goodness and righteousness, resist
ance of evil, love for each other and living for
the good of all ; it is the supreme witness and
exponent of the highest religious doctrine ; it
holds that these are Divine and supreme eternal
laws for individual and social action, which are
the principles of the mind and Will of God. They
are unalterable and eternally true, and men and
nations can only live truly by obeying and
co-operating with these laws.
47



CHAPTER II
LIFE AND WHAT IT IS—MATERIAL, SPIRITUAL AND EVOLUTIONAL
And Life—what is Life ? No one has yet learned
how it was engendered ; why, when, or where,
not only in man but in animals and plants.
According to the prevalent conception of life,
human life is the short time from the birth to
the death of man's animal part. But this is not
all that life is in the human ; this is merely the
existence of man as an animal personality. Human
life is certainly something which reveals itself in the
animal existence, just as organic life is something
which reveals itself in the existence of matter

an unknown combination of series of corpuscles.
The animal may live for his own body only ;
nothing prevents his living thus : he satisfies
his individuality and unconsciously plays his part,
and does not know that he is an individual ; but
reasoning man cannot live for hib owm body alone.
He cannot live thus because he knows he is an
individual, and, therefore, realizes that other people
are individuals also, and understands all that must
48



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
result from the relations of the one to the other.
Man himself makes his real life in this world,
and lives it. But in two modes of existence bound
up with this life man cannot take part, i.e. his
spiritual body and matter constituting him. The
former is composed of all pure corpuscles which
exist eternally in his bodily form. The latter,
of a series of corpuscles forming his component
parts ; which on death and disintegration assume
other series of corpuscles and forms. The study
of these forms of existence, included within and
constituting him as a whole, i.e. his Spiritual and
the Material, constituting the animal, shows man
the universal Periodic Laws of all existence. Man
does not know, and cannot know, any other life
of his former self, scrutinize his past as carefully
as he will. If he has learnt the Periodic Laws of
the Corpuscles, he knows how he has been formed
by various combinations of series of these, but he
has no knowledge from whence these were derived,
or how formed, or what combinations these assume
to form his whole, or what form they will take
after the disintegration of his material body.
The Spiritual or higher or better part of man's
life—the everlasting Spiritual corpuscular body
contained in the material body, is always striving
towards the good, happiness and welfare of himself
and fellow-men. But the common herd of unthink
ing men understand the welfare of man to be the
welfare of his animal part.
49 D



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION Of FREEMASONRY
Yet his consciousness or Spiritual Self, which
he will discover definitely at some indefinite period
during his life, will always call upon and tell him
that the true life of love for others is the only
one that will confer lasting happiness upon him,
and that there is another form of life, after this
animal life has been annihilated, that will exist
for eternity. The gnosis to obtain this everlasting
Spiritual Life, which Ethics was first promulgated
by Taht-Aan in The Ritual of Resurrection or
The Egyptian Book of Life, has been carried down
through the past ages by the so-called " Speculative
Freemasons," time and circumstances being the
causes of substituting the innovations in place of
those fragments which have been lost or as yet
have not been found.
The discovery of the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles
is the discovery of science, and applies equally
to the Natural or Physical Laws, the Cosmic
Laws and the Laws of the Spiritual World, —one
is identically a continuation of the other, —and
knowing therefore that these Laws are the Laws
of the Spiritual World, that whole region at once
falls within the domain of science and secures a
basis as well as an illustration in the constitution
and course of nature ; from the beginning to the end
it becomes the discerni^ig faculty, clairvoyant power
of seeing the eternal 'in the temporaL The unity
of conception becomes complete. The perfection of
unity is attained w^here there is infinite variety
50



LIFE AXD WHAT IT IS
of phenomena, infinite complexity of relation.
All known phenomena can he arranged in one vast
circle under the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles,
being caused by the various groupings of the different
series of corpuscles, separating and uniting into
particular groups—these being the ultimate atoms
that the Universe is built up of, and every ex
pression of thought, word, or deed is caused by
various groupings into different numbers of these
'* little bricks " of the Great Creator.
My own opinion is that life is not dependent
upon the bodily matter —that life is an unknown
combination of a series of corpuscles, which in
the human at least continues to exist for eternity.
What is commonly called the " spirit " consists
of pure corpuscles in series, in the form of the person
which once lived as a human, only much more
beautiful. There is not the slightest doubt of
this in my mind, because I know two people still
living who possess the inestimable gift of seeing
and being able to converse or communicate with
their friends, who never leave them night or day.
But these good spirits cannot talk so that one can
hear them ; they cannot make noises, nor can
you take photographs of them : all this that
Spiritualists tell you is chicanery and humbug.
You cannot take photographs of spirits because
they are composed of pure corpuscles— Beta
Rays ; and as it is the Beta Ray that pro
duces photographs, naturally it cannot produce
51



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
itself. If 3^ou ask them a question, they will
make a motion of affirmation or negation only ;
but if you have a good spiritual medium, whom
you send into a hypnotic state, you can converse,
gain any information you wish that they are
permitted to tell you, and they will answer questions
or communicate their wishes. The Ancient Eg^^p
tian Priests knew this and gained much knowledge
through this means. But the real secrets are
known to a few^ only, and since the fall of the
Old Egyptian Empire the ignorance of the human
always has been such that great opposition has
always been, and still is, shown to the study of the
Laws of the Spiritual World. But future genera
tions will become more enlightened, and the know
ledge that we shall gain through this means may
be the source of enlightening us as to what life is
and all the secrets of the Universe.
Man has come so far up the ladder of knowledge
and evolution that it is unthinkable there is not
still a higher state to attain, and that ultimately
we shall be able to gain the knowledge which up
to the present we have not obtained. It is not
likely that the Divine Creator should leave His
work unfinished. In the higher degrees we are
instructed to become Philosophers.
All philosophy is in some sen^e the endeavour
to find a unifying principle, to discover the most
general conception underlying the whole field of
nature and of knowledge. According to Schopen
52



LITE AND WHAT IT IS
hauer, " Will" is the fundamental reality of the
world, the thing itself ; and its objectivation is
what is presented in phenomena. The struggle
of the will to realize itself evolves the organism,
which in its turn evolves intelligence as the servant
of the will. And in practical life the antagonism
between the will and the intellect arises from the
fact that the former is the metaphysical substance,
the latter something accidental and secondary.
But the " Will " of Schopenhauer is a swarm of
corpuscles acting on another swarm of corpuscles
in the atoms and molecules of the brain tissue ;
some electrical or other cause changes these swarms
of corpuscles (which as far as the will is concerned
are dormant) into activity, and a will to think or
do is the result ; that is the true science of his
philosophy.
" Hackel and his followers maintain that when
the material organism decays, the vital energy
no longer exists, but is resolved into inorganic
energies associated with gases and relics of the
deca3dng body. He states that science always
finds these inorganic energies to reappear on
the dissolution of life, and has never in a single
instance found the slightest reason to suspect that
the vital force, as such, has continued to exist/'
I do not understand what Hackel means by " vital
force," except life, and if that is so he is quite wrong.
First, as Sir Oliver Lodge justly states, life is not a form
of energy ; it belongs to a separate order of existence,
53



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
which interacts with this material frame of things,
and whilst in this material body exerts guidance
and control on the energy which already exists
in the elements which compose the material body.
Life does not alter the quantity of energy ; it
utilizes available energy, the same as living things
are able to direct inorganic terrestrial energy
along new and special paths, so as to achieve
results which without '' life " could not have
occurred. Life is a guiding principle, a controlling
agency ; i.e. life does guide and influence the
elements of inorganic nature, and when the
" body " dies, that simply reverts into the in
organic elements. Life as in the human, at
least, still continues to exist ; to most people
it is by no means alone, i.e. without being in
corporated in matter, apprehensible to their
senses ; but undoubtedly others have an in
estimable and unpurchasable gift and are able to
see it, and with these it does not depend on matter
for its visuality. This proves that it is indepen
dent, that its essential existence is continuous and
permanent, and its interactions with matter are
discontinuous and temporary.
Whether the life of plants and animxals is the
same is another question upon which I would
have some doubt, for the reason that the series
of corpuscles composing them have not yet mani
fested such a complete series as in the human,
and as I look upon evolution as a progressive stage,
54



LIFE AXD V/HAT IT IS
I can conceive that it is onty in the human where
life has a persistent and eternal state of combina
tion of these complex series. I conceive it possible
that life commenced as a simple living cell made up
of a certain and definite combination of corpuscles,
which by a process of evolution gradually grew
into more complexit}^ until Homo appeared, and
that it was not until this stage that a corpuscular
form analogous to Homo was formed.
But there is no known proof on this point.
I do not understand what Sir Oliver Lodge
means vvhen he states (Life and Death, p. 318) :
*' A Power that may properly be called super
naittral/'
Does he mean an elementar}' power

super
human ?
The expression altogether is :
'' In other words,
they have essentially recognized the existence
of a PowTr transcending ordinary nature—a Power
that may properly be called supernatural."
All the elementary powers are superhuman.
The powers possessed by a very few persons,
of whom I profess to be one, of being able to
communicate with our '' Glorious Ancestors " in
Paradise, and sometimes even with the Great
God Himself, are only human powers, founded
on the knowledge of the Periodic Laws of the
Corpuscles.
I know of no supernatural power.
Amongst all aboriginal races the belief in the
55



ORIGIX AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
living spirit after the death of the body is universal.
That is the religion of all ancient spiritualism dis
tinguished from animism. The spirits of the dead
are accepted as operative realities.
The Christian cult is the only one religion in
the world that was based upon the corpus instead
of the resurrection in spirit. In no other
religion is continuity in spirit made dependent
on the resurrection of the earthly body. The
Christians mistook the risen mummy in Amenta
for the corpse that was buried on earth, whereas
the Egyptian religion was founded on the rising
again of the s-pirit from the corpse, as it was imaged
in the resurrection of Amsu-Horus transforming
from the mummy Osiris, and by the human soul
emerging alive from the body of dead matter.
There is no instance recorded, in all the
experience of spiritualists, ancient or modern,
of the corpse coming back • from the tomb.
The so-called worship of ancestors depended
entirely on the ancestors being considered as
living, conscious, acting and recipient spirits, and
not as corpses mouldering in the earth. This
furnishes the sole raison d'etre for all the sacrificial
offerings, the life, the blood, the food, the choicest
and costliest things that could be given to the
dead. Those whom -we call dead were to them
the veritable living in superhuman forms possessing
superhuman powers. John Tanner bears witness
to the reality of being able to see the " spirit body.''

He was himself inducted into a state of abnormal
seership by the Indian Medamen, and saw a spirit
in the shape of a 3^oung man, who said to him :
" I look down upon you at all times, and it is
not necessary you should call me with such loud
cries'* {Narration, p. 189; New York, 1837).
Clairvoyance was '' the vision and the faculty
divine," the " beatific vision " of all the early
races. It was sought for and cultivated, prized
and protected, as the most precious of all human
gifts, and the possessor was held to be divine—the
nearest approach to a human divinity.
Miss Kingsley states : " Every West African
tribe has a secret society. Every free man has
to pass through the secret society of his tribe.
If during this education the elders of the society
discover that a boy is what is called in Calabar
an Ebumtup—a person who can see spirits—they
advise that he should be brought up to the medical
profession" (Kingsley, W.A.S., p. 214).
The old Her-Seshta,i or Wise Men of Egypt,
indicated that man may become co-w^orker with
both nature and Divinity on these higher planes
if he will.
He may sit in the Councils of Destiny' and help
to shape the progress of the race, or he may crawl
like a worm and be trodden under foot till, through
misery and pain, he struggles to the Light.
I There were seven classes with different names of these
old Priests of Egypt.

But few that remained of those who were not
slaughtered in past ages were duly and truly worthy
and qualified ; but these few have preserved the
message which they have transmitted unimpaired
through ages, that will some day make man free
and develop in an equal degree his spiritual faculties
as compared with his physical power.
Equity along the line of justice and right will lay
the foundation for a grander civilization that will
secure social order, because it must be an organiza
tion of individuals actuated by a desire to do
right under the light formulated by untrammelled
reason and conscience ; thus shall justice be uni
versal and want and misery unknown.
So many great errors and evils have arisen from
bad observation and reasoning that it becomes a
natural question to ask how it comes to pass that
man observes and reasons so badly, when his business
is to observe and reason. Because he is a limited
being, with very limited capacity, while that which
he has to observe and reason about is illimitable.
Observation is a process of mental growth, slow
and tedious necessarily, and only to be perfected
by degrees : for it is the organic construction of
an internal order of mind, a mental organization,
in conformity with the external order of nature,
by mutual interaction. It is because it is objective
and subjective that it requires the conjoint action
of the within and without, that it is a slow
progress of organic development, nothing less
58



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
than the patient construction of a mental fabric
formed by minute degrees and slowly accumu
lating increments through ages of time by the
gradual increase of the corpuscular groups in
the brain cells.
This is one of the causes of errors of thought
and erroneous beliefs, which are now exploded
notions because we have instruments of science,
and these were long inaccessible to human sense.
It therefore may be stated as, or the cause of,
the want of means of observation. Another cause
is the want of opportunities of observation.
It is obvious that he who has not the opportunity
is as ill placed for arriving at a sound conclusion
as he who has not the means of observing ; to
want the opportunity is to want the means.
Perhaps at the present time the chief cause of
errors is the want of habit or capacity of observa
tion. Although one person may have a better
natural aptitude to observe than another, ^^et no
one can observe well in any province of nature
without training by practice, any more than he
can shoot well without practical lessons.
Thus we get erroneous reasoning by those who
exult in the modern diffusion of knowledge, who
bray of the enlightenment of the age, and who do
not reflect how very small is the minority of
men on whom the boasted progress depends
actually ; how entirely the intellectual possessions
of the race have been and are gained and maintained
59



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
by the few ; how httle real knowledge the vast
majority has, and how mechanical that little is ;
how great a dead weight of ignorance passively,
and how strong an organization of hostile super
stition actively, withstand progress. How often
has an ingenious pioneer of thought put forth new
facts and theories which have met with no accep
tance in his day, but which are revived and accepted
generations after, because only then has such a
raising of the general level of knowledge and such
development taken place as render full apprehen
sion and exact expression of his theory possible.
People cannot credit the discoverer with having
known what he meant, because it has taken them
a hundred years to discover his meaning.
It cannot be denied that, with respect to the
origin and nature of visions and hallucinations,
experience makes it plain that phenomena really
morbid have uniformly been jnistaken for super
human appearances all the world over. So much
lies beyond dispute. Furthermore, it is indis
putable that temperaments proved naturally to
lapse into morbid action have been designedly
selected, and means suited to induce morbid
action of them systematically used, in order to
obtain visions. But to leap forthwith from that
conclusion to the unqualified assertion that all
visions of the superhuman everywhere have had
a like physiological or pathological origin, and
no higher origin, is to make a generalization which
60



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
will not readily obtain acceptance with our present
knowledge of the Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles.
It must be instantly and earnestly protested that
there are essential differences between the hallu
cinations of mental disorders and the true super
human visions of inspired or gifted seership.
The vital question really is, whether any vision
bears a superhuman superscription on its face,
and, if so, what the superscription is. There is
one important fact that has to be considered in
this argument ; that is, we have a physically
objective and subjective and demonstrable form
of life, living and continuing to live in millions,
in the world everywhere, without showing visibly
to the ordinary power of our eyes. If a hundred
years ago anyone had advanced the theory that
this life existed and was in many cases the cause
of our ailments, describing the whole conditions,
he would undoubtedly have been stamped as one
suffering from hallucinations and mental disorder.
Nevertheless, by the aid of the microscope and
anihne dyes we have been able to demonstrate and
prove that there is a life of active organisms existing
which no one can see without the aid of the " seer
ship " of the microscope, after these organisms
have been treated with aniline dyes—not even
the microscope alone, however powerful, will
enable us to demonstrate as a fact that these
exist. Therefore, it is not of any great point
in imagination that the common herd of humanity,
6i



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
with their gross material instincts and thoughts,
are unable to see the corpuscles of the living spirit
that has emaned from the dead human body.
We have truth in Nature as it came from the
Divine Creator, and it has to be read with the
same unbiased mind, the same open eye, when we
inquire as to the universal human good and the
Divine interpretation of things ; but to find and
gain the knowledge of the Truth we must obliterate
and cast away the adulterations, the artificial
accumulations of centuries of uncontrolled specula
tion : they mark the impossible of progress.
How can it be otherwise with dogmas which depend
for their existence on a particular exegesis, with
propositions w^hich rest for their evidence upon
supposed probabilities, or upon the w^eight of
some unscientific authority which can give no
actual proof ; with doctrines w^hich every age
and nation may make or unmake, which each
sect may tamper with, and which anyone
may modify for himself ? —all of which is
totally opposed to the immutable Periodic Laws
of the Universe. There is a sense of greatness
and solidness about the Periodic Laws of Nature
(proved by scientific experiments) which belongs
to nothing else. Here at least, amid all the shifting
sand of speculation, is one thing sure : unbiased,
unprejudiced, uninfluenced by like or dislike, by
doubt or fear, the one thing that holds on its way
eternally incorruptible and undefiled from eternity ;
62



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
and this Periodic Law of the Corpuscles proves
that the principle of continuity is maintained the
same in the Laws of the Spiritual World.
And as regards the proof of Evolution I must
say a few words here. Mr. Kidd, in his The Science
of Power (" The Limits of Darwinism and Social
Evolution ")y has tried to prove that Darwin
was not true in his scientific deductions— or at
least only partially so.
I will comment on a few " extracts " from Mr.
Kidd's works which will, I contend, prove that
Darwin was quite correct and that Mr. Kidd's ideas
are erroneous —to say the least ; other parts of this
work will also prove the errors of Mr. Kidd's
theory and give the true causes of human evolution.
He asks : ''If individual character and racial
types are so rigidly fixed by biological inheritance,
or inborn heredity, how comes it that the Japanese
managed to change their entire national psychology
in a single generation ? "
They have not changed as types of Homo.
They are anatomically and physiologically Stellar
Cult people, the same as the Chinese, but have
had, in many cases, a mixture introduced of " other
blood." But a great number still remain true
Stellar Cult type as from the first, before the
exodus of these left Old Egypt, their original
home. Environment and mixing with other
superior races has enabled them to assimilate
knowledge which they did not originally possess.
63



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
One has only to examine their osteo-anatomy
and hair to prove that this is correct. When
external objects in many different forms were
presented to them continually, the development of
the grey matter of their brain would increase
from generation to generation, and would be quite
sufficient to account for the assimilation of new
changes and ideas of what Mr. Kidd calls " national
psychology." This, however, has not occurred
in one single generation. Their osteo-anatomy
has not changed except when there has been a
mixture of types, as we find amongst many.'
The fact that they have assimilated new ideas from
an outside race, or races, who are in a higher state
of evolution does not prove that Darwin is wrong
;
on the contrary, we find that the principal change
was first produced amongst those who had " mixed "
blood, and that the evolution of the corpuscles
of the brain cells continues progressively, a point
which Mr. Kidd obviously has not taken into any
consideration at all ; hence his errors. Mr. Kidd
recalls the main thesis of his Social Evolution.
" Civilization rested, it was maintained, not on the
intellect, or on the reasoning processes of mind,
but on the physical inheritance transmitted from
generation to generation, and entirely independent
of inborn heredity in the individual," and he states :
" None of the leading races or nationahties w^hich
have ruled in the past, or which wield power on
I See Origin and Evolution of the Human Race.
64



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
3l large scale over other peoples in the present,
have done so, or do so now, because of any distinc
tive superior intellectual faculties inborn in the
ruling race."
To sum up :
" Darwinism is the science of the causes which
have made those who are efficient in the struggle
for their own interests supreme and omnipotent
in the world. Now, this doctrine has nothing to
do with the science of civilization. It is the
doctrine of the efficiency of the animal. It has
absolutely nothing to do with the causes making
for collective efficiency on the social and moral
world founded on mind, which is everything in
civilization. Darwinism represents, indeed, the
very antithesis of the principles of that social
integration which is taking place in civilization.
The dividing line, moreover, is fundamental.
For the first principle of evolution in the world
of the efficient animal of Darwinism is the
supremacy and ommipotence therein of indi
viduals, or groups of individuals, efficient in
their own interests. The iirst principle, on the
contrary, in the evolution of the social world of
civilization lies in the subordination of individuals.
The story of creation up to and including human
savagery is simply the story of the supremacy in
the world of physical force in the life of the indivi
dual or the efficient group or the efficient State.
But the story of evolution above savagery is nothing
65 E



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
else than the story of the gradual rise to supremacy
in the world of those psychic forces organized in
civilization which are subduing individuals or
aggregations efficient in their own interests to
those universal principles which are making for
the limitless efficiency of civilization."
These statements are absolutely diametrical to
facts, and if Mr. Kidd had any real knowledge of
the past and present evolution of mankind, I do
not think for one moment he would have pro
pounded such theories. Take it as he states :
" The story of creation up to and including human
savagery is simply the story of the supremacy
in the world of physical force in the life of the
individual or the efficient group.'' It is not. The
lowest type of human which was evolved from the
Anthropoid Ape was the P3^gmy ; some of these
have attained a higher standard than others.
The next higher type in evolution is the Masaba
Negro ; the next higher to that is the non-Hero
Cult Nilotic Negro ; the next higher is the Nilotic
Negro, with Hero Cult, and from these the Stellar
Cult people were evolved. Remnants of all still
exist in the world, but what has occurred ? This,
that the higher t3^pe in evolution has exterminated,
or driven away into fastnesses, forests, or moun
tains, the lower types, each in buccession. Does
he mean to tell me for one moment that '' simply
physical force " was enough to drive the non-Hero
Cult away from the Hero Cult ? The next higher
66



LIFE AXD WHAT IT IS
type were the Stellar Cult people : does he mean
to tell me that " physical force '' alone was sufficient
for these to exterminate the Nilotic Negro ? The
suggestion is too preposterous to be entertained
for one moment. He can prove this, if he cares
to make the experiment, by taking a group of
Warramunga, or Masai Nilotic Hero Cult people,
and a group of Chinese or Japanese, Stellar Cult
people : let them fight it out with nothing on

physical force would prove his theory was not sound,
but that Darwin's was absolutely correct. Why ?
Because the development of these lower-class
humans is as distinct and certain in the evolution
of the human race as is the white from the yellow,
and the progressive form_s of white or dominant
races. He states that '' Darwinism is the science
of the causes which have made those who are
efficient in the struggle for their own interests
supreme and omnipotent in the world," and then
states that the doctrine has nothing to do with
civilization, etc. Here again Mr. Kidd fails to
recognize what has occurred in the evolution
of the human and is entirely wrong in his statement
as a result. Man first had short legs, long arms
and large abdomen, with small brain—850 to 1,000
c.c. (the Pygmies) ; next we find great develop
ment of bone takes place, longer legs, shorter arms,
less abdomen and greater brain— 1,000 to 1,200 c.c.
(Nilotic Negroes) ; the next we find is that the
bones are not too large, legs, arms and body
67



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
more proportioned, and the brain much enlarged
1,200 to 1,400 ex. (Stellar Cult people). Had
this nothing to do with civilization ? The very
fact that, as they had greater development of
brain tissue, they would observe and think more
of all the phenomena of nature, their wants would
increase in proportion, and civilization would
gradually dawn and take place—this is what has
occurred ; yet he acknowledges that '' collective
efficiency in the social and moral world is founded
on mind —which is everything in civilization."
Quite so ; that is the proof of the evolution of
the human race. The mind, as he terms it—or, as
I would rather state it, the brain cells, and more
particularly the grey matter of the brain—had been
increasing both in size and thickness as a result
of the progressive evolution of the human race,
under the Periodic Laws, from the first, and still
continues to do so in the higher types of the human.
The '' series of corpuscles " increase in numbers
and complexity ; that is progressive evolution
according to Darwin's science and is a profound
fact. It is owing to the increase of the numbers
and complexity of these corpuscles of the brain
cells that higher types of evolution in the human
race are produced and the highest civilization that
has been attained up to the present tim.e has been
caused (see later).
Hom.o first developed great bone and muscular
power because he had to contend against large and
68



LIFE AXD WHAT IT IS
fierce animals if he was to live and become dominant,
which was the Will of the Divine Creator ; but
as soon as he had overcome these, what did
he require for a higher state of evolution ? Not
more bone and muscles, but brain, and this then
began to develop : this is well observed in tracing
the Pituitary Gland in the brain from the Pygmy
to the Stellar Cult man. With the development
of his brain greater powers of thought and observa
tion would come into being. Darwin never left
out the development of the brain as a factor to
attain a higher state of evolution, and Mr. Kidd's
w^orks, therefore, are most decidedly misleading
as regards the truth of evolution anatomically
or socially : he must have overlooked what Darwin's
opinion was when the latter wrote as follows
:
'' Variabilit}^ is generally related to the condition
of life to which each species has been exposed
during several successive generations ; changed
conditions act in two wa^'s, direct^ on the whole
organization or on certain parts alone, and indirectly
through the reproductive system." As the wants
of man increased so did his power of reasoning.
The progressive development of the grey matter
of the brain produced, as a result, " ideas and
reasoning powers " to a far greater extent than
man had attained before, giving him knowledge
which he formerly did not possess. As one example,
it would enable him to form and acquire new
implements, which the inferior races were unable
69



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
to fashion, thus enabHng him to dominate and
exterminate any resistance on the part of his
inferiors. Science and Art would gradually dawn,
and a higher and nobler form of religious ethics
and civilization would be the result. Civilization,
it is true, is an arbitrary term. Anthropologists
have not 3^et settled the boundary line between
a savage and a civilized people. The obtaining
food from wild plants and animals, without any of
the arts of culture and domestication, would apply
as a definition to the savagism of the aborigines
of Australia and all the non-Hero Cult people
and probably to most of the Hero Cult people
as well. But when we come to the group of the
Masai, we must admit that an early step in civiliza
tion had commenced which has continued pro
gressively ever since. But what does Darwin
say in his The Descent of Man ? —" The small
strength and speed of man, his want of natural
weapons, etc., are more than counter-balanced,
firstly, by his intellectual powers, through which
he has formed for himself w^eapons, tools, etc. ;
secondly, by his social qualities, which lead him to
give and receive aid from his fellow-men. Natural
selection had been the chief agent of change,
though largely aided by the inherited effects of
habit and also slightly by the direct action of
the fluids of the system having altered for some
special purpose (products of ductless glands),
inducing other changes. In regard to mental powers
70



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
the faculties have been chiefly, or even exclusively
y
gained for the benefit of the community, and the
individuals," therefore, have at the same time
gained an advantage indirectly. The social in
stincts, together with sympathy (which leads to
our regarding the approbation and disapprobation
of others), have served as the primary impulse
and guides. As the wants of man increased, so
did his power of reasoning. Social instincts have
been acquired by natural selection, or the indirect
result of other instincts and faculties, such as
sympathy, reason, experience, and a tendency to
imitation, or long-continued habit. Man is a social
being, but social instincts never existed in all of
the same species ; he would inherit a tendency to
be faithful to his comrades and obedient to the
leader of his tribe, but these are qualities common
to most social animals ; and although man has
no special instincts to tell him how to aid his
fellow-men, he still has the impulse, and with his
improved intellectual faculties naturally would
be much guided in this respect by reason and
experience. With highly civilized nations, con
tinued progress depends, in a subordinate degree,
on natural selection ; for such nations do not
supplant and exterminate one another as do
savage tribes. Nevertheless, the more intelhgent
members within the same community will succeed
better in the long run than the inferior, and leave
a more numerous progeny ; and this is a form of
71



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
natural selection. The more efficient causes of
progress seem to consist of a good education during
youth, whilst the brain is impressible, and a high
standard of excellence, inculcated by the ablest
and best men, embodied in the laws, customs and
traditions of the nation and enforced by public
opinion. With man we can see no definite limit
to the continued development of the brain and
mental faculties. It should be borne in mind that
the enforcement of public opinion depends on our
appreciation of the approbation and disappro
bation of others : and this appreciation is founded
on our sympathy, which hardly can be doubted
originally was developed through natural selection
as one of the most important elements of the social
instincts.
I think what I have written here and in my other
work is sufficient to prove that Mr. Kidd's theories
are not the truth of the matter and that Darwin
was perfectly right in his deductions. For further
proofs, for those interested in Darwin's theory,
I would refer them to The Descent of Man, new
edition, 1901.
Many readers may not agree with my chronology,
and may think that I am not correct in dating
back the world's history and the age of man to
such great antiquity^ But let me assure them
recent discoveries prove my assertions. One ex
ample alone is sufficient for this, viz. the discovery
of skeletons of the Stellar Cult type of man found
72



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
in the Pliocene strata in Lombardy. It is important
to remember that the skeletons found in this
stratum were of the modern type of man ; proofs
that they were Stellar Cult people were found buried
with them, as well as their osteo-anatomy : that
they lived and died at this period, and were not
accidental burials, we have Professor Sergi's author
ity—a most unimpeachable one. The Pliocene
strata v/ere formed at least 600,000 years ago.
The obstruction to the acceptance of the inductive
evidence on which alone a lasting knowledge of
ethnology and of the antiquity of the human race
can be had is the same which opposed the progress
of the science of Geology, and retarded for centuries
the demonstration of the causes which in the long
course of ages modified the crust of the earth

*' incompatibility,'' namely, '' with the chronology
of the Bible.'' It must be admitted by everyone
that there is much uncertainty as to Sacred Chrono
logy being correct, to say the least about it.
The thirst for power is never satisfied. It is
always insatiable, both in men and nations. When
Rome was the mistress of the w^orld, the Emperors
caused themselves to be worshipped as gods. The
Church of Rome claimed despotism over the soul,
and over the whole life from the cradle to the grave.
It gave and sold absolutions for past and future
sins. It claimed to be infallible in matters of
faith. It decimated America to convert the
Mexicans and Peruvians, and what is the Church
73



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
of Rome now ? Still carrying on the same old
game, or trying to, amongst a more enlightened
people. In rare instances the knowledge of im
mortality through a definite personal experience
has been obtained before death, and it has been
the priceless jewel obtained by the living of a
life in accord with the highest ideals of nature,
justice and morality of the individual, but never
by those ignorant and despotic men, those carping
critics, who have aggregated themselves into large
organizations and would by iron rule and despotic
power subject to their domination and control
all other humans and destroy all individuality.
Many men have it in their pov/er, if they really
try, to find out true religion and separate it from
the false ; so also have they then, when they have
attained this, the power to enter " the Mysteries
of the Ancient Egyptians " and to converse with the
spirits of the ancestors ; but the majority will not
try, and they remain forever ignorant and forever
outside. Therefore, how much reliance can be
placed upon those ignorant men who den}^ altogether
that which they have never tried to attain ? —yet
that is what the present human does. A man who
clings to sensuals cannot associate with spirituals.
A man who relies only on his common sense, on
his money-getting power, or on his mere energy
after good dinners, will never reach the higher and
spiritual planes, which, however, are not less
real because they are unseen of such. If we want
74



LIFE AND WHAT IT IS
the truth, we must labour for it quite as hard as
we labour for gold.
Most people cannot believe that the self-identity
of the individual intelligence (the spirit) can be
demonstrated this side of the grave ; but, as St.
Paul states, '' There is a natural body and there is
a spiritual body," and that is true, and can be
demonstrated by those who have learnt the
mysteries.
Knowledge of man's being is the highest of all
possessions, the highest of all knowledge, and
the know^ledge the world needs most to-day.
It is the knowledge with which men can do the
most good in all the activities of life.
These things shall be. A loftier race
Than e'er the world hath known shall rise,
With flame of freedom in their souls
And light of knowledge in their eyes.

CHAPTER III
SIGN LANGUAGE
Sign Language, the earliest of all languages which
Homo used, consisted of Gesture Signs, which
were accompanied with a few appropriate sounds,
which may be termed words ; but even before
man existed we can trace certain sounds or words
back to man's predecessors. The Cynocephalus,
for example, has eight or nine different sounds or
w^ords.
In this Sign Language they acted their wants
and wishes in expressive pantomime whilst wearing
the skins of animals— '' M37th-making Man " did
not create the gods in his own image.
The primary divinities of Egypt, such as Set,
Horus and Shu, three of the earliest, were represented
in the likeness of the Hippopotamus, the Crocodile
and the Lion, Ptah as a Beetle, Taht as an Ibis,
and Seb as a Goose. They are likenesses of powders
that were superhuman, not human. So it was
with the goddesses. Apt was imaged as a Water
cow, Heket as a Frog, Rannut as a Serpent,
Hathor as a Fruit-tree.
76



SIGN LANGUAGE
Totemism was formulated by myth-making man
with types that were the very opposite of human,
and in mythology the anthropomorphic repre
sentation w^as preceded by the whole menagerie
of Totemic Zootypes.
If primitive man had projected the shadow^ of
himself upon external nature, to shape its elemental
forces in his own image, or if the unfeatured
Vast had unveiled to him any likeness of the human
face, then the primary representation of the Nature
Powers (which became the later divinities) ought
to have been anthropomorphic, and the likeness
reflected in the mirror of the most ancient myth
ologies should have been human, whereas the Pov/ers
and Divinities were first represented by animals,
birds and reptiles. The Sun and Moon were not
considered " human in their nature " when one
was imaged as a Crocodile, a Lion, a Bull, a Beetle
or a Hawk, and the other as a Hare, a Frog, an
Ape or an Ibis, as they are represented in the
Egyptian hieroglyphics by means of the Zoot3^pes.
Until Har-Ur, the Elder Horus, had been depicted
as the Child in place of the Calf or Lamb, the Fish,
of shoot of the Papyrus plant (which was compara
tively late), there was no human figure personalized
in the mythology of Egypt. Mythology did not
spring from fifty or a hundred sources, as frequently
assumed. It is one as a system of representation, one
as a mould of thought, one as a mode of expression,
and all its great primordial types are virtually
77



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
universal. Neither do the myths that were in
herited and which were repeated for ages by the
later races of men afford any direct criterion of
the intellectual status of such races. Mythology
has had an almost limitless descent. It was in a
savage or primitive state in the most ancient Egypt,
but the Egyptians w^ho continued to repeat the
myths in Sign Language did not remain savages.
Egyptian mythology is the oldest in the world,
and it did not begin as an explanation of natural
phenomena, but as a representation by such means
as were available at the time. No better definition
of " myth " or '' mythology " could be given
than is conveyed by the Egyptian word " Sem.''
This signifies " representation on the ground of
likeness," which led to all the forms of Sign
Language that ever could be employed.
In the folk-lore of various races the human soul
takes the form of a snake, a mouse, a hawk, a
pigeon, a bee, a jackal, or other animal, each
of which was an Egyptian Zootype of some power
or soul in Nature before there was any represen
tation of the human soul or ancestral spirit in
the human form. Hence we are told that w^hen
twins were born, the Batavians believed that one
of the pair was a crocodile.
Mr. Spencer accepts this " belief " and asks :
'' May we not conclude that twins, of whom one
gained the name of Crocodile, gave rise to a legend
which originated this monstrous belief ? " {Data

presentations are mythical, and are not to be
explicated by the theory of '' monstrous belief.''
It is a matter of Sign Language. The Batavians
knew as well as we that no crocodile was ever
born twin together with a human child. In
this instance they were asserting in their primitive
way that man is born with or as a soul. This the
gnosis enables us to prove. One of the earliest
types of the Sun as a Soul of Life in the water is
a crocodile. We see the Mother who brings forth
a crocodile when the Goddess Neith is portrayed
in human shape as the suckler of the young
crocodiles hanging to her breasts. Xeith is a
wet-nurse personified whose child was the young
Sun-god. As Sebek he was imaged b}^ the
Crocodile that emerged from the waters at sun
rise. Sebek was at once the child and the Croco
dile brought forth by the Great Mother in the
mythology. And because the crocodile had imaged
a soul of life in water as a superhuman power,
it became a representation in Sign Language of
the human soul. We see this same t3'pe of a
soul in external nature applied to the human
soul in the Ritual of Resiirrectiori of Ancient
Egypt, when the Osiris in the Nether World
exclaims, " I am the crocodile in the form
of a man," that is, as a soul of which the
crocodile had been a svmbol, as Soul of the
Sun. It was thus the crocodile was born with
79



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the child as a matter of Sign Language, not as a
belief.
Mr. Spencer not only argues for the actuality
of these " beliefs " concerning natural facts supposed
to have been held by primitive men and scientific
Egyptians, which vanish with a true interpretation
of the mythical mode of representation ; he further
insists that there seems to be " ample justification
for the belief that any kind of creature may be
transformed into any other,'' because of the
metamorphosis observed in the insect world, or
elsewhere, from which there resulted '' the theory
of m.etamorphosis in general " and the notion '' that
things of all kinds may suddenly change their
forms,'' man included, of course {Data, chap. 8,
par. 557). But there was no evidence throughout
all nature to suggest that any kind of creature
could be transformed into any other kind. On
the contrary, nature showed them that the frog
was a tadpole continued ; that the chrysalis was
the prior status of the butterfly, and that the
Old Moon changed into the New. The transforma
tion w^as visible and invariable, and the period
of transformation w^as always the same in kind.
There was no sign or suggestion of an unlimited
possibility in metamorphosis. Neither w^as there
ever a race of savages w^ho did think or believe
(in the words of Mr. Spencer) " that any kind of
creature may be transformed into any other,"
no more than there ever were boys who believed
80



SIGN LANGUAGE
that any kind of bird could lay any other kind of
bird's egg. They are too good observers for any
such self-delusion as that.
Innumerable examples might be here set forth
showing how Sign Language was first used by
primitive man to express his ideas in Zootype form,
and then carried on by the Stellar Cult people in
their astro-mythology to represent the Elemental
Powers, and even still later into the Solar, before
he had formed language enough to express ade
quately his '' mental pictures," in terminology of the
present day. I trust that which I have written
{supra) is sufficient to enable my Brothers to follow
and understand the evolution that has taken place
in the development of nature's education of Homo.
If further information on the subject is desired
by any Brother, I would refer him to my friend
the late Gerald Massey's great work Ancient
Egypt, The Light of the World. No one since the
old Urshi of Egypt has so thoroughly expounded
the truths on this subject as he, and I have quoted
freely from his great work.

CHAPTER IV
CREATION AND EVOLUTION TO PYGMIES—PRETOTEMIC HOMO, WITH ORIGIN OF THE FIRST SYMBOL
" In the beginning, God created." We find various
tales of creation in many lands past and present,
but the so-called legends of creation would be more
correctly termed the Legend of Human Evolution.
In speaking of the creation of the human race I
shall confine myself to two kinds—the same as
you find in the V.S.L. The first was the creation
of Life caused by certain combinations of Series
of Corpuscles—the number and the series are
known to T.G.A.O.T.U. only—and a progressive
evolution of these from the beginning by an
increase both of numbers and series, until we find
the first Homo evolved from an anthropoid ape
in Africa. And it was in Africa that man was
first born, as I shall prove. Progressive evolution
to a higher type and state still continues, and
whatever man does—or may do—he can never
stop this. By ignoring and disobeying the Laws
of T.G.A.O.T.U. he may retard it in some famihes
82



CREATION AND EVOLUTION TO PYGMIES
or branches of the human race. The consequence,
however, is the destruction of that nation and a
set-back, to begin again, wherever this occurs.
But other nations— other branches of the human
race—will take on the progressive action, and, if
the laws made by man are good, will assist this.
The whole of this progressive evolution, as well
as devolution, is governed by the Periodic Laws
of the Corpuscles, which are God's little bricks,
with which He builds the Universe and all that
therein is.
We will, therefore, for our argument, begin with
the first human evolved—how many milhons of
years ago it is impossible to state, but his imple
ments have been found below the Miocene strata
(Oligocene), therefore several, at least. His imple
ments being there, he must have been in existence
at the time of the formation of the strata.
This first man w^as the Httle Pygmy. His
descendants are still found in many different
parts of the world—in South America, China,
Malay, New Guinea and probably other places

but the majority are still living in Africa, where
his original home was, and is, around and near
the Great Lakes at the head of the Nile.
The Pygmy is the lowest type of the human
and has the smallest brain of any man— 850 c.c.
The Pygmies have no records or traditions of the
past, no fetish or Totemic rites. They have no
Totems, no signs of tattoo scored on their bodies,

CREATION AND EVOLUTION TO PYGMIES
no rites of puberty, no eating of the parent in
honour of a primitive sacrament. They have
longer arms by i per cent, than the white man.
The hair, Ups, abdomen of the Pygmy are all
characteristic.
He has a language of his own— but a few words,
about 100.
I believe that I am the first man to prove this
to be true.
He speaks or communicates principally by signs
and symbols, i.e. a Gesture and Sign Language.
The earliest human language consisted of gesture
signs, w^hich were accompanied with a few appro
priate sounds, some of which were traceably con
tinued from the predecessors of man.
In this Sign Language, which was earlier than
words, they acted their wants and wishes in
expressive pantomime whilst wearing the skins
of animals that were pursued for food. Dancing,
for example, was a mode of Sign Language in all
the Mysteries. To know certain Mysteries implied
the ability to dance them when they could not be
otherwise explained.
The Egyptian wisdom registered the fact that
the Pygmy was the earliest human, because the
earliest divine man known in their m3^tholog3' is
portrayed as a Pygm\\
Following the Zootypes, the primitive form of
the Elder Horus was that of Bes. Bes is a figure
of the Child Horus in the likeness of a P3^gmy,
85



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
and Bes-Horus is the earliest form of the P^^gmy
Ptah. Also the seven powers which co-operate
with Ptah are represented as seven Pygmies.
Moreover, Ptah, the divine primitive man, is
the imperfect progenitor of the perfect man in
his son Atum or Adam.
From Africa the Pygmy spread all over the
world ; we know this because w^e find his imple
ments there, and some descendants in a few places.
He has a belief in a Supreme Being, and an after
or spirit life. He propitiates the Supreme Being,
the spirits of his ancestors, and also the Elementar}^
Powers.
One of the implements we use in the Lodge
originated with these Pygmies—the first that com.es
into operation when we open the Lodge, the gavel.
This was an original sacred sign and symbol

and still is— of the Pygmies, and represents with
them, the same as with us, 'the Great One, the
Chief, the Master. The Pygmy svm.bol in its
original form is this , just three sticks crossed.
But how many hundreds of years passed before the
original Pygmies were able to form this I do not
know. Following the evolution i of this symbol
we can trace its development into two or three
forms, which I will depict as we proceed to the
higher t3^pes of man.
The gavel, therefore, may be considered the
86



CREATION AND EVOLUTION TO PYGMIES
first and oldest sign, symbol or implement that
we use, and its origin was the sacred Pygmy symbol.
The Pygmies that travelled South from their
original home developed into the Bushman, and
these latter into the Hottentot. These inhabit
South Africa : they never came North, and never
left Africa ; none of their remains have ever been
found outside the southern part of Africa.
Those Pygmies that w^ent West, North and East
developed into the Masaba Negro ; none of these
Masaba Negroes have ever been found outside
Africa, but some of the original descendants are
still there.
All these are pre-Totemic and non-anthropoph
agous. The Masaba Negro in the West developed
into the true Negro. These never left Africa as
an exodus—onl}^ carried away as slaves. They
are still there, and are the true Negroes. No
higher development has ever taken place in this
branch of the human.
The Masaba Negroes in the North and East
developed into the Nilotic Negro, and this was the
branch of the human race that evolved into higher
types in evolution. The Bushman, Hottentot
and Masaba Negroes are the connecting links from
the P^^gmy and are found in Africa onty. This is
a positive proof that Man was evolved in Africa
and not Asia or any other part of the world.'
No signs or symbols that we use were evolved
^ See Origin and Evolution of Primitive Man.
87



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
or originated from these connecting links or from
the true Negro.
There is a great difference anatomically between
the Nilotic Negro and the true Negro.
With the Nilotic Negro came into existence
what may be termed " the Second Creation "

the cutting and opening, the making of men and
women. Hitherto all had been a promiscuous
herd ; now, at the inception of their Totemic
ceremonies, the boy was made into a man and the
girl into a woman. This is the origin and meaning
of the second creation in the V.S.L.
Thus the creation of man was mystical in one
sense and in another Totemic, i.e. pre-Totemxic
and Totemic—pre-human and human. By Totem
ism we mean the earliest formation of society,
in which the human group was first discreted from
the gregarious horde that grovelled together pre
viously in animal promiscuity.
It is in Totemism only that we can trace the
natural genesis of various doctrines and dogmas
that have survived to be looked upon as a Divine
Revelation especially vouchsafed to later times,
in consequence of their having, been continued
as religious Mysteries wdthout the guidance of the
primitive gnosis.
Totemism origina'ted in Sign Language rather
than sociology, the signs being afterwards applied
for use in sociology, as they were in mythology
and fetishism.
88



CREATION AND EVOLUTION TO PYGMIES
Ceremonial rites were established as the means
of memorizing facts in Sign Language when there
were no written records of the human past. In
these the knowledge was acted : the ritual was
exhibited and kept in ever-living memory by
continual repetition. The Mysteries, Totemic or
religious, were founded on the basis of action.
Thus the sign to the eye and the sound to the
ear were continued pari passu in the dual develop
ment of Sign Language, that was both visual
and vocal at the same time when the brothers and
sisters were identifying themselves, 7tot with, or
as, animals, but by means of them, and by making
use of them as Zootypes for their Totems
S9



CHAPTER V
EVOLUTION OF TOXEMIC PEOPLE AND ORIGIN OF SOME OF OUR SIGNS, SYMBOLS, CEREMONIES, AND EXPLANATIONS OF THE SAME
The first evolution from the Masaba Negro along
the Great African Lakes and the banks of the
Nile was the non-Hero Cult people, and from these
developed a higher type—the Hero Cult Nilotic
Negroes.
The non-Hero Cult people followed the Pygmies
in their migration all over the world, killed them
wherever they came into opposition, and drove
the others into the mountains, forests and not very
accessible parts, where we find them isolated at
the present day—because they did not follow
them there.
Later the Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes followed
the non-Hero Cult people and migrated in their
tracks, but did not war against them or kill them,
except the}^ had committed some act against the
Law of Tabu, but drove them away from the best
and most fertile lands and hunting grounds and
occupied these themselves.
90



EVOLUriOX OF TOTE MIC PEOPLE
The osteo-remains and implements of these
are found in most parts of the world where they
migrated— and the two classes can easil}^ be
distinguished from each other by their osteo
anatomy. Some of their descendants are still
living in Africa and other countries. Both the
non-Hero Cult and the Hero Cult— as example,
Australia, New Guinea, New Zealand, North and
South America, many parts of Asia and the Pacific
Islands—all practise Totemic rites and are Andro
phagi, or were at first ; a few are still.
These are the Totemic people in different states
of evolution, and their governments and laws
were, and are, pure Socialism.
Totemic Sociology, therefore, was the first kind
of government established by primitive man.
They believe in a Great Spirit, spirits of their
ancestors and Elemental Powers, all of which they
propitiate.
The curious and important fact I wish my readers
to note particularly is, that neither these nor the Stellar
Cult people, who were the next to follow them from
Africa, ever developed into a higher type of Homo
by evolution outside Africa. Only those who re
mained in Old Egypt of the Hero Cult people
developed by evolution into the Stellar Cult people,
and these by progressive evolution into the Lunar
and then Solar. All before the Hero Cult were
hunters only, but these in Africa began to tame
wild animals and commenced agriculture^ they
91



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
formed the primary towns by building huts of mud,
reeds and wood, built ramparts and dug fosses
around to protect themselves from wild animals.
Their brains w^ere increased to 1,250 ex., and they
developed their language to 800 or 900 words.
The two t3'pes of Nilotic Negroes are easily distin
guished by the evolution that took place in their
osteo-anatomy, as well as b}^ many ph3^siologicaI
points too numerous to enter into in detail in
this book.
Some of the signs and symbols we use originated
amongst these Nilotic Negroes. Bat please do
not fall into the error of thinking that these people
ever knew anything about Freemasonry. They did
not, but they instituted their Totemic ceremonies and
used signs and symbols in their sacred ceremonies
to represent in Sign Language what they could
not say in words, because at that early time they
had not developed terminology to express all their
ideas and the superhuman powers of Nature which
they had observed. The signs and symbols have been
handed down from generation to generation, and
that is why we have used them. We can now
express in words what were " mental pictures "
to them.
The penal sign in the First Degree is one—and
is still used by these Nilotic Negroes at the present
da3^ In all courts of justice in some parts of
Africa they make use of this sign instead of the
V.S.L. The}^ have never been known to break

their oath after using this sign. The sign used
by Brothers of the R.A. on entering their Lodge
was, and is, the same sign that is still used and
given before any member can enter their camp
when certain Totemic ceremonies are performed.
Another sign used in the i8° H.D.H.A. is one
that is always used by the Hero Cult people all
over the world—North and South America, New
Guinea and Pacific Isles, as well as in Africa.
The two Pillars, or two Poles, which they use in
their ceremonies
1.
representing with them
i«>
the North and South Pole Stars and the North
and South divisions of heaven, were the origin
of the S. and J.W. columns, and were the
originals of the two pillars at the porchway
entrance to all the temples in the world in the
Stellar, Lunar and Solar Cults, including K.S.,
as I shall prove.
These two pillars or poles still survive amongst
some of the descendants of the Nilotic Negroes
in many parts of the world— as, for example,
amongst the Arunta of Central Australia.' These
people have no North Pole Star, or North division
of heaven, but they still continue to carry the two
symbolic poles about with them, which they erect
^ See Spencer and Gillen, The Native Tribes of Central
Australia and The Northern Tribes of Central Australia.
93



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
wherever they go, as a sign of locality or encamp
ment, both of which are hmited to the North and
South. One is called Nurtunga ; this is the North
Pole of the two and is never aiet with in the
South. The other is called Warringa and is always
located in the South. The Nurtunga is typical
of the Northern and the Warringa of the Southern
part of the Arunta tribes.
Each of them, like the Egyptian Tatt pillars,
is a sign of establishing or founding— as is shown
from its use in the ceremony of " young men
making.''
The Nilotic Negroes knew that this was the
sacred sign for " The Great One " amongst the
Pygmies, and they converted it into two different
forms. First they placed the two sticks across
thus forming a double cross, and later added another,
thus , forming the treble cross. These are still
A
used in the same two forms by Brothers of the
33°. I give you the origins and can trace them
for you through all the Cults up to the present day.
It was a very sacred sign amongst the Hero
Cult people and is one of the symbols for their
chief hero.
94



EVOLUTION OF TOXEMIC PEOPLE
A second phase of the Pygmy sign was its
conversion into the Sacred Axe , when
stones took the place of sticks—as being more
effective in use—by the hafting in the first place
of a stone into a wooden handle and later forming
an axe of metal.
It represents amongst them " The Great Chief/'
sometimes called '' The Great Chief of the Hammer/'
and the Sacred Axe was another symbol for Horus,
their chief hero, and later for '' Horus of the
Double Horizon " or " Cleaver of the Way " in
the first Solar Cult.
Another ceremony, part of the initiation, called
the Bora, is practised by the Hero Cult Nilotic
Negroes, and is the original of our 3°, which
ceremony has been much perverted from the true,
but is more faithfully portrayed in part of the
18° ; all the members are pledged to secrecy.
The penalty for any breach of its rules is death.
'* A valley of death " is portrayed, and members
in two rows, armed with spears and clubs, etc.,
form an arch over a representative dead body.
(Photograph of the same in second edition of
Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man, p. 455.)
The initiate is conducted through this '' valley
of death " and has to undergo trials, etc. His
conductor carries implements of power and might
to ward off all dangers. As he arrives at each
95



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Brother, they say, " I will not let thee pass until
you give me the word," with threats of death.
The word is given as he passes each, and he is
conducted through safely.
It is a primitive symbolic and dramatic form of
passing through the underworld. He is initiated
into the passage of the dead to the spirit world

a Totemic form of the '' Abyss " of the Stellar and
Lunar Cult people and Amenta of the Solar in the
Eschatology. Another proof that the aboriginal
Austrahans were Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes may
be found in some of the words they use—for
example (in their " Snake " ceremony), " Ara Tapa
Tyiri ai," the meaning of which they have for
gotten. This is pure Ancient Egyptian, and means
" The chief of the Red Crown made, or constructed,
another burial-place for the Snake," and is repre
sented by the Egyptian Tem, who in one form was
symbolically depicted as a Snake, as the God of
the East—Tem-Asar in the East and Tem-Ra in
the West—and in the V.S.L. w^e see that Moses
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness (Num. xxi. 9),
showing that he was '' wise " in the Stellar Cult
doctrines and that the symbolism had been brought
on from the Wallunga Totemic ceremony.
These Nilotic Negroes were the first of the
human race to smelt iron ore and work in metals.
The Kavirondo and Gemi were the tribes, and
still are, who performed and discovered this and
carry on the art to this day. Their chief hero
96



EVOLUTION OF TOTEMIC PEOPLE
was called Horus-Behutet, or the Great Black
smith, one of his names. That— his name—is
the original word for the first artificer in metals,
and not T.C., which is a Hebrew substituted one.
They (the Nilotic Negroes) formed a society which
still exists amongst them and is divided into two
classes—the Operatives, i.e. the artizans, the
workers, and the Priests, who possess a secret
cult ; each was, and is, separate, but have some
signs and symbols in common. The Pygmies,
Bushmen, Hottentots and Masaba Negroes are all
pre-Totemic and, therefore, non-sociological.
The Nilotic Negroes were, and are, all Totemic,
and their form of government is Totemic Sociology

a true Socialism.
All may be classed as Palaeolithic, i.e. their
instruments were not polished. The Pygmies' were
chipped on one side only and they could not haft.
The Nilotic Negroes' were chipped on both sides,
and they had learnt the art of hafting.
The Hero Cult people travelled along the Valley
of the Nile, came North, and gradually evolved
into a higher type of man.
The Stellar Cult people were so called because
they kept their time by the observation of the
recession of the seven Pole Stars or Little Bear,
which later they named the " Seven Glorious
Ones." These seven have been brought on
through the Stellar, Lunar and Solar Cults
and into the Christian doctrines under various
97 G



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Pxames and types, and are the originals of all
our sevens.
Amongst the Toteniic people the seven Powers
were elemental ; these became divinized in the
mythology as children or sons of the old Earth
Mother under many names, now divinized as Apt,
uranographically represented in the constellation
of the Great Bear, or Ursa Major, and in the
astro-mythology became the Gods of the Pole
Star, with Horus in Ursa Minor.
In the Stellar Mythos the seven Powers are
symbolically represented by the seven Stars of
Ursa Minor, and are called the Seven Glorious
Ones with Horus.
In the Lunar Cult the seven Powers are the seven
Taasu with Taht.
In the Solar Mythos the seven Powers are the
seven Khammu with Ptah.
In the Eschatology the seven Powers that pass
through various phases, always in groups of seven,
are the seven souls of man, w^hich finally become
the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit.
Thus there were seven primary Powers in the
mythical and astronomical phases, six of whom are
represented by Zootypes and the seventh is imaged
in the likeness of a man. This is repeated in the
Eschatology, where the highest soul of seven is
the Ka-eidolon, with a human face and figure
as the final type of spirit, which was human
on the earth and is to be eternal in heaven.
98



EVOLUTION OF TOTE MIC PEOPLE
The Ritual states (chap. 85) : " My image is
eternal."
According to native traditions the eagle-hawk and
crow were first among the ancestors of the human
race. It is the same in the Kamite mythology.
The two primary elements were those of darkness
and light :
Set was the power of darkness ; Horus the
power of light.
In one representation, the two elements were
imaged by means of the black bird of Set and the
white bird, or Golden Hawk, of Horus, portrayed
back to back. These two birds are equated by
the black cockatoo and the white cockatoo as
the two Totems of the Mukjaraw^aint in Western
Australia.
Thus we can identify the two primal Elemental
Powers which are universal in mythology, and these
two Powers, or animistic souls, were divinized as
the two gods Set and Horus— that is, as the first
two Elemental Powers which became the non
human ancestors in mythology.
They are also known as the creators who divided
the Murray Blacks into two classes or brother
hoods, whose Totems were the Eagle-hawk and
Crow, and who now shine as stars in the sky.
These two Australian souls or spirits of the
two primary Elements can be paralleled in the
two souls that are assigned to man, or the Manes,
in the tradition of certain aboriginal races, called
99



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF I'REEMASONRY
the dark shade and the hght shade, the first two
souls of the seven in the Ritual. These, as Egypt
ian, are two of the seven elements from which
the enduring soul and total personahty of man
is finally reconstructed in the Mysteries of Amenta,
after death.
They are the dark shade, called the Khabsu,
and th^ light shade, called the Sahu.
In the Mythos, Horus is divinized as the white
god. The children of Horus are the Khuti in the
Stellar Cult, and in the Eschatology the Khuti
are " the Glorious Ones," which must be distin
guished from '' the Glorified," the latter being the
ancestors and once human on earth ; the former
were non-human or animistic spirits and powers
divinized.
With the Blacks of Australia the secret " wisdom '*
is the same as that of the Nilotic Negroes in Africa.
In the Christian Cult the seve.n have been brought
on from the Eschatology. These seven, as seven
periods of the world's existence, have been brought
on in the I8^ but the Ritual of this part of the
i8°, as given, has no meaning, the true gnosis
of which was the periods of time of the recession
of each star of Ursa Minor, to recommence or begin
again after the seventh had fallen dow^n in the
w^aters of space.
It is these elemental souls that have been
mixed up with the human souls by Hindus, Greeks,
Buddhists, and P3'thagoreans after the true gnosis
100



EVOLUTION OF TOTEMI C PEOPLE
of the Egyptian Mystery Teachers had become
lost and perverted, and mistaken for the human
soul in course of transmigration through the
series, which were but representatives of souls
distinguished as non-human by those who under
stood Sign Language. There is not, and never
will be, any transmigration of human souls, and this
is also where the translators of the Book of Enoch
have erred, " The sons of God who cohabited with
the daughters of men." The translator or writer
of this book mixes the seven Elemental Powers,
which were divinized, or the mythical gods, with
the human women, not understanding the Sign
Language of the Ritual (cp. Gen. vi. 1-4).
These Stellar Cult people learnt the art of polish
ing and were the earliest of what have been called
the Neolithic people.
The terms Stone Age, Iron Age, and Bronze
Age, which are still used by present-day scientists,
are very misleading as indicating the true evolution
of mankind with regard to time and types, because
even with the early Hero Cult Nilotic Negro, in
Africa at least, man had learnt the method of
smelting iron ore and the art of making spears and
arrow-heads. I leave it an open question if these
people carried on this art outside Africa. I have
up to the present time found no evidence that
they did, but only " chipped " their implements
on both sides.
Bronze was undoubtedl}^ manufactured by the
lOI



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Stellar Cult people. The proof of iron and bronze
having been used by these Stellar Cult people
(Neolithic people) may be seen by some of their
works cut on hard stones in the various temples
and the remains of the implements found in many
parts where Stellar people migrated, especially
in South America.
That we do not find many iron and bronze
implements of the earlier dates is not to be wondered
at ; it would be more surprising if we did, as
obviously these would oxidize and become ob
literated within a few thousand years at most,
wherever exposed to moist air and water.
No doubt many implements of stone were used
up to a very late date ; probably they did not
find the materials at first in the open country to
which they migrated, and so were unable to manu
facture an}^ metal instruments, therefore continued
to use primitive stone. Obviously the terms
Stone Age, Iron Age and Bronze Age cannot have
any true meaning with regard to the types and
times in the evolution of the human race that
these terms are supposed to represent, and are
absolutely illogical and misleading in such a sense,
and I wish to emphasize this in opposition to all
the Professors of the present day.

as the anatomical and physiological conditions
correspond with the various Cults, as well as
language, arts and sciences, allowing of course for
overlapping that took place in some countries
during the evolution from one to the other.
The distinguishing characteristics are absolutely
certain and non-misleading, as I have show^n
in this and other of my works.
Their tradition is that all descended from the
Mount, i.e. the Mount of the Pole, first represented
by the South Pole, when Set, or El Shadai, was
the name given to the Primary Deity w^hen they
dwelt South of the Equator, and after by the
North, when the name of Horus was that of the
Primary God and had replaced Set. As these people
who travelled North from the region South of the
Equator arrived at Apta, or the Equator, where
the two Pole Stars were seen to be equalh' on the
horizon, the two then were equal, and were repre
sented symbolically as two Eyes, two Poles, two
Jackals, and other dual types. As they still
travelled North, the South Pole Star sank down
in the waters of space and the North Pole Star
rose in the heavens ; then the North Pole Star
symbolized Horus, who became the Primary Deity.
This corresponds to the later Stellar and early Solar

Cult, as we read in the V.S.L., to Ihuh and Ihu,
the Egyptian Hu or Neb-Huhi, or Hebrew Ishi :
" Thou shalt call me Ishi ; and shalt call me no
more Baali " = Set (Hos. ii. i6).
This tradition of descending from the Mount
is one point of distinction from the Solar people,
whose tradition is that they ascended from below,
or from Amenta.
Here we find the true origin of H.D.H.A. as used
by Brothers of the iS"". The Stellar Cult people
may justly be said to have founded Old Egypt,
and divided it first into seven Nomes, or Domains,
with a chief or prince over each. The original
Nomes were allotted to seven different Totemic
Tribes, representing the Elemental Powers, and
were known by their Totems—badges or banners

as distinguishing emblems. As they progressed
in evolution, other Nomes were added, making
twelve ; later more. The tw^elve Totems or badges
of the Nomes are the originals of the banners used
by the R.A.M.
The Hero Cult mythology of the Nilotic Negro
was now evolved into astro -mythology by divin
izing the Elemental Powers and giving each a
star on high.
The types in Sign Language had been formulated
in Totemism, and were first employed to distinguish
the Motherhoods and the Brotherhoods, and re
applied to the Elemental Powders in mythology,
and afterwards (now in the Stellar Cult) repeated
104



EVOLUTION OF TOTEMIC PEOPLE
in the constellations as uranographic figures or
pictures, as modes of record in the heavens with
a view of determining time and seasons and
registering the prehistoric past. The stars were
used by the Egyptians to illustrate the mysteries
that were out of sight.
Their brains had developed and become enlarged
to 1,400 to 1,500 c.c.
In Totemism, the Mother and Motherhoods,
the Sister and Sisterhoods, the Brother and
Brotherhoods, the girl who transformed at puberty,
the mother who was eaten as a sacrifice, the two
women who were ancestresses, were all of them
human, all of them actual, in the domain of natural
fact. But when the same characters have been
contained in mythology, they are superhuman.
The Mother and Motherhoods, the Sister and Sister
hoods, the Brother and Brotherhoods, have been
divinized. The realities of Totemism have supplied
the types to mythology as goddesses and gods
that wear the heads or skins of beasts to denote
their character. The mother as human, in Totem
ism, was known as the Water-cow, and this
became the type of the Great Mother in mythology
and polytheism. But it was the type that was
continued, not the human mother. The mother
as first person in the human family was the first
person in the Totemic Sociology. Thence came
the Great Mother in mythology, who was fashioned
in the Matriarchal mould, but with this difference :
105



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
it is the human mother underneath the mask
in Totemism. It was not the human mother who
was divinized as the Great Provider in mythology.
Thus, the mother was human in the mask of Totem
ism and was superhuman in the mask of mythology.
The human mother might be represented by,
or as, the Totemic cow, serpent, frog or vulture ;
nevertheless they were not human mothers who
were divinized in those same likenesses as the
Egyptian Goddesses Isis, Rannut, Hekat and
Neith. But the human mother who was eaten
alive at the sacramental meal did supply a type
of the superhuman mother in external nature,
who also gave herself as a voluntary sacrifice for
human food and sustenance—the Mother of life
in death, who furnished the first eucharist that
was eaten in the religious mysteries. The human
mother had been an actual victim, eaten as a
sacrifice. The superhuman mother, or goddess,
was eaten t3^pically or by proxy. Hence she who
was the giver of food and life to the world came
to be eaten sacramentally and vicariously, that
is, in some Totemic victim, by whose death her
sacrifice w^as symbolically represented. There were
different types of the sacrificial victim at different
stages of the eucharist. At one stage it was the
Red Calf as the type of Horus, the Child ; this
same type was continued in the Hebrew ritual,
it was carried on under various types in different
Cults, and finally into the Christian doctrines.
io6



EVOLUTION OF TOTEMIC PEOPLE
Whilst some of these Nilotic Negroes carried
out the primitive wisdom from the same central
birthplace in Africa (at the head of the Nile and
around the Great Lakes) to the islands of the
Southern Seas and other places, and were fossilized
during long ages of isolation, those that remained
carried it down the Nile to take living root and
grow, develop, flourish and expand as the mythology
and Eschatology of Ancient Egypt : as an example,
'' the Mysteries of Amenta " are more or less
extant in the Totemic ceremonies of the Central
Australians, Arunta tribes at a rudimentary stage
of development, which means, according to the
present reading of the data, " that they have
retained the true origin/'
In the Mysteries of Amenta the deceased is
reconstructed from seven constituent parts or
souls in seven stages of development.
Corresponding to these in the Arunta Mysteries,
seven '' status-terms " are applied to the initiate :
(i) he is called Ambaquerka up to the time of his
being tossed in the air ; (2) he is Ylpmerka until
taken to the circumcision ground ; (3) he is the
Wurtja during the time betwixt being painted
for it and the active performance of the ceremony ;
(4) he is Arakurta betwixt the operation of cir
cumcision and sub-incision ; (5) he is Ertwa-Kurka
after circumcision until he passes through the
ordeal of fire ; (6) following this he is called
Illpongwurra, and (7) after passing through the
107



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF rREEMASONRY
Engwura he is designated Urliara. In the Mys
teries of Amenta the mouth of the resuscitated
spirit is opened and the silence of death is broken
when the Hps are touched by the sacred implement
in the hands of Ptah. It is said in " the ceremony
of opening the mouth," '' Let my mouth be
opened by Ptah with the instrument of ba-metal,
with which he opened the mouth of the gods "
(chap. 23). The Arunta also perform the cere
mony of opening the mouth by touching it with
a sacred object when the initiates are released
from the ban of silence. This is still practised
by the Roman Christian Church on the death of
each Pope.
The first act of initiation in the Arunta Mysteries
is that of throwing the boy up into the air. This
was a primitive mode of dedication to the ancestral
purity of the Totem, or the tribe, whose voice is
heard in the sound of the Churinga, or bull-roarer,
whirling round. It is said by the natives that
the voice of the Great Spirit was heard when the
resounding bull-roarer spoke. The Great Spirit
was supposed to descend and enter the body of
the boy and to make him a man, just as in the
Mystery of Tattu the soul of Horus the Adult
descends upon and unites with the soul of Horus
the Child, or the soul of Ra the Holy Spirit
descends upon Osiris to quicken and transform
and re-erect the mummy. Where risen Horus
becomes bird-headed, as the adult in spirit, the
108



EVOLUTION OF TOTEMIC PEOPLE
Arunta youth is given the appearance of flight,
to signify the change resulting from the descent
of the spirit as the cause of transformation. When
one becomes a soul in the Mysteries of the Ritual
by assuming the form or image of Ra, the initiate
exclaims, " Let me wheel round in whirls, let me
revolve like the turning one " (chap. 83). The
*' turning one " is the Sun-god Kheper, whose
name is identical with that of an Australian
tribe, Chepara (Kheper), as the soul of " self
originating force/' which was imaged under one
type by the Bennu, a bird that ascends the air
and flies to a great height whilst circling round
and round in spiral wheels [Ritual, chap. 85).
Whether this be the Churinga, the Bribbun, Turn
dun or whirler in a glorified form or not, the
doctrine of soul-making at puberty is the same in
the Australian as in the Egyptian Mysteries. In
the Egyptian mythology Horus is the blind man,
or rather he is the child born blind, called Horus
in the Dark. He is also described as the Blind
Horus in the city of the blind. In his blindness
he is typical of the emasculated sun in winter and
of the human soul in death. A part of this is
enacted in the 18'^. At the place of his resurrection
or rebirth there stands a tree, up which he climbs
to enter spirit life. In Australia, near to Charlotte
Waters, is the tree that rose to mark the spot where
a blind man died. This tree is called the Apera
Okilchya—that is, the blind man's tree— and the
109



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
place where it stands was the camp of the Wind,
the city of the bhnd, the world of the dead, in which
the tree of life or dawn was rooted {Northern Tribes,
p. 552). Should the tree be cut down, the men
where it grows will become blind. They would be
like Horus in the Dark, this being the tree of
light or the dawn of Eternal Day. In one of their
ceremonies the Arunta perform the m^^steries of
the fight before Horus and the Sebau, in a primitive
phase. The Chepara tribe of Southern Queensland
also perform the greater Mystery of the Kurigal,
in which may be identified the baptism and rebirth
by fire. It is the same in signification as the
Arunta Mysteries of the purification by fire. The
same ceremony is described in the Ritual as an
exceedingly great mystery and a type of the hidden
things in the underworld (chap. 137A).
A mystery of the resurrection is acted also by
the Arunta in the Quabarra Ingwuringa inkinga,
or corroboree of the arisen bones, w^hich bones
imaged the dead body, whilst the performers
represented the Ulthaana, or spirits of the dead.
The bones were sacredly preserved by those who
were as yet unable to make the mummy as a type
of permanence. Every native has to pass through
certain ceremonies before he is admitted to the
secrets of the tribe. The first takes place about
the age of ten or twelve years, whilst the final
and most impressive one is not passed through
until probably the native has reached the age of
no



EVOLUTION OF TOTEMIC PEOPLE
at least twenty-five or thirty years. These two
initiations thus correspond to, or represent the
origin of, those mysteries of the double Horus.
At twelve years of age the child Horus makes his
transformation into the adult in his baptism or
other kindred mysteries. Horus as the man of
thirty years is initiated in the final mystery of
the resurrection. So was it with the gnostic
Jesus. The long lock of Horus, the sign of child
hood, was worn by him until he attained the age of
twelve years, when he was changed into a man.
With the Southern Arunta tribe the hair of the
boy is for the first time tied up at the commence
ment of the opening ceremony of the series by
which he is made a man. His long hair is equivalent
to the Horus Lock. The most sacred ceremonial
object of the Arunta is called the Kanana. This
is erected at the close of the Engwura mysteries.
A young gum-tree, twenty feet in height, is cut
down, stripped of its branches and its bark, to be
erected in the middle of the sacred ground. The
decoration at the top was " just that of a human
head." It was covered all over with human blood,
unless red ochre had been substituted. The exact
significance of the Kanana has been forgotten by
the natives^—they do not know now. They tell
you it has some relation to a human being, and
is regarded as common to the members of all the
Totems. The m3^stery is made known at the
conclusion of the Engwura series of ceremonies,
III



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the last and final of the initiatory rites through
which a native must pass before he becomes a
fully developed member who is admitted to all
the secrets of the tribe.
This is the original of the Egyptian Ka statue,
which is a type of eternal duration as an image
of the highest soul. To make the Kanana, so to
say, the pole is humanized. It is painted with
human blood and ornamented like the human
head. It has but one form, and is common to
all the Totems. So it is with the Egyptian Ka,
the eidolon of the enduring soul. The name
of the Kanana answers to a long-drawn-out form
of the word " Ka '' as Ka-a-a.
The main difference betwixt the Australian and
other Hero and non-Hero Cult natives in various
parts of the world and the Egyptian Mysteries
is that the one is performed on this earth in the
Totemic stage of sociology, the other in the earth
of Amenta in the phase of Eschatology, and it is
in this latter phase that the '' Greater Mysteries"
have been handed down to us and left by the Solar
Cult people, to whatever country they travelled.
Also the Egyptians continued growing all the time
that the Nilotic Negroes were standing still or
retrograding. Lastly, we may be sure that such
mysteries as these did not spring from a hundred
different origins and come together by fortuitous
concourse from the ends of the earth to be finally
formulated as the Egyptian Mysteries of Amenta.

CHAPTER VI
STELLAR CULT PEOPLE AND ORIGIN OF OTHER SIGNS AND SYMBOLS—THE SEVEN LESSER
MYSTERIES — THE INITIATORY CEREMONYWRITTEN LANGUAGE—ANCIENT HITTITE IN
SCRIPTION TRANSLATED — ORIGIN OF THE OPERATIVE AND SPECULATIVE MASONS AND DIFFERENCES
Sign Language had so developed that the Stellar
Cult people converted their signs and symbols
into the Ideographic Hieroglyphics and so formed
the first written language. The signs and symbols
they had previously used to express things and
mental pictures now became the primary Ideo
graph of the first written language. The Egyptian
Hieroglyphics show us the connection betwixt
words and things, also betwixt sounds and words,
in a very primitive range of human thought.
There is no other such record known in all the
world. The government, which hitherto had been
pure Socialism, was also carried to a higher state
of evolution, and personal possession became pre
dominant and individualistic. National and muni
cipal control, where all was for all, had ceased,
113 H



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF rREEMASONRY
and the heads of the government were elected by
the people to carry out new laws, established for
the good of the community. They first formed
two kingdoms under the King of the North and
the King of the South ; ultimately these were
merged into one great kingdom.
They had observed and studied the laws of
nature, and founded a code of laws, as a result,
that no nation has ever improved upon since.
Here is one great lesson for the human race

i.e. Socialism and Bureaucracy cannot be set
up in any country now without the destruction
of that country following it.
T.G.A.O.T.U. will not allow such a retrograde
movement ; it is against His Periodic Laws,
which He has established, and these are immutable,
and any and every nation which attempts it will
always be destroyed, as they have many times,
the poor ignorant humanity having been set back
to a dark and degenerate age, to commence
again to climb the Ladder of Light. It will be
forever the same in any country where the ignorant
are put in office and allowed to try this primitive
form of government. These old ancestors of ours
had passed the stage of Totemic Sociology or
Socialism, never to return to it and live.
The Stellar Cult people now commenced to build
cities and develop a very high degree of culture.
The signs, symbols, and Totems of the myth
ology were divinized into and represented their
114



STELLAR CULT PEOPLE
gods and goddesses in their astro -my i\io\ogy , and
became the emblems of the attributes of the One
Great God.
This is the reason why it is difficult sometimes
to distinguish between Totems and tribes, repre
senting the mothers of the tribes and the Totems,
or emblems representing the divinized super
human Powers, as the same Totem or sign was
sometimes used for or represented each.
Many people have stigmatized these people as
worshippers of cats, dogs and idols, etc., and
still believe it, whereas they were no more wor
shippers of these than the present-day Christians
are of the eagle and lamb, which are often seen in
Christian churches as symbols of the Divinity.
If a sign or symbol represents the Great God, it
is not the sign or symbol they worship, but the
Great God.
The animals were first recognized as Powers in
themselves, but they were also adopted as the
living visible symbols of Elemicntal Powers that
were superior to the human, as a means of repre
senting natural phenomena. They were further
adopted into the human family as Totemic types,
with rehgious rites that gave them all the sanctity
of the blood-covenant and made them typically
of one flesh with the human brothers. The life- tie
assumed between Totemic man and the Totemic
animal, or Zootype, was consciously assumed, and
we thus see on what ground the assumption was
115



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
made, and the cause of a mystical relation
ship that was recognized between man and the
animals.
It would take too long to give all the details
and proofs of their progressive evolution during
the 300,000 years which is about the period of
time they existed, as far as my researches
prove by the finding of their osteo-anatomy and
implements in various strata of the earth and
rocks.
The Great Pyramid was built by these Stellar
Cult people, which proves to what a high degree
of knowledge they had attained astronomically
and mathematically —a knowledge which has not
been equalled by our present astronomers and
mathematicians. This is the greatest Masonic
Temple that has ever been built, and is emble
matical of their mysteries, is astronomically
depicted, and therefore belongs to " the seven
Primary Mysteries " (see Arcana of Freemasonry
and Signs and Symbols of Primordial Man), There
is a statement that they had worked out all their
astronomy for 40,000 years before they gave it
to the rest of the world, also a statement on parch
ment found under the corner stone of one of these
temples in the Great Foundation in Dendera, in
the 4th Dynasty, that '' the Great Pyramid was
built by the followers of Horus,'' and these Stellar
Cult people were the followers of Horus, just as
the Christians are the foUow^ers of Christ ; indeed,
116



STELLAR CULT PEOPLE
the traditional history is identical almost in every
particular, including the Crucifixion.
They sent out colonies all over the world, or
nearly all over the world ; the exceptions are
Australia, New Zealand, and North and South
America, where I have so far been unable to find
any traces of their remains. Of course, they may
have gone there and all traces have been obliter
ated by the many glacial epochs, which occur
roughly about every 26,000 years ; but against
this we find in these places the descendants of
the Nilotic Negro still existing, and apparently
they have never been driven away by the Stellar
Cult people, as we find in other countries. We
can always distinguish them by the remains of
their characteristic old temples and osteo-anatomy

not only in Africa, but in Europe, Asia, Central
and South America and some of the Pacific Isles.
They built their temples with huge polygonal
stones and the finest cement. But the principal
distinguishing characteristic was that their Great
God and all His attributes were portrayed by
iconographic pictures, i.e. Zootypes. These depict
not only the Great God and all His attributes,
but also the Elemental Powers. By many ignorant
people these have been called " idols," because
they have not understood, and do not yet under
stand, the gnosis of their religious ideas and
symboHsms, which was always portrayed in Sign
Language. The human type was not portrayed
117



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
as human until after the Stellar Cult. In the Solar
Cult temples the human type is depicted in the Stellar
Cult Zootypes.
The exoteric explanation given by various
Professors and books hitherto published is not
always the true esoteric representation, and this
can only be fully understood by following and
stud34ng the origin and evolution of the human
race and their Sign Language. It is to these old
Stellar Cult priests that we owe the origin of our
Brotherhood and the Lesser Mysteries—the old
Her-Seshta, or Wise Men of Egypt, self-designated
" the Urshi/'
They w^ere the first to cause the primary temple
to be built in Egypt, at Edfu. For their sacred
buildings they initiated a certain clan, or tribe of
men, called the Ari, of the seventeenth Nome of
Upper Egypt, who were the original Operative
Masons,
These builders w^ere initiated into the first and
second Mysteries only, so that they should keep
the secrets of the temples, and no others were
ever allow^ed to build or repair their tem.ples. The
Lesser Mysteries were at first seven, but only
two of these w^ere ever known to the Operative
Masons, past or present. There were two classes
of these operatives, called by the priests the
Artizans and the Companions. The Operative
Masons have divided the first and second Mysteries
into four each in recent years, the Blue and the
ii8



STELLAR CULT PEOPLE
Red. The first four " work with their hands
"

they are operatives of all kinds, the artizans
that are required in building. The second four
work " with their heads "— the architects, the
old original Companions, who draw the plans of
the buildings, etc., and see them perfectly carried
out. The Operative sacred signs and symbols
were given to them as a guide for this knowledge
—how to form and build with various angles,
circles and other figures, by which the Architects
could, by crossing in various ways and positions,
portray accurately the plans for the buildings of
the old High Priests (see Arcana of Freemasonry^
chap, xii, for further details). They were unac
quainted with, and not informed of, the esoteric
meaning of these signs and symbols.
When an exodus, or colony, was sent out from
Egypt—and we have it on record that they sent
colonies all over the world—a company of these
Ari was sent with them, accompanied by a priest
who was fully initiated into all the Mysteries.
At the present day the Operatives still have their
priest attached to their Lodge—he is never initi
ated in the Operative Lodge, but by a Priest's
Lodge.
When he enters a new Lodge, none of the W.'s
or D.'s have anything to do with him. Jachins
of the Priest's Lodge lead him to one of the Three
Masters, who gives him a " password " enabling
him to enter that Lodge at any time, and then
119



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
conducts him to his position in that Lodge. He
is never prepared as an apprentice and does not
receive a " bond," never pays any fees, and the
ceremony of his initiation is unknown to the
operatives.
He has a special sign which no other member of
the Operative Lodge dares to give.
He is the representative of the old High Priest
who accompanied the first and other exodes of
the Ari from Egypt, and who were the builders of
all the great Stellar temples that we find scattered
over many lands of the world.
The whole of the Rites and Ceremonies of the
Operative Masons should be the first and second
Stellar Cult of the '' Lesser Mysteries,'' but I
find much innovation has been made in later years
by the introduction of " Solar positions/' v/hich
may be accounted for, because these " Ari," after
the Stellar Cult, built for the Solar Cult people
in many parts of the world. These Operatives
spread throughout the world wherever the Stellar
Cult people settled, and afterwards with the Solar
Cult people. They w^re no doubt the originals
of all those Operative Guilds we find throughout
Europe in later times, some of whom established
themselves first at Rome and then in many parts
of Europe, during the dark and degenerate Middle
Ages, and finally in these Isles, where they ulti
mately formed the Operative Lodges of Masons.
The so-called '' Speculative Masons " of the present
120



THE SEVEN LESSER MYSTERIES
day, however, never originated from these, as some
Brothers suppose. In fact, about 600,000 years
ago these Operatives were initiated info the first
and second Mysteries by the Her-Seshta, who were
the originals of the so-called " Speculatives."
What I have written is critical proof of my
contention, and there are many other proofs, if
required. In this book there will not be space
enough to give all.
Our Brotherhood, i.e. the so-called Speculative
Masons, originated with the old Stellar Cult Her
Seshta priests, who instituted the seven primary
Egyptian Mysteries— called the Lesser Mysteries
—and these were founded on their astro-mythology,
the original mould being supplied by the Totemic
Mysteries of the more primitive man, the Hero
Cult Totemic people and their dawning mythology.
The Mysteries were a dramatic mode of communi
cating the secrets of primitive knowledge in Sign
Language, w^hich now had become extended to
the astronomical mythology, and to teach the
doctrines of final things.
Later, during the Solar Cult, ten more Mysteries
were added, which were Eschatological and were
called the Greater Mysteries or the " Mysteries
of Amenta." The difference between these is
that the primary are the Mysteries of Time, the
others the Mysteries of Eternity.
The Greater Mysteries were ten in number at
first ; later, two more were added.
121



ORIGIN^ AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
%.
The Lesser Mysteries in their origin were par
tially Sociological. They were the customs and
the ceremonial rites of Totemism.
The Greater are Eschatological and religious.
For instance, the transformation of the youth into
the adult, or the girl into a woman, in the Totemic
Mysteries was applied doctrinally to the trans
formation of the soul in the Mysteries of Amenta.
With the primitive races the Mysteries remain
chiefly Totemic and Sociological, though inter
spersed with religious sentiment.
The Greater Mysteries were perfected in the
Egyptian religion, to be read in the Ritual as
" The Mysteries of Amenta."
The mythological representation was first applied
to the phenomena of external nature, and the mode
or representation was continued and re-applied
to the human soul in the Eschatology. Many of
our signs and symbols connected with the
Mysteries and originating with the old Stellar
Cult priests I will set forth here, but there are
many more which we do not now use ; these have
been lost to the " Craft," although I am well
acquainted with them and their symbology.
I will first portray how the little Pygmy's sacred
sign and the Nilotic Negroes were brought on
into this Stellar Cult.
P
The Sacred Axe 1 (called in Egyptian Neier)
122



SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
was brought on in this Cult as a representative
symbol for the Great One ; and in their temples

the first of which were circular and afterwards
built in the form of a double square; at first two
cubes, and later three cubes—were always placed
in the centre of the Temple ; on each of these
TO P
cubes was engraved the Sacred Axe or
as a sign and symbol for the Great One. The
first represented Horus, God of the North, the
second Set, the God of the South, and the third, in
the centre, Shu, the God of the Equinox. This
formed the Primary Trinity. These were the
three primary children out of seven of the old
Earth Mother, now divinized as Apt in the astro
mythology, as Gods of the North and South Poles
and Equinox. This was also depicted by an
equilateral triangle placed on the upper cube with
the three names at the three different corners and
surrounded b}^ a circle.
Horus
Shu
We have no cube, or double or treble cubes in
the centre of our Lodges, but the Irish Brothers
have retained the original. Also the R.A. Lodges
have for their three G.O.'s.
123



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Another form of the original Pygmy sign was
its conversion into a simple cross—which was an
ideographic symbol for Amsu, or the Risen Horus,
or Risen Christ, of the Egyptians. It is the same
form or symbol as used by our Red Cross, so
famihar to-day [~ H^Amsu, the Stellar ideo
graphic symbol for the Risen Horus.
The two poles or pillars used by the
Nilotic Negroes in their ceremonies to represent
the North and South divisions of heaven and the
North and South Pole Stars, were now brought
on in the Stellar Cult as the representative symbols
for Set, God of the South, and Horus, God of
the North, and w^ere called the Set and Horus
Pillars, and were erected at the porchway entrance
of every temple (see Ritual), the same as we find
stated re traditional Temple of K.S. ; in fact,
no temples were ever built without them during
the Stellar or Solar Cults.
Josephus has preserved a tradition concerning
two pillars that were erected in the land of Siriad.
He tells us that the children of Seth (Egyptian
Set) were the inventors of astronomy, and in
order that their inventions might not be lost, and
acting upon Adam's prediction that the world
was to be destroyed at one time by the force of
124



SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
fire, and at another time by the violence and
quantity of waters, they made two pillars, the one
of brick, the other of stone ; they inscribed their
discoveries upon them both, that in case the
pillar of brick should be destroyed by the flood,
the pillar of stone might remain and exhibit those
discoveries to mankind, and also inform them that
there was another pillar of brick erected by them.
" Now this remains in the land of Siriad to this
day" {Ant., B. I, chap. ii). Plato Hkewise speaks
of these two columns in the opening of TimcBUS.
The place where the two pillars, or one of them,
traditionally stood was in the land of Siriad.
Where that is, no mortal man knows. But Seri
in Egyptian is a name for the South. Seri is
also the mount that is figured as the twofold
rock, which is equivalent to the two pillars of
the two horizons, South and North. Seri is also
the name of the giraffe, a Zootype of Set, the
overseer. Siriad, then, is the land of the South,
where the pillar " remains to this day." According
to John Greaves, the old Oxford astronomer,
these pillars of Seth were in the very same place
where Manetho placed the pillars of Taht, called
Seiread {English Weights and Measures). It is
possible to identify the missing pillar of the two,
the pillar of Set in the South. There was a
Southern Annu and a Northern Annu in Egypt,
and possibly a relic of the two poles may be recog
nized in the two Annus, viz. Hermonthes, the
125



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Annu of the South, and HeHopoHs, the Annu of
the North, the original meaning of Annu being
the place or pillar or stone that marked the founda
tion which preceded the sign of station or
dwelling-place.
There was an Egyptian tradition which connected
Set, the inventor of astronomy, with Annu, as
the original founder of the pillar which makes
him the primary establisher of the Pole. As an
astronomical character Set was earlier than Shu.
The Arabs also have a tradition that one of the
pyramids was the burial-place of Set. The pillar
of brick, being less permanent, went down, as
predicted, in the deluge as a figure of the Southern
Pole, whereas the pillar of stone remained forever
as an image of the North Celestial Pole, or of
Annu, the site of the pillar, in the astronomical
mythology. It is reported by Diodorus that
Annu (Heliopolis in the Solar Mythos) was ac
counted by its inhabitants to be the oldest city
in Egypt, which may have been mystically meant,
as Annu was also a city or station of the Pole,
the most ancient foundation in the northern
heaven, described in the Eschatology as the place
of a thousand fortresses provisioned for eternity.
The two pillars, therefore, of Set and Horus were
primal as pillars of the two Poles thus figured in
the equatorial regions as the two supports of
heaven, when it was first divided into two portions,
126



SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
South and North, and the pillar or mount of the
South was given to Set, the pillar or mount of
the North to Horus. The typical two pillars are
identified with and as Set and Horus in the inscrip
tion of Shabaka from Memphis, in which it is
said :
'' The two pillars of the gateway of the
House of Ptah are Horus and Set/'
Added to the first form {supra) four lines were
now drawn across the top to represent the Heavens
as a Square and the Earth as a Square, and w^ere
called in Egyptian Tatt and Tattu. The word
Tattu denotes the two Tatt pillars. Tatt is a
figure of stability and supports the four corners,
and is therefore equal to a square.
Thus the two Tatt pillars at the entrance ^ ^
are equivalent to a double square. Tatt
is the entrance or gateway to the region
where the Mortal Spirit is blended with
the Imm.ortal Spirit, and thereby established for
ever. In a later form the globes replaced the
square J [ , one representing the celestial and
the other the terrestrial world. Of other impor
tant signs and symbols which we use, originating
in this Cult, the first was the triangle of Set
=an ideographic symbol for Set, God of
127



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the South, and this triangle \ / followed, which
is an ideographic symbol for Horus, God of the
North. This latter symbol is still used by Brothers
of the 33^
The equilateral triangle represents the sacred
number three, first as the perfect number, secondly
as a symbol of the One Great Triune God, and
thirdly as the symbol of the three divisions of
hea\en, which followed the two divisions of North
and South by adding the centre as represented
by Shu.
Amongst the Hindus the equilateral triangle is
called '' Aum,'' which is the same as the Egypt
ian Atum, the Great God of the Infinite and of
All Things, the Everlasting One, and this has
been brought on in our sym.bolism as the triangle
with the All-seeing Eye under the name of
T.G.A.O.T.U.
7
Another form was V representing Horus,
God of the North, and Set, God of the South, as
the two brothers at the Equinox or Equator,
called in Egyptian Apta, or the highest land,
because here the two Pole Stars were equally
visible. They also doubled this symbol and
surrounded it by four Uraei ; it then was an ideo
128



SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
graphic symbol for the Khiu Land, or the Land of
the Spirits. When Horus became Primary Deity
they were merged into one as \/ Xy^ (called the
five-pointed star), representing Horus as God of
the North and South. It was also an ideograph
for the celestial world, or House of Horus, i.e.
Paradise.
The circle I I also originated with these
old Stellar Cult people, representing Heaven as a
circle and the Earth as a circle ; it also represented
an emblem of Eternity and the • in the centre
of the circle
[ o ) represented the All-seeing
Eye of the Great One, and equals the % or star at
the summit of the cone / \ . Another s3^mbol
was that of a coiled serpent with its tail in its
mouth, forming a circle, as an emblem of eternity.
All the primary temples were built in a circular
129 I



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
form. This can be seen to-day amongst the
descendants of an early exodus—namely, the
Chinese, Koreans, and old Japanese, who are all
Stellar Cult people, and that is the reason we
find so many signs and symbols identically the
same as we use amongst them—the signs and
symbols of the Stellar Cult Lesser Mysteries.
But of late years some of the Solar Cult people
and their doctrines have migrated into these
countries and so corrupted the pure Stellar Cult.
In these isles and many other countries we find
remains of old temples in the form of two circles

one North and one South—which can always
be distinguished from the Solar because these
latter are built with three circles, one North,
one South, and a third bisecting these in the centre,
proving that both of these people existed in these
islands long ago. The former represents heaven
as twelve divisions in the North and twelve
divisions in the South, a pre-zodiacal portra^^al,
and the Solar added twelve divisions in the centre,
making the thirty-six zodiacal divisions. Stellar
temples were first oriented South, later North,

SIGNS AND SYMBOLS
the Solar always East. Although the Stellar
Cult people formed and founded many great nations
throughout the world, they never advanced to a
higher type anatomically outside Egypt, but always
remained the same as at the time of their exodus.
This can be proved by their osteo-anatomy and
their remains found all over the world where they
travelled.
1=3 was also founded by these
The square
Stellar Cult people (Egyptian name is Neka),
and it was used in two senses amongst the Ancient
Brotherhood, as we use it. That is, it was used
by the Operatives to square the stones of the
buildings and by the Urshi in a moral sense. It
was the seat of judgment and the foundation of
Eternal Law^ in the Court of Divine Judgment,
and to build on the square signifies to build on
the fourfold foundation for eternity.
All the Stellar Cult people wTote in " glyphs/'
but their original hieroglyphics became altered
in process of time outside Egypt, on account of
the crude material they used, and their stylos were
not so perfect ; but to one w^ho has followed them
from their old home the transition states are not
very difficult to read and understand, even when
there is very little of the original left. As an
example, I give you m}' decipherment of a Hittite
inscription, the translation of which was unknown
until I published it.

of the North and the South, as seen portrayed
here, which proves conclusively that it was written
during the Stellar Mythos, therefore before the
Lunar or Solar, and before Menes, the supposed
king of the supposed ist Dynasty. The characters
are the old Egyptian hieroglyphics, showing the
alteration of the original ideographic and syllabic
characters which had taken place after an exodus
had left Egypt. All the exodes who left Egypt
and went to the East travelled through Asia and
then across America (Mexico and South America),
and retained the original hieroglyphic writings ;
but the characters became altered by time and
through being written by blunter stylos and on
cruder material than the Egyptians used, so that
ultimatel}^ there was ver}^ little of the original glyphs
depicted. All the later exodes (Solar) that went
up through the Mediterranean and Europe carried
out with them the linear alphabetical writings
which Professor Evans has named proto-Egyptian,
which writings prove that the old Egyptians had
already commenced an alphabet, which terminated
in their Hieratic and Demotic script, and finally
these were altered by time and circumstances into
our present-day writings.'
^ For an example of this form of writing see Arcana of Free
masonry, p. 224. I have given there a reproduction of the
transition stage of writing on ivory tablets found in the Tomb
of Naquada, now in the British Museum, and a translation
literally and ideographically of the same, never before trans
lated into English.

ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
The Cable T., the Hood, the O. and I.G. imple
ments of office and the 24-inch gauge, which was
the original old cubic measure, were all founded
by these old Stellar " Urshi."
The 24-inch gauge, or old cubit, is an ideo
graphic hieroglyphic, and has the phonetic value
of Maat, and indicated that which is straight,
and was the name given to the instrument by
which the work of the '' Craftsman " was kept
straight and measured.
There is also an esoteric meaning— a rule or
lavv% a canon by which the lives of men and their
actions were kept straight and governed. The
Ancient Brothers used the word in a ph3'sical and
moral sense as we do, as their naming it Maat
clearly proves.
Our Blazing Star, or '' The Bright Morning
Star,'' was the Egyptian " Sothos," and is first
shown in Zootype form as x\nubis, who guided
the souls through the underworld ; in another
type it represents Horus of the Resurrection.
In the Ritual it states :
" It was the Star of Horus, and his guide, which
led him to Paradise, where he seated himself upon
the Throne ; and then Honis gave his Star as a
guide to his followers.'' In one representation in
the Egyptian he is seen with the Star on his head,
beckoning to his followers. This is one proof that
our present Ritual originated from the old Stellar
Cult Lesser M^^steries, and has been brought down
134



WRITTEN LANGUAGE
by the Brotherhood through ages of time to the
present day.
The stars were used by the Egyptians to form
uranographic pictures on the canvas of the
heavens that were imperishable, to illustrate the
Mysteries that were unvisualized. The old Urshi,
knowing that if the secrets were written on books
of stone or papyri, in time these must perish,
but as depicted and portrayed, the secret gnosis
of the Mysteries would be handed on from genera
tion to generation until time on Earth would
be no more, thus wrote in Sign Language,
unintelligible to the ignorant masses, who would
have destroyed ^ther forms of record, but would
leave these, which were of "no value " to them,
because they could not read or understand their
symbolism ; which records were, however, to be
read and translated by future generations, for
a guidance to posterity of that everlasting truth
given by God to man. That divine revelation,
which has passed through so many phases and
is now preached as the Christian doctrines (without
the dogmas), was first promulgated to these Stellar
Cult people, and we Freemasons still continue it,
in its purest form. If all the Churches of every
denomination recognized knew, and preached the
Truth, we should have a pure rehgion which all
would beheve in, and a higher, nobler and better
type of the human would be evolved, with the
result that the brotherhood of man would be
135



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
more firmly cemented together than by any
other means.
There are many other signs and symbols which
I have given in Arcana of Freemasonry and Signs
and Symbols of Primordial Man, with full expla
nations, and which I need not repeat here, as it
would occupy too much space and time. The
Brothers cannot fail to see and understand wh}^
we find so many signs and symbols in various
parts of the world, and why the present-day
Stellar people still use them in their religious
ceremonies. They will only find the Lesser Mys
teries amongst the true Stellar Cult people ; and
when we find the symbols of the Greater Mysteries
we know that Solar Cult has crept in, and later
the Christian. But the old Stellar Cult Mysteries
have never ceased to be practised even up to the
present day, as may be seen in some parts of
Asia—amongst the Yezidies in the mountains of
Mosul, for example— and in some parts of South
America.
The initiatory ceremonies in the Lesser Mysteries
were conducted with the greatest secrecy and
care, as they w^ere also in the Greater. The
Candidates were divested of most of their clothing
and a chain or rope placed around their neck, to
signify their belief in God, their dependence on
Him, and their solenin obligation to submit and
devote themselves to His Will and service.
The fact that they were neither naked nor
1^6



THE INITIATORY CEREMONIES
clothed was an emblem that they were untutored
men, children of nature, unregenerated and desti
tute of any knowledge of the true God, as well
as being destitute of the comforts of life.
The chain or rope was a symbol that signified
that the Candidate was being led from darkness
to light, from ignorance to knowledge of the One
True Living God, Creator and Judge of all things
in Heaven and on Earth. The Candidate had
a hood or thick veil placed over his eyes, so that
he could not see, and was led by a Brother, called
in Egyptian An-er-f, to the door of the Temple
or Lodge, which appeared as a blank wall. At
the door or entrance was a ''Watcher" armed,
who said to the Candidate, " I will not open to
thee," '' I allow thee not to pass by me unless
thou tellest me my name." The w^ord was '' Shu
Si-Ra." (The answer, translated from the
Egyptian, was " The Kneeler," i.e. Shu.) He
was then given a password, v/hich in Egyptian is
" Ra-gririt "— " The door of stone." The door
was an equilateral triangle, a symbol typical of
Heaven, and a square stone underneath on which
he trod was a symbol typical of Earth. The
whole symbolized passing from Earth to Heaven.
He was then conducted through long passages,
through difficulties, danger and darkness, and
around the Lodge seven times ; during this he
had to answer various questions, words of pow^er
and might being given him. Finalh'^ he was con



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
ducted to the centre of the Lodge. He was asked
what he desired most. His answer was that
Light might be given him. Thoth, the recorder
of Truth, then removed the veil of darkness, and
he was invited to join and unite in the circle and
feast. If the Candidate turned back or violated
his obligations, his throat was cut and his head
chopped off, after his heart had been torn out
(see Ritual, chaps. 27, 28, 40, and 90).
The W.M. or High Priest was placed in his
chair with the same grip and token as we use at
the present day, except that it was the other
arm and the word was " Maat-Heru," meaning
" One whose voice must be obeyed." The present
is a substituted one, the meaning of which correctly
is " Stone squares.''
The Jewel representing the forty-seven Problems
of the First Book of Euclid w^orn by the Master
has no meaning, as it is explained to him. With
the old Brotherhood the correct meaning of it
was the triangle of Horus, and the three squares
represented the three Grand or Great Originals
of the Primary Trinity. With the Operative
Masons the three squares represent the first, second,
and third Masters of the Lodge.

CHAPTER VII
THE LUNAR CULT — THE SOLAR CULT—ORIGIN OF OTHER SIGNS AND SYMBOLS—ORIGIN OF THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES, OR MYSTERIES OF AMENTA—THEIR PERVERSION BY THE GREEKS AND OTHER NATIONS
After the Stellar came the Lunar Cult, so called
because they reckoned their time by the moon
instead of the stars. Not much evidence exists,
that I have been able to discover, of many of
our signs and symbols having originated amongst
the Lunar Cult people. They carried on and
made use of all the signs and symbols of the old
Stellar people, only using different terminology
for the names of the divinized Elemental Powers.
In the Lunar Cult, which followed the Stellar,
before the Solar, we find man first tried to portray
the human figure. The proof of this is in the
many " finds," both in Egypt and along the
Mediterranean Basin and also in Brazil, where
the Lunar Cult people travelled after they had
left Egypt and after the Stellar Cult people ceased
to exist there. The majority of the remains
139



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
found are those of part of a female, or child, only,
never the complete human figure. And parts of
these female figures are characteristic of the female
Pygmy,
In the Eg3^ptian Museum at Turin there are
Early Egyptian figures of unbaked clay, with decorations of animal figures (Zootypes) , date, late Lunar or early Solar. Similar are found throughout the Mediterranean Basin, Europe,. Brazil, and other parts of the world where the Lunar Cult people migrated. The types are taken from the P3'gmy women to represent the Great Mother, and this was prior to the Pygmy-man Ptah.

Ernesto Schiaparelli, and the Professor is con

140



THE LUNAR CULT
1st Dynasty. Undoubtedly he is right in his
opinion.
They are statuettes formed by the late Lunar
Cult people, or very early Solar, long before the
1st Dynasty.
I give some drawings here to show the first
attempts to depict the Mother-goddess in human
form—because it was the Mother that was first
depicted and not the Father ; the Father was
not symbolized before the Solar Cult. The Great
Mother had been portrayed in Zootype forms '
from the first Stellar Cult, as a Tree, or Cow, or
Sow^ or Hippopotamus, but now in the later part
of the Lunar Cult there is an attempt to depict
the Great Mother in human form.
There are two types of this portrayal that we
find all over the world where the Lunar Cult people
travelled— Europe, some parts of Asia, and South
America, as well as throughout Africa—and both
these types were taken from the Pygmies. One
is steatopygous, the other not, and I found these
two types amongst the Pygmies living at the
present time. This is a further proof that the
Egyptians knew and recognized the P3'gmies as
the first living humans, and tried to portray them
even before they did Bes-Horus, during the early
Solar Cult. These are not Bushman or Hottentot
women, because their anatomical differences prove
this. With the Bushman and Hottentot women

ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the labia minora have so extreme a development
that they hang down to the length of 15 centi
metres.' This is not present in any of these first
figures of the human race, nor is it present in
any of the Pygmy races wherever you may find
them, thus proving m}^ contention that the old
Egyptians first depicted the human form as a
type taken from the Pygmy, because they knev/
that the Pygmy was the first human evolved, and
that the first depiction was the female type, a
" mother." The figures found were intended to
represent Hathor, the Moon-goddess, and her child
Horus—the Great Mother, earlier symbolized as
a Cow with her child, Horus, as a Calf or Bull.
The finding of so many of these figures and bulls'
heads at Phsestos proves that the Minoan and
Mycenaean civilizations were principally during the
Lunar and first Solar Cults, and, therefore, com
paratively late in Egyptian history, as the Stellar
Cult had undoubtedly existed in Egypt for 300,000
years before the Lunar and first Solar. The
Cult of the Great Mother and Child w^as thus
brought on from the Stellar to the Lunar Cult.
No doubt, however, there was some overlapping
of the Cults during the Minoan and Mycenaean
civilizations—but the civilization was not prior
to the Egyptian, as many Professors state and
believe ; what I have wTitten is quite sufficient
proof against such a statement.
I See Origin and Evolution of the Human Race.
142



THE LUNAR CULT
The Mycenaean symbolism of the two hons
with the central tree, or the pillar, can be read
if followed as Egyptian, but not otherwise. The
tree, the pillar, or the mount was female, as a
figure of the birthplace, the place of exit for the
babe born from the mount, the Meskhen, or its
equivalent in Sign Language. She was the House
of Horus, and the House was imaged as a cone
or tree, or some other type, and this will explain
why the Mycenaean figure accompanying the
tree-pillar is at times a woman and at other times
a child. They are the goddess and her babe,
identical with Hathor and the child Horus in the
place of birth.
In the gold shrine found at Mycenae (Evans,
Fig. 65), the figures on each side are two doves.
The dove in Egypt was the very ancient bird of
Hathor, and the figure on each side is a dove,
equivalent to the mother and the child who w'as
born within her shrine, her house, her pillar, or
her tree, as the dove of the generative spirit or
the later Holy Spirit. The double axe of what
has been called " the Mycenaean Tree and Pillar
Cult '' is an emblem of the double power, and
the so-called god of the double axe is consequently
a god of the double equinox or double horizon,
who in a later form w^as Har-Makhu, the Horus
who passed into Amen-Ra of the Egyptians.
Various symbolisms of the Egyptians are found
in many parts of the world, which Evans and
143



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Count d'Alviella have given in their writings and
books, but the interpretation can always truly
and definitely be found by reading the ancient
Egyptian Sign Language. Without a fundamental
knowledge of the mythology and the Sign Language
as framework, it is impossible to comprehend the
doctrines of the Egyptian religion. In the Stellar
Cult the birthplace was in Sothos. Both the
Mother and Child met there, and this star
symbolizes the birthplace of Horus in the Stellar
Cult.
Following the Lunar came the Solar Cult, so
called because these people had found that the
time hitherto was not correctly recorded, and so
they changed and kept their time by the sun.
The Lunar and Solar people had developed to
a much higher type of Homo in evolution in Egypt,
as may be seen by their ph3'siognomy and also
osteo-anatomy.
They sent out colonies to many parts of the
world, and spread over Africa and Europe, some
parts of Asia, landed at Yucatan, in America,
and went South as far as the Southern portion
of Peru, exterminating the Stellar Cult people,
or imposing their religious doctrines upon them
wherever they were able to do so.
One of the reasons different types originated in
various countries and different types in evolution
was the intermarriage of these people with the
Stellar Cult and other women. (See Origin and
144



THE SOLAR CULT
Evolitiion of the Human Race for further details
and proof.) The Solar people added ten more
Mysteries to the seven previous ones, which they
called the Greater Mysteries. These are more
particularly carried on and practised now by
what are called the Higher Degrees under the
Supreme Council, but are much mixed up and
perverted from the true originals.
It w^as during the Solar Cult that the human
form was fully first portrayed, replacing the
Zootypes, depicting the G.G. and all His attri
butes.
The Stellar and Solar people can also be traced
by their form of writing. The Stellar Cult people
WTote only in hieroglyphics or glyphs, whereas
the Solar people began to form an alphabetical
writing, commencing with what Professor Evans
has termed Proto-Egyptian, finally developing into
the Hieratic and Demotic. An example is show^n,
with decipherment, on p. 224 of Arcadia of
Freemaso7iry.

typical and genuine, but I could not say if this

belonged to the Stellar Cult or primary Solar
people. I think probably the latter.
The Solar people used this in two forms ; first,
as the Hammer or Axe, the proof being that

the Hammer, or the Great Chief of the Axe, and

was symbolically represented as such in one form.
In still an earlier Cult, Horus was the Great Chief

Solar Cult, and was the same as the Samash of
the Chaldeans, Babylonians and Assyrians—the
Horus of the Double Horizon of Egypt, where his
name was Atum-Iu on the Eastern Horizon and
Atum-Ra on the Western, and is the same as
Ramman, God of the Axe, of the Syrians, Chaldeans
and the Solar Cult people of Central and South
America.'

This symbol ^^73^, called the Ru, or fish's mouth,
is an ideograph for " An." It was used in
Egypt as the symbol which represented the giving
birth to water, as the life of the world and the
Saviour, who comes as the Water of Life— thus
the whole symbol, supra, represented the Great
Saviour of Life, on whom all must depend. The

were blended together to form a s^^mbol for Horus
of the Double Horizon, thus V V , sometimes
with a circle round. This is the reason w^hy we
find the sign amongst the Druids, Hindus, and Jews
of the present day (it is also used by Brothers of
the R.A.D.). Their religious Cult is the Primary
Solar of the Egyptians. Why it was ever called
Solomon's Seal I have never been able to dis
cover, because it was in existence thousands of
years before Solomon ever lived, and is an ideograph
for Horus of the Double Horizon ; other names
w^ere Har-Maker, Atum-Huhi, In, Aiu, of Egypt.
Various forms of all' these signs and symbols are
found in the British Isles, as well as other parts
of the world, on ancient remains, but all originated
148



THE SOLAR CULT
in Egypt, as I have shown, and were carried forth
from there by the man}'' exodes that left that
old land. Wherever or in whatever part of the
world these are found, and under whatever termin
ology, we know that the originals were depicted
as Sign Language by primitive man, to express
his ideas and beliefs in the place of words which
he at first did not possess.

CHAPTER VIII
HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON AND EARLY SOLAR CULTS
HoRUS of the Double Horizon was the most
profound mystery, and the greatest secret of all
the Mysteries established by the old Urshi of
Egypt.
It is of the greatest importance to the Brother
hood that they should understand this in all its
phases, on account of the various and many signs
and symbols associated with this Cult, which came
into being during the progressive types occurring
through a long period of human evolution.
The numerous and different signs and symbols
which represent and portray Horus of the Double
Horizon and the wide spread of the religious
doctrine, found nearly in every part of the world,
could never be comprehended and understood
without a true knowledge of the evolution
which has occurred in past ages of the world's
history—the evolution of religious Cults of primi
tive man, v/hen he spoke and wTote in Sign Lan
guage, being unable to express him.self in present

day terminology, because he had not then developed
the articulate sounds necessary. Thus his ideas
and beliefs are all at first expressed in Sign
Language ; but not less true for that when
read correctly.
I therefore explain to the Brotherhood the
different types and phases that were employed
during the numerous stages of human evolution
to express '' one and the same belief or doctrine
of Horus of the Double Horizon " which has
existed from the first to the present day, typified
by numerous and different signs and symbols,
many of which we still use. This necessarily
must be in a condensed form, as the subject, if
fully set forth with details of all facts still extant,
would fill six large volumes, or more.

were South and North, representing Set and Horus,

(2) The next portrayal of the " Cult of Horus of
152



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
the Double Horizon " was as the so-called " Disk
worship," or the Cult of Aten.
The " disk " represented an emblem of the
circle made by Aten, as God of both Horizons ;
and Horus-Behutet, God of the " Hut " or
" Winged Disk," was the earliest form of Aten.
The word Aten, from At, was an ancient name
for the child who crossed from the horizon West
to the horizon East upon the vulture's wings,
an emblem of the Motherhood. His was a com
pound type of godhead, in which the mother was
dual with the son, who was her child on one
horizon and her '' bull or fecundator " on the
other.
The " hut " was a dual symbol of the divine
infant and the mother as bearer of the child.
As the wings, or bird, she carried him over the
intervening void of darkness where the great
Apap lay in wait. Thus the godhead of Aten
consisted of the mother, her child and the adult
male, or " bull of his mother," in the very primary
Cult.
Har-Ur, the so-called Elder Horus, is thus repre
sented as the child of the mother when she had
no husband ; hence she was the Virgin Mother.
The first Horus was also called Horus-Behutet,
or " the Great Blacksmith," and was symbolized
by the axe or the hammer, " The Cleaver of the
Way " {supra).
These " wings " {supra) are placed in the temples
153



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
of the higher degrees ; but I am of the opinion
that not any of the Brotherhood understand or
are acquainted with the true reason, either of
their symboHsm or why they are placed over
the western entrance of our temples. I now have
given it them.
The time that this first Cult was developed was
when Shu was added to Horus and Set to form
the Primary Trinit}^ Horus and Set were the
two gods of the North and South when the divisions
of the heavens were dual ; then Shu was added
at the Equinox to form a tripartite division, or
representation, as God of the Centre. In the next
phase Horus became supreme as God of the North,
South, East and West, and later this primary
Cult of Horus of the Double Horizon East and
West was instituted.
(3) The next phase of this Cult was represented
by Neith, on one Horizon, and Sekhet, on the
other, with the child Sebek-Horus, depicted sym
bolically by the Great Fish, or Crocodile, which
was reduplicated as two Crocodiles, to represent
the double power or dual horizons.
This is the reason and explanation why we
fi.nd Horus symbolically represented as a " fish
man," or " by a fish " (see later) in
YJ raany phases of this Cult. I give here
the Christian symbolic representation
of the White Vulture of Neith of the
Eg3^ptians as seen in the 18^ (sixteenth century).
154



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
In the Egyptian representation she is depicted
as suckhng the two Crocodiles (the Christian is
the Pehcan feeding her young from her own
blood). She was the second representation of
the Virgin Mother— both forms were founded
during the Stellar Cult and portrayed in Sign
Language.
To read this Sign Language correctl}^ we must
go back to the time when the autumn Equinox
occurred in Virgo— that was the place of concep
tion of Sebak, the fish of the inundation. Six
months later the sun rose in the sign of Pisces,
and in the eastern Equinox, when the Jish as child
and consort, or as the two Crocodiles, became the
two fishes with Xeith as the Mother on one horizon
and Sekhet on the other. Thus the virgin Neith
conceived her child Sebek-Horus, the fish of the
inundation, which was duplicated to express the
adultship, and they were the tw^o typical fishes,
or the two Crocodiles. The Crocodile-headed Sebek
as the child attributed to Neith in Virgo swims
across the \\ aters of darkness, or the abyss of waters,
to rise up in the East as Horus of the Twofold
Horizon.
This is the reason why we find Horus repre
sented as a " fish man " or by a fish in many phases
of Horus of the Double Horizon, the same as
the Gnostic Jesus, and also in our present Cult.
I reproduce here a beautiful photograph of
Horus standing on two Crocodiles, from Egypt.

ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
He is here symbolized as Horus of the Double
or Dual Power or Dual Horizons. The " lock of
hair " typifies him as the child of twelve on one
Horizon, and the " Head of Bes " shown above
signifies him as the man of thirty years on the
other.
Thus we perceive how evolution continued as
man advanced to a higher plane. First the
Pygmies believed in a Supreme or Great Spirit,
whom they could not define or comprehend but
imaged or symbolized by ^ , which became a
r
representation of the Great Spirit in Sign Lan
guage.
In the next phase the Nilotic Negroes, who be
lieved in the same Great Spirit, attributed two
primal elemental powers or spirits to Him—Light
and Darkness, thus representing or believing Him
to be a Dual form, or a Dual God, i.e. God of
Light and God of Darkness, as w^ell as God of the
North and God of the South, and they imaged this
by symbolizing Him as two Birds—one Black,
the other White. Later they added the elemental
force or spirit of " Breath of Life or Force of Wind,'*
and symbolized or imaged this by a panting or
roaring Lion. Thus the Primary Trinity, or a
Great Spirit with three attributes of the elemental
powers, was first portrayed, imaging Him as God of
Darkness, God of Light, and God of the Breath
of Life, as well as the God of the North, God of the
156

HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
South, and God of the Centre. In this figure of
Horus of the Double Power we find a still further
advancement, that is, He is here represented as the
God of the Eastern and Western Horizons and a
God of the Double Force, as well as the God of the
North and South. He is also represented by sym
bolism as the young Child, representing the Spirit
of life in the young Shoot, or the young Fish, or
Bird, or Lamb, or other types of " rebirth of Spirit
life," also as the adult man, as typified by the head
of Bes or Ha'r-Ur, as representing the full develop
ment of the Spirit of the Fish, or Shoot, or Tree,
or Fruit, or other types. These attributes were the
lemental Nature powers or Spirits of Nature, which
were visible and cognizant to them, and they
objectified the same by this imagery of S3'mbolism
in Sign Language when they had not the termino
logy to express their ideas and beliefs otherwise.
In no land or literature has the Mythical mode of
representation been perverted and reduced to drivel
ling foolishness more fatally than in some of the
Hebrew legends, such as that of Jonah and the
great fish, which is connected with the origin of
the fish-man in the mythology, who was born of a
fish-mother, identifiable with the constellation of
the Southern fish and Horus of the inundation,
and brought on as types, as Horus of the Double
Power. The most ancient type of the fish was
female, as a representation of the great Mother
Earth in the water.
157



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
This as Egyptian was the Crocodile. She was
the suckler of Crocodiles in the inundation. She
was the bringer-forth as the great Fish or Crocodile
in the Astronomical-Mythology. One of her chil
dren was the Crocodile-headed Sebek, who made
the passage of the Nun by night, typified as the
Child Horus in Solar Mythos. The fish-man was
at first the Crocodile of Egypt, next the Crocodile
headed figure of Horus, who is called " the Crocodile
God in the form of a man " {Ritual, ch. 88).
The conversion of the crocodile god in the Nun
to the fish-man of Babylonia was thus made. Jonah
is a form of the fish-man in the Babylonian story
(which is neither Mythology nor Eschatology), and
therefore a figure of both the Stellar and Solar
God who made the passage of the waters as Horus
the Crocodile, or as Ea the fish-man of Nineveh.
Birth or rebirth, from the great fish in the Lower
Nun, is one of the oldest traditions of the race.
It was represented in the Mysteries and constellated
in the heavens as a means of Memorial in Sign
Language.
The Astronomical Cult of Egypt passed into
Akkad and Babylonia with the exodus of the
Stellar Cult race, some of which were termed the
Cushite "black-heads" —to become the wisdom
of the Chaldees and the Persian Maji in after ages
one of the types.
I produce here a picture of Gilgames, the
so-called Fire God of the Accadians.
158



The so-called Accadian Fire God.






HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
These people had left Egypt as an exodus during
the Stellar Cult, but the earlier Solar was brought
into the country by a second exodus, with the old
Egyptian Laws up to date, as witnessed by the
stale of Hammurabi. We see here portrayed
Gilgames strangling a lion and serpent— the same
as the Egyptian Horus, except that the fauna
has been differently portrayed. But the symbol
ism of the God of the Double Power is the same.
They, however, have omitted the two Crocodiles,
or tw^o fishes, as the symbolic power for the trans
mission from the Horizon West to East. The
reason was because they had forgotten the old
Sign Language, and had converted the Crocodile,
which was a type of good and beneficent power
in Egypt, into one of bad omen here in Accadia.
But the Cult remaiaed the same.
I give on the next page the South American
portrayal of Horus of the Double Horizon to prove
how^ widespread this Cult was throughout the
world.
The symbolism portrayed here is Horus strang
ling serpents— one in each hand, signifying the
Double Power.
The Egyptian ideograph for the Horizon is
in two parts— one on the right, the other
on the left, attached to the lower part of the
serpents.
The name lu is shown in Egyptian hierogl3^phics
attached to his head.
159



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Below we have the representative symbol of
the fauna of the country for the Mother-Goddess
typified as a bird, with the ideographic Egyptian
hieroglyphic for Egypt at the posterior part or
base of the head.
This, as in the Lunar symbolism, represents the

great monohthic gateway at Tiahuanaco—Horus of the Egyptians,
stranghng serpents. [Drawn by K. Watkins.)
Mother and her child of the Double Power or
Double Horizon.

darkness between the two, to show the passage
he has to make. Tears are in his eyes {" Ye
are the tears," etc.).
His name, lu, is placed in front of his head,
attached to his crown, and is an Egyptian ideograph
for his name.
(4) In the next portrayal, which was during
the Lunar Cult, also depicted in Sign Language,
one of the representations was the Moon-goddess
Hathor, as a Cow, and Horus as her young Calf,
as her child on one Horizon and as her Bull on
the other (see supra).
The passage from West to East was through
the Mountain of the West that had been imaged
as a passage through the cow of earth.
In the Egyptian Mythos, Tum makes his passage
through the Mount by means of the cow and is
reborn as Tem, the little child, from the Khepsh
of the cow Meh-ur. It is said of him, in setting
161 L



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
forth from the Western Horizon, " Earth stretches
her arms to receive thee/'
He (Tem) is embraced by the Mother, whose
womb is the Meskhen of rebirth, and at his coming
forth to the Eastern Horizon it is said, '' Thou
hast rested in the cow, thou hast been imm.erged
in the cow Meh-ur " (inscription of Darin, hnes
27-28).
(5) The next portrayal was during the Solar
Mythos. In this Solar Cult there were several
phases following one upon the other, principally
showing how the Fatherhood was substituted for
the Motherhood.
Hitherto, from the first inception of religious
doctrines, the Matriarchal type had been the first
and primary, founded on the Totemic ceremonies
of primitive man, originating with ]\Iother Earth,
followed by the Mother of the tribe when the
Father was not known or not recognized, and
astronomically depicted in the Stellar— all S3'mbol
ized in Zootype forms.
Now, in the Solar Cult, the Fatherhood was
recognized and took the place of the Motherhood,
as the primary representation and as the first
person in human form, although during the first
phases of the Mythos the symbolic representation
was partially continued.
(6) In the fi.rst Solar it was the Cult of Atum-Iu,
or Aiu, or lou, and manv other names for the
same one.
162



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
The representation was Atum-Iu as the child
of twelve on one Horizon and Atum-Ra as the
Father on the other. This was symbolized by
the little autumn sun conceived upon the Western
Horizon or Mount, and adultship was attained
on the Eastern Horizon with what was termed
the double force.
The little sun, or other types, typified the child
Horus of twelve years and entered the Western
Mount " at the beautiful gate of entrance in the
West/' for symbolic breeding purposes, and rose
again as the great sun, or other types, representing
the adult Horus of thirty years, when the godhead
consisted of the Mother, the child and the divine
adult.
(7) The next form of the Cult w^as symbolized
by the Sphinx.
The Sphinx is a representative image of the god
Har-Makhu. We learn from the Ritual that the
Mystery of the Sphinx originated, or represented,
the Mount of Earth, as the place of passage, of
burial and rebirth for Horus as the Solar God.
It v/as made as the means of crossing for Horus
of the two Horizons or the Double Equinox, and
as such w^as assigned to Atum-Harmachis.
Harmachis entered the Sphinx at sunset in the
West or hinderpart, and was reborn in the East
as Horus of the fore-part, lion-faced, as repre
senting the double force, the transformer being
Kheper. The means of crossing the dark gulf in
163



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the Solar Mythos was now the bridge of death,
and the mode of uniting the two worlds in one
when the re-arising of the sun was succeeded by
the resurrection of the soul ; the Hon having been
adopted for the Sphinx upon the Horizon East
as an emblem of the double power, the Sphinx
being made male in front and female in the hinder
part. It is a compound image of the Mother
Earth and the young god whom she brought forth
upon the Horizon of the resurrection. Without
the Mother there was no rebirth.
Har-Makhu crossed from one Horizon to the
other through the hollow body of the Sphinx, the
Sphinx being imaged in a twofold type, with its
tail to the West and its head to the East, pointing
to the Equinox each way.
The Divine Fatherhood was developed from
Har-Makhu, who became the great god Ra in his
primordial sovereignty. In this phase we find the
double Harmachis, the Sun-god of the Twofold
Horizon, who claims a divine origin, or the virgin's
child that was not begotten by God the Father.
Horus of the Double Horizon was also typified
as Horus of the Two Lions. In the Ritual, Horus
rises again, saying, " I am the twin Hons, the
heir or Ra " (chap. 38, i ; chap. 62, 2), " I am the
double lion'' (chap.- 72, 9).
(8) The next portrayal comes into viev/ at the
time of the supposed ist Dynasty, when Ptah was
the representative of the Great God at Memphis,
164



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
and was called the Great Architect of the Universe,
but not the universe as a cosmological creation.
Hitherto the stars had been used by the
Egyptians to form uranographic pictures on the
canvas of the heavens, which was imperishable,
to illustrate the Mysteries that were un
visualized.
The old Urshi knew that, if the secrets were
written on '' Books of Stone," in time these must

perish, but as depicted and portrayed, the sacred
gnosis of the Mysteries would be handed on from
generation to generation, until time on earth
w^ould be no more, and so thus wrote them in
uranographic Sign Language, unintelligible to the
ignorant masses, who would have destro^'ed other
forms of record, but would leave these, which
165



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
were of no value to them, because they could not
read or understand this Sign Language, but which
records were to be read and translated by future
generations for a guidance to posterity.
Now, Ptah created Amenta vvith his seven
Pygmies or Powers, the hollowing out of the earth
as a tunnel for the heavenly bodies and the manes,
which were now to make the passage through
instead of around the Mount of Earth. This was
not a real tunnel, but a primitive mode of thinking
through the solid earth— an ideographic repre
sentation. It was a lower world through which
all the manes had to pass figuratively.
Horus now becomes the Chief of the two Lands
and the two Earths, and wears the double diadem
as ruler of the double earth, and is now the
" traverser of the two earths," as well as the
uniter of the two horizons.
The foundation of the Fatherhood was laid when
the various powers (now nine in all) were combined
in a single Deity to be worshipped as the One
True Eternal Spirit.
These were primarily the Great Mother and her
seven Elemental Powers. When the goddess was
superseded by the god Ptah, both sexes were
included in the one Supreme Being, who was
now the Lord over all.
Ptah became the god who was born of his own
becoming, or of his own self-originating force,
who came into existence in the person of his own
i66



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
son as a mode of representing the eternal manifest
ing in the sphere of time.
The male had been substituted for the Mother
as the begetter in matter, symbolized by Kheper
as a male beetle, as a type of divine parent as
Kheper-Ptah, and the female now became sub
sidiary to the male. Kheper-Ptah is now called
" the Creator of all things that came into being."
Ptah is God the Father in one character and
lu the Son in another.
(9) The Cult that followed this was that of
Amen at Annu, where Amen was the one god in
the two characters of Father and lu the Son.
In the Cult of Ptah both characters of Father
and Son were combined in one god, and so it was
in this Cult—the one the Father and the ever
coming son.
(10) The Osirian Cult, the 10°, followed this,
and Amenta in one aspect became the world of
the dead, the Kasu or burial-place in the Osirian
Cult, and Horus the son of Osiris takes the place
of Amen or Nefer Horus of the previous Cult.
The Eschatology followed this Cult.
Horus in the Eschatology was he who died and
was buried and rose again in spirit at his second
advent in human form. This time he was imaged
in the likeness of his Father, as the beloved and
only begotten Son of God, who manifested as the
fulfiller of His Word and the doer of His Will.
In the Eschatology, Ra became the Great God
167



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
in Spirit, as the Holy Spirit Father. The two
types in this way were deposited and made per
manent in Horus, the child of twelve years, and
Amsu-Horus, the man of thirty years.
The Christian doctrines arose out of the ashes
of this.
The Cult of Atum-Iu lasted about 20,000 years
or more.
That of the Sphinx lasted about 10,000 years.
That of Ptah lasted about 9,000 years.
That of Amen lasted about 20,000 years.
That of Osiris lasted about 20,000 years.
The Eschatology about 20,000 years.
The other phases of duality not mentioned
above are :
Tum as the Father, Tem as the son.
Amen-Ra as the Father, Nefer-Atum as the
son.
Huhi the eternal God the Father, lu the son.
Osiris the Father, Horus the son.
Ihuh the eternal Father, lah the son.
leou the Father, lao the son.
Ihuh the Father, Jesus the son.
Jehovah the Father, Jesus the son.
One must not forget the overlapping that took
place in all these Cults.
Many Egyptologists still think and believe that
before " prehistoric 'times " the Egyptians had
never promulgated any spiritual conceptions, in
our sense of the word. That is a fallacy ; they
168



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
had, but they could only depict it in Sign Lan
guage, because they had not the same terminology
as we use to-day.
Dr. Wallis Budge states : " Although his [the
Egyptian's] ideas were very definite as to the reality
of a future existence, I think that he had formulated
few details about it, and that he had no idea as to
when or how it was to be enjoyed " {History of
the Book of the Dead, xxxix). The facts found
recorded do not bear out Dr. Budge's opinion ;
evidently Dr. Budge cannot read and understand
Sign Language, because, if he could, it would be
impossible for him to make such a statement
truthfully.
The Book of the Dead or The Ritual of Resurrec
tion of Life, as we have it, is principally concerned
with the Osirian Cult, which was very late in the
history of Egypt, yet the original was all written
before the ist Dynasty, although edited several
times after.
There are many passages and chapters (17 and
64, for instance) wherein the Stellar and Lunar
Cults are plainly indicated and their beliefs at
that remote age.
The later Scribes or old Priests had forgotten
the previous wisdom, much of which was passed
on orally and all the rest written in Sign Language,
but from the earliest times of the Stellar Cult
the doctrine of the immortality of the soul and
an after-life was most profoundly believed in and
169



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
worked out, and this was founded in the first
place on the faculty of " seership." They had
learnt the gnosis of how to communicate with
their loved ones who had departed this earthly
life, yet they never mourned them, or wept for
them, but rejoiced at the time of death, because
they knew that the}^ lived again, at least all those
who had Hved a good life here on this earth.
Their " Amenta " or underworld was founded
upon the facts that they had ascertained from
their departed, and the smallest incidents are left
recorded as to what the spiritual body of the
departed had to undergo before entering the final
Paradise ; and only those who had attained that
great end were permitted to return and visualize
themselves to their friends. These old Wise Men
of Eg3^pt did not make any mistake about that

their records prove it ; and to one who has
learnt and followed this gnosis and " The Periodic
Laws,'' as I have, I have not the slightest hesita
tion in confirming their beliefs. The materialists
of the present day can never obtain that gnosis,
because they have never tried to learn, and there
fore will for ever remain in dark and dense ignorance
on the greatest subject which is most material to
their future existence ; but it is none the less
true, notwithstanding their unbelief, or ignorance,
of The Book of Everlasting Life—the oldest in
the world.
For the proof of my contention, Egypt has
170



HORUS OF THE DOUBLE HORIZON
spoken with no uncertain voice, and this is found
written in the Book of the Dead of Nesi-Khonsu
(a priestess of Amen).
For the information of the Brotherhood I will
give a translation of part of this remarkable docu
ment, as far as concerns our present subject matter :
*' This holy God, the lord of all the Gods,
Amen-Ra, the lord of the throne of the two lands,
the governor of Apt ; the holy soul who came
into being in the beginning, the great God who
liveth by Maat ; the first divine matter which
gave birth unto subsequent divine matter, the
being through whom every (other) God hath
existence ; the One one who hath made every
thing which hath come into existence since
primaeval times w^hen the world was created
;
the being whose births are hidden, whose evohi
tions are manifold, and whose growths are tmknown ;
the holy Form, beloved, terrible, and mighty in
his risings ; the lord of w^ealth, the power,
Khepera, who created every evolution of his exist
ence, except whom, at the beginning, none other
existed ; who at the dawn in the primcBval was
Atennii {A ten), the prince of ra3''s and beams of
light, who, having made himself (to be seen),
caused all men to live."
The above comprises only a few lines translated,
but all the Brotherhood can see and read the
original, which still exists and has been translated
by Maspero and Budge.
171



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
The first point of interest in the above is the
reference to Apt, the old Earth-Mother, who was
divinized in the astro-mythology, and from whom
proceeded the seven Elemental Powers—the seven
Primary Gods, etc., and who now had been super
seded as the Primary One (of Matriarchal type)
by the Fatherhood.
Secondly, we have distinctive evidence of the
profound knowledge and belief of evolution, as
governed by the Periodic Laws, that the Ancient
Brotherhood possessed : " the transformer and
creator of new series of cells and forms of matter "
being exemplified by the symbolical type of
Khepera (Beetle) ; and

Thirdly, we have a definite statement that these
old ancient Brothers knew and believed in the
only One Great God from the first, and, moreover,
knew perfectly well the different transformations
that had taken place symbolically during the long
ages of time, to represent Him, and all the different
attributes depicted and portrayed by many signs and
symbols that had grown or had been added to
the original as the human race developed in
knowledge and wisdom and to a higher type
of man.
This remarkable document, the original of which
was wTitten in very ancient times (before the
Osirian Cult), is well worth the study of Masonic
Students, and proves all my contentions as set
before the Brotherhood.
172



CHAPTER IX
MYTHICAL REPRESENTATIONS AND EVOLUTION
OF RELIGIOUS IDEAS — THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES AND RELATIONS OF THE SAME
The mythical representation did not begin with
the human figures at all, but with the phenomena
of external nature that were represented by means
of animals, birds, reptiles and insects, etc., and
various signs and symbols which had demon
strated the possession of superhuman faculties
and powers. The origin of various superstitions
and customs seemingly insane can be traced to
Sign Language. Modern popular superstition, to
a large extent, is the ancient symbolism in its
childhood. In the most primitive phase mythology
was a mode of representing certain Elemental
Powers by means of living types that were super
human, like the natural phenomena, and the
foundations of all Ancient Wisdom were laid in
the pre-anthropomorphic mode of primitive repre
sentation ; and this mythical mode of representation
went on developing in Egypt, keeping touch with
the advancing Arts. Primitive man did not make
173



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the mistake about the facts of nature, as we
have mistaken the primitive method of expressing
them.
Modern ignorance of the mythical mode of
representation has led to the ascribing of innumer
able false behefs, not only to primitive man and
present-day savages, but also to the most learned,
enhghtened, and highly-civihzed people of antiquity,
the Egyptians.
The ignorant representation of the Egyptian
Sign Language was begun by the Greeks, who
could not read the hieroglyphics or understand
their Sign Language. It was repeated by the
Romans and has been perpetuated by " Classical
Scholars " ever since. But as the interpreter of
Egypt that kind of scholastic knowledge is erroneous,
and futile as regards the truth of the subject
matter.
The Eleusinian and other Mysteries that we find
in various countries were originally the Egyptian
Mysteries carried out of Egypt by men who had
been partially initiated there, and by the various
exodes that left the old Motherland for some
other countries, and, like their writing, had become
perverted and altered by time and circumstances,
such as new fauna, which were symboUcally the
same but different .types ; innovations crept in
when part of the true ritual had been forgotten,
as we find amongst the Babylonians and Assyrians,
who were first Stellar Cult and were later invaded
174



EVOLUTION OF RELIGIOUS IDEAS
by the Solar ; these converted the Egyptian
divinized Elemental Powers, representing all that
was beneficent, into all the demons that repre
sented evil. The Greeks are very late as regards
human history and evolution, and never understood
the gnosis of the Egyptian Wisdom, because they
could not read Sign Language or hieroglyphics.
Thousands of years even before the Persian
Empire existed, the Solar Cult had spread over
India and further, to Siam and Java, where they
formed a great civilization, as is witnessed by the
remains of the old and huge temples still extant
at the ruins of Nagor-Wat and Angkorthom.
The Solar Cult is at least 100,000 years old and
the Stellar over 600,000. But the Solar Cult
people, as a great nation, were destroyed in Egypt
on account of Socialism and Bureaucracy, and
were fast deca3dng when Greece was only a number
of States. The first Minoan civihzation of the
Mediterranean existed ages before the Greeks (see
The Dawn of Mediterranean Civilization, b}' Angelo
Mosso), and this civilization only came into being
at the time that the Ancient Egyptians were
converting their hieroglyphic writing into alpha
betical form (Proto-Egyptian of Evans). In
studying these ancient peoples one must take
into consideration that there was great over
lapping. Whilst Central Asia, China, Korea and
Japan were still Stellar Cult, in Europe these
had been killed off, or the new Solar Cult w^as
175



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
imposed upon them and only " remnants " of
the Stellar Cult people were left in isolated places.
After the destruction of the old Egyptian Empire
a dark and degenerate age ensued. Egypt was
overrun, her libraries were burnt, her temples
destroyed and buried by accumulated filth from
Arabs and others, and her learned men slaughtered.
The same with the Incas in South America, who
were Solar Cult people and formed a huge
socialistic-bureaucratic government, and were
almost utterly destroyed quickly by the Spaniards.
What are these people now ?
But members of the old Brotherhood were not
all killed ; some escaped, and in other countries
still continued their rites and Mysteries— although
much of the true symbolism was perverted, as
the gnosis of the mythical representation had been
forgotten, to be found again recently, and to be
read once more as the truth, in the language in
which it was originally written. The Ritual of the
Resurrection of Egypt in Sign Language.
Herein can we read and follow throughout the
world the old Stellar Cult people and their
" Mysteries '' — the Chinese, Korean, Japanese
and others in many countries of the world, and
the old Solar people—the Druids, the Hindus, the
Persians, the Incas and the Jews— in all the
countries to which they migrated.
The Greeks and Romans, who may be classed
as the intermediary nations, only practised a
176



THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES
perverted and debased form of the old Egyptian
Wisdom.
The Christian doctrine which issued out of the
ashes of the old Eschatology, first evolved by
the Copts, and the purity of which is spoiled by
the recently introduced dogmas, has yet to evolve
into a higher and purer Eschatology again.
In the Solar Cult, the Mysteries of Amenta,
called the ten Greater Mysteries, were eschato
logical—Amenta was a symbolic representation of
the Earth of eternity, where Taht was the Great
Teacher of the secrets, together with the seven
masters. The passage through Amenta is a series
of initiations for the deceased.
He is inducted into the Mysteries of Rusta
(chaps. I, 7, 9), the Mysteries of the Tuat (chaps.
27, 130), the Mysteries of x\kar (chaps. 2, 37, 148).
He knows or learns the Mysteries of Nekhen
(chaps. I, 113). The deceased invokes the god
who dwells in all the Mysteries (chaps, i, 14). He
learns the Mysteries of the father-god Atum,
who becomes his own son (chaps. 15, 46) ; he is
the mysterious of form (chaps. 17, 19) and the
mysterious of face (chaps. 9, 133). And the most
secret and sacred of the greatest of all Mysteries :
its name is the book of the hidden dwelling, that
is, the Ritual of Resurrection (chap. 162). At the
entrance to the Mysterious Valley of the Tuat
there is the walled-up doorway, the secret entrance
to the Mysteries. It was the first door of twelve
177 M



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
divisions of the passage. The rest have open
doors and the twelfth a double door. This was
typified or symbolically represented by the en
trance to the Great Pyramid, where a movable
flagstone of a triangular shape revolved over a
square stone when the magical word was given.
It was called " the Door of Stone.'' Here is the
mystery—how to enter when there is no door and
the w^ay is unknown. It is explained to the m.anes
how divine assistance is to be obtained. When
the stains of life are effaced, the strength is given
for forcing the entrance where there is no door,
and in that power the manes penetrate with (or
as) the God (chaps, 2, 3, 148).
The entrance to the Great Pyramid (the greatest
Masonic Temple ever built) was concealed by
means of this movable triangular flagstone that
turned on a pivot which none but the initiated
could detect. This, when tilted up, revealed a
passage, 4 feet in breadth and 3I feet in height,
into the interior of the building. This was a mode
of entrance applied to Amenta as the blind door
way, that w^as represented by the sacred portal
and movable stone of later legends. The means of
entrance through w^hat appeared to be a blank
wall w^as by knowing the secret of the nicely ad
justed stone, and the secret was communicated to
the initiate with the password in the Mysteries.
There is no death in the final stage of these
doctrines—only decay and change and a periodic
178



THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES
renewal ; only evolution and transformation in
the domain of matter and the transubstantiation
into spirit. In the so-called death it is rebirth,
not death—exactly the same as in the changes of
external nature. If the manes failed at the
weighing of his soul, he became annihilated. It
would take up too much space to give details of
all, but these can be found in the Ritual as per
supra.
It may be of some interest to Brothers of the
iS"^ to know that it was in the " earth of Amenta "
that Horus came to restore sight to the blind,
and that the funeral bed should not be recumbent.
In the D.R. they ought first to arrange the
Khen-Kat, '' a funeral bed that stands up." The
Khen-Kat is the funeral bed on which the dead
were laid out in '' Amenta,'' waiting for the
coming of Horus, Lord of Resurrection, to wake
the sleepers who are in the coffins or lying breath
less on the couches. It is the couch of the dead
that is set up on end, like the mummy cases with
the body inside, which is thus erected on its feet,
as a mode of rendering " the Mystery of the
Resurrection " or re-erection of the deceased.
" Horus causes thee to stand up at the rising.
Thou settest forth on thy way." The deceased
(or initiate), as the risen mummy, is seen walking
off. The drama consists of three acts, with six
different characters, in the original Egyptian
Mysteries of the passing through Amenta of
179



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Egyptian Wisdom, from the time of the ini
tiate's entering to the coming forth and arrival
at Am-Khemen of the Paradise.
There should be two ladders, not one only.
The first is the Maget or ladder of Set, typical of
the ascent from " the Land of Darkness/' The
other, the Maget or ladder of Horus, " reaching to
the Land of Light/'
" He has joined the Lords of Eternity in the
Circle of '' and in the likeness of his own
human self, the very figure which he had on earth,
but changed and glorified (chap. 178).
The Symbolic Drama is typical of the human
spirit passing to its final state.
There are seven Primary Powers in the mythical
and astronomical phases ; six of these are repre
sented by Zootypes, the seventh is imaged in the
likeness of man.
This is represented in the Eschatology, where
the highest soul of the seven is the Ka-eidolon,
with a human face and figure as the final type of
spirit, which was human on earth and is eternal
in the heavens, i.e. the Khu (spirit).
The Khu is a soul in which the person has
attained the status of the " pure spirit/' called
the " Glorified," symbolically represented in the
likeness of a beautiful white bird.
There was still one type or grade higher to
attain—the Ka, w^hich is a type of totality and
of eternal duration, in which the sevenfold
180



THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES
personality is unified at last for permanent or
everlasting life. This is where the Hindu and
other Mysteries have gone wrong, not knowing
the gnosis of the Egyptian Wisdom, the seven
Urseus divinities representing the seven souls of
life that were anterior to the one enduring soul of,
or in, their Eschatology (" My image is eternal,"
chap. 85), as it would be when the seven souls
were amalgamated into one that was imaged by
the divine Ka. These seven souls have been
conceived as ascending types of personality in
human transmigrations on different planes !
In the 18^ the Valley of Death is the Egyptian
Ar-en-Tet, representing Horus Khent-an-maat, or
another name was Horus-Har-Khent-an-arar-f in
Sekhem, who was Chief among the manes who
were without the means of seeing in the dark.
They were blind in the darkness of death in this
part of " Amenta.''
There is nothing in all poetry, considered as the
flower of human reality, more pathetic than the
figure of Horus in Sekhem. He has grappled with
the Apap of evil and wrestled with Set = the
Devil, or Satan, and been overthrown in the
passage of absolute darkness. Blind and bleeding
from many wounds, he continues to fight with
death itself ; he conquers, rises from the grave
like a warrior with one arm—not that he has lost
an arm : he has got only one arm free from the
bonds of death, the bandages of the mummy made
181



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
for the burial. But he Hves, he rises again trium
phant, lifting ike sign of the Dominator aloft : and
in the next stage of transformation he will be
altogether free from the trammels of the mummy,
to become pure spirit, in the likeness of the Father,
as the express image of His person. He is the
Good Shepherd who calls to his followers " Hak
er-a " (" Come thou to me "). It was followed by
a festival in which there was much eating and
drinking.
This is the origin, and original, of the tradition
given to Brothers in the s"" of the death of H.A.
(who by the by w^as not killed at all in the building
of K.S.T., but lived many years after). Brothers
will see how much more sacred and impressive the
original is than the '* traditional."
In the 17° the original p.w.'s are '' Abut-Unti ''
not " Noddaba." The Egyptian means a form
of Apap and typifies non-existence. The A.
''Ihuh"==God the Son, who was, as Egyptian,
lu or Hu. Hoshea or Joshua the son of Nun=:
the Egyptian Shu, and Caleb the son of Je
phunneh=Anup-ap-Uat.
The Egyptians represented evil as negation.
Abtit-Unti was a form of Apap who was evil,
and a type of negation in the natural phenomena,
which was opposed to good.
In the Eschatology, Set or Sut represents
negation as non-existence.
Evil culminated in annihilation and non-being
182



THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES
for the manes, and the negation of being, of hfe,
of good was the ultimate form of evil.
The hell-fire of Christian Theology, the hell-fire
that is unquenchable (Mark ix. 43, 44), is a survival
of this representation made in the Egyptian
Mysteries.
The manes in Amenta passes through this hell
of fire, called the Meskat, in which those who are
condemned suffer their annihilation. He says :
'' I enter in and I come forth from the tank of
flame (or lake of fire) on the day when the adver
saries are annihilated in Sekhem " [Ritual, chap, i) ;
" I have come from the lake of flame, from the
lake of fire and from the field of flame."
This lake of fire that is never quenched was
derived from the Solar Force in the mythology, on
w^hich the Eschatology was based. The initiate
in the Mysteries had to pass through this '' lake of
fire,'' which is depicted very graphically in part
of the Great Pyramid. We do not now use this
" lake of fire," perhaps just as well for the initiates
at present, because we have lost the secret connected
with this ceremony.
There are, however, some tribes belonging to
the Hero Cult Nilotic Negroes who still perform the
ceremon}^ in Africa, Asia, America and the Pacific
Isles.
They clear a space which they pa\'c with
large flat stones ; these they make red-hot by
lighting fires on them, after '' a meeting of sacred
1S3



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
rites/' They walk barefoot all over and about
on these whilst still at a red-hot temperature
;
they do not suffer any distress or scorching in the
least — at the same time, an ordinary individual
could not approach within a dozen yards on account
of the great heat. I am not acquainted with the
secrets of the ceremony, but I know that it was
a symbolical representation of the " last judgment "
in the Greater Mysteries, and those who had failed
to make the word of Horus truth against his
enemies were doomed to die a second death in
the lake of fire.
The first was in the body on the Earth, the
second in spirit.
The enemies of justice, law, truth and right
were doomed to be destroyed forever in the lake
of fire or tank of flame.
They were annihilated once for all into original
and separate Corpuscles.
The doctrine occurs in the Pauline Epistles and
in Revelation, where the end of all is with destruc
tion in the lake of fire. In the Epistle to the
Hebrews the destruction of lost souls is compared
with that of vegetable matter being consumed by
fire, i.e. the series of Corpuscles which formed
this spiritual body, or vegetable matter, were
broken np by fire into the original non-grouped
Corptiscles, so that the living spirit was annihilated
as a living spirit. The doctrine, like many others,
we see, originated with the Nilotic Negro Hero

Cult people, brought on to the Stellar and Lunar,
thence portrayed in their Solar mythology, finally
became Eschatological, and thence into the Christ
ian doctrines. It was Egyptian from the first
to the last, upon which the haze of ignorance
settled down to cause confusion ever since.
The final degree was a very severe test in the
Mysteries, and many never attained to that
sublime degree.
Entrance to the seven Arits or mansions of the
final test could not be obtained without knowledge
and the highest code of morality. The knowledge
of the names and attributes of the Doorkeeper
(O.G.), Watcher (I.G.), and Herald, who belonged
to each, was necessary.
Similarly, the Pylons of the domains of the
seven Arits could not be passed through by the
deceased (or initiate) wdthout a declaration by
him of the names and attributes of each.
Chapter 125 is important to the students of
Freemasonry, especially those who take the
highest degree.
The deceased or initiate is given or provided
with passwords which enable him to enter the
Double Maati, or Hall of Judgment, where he is
examined—in the Stellar Cult, of the Lesser
Mysteries, before seven Judges ; in the Greater
Mysteries, up to the time of the i8th Dynasty,
these had increased to forty-two Judges or
*' Grand Masters," before whom he had to make
185



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
his " Negative Confession." From this " Nega
tive Confession " we see that the Egyptian code
of morals was the grandest and most comprehensive
of those known to have existed amongst any
nation, past or present. For the information of
all the Brotherhood throughout the world, I give
the recitation of our old Brotherhood which
each one had to make under penalty of death on
the infraction of any or either ^ them— called the
" Negative Confession " :
'' To abhor fraud, theft,
deceit, robbery, iniquity of every kind, unchastity
or sense of wantonness, manslaughter, murder,
incitement to murder, and that he had wronged
no man in any wa}^" " He honoured his king,
and he neither wasted his neighbour's ploughlands
nor defiled his running stream. He spake not
haughtily, he behaved not insolently, he abused
no man, he attacked no man, he swore not at
all, he stirred not up strife, he terrified no man,
he spake evil of none. He judged not hastily, he
defrauded not his neighbour in the market, he
shut not his ears to the words of right and truth,
he sought not honours, he never gave way to
anger except for a proper cause, he sought not
to enrich himself at the expense of his neighbours."
After this there was a concluding text uttered
by him when he had passed this ordeal of judg
ment and was beginning a " new life," and the
concluding text provides the password which
enabled him to go forth from the Double Maati
Hall. The Egyptian had no conception of repent
i86



THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES
ance as later taught in the Christian Cult. He
based his claim for admission into the Grand
Lodge above upon the fact that he had not com
mitted certain sins (supra), and that he had feared
God and honoured the king, " and gave bread to
the hungry, drink to the thirsty, clothes to the
naked, and a boat to him that had suffered ship
wreck on the Nile/' He knew the terrible doom
that awaited him from the Judges if he was " not
true/' He knew their searching inquiries—those
could not be deceived ; and if his works had been
evil he knew that it was not a question of " being
sorry/' They held the just balance of his works,
and upon that judgment was pronounced, and
his belief in the efficacy of work w^as great, and
therefore he knew that his sentence" would be just

there was " no scruple or diffidence " in the
matter— and so was ready to receive his " corn
and barley " or his final doomi of death.
The seven steps in the 30° are of Lunar Cult
origin ; a figure of this " mound " may be seen
in the vignettes to the Ritual as a p3Tamid with
seven steps, called the ladder or staircase of Shu.
It is a type of ascent.
The moon fulfilled its four quarters in twenty
eight steps, fourteen up and fourteen down. For
this reason, Osiris in the moon was represented
by an eye at the top of fourteen steps. The moon
in its first quarter took seven steps upwards from
the underworld to the summit, which in the
annual reckoning was the equinoctial mount. In
187



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
other words, Shu now made use of a lunar reckon
ing previously established by the Moon-god Taht,
when the Ark of seven cubits was represented by
Am-Khemen.
There are two sets of names in the Ritual given
to the seven steps as Primordial Powers in two of
their astronomical characters. The first seven are
called (i) An-er-ef the Great, {2) Kat-Kat, (3) the
Bull who Hveth in his fire, (4) the Red-eyed One
in the House of Gauge, (5) Fiery face which turneth
backwards, (6) Dark face in its hour, and (7)
Seer in the night.
The second seven are (i) Amsta, (2) Hapi,
(3) Tuamut'ef, (4) Kabhsenuf, (5) Maa-tef-f, (6)
Karbek-ef, and (7) Hai-Khent-an-maa-ti.
The names for the first seven used now are
Hebrew importations and have no meaning. The
names of the second seven are English substi
tuted ones.
I present the Supreme Council with the true
originals, but must abstain from further interpre
tation of the above on account of secrets connected
with the degree.
In the 30° the lost word which some members
of the Supreme Council travelled to Ireland to
obtain, to replace a " substituted one," is still
incorrect. The word is " Anhuri," who was
'' Har-Tesh," the Red God, as the Great Warrior,
also as '* whose arm was lifted up with the rod
or dagger, to keep back, or strike down the evil
ones " (the Sebau). " Thou wieldest thy spear
188



Anhuri or Har-Tesh.
The Red God as the Great Warrior, also as " whose arm was Hfted up \nth a dagger to keep back or strike down the evil ones" (the Sebau). Shu, the power of the Air, had been divinized as the warrior-god who fought for Horus as leader of the war against the rebel powers of darkness and of drought: 30°. {Drawn by K. Watkins.)






THE TEN GREATER MYSTERIES
to pierce the head of the serpent Nekau " {Ritual).
I beg to draw the attention of the members of
the Supreme Council to this (supra).
Horus appears in the various characters of Har
Tema, the revealer of justice ; Har-Makheru, the
word made Truth, and Har-Tesh, the red god who
orders the block of execution.
These are phases of Har-Makhu, the God of both
horizons, all of which are reproduced in Revelation.
Michael, the warrior angel who overthrows " the
dragon and his angels," is the Hebrew form of
Har-Makhu or Har-Tesh, who is Atum-Hui in
the person of his own son. This is Har-Tema, he
who makes justice visible in the Cult of Osiris. He
is the avenger of the wrongs inflicted on his father
by the Apap-dragon and his dark host of the Sebau,
or friends of the evil Set, and also by the criminals
who, on account of their own deeds, are self-con
demned to die the second death upon " the high
way of the damned" (Ritual, ch. i8).
This " awiul tradition of a war in heaven " was
made out magnificently in Milton's epic poem,
but the original war in heaven was simply elemental,
and had no more awfulness or terror in it than a
thunderstorm. We can trace this warfare of the
elements from the beginning in chaos : the terrors
were evoked from the mind of man. A battle was
fought each twenty-four hours, and the dragon of
darkness is hurled down from the horizon of
the east into the pit with all his angels or fiends,
189



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
called the Sebu or Sami. This great battle, fought
in the Ritual during the last hours of night, becomes
a typical last great battle in a contention that
is fought out on the scale of the great year in
the Book of Revelation, called " the war of
the great day of God the Almighty," when "the
kings of the whole world/' or kings who ruled
in the celestial heptanomis, are to be " gathered
together into the place which is called in Hebrew
Har-Mageddon " (ch. cvi. 14, 16). This war in
heaven, or external nature, was first. Next it
was made astronomical. Lastly it was eschato
logical or theological (see Ritual, ch, 30).
Some signs and symbols used by the old
Brotherhood and preserved to us during the earlier
Christian times, when the remnants of the Brother
hood were persecuted by the priests of Rome, are
shown in Mr. Harold Bayley's book New Light
on the Renaissance displayed in Contemporary
Emblems.
By Mr. Harold Bayley's permission,
C; J for which I herewith return my sincere
thanks, I give some of them.
Here we see the Sacred Axe has been
brought on with the addition of the
Christian Cross on it ; the symbolism
of each is the same. Later the Chris
tians took the Axe away and left the

have been symbolized in the Christian doctrines
as the seven Churches.
When Europe was converted to Christianity it
was by making use of the same Symbols that were
hallowed in the previous Cults, the rooted types
being indefinitely more potent than any later sense
engrafted on them.
Horus or Jesus as Ichthus, the fish, upon a
stone, now in the British Museum. Here we see
portrayed the two fishes, one over the head of
Horus and the other under his feet. The latter
also repeats the ancient type of the Crocodile
on which the divine child was supported in the
Cippi of Horus.
In another type of the pictures found in the
catacombs the '' Good Shepherd " is accompanied
by both the lamb and the ram, which are equivalent
to the dual types of Horus of the Equinox in
Aries. He carries the lamb upon his shoulders,
whilst the ram is resting at his feet.

Horus was the lamb on the Western and the
ram on the Eastern Horizon, both being united
in a figure of the dual power.
Chaldean Representation OF THE Fish God.
The Fish God of the Assyrians was Horus of the Double Horizon, He is portrayed as a fish. As in the Egyptian, it was a symboHc type as to how he crossed the Horizon from West to East. He swam through the waters of space (see supra) . [Drawn by K. Watkins.)
The mythology remained extant in Egypt, so

RELATIONS OF THE GREATER MYSTERIES
and tested. Egyptian theology was based upon
the mythology which preceded it and suppHed the
mould, and the primitive Mysteries were founded
on the facts in nature which are verifiable to-day
as from the first. These old Egyptian Mysteries
are the originals of all other Mysteries—Gnostic,
Kabalistic, Eleusinian, Pythagorean, Zoroastrian,
Hindu, Druidic and Jewish, and in fact all, can
be traced back to Egypt, and no place on earth
can otherwise be found for their origin. Herodotus
and other Greek writers are much too late to be
of value as regards the ancient past history of
the world. Egypt was in a state of decay before
the Greeks w^re born. Herodotus, who was the
most reliable Greek historian, tells us, however, of
the reluctance of the Egyptians to admit strangers
to the holy secrets of their Mysteries. He states
that they did, however, admit Eumolpus, King
of Eleusis, who on returning to his country insti
tuted the Mysteries of that name which he had
learnt from the priests of Egypt, also Orpheus,
the Greek poet, the philosopher Thales, and
many others.
Herodotus also states {Euterpe, L.) :
*' Egypt has certainly communicated to Greece
the names of almost all the Gods."
(LI.) " The Greeks have derived many other
customs of religious worship from Egypt."
(LVni.) " The two oracles of Egyptian Thebes
and of Dodona have an entire resemblance to
193 N



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
each other. The art of divination as now prac
tised in our temples (Greece) is thus derived from
Egypt ; at least the Egyptians were the first who
introduced the sacred festivals, processions and
supplications, and from them the Greeks were
instructed. Of this it is to me a sufficient
testimony that these religions ceremonies are in
Greece hut of modern date, whereas in Egypt they
have been in use from the remotest antiquity.*' But
what Herodotus knew of the Mysteries he kept
religiously concealed.
The description of the " Eleusinian Mysteries '*
as lately published in the Freemason (1919, p. 53),
and the article by the critic of the Occult Review
may be best described as " a criticism of ignorance
b}^ ignorance," as far as the real description
of the origins and real interpretations are con
cerned ; although this article may interest some
Brothers, there can be no djoubt that it cannot
assist in giving the Brothers w^ho wish to know,
any truth of its origin and interpretation ; but
the above is enough to prove my contention.
These men not understandmg the true gnosis or
Sign Language, the translations became debased
and none of the truth remained. The Druids,
who were the priests of the old Solar Cult in
Europe and these Jsles, carried away from the
first a true interpretation, although, as time went
on, much of the original was forgotten by their
descendants, communications having been cut off
194



RELATIONS OF THE GREATER MYSTERIES
from the original home, which was now destroyed,
and innovations became substitutes for the
originals. These continued their old ceremonial
rites until the order of Canute, and practised
them long after in secret places, forming secret
*' Lodges/' Later, many of the secret and sacred
rites found their way to Scotland and other parts
of Britain from the Continent and Asia in a per
verted form, finally forming the so-called Specula
tive Lodge here.
Ireland appears to have retained a truer form
of the original than any other country, possibly
because we know that direct communication was
maintained from Egypt to Ireland by the Her
Seshsta to comparatively late periods, and Ireland,
being isolated, did not have so much communication
with the rest of the priests of Europe, who exer
cised a form perverted from the original. In
America and Asia both the Stellar and Solar Cult
remained until the advent of the Christian Roman
Religion, brought over by the Spaniards.
As showing how some of the Christian was
taken from the Egyptian, I reproduce these five
bulls' heads, with other symbols. They are very
interesting and important as showing how the
old Egyptian Sign Language was brought on and
converted into the Christian symbolism.
The original bull's head alone was purely Egypt
ian, and w^as one of the ideographic symbols for
Horus of the Double Horizon, or Double Equinox,

Fig. I.
The head of a Bull with the s\Tnbol of Amsu or the Risen Christ of the Eg}^ptians. One of the earliest symbols for Horus of the Primary Solar Cult, when Hathor represented the Mother as a Cow on one Horizon and Horus, her child, as a young Bull on the other.
Fig. 3.
This shows the Bull's head (Horus of the Double Horizon symbol) with the Christian Cross only depicted above, the symbol for Amsu having been left out entirely. The next phase was that they did away with the head of the Bull and left the Cross only. Probably about the fifteenth or sixteenth century.
Fig. 2.
This shows how the Christians brought on and converted the old symboUsm into the present. Here is depicted the head of a Bull with the Christian Cross on the head, and above this the old symbol for Amsu. Probably about the eighth or tenth century.

RELATIONS OF THE GREATER MYSTERIES
before the human type had been depicted, when
it was the Cult of Hathor and Horus. Horus was
represented as the Calf on one Horizon and the
Bull on the other. In the primary Solar mythos,
child Horus was symbolized as the little autumn
sun, conceived on the Western Mount as the Calf
or Child. Adultship was attained upon the Eastern
Horizon with what is termed the double force.
In these two characters he was the Double Horus

Figs. 4 and 5 " Bull's heads " represent the earliest formation of Set and Horus brought on from the Lunar Cult. Each is typified by its ideographic sign or symbol. No. 4 is Horus with the fieurde-lys or white Uly, which is brought on in the iS°, and represented by the " Lily of the Valley."

or the Double Harmachis—the Solar god on both
Horizons, and fulfilled annually in the Double
Equinox. The power of evolution was portra^^ed
in Kheper, the transformer, as Kheper showed
the old beetle changing into the young, the tadpole
transforming into the frog, the human embryo
developing in utero, the enduring spirit emanating
from the mortal mummy. Kheper was a form
of Har-Makhu, as we learn from the Sphinx.
197



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
In Fig. I we observe the symbol of Horus (the
httle Pygmy sacred sign) as Atum-Iu or the Risen
Amsu-Atum lu, this being a symbol also for
Horus of the Double Horizon.
In Fig. 2 we have the bull's head with the
Christian Cross above and between the two horns
(two horns being a symbol of Solar ascent), and
above the cross again we have the Pygmy sacred
sign, w^hich is now the ideographic symbol for
Amsu or Atum-Iu, or " the Risen Christ " both
of the Egyptians and Christians.
In Fig. 3 we have the bull's head, but the
Christians have done away with the Egyptian
ideograph and substituted the Christian Cross in
its place. At the same time the interpretation of
the symbols is all one and the same, as I have
demonstrated and proved in Fig. 71, p. 193, in
Arcana of Freemasonry, showing that the Shamash
of the Chaldeans, Babylonians and Assyrians w^as
the Egyptian Atum-Iu or Horus of the Double
Horizon. The symbolicy is identical in all cases.
Figs. 4 and 5 show the primary and originals.
I also reproduce tw^o ladders which have been
brought on in the early Christian symbolism from
the Egyptian originals. One, the Ladder of Shu,
with his symbol depicted above. The other the
Ladder of Horus, with his house or Paradise
portrayed above ; but the early Christians have
only shown three steps in each case instead of
seven, and in their portrayal of Paradise, or the
198



RELATIONS OF THE GREATER MYSTERIES
House of Horus, they have depicted a six-pointed
star instead of the Egyptian five.
The five-pointed star was a symbol of the House
of Horus or Paradise. The original six-pointed
star of the Egyptians represented the six
" Glorious Ones " or the six Primary Powers
uranographically represented by the constellation
of Ursa Minor or Little Bear—the stars that never
set as seen from Old Egypt, with Horus as the
seventh, and the portra3^al originated during the
Shu. Horus.
Stellar Cult. The Christians have put one too
many points to the star and left out the central
. (dot), which represented Horus as the seventh
and the greatest one. A later representation was
the seven stars as seven Powers, and Horus was
added as the eighth by the . in the centre.
Horus was the teacher of the Lesser Mysteries in
his first advent—that is, the Stellar Cult—and
teacher of the Greater Mysteries in his second
that is, the Solar Cult.

I also reproduce three Symbols of Set or Sut
as brought on by the early Christians. In one
attitude we see him as fighting ; this was later
brought on as the Unicorn opposite the figure of
the Lion (the latter being one of the symbols for
Horus).
We see here another example of how the old
symbolism was first brought on into the Christian
doctrines and then discarded.
This is a '' compound symbolism " of different
periods of time. The two doves represent Hathor
and her child as Horus. Hathor is on, or within,
her Tree, which is supported in the Sektet boat
;
Horus is at the prow of the boat, which is

swam the waters of space to Paradise. Here he
lands the manes and presents to his Father.
Probably about the fifth or sixth century.
I am indebted to a Brother in Australia for
sending this interesting picture.

This is another symbol thus brought on from
the Stellar Cult. It was the original Stellar Cult
Swastika (see Arcana of Freemasonry, Fig. ii6,
201

p. 288, for the original and full explanation). It
is the figure of the tripartite division of the Ecliptic,
represented symbolically by Horus, God of the
North, Set, God of the South, and Shu, God of
the Equinox—the Primary Trinity—and the
triangle in the centre represents Horus as the
One Great God. The original, as perceived, has
been altered with the Christian symbolism by
substituting the three crosses in place of the
originals and leaving out the central triangle (G).

Sign Language

" of the first meeting of Lodges/'
here in the British Isles or elsewhere, because there
were no written records of present-day terminology
and wTiting.
The old first Christian monks in Europe would,
and did, take great care that all writings, or traces
of writings, of the old Cults were destro3'ed, or
at least all that they could not make use of and
carry on in that new Cult : moreover, the old
Christian monks were about the only men who
could write at the time. It was a dark and ignorant
age ; for hundreds of years the people depended
upon what the priests told them, and these were
not much better informed as to the truth than
the poor ignorant classes. But for all Brothers
who take an interest in the origin and real meaning
of the rites and ceremonies of our Order, there in
the Ritual of Egypt, written in Sign Language,
lies the true origin of all the Mysteries in the
world, and in the study of the origin and evolution
of the human race can be traced the reasons for
the foundation of the same.
Not " trailing clouds of glory " have we come
from any state of perfection as fallen angels in
disguise, with the trump of attainment all behind
us, but as animals, emerging from the animals,
wearing the skins of animals, uttering the cries of
animals, whilst developing our own ; and thus
the nascent race has travelled along the course
of human evolution with the germ of immortal

possibilities in it, darkly struggling for the light,
and a growing sense of the road being up-hill,
therefore difficult, and not to be made easy like
the downward way to nothingness and everlasting
death.

CHAPTER X
UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY THE ONLY EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR PERMANENT PEACE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD
If the ostensible ends of the Peace Society are
ever attained, they will be accomplished by the
Universal Brotherhood of Freemasonry combined,
as this is the only effective means for permanent
Peace throughout the world.
The difhculty is one that can be overcome
only by the progressive evolution to a higher
type of Homo, which is governed b}- the
Periodic Laws of the Corpuscles. Thus man,
depending on his evolution, will be advanced or
retarded by the struggles between individuals
and States obeying, or not, the fundamental Laws
of Nature. These Periodic Laws of T.G.A.O.T.U.
are true and immutable, and although we have
dark and degenerate ages, decay and obliteration
of erring nations in the world's history, yet we
find that evolution of the human race is progressive.
Man ought to be ever striving to help the Divine
evolution by becoming to the best of his ability
205



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
well instructed and informed. True education in
every sense of the word, with congenial and
healthy surroundings and good food, would tend
to produce a larger number of series of corpuscles
with less inclination to part with one or more
corpuscles at the terminal end of the normal
series, thus producing a better balanced brain and
mind. Civilizations made up of individuals who
refuse to travel the road that leads to complete
development, and b}^ selfishness and greed reach
seeming prosperity, only waste away and die
without having grasped the duty of every race,
namely, to receive and pass on to posterity the
message of truth—these seek to dominate and
control the life and conscience of the individual
and subject him to tyranny and bondage.
Now we come to the question, " Is Freemasonry
a Failure ? " To one who has made a deep study
for forty years, and can read and understand
the Ancient Glyphs, which give a history of the
past rise and fall of all great nations, and the
causes for the same, as well as the progressive
evolution of the human race, the answer is, at
this date : It has not been, and is not now, a
failure ; but at the present time English Free
masonry is in the very gravest sense at a critical
period, with the balance of the scales at equipoise.
This statement is true, because, when studying
the progressive evolution of the human race, it
is not difficult to understand why the present
206



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
humans here in England, in this supposed enhght
ened period, should have acted and set themselves
against the Periodic Laws of the Universe, which
are true and immutable—that have been, are,
and will for all eternity be in active operation.
Hitherto in this country (England), the Govern
ment at least have neglected and despised science ;
they have not understood that it is simply the
whole of human experience ordered and classified.
A State that tries to govern its affairs without
science is blind ; every step it takes is a step in
unexplored ground, and it only learns by bitter
experience the folly and disaster that follow such
a course. If a nation permits a Socialistic,
Bureaucratic Government to be set up at its
head at this period of the evolution of the human
race, there can be only one end ; the principle
of this kind of government is to augment official
power, official members, with undue influence or
authority—officials who govern by a rigid and
arbitrary routine, causing delay, muddle, extrava
gance, red tape, corruption and scandalous waste.
The people are not given a chance of developing
on true human lines—that is to say, the laws of
natural evolution of the development of the human
race have been stultified ; the system of education
is to make the individual a unit in the machine
of State, and the individual is merely an accessory
part, all his best instincts are stifled, only blind
obedience and servility being taught.
207



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Freemasonry, on the contrary, teaches and
inculcates those principles which, if followed, will
build character, increase intelligence, foster self
reliance, promote independent thinking, abolish
fear, annihilate superstition, spread love and
goodwill everywhere ; it possesses the highest and
truest ethics which the world has ever seen. One
of these has been, and is, the unfaltering, courageous
and consistent championing of individual life,
individual liberty, and individual happiness against
the other force of Bureaucracy, which, with equal
persistency, is seeking to dominate and control
the life, intelligence and conscience of the individual,
and subject him to individual bondage and servi
tude. Unfortunately, many Freemasons have been,
and are, assisting in this latter disastrous course,
and, if pursued, Freemasonry will become a total
failure. The question is whether our Brother
hood has learnt the bitter lesson that has already
been taught in the past for the survival and
continuation to a higher type of evolution of our
race, and, therefore, the continuation of Free
masonry in this country to a higher standard ;
and for it not to be a failure. Brethren must learn
to use, and not work against, those Laws which
T.G.A.O.T.U. has given as a guide for our future
welfare—the Periodic Laws of the Universe. If
we still persist in supporting Socialistic Bureau
cracy, we shall become a failure and go under.
The penalty of sin is death, and the sin in this
208



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OE EREEMASOXRY
case is not only neglect, but actual active opera
tion against the laws of evolution and the
universe, which will, and must, lead to disaster and
destruction of the British Empire, and, therefore,
to Freemasonry in this country. However much
some Brethren may differ from me in this opinion,
which is founded upon the knowledge of the
Periodic Law^s of the Universe and the past history
of the fall of all great nations, it is a fact that
Bureaucratic Governments, through want of know
ledge and ignoring scientific truths, are producing
such a state that there can be only one possible
end to any country, and to Freemasonry in that
country, where such fettered Governments are
adopted. Freemasonry will not live in the future
to perform its allotted task by simply being a
charitable club and good-fellowship.
Freemasonry is something more than this.
Thousands of years ago T.G.A.O.T.U. gave the
old Wise Men of Egypt the written laws for life
everlasting, as well as a '' doctrine of final things.''
These the human race has never been permitted
to lose, and the foundation of our Brotherhood
was built on these solid rocks. Although we have
travelled far and long since our '' originals " were
in existence, and we therefore have many innova
tions in our Rituals on account of compilers of
latter days not understanding the originals, yet
the " substance " has never been lost. In these
laws not only have we the spiritual side, but our
209 o



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
duties regarding our country and fellow-men are
laid down as a guide for our future actions. We
have the experience, and therefore knowledge,
given to us for the causes of the fall of all great
nations in the past, and with their fall we know
how the learned Brethren of each country were
murdered, or driven forth to other countries, there
to rise again and form great nations. As long as
a nation has continued to follow the Divine and
immutable Laws of the Universe, T.G.A.O.T.U.
has prospered and assisted that nation to advance
to a higher state of evolution. Wars will never
cease until the whole of the human race has attained
that higher evolution ; if the lower type of man will
not progress in the way the Divine Creator has
appointed, he will be destroyed, and if one nation
which has risen to the highest state of evolution
then ignores and acts against these laws, it is
acting against T.G.A.O.T.U., and the result will
ahvays be the same—destruction and disintegra
tion, and another nation will rise and take its
place. Freemasonry, therefore, w^hich has risen
to a higher and better state of evolution in this
country, is now in the balance. But let no Brother
think for one moment that Freemasonry will be
destroyed universally. That will never be. If w^e
fail here to perform our allotted task. Freemasonry
will progress in another nation and be carried to
a higher point in evolution. If the Brother who
feels he needs further direction in order to obtain
210



VNIVEkSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
a stronger faith and a larger hope will remember
the origin, study the laws, carry out these,
together with the tenets taught in his Lodge, in
his daily life, he need have no fear for the future,
but he should make himself acquainted with all
the so-called Degrees in Freemasonry, because in
the Craft and R.A. Lodges he has only part of the
Ritual and his duties unfolded to him ; whereas
in all the Degrees the duty of man to himself and
the world, as well as to all his Brethren, is set
forth, and although some of these are apparently
of modern origin, such is not really the case : they
are but innovations made to supply the part of
the " Ritual of the Resurrection of Life " which
has not been known to the modern compilers.
It is for the Brotherhood of Freemasons to recog
nize the Laws of the Universe and follow them as
T.G.A.O.T.U. has ordained, if they do not wish
to be scattered over the face of the earth and
water again. If the peace of the world and universal
brotherhood is to be attained, it will be done
through and by Freemasons, and not by Socialism
and Bureaucracy, for these latter are responsible for
the destruction of every great nation that has perished,
without any exception, as the past history of the
world proves, and are directly opposed to the
Periodic Laws. If England is to be saved from
following the fate of Russia, and Freemasonry is
to flourish and not be a failure, the Brethren must
light their lamps, otherwise they will be left to
211



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
perish and represent the FooHsh Virgins. They
have only to remember the past history of Old
Egypt, their Motherland, whose temples became
hopelessly abandoned and hidden beneath the
accumulated filth of generations of Arabs. Their
Great Library was burnt to ashes, their Wise Men
were slaughtered, or driven forth to find a home
in another land, and the latest example, where
history has repeated itself, is quite recent. The
Socialists and uneducated classes in Russia have
revolted against the educated classes : Socialism
in its worst form has been preached and let loose,
with' the result—the destruction of the very thin
layer of educated people that it had taken Russia
centuries to collect. Where they murder their
officers and generals of experience and put common
soldiers in command, and tramp soldiers and
sailors to administer the revolutionary courts,
murder their physicians and surgeons and establish
common house-porters in their places, all law and
order must disappear, to be replaced by anarchy,
civil war, starvation, and breaking up of a mighty
empire, and the progress of the evolution of this
part of the human race will have to begin again,
dating back a thousand years. They will have to
begin from the bottom of the ladder of civilization.
If Freemasonry is not to be a failure, it must take
such action that a similar fate shall not befall
this country, although we appear to be running
headlong in that direction ; these are not idle
212



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
words, but sure deductions drawn from immutable
laws. If Freemasonry is not to be a failure, the
Brethren must follow and practise those teachings
outside the Lodge that they are taught inside.
It will not be sufficient to subscribe to the Insti
tutions and be a '' good fellow." Freemasonry is
more than that. It is the old true religion of
the world, without dogmas or sects, and to pre
serve Freemasonry from failure it must be acted on
and taught as such in our lives. If we fail to
obey the Laws of T.G.A.O.T.U., we must not
complain or be surprised if He destroys us. It
would be we have failed, and not Freemasonry
or the " Ritual of Resurrection and the Life to
Come." That still stands good where it did
300,000 years ago and more.
If Masonry needed to be justified for imposing
political as well as moral duties on its initiates, it
would be enough to point to the sad history of
the world. It would not even need that she
should turn back the pages of history to the chapters
written by Tacitus : that she should recite the
incredible horrors of despotism under Caligula and
Domitian, Caracalla and Commodus, Vitellius and
Maximin. She need only point to the centuries
of calamity through which the French nation
passed : to the long oppression of the Feudal
Ages, of the selfish Bourbon Kings : to those times
when the peasants were robbed and slaughtered
by their own lords and princes like sheep : when
213



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
the lord claimed the first-fruits of the marriage
bed : when the captured city was given to merciless
rape and massacre : when the State prisons groaned
with innocent victims, and the Church blessed the
banners of pitiless murderers and sang Te Deums
for the crowning mercy of the Eve of St. Bartholo
mew, and when the Pope's Nuncio and the Cardinal
de la Roche-Ayman, devoutly kneeling one on
each side of Madame du Barry, their King's
abandoned prostitute, put the shppers on her
naked feet as she rose from the adulterous bed.
Then, indeed, the people w^ere beasts of burden.
Why has France risen again in all her glory ? Be
cause France has seen that man is supreme over
institutions, and not they over him. Man has
natural empire over all institutions. They are
for him, according to his developments : not he for
them. Man owed it to himself to be free. He
owed it to his country to seek to give her freedom
and to maintain her in that possession. It made
tyranny and usurpation the enemies of the human
race. It created a general outlawry of despots
and despotisms, temporal and spiritual. The
sphere of duty was intensely large. Patriotism
had henceforth a new and wider meaning. Free
government, free thought, free conscience, free
speech—all these came to be inalienable rights,
which those who had parted with them, or been
robbed of them, or whose ancestors had lost them,
had the right to retake. Civil and religious free
214



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
dom must go hand in hand. Free government
grows slowly, like the individual human faculties.
Liberty is not only the common birthright, but it
is lost as well by non-user as by mis-user. It
depends far more on the universal effort than any
other human property. France has to thank
Masons for the freedom she possesses now, and
France will rise to a higher, freer, and happier
state, the individuality and independence of her
people will assert themselves, and Freemasonry
will flourish in France more than it ever did before
in all her history. In her Lodges she has recog
nized T.G.A.O.T.U., but she has obliterated for
ever the Church dogmas. And what of Italy ?
The trite tale is the same. Rome, more intolerant
of heresy than of vice and crime, came to fear the
Templar Order. It has always deemed philosophical
truth a dangerous heresy, and has never been at a
loss for a false accusation to try to crush free
thought. One has only to mention all the persecu
tions that the Brotherhood have suffered from
Rome. But they have at last risen to be a free and
independent people, with Masonry as the founda
tion of their faith. One has only to consider the
teachings of Masonry. In the whole teachings
there is not a single false principle of ethics, there
are no fetters to break. Science and Masonry
are necessary to checkmate the secret and well-under
stood effort now being made to gain co7itrol of, and
to subvert the original purpose of, our dearly-won
215



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
freedom. From the dawn of civilization to the
present moment two active and opposing forces
have been engaged in deadly conflict over the
destinies of human intelligence. One of these

Freemasonry—has been the unfaltering, coura
geous, and constant champion of individual life,
individual liberty and individual happiness. The
other has, with equal consistency and persistency
sought to dominate and control the life, intelhgence
and conscience of the individual, and subject
him to individual bondage and servitude. The
one has dignified and emphasized the individual
intelligence and appreciated its value, both to
itself and to society. The other has persistently
ignored the great fundamental fact in Nature
that the individual in his own right, as such, is
vested with certain indefeasible attributes and
certain inalienable rights, privileges and benefits
which must be respected. The profound philosophy
and science locked up in the symbolism of Free
masonry has come down to us from the Escha
tology of Ancient Egypt. It was the common
bond and the religion of the human race all over
the world 300,000 years ago. Through the dark
ages of the last 5,000 years its temples had been
throw^n down, its blazing star had been eclipsed,
and the old Brothers had been put to fire and
sword ; but Freemasonry . has risen again, its
Brothers have fought for the freedom of the
world, and that great stronghold of Freemasonry,
216



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
the United States of America, joined the AUies
to fight for right, justice, morahty, truth, and
freedom for humanity from tyranny and oppres
sion.
The Masonic force to-day finds its nucleus for
a universal undogmatic and unfettered manifesta
tion in our world-wide Institution. Against this
there is another force, its field of operation being
in an organized body that seeks to maintain itself
without regard to the largest measure of individual
liberty and enlightenment. Upon one side stands
an Institution that has " from time immemorial
and through a succession of ages " given light to
all its votaries. Upon the other side are entrenched
Socialism and Bureaucracy, an organization that
champions ignorance, superstition and fear, and
that dominates and controls the reason and
conscience of its communicants.
Hov/ many of the Brotherhood throughout the
world are working, truly trying to carry out the
duty that is morally imposed upon them as Free
masons, to attain this higher evolution of the
Brotherhood and the human race ? I say unto
every Brother, of every clime and of whatever
creed, that this is a duty which devolves upon
him by the Laws and Tenets of our Order.
Let all those who doubt me attend the full
Ceremony and Working of the Ritual of the 4"
— "The Secret Master"— and those other higher
Degrees which unfortunately in many places
217



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
are '' confirmed " on the Brother and not worked
in extenso.
I beHeve that this is the reason and cause why
many Brothers do not know or comprehend that
this duty is taught and imposed upon them as
Freemasons.
But let that be no excuse for a Brother ; he
should make himself acquainted with the whole
Ritual of Freemasonry and the meaning of the
same. If this were done, it would be a convincing
proof of that which I write.
The unfortunate attitude observed by the
governing bodies of Grand Lodges renders- a
closer union of a universal Brotherhood for the
government of the world, and obviously universal
peace, still remote. But, Brethren, this will come,
because there are many Freemasons who are
working out the destiny and will of T.G.A.O.T.U.
to this end. Because we have many Brothers at
the head of our grand Institution who are ignorant
of the origin and meaning of our Ritual, even
unacquainted with many parts of the whole Ritual
of Freemasonry and the working of the same,
that is no reason why we should despair or be
downhearted.
Consider the great advance that has been made
within the last hundred years and the enormous
increase to the ranks of the fraternity ; amongst
them, within the last fifty years, there are many
who wish and want to know, who feel and see
218



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OE EREEMASONRY
that there is more in Freemasonry than a just
common Brotherhood and Charity, who know that
our doctrines have originated and been handed
down pure and unsulhed from the Eschatology of
the Ancient Egyptians, and that none of the many
creeds now in existence— the offshoots from the
original— can be compared with the purit}^ and
high moral standard, pointing our duty to God
and man and as a guide to our action, of the Ritual
of our Brotherhood. As our strength becomes
greater, as our experience becomes more extensive,
you can no longer confine the Brotherhood within
swaddling bands, or lull them in the cradle, or
amuse them with metaphysical terminology, or
try to terrify them with some bugbear of infancy.
Men of the twentieth century cannot govern as
did men of the eighteenth and nineteenth cen
turies. Since then so much experience has been
gained, and experience is true knowledge.
Will those Brothers w^ho govern the Craft seize
this opportunity (in these I include all the Grand
Lodges of our Empire and those of all our Allies) ?
And I say such an opportunity for unity and
the discussion of such world-wide problems which
have now arisen may never occur again. Alas !
I am afraid we shall look in vain to those who
govern the Craft and to whom we are told to look
for guidance and direction ; we shall have to
wait for more enlightened men—men who do not
set their faces against the very laws they are
219



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
supposed to support and uphold. Brothers, these
are strong words, but it is the truth we want

truth, and truth always. Let Brothers judge
my words after attending the full working of
the 4°. That part of the Ritual alone is proof of
what I have written. But Brothers are begin
ning to take more rational and comprehensive
views of our Ritual. We are not, we cannot in
the nature of evolution of things be, what our
fathers were : we are no more like the men of one
hundred years ago ; there is a change, and at
present a very bloody change, taking place. This
change does not end in nothing ; therefore see
you guide that movement which you cannot stop.
Fling wide the gates to that force which else will
enter through the breach. Then will it still be,
as it has been hitherto, the peculiar glory of our
Constitution to add to our titles of glory the
noblest and purest ethics of the attainment of
universal peace. Men are apt to deride what
they do not understand, and the ignorant, being
aware of the weakness of their minds, condemn
that which they ought most to venerate.
And what is there to prevent the combination
of a Universal Brotherhood who will say, '' There
shall be no war now, or at any future time " ?
Nothing that could not be easily overcome. There
should be, in the first place, One Grand Lodge for
every country. However many Provincial or
State Grand Lodges there may be, it would not
2ZQ



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
matter provided they were all under the jurisdic
tion of the One Grand Lodge of that country.
Secondly, no Lodge shall admit any Brother
who does not profess to believe in T.G.A.O.T.U.,
and no Lodge shall be included in the Uni
versal Brotherhood which does not acknowledge
T,G.A.O.T.U. To do so would at once shatter
the corner stone of the ver}^ foundation upon which
the Brotherhood has been founded, and to which
it owes its existence—not only now, but from
its very inception 300,000 years ago. The very
foundation of Masonry is the belief in T.G.A.O.T.U.
and an after-life, which we know does exist ; if,
therefore, materialists were admitted, the whole
structure on which it has been built becomes a
foundation of sand only. We at once do away
with the Great Creator of All, and He would do
away with us. It has been only because we have
believed in Him and kept to His Divine Law that
we have prospered and become again a Great
Brotherhood.
Therefore, if each country formed One Grand
Lodge, holding jurisdiction and alliance over their
Provincial or States Grand and other Lodges,
it would not be difficult to arrange for all '' Grand
Masters," with a certain number of G.O., to meet
at given intervals and decide the best method of
procedure.
I think if the U.S. of America would follow what
I have suggested (supra) and form One Grand
221



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Lodge for the U.S., representing all other States'
Grand and other Lodges at once, it would be a
great inducement for other countries to do the
same, and one of the principal difficulties would
disappear. It would be founded then as on the
principles of the G.L. of England. If this union
of the Brotherhood were accomplished, and I see
no reason why it could not be quietly accomplished,
it would be worth all the navies and armies in
the world, and universal peace could be insisted
on for all time.
I have suggested this in many former articles
in various papers and in my books, and it now
rests with the Brotherhood throughout the world
to achieve this great end and prevent such suffer
ing and horrors as are still being enacted and
have been for the last four years.
We see now the repetition of the destruction
of Great Nations which have gone against the
Divine Periodic Laws, and ours will follow rapidly
in their wake if this is not altered. Russia will
take a thousand years to recover her state of
evolution. What a lesson to those who will
learn and take heed of the Laws of Evolution !
Anarchy, murder, starvation, and all the horrors
too numerous to write, and all caused by Socialism
and Bureaucracy, and so the poor humanity of
Russia will return to a dark and degenerate age, to
begin again to climb the ladder of light, w^hich will
take her a thousand years before she reaches the top.
222



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
Another difficulty may arise pro tern, from the
cause of lack of knowledge to understand what
true Freemasonry is, and all the duties that are
incumbent upon the members of the Brother
hood.
The majority of Freemasons know nothing really
of what Freemasonry represents. To them it is a
charitable Brotherhood, a kind of semi-religious
social club. There are others, however, who are
striving to learn and to know ; their conscience
tells them that there is something more in this
great, wonderful Brotherhood than charity and
social club, which holds them together in one
firm bond. Let them continue their studies.
Light will be given them. But nothing comes to
him w^ho does not w^ork and strive to gain know
ledge. The gaining of the true conception of what
Freemasonry was and is will strengthen their
belief in the Divine Creator, because they will
begin to understand His Laws, and, therefore.
His wishes ; it will further induce them to carry
in their daily lives, outside our Temples, and act
with regard to their other fellow-creatures, all
those grand principles and tenets that are taught
inside the Temples. It wdll teach them that
SociaHsm, Bureaucracy and Anarchy are all
tyranny, and must be put down if they wish to
attain a higher state of evolution ; because all
these phases of Socialism are diametrically opposed
to the Periodic Law^s, which are the Laws of the
223



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
Divine Creator—and you cannot serve two masters ;
you must be true to yourself, to your God, and
to man, or you will fail, and ultimately be destroyed
morally and spiritually, although probably you
may gain much gold ; but what will that serve
you eventually ? You are born naked into the
world, your material life is very short, only a few
years at most, and then what for eternity ? I
tell you all, my Brothers, because after forty years
of hard study I have been permitted to know and
learn these Divine Truths, both as regards this
material world and also the Divine Laws of the
Spiritual and Everlasting State, and I therefore
write for you the Truth.
If the League of Nations be formed, thai will
not prevent the repetition of the "Great Horror''
in fifty or one hundred years hence, although it
would be an excellent work and might have the
desired effect for many years. But no guarantee
as such "an international combination ' could
last one hundred years. The Treaty, and even the
action, of the League would be treated as "a
scrap of paper " or be broken, because the neces
sary cohesion of all nations could not exist so
long on that alone. Greed arid other interests
would overcome the weakest.
Whereas with the Brotherhood it will be for
ever growing in strength and insuperable : there
are no opposing principles or interests ; all the
ties would be strengthened and become firmer.
224



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
There could be no divergent opinions or interests
in any way or any form. Our Laws have been
laid down for us from the first, and these are God's
Laws. There would always be the one great
sacred tie for the life here and hereafter, for the
good of all the Universal Brotherhood ; this would
be an imperishable bond, with every link forged
of the sacred " Ba metal," unbreakable and
untouchable as long as this world lasts.
And how has Freemasonry grown within the
last two hundred years ? One has to look back
only to the 24th of June 171 7, when there met
in the City of London an assembly of Freemasons,
representing the membership of four Lodges, under
the chairmanship of the oldest Freemason then
present. The assembly organized itself into a
Grand Lodge.
Within ten years there was formed a Grand
Lodge in Ireland, and within twenty one was
formed in Scotland.
All regular Masonic Lodges in the world have
derived their authority directly or indirectly from
one or other of these first three Grand Lodges.
Freemasons now number over two millions through
out the world and are growing in number every
year. What was Freemasonry, then, prior to this
London Conference in 1717 ?
It might be compared to little rivers all issuing
from an underground " Lake of Knowledge," the
source of these little rivers being unknown, except
225 p



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
to a few, it being hidden away amongst im
penetrable forests and mountains.
But the source, or " Lake of the Waters of Know
ledge and of Truth," was there nevertheless ; that
hitherto few had been able to explore these regions
and find the Fount was because no one could read
the Sign Posts of the Path.
Well, Brothers, I have given you the position
in latitude and longitude, and pictured before
your eyes " The Fount of all our Mysteries."
Therefore, let no one imagine 1717 marks the origin
of Freemasonry. There are authentic manuscript
copies of old constitutions and charges which
prove incontestably the existence of working
Lodges as earty as the thirteenth century in this
country.
The so-called Regius Manuscript of the old
charges in the British Museum is definitely known
to date from the fourteenth century. Both this
manuscript and the next oldest—the Cooke
Manuscript, also in the British Museum, which
palaeographers assign to the early years of the
fifteenth century—speak of Freemasonry as having
originated in Egypt and having been introduced
into England in the reign of King Athelstane^
who reigned in the tenth century ; and, as I have
stated and proved, both the Stellar and Solar Cult
were established here thousands of years before that,
the former having the Lesser Mysteries and the
latter (the Druids) practising the Greater Mysteries.
226



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
Certainly, about two hundred years ago these
rivers of " Masonic influence " rushed forth from
their concealed sources into the light of day, and
it is only by tracing these small rivers back along
their " meandering way " mile by mile that I
have been able to give you the position and origin
of that " Great Lake of Knowledge " from which
they issued, with absolute certainty.
Now all should unite in one great river and
amalgamate in the '' Pool of Universal Brother
hood " to erect amidst the waters that " Great
Lighthouse " which has been so long required to
brighten the dark and turbulent sea of humanity,
so that they may travel in their " Barque of Life "
for ever in Peace and safety. Brothers, do not be
deceived into thinking that cultivating a regular
attendance at rehearsals, memorizing the Ritual,
paying visits and feeling that by the degree of culture
to be obtained through painstaking adherence to
these practices you may hope not only to become
famihar with the forms and routine of the Lodge,
but also to be enabled with confidence to make a
speech—is Freemasonry ; unfortunately, this, in
brief, is the limit to be obtained according to the
views of many Brothers, and also this is in accord
ance with the modern tendency to regard Free
masonry from an external standpoint, with the
result that a false value is placed on perfection
of ceremonial and individual adeptness. Viewed
in this light, our Brotherhood can hardly be said
227



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
to differ from a charitable and social debating
club, or any other gathering where harmony and
self-improvement are cultivated.
This is not Freemasonry, and the little rivers
that follow this course will flow in the desert sand
and be lost there.
Unfortunately, " the powers that be '' up to
the present have not helped much to assist this
" unity of streams."
I have given you the origins, evolutions and
meanings of the Brotherhood of Freemasonry, and
I trust I have inculcated in your brains the great
Divine principles you have inherited from your
old Ancestors— a priceless gift ; and it rests with
you—every individual Brother—to assist and carry
out the great truths and principles with which you
are so well acquainted, and to assist in forming
that '' one great Universal Brotherhood again,"
ivhich once existed thousands of years ago, for
procuring the Peace of the World, and as His
servants and instruments establishing a higher
evolution of Humanity, as T.G.A.O.T.U. has
decreed.
Let us save the v/orld from a repetition of the
horrors that have been enacted in this last Great
War and the sufferings of poor helpless humanity
that have been caused as the result of this war.
Let us unite and prevent such anarchy and human
destruction as is now being enacted in Russia and
other countries, throwing these countries and the
228



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
poor humans back in evolution, and consigning
them to a dark and degenerate age again for a
thousand years, and is now threatening this
country in an acute form. But do not mistake
*' the means or the way " to accomphsh this.
There is only one way, i.e. following the Periodic
Laws of the Universe, which are God's immutable
Laws since the Creation. There is only one means,
" A United and Universal Brotherhood throughout
the World."
But, mark well, that Universal Brotherhood cannot
include members of the Craft who do not believe in
T.G.A.O.T.U.
It cannot includ.e all those mxmbers of the Craft
who support those who practise tyranny and oppres
sion, and all those who seek to dominate and control
the life, intelligence and conscience of the individual
and subject him to personal bondage and servitude
y
so vividly depicted in Socialism and Bureaucracy.
There can be no compromise between these and
the Brotherhood who are fighting for freedom
for the human race, for their self-reliance, their
independent thinking, their individual liberty and
happiness, and the spread of love and good will
everyw^here, for that higher evolution and that
freedom without which true Brotherhood amongst
men could not survive. To compromise with such
would at once destroy the very fundamental
principles upon which Freemasonr}- was founded.
Against such it is our duty to fight, to destroy
229



ORIGIN AND EVOLUTION OF FREEMASONRY
their very existence as pestilent evils to humanity ;
there cannot be any association between the
two ; it would be as incomprehensible and in
compatible as the blending of good spirits with
evil ones.
That is the reason why the Masons of Germany
and other countries we have been fighting against
should never be admitted into our Lodges or
Brotherhood again. They have betrayed their
trusts and obligations, and if they have not actualty
assisted in all the horrors that so many poor
humans have suffered, they have at least upheld
and supported those whose actions have been a
thousandfold worse than those of the most de
graded savages in past ages. Therefore, to admit
and associate with any such as these would reduce
all those great principles w^hich we have inherited
direct from T.G.A.O.T.U. in past ages, and which
we profess to believe and practise, to a farce.
There could be no Universal Brotherhood, because
there would be elements antagonistic and false
in the combination—false to its principles, false
to its morality and false to their God—and in the
end it would, as a whole, become destroyed again,
and the remnants would be scattered over the
face of earth and water with only a survival of
the few, as it has been before.
No, Brothers ; we must be true to our obliga
tions, true to our principles of morality, true to
all our tenets, and ever fight against those e\dls
230



UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD OF FREEMASONRY
which impose tyranny, thraldom of body or
mind, and oppression in every form.
Thus acting, we can assist as His servants and
instruments in raising the poor human to a happier
and higher state of evolution, and once more become
the great governing body throughout the world for
this end as of old, for 300,000 years, before
Socialism and Bureaucracy destroyed it.
The ethics of Freemasonry teach the gnosis
to obtain the everlasting Spiritual Life, which
ethics were first promulgated by Taht Aan in The
Ritual of Resurrection of the Egyptian Book of
Life, and these have been carried down through
the past ages of time by the so-called Speculative
Freemasons, time and circumstances being the
causes of substituting the innovations in place of
those fragments which have been lost, or as yet
have not been found ; and the inability of the
compilers of our present Ritual to understand
the Hierogl^^phic and Sign Language in which the
Ritual is written. That Ritual of the Resurrection
and the Life to Come still stands good to-day, as
it did 300,000 years ago or miore.
