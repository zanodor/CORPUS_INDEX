INTRODUCTION.
It may be taken for granted that, from the time when Akerblad,
Young and Champollion le Jeune laid the foundation of the
science of Egyptology in the first quarter of the nineteenth century
down to the present day, every serious student of Egyptian texts,
whether hieroglyphic, hieratic or demotic, has found it necessary
to compile in one form or another his own Egyptian Dictionary.
In these days when we have at our disposal the knowledge which
has been acquired during the last hundred years by the unceasing
toil of the above-mentioned pioneers and their immediate Labours of
followers—Birch, Lepsius, Brugsch, Chabas, Goodwin, E. de p^"^!^
Rouge and others—we are apt to underrate the difficulties which lexico
they met and overcame, as well as to forget how great is the debt S^'^P^^^^.
which we owe to them. I therefore propose, before passing on to
describe the circumstances under which the present Egyptian
Hieroglyphic Dictionary has been produced, to recall briefly
the labours of the " famous men " who have preceded me in the
field of Egyptian lexicography, and " who were honoured in their
generations, and were the glory of their times."
The Abbe J. J. Barthelemy (1716-1795) as far back as 1761 Akerblad and
showed satisfactorily that the ovals in Egyptian inscriptions Zoega's
.
uy i jT discoveries,
which we call " cartouches " contamed royal names. Zoega
(1756-1809) accepted this view, and, developing it, stated that the
hieroglyphs in them were alphabetic letters. ^ Had Akerblad
(1760-1819) and S. de Sacy (1758-1838) accepted these facts,
and wofked to develop them, the progress of Egyptological
science would have been materially hastened. They failed, how
ever, to pay much attention to the hieroglyphic inscriptions of
which copies were available, and devoted all their time and labour
to the elucidation of the enchorial, or demotic, text on the Rosetta Silvestre de
Stone, the discovery of which had roused such profound interest ^^^^
among the learned men of the day. Their labours in connection
with this text were crowned with considerable success. To
Akerblad belongs the credit of being the first European to formulate
a " Demotic Alphabet," and to give the values of its characters in
Coptic letters, but neither he nor S. de Sacy seems to have sus
pected the existence of a hieroglyphic alphabet. Both these
eminent scholars produced lists, or small vocabularies, of demotic

words, and added translations of them which are surprisingly
correct considering the period when they were compiled. And
both were able to read correctly the demotic equivalents of several
Greek royal names, e.g., Alexander, Ptolemy and Berenice. Their
failure to apply the method by which they achieved such success
to the hieroglyphic inscriptions is inexplicable. It has been
suggested that their scholarly minds revolted at the absurd views,
theories and statements about the Egyptian hieroglyphs made
by Athanasius Kircher (1601-1680), Jablonski (1673-1757), J. de
Guignes (1721-1800), Tychsen (1734-1815) and others, and the
suggestion is probably correct. After the publication of his
famous " Letter " to S. de Sacy,^ Akerblad seems to have dropped
his Egyptological studies. At all events, he published nothing
about them. De Sacy, though he did not consider that he had
wasted the time that he had spent on the demotic text on the
Rosetta Stone, refrained from further research in Egyptology,
and nothing of importance was effected in the decipherment of the
Egyptian hieroglyphs until Dr. Thomas Young (June 13th, 1773
May loth, 1830) turned his attention to them.
Thomas Young and the Rosetta Stone.
Young's Hieroglyphic Alphabet and Vocabulary.
In 1 814 Young began to study the inscriptions on the Rosetta
Stone, and, according to his own statement, succeeded in a few
months in translating both the demotic and the hieroglyphic
texts. His translations, together with notes and some remarks
on Akerblad's Demotic Alphabet, were printed in Archceologia for
1815, under the title " Remarks on Egyptian Papyri and on the
Inscription of Rosetta." With respect to the Egj^ptian Alphabet
he says, " I had hoped to find an alphabet which would enable
me to read the enchorial inscription. . But ... I
had gradually been compelled to abandon this expectation, and
to admit the conviction that no such alphabet would ever be
discovered, because it had never been in existence." During the
next three or four years he made striking progress in the decipher
ment of both demotic and hieroglyphic characters. The results
of his studies at this period were published in his article Egypt,
which appeared in Part I of the fourth volume of the Encyclo
pcBcLia Britannica in i8ig. It was accompanied by five plates,
containing inter alia a hieroglyphic vocabulary of 218 words, a

" supposed enchorial, i.e., demotic alphabet," and " specimens of
phrases." The Vllth Section of the letterpress contained the Young's
" Rudiments of a Hieroglyphic Vocabulary," and thus Young Hieroglyphic
became the "father" of English compilers of Egyptian Vocabu
laries. In this article, which formed a most important and epoch
making contribution to Egyptology, Young gave a list containing
a number of alphabetic Egyptian characters, to which, in most
cases, he assigned correct phonetic values, i.e., values which are
accepted by Egyptologists at the present day. In fact, he showed
that he had rightly grasped the idea of a phonetic principle in
the reading of Egyptian hieroglyphs, the existence of which had
been assumed and practically proved by Barthelemy and Zoega, His

trouble to read Young's article, Egypt, in the " Supplement "
to the EncyclopcBdia Britannica and study his correspondence
and papers which John Leitch reprinted in the third volume of Young's
the Miscellaneous Works of the late Thomas Young, M.D., F.R.S., gnceTith'^'

volume (Add. 27,281) are all the principal documents dealing with
his work on the Rosetta Stone, and in the second (Add. 27,282)
will be found his copies of a series of short vocabularies of Egyptian
words. Without wishing in any way to reopen the dispute as to the merits and value of Young's work in comparison with that
of ChampoUion, it may be pointed out that scholars who were contemporaries of both and who had competent knowledge of
Egyptology couple together the names of Young and ChampoUion, and place Young's name first. Thus Kosegarten groups Young,
ChampoUion and Peyron^ ; Birch speaks of the " discoveries of
Dr. Young and M. ChampoUion "^ ; and Tattam says that the contemporary sculptured monuments and papyri of Egypt have long " engaged opinions on
the attention of the Learned, who have in vain endeavoured to Young's

Vlll Introduction.
Young's Demotic Dictionary.
Alphabetic arrangement of the Dictionary.
The great value and importance of Young's application of the
phonetic principle to Egyptian hieroglyphs has been summed up
with characteristic French terseness and accuracy by Chabas,
the distinguished Egyptologist, who wrote, " Cette id6e fut, dans
la realite, le fiat lux de la science."'
Curiously enough Young did not follow up his discovery by
a continued application of his phonetic principle to Egyptian
inscriptions other than those on the Rosetta Stone, but seems to
have been content to leave its further application and development
to ChampoUion le Jeune.^ And for some reason he made no attempt
to add to the Egyptian Vocabulary containing 218 words wliich he
published in his article Egypt in the Encyclopaedia Britannica,
or if he did, his additions were never printed. On the other hand,
he devoted himself to the preparation of a Demotic Dictionary and
this work occupied the last ten years of his life. The " Advertise
ment " is of considerable interest, for it shows that it was only his
inability to decide upon the system of arrangement that ought to
be employed in an Egyptian Dictionary, that prevented him from
publishing the work during his lifetime. His difficulty is described
by him thus
:
" From the mixed nature of the characters employed in the
written language or rather languages of the Egyptians, it is diffi
cult to determine what would be the best arrangement for a
dictionary, even if they were all perfectly clear in their forms,
and perfectly well understood : at present, however, so many of them remain unknown, and those which are better known assume
so diversified an appearance, that the original difficulty is greatly
increased. Every methodical arrangement, however arbitrary,
has the advantage of bringing together such words as nearly
resemble each other : and it appears most likely to be subservient
to the purposes of future investigation, to employ an imitation
of an alphabetical order, or an artificial alphabet, founded upon
the resemblance of the characters to those of which the phonetic
value was clearly and correctly determined by the late Mr.
Akerblad; and to arrange the words that are to be interpreted
according to their places in this artificial order ; choosing, however,
in each instance, not always the first character that enters into
the composition of the word, but that which appears to be
the most radical, or the most essential in its signification, or

Introduction.
sometimes that which is merely the most readily ascertained or
distinguished. "1
Now although Young was the first to apply the phonetic, or
alphabetic, principle to Egyptian hieroglyphs, it is quite clear
from the above that he failed to see its value in arranging Egyp
tian words in a dictionary. Speaking of Champollion's alphabet,
Champollion's which was in reality his own with modifications and considerable
AlphabS'^'^ additions, he says : "His system of phonetic characters may
often be of use in assisting the memory, but it can only be applied
with confidence to particular cases when supported in each case
by the same kind of evidence that had been employed before its
invention. His communications have furnished many valuable
additions to this work, all of which have been acknowledged in
their proper places." So then rejecting his own system of
phonetic, i.e. alphabetic, characters, and Champollion's develop
ment of it, he drew up his " Rudiments of the Egyptian Dic
tionary in the ancient Enchorial Character," intending the work
to appear as an Appendix to the " Coptic Grammar," which
Henry Tattam was then writing. Whilst the printing of the
" Rudiments " was in progress he fell ill, but his interest in the
work was so great that in spite of his illness he continued to

es imony. When he had passed for press six sheets, i.e. 96 pages, death
overtook him, and Tattam corrected the last 14 pages (pp. 97-110)
of proof, saw them through the press, and compiled an Index to
the work, which appeared with Tattam's " Coptic Grammar " in
' Writing to M. Arago on July 4th, 1828, Young says, " Now of the nine letters which I insist that I had discovered, M. ChampoUion himself allows me
five, and I maintain that a single one would have been sufficient for all that I wished to prove ; the method by which that one was obtained being allowed to be correct, and to be capable of further application. The true foundation of the
analysis of the Egyptian system, I insist, is the great fact of the original identity of the enchorial with the sacred characters, which I discovered and printed in 1816 [in the Museum Criiicum No. VI, pp. 155-204], and which M. ChampoUion probably rediscovered, and certainly republished in 182 1 ; besides the reading of the name of Ptolemy, which I had completely ascertained and published in 1814, and the name of Cleopatra, which Mr. Bankes had afterwards discovered by means of the information that I had sent him out to Egypt, and which he asserts that he communicated indirectly to M. ChampoUion [see H. Salt, Essay on Dr. Young's and M. Champollion's Phonetic System of Hieroglyphics, London, 1825, p. 7] ; and whatever deficiencies there might have been in my original alphabet, supposing it to have contained but one letter correctly determined, they would and must have been gradually supplied by a continued application of the same method to other monuments which have been progressively discovered and made public since the date of my first paper."

xu Introduction.
Progress of Egyptology retarded by the death of Young and Champollion.
1830.^ The " Rudiments," to paraphrase Kosegarten's words,
contains a valuable and well-arranged collection of all the most
important groups of enchorial characters hitherto deciphered.
These Young selected from enchorial texts which had been pub
lished by himself, and by Champollion and Kosegarten, and from
letters which he had received from Champollion describing the
contents of unpublished papyri at Paris.
^
The progress of Egyptology suffered a severe set-back by the
death of Young on May loth, 1830, and by the death of Cham
pollion on March 4th, 1832, and there was no scholar sufficiently
advanced in the science to continue their work. With the excep
tion of books and papers of a polemical character, some authors
championing Young's system of phonetics, and others loudly
proclaiming the superior merits of that of Champollion, and
others advocating the extraordinary views of Spohn and Seyffarth
(1796-1885), no important work on Egyptological decipherment
appeared for several years. Soon after the death of Champollion
a rumour circulated freely among the learned of Europe to the
effect that the great Frenchman had left in manuscript, almost
complete, many works which he was preparing for press when
death overtook him, and that these were to appear shortly under
the editorship of his brother, Champolhon-Figeac (i 778-1 867).
It was widely known that Champollion had been engaged for
' In his Observations on the Hieroglyphic and Enchorial Alphabets (Coptic Grammar, p. ix ff.) Tattam describes briefly and accurately the various steps in the early history of Egyptian decipherment. He shows that Young was the first to read correctly the names of Ptolemy and Berenice, that Bankes, with the help of Young, discovered the name of Cleopatra, and says that the system of letters thus discovered was " taken up, and extended, by M. Champollion, and afterwards by Mr. Salt, our late Consul-General in Egypt." He then gives the Hieroglyphic Alphabet as constructed from the researches of Young, Bankes, Champollion and
Salt. ' Das Werk (Nro. 2), mit welchem der treffliche Young seine literarische Laufbahn und zugleich sein Leben beschlossen hat, tnthalt eine schatzbare, wohlgeordnete Sammlung allcr wichtigsten bisher erklarten enchorischen Schriftgruppen. Er hat diese Sammlung aus den von ihm selbst, von Champollion, und von mir bekannt gemachten enchorischen Texten ausgewahlt, aber auch briefliche Mittheilungen Champollion's aus noch nicht herausgegebenen Pariser PapyrusroUen benutzt. Er leitete den Druck und die Corrcktur dieser Schrift, welchc ihm sehr am Herzen lag, und die gleichsam sein Vermachtniss iiber die Aegyptischen Untersuchungen liefert, noch auf seinem letzten Krankenbette, so schwer ihm auch zuletzt das Schreiben schon ward. Als er bis zur g6sten Scite mit der Correktur gelangt war, ereilte ihn der Tod ; die Correktur der letzten Seiten, und die Indices besorgte daher Hy. Tattam.

Champollion's many years in compiling a Hieroglyphic Dictionary ; that he
manuscnpts. ^^^^ j^^gg^^ assisted by his friend, Salvador Cherubini (1760-1842) ;
that Charles Lenormant (1802-1859) had helped him in tran
scribing the slips ; and that Ippolito Rosellini (1800-1843 ?) had
made a copy of this Dictionary before Champollion set out on
his last journey to Egypt. But when year after year passed and
ChampoUion-Figeac failed to issue any of his brother's works,
many scholars came to the conclusion that the manuscripts did
not exist.
Richard Lepsius and Samuel Birch.
Meanwhile two young men, C. R. Lepsius (1810-1884) and
Samuel Birch (1813-1885), had turned their attention to the
study of Egyptian hieroglyphs, and succeeded in completing
Champollion's system of decipherment and establishing it.
Lepsius first studied in Berlin under Bopp (1791-1867), and
having received his doctor's degree in philosophy in 1833,
departed to Paris, where he won the Volney prize in 1834. In
Lepsius jgoe he published the two Dissertations^ which established his

Here he wrote and published in the " Annali dell' Instituto
Archeologico di Roma " (Vol. IX, 1837) his famous " Lettre k
M. le Professeur Rosellini sur 1' Alphabet Hieroglyphique." In
this letter, which created widespread interest, he succeeded in
removing many of the defects of Champollion's development of
Young's system of phonetics, and treated the whole question of
Egyptian decipherment in such a masterly manner that all
adverse criticism of a serious character was silenced once and
The Phonetic for all. It is unnecessary to refer here to the great works to

years of his life, for they do not concern the question under

Whilst Lepsius was perfecting Champollion's system. Birch
was studying the whole question of Egyptian decipherment from
an entirely different point of view, namely, that of a Chinese
scholar. It will be remembered that so far back as 1764 Joseph

XVI Introduction.
Theories of de Guignes the Sinologist and Palin.
Birch's Chinese studies.
de Guignes (1721-1800), an eminent Sinologist, tried to prove
that the epistolographic and symbolic characters of the Egyptians
were to be found in the Chinese characters, and that the Chinese
nation was nothing but an Egyptian colony. Following in his
steps, M. le Comte de Palin (or Pahlin) held that the Chinese
and Egyptian characters were identical in origin and meaning ;^
he believed that if either the ancient forms of Chinese characters,
or those which their values indicate, were given to them, true
hieroglyphs similar to those that exist on the Rosetta Stone
would very often be found. And he thought that if the Psalms
of David were translated into Chinese, and they were then written
in the ancient characters of that language, the inscriptions in
Egyptian papyri would be reproduced.^ Now whatever may have
been the opinions held by Young and ChampoUion about the
relationship of the Chinese language to the ancient Egyptian
language, or the similarity of the principles on which Chinese
and Egyptian writing had been developed, these scholars could
neither affirm nor deny effectively the statements of de Guignes
and de Palin, for both of them were ignorant of the Chinese
language. With Birch the case was very different, for he studied
Chinese under a competent master when still at the Merchant
Taylors' School, with the direct object of obtaining an appt)intment
in the Consular Service in China. The friend of the family who
had promised to obtain this appointment for him died un
expectedly in 1 83 1, with the result that Birch remained in
England. He continued his Chinese studies, and began to read the works of Young and ChampoUion, thinking that his knowledge
of Chinese would enable him to read the Egyptian texts easily.
In 1834 he became an assistant in the Public Record Office, and
worked in the Tower until January, 1836, when he entered the
service of the Trustees of the British Museum. There he was
able to make use of his knowledge of Chinese and Egyptian, and
his first official task was to arrange and describe the Chinese
coins. ^ When this work was completed he was directed to describe

the Collections of Egyptian monuments and papyri for the official
Guide to the British Museum, and his account of them was
published in the " Synopsis " for 1838. Long before he entered Birch's idea
the Museum he conceived the idea of compiling a Hieroglyphic °^ ^
T^- ^- 11 . •, 1 , ,. , Hieroglyphic
Dictionary, and began to write down, each on a separate slip of Dictionary,
paper, the hieroglyphic words which he found in the texts
published by James Burton,' Gardner Wilkinson,^ ChampoUion,^
Rosellini* and Salvolini/
Birch's " Sketch of a Hieroglyphical Dictionary."
This work of word-collecting had been somewhat interrupted
by his duties in the Public Record Office in 1834-5, but soon
after he entered the Museum he took it up with redoubled zeal,
and he copied every hieroglyphic text and transcribed every
hieratic papyrus which the Museum possessed. In 1837, the year
in which Lepsius published his famous Letter to Rosellini, Birch
revised his slips carefully, and decided to attempt to publish a
" Hieroglyphical Dictionary." In those days no fount of hiero
glyphic type existed, and lithography was expensive, and publishers
were not eager to spend their money on a dictionary of a language
of which scarcely a dozen people in the whole world had any
real knowledge. At length Messrs. William Allen & Co., of Publication'
Leadenhall Street, London, were induced to consider the publica- " sketch of a

M. ChampoUion, and of their application to the monuments of the
Egyptians." The dictionary does not claim even comparative
perfection, " but it has been judged that the publication of such
a work might be of slight service to those who are desirous of
possessing, in a compendious form, the results of much labour,
comparison and instruction." The matter contained in the work
is not entirely original, but the arrangement is, and " if not
scientific, [it is] perhaps the only one by which tyros could at
once find the particular group or word which they seek. It may
be termed ideophonetic, as it embraces both principles of ideal
and phonetic classification, and its arrangement has been borrowed
from a language very cognate in its construction—the Chinese."
The hieroglyphical and English part of the Dictionary was
to be divided into two parts. Part I was to contain words " com
mencing with symbols, representatives of sounds, or phonetic,"
and Part II words " whose initial character is the equivalent of
an idea, or ideographic." Part I was to be " subdivided into
symbols, having the power of vowels or consonants, the vowels
forming (on account of one symbol frequently having the force
of many) one large class, and the consonants, according to their
position in the Coptic alphabet." That is to say. Division I of
Part I was to contain symbols or characters some of which Birch held
to be polyphonous, and Division II symbols to which he had given
consonantal values, and these were to be arranged in the order
of the letters of the Coptic Alphabet. The internal classification
of the characters or symbols was to be strictly ideographical,
" taking the symbols in their arrangement, according to the
rank they hold in natural and other sciences, as the human form,
limbs, animals, inanimate objects, etc." At the end of the
Dictionary Birch intended to give "all the symbols in a similar
classification, and in a tabular view," and this section was to
form the key to the whole work. With the view of illustrating
the way in which he intended his Dictionary to be used, he says,
" Suppose, for example, it were required to find the meaning
of a group beginning with a human eye [-«s>-]—as the eye is a
component part of the human body, it will be found in that
division in the table, and there will be affixed to the depicted eye,
v[ide Nos] 13-43." In this group of words will be found all those
words in which an eye [-=2^] is the first character ; and the eye
generally represents a vowel. These remarks will be clear to the
reader after examining the two pages from Birch's " Sketch of
a Hieroglyphical Dictionary," which are reproduced on pp. xviii



Introduction. xxi
and xix. The twelve-paged specimen which he published only
illustrates the plan and arrangement of what he called the
" Phonetic Division" of his Dictionary, and it is much to be
regretted that he did not issue specimens of the other Divisions.
The above extracts from Birch's Preface and the specimen pages First
which are here given prove beyond all doubt that^ he had grasped application of
the importance of the " phonetic principle " for lexicographical principle to
purposes, and that he was the first to apply it to the arrangement ^. Egyptian
of the words of the Egyptian language. He says that he borrowed
[the idea of] his " ideophonetic arrangement " from the Chinese,
a statement which should be noted. My colleague, Mr. L. Giles,
the Sinologist, informs me that though the Chinese had no alphabet
they developed a phonetic principle. Some eighty per cent, of
the characters of the language are made up of two parts, one
part serving as a phonetic and giving a clue to the sound of the
word, and the other as a " classifier," which gives a clue as to
its MEANING ;i the " classifiers "^ are in number about 214, and Classifiers and
the phonetic symbols between 1,600 and 1,700. In the case of determina
. . tives.
Egyptian the signs which are now called " determinatives " are
the equivalents of the " classifiers," and the alphabetic characters
are the equivalents of the phonetic symbols in Chinese texts.
Sad to relate. Birch's " Sketch " did not meet with sufficient
encouragement to induce the publisher to continue the publication
of the " Hieroglyphical Dictionary," and no more parts appeared.

had made one list containing all the hieroglyphic characters he
had found, and another list containing all the characters the
meaning of which appeared to be manifest. He wrote each
character on a separate card, and afterwards tabulated them
systematically. Already in 1818-19 he had made a manuscript

characters, figurative, symbolic and phonetic, and was able to
prove that they were employed simultaneously in the texts of
all periods, he began to compile an Egyptian Dictionary. He
first wrote each word on a separate slip of paper, or card, and
then copied each on to a separate sheet of small folio paper,
ruled in five columns. Col. i gave the character in outline and
its hieratic form. Col. 2 its name, Col. 3 its graphic character
(symbolic, figurative or phonetic). Col. 4 its actual meaning or
value, and Col. 5 a reference to the text in which it had that
value. Thus the Dictionary existed in duplicate, in slips and
Rosellini's ^^ sheets, and it had assumed very large proportions before

Introduction. xxiii
ChampoUion died on March 4th, 1832, and when his brother Disapearance
wished to take steps to pubhsh the Dictionary he found that as of portions of
a result of " funestes conseils des plus funestes passions," one mss.
half of each copy of the Dictionnaire had been carried off, but
by whom Champollion-Figeac does not say in his edition of the
Dictionnaire. All that he says on the subject there is that in
spite of all opposition he succeeded in 1840 in regaining pos- -j-j^eji
session of 329 folios of the copy of the Dictionnaire, which was recovery by
written out fairly on sheets of paper, and a large number of the pige'ac^in"'^

form. And that having these in his hands he felt justified in
thinking that he was in possession of both manuscript copies
of the Dictionnaire in a nearly complete state. In a footnote
he refers to a pamphlet in which he tell us how he regained
possession of the parts of the two manuscript copies of the
Dictionnaire which had disappeared, and as the pamphlet is
now very rare, and his story is not generally known, I summarise
it here.
ChampoUion-Figeac's pamphlet is entitled. Notice sur les
Manuscrits Autographes de ChampoUion le Jeune perdus en I'Annce
1832, et retrouves en 1840. Paris, March, 1842. He says that
when in April, 1832, he set to work to arrange his brother's literary
effects with the view of offering the MSS. to the Government, portions of

for them among his brother's friends, but they could give him
no information about them, and the only result of his labour
was to make widely known the fact that they were lost. The
savants of the day, remembering how freely ChampoUion lent his
writings to his intimate friends, hoped that they were not lost
but only mislaid by some friend who had forgotten all about them.
A year passed, and nothing was heard of the lost manuscripts.
Meanwhile Champollion-Figeac began to suspect that one of his champollion
brother's friends, a man who was peculiarly indebted to him, had Figcac's
them in his possession. This friend was a young ItaUan called g^n^g
Salvolini, a native of Faenza, who came to Paris to study Egyp
tology in 1 83 1, and who became a close friend of ChampoUion and
his family. ChampoUion-Figeac's suspicions were aroused by the suspicion falls

Stone, the Book of the Dead, etc., which he intended to publish

who had only studied Egyptian for a year could produce an
elaborate work on difficult Egyptian texts in three volumes
quarto was absurd on the face of it, and as Champollion-Figeac
knew that his brother had written monographs on the very texts
that were mentioned in the prospectus, he came to the conclusion
that Salvolini had stolen the missing manuscripts. This was
Effrontery of quite possible, for Salvolini had had free access to the study of
Salvolini. ChampoUion, and was constantly in his house during his last
illness. In August, 1833, at a public meeting of the Academic
des Inscriptions Silvestre de Sacy solemnly called upon the man
or men who had the missing manuscripts in their possession
to restore them to their author's family, and Salvolini had the
audacity to join him in mourning the loss of them, and with tears
in his eyes he implored the man who had them to give them up.
And at that moment he was announcing the publication of them
under his own name ! Still nothing was heard of the missing
Salvolini's manuscripts. In February, 1838, Salvolini died, aged 28. Cham
pubhcations— poUion-Figeac tried to find out what papers he had left behind,
and was told that they had been claimed by a foreign messenger,
and that they had been sent beyond the Alps. As a matter of
fact, they had never left Paris, where they remained forgotten
in some rooms. When Salvolini died his relatives commissioned
Verardi the an artist, Luigi Verardi, to wind up his affairs, and when this
artist offers gentleman examined the effects the manuscripts on which was

scripts were the work of Salvolini, and wishing to do the best he
could for his friend's family, tried to sell them, but no one would
buy them. Finally, not knowing what else to do with the manu
scripts, he wished to show them to Charles Lenormant, the friend
and fellow traveller of ChampoUion, and to take his advice on
the subject. At first Lenormant refused to look at them, but
after a time, to oblige his friend Verardi, he agreed to do so.
Lenormant As soon as Lenormant began to turn over the leaves of the bundles

MSS. stolen ^^ once two of the works of ChampoUion, the loss of which had
by Salvolini. been publicly deplored by Silvestre de Sacy at the meeting of
the Academic mentioned above. There was no longer any doubt
about the matter. Salvolini had stolen the manuscripts of his
friend and master, and as he made no response to de Sacy's appeal
for their restoration, it was quite clear that he had intended to
keep them. With the manuscripts of ChampoUion were several

papers that were the work of Salvolini, but when Lenormant showed Verardi a whole volume which ChampoUion had written
in French with his own hand, and pointed out to him the title,
" Storia d'Egitto par F. Salvolini," which Salvolini had written
on the title sheet, Verardi was convinced that he had been
deceived by his dead friend. He realised quickly that Cham
poUion's manuscripts must be given up to his heirs, and showed
himself amenable to Lenormant's representations. Lenormant Lenormant

possession of all Champollion's stolen manuscripts, and handed
them over to the Government, who, by a special resolution passed
on the 24th of April, 1833, had ordered their acqusition in the
interests of science. Salvolini published the first volume of the
" Analyse Grammaticale " in 1836 ; the second and third volumes
did not appear. His papers fill five volumes. See Catalogue
des Papyrus ligyptiens de la Bibliotheque Nationale, Paris, No.
331, MS. 4to. See also the two letters to M. C. Gazzera in Des
principales expressions qui servant a la Notation des Dates sur les
Monuments de I'Ancienne £gypte. Paris, 1832-3. 8vo.
Champollion's manuscripts, however, needed a great deal of
alteration and arrangement before they could be printed. And
their editor describes in detail how he was himself obliged to make
a copy of the Dictionary in which he incorporated the contents
of both the slips and the folios, as well as very many important
particulars from his brother's Grammaire ^gyptienne. Having Champollion
written out all his material, he had to decide how to arrange h/f brother^s
the words. This was no easy matter, and finally he adopted MSS.
the system which was foreshadowed in his brother's " Memoire
sur r^criture Hieratique," and was printed in 1821. At that
time ChampoUion was endeavouring to classify and arrange the
Egyptian hieroglyphs, and found great difficulty in doing so.
He believed that the ancient Egyptians must have had some
system of arrangement for them, though he had no support for
this view, and no evidence on the subject was forthcoming from
native sources, and none from the works of classical writers.
Finally he adopted a " methodical, or so to say, natural classi- Champollion's

Egyptians, and whose language is substantially the same as that
of the ancient Egyptians, arranged their Vocabularies in this way,
they must be reproducing a system that had been in use among
their remote ancestors thousands of years earlier. ChampoUion
Figeac accepted his brother's arguments, and arranged the words
of the Dictionary according to the order of the Sign-list composed
by him, and printed in his earlier work.
The following paragraph will explain the general system of The Coptic
arranging words in a Coptic Vocabulary, the common native names
for which are xxotKi or juloki, and (fkocT or (5'Xoo(re , i.e. Scala,
" steps " or " stair." A typical example of such a Scala is given
in the bilingual Coptic and Arabic MS. in Brit. Mus. Orient 1325,
fol. 90 ff,^ where we find the Scala Magna (Copt, "f nioj-f XjC juloki,

The First Chapter gives the names of the Creator, nipi.rt itxe

the names of the Holy Spirit. The Second Chapter gives the
names of the world which is above, nKocJUioc eTc^. nojtwi, and

XXX Introduction.
ChampoUionFigeac accepts the arrangement of the " Scala."
He rejects the Chinese arrangement of characters.
He discusses Birch's plan and rejects it
Such was the arrangement of words in the model which
ChampoUion-Figeac took as a guide for the arrangement of words
in his brother's Egyptian Dictionary, and he asks the question
" L'experience ou le raisonnement indiquaient ils une autre
ra6thode ? " Experience, he says, suggests a single example only,
namely the Chinese, but having described at some length the
differences that exist between the Chinese and Egyptian languages,
he decides that even if analogies and a similitude between these
two languages did exist originally they do so no longer. The
Chinese Dictionary must not be employed as the model for a
Hieroglyphic Dictionary, only the Coptic Scala is any use for this
purpose. Champollion-Figeac then goes on to mention that
another system has been proposed and even tried, namely that
advocated by Samuel Birch in his " Sketch of a Hieroglyphical
Dictionary." Having examined the Preface to this work he
says, " Though the specimen, which I owe to the courtesy of Mr.
Birch, is brief, it seems to me to be sufficient to make clear the
defect in the general plan adopted by this scholar. The phonetic
characters are divided into vowel characters and consonantal
characters ; the symbolic or ideographic characters are separated
and form a section by themselves. He who would search for
the value of one of the eight hundred Egyptian characters would
then be obliged to know first of all whether it is a symbolic or
phonetic character, and when the character forms one of this
second series, to know also whether its value is that of a vowel
or a consonant, that is to say, to know beforehand all that he
seeks to learn in the Dictionary. The general table proposed by
Mr. Birch will undoubtedly facilitate his searchings, but would it
not be more advantageous to spare students (i) the labour of
searching ; (2) the trouble of finding the human eye belonging to
the vowel i, the arms belonging to the vowel A, the leg belonging
to the consonant B, the two arms raised belonging to the con
sonant K, the hand belonging to the consonant T, the mouth
belonging to the consonant R, the head full-faced belonging to the
aspirated consonant g, ; and (3) the inextricable confusion of
forms and expressions that results from the mixing-up of the
members of the human body with quadrupeds, and fish and flowers ?
On the other hand, would not all the analogous characters which
the natural or rational system would write in the same series, or
the members of the human body, or animals, or vegetables, placed
together and each species grouped m a single chapter, characterise
more clearly a system which is truly natural and, in consequence.

suffrage .1 ... In the general order of the divisions system,
[of the Dictionnaire] the characters are placed according to the
order of merit of the object which they represent ; heaven before
the stars which appear therein ; man before all other animated
creatures ; the products of the divine creation before the products
of human invention ; plants before objects of art and fantastic
emblems. Finally, the whole before its parts, and these even in champoUion

over, this order for the second character is followed equally for
the third, the fourth, etc., just as is done for the second, third
and fourth letter of the words of our dictionaries arranged in the
order of the alphabet."^ However " natural " and " rational " this system may have
been from Champollion's point of view, there is no doubt that
the beginner and student with only a limited knowledge of The "natural
hieroglyphs would find it very difficult ^o get from his Dictionary s^s'jjj^ ^"^ "
much help in reading even an ordinary historical inscription, or arrangement

on pp. xxviii, xxix, even after making due allowance for the im- Egyptologists,
perfect knowledge of the interpretation of hieroglyphs which Egyp
tologists possessed in 1832. At all events Champollion's system was
not adopted by the Egyptologists of the day, though all admitted
his Dictionnaire to be a fine monument of research and learning.
In the Preface to his " Sketch of a Hieroglyphical Dictionary,"
Birch stated that he did not intend to proceed with the publica
tion of his work until the second part of Champollion's Grammaire
^gyptienne had appeared. This decision is easily understood
and it is only natural that he should wait to see what further
details of ChampoUion's incomplete works might be contained ^\^^-^ f^^^jg
in manuscripts which Champollion-Figeac was publishing as the " natural
fast as possible. The last fascicule of the Grammaire i^gyptienne ^"t/^

appeared in 1841, and Champollion's Dictionnaire £gyptien in unpractical.

1842, and Birch and his great contemporary Lepsius spent some
years in digesting these works. Birch told me more than forty
years ago that the more he studied the monuments, and the more
he copied hieroglyphic and hieratic papyri, the more he became
convinced that ChampoUion's " natural and rational " system
of arranging words in the Egyptian Dictionary was hopelessly
unpractical. He had profound respect for ChampoUion's learning
and ability, but he could not give his " suffrage " to the Diction
naire as ChampoUion-Figeac hoped he would. In the end he decided
once and for all that in continuing his lexicographical labours he
must adopt a purely phonetic, i.e., alphabetic arrangement, even
though it implied the rejection of the " ideophonetic " arrangement
which he himself had proposed in 1838. Moreover, his own
study of the Sallier and Anastasi Papyri, which the British Museum
acquired about that time, convinced him of the fact that the time
for the publication of a really useful Egyptian Dictionary had not
yet come. Material out of which a dictionary might be compiled
existed in abundance, but it was unpublished. What was most
wanted was good copies of texts on which scholars in every country
could work, and the Trustees of the British Museum rendered
Egyptology great service when they published the wonderfully
good copies of the Sallier and Anastasi Papyri, made by Mr. Nether
clift under the superintendence of Birch.^ Dr. Leemans urged the
Government of the Netherlands to publish the monuments and
papyri at Leyden, and they wisely did so,^ and Lepsius put an
end to vague talk about the Book of the Dead when he published
a facsimile of the famous Turin Codex, containing the Saite
Recension of this important work. Further, the last-named
scholar, having persuaded the Prussian Government of the
importance of collecting the
Egypt, was despatched to that
the work, and so was able

Introduction. xxxiii
Birch's Dictionary of Hieroglyphics.
Birch's decision to adopt a purely alphabetic arrangement in
his Egyptian Dictionary was induced largely by the results of the
careful study of the alphabetic hieroglyphs which Edward Hincks
carried out after the appearance of ChampoUion's Dictionnaire
Egyptien. Whilst making this study he was in frequent com- Hincks's
munication with Birch, who was greatly impressed with his clear- researches,
ness of thought and the ease with which he recognised the
difficulties of the problem, and found their true solution. Birch
was at that time engaged in preparing a list of Egyptian characters^
for the first volume of Bunsen's "Aegyptens Stelle," and the
matter for the last three Sections in it,^ and, judging from Bunsen's
remark,^ Birch's official duties left him very little leisure for the
compilation of his Dictionary. Hincks published the results of
his investigation in 1847,* and in that year Birch, as he himself Birch begins
, • 1 1 • r 1 • X- • XA • • to wnte his
told me, began to write the slips tor his Egyptian Dictionary, Dictionary of
and to arrange them alphabetically in boxes. The work of Hieroglyphics,
publishing and reading new texts occupied him for several years,
but at length the large mass of material which he had collected
justified him in considering the publication of his work. There
upon arose the two difficult questions : Was the Dictionary to be
printed or lithographed ? Who would undertake the expense of
publication ? To print it was impossible, for there was no fount
of Egyptian type in existence. It might, of course, be litho
graphed, but that pre-supposed the writing out of the whole
Dictionary on transfer paper by Birch himself, a work that would
require a vast amount of time and labour. As no immediate Typographical
solution of the difficulty seemed possible, Birch continued to ' ^^ ^^^'
write slips and revise his manuscript.
Meanwhile Bunscn had published further additions to his
voluminous "Historical Investigation into Egypt's Place in
' This list contained about 830 characters, and was printed on eight plates in the first volume of Bunsen's work (Hamburg and Gotha, 1845. 8vo). 2 Bunsen thanks his friends for their help (Vorrede, p. xxvi, Vol. I) " und Samuel Birch am Britischen Museum (in welchem ein grosser Theil der drei Ictzten Abschnitte des ersten Buches geschrieben ist), sageu wir Dank mit freudigen Wiinschen." ^ Ein voUstandiges Worterbuch des Hieroglyphenschatzes, mit alien Maiinigfaltigkeiten der Darstellung und mit Anfiihrung des Textes der entscheidenden StcUen, darf die gelehrte Welt von Herr Birch erwarten, sobald seine amthchen

XXXIV Introduction.
An English edition of Bunsen's " Aegyptcns Stelle" called for.
A fount of hieroglyphic type cast in London.
Birch edits the fifth
volume of Bunsen's work.
Universal History," which excited general interest not only on the
Continent, but in England, and an English edition was called for.
Negotiations with Messrs. Longman were entered into, presumably
by Bunsen himself, and the outcome of them was that, at a very
heavy cost, they undertook to cast a fount of hieroglyphic type
in order to print Birch's Egyptian Sign-List, Grammar, Dictionary
and Chrestomathy as essential portions of the English edition
of the first and fifth volumes of Bunsen's work.^ Thus a firm of
publishers undertook to perform, at their own private expense,
a task which abroad would have been heavily subsidised by the
Government. The designs for the bold, handsome type (see a speci
men page of the Dictionary on p. xxxvii) were drawn by Mr. Joseph
Bonomi, the matrices were cut by Mr. L. Martin, and the casting
was carried out by Mr. Branston, all under Birch's direction.
When the printing of Birch's Egyptian Dictionary began I have
been unable to find out, but I remember his saying that it took
nearly three years to pass the sheets through the press, even after
the greater number of the types were cast and ready for use.
The English translation of the fifth volume of " Egypt's Place
in Universal History " appeared in the first half of the year 1867,
and the official date stamp of the copy in the British Museum
reads " 11 Ju[ly] 67." It was seen through the press by Birch
after the death of Bunsen and Cottrell, the English translator,
and in the Preface Birch says that " a few words are required to
indicate the additional labours which have been bestowed upon
it, and the introduction of certain portions which are not to be
found in the German Edition." The first 122 pages were revised
by Bunsen, who was enabled to use the English translation of the
Turin Codex of the Book of the Dead which Birch had made and
placed in his hands. The Hieroglyphic Grammar, Chrestomathy
and Dictionary, which according to the original plan of the work
' Writing at Highwood on September 27th, 1847, Bunsen says in the Postscript to the first Enghsh edition of Vol. I, " This English edition owes many valuable remarks and additions to my learned friend, Mr. Samuel Birch, particularly in the grammatical, lexicographic, and mythological part. That I have been able to make out of the collection of Egyptian roots, printed in the German edition, a complete hieroglyphical dictionary, is owing to him. To him
also belong the references to the monumental evidence for the signification of an Egyptian word, wherever the proof exhibited in Champollion's dictionary or grammar is not clear or satisfactory. Without any addition to the bulk of the volume, and without any incumbrance to the text, the work may now be said to contain the only complete Egyptian grammar and dictionary, as well as the only existing collection and interpretation of all the hieroglyphical signs ; in short, all that a general scholar wants to make himself master of the hieroglyphic system by studying the monuments."



Introduction. xxxv
were to form parts of the fifth volume, were not completed when
Bunsen died on November 28th, i860. The unfinished translation
of the comparative vocabularies was completed by Birch and
Dr. Rieu, Assistant Keeper of Oriental Manuscripts in the British The
Museum, who also inserted ' Bunsen's adc^itions and corrections, vocabularies
Birch's translation of the Book of the Dead, together with his completed by
Introduction, fills 209 pages (pp. 125-333), the Egyptian Dictionary j^j^^
fills 250 pages (pp. 337-586), and the Hieroglyphic Grammar and
Chrestomathy fill 153 pages (pp. 589-741). Thus the original
matter supplied by him to the fifth volume fills 612 pages, or nearly
three-quarters of the whole volume. The number of entries on a Birch's
page of the Egyptian Dictionary averages eighteen, and the total ?°"/,"^fl//{^"^
number of entries is therefore about 4,500. volume.
" The Dictionary," Birch says in his Preface, " is phonetic
in its arrangement, the words being placed under the phonetic
value[s] of the signs at the time of compilation. It is important
to remember this, as Egyptologists give a different power to a
few signs, or regard others as polyphone[s]. The ideographic and
determinative hieroglyphics, having been already given in the
first volume,! have not been repeated in this, and the student
must seek them in their appropriate places. It is also to be borne
in mind that the meaning of all Egyptian words has not yet been
determined, and that the researches of Egyptologists continue to
enrich the number of interpreted words. A reference to the place
where it is found is given with each word, but it was not possible,
without exceeding the limits of this work, to give in every instance
the name of the scholar who discovered its meaning [here follows
' Bunsen says (" Egypt's Place," Vol. I, p. 503), " I have, together with Mr. Birch, submitted to the test of accurate criticism all the hieroglyphical signs hitherto collected and explained, and have classified each of them in its proper place, according to that arrangement. [The general arrangement is laid down in the text.] At the same time I have requested that gentleman to add his own
valuable remarks to this collection, so as to complete and correct it. . . . Through his assistance I am enabled to give, not only a more critical, but also a more complete exposition of the hieroglyphical signs, than has hitherto been embodied in previous works, all of which are very expensive, and some very rare. Where the Grammar or Dictionary of ChampoUion is not quoted, the signs and interpretations are supplied by Mr. Birch from other authorities or his own researches. . . . The arrangement is the natural one, proposed and adopted by ChampoUion, in the early stages of the study of hieroglyphics : viz.,
signs of astronomical or geographical objects ; human forms, animals—from the
quadruped down to the worm—plants, stones, instruments, etc., and signs as
yet undeciphered." The List contains : A. Ideogr.\phics, 890 characters. B. Determinatives, 201 characters. C. Phonetics, C. I, 153 characters
;
C. II, 135 characters. D. Mixed Characters, 70 characters.

xxxvi Introduction.
Contemporary mention of Hincks, Goodwin and Le Page Renouf in England,
Egyptologists, chabas, E. de Rouge, Deveria in France, H. Brugsch, Diimichen,
Lauth, Lepsius and Pleyte in Germany, as being the men to whom
the advance of the study of Egyptology is principally due]. The
advantage of [Messrs. Longmans'] hieroglyphic type to the present
volume cannot be too highly appreciated, as it has rendered it
practicable to print the Egyptian Dictionary, the Grammar, and
the Chrestomathy in a form which renders the study of the
hieroglyphs accessible both to the student and general enquirer.
The Dictionary is the only one hitherto printed in this country,
opinion of his nor has any hieroglyphical dictionary appeared elsewhere, except
Dictionary of that of ChampoUion, published in 1841 [read 1842I, which contained
Hieroglyplucs. , ^ , , ... , V , • -m
only a few of. the prmcipal words. Its phonetic arrangement will,
it is hoped, render it particularly easy of consultation. It has
been a great labour to compile and print it, and the execution of
it has been a task of many years. Other Egyptologists, indeed,
have attached vocabularies to their labours on particular inscrip
tions, but no dictionary on a large scale has as yet been attempted,
although the absolute want of one has been long felt." This
Preface is dated April 13th, 1867. The publication of the first
Egyptian Dictionary arranged on phonetic, i.e., alphabetic,
principles, and printed in hieroglyphic type, was a great triumph
for English Egyptology and the craft of the typographer, and to
Birch the compiler and Spottiswoode the prhiter, and Longmans
the publishers, every Egyptologist owes a debt of gratitude.
But it is quite impossible to hide the fact that the inclusion
of Birch's Egyptian Dictionary in the fifth volume of the English
Birch's translation was a great misfortune for the Dictionary itself and
Egyptian fQj- ^he beginner in Egyptology for whom the work was primarily
falls " flat." intended. There was an interval of seven years between the
publication of the fourth and fifth volumes of the English transla
tion of Aegyptens Stelle in der Weltgeschichte, and there seems to
be no doubt that public interest in Bunsen's scheme of chronology
drooped when its author died in i860, the year which saw tlie
appearance of the fourth volume, and was practically dead when
the fifth volume was published in 1867. According to Birch,
the volume fell " flat," and its editor and publishers were greatly
disappointed. Whether the edition was a small one or not I have
no evidence to show, but it was certainly the fact that for some
reason or other copies of the volume were difficult to get in the
early " seventies." It was said at the time that the publishers,
being dissatisfied with the sales, had " disposed " of the sheets

xxxviii Introduction.
of a large number of copies. The natural result was that when
people found out that the volvime contamed Birch's Dictionary
and Grammar and Chrestomathy the copies that found their
way into the market fetched relatively very high prices, or at all
events prices which effectively placed the book beyond the reach
of the ordinary student. When I attended Birch's Egyptian
classes in 1875-76 and needed the book urgently, I was obliged
Bunsen's fifth to trace each page of it on a separate sheet of tracing paper,
tombaf ^ omitting the references, and when these sheets were bound I
Birch's used them for some years with great benefit. Moreover, the
Hieroglvphics ^^^^ volume of the English translation of Bunsen's work formed a
veritable tomb for Birch's Dictionarj^. The title-page of it sets
forth quite clearly that the " Historical Investigation " was by
Bunsen, and that it was translated from the German by Charles
H. Cottrell, Esq., M.A., and that it contains " Additions by
Samuel Birch, LL.D." But who could possibly imagine from this
last remark that Birch's contribution was 594 pages, i.e., nearly
three-quarters of the whole volume, or that his contribution
included an Egyptian Dictionary, the first ever published
arranged on phonetic principles (!), and containing about 4,500
entries of Egyptian words, and names of gods and places, with
references and translations, and an Egyptian Grammar and
Chrestomathy ? Or, again, take the case of the student who wants
to consult these works and who, hearing that copies of them are to
be seen in the British Museum Library, goes to the Reading Room
to see them. He turns up the entry Birch, Samuel, LL.D., of the
British Museum, in the Great Catalogue, but fails to find any mention
of the Dictionary of Hieroglyphics or Grammar and Chrestomathy,
because they are not mentioned in any one of the columns of names
of the other books and papers which Birch wrote. All that he will
find connecting Birch with an Egyptian Dictionary is the entry,
" Sketch of a Hieroglyphical Dictionary, London, 1838," and unless
he receives further instruction he will conclude that the " Sketch "
published in 1838 is useless to him, and that Birch's Egyptian Die
Birch's tionary never appeared. The same is the case with Birch's transla
the Book of" ^^^^ ^^ t^*^ Book of the Dead, the first ever made and published,
the Dead and which also appeared in the fifth volume of " Egypt's Place," and his
Hiero<'lyphics. ^^^* °^ Hieroglyphic Characters which appeared in the first volume,
first with plates of characters, and secondly with the hieroglyphic
characters printed in the new type. The only mention of Birch
in the Great Catalogue in connection with the Book of the Dead
is contained in the title of the Trustees' publication of the texts

on the coffin of Amamu. The fault Ues not with any of the
generations of the learned and devoted men who have spent their
lives in compiling that wonderful Great Catalogue, with its
millions of entries of books in every printed language of the world,
but with those who buried in their own books Birch's greatest
works so effectually that they have no mention under his name in
the authors' great Book of Life, the British Museum Catalogue.
In his admirable Bibliography, The Literature of Egypt and the
Soudan, 2 vols., London, 1886, 4to, Prince Ibrahim Hilmy rightly
mentioned the translation of the Book of the Dead, and the
Dictionary of Hieroglyphics and the Hieroglyphic Grammar under
the entry Birch, Samuel, LL.D., etc. But even so, he refers the
reader for particulars of these works to the entry Bunsen, C. C. J.
Heinrich Brugsch and his " Hieroglyphisch-Demotisches worterbuch."
The publication of Bunsen's Aegyptens Stelle in der Welt
geschichte in 1845 fired the imagination of a young German called
Heinrich Brugsch, ^ who was at that time a pupil in the Real Brugsch's
studies in
Gymnasium at Cologne, and he devoted himself ardently to the demotic
study of the Egyptian inscriptions in the demotic character. In
1849 he published the paper. Die demotische Schrift der alten Aegypter
und ihre Monumente, in the Zeitschrift of the German Oriental
Society (Bd. Ill, pp. 262-272), and in 1850 he received his Doctorate His editions of
from the University of Berlin for his Thesis De Natura et Indole demotic texts
Linguae Popularis Aegyptiorum, Berlin (Diimmler, 1850, 8vo).
In the same year he published Die Inschrift von Rosette, nach ihreni
Aegyptisch-demotischen Texte sprachlich und sachlich erkldrt, with
an Appendix containing a series of hitherto unpublished demotic
texts. In 185 1 he published the hieroglyphic text of the Rosetta
Stone, 2 with a Hieroglyphic-Coptic-Latin vocabulary and a list of
hieroglyphic characters, and after a Mission to Egypt in 1853-54 His Grammar
he published his famous Grammaire De'motique.^ Ten years later of demotic
he published his epoch-making work on the Rhind Papyri," and
proved himself to be an expert in translating very difficult hieratic
and demotic texts. Brugsch did not confine his studies to demotic,
and between 1855 and 1865 he was engaged in drawing up a

xl Introduction.
His mission to Persia.
Race for priority between Brugsch and Birch.
Brugsch's Hieroglyphic Demotic Dictionary.
History of Ancient Egypt under its native kings,' and in pub
lishing a series of geographical texts, ^ etc. He was attached to
the Mission to Persia of the Baron Minutoli in 1850-51, and served
as Prussian Vice-Consul in Cairo from 1864 to 1866, but in spite
of the official duties attached to these posts he managed to find
time to undertake the compilation of a Hieroglyphic Dictionary.
It is more than probable that he knew that Birch was engaged on
a similar task, but if he had this knowledge, it did not prevent
him from making arrangements for the publication of his work.
That Birch knew of these arrangements is quite certain, for his
name appears in the list of subscribers issued by the publisher.
Each scholar naturally wished to be the first in the field with
his Egyptian Dictionary, so that he might claim the credit of
being the first to publish a really large collection of ancient Egyp
tian words arranged alphabetically. In this race for priority
Birch was the winner, for he dated his short Preface to the fifth
volume of " Egypt's Place " on April 13th, 1867, and his whole
Dictionary was then printed off. In the other case only the
first volume of Brugsch's Hieroglyphic-Demotic Dictionary, con
taining the letters '^, \\, -—D, v\ and ^, was printed off at that
time, and the publisher's advertisement on the cover is dated
" Ende April 1867," though Brugsch's Preface is dated Marz 1867.
The Hieroglyphic-Demotic Dictionary^ of Brugsch is, with
the exception of the Introduction, lithographed throughout.
The first four volumes form the Dictionary proper and con
tain 1,707 pages, and the last three form the Supplement,
and contain 1,418 pages. The number of words treated in the
Dictionary proper is 4,637, not counting the additions in the
Supplement, which were derived from newly published texts.
Whilst writing out his Dictionary for the lithographer, Brugsch's
object seems to have been to make the work as large as possible.
He states his views on points of Egyptian Grammar at great
but unequal length, and many of his paragraphs are filled with
1 Histoire d'/igypte sous les Rois indighies. Paris, 1859. ^ Geographische Inschriften Altcigyptischer Denktndler, Bande I-III, Leipzig, 1857-60 ; Die Geographic der Aegypter nach den Denkmalern. Leipzig, i860.

extracts from Egyptian texts followed by translations and wordy
comments. In some respects his work resembles an Encyclo
paedia of Egyptology rather than a Dictionary, and contains a
great deal of information which, it seems to me, should have
been given elsewhere. As no publisher could afford to defray the
cost of printing the Dictionary, even on the Continent, where great
scholarly works are often subsidized by the Government, it was
decided to reproduce Brugsch's manuscript by lithography, which
in those days was a tolerably inexpensive method of publication ; B^gsch's
and Brugsch undertook to write the transfers for the lithographer knowledge of
with his own hand. Thus he was given practically a free hand Egyptology,
by his publisher, and a Dictionary containing 3,125 pages is the
result. The amount of Egyptological knowledge which he dis
plays in this truly great work is marvellous, and his familiarity
with the contents of the most difficult texts, whether hieroglyphic,
hieratic or demotic, is phenomenal. He was the greatest Egyp
tologist that Germany had produced, and his energy and zeal and
devotion and power of work must ever command our warmest
admiration. Brugsch, like Birch, arranged the words in his
Hieroglyphic Dictionary alphabetically, and it is an interesting
fact that both scholars, apparently independently, came to the
conclusion that ChampoUion's " natural and rational " system of He rejects
arrangement must be rejected. Birch, as we know from his J^hampoihons
Preface to the fifth volume of " Egypt's Place," had no high rational-"
opinion of ChampoUion's Dictionnaire £gyptien as a Dictionary, a'Tangement.
for he says that it " contained only a few of the principal words."
Brugsch dedicated his Dictionary to the Manes of ChampoUion,
and in his Introduction says that ChampoUion's Dictionary, which
was published five and twenty years ago, after its author's death,
under the name of Dictionnaire Egyptien, could and can lay claim
to-day at the very least to this name. He goes on to say that
it was published without the will and intention of the immortal Bragsch's
French scholar, and that it consists of little more than an epitome °P""°" °! ,
^ ChampoUion s
of the words and groups in his Grammaire Egyptienne, and that Egyptian
it contains mistakes of which the master, had he been alive, would Dictionary,
never have allowed himself to be guilty.^

xlii Introduction.
Birch contemplates a second edition of his Dictionary of Hieroglyphics.
Maspero's edition of the Pyramid Texts.
Birch dies and leaves his manuscript for the second edition unfinished.
WJiilst Birch was preparing the manuscript of his Dictionary
for the printer, and seeing the sheets through tlic press, other
Egyptologists, e.g., Goodwin, E. de Rouge, Chabas, Deveria,
Diimichen, Lepsius and Pleyte were actively engaged in publishing
and translating hieroglyphic, hieratic and demotic texts. And
long before he had finished printing his Dictionary, Birch had come
to the conclusion that he must prepare a second edition in which
he could give all the new words and forms that appeared in the
newly published texts. As he read these texts he noted every
word and form that ought to be in the new edition, and he con
tinued to write slips for many years. Those who have visited
him in his room in the British Museum may remember the glass
box containing slips for this new edition ; this always stood in
front of his inkstand and was added to daily. More than one
publisher was ready to publish the new edition of his Dictionary,
but his multitudinous duties and advancing years prevented him
from reading all the texts that were published. And he did not
see that if ever he was to publish the new edition he must at some
time or other cease from the writing of slips and adding to his
manuscript, and so he rejected the advice both of his publisher
and his friends, and continued to write ever more and more slips.
In 1882 Maspero began to publish the hieroglyphic inscriptions
from the Pyramids of Sakkarah in the Recueil de Travaux, and
in them Birch found whole paragraphs of Egyptian text similar
to passages in the funerary texts on the coffin of Amamu, which
he was preparing for publication b}^ the Tnistees. Naturally
he was anxious to include in his new edition as many as possible
of the words and forms from these very ancient texts, and he set
to work to read them and to extract from them additional matter
for his Dictionary. He found his task more difficult than he
imagined it would be, for though he doubted the accuracy of
many of the readings of Maspero's text, he had no means in the
shape of photographs or paper " squeezes " whereby to control
them. Moreover, he was seventy years of age and his health
was failing. But he struggled on gallantly and continued to write
slips for the new edition of his Dictionary (which he was certain
he would live to see) until death overtook him on December 26tli,
1885. When his books and literary effects were being sold
several boxes containing many thousands of slips were put up
to be bid for as a separate lot, and a bidder bought them
for ten shillings. Thus the labour of twenty years was
wasted.

PiERRET's " VOCABULAIRE HiEROGLYPHIQUE."
The difficulty of obtaining copies of Birch's Dictionary of Hiero
glyphics, and the expense of both that work and Brugsch's Wor
terbuch practically left the students of the ancient Egyptian
language without a dictionary. The first scholar who made any
serious attempt to help the beginner and the advanced student
out of their difficulty was Paul Pierret, Conservateur adjoint
des Antiquites Egyptiennes au Musee du Louvre, and he set to
work to compile the handy and comparatively inexpensive
Vocabulaire Hieroglyphique,^ which so many students have found Pierret's
to be a useful book of reference. It consists of 759 lithographed vocabuiarv.
pages in which the words are arranged alphabetically, and an
index to all the French words by which the hieroglyphic words
are translated in the volume, which fills forty-eight double
columned pages. It contains, in a condensed form, the substance
of the Dictionaries of Birch and Brugsch, and most of the 987
royal names which Lepsius published in his Konigsbuch der alien
Aegypter, Berlin, 1858, fol., and most of the 2,000 geographical
names given by Brugsch in his Dictionnaire Geographique, Leipzig,
1877, fol. 2 In his Preface Pierret calls attention to the fact that
Brugsch's Dictionary cost 600 francs, and this was without the Inclusion of
Supplement, which cost about 500 francs more when it was ^^^ ^ycid »
completed in 1882. He justifies his inclusion of geographical names,
names in his Vocabulaire by pointing out what every one has
found who has tried to use the Dictionnaire Geographique, how 1
difficult it is to find a given name in that " merveille d'erudition." ^
He claims no special merit for his Vocabulaire, and says, " Mon
but est de fournir aux commen9ants un moyen d'aborder directe
ment les textes, et a tons un manuel commode et pratique."
There is no doubt that he succeeded in his aim.
SiMEONE Levi's " Vocabolario Geroglifico Copto-Ebraico."
For a few years after the appearance of the last volume of
Brugsch's Worterbuch in 1882 no attempt was made to publish
in a collected form the lexicographical material that could be
collected from the editions of hitherto unpublished texts, which
were appearing frequently in England, France, Germany, Russia
and Italy. But meanwhile this material was being diligently

collected by one scholar at least who was dissatisfied with the
existing Egyptian Dictionaries, and was determined to publish a
new one. This was Simeone Levi, an Italian Egyptologist, who
was well known for the very useful list of hieratic characters which
he published^ in 1880. Under the title of Pa Uatch-ur en Metchut
^^^k T\^5 ^"^^ ^"^ i- it ^ '
' ^^' ^^^ G^^C't Sea of Words,
he began to publish a Coptic-Hebrew Hieroglyphic Vocabulary
with translations of the hieroglyphic words in Italian and numerous
quotations of Coptic and Hebrew words which he held to be
cognate to the ancient Egyptian words."
The Vocabolario proper consists of six parts folio, which were
published in 1887-88 and contain 1,705 lithographed double
columned pages ; the Supplement consists of two parts, and
contains 6g6 pages ; Part I was published in i88g, and Part II
in 1894. In a very closely written Preface, which fills 30 pages,
Signor Levi discusses the grammar and the structure of the ancient
Egyptian language, which he treats as though the speech that is
revealed to us by the hieroglyphic, hieratic and demotic texts
belonged to the Semitic family of languages. It was a mistake
on his part to do this, for he assumed to be a fact that which has
never been proved ; to him Egyptian, Coptic and Hebrew are
substantially forms of one and the same language. He adopted
an unusual arrangement of the alphabet, placing h ro and h |
after tch ^^, and t c>, or \, and t c=^> after sh r-vn, and kh (x)
® and t at the end of the alphabet, etc. Thus the arrangement
and the values of the letters of his alphabet are as follows :

The list of published Egyptian Dictionaries ends with the

The Present Egyptian Dictionary.
It will probably be admitted by all that the compiler of an
Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary should know at first hand
every collection of Egyptian monuments and papyri in the world,
that he should have visited every great Museum on the Continent
and in Egypt, England and America, and copied, or collated with
printed editions, every hieroglyphic, hieratic and demotic text
of importance, that he should know well the histories of Egypt Qualifications
written by classical writers, and the works of the Arab geographers, '^^^tfngTn
and Coptic in all its dialects, and that he should have had at his Egyptian
disposal unlimited time, in short that he should have been able "^ '°'^ ^*
to devote his whole life to the making of his Egyptian Dictionary.
That he should also have one or more assistants to help him in
his laborious task also goes without saying. I am conscious that,
unfortunately, I possess none of the qualifications necessary for
such a great work except in a very limited degree. Neverthe
less I have written this Dictionary and how I came to do so the
following paragraphs will show.
Between the years 1880 and 1883 the Natural History
Collections were removed from the British Museum, Bloomsbury,
to the new buildings which were specially constructed to receive
them at South Kensington. Thereupon several of the rooms of
the First and Second Northern Galleries, and the long room that
ran parallel to the fourth room of the First Northern Gallery
and had contained the studies and workrooms of the Natural Rearrange
History Staff, were allotted to the Department of Oriental Egyptian
Antiquities. When Dr. Birch, Keeper of the Department, had Collections in
removed the Collections of Egyptian and Semitic Antiquities Museum.

in hand a task which he had contemplated for many years, namely,
the compilation of a detailed description of the Egyptian hiero
glyphic and hieratic fmierary papyri. The English translation
of the Saite Recension of the Book of the Dead according to the
Turin Papyrus,^ which he published in 1867,^ had aroused universal
interest, and he was urged to supplement it with a version of the
older Theban Recension translated from the rich collection of
XVIIIth dynasty papyri in the British Museum. The smaller
papyri had been cut up into sections and mounted under sheets
of glass, and were at that time arranged in drawers in the Table
Cases in the public rooms. The longer papyri, i.e., those which
measured from 5 to 30 feet in length, had been mounted in black glazed wooden frames and hung upon the walls of the North-West
Staircase. But as in this position it was well-nigh impossible to
consult them, and as it was feared that they might suffer injury
through damp, they were taken down and, where possible, were
cut up into sections, mounted under sheets of glass and stored
with the shorter papyri. During the general rearrangement of
the papyri which followed these alterations Birch seized the
opportunity of re-examining and describing with minute care the
papyri which Professor Naville had selected as authorities for the
text of his edition of the Theban Recension of the Book of the
Dead, and he directed me to assist him in this work. He was
chiefly anxious to collect variant readings, and unusual forms of
words, and new words, and to make lists of the papyri in which
particular Chapters appeared. The work was long and difficult,
chiefly because we possessed no concordance of the words of the
Theban Recensions, and therefore could not easily identify the
Chapters in which they occurred in mutilated papyri. So long
as we were dealing with papyri containing the Saite Recension
we found Lieblein's little " Index "^ very useful, but for identifying
Chapters and passages in the Theban Recension it afforded no
help. Having grouped the funerary papyri chronologically, i.e.,
according to dynasties, Birch began to write his descriptions of
the papyri, and he directed me to make a concordance to them,
and intended to incorporate the slips that I wrote with those which
he was heaping up as material for the new edition of his " Dictionary

of Hieroglyphics," which he fully believed he would one day
publish (see p. xlii).
When I had been engaged on this work, officially and un
officially, for nearly two years, Biixh died, but I continued to write
slips for the concordance to the Theban Recension, and began
to collect words from the Bremner (Rhind) Papyrus (Brit. Mus.
No. io,i88), and other funerary works. It was now quite certain
that the new edition of Birch's " Dictionary of Hieroglyphics "
could never appear, and my friends advised me to go on collecting
Eg3'ptian words with the view of publishing a " Vocabulary "
on much the same lines as Pierret's " Vocabulaire." By that time
the slips which I had written amounted to many thousands, and I abandon
I soon found that the work of arranging them and of incorporating ^^e \dea of
the new ones consumed a vast amount of time. It was impossible concordance
to continue the work on the scale on which I had begun, and I ^° ^"^^
° funerary
foresaw that the task of making a concordance to Egyptian papyri,
literature could not be carried out by any man who could not
devote his whole time to the work.
Between 1888 and 1892 the British Museum acquired
the Papyrus of Ani, the Papyrus of Nu, the Papyrus of Nekht
and other remarkable Codices of the Theban Recension of the
Book of the Dead. The first edition (500 copies) of the Facsimile
of the Papyrus of Ani was sold in less than two years, and
it became a part of my official work to prepare a second and
more correct edition of the Facsimile and to write the volume Vocabulary to
of English text which was published with it in 1894. I made a thePapyrusof
Vocabulary to the Egyptian text, but want of space prevented
its inclusion in the volume of English translations. I then began
to make a Vocabulary to the Papyrus of Nu, and in working
through it I was so much impressed with the importance of this
Codex that I decided to publish an edition of the Theban The Papyrus
Recension, and to make it and the Papyrus of Nebseni the principal °^ ^^"
authorities for the Egyptian text. I have described the Papyrus
of Nu at length elsewhere, ^ and it is only necessary to say here
that it contains 131 Chapters, i.e., more than any other copy^ of the Book of the Dead now known. The whole papyrus is
carefully written, Nu himself probably having been the scribe.
The father of Nu was called Amen-hetep and his mother Sen
seneb, and it is prx)bable that she was no other than the lady
Senseneb, the wife of Nebseni the scribe, whose copy of the Book

the Book of Ani, and some half-dozen hymns, etc., from the Papyri of Hunefer,
the Dead. Mut-hetep and Nekht, I prepared an edition of the Egyptian texts
and translated them. When I ventured to suggest to Messrs.
Kegan Paul, who undertook to publish the edition, that text
and translation should be accompanied by a Concordance they
demurred, saying that no one wpuld buy the Concordance, or
Vocabulary, for no one wanted such a thing. Finally they
decided to print 750 copies of the Egyptian text and Vocabulary,
and 1,000 copies of the Translation, thinking there would be a larger
demand for it than for the first two volumes of the work. Two
years later they wrote to me saying that the whole edition of the
Egyptian text and Vocabulary was sold, and that as about 230
copies of the Translation were unsold they had decided to sell
them as a " remainder," and they did so. Thus it was proved
that there was a considerable demand for an Egyptian Vocabulary
My to the Theban Recension of the Book of the Dead, and that there
of°the Theban '^'^^^ students who would not buy the Translation unless they
Recension. could have the Vocabulary with it. In printing the Vocabulary
I adopted a plan hitherto untried. I placed the transliteration of
the Egyptian words in the first instead of in the second column
as was usual, for it seemed to me that it would enable the beginner
to find the word he wanted more easily and quickly. This plan
has been much approved of in England, and as it has been adopted
in an " Aegyptisches Glossar " published in Berlin in 1904 it has
evidently seemed useful to the practical Teutonic mind.
The success of the Vocabulary to the Book of the Dead
and the encouragement of many friends emboldened me to write
an Egyptian Hieroglyphic Dictionary, ^ and with this object
in view I began to collect words from Egyptian literature

great deal more. The result of all this work was that I filled many
boxes and drawers with slips on each of which a word was written,
with its certain or problematical meaning, and a reference to the
text or monument where it was to be found. In 1908 I had
written over three hundred thousand slips, and in spite of the
constant help of my wife in arranging them and in making incor
porations, I realised that the publication of such a mass of material
was impossible. No one man could write the fair copy of it for
press, and no publisher could afford to undertake its publication.
I therefore set to work to revise the slips, and to destroy all that
had redundant references, and references to words the meanings
of which were commonly accepted. In this revision I got rid of
more than one-half of the slips, but even then the compilation Revisions
was far too large, and further revision was necessary. I then ° ^ ^ 'P^*
cut out all the numerous quotations from texts, and nearly all
comments, abbreviated the references to published works, and,
at the risk of making a somewhat bald Egyptian Vocabulary,
eschewed, except in very rare cases, any attempt to discuss
theoretical renderings of words. This second revision was com
pleted in 1913, and the slips which I proposed to print numbered
nearly 28,500.
The question of publication then arose. During the early
stages of the writing of this Dictionary an understanding
existed between Mr. Blackett, Manager of Messrs. Kegan,
Paul, Trench, Triibner & Co., and myself that his firm would
endeavour to include it among their publications, but by the
time the manuscript was ready for the printer, he had left their Diificulty of
service, and they were not in a position to fulfil his wish. I talked finding a
the matter over with Mr. Horace Hart, Printer to the Oxford
University Press, and showed him the manuscript of the
Dictionary, and, having made a rough calculation of the probable
cost of printing it, he came to the conclusion that no publisher
ought to undertake the work without a subsidy. He thought printing in
that the cost of production might be lowered by printing it in Vienna
Vienna, and spoke highly of the Austrian firm of Messrs. Adolf
Holzhausen, who had already printed several books of mine,
and with whose excellent typography I was well acquainted.
Further enquiry made by me among printers and publishers
showed the correctness of Mr. Hart's opinion, and I accepted it
as final. I decided that it was unwise to attempt to reproduce
my manuscript by lithography, because works of reference
printed by lithography are often very unsatisfactory and difficult

to use, and I lacked the skill of Brugsch in writing the
transfers.
Soon after my conversation with Mr. Hart I had the oppor
tunity of placing my difficulty before a friend—an English gentle
man who has been all his life intensely interested in the ancient
languages of the Near East, and has proved himself to be a
generous patron and supporter of English archaeological enterprise
in Egypt and Western Asia for many years past. This gentleman,
who persists in his determination to remain anonymous, gave
me a sympathetic hearing, and a few days later wrote and offered
to defray the cost of printing the Dictionary in Vienna. With
heartfelt gratitude I accepted this munificent offer, and made
preparations to take the manuscript, which filled seven large
tray-boxes, each about two feet three inches in length, to Vienna
in May, 1914. The completing of a piece of work on which I
was then engaged made it necessary for me to postpone my
journey from the spring till the early autumn, when I hoped
to conclude my negotiations with Messrs. Holzhausen speedily,
and to begin to print before the end of the year. The delay
was providential for the Dictionary, for the Great War broke
out early in August, and my manuscript was safe in England ;
had it been in Vienna it would have been impossible to regain
possession of it for a very considerable time, and even if I had
eventually succeeded in recovering it, its publication must have
been delayed for some years. As things were, I was able,
with the consent of my friend and benefactor, to open
negotiations with Messrs. Harrison and Sons for. the printing
of the book, and very soon after their completion the printing
began.
The present Dictionary of Egyptian Hieroglyphs contains
nearly twenty-three thousand forms of Egyptian words collected
from texts of all periods between the time of the Hlrd Dynasty
and the Roman Period. Strictly speaking, the words belonging
to each of the great periods of Egyptian literature should have
been printed in separate sections, but the time for making such
a series of Egyptian Dictionaries has not yet arrived, it seems to
me. Birch excluded from his Dictionary the names of deities
and the names of places, and printed lists of them as Appendices
to his Dictionary of words. Pierret included in his " Vocabu
laire " the names of deities, kings and places, and made it to
contain practically all the essential parts of the Hieroglyphic
Dictionaries of Birch and Brugsch, ChampoUion's " Pantheon

^gyptien,"^ Lepsius' " Book of Kings,"^ and Bragsch's " Geo
graphical Dictionary."'' And Brugsch, expecting the student to
refer at first hand to these works, devoted all the space in his
Worterbuch to registering and explaining Egyptian words. Though
there is much to be said in favour of following this plan strictly, Names of gods
I have nevertheless included in the Dictionary of Egyptian words and goddesses
the names of all the gods and goddesses, and other mythological
beings that I have been able to collect, and thus the total number
of entries in this section of the book amounts to 23,889.
Pierret's instinct, which told him that a " Vocabulaire Hiero
glyphique " that was intended to help beginners in the study of
Egyptology, ought to contain the names of kings, was undoubtedly
correct, but it seems to me that he made a mistake in scattering
them throughout his work. As the " Konigsbuch " of Lepsius,
and the " Livre des Rois " of Brugsch and Bouriant" are out of Names
print and scarce, and the edition of my own " Book of Kings "^
^ i^a. is rapidly becoming exhausted, I have printed a full list of the
names of Egyptian kings as Part II of this work. This was
necessary, for of Das Handbuch der Aegyptischen Konigsnamen by
Pieper and Burchardt only one part has appeared (Berlin, 1912, Svo),
and few students can ever hope to possess the splendid but
expensive Le Livre des Rois de I'ilgypte, which Gauthier has
published in the Memoires of the French Archaeological Institute
of Cairo, in five parts, folio (Cairo, 1902-16). My List contains
439 entries, which give the names of all the known kings, from
Mena, the first king of all Egypt, to the Roman Emperor Decius.
It includes all their principal Ka and Nebti names, and their
names and titles as the Horus of Gold, the King of the South and
North, and the Son of Ra. It illustrates at a glance the develop
ment of the use of these names and titles, which in many cases
resemble the " strong names " that were adopted by the kings

epithets which the later Pharaohs loved to see prefixed to their
names as Kings of the South and North I have omitted, for they
only contain quite ordinary titles.
The importance to the beginner of having a list of geographical
Geographical names available for handy reference is so obvious that no
included ^.pology is needed for devoting a section of this work to a register
of the names of countries, districts, localities, cities, towns, etc.,
in Egypt, the Egyptian Sudan and Western Asia. Brugsch's
Dictionnaire Geographique, Leipzig, 1887-80, and the three volumes
of his Geographische Inschriften Altagyptischer Denkmdler , Leipzig,
1857-60, contain a vast amount of information, but the facts
needed re-stating and supplementing in the light of the studies
of modern Egyptologists. In drawing up the Geographical List,
which forms Part III of this Dictionary, and contains nearly
3,500 entries, I have derived much help from Miiller's Asien und
Geographyof Europa nach Altdgyptischen Denkmdlern, Leipzig, 1893, and
and Palestine. Burchardt's Die Altkanaandischen Fremdworte und Eigennamen im
Aegyptischen, Leipzig, 1Q09-10. In the first of these the writer
has treated the geography of Egypt and her colonies historically
and chronologically, and has grouped, in a clear and systematic
manner, all the facts that were available at the time when he
wrote the book. In the second, the author collected a mass of
material of the utmost importance for the student of Egyptian
Geography and Philology. His work is of peculiar value because
he possessed a good working knowledge of Hebrew and other
Semitic dialects, and was able to use it authoritatively in dealing
with Egyptian forms of Semitic words and place-names. Every
Egyptologist must lament the untimely death of this sound
scholar. I have also obtained much help in identifying the
original names of Syrian and Palestinian places mentioned in
The Tall Egyptian texts from Knudtzon's Die El-Amarna Tafeln, Leipzig,
al-'Amamah 1907, and Winckler's complete edition of the texts from the
Tall al-'Amarnah Tablets {Der Thontafelfund von El Amarna, Berlin, 1889). Wherever possible I have added the cuneiform
originals in the Egyptian Geographical Lists from the Tall al
'Amarnah Tablets and from the historical inscriptions of the
kings of the later Assyrian Empires which flourished between
1350 and 620 B.C. The exact positions of scores of places must
always remain unknown because their conquerors, whether
Egyptian or Assyrian, often destroyed cities and towns utterly,
and in a generation or two their sites would be forgotten.

The last section of this Dictionary contains a series of The English
Indexes. The First Index contains a complete alphabetical list
of all the English words, with references, which are used to
translate the Egyptian words, and it forms a kind of English
Egyptian Dictionary. I have found the French Index in Pierret's
Vocabulaire Hic'roglyphique very useful in reading Egyptian texts,
and I hope that mine, which is much larger and fuller, and
contains over sixty thousand references, will be acceptable to
the beginner.
The Second Index ought to assist in the identification of
royal names when they occur in mutilated texts. In it many
of the prenomens, which begin with Ra or some other god's
name, are given under two forms ; thus foea J J, the prenomen Kings' names,
of Seti I, will be found both under Ra-men-Maat and Men-Maat
Ra. The Hebrew and Greek forms of Egyptian royal names,
the identifications of which are tolerably certain, are also given.
The Third Index contains a list of geographical names. The

found in English books. These are followed by lists of the
forms in which they occur in Coptic Literature, in the works
of Greek writers, in the Hebrew Bible, in Semitic texts, and
in the cuneiform inscriptions, both Assyrian and Persian.
The Fourth Index contains a list of all the Coptic words, Coptic. Index,
with references, that occur in the Dictionary, and the Fifth

several words belonging to the late period here and there incon

with a reference to the text where it is found, and theif the

and can only be guessed at by the context. In some cases the
context makes the meaning of an unknown word comparatively
certain, but in others, especially where no probable Coptic equivalent
is forthcoming, it does not, and then any meaning suggested
is little else than the result of guesswork. In many cases, then,
the English words that are set down as translations of rare and
difficult Egyptian words must only be regarded as suggestions
The meanings ^^ ^o the probable meanings. This is especially the case with of many words certain words in the Pyramid Texts. The meaning of some of
them is tolerably clear from the determinatives, but there are
a considerable number of words in these difficult documents for
which no one has so far proposed meanings that may be con
sidered correct. The spells and magical formulae which abound
in these Texts are not only difficult to translate because of the
words of unknown meaning in them, but also because it is not
always clear where one word ends and the next begins. Even
Maspero found himself unable to translate whole sentences and
passages in them, and as none of the translations of them pro
mised by German scholars has yet appeared, it seems as though
the difficulties which they belittled in describing Maspero's edition
of the Pyramid Texts have vanquished them.

Among the words given in this Dictionary are many which
are derived from demotic texts. As my knowledge of this
branch of Egyptology is rudimentary I have relied for the cor
rectness of their transcription into hieroglyphs chiefly upon the
works of that erratic genius, E. Revillout, and Professor F. LI.
Griffith. These scholars have shown that Demotologists are Demotic
able to transcribe demotic texts into hieroglyphs, and Birch's words:
view that they were unable to do this is no longer tenable.
About the correctness of the meanings of many demotic words
given by them there can be no doubt, for the equivalents of a
great number of them, and their counterparts in form, are to
be found even in the existing Coptic " Scalae " and in the printed
Coptic Vocabularies and Dictionaries of Peyron, Tattam and
Par they.
The references to original documents and to published
editions of them in this Dictionary are, in respect of number,
unsatisfactory. They represent a compromise, and will suffer
the fate of all compromises, that is to say, they wUl satisfy
nobody. In the great collection of slips which I made first of
all there were to some words as many as sixty references, and
the slips that contained only from six to twelve references were
very few. To print all these was manifestly impossible, for the
references would have occupied far more space than the Egyp- References to

references required as much space as the Egyptian words, and
I decided that many references to the older printed literature
must be cut out, and only a limited number to recent publica
tions admitted. Further, it was clear that the names of authors
and their papers printed in the Recueil de Travaux, the Transac
tions and Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archaeology, the
Archceologia of the Society of Antiquaries of London, the Aegyp
tische Zeitschrift, and other scientific journals of the kind, would
have to be omitted, and the name of the journal quoted in an
abbreviated form. A list of the abbreviations of the titles of all
books actually quoted will be found on pp. Ixxv-lxxxvii. This is
followed by a list of all the principal books that have been used or
consulted in the writing of this Dictionary, so that the beginner
may know to what books to turn in the prosecution of his studies.
Following the meaning of the word and at the end of the
entry is often given the equivalent of an Egyptian word in the
latest stage of the language, i.e., Coptic. In selecting these Coptic
equivalents I have not copied them straight out of a Coptic
Dictionary, but have satisfied myself that they bear the meaning
which the Egyptian words have in passages in the Coptic versions
of the Bible, and in Coptic patristic literature generally. Had
the great Corpus of Coptic words upon which Mr. W. E. Crum
has been at work for so many years been available^ the number
of Coptic equivalents quoted in this Dictionary would probably
have been quadrupled. The Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic and other
Semitic words quoted in the entries stand in a different relation
ship to the Egyptian, for they merely represent borrowings of
words, usually by the Egyptians from the Semites, whilst the
true Coptic words are native Egyptian. They seem to me to
stand in quite a different category from the pronouns which were
borrowed at a very early period by the Egyptians from the people
whom, for want of a better name, we may call " Proto-Semites."
And the greater number of them were certainly introduced into
Egyptian texts after the Egyptians founded Colonies in Syria
and Palestine by scribes who either knew no Egyptian words
that were exactly suitable for their purpose, or who wished to
ornament their compositions by the use of Semitic words or to
show their erudition.
' When the Great War broke out in 1914 Mr. Crum was in Vienna, and had his enormous mass of material with him. He succeeded in leaving the city, but his manuscripts remained there for a considerable time afterwards, and his work has been hampered in consequence, and the publication of his Coptic Dictionary
delayed for five years.



Introduction. Ivii
In the transliterations of tlie Egyptian words in this Die- Difficulties of transl tion.
tionary, I have followed the order of the letters of the Egyptian transhtera
words, but I cannot think that these transliterations always
represent the true pronunciation of the words. Thus in the word
Mam fl'^^s,"^' ^ plant, it is impossible to think that the
Egyptians took the trouble to pronounce two long vowels having
exactly the same sound and to give *^ its value, always supposing
it had a phonetic value in this word. The analogies in Coptic
suggest that we should read the word simply am, nevertheless
the scribe wrote ' ^ "^ Vv . Again in the word Nenui[t] or
Nui[t] r—^ O v> 0(1 ':^^ , the primeval watery mass, we have
n ~wwv 4- en f^~~. + n "~^~" -\- nu O, i.e., four n sounds ; that
any Egyptian ever took the trouble to pronounce all of them
in this word is inconceivable. It is possible that the scribe
wished the reader to understand that one n had to be pronounced
like the Spanish h or the Amharic "^ , and wrote n four times
to make certain that he did so. In many transliterations of
Egyptian words I have added the letter e, not because I think Addition of
it represents the vowel which the Egyptians used in these *^® letter e.
places, but merely to make the words pronounceable and therefore
easy to remember. Thus the word fi —»— d|' ^^ | V P d^' ^^
transliterated hes by me, but the Coptic equivalent &twc shows
that the vowel sound between the two consonants was not an e,
but something like an o. On the other hand in 8 S H "to
submerge," the Coptic equivalent ^^.cIe suggests that in this
word at least the vowel sound was that of some kind of a.
And in netchem ^^^' or |^v |. "sweet," "pleasant," the

supply some vowel when pronouncing these letters, either an a
or an e, probably the latter. And this was the case with
several other letters besides n and jul, for we have ^^xeTrtonrcjocgfi

rtr XJuC p ntoS.^ {ibid. 25, 19), g,n oTcupx (Acts 5, 23), nni.-r
ri zncixe (Acts 10, 3), etc. From these examples we see that lines
were written over the letters B., X, jul, n, n, p, c, x, k, v, q, cy, g,
and X, and that in certain positions in words a helping vowel was
necessary for their pronunciation.
The whole question of the use of the separate vowels which
we find in Egyptian words is one of considerable difficulty, and
it seems to me quite clear from the statements that are made
on the subject by Egyptologists that no one has yet succeeded in
solving the problem. It is quite obvious that the scribes syste
matically wrote certain words without vowels and expected the
reader to supply them, e.g., the name of the god | J| Pth.
Now, it is impossible to pronounce this name without adding one
vowel at least, but there is nothing in Egyptian to show what
that vowel must be or where it is to be placed. In the case of
Pth, the Greeks, who spelt the name ^6d, or (t>0a, supply the
vowel, and suggest that the Egyptians pronounced it something
like " Ptah." Or, take the name of the god Horus, which the
Egyptians wrote Her fX ^' ^1' ^ ^' <^5 ^"^ '=^ A
without adding any vowel. The transcriptions of the name in
Hebrew ("nn), Coptic (&u)p) and Greek Cflpo?) prove that the
missing vowel is o, but the Egyptian forms of the name give no
indication of this fact. In the Pyramid Texts we find the form
I '^ V-^ (M- 454) which was held by one Egyptologist to
prove that the god's name terminated in u ; but, according
to M. Naville's view, which is probably correct, the %:> is really
the vowel that is wanting in the name, which we ought to read
" Hur," or " Hor," as in Hebrew, Coptic and Greek. This same
scholar thinks that another example of the use of the v^ in this
way is found in "^^ tk Jj

Introduction. lix
the vowel o, and this is proved by the ^ or e in the first two
forms of quoted above. It has seemed to me for several
years past that the vowel signs which we find in many Egyptian
words were intended not to be read necessarily as parts of the
words, but only to indicate or limit their signification. But the
subject is too large to discuss in an Introduction to a Dictionary,
and demands a book to itself. Meanwhile, I understand that
M. Naville is preparing a volume on the whole question, and as
there is every reason to believe that he will present in a new light
many important facts bearing upon Egyptian phonetics, its
appearance is eagerly awaited.
The system of transliteration which I have used in this
Dictionary is a modification of that which was employed by Birch
and some of the older Egyptologists, and by Brugsch until the
last years of his life. The following is the transliteration of the
letters of the Egyptian Alphabet which Brugsch printed in the
first volume of his Wdrterbuch (1867) :

w = y (little yodh).

From these we see that Dr. Erman introduces the sign •— as
a letter of the Egyptian Alphabet, and distinguishes between the
two sibilants —»— and fl; that he gives y as an alternative
value to (|, and regards w as a "little yodh," and that he retains
I, I and ' as the transliterations of ^\ , (1 and —d respectively.
It is also to be noted that his system includes the letters \\, h, s, t,
and d, making with I and I seven new characters which must
be specially cut for the compositor's use. There are many objec
tions that might be urged against this system of transliteration, but
the innovations in it are not worth discussion. It is sufficient to
say that when the actual mistakes in the older system that was used
by Birch, Lepsius, Brugsch and others are eliminated it remains,
in my opinion, the best that has yet been proposed. The modi
fications which I have made in it for the purposes of this book
are not in any way intended to be improvements or even cor
rections ; they were made solely with the view of simplifying y,
the transliteration for the use of the beginner, and of reducing simpUfied
the labour of the compositor. I have tried to get rid of as many transhter

Maspero with infinite pains collected in his Introduction
d I' Etude de la Phonetique Bgyptienne, Paris, 1917, a number of
examples illustrating the various vowel sounds which the
Egyptians themselves gave to the signs "^j \\ and —d . And
from his conclusions it is clear that even though we transliterate
*^ by A, the A will not represent all the various modified sounds
which the human mouth can give to that letter ;i and this is also
the case with q and —0. According to him the primitive phonetic
value of the sign \\ in Pyramid times was " un A moyen " like
the French A in patte, cage, that is to say, an A, or an open A
which borders on fi as in the popular pronunciation MontpEnasse
for MontpArnasse ; "^^ A is A grave bordering on O, as in the
popular Parisian pronunciations g()r for gAre, or in the English
All, wOs for wAs- —a is A guttural which recalls the sound of
y = Q, but does not correspond to it exactly and turns sometimes
to the A aigu, and sometimes to the A grave. In fact, we see
that in archaic Egyptian " les phonemes varies de la langue
posterieure ne s'etaient pas produits encore, et qu'il n'y avait
sous chacun d'eux, ainsi que sous chacun des signes reconnus
pour consonnes par tons les savants J, a, >^^=^, ^^=^, rD. etc.,
qu'un phoneme unique, ou, si Ton veut, les groupes de nuances
vocaliques que nous avons I'habitude de designer par un signe
unique." Accepting these conclusions heartily it has seemed to
me quite unnecessary to use any other signs to represent "vi, h
and —fl than a, a and a respectively.
* " Si done nous disons que le signe A anglais figure une voyelle, il n'y a
pas de raison pour que les signes (], ^^, ° ne figurent pas des voyelles. Bien
entendu, je n'ai pas la pretention d'affirmer que, si ^_^ par exemple sonnait A, il
n'y avait sous ce signe qu'un seul des A possibles. Comme chaque modification de forme dans la bouche humaine produit une voyelle ou une nuance de voyelle differente, le nombre des voyelles et de leurs nuances est tres considerable ; aussi les signes que nous appelons signes-voyelles communement A, E, I, etc., representent en r&.litd des groupes de nuances vocaliques differant trhs legerement I'une de I'autre et Ton considdrera les signes qui rcpresentent chacun d'eux,

A^, or ^—°. or ^^—" is a matter of difficulty. That ^
was sounded in some way different from ^\ is clear, otherwise it
would appear in words more frequently. It seems possible that
the sign A d or -—o added to the v\ was intended to show that
the ^^ was to be pronounced in one of the many ways in which
m
is sounded in African languages, but what that way was is
not evident. When -%^ occurs at the end of an Egyptian trans
cription of the name of a locality in Palestine or Syria it may
represent ma. In this book I have often transcribed -^ by m'. ^^«^A^and ?V^.

And as regards '«~>~^, when the Egyptian wrote f^ the n \\as
probably pronounced like the Spanish tI or the Amharic ^ gn.
The signs ® and «»— are transcribed throughout by kh and
kha respectively. According to some authorities ® is represented ® and &.
in Coptic by & and «*-=» by i), but the Copts did not observe
this distinction carefully, for we find in Coptic texts g^Hi^i and
^HiB^i, pjexsLc and ^ejULc, g,pe and ^pe, g^oj-rS and ^ojxS, etc.
The absoluteness of the statement that «»-=» can become in Coptic is^-= and ^.
2, and ^ but never cy, but that ® can become & or cy, or ^ or cy,
has been disproved by Maspero,^ and nothing more need be said
about it here. In this Dictionary the words beginning with ®
and those beginning with ^— are separated into two distinct
groups for the convenience of the beginner, but it has been
thought unnecessary to use any specially distinctive signs for ®
and <*-=». As he will always have the Egj'ptian text before him,
he can make no mistake. The x is, of course, dropped.
In 1892, Professor Hommel pointed out in the Zeitschrift fur
Aegyptische Sprache (Bd. 30, s. 9 ff) that the Egyptians used
two sibilants which were represented bv the signs —>>— and U, The sibilants
and the fact is beyond dispute, as all will admit. But the texts " ^ '
'
prove conclusively that they ceased to distinguish between them
in writing, except in the case of a few words at an early period,
and that they used —<*— and ' indiscriminately when they wished
to express the letter s. There is no doubt that —-— must sometimes
have had a somewhat different sound froin [I for we find the

and the Hebrew word for the animal is ze^bh l^«tt. But we also
find a form beginning with the 0, thus | J "^i and, as several
variants of this form begin also with , the form that begins with
rarely —"^ is not a very sure ground for the statement that —»- = T. The
z sound must have been very rare in Egypt, for most of the words
under ^ in the Coptic Dictionaries are of Greek origin ; ^uJitx
for cojnx {see Parthey's Vocabulanum) seems to have been the
result of careless pronunciation. When the Egyptians merged the
sound of —•<— in that of 1 is not known, but the merging must
have happened long before the Christian Era began, for the Copts
represent both signs by c. And the Egyptian transcriptions of
-— and (1 Canaanite geographical names prove that both —»— and R repre
=D and ttj. sent D and uj. In their transliterations of the signs —»— and y
the German Egyptologists distinguish —»- by s and M by /, but in
this Dictionary I have followed the example of Birch and Brugsch
and Maspero, and regarded them as having practically one and the
same sound. Nevertheless, remembering the large number of
words that begin with the signs —*— and P , and with the view of
simplifying the task of the searcher who may use this Dictionary,
I have printed all the words beginning with —^ in one section,
and all those beginning with I in the section following.
By transliterating Ahy q, di letter with a diacritical point (k)
has been got rid of and, though the transliterating of ZS by g
does not seem quite satisfactory, I have followed the example
of the older Egyptologists in this particular.^ The signs c^ and
\ are both transliterated by t, and by using th for s==s the Greek
d and a letter with a line under it (/) are eliminated. In the
case of c^a I have retained the transliteration / and have not
adopted d by which it is now sometimes transliterated. Maspero
has shown that in Semitic geographical names in the XVIIIth

Egyptian an African Language Fundamentally.
During the years which I spent in collecting the materials The alleged
for this Dictionary I looked eagerly in the texts for any evidence Egvptkn to°
that would throw light on the relationship of the ancient Egyp- the Semitic
tian language to the Semitic languages and to the languages of ^§^^*^^
North Eastern Africa. Though the subject is one of considerable
importance philologically, it has- never been, in my opinion,
properly discussed, because the Semitic scholars who have written
about it have lacked the Egyptological knowledge necessary for
arriving at a decision, and the Egyptologists, with the exception
of the lamented Burchardt, have had no adequate knowledge of
Semitic languages and literature. Benfey came to the conclusion
that the ancient Egyptian language had close affinity with the Benfey's

Brugsch on the Semitic origin of the Egj^jtian language.
Stern's opinion.
Egyptians, but all the peoples of Africa/ which is obviously
absurd. Although his excursions into Coptic had disastrous
results so far as his reputation was concerned, his view that there
was a close affinity between the Egyptian and Semitic languages
found acceptance with many scholars, among them being E. de
Rouge, Ebers and Brugsch, all of whom were Egyptologists.
Birch's view was that the " greater portion of the words
[in the ancient Egyptian language] are an old form of the Coptic ;
others, no longer found in that tongue, appear (to be) of Semitic
origin, and have been gradually introduced into the language
from the Aramaic and other sources. A few words are Indo
Germanic."^ Brugsch stated categorically that the oldest form
of the ancient Egyptian language is rooted in Semitic, and he
prophesied that one day philological science would be astonished
at the closeness of the relationship which existed between Egyp
tian and the Semitic languages. He was convinced that they had
a mother in common, and that their original home was to be
sought for on the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates.^ Brugsch
held these views practically to the end of his life, for in his Die
Aegyptologie, Leipzig, 1891, p. 91, he quotes from his Worterbuch
the words which he wrote in the preface in 1867. Stern, the
eminent Coptic scholar, also declared that the Egyptian had an
affinity with the Semitic languages, which shows itself in the
pronominal formations and in the roots which are common to
all, but thought that it separated itself from its Asiatic sisters
at a very early period and developed along lines of its own.^
These views, which the older Egyptologists expressed in
general terms, were crystallized by Erman in a paper which he
contributed to the Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenldndischen
Benfey, Uber das Verhaltniss der Aegyptischen Sprache zum Semitischen Sprachstamme. Leipzig, 1844. * Bunsen, Egypt's Place, Vol. V, p. 618. ' Es steht mir namlich fest, dass die altagyptische Sprache, d. h. die alteste
Gestaltung derselben, im Semitischen wurzelt. ... Im voraus kann ich es weissagen, dass die Sprachforschung eines Tages erstaunt sein wird uber das enge Band der Verwandtschaft, welches die agyptische Sprache mit ihren semitischen Schwestem zusammenkniipft, und iiber die mir jetzt schon feststehonde Thatsache, dass alle eine gemeinsame Mutter haben, deren Ursitze an den Ufem des Euphrat und Tigris zu suchen ist." Worterbuch, Bd. I, p. ix. Es bestcht eine alte verwandtschaft zwischen der iigyptischen, welche dem hamitischen stamme angehort, und den semitischen sprachen, wie sich unverkennbar noch in der pronominalbildung und in manchen gemein?amen wurzeln zeigt ; doch scheint sich das agyptische von den asiatischen schwestem friih getrennt zu haben und seinen eigenen weg gegangen zu sein., Koptische Grammatik, p. 4.

Gesellschaft in 1892.^ In this he pointed out in a systematic
manner the details of Egyptian Grammar that have their counter
parts in the Semitic languages, and printed a List of the words
that were common to the Egyptian and Semitic languages. Most of Recent views
these words had been remarked upon by Brugsch in his Worterbuch, based on
. . Bragsch s
but Erman's List heightens their cumulative effect, and at the opinion.
first sight of it many investigators would be inclined to say
without any hesitation, " Egyptian is a Semitic language." A
very able comparative philologist of the Semitic Languages,
Carl Brockelmann, impressed by the remarks of Brugsch quoted
above and by this List, says that Egyptian must certainly be
included among the Semitic Languages, and that the more the
oldest form of it, such as that made known by the Pyramid
Texts, is investigated, the more convincingly apparent becomes
its similarity to the Semitic Languages. Like Brugsch, he thinks
that it separated itself from its sister tongues thousands of years
ago, and went its own way. According to him the Egyptian
language developed more quickly than the languages of the
other Semites, which was due partly to the mixing of the people
caused by the invasion of the Nile Valley by Semites, and the
rapidity with which the Egyptian civilization reached its zenith,
much in the same way as English has gone far away from the other
Germanic languages. '^ Wright thought that the connection
between the Semitic and the Egyptian languages was closer than
that which can be said to exist between the Semitic and the
Indo-European. But he called attention to the fact that the
majority of Egyptian roots are monosyllabic in form, and that Monosyllabic
they do not exhibit Semitic triliterality. He was prepared to Egv^p^^Em''*
admit that the " not a few structural affinities " might perhaps roots.
be thought sufficient to justify those linguists who hold that
Egyptian is a relic of the earliest age of Semitism, i.e., of Semitic

Je mehr die Forschung den altesten Formenbau des Aegyptischen, wie er in den Pyramidentexten vorliegt, erschliesst, desto iiberraschender tritt Aehnlichkeit mit dem Semitischen zu Tage. . . . Durch die Vermischung der einwandemden Semiten mit den alteren, anderssprachigen Bewohnem des Niltals und durch die friihe Bliite ihrer Kultur sei das Aegyptische viel schneller und durchgreifender fortentwickelt, als die Sprachen der anderen Semiten, ahnlich wie das Englische sich unter denselben Umstanden so wait von den anderen germanischen Sprachen entfemt hat.

language.
speech as it was before it passed into the pecuUar form in which
we may be said to know it historically.^
Now no one who has worked at Egyptian can possibly doubt
that there are many Semitic words in the language, or that many
of the pronouns, some of the numbers, and some of its gram
matical forms resemble those found in the Semitic languages.
But even admitting all the similarities that Erman has claimed,
it is still impossible to me to believe that Egyptian is a Semitic
language fundamentally. There is, it is true, much in the Pyra
Egyptian mid Texts that recalls points and details of Semitic Grammar,
an\frican^ ^ ^^^ after deducting all the triliteral roots, there still remains a
very large number of words that are not Semitic, and were never
invented by a Semitic people. These words are monosyllabic,
and were invented by one of the oldest African (or Hamitic, if
that word be preferred) peoples in the Valley of the Nile of whose
written language we have any remains. These are words used
to express fundamental relationships and feelings, and beliefs which
are peculiarly African and are foreign in every particular to
Semitic peoples. The primitive home of the people who invented
these words lay far to the south of Egypt, and all that we know
of the Predynastic Egyptians suggests that it was in the neigh
bourhood of the Great Lakes, probably to the east of them. The
whole length of the Valley of the Nile lay then, as now, open to
peoples who dwelt to the west and east of it, and there must
always have been a mingling of immigrants with its aboriginal
inhabitants. These last borrowed many words from the new
comers, especially from the " proto-Semitic " peoples from the
country now called Arabia, and from the dwellers in the lands
between the Nile and the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, but they
Borrowings continued to use their native words to express their own primitive
proto-Semitic i^*^^^, especially in respect of religious beliefs and ceremonies.

the art of writing, they were quick to perceive the advantage of
adding to their pictures signs that would help the eye of the

and at a much later period many of the Semitic words that were
current at the time in Syria and Palestine. And it has always
seemed to me that some of the aboriginal words of the primitive
Egyptians found their way into neighbouring countries, where they
still live. Thus the common Egyptian word khefti ^^-z:^,
" enemy," which has its equivalent in the Coptic shaft cy^qT,
is also found in Amharic under the form sJiaftd hQ.:^: • The Survivals in

As none of the literature of the peoples who lived on each
side of the Valley of the Nile has been preserved, we have no means
of finding out how much they borrowed linguistically from the
Egyptians or the Egyptians from them, but I believe the Egyptians
were as much indebted to them as to the Semites. I do not for Value of

comparatively small amount of attention which I have been able
to devote to the grammars and vocabularies of some of the

that they contain much that is useful for the study of the lan
guage of the hieroglyphs. The ancient Egyptians were Africans,
and they spoke an African language, and the modern peoples of
the Eastern Sudan are Africans, and they speak African lan

The Introduction.
Lists of Hieroglyphic signs by ChampoUion, Birch, E. de
Roug6 and Brugsch.
The Introduction, Indexes, Semitic Alphabets, etc.
In the introductory section of this book I have given a list
of the commonest Egyptian signs, with their values as phonetics
and determinatives, arranged practically according to the Lists
of Egyptian Hieroglyphic Signs published by the eminent printing
firms of Theinhardt in Berlin,^ Holzhausen in Vienna,' and
Harrison & Sons in London.^ Certainly none of these lists is
absolutely correct since the classification of several of the signs
is the result of guesswork, for the simple reason that Egyptolo
gists do not know what objects certain signs are intended to
represent. The only native Egyptian List of Hieroglyphs known
was published by Griffith, Two Hieroglyphic Papyri from Tunis,
London, 1889, 4to, but this does not help us much in the identi
fication of the hieroglyphs. The first printed List of Hieroglyphs
was published by ChampoUion in his Grammairc £gyptienne,
Paris, 1836, and contains 260 hieroglyphs. In 1848 Birch pub
lished a fuller List with detailed descriptions (see above p. xxxiii)
in the first volume of the German and English editions of Bunsen's
" Aegyptens Stelle." This he revised and enlarged, and re
published in 1867, in the second edition of the first volume
of the English edition, pp. 505-559. It contained 890 hiero
glyphs and 201 determinatives were grouped separately. In 1851
E. de'Kouge issued a List of hieroglyphs in his Catalogue des signes
hieroglyphiques de I'lmprimerie Nationale, Paris, 1851, and he
reprinted it with explanations and descriptions in the first part

of his Chrestomathie iJgyptienne, Paris, 1867. This contained
about 340 hieroglyphs. A much fuller and more accurate List
was published by Brugsch, Index des Hieroglyphes Phonetiques y
compris des valeurs de I'Ecriture Secrete, Leipzig, 1872, and it
contained 600 signs and their phonetic values, accompanied by
references to pages" of his Worterbuch, and 147 determinatives.
After the Lists given by Rossi in his Coptic Hieroglyphic Gram
mar^ and by von Lemm^ in his Egyptian Reading Book, no further
attempt was made to discuss hieroglyphs generally until Griffith ^^^ selected
described 104 Egyptian characters in Beni Hasan III, London, von Lemm,
1896. Two years later he published A Collection of Hieroglyphs, Griffith and
London, 1898, which contained descriptions and identifications of
192 hieroglyphs illustrated by really good coloured pictures of the
objects which they represented, copied chiefly from coffins and
tombs of the Xllth dynasty. The most recently published List
of Hieroglyphs is that given by Erman in the third edition of
his Aegyptische Grammatik, Berlin, 191 1. It contains about 660
hieroglyphs, not reckoning variants, selected from Theinhardt's
List. In the List of Hieroglyphs given in the present work I have
followed their order in the List of Messrs. Harrison & Sons, but
have been obliged to alter the numbers of the characters. I
have given all the ordinary phonetic values which the signs have
when forming parts of words generally, but have made no attempt
to give the word-values when they are used as ideographs. The
values which many of the signs had when used in the so-called
" enigmatic writing," and in the inscriptions of the Ptolemaic
Period are not given. Want of space made it impossible to
include in this Introduction a list of the hieratic forms of hiero- Lists of
glyphs ; for these the beginner is referred to Pleyte's Catalogue hieratic signs.

and study them, if only from the point of view of the bibliographer.
The indexes to the Coptic and to the non-Egyptian words
and geographical names which are at the end of the book will show
that a considerable number of Coptic, Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic,
Ethiopic, Amharic, Assyrian and Persian words and names are
quoted in this Dictionary. The beginner who wishes to examine
these words will need to learn the alphabets of the principal
Semitic languages, and as I know of no Egyptological work in
which they are to be found, I have included them in this Intro

Apologia and Thanks.
In the preparation of the manuscript of this Dictionary
for the printer I have not spared labour, or trouble, or time or
attention, and I have made every effort during the proof reading
to reduce misprints to a minimum. I have copied too many
texts in the course of my life not to know how easy it is for the
attention to be distracted, and the eye to be deceived, and the
hand to write something which it ought not to write when doing
work of this kind. The professional copyists of the Book of
the Dead, and the monastic scribes who laboriously transcribed
Coptic, Syriac, Arabic and Ethiopic texts in Egypt, Ethiopia
and Syria, made many mistakes, mis-spelt the words of the arche
types in their copies, omitted whole lines, and made nonsense
of many passages by omitting parts of words and mixing together
the remaining parts. It seems to me obvious from these facts
that every one who undertakes a long and very tedious work
like the making of an Egyptian Dictionary, must be guilty of
the perpetration of mistakes, blunders, and errors in his copying,
however careful he may be. In my work there will be found incon
sistencies, misunderstandings, and misprints, and probably down
right misstatements, and as Maspero said in his edition of the
Pyramid Texts, " je le regrette sans m'en etonner. . . . C'est
une infirmity de la nature humaine dont on finit par prendre son
parti, comme de bien d'autres." Notwithstanding such defects
I hope and believe that this Dictionary will be useful to the

beginner, and will save him time and trouble and give him help,
and if my hope and belief be realized, the purpose of my friend
who made the printing of the book possible will be effected, and
my own time and labour will not have been wasted. Many,
many years must pass before the perfect Egyptian Hieroglyphic
Dictionary can, or will, be written, and meanwhile the present
work may serve as a stop-gap.
It is now my pleasant duty to put on record my thanks and
gratitude to those who have enabled me to produce this book. Thanks to

to defray the entire cost of its production. In spite of my possible,
entreaties he persists in remaining anonymous, and wishes to be
known only as an English gentleman who is interested in every
thing that concerns the history, religion, language and literature
of ancient Egypt, and in the language and literature of the Copts,
that is to say, of the Egyptians who embraced Christianity. He
is also deeply interested in the exploration of Western Asia,
and has liberally supported all the endeavours made by the
English to excavate the sites of the ancient cities mentioned in
the Bible. Owing to the great advance in the price of materials,
and the various rises in wages in the printing trades that have
taken place during the War, twice or thrice I was on the verge
of being obliged to stop the printing of this book, but my friend
decided that the work should go on, and that the original plan
as approved by him should be neither altered nor curtailed, and Great rise in
he furnished the means for continuing the work. What this wages and
cost of
means will be evident from the fact that since we began to print production
in July, 1916, the cost per sheet has increased by not less than o^.this
125 per cent. ! In addition to this generous act I am indebted
to my anonymous friend for ready help and sympathy during
the last forty years.
I owe my wife many thanks for constant help in the sorting
and incorporation of slips, and for assistance in the reading of
proofs. She has also read for and with me the proofs and revises

and privately, to forward my work. During the War, when the
resources of the Firm were strained to their utmost to carry out
the urgent work which was thrust upon them by the Govern
ment, and when every available hand was pressed into this service,
he somehow managed to keep going the composition of this book,
and found means of machining each sheet when ready for press.
Besides this, he had many hundreds of new characters cut, and
spared no trouble in reproducing my manuscript, and when
ever necessary he cast great quantities of new type to enable
the composing to continue, and so avoided delay during the
distribution of the type of worked-off sheets. At the present
time his fount of Egyptian type is the largest and most compre
hensive and complete in the world. At my request he has pre
pared a list of his Egyptian Hieroglyphic types which will be
found at the end of the volume. On the Continent great printing
firms like Harrison & Sons, who enlarge and complete their founts
of Oriental types, receive subsidies from Governments, or from
Academies, but in England no subsidies or contributions are
given to printers, and the satisfaction which they feel when they
have done a public-spirited act of this kind is their sole reward.
That Messrs. Longman cast at their own expense the fount of
solid Egyptian type that was used for printing Birch's " List
of Hieroglyphics," and his " Dictionary of Hieroglyphics," and
that Messrs. Harrisons have cut, at their own expense, the very
extensive and complete fount of linear hieroglyphic types used
in the printing of the present work, will ever redound to the credit
of the great company of English publishers and master-printers.

Finally, I mention with gratitude the help which I have
received from Mr. A. E. Fish, the able compositor in the employ
of Messrs. Harrisons who set the type of this Dictionary. He has
shown great zeal and interest in the work, and his skill and great
experience have triumphed over many difficulties, and made
the proof reading easier. He is a worthy successor of Mr. Mabey,
Messrs. Harrisons' great Oriental Compositor, who set the type
for George Smith's monumental work The History of Assur
banipal, London, 1871, and of Mr. Fisher who set the type for
my text volume of the Book of the Dead, London, 1894, published
by the Trustees of the British Museum.

He and his wife Isis and his brother and sister Set and Nephthys, and his son Horus, were brought forth by Nut at the same time. He was drowned in the Nile by Set and suffered mutilation, but he rose from the dead, and having been declared by the gods innocent of the charges brought against him by Set, became King of the Dead and giver of immortality to all who believed in him.
