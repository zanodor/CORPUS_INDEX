वाचस्पत्यम् pāṭha equals dhātu-pāṭha-; a particular method of reciting the text of the veda- (of which there are 5,viz.saṃhitā-, pada-, krama-, jaṭā- and ghana-)
anvaya the natural order or connection of words in a sentence, syntax, construing
padapāṭha, anvaya are two preliminary steps in analysing a R̥ ca which is rendered in chandas, metrical invocation of prayers.

सायण explains the use of the key expression रत्नऽधातमम् in RV 1.1 in the context of wealth creation: रत्नाग्न दधातीग्त ग्वग्र िः । समासिादन्तोदात्तो रत्नधाशब्दिः ।
This explanation is consistent with a hieroglyph on Shalamaneser III Black Obelisk. The hieroglyph is a monkey dressed as a woman and offered as a tribute to Shalamaneser III by Musri people (Kurds in northern Iraq). This is an Indus Script hieroglyph read rebus in Meluhha:
रत्नी ratnī 'monkey dressed as a woman' Rebus: ratnin 'treasure, gems, jewels'. Hence, the monkey dressed as a woman (cipher text) read ratnI is similar sounding with ratnin (plain text) which makes the gems and jewels a tribute to the King Shalamaneser from Musri śã̄ gal, śã̄ gaḍ ʻchainʼ (WPah.) Rebus: sanghāṭa ‘accumulation,
collection’ संगर sangar 'trade sã̄ go ʻcaravanʼ. Thus, the meaningof the hieroglyph-hypertext is a trade caravan with collection of gems, jewels.
Kalibangan-79 tablet
This tablet inscription is a good example of padapāṭha, anvaya type compositions to create a syntax of a sentence. On Sign 418 shown on one side of the tablet, at least five hieroglyphs are catalogued together. On the obverse of the tablet is an X hieroglyph with a crossed horizontal line.
padapāṭha (hieroglyphs on the Kalibangan 79 inscription), Anvaya and meaning are detailed below:

At first glance, the pictograph on the left may seem like a simple person carrying water with a rake in their hands. However, there is more information that can be found in this symbol. If you break down the symbol into the different parts listed below, you can tell that in reality it is a catalogue of metalwork. This could point to his occupation and his purpose as an accountant and trader of different alloys. This type of depiction can be seen in almost all 8000 inscriptions of Indus Script. It is founded in "rebus", which means similar sounding words or homophones, indicated by each of the symbols. To understand the homophones, one must have a good understanding of the vocabulary at the time to see what is truly being communicated. The composition is similar to modern day Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), due to the communication of a large amount of information in a compact form.
The catalogue explains smelting, creating alloys, documenting the metals, constructing metal equipment, and making ingots of iron ore, as detailed by the individual parts of the complex pictograph.

dāṭu 'cross' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore' gaṇḍa 'four' rebus khaṇḍa 'equipment'
maĩd ʻrude harrow or clod breakerʼ (Marathi) rebus: mẽṛhẽt,med 'iron' (Mu.Ho.) med 'copper' (Slavic) Duplicated Sign 171 adds: dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting'. Thus duplicated Sign 171 reads rebus: iron, copper metal castings.
Pictograph on the right is an X with attached ingots
This is also a composition of the X with ingots. The X means a cross with the four ingots which are made of mineral ores. This is based on our understanding of /dhatu/ 'mineral ore' which sounds similar to /dāṭu/ 'cross'. The bar in the middle with the two ingots is a pictorial representation of the processes to create metal products. The first is metal moulding where you pour molten metal into stone bowls to create ingots. The second is Cire Perdue method of lost wax casting, where an artisan pours molten metal into a layer of wax that ultimately melts away leaving behind the metal image of the structure, called metal castings. This is another example of a HTTP like composition.
X dāṭu 'cross' rebus: dhatu 'mineral ore' gaṇḍa 'four' rebus 'khaṇḍa 'equipment' gaṇḍa 'four' rebus 'khaṇḍa 'equipment' PLUS dula 'two' rebus: dul 'metal casting'. Thus, with the six Signs 372 of bun ingot type ligatures, the message is that 1) ore ingots for equipment and 2) ore metalcastings are signified. Sign 342 is the key hieroglyph which provides the syntax in context.

Indus Script solves the mysteries of stupa, circular platforms, archaeology identifies in Mohenjo-daro karaṇaśāle 'office of writers'
https://tinyurl.com/s6qq46m
-- karaṇaśāle is a plaintext which signifies 'office of writers'. This expression is signified by the hieroglyphs/hypertexts Signs 343, 344
Sign 343 kanda kanka 'rim of jar' काग्णिक 'relating to the ear' rebus: kanda kanka 'fire-trench account, karṇika 'scribe, account' karṇī 'supercargo' karaṇa 'scribe' ligatured with: 1. single stroke: खांडा [khāṇḍā] m a jag, notch, or indentation (as upon the edge of a tool' rebus khaṇḍā

'equipment'; 2. splinter, two strokes: sal 'splinter' rebus: sal 'workshop'. Sign 343 may be a variant of Sign 344. Thus, Sign 343 signifies karaṇaśāle 'office of scribes'. A large building of Mohenjo-daro and a two-storeyed building in HR Area A1 may signify such karaṇaśāle 'office of scribes'.
Based on these deciphered Rebus Meluhha readings, the anvaya and meaning of the Kalibangan 79 inscription can be summarised: Cargo of shipment catalogued: 1) ore ingots for equipment and 2) ore metalcastings;alloy metal'smelter furnace;iron, copper metal castings;mineral ore khaṇḍa 'equipment'; metalware cargo accounted for shipment by कग्णिक 'accountant scribe'.
Mohenjodaro m1177 seal inscription
m1177 Mohenjo-daro seal. The horns of the composite animal combine two hieroglyph elementss: 1.Spiny horn signifying the single horn of a 'young bull also called unicorn'; and 2.Raised, curved horns signifying a zebu. Other hieroglyphs are: scarves on the neck; trunk of an elephant; tail shaped like an upraised cobra hood.The body is that of a bovine (perhaps, young bull). The hind leg of the compiosition is clearly marked to highlight the thigh and hind legs and paws of a feline.
Mohenjodaro m1177 inscription has also been deciphered to summarise the anvaya and meaning of the hieroglyph compositions. The key expression is the joining together of parts of hieroglyphs and parts of animals to create a hypetext. This expression is: --sāṅgaḍa सांगड 'joining parts together' rebus sãgaḍ 'catamaran' saṁgah 'collection' of metalwork
--sã

gāḍā m. ʻ frame of a building ʼ (M.)(CDIAL 12859) سنګر sangar, s.m.

There is a remarkable statement in Tolkappiyam an ancient text of Sangam period:
ப ொய் யும் வழுவும் த ொன் றியபின் னர் அய் யர் யொ ் னர் கரணம் என் (ப ொல் கொ ்பியம் ப ொருள் அதிகொரம் )
When falsehood and deception came into vogue, the Brahmin scholars codified the accounting system.
