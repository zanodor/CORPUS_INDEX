Orion Constellation
Orion constellation is one of the brightest and best known
constellations in the night sky. It lies on the celestial equator.
Orion has been known since ancient times. The constellation is also
known as the Hunter, as it is associated with one in Greek mythology.
It represents the mythical hunter Orion, who is often depicted in star
maps as either facing the charge of Taurus, the bull, pursuing the
Pleiades sisters, represented by the famous open cluster, or chasing
after the hare (constellation Lepus) with his two hunting dogs,
represented by the nearby constellations Canis Major and Canis
Minor.
The constellation Orion contains two of the ten brightest stars in the
sky – Rigel (Beta Orionis) and Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis) – a number
of famous nebulae – the Orion Nebula (Messier 42), De Mairanʼs
Nebula (Messier 43) and the Horsehead Nebula, among others – the
well-known Trapezium Cluster, and one of the most prominent
asterisms in the night sky – Orionʼs Belt.
FACTS, LOCATION & MAP
Orion is the 26th constellation in size, occupying an area of 594
square degrees. It is located in the first quadrant of the northern
hemisphere (NQ1) and can be seen at latitudes between +85° and
-75°. The neighboring constellations are Eridanus, Gemini, Lepus,
Monoceros and Taurus.
Orion belongs to the Orion family of constellations, along with Canis
Major, Canis Minor, Lepus and Monoceros. The constellation
contains three Messier objects – Messier 42 (M42, NGC 1976, Orion
Nebula), Messier 43 (M43, NGC 1982, De Mairanʼs Nebula), and



Messier 78 (M78, NGC 2068) – and has seven stars with known
planets.
The brightest star in the constellation is Rigel, Beta Orionis, with an
apparent magnitude of 0.18. Rigel is also the sixth brightest star in
the sky. The second brightest star in Orion, Betelgeuse, Alpha
Orionis, has an apparent magnitude of 0.43 and is the eighth
brightest star in the night sky. There are two meteor showers
associated with Orion, the Orionids and the Chi Orionids. The Orionid
meteor shower reaches its peak around October 21 every year.

MYTH
In Greek mythology, the hunter Orion was the most handsome of
men. He was the son of the sea god Poseidon and Euryale, the
daughter of King Minos of Crete. In Homerʼs Odyssey, Orion is
described as exceptionally tall and armed with an unbreakable
bronze club.



In one myth, Orion fell in love with the Pleiades, the seven sisters,
daughters of Atlas and Pleione. He started pursuing them and Zeus
scooped them up and placed them in the sky. The Pleiades are
represented by the famous star cluster of the same name, located in
the constellation Taurus. Orion can still be seen chasing the sisters
across the sky at night.
In another story, Orion fell in love with Merope, the beautiful
daughter of King Oenopion, who didnʼt return his affections.
One night, he had too much to drink and tried to force himself on
her. The king, enraged, put out Orionʼs eyes and banished him from
his land, the island of Chios. Hephaestus felt sorry for the blind,
wandering Orion and offered one of his assistants to guide the
hunter and act as his eyes. Orion eventually encountered an oracle
that told him if he went east toward the sunrise, his sight would be
restored. Orion did so and his eyes were miraculously healed.
The constellation Orion has its origins in Sumerian mythology,
specifically in the myth of Gilgamesh. Sumerians associated it with
the story of their hero fighting the bull of heaven, represented by
Taurus. They called Orion URU AN-NA, which means “the light of
heaven.” Their name for the constellation Taurus was GUD AN-NA,
or “the bull of heaven.”
Orion is often shown as facing the attack of a bull, yet there are no
myths in Greek mythology telling any such tale. When describing the
constellation, the Greek astronomer Ptolemy describes the hero with
a club and lionʼs pelt, both of which are usually associated with
Heracles, but there is no evidence in mythology books of a direct
relation between the constellation and Heracles. However, since
Heracles, the most famous of Greek heroes, is represented by the
much less conspicuous constellation Hercules, and since one of his



tasks was to catch the Cretan bull, there are at least hints of a
possible connection between the two.
Most myths about Orionʼs death involve a scorpion, but the stories
differ from one mythographer to another. In one tale, Orion boasted
to the goddess Artemis and her mother Leto that he could kill any
beast on earth. The Earth Goddess heard him and sent a scorpion,
which stung the giant to death. In another story, he tried to force
himself on Artemis and she was the one who sent the scorpion. In
yet another account of his death, Orion was stung while trying to
save Leto from the scorpion. All myths of Orionʼs death share the
same outcome: Orion and the scorpion were placed on opposite
sides of the sky, so that when the constellation Scorpius rises in the
sky, Orion sets below the horizon in the west, fleeing from the
scorpion.
However, there is also a myth that does not involve a scorpion:
Artemis, the goddess of hunting, fell in love with the hunter and, to
stop her from giving up her vows of chastity, her brother Apollo
dared her to hit a small target in the distance with her bow and
arrow. Not knowing that the target was Orion, who was enjoying a
swim, she hit it in a single shot, killing her would-be lover.
Devastated by his death, she placed Orion among the stars.
Orion is a well-known constellation in many cultures. In Australia, the
stars forming Orionʼs Belt and sword are sometimes called the Pot or
the Saucepan. In South Africa, the three stars of Orionʼs Belt are
known as Drie Konings (the three kings) or Drie Susters (the three
sisters). In Spain and Latin America, the stars are called Las Tres
Marías, or The Three Marys.



Babylonians knew Orion as MUL.SIPA.ZI.AN.NA or The Heavenly
Shepherd (The True Shepherd of Anu) in the Late Bronze Age and
associated the constellation with Anu, the god of the heavenly
realms. Egyptians associated it with Osiris, the god of death, afterlife
and rebirth. Orion was also identified with Unas, the last Pharaoh of
the Fifth Dynasty, who was said to have eaten the flesh of his
enemies and devoured the gods themselves to become great and
bring inheritance of his power. According to myth, Unas travels
through the sky to become the star Sabu, or Orion.
Because pharaohs were believed to be transformed into Osiris after
death, some of the greatest pyramids – the ones at Giza – were built
to mirror the pattern of the stars in the constellation. To make the
transformation easier, the air shaft in the Kingʼs Chamber in the
Great Pyramid was aligned with the star Alnitak, Zeta Orionis, the
easternmost star in Orionʼs Belt.
The Aztecs called the stars of Orionʼs Belt and sword the Fire Drill;
their rising in the sky signalled the beginning of the New Fire
ceremony, a ritual Aztecs performed to postpone the end of the
world.
In Hungarian mythology, Orion is identified with Nimrod, a famous
hunter and father of Hunor and Magor, the two twins also known as
Hun ad Hungarian. In Scandinavian tradition, the constellation is
associated with the goddess Freya and called Friggʼs Distaff
(Friggerock), after the tool she used for spinning. The Chinese knew
the constellation as Shen, a great hunter or warrior.
Another ancient legend dates back to the second millennium BC.
The Hittites (a Bronze Age people of Anatolia, the region comprising
most of present-day Turkey) associated the constellation with Aqhat,
a famous mythical hunter. The war goddess Anat fell in love with him,



but after he refused to lend her his bow, she tried to steal it.
However, the man she sent to get the bow messed up the
assignment pretty badly, killing Aqhat and dropping the bow into the
sea. This is why, according to the myth, the constellation drops
below the horizon for two months in the spring.
MAJOR STARS IN ORION
Rigel – β Orionis (Beta Orionis, 19 Orionis)
Rigel is the brightest star in the constellation. With an apparent
magnitude of 0.18, it is also the sixth brightest star in the sky. Even
though it does not have the designation alpha, it is almost always
brighter than Betelgeuse, Alpha Orionis. Rigel is really a star system
composed of three stars. It has been a known visual binary since
1831, possibly even earlier, when F. G. Struve first measured it. Rigel
is surrounded by a shell of expelled gas.
The name Rigel comes from the Arabic phrase Riǧl Ǧawza al-Yusra,
which means “the left foot of the central one.” Rigel marks Orionʼs
left foot. Another Arabic name for the constellation is iǧl al-ǧabbār,
or “the foot of the great one.” The starʼs other two variant names,
Algebar and Elgebar, are derived from this phrase.
Rigel is a blue supergiant. It belongs to the spectral type B8lab and is
772.51 light years distant. It has 85,000 times the luminosity of the
Sun and 17 solar masses. It is classified as a slightly irregular variable
star, with its luminosity varying from 0.03 to 0.3 magnitudes over 22
– 25 days.
The primary component in the system, Rigel A, is 500 times brighter
than Rigel B, which is itself a spectroscopic binary star. Rigel B has a
magnitude of 6.7. It consists of a pair of B9V class main sequence
stars that orbit a common centre of gravity every 9.8 days.

Rigel, Beta Orionis, is associated with several nearby dust clouds
which it illuminates. The most famous one is IC 2118, also known as
the Witch Head Nebula, a faint reflection nebula located about 2.5
degrees to the northwest of Rigel, in the constellation Eridanus.
Rigel is a member of the Taurus
Orion R1 Association. It was
considered by some to be an
outlying member of the Orion OB1
Association, a group of several
dozen hot giants belonging to the
spectral types O and B, located in
the Orion Molecular Cloud
Complex. However, the star is too
close to us to be a real member of
that particular stellar association.
Rigel is only about 10 million years
old. Eventually, it will grow into a
red supergiant, one very similar to
Betelgeuse.
Betelgeuse – α Orionis (Alpha Orionis, 58 Orionis)
Betelgeuse is the second brightest star in Orion and the eighth
brightest star in the sky. It is a red supergiant, belonging to the
spectral class M2lab. The suffix -ab indicates that Betelgeuse is
classified as an intermediate luminous supergiant, one not as bright
as others such as Deneb in the constellation Cygnus. Some recent
findings, however, suggest that the star emits more light than
100,000 Suns, which would in fact make it more luminous than most
stars in its class, so the classification is likely outdated.
The star has an apparent magnitude of 0.42 and is approximately



Betelgeuse
643 light years distant. Betelgeuse is one of the most luminous stars
known. It has an absolute magnitude of -6.05.
Betelgeuse, or Alpha Orionis, is also one of the largest stars known,
with an apparent diameter between 0.043 and 0.056 arc seconds. It
is difficult to get an accurate measurement because the star appears
to change shape from time to time and, as a result of a huge mass
loss, it has a large envelope surrounding it.
Alpha Orionis is classified as a semi
regular variable star. Its apparent
magnitude varies from 0.2 to 1.2,
which means that Betelgeuse
occasionally outshines its bright
neighbour Rigel. This, however, only
happens very rarely. The starʼs
variation in brightness was first noted
by Sir John Herschel in his Outlines
of Astronomy in 1836.
Betelgeuse is believed to be about 10
million years old, which is not much
for a red supergiant, but the star is thought to have evolved very
rapidly because of its enormous mass. It will likely explode as a
supernova in the next million years. When it does, it will be easy to
find in the sky, not just at night, but also in broad daylight. At its
current distance from the solar system, the supernova would shine
brighter than the Moon and be the brightest ever recorded
supernova in history.
The origin of the name Betelgeuse is not entirely certain. The last
part, -elgeuse, is derived from the Arabic name for the constellation,
al-Jauzāʼ, which was a feminine name from old Arabian legends and



The Winter Triangle and Hexagon
can be roughly translated as “the middle one.” The most widely
accepted explanation is that the name is a corruption of the Arabic
phrase Yad al-Jauzāʼ , or the Hand of al-Jauzāʼ, which is to say, the
hand of Orion, which became Betelegeuse through a
mistransliteration into medieval Latin, with the first Arabic letter
standing for y being mistaken for the one for b, which led to the
name Bait al-Jauzāʼ, or “the house of Orion” during the Renaissance.
This eventually led to the starʼs modern name, Betelgeuse.
Betelgeuse is part of two prominent
winter asterisms: the Winter Triangle and
the Winter Hexagon.
The other two stars forming the Winter
Triangle, also known as the Great
Southern Triangle, are Sirius and
Procyon, the brightest stars in the
constellations Canis Major and Canis
Minor respectively.
The same stars are also part of the
Winter Hexagon, along with Rigel,
Aldebaran in the constellation Taurus,
Capella in Auriga, and Pollux and Castor in Gemini.
Bellatrix – γ Orionis (Gamma Orionis, 24 Orionis)
Bellatrix, sometimes also known as the Amazon Star, is the third
brightest star in Orion and the 27th brightest star in the sky, only
slightly dimmer than Castor in Gemini. Its name comes from the Latin
word for “the female warrior.” It has a mean apparent magnitude of
1.64 and is approximately 240 light years distant.
Bellatrix is a hot, luminous blue-white giant star, classified as an



Orionʼs Belt: Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka, are the bright bluish stars from east to west (left to right) along the diagonal in this gorgeous cosmic vista. Otherwise known as the Belt of Orion, these three blue supergiant stars are hotter and much more massive than the Sun. They lie about 1,500 light-years away. Photo: Astrowicht
eruptive variable. Its magnitude varies between 1.59 and 1.64. The
star belongs to the spectral class B2 III. It is one of the hotter stars
visible to the naked eye. It emits about 6,400 times more light than
the Sun and has eight or nine solar masses. Within a few million
years, Bellatrix will become an orange giant and eventually a massive
white dwarf.
Before its own variability was confirmed, Gamma Orionis was used
as a standard for stellar luminosity, one against which other stars
were compared and checked for variability.
ORIONʼS BELT – Mintaka, Alnilam and Alnitak (Delta, Epsilon and
Zeta Orionis)
Orionʼs Belt is one of the best
known asterisms in the night
sky. It is formed by three
bright stars in the
constellation Orion: Mintaka
(Delta Orionis), Alnilam
(Epsilon Orionis), and Alnitak
(Zeta Orionis).
Mintaka – δ Orionis (Delta
Orionis, 34 Orionis)
Mintaka, Delta Orionis, is the
westernmost of the three
stars in the Belt of Orion. It is
the right-most star when observed from the Northern Hemisphere,
facing south. The name Mintaka is derived from the Arabic word
manţaqah, which means “area” or “region.”
Mintaka is a multiple star, classified as an eclipsing binary variable.



The primary component is a double star consisting of a class B giant
and a hot class O star which orbit each other every 5.63 days and
eclipse each other slightly, causing a 0.2 magnitude drop in
luminosity. The system also contains a magnitude 7 star separated
by about 52” from the primary component, and a very faint 14th
magnitude star in between.
Mintaka is approximately 900 light years distant. Its brightest
components are both roughly 90,000 times as luminous as our Sun
and have more than 20 solar masses. They will both end their lives in
violent supernova explosions.
In the order of brightness, the apparent magnitudes of the
components are 2.23 (3.2/3.3), 6.85, 14.0. Mintaka is the faintest of
the three stars in Orionʼs Belt and the seventh brightest star in Orion.
It is the closest bright star to the celestial equator: it rises and sets
almost exactly east and west.
Alnilam – ε Orionis (Epsilon Orionis, 46 Orionis)
Alnilam, Epsilon Orionis, is a hot, bright blue supergiant. It has an
apparent magnitude of 1.70 and is approximately 1,300 light years
distant. It belongs to the spectral class B0.
Alnilam is the central star in Orionʼs Belt. It is the fourth brightest star
in the Orion constellation and the 30th brightest star in the night sky.
It radiates about 375,000 solar luminosities. The starʼs Flamsteed
designation is 46 Orionis.
Alnilam is surrounded by the reflection nebula NGC 1990, a
molecular cloud illuminated by the light emitted by the star. The wind
blowing from the starʼs surface has the speed of 2,000 kilometres
per second. The starʼs estimated age is around four million years. It
is losing mass and its internal hydrogen fusion is shutting down.

Alnilam will soon evolve into a
red supergiant, one much
brighter than Betelgeuse, and
eventually explode as a
supernova.
The name Alnilam comes
from the Arabic word an
niżām, which is related to the
word nażm, which means
“the string of pearls.”
Alnitak – ζ Orionis (Zeta
Orionis, 50 Orionis)
Alnitak, Zeta Orionis, is a
multiple star system in Orion,
approximately 700 light years
distant. It has an apparent
magnitude of 1.72. The name
Alnitak is derived from the
Arabic word an-nitaq, which
means “the girdle.”
The brightest component in
the system, Alnitak A, is yet
another hot, blue supergiant,
one with an absolute magnitude of -5.25.
The star has a visual magnitude of 2.04 and belongs to the spectral
class O9. It is the brightest O class star known.
It is in fact a close binary star, composed of the O9.7 class
supergiant, one with a mass 28 times solar, and a blue dwarf

belonging to the spectral class OV, with an apparent magnitude of
about 4. The dwarf was first discovered in 1998.
Alnitak is the easternmost
star in Orionʼs Belt. The
system lies next to the bright
emission nebula IC 434.
The nebula was first
discovered by William
Herschel on February 1, 1786.
Saiph – κ Orionis (Kappa
Orionis, 53 Orionis)
Kappa Orionis, or Saiph, is the
southeastern star of Orionʼs central quadrangle. It is the sixth
brightest star in the constellation, with an apparent magnitude of
2.06. The star is approximately 720 light years distant.
Saiph is a blue supergiant, belonging to the spectral class B0.5. Its
name is derived from the Arabic phrase saif al jabbar, which means
“the sword of the giant.” Like many other bright stars in Orion, Saiph
too will end its life in a supernova explosion.
Hatsya – ι Orionis (Iota Orionis)
Hatsya, or Iota Orionis, is a quadruple star system in the constellation
Orion. It is the brightest star in Orionʼs sword and marks the swordʼs
tip. The star has the traditional names Hatsya and the Arabic Naʼir al
Saif, which is translated as “the bright one of the sword.”
The primary component in the Iota Orionis system is a massive
spectroscopic binary star that has an eccentric 29-day orbit. The



system is composed of a blue giant belonging to the spectral class
O9 III and a class B1 III star. The binary is a strong X-ray source as a
result of the collision of the stellar winds coming from the pair.
Iota Orionis has an apparent magnitude of 2.77 and is approximately
1,300 light years distant from the solar system.
Meissa – λ Orionis (Lambda Orionis)
Lambda Orionis is blue giant belonging to the spectral type O8III,
approximately 1,100 light years distant. It has a visual magnitude of
3.39. The starʼs traditional name, Meissa, comes from the Arabic Al
Maisan, which means the shining one. Lambda Orionis is also
sometimes called Heka, from the Arabic Al Hakah, or a white spot,
referring to the Arabic lunar mansion that includes both Lambda and
Phi Orionis.
Meissa is really a double star. The companion, a hot blue-white
dwarf belonging to the spectral class B0.5V, has an apparent
magnitude of 5.61 and is separated from the brighter component by
4.4 arc seconds.
φ Orionis (Phi Orionis)
Phi Orionis refers to two star systems in Orion, Phi-1 Orionis and Phi
2 Orionis, separated by 0.71° degrees. Phi-1 Orionis is a double star
approximately 1,000 light years distant. The main component is a
main sequence star belonging to the spectral type B0, with an
apparent magnitude of 4.39.
Phi-2 Orionis is a K0 class giant approximately 115 light years distant.
It has an apparent magnitude of 4.09.
π Orionis (Pi Orionis)



Pi Orionis is a relatively loose group of stars that constitute Orionʼs
shield. Unlike most binary and multiple stars that share the same
Bayer designation, the stars in the Pi Orionis system are fairly wide
apart. Pi-1 Orionis and Pi-6 Orionis are separated by almost nine
degrees.
Pi-1 Orionis (7 Orionis) is the faintest star in the system. It is a white
main sequence dwarf with an apparent magnitude of 4.60,
approximately 120 light years distant. The star belongs to the
spectral type A0.
Pi-2 Orionis (2 Orionis) is also a main sequence dwarf, belonging to
the spectral class A1Vn. It is located 194 light years from Earth and
has a visual magnitude of 4.35.
Pi-3 Orionis (1 Orionis), also known as Tabit, is the brightest of the
six stars. It is a white dwarf belonging to the spectral class F6V, only
26.32 light years distant from Earth. The star is very similar to the
Sun, with 1.2 solar masses, 1.3 times the solar radius, and three
times the Sunʼs luminosity. For this reason, Pi-3 Orionis is considered
a possible location for Earth-size planets. The starʼs traditional
name, Tabit, comes from the Arabic Al-Tabit, which means “the
endurer.”
Pi-4 Orionis (3 Orionis) has an apparent magnitude of 3.69 and is
1,250 light years distant. It is one of the most luminous stars known.
It is really a spectroscopic binary star, composed of two hot class B2
stars, a giant and a subgiant. They make a very close pair and cannot
be resolved, even through a telescope. Only their spectra give away
the fact that they are two stars, not one. The stars orbit each other
with a period of 9.5191 days. Both of them have masses about 10
times that of the Sun and their respective luminosities are 16,200
and 10,800 times that of the Sun.



Pi-5 Orionis (8 Orionis) has an apparent magnitude of 3.70 and is
1,342 light years distant from the solar system.
Pi-6 Orionis (10 Orionis) is a bright orange giant belonging to the
spectral class K2II. It is a variable star with a mean visual magnitude
of 4.45. The star lies 954 light years from Earth.
η Orionis (Eta Orionis)
Eta Orionis is an eclipsing binary star system that consists of two
blue stars, belonging to the spectral type B0.5V, approximately 900
light years distant. It belongs to the Orion Arm, which is a minor
spiral arm of the Milky Way, sometimes also known as the Orion Spur
or the Orion-Cygnus Arm.
Eta Orionis, located just to the west of Orionʼs Belt, has several
traditional names: Saiph (which it shares with Kappa Orionis),
Algjebbah, and Ensis, which means “sword” in Latin.
The star is classified as a Beta Lyrae variable, a type of close binary
star with variations in brightness caused by one component
occasionally passing in front of the other one. It has a visual
magnitude of 3.38.
σ Orionis (Sigma Orionis)
Sigma Orionis is a multiple star system in Orion constellation. It
consists of five stars located a little south of Alnitak. The
componentsʼ apparent magnitudes range from 4.2 to 6.7. The
system is approximately 1,150 light years distant.
The primary component in the Sigma Orionis system is a double star,
Sigma Orionis AB, composed of two hydrogen-fusing dwarfs
separated by only 0.25 arc seconds. The brighter star is blue. It



belongs to the spectral type O9V, and has an apparent magnitude of
4.2. The companion belongs to the spectral class B0.5V and has a
visual magnitude of 5.1. The two stars orbit each other every 170
years.
Sigma Orionis C is a dwarf star belonging to the spectral type A2V. It
has an apparent magnitude of 8.79.
Sigma Orionis D and E are also dwarfs. Both belong to the spectral
type B2V and their respective magnitudes are 6.62 and 6.66. Sigma
Orionis E is notable for being exceptionally rich in helium.
τ Orionis (Tau Orionis)
Tau Orionis belongs to the spectral class B5III and is 555 light years
distant. With an apparent magnitude of 3.59, the star can be seen
without binoculars.
χ1 Orionis (Chi-1 Orionis)
Chi-1 Orionis is a main sequence dwarf, only 28 light years distant
from Earth. It belongs to the spectral type G0V and has an apparent
magnitude of 4.39. It has a faint red dwarf for a companion, with an
orbital period of 14.1 years.
Gliese 208
Gliese 208 is an orange dwarf, belonging to the spectral class K7. It
has an apparent magnitude of 8.9 and is only 37.1 light years distant.
The star is believed to have passed only 5 light years from the Sun
approximately 500,000 years ago.
V380 Orionis
V380 Orionis is a triple star system that lights the reflection nebula



V380 Orionis and the reflection nebula NGC 1999, image: NASA and the Hubble Heritage Team
NGC 1999, located near the
Orion Nebula.
The nebula has a huge hole of
empty space appearing as a
black patch in its central
region. The reason why the
patch appears black has not
yet been determined, but one
theory suggests that narrow
jets of gas from the
neighbouring young stars may
have punctured the sheet of
dust and gas in the nebula and
strong radiation from an older star in the region may have helped
create the hole.
The nebula lies about 1,500 light years from Earth.
V380 Orionis belongs to the spectral type A0 and is approximately
1,000 light years distant.
GJ 3379
GJ 3379 is the nearest Orion constellation star to the solar system. It
is located only 17.5 light years away. It is a red dwarf, belonging to
the spectral class M3.5V, with a visual magnitude of 11.33. GJ 3379
is believed to have come within 4.3 light years from the Sun about
163,000 years ago.
DEEP SKY OBJECTS IN ORION
Orion Molecular Cloud Complex



Orion Nebula – Messier 42, photo: ESO, J. Emerson, VISTA. Acknowledgment: Cambridge Astronomical Survey Unit
The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, or simply the Orion Complex, is
comprised of a large group of dark clouds, bright emission and
reflection nebulae, dark nebulae, H II regions (large clouds showing
recent star forming activity) and young stars in the constellation
Orion. The Orion Complex is between 1,500 and 1,600 light years
distant. Several parts of it – the famous Orion Nebula, for one – can
be seen with the naked eye. The Orion Molecular Cloud Complex
contains most of the well-known deep sky objects in Orion: the Orion
Nebula, Barnardʼs Loop, the Flame Nebula, the Horsehead Nebula,
Messier 43 and Messier 78.
Orion Nebula – Messier 42 (M42, NGC 1976)
The Orion Nebula, or Messier 42, is a diffuse emission reflection
nebula located south of the three stars that form Orionʼs Belt.
Sometimes it is also called the Great Nebula or the Great Orion
Nebula.
The nebula is one of the brightest
ones in the sky and can be seen
without binoculars. It has a visual
magnitude of 4.0 and is 1,344 light
years distant from Earth.
To the naked eye, the Orion Nebula
appears as the slightly blurry central
“star” in Orionʼs Sword, south of
Orionʼs Belt.
Messier 42 is the nearest known
region of massive star formation to
the solar system. It is part of the
Orion Molecular Cloud Cluster.



The Orion Nebula contains the Trapezium, or the Orion Trapezium
Cluster, a very young open cluster easily recognizable by its four
brightest stars, which form a trapezium-shaped asterism.
The Trapezium (Orion Trapezium Cluster)
The Trapezium is a young, tight open star cluster located in the
centre of the Orion Nebula. It is 47 arc seconds in size and has an
apparent magnitude of 4.0. The cluster was first discovered by
Galileo Galilei on February 4, 1617. He drew three of the stars (A, C
and D), and the fourth one was added by observers in 1673. By 1888,
eight stars were discovered in the cluster. The brightest five emit
most of the light that illuminates the surrounding nebula.
The Orion Trapezium Cluster is easily identifiable in the sky by the
asterism formed by the four brightest stars, A, B, C and D.

The brightest and most massive star in the cluster, component C, is
Theta-1 Orionis C, a blue main sequence star belonging to the
spectral class O6pe V. The star has a visual magnitude of 5.13 and is

approximately 1,500 light years distant. It is one of the most
luminous stars known, with an absolute magnitude of -3.2. Theta-1
Orionis C is also the star with the highest surface temperature of any
star that is visible to the naked eye: 45,500 K.
De Mairanʼs Nebula
Messier 43 (M43, NGC
1982)
Messier 43, or De Mairanʼs
Nebula, is a star-forming
emission-reflection nebula in
Orion. The famous H II region
was first discovered by the
French chronobiologist,
astronomer and geophysicist
Jean-Jacques Dortous de
Mairan in 1731.
Charles Messier later designated the nebulosity Messier 43 and
included it in his catalogue.
De Mairanʼs Nebula is part of the Orion Nebula, but separated from it
by a large lane of interstellar dust. It has an apparent magnitude of
9.0 and is 1,600 light years distant.
The nebula is located about seven arc minutes north of the
Trapezium cluster.
Messier 78 (M78, NGC 2068)
Messier 78 is a reflection nebula in Orion. It was first observed by the
French astronomer Pierre Méchain in 1780 and included in Messierʼs
catalogue later that year.

The nebula surrounds two
10th magnitude stars and can
easily be found in a small
telescope. It also contains
some 45 T Tauri type
variables, young stars still in
the process of formation.
Messier 78 has a visual
magnitude of 8.3 and is 1,600
light years distant.
Horsehead Nebula
The Horsehead Nebula, also known as Barnard 33, is a famous dark
nebula in Orion. It is located south of Alnitak, in the bright emission
nebula IC 434. The Horsehead Nebula is approximately 1,500 light
years distant. It was discovered by the American astronomer
Williamina Fleming in 1888.

The nebula got the name Horsehead because of the shape formed
by the dark dust clouds and gases, one that resembles the head of a
horse when observed from Earth.
Barnardʼs Loop
Barnardʼs Loop is an emission nebula
located in the Orion Molecular Cloud
Complex.
The nebula has an an apparent
magnitude of 5 and is about 1,600 light
years distant from the solar system. It is
believed to have originated in a
supernova explosion about two million
years ago.
Barnardʼs Loop was named after E.E.
Barnard, the astrophotographer who photographed the nebula and
published a description in 1894.
Barnardʼs Loop is approximately 150 light years in radius and it
covers much of the Orion constellation.
It appears as a large arc centred on Messier 42 (the Orion Nebula).
The loop is believed to be ionized by the stars located in the Orion
Nebula.
The Flame Nebula (NGC 2024)
The Flame Nebula is an emission nebula in Orion. It has a visual
magnitude of 2.0 and is between 900 and 1,500 light years distant.

The Flame Nebula is illuminated by
the light of the hot blue supergiant
Alnitak, the easternmost star in
Orionʼs Belt.
Alnitak emits ultraviolet light into the
nebula, knocking electrons away
from the hydrogen gas clouds inside
the nebula, and the glow of the
nebula is the result of the electrons
and ionized hydrogen recombining.
The Flame Nebula resides in the
Orion Molecular Cloud Complex.
The 37 Cluster – NGC 2169
NGC 2169 is an open star
cluster, approximately 3,600
light years away from the
solar system. It has an
apparent magnitude of 5.9.
The cluster was originally
discovered by the Italian
astronomer Giovanni Batista
Hodierna in the mid-17th
century and then later independently spotted by William Herschel on
October 15, 1784.
It is sometimes called The 37 Cluster because it resembles the
number 37.
NGC 2169 is just under seven arc minutes in diameter and consists

of about 30 stars, which are only eight million years old. The
brightest one has an apparent magnitude of 6.94.
NGC 2023
NGC 2023 is a reflection
nebula in Orion constellation.
The nebula is notable for
being one of the brightest
sources of fluorescent
molecular hydrogen.
It is lit by the B star HD
37903, the most luminous
star lighting the surface of
the molecular cloud Lynds 1630 (Horsehead Nebula, or Barnard 33),
and one of the largest reflection nebulae in the sky. It is four light
years wide.
NGC 2023 can be found a third of a degree from the Horsehead
Nebula. It is 1467.7 light years distant from Earth.
Monkey Head Nebula – NGC 2174
NGC 2174 is an emission nebula classified
as an H II region.
It is associated with the open cluster NGC
2175, also located in Orion.
The nebula is approximately 6,400 light
years distant. It is also known as the Monkey
Head Nebula because of its unusual shape
in wide field images.
