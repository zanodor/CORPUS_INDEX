EGYPTIAN RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS IN JUDAH AND ISRAEL FROM 900 B.C.E. TO 587 B.C.E.: A STUDY OF SEAL ICONOGRAPHY
by
FLORIS NICOLAS VERMEULEN
Submitted in accordance with the requirements for the degree of

SUMMARY
When cultures meet, mutual influences and cultural exchanges are unavoidable.
Egypt’s contact with Syro-Palestine goes back to at least the Chalcolithic Period.
Egypt was a major role player in the region throughout the Bronze Age. The
discoveries at Ugarit have placed a lot of emphasis on possible Canaanite influences
on the religion of ancient Israel.
The purpose of this study is to investigate if cultural exchanges led to Egyptian
religious concepts being accepted in Israel and Judah during the period 900-587
B.C.E. (Iron IIB and C). For this reason the iconography on contemporary seals was
investigated. Symbols in ancient times, especially amongst illiterate societies, were
important instruments in conveying ideas and concepts. The Hebrew Bible abounds
with symbolism to illustrate the powers of Yahweh. Egyptian iconography on Hebrew
seals, in particular seal amulets, has been regarded by most biblical scholars as mere
decorations and the amulets regarded as ‘good luck’ charms.
Seal amulets were important instruments of magical ritual in ancient Egypt, where
there was no distinction between magic and religion. Biblical prohibitions against
magic show that in Israel and Judah, it was regarded as a form of idolatry, thus
religious rituals.
An important factor to be considered is the influence of Phoenicia on the region
during the Period. Close relationships seem to have existed between Phoenicia with
the United Kingdom of Israel and later with the northern Kingdom of Israel. An
investigation of Phoenician seals from the period revealed that Egyptian religious



iconography was used by all levels of Phoenician society. They inter alia used
Egyptian imagery to portray their own gods.
Seals from Israel and Judah during Iron IIB and C indicate that Egyptian religious
iconography was also used on seals by all levels of society in those kingdoms. Israel,
due to its close proximity to Phoenicia, probably imported these images via
Phoenicia. Judah, due to its isolation, probably got those images directly from Egypt.
Some of these images may be ascribed to attempts to portray aspects of Yahweh’s
powers. Others convey definite Egyptian religious messages. Egyptian influences on
Israelite religion played a larger role than previously accepted.
Key terms:
Archaeology; Biblical Archaeology; Syro-Palestine; the northern Kingdom of Israel;
the southern Kingdom of Judah; Phoenicia; Egypt; Iron Ages IIB and C; culture;
cultural exchange; religion; seals; seal amulets; seal iconography.

DEDICATION
I dedicate this study to my wonderful wife Myra, our children Herman, Surene, Petrus
and Wilma and our four grandchildren Wessels, Nicola, Myralene and Wihan who
have patiently borne the brunt of my unavailability, impatience and sometimes
rudeness. The years lost cannot be retrieved and for that I humbly apologise to you
all.
Sed fugit interea, fugit inreparabile
tempus,
singula dum capti circumvectamur
amore.
Hic labor, hinc laudem fortes sperate
coloni.
Nec sum animi dubius, verbis ea vincere
magnum
quam sit, et angustis hunc addere rebus
honorem;
sed me Parnasi deserta per ardua dulcis
raptat amor; iuvat ire iugis, qua nulla
priorum
Castaliam molli devertitur orbita clivo.
Publius Vergilius Maro
Georgicon, liber III (284-294.)
Fast flies meanwhile the irreparable hour,
As point to point our charmed round we
trace.
Here lies a labour; hence for glory look,
Brave husbandmen. Nor doubtfully know
How hard it is for words to triumph here,
And shed their lustre on a theme so slight:
But I am caught by ravishing desire
Above the lone Parnassian steep; I love
To walk the heights, from whence no earlier
track
Slopes gently downward to Castalia's spring.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 INTRODUCTION
‘Recent finds from Tel Rehov shed a bright light on domestic religious observance in
ancient Israel and, like so many archaeological finds, raise unanswered questions,
reminding us how little we really know’ (Mazar & Panitz-Cohen 2008:40).
‘---the dominant view among scholars has been that the Israelite populace as a whole
was not monotheistic or even monolatrous until shortly before or even after the fall of
the Judahite kingdom in 587 B.C.E.’ (Tigay 1987:157).
‘What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt and Assyria? ---For you have as
many gods as there are cities and towns in Judah’ (Je 2:18-28).
It is an indisputable fact that throughout history an intermingling of societies has led
to a cross pollination of cultures or cultural exchanges, including religion. From the
Chalcolithic Period to Iron II, mostly for geographical reasons, there was continuous
contact between Egypt and the land of Canaan.

1 All references in this study to the ‘Bible’ connotates the Hebrew Bible. Quotations in English are from The Holy Bible: New International Version. When references are made to occurrences in ‘the Bible’, it is not intended to place any historical value on such biblical information. The various writers of the books of the Bible pertaining to proto-Israelite or Israelite ‘history’ probably either related actual ‘history’ or created ‘history’ or simply took ‘historical’ legends from other nations such as the Sumerians, Babylonians or Persians and made them part of their own Israelite ‘history’. Unless corroborated by other evidence such as external texts or archaeological finds, it is impossible and unscholarly to accept the historicity of biblical ‘facts’. On the other hand, these biblical writers would not have written these ‘facts’ without a purpose. It could have been written to serve as a background for the Israelite religious development or to give the Israelites a ‘sense of belonging’ as a nation during the Babylonian exile and afterwards. One should therefore see such ‘historical’ facts in the context of the message that these writers intended to convey. A reference to the creation and worship by the Israelites of a golden calf and the subsequent consequences may for instance be a dire warning of the consequences of accepting foreign gods, such as Canaanite or Egyptian gods. I will endeavour to place ‘historical’ facts from the Bible in context.



2
According to Cornelius (2008:105): ‘The north was influenced by Aramaic and
Phoenician ideas and Judah more by Egypt’ during Iron IIB and C (Cf. Colon
1995:97). Phoenician iconography on seals during this period also reflects a strong
Egyptian influence.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the acceptance and use by the Israelites and
Judahites of Egyptian religious symbols during Iron IIB and C. The use of such
symbols could be the result of direct cultural exchanges with Egypt or indirectly via
other nations such as the Canaanites and later the Phoenicians. During the twentieth
century, especially since the early 1930’s, a lot of emphasis was placed on the
Canaanite influences on the religion of the Israelites from Iron Age I to the Persian
Period. This was mainly the result of the discoveries at Ugarit, which were enhanced
by other discoveries.
‘...The one-sided orientation toward the world of hearing (and reading) has led to the
situation that the religious history of Palestine (ca. 1800-500) has been reconstructed
predominantly on the basis of two lexical corpora: the texts of Ugarit (especially the
mythology) and the Bible, and this situation continues. Recently discovered Israelite
and Judahite inscriptions are screened through the symbol system deduced from
Ugaritic texts and then interpreted on this basis’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:395).
The Yahweh/Asherah inscriptions at Khirbet el-Qom and Kuntillet ‘Ajrud, for
example, are amongst the further materials relating to Canaanite connections.
Scholarly debates surrounding the issues whether Yahweh had been considered to
have a consort or not, led to intensive research and voluminous papers.

The reasoning behind these debates cannot be questioned. One finds in the Bible that
one of the names of the God of Israel was El. This happened to such an extent that
scholars classify the various writers of the Bible books as inter alia the E-writers (for
El or Elohim) (or E-school or E-source) and J-writers (for Yahweh) (or school or
source). Other writers are known as the D-school (for Deuteronomistic) and the P
school (for Priestly) (Dever 2001:102). The fact that El had initially been the main
god of the Canaanites was too much of a coincidence to be ignored. In Canaanite
religion El had a consort called Asherah and the discovery that Yahweh probably also
had Asherah as a consort, led to a lot of excitement in the circles of biblical
scholarship. In the Bible the Israelites are condemned (especially by various prophets)
for religious practices involving Canaanite gods such as Baal, Asherah and Astarte.
The fact that the Israelites were living next to or even amongst the Canaanites seems
to indicate that the biblical writers did not write hypothetically but were probably
pointing out actual factual occurrences.
Scholars also took note of Mesopotamian religious concepts that emerged in the
religion and religious history of the Israelites. Major parts of the Bible was written
during and after the Babylonian exile and consequently it is to be expected that some
of the Mesopotamian historical folklore, culture as well as religious practice and
beliefs were incorporated in the writing of an Israelite ‘history’ (Cf. Zevit 2001:10).
There are some modern scholars, especially the ‘Copenhagen School’, who dates the
writing of the Bible to a period much later than the exile. The ‘Copenhagen School’
includes scholars such as Thomas Thompson, Niels Peter Lemche as well as Philip
Davies (Cf. Brettler 2003:1-6). Lemche (1993:182) is of the opinion that the major



4
part of the Bible is of a Hellenistic nature, but he concedes that it may include
recollections of earlier historical events. In a contradictory statement Lemche
(1993:163) states that Jewish―Rabbinic collection of writings dates no earlier than
the 2nd Century CE. It does not fall within the scope of this study to get involved in
the controversy caused by this point of view and by what Dever (2001:24) calls ‘a
very small minority of biblical scholars.’ I merely want to point to the Dead Sea
Scrolls to state that the 2nd
The ‘biblical history’ includes the alleged Mesopotamian origins of the Israelites in
that it alleges that Abraham hailed from the Sumerian city of Ur. It later led to Isaac
and Jacob taking wives from that region and that Jacob’s wife, Rachel, took her
father’s household gods with her. These ‘historical’ references to Abraham were
probably intended to relate folklore about the influx of Semitic nomads from
Mesopotamia into Canaan and ought not to be accepted at face value. If such nomads
indeed hailed from Mesopotamia, ‘historical’ similarities between the Bible
(especially the first eleven chapters of Genesis) and early Mesopotamian writings
such as the Gilgamesh and some Mesopotamian influence on the religion of the
Israelites are therefore to be expected and should not be regarded as coincidental.
Century CE seems a ludicrous date. Another author, Philip
Davies, admits that the Pentateuch probably existed before the time of Nehemiah and
Ezra (Davies 1998:101). Dever (2001:23-52) analyses writings by some of these
scholars whom he calls nihilists and contradicts them on archaeological data. I do not
want to take the matter any further and it should suffice to state that for purposes of
this study it does not really matter when exactly the various sections of the Bible were
written.

Some scholars2 have noted Egyptian influences in the development of the religion of
Israel, but due to assumed, though unfounded perceptions, lack of artifacts3 and
structures4
‘However, associations between Egyptian texts and the Old and New Testament have
been traced, and it is probable that some biblical elements were derived from
Egyptian beliefs’ (David 1999:128). This author states that biblical texts may have
been influenced by some of the Egyptian traditions and beliefs especially books like
Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Psalms and Job. The closest parallels can
be drawn between Egyptian texts during the New Kingdom (a time when Egypt’s
direct influence in Palestine seemed to have been at its highest) and Proverbs. The
similarity between the religious ideas expressed in Psalm 104 in the Bible and the
hymn to the Aten, composed during the Amarna-period, is also remarkable, both
describing the divine role as creative and sustaining.
that can be directly related to Egyptian religious practices, most of the
comments are superficial and incidental.
2 Zevit 2001:267-349, 606. Zevit (2001:606) claims that although the Egyptian symbolism found on seals in Palestine may have a religious connotation, there are no indications that they had a cultic status in Israel. They do not appear as votives or in combination with other cultic artifacts (2001:343-344) (Cf. Mazar 1992:92, 174, 187-188 and 273). Albright (1968:67) rejects any religious meaning in respect of the majority of the numerous seals with Israelite or Judahite names and Egyptian iconography. Nakhai (2001:91) argues that as early as MB IIA there was a transmission of religious ideas amongst Egypt, Canaan and Syria. Mazar (1992:506-507) acknowledges the importance of engraved Hebrew seals from the eighth and seventh centuries as a source of our knowledge of art and iconography in Israel and Judah. Although the themes were inspired by Phoenician art, and thus indirectly from Egyptian traditions, these foreign symbols were, according to Mazar, only employed as decoration without any religious significance.
3 In this regard we think of the more obvious instruments used for worship, such as altars, shrines, figurines, cultic stands and other votive implements. The purpose of this study is inter alia to show that there indeed is no lack of artifacts that are related to Egyptian religious customs (Cf. Keel & Uehlinger 1998:49-108).
4 Again this is not a correct assumption. The two temples at Beth-Shean as well as a temple to Amun in Gaza clearly indicate Egyptian cults survived in Palestine until well into the Iron Age (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:110).



6
Recent valuable contributions in this field were made by BU Schipper (1999 and
2001). He investigates the cultural exchanges between Egypt and Israel with
emphasis on the political, commercial and personal contacts from the time of King
Solomon to the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians. The corresponding period in
Egypt dates from the 21st to the 26th Dynasties. As sources for his study, he
concentrates on the Bible, Egyptian texts and archaeological data. The 21st Dynasty of
Libyan pharaohs concentrated on internal policies to rebuild Egypt after its decline
during the reign of the later Ramesside pharaohs. During the 22nd
‘After seeking advice, the king made two golden calves. He said to the people, “It is
too much for you to go up to Jerusalem. Here are your gods, O Israel, who brought
you up out of Egypt.”---Jeroboam built shrines on high places and appointed priests
from all sorts of people, ---and offered sacrifices on the altar’ (1 Ki 12:28-32).
Dynasty Sheshonq
I invaded Palestine and later his son Osorkon I (see footnote 10 on p19 as well as
Chapter 4 hereinafter for a more detailed discussion).
Although the Bible does not clarify the origin, the resemblance with the golden calf
of Sinai is obvious and again this may be a mere reference to deviations from the
Yahweh-religion and not based on a particular historical event. One should be careful
however not to discard all biblical events as fictitious, hypothetical or metaphorical.
Some may actually be historical or contain a kernel of truth. Without other
corroborating evidence it will however be difficult to establish the historical value.
‘Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and molded and tooled it into the shape of
a calf. The people exclaimed, “O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of
Egypt!”’ (Ex 32:3-4).



7
In Hosea 13:2 the prophet cautions against calf idols. According to the biblical story
of the Exodus from Egypt, it occurred after generations of the descendants of Jacob
(including Aaron) had been established in Egypt and had been exposed to Egyptian
deities. God had to explain to Moses who he was when he accosted him at the
burning bush, not stating that He was the only God, but the God of your father, the
God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob (Ex. 2:6). The Israelite
sojourn in Egypt has not been confirmed by other sources and cannot be accepted as
historically correct. It could, in my opinion, be seen metaphorically of the power of
Yahweh. He has the power to free his people from bondage and to overcome other
foreign gods.
In Egypt several bovine gods were worshiped. In Memphis it was Apis, at Heliopolis
we find Mnevi and at Armant the Buchis bull (Dunant, Zivie-Coche & Lorton
2005:21). The goddess Hathor’s familiar animal was the cow (Moorey 2003:37). She
was often depicted as a cow and was the major goddess of Egypt, the Lady of heaven,
earth and the underworld, worshipped throughout Egypt and indeed beyond as far as
Syria (Geddes and Grosset 1997:374).
5
In later periods, Isis also became associated with a cow, to such an extent that it is
5 The length of the alleged sojourn of the Israelites in Egypt, if the biblical version of such sojourn is accepted, has been a matter of contention amongst biblical scholars. The Bible itself gives contradictory periods. Genesis 15:13 predicts a period of 400 years and in Genesis 15:16 it is stated that in the fourth generation, Abraham’s seed will return to Canaan. In Exodus 12:40-41 it is related that the children of Israel dwelt in Egypt for 430 years. A detailed discussion appears in Osman (2002:250-254). The exact number of years of the sojourn is however, irrelevant for purposes of this study. Suffice to state that according to the Bible it was for an extended period, more than enough for the descendants of Jacob to accept Egyptian culture and religious practises as their own. The God who Moses encountered at the burning bush was, despite his Hebrew heritage, unfamiliar to him and to the Israelites. The continuous rebellion of the Israelites against Moses and this ‘new’ God in the period to follow, is, therefore, totally comprehensible.



8
sometimes extremely difficult to distinguish representations of the two goddesses,
unless there is an accompanying hieroglyphic inscription.
Calf and bull idols are not unknown to other religions, including the religion of the
Canaanites and it would, therefore, not be possible to categorically claim that the
calves of Aaron and Jeroboam were indeed directly based on Egyptian models.
If the Bible is literally read in a historical context, then it is conceivable that the Sinai
calf was created in the context of the Egyptian religion and that Jeroboam followed
the tradition. If one considers that the Bible was probably written at a stage when the
Israelites had for centuries been exposed to Canaanite and later Phoenician deities, it
could be argued that the calves were of Canaanite origin and that these gods were
stronger than the Egyptian gods, thus assuring the safe escape of the Israelites from
Egypt.
6
It should also be kept in mind that according to the Biblical story, Jacob (Israel) and
his sons migrated from Canaan to Egypt probably during the same period when the
Ugaritic texts were written. Again one should not accept this biblical description at
face value. Jacob and his sons probably refer to early Semitic nomads (or Hebrews?)
that wandered into Egypt and made contact with the Egyptians. Some of these
nomads probably settled in Egypt. This story could perhaps even be linked to the
Hyksos invasion of Egypt and their subsequent expulsion. Most of the sons of Jacob,
according to Genesis 34:16-29, apparently married Canaanite women
6 At Ashkelon in the context of MB IIC (thus Canaanite) a small silver-plated bronze calf, inside a cylinder shaped ceramic shrine, was found (Stager 1991:25-29). This was before the Philistine settlement and clearly a Canaanite idol. In LB IIA context a statuette of a man standing on a bull and a bronze bull were discovered in front of the Orthostat temple. Yadin (1972:95) is of the opinion that these figures represent the storm god Haddad or Baal. Bonfil (1997:101) came to the same conclusion.



9
This may refer to original nomads entering Palestine from Mesopotamia who married
Canaanite women. It is probable that these women would have retained their
Canaanite religious practices and passing them on to their children.
During the migration to Egypt, Canaanite religion could have been well established
amongst the ‘descendants of Jacob’ or those nomads that entered Egypt from Canaan.
Joseph, on the other hand, according to Genesis 41:50, married the daughter of an
Egyptian priest from On (Heliopolis) thus establishing an Egyptian religious
influence. It is conceivable this ‘episode’ refer to marriages between Hebrews and
Egyptians in general.
After the alleged exodus from Egypt and back in Canaan the Israelites were
continuously in direct contact with the Canaanites and their culture. Whether the
sojourn in Egypt is true or partially true (some elements of the later Israelite nation
could have hailed from Egypt), the fact is that the Israelites were indeed established
as a nation in Canaan.
It has indeed been argued that the material cultures of the early Israelites and the
Canaanites are so similar that it is nearly impossible to distinguish between the two.7
Thus, there are also convincing scholarly views that the core of the group which
ultimately formed the Israelites, came from the low country of Canaan itself and
moved into the higher areas. 8 This could have been the result of the simultaneous
7 Fritz (1994:145 states): ‘While Philistine culture exhibits an independent character, due to its Aegean origin, Israelite and Canaanite settlements are indistinguishable in material culture’. According to Dever 2003:121: ‘Thus our early Israelites look ceramically just like Canaanites.’ (Cf. Smith 2002:1920).
8 Dever (2003:191-221) discusses in detail, at the hand of archaeological evidence, the probable scenario of the Proto-Israelites and the development of at least the core of the later Israelites from Canaanite origins.



10
settlement of the Sea Peoples in the coastal areas of Palestine resulting into a forced
migration of some of the Canaanites. The more logical explanation seems to be that
the demise of the strong Canaanite cities necessitated this step. Some scholars argue
that if the core of the Israelites, while establishing themselves in the hill country of
Canaan, did not hail from Egypt, at least a portion of them did in fact came from
Egypt.
Should either the biblical story about the lengthy stay of the whole Israelite nation in
Egypt or the theory that at least some of the Israelites migrated from Egypt be true,
then it is also inconceivable that cultural exchanges between the Egyptians and the
Israelites, including matters pertaining to the religion of the early Israelites would
have been avoided.
In view of the official religious development in Israel and Judah portrayed in the
Bible and the obvious Canaanite role models which seem to have been particularly
influential (including the continuous condemnation of the worship of Canaanite gods
such as Baal, Asherah and Astarte), the Canaanite connection in respect of the calves
appear to be the most probable scenario.
Since the Bible was for the most part apparently written during Iron II C and the
Persian Period, contemporary religious practices in the region would have been
prevailing in the minds of the writers. The failure to condemn Egyptian idols creates
the impression that during these periods they were not, even in respect of unofficial
religious practices, regarded as posing a threat to the official religion.
Should a possible Egyptian connection with the religious practices in the region,
especially during Iron IIB and C and more in particular with regard to unofficial



11
religious practices, therefore be ignored? For several reasons that will be discussed in
detail during the course of this study, I want to argue to the contrary. It seems that the
matter is not a simple one to be referred to in passing whilst attention is drawn to the
adoption of Canaanite religious practises or idols by the Israelites. It may even be
possible that Canaanite religion, in its initial and even later stages were influenced by
the Egyptians. The Ugaritic texts date from a very late period (Late Bronze Age) in
the history of the Canaanites, whilst Egyptian influence in the region (see paragraph
1.3 hereinafter) dates back to at least the Chalcolithic.
1.2 DEFINING VARIOUS CONCEPTS
1.2.1 Introduction
Whether one is dealing with individuals, groups of people, nations or various nations,
contact between individuals or nations is unavoidable, unless one is a fictional
Robinson Crusoe secluded on a deserted island. These meetings may be deliberate or
by accident and various motifs may be involved. It could be mere social intercourse,
for trade purposes, to gain something desired by force or various other reasons.
Whatever the reason, certain relationships develop as a result of these meetings and
these relationships are harmonised and regulated by a system of rules, whether by
custom, tacit or expressed agreement or issued by authorities, the latter being either
democratically appointed or enthroned by force. Certain interest, preferences and
activities may join people together and social norms and moral standards are required
to regulate these relationships. It is therefore important for purposes of this study,



12
which is aimed at the results of certain relationships, to briefly discuss some concepts
pertaining to such relationships.
1.2.3 Relevant concepts
1.2.2.1 Adaptation
It consists of patterns of behavior which enable a culture to cope with its
surroundings in order to establish protocols of both freedom and constraint (Bennett
2002:38).
1.2.2.2 Appropriation
Initially in all the languages of Western Europe appropriation referred to taking
possession of material goods. In the course of the past three decades ‘appropriation’
has become a major tool for cultural analysis. Appropriation is the way in which the
intended receivers — or even the not intended receivers — make things, ideas
symbols their own, though their transformation and adaptation to the receivers’
standards, whatever these may be, and how far they may be removed from the
intentions of the sender (Korsten 1999: 94-95).
1.2.2.3 Culture
Culture (from the Latin cultura stemming from colere, meaning ‘to cultivate’) is a
term that has different meanings. For purposes of this study I accept the
anthropological definition of culture by Kroeber & Kluckhohn (1963:357):
‘Culture consists of patterns, explicit and implicit, of and for behavior acquired and
transmitted by symbols, constituting the distinctive achievement of human groups,
including their embodiment of artifacts; the essential core of culture consists of
traditional (i.e., historically derived and selected) ideas and especially their attached



13
values; culture systems may, on the one hand, be considered as products of actions,
on the other as conditioning elements of further action.’
Fagan & De Course (2005:115) states that in terms of archaeology, culture is
perceived to have three components:
a. An individual’s own version of his or her culture; diversified individual behaviour
which make up the totality of a culture;
b. Those elements of a culture shared by every individual, such as religious
practises. Language is an essential element as well as the cultural system;
c. The cultural system is the system of behaviour in which every individual
participates. The individual not only shares the system with others, but also
actively participates in it.
1.2.2.4 Cultural exchange
People as human groups do not live in isolation but are in continuous contact with
other peoples and their cultures, resulting in the exchange of cultural elements
between the groups. These exchanges may be friendly (diffusion) or the result of
forceful expressions (acculturation):
(a) Diffusion
Diffusion is the spread of customs or practises from one culture to another where
cultural elements from one society are borrowed by members of another society.
These exchanges normally occur in a friendly way without any hostilities involved.
Peoples, however, tend to accept their own innovations to their culture more readily
than borrowed innovations (Haviland 1996:422-423).



14
According to Zevit (2001:689) the cultural elements that may be borrowed ‘can be
broken into distinct categories:
1. things learned by observing: technology, tools, agricultural methods, architecture,
building techniques, dress, military techniques, cuisine and the like;
2. things learned by listening: language, myths, laws, poetry, music;
3. things learned by empathetic understanding after close understanding: values,
priorities, attitudes towards age, wisdom, honor, shame, work, piety, and the like.’
The concept ‘borrow’ in this context implies that the cultural items are imported for
personal or communal use and incorporated into an integrated cultural system (Zevit
2001:689).
(b) Acculturation.
This comprises major cultural changes that people (by one or both groups) are forced
to make as a consequence of intensive, firsthand contact between societies (Haviland
1996:425). Acculturation normally occurs ‘when a number of items in category 1
(note: see ‘diffusion’ above) and language from category 2 is ...adopted’ (Zevit
2001:689).
Archaeology (and therefore also this study) works primarily with the first category,
whether such cultural exchange was the result of diffusion or acculturation.
1.2.2.5 Interaction
It is a mutual or reciprocal action or effect. ‘It is a joint activity, whose performance
replicates part of the coherent and “corporate” structures of the societies and cultures
to which the individual participants belong’ (Rapport & Overing 2000:198).



15
1.2.2.6 Transculturation
Transculturation is a term to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging
cultures. It describes the different phases of the process of transition from one culture
to another (Millington 2005:219)
1.3 STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM
In isolation, the biblical stories such as those of the golden calves should not be
regarded as evidence to endeavour proving either Egyptian or Canaanite influences in
Israelite religious practices. Archaeological finds such as the Ugaritic texts go a long
way in establishing some Canaanite foundation. These are complemented by
figurines, shrines, altars, mourning and burial practices and various other aspects of
corresponding material cultures. To categorise the religious practises of the common
Israelite as mostly Canaanite and to accept that Canaanite religion developed in
isolation would be tantamount to ignoring the history of the region and the fact that it
was situated at the crossroads between the big powers of the Bronze and Iron Ages.
Egyptians, Hittites, Assyrians, Babylonians and lesser nations most assuredly left
their marks on the region.
Historically, at least in the earliest periods, mostly for geographical reasons, the
Egyptians of all the major nations appeared to have had the most contact with the
region, either as trade partners, as invaders or just passing through the territory. These
contacts would undoubtedly have led to Egyptian concepts being brought into the
culture, including the religion of the inhabitants. The Fifteenth Dynasty in Egypt was



16
established by Canaanites (the Hyksos) who ruled Lower Egypt for approximately
100 years.
Scholars have not neglected the contact and cultural exchanges between Egypt and
the Palestine region. The question is, however, has enough emphasis been placed on
the importance of such exchanges?
9
Archaeological evidence points to a strong possibility of contact between the Levant
and Egypt during prehistoric times, at least as far back as the Chalcolithic period
(Mazar 1992:78-790).
A lack of essential raw materials, indispensable for a developing society, forced the
Egyptians from the beginning of their civilisation to reach beyond their borders.
Egyptian pottery and flint blades from the late Pre-Dynastic Period, discovered in
Palestine, are clear indicators of relationships between the two regions during EB I.
The emergence of the pharaonic civilisation dates back to ca. 3100 B.C.E. with the
unification of Upper and Lower Egypt. EB II pottery from Palestine and Syria
discovered in Egyptian tombs from the First Dynasty shows a continuation of such
relations (Mazar 1992:105-107). Archaeological sites in northern Sinai and southern
Palestine indicate a predominant Egyptian presence in the form of settlements during
9 The name ‘Hyksos’ is a Hellenized name derived from the Egyptian which means ‘ruler from foreign lands’ (Keel and Uehlinger 1998:17). Flavius Josephus believed that the Hyksos were ‘the children of Israel’ and quoted Manetho who stated that ‘the foreigners were called Hyksos, which signifies “shepherd kings”’. Queen Hatshepsut, in an inscription referred to the Hyksos as a people not knowing Ra. Their chief deity was Sutekh, a weather and war god and his appearance in Egypt points to a definite foreign influence. The Hyksos kings endeavoured to compel the Egyptians to recognise Sutekh in their pantheon. During the New Kingdom he was identified with Seth (Geddes & Grosset 1997:213). This is an important example of the cross pollination in ancient times of cultures and religions. As a result, the continuous contact between Egypt and the land of Canaan from the Chalcolithic Period to Iron II would have led to the assimilation in one culture of some of the cultural (including religious) concepts and practises of the other.



17
this period. It is not clear if these settlements were the result of mere trade
relationships or active Egyptian colonization. Although some of them may have been
military outposts, there is no evidence of Egyptian military incursions into the area.
These settlements lasted for about 100 years and came to an end in EB II. Military
invasions from Egypt into the Levant apparently started during the Fifth Dynasty and
seem to have gained momentum during the Sixth Dynasty when the third pharaoh of
that Dynasty, Pepi I conducted military raids against cities in Palestine.
According to archaeological evidence it is clear that by the time of the Twelfth
Dynasty there was extensive contact between Egypt and Palestine (Marcus 1991: 19
44). It seems that these contacts established bilateral relations between the regions,
mainly as a result of trade requirements (Ilan 1998:308). Trade relations imply
recognition of and adherence to the customs of trading partners in modern as well as
in ancient times. These customs may influence the future conduct and beliefs of the
new user.
During the Eighteenth Dynasty, mainly as a result of the expansive policies of
Thutmosis III, Egypt seemed to have played a dominant role in Canaan which
resulted in a number of cultural exchanges between the regions which probably still
prevailed during Iron II (Cornelius 2004:2: David 1999:127-128). This does not
signify that no cultural exchanges occurred at earlier stages during the Bronze Age.
As a result of the continuous contact between Egypt and the region over millennia,
cultural exchanges would have been unavoidable. Egyptian influences on the culture
and religion of the Canaanites and finally their descendants, the Phoenicians, would
play a significant role in the development of the religions and cultures of the region,



18
in particular if one keeps in mind the role the Phoenicians, as seafarers and
merchants, would play throughout the Mediterranean region during the Iron Age. It
follows that even in those areas where the Egyptians never had any direct influence,
their earlier influence on Phoenician culture would indirectly be passed on to other
nations within the Phoenicians’ field of influence.
During the latter part of the Eighteenth Dynasty, especially in the Amarna period,
Egypt’s direct political influence in the region started its decline, never to regain a
lasting foothold again. During this period (Amarna) most of the letters from the vassal
kings in Canaan beg for assistance, which requests were apparently ignored by
Akhenaten.
Akhenaten seems to have isolated him from state affairs, living contently with his
family at Akhetaten (Amarna) and practising his new monotheistic religion. This may
be the reason why Horemheb and the early Nineteenth Dynasty Pharaohs did
everything possible to remove every trace of the existence of Akhenaten and his
reign.
Horemheb, being a military commander, as well as the first Pharaoh of the Nineteenth
Dynasty, Ramses 1 (one of Horemheb’s co-commanders in the Egyptian army) and
his descendants Sethos 1, Ramses II and Merneptah did attempt to regain some of
Egypt’s former glory, but the attack of the Sea Peoples during the reign of both
Merneptah and Ramses III (although these two pharaohs claimed convincing
victories) seemed to have been the final turning point in the history of Egyptian
empire building.



19
This does not imply cultural exchanges in the form of trade relations and personal
contacts (maybe even politically) did not continue. It is clear, however, both from
Egyptian texts and the Bible, that, temporary military raids excluded, there was no
further political control by Egypt over the region.
Thus, throughout the further history of Egypt until the 26
10
th Dynasty some relations
between that country and the Palestine region, especially Judah in the south,
continued. There were further trade relations and the occasional military incursions by
the Egyptians. According to the texts, the last attempt of Egypt to interfere in
Palestinian affairs was during the 25th Dynasty when the pharaoh, Shebiktu, sent his
brother Tirhakah against the Assyrian forces of Sennacherib which had invaded Judah
of King Hezekiah, resulting in a defeat for Egypt. It is extremely doubtful that this
10
Military excursions by the Egyptians into the region continued throughout most of the New Kingdom e.g. Ahmosis, the founder of the Eighteenth Dynasty (also the first king of the New Kingdom), who drove the Hyksos back and expanded the Egyptian Empire to Palestine; the main expansionist being Thutmosis III; Sethos I who reasserted Egyptian authority in Syro-Palestine; his son Rameses II who, as a result of the treaty with the Hittites after the battle of Kadesh, maintained the Palestine holdings; Merenptah, famous for the Israel Stele; Rameses III, who repulsed the Sea Peoples. During the Third Intermediate Period Sheshonq I of the 22
In 2 Kings 23:29 and 2 Chronicles 35:20-24 the Bible relates the final confrontation between Egypt and Judah: ‘While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah marched out with his army to fight him, but King Neco killed him when they met at Megiddo’. The Pharaoh involved, according to the Hebrew Bible is Neco. In Egyptian sources he is Nekau II (610-595 B.C.E.), the son of Psamtek I, the founder of the Twentysixth Dynasty. This was, however, as stated in the Bible and Egyptian texts, clearly not an Egyptian invasion of Palestine, but an attempt by the Egyptians to assist the Assyrians against the Babylonians. King Josiah of Judah apparently regarded the Egyptians themselves as a threat to his country, for the Babylonians (after Isaiah’s warning to King Hezekiah in 2 Kings 20: 16-19), at the cost of his own life, attacked the Egyptians at Megiddo. Although, as a result of the defeat of Judah, Egypt laid claim to Assyria’s Palestinian possessions, her forces were soundly defeated by the Babylonians at Carchemish in 605 B.C.E. and all of Syria-Palestine fell to Babylon.
nd Dynasty [Shishak in the Hebrew Bible (1 Ki 14:25 and 2 Chr 12:2)], invaded Judah during the fifth year of King Rehoboam and subdued Judah as well as Israel. Sheshonq’s purpose was limited and definite: to gain political and commercial security by subduing his immediate neighbours. He made no attempt to revive the empire of Thutmosis III, Sethos I or Rameses II (Schipper 1999:119-132). Sheshonq’s son, Osorkon I attempted to emulate his father’s successes in Palestine, but his forces under the Ethiopian general Zerah were soundly defeated by the forces of King Asa of Judah c. 897 B.C.E. (2 Chr 14:9-15) (Schipper 1999:133-139). This defeat spelt the end of Egypt’s expansionist policy in Asia.



20
move was intended to assist the Judahites. It should rather be seen as a precautionary
measure to protect Egypt’s own borders against the Assyrian threat. 11
Thus, despite the decline of Egyptian political authority in the region, it seems that
throughout the Iron Age there was continuous contact between Egypt and Syro
Palestine, sometimes as enemies, sometimes as allies and sometimes as trade partners.
The stelae of Sheshonq I, Osorkon I and Osorkon II at Byblos (Marshall et al
1996:298) indicate that relations with Phoenicia were maintained. According to the
Bible, Israel’s last king, Hoshea, turned to Egypt for help against the Assyrians (2 Ki
17:4). If this is historically correct, it is a clear indicator of an existing alliance. This
request was, however, in vain and no help came to save Samaria from destruction.
Thus there is ample evidence, both textually and archaeologically of continuous
contact between Syro-Palestine and Egypt during the Bronze and Iron Ages. These
contacts as such, however, do not serve as proof that there were cultural exchanges
between Egypt and Syro-Palestine, in particular Israel and Judah. On the other hand
we know that during the Eighteenth Dynasty, especially during the time of Thutmosis
III, several Canaanite/Phoenician deities such as Baal, Astarte and Anath were
imported into the Egyptian pantheon.
The fact that the conquerors were prepared to accept gods of the conquered and made
them their own, makes it highly likely that the conquered would sometimes accept the
11 During the reign of Osorkon II, it seems an alliance with Israel existed as witnessed by the discovery in the palace of Omri and Ahab at Samaria of an alabaster vase of Osorkon II of a type which the pharaohs included in diplomatic gifts. It further suggests that relations existed between the House of Omri with Tyre as well as with Egypt.



21
gods of their conquerors on the principle that since the conquerors have won the war,
their gods must be stronger than those of the conquered.
The problem that this study intends to address is as follows: Did the continuous
contact and unavoidable cultural exchanges between Egypt and Palestine result in the
acceptance by Israel and Judah of Egyptian religious concepts during the period 900
587 B.C.E.( hereinafter referred to as Iron IIB and C) and if so, to what extent?
1.4 ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM
It seems that the root of the problems relating to establishing an Israelite/Judahite
religious history during Iron I and II lies in an overemphasis of the limited textual
material. These limited sources leave a lot of unanswered questions regarding the
development and form of religious beliefs and practises in the region during the
relevant periods. This situation has, unfortunately, prevailed during the last century or
two, without due regard to another important factor, the one of human frailty. Texts
are after all written by human beings with their own perspectives and subjective
approaches. As has been proven countless times in courts of law, an eyewitness report
is not necessarily factually correct in all aspects.
Human beings, as result of various factors, such as culture and religion, perceive
things in different ways and their rendition of facts are not always trustworthy.
Unanswered questions sometimes only signify that the wrong questions have been
asked or that the wrong or even inadequate avenues of investigation to find solutions
have been followed.
Relying purely on the Bible and Egyptian texts in order to deduce the Egyptian



22
presence and sphere of influence, especially in the religious context, in the region and
thus disregarding other, sometimes more convincing, evidence, would amount to an
unscientific approach interspersed with dangerous pitfalls.12
Our current knowledge of Egyptian religion, on the other hand, will go a long way in
understanding the role it played in Palestine if it can be proved that its symbolism, or
some of it, was adopted in the region during a period under investigation. In more
modern context, if one should find a wall painting of Christ on the cross in a
residence, it may be deduced with fair certainty that the residents, or some of them,
are followers of the Christian religion. Sometimes religious icons are collected for
other reasons without betraying the religious beliefs of the collector e.g. Buddha-.
Textual evidence, such
as ritual texts, e.g. the Pyramid texts and the Egyptian Book of the Dead, has
contributed tremendously to our understanding of Egyptian religion and religious
concepts. Ritual texts were also found in abundance in Syria and Mesopotamia. At
Ugarit literally hundreds of such texts were found from which a clear picture of the
religion of Ugarit emerges, but such extra-biblical sources are not available in the
context of Palestine (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:10). Lack of such textual evidence
(especially in the Egyptian context) with regard to the religion of the
Israelites/Judahites should, however, not be a deterrent in pursuing other avenues.
12 Keel and Uehlinger (1998:11) are outspoken in their statement that anyone who prefers to work exclusively with texts, such as those from Ugarit, Ebla, Mari or Meskene/Emar (without doubting the relevance of the texts), should get little or no hearing. Dever (2002:3-29) delivers a passionate plea for a commitment to history (in particular archaeology) and not theology in pursuing ancient Israelite history. On the other hand, Hoerth (1998:20), cautions, not without substantiation, that archaeological proof of historical facts does not necessarily imply proof of historical theology e.g. should it be archaeologically proven that king Solomon existed, it would not prove his relationship with God or that he received wisdom from God. It does not follow, however, that should a shrine to Baal be discovered in a house or palace, that the deduction should not be made that Baal was worshipped by the residents or at least some of them, but the nature and contents of the religion would probably remain a mystery without textual input.



23
statuettes for decorative purposes or altar pieces for its artistic or monetary and
investment value. The researcher should, therefore, be extremely careful in evaluating
such evidence not to be seduced into irrelevancy and erroneous conclusions. A lack of
textual evidence, it is submitted, leaves only one alternative avenue of pursuit and
that is the field of archaeology. The structural remains of temples or burial tombs, in
particular relating to burial practises, artefacts, such as figurines, altars shrines and
sacrificial remains enhance our knowledge and serve as more concrete proof of the
nature of religious practices. There are, however,
Is this then the end of the road in an endeavour to find a solution to the problem and
should one wait till more evidence is available? I submit not, for there is one avenue
to be pursued, which for the most part has been ignored or rejected by scholars and
that is pictorial evidence and especially seal iconography.
at this stage of our knowledge, not
an overwhelming number of such structures and obvious religious artifacts in
Palestine with Egyptian connotations which will enable us to reach irrefutable
conclusions.
1.5 PICTORIAL EVIDENCE
‘But when attempting to reconstruct the religious system (belief), we also reject
emphatically the view that it is adequate to limit oneself to working with texts.
Religious concepts are expressed not only in texts but can be given a pictorial form
on items found in the material culture as well’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:10; Cf. Keel
1992:XI-XIV; Becking 2006:56-57).
Keel & Uehlinger pursues this line of thought and states on pp. 304-305:



24
‘Unlike speech which is a human construct, graphic images share at least some
similarity with the reality they seek to portray. ...because the picture is closer to the
reality it depicts, it usually shows this reality as somewhat complex. Unlike language,
it is not limited to listing a few isolated aspects of what it shows. The power in the
image is in its ability to portray several aspects simultaneously...’ (Cf. Keel
1992:268).
Anyone who wants to reconstruct the religious symbol system of Canaan and Israel
accurately, and is not content with mere supposition, cannot avoid pictures. The way
a particular world appeared can be seen again and again by looking at its pictures and
some important aspects are detected only in such depictions.
‘It is a crass anachronism to continue to assert, as do some scholars who put no stock
in images, that pictures are meaningless decoration. The idea that pictures and their
production were important only if they measured up to some primarily or even
exclusively formal and aesthetic standard is a viewpoint that is no older than the
nineteenth century and is typical of the so-called “enlightened”, western civilisation.
Only modern western-thinking hold such a view. The majority of ancient Near
Eastern and ancient Egyptian sign systems are better described as “a valiant attempt
of magic and religion at co-existence” (Goldwasser/Laor 1991/50)’ (sic) (Keel &
Uehlinger 1998:394-395).
This does not imply that pictures should be used as evidence to the exclusion of other
and more in particular textual evidence. Pictures may relate to events that may be
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to identify if some textual evidence are not
available. The Lachish reliefs of Sennacherib at Nineveh and other similar Assyrian



25
reliefs reveal a lot of information about Assyrian methods of warfare and treatment of
prisoners, but without accompanying Assyrian textual evidence and to a lesser the
biblical text, it would be extremely difficult to place the particular event. The same
applies to the reliefs at Medinet Habu on the funerary temple of Rameses III,
depicting the attacks of the Sea Peoples.
Textual evidence is in many cases not a prerequisite to explain ideas depicted in
pictures, including religious concepts. A simple picture of a person in a worshipping
position with only the sun in front of him clearly conveys the idea that the sun is
regarded as a god. This picture may be complemented with various other objects to
present a more complex scenario. An altar and various votive accessories may signify
the way in which the worship was conducted, dress may denote the person as a priest,
an animal on the altar signifies blood sacrifice and in the end it may be possible to
wean comprehensive data from a single picture about the religion and religious
practises of the artist or the person(s) he wants to depict.
Monumental structures containing wall paintings, reliefs or some other form of
pictorial religious presentation for the relevant period, in contrast to Mesopotamia and
Egypt, are totally absent in Palestine, especially in the areas inhabited by the
Israelites/Judahites. Religious pictorial concepts are not, however, confined to the
more obvious forms of artistic expression such as reliefs and paintings.
In order to pursue a possible solution for the stated problem, I propose that the lack of
these larger forms of presentation not be regarded as an impediment. Evidence of
religious concepts abound in Palestine albeit not on a monumental scale: ‘Other
artifacts also provide information about Israelite religion: scarabs, scaraboids, seals



26
and bullae’ (Zevit 2001:343). In Palestine thousands of seals have been discovered,
by 1992; according to Keel & Uehlinger (1998:10) more than 8500 stamp seals from
the earliest times to the end of the Iron Age have been catalogued. Unfortunately the
seals from the region available for study dating to Iron IIB and C are extremely
limited, but I submit this limitation should not be regarded as a prohibition for a
thorough study. I further propose that the study of seals and in particular the
iconography of seals may provide a viable solution to the problem which forms the
subject of this study and this is the avenue that I will pursue. The Israelites/Judahites,
during the relevant period, did not use cylinder seals (papyrus and not clay tablets
were used as writing material) and this study is therefore confined to stamp seals and
more in particular scarabs and scaraboids. Although the vast majority of scarabs
discovered in Palestine are seal-amulets, there are also personal and official seals and
bullae involved, which depict Egyptian motifs and which may be indicators of the
adoption of Egyptian religious concepts on the highest levels in Israel and Judah,
including kings and other royal personalities.
1.6 SEALS: HISTORY IN MINIATURE
13
The discovery of several scarabs in Palestine from Iron II, which contain Egyptian
motifs, whether during archaeological excavations or on the market, bear witness to
cultural exchanges (whether the result of politics, commerce or personal contact) over
a long period in the region. These cultural exchanges appear to be either direct (with
13 An amulet has been defined as ‘a personal charm, often in the shape of an animal or animal-god, intended to procure the wearer certain benefits or to ward off evil spirits that might bring disease or bad luck. These could be simple clay objects or beautifully made bejewelled ornaments’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:319). It could be regarded as personal magical instruments, but amulets were also used as personal seals.



27
Egypt itself), especially in the southern parts, or indirect in the northern part (via
Phoenician sources).
Seals are arguably amongst the smallest works of art recovered from ancient times,
but their size does not lessen their importance as sources of information. Despite their
small dimensions, they have contributed to our understanding of ancient cultures and
they were known to most of the ancient cultures of the Near East. They were made of
lasting materials and were owned not only by the nobility but also by the general
public.
‘...as artificial traces of past civilisations, they provide evidence, both directly
through their distribution and indirectly through their imagery, for the ancient patterns
of conflict and influence between near and distant centres’ (Pittman 1995:1589).
At this stage it is important to raise a few cautionary notes. The main problem with
seals is that if they are not always found in context e.g. strata at excavations or dated
tombs, they may sometimes be difficult to be dated accurately. 14 A large number of
seals come to the attention of scholars via the antiquities market and not as a result of
excavations, thus the possibility of forgeries should be kept in mind. Seals are
normally dated by epigraphy: ‘...they are classified as Israelite, Judahite, Phoenician,
etc. by onomastic as well as epigraphic criteria. These criteria are often less precise
than one would wish... (thus) many seals can only be broadly dated to the eighth
seventh centuries, or labelled “Ammonite-Aramaic”, “Phoenician-Aramaic” etc.’
(Sass 1995:143).
14 Collon (1990b:24), justifiably, cautions that one should be careful in the use of seals for dating. Due to their small size they may roll from the top to the bottom down animal burrows or natural holes and appear, during excavations in older strata. Seals were also heirlooms and some of those discovered in tombs may, as a result of inheritance date from a period older than the context in which it was found.



28
Although one should always keep this uncertainty in mind, it should, in the context of
this study where a whole period is covered, not be too much of a stumbling block. ‘It
is not always easy to determine if seals are Israelite, Moabite, or Phoenician etc.’
(Zevit 2001: 345). The interpretation of the meaning of the symbolism may also cause
problems (Zevit 2001:344-345). This is particularly true regarding anepigraphic seals
if it is not possible to identify them contextually.
The materials used may be of some assistance, but similar materials could have been
used during a particular period by Judahites, Israelites, Phoenicians, Philistines or
other nations inhabiting the region. Stamp seals with Egyptian iconography have, for
instance, been found all over Philistia (Golden 2004:236). If anepigraphic seals are
found in context, it is therefore also important to have knowledge of the peoples
inhabiting those particular areas at particular points in time.
To illustrate this danger I want to use one example, the city of Dor on the
Mediterranean coast. According to Egyptian sources, in particular The Report of
Wenamun (Goedicke 1975:149), it was inhabited by the Sikil around 1100 B.C.E.
According to the Bible it was an important Israelite harbour during the reign of King
David and King Solomon and the time of the divided monarchy. King Solomon even
appointed his son-in-law, Ben-Abinadab, as district governor of Dor (1 Ki 4:11).
During the Assyrian rule it became an Assyrian province. Despite these references to
inter alia Sikil, Israelite and Assyrian presence, archaeology has revealed that the
material culture of Dor throughout those periods remained predominantly Canaanite/
Phoenician. Thus, an anepigraphic seal discovered at Dor in the context of the alleged



29
Israelite rule does not necessarily signify Israelite origin. It is far more probable that
its owner was a Phoenician.
On the other hand, despite the cautionary note above, most seals were only used for a
short time and were then discarded. Large quantities were found in rubbish pits,
especially in strata dating back to the third millennium. This short life of seals and the
fact that they were usually discarded during the same period in which they were used
may be of assistance to archaeologists in establishing their age.
The following question may be asked: ‘How can seals be of assistance in the
investigation of the religious history of the Israelites?’
‘Not only because of their sheer number, but also because of their importance, seal
amulets far outshine all other kinds of image-bearing artifacts in value, being even
more valuable than inscriptional evidence. Since they are preserved in relatively
comparable quantities for all periods, they can virtually serve as the standard by
which religious history is documented, particularly because they are more or less
public artifacts and can thus serve as a sensitive seismograph to detect subtle shifts in
religious history’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:10).
To this should be added that seals and in particular their inscriptions and/or
iconography (except for official purposes) have always been of a very personal and
subjective nature. For the most part they are custom made and designed to the
owner’s personal preferences. Iconography on seals could thus be very subjective
reflecting a person’s personal culture, level of education or belief system (Pittman
1995:1600).



30
Seals developed from amulets which were used as magical tokens to secure the
property of the owner. The shape (scarabs and scaraboids) of the vast majority of
seals discovered in Palestine is a definite indication of Egyptian influence from the
earliest times. The scarab beetle indigenous to Egypt, was venerated as a
representation of Ra. The beetle pushing the ball of dung (as a sun disk) personified
Ra’s journey through the skies. It was also a symbol of resurrection. The birth of a
new generation of beetles from the ball of dung, also personified Ra’s resurrection
every day after his nightly journey through the underworld (Pittman 1995:1601) (
There are two Hebrew words for seal and both are Egyptian loanwords. Korpel
(2006:353) regards this as an illustration of the Egyptian superiority in jewellery. I
suggest that it rather indicates that seals were first introduced amongst the Hebrews
by the Egyptians. Whether it is a leftover of the alleged stay of the Israelites in Egypt
or the result of cultural exchange between the Hebrews and the Egyptians during the
relevant periods is not really important, either way the Egyptian origin is the key
factor. The two words are ḥotam (feminine: ḥotemet) and ṭ abaʼat (Korpel
2006:353). Korpel also discusses the debate that ḥotam was either the word used for
cylinder seals or for seals in general, while ṭabaʼat was only used for stamp seals.
For purposes of this study, this debate is not relevant.
The fact that the iconography on many of these scarabs found in Syro-Palestine
(Phoenician, Israelite/Judahite, Philistine, Ammonite etcetera) in the context of Iron
IIB and C depicts Egyptian religious motifs and symbols enhances the impression of
cultural exchange and poses questions regarding the impact of Egyptian religious



31
symbolism on local religion. Were these symbols depicted on the seals purely for
decorative purposes?
There is, unfortunately, another problem in the study of these seals. Scholars like
Keel, Sass, Uehlinger, Avigad and others have started extensive research in order to
catalogue these seals and have made remarkable progress in this regard, but it is not
always an easy task.
15
‘There are serious difficulties in dealing with the Syro-Palestinian and related
Egyptian stamp seals of the Iron Age. No systematic classification of stamp forms
and designs at this time in Egypt or the Levant is available, due largely to a paucity of
firmly dated seals from well-published controlled excavations and to an
overabundance of unprovenienced seals in collections’ (Marcus 1996:39).
Despite the difficulties raised by Marcus, which in the interim (since 1996) have only
been fractionally solved by corpi published by scholars such as Othmar Keel,
Nahman Avigad, Benjamin Sass and others, I submit that enough material, is
available to attempt a study like the current one.
As an introduction the significance of these symbols may be illustrated by the
example of two seals, the seal of Jezebel, arguably the queen of Israel and the seal of
King Hezekiah, probably king of Judah. Thus one seal probably originated in the
northern Kingdom of Israel and the other in the southern Kingdom of Judah.
15
This example may illustrate that whoever is interested in the reconstruction of the religious history of first-millennium Syria and Palestine should certainly not disregard the potential of iconographic sources in general, and of Northwest Semitic inscribed seals in particular (Uehlinger 1993:277-279).
Consequently the dozens of inscribed and uninscribed Israelite seals and several of the Samaria ivories, which offer strong evidence for the prevalence of solar symbolism in Northern Israel during the eighth century B.C.E., attest to the existence of a general religious ‘ambience’ that clearly conditioned the religion and beliefs of many people among the Israelite elite. Many of the seal owners involved bear Yahwistic personal names and it is simply unthinkable that the state religion of Northern Kingdom of Israel, i.e. ‘official’ Yahwism, should not have been affected by this ‘ambiance’ and emphasis on solar symbolism (Cf. Uehlinger 2005:158-160).



32
1.6.1 The seal of Jezebel
Figure 1: Seal of Jezebel
(Korpel 2008a:33)
According to the biblical story (1 Ki 16:31), Jezebel was a Phoenician princess who
imported Phoenician religious concepts into Israel. The seal under discussion is the
subject of intensive debates, whether this Jezebel is indeed the biblical wife of Ahab.



33
For the current example the debate is ignored. At this stage it is only intended to
illustrate Egyptian symbolism in Phoenician/Israelite seal iconography during Iron
IIB and C. According to Avigad & Sass (1997:275) this seal dates to the late ninth
eighth-century. Of all the thousands of seals with Hebrew inscriptions this is one of
only thirty five that belonged to women. Of these ‘thousands’ of seals only a small
number of the published seals are epigraphic, the main reason apparently being that
epigraphic seals first made their appearance in Israel and Judah during the eighth
century B.C.E.
a. Description
It is a scaraboid (the common shape during the divided monarchy), made of gray
quartz and with dimensions of 30 x 22 x 10 mm, it is larger than normal seals
(average approximately 17 x 12 x 9 mm) of the period. It is perforated with a single
line border and with a solid field divider separating the top register from the bottom
one.
In the top register is a recumbent, winged sphinx on ground line holding an ankh
between his forelegs. The sphinx has, what appears to be a Hathor headdress on its
head and protruding from it is an object that looks a bit like a uraeus. A study of the
various uraei on the headdresses of Egyptian pharaohs, however, reveals that this
preliminary impression is not correct. A uraeus is depicting a cobra with its front part
upright in an attacking position ready to bite or spit, and it does not vary much when
it is used in different ways.



34
Figure 2: Object on head of sphinx Figure 3: Ureaus on dead mask of
Tutankhamen Egyptian Museum.

.
The shape of an ureaus on an Egyptian royal crown resembles an S, with two curves
along the body of the snake (see also the uraei portrayed in the bottom register of this
particular seal, where this shape is clearly defined).
The object on the relevant sphinx has no S-shape, but is nearly straight resembling a
phallic symbol. Another possibility is that the object is the feather of Ma’at as
portrayed in Egyptian hieroglyphs. The fact that the object has a straight shape with
the top section leaning a bit towards the front and the fact that it appears to protrude
from a headband gives the impression that it is indeed the Ma’at feather that is
portrayed.



35
Figure 4: Hieroglyph of Ma’at’s feather from Luxor
(Pirard 2007)
Another more probable explanation is that the object represents the double crown of
Egypt, albeit in very stylized form. If one compares the object with the double crowns
on other seals (especially Phoenician seals) (see Figures 18, 21 and 28 on pages132,
139 and 152 respectively), it seems highly probable.
Immediately below the field divider is a winged disk stretching over the width of the.
seal and it represents Ra.
16
16 Some scholars such as Korpel (2008:36) suggest that the sphinx is wearing an Hathor/Isis crown thus denoting a royal woman, without explanation or clarification. If they identify the feather as a cow horn of Hathor, I cannot agree. I submit that the double crown is portrayed, which clearly signifies a royal seal. In Egyptian symbolism only the king wears the double crown. I contend that this interpretation should go a long way in solving the riddle. The double crown represents a royal presence, thus the seal belonged to a royal personality, and I finally contend that it favours a queen, most probably Jezebel of Israel with her Phoenician origins. See also the discussion in paragraph 6.2.1 below.



36
Central to the bottom register is a bird in the form of an Egyptian falcon with a flail
at its back. On either side of the falcon is a uraeus, an ornamental serpent, most
commonly seen on the headdresses of Egyptian royalty and gods, and representing
the goddess Wadjet. At the bottom is a lotus flower.
b. Preliminary discussion of symbols
It is significant that this particular seal has as its first symbol in the top register a
winged sphinx (more popular in Phoenicia than in Egypt) with a human head and
body of a lioness. It is also significant that the winged sphinx is the only identifiable
Phoenician symbol on the seal, thus denoting a Phoenician connotation. The fact that
the sphinx wears a double crown signifies royalty.
In front of the sphinx is the ankh, the Egyptian symbol of life or eternal life. The
ankh, therefore, could have signified an afterlife totally removed from the Israelite
idea of life after death (the concept of Sheol) or just represented ‘life’ itself.
The winged sun disk, stretching over the width of the seal as a guardian, represents
Ra, the oldest and one of the greatest of the Egyptian gods; he created the elements to
sustain life on earth. On his daily journey through the sky he gives light and life. At
night he dies and travels through the realm of the death (Duat), to be resurrected again
in the morning, thus, as already stated, he also represents resurrection, a concept that
at that time did not exist in the official religion of the Israelites. It is possible that the
concept of resurrection was imported from Egypt into the unofficial religious
17
17 The Egyptian religious symbols and concepts (including the gods) and their meaning to the Egyptians are discussed as fully as possible in context in the text of this study. More information is contained in ANNEXURE B.



37
principles of various Israelites by using such symbols as the winged sun disk, the
lotus flower and Harpocrates (the Sun Child).
The falcon also represents royalty as the falcon has since earliest times represented
Horus, who was the protector of kings and during the Hellenic and Roman periods
became the main god of Egypt. What is interesting is the flail behind the falcon. The
fertility god Min was normally depicted with a flail in his right hand behind his back
denoting the harvest and thus fertility (Kemp 1991:85).
The uraei flanking the falcon and representing Wadjet had been a symbol of kingship
in Lower Egypt since the earliest history of Egypt. The lotus flower at the bottom was
the symbol for Upper Egypt and also represented regeneration, a typical female
symbol, usually connected to royal women.
The falcon Horus with a flail
at its back is, however, not an uncommon depiction, thus denoting authority as on this
seal.
These conclusions and those in sub subparagraph 1.6.2 are only preliminary. Final
conclusions will be discussed in Chapter 6, where Hebrew seals are dealt with.
c. Inscription
Interspersed between the symbols are the letters YZBL. It should be noted that all
inscriptions on Hebrew seals discussed in this study was written in the Ancient
Hebrew script (between 3200 and 2500 years ago) (Cf. Brenner 2005:8). For purposes
of this study, these inscriptions are rendered in Classical Hebrew, adopted after the
Babylonian exile.

(Cross 1999:42)



39
a. Introduction
During the latter part of the twentieth century a bulla of the seal of a Hebrew king
came to light for the first time: The seal of 'Ahaz, king of Judah from about 734 to
715 B.C.E., had been pressed into a small bit of clay that once sealed a papyrus roll. It
is not clear when it was discovered and where it was found. The seal, an iconic seal,
inscribed in Old Hebrew letters, reads: /• • / • , l'hz y/hwtm mlk
/yhdh ‘Belonging to 'Ahaz (son of) Yehotam, King of Judah’ (Cross 1999:42).
A few years later two bullae of a seal belonging to 'Ahaz's son, the Judahite king,
Hezekiah, came to light. They differ from the seal of Ahaz in that they contain both
an inscription and iconography. The first one is severely damaged and nearly
illegible. Without the discovery of the second one it would have been nearly
impossible to decipher the first one, but now the two complement each other.
b. Description
It depicts a two-winged scarab pushing a ball of dung or possibly the sun with the
inscription: /• • • , lhzqyhw 'hdz mlk/ yhdh, ‘belonging to
Hezekiah, (son of) 'Ahaz, king of Judah’.
Without the original seal it is not possible to give a better description of the seal. The
seal impression in the clay indicates that it probably was a scaraboid, but without
further detail, the shape cannot be established with certainty. It is, therefore, not
possible to see any further detail such as the type of border, whether it had more than
one register or whether it contained more symbols.



40
c. Discussion
Regarding the identifiable symbol on this seal, Cross (1999:42-43) argues as follows:
‘The dung beetle pushes the circular ball of dung, which symbolizes the movement of
the rising sun. The meaning of the symbol is clear from Malachi 4:2: "For you who
revere my Name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with healing in its wings." In
other words, the winged sun disk is a symbol of the deity. Two- and four-winged sun
disks also appear on Hezekiah’s l’melekh handles, so the two-winged scarab with the
sun disk is wholly appropriate on Hezekiah’s seal. There appears to have been a
tendency to solarize Yahweh in Judah in the eighth century and later.’
This argument of Cross may be true, but the question remains: Where did the idea of
using the scarab as a symbol of the sun or the sun god originate? The answer is very
simple: Egypt. The seal associated above all with Egypt is the scarab, for it is a tri
dimensional reproduction of the dung beetle, scarabaeus sacer, with its natural
habitat in the low desert (Pittman 1995:1601). The vast majority of seals found in
Palestine are scarabs and scaraboids. During Iron Age II scaraboids were mainly used
in the areas administered by Israel and Judah. The form of the seal used is the first
indicator of Egyptian influence in Palestine.
Four-winged scarab beetles are well documented on Hebrew and West Semitic seals
and seal impressions (Avigad & Sass 1997: 59, 163, 475, 775, 832, 837, 987). On the
other hand, according to Tushingham (1992:61-65), it seems that the four-winged
scarabs were preferred by the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the two-winged scarab
(as in the seal under discussion) was preferred by the Southern Kingdom of Judah.
Laughlin (2000:147) argues that the royal house of Judah probably used both the two



41
winged and the four-winged scarabs as insignia on jar handles, because seals or bullae
of four-winged scarabs and four-winged sun disks have been found at sites which
belonged to ancient Judah. He fails however to distinguish between the scarabs and
the sun disks and treats them as if they were the same. I agree with Fox (2000:221)
that at this stage the evidence is too scant to come to any definite conclusions in this
regard.
The Egyptians observed every form of life and developed a special feeling for the
scarab. It was linked to Ra, the sun god and became the symbol of resurrection. The
female rolls a ball of dung and then lays her eggs in it, which she then rolls in front of
her. To the Egyptians this was the same process as that of Ra rolling the sun’s disk
across the sky (Galling 1941:145). Furthermore the scarab’s young emerged from this
ball, in a manner similar to the god’s own creation of life.
Thus the scarab was regarded as very sacred. Millions of scarab seals and amulets
were produced by the Egyptians and other nations under its influence, especially the
peoples of the Levant. All were inscribed with a charm or marked with the cartouche
of a king or a god. It was pierced to wear around the neck or was mounted on a ring
(Geddes & Grosset 1997:438). The scarab, whether in its tri-dimensional form as a
seal, seal-amulet, statuette or as a statue as well as when it was depicted pictorially,
was therefore an important Egyptian religious symbol. 18
18 During the Middle Kingdom in Egypt and later, thus also during the reign of King Hezekiah in Judah, Ra was associated with Amun and became known as Amun-Ra, who was associated with the sun which became an object of worship.



42
Hezekiah (c. 715-687) was the 13th king of independent Judah and the son of King
Ahaz and Abijah. The Bible refers to him in 2 Kings 18-20, Isaiah 36-39, and 2
Chronicles 29-32.
In the Bible he is portrayed as a great and good king and did what was pleasing in the
eyes of the Lord. He introduced religious reforms and reinstated religious traditions.
He set himself to abolish idolatry from his kingdom and among other things which he
did for this end, he knocked down the asherah poles and destroyed the bronze serpent,
Nehustan, which Moses had made.
Why then would this pious king and religious reformer use a sacred Egyptian
religious symbol on his royal seal? If the argument of Cross is correct that Yahweh
was solarised, it follows that by using a symbol of Ra, Yahweh was identified with
Ra, or (the least negative scenario) that a symbol of Ra was used to identify Yahweh
or an aspect of Yahweh. It still signifies that there were Egyptian influences even on
the highest level in the religion of Judah. Even the great Judahite prophet and adviser
to Hezekiah, the first Isaiah, the propagator of Yahweh as the First and Last, the
universal God (Mills 1998:64), seemed to have at least tolerated Hezekiah’s
appropriation of an Egyptian religious symbol. Should Cross be wrong in his
contention that it was Yahweh depicted as the sun god, the plot thickens, for the only
logical conclusion would then be that the scarab on the seal represents Ra himself
creating a scenario irreconcilable with the biblical portrayal of King Hezekiah. The
winged scarab was clearly the official symbol of the royal household as can be seen
on the seal of Manasseh discussed hereinafter (see paragraph 6.2.4 on pp.188-190).

1.7 CONCLUSION
In this chapter the continuous contact over millennia between Egypt and the
Canaanite region, sometimes as friendly commercial partners and sometimes as a
result of invasion and warfare was emphasised. It is argued that it is highly
improbable that such continuous contact would not result in cultural exchanges,
including the adoption of religious concepts.
The question was posed whether the continuous contact and unavoidable cultural
exchanges between Egypt and Palestine resulted in the acceptance by Israel and Judah
of Egyptian religious concepts during Iron IIB and C and if so, to what extent?
In order to answer this question, the Bible, supposedly reflecting the religion of Israel
and Judah would not be of much assistance, the main reason being that the Bible was
apparently mostly written after this period and tends to reflect an idealised pure
Yahwistic religion. Furthermore the Bible tends to concentrate on the religion of the
Canaanites, with whom the Israelites had the closest contact, as posing a threat to the
Israelite religion.
One way of enhancing our knowledge about cultural exchanges between Egypt, on
the one hand and Israel and Judah on the other during the relevant period, could lie in
an analysis of the iconography of contemporary seals discovered in the areas where
those two kingdoms were situated. In museums and private collections all over the
world are large quantities of seals with pictures, which contain inter alia inscriptions
of the names of the owners of the seals in Phoenician, Aramaic or Hebrew (Galling
1941:9). What Galling failed to mention is the fact that epigraphic and anepigraphic
seals were also found which contain Egyptian religious symbols and Hebrew



44
inscriptions. Most of these seals (the anepigraphic seals), however, date to the Bronze
Period and although they may be indicative of cultural exchanges between Egypt and
the Canaanite region at an early stage, it does not necessarily point to Egyptian
symbolism being employed in a religious manner in Israel and Judah during later
periods such as Iron II.
In defining the purpose of this current study it was contended that the purpose of the
iconography could not have been purely decorative and had to have some meaning.
If religious symbols are portrayed, those symbols probably had a religious meaning.
An analysis of the Egyptian religious iconography on these seals may contribute to
our knowledge of the religion of Israel and Judah during the time of the Divided
Monarchy and in particular during Iron IIB and C. The purpose of this study in
particular was confined to the implications of Egyptian religious symbols on seals
from Israel and Judah during the relevant period.
By analysing these symbols one finds that most of the major gods of the Egyptians
such as Ra, Osiris, Isis, Seth, Ptah, Bes, Sakhmet, Horus, Hathor, Thoth and Ma’at as
well as other Egyptian religious symbols are represented on seals discovered in the
context of Iron IIB and C (or which could be dated to that period) in Palestine. Since
seals were very personal items, I contend and that is the purpose of this study, that
this seal iconography was done not for decorative purposes but to represent the
beliefs of the individuals concerned. This argument is further enhanced by the fact
that a large proportion of these seals/amulets, especially anepigraphic seals, as
revealed by a perusal of corpi such as Keel (1997) were found in tombs in Palestine.



45
Not only were they regarded as having an influence on the daily lives of the living
person, but they accompanied the deceased on his journey to another existence. It is
incomprehensible that in an era where concepts such as magic, religion, society and
government were much closer interrelated than in modern times, people adhering to
one particular religion, would wear amulets or use seals with the iconography of the
religious symbols of a foreign religion purely for decorative purposes.
‘The so-called minor arts for instance, such as seals, amulets...could be called in to
tell a much more nuanced and complicated story of their own about values and
beliefs, cultural contact and changing orientations in the history of ancient Israel,
Judah and their neighbours’ (Uehlinger 2007:192).
Having discussed, by means of introduction, the importance of seal iconography and
the depiction of Egyptian symbols (including religious symbols) on Hebrew seals, it
is important to investigate and compare the recent conclusions of scholars on the
subject.

CHAPTER 2
REVIEW OF RECENT LITERATURE
2.1 INTRODUCTION
Literally thousands of scholarly works have been published about the religions of
Israel and Judah as well as that of Egypt. One finds the same scenario regarding the
archaeology of Egypt and Palestine and in particular articles about seals. In view of
the multitude of seals (which are unfortunately for the most part unpublished),
relating to Iron IIB and C, discovered in or in context of Phoenicia and Palestine,
containing Egyptian symbols, it is amazing that so little written material, linking
those seals with the religion of Israel and Judah, is available.19
A perusal of the studies regarding the pre-exilic religion of the two kingdoms reveals
a lot of emphasis being placed on texts enhanced by archaeological material such as
This is even more
incomprehensible if one keeps in mind that as far back as 1886, de Vogüé
investigated the meaning of the personal names and the possible religious
significance of the figurative designs on Northwest Semitic seals. Of special
significance to him were the abundance of Phoenician seals with Egyptian religious
symbols which demonstrated a strong Egyptian influence on the Phoenician religion
(Sass & Uehlinger 1993:XII). These two authors blame this neglect on the emphasis
placed at the time on the philology of seals rather than the iconography.
19 Zevit (2001:344) states: ‘Although catalogues of scarabs from excavations do exist, their study along the lines described above (i.e. in regard to religious connotations) are (sic) only beginning.’



47
temples, shrines, altars, figurines, statuettes and other more obvious instruments of
religion.
Another factor seems to be a lack of serious consideration of the religious
implications of the relevant iconography on seals with Israelite or Jewish names,
which have been found in Palestine and on which are often carved symbols of various
kinds. According to Albright (1968:67) there are:
‘a lion, a young bull..., a griffin with the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, a four
winged cobra (also Egyptian), as well as more complex scenes, sometimes drawn
from non-Israelite mythology or cult. Among miscellaneous symbols may be
mentioned palmettes, winged, solar discs, winged rolls, either with two or four wings,
four-winged scarabs, etc. To what extent these representations possessed religious
significance is very obscure; the writer tends to reject such meaning in the majority of
cases, on the analogy of Phoenician art as well as of synagogal Jewish art in the
Roman-Byzantine period, but there must be a residue of cases where we are dealing
with authentic religious symbolism.’
Thus the ‘father’ of Biblical Archaeology, without a real scientific analysis, except
for superficial comparisons with other scenarios, was of the opinion that in the
majority of cases, these seals had no religious connotation. Since the days of Albright,
however, a multitude of similar seals, mostly anepigraphic and in context of the
Bronze Age, but some in context of Iron Age II, were discovered, including (in my
opinion) extremely significant finds, such as the seal of King Hezekiah.
An important factor regarding seals that some of the scholars seem to ignore and
which leads to a laisser-faire attitude towards it, is that seals were regarded by ancient



48
peoples not only as purely functional in their role as seals for sealing documents or
establishing ownership or origin, viz wine flasks, but also as amulets or ‘good luck’
charms to safeguard them against evil forces during their lifetimes.20
It is, therefore, important to look at the more recent, but limited, attitudes and
approaches by scholars regarding the relationship between seal iconography and
religion, in particular the Egyptian iconography on seals from Israel and Judah during
Iron IIB and C especially in view of the biblical prohibitions of graven images. It
seems clear that amulets were worn by the Israelites, despite the dire warnings
contained in texts such as Isaiah 3:3 and 3:18-23 and Proverbs 17:8.
This also led to
seal amulets accompanying a deceased person as part of the grave goods to the
afterlife to assist (with its magical powers) to ward off evil forces and other potential
enemies in the next world.
2.2. ZIONY ZEVIT
Zevit (2001:343-346) in a very brief discussion of the subject, acknowledges that in
the Israelite Iron Age artifacts such as scarabs, scaraboids, seals and bullae provide
information about Israelite religion. Seals were apparently not used exclusively for
identification purposes, as it seems their main function was in Egypt. The copying of
Egyptian motifs and hieroglyphs in Israel and Judah may have been for religious
purposes, although there are no indications that they had any cultic status in the
20 Thus Avigad (1997:45-46) refers to the iconography on Hebrew seals as merely ‘figurative’ or ‘decorative motifs’, derived ‘mostly from Phoenician art, which overwhelmingly utilized Egyptianizing themes. Two main figurative motifs adopted on Hebrew seals are the scarab and the uraeus.’ Avigad, however, fails to express an opinion as regards the reason for using these motifs or other similar Egyptian motifs.



49
region.
This scholar readily admits that the study of seals in this regard (as religious symbols)
is still in its infancy. He alleges that Egyptian seals found at Israelite Iron Age sites
reveal a ‘remarkable restricted repertoire of gods and icons: Isis and the infant
Horus―Sakhmet or Bastet—Bes―Ptah―and the divine eye, Udjet’. It seems that he
has not studied the catalogues himself and that he for, the most part, relies on the
study of Herrmann (1993). Zevit’s allegation is not correct, as will appear from this
study. All the major gods are represented, whether universal or local, as well as
various other Egyptian symbols, religious or secular.
21
22
Zevit, however, readily admits the importance of motifs on Israelite seals: ‘Seals and
bullae bearing inscriptions and/or iconic motifs offer more direct insight into Israelite
religion---from their placement in tombs, it may be assumed that they had some
meaning in burial ceremonies and may reflect beliefs about death, burial and
afterdeath’ (Zevit 2001:344).
Zevit expresses the opinion
that the designs, although of Egyptian origin, may be indicative of the personal
preferences of the Israelites who bought them.
21 The author argues that seals apparently did not have cultic status because they do not appear as votives or in combination with other cultic artifacts. On the other hand he points out that seals were sometimes used as grave goods and may therefore have formed part of Israelite conceptions of the afterlife. He also concludes that the use of Egyptian gods as motifs on Israelite seals indicate a religious connotation. ‘---the Egyptian god Bes was worshipped by Judahites during the divided monarchy---representative deities from Egyptian cults were not overlooked in Israelite piety’ (Zevit 2001:606). Although the author does not state so explicitly, it seems as if he also extend this worship of Bes to other Egyptian gods such as Horus, Isis, Sakhmet and Ptah (Zevit 2001:606).
22At this stage it may be relevant to mention some of the gods who are actually represented and not included in the repertoire of Zevit: Ra, the adult Horus, Amun, Ma’at, Hathor, Osiris, Mut , Min, Khonsu, Anubis, Sebek, Seth, Thoth, Aten, Apis, Taweret, Nekhabet and Wadjet.



50
In view of a study by Sass (1993), Zevit (345) avers that Egyptian motifs, which had
been predominant during Iron I, were replaced with other motifs during Iron II and
that ‘the East Semitic influence replaced the Egyptian one prominent in Iron I’. It is
correct that a greater variety of motifs are to be found during the eighth and the
seventh centuries, but this can be easily ascribed to the prevalent political situation in
the region with Mesopotamian and even Greek influences. On the contrary, it seems
(as will be indicated in more detail later in Chapter 6) that It does not follow that the
Egyptian symbols were completely replaced by others. Egyptian symbols still played
a major role in Israel and Judahite iconography during the relevant period. Zevit’s
conclusion in this regard does not fit the iconographic profile of the period.
Zevit also seems to at least partially grasp the religious meaning of the Egyptian
symbolism. 23 He regards the Isis/Horus symbols as representative of the faithful wife
and mother, the protector of children; Sakhmet/Bastet as the friend of the faithful to
the gods and the enemy to their enemies; Bes as protector24 and Ptah, as the creator of
the world by act of mind expressed in words.25
23 His interpretation of the religious connotations that should be given to the Egyptian symbols, although basically correct, is extremely superficial in view of the development of Egyptian religion during the Middle and New Kingdoms. The Isis/Horus representation, which apparently served as a role model for the symbol of the Madonna/Christ child of Christianity, for instance, had a much deeper religious connotation as a mere mother and child depiction.
24
‘In Egypt the Bes image was used to represent many different deities, including Bes, Aha, Hayet, Soped, Tettenu and is associated at various times with Amun, Horus and even Baal. When the Bess figure was borrowed by Egypt’s northern neighbours, it was apparently perceived as an icon representing divinity---which—could be filled with meaning and manipulated according to local tradition. It was a pictographic god symbol and not necessarily the representation of any given deity.’
Zevit (2001:388-389) points out that approximately 146 seals form Palestine contain the Bes image in a variety of forms and shapes.
25 ‘This concept of creation can of course be reconciled with the story of creation contained in the Hebrew Bible and would have been acceptable to the minds of the Israelites. This image could have been a substitute for the lack of an image of Yahweh. This could also have been the position of Bes in Israelite seal iconography’ (Zevit 2001:388).



51
He also states: ‘These figures in Israelite comprehension and interpretation comprised
a sort of insurance against various ills that could befall the living’ (Zevit 2001:344).
2.3 WILLIAM G. DEVER
Dever (2005:51-59) criticises the lack of illustrations in many studies on Israelite
religion and emphasise the fact that many major works on the subject have not even
one illustration. According to him (I agree with his submission) these lacks of
illustrations reflect the preoccupation of philologically trained biblical scholars with
words rather than things, with ‘theological formulations rather than the symbols that
for most people represented the reality of religious beliefs and practises. A picture
really is “worth a thousand words”’ (Dever 2005:52).
He regards the direction taken by Othmar Keel (see next sub subparagraph) and
colleagues from what he calls the ‘ Freibourg’ (sic) school in Switzerland, as a
‘refreshing exception to the myopia of most biblical scholars’ (Dever 2005:52). He
states that this school has used art history to document ancient Near Eastern
iconography, in particular how the gods and the worship of such gods are depicted in
representative art in order to place ancient Israelite religion in a larger context, thus
deviating from the strict biblical representation of such religion. The fundamental
aspect here is the ‘symbol’. He then defines a symbol (see the next chapter) ‘as being
something to represent and typify a larger reality; usually it is an object or a pictorial
image’ (Dever 2005:52).



52
2.4 OTHMAR KEEL & CHRISTOPH UEHLINGER
During the past few decades the ‘Freiburg School’ of biblical scholars have played a
leading role in an attempt to rectify the negation by biblical scholars of the
importance of symbolism in religion, especially the religion of the Israelites. Taking
the lead in this regard has been Othmar Keel who has written several scholarly works
on the subject. A significant work in this regard is Göttinnen, Götter und
Gottessymbole by Keel and Christoph Uehlinger, published in 1992, with an English
translation by T H Trapp Gods, Goddesses and Images of God in Ancient Israel (Cf.
Keel [1992]; Uehlinger 1993:72-88).
The starting point in this work is the authors’ quote of Manfred Weippert:: ”’One
ought not ... to confuse the minority opinion express in the religious literature
preserved in the Old Testament with the historic religion in Israel in the preexilic
period” (M. Weippert 1990, 151)”’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:3). In order to
reconstruct the religious history of Israel/Judah during the Iron Age, primary sources
of information, not provided by the Bible, are required and these sources can only be
provided by archaeological discoveries.
The authors referred to the works of several scholars who analysed archaeological
evidence to reconstruct the development of the religious history of Palestine/Israel
during the Pre-exilic Period. ‘A shortcoming that these studies have in common is
their lack of attention to one of the most important artifacts for Canaanite-Israelite
religious history, the seal amulet’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:4). They emphatically
reject the view that it is adequate to limit one to texts in order to reconstruct a
religious system.



53
The authors emphasise the value of symbolism where a single picture can convey
more reality than a lot of words and transverse language barriers. Speech is a human
construct and thus limited in its application.
‘The power of the image is in its ability to portray several aspects simultaneously; to
put it another way: it represents the complexity of the reality that is portrayed in the
pictorial constellation---It is a crass anachronism to continue to assert, as do those
scholars who put no stock in images, that pictures are meaningless decoration’ (Keel
& Uehlinger 1998:394-395).
In reconstructing the religious symbol system of Canaan and Israel accurately,
pictures cannot be avoided. In relying on words, the reconstruction of the religion of
Palestine has mainly been based on the Bible and the texts of Ugarit. The distances
between Ugarit and Palestine and the time span between the texts of Ugarit (ca 12th
Century B.C.E.) and Israel/Judah during Iron IIB make the use of those texts to
interpret symbolism of Israel and Judah in the 9th or 7th
The problem with biblical texts is that they were copied, adapted and purged over the
centuries thus rendering them unreliable as a source to interpret symbolism of a
specified period. The result is that reconstructions of the symbol systems of Palestine
in various periods based on the texts from Ugarit and the Bible are largely conjectural
and proposed solutions have imaginatively been filled in with evidence from various
times and places ‘arranged like pieces of a mosaic’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:396).
Centuries B.C.E. extremely
problematic.



54
In view of the quantity of available seals, in particular of stamp seals of which more
than 8500 have been catalogued, seals, according to the authors ‘can virtually serve as
the standard by which religious history is documented’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:10).
The authors, although concentrating to a large extent on the iconography of seals, also
use various other artifacts such as figurines, cultic stands, jewellery and ivory
decorations on pieces of furniture, then proceed to make a survey of the religious
history of Israel/Palestine starting with MB IIB and ending with the Persian Period.
They, however, rank seal amulets as the most important images, some even have
inscriptions as additional aids. With their number, continuity and somewhat public
nature, they carry special weight, but have been grossly neglected by biblical
scholars.
26
It is also pointed out that in Palestine during Iron IIB and C, thus the period of Israel
and Judah, there was a great fascination with Egypt and its symbol system. ‘This
system was assimilated selectively, with royal and solar symbols especially being the
motifs of choice’ (Keel and Uehlinger 1998:402).
They admit that at the end of their survey, there are more open questions than
answers, but a look at the pictorial evidence gives the viewer a ‘more textured
awareness of the religio-historical development of Palestine/Judah than an approach
that relies on texts alone`(Keel and Uehlinger 1998:402).
My only problem with the approach of Keel and Uehlinger is that one should be
26 It should be noted that the authors refer to the period from the Babylonian invasion and more in particular the conquest of Jerusalem (ca. 587) to the time of Nehemiah (ca. 450) as Iron III. I regard the same period as overlapping the Babylonian and Persian periods (ca 587 to 332 B.C.E.). The present study, being confined to Iron IIB and C thus ends at ca. 587.



55
careful not to overemphasise the value of pictorial symbolism to the detriment of
textual evidence. As previously stated (see p 25) the pictorial evidence of the Lachish
and Medinet Habu reliefs for instance would be of far lesser value if not accompanied
by textual evidence.
Despite this limited criticism these two authors have contributed a lot to our current
understanding of iconography in Israel and Judah during Iron II.
2.5 AMIHAI MAZAR
Mazar (1992) only refers to seals and their iconography in a very sketchy manner. He
refers to engraved Hebrew seals from the eighth and seventh centuries B.C.E. and
states that they are:
‘the most important source of our knowledge of art and iconography in Israel and
Judah. The themes were inspired mainly by Phoenician art, and thus indirectly from
Egyptian traditions, but these foreign symbols were probably employed only as
decoration without any religious significance.’
Mazar is an archaeologist of vast experience who has made valuable contributions in
the field. It is a pity that with vague and unmotivated statements like this one he
merely reflects the opinion of Albright, expressed decades earlier and does not
contribute to a serious study of the subject. Albright, despite his well deserved
reputation in the field of Biblical Archaeology, appeared to be very subjective in his
interpretation of some of the finds in Palestine. It seems that his main agenda was to
use archaeology to prove the truth of the Bible and this, unfortunately leads to a loss
of objectivity. Again Mazar seems to ignore the significance of seals as amulets.



56
Albright, at least, was prepared to admit that the iconography on some of the seals
could have had a religious connotation, a possibility that Mazar apparently does not
seem prepared to admit.
2.6 IZAK CORNELIUS
Cornelius has investigated various specialised aspects of Near Eastern iconography as
reflected inter alia in his thorough and excellent studies: The iconography of the
Canaanite gods Reshef and Ba ʗal: late Bronze and Iron Age I periods (c 1500-1000
B.C.E.) (1994) and The many faces of the goddess: the iconography of the Syro
Palestinian goddesses Anat, Astarte, Qedeshet, and Asherah c. 1500-1000 B.C.E.
Recently (2008) he wrote an article: Religious iconography of Israel and Judah ca.
(2004). He clearly understands the significance of iconography and its symbolism and
advocates is importance. Unfortunately, for purposes of this study, these studies
pertain to the Late Bronze and Iron I periods.
1200-587 B.C.E., in which he deals with religious iconography in general during Iron
II in Israel and Judah. He states regarding Iron IIB, that the
‘period starts with the aftermath of the invasion of the Egyptian pharaoh Sheshonq
(Shishak) in 925 ... and ends with the fall of Samaria in 722 or perhaps in 720. This
is the time of the real state of Israel with its capital Samaria in the north and that of
Judah with its capital Jerusalem in the south. The north was influenced by Aramaic
and Phoenician ideas and Judah more by Egypt’ (Cornelius 2008:105).
Cornelius, therefore, acknowledges the influences of Phoenicia and Egypt on Israel
and Judah respectively. Unfortunately he does not deal with these influences in detail,



57
especially with regard to Egypt. He mentions that seal-amulets from Iron IIB depict
winged serpents (uraei) and winged suns. The winged ureaus apparently made its
appearance in Israel during the eighth century and later in Judah. The uraei from
Israel had two wings and those from Judah four wings. The winged sun originated in
Egypt but was also found in Phoenicia (Cornelius 2008:107). It is relevant that
Cornelius mentions both Egyptian and Phoenician influences. I will argue in Chapter
5 that Egypt had a religious impact on Phoenicia; the least being that the Phoenicians
used Egyptian religious symbols to depict aspects of their own religion.
As regards Iron IIC (Judah alone after the fall of Samaria), Cornelius does not deal
with Egyptian influences in any detail and merely states that the ‘Egyptian
“Renaissance” of the Saite dynasty and its influence is shown by scarabs depicting
traditional Egyptian deities’ (Cornelius 2008:111).
Although Cornelius acknowledges the Egyptian influences and the use of Egyptian
symbols in the iconography of Israel and Judah, he does not deal with the religious
implications of such symbols and why they were used. He admits that during the
Bronze Age and Iron I religious exchanges between Egypt and Canaan were common
and that gods such as Hathor, Bes, Horus, Ptah and even Amun and Ra were
introduced into the Levant (Cornelius 1994:1-2).
He also contends that ‘the religion of Israel and Judah was not monotheistic, but
consisted of different religions that themselves formed part of a complex system with
a complex historical development sources’ (Cornelius 2008:97). Furthermore in all
periods the seal-amulets, especially stamp-seals and scarabs were of ‘great
importance’ as ‘iconographic media’ in the search to establish the nature of the



58
Israelite religion (Cornelius 2008:97-99). From the contents of the 2008-article it
seems as if Cornelius is also in full agreement with the theories of Keel and Uehlinger
discussed in paragraph 2.4 above.
2.7 CONCLUSION
In this chapter I concentrated on a few scholars who recently (during the past twenty
years) applied their minds (some more than others) to the subject of the religious
symbolism of seal iconography. This list is not by any means exhaustive. There
seems to be a growing tendency amongst scholars to give more attention to the
importance of seal iconography. This is especially true with regard to the ‘Freiburg
School’ where scholars such as Schroer (1987, 2006); Nunn (2002); Sass (1993);
Witte & Diehl
Unfortunately, however, except maybe for Keel and Uehlinger, most of the relevant
scholars move only on the periphery of the subject of this study. Even those who
touched the subject for the most part only do so scantily. There may be a variety of
reasons for this neglect: some scholars wrote about other related subjects, for instance
the Phoenician or Hebrew inscription on a seal, and only touched on the iconography
to complete a picture; some maybe due to a lack of interest and some scholars maybe
as a result of incomprehension of the importance of the subject.
(2008), Schipper (1999) and others are making valuable contributions
in this field.
‘Archaeologists and biblicists have not always clearly and fully communicated with
each other’ (Gittlen 2002:xi). This lack of communication led to misunderstandings;
archaeologists sometimes require the experience and knowledge to understand the



59
meaning of their finds, while Biblicists, by objectively considering physical evidence,
may be in a better position to interpret the texts. Dever (2002:29) pleads for
interdisciplinary dialogue and to understand a history of ancient Israelite history, the
vantage point should be to pursue history and not theology. Archaeological finds have
already done a lot to clarify certain aspects of ancient Israelite religion. Dever
(2002:26) gives the following examples:
a. The 10th-8th
b. Hundreds of terracotta female figurines giving testimony to fertility rites;
century cultic installations at Dan, ʿTel Ta Anach, Tell-el
Farʿ Ah/Tirzah, Lachish, Arad and other sites, illustrating and clarifying what the
biblical writers had in mind with the term bāmȏt;
c. The 8th
I venture to add that the understanding of and insight into the religion of the ancient
Israelites would have been much further developed had such scholars but realised the
importance of seals and joined forces in their analysis and interpretation. A major
factor contributing to this incomprehension may be a disregard of what the
iconography purports to tell us and the important role that symbolism played in
ancient societies. In the next chapter the meaning and importance of symbolism will
be investigated and discussed.
century inscriptions at Khirbet el-Qȏm and Kuntillet ʿA jrûd, referring to
the cult of Asherah.

CHAPTER 3
SYMBOLISM AND RELIGION
3.1 INTRODUCTION
Dever (1987:210) defined religion as a ‘set of symbolic thought forms and acts that
relate human beings to the ultimate conditions of existence perceived as the Holy’.
Zevit (2001:611) uses the following definition for ‘Israelite religions’ but it can be
used to define all religions: ‘Israelite religions are the varied, symbolic expressions
of, and appropriate responses to the deities and powers that groups or communities
deliberately affirmed as being of unrestricted value to them within their worldview.’
Both the above definitions use the word ‘symbolic’ and symbolism therefore seems to
be an integral part of ‘religions.’
The words ‘symbol’ or ‘symbolism’ are not used in the Bible, although there is a
prohibition against ‘graven images’, but the connotation of ‘symbol’ and ‘graven
image’ may not always be the same. Symbols are however common to all religions.
‘It is derived from the Greek word symbolon which had several uses e.g. as a sign,
pledge, token and its importance derived from the fact that it was a representative
object which guaranteed the reality of that which it symbolized’ (Marshall et al
1996:1140).
‘...a symbol is one kind of sign — that is, something (a gesture, sound, objects,
image, etc.) that refers to something else. Some signs point to their referents by
association, as smoke indicates fire. Others point to their referents by resemblance, as
certain paintings at Lascaux resemble horses or pantomime may resemble the



61
behaviour of a fleeing man. Symbols, however, refer by arbitrary convention. The
red, green and yellow of a traffic light, the badge of a policeman, and the sound of the
word “table” are all symbols because their meaning is essentially arbitrary’ (Chase
1999:35).
In a primitive religious sense, symbolism has been defined ‘... as a set of complex
associations where religious rituals, icons and artifacts were interpreted by members
of the social groups (tribe, community, congregation). Meaning, therefore, was a
matter of interaction between the symbol, the group and individuals within the group’
(Lewis 2002:48).
Today, modern man may be able to distinguish between an object and a symbol but in
ancient times people did not make such a distinction and perceived symbolism in a
literal sense, not in the relationship between an object and a sign, but in the influence
a sign has upon its perceiver. Symbols provide people with a means to pictorially
express ideas of significance. In brief, we can say that the main characteristic of a
symbol is that it expresses something significant. Turner (1967:26) states that a
‘symbol is always a best possible expression of relatively unknown fact, a fact which
is nonetheless recognised or postulated as existing.’
Religion like the arts requires a response from people. How do you respond to a
religious message? No matter what the faith of the individual is, it challenges
him/her to respond and each religion has its symbols that require some response from
a person. Otherwise it ceases to be a ‘faith’ and remains impersonal teachings that
are used for protection from other beliefs and value systems (Tillich 1958:40-41).
The beliefs in a faith, on the other hand, inspire and motivate; they are central to



62
man’s being. These beliefs center on what Tillich called our ‘ultimate concern.’ And
that which forms this center of our values and beliefs, he said, ‘must be expressed
symbolically, because symbolic language alone is able to express the ultimate’
(Tillich 1958:41). Therefore, when we express our core beliefs, we must use
symbolism, no matter how concrete the images used to express that faith (Tillich
1958:53). This is not to say that organised religions, whether those of primitive
societies or the ‘world religions’, do not express the faiths of many of their members.
These organizations could never have formed if the religious movements out of which
they emerged had not expressed the critical beliefs and values of those who formed
them into lasting ‘institutions.’ Regardless, these values, these beliefs have to be
expressed by symbolic language. This does not mean that some, even most, of the
believers do not take the language literally. The problem with interpretation, given
Tillich's statement about the necessity of symbolism, is that its interpretation is never
complete; worse, the interpretation loses meaning, thus loses meaningfulness.
It is not just theologians, mystics, and religious leaders who speak of faith, of the
power of beliefs. William James, a pioneer psychologist in the study of comparative
religious beliefs, made clear the difference between dogma and faith when he stated:
‘In the religious sphere, in particular, belief that formulas are true can never wholly
take the place of personal experience’ (James 1908:457). Indeed, a few paragraphs
earlier he almost decried ‘philosophy’ in terms that argue for symbols, for ‘truth and
fact’ (James, 1908:456).



63
3.2 APPLICATION OF SYMBOLISM
Symbols would be meaningless if they are not to be applied in practice to some belief
or attitude. In modern times we find that many scholars, when encountering primitive
symbolism, apply the pragmatic theory to symbolism. First, pragmatism dismisses
symbols as ‘ornaments and ornamentation.’ It seems to be regarded as being
employed for artistic purposes. At least part of this attitude apparently originated with
the Protestant Reformation and its reaction to the excessive statuary and other
‘ornaments’ in churches that the Protestants viewed as idolatry (Cf. Dever 2005:51
52).
‘... biblical scholars who typically dismiss objects like figurines as “mere symbols”
miss the point. Theologians, if they presume to contribute anything to liturgy, should
be more sensitive to the need for symbols. Yet in my experience, those who deal with
ancient Israelite religion are often not even aware of the power of symbols. This is
especially true of Protestants, who characteristically emphasize the “word” over the
“sacraments.” And, not coincidentally, most of the writers on our subject have been
Protestants’ (Dever 2005:52).
Although this attitude may be justified in some cases, it should be noted that these
very items were originally created to act as symbols for the illiterate to understand
much of the Bible and theology of the Church. This is a universal truth; it does not
only apply to the Bible and the Israelites, but to all primitive (and illiterate) societies
and their religions. It appears that the growth of literacy also created a literalism that
ignored the significance of the symbols. Many scholars of religion and anthropology



64
still seem to analyse symbols and the phenomenon of symbolism itself as ornaments,
albeit as ornaments valued by primitive cultures, despite the fact that most ‘primitive’
cultures were extremely practical in all they did, even in rituals and beliefs.
It is a fact that symbolism is no substitute for direct knowledge, which an individual
has personally experienced. ‘But symbolism is very fallible, in the sense that they
(sic) may induce actions, feelings, emotions, and beliefs about things which are mere
notions without that exemplification in the world which the symbolism leads us to
presuppose’ (Whitehead 1985:6).
The portrayal of a symbol will be of no significance if the idea which it endeavors to
convey, falls outside the field of experience of the percipient. Morris (1993:6) refers
to such experience as the ‘given’ which reflects the present experience of an
individual. To use an old example: to show to an Eskimo a picture of a lamb to
signify innocence or softness would have no effect, a picture of a baby seal would be
closer to the mark. Thus the perception of the individual is of the utmost importance.
It has been said: ‘We regard symbolism as a reality, important in its own right,
worthy of systematic investigation. Consequently, we attempt to look directly at
symbolism ― in the case of religion, at the symbolism of meaning ― rather than
looking through it to see how it functions for the individual or even to give an
interpretation of what sort of meaning it conveys’ (Wuthnow 1992:53) .



65
3.3 SYMBOLISM AND RELIGION
Kendall (2008:416) stated that the symbolism of religion is so powerful because it
‘expresses the essential facts of our human existence’. In the modern world
symbolism plays a major role in all spheres of society. Symbols are used as
trademarks; to identify danger zones; as traffic signs and various other applications
for identification purposes. Even the major religions of the modern world can be
readily distinguished by merely looking at the following symbols:
Buddhism Hinduism Judaism Christianity Islam
Figure 7: Some religious symbols of today
(Rursus 2007)
When one sees a church with a Christian cross on the top, one perceives the message
the church is sending about its belief system. The Jewish, Muslim, Hindu and
Buddhist religions do the same.
‘Religion involves a complex system of ...symbolic usages. Religion embodies a
conceptualization and projection of the most fundamental human needs and human
problems (Firth 2004:248)’. Although the symbols used by religions may differentiate



66
between them, that is not why they are established or their eventual purpose. The
most important part of that symbol is to identify with what is special about their faith
(Fralin 2002; Cf. Kendall 2008:371). It has, therefore, a special significance,
particular to that faith. When any religion places a sign outside their place of worship,
they are signifying to the world at large what they believe and what faith system and
moral creed they follow.
Furthermore, religion ‘being a powerful force, plays an important role in binding and
unifying people. Thus, symbolism within different religious beliefs aims to personify
the feelings and emotions behind what they believe to encapsulate the trend of that
particular belief and create a sense of oneness and exclusivity’ (Hunter 2002; Cf.
Eliade 1958:445-450).
For the Christian community, the cross represents the gift of Christ’s flesh and blood
given for salvation. The cross is regarded as an icon of their faith. Many Christians
identify the cross with worship, although there are other uses for the symbol of the
cross as well. For most Christians it is a reminder that Christ died in order that their
sins can be forgiven and receive eternal life. The Star of David and kippa (prayer cap)
of the Jewish religion are used similarly. A Buddhist may keep a figure of Buddha in
his or her home as a reminder to pay homage to the emblem of their beliefs, a witness
to others of what the faithful believe. In Buddhism, the Wheel of Dharma (virtue and
duty) is symbolic of God (Devera 2002; Cf Hannay 1912:5-12).
Despite the teachings of Muhammad that it is a sin to make images of any sort, the
Muslims use the Ka'aba and the Crescent Moon with a five cornered star in the cup of



67
the moon as symbols of their faith and are regarded as symbolic of the presence of
God. The latter symbol is revered to such an extent that the Red Cross, symbol of
medical services in the rest of the world to identify ambulances, hospitals and other
medical facilities and equipment, was adapted to a red crescent in the Muslim world.
The various religions and cultures existing in the world thus had developed
significantly different symbols. This variety in symbolism enabled the different
religions to establish their individual flavour to their symbols and to identify and be
distinguished from each other.
The initial symbol adopted by Christians for identification purposes was the fish, or
ichthus. The Greek letters of the word fish were used as an acronym of the words
Jesus, God's son and saviour. The fish was fundamental to the lives of early
Christians, figured in many miracles performed by Jesus and fit in well with the
theological promise Jesus made that his apostles would be fishers of men.
The hexagram signifying Judaism is one of the oldest symbols still in use today.
Initially used as the symbol for the Jewish kingdom, it spread into the rest of the
world with the exile of the Jews from their country in 70 CE. It is known as the Star
of David or the magen David (Shield of David). The earliest known use dates to about
the sixth century B.C.E. (Eisenberg 2004:575).
Hebrew symbolism, however, was not something which was born with the
establishment of Judaism. ‘...the one characteristic of the Hebrew scriptures is



68
symbolism...every page of the Bible is saturated with symbolism...’ (Hannay
1922:7-8).
In the Bible symbols are often used to convey aspects of God. The rainbow was the
symbol of God’s covenant that the earth will never again be destroyed by a flood (Gn
9:13-16). Moses made a bronze serpent and put it on a pole so that anyone who was
bitten by a snake could look at it and live (Nm 21:8-9), thus symbolizing the wisdom
and power of God. The altar symbolized God’s meeting place with man and the Ark
of the Covenant the presence of God; when the temple was built it symbolized the
universal power of God (Marshall et al 1996:1141).27
3.4 CONCLUSION
These symbols, whether literal
or figurative, abound in the Bible.
Throughout the ages symbols have not been regarded as mere signs. By presenting a
symbol, the presenter intends to convey a message, for instance, a symbol of a cross
in front of a church does not merely state that the building is a church. It signifies that
it is a Christian church representing the Christian faith; that Christ died on the cross in
order to wash with His blood the sins of those who are prepared to follow him. It goes
further, implying that the cross (death) is not the end of the road, but that Christ was
resurrected from the grave, thus preparing the road for his followers who also will be
resurrected to join Him in eternal life. From a simple symbol flows a complete
27 At a later stage in Israelite history, this serpent, which the Israelites called Nehushtan, was
apparently idolized, for King Hezekiah, 14th king of Judah, destroyed this snake ‘for up to that time the Israelites had been burning incense to it’ (2 Ki 18:4). It seems that the initial symbol evolved into an idol in its own right.



69
spiritual message. In a study of the ancient Israelites, when the majority of the people
were illiterate, symbolism was a much more important vehicle to convey a message.
To disregard symbolism in the ancient world and pass it off as mere decoration would
not only be an unscientific approach, but a reckless one, bordering on the criminal.
Should a depiction of the Egyptian goddess Taweret be found in the context of the
Israelites (for example a figurine at a household shrine or on a seal amulet belonging
to a woman), can it be truly said that it was for decoration only? She (Taweret) was a
goddess portrayed as a pregnant female hippopotamus and was the goddess of fertility
and childbirth, credited with bringing babies to childless women and thus often
portrayed on charms and amulets. She was believed to assist all females (divine, royal
or ordinary) in childbirth. It would make no sense if one concludes that the female
owner only had it for decorative purposes. The logical conclusion is that she had it for
fertility and childbirth purposes. She had to believe in the existence of the goddess
and her powers and she (the owner) had to have faith that the goddess would attend to
her needs; once again a complete spiritual message conveyed by the symbol of the
goddess.
Despite the official Israelite religious prohibition of grave images, one can only
conclude that, as in all societies, symbolism played an important role in the life of the
ancient Israelites, including their religion, whether official or unofficial.
If an Israelite or Judahite, therefore, used religious symbols on a royal, government or
personal seal, albeit it symbols of a foreign religion, it could only mean that he or she
intended to attach religious significance to those symbols. It does not necessarily



70
imply that the individual adhere to the foreign religion but he or she could have used
the symbol to express concepts of his or own religion. This may especially be true in
Israel in Judah where the official biblical Yahwistic religion forbade the use of graven
images (see the discussion in paragraph 6.1 hereinafter) and the symbols could have
been used to portray certain aspects of Yahweh, without portraying Yahweh himself.
It could also indicate polytheism in that the owner may, in addition to Yahwism, also
have worshipped other gods, including Egyptian gods.
The theme of the current study being the acceptance of Egyptian religious symbolism
in Israel and Judah, one needs to have an understanding of certain aspects of Egyptian
religion and symbolism pertaining to the period of study. Only then can the true
meaning of Egyptian religious symbols on seals from Israel and Judah be deduced. In
the next chapter I will endeavour to highlight those relevant aspects of Egyptian
religious symbolism required to place the Israelite seal iconography in question in
context. The Egyptian symbolism must also be placed in historical context and in
particular those periods in Egyptian history when contact between Egypt and Syro
Palestine was of such a nature that cultural exchanges between the regions were the
most likely to have occurred.



71
CHAPTER 4
EGYPT’S CONTACT WITH SYRO-PALESTINE, CONTEMPORARY
RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS AND SYMBOLISM
4.1 INTRODUCTION
In Chapter 1, I briefly discussed the continuous contact between Egypt and Syro
Palestine from the Chalcolithic Period to Iron Age II. Some of these contacts resulted
from hostile activities, others from trade relations, passing through a region or
random casual encounters. Hostile activities include invasions with temporary and
limited goals such as military raids, but also the creation of more permanent military
presence as part of empire building, the latter being more conducive to cultural
exchange than a short-lived incursion.
In this study it is not intended to give a complete overview of Egyptian history,
including the historical development of Egyptian religious concepts and symbolism.
For purposes of this study I will confine myself to those periods of Egyptian and
Syro-Palestine history when the regions were the most closely involved politically,
commercially or otherwise. Cultural exchanges between Egypt and Syro-Palestine
apparently occurred over millennia and Egyptian religious symbols appearing on
seals from Syro-Palestine during Iron II could be the result of cultural exchanges that
occurred already during the Bronze Age. As will be discussed in more detail in
Chapter 6, anepigraphic seals with Egyptian motifs (including Egyptian religious
motifs), dating to the Bronze Age, have been discovered at archaeological sites all
over Syro-Palestine.



72
Although Egyptian motifs first made their appearance in Canaan, Phoenicia, Israel
and Judah during the Bronze Age, epigraphic seals with such motifs only appeared in
this region at a very late stage during Iron II. It therefore does not necessarily follow
that the motifs on these seals resulted from cultural exchanges during Iron II only.
These motifs could have been established centuries before and became a cultural
tradition in the region. The name Thutmosis III (the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh) for
instance appears on seals as late as the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. The names of Old
Kingdom pharaohs such as Khufu and Wenis were first inscribed on seals during the
New Kingdom, not on contemporary ones (Andrews 1994:55).
One also finds that during the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty the Saite rulers of Egypt
revolutionised the prevalent religion in Egypt by reverting to archaic gods, cults,
rituals, priesthood, festivals and ceremonies (Law 1988:91-92) (see also paragraph
4.4.2 hereinafter). One should therefore be careful not to confuse one period with an
older one by dating artifacts to an earlier period simply because they represent
symbolism from the earlier period and were not found in context.
In the premises it would be unscientific to confine oneself to the period in Egyptian
history coinciding with Iron IIB and C, i.e. from Dynasty 21 to 26 (during the Third
Intermediate Period and the early part of the Late Dynastic Period).
Before continuing with the specific periods I will endeavour to explain certain
Egyptian religious concepts as well as Egyptian symbolism and the role of amulets
and scarabs.



73
4.2 RELIGION AND CULT IN ANCIENT EGYPT DURING RELEVANT
PERIODS
4.2.1 Cults, temples and rituals
a) Cults
The word cult comes from the Latin word cultus, a derivation of the verb colere
meaning ‘to worship or give reverence to a deity’. Cults were the official
structure used to worship the Egyptian gods. In regard to ancient Egypt, this
structure included the priests who carried out rituals associated with the gods,
who were frequently manifest in the form of statues, within the cult temples
(Gomes 1995:7). The center of the Egyptian cult was the temple, a sacred area
enclosed by a wall that excluded the profane.
b) Temples
By definition, a temple, in Egyptian context, was a closed place, the house of a
god, the receptacle of his effigy and his ba, isolated and protected from the
outside, profane world by its enclosure wall. It included a section devoted to
worldly needs. Inside the sanctuary of the temple was the effigy or cult statue,
which served as the dwelling for the god worshipped in the cult center, though
there could be and were more than one in many temples (Dunand, Zivie-Coche
& Lorton 2005:121). Some of the temples are dedicated to more than one god. A
prime example is the double temple, devoted to Horus and Sobek at Kom Ombo
in Upper Egypt (see Figure 100 on p.304).



74
At state level temples played an important role and in Ancient Egypt there were
two approaches towards the temple concept. In earlier dynasties one finds the sun
temples, especially during the 5th Dynasty (but also the Aten temples during the
Amarna period of the 18th
Temples could be divided into cultus and mortuary temples. Although their
architecture and rituals were similar, the cultus temples and mortuary temples
were two distinct concepts. The cultus temple, dedicated to the cult of a particular
god or goddess, was the house of the god, where his or her statue could be housed
and protected (Oakes & Gahlin 2007:354). It was a place of great sanctity where
the king or priest by the use of specific rituals and offerings could approach the
god. From the offerings the god could derive sustenance and benefit. It was
believed that the god or goddess on his or her part would assist in maintaining
ma’at and provide bountifully for Egypt (Shafer 1998a:1). This relationship and
regular performance of rituals were regarded as essential lest disaster befall the
country (Cf. James 1983:139).
Dynasty) and the cultus and mortuary temples. In
contrast to houses and palaces, regarded as temporary dwellings and thus for the
most part constructed of clay bricks, temples, like tombs, were approached on the
basis of lasting forever and were thus elaborately built of stone and luxuriously
decorated (Kleiner 2008:52).
Mortuary temples had a similar cultus function, but they had an additional
function. During the Old and Middle Kingdoms they were attached to the pyramid
as part of the king’s burial complex where the funerary rites were performed and
perpetual offerings were placed to ensure the continuing sustenance of the



75
deceased ruler. With the demise of pyramids and the introduction of rock-hewn
tombs, a lack of space prohibited the erection of adjacent mortuary temples. These
temples were now built as separate entities away from the Valley of the Kings,
but for the most part still on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes. They still
functioned as places where the deceased, but now deified king, was worshipped
and provided for by food offerings. In its cultus function the temple was dedicated
to the main local deity, thus providing for rituals incorporating both the god and
the king (Cf. Murray 1931:3-4).
c) Cult rituals
Cult rituals were actually dialogues between the gods, and therefore the king (or
a priestly substitute for the king) acted in the divine performance as a god.
Until the Middle Kingdom, the spheres of administration and cult were not
separated, but in the 18th Dynasty, a special priesthood for cultic purposes was
established (Erman 1894:293; Fox 2000:47).
Rituals centered on offerings, but there were certainly numerous other rituals,
including many daily functions such as washing and clothing the gods (or at
least the statue of the gods). Other rituals took the form of celebrations when, for
example, one god might be taken to visit the cult center of another, and it was
during these festivals that common Egyptians probably came closest to their
gods, for at other times they were prohibited from the sanctuaries that housed
the cult statues (Johnston 2007:156).
The ancient Egyptians believed that the living, the dead and the gods all had the
same basic needs: shelter, food and drink, washing, rest and recreation. The



76
living was accommodated in houses, the dead were provided with tombs and the
gods resided in temples. Foods were supplied for the dead by means of the
funerary cult and the god’s needs were served through divine rituals in the cultus
and mortuary temples (Silverman 2003:148). It provided a ritualised and
dramatised version of the mundane process of washing, clothing and feeding of
the god’s cult statue in the sanctuary.
A second group of rituals were the festival rituals which, although they differed
from temple to temple, depending on the particular god’s theology, were held at
regular, often annual occasions and celebrated special events in the god’s life,
such as the resurrection of Osiris. These festivities consisted of celebrations both
inside and outside the temple, including a public procession of the god’s statue
and, as already stated, this was the only occasion when the public had the
opportunity to see the god and participate in his worship (Silverman 2003:149
150; David 1999:111-112).
At first the cult, and for that matter, the benefits of religion and the gods which it
served, was for the most part limited to the king, though many functions and
rituals were performed by his substitutes (priests). Common Egyptians could
mostly only hope that the King took his religious duties seriously or otherwise
they might expect to suffer famine or other disasters or for that matter, any
prospect of an afterlife. As time passed, religion became much more popularized,
so that in later Egyptian history, common Egyptians demanded their own means
of worshipping and being accepted by their gods. More and more ordinary
Egyptians built within their homes shrines for their personal worship, or at other



77
times, small public shrines where they could worship and pray together.
However, throughout Egyptian history, ordinary Egyptians were limited as to the
scope that they could participate in the state cult centers (James 1983:132;
Silverman 2003:162).
4.2.2 Magic and Egyptian religion
It seems that the ordinary Egyptian’s religion consisted largely of magical practises
and the invocation of those deities who might protect him or her from the dangers of
daily life (James 1983:133-134).
Magic has been defined as ‘the apparent manipulation of natural forces to change
the form of things or influence events’ (David 1999:119).28
‘In fact, the ancient Egyptian religion was inseparable from magic and thus it
became an integral part of daily life in many ways. ... Priests were not mere
administrators of divine will, but also masters of the magic arts. Their job was to
keep the perfect primeval order of things, but they didn’t hesitate to use their magic
for earthly purposes as well.’ (Frater 2008:340).
In Egypt, in contrast to
the Israelites, magic was fully legitimized through religion. Magic was a thread that
linked everything because all things were regarded as potentially animate if the
correct magical procedures were followed (Cf, Thompson 2003:51; Harris
1998:156).
28 Magic has also been variously defined as ‘a “pretended art”, an art that can somehow influence the course of events and produce amazing physical phenomenon. The art of magic is supposedly to work by using its power to compel supernatural beings to intervene in everyday events or to call up occult forces of nature’ (Christie 2007:6).



78
Throughout the ages magic and religion have been associated with one another, either
forming an integral part of the beliefs of a country like Egypt or being used in
conjunction with them, ‘...whereas “society” principally covers relationships between
man and man and “religion” the relationship between deity and mankind, the powers
of magic found application in both spheres’ (Marshall et al 1996:714). Thus, higher
authorities or deities had to exist to explain the otherwise inexplicable. Rituals could
help to solve everyday problems and maintain stability and well being. As a result
magic and superstition played a crucial part in daily life and were by no means
considered unorthodox or an alternative to religion but an integral part of it. As a
matter of fact, magic can be regarded as a subdivision of religion.
4.2.3 Egyptian religious symbolism and its meaning
Symbols, since prehistoric times, have played a major role in the culture and religion
of Egypt. Symbols were used on a regular basis to convey concepts and ideas which
would be difficult to express clearly through more concrete modes of expression.
These ideas, thoughts, beliefs or perceptions often transcended the realms of reality
(Cf. Bonnefoy & Doniger 1992:12-15). Egypt’s symbolic orientation can be
confirmed by the fact that these symbols were not just used for decorative purposes
but they also were inherent to religious and magical rituals. Any effort at
understanding Egyptian culture would be half hearted without learning more about
these symbols (Cf. Kirk 1973:207-208).
Religious symbolism in Egypt can best be illustrated by the system of hieroglyphs,
which, even after the development of other writing systems (hieratic, demotic and



79
Coptic) in Egypt, remained the vehicle for religious (sacred) writings (Geddes &
Grosset 1997:378). ‘Hieroglyphs contain within them the very essence of ancient
Egypt’ (McDermott 2002:6).
Hieroglyphics come from the Greek words hieros (sacred) and glyphos (sculpted).
The earliest known hieroglyphs are on seals and seal impressions. Initially they were
mere pictograms, thus merely conveying the object(s) they portrayed. This situation
however placed severe limitations on more complex or abstract concepts and ideas. In
their further development, phonograms to depict particular sounds and ideograms to
convey abstract notions such as love, hate or anger where the symbol represented
much more than the image itself (Geddes & Grosset 1997:377).
This system of symbols finally evolved into a complex system ‘...which was a
mixture of ideographic signs and phonetic signs, abstract allusions and concrete
pictograms in the form of visual pictures...’ (Cirlot & Sage 1978:182). It is not
possible to discuss this whole complex system in this study and only certain aspects
will be highlighted for illustration purposes.
29
Sometimes the name of Isis is simply written as if it meant ‘throne’. Amongst the
insignia of royalty, the throne has special significance because it represents the power
30
of the king sitting on his throne: ‘The throne “makes” the king ― the term occurs in
Egyptian texts ― and so the throne, Isis, is the “mother” of the king...the throne
29 It is important to note that: ‘Letters (of the alphabet) of all cultures have a symbolic significance...Letter-symbolism probably derives from Primitive pictograms and ideographs’ (Cirlot & Sage1978:182).
30 Further details and discussions of various Egyptian religious symbols are contained in Annexure B.



80
which “made” the king is comprehended as a mother...As early as the First Dynasty a
Pharaoh called himself “son of Isis”’ (Frankfort 2000:6-7). Furthermore Isis was the
mother of Horus, the Egyptian god associated with kingship. Isis is therefore
associated with the throne and she was inter alia represented as such. The hieroglyph
for Isis appearing on a seal could therefore, depending on the context, be read as
representing ‘throne’ or a ‘throne’ read as Isis.
The same symbols on various seals may therefore have different meanings. This may
cause confusion and could explain the varying interpretations by Egyptologists of the
same inscription on a particular seal. This will be more fully discussed in Chapter 6,
where individual Hebrew seals are analyzed.
Various Egyptian religious concepts and symbols such as the ankh, the ba, the ka,
Bennu, Ben-Ben, djed, udjat, feather of Ma’at etcetera are encountered and will be
more fully dealt with in Chapter 5 and 6 hereinafter as well as in Annexure B.
4.2.4 Amulets and scarabs
‘The Egyptians probably invented the biggest and most varied collection of amulets
in the history of mankind. Over thousands of years literally millions were fabricated,
usually in faience, shell, ivory, precious stones like lapis lazuli, jasper, alabaster,
turquoise, silver, gold and later in bronze’ (Najovits 2004:117).
The Egyptian belief in magic, magical powers and magical properties influenced
many areas of their lives. Inanimate objects were believed to have the ability to affect
events once they have been charged with magical force. Funerary equipment was



81
considered to have magical properties that could bring special benefits to the
deceased (Petrie 1914:1).
It was common practise throughout the ancient Near East to wear on the person a
small symbolic object as a charm or protection against evil forces. Such amulets were
usually in the form of small ornaments such as stones, gems, seals, beads, plaques or
emblems, sometimes inscribed with an incantation or prayer (thus proving beyond
doubt their religious connotation). In this regard the Bible was unique in condemning
their use. Thus all stones and rings used as seals were considered as amulets (Cf. Je.
22:24; Hg. 2:23; Marshall et al 1996:33).
Amulets formed an important group of jewellery since they acted as lucky charms
and the ancient peoples believed that they endowed the wearer or owner with
protection and supernatural magical powers and could be worn by the rich as well as
the poor. They were carried by the person when alive and even in death they had a
special significance and were placed as part of the grave goods with the deceased to
provide help in his future existence (Andrews 1994:6). Thus they were carried over
from this life to the next in order to continue their intended purpose.
The ancient Egyptian names for an amulet were sa, meket and nehet, all derived from
verbs meaning ‘to guard’ or ‘protect’. A further term wedja seems to mean ‘well
31
being’ (Oakes & Gahlin 2007:454). The term amulet comes from the later Arabic
31 It is important to note at this stage that a large number of seal-amulets, discovered in Palestine, were found in tombs and graves as part of the funerary objects (Cf. Keel 1997). Although not all of them can be ascribed to Israelite/Judahite origin (for instance some are found in Philistine context, others are Phoenician and some come from areas exclusively occupied by Egyptian military forces), it will be argued that the remainder, which can only have Israelite/Judahite origins, bear witness to diversions from the Yahweh religion propagated by the Bible.



82
word hamulet meaning ‘something that is borne or carried.’ The term itself is applied
to any ornament or talisman, which were worn to attain the assistance of supernatural
powers (Wallis Budge 1972a:23).
The primary function of all Egyptian jewellery was to protect the wearer against a
whole array of hostile forces and events, including ferocious animals, disease, famine,
accidents and natural disasters. Amulets were believed to have special beneficial
properties and by the principle of sympathetic magic, to be able to attract good forces
to assist the wearer or, conversely, to repel a variety of evils and dangers. Nearly
every Egyptian, whether adult or child, if they could afford it, wore an amulet, charm
or talisman (Wallis Budge 1972a:4).
In ancient Egypt, two kinds of amulets were produced and worn, firstly those
inscribed with magical formulae and secondly those without such formulae (Wallis
Budge 1972a:26).
Some amulets were regarded as universally beneficial while others had particular
significance only for the wearer. Essentially they were charms that had been
magically charged in order to bring about the desired results. Some were designed to
strengthen the owner’s ability to overcome the dangers he encountered and took the
forms of images of power such as miniature crowns, sceptres and staffs of office
while others represented gods or animals. Another group was believed to have impact
on any physical weakness or disability which the owner might suffer; these were
modelled to simulate the limbs in the hope that the amulet would attract magical
strength to heal the afflicted part or that the disease would be transferred from the
limb to the amulet ‘double’ (Wallis Budge 1978a:1-3).



83
Other amulets represented offerings (food, drink or clothing) and possessions to
ensure that the owner would continue to enjoy wealth and prosperity. Examples of
these are the sacred Eye of Horus (Wedjat), which symbolised completeness or
wholeness; the ankh, which represented eternal life and the djed pillar, which was
associated with resurrection and rebirth as well as strength and stability.
The scarab (dung beetle) symbolised eternal renewal of life. The Egyptians made this
association because when they observed the habits of the beetle, each new generation
seemed to emerge self-generated from the ball of dung.
The shape of the amulet conferred power and strength to its owner, but some
materials and colours were also believed to possess special hidden qualities that could
bring health and good luck. Stones such as carnelian, turquoise and lapis lazuli were
much favoured because of the magical properties of their colours and they were often
used in the manufacture of jewellery and amulets. Sometimes such stones were used
only if they duplicated the colour of the original limb or organ and this authenticity
was expected to bring additional benefits to the owner (David 1999:114).
4.3 ANCIENT EGYPT’S CONTACT WITH SYRO-PALESTINE AND
RELEVANT PREVAILING RELIGIOUS CONCEPTS
4.3.1 Introduction
In paragraphs 1.3 and 4.1 above we have seen that although there was contact in some
form of another between Egypt and Syro-Palestine, it was only during the period of
empire building by Egypt during the Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Dynasties that



84
there were prolonged periods of continuous contact between the regions. It seems that
there was nearly always contact through trade or on personal levels, especially
through Syrian ports such as Byblos and Tyre. Politically, however, Egypt’s presence
in Syro-Palestine during other periods was confined to temporary military raids.
Thutmosis III (and to a lesser extent Amenophis II, Amenophis IV and Horemheb) of
the Eighteenth Dynasty and Sethos I of the Nineteenth Dynasty established a more
permanent presence in the region. Military bases were established and Egyptian
envoys supervised and controlled the activities of local princes. This presence lasted
for nearly five hundred years and it seems therefore that this is the most likely period
during which Egyptian symbolism got a foothold in Syro-Palestine and retained its
importance for the next thousand years.
Another period where close contact (commercial, political and on personal levels)
between Egypt and Syro-Palestine appear to have existed was during the Third
Intermediate Period and the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty of the Late Dynastic Period.
4.3.2 Predynastic Egypt
Although archaeological records indicate contact between Egypt and Syro-Palestine
during pre-historic times, the extent of such contact and the resultant cultural
exchanges (including religious concepts) is unknown. I will confine this study to a
brief overview of the dynastic periods, starting with the Old Kingdom where
archaeological evidence is supplemented by textual evidence.
In pre-dynastic times, thus before unification of Upper and Lower Egypt, religious
cults appear to have been localised with each community having its own set of



85
deities, without a real state religion (Emery 1961:119). These earliest gods were for
the most part depicted in animal or fetish form, thus laying the foundation of animal
cults and representations in the religions developed during later periods of Egyptian
history. These cults are attested to by the burial of animals, wrapped in linen and
matting, amongst human burials. Even at this early stage amulets in the form of
animals were placed with the interred bodies of humans. Animal gods were painted
on pottery and statuettes of animals are found in human graves from that period
(Wiedemann 2001:1671-172).
The reason why the early Egyptians deified animals are not clear, but it could
possibly be ascribed to man’s close proximity to the animal world, some of the
animals being domesticated and thus assisting mankind, while others posed a threat to
human life, domesticated animals and crops (Cf. Oakes & Gahlin 2007:268-269).
Jackals devastating cemeteries and mostly being scavengers may have led to Anubis,
in his capacity as dealing with dead bodies, being depicted as a jackal headed god.
This type of anthropomorphization of the animal gods seems to have started during
early dynastic times when these gods began to be represented with animal or bird
heads on human bodies. By the time of the 2nd
One finds that throughout the dynastic period animal gods appeared in a variety of
forms; some with animal heads and human bodies; some with only partial animal
features (as for example Hathor with cow ears or horns) and others have complete
animal bodies (David 1999:101).
Dynasty some animal gods appear with
fully human forms. Some of the gods, although a vast minority, such as Ptah, were,
however, always represented with a full human form (Cf. Pinch 2004:181).



86
During predynastic times, before the unification of Egypt (allegedly by Narmer
[Menes], who was allegedly the first king of the First Dynasty), there occurred a
gradual political development when small villages joined together to form clans and
eventually nomes.32
Most of the universal gods of Egypt are depicted on seals found in Syro-Palestine.
The concept of universal gods, elevated above local gods, seems to have started
during predynastic times and they have been termed as ‘cosmic gods.’ So from the
earliest time the ancient Egyptian had a perception of the expanse of the universe and
of beings not confined to specific localities or tribes. Ultimately these gods were
responsible for creating and maintaining the perceived universe. It seems that Horus
was revered in both Upper and Lower Egypt and that after unification he became the
principal deity. Gods from Upper Egypt who profited from the unification and
became national (cosmic or universal) gods were Seth of Ombos and Thoth of
Hermopolis. Gods from Lower Egypt who retained their prominence throughout the
Dynastic Period were Ra of Heliopolis and Ptah of Memphis (James 1983:130).
These nomes had their own gods (local gods) from which some
emerged as national gods while others remained local gods (James 1983:130).
Throughout the dynastic period and beyond, some of the local gods remained
virtually unchanged, while others became fused with the universal gods and both
32 Although ‘nomes’ or districts appear to have originated during predynastic times and were administered as provinces during dynastic times by viziers, the concept remained the same throughout the history of ancient Egypt (Cf. Ions 1997:19).



87
local and cosmic gods continued to be worshipped throughout the historic period with
the cosmic (or universal) gods usually assuming roles as state gods (Harris 2001:156
157).
The result was that the local gods amalgamated to become gods of the nomes and
where an area was conquered the gods of the conquered people would become
absorbed into the gods of the conquerors.
Desirable features or characteristics of the ‘conquered’ gods would be assimilated by
the victorious gods, thus enhancing their own powers. The chief god of the nome had
extensive powers and protected the regional chieftain (Cf. Morenz & Keep 1992:237
242).
Very little is known of the Thinite Period (the first two dynasties) and it will serve no
purpose to deal with this period.
4.3.3 The Old Kingdom (ca. 2686-2181 B.C.E.)
The Old Kingdom in Egypt comprises of the Third to the Sixth Dynasties. By this
time the amalgamations of local cults have led to a confusing pantheon of gods,
which create the impression that the ancient Egyptians worshipped many gods,
although, in all probability, each Egyptian, in practise only worshipped one local god
or group of gods. Nevertheless, Egypt, by now being a united country, had so many
gods that it led to confusion (Cf. Ions 1997:8-9) and it became essential that the role
of the various gods which originated in the previous independent regions of Egypt be
reconsidered and organised in a hierarchy within coherent national pantheon.



88
The priests endeavoured to create some order amongst this multitude of gods in the
pantheon. They attempted to organise the various gods into family groups or into
ogdoads (groups of eight gods) or enneads (groups of nine gods). The intention was
to establish a group of universal or national gods which would involve the whole of
the united Egypt (Cf. Hart 1990:20-22; Dunand, Zivie-Coche & Lorton 2005: 49
50).
These actions resulted in the development of creation myths and other mythologies to
emphasise the relationship between the deities
33
and finally a pantheon of gods was
created which endured throughout the history of ancient Egypt, throughout Greco
Roman times up to the Christian era and the Byzantine Period (see Annexure C) (Cf.
Humphreys & Jenkins 2004:30). 34
33 The concept of a pantheon of gods or a family of gods is prevalent amongst the religions of most ancient societies and is to be found in Mesopotamian, Hittite and Canaanite religions. From the Ugaritic tablets one finds the pantheon of gods that includes a family such as El, Asherah, BaalHaddad, Astarte and Anat in the Canaanite religion. In the later Greek civilization the pantheon of Mount Olympus appears. This pantheon, with a change of names, was later adopted by the Romans. The concept of a single god, as propagated by the Eighteenth Dynasty pharaoh Amenophis IV (Akhenaten) and the Yahweh-religion of the Israelites religions were therefore not conforming to the accepted practises of the times. In the end Akhenaten was reviled and his monuments and temples destroyed. Throughout the history of the Israelites (even if we rely only on the Bible as evidence), one finds the notion to also adopt gods from at least the Canaanite pantheon.
34 Some of the deities remained localised without attaining national acceptance, while some dynasties would elevate their own local god to become the royal patron god, thus becoming, if sometimes only for a limited period, a state god. Most state gods, once elevated as such, however, retained that status throughout the rest of Egyptian history. They might have had local associations with certain nomes and cult centers, but their powers extended throughout the whole of Egypt and sometimes even beyond its borders. They were believed to influence the affairs of state, whether internal or on the international front, especially in respect of foreign conquests. These patron gods of a line of rulers was regarded as state gods and the supreme gods of that particular dynasty. Some of them, such as Ra, Osiris, Isis, Hathor and Amun, later Amun-Ra, were worshipped as supreme deities almost on a continuous basis and even achieved international acclaim (David 1999:102). Other state gods included Ptah, Thoth and Anubis.



89
Prominent in the Third Dynasty was King Djoser, renowned for the first monumental
stone building, the step pyramid at Saqqara. He sent punitive expeditions against the
Nubians and the Bedouin of Sinai, but no records indicate contact with Syro-Palestine
(James 1983:44-45).
The Fourth Dynasty was the era of the great pyramid builders such as Sneferu, Khufu
and Khafre. Monuments and documents provide us with more complete historical
record than during the Third Dynasty. Depictions of arriving sailing ships indicate
trade relations with Syro-Palestine through Byblos. The sun god Ra was mostly
confined to Heliopolis as a local god, although some of the kings started calling
themselves ‘the sons of Ra.’
During the Fifth Dynasty the worship of the sun god Ra of Heliopolis became more
prominent as a national god. Every king started to call himself ‘the son of Ra’ and at
least six of these kings built sun temples dedicated to Ra at Abu Gurab.
There are clear indications that during the Sixth Dynasty Egypt had a more aggressive
expansion policy under kings such as Pepi I, Merenre and Pepi II. Expeditions were
sent to Nubia, Libya, Sinai and Syro-Palestine, but these were mere military raids
with no intention of establishing an Egyptian empire. While Anubis appeared to have
played a major role in the death rituals during the Fifth Dynasty, Osiris came into
prominence during the Sixth Dynasty (Griffiths 1980:5). It is thought that the last
pharaoh of this dynasty, Pepi II, ruled for 94 years. During this long reign the central
administration of Egypt collapsed, followed by political fragmentation of the country.
An important religious development during the Old Kingdom was that during the
early part only the king was entitled to an afterlife. By the end of this period soul and



90
afterlife rights were extended to the entire population; immortality was now the
birthright, not only of the king, but of everybody (Najovits 2004:5).
4.3.4 The First Intermediary Period (ca.2181-2050 B.C.E.)
The Sixth Dynasty was followed by a period known as the First Intermediary Period
during which Egypt lost its unity and was mostly ruled by regional princes
(nomarchs). During the Ninth and Tenth Dynasties the western Delta resumed trade
by sea route with Syro-Palestine as is demonstrated by the use of Lebanese cedar
wood, especially in coffin construction. During this period and more in particular the
Eleventh Dynasty, Thebes and its priesthood came into prominence for the first time in
Egyptian national history (Trigger 1983:114). For a short while during this turmoil of
this period, Arsaphes of Herakleopolis was elevated as a principal god in Lower Egypt
and at the same time the Theban god Month became the principal god in the south
(James 1983:130).
4.3.5 The Middle Kingdom (ca. 2050-1786 B.C.E.)
Approximately 2050 B.C.E. Egypt was reunited by the fifth king of the Eleventh
Dynasty, Theban King Nehepetre Mentuhotpe II. He took the Horus-name Smatowy,
‘He-who-unites-the two-lands’ and from this reunification dates the period known as
the Middle Kingdom which lasted until the end of the Fourteenth Dynasty (Kuhrt
1997:160-162).
During this period Egypt achieved some of its greatest successes, both politically and
artistically. The power of the regional princes (or nomarchs), who caused the



91
disruptions resulting in the First Intermediate Period, was curtailed. Trade routes were
re-established with Syro-Palestine and improved during the Twelfth Dynasty.
Very little is known of actual warfare in Syro-Palestine during the Twelfth Dynasty
apart from a foray by the general Nesymont during the joint reign of Ammenemes I
and Sesostris I and an expedition of Sesostris III. Archaeological discoveries of objects
from the Twelfth Dynasty in Syro-Palestine reveal that there was considerable contact
(probably commercial) between that region and Egypt, not least through the port of
Byblos (James 1983:53).
Despite the continued importance of state gods such as Ra, Osiris, Isis, Horus, Hathor,
Ptah, Thoth and Anubis, a local triad (Amun, Mut and Khonsu) from Thebes gradually
gained in importance (James 1983:131). Amun was originally one of the eight gods of
Hermopolis Magna, but from the 12th Dynasty, when a temple was built at Thebes for
his worship, he became the principal god of that region (Pinch 2004:100)
4.3.6 The Second Intermediate Period (ca. 1786-1567 B.C.E.)
The period between the end of the Twelfth Dynasty and the beginning of the
Eighteenth Dynasty is generally called the Second Intermediate period. All the
historical events have not yet been precisely established, but it was the time of the
Hyksos rule in Lower Egypt where a separate kingdom was established. According to
the historian Manetho, this period was ruled by five dynasties, three being native
Egyptian and two Hyksos, with a certain amount of overlapping, not only between the
native and foreign dynasties but also within the limits of the native dynasties (Kuhrt
1997:173-175).



92
It seems that the centralized government of the whole country continued to function
during the Thirteenth Dynasty until central control developed such weaknesses which
enabled Asiatic settlers (probably from Syro-Palestine) to establish the separate
kingdom in the north. It is not clear if this rule resulted solely from the settlers or if
there was also a subsequent invasion from western Asia. What is clear, however, is
that in recorded history this episode appears to be the first prolonged direct contact
between the Egyptians and the people from western Asia.
The name ‘Hyksos’ is derived from the Egyptian words hekau-khasut which means
‘ruler from foreign lands’ (Keel and Uehlinger 1998:17). Although there is no
evidence of their direct rule in southern Egypt, especially in the Theban region, their
influence appeared to be felt throughout Egypt.
During this period commercial contact with Syro-Palestine was maintained. Redford
(1993:116-117) alleges that despite the fact the Hyksos kings got the Egyptian priests
to confer Horus-names on them, they retained their original religion. This contention
is rejected by Ryholt and Bülow-Jacobsen (1997:149-150) and correctly so. The
Hyksos did not only accept the Egyptian god Seth as their main god, but inscriptions
indicate that other gods such as Ra, Hathor Sobek and Wadjet were also worshipped,
especially from the Fifteenth Dynasty onwards. The kings even accepted the title
‘sons of Ra’ (Ryholt & Bülow-Jacobsen 1997:149; Cf. Te Velde 1971:122; Booth
2005:29-31). Here we have a clear indication of cultural exchange. Unfortunately it is
not known how much of the Egyptian religion was retained by the Hyksos when they
were finally defeated by the Egyptians and returned to western Asia.



93
4.3.7 The New Kingdom (ca.1567-1058 B.C.E.)
In approximately 1567 B.C.E. the Egyptian king Nebpehtyre Amosis I defeated and
expelled the Hyksos; he reunited Egypt and became the first pharaoh of the
Eighteenth Dynasty. Now followed a period of Egyptian aggression in western Asia
(Spielvogel 2008:24). Amosis I, after a three year siege, destroyed the Hyksos city of
Sharuhen in southern Palestine. His successor Thutmosis I even penetrated as far as
the Euphrates defeating the strong kingdom of Mitanni. Princedoms in Syria and
Palestine were conquered and became vassal states of Egypt, with Egyptian garrisons
being stationed in the region to keep the princes at bay (Healy & McBride 1992:8
12).
In approximately 1482 B.C.E., Thutmosis III became the sole ruler of Egypt and in
approximately 1481 B.C.E. the subject princes of Syria revolted forcing the Egyptian
garrisons to withdraw to southern Palestine. Thutmosis III acted at once and
emphatically defeated the princes at Megiddo. He extended the area of Egyptian
control to the east across the Euphrates and to the north to the boundaries of the
Hittite empire (David 1999:50). He undertook no less than seventeen campaigns into
Syro-Palestine during his reign (Kuhrt 1997:193). Control over the conquered
territories (including Syro-Palestine) was maintained by trusted local princes under
the supervision of Egyptian envoys (Bryan 2003:235-237).
These foreign policies were maintained by the successors of Thutmosis III,
Amenophis II (who carried out two campaigns in Syria) and Thutmosis IV and the
Egyptian empire was kept secure throughout the reign of Amenophis III. The decline
of this empire would only begin during the reign of Amenophis IV (Akhenaten), the



94
so-called ‘Amarna Period.’ Horemheb, whose reign served as a transitional period
between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties pursued a foreign policy which
partially restored Egypt’s domination over Syro-Palestine (Sweeney 2007:116-117).
The first two kings of the Nineteenth Dynasty, Rameses I and his son Sethos I
continued the policies of Horemheb and Sethos I pushed the boundaries of the
Egyptian Empire to the Orontes. This empire was stabile during the long reign of
Rameses II and the stalemate with the Hittites at the battle of Kadesh resulted in the
retention by Egypt of its Syro-Palestine territories. His successor Merneptah boasted
about forays into Palestine (as related on the famous ‘Israel stele’). During his reign,
however, the threats of the Sea Peoples emerged and although he secured a decisive
victory, the end of the Egyptian Empire was approaching. During years 5, 8 and 11 of
the reign of Rameses III, the second king of the Twentieth Dynasty, a series of attacks
were made by the Sea Peoples in coalition with the Libyans. Rameses III won the
decisive battle to preserve the safety of Egypt itself, but presaged her downfall as an
imperial power. Except for a few modest forays into southern Palestine, Rameses III
had to content himself with keeping up trade relations with Syro-Palestine. He was
succeeded by eight kings, all called Rameses until the end of the Twentieth Dynasty
(Eiddon et al 1970:190). In this period Egypt lost the last remnants of its Asian
empire and internally the stability started to disintegrate and the fragmentation of the
country started. The king started to lose control and the priests of Amun at Thebes
became more powerful.
As a result of Egypt’s imperialism during the New Kingdom, it was the period of the
longest continuous presence of Egypt in Syro-Palestine (nearly 500 years). During



95
this time Egyptian military garrisons and envoys were permanently established in the
region. Most of the seals (anepigraphic) discovered in this region which contain
Egyptian motifs, date from this period and it was probably during this period that the
most cultural exchanges between Egypt and Syro-Palestine occurred. Thutmosis III
imported Canaanite deities such as Baal and Astarte into the Egyptian pantheon of
gods. During the reign of Amenophis II, the cults of the Canaanite gods Reshep and
Astarte were strongly propagated in Egypt (Bryan 2003:76).
It is most probably also the period when a tradition of Egyptian motifs on local seals
took root and which culminated in the epigraphic seals during Iron IIB and C
containing such motifs. Since most of these motifs have a religious connotation, I will
deal with the basics of Egyptian religion during this period (the New Kingdom) under
a separate heading (see paragraph 4.4.4 hereinafter).
It should be noted that during the 18th Dynasty when a family of Theban princes,
beginning with Ahmosis, became kings of Egypt, the cult of Amun reached
unprecedented proportions. Amun, after he had absorbed the characteristics of the sun
god Ra to become Amun-Ra, except for the short Amarna-interlude when Akhenaten
banned the worship of all gods except the Aten, retained the important status of
‘Father of the Gods’ and ‘ruler of Egypt and the peoples of its empire’ throughout the
rest of the history of Egypt (David 1999:104). His temple complex at Karnak became
the largest religious centre in the history of mankind.



96
4.3.8 Third Intermediate Period (ca.1085-664 B.C.E.)
This period which lasted for nearly four hundred years comprises of Dynasties XXI to
XXV. It refers to the time in Egypt from the death of Pharaoh Rameses XI of the
Twentieth Dynasty in 1085 B.C.E. to the foundation of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty by
Psamtek I in 664 B.C.E., following the expulsion of the Nubian rulers of the Twenty
Fifth Dynasty. This period in Egyptian history is important for purposes of this study
for it corresponds for the most part with the periods (Iron IIB and C) which are the
subject of this study. The period in Palestine from the time of King Jeroboam till the
time of King Hezekiah corresponds with the Twenty-Second to the Twenty-Fourth
Dynasties in Egypt (Schipper 1999:117). This period will therefore be dealt with in
more detail than the other periods. For most of this period of four hundred years it
seems that Israel (later Israel and Judah) and Egypt were allies (Porten 1984:373).
The first phase of the Third Intermediate Period started prior to the Twenty-First
Dynasty during the reign of Rameses XI, the last king of the Twentieth Dynasty. As
mentioned in the previous paragraph, the Egyptian control was not fragmented during
the 21st and 22nd Dynasties, but the fragmentation already occurred during the
Twentieth Dynasty. The country was divided administratively between the north and
south during much of this time, but the rulers evidently considered the god Amun
himself as king of a united Egypt. Even to outsiders, Egypt appeared to be ruled by
only one king and this situation actually began during the reign of Rameses XI. The
main players at the beginning of this era consisted of Rameses XI and Smendes in the
north and Herihor in the south. It is extremely likely that all of these individuals were
connected through some sort of family relationship, though that remains very unclear.



97
Herihor, a general and High-Priest of Amun at Thebes, appears to have taken
effective control of southern Egypt some years prior to the death of Rameses XI and
even during Rameses XI's life Smendes in the north seems to have held considerable
power. But the south was henceforth effectively ruled by the Amun-priests from
Thebes (Grimal 1994:314; James 1983:69).
The rise of Herihor ushered in a period known as the wehem meswt (he who repeats
births), alluding to what was supposed to be a new era of Egyptian strength, a term
previously used by the founders of new dynasties, but in fact this ‘renaissance’
actually led the country directly into the Third Intermediate Period (Wendel
2009:105-106).
During some periods of the 21st and 22nd Dynasties, Egypt seems to have regained
some of its power that was lost during the later part of the New Kingdom. Herihor
died about five years before Rameses XI and was replaced by Piankhy (Kemp
1991:343), who may have been his son-in-law. Both Piankhy and Rameses XI seem
to have died at about the same time, ushering in the traditional 21st Dynasty, when
Smendes gained the throne in the north and Pinedjem I, the son of Piankhy, became
High-Priest of Amun in the south at Thebes (Trigger 1983:232-233).
Throughout this period, the High-Priests of Amun, while firmly in control of the
south, nominally deferred to the northern king, allowing him to rule, at least in name,
the whole of Egypt. In fact, upon Smendes' death and after the short reign of
Amenemnisu in the north, one of Pinedjem I's sons, Psunsennes I, became the
northern king while several other sons successively became the High-Priests of Amun
at Thebes, a situation not at all like that in previous intermediate periods. There seems



98
to have been considerable co-operation between the two leaders and a relatively
productive period set in (Sweeney 2008:25-27).
This period ended with the death of Psunsennes II, after which Sheshonq I came to
power in the north, apparently by marrying the daughter of Psunsennes II. Sheshonq I
was a Libyan by descent (Dodson 2000:159). He was the leader of the Libyan
community that had first come to Egypt partly as slave-prisoners from the armies
defeated by Rameses III, partly as mercenaries hired by the Egyptians. His power
centre was Herakleopolis in Middle Egypt, between Thebes and the Delta, and he
found it easy to extend his power northwards, eventually making his capital at
Bubastis (Grimal 1994:322).
Sheshonq I brought the divided factions of Thebes and Tanis together. He appointed
his own son, Iuput, as Governor of Upper Egypt and at the same time both High
Priest of Amun and commander-in-chief of the armies (Fazzini 1988:4). Hence,
though history continues to refer to this as an intermediate period, the country by this
time was undivided. Sheshonq I (Shishak of the Bible) in 925 B.C.E. went on a
highly successful military campaign to Palestine, the first of such campaigns since the
time of Rameses III early in the 20th Dynasty (Schipper 1999:119).
Sheshonq’s purpose was limited and definite: to gain political and commercial
security by subduing his immediate neighbours. He made no attempt to revive the
empire of Thutmosis III, Sethos I or Rameses II (Schipper 1999:119-132).
Sheshonq’s son, Osorkon I, attempted to emulate his father’s successes in Palestine,
but his forces under the Ethiopian general Zerah were soundly defeated by the forces



99
of King Asa of Judah ca.. 897 B.C.E. (2 Chr 14:9-15; Schipper 1999:133-139). This
defeat spelt the end of Egypt’s expansionist policy in Asia.
For a period of time Egypt appeared to have remained united and only later was once
again divided. At the end of the 22nd Dynasty we really see a breakdown in power
under the long reign of Sheshonq III, which might be said to have signalled the start
of the real Third Intermediate Period. All together, the 21st and 22nd Dynasties
appear to have been more successful and even somewhat more lucrative than the last
years of the New Kingdom. Though men divided the administration of Egypt, they
saw not a divided Egypt so much as one ruled by a kingly god, Amun. During the
reign of Sheshonq III strong forces of separatism arose and an increasing number of
autonomous princes began to establish themselves. By the middle of the eight century
B.C.E., during a period known as the ‘Libyan Anarchy’, no fewer than nine kingdoms
and principalities (collectively known as the Twenty-Third Dynasty) co-existed in
Egypt (Silverman 2003:37).
The Twenty-Fourth Dynasty lasted only for a brief period (approximately 15 years) of
two kings ruling. Its founder was Tefnakhte, the local prince or governor of the Delta
city of Sais, who made himself master of the Delta, taking Bubastis and Tanis, and
then moved on Upper Egypt, capturing Hermopolis and Memphis, but during his
siege of Herakleopolis the Nubian invasion brought his venture to a sudden halt. On
the departure of the Nubians, he regained control of Lower Egypt and was succeeded
by his son, Bocchoris, who ruled well. He was favourably remembered, but his rule
ended with the return of the Nubians, who are reputed to have captured him and
burned him alive (Kessler 1996:31; Kaiser 1998:368). This brought an end to the



100
Third Intermediate Period. Throughout this period the role of Amun as the most
important deity of Egypt seems to have continued
I emphasised the contact between Egypt and Syro-Palestine during the New Kingdom
for a very important reason. Except for the excursions of Sheshonq I and his son,
Osorkon I, no military invasions were made by the Egyptians into Syro-Palestine
during the Third Intermediate Period. Internal fragmentation and unrest prohibited
any foreign policy ‘... in der an eine aktive Aussenpolitik Ägyptens nicht zu denken
war’ (Schipper 1999:141). During this period there could not have been significant
cultural exchanges between Egypt and Syro-Palestine (in particular Israel and Judah),
at least not politically. One has to accept, however, that contact in trade and on
personal level continued especially through Phoenicia. Due to the long period
involved it seems that most of the cultural elements in Israel and Judah during Iron
IIB and C, which had their roots in Egypt, were probably the result of cultural
exchanges earlier during the New Kingdom.
4.3.9 The Late Dynastic Period (ca. 664-332 B.C.E.)
In this era a large section of Egypt was ruled by the Nubians. Then came the Saites
which were mere puppets for the Assyrians. However, between these dynasties Egypt
had a degree of stability and prosperity, together with a firm central rule and a ‘good
Nile’. Thus Egypt could make a rapid recovery from any attack because of her
population and potential for agricultural wealth.
The Twenty-Fifth Dynasty is also known as the Nubian Dynasty. Under the Libyan
kings, Nubia had ceased to be an Egyptian possession or dependency. When priest



101
kings of Thebes were attacked by the Libyans, many of the priesthood took refuge in
Nubia. The temple at Napata in Nubia became a sort of Thebes in exile. For two
centuries of Libyan domination the tradition of the Amun-Ra cult was maintained.
Egyptian language stayed the official language of the government and the Nubians
took pride that they were still Egyptians (Silverman 1991:37-38).
At approximately 747 B.C.E. the Nubian king, Piankhy, launched an invasion of
Egypt from the south. His army encountered Tefnakhte, the local prince or governor
of Sais, at Thebes and defeated him there, then fought their way on down-river,
taking Hermopolis, Memphis and finally overrunning the Delta. The Egyptians made
submission to Piankhy. Tefnakhte, on his surrender, was treated honorably by the
Nubian king. Then, his conquest complete, Piankhy and his army abandoned Egypt
and returned up the Nile to their distant capital. No attempt was made to leave an
administration. The last king of the Libyan Dynasty, Osorkon V, re-occupied Thebes
and set up his own rule again. Tefnakhte temporarily resumed his control of Memphis
and the Delta (Redford 2006: 72-73).
The temporary reinstatement of the Twenty-Fourth Dynasty did not last long. In
approximately 716 B.C.E. Piankhy’s son and successor, Shabaka (ruled 716-702
B.C.E.) reinvaded Egypt with a more permanent purpose. He effectively brought the
Libyan Dynasty (the Twenty-Fourth Dynasty) to an end and set up his capital at
Thebes. He apparently was a pious king and during his reign temples and shrines
were renovated and new ones built (especially for the Memphis god Ptah) throughout
the country. He made a treaty with the Assyrians, avoiding war on that front (Kitchen
2006:95; Myśliwiec 2000:88-90).



102
His successor was Shebiktu (ruled 702-690 B.C.E.), during whose reign confrontation
with the Assyria could not be avoided and an alliance was made with the kingdom of
Judah (Schipper 1999:205; Kaiser 1998:268). This alliance probably led to closer
relationships between Egypt and Judah, politically, commercially as well as on
personal levels with (probably) cultural exchanges. Shebiktu’s uncle, Taharqa, led an
army into Palestine where Sennacherib, king of Assyria, was besieging Jerusalem. At
this time the Assyrians were struck by a mysterious plague and war was again
delayed (Kitchen 2006:95).
In 690 B.C.E., Taharqa had Shebiktu assassinated and assumed the throne himself.
He moved his capital to Tanis in the eastern Delta, from which forward position he
hoped to mount an empire-building campaign into Asia. Taharqa was an efficient
administrator and planner. Military governors were installed at Thebes and Napta.
In 671 B.C.E. the Assyrian king, Esarhaddon, finally launched a direct attack on
Egypt. Whilst Taharqa awaited him in the Delta, the Assyrian marched directly on
Memphis, capturing the city and cutting the Egyptians’ lines of communication.
Taharqa’s family was captured by the Assyrians and the Pharaoh himself fled back to
Nubia (Boardman 1991:694-698).
Esarhaddon by now had captured a great deal of the Middle East and did not remain
in Egypt. Thus, Taharqa returned and retook Memphis. His possession was only for a
few years before Esarhaddon’s successor, Assurbanipal, came with a vast force and
captured Memphis and Thebes. Taharqa died in 664 B.C.E. and was followed by
Tantamani (ruled 664-656 B.C.E.). He invaded Egypt from Napata in order to drive



103
out the Assyrians, but Assurbanipal forced him back into Nubia. The Nubian Dynasty
was at an end (James 1983:74).
The Nubians regarded themselves as Egyptians and was Egyptianised enough to
maintain classical Egyptian cultural and religious practices (Silverman 1991:38).
Devotion to Amun continued but the other national gods of Egypt were not neglected
(James 1983:73). The Nubian kings, however, abolished the post of High Priests of
Amun and instead appointed their own daughters high priestesses, also called
consorts of Amun or God’s wives of Amun (Mosjow 2005:950). The position God’s
wife of Amun in the temple of Amun at Karnak was a very important position. It was
usually held by a daughter of the king and she would never marry but adopt her
successor. Although her true role in the temple is not known, she probably
participated in some of the temple rituals. The role of God’s wife had its origins at the
beginning of the New Kingdom when King Ahmosis bestowed this title on his wife.
Later during the Eighteenth Dynasty Queen Hatshepsut carried this title before she
became Pharaoh. This office disappeared to be revived during the Twenty-Fifth
Dynasty in another form where the ‘God’s wife’ had to remain celibate (Silverman
1991:87). During this period this function of ‘God’s wife’ was politically very
important in view of the great possession she owned and administered (Bresciani
1984:371). Furthermore there was a burgeoning Osiris-cult and several chapels for
the worship of this god were erected at Karnak (Redford 2006:132). The Nubians also
revived religious cult and ritual of the Old Kingdom (Sweeney 2006:45).
The first king of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty was Necho I (who ruled from 672 to 664
B.C.E.) and he was installed by the Assyrians. He was a descendant of king



104
Tefnakhte. He collaborated with the Assyrian kings Sennacherib and Assurbanipal
and had been rewarded with gold and the honor of being enthroned as a puppet king.
His capital was Sais and this dynasty is referred to as the Saite Dynasty. They
regarded themselves as rightful successors to the Egyptian throne which had been
neglected by the descendants of Rameses II (Grimal 1994:365). Necho’s son and
successor, Psammetichus I, shook off the dominion of the Assyrians and re
established an independent Egypt. He made careful moves in order to establish his
own control in Upper Egypt whose spiritual leader, the chief priestess of Amun or
‘God’s wife’, was Amenirdis II, who was a daughter of the great Piankhy. He
persuaded her to adopt his own daughter Nitiqret as her successor, once again
showing the political importance of the office, for through this agreement the
allegiance was changed peacefully from the Twenty-Fifth to the Twenty-Sixth
Dynasty (Sidebotham, Hense & Nouwens 2008:15; Robins 1993:154,156). The
Egyptians started to rid themselves of Assyrian influences and to revive their old
ways and religion.
Necho II (ruled 610-595 B.C.E.), the son of Psammetichus, pursued an ambitious
foreign policy. He made allies with the Assyrians against the Babylonians and sent an
expedition to Syria to assist the Assyrians against the Babylonians. At Megiddo his
army was confronted by the army of the Judahite king Josiah. It seems that Judah at
that time was an Egyptian vassal state, although it has not yet been established
beyond reasonable doubt (Schipper 1999:235). During the battle King Josiah was
killed and the Judahite army destroyed, after which the Egyptians marched into Syria
(Sykes 2003:127; Cf. Cline 2002:90).



105
Necho’s successor, Psammetichus II (ruled 595-589 B.C.E.), appeared to have been
more interested in keeping the Nubians at bay and he sent an expedition as far south
as the second cataract. His successor, Apries (ruled 589-570 B.C.E.), attacked the
Phoenician cities of Tyre and Sidon, probably as a result of trading disputes. In 570
B.C.E. Apries was overthrown by his own general, Amasis (ruled 570-526 B.C.E.),
who repulsed a Babylonian attack and kept Egypt in prosperity (Myśliwiec
Later, as a result of the threat of the Persians, Amasis was obliged to make an alliance
with the Babylonians. During the short reign of Psammetichus III (526-525 B.C.E.),
the Persians, guided across the Sinai desert by the Bedouins and assisted by the
treacherous Greek mercenaries, comprehensively defeated the Egyptians at Pelusium
and Psammetichus III committed suicide (Boardman et al 1988:48).
2000:120). Stelae found in Phoenicia of Psammetichus II and Necho II indicate that
during that period Phoenicia was controlled by Egypt (Nʼaaman 2006:308). During
the reign of Apries Jerusalem was destroyed by the Babylonians in 587 B.C.E.
During the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty we find one of the best examples in history of
foreigners settling in the Delta-region. Not only were there Greek commercial
colonies, but large numbers of Judahite migrants were found there (Finkelstein &
Silberman 2002:66). Some of these Judahites (during the latter part of the Dynasty)
could have been fugitives from the Babylonian occupation of Judah. In the history of
Judah as a separate kingdom it seems that during the Twenty-Second and Twenty
Sixth Dynasty (especially during the first eighty years) the best opportunities for
cultural exchanges between Egypt and Judah existed. When scholars allege that Judah
was influenced by Egypt it was most probably during the Third Intermediate Period,



106
especially the Twenty-Second Dynasty and the period of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty
of the Late Dynastic Period before the exile of the Judahites. The Egyptian religion
during the Twenty-Second Dynasty was a continuation of the concepts developed
during the New Kingdom, but during the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty the Saite rulers
revolutionized the religion. In the premises I will briefly deal with Egyptian religion
during the New Kingdom and the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty.
4.4. EGYPTIAN RELIGION DURING RELEVANT PERIODS
4.4.1 The Eighteenth to Twentieth Dynasties
I have indicated in the previous paragraph that on a balance of probabilities the
closest contact between Egypt and Syro-Palestine occurred during the zenith of the
Egyptian empire, which lasted for nearly five hundred years from the Eighteenth to
the early part of the Twentieth Dynasty. Continuous Egyptian presence in Syro
Palestine would have made regular cultural exchanges unavoidable.
It is highly improbable that the monotheistic Aten-religion during the Amarna-period
at the end of the Eighteenth Dynasty would have played a significant role in any
cultural exchanges between Egypt and Syro-Palestine as such. On the other hand the
Amarna-period is the focal point of the ancient Near East. During this period there
occurred unprecedented international contacts and the cultural resources of the
Egyptians, Assyrians, Babylonians, Hittites, Hurrians, Caphtorians, Canaanites and
numerous other ethnic elements intermingled. The hub of all these activities was
Canaan and the Hebrews came at just the right time to inherit the maximum cultural
legacy of the Near East. The Hebrews in the region ran their course between the



107
Amarna-Period and the Hellenistic Period. Although the Amarna-period lasted for a
only a short while (approximately 15 years) it changed the course of history (Gordon
and Rendsburg 1997:82-83). During that period, however, the relationship between
Egypt and Syro-Palestine deteriorated, especially as a result of the lack of concern of
Akhenaten (Amenophis IV) regarding Egypt’s empire status and in particular
developments in Syro-Palestine (Najovits 2004:127; Kuhrt 1997:194-198). After the
demise of the Aten-religion, Horemheb reinstated the previous religion of Egypt,
especially the state religion of Amun-Ra (Najovits 2004:129).
I will therefore ignore the short, but interesting, Amarna-interlude for purposes of this
study and concentrate on the main trends of Egyptian religion during the time of the
New Kingdom.
An interesting outcome of the preceding Hyksos-interlude was that a new vision
regarding religion developed in Egypt. The Hyksos identified their main god with the
Egyptian god Seth, the god of warfare and chaos. This acceptance of an Egyptian god
by a foreign power ruling a major portion of Egypt resulted in the incorporation of
gods of conquered territories into the Egyptian pantheon throughout the period of the
New Kingdom (Meskell 2002:27).
Despite the presence of new foreign gods, the Egyptians continued to identify with a
principal god, the patron god of the Theban rulers, Amun-Ra. During the Eighteenth
Dynasty before the amalgamation of Amun and Ra, the three gods Amun, Ra and
Ptah actually formed a triad (Baines 1991:188). Amun as the main god of Thebes,
within the context of divine kingship, became as a result of the emergence of the
Theban kings, a Theban manifestation of Ra and henceforth became Amun-Ra. The



108
theologies of Heliopolis and Thebes were integrated (Troy 2006:124). Extensive
building projects were undertaken at Thebes, Amun-Ra’s cult centre, reaching their
height during the reign of Amenophis III of the Eighteenth Dynasty and Rameses II
of the Nineteenth Dynasty. In addition to Amun’s pre-eminence throughout most of
the New Kingdom, allegiance to local gods was equally important. The priesthood of
Amun was actively involved in the government and came to assume great
importance.
During this period nearly all the traditional gods and goddesses are officially
worshipped. Hathor was initially seen as the consort of Amun, but she was gradually
replaced in this capacity by Mut, who finally, during this period, became the ‘mother
of the gods’, a title originally granted to Hathor. Other gods and goddesses who
played a prominent official role were inter alia Horus, Ptah, Thoth, Wadjit, Sakhmet,
Ma’at, Montu, Osiris, Isis, Anubis, Seth, Khnum, Khonsu and Buto (Troy 2006:125
129).
The king as priest was responsible for the independent exchange between the mortal
and divine worlds, a duty which he fulfilled by means of ritual offerings. Each temple
served as the residence of a primary deity and each god was theoretically entitled to a
daily ritual that renewed the life of the god inhabiting the cult statue or effigy. In
practise these rituals were performed by priests who received their divine authority
from the king (Troy 2006:135-136).
At the same time religion became increasingly personal, with more ways for ordinary
people to communicate with the gods―through worship at local chapels and
community shrines, pilgrimages to great temples during festival times, the



109
maintenance of statuettes of deities in local settings. The vast majority of scarab seals
during this period no longer functioned as seals but had the purely amuletic and
religious purpose ‘of providing protection, attracting good luck or associating their
wearers with desired powers or conditions’ (Andrews 1994:55).
Scenes with deities offered protection and demonstrate divine patronage or the
wearer’s special devotion. Not only are all the chief gods and goddesses, such as
Amun-Ra, Mut, Khonsu, Horus, Hathor, Osiris, Isis, Thoth, Ptah, and Anubis
represented, but also household deities (where Bes is a favourite). We find the same
tendency during Iron II in Syro-Palestine (see Chapters 5 and 6). Even those gods,
who hitherto had rarely been represented, such as Haapi, the Nile god, Astarte, the
imported Canaanite goddess of love and war and Reshep, the imported Canaanite
warrior god, are represented on these scarabs (Andrews 1994:55; Meskell 2002:21).
Sometimes it was regarded as sufficient protection just to include the name of a god
or a king in an inscription on a seal, especially if the king’s name was accompanied
by a potent epithet such as ‘smiter of the Nine Bows’ (Egypt’s traditional enemies),
‘trampler of foreign land’, ‘builder of monuments’ etcetera (Andrews 1994:55).
As a result of cultural exchanges similar scarabs probably became of amuletic (or
religious) importance during this time in Syro-Palestine. This may account for the
multitude of anepigraphic seal-amulets dating to the Late Bronze Age and Iron I and
II (as well as epigraphic seals during Iron IIB and C) discovered in Palestine and
which contain similar iconography as those Egyptian ones dating to the New
Kingdom.



110
4.4.2 The Twenty-Sixth Dynasty
During the Third Intermediate Period one finds that the rulers of Egypt adhered to the
same gods as those revered during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties.
Sheshonq I, for instance served Amun, Mut, Horus, Atum and Ptah, important state
gods during the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties (Tiele 2009:189). During the
Late Dynastic Period (beginning with the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty of the Nubians and
later the Saites of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty) there came changes in the New
Kingdom concepts of religion.
As already stated in paragraph 4.3.9 above, Psammetichus I, after he had shaken off
the dominion of the Assyrians and re-established an independent Egypt, made careful
moves in order to establish his own control in Upper Egypt, whose spiritual leader,
the chief priestess of Amun (or God’s wife) was a daughter of the great Piankhy. The
Egyptians started to rid themselves of Assyrian influences and revive their old ways
and religion.
‘As has often been discussed, the Pharaohs of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty launched a
campaign to restore the culture of the old days, in art, literature, religion, and so on.
This cultural “renaissance” very appropriately served as a landmark for the eventual
loss of traditional Egyptian culture’ (Poo 2005:138).
The term ‘old days’ is really a very vague statement and is not completely borne out
by the events which are described as ‘the renaissance’. It seems that the Saites
embarked on a mission to revive gods (‘dead gods’) that for centuries had played no
prominent role in the Egyptian pantheon, thus returning to an archaic period
(Assmann & Jenkins 2003:362). In Sais, Neith, a goddess of the hunt, who dated back



111
to the First Dynasty, was regarded as the oldest, the creator goddess and the leader of
all the gods. According to Johnson (1994:132) she was known as the ‘Oldest One’.
Her symbol is the shield with the crossed arrows (Geddes & Grosset 1997:408; Hart
2002:100; Edwards 1970:493; Ellis 1999:115). When the Saite princes became the
rulers of the whole of Egypt, Neith replaced the long-time state deity, Amun-Ra, at
the head of the pantheon as the ruler of all the gods. She seems to have retained the
place at the head of the pantheon until the time of the Ptolemies (Lesko 1999:58;
Wendel 2009:125; Cf. Pinch 2004:34).
The office of ‘God’s wife’ at the temple of Karnak, in view of its political
importance, was retained. Despite the official state religion, the ordinary people of
Egypt, in addition to their veneration of local and household gods, continued to center
their religion on Amun-Ra and Osiris. The cultic worship of animals also became
very popular (Lesko 1991:112).
These religious changes in Egypt during the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty do not appear to
be reflected on Egyptian religious symbolism which appears on contemporary seal
amulets from Israel and Judah. This may indicate that no important cultural
exchanges between Egypt and Judah occurred during this period or that cultural
exchanges involving religious concepts were confined on the level of ordinary
citizens who did not accept the changes initiated by the rulers. I venture the opinion
that the Egyptian religious symbolism on Hebrew seals during Iron IIB and C was
probably the result of cultural exchanges during the New Kingdom and in particular
the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties.



112
4.5 CONCLUSION
In this chapter I have briefly investigated the contact between ancient Egypt and
Syro-Palestine during which contact cultural exchanges could have occurred. During
the Dynastic Period, preceding the Eighteenth Dynasty, Egypt’s presence in Syro
Palestine was confined to commerce and occasional military raids. For approximately
one hundred years an Asiatic people, the Hyksos, probably from Canaan or Syria,
occupied a large portion of Egypt. Cultural exchanges would have been unavoidable,
but the extent of such exchanges has not been established, except that the Hyksos
associated their main god with the Egyptian god Seth and also accepted other
Egyptian gods.
After the Hyksos had been driven from Egypt at the beginning of the Eighteenth
Dynasty, the beginning of the New Kingdom, Egypt’s foreign policy changed
dramatically in that the rulers now started to establish an Egyptian empire, which
included Syro-Palestine. This empire lasted for nearly five hundred years and during
this period, with a continuous Egyptian presence in Syro-Palestine, the best
opportunity for cultural exchanges was created. Syrian gods such as Baal, Astarte and
Reshef were imported into the Egyptian pantheon, especially by Thutmosis III. I also
made the point that during the Third Intermediate Period in Egypt the basic religious
concepts of the New Kingdom were retained. It was only during the Twenty-Fifth
Dynasty (the abolition of the office of High Priest of Amun who was replaced by a
God’s wife) and the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty (Neith as principal goddess and the
reinstatement of various archaic concepts) that drastic changes to the New Kingdom



113
religion were introduced. I conclude that these latter changes do not appear to have
been incorporated in the Egyptian symbolism on Hebrew seals.
I also briefly looked at relevant Egyptian religious concepts and symbolism and the
importance of seal-amulets as a religious or cult object and the role magic played in
the religion of the ordinary Egyptians. I concentrated on deities that were prominent
during the New Kingdom, the Third Intermediate Period and the first part of the Late
Dynastic Period.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish the most likely periods of cultural
exchanges between Egypt and Syro-Palestine and to lay a foundation to understand
Egyptian symbolism on seals from Israel and Judah during Iron IIB and C.
Scholars aver that during the time of the divided monarchy of the Israelites, Israel
was influenced by Phoenicia and Judah by Egypt.
It should be emphasised that Egypt’s influence in the Levant from the Chalcolithic to
Iron Age II, whether directly through military invasion and settlement or indirectly
through trade, cannot be underestimated. The Egyptians left their mark not only on
the Israelites but also on other nations such as the Canaanites, Moabites, Edomites,
Ammonites and finally on the Phoenicians. When it is suggested that Israel was
influenced by the Phoenicians, one should also investigate if this influence, especially
with regard to seal iconography, which is the subject of this study, is not the result of
earlier cultural exchanges between Egypt and Phoenicia (or their predecessors) and
that Israel was therefore indirectly influenced by Egypt via Phoenicia. This could
only be established by investigating contemporary Phoenician seals and which I will
do in the next chapter.



114
CHAPTER 5
EGYPTIAN SYMBOLISM ON PHOENICIAN SEALS DURING IRON IIB
AND C
5.1 INTRODUCTION
The Phoenicians, who apparently developed from the remnants of the Canaanites,
during Iron II, were initially settled along the Mediterranean coastline of present day
Lebanon and the northern part of the same coastline of present Israel. The first sea
voyages of which we have direct knowledge, were undertaken by the Egyptians, but
‘the people to whom the art of navigation was most indebted, who excelled all others
in nautical skill, and who carried the spirit of adventure far beyond any contemporary
nation, were the Phoenicians...’ (Wilkinson 1847a:213-214). ‘As explorers in
antiquity, the Phoenicians were second to none’ (Harden 1963:20). ‘Phoenician
sailors mastered the waterways, braving treacherous winds and reefs to explore paths
previously uncharted’ (Markoe 2000:12).
They were the first people to make extensive use of seafaring for trade purposes and
thus played a major role in the development of the ancient world
‘Thanks to the Phoenician expansion, the different regions and populations of the
Mediterranean basin were linked together for the first time in the framework of
intense communication and trading networks, which bound extensive zones of
production and supply, as never before, with the great centres of demand for raw
materials’ (Aubet 2001:305).



115
Figure 8: Commercial network of the Phoenician expansion in the Mediterranean.
(Aubet 2001:160)
From the Bible it appears that close relationships existed between the kings of the
United Kingdom of Israel, David and Solomon, and the king of Tyre, Hiram (1 Ki
5:1-18; 9:10). During the Divided Monarchy, King Ahab of Israel married the
daughter of Ethbaal, the king of another Phoenician city, Sidon (1 Ki 16:31) and
cultural exchanges between Israel and the city states of Phoenicia would have been
unavoidable.
Large numbers of Phoenicians migrated to other parts of the known world, some of
them settled on the northern Mediterranean coastline of Africa at places like Carthage
and Utica; others on the southern coastline of Europe, for instance Italy, as well as
Mediterranean islands (such as Sicily and Cyprus).
An inherent danger in a discussion of peoples like the Canaanites35 and the
35 This diversity of city states is especially evident in the Amarna letters where the vassal Canaanite rulers are continuously complaining about the threats and conduct of other such states and in which letters the Egyptian pharaoh is requested for assistance.



116
Phoenicians is to approach the subject from the vantage point of a sovereign and/or
united nation.
When one considers ‘the Phoenicians’, one should continuously keep in mind that
several city states were involved where each one apparently had its own pantheon of
gods and where the principal gods of Byblos was not necessarily the same as those of
other cities such as Tyre and Sidon (Peckham 1987:79-80; Aubet 2001:152).
Another problem is the lack of direct textual evidence of the history of the
Phoenicians. Iron Age texts from mainland Phoenicia for the most part are funerary
documents or are concerned with the building and repair of temples and the
dedication of objects to the gods. ‘Much of what is recorded about Iron Age
Phoenicia comes from Greek and Roman historians, the Old Testament,
Mesopotamian and Egyptian records and myths and legends from Homer...’ (Ward
2004:184; Cf. Aubet 2001:11-13).
What seems to be clear, as discussed in chapters 1 and 4 above, is that from the
earliest times there was continuous contact between Egypt and Syro-Palestine,
including those areas later occupied by the Phoenicians, being the descendants of the
Canaanites. These contact situations inevitably led to cultural exchanges. A prime
example, as discussed in chapter 4 above (see p.95), is the importation into Egypt by
Thutmosis III of Syrian (Canaanite) gods. One would expect these exchanges not to
be unilateral but that the conquered nations (including the Canaanites, the later
Phoenicians) would also accept some of the religious concepts of the conqueror,
Egypt.



117
5.2 EGYPTIAN RELGIOUS SYMBOLS ON PHOENICIAN SEALS
Despite thousands of Phoenician inscriptions that have been discovered, relatively
few relate to Phoenician religious concepts and rituals. Although the major gods are
mentioned, their nature and function are unknown. The ruins of temples do not reveal
the cults and rituals that were practised in them (Ward 2004:201).
Another problem, in addition to the lack of Phoenician literature, contributing to the
fact that we know less about Phoenician religion than most of the other nations of
antiquity, is that we ‘cannot always differentiate between true Phoenician elements
and borrowings from other cults. The long-standing Egyptian influence―and at times
domination―in the Syrian coastal cities brought with it much contact with Egyptian
religion’ (Harden 1963:84).
Some of the gods and goddesses in the earlier Canaanite pantheon show remarkable
resemblances to certain Egyptian gods. This is more fully discussed, where relevant,
during the analysis of some of the seals. Furthermore the Phoenicians sometimes
associated their gods with Egyptian counterparts, giving their own gods attributes and
characteristics previously peculiar to the gods of the much older civilization. It also
seems that when the situation required it, they simply borrowed Egyptian gods or
gods from other nations without association with gods of their own pantheons36. The
traditional views on Phoenicia are that it had far fewer gods in their pantheon than for
instance a country like Egypt.
36 The choice of the plural ‘pantheons’ is deliberate because every city state had its own pantheon and although there are similarities, the emphasis on the importance of certain gods varied from city to city. King Hiram of Tyre introduced a new god, Melqart, as the principal deity of the city. The other cities do not seem to have followed suit. Phoenician religion was not static but changed as it was influenced by their contact with other nations, whether forced by invasion or the result of friendly contact. Thus, Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek and Roman influences found their way into Phoenician religion.



118
Here again I want to extend a cautionary note; one should be careful not to generalise
and confine oneself to texts and inscriptions. From the iconography on Phoenician
seals it appears that their pantheon was much more extensive than suggested by the
meagre written evidence available to us. I submit that a comprehensive study of
Phoenician seals will reveal many more gods, most of whom were ‘borrowed’ from
Egypt. The scope of this study, however, does not allow for such an extensive
investigation. I shall, while analysing a few Phoenician seals later in this chapter,
endeavour to point out those gods who do not seem to be associated with known
Phoenician gods.
The worship of these foreign, mostly Egyptian gods has a cumulative effect in that it
would also have influenced those other nations with who the Phoenicians were in
close contact, like the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the ninth and eighth
centuries (Cf. Miller & Hayes 1986: 267).
We are mainly acquainted with the Canaanite/ Phoenician religion from the middle of
the 2nd
‘The Ugaritic texts have taught us much about the mythology and religion accepted at
Ugarit in the Late Bonze Age, but we have no comparable sources for Phoenicia
proper’ (Baumgarten 1981:262). Our knowledge of the Phoenician religion during
Iron IIB and C is very sketchy and for the most part based on Philo of Byblos and a
small number of inscriptions (Azize 2005:5).
millennium to approximately the beginning of the 1st millennium B.C.E. as a
result of the discovery of the clay tablets at Ugarit (Bonanno 1986:186).
Despite these limitations it has been said that the religion of the Phoenicians is of the
utmost importance, as relating to a people who were the most polished of the Semitic



119
tribes, and exercised the greatest and most lasting influence on the civilization of the
ancient world, partly by means of their commercial relations and partly through the
extensive migrations of Phoenician tribes’ (Cf. Ball 2001: 442; Bondi 2001:42-43).
Despite this influence by the Phoenicians on other nations it was not one-sided; their
commercial intercourse with other peoples is clearly reflected in the development of
their own religion and mythology (Cf. Aubet 2001:354-355; Marti 2009:96; Albright
1980:10; Hitti 2004:125; Bondi 2001:24).
In Phoenician religion there was a variety of dying and rising gods. One of these was
Adonis who was mostly revered at the city of Byblos. His name means simply the
title ‘Lord’ which title is also found as Adonai in the religion of Israel (Smart
1998:209).
Many of the gods they worshiped were localized and are now known only under their
local names. A pantheon was presided over by the father of the gods, but a goddess
was the principal figure in the pantheons of some of the Phoenician cities. It must
again be emphasised that since there was no national Phoenician state, there was
obviously no national Phoenician pantheon (Aubet 2001:151; Barclay 2001:204).
It seems that most of the gods and goddesses of the Phoenicians were the result of
their Canaanite origins, but the importance of some of them appears to have
dwindled, while others became more important. In Canaanite tradition El was the
supreme god and king. His wife Asherah was regarded as the mother goddess.37
37As regards Asherah (mentioned in the Bible and currently the subject of much controversy, which does not form party of this study, relating to a consort of Yahweh and asherah poles and trees), Smith (2002:115) investigates the possibility that the tree was originally the symbol of this goddess. He points out, that, according to tradition, the tree was regarded as a cultic object in Phoenician religion and speculates that this tradition as well as the biblical references may point to a Canaanite tradition.



120
The chief god of Tyre was Melqart, elevated to that position by king Hiram of Tyre.
This god was not a member of the earlier Canaanite pantheon. Other Tyrian deities
The principal gods at Sidon were Astarte and Eshmun (Peckham 1987:84), while
other gods included Baal-Sidon (just another form of Baal) and Reshep.
In the religion of the Phoenician cities they were relegated to lower positions, while
Baal for instance became a supreme god in most of the cities. Astarte, who was a
relative minor goddess in the pantheon of Ugarit, became very important at Tyre and
Sidon.
38
the same goddess as Anat or Astarte, who had a long association with the city (Ward
2004:202). Baal and Baal-Shamen are also connected to the city.
At Byblos
(Gubla) the chief deity was Baalat Gubla or the ‘Mistress of Byblos’, who appears to
include Baal-Shamen and Baal- Saphon (Ward 2004:202; Markoe 2000:115-116).
Only the principal gods of some of the city states are dealt with in this chapter. Other
gods (for a more complete picture) are discussed under PHOENICIAN GODS in
ANNEXURE B.
The purpose of this chapter is, however, not to investigate the religion of the
Phoenicians but to investigate some Phoenician seals dating to Iron IIB and C to
illustrate that, despite the existence of Phoenician pantheons and an established
Phoenician religion, which apparently evolved over centuries from their Canaanite
ancestors, Egyptian religious symbolism played an important role in the iconography
of some Phoenician seals.
38 The word ‘baal’ simply means ‘lord’, for instance Lord of Sidon or Lord of Heaven or Lord of the North.



121
It seems that the Phoenicians had a limited assortment of motifs that they used again
and again, but in endless variations and compositions, on seals. During the ninth and
eighth centuries B.C.E., before the arrival of the Assyrians, there were, in addition to
local motifs, mainly two styles employed, the northern style and the southern style.
The northern style appears to have been influenced by for instance Hittite and
Aramaic prototypes. The southern style was clearly influenced by Egyptian motifs.
Depicted on these seals are various Egyptian deities such as Ra, Horus, Isis, Sekhmet,
Nepthys, Khonsu, Thoth, Ptah etcetera. In addition Egyptian emblems such as the
djed-pillar, the winged ureaus, the head of Bes, the winged sun disk, the ankh, the
lotus flower, the Horus eye (udjat) and others as the seals themselves will reveal, are
depicted. Egyptian hieroglyphs and pseudo-hieroglyphs (for the most part unreadable
and meaningless) are added. Furthermore cartouches and the figures of Egyptian
kings and ‘priests are depicted in various attitudes: fighting, standing, or leading
prisoners of war’ (Stern 2001:91).
‘The iconography of the Phoenician seal engraver reflects a strong interest in
Egyptian religious and magical themes...’ (Markoe 2000:156). If the Phoenician seal
iconography was influenced by Egyptian religious motifs and the Northern Kingdom
of Israel was influenced by Phoenicia it is obvious, in my opinion, that Israel was
indirectly influenced by Egypt via Phoenicia.

5.3 ANALYSIS OF PHOENICIAN SEALS WITH EGYPTIAN MOTIFS
5.3.1 Introduction
Although a large number seals (Phoenician47
The purpose of this section is not to give an extensive catalogue of Phoenician seals
with Egyptian iconography. This serves merely as an introduction to the subject of
this study, the Egyptian iconography on Hebrew seals. The seals chosen here are
random examples to illustrate the variety of Egyptian religious symbolism adopted by
the Phoenicians.
and Hebrew) are available, whether,
iconic, epigraphic or anepigraphic, for analysis and study, only a limited number of
Phoenician and Hebrew seals can be used to illustrate the purpose of this study.
The first three of the epigraphic seals were chosen to illustrate that despite the fact
that the owners were followers of traditional principal Phoenician gods (Astarte,
Eshmun and Baal), they still used Egyptian symbolism on their seals. The remaining
two seals were selected because they represent a high government official and a roal
person, possibly a prince. This indicates that Egyptian symbolism was employed by
the highest ranks in Phoenician society.
39
The anepigraphic seals, which probably belonged to ordinary citizens, were chosen to
illustrate that all levels of society employed Egyptian symbolism. The fact that these
are seal amulets indicate that they were regarded as having protective (or magical)
powers. These seals are not included in a particular sequence but were chosen to
illustrate the variety of Egyptian symbols used.
39 It is interesting to note that from the seventh century onwards there is a marked decline in Phoenician epigraphic seals in Phoenicia Proper, though anepigraphic seals abound. Sass and Uehlinger (1993:126) speculates that in Phoenicia only wealthy merchantmen and officials ( I submit that royalty should be included) had their names inscribed on their seals. The later extensive movement of these merchants and officials to other regions may be the reason for this decline.



123
5.3.2 Analysis of some Phoenician epigraphic seals
5.3.2.1 The seal of Ger ̔ashtart
Figure 9: The seal of Ger ̔ashtart .
(Avigad & Sass 1997:273)
a. Description
The context in which this seal was discovered is not known. According to Avigad &
Sass (1997:273), it was bought in Tartus and is currently part of a collection in Paris.
It is a scarab made of green jasper. It is perforated and its dimensions are 17 x 12 x 9
mm. It has a single-line border. It contains the following inscription (Cf. Avigad &
Sass 1197:273):
This reads: ‘Ger ̔ashtar t.’



124
As the inscription implies the owner was a follower of Astarte, the word ‘ger’ is
typical of Phoenician seals. The word ‘ger’ meant ‘protected’ or ‘protected person’,
in Phoenician society, thus indicating that the person was protected by a particular
deity (Heltzer 1987:312). In this particular instance the name of the owner implies
protection by Astarte. Astarte and Eshmun were the chief deities of Sidon (Markoe
2000:115).
The seal has a single register with various Egyptian symbols:
At the top, a winged solar disk covers (shelters or protects) a ritual scene.
In the centre is a falcon-headed ‘goddess’ in a long robe on a throne. Her left hand is
raised in blessing. Above her head is a solar disk and a uraeus. In front of her is the
god Thoth, depicted in human form with the head of an ibis. With he right hand the
goddess is either giving to or receiving from Thoth an object, which, according to
Avigad & Sass (1997:273), is a flower, but which could also be a drinking cup.
Behind her is the god Ptah, depicted in his normal form with a mummified body.
Both Thoth and Ptah have solar disks above their heads. Both these gods are not
associated with known Phoenician gods and can thus be regarded as foreign
(Egyptian) additions to the Phoenician pantheon.
The ‘floor’ of the ritual scene consists of a woven neb hieroglyph.
According to Avigad & Sass (1997:273) this seal dates to the Sixth-Fifth centuries
B.C.E.



125
b. Discussion
Although various gods are portrayed, the protective role of Ra is clearly defined. As a
winged disk he guards over the rest of the scene. The wings are not straight but are
hanging down, like those of a hen protecting her chickens, as in Figure 10 on the next
page.
Figure 10: Hen protecting her children. Mosaic from the Church of Dominus Flevit,
Mount of Olives, Jerusalem.
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
This Ra-protection is further emphasized by the solar disks above the heads of the
three other gods.
This seal has an interesting aspect in that the rarity of a falcon headed goddess is
portrayed. This may lead to various interpretations. This may be a depiction of
Haroeris (Haruris, Haroris), or Horus the Elder. Haroeris is one of the oldest forms of
the god Horus, which is already mentioned in the Pyramid Texts. It may be that a
zealous Phoenician engraver made a mistake in the dress of the god Horus, but this is



126
doubtful because the god Thoth is dressed in the correct Egyptian male attire. On the
other hand Hatshepsut called herself the ‘Female Horusʼ (Eidon et al1973:317) and
in the Roman period some people referred to Cleopatra VI as the ‘Female Horus ʼ .
There are five clues, however, which seems to provide the correct answer to the
identity of the goddess:
(i) It is a Phoenician seal;
(ii) The fact that a long robe and not a kilt is worn indicates that a goddess, rather
than a god is probably represented;
(iii) Being inscribed, it probaly belonged to an official or royal person;
(iv) The goddess has a lotus flower, signifying inter alia fertility; and
(v) The seal belongs to a follower of Astarte.
The solution therefore seems to be clear. Astarte was the goddess f fertility. This is a
depiction of Astarte associated with Horus, being the chief goddess; she is enthroned
and the taller of the three gods depicted, clearly to emphasise her superiority. Thoth,
in Egyptian mythology, was the scribe of the gods, the inventor of language, writing
and magic but also the god of medicine. Ptah was the creator of everything, including
the other gods. It was said that Horus was his heart and Thoth his tongue. During the
Late Period in Egypt (Iron IIB and C in Phoenicia and Palestine), the importance of
the latter two gods had waned and the scene on this seal seems to represent the status
quo (see a discussion of Astarte, Horus, Thoth and Ptah, with references in Annexure
B).

5.3.2.2 Seal belonging to Ger ̔Eshmun,sonof Ḥimele4k0
Figure 11: Belonging to Ger ̔Eshmun, son of Ḥ imelek .
(Avigad & Sass 1997: (273)
40 All my efforts to trace the original seal were fruitless. Professor Benjamin Sass, who revised and completed Avigad & Sass’s ‘Corpus of West Semitic Stamp Seals’ advised me by e-mail as follows: ‘If you will take a good look at the said item (733) in the book, you will immediately realize that I had the same problem as you: With no access to an original photograph, I reproduced the one in Uberti 1977, no. 2.’ It is considerably enlarged in order to capture the most detail.



128
a. Description
The find context of this seal is not known. It is currently reported to be in the Biggio
collection in Santʼ Antiocho, Italy. It is a scarab made of steatite, perforated with
dimensions 35 x 25 x 16 mm. It has a single-line border and a double-line field
divider, dividing the seal into two registers. In the bottom register is a two-line
inscription:
(Cf. Avigad & Sass 1997:273) ‘Belonging to Ger ̔Eshmun son of Ḥ imelek .’
Here again we have a ritual scene, similar to the one on the seal discussed in
paragraph 5.3.2.1. At the top of the top register there is the winged sun of Ra, with
hanging wings protecting the scene below it.
The central theme of the scene consists of a lotus flower standard:
Figure 12: Section from seal showing lotus standard
Above the lotus flower, in his normal sitting position is the sun child Harpocrates (see
Jung & Kerényi20T 2002:57:58).

130
The lotus standard is flanked (on the left) and held by a falcon-headed Khonsu, in this
depiction identical with Horus, wearing the double crown of Egypt. Holding the
standard on the other side is Isis with a horned disk. To avoid confusion with the
images of these two gods (Khonsu with Horus and Isis with Hathor), both are
identified by hieroglyphic inscriptions: ḫnsw di ̔ nḫ and 3st di ̔ nḫ (Khonsu, Isis,
given life).41
Figure 16: Section of seal showing hieroglyphics
Behind Khonsu is the goddess Sekhmet, surmounted by a solar disk and holding a
papyrus scepter with her left hand.
b. Discussion
According to the inscription the name of the seal’s owner was Ger ̔Eshmun. The
name of the chief god of Sidon (together with the chief goddess Astarte) was
Eshmun; he was also the Phoenician god of healing (comparable with Egyptian gods
such as Thoth and Imhotep). Eshmun’s temple was situated near Sidon (Cross
1994:95).
41All hieroglyphs discussed in this study are derived from Gardiner’s Sign List as contained in Gardiner 1950:438-548.



131
In this scene Eshmun is portrayed as Khonsu (both were gods of healing). The theme
of the ritual scene appears to centre on ‘life’ or ‘new life’. Khonsu was closely
associated with Horus as a protector and healer and was sometimes portrayed in the
same form as Horus. Khonsu was instrumental in the creation of new life in all living
creatures. The Sun Child symbolized awakening and new life, the lotus flower, like
Ra, represents resurrection. Isis resurrected Osiris and was also closely associated
with birth and death. Sekhmet was believed to protect the pharaoh in battle, thus a
protector of life.
As regards the papyrus sceptre held by Sekhmet:
‘To the Egyptians the green of fresh vegetation which symbolised new life and, by
extension, resurrection, was exemplified by the papyrus plant, which as the wadj or
papyrus sceptre in amuletic form was first mentioned in the Coffin Texts’ (Andrews
1994:82-83).
Figure 17: Sekhmet holding a papyrus sceptre
This symbol, therefore, also represent, life, new life and resurrection. Just to stress the
point, the hieroglyphs ‘Khonsu, Isis, given life’ also appear on the seal. On this seal,
although I have made the association between Eshmun and Khonsu, the hieroglyphs
(Shorter 1932: Plate X)



132
clearly identify Khonsu and Isis by their Egyptian names. Two other gods, not
associated with Phoenician counterparts are the sun child Harpocrates and Sekhmet.
The lotus standard and papyrus scepter are also concepts foreign to Phoenician
culture.
5.3.2.3 Seal belonging to Yaḥziba al
Figure 18: Seal of Yaḥziba al
(Avigad 1968:45)



133
a. Description
The find context of this seal is unknown and it is currently in the Borowski collection,
Jerusalem. Avigad (1968:49) dates it to not later than the eighth century.
It is a scaraboid of brown quartzite with dimensions 20 x x14 x 9 mm. It has a single
line border with no field-divider.
In the centre of the seal is a depiction of a falcon, in the form in which Horus is
normally portrayed, wearing the double crown of Egypt and looking towards the left.
The falcon is looking towards a cartouche surrounding decorative pseudo
hieroglyphs. On top of the cartouche is a strange symbol not reminiscent of any other
Egyptian symbol. Avigad (1968:49) suggests it may be the top half of an ankh. It may
be a stylized form, but my problem with that suggestion is that an ankh with its
circular of inverted conical shaped upper half easily fits into the hand of a god or
king, as it is sometimes portrayed. The shape of this particular symbol (a type of
diamond shape or parallelogram) does not make it conducive to be carried in the same
manner. Due to the lack of a better explanation, however, I have to accept Avigad’s
suggestion.
Behind the falcon is a two-winged uraeus, with its wings stretched forward towards
the falcon. The uraeus is perched on top of a lotus flower.
Next to the sun is a neb symbol (also not mentioned by Avigad). Avigad (1968:49)
points out, quite correctly, that the combination of a winged uraeus perched on a lotus
flower is a unique symbol in Egyptian and Phoenician iconography. At the bottom of
the seal is winged solar disk, depicted horizontally.



134
Between the falcon and the winged solar disk is an inscription with six Phoenician
letters:
Figure 19 Phoenician inscription on seal
The inscription reads YḤZBʽL ‘May Baʽ al look (in favour of the child)’ (Avigad
1968:49).
b. Discussion
As discussed earlier (see p. 112 fn 39) Phoenician seals, during the late ninth and
eighth centuries which were inscribed with the owner’s name, for the most part,
probably belonged to royalty or officials.
The central and predominant symbol on this seal is the falcon. Horus, in the form of
the falcon, had throughout dynastic times in ancient Egypt been the one god
associated with kings (see p. 36 above and HORUS in ANNEXURE B) and
especially as the protector of kings. The double crown is a further indication of
royalty as is the cartouche in front of the falcon. The latter in ancient Egypt was worn
only by the Pharaohs, and represented the Pharaohs' insignia.
The winged sun disk (at the bottom of the seal) always represented the close
association between Horus, the Sun god Ra and the pharaoh and the protection of the
god. The winged sun disk is the ‘great protector’ and it is astonishing that it is
depicted at the bottom of the seal and not at the top.



135
The winged uraeus has been associated with various gods, but mostly with Ra and the
wings emphasised the celestial aspect. The winged uraeus was seen as a protective
power and with its wings stretched towards somebody or something it clearly directs
its protection towards the subject, in this instance the falcon. The fact that the uraeus
is perched on a lotus, may point to the sun child Harpocrates, but it any event, it is
clearly a symbol of resurrection.
The strange aspect of the symbolism on this seal is not only the uraeus perched on the
lotus flower, but also the flail on the back of the uraeus, a very unique symbol.
Although the flail can also be interpreted as a symbol of authority, in this instance, in
my opinion, the combination of the flail and the lotus flower extends the protective
powers to the owner’s fertility (Min with flail at back = fertility) and his prospects of
resurrection in the afterlife.
On this seal we thus find various royal symbols combined with religious symbols.
The probabilities are that the seal belonged to a member of the royalty. The seal is
bigger than a normal seal and according to Avigad (1968:49) the carving is of a high
standard. I suggest that the Horus-falcon, in this instance, is representative of Baal,
but more in particular the owner’s own association with Baal, as can be deducted
from his name. A further factor in this regard favouring the owner’s association with
the falcon is the fact that his name appears directly beneath the falcon and the
cartouche, without a separating field divider.



136
5.3.2.4 Seal belonging to Ḥeddai
Figure 20 Belonging to Ḥeddai
(Avigad & Sass 1997:274)
a. Description
This seal is currently in the Louvre Museum, Paris, but its origin is unknown.
It is a reddish brown and white agate scaraboid, unperforated with dimensions 24 x
18 x 10 mm.
It has a single-line border and two single-line field dividers, with three registers.
In the top register two men, identical like a mirror image, in a striding position,
confront each other. It is submitted that it is indeed intended that the man to the right
is a mirror image of the one on the left, the right hand raised in greeting and the left



137
holding a sceptre. If not so, the one on the right raises his left hand in greeting with
the sceptre in his right hand, which seems extremely improbable. The man is dressed
in an Egyptian kilt with an Egyptian style wig (Cf. Woodforde 1971:5-7). On top of
each sceptre are two feathers. Behind each man is an ankh. Above their heads is the
following inscription:
(Cf. Avigad & Sass 1997:274) ‘Belonging to Ḥeddai ’.
Avigad & Sass (1997:274-275) is of the opinion that although the name of the seal
owner is not a known Phoenician name, the Egyptianizing of the scene and the round
angled yod indicate Phoenician origin.
The middle register contains a couchant roaring lion with a triangle above him.
The bottom register is vestigial.
According to Avigad & Sass (1997:275) this seal dates to the late ninth-eighth
centuries. Avigad (1978:67) assigns this seal to the eighth century.
b. Discussion c.
The scene in the top register of this seal can hardly be described as a religious ritual
in itself except for the ankh and feathers which may be regarded as religious symbols.
It rather seems that the owner of the seal was an official and more in particular a
judge of some sort. The sceptre symbolises the authority and power of an official. The
feathers represent justice and order as symbols of Ma’at. Ma’at is normally portrayed
with three symbols (a) the well known feather on her head; (b) a sceptre in her one
hand and (c) an ankh in her other hand (Armour 2001:133). All three these symbols
are present in this scene. This personḤe(ddai) associates himself with the three



138
symbols of Ma’at. The staffs indicate the authority and power of officialdom. This
representation is further enhanced by the symbol of the lion in the middle register as
‘powerful’ (van der Horst 1987:33; Wilkinson 1841:169 and Spence 1990:291) and
as a guardian (Ruiz 2001:219). Furthermore, according to Bordreuil (1986:54), in
Egyptian symbolism a striding man with a sceptre in one hand and the other hand
raised with its palm forward signified a dignitary or official.
The final symbol to be considered is the triangle in the middle register. Various
explanations have been given by scholars for the symbolism of the triangle in
Egyptian mythology. The possibility of it just being a space filler was suggested
(Avigad 1978:67). It has also been explained as representing a holy trinity of gods
(for instance Osiris, Isis and Horus or Amun, Mut and Khonsu) (Doane 1882:35;
Massey 2008a:281). Another explanation is that it represents ‘God’, without reference
to any trinity (Zelinsky-Wibbelt 2003:225). Some scholars regard it as representative
of the benben stone and thus the pyramids, resembling the sun’s rays and therefore
the sun god Ra. According to these scholars it amounts to resurrection or rebirth as
represented by Ra. The triangle is therefore, according to them, a symbol for rebirth
(Cf. Alford 2004: 334-338 and the authorities quoted). I do not agree with this
interpretation and in this particular context I rather agree with the proposition that the
triangle in this depiction represents the hieroglyph for ‘good’ (Hawkins 2000:3).
In the final analysis we seem to have the seal of a Phoenician official, who
demonstrates his power and authority, but at the same time represents himself as a
just person and a good guardian. Here again we see concepts foreign to Phoenician
culture and religion, such as Ma’at, the triangle and the ankh.



139
5.3.2.5
Figure 21 The seal of Yašda
(Avigad 1978:67-69)
(See also Avigad 1997:276)
a. Description
It is a scaraboid of brown agate and is perforated. This seal is exceptionally large with
dimensions 32 x 24 x 12 mm. It has a single-line border and one double-line field
divider, dividing the seal into a large register on top and a small one below.
The origin of the seal is unknown and it is currently in the Louvre Museum in Paris.
The central theme in the top register is of a striding young boy, wearing the Egyptian
double crown, looking to the right and holding an ankh in his right hand and a



140
papyrus sceptre in his left. He is dressed in an Egyptian kilt with a long robe which
lightly covers his shoulders.
In front of the youth is a plain cartouche. Avigad (978:68) states that the cartouche is
surmounted by two ostrich feathers. I am not in total agreement with this conclusion,
although I am prepared to admit that ostrich feathers are involved.
To me it seems as if the atef-crown is involved, (if a bit stylized), thus
representing Osiris, the final judge.
Below the cartouche is a lotus flower.
Behind the youth is a baboon (Avigad describes it as a monkey, but I do not agree; a
monkey has a flat face and baboon a ‘dog’ face) standing on another lotus flower with
an object in his left hand. The object in the baboon’s hand is difficult to discern.
Avigad speculates that it may be some fruit, but it seems more like a papyrus scroll.



141
Above the baboon is a combination of a solar disk and a crescent moon. At the top of
the seal are two stars, the one on the left hand side is possibly an eight-pointed star
and the one on the right definitely one.
In the bottom register of the seal is an inscription which seems to be .
Avigad (1978:68) declares that the name Yašda is well attested to in Phoenician
inscriptions but the meaning is unknown. The arrangement of the iconography and
the inscription signify a Phoenician seal.
b. Discussion
The central figure in the seal is the youth who Avigad (1997:276) describes as a
youthful pharaoh. I cannot disagree with this view. The double crown and the
cartouche are indicators that this may indeed be a young pharaoh. A striding figure
with a crown was normally a depiction of a king. Young princes had their hair shaven
Figure 22 Young Egyptian prince with hair lock.
(Weekes 1999: front cover)
with only a lock of hair on the one side (as an imitation of the youthful god Horus)
(Wilkinson 1854:311-312). It seems therefore that it is not a young prince being



142
depicted, but probably a young pharaoh. The papyrus sceptre represents new life or
resurrection and the ankh eternal life. The two lotus flowers also represent new life.
As far as the baboon is concerned there are several possibilities. Thoth, the god of
wisdom, magic, healing and scribes, was sometimes depicted as a baboon (if not as an
ibis) (Nunn 2002:102). According to Wallis Budge (1972b:290) the baboon is the
assistant of Thoth. Thoth as a moon good is seen in his form as a baboon with a
moon-disk on his head (Curl 2005:220:423). Baboons make a lot of noise at dawn
and were therefore regarded as moon gods paying homage to Ra, the rising sun (Hart
2002:157). The moon god Khonsu was also depicted in the form of a baboon (Pinch
2004:113; Dunand, Zivie-Coche & Lorton 2005:15).
Figure 23: Thoth as a baboon with a scribe sitting in front of him
(Peck 1978: Plate XIII)
The varying actions of baboons during the different phases of the moon convinced the
ancient Egyptian that there was a relationship with Thoth, the traditional moon god
(Bleeker 1973:111). On this seal the moon disk and the crescent moon clearly



143
indicate that the baboon is Thoth as the moon god. A further indicator is the object in
the baboon’s hand, which seems to be a scroll, thus indicating a scribe and wisdom.
In the language of the ancient Egyptians the word seba (to teach) was written with a
star. It means that the teacher opens the mind of the pupil to let in the light (star)
(Wiredu 2004:34). The star also played a role regarding the ka or soul. Stars were
particularly associated with Isis and the pharaoh was known as ‘the morning star’
(Curl 2005:464-465).
‘“The Bright Morning Star”, the star with eight rays also represents Horus...It
originally represented “Orion,” the eightfold one―the highest’ (Churchward
1913:206). The Egyptian pharaohs, after death were identified with the Pole star
(Keister 2004:125).
The size of the seal and the quality of the iconography would suggest that the owner
was a person of high standing, but the rough workmanship of the inscription points in
another direction. One gets the impression that two different carvers were at work. It
seems as if the iconography was prepared by one carver and that the bottom register
was left unfinished for the owner to have his name carved at a later stage and that it
was not custom-made from the start. A comparison can be made with a modern
readymade piece of jewellery on which the purchaser has a name inscribed at a later
stage. On the other hand, it does not necessarily follow that it was not made for a
royal person or an official, only that the carver of the inscription could have been less
experienced than the original carver. As I have already indicated, the tendency was
that only royalty and officials had their names inscribed on seals.



144
Overall it seems that it was the seal of either a royal person or an official. The
depiction of the young pharaoh was probably intended to represent his own king. The
symbolism could read as follows: ‘May Horus guard our king and Thoth teach him
wisdom and may he be well judged by Osiris to be reborn into eternal life.’
5.3.3 Phoenician anepigraphic seals
In this section I want to discuss a few anepigraphic Phoenician seals dating to Iron
IIB and C. Egyptian symbolism on Phoenician seals was not confined to royalty and
government officials but appears also on the seals of ordinary citizens. Hundreds, if
not thousands, of these seals have been found at sites of traditional Phoenician
settlements, especially as grave goods that were buried with the deceased (in the
majority of cases his cremated remains). During Iron IIB and C it appears that there
was a tendency amongst the Phoenicians that only royalty and government officials
had their names inscribed on their personal seals. Ordinary citizens confined
themselves to anepigraphic seals.
The reason for this tendency is not clear, but I venture the following solution. Royalty
and officials were required to seal documents and to use it for other official purposes;
their seals had an official role to play and were in the public domain. It was important
that the identity of the person who sealed a document be known.
For ordinary citizens the importance of the seal was vested in the magic potency of
the symbols. It was used as a personal amulet (lucky charm?) and for his/her own
private well being. Personal names were therefore not required for identification
purposes. It should also be remembered that the superstition about the unnecessary



145
publication of personal names and the magic involved in that regard, prevailed and
was still a strong factor. In my opinion it is a misconception that this tendency by
ordinary citizens towards anepigraphic seals was a new one that suddenly arose
during Iron IIB. Perusing Keel (1997) one finds that the vast majority of Phoenician
seals from that period, contained in that corpus, came from cemeteries and this
tendency is therefore more obvious during this period.
5.3.3.1 Phoenician anepigraphic seal (1)
Figure 24: Phoenician anepigraphic seal (1)
(Keel 1997:21)
a. Description
This seal was discovered in the southern cemetery at Minet ez-zib (Achziv) in tomb Z
24 and is currently in Jerusalem (IAA). It is a scaraboid, made of steatite. It is white
with yellow glazing; it has a single-line border. Its dimensions are 16 x 10,6 x 7,7



146
mm. It has only one register which contains the Egyptian hieroglyphic inscription.
‘Khonsu is my protection’. It is dated to Iron IIC (ca 700-539 B.C.E.).
b. Discussion
Achziv is situated about 15 kilometres north of Akko on the eastern Mediterranean
coast. This region was inhabited by the Phoenicians during Iron IIB and C and one
can assume with certainty that it belonged to a Phoenician. It is not possible to
establish the gender of the owner, but the lack of a personal name indicates an
ordinary citizen and not an official or a royal person. Another indication to an
ordinary citizen is the fact that the grave was in the southern cemetery. The elite of
the town was buried in the eastern cemetery (Markoe 2000:194).
The hieroglyphic inscription inevitably leads to the conclusion that they were not
used purely for decorative purposes. It has a religious message signifying the owner’s
faith in his/her guardian god. The god in this instance is the Egyptian moon god
Khonsu. Khonsu was one of the Theban triad, being the son of Amun and Mut. It can
therefore not be said that we are dealing with a Phoenician god dressed up as an
Egyptian god. According to Giveon (1988:24) there are a lot of parallels of this seal
in collections.
Khonsu’s main role was associated with the moon. His name means ‘runner’, who
soars the sky (Wallis Budge 1972a:172) and this may relate to the nightly travel of
the moon across the sky. Along with Thoth he marked the passage of time. Khonsu
was instrumental in the creation of new life in all living creatures, but he was also a



147
war god. It is not possible to ascertain on which characteristic of Khonsu the owner
relied for his protection, but probably his power to create new life.
5.3.3.2 Phoenician anepigraphic seal (2).
Figure 25: Phoenician anepigraphic seal (2).
(Keel 1997: 43)
a. Description
This seal is a scaraboid made of steatite or a very hard composite material and a blue
glazing. The engraving is shallow with hatching. The dimensions are 13,6 x 9,8 x 5,5
mm. It was found in the Gešer ʼaḵzīv or eastern cemetery at A ch ziv in tomb Z R 36,
no 144 and is currently held in Jerusalem (IAA).
It has a single-line border and no field divider. In the centre, in a kneeling position, is
Isis with cow (Hathor) horns on her head. The Horus-child is standing on her thighs



148
and with her right arm she is breastfeeding him, while she is holding him tight with
her left arm. Keel (1997:43) describes that the latter arm is depicting a protective
bow over the child.
Behind her back is an ankh and a t-hieroglyph (bread). In front of her and above the
head of the child is a st (throne) and behind the child is an obelisk. At the bottom of
the seal is a neb sign.
a. Discussion
The central theme of this seal is Isis breastfeeding Horus. This depiction may have
various interpretations. In the development of the history of ancient Egypt, the image
of Isis grew to such an extent that she finally usurped the powerful position of Hathor
as mother of the gods. Her magical powers and ability to go to the netherworld and
resurrect Osiris in order to conceive Horus and later the act of saving the life of
Horus, carved a special niche for her in the Egyptian mind. She became the prime
example of the devoted wife and mother with the power over life and death (Clarysse,
Schoors & Willems 1998:542-545). In many of the tombs or funerary temples of
deceased pharaohs this symbol represents the pharaoh as the infant Horus being
breastfed by Isis in order to resurrect him into a new life. She was also the protector
of children especially against disease. The st emphasises the presence of Isis (see
discussion on pp 79-80 above).
The ankh not only represents the union between Osiris and Isis but also eternal life.
The obelisk represented the sun’s power and thus also the power of the ruler who
erected it (Roullet 1972:43).



149
‘According to Francois Daumas, the erection of an obelisk was a mighty gesture
reproducing the symbolism of the Djed pillar, the familiar Osirian symbol standing
for the backbone (i.e. support) of the physical world and the channel through which
the divine spirit might rise through matter to rejoin its source’ (West 1995:251). The
normal symbolism is, however, concerned with the sun, the top representing the
benben stone, spraying the sun’s rays ‘thus appearing weightless carried aloft over the
world’ (Curl 2005:138). The sun is of course the prime symbol of resurrection, thus
new life. The t-hieroglyph represents bread or food.
The neb appears at the bottom of the seal. The neb-hieroglyph was mostly used to
indicate ‘lord’ or ‘master of the house’ (Bunsen 1846:167).
In my opinion the symbolism reads: ‘The lord Horus, giver of food and new as well
as eternal life’.
5.3.3.3 Phoenician anepigraphic seal (3)
Figure 26: Phoenician anepigraphic seal (3).
(Keel 1997:43)



150
a. Description
This is a scaraboid with the left side, in the length, broken away. It is made of white
steatite with dimensions 15,7 x 12? x 8,1 mm.
It was found in the Gešerʼaḵzīv or eastern cemetery at A chziv in tomb Z R 36, no
145 and is currently held in Jerusalem (IAA).
It has a single-line border and two field dividers, dividing the seal into three registers.
In the centre of the top register is an ankh sign flanked by two falcons with their
wings outstretched towards the inside in the direction of the ankh.
In the centre of the middle register is a djed-pillar flanked by two squatting male
figures with beards, looking to the right, with maat-feathers on their knees.
In the bottom register there are an ankh and a falcon with a flail. Flanking these two
symbols are two outward looking uraei; their tails are linked in the middle as if it is a
unit and form a semi-circle above the ankh and the falcon. Keel (1997:43) calls this
semi-circle an ‘arch’.
Keel (1997:43) dates this seal to the 22nd Dynasty (945-713 B.C.E.).
b. Discussion
The symbolism on this seal is rather straightforward. In the top register the ankh,
representing eternal life, is protected by the wings of the falcons, thus by Horus.
In the middle register is the djed-pillar. This symbol became an important symbol of
stability symbolizing the backbone and body of Osiris (Pinch 2002:127). The Djed
amulet was used to cure and protect the wearer against injury of the spine. The Djed
funerary amulet was laid upon the neck of the deceased, to whom it gave the power to



151
reconstitute the body and to become a perfect Ka and reborn with a strong spine in the
underworld.
Armour (2001:30) describes it as ‘a phallic symbol of the rejuvenation and strength of
Osiris ― as a sign that he has been born again and that the land would be fertile for
yet another year’. Brown (1998:65) regards it as ‘a symbol of strength’.
The two male figures flanking the Djed-pillar can, as a result of the beards, be either
kings or gods. I opt for gods because one of the hieroglyphic symbols for a god is
seated male figure with a beard:
Figure 27: God with beard
(McDermott 2002:68)
On the knees of the gods are ma’at feathers which represent order, stability and
justice.
In the bottom register we again have the ankh representing eternal life, but it is
combined with a falcon (Horus) with a flail. In this instance it cannot be said that the
flail is representing Min, but rather that it is a symbol of authority, a reminder that the
gods may punish a person for wrongdoing (Perl & Weihs 1990:20). Here again we
have the protection of the gods symbolised by the arch of the uraei.
I see the sum total of the symbols on this seal as follows. The owner relies on the
gods for protection of stability, order, authority and eternal life.

On the left side of the seal is Sakhmet in human form with a lion head with a uraeus
on her head and a solar disk above her. In her left hand she holds a papyrus sceptre.
At the bottom of the seal is a neb.
a. Discussion.
The interesting aspect about this seal is the names of the two Egyptian pharaohs that
appear on this seal. At the top in the cartouche appears the name of Menkaure (ca.
2575-2500 B.C.E. a pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty and the builder of the third and
smallest of the pyramids on the Giza plateau (he lived nearly 2000 years before the
owner of the seal). The other pharaoh, represented by his Horus-name (the
hieroglyphics ccand jb) was Wahibre Psammetichus I (Keel 1997:38; James 1983:
265). The latter Pharaoh ruled in Egypt from 664 to 610 B.C.E., during the 26th
Menkaure was regarded as a sort of folk hero in ancient Egypt. He succeeded in
relieving a great deal of the suffering of the Egyptian people, incurred by his father
Khufu when he built the Great Pyramid at Giza. His own pyramid is much smaller
than those of his father and his uncle Khafre. ‘... Menkaure was a good king. The
Egyptians loved him because he prayed to the gods and he looked after the temples’
(Filer 2006:28). Except for the fact that he was a good king, there seems to be no
reason whatsoever that his name should appear on the seal of an ordinary Phoenician
citizen two thousand years later, unless it was purely for decorative purposes. The
reason why the Horus-name of Wahibre Psammetichus I appears on the seal gives us
Dynasty (Iron IIC in Palestine).



154
an approximate date for the seal for it was apparently carved during the reign of that
king, although Keel (1997:38) suggests it is on the seal purely as decoration.
Here again we have the interesting phenomenon of the Horus-falcon with a flail at its
back (see the seal of Jezebel on p. 32 above). The flail in itself was a symbol of royal
authority. With Min holding it behind his back it represents fertility. I submit that the
flail should be seen in conjunction with the papyrus sceptre, which symbolised new
life and resurrection (Andrews 1994:82-83). Sakhmet symbolises strength, for it was
essential to wear amulets in the image of powerful gods for protection. The ḥz-vase,
in this instance, is placed in front of the Horus-falcon and seems to mean ‘to praise’
(Keel 1995:171). The nbw-sign represents gold which was regarded by the Egyptians
to be a godly metal. It was a symbol of brilliance, light and purity (McClintock &
Strong 1881:139). It indicates to shine or be resplendent (Portal 1904:66). Its shiny
surface was related to the brilliance of the sun. Gold was important to the afterlife as
it represents aspects of immortality.
In combination I suggest that the symbols would read something like this: ‘Praise (the
ḥz-vase) the lord (neb) Horus (falcon) who is strong (Sekhmet) and brings fertility
(flail), new life (papyrus sceptre) and immortality (nbw-sign)’.

Description
It is a scaraboid made of white steatite and dimensions 14,3 x 10 x 6,8 mm. It has a
single-line border and no field divider. It was found in the Gešerʼaḵzīv or eastern
cemetery at Achziv in tomb Z R 9, no 124 and is currently held in Jerusalem (IAA).

At the top of the seal is a solar disk flanked by two uraei. On the left hand side is the

Facing Ptah is the goddess Ma’at. At the bottom of the seal is a neb.
Dynasty (728-525 B.C.E.), but according to
my own dates it should be 745-525 B.C.E. (see ANNEXURE A).
a. Discussion
The solar disk with the flanking uraei at the top of the seal represents Ra as the
supreme god. The central theme of this depiction consists of Ptah, Ma’at and the big
neb at the bottom (which serves as a basis for the enthroned Ptah). It signifies ‘Ptah,



156
lord of.’ The fact that he is facing the goddess Ma’at leads to the interpretation ‘Ptah,
lord of Ma’at’ (Keel 1997:28). It does not mean that he is the lord and master of the
goddess Ma’at, but rather that he is the lord of the concept ma’at, thus ‘order’. In
terms of the Memphite creation myth he was after all regarded as the supreme creator
of the universe who had brought everything into existence through his thoughts
(expressed by the heart) and his will (expressed by his tongue). He created the world,
the other gods, their centers, shrines and images as well as the cities, food, drink and
all the requirements for life. He also established abstract concepts and principles such
as divine utterance and ethics, thus including the concept of ma’at.
Ptah was the ‘patron god of all artisans and workers in stone and metal, and even
wielders of the artist’s brush and crayon’ (Wallis Budge 1972b:158). The owner of
this seal was probably an artisan who depended on the patronage of Ptah to ensure
order, justice and stability.
The bent lotus flower poses a bit of a mystery. Keel (1997:28), with reference to other
scholars, poses various possible solutions. It could be a stylized flail or signifying a
deceased person, the lotus being a symbol for the dead during Canaanite times and
also a death symbol in the Neo-Assyrian iconography. I suggest that one should rather
see the lotus flower in this instance in its traditional concept as a symbol of
resurrection.
To the owner of this seal the Memphite god Ptah was apparently still a god of
greatness, despite the decline in his position amongst the Egyptian gods during the
relevant period. The owner relies on his powers as the god of creation and thus his
powers over life and death and to resurrect the dead.

In the upper section of the lower register is a kc with a white crown in the middle
and flanked by two Wḏct-eyes. Just below this is a scarab beetle (ḫpr) flanked by
two red crowns. At the bottom of the seal is a neb.



158
b. Discussion
Here we have the protective powers in the top register guarding the totality of the
scene in the bottom register where the determinative factor seems to be the neb which
signifies lord or master.
Central to the theme is the scarab representing renewal and regeneration. The two
Wḏ3t-eyes protect against evil and also assist recovery from illness. The kcor ka is
the soul. The white and red crowns represent Upper and Lower Egypt respectively.
The crowns pose a bit of a problem. If the owner was an Egyptian his association
with the crowns would be clear. The fact that the owner was cremated indicates a
Phoenician. I can only surmise that the owner (or the person who wanted the amulet
made) wanted to involve the gods of Egypt.
It is a fitting amulet to place with a deceased person and the theme has the appearance
that it was specially made to accompany the deceased to the ‘grave’. Amulets were,
after all, essential adornments for both the living and the dead (Andrews 1994:6).
This appears to be a funerary amulet placed by the relatives of the deceased with his
cremated remains. In that event the theme could be interpreted to read: ‘May the gods
of Egypt protect the soul of our lord against evil and give him new life’.

Dynasty (664-525 B.C.E.).



160
In the lower section of the seal is the sun child in his squatting position on a lotus
flower. The sun child is flanked by two outward looking squatting figures. Each one
has three lotus flowers on his head. Each one has a ḥz-vase in the right hand (the top
part of the ḥz-vase on the right is lost as a result of the seal damage).
b. Discussion
The two squatting figures in the top section of the seal appear to be kings, as
indicated by the uraei on their foreheads. They submit in adoration to Sakhmet who
they acknowledge to be their king (queen?). The name ‘Sakhmet’ means ‘the mighty
one’ and is derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphs ‘to be strong’ (Wallis Budge
1972b:160). She was the daughter of Ra and also represents the manifestation of the
eye of Ra (Zaki & Atiya 2008:68). She was the instrument of divine retribution
(Pinch 2004:187). She was also the goddess of war and accompanied the king into
battle. Her power was so great that she was said to even dominate Osiris on
occasions. She was also a fiercely protective mother (Armour 2001:103-104).
We have encountered the sun child several times and he represents new life, the hot
sun after the winter, thus resurrection. The two squatting figures flanking the sun
child seem to be representations of the Nile-god Haapi. ‘He is represented in the form
of a man with a woman’s breast (sic), and wearing a cluster of water plants on his
head. The plant worn by the Nile-god of the North was the lotus and by the Nile-god
of the South the papyrus’ (Wallis Budge 1925:8). I suggest that Wallis Budge has it
wrong and that it should be the other way round. The lotus flower has always been
associated with Upper Egypt, thus the south and the papyrus with Lower Egypt, the
north (Portal 1904:42). Scott Littleton (2005:609) describes it as ‘a crown of aquatic



161
flowers’. The fact that he was represented with a woman’s breasts was to signify
fertility (Wiedemann 2001:145). The Nile (Haapi) which brought fresh fertile soil to
the Egyptians every year during the inundation was a main symbol of fertility. He has
also been described as a hermaphrodite ‘the fertilizer male and the nourisher female’
(Bromley 1988:537).
Overall one gets the impression that this seal belonged to a woman. The emphasis on
fertility and new life and the powerful goddess Sekhmet, not only a goddess of war
but also a protective mother lead to this conclusion. The seal emphasises that even
kings gave homage to her. The theme seems to read: ‘Praise the powerful Sekhmet,
who gives fertility and the ability to bear new life.’
5.4 CONCLUSION
In this Chapter the role of the Phoenicians in the Mediterranean during Iron IIB and C
and their main gods were briefly investigated and some Phoenician seals with
Egyptian symbols were analysed. The purpose was threefold::
a) To demonstrate the preference of the Phoenicians for Egyptian symbols in their
seal iconography during Iron IIB and C; thus showing
b) Egyptian cultural and religious influences in the Levant, with Phoenicia as a
starting point during Iron IIB and C; and
c) To establish a basis for arguing that Egypt, not only directly from the south,
but also indirectly via Phoenicia, had an impact on the religion of the Israelites during
Iron IIB and C.



162
According to the Bible there appeared to have been close relations with Phoenicia,
especially Tyre during the time of the United Kingdom. Again it would be unscientific to
rely solely on the Bible in this regard. In the next chapter I will therefore, inter alia, have
a look at archaeological finds, such as the Samaria ivories, to substantiate the biblical
allegations.
I emphasised that one should not regard Phoenicia as a political entity but as different
city states, each with its own pantheon. After the division of the Israelite kingdoms, this
relationship with Phoenicia was apparently continued, in particular by the Northern
Kingdom. Some scholars (inter alia Keel, Uehlinger and Cornelius) are of the opinion
that as a result of the geography of the area, there were Phoenician influences on the
Northern Kingdom of Israel while the Southern Kingdom of Judah was to a large extent
influenced by Egypt. I made the point that Phoenicia itself had been influenced by Egypt
and that these Egyptian influences were indirectly conveyed to the Northern Kingdom via
Phoenicia.
Since the earliest time contact occurred between Egypt and the mainland region
occupied by the Canaanites and their descendants the Phoenicians. Cultural exchanges
between the peoples of the regions would have been unavoidable, including Egyptian
influences on Phoenician culture. In order to prove the Egyptian influences on Phoenicia,
I analysed epigraphic and anepigraphic Phoenician seals. The result of this analysis was
that the Phoenicians during Iron IIB and C, to a large extent, made use of Egyptian
religious symbolism in their seal iconography. This tendency pertained to royalty,
government officials and ordinary citizens. It also seems that epigraphic seals were
confined to royalty, government officials and merchantmen, while ordinary citizens used



163
anepigraphic seals. It seems that the Phoenicians substituted depictions of Egyptian gods
for their own gods, but they apparently also imported Egyptian gods to form part of their
pantheons. They also made use of various other Egyptian religious symbols to emphasise
aspects of their own religion.



164
CHAPTER 6 AN ANALYSIS OF SEALS FROM ISRAEL AND JUDAH DATING TO IRON IIB AND C
6.1. INTRODUCTION
During the eighth century B.C.E. there was a clear tendency amongst Phoenician and
Israelite royalty to use Egyptian symbols in specialty craft (Keel & Uehlinger
1998:262). The Samaria ivories discovered are a prime example, displaying mostly
Egyptian motifs. An analysis of the seals in the corpi of scholars such as Keel (1997)
and Avigad & Sass (1997) shows the same tendency amongst Phoenician royalty as
well as ordinary citizens.
In the previous chapter some Phoenician seals with Egyptian symbols were analysed.
The purpose was threefold:
d) To demonstrate the preference of the Phoenicians for Egyptian symbols in their
seal iconography during Iron IIB and C; thus showing
e) Egyptian cultural and religious influences in the Levant, with Phoenicia as a
starting point during Iron IIB and C; and
f) To establish a basis for arguing that Egypt, not only directly from the south,
but also indirectly via Phoenicia, had an impact on the religion of the Israelites during
Iron IIB and C.
From the latter part of Iron IIB onwards, it seemed that epigraphic seals were mostly
confined to royalty and officialdom in Phoenicia. The seals of the ordinary citizens,
recovered from Phoenician sites, especially the cemeteries and thus easily identified
as such, appear, without exception, to be anepigraphic. In this chapter one avenue of



165
investigation will be to investigate if the same tendency was prevalent amongst the
Israelites in both kingdoms.
A further aspect that requires closer inspection is whether the preferred Egyptian
symbols in Phoenicia correspond with those prevalent in Israel and/or Judah.
An important factor to keep in mind is that officially the Phoenicians had a
polytheistic religion. They could, therefore, more readily associate some of their gods
with those of Egypt. A further aspect, as has been indicated in the previous chapter, is
that it seems that, despite the continuation from their Canaanite origins and heritage,
the Phoenician pantheon, compared to the pantheon of the Canaanites during the Late
Bonze Age, had severely dwindled in numbers. Being a polytheistic society, it would
be acceptable for them to supplement their stock of gods from the Egyptian pantheon
whenever a need or situation required the attention of a specific god not provided for
in their own pantheon.
In Israel and Judah, with their official monotheistic religion, the situation was much
more complicated. They were not only restricted to one God, but by the time of Isaiah
of Jerusalem this God had become the only supreme deity of the universe, ‘the other
gods are lifeless statues with no power to affect human destiny’ (Mills 1998:60).
A further problem for the Israelites was their God’s prohibition of graven images:
‘You shall not make for yourself an idol in the form of anything in heaven above or
on the earth below or in the waters below’ (Ex 20:4). This placed severe restrictions
on the Israelites; they had to worship an invisible God, one whom they were not even
allowed to refer to or address by his real name. This, however, did not deter them



166
from taking names which indicated their alliance with him, a sort of contradictio in
terminis.
Despite the ‘official religion’ the Bible abounds with transgressions of the
monotheistic doctrine. Not only were the common people involved in idol worship,
but, according to the Bible, most of the kings of Judah and Israel as well. The
abundance of figurines, altars, private shrines and other ritual objects discovered in
Palestine, confirms those assertions.
Earlier in this study, it has been argued that the imaging on seals, especially those
worn as amulets, falls in the same category as figurines and other idols. To dismiss
them as mere adornment is a grave miscalculation of the true situation. By analysing
Phoenician seals (as well as the seals of Jezebel and Hezekiah) it was endeavoured to
show that a message was conveyed which for the most part was of a religious nature.
During Iron IIB and C, due mostly to Phoenician influences on the Northern
Kingdom of Israel and more direct Egyptian influences on the Southern Kingdom of
Judah, a situation developed where the iconographic symbol systems of the two
kingdoms did not coincide exactly. In the Northern Kingdom with their continuous
contact with inter alia Phoenicia, new ideas seemed to have developed faster and
became more quickly established than in their more isolated and more conservative
southern neighbour, for instance the winged uraeus made its appearance much later in
the iconography of the Southern Kingdom of Judah than in the Northern Kingdom of
Israel (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:272).
During the late ninth and the eighth centuries B.C.E., as evidenced inter alia by some
of the motifs on the Samaria ivories, Phoenician/Egyptian religious symbolism made



167
its appearance in the iconography of the Northern Kingdom. More than 500 ivory
fragments dating to eighth century B.C.E. were found at Samaria. These ivories have
Egyptian motifs, although the style seems to have been inspired from Phoenicia and
were most probably carved in one of the Phoenician cities.42
The most frequent depiction is the Horus child on a lotus flower, a symbol also
popular in Phoenicia, as already discussed in the previous chapter (see the discussion
of the seal belonging to Ger ̔Eshmun on pp. 127-132 above).
Egyptian symbolism on
these ivories includes various deities, such as Horus, Ra, Heh, Isis, Nephthys and
Osiris.
Figure 32: Harpocrates seated on a lotus. Ivory from Samaria
(Pienaar 2008:51)
42 I only touch on the Samaria ivories to illustrate the extent of Egyptian influences in the Northern Kingdom during the ninth and eighth centuries B.C.E. It is not practical to analyse them in detail within the scope of this study.



168
A recurring symbol is the Djed pillar, symbolising Osiris, guarded on both sides by
Isis and Nephthys, the sister of Isis who helped her resurrect Osiris after his murder
and dismemberment by Seth. Above them and the Djed pillar are solar disks,
personifying perhaps a union between the sun god Ra and Osiris (Figure 36).
.
Figure 33: Isis and Nepthys guarding the Djed pillar. Ivory plaque from Samaria
(Pienaar 2008:53)
Other Egyptian religious symbols prevailing at this time in the Northern Kingdom
are, amongst others, protective wings, winged uraei, falcons and hybrid winged
creatures such as cherubs and winged falcon headed sphinxes, winged solar disks
(also popular in Phoenicia), Bes, the eye of Horus, Ma’at and the Ankh. Egyptian
symbolism, in addition to portraying religious concepts also dominate royal and
courtly rule in Phoenicia and the Northern Kingdom during this period: the double
crown of Egypt; kings smiting their enemies with clubs and kings in the form of
sphinxes trampling their enemies (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:248-265). These symbols



169
and others together with their significance as religious symbols are discussed in this
study where they appear on seals which are analyzed.
Similarly designed Hebrew bone seals have been found from the northern parts of the
Northern Kingdom all over Palestine to the southern parts of Judah, for instance at
Tell el- Oreme, Acre and Megiddo in the north to Shechem, Gezer, Tell en-Nashbeh,
Lachish in the central hill country and Jerusalem and as far south as Tell Beit Mirsim,
Arad and Tell el-Farʽah. These seals apparently originated in southern Palestine and
there is a possibility that these seals were produced in Judah. It also seems that these
seals originated during the ninth century B.C.E. and were used into the eighth century
B.C.E. ‘The iconography on these bone seals gives evidence of an intense fascination
with Egyptian power symbols’ (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:265-266).
These seals portray Egyptian royal symbols such as cartouches, falcons, lions and
caprids which may be the result of the close proximity of Egypt to Judah and the lack
in Israelite society of a tradition of such symbols. An emerging desire to symbolise
royal power may have led to the borrowing of symbols, traditionally representing
power, from their southern neighbours.
Towards the end of the eighth century B.C.E. there came a change in the Judahite seal
iconography, a movement away from Egyptian royal symbols towards Egyptian
religious symbolism. This tendency is detectable during the reign of King Ahaz (742
726 B.C.E.), continued throughout the reign of his son, the reformist King Hezekiah
and was still alive and well into the 7P
th
P century B.C.E. during the time of the other
great reformist, Judahite King Josiah (640-609 B.C.E.) (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:272
274). This trend seemed to have continued until the exile to Babylon in 587 B.C.E. I



170
submit that this was the result of Judah’s forced isolation from the north due to the
Assyrian occupation of the erstwhile Northern Kingdom, as well as a continuous
Assyrian threat at Judah’s borders which necessitated a closer relationship with Egypt
to the south (see also the discussion of the seal of Hezekiah above on pp. 38-42 and
hereinafter on pp. 183-184).
The contemporary Biblical prophets seemed to be fully aware of these Egyptianizing
tendencies of the Judahites:
‘Woe to the obstinate children, declares the Lord, “to those who carry out plans that
are not mine, forming an alliance, but not by my Spirit, heaping sin upon sin; who go
down to Egypt without consulting me; who look for help to Pharaoh’s protection, to
Egypt’s shade for refuge”’ (Is 30:1-2).
‘I will punish those who dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem,
with the sword, with famine, and with pestilence, so that none of the remnant of
Judah who have come to live in the land of Egypt shall escape or survive or return to
the land of Judah, to which they desire to return to dwell there; for they shall not
return, except some fugitives’ (Jr 44:13–14).
The Egyptian religious symbols that most commonly appear, first in the Northern
Kingdom and later in Judah are the winged uraeus (two-winged and four-winged),
the winged solar disk and two- and four-winged scarabs pushing the solar disk. The
winged uraeus was a clearly Egyptian protective symbol and in Judah it seemed to
have represented the protective power of Yahweh ‘enthroned on Mount Zion’ (sic)
(Keel & Uehlinger 1998:274).



171
The winged suns and the winged scarabs pushing the solar disk are clearly
representing the sun god. As emphatically stated by Keel & Uehlinger (1998:276)
‘The close contacts that existed with neighboring Egypt, particularly at the end of the
eighth century, make it quite improbable that the people of Judah, just like the people
of Israel..., would not have known what the winged solar disk, a scarab or a uraei
(sic) meant...people in Judah and Israel had some very definite notions about what
was at the root of the use of winged uraei as guarding powers and of the scarab as a
mysterious embodiment of or metaphor for the sun that rose victoriously anew each
day.’
The fact that Yahweh seemed to have remained the sovereign God in both Israel and
Judah leads to the conclusion that the Israelites during this period, did not necessarily
accept an Egyptian Ra (Amun-Ra) or a Phoenician Baal as a sun god replacing
Yahweh. Those, devout to Yahweh, rather associated Yahweh symbolically with the
most prominent celestial body and used Egyptian religious solar symbols to convey
his status (position) or supremacy as the highest god. Even those devout to Yahweh
accepted, however, that there were other gods. Yahweh was the god of the Israelites
and he was superior to all other gods. The concept of only one God in the universe
did not at that time exist amongst the Israelites. Isaiah, during the late eighth century
B.C.E., may have started preaching this new concept, but it is highly unlikely that the
ordinary Israelite/Judahite would have been converted to it. This belief in more than
one god most probably existed up to the highest levels (including royalty) of their
society. Furthermore, one should always keep in mind that the Israelites themselves
had no tradition of symbolising gods and their powers. By using these Egyptian



172
symbols, those devout to Yahweh had no intention (the graven image prohibition) to
portray Yahweh himself, but rather some aspect of him, such as his supremacy or his
protective and other powers.
It does not follow that there were not factions amongst the Israelites who worshipped
other gods. The contrary seems to be true and the Bible is very clear in this respect in
that kings, devout to Yahweh, like Hezekiah and Josiah, seem to be the exceptions
rather than the rule. In analysing and interpreting the iconography on seals, one has to
examine the symbols in the context of the times during which the seals were
produced. A sun disk during the time of King Hezekiah may represent the supremacy
of Yahweh, but during the reign of his father, King Ahaz or his son Manasseh, it
could have represented Baal or even Amun-Ra. The significant factor is that during
Iron IIB and C the Israelites used Egyptian religious symbols in demonstrating their
own religion, whether such religion was Yahwistic, Phoenician, Egyptian or a
polytheistic combination. One should be very careful in reaching final conclusions
regarding the religious meaning and implications of such symbolism and I will
endeavour to motivate my submissions as far as possible in the light of available
evidence and authority.
43
The ultimate purpose of this study being to indicate the acceptance of Egyptian
symbolism in the religion of Israel and Judah, I am now going to proceed with the
analysis of seals to illustrate my hypothesis. I want to emphasise that this study is not
intended to be a catalogue of Hebrew seals, whether published or unpublished, but the
43 See also the arguments of Keel and Uehlinger (1998:272-281) and Ornan (2005:231-235) in this regard.



173
seals being analysed are selected to be representative of various Egyptian gods and
religious rituals and principles. It should also be noted that most of the relevant seals
‘which appear with great frequency during Iron age IIB ... are ... as yet unpublished’
(Keel & Uehlinger 1998:280). It is therefore impossible to discuss all the seals
pertaining to the periods under discussion. For the same reason it is impossible to
make a complete list of archaeological sites where seals dating to the relevant period
have been found. Such seals have been at sites all over the erstwhile Israel and Judah.
A perusal of Avigad & Sass (1997) and Keel (1997) reveals inter alia the following
sites: Akko, Acre, Arad, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Bethlehem, Beth Shean, Beth Shemesh,
En Gedi, Gezer, Hebron, Jerusalem, Megiddo, Samaria, Tel Dan, Tel Dor, Tell en
Nashbeh, Tell es-Safi etcetera.
For easier identification, I am mostly going to concentrate on inscribed seals. The
name of the owner may be of assistance in establishing his religious orientation.
Similarly the name of the king, of whom he was a servant, may serve as an indicator
of the period during which he lived. The name of the king may also bear witness of
the prevailing state religion in the particular kingdom.
The following criteria were used in selecting the seals for analysis and discussion:
a) To be representative of the wide distribution of Egyptian religious symbols
portrayed on Hebrew seals during the period;
b) To illustrate the involvement of royalty and officialdom and
c) To avoid as far as possible repetitive themes, such as winged solar disks and
winged uraei which constitute the majority of the themes on the published
seals.



174
The first four epigraphic seals were chosen because they apparently represented
royalty, including a queen, a king and two princes. The rest of the epigraphic seals
were chosen because they represented high officials such as ministers, priests and
military officers. They were not included with a particular sequence in mind. They all
date from the same period but it is impossible to date them precisely, so a
chronological sequence is not possible.
6.2 SEALS WITH HEBREW INSCRIPTIONS AND EGYPTIANISED
ICONOGRAPHY
During the early eighth century B.C.E. there was a clear tendency amongst
Phoenician and Israelite royalty (with Judahite royalty to follow suit later in that
century) to use Egyptian symbolism.
At this stage, by means of introduction to the analysis of the Hebrew seals, it seems
appropriate to again look at the seals of Jezebel and Hezekiah, especially in view of
the discussions of Egyptian symbolism and Phoenician seals, in an endeavour to
understand the meaning of the symbolism portrayed on those two seals.



175
6.2.1 The seal of Jezebel revisited
.
Figure 34: Seal of Jezebel (2)
a. Discussion
For various reasons I work on the premises that this seal most probably belonged to
Queen Jezebel, wife of King Ahab of Israel.44 There are several significant pointers in
44 This is also the conclusion of Professor M Korpel (2008a:32-37, 80). According to BAR (28 [2]:3839, 80), this conclusion is contested by other scholars, (for instance A Mazar [2008]). Rollston (2008a)
contends that the writing on the seal dates to a period later than the 9th Century B.C.E., during which period Queen Jezebel lived, according to the Bible. The editor of BAR contacted several other renowned palaeographers and not one of them was prepared to state that the writing did not date to the
9th Century. Rollston (2008b) responded. Byrne (2008) basically agrees with Rollston. Korpel (2008b) defended her position. The main argument against the seal belonging to Queen Jezebel is that all other
seals dating to the 9th century that have been discovered in Palestine are anepigraphic. Avigad & Sass
dates it to the late 9th-8th century, ‘based to a great extent on the style considered early’ (1997:275). It seems that other palaeographers, according to Shanks, are also not prepared to confine the writing to
the 8th century. Since most of the other aspects (only the century [9th or 8th] being contested) of the seal point to the owner being a royal lady, not being a palaeographer myself, on a balance of probabilities, it would not be unreasonable to give Korpel the benefit of the doubt. In the final analysis it will make no difference to the conclusions of this study regarding the Egyptianizing of Hebrew seals of the period.



176
that direction:
i) The size of the seal, 30 x 22 x 10 mm. This is considerably bigger than the
average seal from the period, which on average was about half to two-thirds of
that size. It may indicate the importance and/or wealth of the owner (Korpel
2008a:37). The quality of the carving and overall is one of excellence and
even Avigad, who was not prepared to identify the seal positively as
belonging to the biblical Queen Jezebel, admitted that the quality of the seal
was worthy of a queen (Avigad 1964:275).
ii) The symbol of the uraeus had been a symbol of kingship and royalty from the
earliest times (Geddes & Grosset 1997:471). It represented their power (Ions
1997:15). During the Eighteenth Dynasty, Egyptian queens began to wear the
double ureaus. It apparently represented Upper and Lower Egypt; one cobra
was sometimes depicted with the red crown and the other with the white
crown, the one cobra most probably was Wadjet (Buto) and the other a
representation of Nekhabet in the form of a snake for uniformity. The crowns
on the uraei were often replaced with Hathor horns with solar discs. The
double ureaus was not confined to queens but were also sometimes worn by
goddesses. The concept ‘queen’ refers to the pharaoh’s principal wife or his
mother (Robins 1993:23-24). In the seal under discussion, it seems therefore
to represent a queen. I submit that, despite the statement of Avigad & Sass
(1997:275) that the ‘Gender of the owner is uncertain’, there is a further
indicator that the owner was a woman. The flail at the back of the falcon



177
represents Min, a god of fertility, who was depicted on many amulets worn by
women (Oakes & Gahlin 2007:456).
iii) Various other royal symbols such as the double crown are portrayed on the
seal. Although no specific ritual scene seems to be intended, the symbols do
not only to represent royalty, but also an association with and the protection
and influence of the gods.
From the earliest times Horus, represented as a falcon, was closely associated
with Egyptian royalty and regarded as a special protector of kings. The
symbol of the falcon was often used on a royal seal. The first of the array of
the king’s names was always a Horus-name, denoting that particular king. It
associated the king with a particular aspect of the god (Geddes & Grosset
1997:379-380).
The winged sun disk became known through the Egyptian ‘Legend of the
Winged Sun Disk’ which concludes ‘and this is the winged sun disk which is
over the sanctuaries of all the gods and goddesses of Egypt, for their sanctuary
is also that of Horbehûdti’ (Wiedemann 2001:75). It is also known as the
Great Protector of not only the gods and goddesses, but also of royalty
(Wiedemann 2001:76-77).
The winged sphinx seldom appeared in Egyptian history and mythology.
During the New Kingdom the winged sphinx became to symbolize the power
of the pharaoh who tramples his enemies during war.



178
Figure 35: Line drawing of a wooden side panel from Pharaoh Thutmosis
IV's throne found in his tomb. He is shown as a winged sphinx trampling
Egypt's Asiatic enemies.
(Smith 1960:123)
Albright (1938:2) argues that the biblical cherubim and the winged sphinx
were the same: ‘...the Lord Almighty, who is enthroned between the
cherubim’ (1 Sm 4:4). The description of the positioning of the cherubim on
the Ark of the Covenant in Exodus 37:7-9 shows them in a position guarding
the central part of the Ark and that is the section where Yahweh is enthroned.
It creates the impression that they act as guardians (Cf, Botterweck, Ringgren
& Fabry 1995:318, where it is argued that other creatures may be in
contention for the concept ‘cherubim’). According to Albright the wingless
sphinx prevailed in Egypt, but in Syria and Palestine, the winged sphinx
(griffin) is more prominent. Regarding the cherub throne where Yahweh
appears to have been seated:



179
‘It is more probable that the impulse for the use of the throne came from
Phoenicia, where (sometimes empty) cherub thrones appear in widespread and
fairly continuous use from the end of the second millennium all the way into
the Hellenistic/Roman Period, being used in Iron Age IIC seals ...’ (Keel &
Uehlinger 1998:168).
The popularity of the winged sphinx in Phoenicia also points to the possibility
of the owner having a Phoenician background, like the biblical Jezebel. This
popularity also appeared in the Northern Kingdom as evidenced inter alia by
the Samaria ivories where three examples of winged sphinxes were found.
Figure 36: Winged sphinx. Ivory from Samaria
(Pienaar 2008:57)
Although the original meaning of sphinxes seems to have been lost through
the millennia, it apparently started with the Great Sphinx at Giza, from where
the concept spread throughout the ancient Middle East. What is clear,
however, is that it was always associated with power, whether relating to the
gods or a pharaoh (Werness 2006231). In Egypt it probably started with
Pharaoh Khafre of the Fourth Dynasty and was used throughout the history of



180
Ancient Egypt. Even the Eighteenth Dynasty female Pharaoh Hatshepsut
attempted to have herself immortalised in this form (see Figure 37 on the next
page). Thus, it is contended that the winged sphinx on the seal of Jezebel
denotes royalty. Although impossible to prove, the face of the sphinx may
even be the face of the owner, in which event it is submitted that only a king
or queen would have the audacity to depict him or herself in that form to
demonstrate his or her authority. On the other hand, it is more likely that it is a
portrayal of Astarte (Anath), the main goddess of Sidon, from where Queen
Jezebel hailed. If Korpel (see p.35 footnote 16 above) is correct in her
contention that it is but a Hathor headdress, then it is most probably Astarte.
There was a close association of Astarte with Hathor by the Phoenicians (see
‘ANATH’ under ‘PHOENICIAN GODS AND GODDESSES’ in
ANNEXURE B).



181
Figure 37: Sphinx of Hatshepsut at Memphis.
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
At the bottom of the seal is a bent flower, which appears to be either a lotus or
a lotus bud. The lotus closing its petals every night and reopening them in the
morning became in ancient Egypt a symbol of rebirth and of Ra who died
every night and was reborn every morning. Korpel (2006:3600 and her quoted
sources) alleges that it also portrays a vain lady and that Egyptian queens were
often depicted with lotus flowers in their hair. It is also known that Egyptian
women in general used to wear lotus flowers in their hair (Armour 2001:1).
I do not think one should attach too much importance to the assertion that the lotus
flower necessarily represents a queen. It may however be symbolic of a woman.
Another obstacle (one being the relevant century [see footnote 16 on p.35 above]) in
identifying this seal with Queen Jezebel, seems to be that the spelling of the name
Jezebel on the seal (YZBL) seems to be different from the spelling in the Bible where



182
it is  ̓Y ZBL . A tird factor is that it does not contain the prefix ‘belonging to’, which
was normally in front of a name on a seal to depict ownership. I agree with Korpel
(2008:36-37) that the aleph ( ) and the lamed ( ) ‘to’ or ‘belonging to,’ most
probably were in the damaged top section of the seal.
A further factor to be kept in mind is that Jezebel was apparently a rare Phoenician
name (Korpel 2008a:35), so there could not have been many Jezebels around during
the period, especially not one who rated such a fancy seal.
b. Conclusion
Unless another similar seal or bulla is found in context, we will probably never finally
solve the mystery surrounding this seal. I submit that in all the circumstances,
probabilities point to this seal belonging to the biblical Queen Jezebel. This is, in my
opinion, an example of the adoption of Egyptian religious concepts in Palestine,
probably the Northern Kingdom, via Phoenicia (Cf. Uehlinger 2005:158).
Finally as regards this seal; the various gods and other symbols portrayed do not
point, for instance, to a certain aspect of Yahweh, but rather in the tradition of
Phoenician seals of the period, to the protection of and reliance on various gods. The
symbolism on the seal reflects divinely sanctioned royal authority.



183
6.2.2 The seal of Hezekiah revisited
Figure 38: Seal Hezekiah (2)
a. Discussion
The fact that the Bible describes Hezekiah as a king devout to the religion of Yahweh,
should be seen in the context of geography and the time of his reign. These factors
also account for the Egyptians. In 733 B.C.E. the Assyrians invaded and destroyed
the northern part of the Northern Kingdom of Israel. By 720 B.C.E. the rest of Israel
and Philistia was in the hands of the Assyrians who also started a resettlement
program. Judah only escaped by paying tribute to the Assyrians, but was now, except
for Egypt to the south, isolated from the rest of the world. For Egypt the trade routes
to the north, excluding contact with Judah, were closed. This was the inheritance of
King Hezekiah when he became king of Judah in ca. 715 B.C.E. In the event a closer
relationship between Egypt and Judah was unavoidable. In 701 B.C.E., as a result of
King Hezekiah’s rebellion against Assyria, Judah, except for Jerusalem, was also lost
to the Assyrians, further isolating the Judahites and confined them to Jerusalem.



184
In this context, it is, therefore, to be expected that Egyptian influences would infiltrate
Judahite society even up to the highest level, including royalty and government
officials. Earlier during the eighth century there had indeed been a movement towards
the application of Egyptian royal symbolism on Judahite seals. It could have been a
good political and diplomatic ploy for Hezekiah to take an Egyptian royal symbol for
his official seal. In a strange and inexplicable turn of events the Judahites, as has been
noted previously in this study (see pp. 40-41 and 166-174), moved away from
Egyptian royal symbols towards Egyptian religious symbols and despite the reformist
image of Hezekiah, this trend continued during his reign.
On the other hand, as Keel and Uehlinger have observed (1998:279), in view of the
abundance of Yahwistic names in the Bible during Iron IIB an C, the impression is
created that Yahweh continued to be the sovereign God in Judah and Israel.
b. Conclusion
One should not read too much into the symbol of the two-winged scarab pushing the
solar disk. As discussed above in subparagraph 6.1, this symbol was probably used to
portray God’s supremacy in the universe in the same vein as the sun rules supreme
over the other celestial bodies. In various religions this symbol were not always used
to portray the sun god per se (Ornan 2005:209). Yahweh Himself is not portrayed;
neither is Amun-Ra or any other sun god, but rather his authority as the supreme God.
There is not necessarily an adherence by Hezekiah to the religious principles of the
Egyptians, but it could be the acceptance of an Egyptian religious symbol to represent
an aspect of his own God, Yahweh.



185
6.2.3 Seal Belonging to Elishama ʽson of the king’
Figure 39: Seal belonging to Elishama ‘son of the king.’
(Avigad & Sass 1997:53)
a. Description
According to Avigad & Sass (1997:53), the current location of this seal is not known
and was bought in Jaffa and it allegedly originated in Tyre.
The seal is a scaraboid carved from an unknown greenish stone. Its dimensions are
24x 20 x ? mm. It has a single-line border with two double-line field dividers.
In the top register is a four-winged ureaus with a double-crown depicted.
The lower two registers contain the inscription:
‘Belonging to Elishama ʽson of the king.’



186
According to Avigad & Sass (1997:53) this seal dates to the eighth-seventh centuries
B.C.E.
b. Discussion
Several people with the name Elishama45 are mentioned in the Bible. In Numbers
1:18, Elishama, son of Ammihud is chosen as leader of the half-tribe of Ephraim. In 1
Chronicles 7:26 this same Elishama is shown to be the grandfather of Joshua.
According to 2 Samuel 2:16 and 1 Chronicles 3:6, two of King David’s sons were
named Elishama. One of the priests sent by Jehoshaphat to teach the people the law (2
Chr. 17:8) had the same name. The secretary of king Jehoiakim was also a person
called Elishama (Jr 36:13). Another possibility as owner of this particular seal is to be
found in 2 Kings 25:25 and Jeremiah 41:1, where the exploits of a Judahite rebel
leader is described. He is referred to as: ‘...Ishmael son of Nethaniah and grandson of
Elishama, who was of the royal family....’ The latter two seem to be the strongest
contenders in biblical context as a probable owner of the seal. The fact that the
Judahite rebel is described as being of the royal family makes his grandfather a
stronger contender than the secretary of the king. There are two Egyptian symbols in
the top register of this seal. At the top is a four-winged uraeus wearing the double
crown of Egypt.
45 The name Elishama means ‘my God has heard’ or ‘whom God hears’ or ‘God hears’ or ‘the Lord heard’. It has been suggested that the name is Yahwistic because an inscription dated to about 700 from Khirbet Bet Lei assumes that Yahweh is identical with El and the owner was probably a Judahite (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:311). Cornelius (2008:112) points out that this surmise was the result of an identification by Dalman (1906) who deduced the YHWH-name from the El in Elishama but according to Keel & Uehlinger (1998:312) other deities are also possible candidates and perhaps it is best described as YHWH as a lunar El.



187
Although it has been suggested that the four-winged scarab was a symbol for the
Northern Kingdom of Israel (Tushingham 1992:61-65), this does not seem to also
apply to the four-winged uraeus.
In Egypt the ‘double crown’ (pshent), also known as ‘Two Mighty Ones’ was a
combination of the red crown of Lower Egypt and the white crown of Upper Egypt
signifying the unification of the two lands (Harris 2001:100). On the other hand it
also illustrated the authority of the pharaoh as the ruler of a unified land, thus it is a
symbol of kingship. In this depiction I submit that the double crown is used to signify
royalty and perhaps a direct relationship with the king. This may therefore be a
further indicator that the Elishama involved, is the person referred to in 2 Kings 25:25
and Jeremiah 41:1.
In 2 Kings 25:25, Elishama is described as the grandfather of the rebel, Ishmael. This
takes Elishama probably back to the reign of the reformer king, Josiah.
In Egypt, the ureaus had always been a symbol, not only as representing the sun god,
but also of royalty (Geddes & Grosset 1997:471). In this instance we have the winged
uraeus, which should be regarded as representing a deity rather than royalty. The
wings stress not only the protective element, but also the celestial aspect, in that the
four wings show that the god who is protecting is also a celestial being (Keel &
Uehlinger 1998:195, 251). The winged uraeus is above the name of the owner, thus
46
46After, Josiah (who reigned for 31 years), Jehoahaz only ruled for three months, before Pharaoh Neco, replaced him with Josiah’s son Eliakim and renamed him Jehoiakim. The latter ruled for eleven years and was succeeded by his son Jehoiachin, who only ruled for three months before he was taken captive to Babylon. Nebuchadnezzar made Mattaniah king and renamed him Zedekiah, during whose reign Ishmael lived and rebelled (2 Ki 23-25). The time spans involved, place Elishama in the time of Josiah.



188
protecting him, most probably indicating that the owner (living in the time of King
Josiah, loyal to Yahweh) regarded himself to be under the protection of Yahweh, the
winged uraeus being a symbol of Yahweh’s protective powers.
6.2.4 Seal belonging to Manasseh son of the king

a. Description
It is a scaraboid of a dark brown conglomerate stone with white and pink veins. It is
perforated and its dimensions are 17 x 14,5 x 9 mm. It has a single-line border and
two double-line field dividers, thus dividing the seal into three registers. Its find
context and present location are unknown.
In the top register is a two-winged scarab pushing a solar disk with two more solar
disks below the tips of the wings.
In the middle and bottom registers are the words:



189
Avigad & Sass (1997:55) translate this inscription to read ‘Belonging to Manasseh
son of the king.’
b. Discussion
According to the Bible (2 Ki 20:21 and 2 Ch 32:33), Manasseh succeeded his father,
king Hezekiah, as king of Judah.
Avigad & Sass (1987:202) states that Manasseh, the owner of this seal, was ‘perhaps’
the son of Hezekiah. It seems that it is not a mere possibility, but a strong probability,
although the Bible states that he was only twelve years old when he succeed his father
as king. Comparing this seal with the one of King Hezekiah (see the discussion in
paragraphs 1.5.1 (pp. 38-42 above) and 6.2.2 (pp. 183-184 above), the same symbol
of the two-winged scarab appears on both these seals.
The two-winged scarabs are known in particular from the 14Tlmlk14T seal impressions on
storage jar handles found all over the territory of the former Judah, all positively
dated to the late 8th century B.C.E. and during the time of King Hezekiah. It seems,
therefore, that the scarab was the official state emblem in Judah during the reign of
King Hezekiah (Mazar 1992:455-458; Cf Tushingham 1992:61-65).
In Hezekiah’s time the symbol of the two-winged scarab was probably connected in
some way with Yahweh. The Bible tells us that Manasseh was an evil king who did
not worship Yahweh. At this stage it is not possible to establish if Manasseh
continued using this symbol as the official state emblem after his succession as king.



190
It stands to reason that while he was still the crown prince his seal would reflect the
official emblem of his father.
6.2.5 Seal belonging to Ushnâ servant of Ahaz
Figure 41: Belonging to Ushnâ servant of Ahaz
(Avigad & Sass 1997:5, 51)
a. Description
According to Avigad & Sass (1997:510) this seal is currently in the Yale Babylonian
Collection at New Haven. It is a scaraboid (the popular form in the region during the
relevant period) of orange carnelian, perforated, with dimensions 15,5 x 11,5 x 4 mm.
It has a double-line border and two field dividers.



191
In the top register is a solar disk with ram’s horns, flanked by two outward looking
uraei. On top of the ram’s horns are three Atef crowns flanked by uraei (also outward
looking). An inscription with field dividers is contained in the two lower registers. It
reads:
‘Belonging to Ushnâ servant of Ahaz.’ (see also Avigad & Sass (1997:81 para
99,100). Ushna is a Hebrew personal name which does not appear in the Bible. It is
probably a shortened form of a theophoric name such as snyhw with the root ws, to
give (strength) (Fowler 1988:335).
The use of the scarab (beetle) shape of the seal as well as the motifs of the uraeus (the
sacred asp of the headdress of the Pharaohs) and the Osiris crowns suggest that the
iconography is borrowed from Egyptian prototypes. The inscription is written in the
ancient Hebrew script and not the square Assyrian characters which were introduced
in the Second Temple period and are in use till the present. Though we do not know
who Ushnâ was, the Ahaz mentioned in this seal, was most probably the eighth
century B.C.E. king of Judah (742-726 B.C.E.) mentioned in 2 Kings 16-17 and 2
Chronicles 28.
b. Discussion
The Bible tells us that King Ahaz, in contrast to his son Hezekiah who was a devout
worshipper of Yahweh, deviated from the Yahweh-religion and despite several
punishments by the hand of Yahweh, he persisted with these religious practises: ‘In



192
his time of trouble King Ahaz became even more unfaithful to the Lord... In every
town in Judah he built high places to burn sacrifices to other gods...’ (2 Chr 2:22-25).
Although we do not know exactly who Ushna was, the quality of the seal, the fact that
it contains both an inscription and iconography and the description that he was a
servant of Ahaz, signify that he was a high official, probably a minister. Since he was
attached to a sacrilegious king, it will also affect the meaning of the symbolism on the
seal. An important factor is the ram’s horns attached to the solar disk.
In Egypt the god Amun is represented on many monuments with ram’s horns (Farnell
2004:96; Sansone 2004:175; Ellis 1994:7) (see Figures 66 and 67 on p. 272).
Originally, before the advent of Amun, the ram headed Khnum was the patron god of
royalty in Upper Egypt (Clark 2000:137). Alexander the Great was always shown
with the ram’s horns of Amun-Ra (Fage 1976:150). Sometimes Osiris was shown
with ram’s horns (Najovits 2004:203) or ram’s horns were added to his atef-crown
(Shorter 1937:46). According to Hastings (1910b:792), Ra and also Nephthys were
sometimes shown with a solar disk and ram’s horns. Isis, although in the later history
of Egypt depicted with the cow horns of Hathor, was sometimes, as a female
counterpart of the Ram of Mendes, shown with ram’s horns (Wallis Budge 1973:281;
2003b:203.)
The depiction on this particular seal is also reminiscent of the ṯnj -crown of Tutu
being ‘two ostrich feathers with a solar disk, set upon ram’s horns and flanked by
cobras’ (Clarysse, Schoors & Willems 1998:142).
It is extremely doubtful that the intention was to portray Khnum, Nephthys or the
crown of Tutu. During the relevant period not one of these gods was of any



193
importance, not even in Egypt. Isis, outside of Egypt, was normally depicted in her
accepted form of the period, i.e. with Hathor horns and a solar disk. The atef-crowns
are definitely indicating Osiris and this crown was sometimes shown with ram’s
horns, but again it is doubtful in this instance for they are attached to a solar disk. It
rather seems as if the owner wanted to portray Amun-Ra with this combination.
Thus we have the following scenario: Osiris flanked by two uraei and Amun-Ra
flanked by two uraei. The ureaus represented the essential meaning of kingship in
Egypt, that of protector (Stanwick 2002:34). Wadjet, symbolised as the uraeus was
the protector of Ra (Te Velde 1971:81). The uraei on this seal can only be inter
preted as representing the protective forces of the gods. Thus we have Amun-Ra as
the protector in life and the symbol of resurrection and Osiris (here represented by the
atef-crowns) as the protector in the afterlife.
The variety of Egyptian symbols on this seal (Osiris, Amun-Ra and the uraei)
convinces me that the owner of the seal did not intend to reproduce certain aspects of
Yahweh but rather that he relied in the original Egyptian gods themselves. The fact
that Osiris is included makes it doubtful that Phoenician gods were intended. The
description in the Bible ‘high places to burn sacrifices to other gods’ seems to include
gods of Egypt and was not confined to Phoenician gods such as Baal and Astarte.

6.2.6 Seal belonging to Abiyau servant of  ̔Uzziyau
Figure 42: Belonging to Abiyau servant of
 ̔Uzziyau .
(Avigad & Sass 1997:51)
a. Description
This seal is currently in the Chandon de Briailles collection in Paris. It is a scaraboid,
unperforated with a single-line border. Its dimensions are 16 x 12 x 4 mm.
It contains the inscription:
‘Belonging to Abiyau servant of  ̔Uzziyau .’



195
The motif is clearly Egyptian. It depicts the child Horus kneeling on lotus flowers.
On his head are Hathor horns with a solar disk.
b. Discussion.
There can be little doubt that the ‘Uzziah referred to on this seal is the one who
became the tenth king of Judah in ca. 767 B.C.E. His name is Yahwistic meaning
‘Yahweh is my strength.’ Abiyahu appeared to have been a minister or high official
in the court of king Uzziah (Keel & Uehlinger 1998:272), whose name is also
Yahwistic, ‘my father is Yahweh.’
According to the Bible (2 Chr 26), Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became
king and he ruled for fifty-two years. ‘He did what was right in the eyes of the
Lord...’ (2 Chr 26:4). The Bible does not record where King Uzziah was buried but
states that he was not buried in the royal necropolis but outside the city because he
died a leper (2 Chr 26:23). Direct proof, outside the Bible, of his existence came in
the form of a discovery made in 1931. It was as plaque (Figure 45 on the following
page) which referred to his second burial and ossuary containing the Aramaic
inscription: ‘Hither were brought the bones of Uzziah king of Judah; not to be
opened’. The ossuary containing the bones has been lost (Paul & Dever 1973:125).
This is one of the few instances where there is a direct connection between a
particular Israelite/Judahite king and an archaeological discovery. In more recent
times, the seals of King Ahaz and King Hezekiah contibuted to this meagre collection
47
47 Abijah is a name borne by several men and women in the Bible. The most important are the second son of Samuel (I Sa 8:2; I Ch 6:28); the son of Jerobeam I (1 Ki 14:1-18) and the second king of Judah, the son and successor of Rehoboam (1 Ch 3:10; 2 Ch 11:20; 13:11).



196
of the heirlooms of the royalty of the Israelite kingdoms. There are also indirect
evidence, such as the seals of officials, like the current one, referring to their royal
masters by name.
Figure 43: Plaque referring to the second burial ossuary of King Uzziah
(Paul & Dever 1973:126)
In this instance we have a king loyal to Yahweh with a Yahwistic name and an
official of the king, also with a Yahwistic name. We can state with a fair degree of
confidence that the iconography on the seal, although Egyptianised, did not intend to
portray foreign gods as such. The ‘borrowed symbolism’ will have to be interpreted
in the context of Yahwistic concepts.



197
The central figure is the naked young Horus kneeling on a lotus flower.48 I
horns, may be correct in essence, but it should be remembered that during this period
(Late Period) Isis, especially when shown with the infant Horus, was often depicted
with ‘Hathor’ horns and a sun disk.
submit that
a further factor contributing to the conclusion that it is the young Horus, is the horns
with the sun disk. The statement by Avigad & Sass (1997:51) that they are ‘Hathor’
.
Figure 44: Isis with Hathor horns and sun disk suckling the child Horus.
(Harris 2001:67)
My conclusion is that one should not attach any other meaning to the ‘Hathor’ horns
with the sun disk. It is significant that the horns seem to be attached to the head of
Horus; it shows a bond between the two symbols and one could not get a closer
physical bond than that between mother and child; the one growing from the other.
48 Avigad & Sass (1997:51) suggest that it may also be papyrus plants. I cannot agree. The central plant is clearly an open lotus flower, flanked by two closed flowers or lotus buds. There is no comparison with papyrus plants (see Figure 101[p.305] for lotus flower under ‘LOTUS FLOWER’ and Figures 111 and 112 [p.318] for papyrus flowers under ‘PAPYRUS’ flowers in ANNEXURE. B).



198
Sass 1993:238 speculates that these horns could be a Phoenician misrepresentation of
the double crown of Egypt. I do not agree, these are clearly Hathor horns with a sun
disk identical to those in Figure 44 (see previous page). This suggestion by Sass is not
repeated in the later work by Avigad and himself (Avigad & Sass 1997:51).
I submit that these horns (with sun disk) are Hathor horns and were intended as such,
but were attributed to Isis to merely emphasise that the figure is indeed the son of Isis,
the infant Horus.
In Egyptian mythology the fact that the young Horus is depicted on top of a lotus
flower means that he is symbolising the sun child. The child Horus (Harpocrates, as
he was Hellenized by the Greeks) personifies the first strength of the sun after the
winter, thus the ‘sun child’, and also the image of early vegetation, thus fresh growth.
The lotus flower in itself as a symbol of Ra, represents resurrection and the
combination with the infant Horus enhances this concept. Horus, after all, was
conceived in the underworld (the world of the dead) when Isis went there to be
impregnated by Osiris. The fact that Horus was then born in the world of the living is
a strong symbol for signifying new life after death (the summer after the winter) and
thus resurrection.

6.2.7 Seal belonging to Asap
Figure 45: Seal belonging to Asap
(Avigad & Sass 1997:77)
a. Description
This seal was found at Megiddo and is dated by Avigad & Sass (1997:77) to the
eighth century B.C.E. According to Ussishkin (1994:421-422) this seal is somehow
related to the gate at Megiddo; it was found at the elevation of the floor near the front,
left chamber of the gate in an area covered by brick debris of the fallen gatehouse.
The strata are unknown, but are possibly III-II. It is currently in the Archaeological
Museum, Istanbul. It is a scaraboid made of lapis lazuli, unperforated with
dimensions 19 x 14 x 6 mm. It has a single-line border and one field divider.
In the top register is a winged ‘griffin’ wearing a kilt and the double crown of Egypt.
It faces an ankh on a pedestal (Avigad & Sass 1997:77).



200
In the bottom register the name is inscribed. The closest we get to the name
‘Asap’ in the Bible is Asaph, an anglicised name of the Hebrew ‘Asaf’, a name
attributed to various persons in the Bible (1 Chr 6:39; 1 Chr 9:15; 1 Chr 15:17; 1 Chr
16:5-6); 1 Chr 25:2 Is 36:3). It means ‘he collected’, ‘gathered’, ‘gatherer’ (Boyd
1952:14; Stabnow 2006:109). It is obviously the same name, especially if one looks
at the pey (Ancient Hebrew: ) at the end which can be pronounced either ‘p’ or
‘ph’.
b. Discussion
Avigad and Sass (1997:77) call the creature on the seal a ‘griffin.’ I submit that it is,
in Egyptian tradition, a sphinx with a falcon head (to which the wings of the falcon
were added), the original Egyptian seref, which in classical times developed into the
well-known griffin with the body of a lion and the head of an eagle. In ancient Egypt
both the lion and the falcon (Horus) were associated with the pharaoh and this
combined creature also symbolised the pharaoh (i 0TParcerisa 1980:50)0T. This conclu
sion is justified by the fact that in most of the depictions of this Egyptian creature that
I have studied, it wears the Pshent (double crown) of Egypt.
The falcon headed sphinx seems to have been a very popular symbol during the 8th
century B.C.E. on Phoenician, Israelite and other West Semitic personal seals,
especially on seals from the Northern Kingdom (see for instance Avigad & Sass 1997
para. 44, 85, 116, 135, 143, 160, 168, 182, 190, 193 198, 345, 370, 1069, 1112, 1123
and 1172). For brevity sake and to conform to the various scholars, I will also call the
creature a griffin.



201
In front of the griffin is a cartouche on a pedestal, enclosing the ankh-sign. The
cartouche is a further indicator that the griffin is intended as a king. The ankh is
intended for the king’s functions to maintain order and be a just ruler.
Here we have a seal from the Northern Kingdom during the eight century B.C.E.
bearing Egyptian symbols. The ankh is clearly a religious symbol while the
association of the sphinx, not only with the king, but also with the Egyptian god
Horus, also signifies a religious connotation. The Phoenician tradition of inscribed
seals belonging to royalty and officials were probably followed in the Northern
Kingdom. This would make Asap a minister or other official and would explain the
symbolic representation of the king. On the other hand, the name Asap was mostly a
priestly name, so the probabilities are that he was a priest, thus a religious official. If
this is indeed the case, the griffin might have been intended to signify a cherub (May
1936:197-198).
In order to illustrate the point and without going into detail with each individual seal,
I am going to show and briefly discuss two more seals with griffins, which have
Israelite connotations. The comments in the current paragraph will apply mutatis
mutandis to these seals.

6.2.8 Seal belonging to ḥmn
Figure 46: Seal belonging to ḥmn
(Avigad & Sass 1997:99)
a. Description
It is a scaraboid of black serpentine with white spots, unperforated with dimensions
15,5 x 11 x 5 mm. It has a single-line border and a single-line field divider dividing
the seal into two registers.
It was discovered at Megiddo, but was unstratified. It is currently in Jerusalem (IAA).
The seal is dated to the eighth century B.C.E. (Avigad & Sass 1997:99).
In the top register is a striding winged griffin, wearing an Egyptian kilt and the double
crown, looking to the right and facing an ankh. Interspersed between the legs of the



203
griffin (one leg doubling as a lamed) are letters forming an inscription (Avigad &
Sass 1997:99).
The inscription reads: ―belonging to ḥmn.
In the bottom register is a locust.
b. Discussion
The pronunciation and meaning of the name of the owner is uncertain. According to
Avigad & Sass (1997:498-499) it could be ʾ ḥmn with aphaeresis, or Ḥammon , a
hypocoristicon or ‘hot spring’.
Avigad & Sass (1998:99) states that three bullae from one anepigraphic seal and with
a similar pictorial arrangement than the current one were discovered in 1994 at
Megiddo in a clear eighth century B.C.E. context, thus assisting the dating of this
seal. This seal, being from Megiddo and dating to the eighth century B.C.E., leads to
the conclusion that it belonged to an Israelite from the Northern Kingdom.
I do not deal with the griffin and the ankh (see discussion under previous seal) but
will concentrate on the locust.
Since both the griffin and the ankh are Egyptian symbols, the probabilities are that the
locust was also intended to be interpreted in an Egyptian context. According to
Bodenheimer (1972:10) the locust in ancient Egypt was a symbol of multitude and
weakness. The ‘multitude’ refers to the swarms of locusts that sporadically devastated
the fields and crops of the Egyptians and the ‘weakness’ to their inability to take
preventive measures to avoid such devastation.
The locust hieroglyph , under normal circumstances, is merely a symbol for
the insect itself, but it may also represent large numbers of people, especially soldiers.



204
According to Biblicus (1824:554), with reference to the Greek writer Horapollo and
the Roman writer Pierius, the ancient Egyptians used the locust symbol to denote
‘men received into the fellowship of sacred things and practised in the discipline of
holy mysteries. In other words, the locust is the proper and legitimate for a priest or a
minister of religion.’ A single locust was also sometimes used to symbolise a person’s
soul (Werness 2006:201).
I do not think one should seriously consider the locust as portraying a negative aspect
on this seal. If Pierius is correct it could indicate that the owner was a priest, but it
could also pertain to ‘multitude’ in a positive sense, thus a multitude of descendants
or riches. This is, of course, pure speculation and without further information it would
be nearly impossible to arrive at a final solution.
The double crown of Egypt and the striding griffin both have the stamp of authority
and the double crown may indicate a royal person, which it normally does. I would
venture that this was the seal of at least a high official in the Northern Kingdom.
As far as I could establish the locust as a symbol appears on only three Hebrew stamp
seals so far discovered, as well as a few cylinder seals (Avigad 1968:46). I am going
to briefly refer to two more of these stamp seals.

6.2.8.1 Seal belonging to Azaryaw (son of) hgbh (Haggobeh or Haggebah)
Figure 47: Seal belonging to Azaryaw (son of) hgbh (Haggobeh or Haggebah)
(Avigad 1966: Plate 4c)
a. Description.
This seal is a scaraboid of reddish-white carnelian, with dimensions 16 x 11.5 x 9
mm. It is pieced lengthwise and is slightly damaged at one end (Avigad 1966:50). It
has no field divider and it contains an inscription in Ancient Hebrew on top with a
picture of a locust below it. The inscription reads as follows:
‘Belonging to Azaryaw (son of) hgbh (Haggobeh or Haggebah’
b. Discussion
With reference to this seal, King (1988:136) writes as follows: ‘The latter has a two
line ancient Hebrew inscription as well as a carved locust. Dating to the eighth to



206
seventh century B.C.E., this scarab is especially relevant for the study of Amos,
because the word for “locust” inscribed on the scarab is hgbh, as is Amos 7:1’.
Avigad (1966:51-52) reads the inscription as ‘Belonging to Azaryaw (son of) hgbh, to
be pronounced ‘Haggobeh’ or ‘Haggebah.’
Avigad (1966:52) comments: ‘Our seal is the first known instance among Hebrew
and related seals where a name is accompanied by a pictorial illustration of its
meaning. The locust obviously serves here as the emblem of the Haggobeh or
Haggebah family.’
In Hebrew the word for locust is which is probably derived from which
means ‘to multiply’ or to become numerous (Watson 1832:589; Marshall et al
1996:47; Cf. Ryken et al1998:516; Bromley 1988:149-150). In the Bible there are no
less than nine different Hebrew names for locusts (Marshall et al 1996:46-47) and
large numbers of armed forces, especially hostile forces are compared with swarms of
locusts (Jdg 6:5; 7:12; Ps 105:34; Jr 46:23; Jl 1:4 and Nah 3:15). Their numbers are
such that they, like the stars and the sand of the sea, cannot be counted. As a symbol
in the Bible it is mostly used in a negative context as an instrument of destruction.
They are also regarded as instruments of the wrath of God (Ex 10:4-19; Dt 28:38, 42;
2 Ch 7:13; Ps 78:46; 105:34; Nah 3:15-17).



207
6.2.8.2 Seal of Aḥiṣûr
Figure 48: Seal of Aḥiṣ ûr
(Avigad 1968:45)
a. Description
It is a scarab of red carnelian with dimensions 15 x 12 x 9 mm. The find context is
unknown and is currently in the Borowski-collection in Jerusalem. It has a single-line
border and no field divider.
At the top of the seal is a winged solar disk with its wings spread downwards. In the
centre part is a kneeling male figure with his arms reaching upwards and his hands
touching the wings of the solar disk. He has a curly beard and his hair is bound back
with a bandeau, with locks falling to his shoulders. He is wearing a kilt held at his
waist with a heavy belt. Round his legs are ropes which seem to be part of sandals



208
with ropes that were tightened above the knee. Avigad (1968:45) states that they are
muscles but they are to prominent and are without doubt not part of the man’s legs.
In front of him (on the left hand side of the seal) is the head of an ibex or goat and a
locust in an upright position. Behind him is an inscription which reads Aḥiṣ ûr .
b. Discussion
The central figure in this seal, the kneeling man, seems to be rather Assyrian than
Egyptian as witnessed by the curly beard and the hair locks. Even the sandals (?)
seem to be Assyrian (Baikie 1916:31).
According to Wilkinson (1847b:190-191) the ibex, in contrast to sheep, was not a
sacred animal in ancient Egypt, whilst the goat was sacred in the nome of Mendes.
On the other hand various Sumerian gods took the form of a goat (Mackenzie
1931:273). According to Avigad (1968:45) such motifs, as this goat or ibex,
sometimes served as space fillers on Mesopotamian seals.
The overall symbolism of this seal seems to be Mesopotamian and more in particular
Assyrian (Avigad 1968:44) although there are Egyptian undertones. Even the symbol
of the winged sun was taken over by the Assyrians (Avigad 1968:44-45). I have
included it just to illustrate another seal with the locust symbol. One can only surmise
that it also symbolises ‘multitude.’



209
6.2.9 Seal belonging to Ushna
Figure 49: Seal belonging to Ushna
Deutsch 2004:27
a. Description.
This seal and the one in paragraph 6.2.13 is discussed by Deutsch (2004). It is a
scaraboid, made of white and brown banded agate and is perforated. Its dimensions
are 11.8×15.4×3.9.mm. It has a single-line border and one single line field divider.
49
49 The discussion of this seal, as well as the one in paragraph 6.2.13, is based on an article written by Robert Deutsch. There is currently a controversy about the scholarly standing of Deutsch in view of his indictment in the forgery trial in Jerusalem regarding an ossuary allegedly bearing a forged Aramaic inscription ‘Yaakov bar Yosef akhui di Yeshua’ (‘James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus’). At this stage Deutsch has not yet been proven guilty and I agree with the editor of BAR (see BAR 35(3):6,62), that he is innocent until proven guilty. In any event this situation should not have any effect on the value of the article. It should also be noted that I do not necessarily agree with Deutsch on certain interpretations of palaeography and symbolism. I do not approach Deutsch as an authoritative scholar, but as a supplier of information. By publishing works like Biblical Period Hebrew Bullae: The Josef Chaim Kaufman Collection and the more recent Teshurot LaAvishur: Studies in the Bible and the Ancient Near East in Hebrew and Semitic Languages, information, previously difficult to access, has become freely available.



210
Its find context and present location are unknown and it appeared on the Jerusalem
antiquities market in March 2000. It is dated to the eighth century B.C.E. (Deutsch
2004:26). In the top register is a seated winged griffin, with a raised left leg, looking
towards the right Below his raised left leg is a papyrus plant and above it is an ankh
with the top part in the form of a triangle, rather than the normal oval.50
In the bottom register are five Ancient Hebrew letters inscribed, which reads:
He is
wearing the double crown of Egypt. Above his back is the hieroglyph for the sedge
plant nswt or shen the symbol for Upper Egypt (Morkot 2005:5). ‘It symbolised
infinity or eternity, as it has no beginning and no end. The word “shen” come from
shenu, “that which encircles.” The shen is the origin of the cartouche...’ (Ruiz 2001:
139). The Egyptian word for cartouche is shenew (David 1999:219). The sedge is
sometimes combined with the bee (symbol of Lower Egypt) to indicate the
Pharaoh’s authority over both lands (Curl 2005:424).
‘Belonging to Ushna.’ This inscription in Ancient Hebrew is identical to the first
five letters of the inscription on the seal in paragraph 6.2 (pp. 177-180 above), where
the name was discussed.P PI will therefore only discuss the iconography on this seal.
P
50
PSee the discussion of another variation of the shape of the ankh in paragraph 5.3.2.4 on pp.136138above.



211
b. Discussion
This seal, allegedly, comes from Sebaste, 51
The hieroglyph for a papyrus stem is . Not only was the papyrus plant the symbol of
Lower Egypt but also the symbol of life, new life and resurrection itself (Andrews
which would make its place of origin the
Northern Kingdom. We have already discussed the symbolism of the griffin
(paragraph 6.2.6 on pp. 187-188). The ankh symbolises eternity or eternal life and it
seems that the sedge has a similar meaning. I do not think one should give serious
consideration to the possibility that this symbol may represent Upper Egypt on this
Hebrew seal, even though the papyrus plant (like the bee and the cobra) was a
symbol representing Lower Egypt (Armour 2001:1). If one, however, considers the
other symbols on the seal (the ankh and the papyrus plant), I propose that its original
meaning of infinity or eternity was intended on this seal.
1994:82-83). The fact that the griffin, representing the king, has his left leg raised
above the papyrus plant symbolises, in my opinion, the power of the king over the
lives of his subordinates and over the owner’s own life. Here again the quality of the
seal, especially the carving of the symbols and the inscription, indicates a person of
importance and wealth, probably an official in the king’s service, thus his
acknowledgement of dependence on and subordination to the highest authority in the
land. The symbols further demonstrate his belief in resurrection and eternal life.
51 Sebaste, known in Hebrew as Shomron, was the capital of the Northern Kingdom of Israel during the 9th and 8th centuries B.C. The Bible tells us that it was established by Omri, King of Israel, who bought it from a man named Shemer and called it Samaria (1 Ki 16:24).

6.2.10 Seal belonging to Elishamaʿ (son of) Śarmelek
.
Figure 50: Belonging to Elishamaʿ (son of) Śarmelek
(Avigad & Sass 1997:77)
a. Description
A scaraboid of reddish sandstone, perforated with dimensions 17,7 x 16 x 7,6 mm. It
has a double-line border and one field divider in the form of two back-to-back
concaves connected at the end with lotus flowers. The inscription appears in both
registers and read:
‘ Belonging to Elishama ʿ (son of ) Śarmelek .’
There are also some dots on the seal. The seal attests to fine workmanship.
The find context and current location of this seal are unknown.



213
b. Discussion
As discussed in paragraph 6.2.3 (p.175 above), the name Elishama appears seven
times in the Bible and means ‘my God has heard’. The only ‘symbols’ that appear on
this seal are the two lotus flowers making up the ends of the field divider. They may
be there purely for decorative purposes but they may also be there to represent Ra, the
sun god and the powers of resurrection. In Yahwistic terms it may represent the
aspect of Yahweh regarding his powers to create new life and to resurrect after death.
The lack of other Egyptianizing symbols on the seal, to my mind, signifies that the
lotus flowers are either purely decorative or used to indicate a power-aspect of
Yahweh.
6.2.11 Seal belonging to Dalā
Figure 51: Belonging to Dalā
(Avigad & Sass 1997:89)



214
a. Description
It is a scaraboid of brownish red stone (possibly granite), perforated with dimensions
16 x 12 x 8 mm. It has a single-line border and no field divider. The find context of
the seal is unknown and it is currently in the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.
The dominant figure in the seal is a youthful Horus with uraei and a solar disk on his
head (Avigad & Sass [1997:89] who describes the uraei as horns, but they are clearly
mistaken). He is kneeling on a lotus flower and his arms and hands are stretched
forward in a sort of blessing (defensive?) gesture.
From the stem of the lotus flower two stalks extend to the right and the left with
flowers (buds) at their ends. From each such flower, flanking Horus, seemingly
sprouts an unidentified creature (only their heads and upper body parts are visible).
They are falcon-headed, wearing the double crown of Egypt. Their bodies resemble
the upper parts of humans. Avigad & Sass (1997:89) describe them as
‘anthropomorphic, falcon-headed, stick holding deities.’ I cannot give a better
description and the anthropomorphic forms identify them as deities. The ‘sticks’ may
also be papyrus scrolls.
At the bottom of the seal in a crescent shaped area, formed by the stalks and the
border line, is the inscription ‘Belonging to Dalā.’
Avigad & Sass (1997:89) date this seal to the eighth century B.C.E.
b. Discussion
The personal name Dalā is unattested in the Bible. The closest we get is Delaiah
(Dalaiah) (1 Chr 3:24). The Hebrew letter daleth ( ) however, goes to the root =



215
dala = draw (water). Avigad & Sass (1997:494) states that the reading is uncertain
and the name is unexplained and undefined. The name is Hebrew and one can accept
that the owner was an Israelite from one of the two kingdoms during the eighth
century B.C.E. The script is Ancient Hebrew but it is not possible to state whether it
was early eighth century B.C.E. or later. If it was early eighth century B.C.E. it would
probably have been from the Northern Kingdom and if it was late eighth century
B.C.E. it probably originated from Judah. The rest would be guesswork.
The solar disk with the flanking uraei at the top of the seal represents Ra as the
supreme god and guarding Horus. Horus is presented in the form of the sun child,
Harpocrates, thus representing new life or resurrection. The two gods emerging from
the adjacent, but linked, flowers seem to emphasise the concept. They are both
falcon-headed and could also be representative of Horus, albeit in other, more mature
form. As Osiris was the king of the dead, Horus became the king of the living (Harris
2001:163). The objects in the hands of the two deities are obscure, but they seem to
be handing it to the young Horus. To me it seems like papyrus scrolls, which may
represent knowledge. Horus appears to be blessing the deities.
Overall the depiction of the symbols, to my mind, does not reflect a representation of
any aspect of Yahwistic powers. One should interpret these symbols at face value and
not endeavour to find some hidden Yahwistic message. In this seal the owner relies
on the protection of the gods (probably Egyptian or Phoenician) to give him a good
life and after death a new life.



216
6.2.12 Seal belonging to Ḥabli
Figure 52: Seal belonging to Ḥabli
(Avigad & Sass 1997: 95)
a. Description
This seal is a scaraboid of pale amethyst and is unperforated. Its dimensions are 19 x
14 x 6 mm. It has a single-line border and a single-line field divider dividing the seal
into a large (top) and a small (bottom) register.
Its find context is unknown and it is currently held in the Hecht Museum in Haifa. It
is dated to the eighth century B.C.E.



217
The central figure in the top register is a striding man looking towards the right. He
has an Egyptian hairstyle and is wearing an Egyptian kilt covered by a transparent
garment. He is raising his right hand in blessing and in his left hand he is holding a
sceptre with two Ma’at feathers on top. Behind him is a papyrus sceptre.
In the small bottom register is an inscription in Ancient Hebrew which reads
― Ḥabli .
b. Discussion
The name Ḥabli is unattested to in the Bible and not a known Hebrew name. Its roots
are also uncertain. The name probably means ‘to share’ (Avigad & Sass 1997:496).
The conclusion that it is a Hebrew seal is based on the writing itself.
As regards the sceptre with the Ma’at feathers, see the discussion in paragraph 5.3.2.3
(p.124 above), where identical sceptres are depicted. The sceptre symbolises the
authority and power of an official. The feathers represent justice as a symbol of
Ma’at.
The papyrus sceptre was discussed in paragraph 5.3.2.2 (p.131) above. This symbol
represents life, new life and resurrection.
The workmanship of the seal is excellent and this together with the arrangement of
the symbols and the similarity of the sceptre (with feathers) to the one in paragraph
5.3.2.3, indicate a Phoenician carver and Phoenician inspiration. These facts point to
the owner being from the Northern Kingdom. In all probability he was an official, for
the same reasons as were discussed in paragraph 5.3.2.3. He raises his right hand in
blessing. This also indicates that he is a person in authority.



218
6.2.13 Seal belonging to Zaka 52
Figure 53: Seal belonging to Zaka
(Deutsch 2004:250)
a. Description.
The origin and current location of this seal is unknown. It was allegedly found in the
vicinity of Sebaste. If correct, this seal came from the northern Kingdom of Israel. It
is dated to the eighth century B.C.E.
It is a scaraboid, perforated and made of red carnelian with dimensions 9,9 x 14,1 x
6,5 mm. It has a single-line border and only one register. It is set in a silver pendant
and fixed with a wire passing through the perforation without a bezel (Deutsch
2004:25).
52 This seal and the one in paragraph 6.2.9 are discussed by Deutsch (2004:25-28).



219
The central theme of the seal is a four-winged scarab with a solar disk between the
front legs as well as the hind legs. Just beneath the hind legs is the following
inscription, consisting of three Ancient Hebrew letters:
= : zk probably pronounced ‘Zaka’, either a hypocoristicon, literally meaning
‘be pure’ or a shorter theophoric name with zkr meaning ‘remember’ (Avigad & Sass
1997:495). This name is not attested in the Bible. A similar name with the same
meaning is zky or ‘Zakkay’ (Ezr 2: 9; Neh. 7: 14).
b. Discussion.
According to the available information, this seal comes from Sebaste in the Northern
Kingdom. The four winged scarab was the royal emblem of that Kingdom
(Tushingham 1992:61-65). The workmanship on the seal is of a very high quality.
The fact that it is set in a silver pendant speaks of affluence.
‘It is generally considered that a scarab pushing a ball of dung represent the
movement of the rising sun, probably symbolizing divine protection. The solarized
emphasis in combination with the two or four-winged scarab is a common feature of
the seal iconography of both the Kingdom of Israel and eighth-to-seventh century
B.C.E. Judah, and is probably a symbol of high status’ (0TStavrakopoulou 2004:105).
0TThis seal probably belonged to a high official in the Northern Kingdom. Although the
owner does not have a Yahwistic name, the possibility of this symbol representing the
protective powers of Yahweh cannot be excluded. Without further evidence, it is
impossible to state which deity the owner had in mind with this symbol.



220
6.2.14 Seal belonging to Elamar
Figure 54: Seal belonging to Elamar
(May 1936:197)
a. Description
It is a scaraboid made of lapis lazuli, unperforated, with a single-line border and two
single-line field dividers dividing the seal into three registers. The dimensions are not
known. It was found in an unstratified context at Megiddo. Its present location is not
known.
In the small register at the top of the seal is an inscription in Ancient Hebrew which
reads: ‘belonging to Elamar.’ It means ‘God has spoken.’



221
In the middle register are two winged uraei looking inwards. The way their wings are
stretched is not unique. It was normally depicted with its wings stretched outwards,
but it was sometimes shown with wings stretched to the front (see figures 55 and 56).
In both forms protection is symbolised.
Figure 55: Uraei, including winged uraei
(Odnner 1914:32)
Figure 56: Winged uraeus protecting Hathor
(Abertawe 2007)
On the heads of the uraei are what appeared to be the red crown of Lower Egypt.
May (1936:197) suggests that it may rather be a crest than a crown. This is doubtful.
In the bottom register is a winged sphinx. The wings are stretched outwards and
upwards approximately 45 degrees an unusual depiction. Normally such wings are
stretched backwards and not outwards (see Figures 1[p.32] and 49 [p.209] above). On
the head of the sphinx is a Hathor headdress.



222
b. Discussion
May (1936:197) acknowledges the Egyptian influences in this seal. In this regard the
winged uraei and the winged sphinx with Hathor headdress need no further comment.
May continues with the comment that the name ‘Elamar’ can be compared to the
Biblical name ‘Amariah’ ( or ). He states that the name ‘Amariah’ is
almost exclusively a Levite or priestly name.P
53
PHe suggests that Elamar might also
have belonged to a priestly family. He speculates about the date of the seal and says it
possibly dates to the seventh century B.C.E. On the other hand, he also places it in the
same period as the seal of Asap (ee paragraph 6.2.7 [pp. 199-201] above), which
dates from the eigth century B.C.E. Other similar seals from Megiddo and elsewhere
also date to the eighth century and keeping in mind the Assyrian occupation during
the 7P
th
P century B.C.E., I suggest that this seal should also be dated to the eigth century
B.C.E.P
54
The interesting aspect of this seal is the position of the wings of both the uraei and
the sphinx. Although the uraei and the sphinx (especially with the Hathor headdress)
originate in Egypt, the way the wings are stretched does not reflect an Egyptian
depiction. It reminds me of the cherubim on the Ark of the Covenant: ‘The cherubim
had their wings spread upward, overshadowing the cover with them. The cherubim
faced each other, looking toward the cover’ (Ex 37:9).
P
53
PThe chief priest (2 Chr 19:11); a priest (2Chr 31:15; Neh 10:3, 12:2, 13; Ezr 10:42). A Levite (1 Chr 23:19; 24:23).
P
54
PSee paraP P6.2.8 (pp. 202-204) and para 6.29 (pp 209-211) above.



223
It seems that Elamar, probably a priest or a Levite, borrowed these Egyptian symbols
to represent cherubim with the outstretched wings to represent the protection of
Yahweh. Mindful of the location where it was discovered (in the Northern Kingdom)
and the time it was manufactured (probably the eighth century B.C.E.), the possibility
exists that he could have been a priest of Baal. In this regard the ‘El’ in his name does
not necessarily reflect a follower of Yahweh. The Baal scenario however is very
unlikely. During Iron IIB and C, the Canaanite god, El, was practically non-existent
in Phoenician religion and a follower of Baal would rather have used his name to
create a personal name. On the other hand, it was common practise amongst the
Israelites to use the name of their God in personal names. They ‘either used his proper
name, Yahweh, or El, which was regarded as an appellative practically equivalent to
Yahweh’ (Smith 1907:38). The use of the word ‘el’ in names was of common usage
amongst the Hebrews. Normally the verb preceded the noun in these names, for
example ‘Ezekiel’ which means ‘May-El-strengthen-him.’ Sometimes, as in the
present case the order of the verb and the noun is reversed.
In my opinion the owner of the seal was an Israelite, probably from the Northern
Kingdom during the eighth century, who subscribed to the Yahweh-religion and was
probably a priest or a Levite.
55
55 Despite using the names ‘El’ and ‘Yahweh’, the Israelites, as far as can be established, never used the name ‘Elohim’ in personal names (Smith 1907:38). During Iron IIB and C, the use of the name El in personal names seemed to occur very rarely in both the Northern Kingdom of Israel and the Southern Kingdom of Judah (see the discussion on p. 260 hereinafter).



224
6.2.15 Seal belonging to Peqah
Figure 57: Seal of Peqah
(Bordreuil 1986:54)
a. Description
This seal is a scaraboid. It first appeared near the end of the nineteenth century and
was bought at Nablus and is currently held in the Vorderasiatische Museum, Berlin. It



225
is made of carnelian. The dimensions are: 14 x 10 x 4 mm. It is not perforated.56
The central figure depicted on this seal is a striding man looking towards the left. In
his upraised right hand he holds an object which seems to be a spear or javelin. He
does not have a left arm (possibly as a result to the obvious damage to the seal). His
head is clean shaven and he wears an Egyptian wig. He is wearing a short tunic and a
long mantle (Bordreuil 1986:54). In front of him is an object that Bordreuil is unable
to identify and which he calls a ‘two-pronged object.’ Keel & Uehlinger (1998:264)
cannot explain the object themselves and call it ‘a cultic stand (?).’ To me it also
appears to be some sort of stand. The Egyptian hieroglyph for a stand, and more
particular for the stand of a scale is:
It
has a single-line border and no field divider.
= ts – stand
scale
Another similar hieroglyph is the one for the four pillars of the sky (N, S, E &W)
On the right side of the seal, behind the man’s back, are three letters in Ancient
Hebrew reading: ― PQH. This is vocalised as Peqah (Bordreuil 1986:58).
P
56
P Bordreuil, but for the iconography and the inscription, fails to give any description of the features of the seal. The information given here was kindly provided by Karin Rohn, Wissenschaftliche Museumsassistentin, Staatliche Museum zu Berlin, Vorderasiatische Museum, Bodestrasse 1-3, D 10178, Berlin.



226
Discussion
Bordreuil (1986:54) argues that an Egyptian seal with a striding man, wearing a
crown and staff or sceptre in the one hand, raising the other with palm forward,
usually depicted a king. If a similar striding man, without a crown, but with the staff
and raised hand, was depicted, it normally depicted a dignitary or official.
The name ‘Peqah’ is known from the Bible as Pekah, son of Remaliah. In 2 Kings 15:
25 he is identified as the šāliš of Pekahiah, the 17th king of the Northern Kingdom of
Israel (760-758 B.C.E.). Pekah led a palace revolt and killed Pekahiah and seized the
throne. He himself reigned from 758 to 738 B.C.E.57 The traditional interpretation for
šāliš is ‘the third man in the chariot.’ According to Bordreuil (1986:55) the more
recent interpretation places a šāliš in the cadre of officers as an aide-de-camp of the
king, who acts as his bodyguard and armor bearer during battle, the man ‘on whose
hand the king leans.’ The raised javelin may be representing the action to protect the
king. The šāliš as an officer and the king’s bodyguard may have been allowed to have
his own seal (Block 1998:745). Bordreuil (1986:54-55) argues that there is a strong
possibility that the owner of this seal is the same person who killed King Pekahiah
and became the 18th king of Israel. In addition to the name itself, he points out that the
place where the seal was purchased, Nablus, was close to the site of Samaria, the
capital of Israel at the time. The fact that the seal was offered for sale in Nablus,
makes it probable that it was found in the immediate vicinity.58
57 Pekah was killed by Hoshea, who became the last king of Israel (2Ki 15:30; 17:6).
58 Keel & Uehlinger (1998:264) points out that a seal impression, which was made from a seal of an official very similar to this one, was found at Shechem, which shows that such seals were indeed used in the Northern Kingdom.



227
The writing in the seal indicates that it dates to the eighth century B.C.E.
In Egyptian hieroglyphics the meaning of a stand is ‘to raise up.’ If a hieroglyph
was intended for the symbolism on this seal, I am of the opinion that it could be
translated as ‘raising up the spear,’ identifying him as a soldier, albeit a soldier of
high rank to justify his own inscribed seal. The object also looks like some sort of
pillar, so it is possible that the four pillars of the sky are intended. The same object
is also similar to the ancient Hebrew letter Y = tent peg = add, secure, hook = waw =
w,o,u. In modern Hebrew it would be = vav = v,o,u. In Latin we have the letter F. It
has, however, a sort of round pedestal which suggests a freestanding object.
I, therefore, want to propose another possible explanation for this ‘stand’ and in this
regard I think that the suggestion by Keel & Uehlinger that it may be some cultic
object is close to the mark. In my opinion this object could represent an asherah pole.
From the Bible it is impossible to arrive at a definite conclusion regarding the shape
of an asherah pole or even the concept of asherah. The multitude of books, theses,
articles and other writings on this controversial subject during the past two decades
are indications of this uncertainty.
There is therefore still a lot to be learned about the way ‘Asherah’ or an ‘asherah’ was
portrayed. As Cornelius (2004:101) correctly points out: ‘The iconography of the
goddess Asherah remains unclear. It is like the substance mercury, when one thinks
one has a grip on it, it slips away again. Asherah is perhaps the seated ruler as well as
the blessing ruler, but to go further is impossible, unless an item with an inscription is
found.’



228
Hadley (2000:80) is of the opinion that Asherah’s ‘main cultic object was probably
some sort of stylized tree’. According to the Bible, an asherah was clearly a wooden
object (Ex 34:13; Dt 7:5; 16:21; Jdg 6:25-26, 28, 30; 2 Ki 18:4; 23:4, 6, 14-15; 1 Chr
19:3; Is 27:9; Mi 5:13) (Cf. McCarter 1987:146).
Smith (2002:15) speculates that the asherah symbol originated in the cultic use of an
actual tree. Later a wooden pole was used to substitute for the actual tree.
Unfortunately I am in the same position as Hadley (2000:152) when she states the
following: ‘The iconography of sacred trees...in general, and of asherah in particular,
is far too vast a subject to consider fully here (Cf. e.g. Danthine 1937: Perrot 1937;
May 1939; Goodenough 1958; Meyers 1976:95-131; Wyatt 1981; Williams-Forte
1983; Wallace 1985; Cornelius 1988; among others).’
I submit that the object under discussion appears to be a cultic object made from
wood and that it can be seen as a stylized tree or the stump of a tree. I also want to
make the suggestion that the shape of the asherah pole was inspired by the Egyptian
ts, thus the hieroglyphic symbol for stand, ths bringing an Egyptian symbol in as a
religious cultic object in Israelite religion. In human form this object would represent

229
a figure with outstretched arms and this was exactly the way the ancient Egyptian
goddess Qudshu and Astarte were sometimes depicted (Wilson 2006:230-231). The
same can probably be said of Asherah.
Unfortunately Asherah has not yet been clearly identified. Cornelius (2004:99) states:
’...no iconographic item has yet come to light with her name on it.’ Until such a
discovery is made, speculation will be rife. I am of the opinion that should the time
arrive that an asherah pole is identified beyond reasonable doubt, it will closely
resemble the symbol on this seal. A straight pole like a flagpole would not make
sense, it would be too difficult to distinguish from other poles. A shape like the item
on this seal would on the other hand make a lot of sense, not only representing a
stylised tree (a tree-stump), but also a goddess with raised arms. Furthermore, with all
the Egyptian influences in Syro-Palestine, the choice of the ts-hieroglyph as a symbol
(a wooden stand) would not be far-fetched.

6.2.16 Seal belonging to mnr
Figure 58: Seal belonging to mnr
(Lubetski 2007a:48; Sass 1993:247)
a. Description
It is a scaraboid of white stone, possibly steatite, with a black surface. Its dimensions
are 17 x 12 x 7,5 mm. It seems that the seal was set in a ring because there are four
small sockets near the edges of the seal.
At the back of the seal is a recumbent lion seen from above. On the underside, it has a
single-line border and no field dividers. In the centre is a Horus falcon with wings
stretched forward to the right. It is standing on a nwb sign and at its back is a ma’at
feather (Avigad & Sass 1997:122). At the top of the seal is a sun rising behind a hill
(ḫ’) (Lubetski 2007a:49). The inscription is just below the ḫ’.
The inscription in Ancient Hebrew letters reads: ― belonging to mnr.



231
b. Discussion.
Amongst scholars there is a difference of opinion of what the inscription, which is
written in Ancient Hebrew, means. According to Lubetski (2007c:49) the French
scholars P. Bordreuil and A. LemaireP
60
P propose that the word mnr means ‘he who
enlightens.’ Avigad (1997:512) states that the meaning is uncertain. He also refers to
Bordreuil and Lemaire and in addition quotes BaldacciP
61
Pwho interprets it to mean
‘illuminant.’ All these scholars are in agreement that the name is linked to the
Hebrew letters nr ― which means ‘candle, the source of light.’ The ‘m’― is
being perceived as a formative prefixed to the noun, or signifying m (y) as in the word
‘who’. So normally the word ― would be translated as ‘belonging to mnr’, a
name not known amongst the Hebrew names.
Lubetski (2007c:49-53) argues that the inscription should be read in conjunction with
the symbols (hieroglyphs (?), as he calls them) in order to reach an acceptable
interpretation. He argues that it is an Egyptian name written in Hebrew letters, to
show that although the owner is a Hebrew who adheres to the Yahweh religion, he is
of Egyptian descent. I agree with Lubetski (2007:50) that the symbols on the seal
have a meaning and they are not merely decorative. The Horus falcon with its
forward stretching wings can only be interpreted as indicating the protective powers
of a god. Lubetski argues that a Horus standing on gold beads (the nwb sign) in

232
Egyptian symbolism signifies authority. The lion (on the back side of the seal)
enhances the aspects of authority and protection. Both in Egyptian and Israelite
tradition the lion gives a sense of security. The Israelites understood the concept of
the Egyptian lion, because it formed part of their own cultural heritage. Both
Solomon’s temple and his throne were decorated with lions.62 The Israelite prophets
also portrayed Yahweh as a roaring lion who protects his people.
Lubetski is of the opinion that the inscription plus the rising sun (ḫʽỉ -m) and the
feather (mcʽ t ) forms a compound name which means ‘Shine” and this is the name
of the owner’s father while the owner’s name is the rising sun plus the Hebrew
inscription.
63
In the final analysis Lubetski (2007a:53) reads the inscription plus symbol as follows:
Belonging to (son of) ḫʽỉ -m mcct;
Belonging to the one who sees ʽ el in his holy abode;
(son) of Shine (it shines): truth.
I agree with his interpretation of the symbols per se, but his final conclusions,
(although very ingenious) seem a bit farfetched. Although I cannot offer an
alternative solution for interpreting the name mnr, the combination of Egyptian
‘hieroglyphs’ with Hebrew letters to compose a name seems highly improbable.
There is no suggestion in any of the three comparative examples that he refers to
P
62
P1 Ki ngs7:29, 36 and 1 Kings 10:19-20.
P
63
PJeremiah 25:30; Hosea 11:10; Joel 4:16 and Amos 1:2.



233
(Lubetski 2000:53 footnote 29) that the ‘hieroglyphs’ are combined with the Hebrew
letters to form a name. If Lubetski is correct, this would be a unique seal. I have not
encountered any other Hebrew seal with such a combination. In my opinion the name
of the owner is mnr (whatever it means) as it is written in Hebrew and the Egyptian
symbols (hieroglyphs) should be seen in the context of conveying a message rather
than a name. The rising sun was originally associated with the god Khepri, but from
the New Kingdom onwards, with Horus (Spence 1990:299), thus representing a god.
In my opinion, however, the protective symbol of Horus with stretched wings, the
rising sun and the ma’at feather should be interpreted in terms of Malachi 4:2. For
convenience sake I quote the whole verse again (see also paragraph 1.5.2[pp.38-42]
above): ‘For you who revere my Name, the sun of righteousness shall rise with
healing in its wings.’ Thus in this verse we have ‘the sun...shall rise;’ the
‘righteousness’ (ma’at) and the ‘wings’. To my mind this seal should be interpreted
as referring to Yahweh. This interpretation accords with the trend of the times to
express the powers of Yahweh by means of Egyptian symbols and does not create a
rather unique and doubtful reading of the symbols as is done by Lubetski.

6.2.17 The seal of ŠMRYW.
Figure 59: The seal of ŠMRYW
(Scott 1964:109)
a. Description.
This seal is a scarab of steatite. Its dimensions are 19 x 13 x 7 mm. It has a single-line
border. It contains three cartouches as ‘field dividers’ dividing it into four ‘registers’.
It allegedly originated at Nablus in the ancient Northern Kingdom. It is dated to the
eighth century B.C.E. (Scott 1964:110).
Each cartouche contains an inscription. The central one has an inscription in Ancient
Hebrew with the letters ― ŠMRYW, the name of the owner. The other two
cartouches have corrupt forms of what seems to be attempts to imitate the names of
two pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty, Sethos I and Thutmosis III.
In the four ‘registers’ flanking the pharaonic cartouches are various symbols which
Scott (1964:110) simply calls ‘hieroglyphic or pseudo-hieroglyphic “good omen”
signs’, without further analysis or discussion. The same four signs appear in all four



235
registers. One of them appears twice so there are actually only three different signs.
They are so crudely carved that it is very difficult to identify them. One appears to be
a sun disk ; The second one could be an attempt to symbolise an obelisk and
the third one appears to be a stylised ankh (cnḫ) .
b. Discussion
In addition to the alleged place of discovery of the seal (in the Northern Kingdom),
another indicator that it originated from the Northern Kingdom is the inscription
itself. The name ends in YW, which signifies that it probably came from that country.
‘...while names ending in the –io (i.e., the –yw) form were common in the northern
Kingdom of Israel―as evidenced by the Samaria Ostraca from the 8th century B.C.,
in names such as Abio, Gadio, Obadio, Shemario―in the Kingdom of Judah the
theophoric element was given a fuller form, -iahu (i.e., -yhw)―as seen in the Arad
Letters of the 8th-7th centuries B.C. and the Lachish Letters of the early sixth century
B.C., in names such as Abiahu, Berechiahu, Gemariahu, Obadiahu, and Shemariahu’
(Mykytiuk 2004:143). Scott (1964:108) also states: ‘the name ŠMRYW appears on
nos. 1, 13, 14 and 21 of the Samaria ostraca, which Yigael Yadin has recently and
convincingly ascribed to the reign of Menahem.’
Regarding the ‘good luck charms’, if I am correct in my deductions, the sun could
mean Ra (or Horus) as a patron god, probably Horus with all the cartouche’s
involved; the power of the sun and thus the power of the king(s) intended to be

236
honoured (see the discussion in paragraph 5.3.3.2 on pp. 147-149 above) and the ankh
for eternal life. I agree that these symbols were probably intended as ‘good luck
charms’ and not as hieroglyphs intended to convey a composite message.
The interesting aspect about this seal is that, despite the fact that it contains a Hebrew
inscription with a Yahwistic name, it also contains two cartouches with attempts to
imitate the names of Thutmosis III and Sethos I. Scott (1964:110) ascribes the
corruptions of the names to a seal-cutter unfamiliar with the authentic hieroglyphic
signs. The fact that an attempt was made to imitate the names of Thutmosis III and
(arguably the two greatest pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty and the 19th Dynasty
respectively, although Ramses II would probably have had a different opinion) shows
that the owner held them in high esteem. Both of them reaffirmed Egypt’s
sovereignty over Canaan and Syria (see discussion on pp. 16-18 above). A Judahite
who was prepared to accept aspects of Egyptian culture and religion would probably
have regarded those ‘conquerors’ of Canaan as personifying the power of the
Egyptian gods and probably requested that their names be inscribed on the seal. I,
therefore, have to agree with Scott that the corruption of their names on this seal was
probably due to the ignorance of the carver.

6.2.18 Seal belonging to ‘Naveyahu (son of) ‘Azayahyu’
Figure 60: Seal belonging to ‘Naveyahu (son of) ‘Azayahyu.’
(Lemaire 2007:13)
a. Description
This seal is a scaraboid carved from red carnelian with dimensions 13 x 10 x (?) mm.
It has a single-line border and two double-line field dividers dividing the seal into
three registers. It is of unknown origin and is currently in the Moussaieff Collection,
London. The workmanship of the seal is of a very high quality.
In the top register is the symbol of a two winged scarab with a ball between both the
front and hind legs. In the middle register is an inscription in Ancient Hebrew which
reads: LNWYHW ‘(Belonging to) Naveyahu.’ In the bottom register is an inscription
in Ancient Hebrew which reads ZRYHW ‘(son of) ‘Azayahyu’.
b. Discussion
Except for the ball between the hind legs of the scarab, the symbol on this seal is very
similar to the seals of King Hezekiah (paragraph 1.6.2, p. 38 above) and the seal of
Manasseh (paragraph 6.2.4 pp. 188-189 above), especially in regard to the rounded



238
form of the wings which is identical to the one on King Hezekiah’s seal. The
significance of the winged scarab and the balls was dealt with in the said two
paragraphs as well as paragraph 6.2.13 on pp. 218-219 above and is not repeated
here. The use of this official state symbol makes the owner probably an official of the
Judahite king.
The name Naveyahu is not mentioned in the Bible and literally translated it perhaps
means ‘praise/glorify Yahweh’. The ending of the name in –YWH indicates that the
owner was rather a Judahite than an Israelite where the name would probably have
ended in –YH (Lemaire 2007:13). See also the discussion in this regard in the
previous paragraph (6.2.17).
In order to date the seal, the two yods that present a cursive ‘tick’ at the end give us a
clue. According to Avigad & Sass 1997:53-55 such a yod is characteristic of the
Samaria ostraca, but it is also known in Moabite script and in Judah. This seems not
to be a geographical phenomenon, but rather of a chronological nature confined to the
eight century B.C.E.
Taking all the relevant factors into consideration: (i) the fact that it is an inscribed
seal of a high quality; (ii) that it is a Judahite seal; (iii) that the two-winged scarab is
virtually identical to the one on the seal of King Hezekiah and finally (iv) that it dates
from the eight century B.C.E., it seems extremely probable that the owner of the seal
was a high official in the government of King Hezekiah. It is interesting to note that
we have discussed three seals, one probably belonging to King Hezekiah, one
probably belonging to his son Manasseh and one which probably belonged to one of
his ministers, containing this symbol.

6.3 HEBREW ANEPIGRAPHIC SEALS WITH EGYPTIAN
ICONOGRAPHY
By way of introduction, I want to advance a cautionary note. The problem with all
anepigraphic seals is that one is confined to the geographical location where the seal
is found and an approximate period during which it was carved and used. This is
especially true in Judah and Israel and Judah during Iron IIB and C. There are no
inscriptions to assist in establishing whether it was from Phoenician, Hebrew,
Ammonite or any other origin. For that reason I am going to have a look at only a few
of these seals randomly selected to illustrate Egyptian motifs.
6.3.1 Hebrew anepigraphic seal 1.
Figure 61: Hebrew anepigraphic seal 1
(Giveon 1985:131)



240
a. Description
This is a scaraboid, probably made of white steatite, unperforated with dimensions
21 x 18 x 25 mm. It is set in a bronze mounting. It was discovered at Gezer and is
currently in the British Museum. In Giveon (1985:131) the seal is printed upside
down. Giveon (1985:130) dates this seal to the Late Period in Egypt.
It has a single-line border and has three registers with a single-line field divider
separating the top register from the middle register and a pedestal separating the
middle and bottom registers.
In the top register is a cartouche flanked by two uraei and just beneath the uraei two
inverted Horus-eyes (wḏ3t). The cartouche itself contains four inverted hieroglyphs:
sun with rays (3ḫu); the Horus-eye (wḏ3t); ka (k3) and the mouth (r3). Giveon
(1985:130) describes the first hieroglyph as a sun (rc
In the middle register is the hieroglyph ḥetch-t, the hieroglyph for white or anything
bright (Wallis Budge 1978c:552). It is flanked by the hieroglyphs for the sedge
(nswt) and the bee (bity), signifying ‘King of Upper and Lower Egypt’. The
hieroglyphs are flanked by two symbols which Giveon (1985:130) describes as
‘Horus falcons’. I suggest that in order to see the ‘falcons’ one has to use a lot of
imagination. To me they appear to be closer to stylised bees than falcons (note the
antennae). Since both symbols denote royalty, I submit that for purposes of this study
it is not really important which interpretation is correct.
), but this is clearly a sun with
rays.



241
The bottom register contains a pedestal flanked by two uraei. Beneath the pedestal is
a symbol which Giveon (1985:130) describes as a ‘cord design’. The closest I could
get to this design amongst the Egyptian symbols are (symbol for a wick) and
(the symbol for the goddess Neith). The goddess Neith was a major deity and
huntress in Egypt during the 26th
b. Discussion.
Dynasty (664-525), the first dynasty of the Late
Period. She was the creator goddess of Sais. Her symbol is the shield with the crossed
arrows (Geddes & Grosset 1997:408). A mere symbol of a cord would not make any
sense unless it was intended for decoration only, which is doubtful, since all the other
symbols have a definite significance.
Giveon (1985:130) states that the hieroglyphs in the top register are meaningless. I
agree that they maybe ‘meaningless’ in the sense that read together they do not make
a sensible sentence or convey an idea. In my opinion they are not meaningless when
regarded individually as symbols. We find the sun with rays, the Horus-eye, the ka
and the mouth. The sun as giver of life, the ka as the spirit and the Horus-eye as
protection against evil and giver of new life. The mouth hieroglyph stands for the
‘power of speech and thus the spoken word’ (Cirlot & Sage 1978:
The middle register seems to be confined to the acknowledgement of the supremacy
of Egyptian royalty. The ḥetch-t symbol may reflect the brightness of the god(s), but
such a conclusion would be no more than speculation.
221). The first three
hieroglyphic symbols, therefore, have a religious connotation. The rest of the symbols
in the top register, the uraei (protection) and the Horus-eyes are also religiously
inspired.



242
The bottom register appears to be devoted to religious symbolism. We have the uraei
and the goddess Neith (if I am correct). Regarding the latter it appears that she was a
very important goddess during the period from which this seal dates and she may well
be represented here.
This seal dates probably from the time of the Assyrian occupation, so it is unlikely
that its owner was an Egyptian. The meaningless arrangement of the hieroglyphs in
the cartouche points in the direction of a non-Egyptian copying various Egyptian
symbols. It is also unlikely that (given its Egyptian iconography) it belonged to an
Assyrian official or to a person hailing from somewhere else in the Assyrian empire.
It most probably belonged to a local inhabitant of the region, thus a Judahite. This is
unfortunately the problem with all anepigraphic seals found in Judah and Israel. One
is confined to the geographical location where the seal is found and an approximate
period during which it was carved and used.
Overall, the seal does not seem to convey a specific message. It rather seems an
acceptance of Egyptian symbols, especially religious symbols as ‘good luck’ charms.
The faith in the usefulness of such charms signifies a lack of faith in the omnipotence
of Yahweh.

6.3.2 Hebrew anepigraphic seal 2
Figure 62: Hebrew anepigraphic seal 2.
(Keel 1997: 655)
a. Description
This seal was discovered in the foundation of a wall at the citadel at Tell Arad. It is a
scaraboid made of steatite with dimensions 15,2 x 10,8 x 7,1 mm. It has only one
register and a single-line border. The seal is dated to the 22nd
At the top is a sphinx looking towards the right. Above his back is a sign which
appears to be a vase (ḥz). Below the sphinx on the left hand side is a papyrus stem or
a papyrus sceptre (w3ḏ). Next to it is a t-hieroglyph (bread) and underneath the t are
three vertical lines. On the right hand side is a nḫ-sign (ankh) or a lotus flower in
the form of an ankh (Keel 1997:654).
Dynasty (945-712
B.C.E.).



244
b. Discussion.
The period to which this seal is dated places ancient Arad under the rule of Judah and
therefore the seal most probably belonged to a Judahite.
The sphinx has always been a symbol of power, either of the gods or of the king
(Werness 2006:231). The sphinx also represents a form of Horus (Myer 1994:81;
The ḥz-vase, in this instance, is placed above the sphinx and seems to mean ‘to
praise’ the king or the god Horus (Keel 1995:171).
Keel 1997:654).
The papyrus sceptre was discussed in paragraph 5.3.2.2 (p.131) above and represents
life, new life and resurrection.
According to Keel (1997:654), there are various interpretations of the symbols. He
reads it as ‘Praise the lord of both lands’. This interpretation presupposes that a lotus
flower is seen rather than an ankh and that the t-sign is inverted and thus a nb-sign (a
neb, meaning lord). Keel acknowledges that the three vertical lines are difficult to
explain and therefore ignores it to arrive at his explanation. I disagree with this
explanation and do accept that the three vertical lines were inserted without a definite
purpose or meaning and purely as decoration.
Another interpretation (Schlick-Nolte 1994:443) is along a similar line and also reads
the t-sign as an nb-sign, but reads the three vertical lines as representing the Sed
festival (see SED FESTIVAL in ANNEXURE B). The normal hieroglyph for such a
festival, as contained in Gardiner’s list as O23 is or (Cf. Gardiner
1950:495). Schlick-Nolte, however, sees the three vertical lines as representing the
Sed-festival, the reasoning seems to be that in all scenes of the Sed-festival the king is



245
always portrayed with such lines (in triplicate) on both sides of the king. They
supposedly represent the three boundary markers around which the king was required
to run as part of the festival. These boundary markers symbolize the boundaries of the
king’s domain, around which he must travel (Spencer 1978:52). Spencer gives the
following example:
‘They run between the boundary markers.’
(Spencer 1978:52)
The interpretation of Schlick-Nolte thus reads: ‘Praise the lord of both lands at the
Sed-festival.’
This solution of Schlick-Nolte is very ingenious, but I am of the opinion that there is
a much simpler answer. Keel when he first mentions the three lines states as follows:
‘...darunter drei vertikale Striche (Pluralstriche?)...’
In hieroglyphics three vertical lines (strokes) indicate plurality, which mean that
an expression or idea should be understood three times (Cf. Gardiner 1950:535). The
hieroglyphs on this seal could then be interpreted to read: ‘Praise the lord of both
lands three times.’ My problem with this interpretation is that one has to read the sign
as an inverted t-sign to get the nb-sign . If one compares the symbol on the
seal with the t-hieroglyph , one finds that they are identical. There seems to
be no reason why the seal carver would have to invert a t-hieroglyph if he could have
used a nb-hieroglyph in the first place.
The Egyptians also used the three vertical lines to indicate the plural of foodstuffs
which are only written in the singular form (for instance bread, meat and wheat) (Cf.



246
Gardiner 1950:534). On the other hand if one uses it as a t-hieroglyph (bread) it
would make no sense in the context of the interpretation of Keel: ‘Praise the lord of
both lands.’ Furthermore to arrive at this interpretation Keel also reads the ankh as a
lotus flower, but gives no explanation for the oval shaped symbol above the ‘lotus
flower.’
I submit that Keel’s interpretation is not correct and that it was not intended to portray
Upper and Lower Egypt. This seal probably belonged to a Judahite. The fact that he
worshipped Horus means that he accepted an international status for Horus and would
not confine him to being the lord of Upper and Lower Egypt only.
The ankh should be seen in its normal context as the sign for eternal life; the papyrus
scepter to represent new life or resurrection; the t-hieroglyph to represent bread (or
food) and the three vertical lines to represent plurality, thus an abundance. I suggest
the hieroglyphs should be read as follows:
‘Praise (the vase) Horus (the sphinx) who gives us an abundance (the three vertical
lines) of food (or bread, the t-hieroglyph), resurrects us (the papyrus sceptre) and give
us everlasting life (the ankh).’

6.3.3 Hebrew anepigraphic seal 3
Figure 63: Hebrew anepigraphic seal 3
(Keel 1997: 655)
a. Description.
This seal was discovered in the filling material of the foundation of a brick wall at the
citadel at Tell Arad. It was made of a blue composite material and its dimensions are
11,8 x 8,3 x 5,4 mm. It has a single register and no border line.
On the base of the seal the following signs are carved: On top at the left is a falcon
and next to it are two signs which apparently have to be joined to form an ankh
(cnḫ).
Below the falcon is a papyrus plant (ḥ3) with three umbels (cluster of papyrus). Next
to it is a ỉ (reed), which Keel (1997:654) incorrectly identifies as a sw (sedge).
Keel (1997:654) dates this seal to the 22nd
b. Discussion
Dynasty (945-712 B.C.E.).
Here again, as with the previous seal, it can be argued that, keeping the period and the
situation of ancient Arad in mind, this seal probably belonged to a Judahite.



248
The hieroglyphs of the falcon (as Horus) and the ankh (for eternity, eternal life or just
life) does not pose any problems. As regards the papyrus cluster, depending on the
context, it could have various explanations. If Keel is correct in his explanation that
the other hieroglyph represents sedge (representative of Upper Egypt) then the
papyrus could be read as the symbol for Lower Egypt (Gardiner 1950:481-482) and a
reading could be: ‘Horus of Upper and Lower Egypt gives (eternal) life.’
I submit that Keel is not correct. The hieroglyph for sedge is or (Gardiner
1950:482). On the other hand the ỉ- hieroglyph is represented as (Gardiner
1950:481). The symbol on the seal is therefore not sedge but the ỉ-hieroglyph.
The ỉ-hieroglyph literally stands for ‘I’ or ‘I am’. In that event the papyrus plant
ought not to be seen as representing Lower Egypt, but rather as a symbol for fertility
or rebirth (see discussion in paragraph 5.3.2.2 on pp. 130-132 above). So these
hieroglyphs could be read as ‘I (am) Horus, giver of fertility (rebirth) and eternal life’,
or ‘I (believe) in Horus to give fertility (rebirth) and (eternal) life.’ The latter reading
is to my mind less acceptable.

6.3.4 Hebrew anepigraphic seal 4, lmlk
Figure 64 Hebrew anepigraphic seal 4, lmlk.
(Tushingham 1970:72:73)
a. Description
It is a scaraboid of banded black and white chalcedony with dimensions 15 x 11 x 9
mm. It has no border. Its origins are unknown (although the author expresses the
opinion that it was found in the northern part of Israel) and it is currently owned by
the author of the article (Tushingham 1970:73).
The flat base of the seal is smooth and contains no iconography or inscription. The
upper, rounded, surface contains a cut intaglio of a four-winged scarab beetle. The
forelegs and hind legs of the beetle clasp balls, representing the sun. It has no border
line and a single register.
b. Discussion



250
Although stamp seals are normally carved on the flat base, examples have been found
in Israel where the rounded top was carved instead of the base (Tushingham
1970:74). According to Tushingham (1970:74-76; 1992:61-62) the iconography on
this seal indicates that it is a royal seal hailing from the Northern Kingdom of Israel,
where, (according to Tushingham) the four-winged beetle was the royal symbol while
the two-winged scarab was the royal symbol of Judah. That these symbols were
mutually exclusive in the two kingdoms, is, however, not a proven fact, as discussed
in paragraph 1.5.2 (p. 40 above). In a later article Tushingham (1971:34-45) argues
that the four-winged scarab was originally only the royal emblem of the Northern
Kingdom of Israel while the two-winged scarab was the official emblem of Judah
during the time of King Hezekiah. The four-winged scarab (according to
Tushingham) only became a royal emblem in Judah during the time of King Josiah.
For purposes of this study, where both Israel and Judah are involved, I submit that it
is not really necessary, although preferable, to make the distinction.
This seal is apparently one of the seals used on the handles of wine jars in both of the
two ancient kingdoms, the so-called lmlk-seals (Lamed-Mem-Lamed-Kaf, commonly
pronounced ‘L’malekh’, meaning ‘belonging to the king’). These seal impressions on
jar handles were impressed with stamp seals in the soft clay before the jar was fired. I
submit that the use of the rounded top (rather than the flat base) on a jar handle makes
more sense than on the small clump of clay used to seal documents. Most contained
the inscription (lmlk) as well as a symbol of a winged scarab, but some contained only
the scarab-symbol (Cf. Sparks 2005:455). ‘It is generally agreed that the lmlk
phenomenon represents a government-sponsored operation’ (Fox 2000:227).



251
Tushingham (1971:34-35) argues that the royal seals of the Northern Kingdom of
Israel did not contain the lmlk-inscription; only the four-winged scarab symbol. When
these seals were later produced in Judah to stamp jar handles, the seals were crudely
carved and he speculates that the lmlk-inscription was added as a sort of
precautionary measure to emphasise the involvement of the government or the king
(Cf. Tushingham 1992:61-65).
In this regard, whether Tushingham is correct about the kingdom involved, I have to
agree that he is probably correct in his conclusion that it was a royal seal. The
meaning of the four-winged symbol was discussed in paragraph 6.2.13 on pp. 219
220 above and need not be addressed here.
6.4 CONCLUSION
In Palestine, Hebrew seals with Egyptianised iconography, some epigraphic (with
inscriptions in Ancient Hebrew) and some anepigraphic, dating from the ninth to the
seventh centuries B.C.E., have been discovered. These seals have been found in loci
from the northern parts of the former Northern Kingdom of Israel to the southern
borders of the former Southern Kingdom of Judah. I cautioned that with anepigraphic
seals it is very difficult to state with absolute certainty that the owner was indeed
Hebrew. For this reason I concentrated on epigraphic seals, but discussed a few
anepigraphic seals (all found in cemeteries and probably belonging to ordinary citi
zens). Although I had no intention to exclude cylinder seals, cylinder seals during the
relevant period were very rare in the region and I had to confine myself to stamp
seals.



252
In analysing these seals, it seems that as far as Egyptianizing iconography on seals
during Iron IIB was concerned, both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms were
involved. During Iron IIC (the period after the fall of Samaria), only Judah remained
but continued the practise. It appeared that Egyptianizing already appeared in the
Northern Kingdom during the late ninth and early eight centuries B.C.E. and only
commenced in Judah later during the eighth century B.C.E.
Symbols that appear on this selection of seals include Egyptian gods such as Ra,
Amun-Ra, Horus, Isis, Min, Wadjet, Harpocrates, Hathor, Ma’at, Osiris and Nepthys
Other symbols include inter alia the lotus flower, ankh, winged sphinx, griffin, uraei
and winged uraei, winged sun disks, scarabs and winged scarabs pushing a sun disk,
the double crown of Egypt, Atef (Osiris) crowns, cartouche, papyrus plant, papyrus
sceptre, sedge plant, sceptre with Ma’at feathers, nwb sign, the bee and the vase.
It is of interest to note that the ratio of Yahwistic names (including El names) to non
Yahwistic names of the epigraphic Hebrew seals discussed in this study roughly
corresponds with the ratio mentioned by Avigad & Sass (1997:23). Of the 25 names
on these seals, 7 have Yahwistic names and 4 have El-names, in total amounting to
44% of the total seals discussed.
It seems that kings (and maybe a queen), princes, ministers and other officials of the
king, priests and army officers are involved. The few anepigraphic seals (excluding
the lmlk-seal) apparently belonged to ordinary citizens but their find context prohibits
final conclusions.
As far as the seals could be dated, the seals from the Northern Kingdom of Israel date
from the 9th to the 8th centuries B.C.E. and those from the Southern Kingdom of



253
Judah date from the 8th to the 7th
In the premises, after analysing Hebrew seals from Iron IIB and C, I conclude that in
both Israel and Judah Egyptian religious symbols were employed to express some of
the religious beliefs of the two kingdoms. Per se the impression is created that some
of the Hebrews, including the highest echelons, adhered to Egyptian religious
concepts. This may be true, but can the Bible be ignored in this regard?
centuries B.C.E. These results are consistent with the
findings of scholars such as Keel, Uehlinger, Avigad and Sass.
On its own the Bible may not be a reliable historical source as regards the historical
development of the Hebrew people, but its main purpose was to reflect a relationship
between Yahweh and his ‘chosen’ people, the Hebrews. It contains the official
religion of the Israelites, in particular as propagated by the biblical prophets.
It would be very brave to speculate that biblical descriptions of certain kings being
true to the Yahwistic religion while others worship other gods, are not necessarily
correct, even keeping in mind that the biblical writers were probably for the most part
of Judahite descent. These writers did not condemn Israelite kings to the exclusion of
all the Judahite kings. They did not hesitate to condemn most of the Judahite kings.
Kings such as Hezekiah and Josiah were the exceptions not the rule.
Unless proven otherwise I have to accept the biblical descriptions of the Israelite and
Judahite kings and their reigns. With this in mind and using royalty and high officials
as examples which may apply as well to ordinary citizens, I conclude, in view of the
relevant seal iconography, that some of the Hebrews during Iron IIB adhered to
Egyptian religious concepts while others used Egyptian symbols to depict aspects of



254
Yahweh. It does not follow that those who practised Egyptian religion did not also
follow Yahweh. It is most probable that they had a polytheistic religion.
The view that Egyptian symbols were used to portray aspects of Yahweh and his
powers may, in the light of Malachi 4:2 (see the discussions on pp. 40 and 233
above), hold true for the following of the discussed seals: Hezekiah, Elishamʽason
of the king, Azaryaw (son of) hgbh (Haggobeh or Haggebah), Elishamaʽ (son of)
Śarmelek, Manasseh son of the king, Zaka, Elamar, Peqah, mnr and anepigraphic
seal 4 (see the discussions of each individual seal).
I submit that for the rest of the seals, keeping in mind the biblical description of the
relevant reigns, it is highly improbable that any aspect of Yahweh was under
consideration when the Egyptian symbols were chosen. The symbols on the
following seals were probably chosen with the intention to portray Egyptian symbols
in the light of Egyptian religious concepts: Jezebel, Ushnâ servant of Ahaz, Abiyau
servant of ̔Uzziyau, Asap, ḥmn, Aḥiṣ ûr, Ushna, Dalā, Naveyahu (son of)
‘Azayahyu’, Ḥabli, ŠMRYW and the first three anepigraphic seal (see the discussion
of each individual seal).
It is my contention that at least fifty percent of the Hebrew seals discussed in this
study indicate adherence to Egyptian religious concepts. This does not necessarily
follow that the owners of these seals adhered solely to Egyptian religion in lieu of
Yahwism, but it shows that they were polytheistic and their polytheism included
Egyptian religious concepts.



255
My final conclusion is that, despite the relative silence of the Bible in this regard and
the lack of monumental evidence in Israel and Judah, Egyptian religion had indeed
influenced the religion of Israel and Judah during Iron IIB and C.
CHAPTER 7
SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER
STUDY
7.1 SUMMARY
7.1.1 Introduction
‘One of the great scandals in the study of early Israelite history, to my mind, is the
near absolute barrier between Egyptology and biblical scholarship. There are very
few scholars with a strong knowledge of the relevant material in both disciplines and
a basic bias against finding any significant cultural links between ancient Egypt and
ancient Israel. Israel is sacred and Egypt is profane. The two shall not meet.’
(Greenberg 2007).
Greenberg argues that in his opinion there is a significant cultural link between
ancient Israel and ancient Egypt and he argues that this link should be investigated
with at least the same ardour that is devoted to the Mesopotamian and Canaanite
heritage and its influence on early Israelite history. According to the Bible, the
prehistory of the Israelites, contained in chapters 1-11, reflects very little, if any
Mesopotamian influence.
65



256
Although, according to the Bible Abraham initially hailed from Mesopotamia, he (as
a result of a famine in Canaan) very soon went to Egypt and struck a friendly
relationship with the Pharaoh
65
(Gn 12:10-14). Again, according to the Bible, the descendants of Jacob (Israel)
became a nation during their stay in Egypt. ‘Finally, Egypt had an enormous cultural
influence in Canaan throughout most of the biblical period. Occasionally we find first
millennium Israelite seals bearing Egyptian iconography. The scholars tend to explain
them away as Phoenician influences adapted from Egyptian influences. But if Egypt
can so influence more distant Byblos and Tyre,
Gary Greenberg is the president of the Biblical Archaeology Society of New York (BASNY). He has written several books on biblical and ancient Near Eastern history. I do not, however, quote him as a recognised scholar in the field of Biblical Archaeology, but simply because I am in total agreement with his expressed sentiments and could not have phrased it better.
shouldn't
In Chapter 1, I emphasised the continuous contact over millennia between Egypt and
the Canaanite region, sometimes as friendly commercial partners and sometimes as a
result of invasion and warfare. I argued that it is highly improbable that such
continuous contact would not result in mutual cultural exchanges, including religious
influences.
we expect it to also
influence Canaanite peoples in the cultural transmission’ (Greenberg 2007).
I then posed the question whether this contact led to the acceptance by the Israelites
and Judahites during Iron IIB and C of Egyptian religious concepts and if so to what
extent? In order to answer this question, the Bible, supposedly reflecting the religion
of Israel and Judah, would not be of much assistance, the main reason being that the
Bible was apparently mostly written after this period and tends to reflect an idealised
pure Yahwistic religion. Furthermore the Bible tends to concentrate on the religion of



257
the Canaanites, with whom the Israelites had the closest contact, as posing a threat to
the Israelite religion.
I suggested that one way of enhancing our knowledge about external influences, in
particular Egyptian, on the religion of Israel and Judah during the relevant period,
could lie in an analysis of the iconography of contemporary seals discovered in the
areas where those two kingdoms were situated. In museums and private collections
all over the world are large quantities of seals with pictures, which contain inter alia
inscriptions of the names of the owners of the seals in Phoenician, Aramaic or
Hebrew (Galling 1941:9). What Galling failed to mention is the fact that thousands of
epigraphic and anepigraphic seals were also found which contain Egyptian religious
symbols.
In defining the purpose of this current study I contended that the purpose of the
iconography could not have been purely decorative and had to have some religious
meaning. An analysis of the Egyptian iconography on these seals may contribute to
our knowledge of the religion of Israel and Judah during the time of the Divided
Monarchy and in particular during Iron IIB and C. The purpose of this study in
particular was confined to Egyptian influences (whether directly from Egypt or
indirectly via Phoenicia) on the religion of the two kingdoms during that period.
7.1.2 Chapters 2 to 4
An investigation of studies and writings indicate that, with the exception of Keel &
Uehlinger (1998), no intensive investigation has been made to establish any rela
tionship between seal iconography, especially Egyptian motifs, and contemporary



258
religious practises in Israel and Judah. Some scholars wrote a few paragraphs about it,
others just touched the subject in passing while investigating other subjects.
The meaning of symbolism was discussed and there seems to be consensus amongst
most scholars that symbols have a purpose and meaning. Symbols are used to
pictorially express ideas of significance. Dever (1987:210) defined religion as a ‘set
of symbolic thought forms and acts that relate human beings to the ultimate
conditions of existence perceived as the Holy’.
I made the point that, especially in primitive societies, symbolism was perceived in a
literal sense and not regarded as merely decorative. Even in modern world religions
symbolism plays a major role in conveying ideas pertaining to a particular religion.
The Bible abounds with symbolism where inter alia various aspects of Yahweh are
expressed by means of symbols. If an Israelite or Judahite, therefore, used religious
symbols on royal, government or personal seals, albeit it symbols of a foreign reli
gion, it could only mean that he or she intended to attach religious significance to
those symbols, especially if at seal was worn as an amulet.
It was necessary to give a brief outline of known contact between Egypt and Syro
Palestine, especially during the Dynastic period and those periods when cultural
exchanges most likely occurred. Understanding the meaning and importance of
symbolism, especially Egyptian symbolism, necessitated an understanding of
Egyptian religious concepts. Hebrew seals with Egyptianised iconography have been
referred to by some scholars as ‘good luck’ charms. In my investigation of the basics
of Egyptian religion I, for the most part, concentrated on the importance the various
gods during particular periods, magic as an element of Egyptian religion, Egyptian



259
religious symbolism and concepts such as temples, cult and rituals. The wearing of
‘good luck’ charms should at the least be regarded as a belief in magic, thus falling
within the realm of religion.
In Egypt se symbols were not just used for decorative purposes but they also were
inherent to religious and magical rituals. Any effort at understanding Egyptian culture
would be half hearted without learning more about these symbols. Any symbol on an
Egyptian seal, therefore, has a meaning. I discussed some of these symbols and
concentrated on hieroglyphs as a ‘holy script.’ For the rest I discussed the various
symbols in ANNEXURE B, whether depictions of the Egyptian gods or objects such
as the ankh, eye of Horus, djed pillar, papyrus sceptre, lotus flower etcetera.
In Egyptian religion/magic every piece of jewellery worn had a religious connotation,
the most important, both in life and death was the amulet. The seal-amulet took the
shape of the scarab beetle, which insect was regarded a holy and representative of Ra.
Millions of these seal-amulets were manufactured throughout the history of Egypt.
This type of amulet found its way to Syro-Palestine and in Israel and Judah during
Iron IIB and C the scaraboid shape was predominantly used. Scarabs, with their
Egyptian religious connotation, were, therefore, per se a religious ‘inheritance’ from
Egypt. In the time of King Hezekiah and probably also during the reign of King
Josiah, the scarab became the official emblem of the king and government. A similar
tendency during the relevant period is perceived regarding the Northern Kingdom.
7.1.3 Chapter 5



260
During the time of the United Kingdom, according to the Bible, there appeared to
have been close relations with Phoenicia, especially Tyre. I emphasised that one
should not regard Phoenicia as a political entity but as different city states, each with
its own pantheon. After the division of the kingdoms, this relationship with Phoenicia
was apparently continued, in particular by the Northern Kingdom. Some scholars
(inter alia Keel, Uehlinger and Cornelius) are of the opinion that as a result of the
geography of the area, there were Phoenician influences on the Northern Kingdom of
Israel while the Southern Kingdom of Judah was to a large extent influenced by
Egypt. I made the point that Phoenicia itself had been influenced by Egypt and that
these Egyptian influences were indirectly conveyed to the Northern Kingdom via
Phoenicia.
In order to prove the Egyptian influences on Phoenicia, I analysed epigraphic and
anepigraphic Phoenician seals. The result of this analysis was that the Phoenicians
during Iron IIB and C, to a large extent, made use of Egyptian religious symbolism in
their seal iconography. This tendency pertained to royalty, government officials and
ordinary citizens. It also seemed that epigraphic seals were confined to royalty,
government officials and merchantmen, while ordinary citizens used anepigraphic
seals. I speculated that this distinction of usage between epigraphic and anepigraphic
seals may also have occurred in Israel and Judah. It seems that the Phoenicians
substituted depictions of Egyptian gods for their own gods, but they apparently also
imported Egyptian gods to form part of their pantheons. They also made use of
various other Egyptian religious symbols to emphasise aspects of their own religion.



261
7.1.4 Chapter 6
In Palestine, Hebrew seals with Egyptianised iconography, some epigraphic (with
inscriptions in Ancient Hebrew) and some anepigraphic, dating from the ninth to the
seventh centuries B.C.E., have been discovered. These seals have been found in loci
from the northern parts of the former Northern Kingdom of Israel to the southern
borders of the former Southern Kingdom of Judah. I cautioned that with anepigraphic
seals it is very difficult to state with absolute certainty that the owner was indeed
Hebrew. For this reason I concentrated on epigraphic seals, but discussed a few
anepigraphic seals (all found in cemeteries and probably belonging to ordinary citi
zens). Although I had no intention to exclude cylinder seals, cylinder seals during the
relevant period were very rare in the region and I had to confine myself to stamp
seals.
In analysing these seals, it seems that as far as Egyptianizing iconography on seals
during Iron IIB was concerned, both the Northern and Southern Kingdoms were
involved. During Iron IIC (the period after the fall of Samaria), only Judah remained
but continued the practise. It appeared that Egyptianizing already appeared in the
Northern Kingdom during the late ninth and early eight centuries B.C.E. and only
commenced in Judah later during the eighth century B.C.E.
Symbols that appear on this selection of seals include Egyptian gods such as Ra,
Amun-Ra, Horus, Isis, Min, Wadjet, Harpocrates, Hathor, Ma’at, Osiris and Nepthys
Other symbols include inter alia the lotus flower, ankh, winged sphinx, griffin, uraei
and winged uraei, winged sun disks, scarabs and winged scarabs pushing a sun disk,



262
the double crown of Egypt, Atef (Osiris) crowns, cartouche, papyrus plant, papyrus
sceptre, sedge plant, sceptre with Ma’at feathers, nwb sign, the bee and the vase.
I pointed out that the ratio of Yahwistic names (including El names) to non-Yahwistic
names of the epigraphic Hebrew seals discussed in this study roughly corresponds
with the ratio mentioned by Avigad & Sass (1997:23). Of the 25 names on these
seals, 7 have Yahwistic names and 4 have El-names, in total amounting to 44% of the
total seals discussed.
7.2 CONCLUSIONS
After available material66
During the course of this study it appeared that during Iron IIB two major
transformations regarding Hebrew seals occurred in Israel and Judah. During the
eighth century B.C.E., seals inscribed with personal names appeared for the first time
in the two kingdoms. During the late ninth and the early eighth centuries B.C.E.
Egyptian iconography on seals were introduced in the Northern Kingdom and later
during the eighth century also on Judah. In Egypt these symbols had magic/religious
connotations.
has been studied and analysed the only question that
remains is whether this study achieved its purpose to find answers to the stated
problem Did the continuous contact and unavoidable cultural exchanges between
Egypt and Palestine result in the acceptance by Israel and Judah of Egyptian religious
concepts during the period 900-587 B.C.E.( thus Iron IIB and C) and if so, to what
extent? (see p. 21 above).
To state that the Israelites and Judahite merely copied these symbols for decorative
purposes, as has been stated in the past, would amount to the absurd. Symbolism in



263
ancient societies was not used without a purpose and that purpose was to convey a
message, idea or belief. If the symbol was a religious one the purpose would also
have been religious. An Egyptian religious symbol (or as symbol with religious impli
cations) would not have been used just to adorn jewellery.
We have seen that the seals discovered were for the most part seal-amulets. They
66 I do not suggest that all ‘available’ material has been attended to. New seals are continuously being discovered. Seals tend to disappear into private collections and are not available for study. The intention with this study was not to prepare a catalogue of Hebrew seals with Egyptian iconography, but to use representative examples to endeavour finding an acceptable answer to the stated problem.
were perforated with the intention to be worn around the neck. Amulets were believed
to have special beneficial properties and by the principle of sympathetic magic, to be
able to attract good forces to assist the wearer or, conversely, to repel a variety of
evils and dangers. Magic was not distinguished from religion and by using the
symbols on the seal to attract good forces or to repel evil forces, those symbols had to
form part of the owner’s religious beliefs.
Another factor to be kept in mind is that Egyptian iconography appears on seals of
people with Hebrew theophoric names (Yahweh and El) as well as those with secular
names.
Finally these symbols appear on seals belonging to various classes of the Hebrew
community, including royalty, government officials, priests and ordinary citizens.
These symbols are not limited to personal seals but also appear on royal and official
seals from periods when Yahwistic reformer kings such as Hezekiah and probably
Josiah ruled.
These developments in seal iconography in Israel and Judah could not have been
without a purpose. Even if one accepts the theory (as has been suggested by some



264
scholars) that these symbols were merely used to portray certain aspects of Yahweh’s
powers, the first conclusion can only be that the Judahites and Israelites did indeed
accept certain Egyptian religious concepts, albeit only in the form of ‘borrowing
images’.
It is also highly probable that Judah, as a result of its close proximity to Egypt and
especially during its isolation after the fall of Samaria, was directly influenced by
Egypt. On the other hand Israel’s close relationship with Phoenician city states such
as Tyre and Sidon, could have led to these Egyptian influences being imported
indirectly via the Phoenicians, who at that stage mainly used Egyptian symbolism on
their seals.
The final question to be answered is to what extent did the Israelites and Judahites
accept these Egyptian religious concepts? On page 1 of this study I quoted Jeremiah:
‘What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt and Assyria?...or you have as
many gods as there are cities and towns in Judah’ (Je 2:18-28).
This lament by Jeremiah corroborated by the evidence of seals, leads to the conclu
sion that the acceptance of Egyptian religious concepts went wider and deeper than
have been surmised by Biblical scholars. The latter have (according to scholars such
as Keel, Uehlinger and Dever) been so immersed in texts that they cannot see the
wood from the trees and I make this statement with all due respect to their learning,
knowledge and dedication. Pictorial evidence from ancient societies demands and
deserves as much, if not more, consideration than texts and these include the Ugarit
tablets. So much study went into the latter to prove Canaanite roots for Israelite
religion that other evidence was to a very large extent ignored.



265
I made the point that the view that Egyptian symbols were used to portray aspects of
Yahweh and his powers may, in the light of Malachi 4:2 (see the discussions on pp.
40 and 233 above), hold true for the following of the discussed seals: Hezekiah,
Elishamaʽ son of the king, Azaryaw (son of) hgbh (Haggobeh or Haggebah),
Elishamaʽ (son of) Śarmelek, Manasseh son of the king, Zaka, Elamar, Peqah, mnr
and anepigraphic seal 4 (see the discussions of each individual seal).
I further theorised that for the rest of the seals it is highly improbable that any aspect
of Yahweh was under consideration when the Egyptian symbols were chosen. The
symbols on the following seals were probably chosen with the intention to portray
Egyptian symbols in the light of Egyptian religious concepts: Jezebel, Ushnâ servant
of Ahaz, Abiyau servant of  ̔Uzziyau , Asap, ḥmn, Aḥiṣ ûr , Ushna, Dalā, Naveyahu
(son of) ‘Azayahyu’, Ḥabli , ŠMRYW and the first three anepigraphic seal (see the
discussion of each individual seal).
It is my contention that at least fifty percent of the Hebrew seals discussed in this
study indicate adherence to Egyptian religious concepts. This does not necessarily
follow that the owners of these seals adhered solely to Egyptian religion in lieu of
Yahwism, but it shows that they were polytheistic and their polytheism included
Egyptian religious concepts.
My final conclusion is that, despite the relative silence of the Bible in this regard and
the lack of monumental evidence in Israel and Judah, Egyptian religious concepts had
indeed been accepted and/or adhered to in Israel and Judah during Iron IIB and C.
7.3 RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FURTHER STUDY



266
The study of the iconography on seals to enhance our knowledge of ancient religions
is still in its infancy and the possibilities for further studies are legion. In this
particular field (Egypt and Syro-Palestine), it is clear that contact between these two
regions goes back to at least Chalcolithic times. Seals go back at least 7000 years
which takes us back way beyond the Early Bronze Age. Seals imported into Palestine
from Egypt go back to at least 3000 B.C.E. (Lapp 1989:1; Parker 1949:2).
During the Eighteenth Dynasty in Egypt, especially as a result of the expansive
policies of Thutmosis III, Egyptian influences played a major role in Syro-Palestine.
These influences only began to dwindle during the Amarna-period. A superficial
perusal of corpi such as Keel (1997) reveals that thousands of seals dating back to the
Middle and Late Bronze ages (the majority with Egyptian iconography) were disco
vered in Syro-Palestine.
Studies of seals discovered in Syro-Palestine dating back to the Bronze Age (even the
Early Bronze Age) may reveal that Egypt played a major role in the development of
religions of the region and that these religions did not solely originate in Mesopo
tamia or Anatolia. There may even have been religious exchanges between Egypt and
Mesopotamia in prehistorical times. The material in the form of Bronze Age seals
abounds; what is required is study and analysis.
I want to conclude this study with the following quotation:
‘The important thing in science is not so much to obtain new facts as
to discover new ways of thinking about them.’
Sir William Bragg (1862–1942)

COMPARATIVE CHRONOLOGIES OF ISRAEL/JUDAH AND EGYPT
DURING THE IRON AGE IN PALESTINE
Although the current debate about the ‘Low Chronology’ (involving scholars like I
Finkelstein, A Mazar, A Ben-Tor, N Coldstream and others) has been noted, it is felt
that not enough archaeological evidence is currently available to regard it as proven
beyond reasonable doubt. This study, therefore, uses traditional chronologies, establi
shed before the current debate which started in approximately 1996. For Palestine use
was made of McNutt 1999:14 and for Egypt of James 1983:263-266.

272
AMUN & AMUN-RA

(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:77)
Figure 67: Ram’s headed sphinxes of Amun at Karnak
(Photo: H & S Fourie)
During the Old Kingdom, Amun was an obscure god localised at Thebes. In the
Hermopolitan cosmology he was the ‘hidden god’, a member of the OGDOAD of
creation. Thebes, however, was a royal city and depending on the balance of power,
which during certain periods alternated between the north (Memphis) and the south
(Thebes), local gods of the seat of the reigning king, may increase its influence to a
national level.



273
During the First Intermediate Period, between the fall of the Old Kingdom and the
rise of the Middle Kingdom, Amun was taken up by the kings of Thebes as a war god
who procured victory for them. Henceforth he became a national god associated with
Ra as Amun-Ra. This association also served a theological purpose by giving the
powerful but remote Ra a human-like persona who could impregnate a queen so that
the baby and future pharaoh would be a ‘son of Ra’. He was part of a triad with his
consort Mut and their son Khonsu. His power rose continuously throughout the
Middle and New Kingdoms with only temporary setbacks such as the short-lived
Amarna period. Lavish centres of worship were established at Thebes, Karnak and
Medinet Habu and even so far afield as Palestine. By the end of the New Kingdom
Amun-Ra was the most powerful in the Egyptian pantheon. During the Third
Intermediate Period, Upper Egypt became a theocracy ruled by the priesthood of
Amun-Ra (Geddes & Grosset 1997:320; Harris 2001:158).
ANKH
Figure 68: Ankh symbol on a wall relief at the Horus temple, Edfu
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
A cross shaped like the Greek letter tau (T) with a loop on the top. In paintings and
other pictorial representations, it represents eternal life and the word often appeared



274
in personal names e.g. Tutankhamen. The ankh was used as an emblem and appears
as one of the most powerful cultural and religious symbols of Pharaonic Egypt.
The loop of the Ankh represented the feminine discipline or the womb, while the
elongated section represented the masculine discipline or the penis. These two sacred
units then come together and form life. It was supposed to bestow immortality on
anyone who had it in his or her possession. The ankh symbolised the union of Isis
with Osiris, her brother and husband, by whom she conceived Horus. Gods and
Pharaohs were often depicted as carrying ankh signs. It was usually worn as an
amulet to extend the life of the living, and placed on the mummy to energize the
resurrected soul. Worn as an amulet, it was a powerful talisman that provided the
wearer with protection from the evil forces of decay and degeneration.
This symbol appears widely in writing, paintings, ankh-shaped objects such as
mirrors or mirror-cases. The ankh was popular throughout Egyptian history and due
to its cruciform shape remained so into the Coptic period (Geddes & Grosset
1997:322; Ions 1997:29; Clark 2000:14-15; Pinch 1995:110).
ANATH (see ASTARTE)
A goddess of love and war imported during the Eighteenth Dynasty from the
Canaanites/Phoenicians where she was associated with Ashur and also called Astarte.
Thutmosis III erected a shrine to her at Thebes. She is depicted as a goddess of war,
holding a spear in one hand and swinging a battle-axe in the other, seated on a throne
or armed with shield and club, riding on a horse.



275
ANUBIS or ANPU
Figure 69: Statue of Anubis, Egyptian Museum, Cairo
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
Originally a god of Upper Egypt and the god of the dead, portrayed mostly as a man
with the head of a jackal or just as a jackal, but was later replaced by Osiris (whose
origins was in the Delta) and demoted and worshipped as the god of embalming. The
god’s titles included ‘he who is in bandages’ and ‘he who is in charge of the god’s
chamber’. The god’s chamber was the place where Anubis performed the rituals of
purification and embalming the body of Osiris with whom the deceased was
identified. When the embalming was completed, an hourly recital guides the deceased
from the state of the ‘dead’ to the state of the ‘living’. The deceased and the
participants in the ritual were transported into the world of the gods and, by wearing a
mask, the funeral priest became Anubis. After his demotion, Anubis was still
regarded with deep respect because the Egyptians regarded the underworld as a very
dangerous place and he acted as guide to the deceased through the underworld. He
was also a benevolent hearer of pleas and prayers thus ensuring his popularity
throughout Egyptian history (Geddes & Grosset 1997:322).



276
APIS
Figure 70: Apis
(Ions 1997:11)
In Egyptian mythology a bull-headed god, worshipped at its own sanctuary at
Memphis. He was believed to be the incarnation of the original main god of
Memphis.
The animal’s physical force was associated with his sexual potency making him a
symbol of fertility and rebirth. For this reason many civilisations (including the
Canaanites) connected bulls with agricultural activities and the festival of the New
Year that celebrated the cyclical rebirth of the cosmos. When it died, a search was
begun for its successor, while the dead Apis was embalmed and interred in a huge
granite sarcophagus in the Serapeum at Saqqara. During the Late Period, Apis
became a manifestation of Ptah and was considered an intermediary between the
divine and human worlds (Geddes & Grosset 1997:323; Ions 1997:122).
ASTARTE (see ANATH)
A Phoenician fertility goddess (also known as Anath in Phoenicia) who was imported
into Egyptian mythology in the early Eighteenth Dynasty as a moon goddess and



277
goddess of love and war. She was the most popular of the imported deities, and her
worship became widespread during the later dynasties. She is the goddess of ill repute
referred to in the Hebrew Bible as Ashtaroth and Ashtoreth. She was depicted with
the head of a lioness and stands in a chariot driving four horses over a fallen enemy
(Geddes & Grosset 1997:328). See ASTARTE under PHOENICIAN GODS.
ATEF

The atef crown was worn by Osiris. It is made up of the white crown of Upper Egypt
flanked by red ostrich feathers, representative of Busiris, Osiris's cult center in the
Delta. The feathers were also representative of ma’at as truth and order (Andrews
1994:81; Hallam 1996:168-169; Churchward 1913:285).



278
ATEN or ATON or ADON
Figure 72: Aten on altar piece from Amarna, Egyptian Museum, Cairo
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
The disk of the sun, its brilliantly visible aspect, as distinct from its mystical, creative
aspects, which are linked with Amun, the ‘hidden god.’ The Aten was there for all to
see and it was taken by Amenophis IV (Akhenaten) during the Eighteenth Dynasty as
a universal god, to the exclusion of all other gods. The first recorded monotheistic
religion, the cult of Aten was linked to solar cults in neighbouring countries. During
this time (the Amarna Period), numerous temples to Aten were built, later, probably
during the reign of Tutankhamen, to be demolished (Geddes & Grosset 1997:329).
ATUM or TUM
Figure 73: Atum
(Ions 1997:24)
The original local god of of Heliopolis, portrayed in human form and originally seen
as creator of the world; was known as ‘the Complete One’ (David 1999:103). He
absorbed a primitive myth about Khepera, the beetle god. The priests of Heliopolis



279
then joined his cult with that of Ra, the universal sun-god with the name of Atum-Ra,
during the Second Dynasty (Geddes & Grosset 1997:330).
BAAL
A creator god imported from the Canaanites/Phoenicians, where he was the consort of
Astarte, during the Eighteenth Dynasty. In Egypt he was worshipped at Tanis and
Memphis (Geddes & Grosset 1997:330). The name Baal simply means ‘Lord’ See
also discussion of BAAL under PHOENICIAN GODS.
BASTET OR BAST

cult at Bubastis she was identified with other goddesses such as the lioness Sekhmet,
Tefnut, Mehet and Hathor of Dendera. In the New Kingdom Bastet became
associated with Mut of Thebes and in general with the concept of goddess-mother.
Bastet represents the eye of the sun in its beneficent aspect as opposed to Sekhmet
and Tefnut who are the incarnations of the sun’s harmful aspect. Amulets in the form
of cats or with the iconography of the goddess were believed to ward off misfortune
and ensure fertility (Geddes & Grosset 1997:331; Ions 1997:101-102).



280
BEE
‘The ancient emblem of Lower Egypt associated with the Delta town of But’ (Geddes
& Grosset 1997:331).
BEN-BEN
A stone in the form of an obelisk which was placed in the temple of Ra at Heliopolis
and other sun temples. It represented the sun (as the creator) and its rays. Its shape led
to various symbolic architecture in ancient Egypt including the pyramids and the top
of the obelisks (Geddes & Grosset 1997:331; Rossi 2004:182).
BENNU
Figure 75: Bennu bird
(Ions 1997:123)
In Egyptian mythology, a great bird deity that was worshipped as sacred at
Herakleopolis. It was depicted as having feathers of red and gold. According to the
Book of the Dead it is the ‘Heart-Soul of Ra, the Guide of the Gods to the Tuat.’ The
Bennu was pictured as a grey, purple, blue, or white heron with a long beak and a
two-feathered crest. Occasionally the Bennu was depicted as a yellow wagtail, or as
an eagle with feathers of red and gold. Originally of solar associations, the Bennu bird
came to be connected with three important gods consisting of Atum, Ra and Osiris.



281
As an aspect of Atum, the Bennu bird was said to have created itself and flown over
the waters of Nun before the original creation. According to this tradition, the bird
came to rest on a rock from which its cry broke the primeval silence and this
determined what was and what was not to be in the unfolding creation. Like the
Phoenix it recreates itself and according to tradition it appears every morning in the
form of the rising sun (Armour 2001:44-45; Geddes & Grosset 1997:332; Ions
1997:125).
BES
Figure 76: Statue of Bes
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:171)
Bes was probably an imported Egyptian god, possibly of Nubian origin. Bes is
depicted in full frontal view, instead of the profile view of most of the other Egyptian
gods. Bes was a protector god who helped in childbirth and promoted fertility. He
was a guardian against snakes and misfortune. A grotesque-looking god who came to
prominence during the Eighteenth Dynasty. He was depicted as a dwarf with long
arms and crooked legs and a broad, flat face with thick lips and a protruding tongue



282
and wearing a characteristic feather crown. He always wore a hideous mask and was
often depicted playing a musical instrument. He was the god of love, marriage,
dancing and jollification and acted as guardian who kept snakes from the house,
protected the young and weak against dangers in general and assisted women in
labour. He attended the circumcision ceremony and defeated the forces of evil by
making music, singing and dancing. He was also regarded as a tamer of animals. His
consort was Tauert, depicted as a pregnant female hippopotamus (Geddes & Grosset
1997:332; Ions 1997:108).
BOOK OF THE DEAD
A collection of New Kingdom and later funerary texts, on papyrus, found in tombs
and often placed within the wrappings or between the legs of mummies. Based on the
coffin texts, which goes back to the Sixth Dynasty, these writings are spells intended
to ease the transition of the dead person into the after world (see EGYPTIAN
MAGIC SPELLS). There are some ninety chapters altogether and deals with the
deceased undergoing judgement, worshiping the gods and at work in the fields of the
underworld (Geddes & Grosset 1997:333; Faulkner et al:1994:13-14).
BUBASTIS
‘A religious site in the Nile Delta, nome capital and seat of the cult of the cat-goddess
Bastet’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:334).
BUSIRIS
A religious site and nome capital in the Delta, a focus of the cult of Osiris. Eventually
it was overshadowed by Abydos (Geddes & Grosset 1997:334).



283
BUTO
Figure 77: Buto, the snake goddess nursing Tutankhamun
(Bosse-Griffiths 1973:Plate XXXV)
The patron snake-goddess of Lower Egypt, to whom the cobra was sacred with her
original cult centre at the Delta town of the same name. Wadjet (Wadjyt, Wadjit, Uto,
Uatchet, Edjo, Buto) was one of the oldest Egyptian goddesses. Her worship was
already established by the Predynastic Period, but did change somewhat as time
progressed. Snake goddesses were usually seen as benign, perhaps because of the
snake’s useful function of eating mice and other vermin. She is often portrayed as a
uraeus. She began as the local goddess of Per-Wadjet (Buto) but soon became a
patron goddess of Lower Egypt. By the end of the Predynastic Period she was
considered to be the personification of Lower Egypt rather than a distinct goddess and
almost always appeared with her sister Nekhabet (who represented Upper Egypt). The
two combined represented the country as a whole and were represented in the
pharaoh ́s ‘nebty’ name (also known as ‘the two ladies’) which indicated that the king
ruled over both parts of Egypt. The earliest recovered example of the nebty name is
from the reign of Anedjib of the First Dynasty (Bosse-Griffiths 1973:100-108;
Geddes & Grosset 1997:334).



284
CANOPIC JARS
Figure 78: Canopic jars from the 7th
(Harris 2001:174)
Century B.C.E.
Four jars sealed with a mud-paste cap in the Old Kingdom and with a cap carved like
a human head during the Middle Kingdom. During the New Kingdom they were
sealed with the carved heads of the four sons of Horus (AMSET, HAAPI,
DUAMUTEF and KEBEH-SENUF). They were used to preserve the entrails of the
mummified dead (Geddes & Grosset 1997:336). They are named after the town of
Canopus, west of Alexandria in Egypt. Canopus was named after the Mycenaean hero
(helmsman of Menelaus) who was later in Hellenistic times associated with Osiris.
He was represented by a type of vase-shape. When the first jars with intestines were
found, they resembled the symbols for Canopus and were called canopic jars
(Aufderheide 2003:257).



285
CARTOUCHE also known as SHENU
Figure 79: Cartouche from a wall relief at the Horus temple, Edfu
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
The shape represents a loop of rope in which a name is written. It protected that
name; it was the ‘good luck’ charm of the Egyptian civilization. The ancient name for
the cartouche was ‘shenu’. It was worn only by the Pharaohs, and represented the
Pharaohs' insignia.
Both the king's praenomen (throne name), and his nomen (birth name), were written
within cartouches. These two names were the most important royal titles, and the two
cartouche names always appeared with emblematic use and formal inscriptions. The
‘Magical Oval’ in which the Pharaoh's first name was written was intended to protect
him from evil spirits both while he lived and in the after world. In the New Kingdom,
royal sarcophagi were made in the shape of the cartouche. The entire burial chamber
of Thutmosis III was in this shape (Geddes & Grosset 1997:337).



286
COFFIN TEXTS
Figure 80: Coffin texts from the coffin of Gua
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007: 402)
Funerary inscriptions made on sarcophagi, usually formulae forming part of the ritual
established to ensure that the spirit of the deceased passed successfully through the
after world. They originated during the Sixth Dynasty, thus later than the Pyramid
texts and are found in the tombs, not only of royalty, but also of aristocracy (Geddes
& Grosset 1997:340).

288
DENDERA
The site in Upper Egypt, close to Edfu, of a major temple of the goddess Hathor. An
annual festival linked the two sites, bringing the image of Hathor to Edfu to re-enact
the conception of the young Horus (Geddes & Grosset 1997:351; West 1995:393).
DESHRED
Figure 82: Deshred.
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:278)
The Red Crown. This was the crown that represented Lower Egypt (northern) (Oakes
& Gahlin 2007: 278).
DJED
Figure 83: Djed Pillars
(Andrews 1994:83)
This amulet represents the tree trunk in which Isis concealed the dead body of her
husband Osiris; the tree trunk came to represent the spine of Osiris. The four cross
bars refer to the four internal organs kept in canopic jars during mummification, the



289
intestines, liver, stomach and lungs. The Four Sons of Horus, who, from the New
Kingdom onwards, were associated with the four canopic jars that contained the
organs of the dead, were often shown with depictions of Djed pillars adorning the
exterior of the chest that held the jars.
This symbol became an important symbol of stability, symbolizing the backbone and
body of Osiris. The Djed amulet was used to cure and protect the wearer against
injury of the spine. The Djed funerary amulet was laid upon the neck of the deceased,
to whom it gave the power to reconstitute the body and to become a perfect Ka and
reborn with a strong spine in the underworld (Geddes & Grosset 1997:351; Andrews
1994:83).
DUAT
A name for the underworld (Geddes & Grosset 1997:353).
EDFU
Figure 84: Temple of Horus at Edfu
(Photo: H & S Fourie)
An ancient site in Upper Egypt, south of Thebes, on the western bank of the Nile.



290
In dynastic times it was famed as a centre of the cult of Horus, its temple the home
of the triad of Horus, Hathor and their child Horus-Harakhte, the rising sun
(Geddes & Grosset 1997:355).
EYE OF HORUS also known as UDJAT
Figure 85: Eye of Horus
(Ions 1997:26)
Originally the Eye of Atum, which god used it to rule the world. Later with the
incorporation of various deities into the Heliopolitan cosmology, it became the eye of
Ra and still later as the Eye of Amun-Ra. This ‘eye’ also became part of the Horus
mythology, the eye being lost during the epic struggle with Seth (Ions 1997:24-26). It
is a powerful symbol used to protect from evil; the ancient name for the Eye of Horus
was ‘udjat’. The right eye was the sun and the left the moon. Horus lost his left eye
in his war with Seth, who tore the eye into pieces. The left eye, being the moon was
discovered by Thoth lying in pieces, but he was able to reassemble them into the full



291
moon. This healing of the eye became a symbol of renewal of health. Horus gave the
reassembled eye to his murdered father Osiris, thereby bringing him back to life.
Egyptians believed that the Eye of Horus was capable of healing sickness and capable
of bringing the dead to life, as it did with Osiris. The Egyptians used the eye as a
funerary amulet for protection against evil and rebirth in the underworld, and deco
rated mummies, coffins and tombs with it. The Book of the Dead instructs that fune
rary eye amulets be made out of lapis lazuli or gold. This was also the eye painted on
the brow of Egyptian ships and much used as a protective amulet. It was regarded as
being always vigilant to detect evil influences. The Eye consisted of 6 pieces, each
piece of the udjat represented a fraction of the descending geometric series 1/2, 1/4,
1/8; put together they make 63/64 or approximately 1 (one).
The Egyptian fraction system was based on this symbol. The modern 'Rx' symbol
which is used by pharmacies and in medicine has its origins in the Eye of Horus
(Geddes & Grosset 1997:362).
FAIYUM
A fertile area to the west of the Nile Valley, south of the Delta, which was empty
marshland during the Old Kingdom but was drained and developed during the Middle
Kingdom (Geddes & Grosset 1997:362).

A symbol of royalty, majesty, authority and dominion carried by the pharaohs
(Wilkinson 2001:188-1900).
GEB or SEB
Figure 87: The earth god Geb
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:330)



293
The earth-god in the Heliopolitan cosmology, from whose union with the sky-goddess
Nut, came the four children, Osiris, Isis, Seth and Nepthys. It is Geb who presided at
the court of the gods that assigned the kingship of Egypt to Horus rather than Seth.
Geb and Nut (the sky) were depicted respectively as a man and a woman (Silverman
1991:21; Cf. Geddes & Grosset 1997:371).
HAAPI (1)
One of the four sons of Horus, who was depicted with a dog’s head on one of the four
canopic jars. The small intestines were placed in the jar (Geddes & Grosset
1997:373). The other three sons were AMSET, DUAMUTEF and KEBU-SENUF.
HAAPI (2)
Figure 88: The god of the Nile, Haapi
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:278)



294
In Egyptian mythology, the god of the river Nile. He was believed to live above the
first cataract and to be hermaphrodite. He was especially important to the ancient
Egyptians because he brought the flood every year. The flood deposited rich silt on
the banks of the Nile, allowing the Egyptians to grow crops (Geddes & Grosset
1997:373). He was also capricious and if farmers did not care properly for their land,
he would let them suffer serious consequences (White 1970:3).
HARAKHTE
‘A title of Horus, identifying him with Ra as god of the morning sun. The sun and
moon were known as “the two eyes of Horus”’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:374).
HAROERIS (HARURIS, HARORIS)
Haroeris, or Horus the Elder, is represented in different forms: human form or as a
human (male or female) with a falcon's head and various country crowns and the
solar disk or as squatting beast-hawk or a falcon and a lion with a lion's head.
Haroeris is one of the oldest forms of the god Horus and is already mentioned in the
Pyramid Texts. In Egyptian mythology various legends regarding Haroeris, exist. He
was introduced as the son of Nut and Re at the same time when the Osiris-worship
was introduced. Nut, the wife of Geb and Mother of the (the five original) gods was
the sky goddess. In Letopolis, Haroeris was the son of Heket.
According to another myth the name Haroeris (or Harwer) was derived from a
combination of the Horus with an indigenous deity Wer, ‘the Great One,’ a god of
light whose eyes were the sun and the moon. ‘Though increasing emphasis was
placed upon the right eye, the sun, Haroeris was worshipped as Mekhenti-irty, "He on
whose brows are the Two Eyes" or, on moonless nights as Mekhenti-en-irty, "He on



295
whose brow there are no eyes," in which aspect he was the patron of the blind.
Mekhenti-irty or Hor-merti was represented holding in his hands the udjat or uraeus
eyes of Horus’ (Ions 1997: 69).
Haroeris is sometimes regarded as the son or consort of Hathor; he was also the
brother of Osiris and Seth. Various myths or legends surround the fight, or battle,
involving Horus and Seth in which Horus lost one eye. One version is that Horus
seemed to have recovered with two eyes, one he gave to Osiris as a token of life and
the other for himself. Horus then ascended the throne approved by the assembly of
gods. This myth allowed Horus of Two Eyes to give way to Hor Nubti, ‘Horus
Vanquisher of Seth,’ or Horus of Ombos (the cult center of Seth) (Ions 1997:67-69).
HARPOCRATES
Figure 89: Harprocrates on lotus flower
(El-Khachab 1971:Plate XXXVI)
The Egyptian sun child is often depicted sitting on a lotus flower. This is actually the
young Horus. The young Horus (Egyptian Har) was Hellenized by the Greeks as the
Hellenistic god known to Greeks as Harpocrates (in Egyptian Har-pa-khered or



296
Heru-pa-khered meaning ‘Har, the Child’). He was received by Isis from Osiris in
Duat, the netherworld
HATHOR
. He was thus conceived in the darkness of the underworld and
born in the light of the sun. Harpocrates, the child Horus, personifies the first strength
of the sun after the winter; life in this world of the living, after the world of the dead,
thus the ‘sun child’, and also the image of early vegetation, thus fresh growth. Some
Egyptian statues represent the child Horus, pictured as a naked boy with his finger on
his mouth (to depict youth), a realization of the hieroglyph for ‘child’ (El-Khachab
1971:132-145; Ions 1997:72).
Figure 90: Wall painting of Hathor
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:169)
In Egypt a major, if not the main, goddess, the Lady of Heaven, Earth and the
Underworld, worshipped throughout Egypt and beyond its borders as far as Syria. She
is portrayed as a cow or a woman with the horned head of a cow (Silverman
1991:150), or just as a woman with the horns or ears of a cow. She was perceived as a
helpful and gentle deity, with women especially under her protection during



297
pregnancy and childbirth. Most other goddesses in the Egyptian pantheon laid claim
to some of her attributes, but she was supreme as her relationship with Horus
indicates. She was his wet-nurse and later his wife. Her cult was centred at Dendera
in Upper Egypt, although there were temples to her throughout the country. The
Seven Hathors were the seven Egyptian Fates who presided at childbirth (Geddes &
Grosset 1997:374; Bleeker 1973:20-30).
HATHOR HEADDRESS
This headdress is not to be confused with the normal depiction of Hathor wearing
cow horns with a sun disk (Pinch 1982:141).

HEDJET

298
The White Crown. This was the crown of Upper Egypt (southern) (Oakes & Gahlin
2007:278).
HELIOPOLIS
Currently a suburb of Cairo, but once a great centre of Egyptian religion, seat of the
cult of the sun-god Ra and the centre of the most widely accepted cosmology. The
doctrine of Heliopolis spelled out how creation originally occurred, and the Ben-Ben
stone fetish in the temple was a symbol of that creation. In the Hebrew Bible
Heliopolis is known as On and Joseph married the daughter of an Egyptian priest
from this place (Geddes & Grosset 1997:375).
HORUS
Figure 93: Statue of Horus at Edfu
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)



299
The hawk-god, perceived as the special protector of kings. Horus was normally
incorporated into the king’s name, and the hawk motif was widely used as a royal
seal. Horus was the son and avenger of Osiris and was also known as the ‘son of Ra’
(a title also used by kings).
The oldest hieroglyphics to portray the concept of ‘god’ use a falcon, indicating that
the same word stood for both. Many pre-dynastic localities had falcon-gods and the
history of Horus is a palimpsest in which these many local origins come together and
continue to develop into the complicated entity of the classical Horus. At Letopolis in
the Delta, there was an ancient cult of a Horus known as Hor-khent-irti, ‘Horus of the
two eyes’ (sun and moon).
The priests of Heliopolis took this as the supreme Horus and named four others as
subordinate to him, ‘the four young ones who sit in the shadow of the lofty one’ (the
sons of Horus – Amset, Haapi, Duamutef and Kebeh-Senef). This was Horus the
Elder, who was later to be assimilated in another Horus, Horus the Child, who was
born to Isis and Osiris and who avenged the death of Osiris and became king of
Egypt, ancestor of all the pharaohs.
He was thus a deity of great significance, linked to both the light-giving sky and the
life-giving earth. His divine struggles found all sorts of practical significance, as with
the Eye of Horus, but his principal identification was with kings (Geddes & Grosset
1997:379; Ions 1997:66-67; Oakes & Gahlin 2007:310-318).



300
ISIS
Figure 94: Golden statuette of Isis
(Harris 2001:197)
She was the prime goddess of the Egyptian pantheon, sister and wife of Osiris,
mother of Horus and a potent divinity in her own right. She is normally depicted in
human form. Her origin was as the protective goddess of Perhebit, north of Busiris in
the Delta. Isis was famed for her magic skills, which enabled her to resurrect the re
assembled body of Osiris and make it copulate with her in order to produce Horus.
Isis was often depicted as a midwife, and the moments of birth and death are both
closely associated with her. Motherhood became part of the Isis cult in the late period
and gradually led to her being linked with the Mother Goddess of eastern religion.
Her cult was still maintained at Philae long after the advent of Christianity. During
the New Kingdom and later she was often depicted with Hathor horns and a solar
disk.
Isis had numerous qualities such as her powers over life, death, immortality,
marriage, fertility and healing; she was often called ‘the many-named’. One of her



301
roles was that of protector of the harvest and she was also called ‘Lady of Bread’,
‘Lady of Beer’ and ‘Lady of Abundance.’ As the mother breastfeeding her son Horus,
she was also the protectress of children especially from disease (Ions 1997:63). After
saving both Osiris and Horus she became the ‘ideal’ woman in Egyptian eyes, both as
wife and mother, thus replacing Hathor in this role (Harris 2001:165; Cf. Geddes &
Grosset 1997:382).
KA
Figure 95: Ka hieroglyph kЗ
(McDermott 2002:170)
A term used for the life force or spirit of an individual which continued to reside
inside the tomb, passing through a ‘false door’ into the chapel to receive offerings.
One of the five elements constituting the human being, its hieroglyph is two raised
arms (Geddes & Grosset 1997:384; Cf. Faulkner et al 2008:152).
KADESH or QUADESH or QUEDESH
A Hittite goddess who was imported into Egypt during the Eighteenth Dynasty as
another form of Astarte. She was depicted as a moon goddess, standing naked on the
back of a lioness, holding lotus flowers and what appears to be a mirror in one hand
and two snakes in the other. She formed a triad with Min and Reshep (Geddes &
Grosset 1997:384). In Syro-Palestine she was known as Quedeshet (Cf. Cornelius
2004:94-101).



302
KHEPERA or KHEPRI
Figure 96: The beetle god Khepera on a boat on the waters of Nun
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:286)
The beetle god identified with the scarab. At Heliopolis he was the sun-god who was
absorbed by Atum. He formed a sun triad with Ra and Atum, with Khepera appearing
as the sun at dawn, Ra at high noon and Atum in the evening (Geddes & Grosset
1997:386). He takes the form of an iridescent beetle, a beetle-headed hawk, or a
beetle-headed man seated on a throne (Pinch 2002:152).
KHEPRESH
Figure 97: Ramses II and Ptah wearing the blue crown
(Harris 2001:99)
The blue crown was a ceremonial crown often worn in battle by the Pharaoh
especially from the Eighteenth Dynasty onwards (Silverman 2003:309).



303
.KHONSU
Figure 98: Statuette of Khonsu
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:2880)
Khonsu was a war god, the son of Amun and Mut, worshipped at Thebes, but his
main role was associated with the moon. His name means ‘runner’, who soars the sky
(Wallis Budge 1972a:172) and this may relate to the nightly travel of the moon across
the sky. The name could also mean ‘traveller’ (Pinch 2004:155). Along with Thoth he
marked the passage of time. Khonsu was instrumental in the creation of new life in all
living creatures. At Thebes he formed part of a family triad with Mut as his mother
and Amun his father. At Kom Ombo he was worshipped as son of Sebek and Hathor.
Typically he is depicted as a mummy with the symbol of childhood, a side lock of
hair, as well as the menat necklace with crook and flail. He has close links to other
divine children such as Horus and Shu. He is sometimes shown wearing a falcon's
head like Horus, with whom he is associated as a protector and healer, adorned with
the sun disk and crescent moon (Geddes & Grosset 1997:387; Pinch 2004:155-156).



304
KNOT OF ISIS also known as TYET or TET
Figure 99: Hieroglyph of Knot of Isis (Tyet)
(Ruiz 2001:142)
The symbol represented the flow of menstrual blood from the womb of the goddess
Isis, and its magical properties. Isis was identified as the universal mother, and this
symbol was a representation of her female organs. The knot resembled an ancient
symbol for menstrual cramps, which involved insertion of a knotted cloth. Almost
every woman carried this amulet attached to the neck, in order to be granted with
Isis's fertility. Amulets of the sign were fashioned from red stones and red glass. In
funerary and ritual objects, this symbol is often found in conjunction with the Djed
which represented the spine of Osiris. While the Djed represented the masculine
forces, the knot of Isis represented the feminine fertility (Lesko 1999:178-17; Robins
1993:80-81; Ruiz 2001:142).
KNUM or KHNUM
A ram-headed god (Silverman 1991:15) whose cult was centred in the city of Ele
phantine. A potter, he was believed to have shaped the world and men upon his wheel
in another version of the creation myth. At Memphis, where Ptah was worshipped in
the First and Second Dynasties as the creator of the world, he was assisted by eight
earth gnomes called Khnum (Geddes & Grosset 1997:387; Pinch 2004:158).



305
KOM OMBO
Figure 100: Double temple at Kom Ombo

Site on the Nile with temple dedicated to the gods Horus and Sobek (Oakes & Gahlin
2007:295).
KOPTOS or COPTOS
A settlement on the river Nile at the entrance of the Wadi Hammamet. It was parti
cularly a cult centre of the fertility god Min (Geddes & Grosset 1997:388; Shaw &
Jameson 2002:341).
LOTUS FLOWER
Figure 101: Lotus flower and bud at Egyptian Museum Cairo
(Photo: H & S Fourie)



306
Two native species of lotus grew in Egypt, the white and the blue lotus, the sacred
blue lotus was the flower most commonly used and the one depicted in the
hieroglyphs. The lotus closes at night and sinks underwater. In the morning it re
emerges and blooms again. Thus the flower became a natural symbol of the sun god
Ra. The Egyptians saw that the blue water lotus opened up each morning, seeing the
intense golden center set against the blue petals, an imitation of the golden sun
appearing in the blue sky. In the Hall of Ma’at, the Four Sons of Horus were shown
standing on a lotus in front of Osiris, signalling that the deceased organs are ready for
resurrection and rebirth from the lotus flower. The blue lotus was also the emblem of
the god Nefertem, ‘The Lord of Perfume’ (Armour 2001:1-2; Pinch 2004:158).
MAADIT BARQUE
‘In Egyptian mythology, the boat occupied by Ra in the morning on his journey
through the underworld’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:393).
MA’AT
Figure 102: Ma’at
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:277)



307
Ma’at was the concept underlying the society of ancient Egypt and was the
cornerstone of their religious belief. The word is variously translated as ‘truth’,
‘order’, ‘justice’ or ‘balance’. The idea was established that the Egyptian world was
governed by universal laws of order and justice (ma’at) that had been laid down by
the gods at the moment of creation and that everything outside of ma’at was chaos,
disorder and anarchy (isfit). Ma’at represents the First Order, the perfect organisation
of the cosmos and the creatures at the moment of the creation of the universe. This
was an order that was not to be altered or its cycle to be interrupted in any way. Ma’at
stood for everything that made the cosmos function in a state of perfection and
immutability: Justice, Truth and Harmony. Only the pharaoh, applying the principles
of ma’at, could weaken and destroy the outside forces that constantly threatened
Egypt and ensure the stability of the kingdom and the world. The pharaoh was the
guarantor of ma’at on earth, the only individual with enough power to maintain
perfect order for all eternity. This was done by building temples and sacrificing to the
gods and therefore placating them. In fact it was said that the Egyptian deities lived of
ma’at. This would safeguard Egypt against its enemies (consisting of most of the
foreigners) and to control nature and in particular wild animals.
It was perceived to be the ideal life in accordance with ma’at. Certain crimes, such as
treason, anarchy, rebellion, envy, deceit, greed, laziness, injustice and ingratitude
were regarded as crimes against ma’at.
Ma’at was personified in the goddess Ma’at, the goddess of truth, order and justice in
the universe. She presided over the judgement of the dead, which controlled entry to
the underworld. She is depicted with a feather, usually described as an ostrich feather,



308
on her head, used to weigh the heart of the deceased and usually with an ankh in one
hand and a sceptre in the other. The basic principle was to establish whether the
deceased had lived a just life according to the principles of ma’at.
‘No one knows for sure the origin of her association with the feather...but somehow
the ethereal qualities of the feather seem well suited to a goddess of her
characteristics. It has been suggested that the feather became her symbol because it is
equally balanced along each side of the quill, suggesting the fine judgement required
of a goddess who sat to judge truth in the trial of the dead’ (Armour 2001:133; Pinch
2004:159-160; Cf. Geddes & Grosset 1997:393; Oakes & Gahlin 2007:462-463).
In Egypt in harmony with other developing societies, people were closely bound to
nature and natural forces. What they perceived was an orderly and regular system.
The sun rises and sets, the moon had phases and with the first annual rise of Sirius in
the East, the flooding of the Nile began. Thus the abstract concept of Ma’at (truth and
order) was created, but Ma’at was also seen as a goddess (of truth and world order).
She is identified by an ostrich feather which served as a counter balance to weigh
justice (the feather representing justice) against injustice. She and her feather played a
major role in the final judgement of the deceased in the after world. The feather was
weighed against the heart of the deceased. If the scales were balanced, the deceased
could proceed, if the heart outweighed the feather, it meant that the burden of sin of
the deceased was too heavy, he could not proceed and he was devoured by the
monster Ammut. Thus Ma’at was an important entity in Egyptian religion where a
tremendous lot of emphasis was placed on death and its aftermath where life



309
continued and the order of the universe could still be disturbed by the elevation of an
unworthy person into the realm of the gods.
MEDINET HABU
The site of numerous temples on the west bank of the Nile, facing Thebes. It includes
the mortuary temple of Tutankhamun (Eighteenth Dynasty) and the great fumerary
temple of Rameses III (Geddes & Grosset 1997:398).
MEMPHIS
Ancient Memphis was placed strategically at the apex of the Nile Delta and was the
capital of Egypt during the period of the Third to the Sixth Dynasties (2980-2475),
the most brilliant period of the Old Kingdom. At its establishment it took over the god
Ptah as its major god. During the Twelfth Dynasty it became capital again and again
with the Hyksos of the Fifteenth Dynasty. In the Hebrew Bible it is referred to as
Noph (Geddes & Grosset 1997:398; Robins 2008:210; Oakes & Gahlin 2007:84
102).
The god of war worshipped at Thebes. He is depicted as a falcon-headed man with a
solar disk and two plumes. During the 11th
MIN
Dynasty he was elevated to become the
protector of the royal line that originated at Armant. He was later overshadowed and
absorbed by Amun- Ra (Geddes & Grosset 1997:399; Pinch 2002:165).
In Egyptian mythology he was a fertility god whose cult centre was at Koptos, where
he was also worshipped as a god of roads and desert travellers. Popular especially in
Middle Egypt, and with many chapels attached to temples of other gods, he was
portrayed as a rotund figure with a large penis.



310
Figure 103: Min in a fragment of a relief from Koptos
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:319)
In the New Kingdom he also became the god of healing and formed a triad with gods
imported from Phoenicia, Reshep and Kadesh. Statues and charms featuring Min
were very common. He is depicted standing with a flail in his right hand behind his
head (Geddes & Grosset 1997:402).
MUT
Figure 104: Statue of Mut and Amun
(Ions 1997:100)



311
She was the wife of Amun (later Amun-Ra), the goddess mother, a vulture headed
goddess local to Thebes and there with a temple. Although revered at Thebes she was
little known and worshipped elsewhere in Egypt. She formed a triad with Amun and
their son Khonsu (Geddes & Grosset 1997:404). At Karnak she was said to be the
goddess who holds the other gods together (Lesko 1999:132).
NAME
There is a close relationship between the power of names and the magic element in
Egyptian religion. The name was regarded as a part of the living person, and it was
assigned at birth to the individual in order for him to properly come into existence.
Knowing a person’s name might result having some sort of power over that person.
The removal of an individual's name from a statue or monument was considered as
the destruction of the person's existence and memory. A Name often followed those
of the rulers of the time, which often incorporated the name of a god (Geddes &
Grosset 1997:405).
NEB HIEROGLYPH
Figure 105: Neb (nb, nbt, nr) basket
(Gardiner 1950:525)
A particular basket, looking rather like a flowerpot in shape, was used for measuring
grain. It was called the hekat and held about 4.7 liters. The hekat basket was also used
for carrying away sand and rubble from building sites. The hieroglyph for building



312
works and for work in general, is a man with a hekat basket balanced on his head.
Archaeologists in Egypt today still use baskets to carry off debris from a dig because
they are lighter-weight than metal buckets. Ushabti figures found in tombs often carry
such baskets on their backs.
The round, bowl shaped basket, like the hollowed-out shell of half an orange, was
such a commonplace item in ancient Egyptian homes and workplaces that it too
became a hieroglyph, representing words which sounded the same as the name the
Egyptians gave to this type of basket.
They called it neb, which was the same as the word used for ‘all’ or ‘every’, and
‘lord’ or ‘master’. The word ‘noble’ is derived from neb. One will see it in the royal
title Lord of the Two Lands, neb tawy, which is sometimes used with the king’s
official name. It is also the last sign in the cartouche of Tutankhamen’s throne name,
Neb-kheperu-ra. In coloured hieroglyphs, the neb basket is often painted in a
chequered pattern in two tones of green to show that it was woven from plant
materials.
With a feminine ending, the neb hieroglyph can also mean ‘lady’ or ‘mistress’. One
of the most ancient of the king’s titles was the Two Ladies, or nebty name, so-called
because it was chosen to put the king under the protection of the two patron
goddesses of Upper and Lower Egypt. The nebty name is marked by the emblems of
the vulture goddess Nekhbet of the south, and the cobra goddess Wadjet of the north,
each standing on a neb basket (Cf. Hornung 2001:11; Grimal 1994:54; Fage, Clark &
Oliver 1982:534).



313
NEITH
Figure 106: Statuette of Neith
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:277)
A goddess whose origins go back into the Pre-Dynastic Period. She was a huntress
and a major goddess of the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty, whose cult was centred at Sais in
the western Delta, where she was regarded as the oldest and the creator goddess.
According to Johnson (1994:132) she was known as the ‘Oldest One’. Her symbol is
the shield with the crossed arrows (Geddes & Grosset 1997:408; Hart 2002:100;
Edwards 1970:493; Ellis 1999:115).
NEKHEBAT
‘In Egyptian mythology, she was a goddess of Upper Egypt who was worshipped at
El Kab. She is depicted with a vulture’s head or wearing a crown in the shape of a
vulture, (Geddes & Grosset 1997:408; Pinch 2004:170).

NEPHTHYS
Figure 108: Isis and Nephthys

315
She was the wife and sister of Seth (thus also the sister of Osiris and Isis). Despite her
marriage to Seth, she was devoted to Isis and Osiris and she assisted Isis in finding
the scattered body parts of Osiris (Geddes & Grosset 1997:409; Pinch 2004:171).
NO
The name in the Bible for Thebes (Geddes & Grosset 1997:412).
NOPH
The name given in the Bible to Memphis (Geddes & Grosset 1997:413).
NU or NUN
‘A name given to the pre-Creation, a primordial shapeless ocean out of which the
sun-god Ra emerged’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:413; Pinch 2004:172)
NUNET
She was the consort of Nu (Geddes & Grosset 1997:413).
NUT
Figure 109: Nut being raised by her father Shu

She was the original sky goddess, consort of the earth god Geb in the original
Ogdoad. She was later fused with Hathor (Geddes & Grosset 1997:413; Hart
1990:29-30).



316
OGDOAD
In Egyptian mythology, a group of eight deities. The most famous is the Hermo
politan, comprising four pairs of male frogs and female snakes, personifying the
primeval forces of creation (Geddes & Grosset 1997:414; Najovits 2004:106).
ON
In the Hebrew Bible, the name used for Heliopolis (Geddes & Grosset 1997:415).
OPET FESTIVAL
The annual journey by boat of Amun-Ra, from Karnak down-river to Luxor and back
again (Geddes & Grosset 1997:415; Firestone et al 2008:250).
OSIRIS
Figure 110: Statue of Osiris
(Ions 1997:52)
Although Osiris was one of the greatest gods, his myth is preserved completely only
in the writings of Plutarch, De Iside et Osiride. The most popularly worshiped of all



317
the Egyptian gods, closely identified with the fertile ‘black land’ of the Nile Valley.
He was the first king of Egypt and taught his people many arts and sciences,
including agriculture and civilization. He also gave them laws and taught them to
respect the gods. His wife (also his sister) was Isis. Thoth was his vizier and brought
the art of writing. Anubis and Wepwawet accompanied Osiris on his journeys of
conquest all over the world. Osiris was treacherously murdered by his brother Seth
who grabbed the throne of Egypt. He later cut the body of Osiris into many pieces
which he scattered all over Egypt. Isis, assisted by her sister Nepthys (also the wife of
Seth) collected the pieces and with the help of Anubis reassembled the body of Osiris
except for the penis which was not found as it was eaten by a fish, an Oxyrrinchus.
Isis grated an artificial penis and let herself be impregnated by this reassembled body
and their son Horus was born. She hid him from Seth amidst the marshes of the Nile
Delta, aided by Hathor as wet-nurse.
When he grew up he claimed his inheritance and engaged Seth in battle and defeated
him. During the battle Seth plucked out one of Horus’s eyes and Horus tore off Seth’s
genitals. Seth appealed to the gods, claiming Horus to be illegitimate, but Horus’s
claim was found to be valid by a divine council presided over by Geb, and he became
the king of Egypt, thus the king of the living and made his father Osiris lord of the
kingdom of the dead.
Thus it was that Osiris and Horus were ancestors of all the pharaohs, endowing them
with godlike qualities. In Egyptian theology the myth of Osiris ensures the conti
nuation of existence after death and implicitly supported the concept of monarchy: the
king became Horus in the coronation ceremony and Osiris during the rites of



318
embalming and burial, indispensable to the continual renewal of the state and the
universe. Osiris remained the most omnipresent Egyptian deity until Egyptian
religion itself was extinguished by Christianity (Geddes & Grosset 1997:416; (Cf
Ions 1997:52-54).
PANTHEON
In mythology, all the gods worshipped by a people (Geddes & Grosset 1997:419).
PAPYRUS

Material used to write on in Ancient Egypt made from a reed with the same name.
Grew mostly in the marshes of the Delta and became the symbol of Lower (northern)
Egypt. It remained the major writing material in Egypt until Greco-Roman times
(Parkinson et al 1995:7-12).
PHILAE
This was a site on the Nile just north of Elephantine (or the modern Aswan) and was
the centre of the cult of Isis. Hathor was worshipped at a shrine at this temple, just as



319
Isis was worshipped at Hathor’s cult centre at Dendera (Geddes & Grosset 1997:424;
Oakes & Gahlin 2007:174-175).

PHOENICIAN GODS AND GODDESSES
As a result of the limited knowledge regarding the gods and goddesses of Phoenicia,
the following list is compiled with the Canaanite pantheon as basis. Only the more
prominent gods and goddesses are discussed.
ADON: (Greek = Adonis). He was the god of youth, beauty and regeneration. A love
affair with the goddess Astarte, led to his death. Another god envious of this love
affair, in the form of a wild boar, attacks and kills Adonis. However, while Astarte
lamented, she took an oath to resurrect him every spring; subsequently where his
blood fell, red poppies grow every year. He is similar to the Greek god Adonis (Cf.
Hooge 2003:116; Frazer 2003: 6-7).
ANATH: She was the goddess of love and war, associated with the planet Venus,
similar to Greek Aphrodite. She is also known for defending Baal and killing the



320
enemies of her brother Baal. She is related to the Egyptian goddess Hathor. After the
defeat of Mot and Yam, a feast was arranged for Baal. Anath locked everyone inside
and proceeded in an effort to kill everyone (as they had all been discourteous toward
Baal). Baal interfered and convinced her they should rather have peace. She also has
confronted Mot and was responsible for Baal's liberation from the underworld. She is
the twin sister of Marah, daughter of Asherah. She is also known as Rahmay, ‘The
Merciful’ and as Astarte. Sometimes it seems that she was also regarded as the sister
of Astarte. Astarte is the Canaanite name of Ishtar; just as Ishtar is the Babylonian
Name of Inanna. In all cases the name means, simply, ‘goddess’ or ‘lady of the
womb’ (Cf Harden 1963:83; Markoe 2000:115-116).
ASHERAH: Asherah is the mother of the gods, the goddess of the sea and the wife of
El (see El). When the gods decided to entreat Yam to ease his reign of tyranny, it was
Asherah who went to him and even offered herself. The gods agreed to let her do this,
except for Baal who was enraged at the idea (see Baal). Asherah is said to have given
birth to seventy gods. Asherah seems to have played a more important role in the
pantheon during the earlier period of the Canaanites. (Hadley 2000:38-43; Patai
1990:36-38; Johnston 2004:418).
ASHTAR: He was possibly a male version of Ishtar (Astarte in Canaan and was
associated with the planet Venus. After Baal was killed by Mot, Asherah arranged
that Ashtar, her son, be crowned as his successor. Ashtar was too small for the throne
and abdicated. He had various names and titles including Malik, Abimilki and
Milkilu (Cf. Hastings 1910a:115-118).



321
ASTARTE (see ANATH): One of Anath’s names which means ‘goddess’ or literally
‘lady of the womb’. Astarte appears to be the Canaanite version of the name Ishtar.
She had powers which could influence the sea and the moon (Marston 2001: 42; Cf.
Harden 1963:87; Markoe 2000:115-116).
ATIK: He was the calf of El. He was an enemy of Baal and was slain by Anath (Day
1985:80).
BAAL: Baal is really a title, meaning ‘lord’. Baal's residence is upon Mt. Zaphon.
When he stays in the underworld during summer he is known as Rapiu (Shade). He
was the ruler god of the Canaanites. He and Yam-Nahar were originally contenders
for the kingship of the gods. El had to make a decision and he ruled in favour of Yam.
Yam then started a reign of tyranny over the gods, and they felt powerless to defeat
him. So, they sent Asherah to entreat him to loosen his grip. Asherah even offered
herself to Yam. Baal became furious, and decided to defeat Yam. Yam heard of
Baal's plan and sent messengers to El requesting that Baal be delivered to him. El,
who was scared of Yam agreed to the request. Baal then scolded the gods for their
cowardice and decided to confront Yam. He had two clubs made, Yagrush (chaser)
and Aymur (driver). He attacked and hit Yam on the chest with Yagrush with no
effect. He again struck Yam, but this time he used Aymur and hit him on the head and
Yam fell. After his victory, Baal had a palace built for him. Thereafter Baal had a
fight with Mot. Baal is also a storm god like Marduk, and a fertility god like
Tammuz. Baal is the Canaanite god-force (the goddess force seems to be split
between Anath and Asherah). Baal's proper name is Hadad, relating to his storm-god



322
aspect (Markoe 2000:117; Cf. Marston 2001:42; Cornelius 1994:293-294; Ribichini
2001:123).
BAALAT GUBLA (GUBAL): She was the patron goddess of Byblos (Gubla), a
fertility goddess associated with Hathor and Isis. She is regularly referred to in the
Amarna letters. (Cf. Markoe 2000:115, 117-118; Van der Toorn, Becking, & van der
Horst, 1999:139).
BAAL-SAPHON: Baal in one of his many forms. One of the gods of Tyre and also at
Carthage, also known as the Lord of the North. Originally he was a Syrian storm god
and was renamed after having been imported by the Tyrians (Bickerman 1976:276).
In Egypt a temple for this god was erected at Memphis during the New Kingdom (Cf.
Markoe 2000:116).
BAAL-SHAMEN: This was also Baal in one of his other forms, a god worshipped at
Tyre, known as the Lord of the Heaven (Leeming 2004:91; Cf. Markoe 2000:115,
116).
DAGON: A vegetation god (especially wheat and the plough), the father of Baal
(Marston 2001:43: Harden 1963:86).
EL: The father of the gods, the creator of the whole creation, He was regarded as the
‘Kind One’, also as Kodesh. Asherah is his wife. During his youth, El fount Asherah,
the goddess of the sea and friend Rohmaya, while he was on a visit to the sea. He
befriended them, cook a sea-bird and enquired if they would become his wives or
daughters. Asherah and Rohmaya decided to be his wives. From El’s unions with



323
them, two boys (twins), Shachar and Shalim (Dawn and Dusk) were born. They all
built a house in the desert where they lived for eight years. This episode may be the
closest we have to a creation myth involving El. El wears bull horns upon his helmet
(he is sometimes called ‘Bull El’) and he is portryed as a grey haired and bearded
patriarch. He resides at ‘the Source of Two Rivers’ upon Mt. Lel (Harden 1963:82,
85).
ESHMUN: The god of health and healing. He is portrayed as a god who died and
came back to life. The name seems to derive etymologically from a Semitic word for
‘oil’. A chief god of Sidon (Marston 2001:43; Markoe 115-116, 118; Ribichini
2001:129).
HAURON or HORON: A god that is related to Ninurta of Mesopotamia and Horus of
Egypt. He is regarded as an evil god (demon) but also as beneficial in that his name
can be invoked against demons (Van der Toorn, Becking & van der Horst, 1999:425
426; Johnston 2004:418; Albright 1980:138-139).
HELEL or LUCIFER: Known as the ‘Bringer of Light’ or the ‘Morning Star’ and
therefore also associated with Venus. He was the son of Shachar. Helel once
attempted to usurp his father's throne, but failed (another myth concerning Venus'
place as the last star in the sky each morning, as if he is trying to defy the sun). This is
the very myth which apparently resulted in the biblical story of the war in heaven (Is
14:12 ; Albani 2004:62-70).
HIRIBI: The god of summer (Hooke 2004:93).



324
ISHAT: The shrew of the gods. Enemy of Baal slain by Anath (Rahmouni 2008:35).
KOSHAROTH, THE: They were goddesses of childbirth and conception. This led to
them being portrayed either in the form swallows or sparrows, which were regarded
as representing fertility. They were the daughters of Yarikh the moon god and were
also known as the ‘Daughters of the Crescent Moon’ (Green 2003:241; Van der
Toorn, Becking & van der Horst, 1999:491-492).
KOSHAR or KOTHARU: His name means to be ‘skilful and clever’. He was an
artisan who tended to the gods’ needs. Also known as Chousor and Heyan (Ea), he
was identified with Ptah of Egypt.. He first built a palace for Yam and later one for
Baal. He made the two clubs that Baal used in his fight with Yam (Van der Toorn,
Becking & van der Horst; 1999:490-491).
LOTAN: Lotan is a seven headed serpent defeated by Baal with the help of Mot.
Anath also claims a role in the defeat of the Serpent. Also known as Tannin or
Leviathan (Cross 1973:118-120; Van der Toorn, Becking & van der Horst 1999:
511-515).
MELQART: The patron god of Tyre (introduced by King Hiram). He may have been
a dying and rising vegetation god. He was ritually immolated in an annual festival. He
was also a god of the sea and was depicted sitting on a hippopotamus. It seems that he
became a supreme god throughout Phoenician civilisation (Krejčí & Krejčová
1990:49; Cf. Marston 2001:42; Harden 1963:85-86; Markoe 2000:117; Aubet
2001:152-155).



325
MOT or MAVET: He was god of death and sterility. His name means ‘death’. He
was son of El. After Baal defeated Yam, he then sent a message to Mot demanding
that he stay in the underworld where he belonged. Mot was furious and threatened
Baal, who was scared and endeavoured to appease Mot by means of flattery. He was
unsuccessful and had no other choice but to confront Mot. In the ensuing fight he was
defeated by Mot who held him captive in the underworld until Anath attacked and
defeated Mot and released Baal. Mot was only wounded and he and Baal again had a
fight seven years later. Neither was really victorious, but Mot retreated and
acknowledged that Baal was the king of the gods (Cf. Harden 1963:83; Baumgarten
1981:111-112).
NIKKAL: She was the wife of Yarikh and the daughter of Hiribi. She was the
goddess of the fruits of the earth (Turner & Coulter 2001:345; Hooke 2004:93).
PIDRAY: A goddess of nature. Her name means ‘mist’. Also known as the ‘Girl of
Light.’ A daughter or consort of Baal (Turner & Coulter 2001:384).
RAHMAYA: A goddess impregnated, along with Asherah, by El. The goddesses then
gave birth to the twin gods Shahar and Shalem, it is not known who gave birth to
whom (Cf. Hooke 2004:93).
RADMANU: Or Pradmanu. A minor servant of Baal (Marsman 2003:271).
REPHAIM: They were gods of the underworld, who rode on horses or on asses.
Sometimes they made use of chariots. (Cf. Collins 2004:358).



326
RESHEP: He was a war god, with gazelle horns on his helmet (Cf. Cornelius
1994:15). He destroyed men in mass by means of war and plague. He is the porter of
the sun goddess Shepesh (this seems to resemble Khamael of the Hebrews). He is
also called Mekal (Annihilator), and could be related to the Hebrew Michael (Mikal)
who as an archangel can also be regarded as a war god. He is related to Nergal of
Mesopotamia. The oldest known references go back to the third millennium B.C.E.
to the Ebla Texts (Cornelius 1994:236). He was imported into Egypt, probably by
Amenophis II during the New Kingdom (Traunecker 2001:106-107; Cf Marston
2001:43; Harden 1963:86; Markoe 2000:116; Albright 1980:139).
SHACHAR: He was god of dawn and the brother of Shalem. His father was El and
his mother was either Rohmaya or Asherah. In the Bible he is mentioned as being the
son of the dawn or the morning star (Is 14:12) (Botterweck & Ringgren 1977:153)
SHALEM: He was the god of the dusk and the brother of Shachar (Van der Toorn,
Becking & van der Horst 1999:755-756; Lang 2008:27-28).
.
SHAPASH: A sun goddess who was regarded as the torch of the gods (Noll 2001:
245).
SHATAQAT: ‘Drives away’. Goddess of healing sent by El to drive away Keret's (a
Canaanite mythic hero) disease. She was revered as able to drive away illness and to
conquer death (Hooke 295:89; Johnston 224:459).
YAM or YAM-NAHAR: Yam, as the god of the seas and the rivers was the
archenemy of Baal, who defeated him (see Baal and Asherah). El crowned him as



327
king and he became a dictator, ruling the gods. In the end Baal confronted him and
after a severe struggle managed to conquer him (Marston 2001:43; Hooke 2004:81).
YARIKH: He was moon god and known as ‘Lord of the crescent moon’. He was the
father of the Kosharoth. He was the patron god of Qart-Abilim and consort of Nikkal
(Hooke 2004:93; Barton 2004a:59.)
PSHENT
Figure 114: Pshent
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:278)
The dual nature of ancient Egypt was also symbolized by the Double Crown, pshent,
worn by the pharaoh. As sovereign of the Two Lands, the king wore the White Crown
(hedjet) of Upper Egypt and the Red Crown (deshred) of Lower Egypt. The Double
Crown represents a unified Egypt. Although Egypt was not always a unified nation it
was stronger that way. Therefore unification was desirable. Narmer (Menes), the
founder of the First Dynasty around 3100 B.C.E., was the first man recorded wearing
this crown (James 1983:41; Massey 2007:305).



328
PTAH
Figure115: Bronze figure of Ptah
(Ions 1997:29)
Ptah was the local god of Memphis who came to prominence during the First and
Second Dynasties when Memphis became the royal capital. The Memphis priesthood,
who established a cult of Ptah, claimed that he was the oldest god who had created
Re-Atum by pure thought. All other gods and created things were similarly the
products of the mind of Ptah. Horus was claimed to be his heart and Thoth his tongue.
The concept of Ptah was too complex, abstruse and abstract for him to become a true
deity of the people and his worship lacked a mythology that would have appealed to
the people. In the course of the Old Kingdom, the worship of Ptah, with revivals
whenever Memphis was dominant, gradually declined and Re-Atum became esta
blished as the principal god. He was also worshiped as the guardian deity of
craftsmen. He was normally depicted with a right smooth cap as headdress, also used
by the foreman of the skilled craftsmen shown in representations inside mastabas.
Later he acquired certain funerary attributes and was associated with Osiris. His body



329
is wrapped in a mummy-shaped cloth that only leaves his hands uncovered. The
peculiarity of Ptah’s beard was its shape which was not curved, as were those of other
divinities, but straight like that worn by the pharaohs. It is possible that the pharaoh
took this attribute from the god as Ptah was the main god of Memphis, Egypt’s most
ancient capital. In Memphis Ptah was associated in a triad with the goddess-lion
Sekhmet, his consort, and their son Nefertem.
During the Late Period his name was entwined with that of the sacred bull Apis. The
sacred bull was supposed to live in the middle of Ptah’s temple complex in Memphis
(Geddes & Grosset 1997:428; Ions 1997:103-104).
RA or RE
Figure 116: Ra in his sun barque
(Ions 1997:41)
The oldest and one of the greatest of the gods, with a complex history of
development. He is also known as Atum or Re-Atum. A sky-god identified with the
sun, he arose out of Nun, the primeval water, and through his own creation created
the elements to sustain life on earth, with Shu the air-god, Nut the sky-god, Geb the
earth-god, Tefnut, the goddess of moisture, Nephthys, Osiris and Isis. The centre of
Ra’s cult was at Heliopolis in the Nile Delta. He was perceived in different ways,
according to whether the sun was blazing at the zenith or setting in the western sky:

this latter was its Atum persona. During the 18th

A Phoenician creator god imported into Egypt during the Eighteenth Dynasty. In
Egypt he was depicted as a bearded man in profile, carrying a club and spear or a
spear and ankh, with the head and neck of a gazelle, one of the holy animals
associated with Astarte, projecting from his helmet. In Egypt he formed a triad with
Min and Kadesh (Geddes & Grosset 1997:435; Hart 2002:137). See also discussion
of RESHEP under PHOENICIAN GODS AND GODESSES.
SA
Figure 117: Egyptian symbol Sa (s3)
(Gardiner 1950:523)
It is a symbol for protection. It could also mean aid, backing, virtue and faith. It also
means ‘touch’ and is apparently a forerunner for ‘ka’. Sa was also the god of amulets.
The sa was worn as an amulet for protection (Massey 2008a: 98).
SAQQARA
A major funerary site of the Old Kingdom situated at the southern end of the vast
funerary district that extends from Giza in the north southwards. It is in the west bank



331
of the Nile opposite Memphis (Geddes & Grosset 1997:438; Firestone et al 2008:
200).
SCARAB
Figure 118: Heart scarab
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:395)
The scarab was a favourite amulet associated with renewal and regeneration. It
personified Khepri, the morning manifestation (associated with resurrection) of Ra,
the sun god. The dung beetle was chosen for this honour because after it laid its egg
in animal dung and rolled it into a ball and pushed it into the sun so that the sun's heat
hatched the egg. Thus, the connection of the beetle with the life giving powers of Ra
was established
During life, Egyptians carried the scarab amulet to protect their hearts and give them
long lives. In the beginning the heart was left in the body, because it was thought to
be responsible for thought, memory and intelligence and the mummy needed it to be
judged in the next world. A stone scarab amulet was placed on the body over the
position of the heart, with a spell inscribed over it to prevent the heart from
symbolically incriminating or betraying the owner (Wiedemann 2001:287). In later
times, the heart was taken out, embalmed and replaced by a stone scarab amulet as a
symbol of renewed life’, since the body has need of another heart to act as the source



332
of life and movement in its new life (Ruiz 2001:94; Wallis Budge 1978a:138). The
stone heart scarab gave this new life to the body on which it lies. Heart scarab
amulets were weighed against the feather of truth in the Hall of Ma’at, and were often
inscribed with a spell from the Book of the Dead which entreated the heart to, ‘do not
stand as a witness against me.’ Actual beetles were found stored in jars buried with
the deceased and in graves (Geddes & Grosset 1997:438: Cf. Turner & Coulter
2001:5).
SCEPTRE or STAFF
‘The staff and sceptre were symbols of the authority and status of an official’ (Robins
2008:52).
SED FESTIVAL or ḤEB SED
A sort of jubilee supposed to be held after the first thirty years of the pharaoh’s rule
and thereafter every five years. Some rulers, however, held it regularly and at shorter
intervals (Frankfort 1978:97; Fontenrose 1971:12).
SEDGE
Figure 119: The sedge hieroglyph (sw)
(Gardiner 1950:482)
It is the lily emblem of Upper Egypt. The king of the two lands was known as ‘ He of
the sedge and the bee (emblem of Lower Egypt)’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:442; Ruiz
2001:139).



333
SEKHMET or SAKHMET
Figure 120: Statue of Sekhmet holding papyrus sceptre
(Harris 2001:157)
‘In Egyptian mythology, the lion-headed goddess of war and sickness originally
associated with Memphis and a figure to be placated’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:443).
Sekhmet was believed to protect the pharaoh in battle, stalking the land, and
destroying the pharaoh's enemies with arrows of fire. An early Egyptian sun deity, her
body was said to take on the bright glare of the midday sun, gaining her the title Lady
of Flame. It was said that death and destruction were balm for her warrior's heart and
that the hot desert winds were believed to be her breath and was also known as the
‘one who dances on blood.’ Sekhmet was believed to protect the pharaoh in battle,
thus a protector of life (Lesko 1999:139-141); Pinch 2004:187-188)

of Upper and Lower Egypt
(Riggs & Stadler 2003:70) (Ions 1997:64)
This is a symbol of dual kingship. It represents a windpipe flanked by two lungs,
which together form the hieroglyph sema. It represents the unification of Upper and
Lower Egypt. Other symbols are often added to further illustrate unification. In these
renderings we see the Sema bound with two plants, the papyrus and the lotus. The
papyrus represents Lower Egypt and the lotus represents Upper Egypt. In other
representations we find two gods binding the Sema together using papyrus and lotus
(Robins 2008:58; Myśliwiec 2000:7; Riggs & Stadler 2003:70-78)



335
SERAPEUM
Figure 123: Serapeum
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:103)
The Serapeum consists of underground tombs at Saqqara where the sacred Apis bulls
were buried, from the Eighteenth Dynasty onwards. These bulls were the personi
fication of the ka of Ptah. The name comes from the ground-level temple of Serapis, a
composite deity who combined aspects of Osiris and Apis during the Hellenistic
period. In the dynastic period, the sacred bulls were worshipped during their lifetime
and on their deaths buried in huge granite sarcophagi (Geddes & Grosset 1997:443;
Myśliwiec 2000
SERAPIS

‘The Greek name for the Apis bull’ (Geddes & Grosset 1997:443; Vassilika 1998:50).



336
SETH
Figure 124: Horus and Seth
(Ions 1907:64)
Seth was one of the principal gods, killer of his brother Osiris. He was identified with
the arid desert areas away from the fertile Nile Valley. He was seen as the opposite
of Osiris (evil and good), just as the valley was the opposite of the desert, the north to
the south and the dark to the light. The desert had its own values; and Seth was not
without virtues. He was regarded as a powerful god and was respected. Thunder,
storms, whirlwind and hail were all instruments of Seth. The waning of the moon and
the occasional lunar and solar eclipses showed that, although defeated by Horus, he
had not lost his powers.
He was a war god. Unlike Horus, his great rival, Seth remained the same unchanging
figure in the Egyptian pantheon throughout Egyptian history. He was chiefly
identified with Upper Egypt, the land of desert. As the patron deity of nomes in both
Upper and Lower Egypt, he was represented in various animal forms, including the
falcon, but also the crocodile, dog, Oxyrrinchus and especially the hippopotamus.
The oldest centre of Seth’s cult is Nubt, on the west bank of the Nile in Upper Egypt
opposite Koptos (Geddes & Grosset 1997:444).



337
After Seth had lost the battle and hearing against Horus, he became known as the
‘Evil One’ and was banished (David 1999:103) but still retained his status as a god
and was worshipped by certain sections.
SHABTI or USHABTI
Figure 125: Shabti of Tutankhamun in Egyptian Museum, Cairo
(Photo: F N Vermeulen).
In funerary practise a small figure, inscribed with magic formulae in the form of a
mummy, made of stone, wood or other materials. They were placed in tombs, and
their function was to obey the deceased and work for or on behalf of the deceased in
the afterlife, performing all necessary tasks that were required, thus releasing him
from doing the tasks himself (Geddes & Grosset 1997:445; Meskell 2004:120).
SHEN
Figure 126: Shen amulet
(Andrews 1994:77)



338
Originally a loop of papyrus rope that has no beginning and no end, it symbolized
eternity. The sun disk is often depicted in the center of it. It shows the circle of the
sun in twenty four hours, encircling the universe. The shen also seems to be a symbol
of protection. It is often seen being clutched by deities in bird form as the Ba or, the
falcon (Horus and the vulture (probably Mut). These birds are hovering over the
heads of Pharaohs with their wings outstretched in a gesture of protection. The word
shen comes from the word ‘shenu’ which means ‘encircle’ and in its elongated form
became the cartouche which surrounded the king's name (Andrews 1994:76-77; Clark
2000:14-15; Ruiz 2001:139-140).
SOBEK
Figure 127: Wall relief of Sobek
(Harris 2001:167)
The male deity Sobek was depicted as a crocodile or as a man with the head of a
crocodile. In the Coffin Texts he was sometimes identified with a serpent god, Maka.
As told in the Book of the Dead, Horus the Elder enlisted the help of Sobek to kill his
uncle Seth. Sobek helped Horus on another occasion when he rescued Horus’ four
sons from the waters of Nun. Sobek was the god of crocodiles. Ancient Egyptians,
who lived in cities that depended on water, worshipped him to placate the crocodiles.



339
For instance, the people of Crocodilopolis (Arsinoe) would husband crocodiles in
pools and adorn them with jewels. The importance of crocodiles to ancient Egyptian
culture is demonstrated by the numerous mummified crocodiles that have been found
in tombs (Ions 1997:91-92; Oakes & Gahlin 2007:235, 295; Armour 2001:188-189).
SYCAMORE
The sycamore was a sacred tree in Ancient Egypt. Thoth at one time must have been
considered as a tree spirit as in the Nineteenth Dynasty he is shown recording the
name of a pharaoh on a sycamore (Geddes & Grosset 1997:451; Ruiz 2001:143).
TANIS
‘A settlement and nome capital in the eastern Delta region, hometown of the
Ramessides of the Nineteenth and Twentieth Dynasties’ (Geddes & Grosset
1997:452).
TAUERT or TAWERET or APET or OPET
Figure 128: Amulet of Tauert
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:448)



340
A goddess portrayed as a pregnant female hippopotamus (David 1999:105). She was
the goddess of fertility and childbirth credited with bringing babies to childless
women and thus often portrayed on charms and amulets. She assisted all females
(divine, royal or ordinary) in childbirth. She was also known as the consort of Bes
(David 1999:105; Cf. Geddes & Grosset 1997:452).
TEFNUT
Figure 129: The goddess Tefnut
(Ions 1997:47)
‘In Egyptian mythology, the goddess of moisture, created by Ra, the sister of Shu.
She was also a sun deity and was depicted as a lioness or a lion-headed woman’
(Geddes & Grosset 1997:453; Ions 1997:45-46).
TESHUB
An Asian storm god of the tempest imported by the Hyksos into Egypt (Geddes &
Grosset 1997:454).

THOTH
Figure 130: A limestone tablet with Figure 131: Thoth with human body and
Thoth as an ibis Ibis head
(Ions 1997:39) (Ions
1997:30)
He was an early rival to Ra, the sun god, as creator of Egypt (and hence the world).
Before the creation of the universe and the sun, when it was still dark, Thoth
summoned the gods who produced the egg from which the sun hatched. These were
animal gods, four frogs and four snakes, known collectively as the Ogdoad. Thoth,
depicted as a man with the head of an ibis or just as an ibis or sometimes as a baboon
(Silverman 1991:20), was the scribe of the gods, the inventor of writing, language and
magic, thus also the god of medicine.
Figure 132: Egyptian ibis

(Photograph: F N Vermeulen)
Thoth’s wife was Seshat, who wrote the details of every human life on the leaves of
the Tree of Heaven. There was considerable animosity between the priesthood of
Thoth and that of Ra. The centre of Thoth’s cult was the cities of Hermopolis, one in
the Delta and one in Middle Egypt. He also featured in the mythologies of Ptah (at
Memphis), Ra (at Heliopolis) and Osiris. He accompanies Ra in his chariot across the
skies and in the Osirian Judgement of the Death he recorded the verdict of the
Negative Confession (Cf. Geddes & Grosset 1997:457).

URAEUS
Figure 133: Uraeus. Inner sarcophagus of Tutankhamun, Egyptian Museum, Cairo
(Photo: F N Vermeulen)
An ornamental serpent worn on the brow, emblematic of the snake-goddess Wadjet.
The Greek word from which ‘uraeus’ is derived may have arisen in the Egyptian
expression ‘she who rears up,’ as the ureaus represents the rearing cobra (Naja haje)
with its characteristic dilated hood (Werness 2006:419). From the earliest times the
cobra was associated with the sun, Lower Egypt and various deities. It was held to
represent the eye of Ra. It was also associated with the underworld and a gilded
wooden cobra with the name netcher-ankh (living god) was found in the tomb of
Tutankhamun. Uraei were also associated with specific deities such as Neith, Ma’at



343
and Ra. The pharaoh Hatshepsut’s throne name was Ma’at ka-re which was spelled
out inter alia with an uraeus with a solar disk. The uraeus was also called weret
hekau: ‘The Great Enchantress,’ who could be represented as a human-headed
goddess with the body of a cobra. This deity is mentioned ten times in the inscriptions
on the shrine of Tutankhamun and also appears as the pendant of a necklace found in
his treasures, which shows her nursing a small figure of the king. The cobra was
sometimes replaced by the vulture or used together with the vulture (the double
uraeus) (Wilkinson 2001:191-192; Robins 1993:23-24; Cf. Geddes & Grosset
1997:471). According to Vassilika (1989:84) the uraeus represents the ‘divinely
begotten power’ of the pharaoh. ‘The uraeus is a symbol of protection’, (Cornelius
1994:101).

WAS SCEPTRE
Figure 134: Sekhmet with the was-sceptre
(Shorter 1932: Plate X)



344
This is a symbol denoting authority and power. It is a long staff with an idealized
animal-head at the one side and two prongs at the other side. The was sceptre is
carried by deities as a sign of their power. It is also seen being carried by kings and
later by people of lesser stature in mortuary scenes. It may be regarded as carrying
divine power (Wilkinson 2001:189-190; Clark 2000:14-15).
WING(S)
‘Even at the outset of Egyptian history, wings were disassociated from the bird-figure
as a kind of hieroglyph for “protection”. They can represent the feminine-motherly
aspect of the sky in its protective function... In the same way wings serve to represent
the protection afforded by...goddesses...’ (Keel 1985:192).
WINGED SCARAB
Figure 135: Winged scarab from the tomb of Tutankhamun, Egyptian Museum, Cairo
(Oakes & Gahlin 2007:328)
It is a tri-dimensional reproduction of the dung beetle, scarabaeus sacer, with its
natural habitat in the low desert. Scarabs were one of the most important symbols in
ancient Egyptian beliefs. There was a strong resonance between the word kheperer
meaning scarab and kheper meaning ‘to become’ or ‘enter existence’. The god-scarab
Khepri represented the sun that rose each morning (re-entering existence), thus
ensuring the cycle of the eternal regeneration of the cosmos and all its creatures. The



345
scarab in consequence came to mean rebirth after death. In particular the winged
scarab was placed over the heart of the deceased and known as the ‘heart scarab’. The
truth about each individual was contained in one’s heart and it was the heart that was
weighed on the scales during the judgement of the gods after death. The ‘heart scarab
was endowed with the power of regeneration needed to overcome death and this was
invoked by Chapter 30 of the Book of the Dead that contained the formula engraved
on the lower surface of the scarab: ‘My heart, my mother ...Let not that which is false
be uttered against me before the great god...’ (Wallis Budge 1953:151).
It was linked to Ra, the sun god, and became the symbol of resurrection. The female
rolls a ball of dung and then lays her eggs in it, which she then rolls in front of her. To
the Egyptians this was the same process as that of Ra rolling the sun’s disk across the
sky. Furthermore the scarab’s young emerged from this ball, in a manner similar to
the god’s own creation of life. Thus the scarab was regarded as very sacred
(Stavrakopoulou 2004:105; Fox 2000:221; Taylor 1993:46-47.
WINGED SUN DISK
Figure 136: Winged sun disk
(El-Khachab 1971: Plate XXXVII)



346
Figure137: Winged sun disk with uraei
(El-Khachab 1971: Plate XXXVIII).
The basic components of the winged sun disk from the Old Kingdom onwards are
relatively standard: a sun disk encircled by a pair of uraei, flanked by two
outstretched falcon wings. This is a form that the god Horus Behudety (Horus of
Edfu) takes in his battles with Seth. The god Thoth used his magic to turn Horus into
a sun-disk with splendid outstretched wings. The winged sun disk is over the
sanctuaries of all the gods and goddesses of Egypt. He is known as ‘the Great
Protector’ (Wiedemann 2001:74-76). The goddesses Nekhbet and Uazet, in the form
of uraeus snakes, joined him at his side. The winged sun disk represents the close
association between Horus, the Sun god Ra and the pharaoh. This symbol apparently
originated with the Assyrians but is most identified with the Egyptians. It is a
ubiquitous symbol found in numerous forms on temple or tomb walls, papyri, seals
etcetera in Egypt.
‘Emblematic of the element of air, this consists of a circle or solar-type disk enclosed
by a pair of wings. In ritual magic it is suspended over the alter (sic) in an easterly
direction and used when invoking the protection and co-operation of the sylphs’
(Hope 1986:157).



347
‘... the Sun of Righteousness will rise with healing in His wings...’ (Ml 4:2).
‘the Winged-Disk, with the Uraei of Egypt, the original of which we find in the text
summarized by Naville in the "Myths of Horus," ...; "Horus commanded Thoth that
the Winged-Sun-Disk, with Uraei, should be brought into every sanctuary wherein he
dwelt, and into every sanctuary of all the gods of the lands of the South and the
North, and in Amentet, in order that they might drive away evil from therein...." This
is what is meant by the Winged-Disks, with the Uraei, which are seen over the
entrances of the courts of the temples of all the gods and goddesses of Egypt’
(Churchward 1913:344; Taylor 1993:46-47).

ANNEXURE C
EGYPTIAN CREATION MYTHS
THE HELIOPOLITAN MYTH
67
In Egyptian the place was called Iwnw and the Greeks called it Heliopolis (city of the
sun). Here the most lasting and influential of the cosmogonies, centering on Atum
and later Ra-Atum arose. Atum was the earlier main god of the region and later the
sun god Ra assimilated some of his characteristics. The main source for this
cosmogony is the pyramid texts and it had a great influence on many aspects of
Egyptian religion.
In this myth two groups of gods are roll players. Firstly we find the Great Ennead
(group of nine gods) which consisted of Ra-Arum, Shu, Tefnut, Geb, Nut, Osiris, Isis,
Seth and Nepthys. Secondly there is the Lesser Ennead of which Horus, the son of
Osiris and Isis, was the leader.
Ra-Atum was the first to emerge, a god who created himself and produced children
Shu (air) and Tefnut (moisture). Shu and Tefnut became the parents of Geb (the
earth) and Nut (the sky). These gods were all cosmic gods and were essential
elements for the creation of the universe. The children of Geb and Nut, Osiris, Isis,
Seth and Nepthys, were not cosmic gods.
According to the myth Ra-Atum, in the form of the mythical Bennu bird, alighted on
the benben (a pillar or stone, probably in the form of a pyramid or an obelisk, with a
pyramid on top, which was associated with the sun god), when he arrived at the
67These myths were compiled from the following sources: David 1999:103-104, 116-117; Oakes & Gahlin 2007:300-307.



349
primeval mound. In Ra’s temple at Heliopolis the benben was the god’s symbol and it
had probably been there from the beginning of the cult. The ancient Egyptians, or at
least those subscribing to the Heliopolitan cult, believed it marked the exact place of
creation where Re-Atum had first alighted.
THE MEMPHITE MYTH
At Memphis, the god Ptah was worshipped as the supreme god of creation. According
to the myth from this center, Ptah was in fact Nun (the state of nonexistence prior to
creation) and that he had begotten a daughter, Naunet, by whom he fathered Ra
Atum. He thus preceded Ra-Atum in the creation chronology and genealogy. The
theology from Memphis (preserved much later in a text on the Shabaka Stone)
claimed that Ptah was the supreme creator of the universe who had brought
everything into existence through his thoughts (expressed by the heart) and his will
(expressed by his tongue). He created the world, the other gods, their centers, shrines
and images as well as the cities, food, drink and all the requirements for life. He also
established abstract concepts and principles such as divine utterance and ethics.
Ptah’s mythology had, however, no widespread appeal and though he received some
royal support, he was never adopted as a supreme royal patron like Horus or Amun.
THE HERMOPOLITAN MYTH
At Hermopolis, the cult center of the god of wisdom, Thoth, a third great cosmogony,
arose. Although there were several versions of the Hermopolitan myth, they all
attempted to establish the supremacy of the center and its primal role in creation.
According to one version, the Hermopolitan Ogdoad (group of eight gods) played the
major role. The four frog-headed male gods Nun (primeval waters), Huh (eternity),



350
Kuk (darkness) and Amun (air) together with their snake-headed female consorts,
Naunet, Hauhet, Kauket and Amaunet respectively, created the world immediately
after the First Occasion (the moment of creation). When these gods died they
continued their existence in the underworld from where they made the Nile flow and
the sun rise so that life could continue on earth.
In another version a cosmic egg replaced the primeval ocean as the source of life. A
bird (either a goose called the ‘great Cackler’ or the ibis representing Thoth himself)
laid this egg on the island (mound) and when it opened, it contained air (essential for
life) or, in a variant, the god Ra was inside a bird when he proceeded to create the
world. Yet another version relates how the ogdoad create a lotus flower that arose
from the ‘Sea of Knives’ (perhaps the sacred lake at Hermopolis). When the flower
opened its petals, it revealed either the child Ra who then created the world or a
scarab that changed into a boy whose tears became mankind.
