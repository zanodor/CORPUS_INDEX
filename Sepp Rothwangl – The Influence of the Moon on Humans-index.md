Abstract: In recent time it is often rejected that the lunar cycle has an influence on humans in general or on the female cycle of menstruation more specifically. This statement may be true, because since the invention of birth control pills, medicine imitates the female cycle with pills (hormones) in a different pattern from the moon, and taking the pill imposes no or an artificial day rhythm. From etymology, myths and anthropology we have hints that in former times the moon may have had a major influence. E. g. the word menstruation derives from the Latin word mensis, which means the lunar month of the Roman lunar calendar. Is it conceivable that this coincidence in the number of days is a pure coincidence? The myth of Callisto tells about Ursa major, that pregnant women must not follow the moon goddess Artemis/Diana. The sex-strike theory claims that in prehistoric times matrilineal coalitions in particular would have acquired substantial evolutionary benefits by phase-locking their economic and ritual routines to the rhythms of the moon. These theories could be verified like an echo by lists of female cycles found in the heritage of the Austrian gynecologist Hermann Knaus, who is considered to have discovered the fertile days. These lists were compiled by women in the years 1930-1950 and a statistical test shows a significant correlation between menstruation and the phase of the moon from the time before the introduction of the birth control pill. Is this a confirmation that the power of women and their orientation to the moon was at the beginning of human evolution.

Introduction
It is very controversial what influence the moon has on humans. Scientifically proven is the gravity of the moon upon the earth. It amounts on the earth approx. 1/300,000 of the gravitational acceleration. Thus the effect of the gravity of the moon upon the earth is approximately as large as if one is 10 floors higher or lower.
To what extent the moonlight has an influence on humans still has to be clarified. The moon appears to us in the cycle of the lunar month, in Latin mensis, of about 29 1/2 days in different phases, where it waxes in one half and wanes in one half and is invisible as a black moon for about 2 days in between. The moon rises every day about 3/4 hour later than the day before. The new moon is therefore always visible in the evening and the last visibility of the waning crescent is early in the morning before sunrise.
A well-known example of the influence of moonlight on an organism is the behavior of the palolo worm on Samoa. At a certain phase of the moon each year, all the worms simultaneously shed their hind parts with their seeds and eggs, so that whole carpets accumulate on the surface of the sea. There are so many of them that they cannot be eaten by predators, so that the survival of the worms is ensured and brings an evolutionary advantage.
The results of a study in Argentina and US show that
sleep starts later and is shorter on the nights before the

full moon when moonlight is available during the hours following dusk (Casiraghi et al., 2021). Yet, a recent Argentine study found that the latest time to fall asleep and the shortest sleep duration, with two hours less sleep, is 3 to 5 days before the night of the full moon (Casiraghi, 2021). An research from China shows effects upon menstruation (Law 1986).
What influence does the moon have on the female monthly bleeding (menstruation, from Latin mensis = lunation)? The myth of Callisto gives a decisive hint: Callisto (the most beautiful), an Arcadian king's daughter, was in the company of Artemis and had sworn virginity (not to get pregnant) to her. Zeus desired Callisto so much that he raped her and impregnated her. Callisto hid her secret and although pregnant, remained in the entourage of Artemis. This came to light while she was bathing. She was damned and flung into the northern sky and was asterized there as the Great Bear. There, in the northern sky, she could never again bathe in the sea, which describes the astronomical fact that this constellation, namely the Great Bear, does not set under the horizon because it is high in the sky all year round due to its circumpolarity. The myth thus morally and figuratively describes the punishment for Callisto. Never again bathing she begins to stink and no divine approaches her. Zeus (planet Jupiter) and the other planets move further south along the zodiac. The myth thus also expresses a sacrilegious violation of Callisto, who has broken a rule that cannot be broken, because virgins or menstruators who have a menstrual period are not pregnant! In this context ‘virgin’ namely does mean not to be pregnant! Pregnant women have no menstruation, and therefore don't follow the moon any more, but are in the retinue of another goddess: Venus, who has a period of visibility of about 260 days, which is the duration of pregnancy.
How can we explain that Artemis/Diana is also the goddess of hunting? For clarification of this question we must put ourselves some hundred thousand years into the past. The moon gave the first orientation for time measurement.
The question is which came first, the moon or the menstruation? There is no easy answer. I would say: they were always at the same time.... or and by coincidence of the same length.
The earliest cultures of Europe had lunar calendars, and these cultures were matrilineal! We must go back to the beginning of human evolution, one hundred thousand years ago. There the biggest revolution or evolution of the planet Earth took place.
The emergence of homo sapiens with his, compared to the other primates, huge brain and child rearing of many years.
In the course of human evolution, the acquisition of animal protein was of decisive importance for this development. Only in this way could the human brain develop to such an extent. Evolving protohuman females among early humans acquired this valuable resource (the animal protein) from males through a kind of business contract that formed the basis for human kinship organization and social exchange. This was accomplished through a systematic "sex-strike" cycle that ran on a schedule based on the lunar cycle. At the time of menstrual bleeding, the hunt began with the new moon. It was followed 14 days later by the full moon with celebrations where the prey was cooked and consumed. Females developed hidden ovulation and a cultural system of sexual courtship based on menstruation that guided this cycle. Females could now say "yes" but they

could also say "no" depending on the success of the hunt. The moon and its phases thus also controlled the hunt, and Artemis became the patroness of the hunt.
It turns out that our ancestors could not have achieved the profound sexual changes necessary to overcome the limits of primate sexuality and sociality if women had not also been involved at crucial moments in asserting their own forms of sexual solidarity. (Knight,1991)
Human sexuality differs from all animals in that neither women nor men realize when fertility is at its highest. I.e. they "must" have sex during the whole cycle. Or rather, sexuality has another function for humans besides fertility, namely the communication or the social function between the partners.
The work of Lionel Sims also explains how the lunar cycle is in synchrony with menstruation and thus controlled the hunt. (Sims, 2007)
Met Recent evolutionary theory within anthropology has assessed the evolutionary costs and benefits of different types of mid- to late Pleistocene human coalitions (Dunbar 1999). As climatic changes undermined the viability of female self-sufficiency, Darwinian selection pressures would have favored stabilizing strategies to undermine the competitive behavior of dominant individuals (Boehm 2001).
Matrilineal coalitions in particular were found to have gained significant evolutionary advantages by linking their economic and ritual routines to the rhythms of the moon. (Knight, 1991; Knight, 1995; Power,1999; Power,1997; Watts, 2005).
More specifically, this "sex strike" model predicts that the time of maximum ritual potency and sacred observance would have been at new moon. When the moon had left the night sky, this would be the time for (married) women to withdraw from temporary marriage. This would signal to (married) men to prepare for the collective hunt. These women could have called on their brothers, if necessary, to assist them in this withdrawal strategy.
Such late Pleistocene mothers with highly dependent offspring, would have significant provisioning advantages over those females pursuing more competitive strategies.
An echo of prehistory in today's time: the documented cycles collected by Knaus?
During my work in the museum MUVS I came across documents in the archives of this museum, and found in the works of Hermann Knaus a wealth of lists with about 400 menstrual cycles. (MUVS, 2021) Hermann Hubert Knaus (1892-1970) was an Austrian gynecologist and codiscoverer of fertile days in a women’s cycle (MacManus, 2016). He and the gynecologists Kyūsaku Ogino from Japan independently but simultaneously discovered this method, which was later named the

Knaus–Ogino method or the rhythm method. It may be used to achieve pregnancy by timing unprotected intercourse for days identified as fertile, or to avoid pregnancy by avoiding unprotected intercourse during fertile days.
A first look at some of these cycles shows the approximate duration of the cycles from 27 to 31 days. A first comparison of randomly selected dates with the corresponding new moon dates showed a synchrony with the lunar cycle.
The concrete data of this archive makes it possible to compare them with the lunar data of the relevant days and it turns out that much of the data of the menstruation occurred at new moon.
However, a statistical analysis of the menstrual dates with the dates of new moon, did not yield any significant result. The reason for this could be the post-war stress of the women, or the poor nutritional situation of the female periods because many of these periods are totally irregular.

Methodology
The new moon phases corresponding to the menstrual dates were determined using the following programs: https://www.wissen-info.de/kalender/mondphasen, https://www.timeanddate.com/moon/phases/ The correlation of menstruation and new moon was evaluated with the difference of +/- 5 days as statistically significant.
Conclusion
Linguistic parallelism, sex-strike theory, myth, and studies seem to provide evidence that there is a synchrony of the lunar cycle with female menstruation, which seems to be evident in some individuals.
