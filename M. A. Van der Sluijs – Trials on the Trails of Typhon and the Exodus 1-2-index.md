Trials on the Trails
of Typhon and the Exodus
Part 1
Marinus Anthony van der Sluijs
Introduction
In a recent contribution to this journal, Donald Keith Mills revisited the convoluted subject of the comet Typhon and its putative appearance during the Hebrew Exodus, a mainstay of Velikovsky’s theory [1]. While there is much to commend in Keith Mills’ article, it remains to be seen whether “Rockenbach Falls” or “King Typhon Tumbles”. This article is in two parts. In Part 1, I will remove some of the stumbling blocks, fill in a few remaining gaps on the classical perception of Typhon, trace all elements of Rockenbach’s discussion of this comet to earlier sources and clarify the involvement of the ‘giants’. Part 2, to be published in a later issue of Review, will examine a possible origin of one of Rockenbach’s sources in Arabic astrology, make a case for a genuine antecedent to the comet Typhon in ancient Egyptian literature, analyse the rabbinical legend of the star ‘Evil’ in detail and consider the meaning of a star associated with the Exodus in a catacomb painting. All translations are my own, except where indicated otherwise.
Classical Sources
To begin with the classical material, I concur with Keith Mills that the passage in Pliny [2] is the oldest extant witness to Typhon as an astronomical object; that the grammatical reference of the opening words is most likely to the feminine noun stella (‘star’); [3] and that Pliny’s wording is ambiguous in respect of the question whether the king named the object ‘Typhon’ after himself or not. Although many a capable scholar opted for a positive answer to the latter, [4] I side with Keith Mills in the impression that the syntax of the sentence suggests the opposite. If eius had straightforwardly referred to rex (‘the king’), it would presumably have been placed after that word instead of before it. Compare:
cui nomen aevi eius rex dedit Typhon (attested) ‘to which the king of its/that time gave the name Typhon’
cui nomen eius aevi rex dedit Typhon (hypothetical) ‘to which the king of the time gave its/his name Typhon’ (?)
cui aevi rex nomen eius dedit Typhon (hypothetical) ‘to which the king of the time gave his name Typhon’
Hence, I shall translate:
... and a terrible one was experienced by the peoples of Ethiopia and Egypt, to which the king of its time gave the name Typhon, fiery in appearance and twisted in the way of a coil, also grim to the sight, not really a star so much as something like a fiery knot.[5]
Yet why would Pliny have bothered to point out that the object was named by the king if that was all there was to the matter? Servius Auctus’ text is unequivocal that Typhon was called after the king and lists Campester (3rd or 4th century AD?) and Petosiris (2nd century BC?), but not Pliny, as its sources. Accordingly, a plausible scenario is that Pliny, Servius Auctus and perhaps others independently drew on Petosiris. Pending the miraculous recovery of an original manuscript of the latter, the jury remains out on the possibility that the king, too, was called Typhon, even if Pliny did not say so in the clearest of terms. I will return to this problem later in this paper.
The context in which Pliny mentioned Typhon was that of cometary movement and directionality. Judging by the immediately preceding sentence, it appears that he cited Typhon as an uncommon example of a comet appearing towards the south, which according to him lacks radiance.[6] In the preceding chapter, Pliny had presented a classification of comets into ten-odd categories. Although he did not explicitly state to which of these Typhon belonged,



4 Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:2
Fig. 1: Four subtypes of comet in the category disceus (‘disc’) or chriseus (‘golden’), according to Hewelcke: solaris (‘solar’) or rosa (‘rose’), disciformis (‘disc-shaped’), clypeiformis (‘shield-shaped’) and clypeus ardens (‘burning shield’). Hevelius, Cometographia, 1668, p. 442/443 Fig. G.
the amber-coloured disceus (‘disc’) would be a reasonable bet because of its shape and ‘rays, which sparse it ... emits from the edge’ (radiis, quos ... raros e margine emittit) (fig. 1). [7]
As for Servius Auctus, [8] the reading immodicus (‘beyond measure’) was not of Velikovsky’s making, as Keith Mills would have it, [9] but was faithfully reproduced by Velikovsky from the source which he cited. [10] As the footnote to that source shows, it was based on a textual emendation proposed by Riess. [11] I agree that this ‘improvement’ of the text is uncalled for and that the preferred lection remains modicus (‘modest’). [12]
Keith Mills observed that “no further information regarding the ‘Typhon Comet’ is forthcoming” from the work De Mensibus (On the Months) by John of Lydia (6th century AD). [13] He could have expressed more clearly, however, that the statement quoted from Arrian on the next page of his article was really lifted from that same work by John of Lydia, the ascription to Arrian being a hypothesis on Keyser’s part. [14] This statement was: “The Typhon appears fiery and blood-red, shedding also fine locks of hair.” [15] What is more, Keith Mills seems oblivious to two rather longer passages on Typhon in the list of comet types which John supplied in another treatise, entitled De Ostentis (On Celestial Signs). The first of these reads:
The Typhones, however, are produced at the Southern Pole. These are fiery spheres and as if nodes of fire. These did not appear in Roman times, but, when they had appeared before the latter, they shook Egypt, hence Aristoteles maintains that they are produced from an underlying moist substance and for this reason they rarely appeared in Egypt on account of its underlying dryness. All the others, however, are produced at the Northern Pole whether they look either towards the East or the West. [16]
Interestingly, Typhon here appears in the plural (Typhōnes), confirming that it was thought of as a generic term for a class of objects. In the second passage, John is quoting directly from Campester:
Comet Typhon This is produced from the reflection of the air, but it is sickle-shaped, glistening, smoky, and gloomy and, wherever it looks, generally there will be ills, oppressive wars, foreign and intestine [sic] acts of sedition by the people, and lack of provisions, even illustrious commanders will be slain in the wars and especially if it should appear for three or four days, but, if it appears longer, it threatens the destruction and demolition of everything and nowhere will there be an end of the ills. Very many from the Roman army will die in war. Both camps and garrisons belonging to the Romans will be captured and the common people, being in a state of discord, will reprove even the magistrates themselves. There will be also a plague and no one, when praying, will be heeded. And there will be corresponding successions of the magistrates because of the fatuity of the rulers, also especially extremely fierce-burning and deadly conflagrations, incinerating whole cities, will occur. And, whereas the horrors will be general and insufferable everywhere, they will be worse to those in the West, for a powerful war from the East will beset them, but, because those setting out from the East are of divided opinion, the largest part of the army will be utterly destroyed, instances of sedition will be instigated by the armies, and the military authorities will assign punishments to one another. [17]
It was this assertion on the complete destruction wrought by Typhon should it appear for more than a few days which Velikovsky cited from a secondary source. [18]
Keith Mills did not examine Hephaestio of Thebes (fl. AD 415), but for the sake of completion it will do no harm to do so here. Again in the context of a typology of comets and citing Petosiris, Hephaestio gave “Titan” (titàn) as a synonym for ‘Typhon’ and submitted puzzling information about its course:

Fig. 2: Francesco Giuntini (1523-1590), at the age of 60 years. Iunctinus, Specvlvm Astrologiæ, 1583, title page.
There is another comet, Titan, which is called Tuphôn, exceedingly painful and fiery, misshapen and slowmoving. Its tail extends rather far behind. Customarily it follows the sun along the boundaries of the arctic pole. Its appearance is the cause of many evils, the destruction of crops and kings in the East and West. [19]
The ‘boundaries of the arctic pole’ (tois pérasi tou arktikou pólou) are surely the virtual outer limit of the circumpolar zone, corresponding to the latitude of observation. [20] However, needless to say the sun is not seen towards the north pole in the northern hemisphere. Bearing in mind that all except the very brightest comets are only visible by night, ‘following the sun’ will have been jargon for appearing closer in time to sunset than sunrise.
Junctinus, finally, has received little attention in Velikovskian discourse. Velikovsky lumped him together with the preceding authorities in his list of “early authors” concerned with comet Typhon, adding that Wachsmuth, the editor of John of Lydia’s De Ostentis, “also printed excerpts from Hephaestion, Avienus apud Servium, and Junctinus.” [21] Yet Junctinus is nowhere to be found in Wachsmuth’s excerpts or anywhere in his book. [22] True to form, Velikovsky was quite remiss, for Junctinus was Francesco Giuntini (1523-1590; fig. 2) of Florence, a Carmelite theologian, mathematician and astrologer of the Cinquecento, belonging not in antiquity but the early modern period. Some sleuthing reveals that Velikovsky probably grouped this writer with the likes of Pliny and Servius because of his superficial reading of an entry in a standard encyclopedia which he cited in this context; although, as so often, he did not provide numbers for the pages he perused, he will have been led astray by this sentence on the comet Typhon: ‘Later it is mostly attributed to Saturn, thereby it acquired the nickname Niger (Junctinus 316 b, 9).’ [23] The original passage in Giuntini is this:
Niger, which is altogether very similar to Saturn. And when it should appear, it indicates mortality by natural death, & death by the sword and beheading. [24]
In a later tractate, Giuntini elaborated:
And the one which is called niger is of the nature of Saturn, & its colour is more dark blue-green than black, which when it should appear indicates much mortality & beheading. [25]
In these two passages, Giuntini presented ‘Niger’ as the ninth in a classification of comets he derived from Leopold of Austria’s Tractatus 5 de Annorum Revolutionibus (13th century AD) [26] and the Latin 1524 edition De Revolutionibus Nativitatum of a work by the Egyptian physician and astronomer ‘Alī ibn Riḍwān (AD c988-c1061). It will be noted that the word ‘Typhon’ is absent from Giuntini’s discussions, so that Typhon’s association with the planet Saturn remains indefinite. [27] Be that as it may, Velikovsky could have avoided his blunder if he had more attentively read this encyclopedia entry or the one cited earlier on Typhon’s potential destruction of everything, which he cited in the next footnote. [28]
Rockenbach
A contemporary of Giuntini, Abraham Rockenbach (1536-1611), sometimes unmelodiously Latinised as ‘Abrahamus Rockenbachius’, was a German lawyer and mathematician, who had graduated from the university of Wittenberg. It should be pointed out that his tractate De Cometis ... was not first published in 1598, the edition of 1602 being the first one. [29] Keith Mills was perhaps misled by the bibliographic information supplied by Google Books, which cannot always be relied upon. The book’s long title, characteristic for its time, ends with the unmistakable indication that the book covers the period from the general flood to the year 1600. The title page also states that the work was ‘presented in public in the Philosophers’ College, in the year 1600, by the Catholics now called a jubilee’. [30]
The bewildering entry in which Rockenbach intertwines Typhon with the Biblical Exodus appears on pages 116 and 117, not 115, [31] in a portion of the book offering a chronological listing of past comet observations. Typhon is the fifth comet in this catalogue, the first one being dated to the year of the flood of Noah. Rockenbach’s date for the Biblical Exodus was not 1495 BC, as that of Jan Hewelcke (Johannes Hevelius) was, but 1510 BC; the ample instances of double dating in both the anno mundi (AM) and the Christian calendar eras which he supplied in the following pages prove that his world chronology commenced in 3963 BC. Keith Mills misspelled several words in the Latin text. [32] That Rockenbach, like Hewelcke, numbered the relevant chapter in Pliny’s second book as 25 instead of 23 was not an



6 Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:2
error, [33] but correct for the time; the modern chapter numbers for this book were apparently introduced in the edition of Pliny’s work published by the French Jesuit classicist Jean Hardouin (1646-1729) in 1685. [34] Keith Mills does not seem to be aware that Sutherland had already provisionally translated Rockenbach’s Latin into English and drawn attention to the giants omitted by Velikovsky. [35] The first sentence mentioning the giants was not left out of Velikovsky’s Latin, as Keith Mills seems to suggest, but only of his English translation. [36]
Now for the translation itself, the words formam and caput are best taken as accusative nouns both indicated by repræsentans, while the occurrence in this sentence of the two conjunctions & and -que shows that the adjective convoluti must refer back to circuli, not forward to globi, and the latter must be a genitive modifying caput. The rendition of aspectu terribilis (‘terrible to behold’) would appear to have dropped out of Keith Mills’ translation. The words “Typhonq; à rege, tunc temporis in Aegypto imperium tenente, dictus est” should not be translated as “And it is said that King Typhon ruled in Egypt at that time”, but as ‘and called Typhon by the king who was wielding power in Egypt at that time’. Aegiptijs and Aethiopibus are in the dative, so that the translation – consistent with Pliny’s account – ought to be ‘to the Egyptians and Ethiopians’, not ‘of’ them. [37] Oddly, while much of the text in Pliny and Hewelcke matches Rockenbach’s text verbatim, Keith Mills has reproduced and translated the former two much more accurately than the latter, [38] almost as if he had not noticed the close textual interdependence between them. Finally, Keith Mills was rightly baffled about the appearance of the words speculum Heroicum in Rockenbach’s text. It turns out that there is no p in the first word; the actual text reads seculum Heroicum (‘the Heroic age’). In view of the fact that the reproductions of Rockenbach’s Latin and its translations into English by Velikovsky, Sutherland, Keith Mills and others all contained such significant flaws, a fresh attempt is in order: [39]
Anno mundi, bis millesimo, quadringentesimo, quinquagesimo tertio, Cometa, (ut multi probati autores, de tempore hoc statuunt, ex conjecturis multis) cuius Plinius quoque lib. 2. cap. 25. mentionem facit, igneus, formam imperfecti circuli, & in se convoluti caputq; globi repræsentans, aspectu terribilis apparuit, Typhonq; à rege, tunc temporis in Aegypto imperium tenente, dictus est, qui rex, ut homines fide digni asserunt, auxilio gigantum, reges Aegyptiorũ devicit.
In the year of the world two thousand four hundred fifty three, there appeared a Comet (as many esteemed authors state of this time, based on many arguments), of which Pliny bk. 2 ch. 25 also makes mention, fiery, exhibiting the form of an imperfect circle rolled up into itself and the head of a ball, terrible to behold, and called Typhon by the king who held sway in Egypt at that time, which king, as people worthy of belief assert, with the help of the giants, subdued the kings of the Egyptians.
Visus quoq; est, ut aliqui volũt, in Siria, Babylonia, India, in signo capricorni, sub forma rotæ, eo tempore, quando filij Israel ex Aegypto in terram promissam, duce ac viæ monstratore, per diem columna nubis, noctu vero columna ignis, ut cap. 7. 8. 9. & 10. legitur profecti sunt.
It was also seen, as some wish, in Syria, Babylonia, India, in the sign of Capricorn, in the form of a wheel, at the time when the children of Israel set out from Egypt to the promised land, with the column of cloud by day and the column of fire indeed by night as a guide and leader of the way, as is read in chs. 7, 8, 9 & 10.
Dicit autem Plinius in dicto loco, hunc Cometam Aegiptijs & Aethiopibus interitũ denunciasse, quemadmodũ & Herodotus, tunc temporis seculum Heroicum, & gigantũ cessasse dicit. Postea caritas annonæ septennalis, secuta est, anno mundi, bis millesimo, ducentesimo, tricesimo septimo, quando Iacob Patriarcha, cum filijs & nepotibus in Aegyptum profectus est, de quibus Genes. 46. Secuta quoque sunt tunc temporis & alia prodigia magna, interitum Pharaonis, & vicinorum populorum designantia.
Pliny also says in the said place that this comet announced destruction to the Egyptians & the Ethiopians, just like Herodotus said that at that time the Heroic age & that of the giants ended. After that followed the seven-year costliness of produce, in the year two thousand two hundred thirty seven, when Jacob the patriarch, with his sons & grandsons, set out to Egypt, of which Genes. 46. At that time, too, followed other great prodigies, signalling the ruin of Pharaoh, & of neighbouring peoples.
Note the visual agreement of the ‘imperfect circle’ with the sickle shape assigned to Typhon by John of Lydia. [40] Contrary to Velikovsky’s understanding, there is no indication that Rockenbach interpreted the column of cloud and fire as a physical part of the comet. Comets are seldom visible by daylight and if Typhon was confined to Capricorn, as Rockenbach states, how could it have guided the Israelites in any meaningful way? Like the stars, the comet would simply have risen and set in the course of a night. The guiding column of Exodus reads more like an object with a

Rockenbach’s Sources
Introduction
Without the benefit of Rockenbach’s vaunted ‘many authors and arguments’, it would be well-nigh impossible to make heads or tails of his discussion of Typhon. Fortunately, a modest amount of diligent research sufficed to trace all elements of that discussion to a handful of 16th-century sources. No longer enigmatic, these were all printed books and not, as Velikovsky naively asserted, handwritten manuscripts. [41] The quest to discover the influences on Rockenbach involves a roll call of mostly Lutheran humanists sporting Latinised surnames. It will be helpful to formally distinguish between two lineages of scholarly thought which eventually converged: the classicist tradition of commentaries on Pliny and the scientific study of comets as boosted by the Great Comet of 1577. These will now be discussed in turn.
Pliny’s Commentators
Jacob Milich (Iacobus Milichius; 1501-1559; fig. 3) was a German mathematician, physician and astronomer, born in Freiburg im Breisgau, who studied under Erasmus and spent most of his career teaching in Wittenberg, where he also served as dean and rector. In 1535, he published a commentary on the second book of Pliny’s Natural History. In this first edition, his comment on the Typhon passage was limited to the following:
That is, an awful and horrible comet appeared to the peoples of Egypt & Ethiopia to which the name Tiphon was given, by king Tiphon who was in charge of those places at that time. Nowhere else do I know this story to occur. This comet can be referred to the fourth species, which is called ‘disc’. [42]
Worth noting is that Milich thus settled for the interpretation that the Egyptian king named the comet after himself; that he assigned Typhon to the disceus category of comets, in agreement with the assessment presented above; and that he did not remotely associate it at this time with Biblical history.
Over the next few decades, Milich’s commentary on Pliny went through several revised editions, in which these views were developed further. One published in 1543 added this terse comment, repeated in the edition of 1553: ‘On the Egyptian king Typhon, see Plutarch’s book on Osiris.’ [43] With this one stroke, Milich identified Pliny’s king Typhon

Fig. 5: The first known reference to an Exodus comet, associated with Typhon: page 200 of the 1563 edition of Jacob Milich’s commentary on Pliny, with an almost illegible handwritten note in the margin. As shown by the ex libris marks, this copy was formerly owned by physician Anthonius Jonas Kilianstein (d. 1638) and a Fr. Xav. de Hieber (1773), and was scanned in by the Münchener DigitalisierungsZentrum, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek, Munich (Germany).
with the well-known divine king of that name in Egyptian mythology, whom the Egyptians called ‘Seth’ – as Plutarch correctly stated. [44]
In 1562, the French Protestant writer Antoine du Pinet (c1510-c1584) released a translation of Pliny’s oeuvre into French. So liberal that it is better characterised as a paraphrase, this again treated ‘Typhon’ as the name of the comet and the divine king of Egyptian tradition, but additionally labelled the latter a giant:
Moreover, in the time of the Giant Typhon was seen a terrible comet on the shore of Egypt, & of Ethiopia, which presaged great calamities to those who were living in the said regions. This comet was flaming, & twisted like a snake, which is round, & had a hideous & crooked appearance: so that it was said that it was rather a knot of fire than a star. And this comet was called Typhon because of the Giant Typhon who was in power at that time. [45]
Plutarch had roughly compared the Egyptian myths of the strife between Typhon, Osiris and Horus to the exploits of the Titans, Giants and heroes in Greek lore, but had not directly stamped Typhon as a giant. [46] By doing exactly that, du Pinet practically linked Pliny’s Typhon with the monstrous giant Typhon of Greek myth, who was pitted against Zeus (fig. 4). Perhaps du Pinet introduced the giant aspect not only because of the similarity in name between the two Typhons, but also because of their shared sinuosity, which he emphasised in his text; the Greeks commonly envisioned the mythical giants with serpentine ‘legs’. Parenthetically, fusing the god, the giant and the king into one and the same terrestrial being is quite a different matter from Velikovsky’s fusion of the god, the giant and the comet into one and the same celestial object. It epitomises a Euhemerist approach to myth instead of a catastrophist one, reducing mythical actors to mere mortals rather than extreme natural events.
Milich could hardly have seen du Pinet’s rendition, as he had passed away in 1559. However, the year after du Pinet went to press saw the publication of a new edition of Milich’s commentary on Pliny, posthumously reconstructed from his notes. In this, Milich maintained the link between Pliny’s astronomical Typhon and the Typhon of Egyptian myth, now associated with the giants. Writing history, he also conjectured – as no one had done before him – that the Israelites’ Exodus from Egypt had coincided with the appearance of a comet and that this could have been Typhon (fig. 5):
Construe the following text thus, The comet or star typhon, to which the king of its time gave the name, which was of a fiery and twisted appearance in the likeness of a coil, or of a circle, that star was found to be terrible, that is, devastating by the peoples of Ethiopia & Egypt. Of this star nothing certain is known on account of its age, but it would be fitting for it to fall in the time of the departure of the Israelite people from Egypt, for without doubt signs & prodigies preceded this enormous calamity which overthrew the very flourishing kingdom of Egypt & almost completely destroyed it. This star, they say, was named by king Typhon, whom Herod. bk. 2 called to mind, when he said τοῦτον καταπαύσαντα τυφῶνα βασιλεῦσαι ὕσατον [sic] αἰγύπτου, etc. where he clearly said that the heroic age then ceased, for Typhon is reported with the help of the Giants to have overthrown the Egyptian kings, holy & just men and for himself to have established despotism. This is written by the Greeks. As it was reckoned by Diodorus & Herodotus: And if they are, moreover, combined with sacred writ, we will perceive that this occurred around the time of the departure from Egypt. [47]
Milich evidently presupposed his readers’ familiarity with the passages he referenced from classical authors. These were congruous with Plutarch’s relay of the Egyptian myths about the ‘god’ Typhon. In the Herodotean passage, Typhon and Horus are the last in the pedigree of Egypt’s divine kings: “Before these men, they said, the rulers of Egypt were gods, but none



Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:2 9
had been contemporary with the human priests. Of these gods one or other had in succession been supreme; the last of them to rule the country was Osiris’ son Horus, called by the Greeks Apollo; he deposed Typhon, and was the last divine king of Egypt.” [48] Diodorus’ testimony, rightly relegated by him to “the realm of fable ... in keeping with the simplicity of primitive times”, [49] deserves to be cited in full to facilitate an appreciation of Milich’s rationale. It tells of the Giants’ battle with the rightful kings, notably Osiris:
Furthermore, the Egyptians relate in their myths that in the time of Isis there were certain creatures of many bodies, who are called by the Greeks Giants, but by themselves ..., these being the men who are represented on their temples in monstrous form and as being cudgelled by Osiris. Now some say that they were born of the earth at the time when the genesis of living things from the earth was still recent, while some hold that they were only men of unusual physical strength who achieved many deeds and for this reason were described in the myths as of many bodies. But it is generally agreed that when they stirred up war against Zeus and Osiris they were all destroyed. [50]
They say, namely, that the gods who came into existence in the beginning, being few in number and overpowered by the multitude and the lawlessness of earth-born men, took on the forms of certain animals, and in this way saved themselves from the savagery and violence of mankind; but afterwards, when they had established their power over all things in the universe, out of gratitude to the animals which had been responsible for their salvation at the outset, they made sacred those kinds whose form they had assumed ... [51]
Diodorus did not name Typhon in these two passages, but he did elsewhere in the book and the context demands that those whom the Greeks called giants threw in their lot with Typhon as his “accomplices” (sympráxantas) in murdering Osiris. [52] As evidenced by Plutarch, the analogy between these Egyptian myths and the Greek traditions of Gigantomachy and Typhonomachy, in the early reign of Zeus, did not escape the Greeks and may have shaped their interpretation of the Egyptian lore somewhat. As Herodotus had also stated, the Egyptians traditionally dated these mythical events to before their 1st dynasty of kings and Diodorus took pains to stress the great antiquity of that era in the perception of the Egyptians as compared to the shallow chronologies then in vogue among the Greeks:
For inasmuch as it is generally accepted that Heracles fought on the side of the Olympian gods in their war against the Giants, they say that it in no way accords with the age of the earth for the Giants to have been born in the period when, as the Greeks say, Heracles lived, which was a generation before the Trojan War, but rather at the time, as their own account gives it, when mankind first appeared on the earth; for from the latter time to the present the Egyptians reckon more than ten thousand years, but from the Trojan War less than twelve hundred. [53]
Milich seems to have missed that last point, for he had no compunction in fitting Typhon and the giants into the slot in time corresponding to the Hebrew patriarchs; the mention of human kings of Egypt in the Biblical chapters on Abraham alone should have given him pause for thought. Perhaps he suppressed Diodorus’ contention on the timescale because of a Biblically inspired need for a short chronology or a Jewish sentiment of having a longer history than any neighbouring nations. As it stands, even if the Typhon in the respective reports of Pliny, Herodotus and Diodorus was one and the same, Milich’s chronological linkage of the end of Egypt’s mythical era with the Biblical Exodus amounts to little more than guesswork, predicated on the reading of a king Typhon in Pliny’s text, the common element of an associated crisis in Egypt and perhaps the tacit deduction that the Egyptian gods equated not only to the Greek ‘heroes’, but also to the ‘giants’ of Hebrew legend, who thrived until Joshua’s conquest. [54]
Between 1545 and 1552, at about the same time when Milich would have been preparing the notes expressing his revised view, the Lutheran theologian Johann Funck (Johannes Funccius; 1518-1566), who had also studied in Wittenberg, produced a comparative chronicle of ‘world history’ in parallel columns, dating events in years since the creation of the world (anno mundi = AM), along with several other calendar eras. Funck dated the Israelite Exodus to Egypt’s 18th dynasty, but removed the periods of Egypt’s Old and Middle Kingdoms entirely, replacing the Hyksos of the 15th to the 17th dynasties with the sequence of the divine kings, Euhemeristically conceived as human rulers. As a result of this peculiar procedure, he juxtaposed episodes of Egyptian mythology with Biblical history, correlating the days of Job and Jacob with Osiris’ dethronement at the hands of Typhon, aided by the giants, and the establishment of Typhon’s tyrannical reign, all in AM 2223 (1740 BC); AM 2230 (1733 BC) would have been the year in which Isaac died while Horus and Isis defeated Typhon on the Arabian border; the Israelite descent into Egypt would have happened in AM 2239 (1724 BC); and the Exodus would have occurred in AM 2454 (1509 BC), in the reign of the 18th-dynasty king Acheres. [55] Writing long before the birth of Egyptology and the decipherment of hieroglyphs, Funck based the Egyptian events on classical sources, specifically Manetho, Diodorus and ‘Berossus’. While the information from Manetho and, as seen, Diodorus is genuine, the other is spurious, having long since been exposed as a pseudo-Berossus fabricated by the Italian Dominican historian Giovanni Nanni (Annius of Viterbo; c1432-1502). [56] Funck was not concerned with the comet called Typhon.

It is not impossible that du Pinet had been exposed to Funck’s chronology before linking Pliny’s comet Typhon to the mythical giant of the same name. Milich died seven years or more after the publication of Funck’s opus, but was clearly not aware of it. If he had been, he would probably have assigned an AM date to the year of the comet Typhon and would have explained why he linked the mythical king Typhon with the Israelite Exodus instead of the years running up to the descent into Egypt, as Funck had done. A classicist, Milich would not have needed Funck to be cognisant of the writings of Diodorus and Herodotus. Thus, one might say that Funck was the first to attempt to anchor the mythical king Typhon in Biblical time, but Milich was the first to do so for the comet Typhon, albeit without supplying a year in the anno mundi count. Funck dated Typhon close to the Israelites’ descent into Egypt, Milich to their departure from Egypt. In 1566, a court intrigue led to Funck’s decapitation.
Fallout of the Great Comet of 1577
The Great Comet of 1577 (C/1577 V1) was observed throughout Europe and delivered a great impetus to science, reflected in a proliferation of publications on cometology. Notably, it enabled the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe (1546-1601) to establish that comets travel in space and not, as the prevailing Aristotelian paradigm had demanded, within the earth’s atmosphere. Three developments in the comet’s wake are germane to the present interest: its reception at Istanbul and the appearance of two German chronicles of comets, one in verse and the other in prose.
The Istanbul Interpretation
Stephan Gerlach (Stephanus Gerlachius; 1546-1612; fig. 6) was a German evangelical pastor, who spent the years 15731578 in Istanbul, then called ‘Constantinople’, as a chaplain to the Habsburg ambassador baron David Ungnad (15351600). In a letter which arrived on 25 February 1578, Gerlach informed his friend, the German classicist and historian Martin Kraus (Martinus Crusius; 1526-1607), of the impression the comet had made locally. Kraus reproduced this letter as follows in a monograph he released in 1584:
On the day 25 February ’78 we received a letter from Gerlachius written 29 December ’77, where, among other things, this 10 November (he says) a Comet was seen for the first time, dragging a long tail along: which, much higher now than in the beginning, is gradually disappearing. Some sages of the Turks (behold the fools) judged the star to be a new one, which now appeared for the third time. First, it would have been seen prior to the devastation of Gomorrha: the second time, it would have presaged destruction to the Pharaoh. Now (because it appears not fiery, like in those times, but of a white colour) it would be a harbinger of fertility. [57]
In the two earlier occasions the reader recognises the Biblical catastrophes of the destruction of Sodom, Gomorrah and three other cities in the Dead Sea region by heavenly fire [58] and the Israelite Exodus. Kraus went on to furnish some background on two of the astrologers who were likely – but one cannot tell with certainty – involved in the prognostications:
A few months earlier, an Astrologer had been called to Constantinople from Halepo (Hierapolis), a city of Syria: who would advise the Sultan of his fate by means of the stars. This person erected a high and unroofed tower on the Galatean hill: on top of which he placed an Astrolabe, & multiple great circles of Copper-alloy: from that place he would predict, namely, which friendly Nations, which inimical one Murates will have. It took seven years for the work to be completed, at a stipend of three thousand Ducats a year: he would receive double that from the King upon the work being completed. His assistant is a Thessalonian Jew: the both of whom say that this comet threatens war to Persia & Arabia. [59]
‘Halepo’ is a Latin spelling of ‘Aleppo’, ‘Murates’ of the sultan’s name, ‘Murad (III)’. Kraus’ account is consistent with Gerlach’s own diary entries in German, published posthumously by his grandson. Providing a better temporal resolution of the events, these state that the comet was first seen in the city in the evening of 11 November 1577 and offer some more details on the building of the observatory:



Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:2 11
The Sultan Murat enlisted a stargazer from Cairo who, at the Emperor’s expense, would build outside Galata, on a hill where the house of the Venetian Andreas Gritt has stood, a tower which would be several fathoms deep under the earth and several fathoms wide underneath, so that he would also be able to see the stars in the sky from there by day. He has also had a large brass wheel made on brazen pillars and in 7 years wants to produce a work with which he will henceforth be able to determine for the Emperor all his luck and bad luck, friend and foe from the heavenly courses. His commission is 3000 ducats annually without his other expenses, for all of which he will be reimbursed. When the work is complete he will be given 6000 ducats. He has also brought in another stargazer, a Jew from Salonica who helped the Persian king with his work and would now teach astrology to the Sultan’s teacher’s son. This person says that the comet means misfortune for the barbarians. [60]
On 15 November, Gerlach recorded that the object then appeared smaller due to its proximity to the sun and that an Arab astrologer had predicted its coming beforehand:
Today the comet seemed a bit smaller, because of the sun’s proximity. And M. Oswald tells me that an Arab had proclaimed previously to the Emperor that this comet would appear around this time and two other unusual stars would soon be seen, too, and that he would indicate their meaning when those arrived. [61]
This ‘M. Oswald’ was the renegade Austrian clockmaker Oswald Keyser alias Mahmud Müteferrika. News of the comet’s association with the two Biblical events did not reach Gerlach until the 27th to the 29th of that month:
Today our majordomo says to my Merciful Lord that his scholars say: this comet has appeared only 3 times since the creation of the world. The 1st time when Sodoma and Gomorra were destroyed by fire from the sky, the 2nd time when Pharaoh drowned in the Red Sea. And now the 3rd time. [62]
The ‘Merciful Lord’ was David Ungnad. This firsthand account shows that the definitive historical interpretation of the comet followed almost three weeks on its first appearance. Comparison with the letter addressed to Kraus about a month later reveals differences in the provenance of the renowned Syrian astrologer, Cairo or Aleppo, and the exact location of the tower, on or outside the Galata hill. It is clear today that, confusingly, the tower was not the famous ‘Galata Tower’ built by the Genoese in 1348, but that it was probably located near present-day Taksim Square. [63]
The two authorities Gerlach described were indisputably the controversial Syrian polymath Taqī al-Dīn Muḥammad ibn Ma‘rūf ash-Shāmī al-Asadī (c1526-1585) and the Sephardi rabbi David ben Shushan of Thessalonica, also known as David the Mathematician (Dāwūd al-Riyāḍī). [64] Sultan Murād III (1546-1595), who had ascended to power in 1574, appointed al-Dīn to build the famous observatory at Istanbul. The sources disagree as to whether al-Dīn was born in Damascus or Cairo, but he is known to have been active in Egypt before he was enlisted by the sultan. Assuming the accuracy of Gerlach’s statement that al-Dīn was summoned to Istanbul a few months prior to the appearance of the comet, it may be that it was only then that he entered into the sultan’s service as his personal fortuneteller and that he just happened to be in Hierapolis at that time, this being Manbij in the northeast of Aleppo Governorate. Alternatively, ‘Halepo’, ‘on the Galatean hill’ and perhaps the astrologer’s arrival ‘a few months earlier’ could have been errors which Gerlach corrected in his manuscript after he had sent his letter to Kraus. [65] While the available sources differ as to the exact years in which the building began and ended, it would seem that the observatory was nearing completion when the comet made its appearance. It was certainly dismantled in 1580 or 1581, when the sultan and his advisors waxed sceptical about the reliability and morality of astrology. [66] It was perhaps in an echo of that sentiment that Gerlach or Kraus cast the two sages as patent charlatans, setting no store by their verdict regarding the comet’s history.
The Constantinopolitan opinion regarding the comet of 1577 involved an Exodus comet without any mention of Typhon. Could it have reached Rockenbach, one way or another? Knowledge of it certainly enjoyed a wide circulation in Germany. In 1578, Christopher Hoddesdon (1534-1611) was based in Hamburg as a financial agent for Elizabeth I (1533-1601), queen of England and Ireland. In all likelihood, it was a copy of another letter by Gerlach from which he acquired the information which he forthwith communicated to the English court, years before Kraus’ book saw the light of day:
My lord, by Mr. Allen of the 11th of this month [sic], since which has come into my hands the copy of a letter written from Constantinople, Jan. 12, a copy of which I send you word for word ... Hamburg, 20 March 1577 [sic].
From Constantinople, 12 Jan. / We first saw the new comet here on Nov. 10, seeming at first very small. Certain sophies or astrologians of the Turks affirm it to be a new star, which has shown itself but three times, the first at the destruction of Sodom and Gomorra, the second when Pharaoh perished in the Red Sea. Now the third time, forasmuch as it is not red of colour as at the other times, but of much ‘bleaker’ and whiter colour, it signifies plenty and fruitfulness. The Soldan Murat’s astrologer, whom he called home from ‘Helepo’, with his companion, a Jew of Thessalonia, affirm it to signify wars with Africa and Persia; and it seems that they ‘fail not in all points’, since Ismael, the King of Persia, is dead, and the commons divided concerning the succession; whereby the Turk claims to have his portion therein, and to end those wars and controversies according to their custom, and already a principal nobleman of Persia with many thousands has revolted to the Turk. [67]

If the unnamed correspondent in this letter was Gerlach, he would have written it before altering ‘Aleppo’ to ‘Cairo’. Note that ‘sophies’ is an old spelling for ‘Sufis’, while Kraus’ ‘Arabia’ corresponds to ‘Africa’ in this version.
It could have been from Kraus that the Lutheran clergyman and dramaturge Zacharias Bachmann (Zacharias Rivander; 1553-1594) derived a condensed account of the Istanbul perception of the comet, contained in the almanac he published in 1591 for the Sunday of Advent:
In the year of Christ, 1578. On 10 December there was a comet at Constantinople of which the Turkish Emperor’s astronomer from Halepo and a Jew from Thessalonica said that it is the star which appeared first when Sodoma and Gomorrha and for the second time when Pharaoh in the Red Sea drowned and perished [sic]. [68]
Bachmann’s editing was careless, as ‘1578’ should have read ‘1577’ and ‘December ‘November’. Warts and all, Wenzel Sturm (Wenceslaus Sturmius; 1520-1589), a theologian and pastor, incorporated Bachmann’s text almost verbatim and with attribution, in the calendar of saints he put out in 1599, listed under 10 December. [69] The next year, an equally short extract appeared in the chapter for the year 1579 in a compendium of curiosities written by the jurist, diplomat, historian and theologian Johann Wolf (Johannes Wolfius; 1537-1600): ‘Halepo, astronomer from Thessalonia [sic]. / At this time a comet was seen in Constantinople, the like of which the astronomer Halepo said had not appeared in the world at any earlier time, except then when Sodoma & Gomorrha were burned up from heaven: & Pharaoh, despot of Egypt, was snuffed out in the Red Sea.’ [70] Apart from the compounded error in the year, Wolf conflated the Syrian astronomer and the Jew, mistaking ‘Halepo’ for his name. [71]
The Ottoman take on the comet of 1577 continued to be cited sporadically in the 17th century. A gullible note of acceptance, based on a sort of numerological theory of comets, was still heard from Lutheran astrologer and chiliast Paul Nagel (Paulus Nagelius; c1575-1624), in the book on comets which the Great Comet of 1618 impelled him to write: ‘One can show that the deluge, because the people had not repented, had to happen at the same time while without any doubt such terrible comets must have been seen. ... On this basis and foundation it was possible to know the time when Sodom and Gomorrha had to be extirpated by fire and brimstone from heaven while then, too, such terrible comets must have been seen before. One could have known when and at what time the amazing marvels in Egypt would happen, the Exodus would be seen and Pharaoh with his host would have drowned and suffocated, while then, too, such terrible comets would have been seen over Egypt, which the wise could have easily interpreted had they taken careful note after 400 years of the half great conjunction announced by God the Lord to Abraham.’ [72] More than half a century later, the Age of Enlightenment had dawned and Erasmus Finx (Erasmus Francisci; 1627-1694), writing under pseudonym, was driven to heap scorn on the vacuity of the former comet specialists, taking the Istanbul interpretation as conveyed by Kraus as an example:
Who would endorse everything or value as an oracle what many prognosticators twaddle about? ... We have a laugh at that Mohammedan astrologer who, as Crusius reports in his Turco-Græcia, was summoned from Alepo to Constantinople in order to prophecy to the Sultan from the stars what good fortune and progress against his enemies he would have. He was associated with a Jewish astrologer from Thessalonica in the hope that four eyes of such dreamers would see better than two what the long-tailed comet appearing at that time was foretelling the Great Turk: A tower had to be built for them on a hill at Galata: there on top the Syrian star-prophet placed his astrolabe, along with many measuring circles, and endeavoured to research the comet, which nations would be friend or foe to the Sultan Murat. For this costly fool’s work he required seven whole years and received annually three thousand ducats in compensation with the promise that he would receive double the amount upon completion of the work. At last the prophecy was issued that the comet threatened a war to the Persians and Arabs. [73]
A much more modern writer expressed similar scepticism regarding the motivations of the two Ottoman astrologers in relating the comet of 1577 to the two Biblical events, dismissing them as “attempts to give an astronomical colouring to occurrences recorded in Scripture. Thus the ... comet ... of the Exodus is evidently the fiery pillar or cloud which guided the Israelites out of Egypt.” [74] This last comment lacks support in the text, like in the case of Rockenbach examined above.
Resuming the thread of the present investigation, it must be asked whether any of the writers marshalled above were among the ‘many esteemed authors’ Rockenbach claimed to have consulted. He would not have seen Hoddesden and is hardly likely to have read Kraus and Wolf, but there is a good possibility that the passages in Bachmann and Sturm had come to his attention when he prepared his presentation for 1600.
Schinbain’s ‘Famine Comet’
In a separate development, observation of the Great Comet of 1577 stimulated a Latin schoolmaster of the Catholic persuasion, Johann Görgen Schinbain (Johannes Georgius Tibianus; 1541-1611), to compose a catalogue in German of some 180 comets and other rare phenomena seen in the sky, beginning with early Biblical times and set to rhyme. Published in 1578, this appears to be the earliest collection of comets dated in Funck’s system of years anno mundi. For



Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:2 13
AM 2237, converting to 1726 BC, Schinbain listed in suspicious detail a comet presaging the famine in Egypt and the Levant at the time when the Hebrew patriarchs Jacob and Joseph ‘descended’ into Egypt:
At this time Arabia saw a horrible great star, stood eight nights long, resembling a wheel, in the region of Sagittarius it stood and shows towards the Orient, under Jove’s regiment. Indicated prolonged time of scarcity in the district of Egypt. Mercurius Trismegistus, a formidable philosopher, apparently (as they say) wrote many peculiar offerings regarding this star. [75]
The report from Istanbul associating the comet of 1577 with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Israelite Exodus had not affected Schinbain, as his poem makes no mention of these two events. Instead, for the earliest times it features comets in AM 1656, linked with the flood, AM 2018, inspiring Abraham in Ur of the Chaldees to take up astronomy, and two in AM 228 and 1944 with non-Biblical associations.
Like all of these, the authenticity of the ‘famine comet’ of AM 2237 is doubtful. Overall, Schinbain was meticulous in his identification of sources, but for this entry he offered no more than a reference to the arcane ‘Mercurius Trismegistus’. Better known today as Hermes Trismegistus, this was a famed legendary Egyptian astrologer and alchemist, to whom much Hermetic literature was attributed pseudepigraphically in late-ancient and medieval times. Although Schinbain probably copied some of the information on this comet from an earlier source, the astrologically precise references to Sagittarius and Jupiter could have been fanciful. At the end of his book, Schinbain provided tables specifying the astrological meanings of the appearance of a comet in each of the constellations and for each planetary station. For Sagittarius, he stated: ‘Death of a great lord, earthquake, war, scarcity and great cold.’ [76] And for the regiment of Jupiter: ‘Does it have its station in Jupiter , the religion changes. Hardship follows. A religious head will also come off. In addition alarm for the poor, nor will heresy stay away.’ [77] Did Schinbain or a predecessor put the cart before the horse as he invented comets on the slender basis of their supposed effects, in this case famine and the Israelites’ move from a Canaanite to an Egyptian environment?
Although Typhon is not named in Schinbain’s poem, it comports with this rotund comet in the sense of being frightful, lacking in rays and presumably classified as a disceus. Against that, the southern orientation which Pliny implied for Typhon is less applicable given the reference to the ‘Orient’. It cannot, therefore, be taken for granted that this comet was linked with Typhon before or by Schinbain. Whatever the case may be, Schinbain’s wheel-shaped comet apparently made its way into Rockenbach’s work, directly or indirectly, as an anonymous source comprised in Rockenbach’s ‘some’, with modifications: omission of Jupiter, the eight nights’ duration and Mercurius Trismegistus; change of Sagittarius to Capricorn; specification of the oriental countries involved but without mention of Arabia; and dated to the time of the Exodus instead of the seven-year famine.
Grau’s Synthesis
Georg Grau (Georgius Caesius; 1543-1604), who also studied at Wittenberg, was a Lutheran pastor, calendarist and sometime court astronomer for the margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach. Prompted by the same comet of 1577, Grau produced a chronologically arranged compilation of historical comets in 1579, initially in Latin but followed in the same year by a paraphrase – more than a translation – in German. This work brought Milich’s thought experiment on the Typhon comet, Funck’s world chronology and Schinbain’s ‘famine comet’ together. Grau opened his discussion of the comet Typhon with an impression of Pliny’s account and a citation of Milich’s argument to match Typhon with the Israelite Exodus. This citation was not exact, but shuffled some sentences around and omitted the Greek words. [78] Grau then took issue with Milich by arguing that the correct Biblical correlation of Typhon’s manifestation as a comet was not with the exodus from Egypt, but with the isodus or entry into it some centuries earlier, necessitated by famine. In support, he cites Funck’s chronicle:
Typhon, king of Egypt, lived, according to the Chronology of Funccius, around the time of Job & Joseph, & the death of the Patriarch Isaac, that is, around the year of the world 2230. This comet therefore appeared in the time when the long famine, on which Genes. ch. 41. 42, began in the whole world, namely in the year of the world 2237. Then Jacob the patriarch with his children & grandchildren descended into Egypt. Gen. 46.
It was seen in Arabia, Syria, Babylonia, India, in the form of a wheel in Sagittarius, of which furthermore Mercurius Trismegistus is said to have written much. [79]
The sentence about the wheel-shaped comet came from a different source, as indicated by the words ‘by others’ inserted in the German version. [80] It was clearly dependent on Schinbain or, considering that Grau did not name Schinbain, shared the same source with him. The principal differences are that Grau dropped the eight nights and Jupiter, while specifying the reference to the ‘orient’ as the countries Syria, Babylonia and India. Grau’s inclusion of this sentence in his entry for Typhon resonates with the surmise above that Schinbain’s wheel-shaped comet really masked Typhon. As a final comment to this entry, Grau remarked that the Exodus belonged to a later date and was accompanied by its own prodigies:



14 Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:2
The departure of Israel from Egypt, & the ruin of the Pharaoh with his army in the red sea, happened in the year of the world 2453. Which signs & prodigies preceded it, you have in Exodus. [81]
By identifying the king Typhon of Funck’s chronicle with the comet of the same name, Grau was thus the first to assign the comet named Typhon a date in the AM calendar: 2237 (1726 BC). The Biblical Exodus (AM 2453 = 1510 BC) followed on several miraculous events, but a comet was not among them – in Grau’s estimation – and, although he did not state it expressly, he probably held that the end of the ‘heroic age’ described by the Greeks coincided with the reign of Typhon in the age of Jacob, not the Exodus in the age of Moses.
Reconstructing Rockenbach
The perplexing handling of this material by Rockenbach and his successors can now be more satisfactorily unravelled. The most conservative hypothesis would be that Rockenbach relied solely on Grau, using the following thought process. He means to follow Grau in dating the king and comet Typhon to the Biblical time of Joseph and the famine, but also intends to accommodate Milich’s notion of an Exodus comet, embedded in Grau’s text, as the opinion of ‘others’ (aliqui) that this same Typhon ‘also’ (quoq;) made an appearance at the later time of the Exodus. However, by placing the year of the Exodus (AM 2453) at the outset of the whole entry, he muddles the chronology. This conclusion essentially concurs with Keith Mills’, [82] the main difference being that Rockenbach’s association of Typhon with the Exodus was not primarily the result of editorial errors, but of a poorly executed desire to fit in Milich’s opinion.
From Grau’s quotation of Milich, Rockenbach takes the statement of the giants assisting Typhon, meaning to transfer this aspect from the time of the Exodus to that of the descent into Egypt, just like Grau would have it but did not state as much. In Grau’s own comments, Rockenbach misses the logical break between the sentence on Typhon’s appearance as a wheel-shaped comet mentioned by Mercurius Trismegistus and that regarding the date of the Exodus, grouping them together as if part of the same event; in the process, he leaves out Arabia and substitutes Capricorn for Sagittarius, probably unintentionally. Grau’s allusion to the miracles preceding the Exodus inspires Rockenbach’s reference to the Biblical column of cloud and fire, though – as seen – without implying that this column was the comet. Returning to Grau’s quotation from Milich, Rockenbach duplicates the reference to Herodotus’ statement on the closure of the heroic age, adding that the giants ceased to exist concomitant with the devastation of Egypt prefigured by Typhon. The ‘afterwards’ (Postea) with which the final sentence on the seven-year famine opens would have been intended as following closely on the appearance of the comet in the immediately preceding sentence, presumed to have occurred at the time of Isaac, as Grau had had it. This interpretation is more transparent if the segment mentioning the wheel-shape and the Exodus is understood as an aside, placed between brackets as it were, which grew out of Grau’s discursive remark on the Exodus.
Wrapping up, Keith Mills correctly felt that Rockenbach’s assignment of Typhon to the Mosaic period lacks support in the available classical witnesses; it was undeniably a learned speculation originating with early Lutheran humanists. However, the association of Typhon with the Exodus did not spring inadvertently from Rockenbach’s botched editing, but was consciously made by Milich and transmitted to Rockenbach via Grau. Although in theory all elements in Rockenbach’s discussion can thus be traced to Grau, Rockenbach may well have seen Schinbain’s poem, and the theory of the Great Comet of 1577 espoused by the Ottoman astrologers could have fed into his analysis, too, via Bachmann, Sturm or perhaps even Wolf or Kraus. The identification of these influences exonerates Rockenbach from the charge of having spun a yarn about his reliance on multiple respectable sources. The French anomalist Dominique Caudron would appear to be the only other modern researcher to have anticipated all of Keith Mills’ main points and discovered the contributions of Milich and Grau. His survey left him cynical:
It is remarkable that Velikovsky makes of the comet Typhon that of the Exodus, when two centuries and a half before him William Whiston made of it that of the deluge. All this for a bolide commented on more than a millennium later. [83]
Rockenbach’s Immediate Successors
Keith Mills painstakingly analysed the discussions of Typhon’s comet by Rockenbach and Hewelcke, but had little to say regarding Herlicius. This was David Herlitz (1557-1636; fig. 7), a German physician, mathematician, astronomer, historian and poet who studied in Wittenberg, Leipzig and Rostock. The work by Herlitz which Hewelcke cited was not Kurtzer Discvrs vom [sic] Cometen ... (1619 [sic]), as Keith Mills assumed, [84] but his monograph on the comet of 1607 (published 1608). [85] Although the word ‘Typhon’ does not appear in it, the following account of a comet seen in AM 2237 (1699 BC) is doubtless what Hewelcke was referring to:
In the year of the world 2237 a horrible comet like a wheel would have appeared in all of Arabia for eight nights in the region of Sagittarius, under Jove’s command, of which Mercurius Trismegistus would have related many marvels in his books: And would have been seen in Syria, Babylonia and even in the interior of India. Will perhaps also have announced the prolonged famine in Egypt. But this is not the occasion to elaborate on that. [86]

This description follows Schinbain’s in all respects, except that Herlitz offers the more specific list of Syria, Babylonia and India where Schinbain merely had ‘orient’. As these are the exact three countries which Grau specified, but Grau left out the eight nights’ duration and Jupiter, Grau and Herlitz must both have worked from some other source than Schinbain. This could be the mysterious text of Mercurius Trismegistus referred to.
Heinrich Eckstorm (Henricus Eckstormius; 1557-1622), a German theologian, solved the dating conundrum by postulating two comets: the wheel-shaped one associated with the famine of Jacob’s day, Sagittarius and – following Schinbain or Herlitz Jupiter in AM 2237, and Typhon associated with the Herodotean passage and the Exodus in AM 2454. [87]
Hewelcke did not cite Schinbain, but recognised that Rockenbach’s discussion was garbled and, drawing heavily on Grau and Eckstorm, also resorted to a double comet, though he struck out any references to giants: Typhon in AM 2230 associated with Jacob’s famine, and the wheel-shaped comet in AM 2453 seen outside Egypt and tied to the Exodus; like Rockenbach, he placed the latter in Capricorn. [88] This interpretation was the reverse of Eckstorm’s as far as Typhon is concerned: for Eckstorm Typhon was the later comet, for Hewelcke the earlier one.
Like the Ottoman perception of the comet of 1577, these various ideas experienced a long Nachleben through the remainder of the 17th century, which it is not essential to review here. To cite but a single example, Increase Mather (1639-1723) was a Puritan clergyman and president of Harvard College for twenty years with some involvement in the Salem witch trials, who put out a catalogue of historical comets in the English language. In this, he posited Typhon as a comet for the famine beginning in AM 2230, in Sagittarius, and an Exodus comet in AM 2453, in Capricorn:
A. M. 2230. A fiery and terrible comet was seen, appearing in Sagittarius, coyling after a strange manner, representing the form of an imperfect circle. It was judged that Pliny speaks of this prodigy. It was by the king of Egypt then living called by the name of Typhon, i.e. Vortex fumigans sed sine igne [89]. Which seems to confirm their opinion, who think that in old time a comet was known by that name of a pillar of smoke. After this comet, there was a dearth for seven years together, and that in all countries, viz. that spoken of in the Scripture in Joseph’s time, which followed the seven years plenty in Egypt. Canaan, Ethiopia, Egypt and other countries felt the direful effects of that prodigy.
A. M. 2453. A comet was observed in Syria, Chaldea, &c. in the sign of Capricorn; in which year the children of Israel were delivered from their bondage to the Egyptians, when Pharaoh and his host received that fatal and memorable overthrow so much celebrated in the holy book of God. [90]

In German translation, the ambiguity is more easily expressed, e.g.: “Ein furchtbarer Komet ..., dem König Typhon, der zu dieser Zeit regierte, seinen Namen lieh”, G. Winkler & R. König (trs.), C.

Winkler & König (op. cit., p. 75) rendered iubar (‘radiance’) as ‘the sparkling tail’ (“den funkelnden Schweif”), but the reading “no rays” of Rackham (op. cit., p. 235) is more defensible; while iuba means “mane” and hence “train, tail (of a comet)” (as in Pliny, Natural History, 2. 22 [89]), iubar properly stands for “The first light of day” and “Radiance, brightness (of heavenly bodies, fire, etc.)” – P. G. W. Glare (ed.), Oxford Latin Dictionary, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 20122, p. 1073 s.v. ‘iuba’, ‘iubar’. 7. Pliny, Natural History, 2. 22 (89); 2. 23 (91). The translation of Winkler & König (op. cit., p. 73), “lassen nur wenige Strahlen aus dem Rande hervorgehen”, conveys this sense better than Rackham (op. cit., p. 233), who had “rays, which even the Quoit-star ... emits in scattered form from its edge.” 8.

Velikovsky (op. cit., p. 83 n. 8) mistakenly spelled “quadrigentesimo”, “ex Aegypto” in the first sentence, “Aegyptioru” and “volut”. 33.

word-final nasals to save space (p. 34 n. 1). As for his translation, Rockenbach’s words “ut aliqui volũt” do not mean “as if rolling along another road” (p. 34), but simply ‘as some wish’, cf. Velikovsky (op. cit., p. 83): “Certain [authorities] assert” and Keith Mills (op. cit., p. 35): “as some would say”. 36. Velikovsky, op. cit., p. 83. Compare the editor’s comment to Sutherland, op. cit., p. 33 n. *. 37. In Pliny’s text, the equivalent words conperta Aethiopum et Aegypti populis may also be translated, with populis taken as an ablative, as ‘learned of from the peoples of Ethiopia and Egypt’. Keith Mills (op. cit., p. 36) did this for the identical phrase in Hewelcke, but not in Rockenbach itself, where Aegiptijs & Aethiopibus allows only a dative reading. 38. Keith Mills, op. cit., pp. 36 and 41-42 n. 14. 39. Rockenbach, op. cit., pp. 116-117. As noted, a tilde over a vowel was a typographic abbreviation marking the elision of an n or m following the vowel. Another convention was to shorten the enclitic conjunction -que to the ligature here rendered as -q;. 40. For more on crescentic comets, see M. A. van der Sluijs, ‘Hll: Lord of the Sickle’, Journal of Near Eastern Studies 68. 4, 2009, pp. 270-273, 275-276. 41. contra Velikovsky, op. cit., pp. 82, 84 and as predicted by Keith Mills (op. cit., p. 33). Who were Clube & Napier (op. cit., p. 217) thinking of when they assured: “Some mediaeval historians held that a comet appeared in the sky at the time of the Deluge, and another at the time of Exodus”? They confessed to being at a loss, after all, with regard to Rockenbach’s sources (p. 220). They did, in the same breath, refer to the “fifteenth-century Christian propagandist Orosius”. However, Orosius lived in the 5th century AD and regarded the Exodus as coeval with the world’s burning by Phaethon without relating it or the Biblical deluge to a comet – Historiae adversus Paganos (Histories against the Pagans), 1. 10. 19, tr.

51. Diodorus of Sicily, Bibliotheca, 1. 86. 3, tr. Oldfather, op. cit., pp. 292-295. These “earth-born men” were the giants mentioned earlier. H. J. Rose (‘Mythological Scraps’, The Classical Quarterly 24. 2, 1930, pp. 107-108) and J. G. Griffiths (‘The Flight of the Gods before Typhon: An Unrecognized Myth’, Hermes 88. 3, 1960, p. 374) compiled classical sources for the ‘forgotten’ myth of the gods fleeing from Typhon disguised as animals, including Plutarch, Moralia: On Isis and Osiris, 72 (379f). A. Burton (Diodorus Siculus; Book I; A
Commentary, ‘Études préliminaires aux religions orientales dans l’empire Romain’ 29, E. J. Brill, Leiden, 1972, p. 252, cf. 110-111) ran into a paradox in her attempt to reconcile the two passages quoted from Diodorus with each other and Egyptian iconography: “In fact, both chapters seem to be diametrically opposite explanations of a single type of relief, that of a large figure of Horus or Osiris smiting Seth and his followers, usually represented in much smaller proportions and in the form of animals such as crocodiles or hippopotami. Since Seth and his followers were occasionally called Giants by the Classical authors, the version given in ch. 26 is indeed a true explanation. But it is easy to see how a similar relief might be interpreted as showing a Giant (actually Horus, but mistakenly assumed to be Seth/Typhon) attacking a number of animals.” Perhaps the solution is twofold. On one hand, what the Greeks recognised as Giants were perceived by the Egyptians themselves as monstrous more than gigantic per se; thus, the dichotomy was that between Typhon and the monsters on one side and zoomorphic gods on the other, the latter often shown towering above the former. On the other hand, some mythical shapeshifting may be assumed on both sides. Griffiths (op. cit., pp. 375-376), disproving Rose’s scepticism regarding an Egyptian origin of the myth, cited one Egyptian text in which Isis and Horus transform into animals in order to escape from Set, but also a few texts in which the confederacy of Set change into diverse animals; “In taking over the Egyptian myth, ... the Greeks introduced those metamorphoses which would explain the animal forms of the principal Egyptian gods.” On Typhon as Set, see further part 2. 52.

Trials on the Trails
of Typhon and the Exodus
Part 2
Marinus Anthony van der Sluijs
The Comet al-Kayd
In part 1, published in C&C Review 2020:2, pp. 3-22, classical reports on the comet Typhon were assessed and Rockenbach’s sources for his handling of this comet and its link with the Biblical Exodus were definitively identified. The remaining part of this study will be dedicated to: an attempt to determine just how far back in time the idea of a comet associated with the Exodus or the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah can be traced; an attempt to formulate a plausible context in the history of ancient Egypt for the comet Typhon with which classical authors from Pliny onwards were concerned; and a number of corollaries addressing related matters raised by Velikovsky and others.
Whether or not the comet Typhon ever manifested, at least the notion of it reaches back to antiquity. Can the same be said of an ‘Exodus comet’? Two outstanding questions are: was there an earlier tradition tapped into by al-Dīn and ben Shushan when they spoke of a comet seen during the overturning of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Hebrew Exodus? And what was the elusive ‘Mercurius Trismegistus’ referenced by some of the German literati?
To start with the second challenge, the standard Hermetic text of the Pymander was widely read in 16th-century Europe, but contains only the slightest reference to comets. [1] Some commentaries on it, notably that by the Calabrian Minorite theologian Annibale Rosselli (Hannibal Rosselius; 1525-1593) written between 1584 and 1586, expatiated on the comets, [2] but I have not found a match for the wheel-shaped object associated with the famine of Genesis in them. This is not to say that the notion of the wheel-shaped comet arrived out of thin air, however.
Lists of comet types and their properties supposedly defined by Hermes occur in at least two medieval Arabic treatises on astronomy. The closest approximation I have been able to locate so far comes from a precious manuscript which only came to scholars’ attention in 2002, when it was acquired by Oxford’s Bodleian Library. It appears to have been produced in the late 12th or the early 13th century AD, but the copied text itself is quite firmly dated to the period between AD 1020 and 1050. Written in Egypt, its title is Kitāb Gharā’ib al-Funūn wa-Mulaḥ al-‘Uyūn (Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes). The anonymous author included two chapters on the astrological significance of comets. The first of these gives a general discussion, a list of the consequences of comets for their appearance in each astrological sign and a list of 11 comet types attributed to Ptolemy; the second enumerates 28 categories of comets and meteors ascribed to ‘Hermes’. A sketch accompanies each genus of comet. [3] One of the Ptolemaic comets is the Ṭayfūr, [4] in which specialists recognise a survival of the Graeco-Roman ‘Typhon’. [5] Of the various types, specific historical occurrences are given for only two. One dates to the early 11th century AD [6] and is irrelevant for the present purpose; the other, by contrast, is also the only one to qualify as a credible match for the wheelshaped comet of the Lutherans (fig. 1):
Figure 1: The top part of folio 14B of the Bodleian manuscript Arab. c. 90 (late 12th or early 13th century AD), showing the portion of the Book of Curiosities of the Sciences and Marvels for the Eyes (AD 10201050) which deals with several Ptolemaic types of comets, the one at the bottom being al-Kayd. Rapoport & Savage-Smith 2014: fol. 14v.



Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:3 25
As for the red, round star surrounded by a dark blackness, the Indians say that it is seen in their lands. They call it al-kayd (the deception). It ascends in their lands like a huge sack. It is one of the most inauspicious and ill-omened stars, and the most disruptive of essential needs. The ancient nations that have perished, such as ‘Ād and Thamūd, the people of Madyan, and the generation of Noah, all perished when this star appeared. The Indians believe that no other star brings destruction as this one, and that is more ominous than the conjunction of Mars with Saturn. [7]
Almost certainly, it was a passage much like this one which the unknown source mined by Schinbain, Grau and Herlitz used for the report on the wheel-shaped comet in Sagittarius. The Arabic author cited above grouped al-Kayd under the Ptolemaic comets, not the Hermetic ones. However, it was the last one in his Ptolemaic list and appeared on the same page as the first comets of Hermes. Consequently, if – for argument’s sake – the Germans relied on this very book the association of this particular comet with Hermes would be inaccurate, but understandable. Just as in the German accounts, the ‘star’ is ‘round’ and exceedingly horrific. ‘Ād and Thamūd were legendary pre-Islāmic civilisations in the interior of Saudi Arabia and Yemen, whilst Madyan is the Biblical Midian, in the northwestern part of the Arabian Peninsula. AlKayd was thus associated with India and Arabia, just like the wheel-shaped comet in the German sources, for which Syria, Babylonia and Egypt were given as further locations of observation. In the traditional cycle of Islāmic legendry, the successive destructions of ‘Ād and Thamūd by drought, wind and lightning occurred between Noah’s flood and the time of Abraham, while the people of Madyan met their demise in a giant earthquake and heat, at the time of the prophet Shu‘ayb between Joseph and Moses. [8] The passage cited above gives the impression of an ancient theory according to which al-Kayd foreboded all large-scale decimations of entire cultures, or at least those in the region effected by phenomena of fire and heat. While the annihilation of Thamūd resembles the Biblical tale of the overturning of Sodom and Gomorrah, the ruin brought upon the generation of Noah is the only event which is also directly mentioned in the Bible. For that reason, the passage cited above is the oldest known expression of the idea of a comet associated with one or more major Biblical catastrophes.
The famine at the time of Jacob and Joseph is not alluded to in the cited passage, but the connection with al-Kayd could easily be made if the comet had appeared in Sagittarius. For comets in that constellation, the anonymous Arabic author gave the following characteristics:
If it appears in the sign of Sagittarius, the air will become warmer, and it will be excessively hot. Land animals will die and perish. Winds carrying hot sandstorms will blow, killing wild beasts. Then there will appear in the sky a portent from the stars that would quell [these winds]. The king will become harsher towards the notables and the common people, and he will be intent on amassing property and humiliating his subjects, saddling them with injustice and oppression. One of the king’s most powerful enemies and foes will die in the east of that region. [9]
Someone with an interest in correlating the comet theory in this text with Biblical events could have gathered that the respective destructions of ‘Ād, Thamūd and perhaps Madyan all involved heat disasters; that they must have been heralded by al-Kayd in Sagittarius; and that Joseph’s famine belongs in the same category, as further confirmed by the shift in attitude causing the Pharaoh to enslave the Israelites where they had hitherto been guests. Recall also that Herlitz remained cautious about the association of this comet with Joseph’s famine.
All the same, there are reasons to assume that the text informing the hypothetical common source of Schinbain, Grau and Herlitz was not the exact version of the Book of Curiosities contained in the Bodleian manuscript or other known manuscripts. The comet’s eight-night duration mentioned by Schinbain and Herlitz remains unaccounted for and the accompanying illustration in the Book of Curiosities shows al-Kayd to be rectangular; despite the roundness indicated in the text, it is unlikely that a reader confronted with such a picture would take away the message that the object has the shape of a wheel.
Speculating further, it is even possible that the Constantinopolitans al-Dīn and ben Shushan obtained their knowledge of a red comet at the time of the ruination of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Exodus from this or a closely related source; were they identifying the Great Comet of 1577 with the red-black al-Kayd? Because Shu‘ayb was traditionally identified as the Biblical Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, a flexible thinker could have linked the obliterations of Thamūd and Madyan with the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and Egypt’s ten plagues followed by the Exodus, respectively.
One manuscript of the Book of Curiosities was transcribed in 1564 in Syria, where it remains today. [10] Theoretically, al-Dīn could have shown this to associates of the Habsburg embassy in Istanbul, who could have passed on the information to European contacts. Other routes of transmission can be imagined. A manuscript produced in 1571 was donated to the Bodleian Library by Paul Pindar in 1611 [11] but could have been seen by Europeans long before that year. An undated copy, apparently also from the 16th century, made its way at an uncertain time to the Biblioteca Ambrosiana in Milan, Italy. [12] All these versions feature the rectangular picture of al-Kayd. [13]

Al-Kayd was a recurrent object in medieval Arabic and Byzantine astronomy. [14] The Christian ‘Iraqī astrologer ibn Hibintā (fl. AD 950) was the first known Arabic writer to mention it, indeed devoting a large subchapter to it in his Complete Book on Astrology, without providing an illustration. [15] In this, he stated that this tailed star appears every century and travels through the zodiac in retrograde direction. [16] He “provided a long list of dire consequences if alkayd is configured with certain planets in particular zodiacal signs, and he attributed all this to the legendary EgyptianGreek sage Hermes.” [17] Ibn Hibintā’s discussion is extant, but has not yet been translated from the Arabic. It was probably not the source of which the anonymous author of the Book of Curiosities availed himself, [18] but is a contender for the source which the early Lutherans recalled as ‘Mercurius Trismegistus’, who had ‘written much’ about the pertinent comet. Hopefully someone proficient in Arabic will be able to resolve this matter.
In the meantime, the quest is far from over as it will still need to be established whether the 11th-and 10th-century pronouncements on al-Kayd sprang from scholarly speculation or an orally transmitted memory of genuine events. Unlike most of the other comets listed in the Book of Curiosities, al-Kayd lacks an equivalent in the comet classifications known from classical sources, suggesting an origin in oriental tradition. Persian astrologers were acquainted with it; according to one anonymous Persian manuscript of uncertain date, held in Berlin, ‘The astrologers regard it as baneful and call it shaiṭân-i-falak, that is to say, the devil of the sphere’. [19] The ultimate provenance of the concept was incontestably Indian. [20] Kayd, meaning ‘deception’ in Arabic, was probably a folk etymology inspired by Sanskrit Ketu. In Hindū as in Arabic astronomy, it connoted the descending lunar node, that is, the point where the moon enters the southern ecliptic hemisphere. With Rāhu, the ascending lunar node, it was classed among the planets and invoked to explain eclipses:
When the sun and the moon find themselves simultaneously in the same node or sufficiently close to it, there is a solar eclipse; when one of the two stars occupies the ascending node and the other at the same the descending node, a lunar eclipse takes place. [21]
The supposition of the two ‘invisible planets’ Rāhu and Ketu to account for eclipses became obsolete when the orbital inclination of the moon was understood. In accordance with an archaic myth of an eclipse monster, encountered worldwide, Rāhu and Ketu were visualised as the creature’s dismembered head and tail, and this conception forms the mythological bridge to the additional function of ‘Ketu’ as the standard designation of comets, meteors, other assorted transient luminous phenomena and even sunspots. [22] Even if standard textbooks and encyclopedias often make it seem otherwise, the meaning ‘comet’ or ‘strange celestial object’ will have been more original than ‘lunar node’, possibly dating back to a prehistoric mythological world view. [23] In a classic text written in the 6th century AD, comets were classified in a large number of categories with distinct properties and names such as ‘Vasā Ketu’, ‘Hasti Ketu’ and ‘Kapāla Ketu’. [24] These types, with their characteristic shapes and colours, are reminiscent of the Ptolemaic and Hermetic types in the Book of Curiosities in that some of them are closely associated with one of the planets and many come in compact clusters with specific spatial arrangements.
Wherever it appears in Arabic literature, “the ‘comet’ al-kayd is always associated with India and its implications for humanity are always catastrophic.” [25] The Hindū origin of al-Kayd means that its alleged appearance in the days of Noah, ‘Ād, Thamūd and Madyan can only have been the fruit of astrological speculation, at best motivated by a similar association of Ketu with tumultuous events in the distant past of Hindū myth or legend. Accordingly, even this wispy trace of a possible comet linked with the formative stages in Israel’s history dissolves. This leaves only Typhon as an astronomical object with a plausible claim to veridicality.
Typhon’s Egyptian Origins
Ironically, the negative conclusions reached so far with respect to an ‘Exodus comet’ do not necessarily rule out that whatever celestial spectacle gave rise to the classical tradition of the comet Typhon was in fact of such hoary age as the Biblical time of the patriarchs.
The Petosiris cited by Servius Auctus and Hephaestio was the traditional author of a standard astrological text, featuring a typology of comets, which was co-authored by the equally legendary Egyptian scholar-king Nechepso; [26] both may have flourished in Hellenistic times. Nechepso would be the ideal candidate for Keith Mills’ notion – and Caudron’s [27] – of a real Egyptian king bestowing the Greek name ‘Typhon’ onto a portentous celestial object at a late time in Egyptian history. However, going by John of Lydia’s claim that ‘Typhons’ did not appear in Roman times Nechepso would probably have to be disqualified as the Typhonian king, depending on one’s definition of ‘Roman times’. At any rate, it is by no means requisite that the original name for the astronomical object had been in Greek. Nothing militates against the possibility that an Egyptian writing in Greek, like Petosiris, offered ‘Typhon’ as an interpretatio Graeca of an older Egyptian term.
As has long been recognised, [28] ‘Set’ (Egyptian stš, śtḫ, śtḥ and other variants) would be a feasible model, considering the well-established equivalence of that god and the mythical Greek monster Typhon since at least the 6th century BC. [29] Set, after all, as the ‘lord of foreign lands’ and itself an interpretatio Aegyptiaca of the West Semitic Baal (Bá‘lu),

was the patron of adverse types of weather, along with military might and the red desert outside the fertile Nile valley. [30]
Because Pliny’s Typhon is a clearly defined celestial body befitting a historical observation, the familiar cycle of cosmogonic myths in which Set appears alongside Horus, Isis and Osiris is not a viable source. [31] A modern chronology of the royal Egyptian dynasties no longer permits aligning the predynastic period with the Hebrew patriarchs, as was done in 16th-century Germany, so the mythical events involving Set which Herodotus and Diodorus were dealing with can no longer be linked with the time of the Israelite ‘descent’ into or ‘ascent’ out of Egypt. This stance is consistent with that articulated by Plutarch in his own day:
But those who relate that Typhon’s flight from the battle was made on the back of an ass and lasted for seven days, and that after he had made his escape, he became the father of sons, Hierosolymus and Judaeus, are manifestly, as the very names show, attempting to drag Jewish traditions into the legend. [32]
Apparently and perhaps unbeknownst to them, Milich and his ilk had some predecessors in the 1st century AD in their efforts to give Typhon, who is Set, some historical semblance by integrating his mythology with Hebrew history. Yet where the Lutherans were inclined to cast Typhon as an Egyptian tyrant, Plutarch’s anonymous targets were bent on identifying him with a Hebrew ancestor escaping from Egypt. The difference is not absolute insofar as the Typhon of myth was an oppressor who had acquired the throne through a coup d’état and was eventually expelled.
In actual history, the rule of the Hyksos was admittedly a period which the Egyptians could only view as a symbolic echo of Set’s tyrannical hegemony followed by his ousting. [33] In that vein, Bimson proposed in this same journal that the king Typhon of Rockenbach’s and Pliny’s text was the first Hyksos ruler, whose name ‘Salitis’ should be read ‘Saites’ – a “distortion” of ‘Seth’. [34] He founded this argument on Rockenbach’s description of Typhon as a despotic conqueror, possibly a foreigner, assisted by the Levantine Anakites as the ‘giants’. This approach concords with the fact that Rockenbach’s underlying chronology was that of Funck, who had put the reign of Typhon in the slot immediately preceding the 18th dynasty, where others like Manetho had placed the Hyksos. However, Bimson was unaware of Funck or any other of Rockenbach’s sources, while Rockenbach himself does not seem to have known of the Hyksos, so that the agreement is accidental both for Bimson and Rockenbach. Nor does it help in the final analysis, as Funck’s chronology was plainly wrong. The discovery of Rockenbach’s sources reported above reveals incontrovertibly that the endeavours of Typhon and the giants, lifted from Diodorus and Herodotus, belonged squarely in the framework of primordial myths, having nothing whatsoever to do with the Hyksos. No one would argue today that the myth of Osiris’ dismemberment and reconstitution or the birth of Horus had its Sitz im Leben at the time of the Hyksos. The same goes for Set’s usurpation and expulsion. Moreover, all these attempts to couple Typhon with Israel’s sojourn in Egypt, whether its beginning or its end, shed no light on Pliny’s testimony of Typhon as a comet; a dead end is reached with them. [35] Even the Velikovskian scenario in which Typhon is the pillar of cloud and fire fails to convince, as the classical description of the former bloody red, a fiery knot, globe or crescent of modest size with thin filaments – sounds nothing like the Biblical account of the latter.

At this point, it may be rewarding to reconsider the nature of the ‘naming’. How likely is it that an Egyptian king, especially a pre-Hellenistic one, would lend a disinterested hand in a matter of dry astronomical nomenclature? Would it not a priori be reasonable to suspect that the ruler, by conferring his name on the ‘star’ or vice versa, established his symbolic identity or a relation of patronage with it? There can be no argument that such a grandiose act would be very much in the spirit of archaic Pharaonic thought. For titles with a stellar component, Psusennes I (1047-1001 BC), II (976943 BC) and III (976-943 BC) used the birth name “The star who has appeared in Niut” (pɜ sbɜ ḫ‘ n nỉwt), Niut being Thebes. [36] An earlier and more elaborate case of royal identification with a prodigious star is on record for the 18thdynasty king Thutmose III, one of Egypt’s greatest warrior pharaohs, who – on conventional dates – ruled from 1479 to 1425 BC. For c1446-1444 BC, this king reported on his victory stela a “miracle” (bjɜyt) which involved the unexpected nocturnal appearance of a flaming “star” (sbɜ) during a confrontation between his army and that of Mitanni (fig. 2):
... then you will know the miracle of [Amun-Re] in the presence of the Two Lands. [...] not [... sentr]ies were in the very act of being posted at night in order to do their regular watch. There were two astronomers (present). A star approached, coming to the south of them. The like had not happened before. It shot straight toward them (the enemy), not one of them could stand [...] falling headlong. Now then [...] was behind them with fire in their faces. Not one of them retaliated; no one looked back. Their chariotry is gone, they (the horses?) having bolted in [...] in order that all foreigners might see the awe of my majesty. [37]
In the prologue to this text, the triumphant king is himself eulogised as the embodiment of the “star” coursing between the two wings of his army as if between the ‘bows’ or ‘arcs’ of the sky and exercising his might through the serpent worn on his diadem:
He is one who immediately overwhelms all foreign lands while at the head of his army, as he shoots between the two divisions of troops, like a star he crosses the sky, entering into the throng, [while a bl]ast of his flame is against them with fire, turning into nothing those who lie prostrate in their blood. It is his uraeus that overthrows them for him, his flaming serpent that subdues his enemies, with the result that numerous armies of Mitanni were overthrown in the space of an hour, annihilated completely like those who had not existed, in the manner of those who are burned ... [38]
Despite this stylistic method of equating the king with the “star”, the assurance that “The like had not happened before” (n ḫpr mjtt) and the king’s attribution of the “miracle” to a god, apparently Amun-Ra, can only mean that the celestial apparition actually eventuated. [39]
One could be forgiven for wondering whether this very incident was the singular extraordinary event behind the classical tradition of the comet Typhon. The “star” approached from the south and, mindful of Pliny’s statement that the ‘terrible one was experienced by the peoples of Ethiopia and Egypt’ it may not be irrelevant that the stela from which the cited

text is taken was erected in Nubia (today northern Sudan), where Thutmose III waged his last campaign. Professional “astronomers” (wnwtj) were present, who, besides being “experts in reading signs in the heavens to predict the outcome of his ventures”, [40] could have preoccupied themselves with the matter of classifying and naming the “star”, naturally in accord with the king’s wishes. Also, the “star” seems to have been of a similar nature as Typhon. Its devastating effects upon the pharaoh’s enemies in the guise of a fiery uraeus and the proclaimed uniqueness of the event indicate something truly alarming like an impacting bolide. Weinfeld inferred that “a comet fell out of its fixed place” and referred to the object as a “meteorite”. [41] Younger guessed that the phenomenon could have been “a comet or supernova”. [42] Cumming preferred “a meteorite or possibly the phenomenon called ball lightning”. [43] Helck suggested ‘meteor’, but also remarked: ‘But what kind of ‘star’, then, rises towards them exactly ‘from the south’ remains indeterminable.’ [44] Similarly, Keith Mills and others long before him recognised a bolide rather than a comet proper in the descriptions of Typhon. [45] Comets are seen throughout the hemisphere, but the Typhon which Pliny and his successors were concerned with was visible in a geographically restricted region, more in line with a meteoric phenomenon. Caudron drew attention to a recent repetition of this type of event in the same part of the world: on 7 October 2008, the micro-asteroid 2008 TC3 exploded over northern Sudan at an altitude of 37 km, illuminating the pre-dawn landscape up to 725 km away and leaving a meandering trail visible long enough to be filmed at dawn (fig. 3). [46] As a competing view, comparable to Cumming’s take on Thutmose’s star, van Doorn explained Typhon in terms of ball lightning, with intrinsic vortical properties. [47]
Further, although Thutmose III is not known to have borne a ‘stellar’ epithet, he did on occasion style himself ‘beloved of Set’ (mry stḥ). [48] In the sumptuous Festival Hall at the rear of his temple complex at Karnak, he had himself depicted being taught the use of the bow by Set (fig. 4). [49] Presumably, Set received such honours in military settings above all: “It seems to have been especially in the circles of the colonial army that Seth was held in honour.” [50] And: “Seth is the extraneous source of a king’s manic strength and capacity to do violence, qualities that it was necessary for him to tap in time of war. In the account of the battle of Megiddo, the strength of Seth was said to pervade Thutmose’s limbs; and in the height of the battle of Kadesh, Ramesses II was perceived as the very embodiment of Seth by the enemy, who fled before him. Examples of such interweaving of divine and human energies in the ancient world could be multiplied almost ad infinitum.” [51] Moreover, a dreadful atmospheric event such as the disintegration of a bolide or ball lightning would have been judged to be within the province of Set or Baal as a storm god, even without circumstances of armed conflict.
All things considered, it would perhaps not be absurd to suggest that Thutmose III, with his astronomers, viewed the decisive mid-air explosion or impact of a fireball in the course of his battle against Mitanni as an intervention by his divine patron Set and that sufficient knowledge of this event survived for Hellenistic astronomers to define ‘Typhon’ as a category of dire ‘comet’ which was ‘named’ by and in some sense even after a king.
Going further still, the date of Thutmose’s fireball comes uncannily close to the orthodox date of the Hebrew Exodus as calculated following the Masoretic text of the Hebrew Bible. While this is not the place to go into the complexities of Biblical dating and I remain uncommitted on that subject, suffice it to consider that the conventional dates of Thutmose III’s reign must almost certainly be revised downwards [52] and the Biblical dates, too, are far from certain, assuming that the Exodus was even a real event. As for the identification of Typhon with Thutmose’s star, it ought to be observed that Thutmose III seems to have credited the astronomical ‘miracle’ to Amun-Ra, not Set; that the classical descriptions of Typhon contain visual details not found in Thutmose’s text, so that different versions would have had to have existed; that Thutmose’s “star” arrived from the south, whereas Servius Auctus and Hephaestio located Typhon in the northern part of the sky; and that Thutmose’s “star” worked in Egypt’s favour against the people of Mitanni, whilst Typhon harmed the Ethiopians and Persians in Servius Auctus’ account and ‘shook Egypt’ according to John of Lydia. The latter two objections are not insuperable; it may be that the meteor appeared to the north from Egypt, but to the south from Mitanni, while John of Lydia unhesitatingly limited Typhon’s origin to the south, in contrast to all other comet types. Noteworthy, too, is that only John of Lydia portrayed Typhon as adversarial to Egypt, Pliny and Servius Auctus strictly speaking

claiming no more than that the Egyptians ‘experienced’ or ‘saw’ it. Regardless, the object of this paper is not to insist that the enigmatic ‘king Typhon’ was Thutmose III, but merely that the notion of a king nominally associated with an ominous celestial object, even a bolide, is not at all out of place in pre-Hellenistic Egypt. Pliny’s Typhon has a ring of ancient Egyptian truth to it.
The ‘evil star’
Recapitulating, it has been seen that the notion of an Exodus comet can be traced back no further than medieval Arabic astrological speculation at the very earliest, but that the ancient tradition of a comet Typhon bears the hallmarks of an authentic event in Egypt’s heyday, possibly the spectacular fall of a bolide in the time of Thutmose III. The balance of this paper will focus on a few dangling threads brought to bear on the subjects of Typhon and the Exodus by Velikovsky and others.
One loose end to tie up is the Hebrew legend of the star Rā‘ā (‘Evil’) accompanying the Israelite Exodus. Velikovsky mentioned it only in passing, misspelling the name of the star as ‘Ra’. [53] Cardona suspected that the legend encapsulated a memory of the comet known as Typhon to Pliny and his congeners. [54] Keith Mills demonstrated that Cardona had misconstrued a single source as two sources and countered that this star could not have been an ‘Exodus comet’ as, according to that very legend, it never actually materialised. [55] But did he give Cardona’s suggestion a fair hearing? Has the legend been given too short shrift?
As before, there is much to disentangle. That Rockenbach was conscious of this legend is out of the question, not because Rockenbach created the Exodus comet by muddling up his editing, as Keith Mills saw it, but because his sources have now been confidently identified as Grau, Schinbain and possibly Bachmann and Sturm. Versed though 17th-century European scholars were in Hebrew, sometimes even in the Talmūd, they were not as a rule au courant with post-Talmūdic haggādā (‘folklore’). And contrary to Keith Mills’ claim, Cardona did not deem it likely that Rockenbach had knowingly used the legend of Rā‘ā as a source.
A pivotal question is the legend’s age. That the rabbis fabricated it out of whole cloth, or rather a scroll, is a possibility suggested by the fact that it appeared as a learned commentary on this single verse from Exodus: ‘Yahwę
̄
had better be with you when I let you and your little ones go! Beware, for evil is ahead of you.’ [56] With these sarcastic words, the pharaoh addressed Moses and Aaron upon being threatened with the plague of locusts. The word translated as “evil” is rā‘ā and it was this that some anonymous rabbis expounded as a reference to a star. [57] According to the Midraš Šīr haŠīrīm (Midraš on the Song of Songs), apparently redacted in the 11th century AD, Moses received this response just when he had announced the plague of locusts:
He [sc. Pharaoh] said to him, ‘I see through my astrology a star rising to meet you, and its name is Ra‘a, and it is a sign of blood and killing. [58]
This midraš was cited by distinguished authorities. For example, the French rabbi Solomon ben Isaac alias Rashi (10401105) wrote: “And I have heard a Midrashic interpretation: There is a certain star whose name is ָרעָה (evil). Pharaoh said to them, ‘I see by my astrology that star rising towards you in the desert, and it is a sign of blood(shed) and slaughter.’” [59] And the Spanish-Jewish commentator and philosopher Abraham ibn Ezra (c1090-c1167) explained in a comment on Exodus 32. 12:
The meaning of be-ra‘a hotzi’am (for evil did He bring them forth) is, as our ancients hint, that they went out of Egypt under a star called ra (evil). [60]
Based on a collocation of Exodus 10. 10; 32. 12 and Joshua 5. 9, some of these Haggadists deduced that the danger of the star was still impending at the time when the Israelites worshipped the golden calf and Moses interceded on their behalf with God, but that it was finally averted when God commuted the promised bloodshed from a massacre into Joshua’s circumcision of the Israelites at Gilgal. Only then “that ridicule was removed; for the mixed multitude that went up with them [from Egypt] were still taunting them.” [61] Rashi, in his commentary on Joshua, credited Moshe ha-Darshan (11th century AD) of Narbonne (France) with this interpretation.
By the modern standard of logic, this ingenious manner of exegesis really comes down more to ‘isegesis’, that is to say, reading ideas into the text with complete disregard to original, historical context. [62] The enunciations of the rabbis were often more akin to hypotheses in the Popperian sense of wild speculation, restrained only by the requirement of providing a link – however tenuous – with sacred writ, or at least of not contradicting that writ. Still, the rabbis also had a way of communicating genuine folklore in a format suggesting its direct derivation from one or another line in the sacred scriptures. In such cases, the feebleness of the link with the Bible does not diminish the value of the tradition.
Remarkably, some elements in this and related versions of the legend could be understood as references to the Egyptian god Set. To the Egyptian mind, of course, Set was the embodiment of evil. Furthermore, some midrašīm which make no mention of the star do refer to the flight of Egypt’s ‘guardian angel’ or ‘prince’ (śar). According to these, the Egyptians

hoped that this entity would confront Israel at Baal Saphon (Bá‘al-Ṣǝpon), a town at Egypt’s frontier just before the Red Sea where – as also indicated by the name – the syncretistic cult of Baal-Set was well established. [63] Thus the Midraš Rabbā on Exodus (11th or 12th century AD):
All the idols of the world perished then, except their Baal-Zephon. ... Then the Prince of Egypt came down to destroy them ... It does not say Pharaoh pursued after them but ‘Egypt’; this means their Prince. [64]
... when Pharaoh and the Egyptians began to pursue them, they raised their eyes heavenwards and saw the guardian angel of Egypt hovering in the air and became sore afraid ... the name of their guardian angel was Mizraim, and God does not cast down a nation before He destroys their guardian angel first. ... ‘Mizraim’ was the name of Pharaoh’s guardian angel, and he it was who was winging his flight in pursuit after them; before God drowned the Egyptians in the sea, He first drowned their guardian angel ... [65]
‘Mizraim’, or rather Miṣráyim, means ‘Egypt’. In two much older texts which are closely related to each other, the pharaoh pauses his hot pursuit of the Israelites to make obeisance to Baal Saphon at the location of that name, expecting that god to harry the escapees:
Baal-zephon alone was left of all the deities, to mislead the minds of the Egyptians. ... When Pharaoh saw the Israelites encamping by the sea, he said: ‘Baal-zephon approves of my decision. I had planned to destroy them in water and now Baal-zephon approves of my decision to destroy them in water.’ He then began to sacrifice, offer incense and libations and to prostrate himself to his idol. [66]
Baal-zephon remained for them, of all the [Egyptian idolatrous] gods, in order to entice the hearts of the Egyptians. ... When Pharaoh saw Baal-zephon, he rejoiced, saying, ‘Baal-zephon agrees with my decree. I said to drown them in water, [and] Baal-zephon agrees with my decree to drown them in water!’ He began [to prepare] an altar and incense before his idol. [67]
Making no further mention of Baal Saphon, both texts go on to describe the downfall of Egypt’s tutelary angel:
As soon as the Israelites saw the guardian angel of the Egyptian kingdom falling down into the sea, they began to render praise. In this sense it is said: (ramah) ‘hath He thrown down’ from on high. And you also find that in the future the Holy One, blessed be He, will punish the kingdoms only after He has first punished their guardian angels ... [68]
When Israel saw that the guardian angel of Egypt had fallen, they began to give praise before Him. Thus it is said, ‘... He has hurled (into the sea)’ ... And thus you find that God does not exact punishment from kingdoms until their guardian angels first fall. [69]
In the first text, the term translated loosely as “the guardian angel of the Egyptian kingdom” is śārāh šęl malkūt (‘the prince of the kingdom’); in the second, “the guardian angel of Egypt” is śārāh šęl miṣráyim (‘the prince of Egypt’). [70] The drowning of the śārāh šęl miṣráyim is also mentioned in another comparatively early commentary: “That is, He saw the guardian angel of Egypt falling. You find that the Holy One, blessed be He, will exact retribution from nations in the future only after He has punished their guardian angels ...” [71] And a midraš of the early 11th century AD well known for its elaborate angelology identifies this “tutelary Angel of the Egyptians” (śar šęl miṣráyim) by the name ‘Uzzā and features him disputing with the archangel Michael to return Israel to Egypt for it to remain in bondage there for some more centuries. [72] This tale is also told in a different midraš of the same century. [73] Bringing the argument full circle, yet another text from this period pithily annotates the verse from Exodus in which the pharaoh announces Israel’s meeting with Rā‘ā with the words: ‘This is Baal Saphon ...’ [74]
The star Rā‘ā, the guardian angel ‘Egypt’ or ‘Uzzā and the god Baal Saphon all appear to be different expressions of the same extraordinary aerial entity intimidating but ultimately not damaging the Israelites as they flee from Egypt. To the extent that the book Exodus itself mentions an “angel of God” (mal’ak hā’ĕlohīm) defending Israel and apparently in charge of the pillar of cloud and fire, [75] the belief that a similar spirit would have been in Egypt’s service is not farfetched and may well reach back to antiquity. [76]
Then again, scholars have acknowledged that the threat of rā‘ā in Exodus 10. 10 was “Pharaoh’s Pun” – a double entendre connoting the sun god Ra or Re in Egyptian and ‘evil’ in Hebrew. [77] Put differently, “rabbinic interpretation claimed that the god Ra‘ persecuted the Israelites during the Exodus.” [78] Or: “Pharaoh mocks the Israelites, telling them that their God had better come to their assistance, because in the desert they would be facing his god Re‘, the hot desert sun, who would burn them to death.” [79] As if to discredit the commination uttered by the pharaoh, the two plagues following it – the locusts and darkness – both involved diminution of sunlight, while the next and last plague struck at midnight, again underscoring Ra’s weakness. The way the arrival of the locusts is described in Exodus is atypical in Hebrew idiom and is exposed as a play on the winged Egyptian expression jr.t r‘ (‘eye of Ra’):
And they covered the eye of the whole earth and the earth was darkened ... [80]

The more common expression is ‘on the face of the (whole) earth’ (‘al-pǝnē [kŏl-]hā’ā́ ręṣ). By changing the bodily metaphor to the eye, the author subtly evoked the image of the Egyptian sun god shamefully obscured, along with the earth. [81] This suspicion of a solar allusion receives support from the Targūm Onqelos (early 2nd century AD), in which ‘eye of the whole earth’ is rendered as ‘eye of the sun of the whole earth’ (‘ēn šimšā dǝ-kŏl ’ar‘ā), [82] at the further expense of clarity. [83] “Thus, the terms ‘evil eye’ or ‘evil’ in some instances refers [sic] to the Egyptian sun-god.” [84]
In short, the star ‘Evil’ can hardly be divorced from the ‘eye of Ra’. What the scholars cited above appear to have missed in this context is that the ‘eye of Ra’ could be more than a circumlocution for the sun itself. [85] As is well illustrated in the famous Egyptian myth of The Destruction of Mankind, the eye could be conceived as a distinct physical entity emanating from the sun god, female in gender and capable of bringing the world to ruin. There is every chance that Egypt’s king, whether the incident was historical or not, would have wished for the ‘eye of Ra’ to wreak such havoc upon the Hebrews as it had done to humanity in mythical times. And whilst the astronomical identity of this ‘evil eye’ remains contentious, it would be far from surprising if the tradition at least as embedded in The Destruction of Mankind incorporated the memory of a deleterious fireball or comet, the latter possibly in the capacity of morning or evening star. [86] On the Hebrew side and then only in post-Talmūdic sources, Rā‘ā was only specified as a ‘star’ (kōkāb), but the imprecision of premodern astronomical terminology would not forbid a cometary or meteoric interpretation. It is not preposterous to imagine that an ancient intimation of the comet-like ‘eye of Ra’ evolved in medieval rabbinical tradition into the idea of an Egyptian guardian angel or protective star. Even Set may still have had a rôle, in his aspect as a deity “who so excellently protects Re” and “might be interpreted as the violent aspect of Re.” [87] For what it is worth, the Egyptians of the late 3rd millennium BC apparently saw no contradiction in the notion of the eye of Horus endowed with the strength of Set: “Pepi’s strength is Seth the Ombite’s strength. ... Pepi is the eye of Horus that is powerful against people and forceful against the gods.” [88]
From the medieval legend in which Moses pleads for Israel in the desert, Keith Mills inferred – as hinted above – that the star Rā‘ā “never actually manifested to trouble the Israelites or anyone else”. [89] This claim is quite premature, to be sure. The legend of the flight and drowning of the ‘prince of Egypt’, not considered by Keith Mills, contravenes it, but even going by the texts mentioning only the star Rā‘ā it has not remotely been demonstrated from the sources that no such object manifested at all.
It must be remembered that prior to the mid-16th century, no one – or at least no scientist – thought of comets as ‘proximate causes’, doing harm in direct, causal terms of physical contact; rather like aurorae and haloes, comets were solely baleful signs, unrelated to meteorites, whose terror resided in their astrological property of portending calamities, but the exact mechanism by which they could foreshadow or bring about the cataclysms remained mystical. The closest some had come to a causal theory, from the early 13th century onward, was to treat comets as ‘barometers’ symptomatic of the same physical causes which eventually produce the effects on Earth. [90] In other words, medieval comet theories were exclusively uniformitarian, the comets not being directly responsible for the expected catastrophes on Earth, and even in the modern period cosmic catastrophism was always consigned to the fringes of officially endorsed views. Thus it is that the Jewish legend introduces the pharaoh as predicting trouble based on astrology.
Such foretold disasters could at times be forestalled. Accordingly, it is conceivable that Egypt’s king was pointing to an actual comet, if not a bolide, as he uttered his warning and – in the case of a comet – even that this object was still looming when Moses interceded for the Israelites at Sinai, but that it never came to cripple the migrants in its unfathomable way. Assuming that there was some historical truth to the legendary material examined above, it would corroborate the impression that a transient astronomical object inspired fear, but ultimately proved benign to Israel. In itself, it has not even been ruled out that the column of cloud and fire was a comet, as Velikovsky supposed it to be, albeit Rockenbach would not have thought in such terms and the comet would be incompatible with Pliny’s Typhon and the star Rā‘ā, which latter was perceived as a force antagonistic to Israel.
To detect the ‘eye of Ra’ in subtle word play in Exodus or even the legend of the star ‘Evil’ is still a far cry from a fullblown catastrophist plot. Adventurous minds may like to run further with some of the information discussed above and ponder whether the angel’s drowning in the Red Sea could be a veiled reference to a cosmic impact. Those of a Velikovskian bent might seize upon the Egyptian association of Set with the planet Mercury or the pre-Islāmic Arabian or Syrian identification of ‘Uzzā as the morning star. [91] However, all such intriguing scenarios will probably remain flights of fancy. The Jewish descriptions of Rā‘ā, sparse and devoid of detail as they are, are as incompatible with a planetary identity as are the classical accounts of Typhon, and the chronological gap between them and the planetary characterisations of Set and ‘Uzzā is almost insurmountable. Although the rabbinical opinions regarding the ‘evil star of the Exodus’ and the intervention of Egypt’s guardian angel are fully consistent with the Biblical tradition and even with the classical comet Typhon, they are plainly not in evidence prior to the 5th century AD at the very earliest; as ‘Reifications’ of a simple pun, they are perhaps hardly more than a Jewish precursor to the Protestant chain of claims commencing with Milich. There is no trace of the star Rā‘ā in Islāmic legends of the Exodus either. In them, the angels Gabriel and Michael lure the pharaoh and his host into the Red Sea, but are not even located in the air as they do so. [92]



Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:3 33
Certainly, as the Jewish-American rabbi Samuel Rosenblatt (1902-1983) advised, it has never been proven that “the rabbis of the Talmud and the Midrash may not have been in possession of ancient traditions going back beyond their own age which throw light on passages of Sacred Writ that have long been misunderstood.” [93] That much is beyond cavil, but even Rosenblatt’s minimal hypothesis, that some rabbis of the 1st millennium AD interpreted the word rā‘ā in the passage at hand as the name of the god Ra, [94] remains conjectural; the rabbis’ characterisation of Rā‘ā as a ‘star’ unrelated to the sun and in the purview of astrology shows how little, if anything, then survived of an originally solar tradition of which even Onqelos retained only a faint awareness.
Granting the historicity of the Exodus tradition, the use of ‘Rā‘ā’ by the author of Exodus as a pun on the sun god Ra, signalling the king’s wish for the detached eye of Ra to discipline the Hebrews, is perhaps the most one can ever hope to make with some confidence of Velikovsky’s ‘Exodus comet’, with or without a connection with Set-Typhon. That anything out of the ordinary was actually seen in the firmament, other than perhaps the column of cloud and fire, cannot at all be inferred from the earlier sources – and the column was realistically rather the plume of a massive Plinian eruption, a tremendous volcanic event whose tectonic and atmospheric accompaniments could also shed light on most associated phenomena, such as the ten plagues and the parting of the Red Sea. [95]
The Catacomb Star
Another suggested clue to the concept of an Exodus comet is afforded by a palaeo-Christian wall painting in chamber O of a catacomb beneath Via Latina, Rome, dated to the mid-4th century AD and discovered in 1955 (fig. 5). In this work of art, a conspicuous eight-pointed star in a roseate sky irradiates the scene of the Egyptians chasing the Israelites as they cross the Red Sea. [96] The motif is practically unparallelled in Christian art. [97] The original investigator dismissed the idea that the pink sky represented the Biblical column of cloud and fire. [98]
A committed Velikovskian, the American politicologist Charles Raspil staked his claim on the star being Velikovsky’s incandescent comet Venus. [99] Taking a cue from Raspil but rejecting any involvement of Venus, Cardona proposed that the figure harked back to a “widespread” but nonetheless non-Biblical tradition of a special celestial object coinciding with the Exodus, such as Rā‘ā. [100] The idea is certainly more compelling than some alternatives. For example, it could be supposed that the star was the star-sceptre rising out of Israel and symbolic of a future king, as divined by Balaam. [101] The drawback to that is that Balaam acted well after the Exodus, so the painting would have to have been anachronistic. Was the scene of the crossing of the Red Sea, then, a visual reference to Constantine the Great’s battle at the Milvian Bridge in AD 312, when a marvellous cross appeared in the sky over the combattants? [102] This is a fair and interesting proposition, but it seems contrived considering that nothing else in the image suggests a deeper meaning

and all other paintings in the catacomb were straightforward illustrations of Biblical episodes; [103] besides, the apparition seen over the Milvian Bridge was solar and cruciform, not stellar.
Could it be that the star represented the Rā‘ā of Jewish speculation, regardless of the legend’s historicity? The upshot of that would be that the rabbinical interpretation of Exodus 10. 10 as a star existed as early as the 4th century AD and was known to the decorator at Via Latina. On different grounds, art historians have, in fact, contemplated Jewish influence on the art in this catacomb. [104] As an offshoot of the old Hebrew faith and close kin to Judaism, Christianity counted many Jews among its early converts and it may be that the catacomb in question was used by a community of Jewish Christians. The same catacomb also housed several paintings with subjects from Graeco-Roman mythology, so a fairly relaxed outlook on Christian theology could be indicated. This interpretation of the painting is a double-edged sword, however, for – as Cardona conceded – the depicted object, like Rā‘ā, is a star and not a comet. While it is true that ancient scientists such as Pliny set up categories of tailless comets, such as the disceus mentioned earlier and also the “Tub-star” (pitheus), [105] the artistic convention would presumably still have been to portray a comet with a tail.
Perhaps the correct explanation is far simpler. The coexistence of Christian and classical art could simply mean that adherents to both religions were members of the same family, sharing a catacomb in which the deceased received art corresponding to their individual faith. [106] And looking at Exodus 14. 19-20, the painter of the Crossing of the Red Sea could have added the star to indicate that the crossing took place by night, maybe as a representation of the normal morning star, or as a way of depicting the ‘angel’ standing between the Israelite and Egyptian sides. Yet even if the star in the catacomb turned out to signify Rā‘ā, this would still not by a long stretch constitute evidence that the legend was rooted in truth.
Byzantine Reflections
The star ‘Evil’ may illuminate a further mystery which has occasionally been discussed in connection with an Exodus comet. [107] In 1679, the French diplomat and Orientalist Édouard de la Croix (c1640-1704), then a secretary at the embassy in Istanbul, reported on the doings of Moses Suriel, Saraval or Serviel in the city in 1666. Suriel was a young Qabbālist rabbi from Bursa defending the cause of the Ottoman Messiah claimant Sabbatai Zevi (1626-1676):
Moses Suriel acquired such a great reputation among the Jews that they filled his house every day, where he lectured them, & gave them rules of virtue; he based his doctrine on a comet which was seen at that time, convincing the people that a similar sign had appeared in the sky at the time of their deliverance from Egypt, that Jacob’s dream was fulfilled, that the angels descended from heaven, & took possession of human bodies, filling the earth with the knowledge of the Lord, according to Isaiah in chap. II. [108]
The celestial body to which Suriel was pointing was undoubtedly the Great Comet of 1664-1665. Whence came his knowledge of a similar object – perhaps not necessarily a comet – attending the Exodus? Short of confabulation and the low likelihood that he had read a Lutheran cometographer, he could very well have had the legend of the star ‘Evil’ in mind. Note that his statement leaves it unclear whether the celestial apparition would have been a deterrent or a facilitator of the Exodus, a bad or a good omen. The Yalqūṭ Rǝ’ubēnī (Reuben’s Anthology) was a collection of midrašīm gathered by the Czech-Jewish rabbi Reuben Höschke Kohen (1605-1673) and first printed at Prague in 1660. Containing elements of the legends of ‘Uzzā, the patron of Egypt, and probably also the star Rā‘ā, it could easily have been the sole foundation of Suriel’s claim. Even if this particular opus was not accessible to Suriel, he would have learned the legend through other texts.
Yet hereby hangs a further tale. Suriel did not exactly blaze a trail, as there had been a precedent for his proclamation in Istanbul, involving another Jew. The reader will recall that the Great Comet of 1577, which had inspired Schinbain and Grau to compose their cometographies, was declared to have appeared earlier on the occasions of the overturning of Sodom and Gomorrah and the Hebrew Exodus by the Syrian Taqī al-Dīn and David ben Shushan of Thessalonica. Suriel could well have been aware of that history. On what ground would the Istanbul astrologers have made their extravagant claim? As argued earlier, they could have been thinking of the comet al-Kayd mentioned in such works as the Book of Curiosities. Because of ben Shushan’s involvement, chances are, again, that the rabbinical teaching of the star Rā‘ā also played a part. Rā‘ā is never associated with the destruction of the cities of the plain of the Dead Sea. Speculating freely, perhaps al-Dīn adduced a text linking al-Kayd with the destructions of ‘Ād, Thamud and Madyan, and this triggered ben Shushan to associate the first two with the annihilation of Sodom and Gomorrah and the third with the ten plagues of Egypt, supposing that al-Kayd’s appearance at that time could have been enshrined in the legend of Rā‘ā.
Conclusion
Velikovsky was naïve in enlisting an early 17th-century author to his cause without an inkling of sensitivity for the complex history of ideas. His blithe belief that Rockenbach was part of a continuous chain of reliable tradition reaching all the way back to the time of Moses is now overturned; Rockenbach’s elusive sources have been identified and all leads therein to an Exodus comet, whether identical with Typhon or not, have been exposed as smoke and mirrors. It is



Chronology & Catastrophism REVIEW 2020:3 35
theoretically possible that the exegetical tradition of the star Rā‘ā partly fuelled ben Shushan’s pontifications regarding the comet of 1577 and that these reached Rockenbach through the writings of Bachmann, Sturm and just possibly also Wolf or Kraus. In that case, even the legend of Rā‘ā would indirectly have been one of Rockenbach’s sources for the comet Typhon. This hypothesis would not, however, vindicate Cardona’s hunch in any degree, as it gravitates towards the opposite position of that taken by Cardona by arguing that the star Rā‘ā was represented among Rockenbach’s sources, but was not an actual historical comet at the time of the Exodus. It looks like the legend was no more than an imaginative excrescence of a garbled memory that there was something astral about the pharaoh’s warning to Moses, the original allusion to the eye of Ra having been forgotten. The strange natural phenomena associated with the Exodus, if essentially real, are perhaps fully explicable in volcanic and seismic terms.
Yet not all is lost; the above is only the most parsimonious interpretation fitting all the facts. Certainty is not to be had and, of course, Typhon stands unperturbed as a formidable celestial power with every chance of having had roots in actual ancient history. So, did a menacing object traverse the heavens as the Israelites poured out of Egypt? Although the odds are against it, it is still up in the air.

57. The following discussion relies as much as possible on primary sources. Although it is often convenient and more dramatic to use L. Ginzberg’s epic collection for access to Jewish legends, as Velikovsky, Cardona, Keith Mills and others did, one runs the risk of studying words and ideas which are not as such attested anywhere. This is because Ginzberg’s presentation, however faithful to the spirit of the sources, is a paraphrase resulting from an attempt to carefully interweave widely scattered sources into a single chronologically arranged narrative. For serious research, reliance on Ginzberg is as misguided as using Robert Graves’ compendium for Greek myth or indeed any encyclopedia for any subject. In this case, Ginzberg’s paraphrases are in The Legends of the Jews, vol. 2: Bible Times and Characters from Joseph to the Exodus, tr. H.

So, too, ‘the eye of the earth’ is rendered as ‘the eye of the sun of the earth’ in 10. 5, yet in 10. 10 Onqelos certainly saw no solar implication of rā‘ā (pp. 111 and 111-112 n. 15). 83. Rendsburg, op. cit. (2016); (1990), pp. 16-17. Drazin (op. cit., pp. 110, 112, cf. 111 n. 8) tried to remedy the confusion by translating “the sight of the sun over the (entire) earth”, but missed the pun on Ra. 84. Ulmer, op. cit., p. 185. Ulmer (pp. 185-186) went on to discuss rabbinical references to naḥaš ra‘ (‘evil snake’ or ‘snake of Ra’), which very likely alluded to the symbolism of the uraeus on the pharaoh’s headdress. 85. Elsewhere (‘The Divine Eye in Ancient Egypt and in the Midrashic Interpretation of Formative Judaism’, Journal of Religion and Society 5, 2003, p. 4), R. B. Kern Ulmer had in fact written about the “detached, separate eye”, which the sun god could dispatch with “the task to destroy those Egyptians that have committed evil deeds against the sun god.” However, she did not relate this to the Exodus passage scrutinised here.
