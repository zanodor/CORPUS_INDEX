PREFACE.
THE story of the world's worship is a story of absorbing interest.
The odd and the curious, the enchanting and the revolting are each factors of heathen devotion. We well remember with what exhaustless interest we looked in childhood at strange pictures of idols and temples, and listened to the reading of tales about the heathen. When the celebrated Dr. Alexander Duff was a little boy, his father was accustomed on Sabbath afternoons to show him pictures of idols, and to explain their histories. So vividly did the pictures and their stories impress the boy, that when he became a man he left Scotland and went to labor for the heathen of India. The subject is indeed intensely interesting. Every nation has its God, or gods, and its corresponding forms of worship. Nothing lies
so close to the heart of mankind as its religious faith. Religion in some form is interwoven with the entire fabric of human history. It concerns man's dearest pleasures, his fondest hopes, and his highest aspirations. Man must worship. It is part of his nature to worship. Hence, from the most civilized European to the half-civilized Chinaman, and evendown to tlie degraded Hottentot; in all stages of man's existence, among all races and classes, some form of worship is found. Nothing surely can mterest us more than the story of that faith in
which our fellow-creatures have lived and died.
It is because the author believes that the subject of false gods and idol worship is so interesting, and because he liopes to furnish some much-needed information on this topic, that he has undertaken the present work. There is no one book that covers tliis ground. There are many volumes covering various phases of the religious systems of heathendom, but there is not one that deals comprehensively with all religions, extinct or existing, except indeed it be those suited only to students and to learned men. * The aim in this volume is to present the subject in a popular style, suited to the average reader of our land. It is proposed to make a



VI PREFACE.
book to be read in the family and by the fireside. The very best works of the most thorough students of the non-Christian religious systems have been consulted, and the author has freely availed him
self of the results of their labors. If due acknowledgment is not always made of the aid thus received, it is because he deemed it best not to multiply references and because he has so frequently found it necessary to translate scholastic and technical phrases used by these authors into language familiar to the general reader. Among those whose works the author has consulted are. Max Miiller and Hardwicke on Comparative Mythology; Wilkinson on the Ancient Egyptians; Lenormant on Assyria and Babylon; Haug on the Parsees; Monier Williams on Hinduism; Rhys-Davids, and Barthelemy St. Hilaire on Buddhism, and Edwin Arnold's paraphrase of Buddha's life in his "Light of Asia;" Humboldt on Central America; Schoolcraft on the American Indians ; Wyatt Gill and Lord Grey on the Pacific Islands; Legge, Edkins and S. Wells Williams on the Chinese; Griffis and Sir Edward Reed on Japan ; and Stanley and Livingstone on Africa. Beside these he has derived great help from " The Tour of the World with General Grant," and Dr. H. M. Field's "From Egypt to Japan." In addition he has consulted quite a host of other authors 'in works of travel, and in the translations of various sacred books. In all parts of his work the author has sought to present definite information, carefully arranged, truthfully told, and clearly and interestingly stated. He has aimed to show the origin, development and spread of each non-Christian religious system; and to give an account of their gods and goddesses, temples, shrines, idols, sacred places, superstitious customs, legends, myths, domestic worship and
the innumerable peculiarities of their daily religious life.
The work is fully illustrated by accurate, and in many cases, expensive engravings. The book is not made merely to sell. Sensational statements and mere padding have been neither added nor borrowed. The author has not drawn upon his imagination in the least. He has told a story which, though sometimes stranger than fiction, is nevertheless solid fact and not baseless fancy. Let it be remembered that this is a pioneer work. The author has had to blaze his pathway through a trackless forest. He has had no guide. He sincerely hopes that by its perusal his readers will be led to an increased appreciation of the infinite superiority of Christianity to all other re
ligions; and that they may find a deepened interest in the welfare of vhe heathen world.



PREFACE. yjj
It has been the purpose of the author and the publishers to place the subject-matter of this volume within the ready reach of all who consult it. An exhaustive Table of Contents has been given therefore, in which the chapter titles and all the sub-headings of the chapters will be found. A full index of the proper names and principal topics of the book is also added, by means of which it is believed any desired subject treated in the volume can readily be found. By such means as these the book has been made as complete and as useful as patient labor can make it. Thanks are specially due to Professor Isaac H. Hall, who not only gave
careful consideration to the subjects specially under his care, but who in addition read all the MS., and gave the benefit of his extended learning and excellent judgment at every point. To Professor S. Wells Williams also, the author desires to make public acknowledgment. Though burdened with many onerous duties, yet he gave his closest attention to the chapters on those much misunderstood nations, China and Japan, and from the rich stores of his own extensive and welldigested knowledge, he made such suggestions as proved of inesti
mable value. To the Publishers, who were ever ready to meet the author's largest desires, his thanks are especially due. Without such generous support the volume must have fallen far below its present excellenc. Indeed, all concerned in the production of the book have proved themselves true helpers, to whom author and readers alike will be largely iadebted. . F. S. Dobbins.

THE WORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. ,,
CHAPTER I.
THE world's first WORSHIP.
I have laid it down as an invariable maxim constantly to follow his
torical tradition, and to hold fast by that clew, even when many
things, in the testimony and declarations of tradition, appear strange and almost inexplicable, or at least enigmatical ; for so soon in the
investigation of ancient history as we let slip that Ariadne's thread
we can find no outlet from the labyrinth of fanciful theories, and the
chaos of clashing opinions. —F. Von Schlegel.
THERE are many systems of worship in the world.
Some of these are Hmited to single nations, others extend themselves over different nations, and in
history we read of certain religions which no longer exist.
For instance—of those systems limited to a nation, there
is the worship of ancestors, as taught by Confucius, in China ; the worship of the idol gods Brahma, Vishnu and Siva, and a multitude of other gods, more numerous
than their worshipers, in India ; and Shintoism, the nature
worship of Japan. Of those which have extended to
other lands, there is the worship of the hero-saint, Gautama Buddha, in all southern and eastern Asia ; and Mohammedanism, the fierce opponent of idolatry, and the system of the prophet Mohammed, in India, Turkey,
Egypt and in China. Of the dead religions, there are
those of Egypt, Assyria, Greece and Rome. These are
but a few of the many forms of worship that we find in
glancing over the world's history, or in looking at its
present condition. There are wide differences between



^A EHRUKS CHAINS.
these systems of worship and also many resemblances among them. Where did these systems all come from ? Where and
how did they start? They differ very materially one from another. Some worship one God and have no
idols, others worship millions of gods and have multi
tudes of idols. Their temples are of different styles.
Their sacred books and ceremonies are extremely varied.
Can they have started from one source, or did each start
independently of the rest?
TESTIMONY OF AN OLD RECORD AND OF LANGUAGE.
How shall we find out about this ? We have one rec
ord that will help us and upon which we can depend.
This is the oldest history of mankind. There were a
great many of these histories written later, but for no
one of them is there a tenth part of the evidence as to
its being genuine, which there is for this one old record.
It has been tested in every possible way and no flaw has yet been found. Ancient monuments and their inscrip
tions, the oldest traditions of the most ancient peoples,
all confirm its statements. But these monuments and
the written histories of nations go back but a few thou
sand years, and this one record is older than they all. So
traditions only remain to be compared with it. No, there
is one thing left that is related to tradition. It is lan
guage. Those who have studied the languages of the world and compared them with each other have something to say, and it is this : All languages can be grouped into
families or classes of speech, and all these families are
seen to have started from one common source. This,
too, agrees with the story of that older record. That tells how God made first a man and then a woman, how that



THE WORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. ,
they were very good at the outset, but soon became bad.
It goes on to tell how their children were very wicked, and how God punished them by sending a great flood of waters which destroyed all but one family. Then this
family increased, and they too became wicked. They
finally planned to build an immense tower, so, perhaps, that they should not be drowned again in a flood ; at any
rate, if this was not the reason, it was for some other
wicked purpose that they builded, God was angry with
their wickedness, and to stop their building confused their language. They had all spoken the same language before, but now some spoke one and some an
other. Just here other histories begin, and the stories
in these and in the record we have referred to, go on
very much alike. But the traditions, which are older
than the histories, agree with the record, as we shall see
in a future chapter. This record is the Bible, especially
the first part of the Book of Genesis. So here is found one answer to our question,

all religions grew out
of one original system of worship.
ANOTHER WITNESS : COMPARATIVE RELIGION.
There is still another way to get an answer. Place
the religions side by side, study their principles, examine
their legends, and see if, after all, there are not resem
blances beneath the surface. Let us strip them of those
things which are the additions of a later day, and of those
things which the peculiar conditions of their countries,
climates and languages have added. Take for instance
their legends or household stories. Some of these tra
ditions are written in the inscriptions on the ancient
monuments of Egypt, or especially of Babylonia, or in
the sacred books and histories of the older nations ; others have been handed down by word of mouth. It was long



36 EJiHOR'S CHAINS.
after these legends were old, that even neighboring
nations held any communications with each other. It
had been just as if a great high wall was built around
each nation—a wall without gates. So they could not
have told these stories to each other. Then, too, some
of these stories are told by nations thousands of miles
apart.
The truth certainly is that before the several branches
of the race separated from their common home, perhaps
on the table-lands of Bactria, they had many legends, nur
sery tales and peculiar stories in common. As they
moved to the colder North, or to the warmer South, they
carried these tales with them. In course of time these came to be somewhat altered. This change was in the
dressing rather than in the tales themselves. Hence we
find among the Egyptians, Hindoos, Greeks, Germans,
Spaniards, Norsemen, stories which are so much alike
that it is certain that they had a common origin. Take,
for instance, the story of the Master Thief of the Norse
men, and compare it with the same story as told by other
nations, and we are led to the conclusion that it is part
of a stock of nursery tales which were told before the
dispersion. Let us remember that many collections of stories were not originated by the men whose names
they bear, but that these men simply gathered together
legends and tales which they found already existing among the people. Thus "Grimm's Household Tales" is
a collection of old German fireside stories. "The Arabian Night's Entertainment," the "Hindoo Hitopadesa," "Da
sent's Popular Tales of the Norse," and " Old Deccan
Days," are collections of the same sort. It will repay us
to attend at some length to the various versions of one of
these stories, which will serve to illustrate many others of
more momentous character.



THE WORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. ,-•
THE STORY OF THE MASTER THIEF.
In the Norse tale, the Master Thief is a farmer's
apprentice. In his country there is an order or society
of thieves, and the apprentice wishes to join them. The
thieves promise to admit him to their society provided
he can succeed in steaUng an ox from his master as the
master is driving three oxen, one by one, to market. It
must be done, the thieves say, without the master's^
knowledge, and without hurting him. The youth put a
silver-buckled shoe in his master's way as he traveled
along the road. The farmer admired the shoe but passed on without touching it, as an odd shoe would be of no
service to him. The thief cunningly picked up the shoe
and ran around by another path so as to come out
ahead of his master, and place the shoe in the farmer's
way again. This time he stopped, tied his ox to the fence,
and picking up the shoe before him, went back to find
its mate. The lad then stole the ox and took it away to
the thieves' council. But they want to try him still further,
and direct him to steal a second ox from his master, who
is again driving to market. Disguising himself the lad put a rope around his body under his arms and hung himself to a tree at the roadside. The farmer passed
on, barely noticing the lad. He was so much troubled
about the loss of his ox that he did not think of render
ing assistance. The lad then untied himself, and running by a roundabout way came out on the road ahead
of the farmer and hung himself as before. Again the farmer passed by unconcernedly. Again the thief hung
himself. This time the farmer thought himself bewitched,
and returned to see if the other two lads were still hanging. His second ox was now left tied up and the lad
then led it also away. The thieves then said that if he



,^ EJiHOK'S CHAINS.
would steal the third ox from the farmer, now on his
^uard against tricks, he should be their master. Going
into a piece of woods along the road, as his master was
passing by with the third ox, he imitated the bellowing
of oxen. The farmer now hurried away to catch his lost
cattle, leavine the third one to fall into the thief's hands.
The thieves thereupon took him into their council, but determined (as he shrewdly provoked them to do) to outdo the young thief, they went away to carry out their
plans. The lad then returned his master's oxen, and
carried off all the valuables and goods which the thieves had stored away. Soon after he married his master's
daug-hter. This story was told in Western Europe, probably long
before Herodotus heard the story of the Egyptian thief
and wrote it out, or before the Hindoo tale of Karpara and Gata was made known outside of India. The tale of the Forty Thieves in the Arabian Nights also bears a
close resemblance to these. The Spanish legend of the Poor Mason may have been borrowed from any one of
these. Compare the main points of these stories with
those of the tale of the Master Thief
THE STORY OF RHAMPSINITOS.
Rhampsinitos, an architect, built for the King of Egypt
a treasure-house with a secret entrance. This secret, at
his death, the architect told to his two sons. They there
upon helped themselves to the king's treasures. As the
king noticed how his treasures were gradually decreasing,
he placed a trap in the entrance to the treasure-house.
The younger brother was caught in the trap, and seeing
that he could not escape, he beg-gred his brother to cut off
his head so that the king might not know that the archi
tect had told the secret, and that the brother might not



THE WORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. ,«
get into trouble. So the king found the headless body,
and of course could not recognize the thief. But to find
out who he was, he had the body exposed in a public place, and ordered the guards to arrest any person who should mourn for the dead man. The mother saw and re
cognized the body, and threatened to tell the king, unless
the elder son should bring the body home. The son
then filled some skin bottles with wine, and loaded them
upon asses. As he rode by the guards, he slightly
loosened the mouth-string of the sacks, and the wine
began to run out. The guards, pretending to help him,
helped themselves to the wine. After tying up the skins,
the youth asks them to sit down and drink wine with him. They do so, and are soon overpowered by it, and
fall asleep. He then carried away the body. Soon after
he was married to the princess, for the king sought to
honor this Master Thief, and he was held to be the clev
erest man of the cleverest people.
THE STORY OF THE POOR MASON.
In the Spanish story of the Poor Mason a priest wished
liim to build a secret hiding-place for his treasure. In order that the mason might not know how to get at the
treasure, should he be so inclined, the priest blindfolded
Tiim from the time of leaving his own home till he arrived
at the treasure-house, and again blindfolded him on his
return. So the mason knew the secret of the priest's
hidden treasure, but did not know where the house was
In which it was secreted. The priest finally died. The
house was then said to be haunted. The landlord could
not find a tenant. At last he happened on the poor mason, and offered him the house rent free. As soon as
the mason entered it, he saw that it was the house where the wealth was stored, and where he had worked. He



40 ERROJi'S CHAINS.
kept the secret to himself, until like the Egyptian archi
tect, he told it on his death-bed to his son. In the story of Trophonius and Agamedes, which Pau
sanius tells, the two masons built the treasury of the
king, so that one stone in the wall could be removed from
the outside. The king found his wealth growing less,
and set a trap for the thief. Agamedes was caught and
Trophonius cut off his head. In the Hindoo story of two
brothers, Gata and Karpara, not only treasure is stolen
by means of a secret entrance to the king's palace, but
also the princess, the king's daughter. Karpara was
finally found out, was put to death, and as it was desired
to catch the other thief, his body was exposed. The guards were ordered to seize any one who might mourn the death of Karpara. The word "Karpara" means a gourd or melon. Gata, Karpara's brother, in order that he might mourn as Hindoos feel bound to do and yet not
be caught, loaded some asses with melons, and as he
passed the body of Karpara, contrives to have his load
slip off, crying, as the gourds fell to the ground and burst,
"Alas ! for my precious Karpara !" The guards supposed,.
of course, that he referred to his gourds, and so did not
arrest him. Afterwards they perceived the trick that had
been played upon them, and told it to the king. He then,
by royal proclamation, offered the princess in marriage
to the clever thief if he would but come and claim her.
STORY OF THE SHIFTY LAD.
The historian of ancient Scottish leg-ends records a
tale which resembles in many points the tales mentioned
above. In the Scottish story, the Shifty Lad goes
through his apprenticeship, not among a company of
thieves, but under the sole charge of the Black Rogue,
of whom he at last rid himself by getting him to try the



THE IVORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. >j
pleasant sensation of being hung by the neck. The
trick answers to that of the Norse thief, but the mode of
effecting it differs widely. Having disposed of his mas
ter, he engages himself to a carpenter, whom he per
suades to break into the king's storehouse. The advice
of the Seanagal, whom the king consults, is that a hogs
head of soft pitch be placed near the entrance. The
Wright, again making the venture, sinks into the pitch,
and the Shifty Lad, stepping in on his shoulders, takes
as much as he can carry, and then sweeping off his mas
ter's head, leaves the body in the hogshead. Again the
Seanagal is consulted, and his answer is "that they
should set the trunk aloft on the points of the spears of
the soldiers to be carried from town to town, to see if
they could find any one at all that would show sorrow
for it." As they pass by the Wright's house, his wife
screams, but the Shifty Lad cutting himself with an adze,
leads the captain of the guard to think that the cry was
caused by sorrow at his own hurt. The body is then by the king's order hung on a tree, the guard being ordered to seize any one who should venture to take it down.
The lad driving before him a horse loaded with two kegs
of whisky, approaches the soldiers, as though he wished to
pass them stealthily, and when they catch the horse's
bridle, he runs off leaving the men to drink themselves
to sleep, and then returning takes away the wright's
body. This exploit is followed by others which occur in
no other version ; but the final scene is a feast, at which,
according to the Seanagal's prediction, the Shifty Lad
asks the king's daughter to dance. The Seanagal upon
this puts a black mark upon him, but the lad, like Mor
giana in the story of "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves," discovering the mark, puts another on the Seanagal and
on twenty other men besides him. The king is then ad



42 AA'AcJA'\i' CHAINS.
vised to say that the man who had done all these tricks,
that had been so well done, must be exceedingly clever, and that if he would come forward and give himself up
he should have the princess for his wife. All the marked
men accordingly claim the prize; and the craft of the
Shifty Lad is once more called into practice, to secure
the maiden for himself From the comparison of these popular tales with each
other we can see their common origin. Nations so
widely separated as the Norsemen, Hindoos, Spaniards,
Egyptians and the early inhabitants of Scotland, could
not have borrowed these stories from each other. Their
resemblances—a thief of wonderful cunning, his suc
cesses and escapes, and final honor—all point to the fact
that they are but different versions of the same story. This one story could not have been communicated by
one nation to the others, and as the only way to account
for the resemblances we are shut up to believe that the
nations long ago all lived in one home, from which they
afterward separated to go to the different lands of their
final settlements.
When we add to this evidence, that from the sameness
in the ideas of God held by the different nations in their
descriptions of His power, and even in the very names by which they designated God, we are carried back to
the early worship of the race, and we see from all these
evidences that, originally, man worshiped one God. The
human race did not begin life on the earth as a savage,
or as a child, and was not developed from this condition
to a higher state of intelligence ; but man began life as
a full-formed, mature, intelligent creature. From this
high vantage ground he has descended, first, to the wor
ship of many gods, and later on, of idols. Such degeneration has often happened in the history



THE WORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. .,
of the world. The descendants of powerful nations
have, in the lapse of years, become far inferior to their
ancestors. For example, the ancient Egyptians have left
monuments whose construction baffles us. We cannot imagine how they have raised and posed the immense
stones, nor can we ascertain the purpose of many of
their buildings. We talk of "lost arts" and "lost civih
zations." We know that it has often happened that edu
cated colored people from the southern United States,
have sunk to the low level of the people of Africa when
they have returned to the land of their fathers. From
the Bible narrative, as well as from the most ancient tra
ditions of heathen nations, we learn that at the first, man
held close intercourse with God and that he held this
pure worship during many centuries. The traditions of
ancient nations confirm the Bible account of the high
position of man at the outset.
In the Avesta, the sacred book of the Parsees, who are
known also as fire-worshipers, we are told that the first
king, Jemshid, and his subjects, after living for a time in
the original home of the race of mankind, removed to a
secluded spot not far distant. Here, there "was neither
overbearing nor mean-spiritedness, neither stupidity nor
violence, neither poverty nor deceit, neither puniness nor
deformity, neither huge teeth nor bodies beyond the
usual measure. The inhabitants suffered no defilement
from the evil spirit. They dwelt among odoriferous trees
and golden pillars; these were the largest, best and
most beautiful on earth; they were themselves a tall and
beautiful race." The Mexicans tell of the "golden age
of Tezenco." The Peruvian tradition begins with the
story of the two children of the Sun, who established a
civilized country on the banks of Lake Titicaca. Hesiod
records the Greek tradition thus:



44 ERROJi'S CHAINS.
" The immortal gods, that tread the courts of heaven, First made a golden race of men. Like gods they lived, with happy, careless souls, From toil and pain exempt; nor on them crept Wretched old age, but all their life was passed In feasting, and their limbs no changes knew. Nouglit evil came them nigh; and when they died, 'Twas but as if they were overcome by sleep. All good things were their portion : the fat soil Bare them its fruits spontaneous, fruit ungrudged
And plentiful ; they, at their own sweet will, Pursued in peace the tasks that seemed them good.
Laden with blessings, rich in flocks, and dear To the great gods."
The Chinese and Hindoo traditions also point back
to the beginning of the history of the human race as a
time of happiness and perfection. In those early ages
man lived a long life, and so the early worship of the one
God could be handed down from aee to acre with scarce
a chance of change. Thus we are brought down to the
time of the Deluge. While there was a general tendency to evil on the part of all the descendants of Adam,
God preserved some pure characters, such as Enoch and
Noah, who kept the truth from utterly perishing from off
the earth. On account of the increasing wickedness of mankind, God sent the Deluge, which destroyed all the
race, Noah and his family alone excepted. This we learn not only from the Bible, but from Chinese, Hindoo, Egyptian, Greek and Mexican traditions. Soon after
this deluge, the descendants of Noah multiplied gready,
and on account of their wicked attempt to build the tower of Babel, God confused their language. Thus the
great dispersion of nadons was brought about, through
their inability to communicate with each other by means
of speech. They separated inevitably from each other.



THE WORLD'S FIRST WORSHIP. .^
EXODUS OF THE NATIONS.
Somewhere to the north of Persia, in the land of
Khiva, was probably the second cradle of the race. This
land is now the central meeting place of empires ; here,
Russia from the north, England, through India, from the south, and the European powers from the west are coming together. This was the point of departure whence
the nations started for their future homes. From the
three sons of Noah came the nations by whom the whole
earth was overspread. Let us keep in mind that Noah's
worship of God was pure, that he preserved the true
faith in Jehovah, that he handed this to his sons, and that the degeneration into the worship of many gods and
idols took place later in history. The religion of the
world was still one. Not that all men accepted it, for
many wickedly rebelled against it, but the knowledge of
the true God was too fresh in their minds for them to set
up other gods for themselves. Not only this, but while
they were all together, each new generation received in
struction from those who did worship God in the right
way. It was only when they were scattered and left solely
to their recollections of these teachings, that their religions began gradually to differfrom that which they had known
when together. Then, also, the peoples began to differ
from each other; then those who went to the cold north
or warmer south, to the isles of the sea or to inland
hills and valleys, gradually changed their habits of life
;and worship according to their surroundings. From
the miountains of Armenia, where Noah landed from
the ark, the streams of population poured forth to
all parts of the world; north-west to Europe, west to
Asia Minor, south-west to Egypt and Africa, south to
Arabia, south-east to Persia and India, and east to China.
3



46 ERROJ^'S CHAINS.
Of course, this was not the work of a day. It took ages-
for the nations to reach the more distant lands; ages for
them to become settled in their new homes ; ages for
them to people these lands densely. Hundreds of years,
after the deluge, some of the peoples who reached the
western shores of the Pacific Ocean, and who ventured
on its waters, were carried away on the stream whose
currents sweep to the north, then to the east, and thence
down again to the south. It has happened in the last.
few centuries that Malays and Japanese sailors have thus been swept away by the Kuro Shiwo (Black Stream).
Thus, in all probability, the continent of America was.
peopled. Thus the present Japanese nation originated
from the mixing of these Malays from south-eastern
Asia and the Ainos, the nation which had made its way
overland to Japan.
In the languages and traditions of these nations, even
after they were well settled, are to be found traces of
Monotheism. Not distinct and clear, it is true, for the
Polytheistic worship of after ages has destroyed to a
great extent these indications of the early worship of
one God, and yet in almost all systems of religion a su
preme place is given to some one Deity, who is above all
the others, and who is recognized as the ruler of all.

The fair humanities of old religion, The power, the beauty and the majesty. They had their haunts in dales or piny mountain, Or forest by slow stream, or pebbly spring. Or chasms and watery depths. Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
WE have seen that the first worship of the world
was of one God. We have watched the world in its processes of changing as the nations were separated from each other. We have found
that not long after the settlement of the nations in their
new lands the worship of many gods appeared, and with
this worship, or soon after it began, the worship of idols appeared also. The number of gods and their idols
multiplied rapidly, until they numbered hundreds of millions. There were gods of every name and shape ; gods
of heaven, earth, and hell ; gods of occupations and em
ployments ; gods of every living creature, and of many
inanimate things. Where did they come from ? Where and when did that great change occur, when man ceased
to worship one God and began to multiply his gods and
idols ? How did it come about ? What influences pro
duced the change ? Why was the world permitted to
wander so far from the truth ? All these, and a hundred
kindred questions come to us at this time. Can we
answer any of them ? The sources of information are






WHENCE CAME THE MANY GODS AND IDOLS? ^q
SOURCES OF INFORMATION.
The Vedas, the sacred books of the Hindus, are the
oldest existing sacred writings, excepting those from
which Moses compiled the earlier chapters of Genesis.
In these Vedas there is little of the confused mass of
mythological statements, gross superstitions and the hosts
of gods of later Brahminism. Here is presented a pic
ture of the simple nature-worship of the people of India
in their earhest history. Having been composed so soon
after the dispersion of the nations, or rather the hymns contained in it having been handed down by word of
mouth from generation to generation, it is a very valuable
source of information just here. Before the beginning of this century the Vedas were almost unknown to
European scholars. Since that time great attention has
been devoted to the subject, especially since Max Miiller
went to England to seek the aid of Englishmen, and more
particularly of the East India Company, in publishing his
translation of the Vedas. At present we can read them
for ourselves in tolerably accurate translations.
Until within a hundred years, there was no direct way
of learning of the faith, and manners, and customs of
ancient Persia. It was known that there was an author
itative record of the earliest Persian religion, a Bible of
the Parsees, but no European had ever read it. In 1754,
a young French student of Paris, chanced to see a few
lines of an ancient manuscript in an unknown language.
He at once determined to go to Persia, or India, whence
the manuscript had come, and to learn more about it. As
he could not secure the means for the journey, in any
other why, he enlisted as a private soldier to go to India.
Just before saiHng, however, he received the means to go,
and his discharge from the army. He traveled through

change took place gradually, not abruptly. It was a
result of the natural degeneration of the race. There were certain depraved tendencies of the human heart
which brought it about. It was a work of time to develop
these and give them full play. We must keep in mind
these facts and the condition of the human race just at
this time, if we would correctly apprehend this change
and its slowly-moving but efficient causes.
THE TRANSITION.
The worship of one God passed into the worship of
the powers and objects of nature. This grew out of a
natural awe at the sight of the mighty forces evidently
at work and yet inexplicable to the nations in their
uncultured state. Their habits of life were simple.
While they journeyed, as they tilled their fields, or fed
their flocks, their attention was drawn to the sky, now
•clear, now cloudy; to the sun, now shining in beauty, now obscured in the darkness of night; to the day-dawn and
the sunset, to the resurrection of vegetable Hfe in the spring, the growth of cropsthroughtheheatof summer, the
ripening harvests of autumn, and the cold of winter and the barrenness of earth. They gazed in awe upon the
-Storms ; upon the lightning as it glared in the midst of the
dark, black clouds ; upon the tall trees bending beneath
the strong winds ; upon the mountains shaking in the
earthquake or vomiting their contents with rumblings,
and flame, and smoke. They listened in astonishment to
the noise of thunder, to the whistling, and sighing, and
Toaring of the wind. With wonder they saw the earth
into which they cast their seed return it to them in the
manifold harvest ; they watched the fruits and grains mature and ripen. All about them mysterious processes were going on, which they could not comprehend. Were

could easily overthrow ; as creatures of a day in the
presence of these, seemingly, ever-enduring beings. So man passed from the worship of God to the worship of the works and forces which God had made ; from rev
erence for the Creator to reverence for the created.
THE FIRST HYMNS AND PRAYERS.
Reverence for the gods was not merely a silent observance and awe-stricken contemplation of the great powers
at work in nature. The observers felt that these beings
held some relation to themselves, and that praises,
prayers and offerings would not only be acceptable to
the gods, but that they were really demanded in order to
avert the anger of the gods or secure their favor. Hence
the earliest literature of the race is devoted to singing the
praises or invoking the aid of the gods. Priests were
soon selected to represent the people at the seasons of
sacrifice and to give themselves more continually to
prayer than would be possible to men generally. The worship of these early days was exceedingly simple and the priests possessed no unusual powers. As Whittier has expressed it
:
" The morning twilight of the race Sends down these matin psalms ; And still with wondering eyes we trace The simple prayers to Luna's grace, That Vedic verse embalms. '
'
The American Indians, the Aztecs of western South
America, the early Hindoos, the Chinese and the Parsees
all exhibit in their sacred writings this nature-worship.
Traces of it are still to be seen in the Parsees' worship of
the sun, in the worship of heaven and earth among the
Chinese, in the Indians' reverence for the Great Spirit, in

the Peruvian sun-worship and in many otlier features of

Let us look at some specimens of early religious
poetry. The first is from Monier Williams' transla
tions of the Vedas. Varuna is the god of the "moist

" The mighty Varuna, who rules above, looks down Upon these worlds, his kingdom, as if close at hand. AVhen men imagine they do aught by stealth, he knows it. No one can stand, or walk, or softly glide along,
Or hide in dark recess, or lurk in secret cell. But Varuna detects him, and his movements spies. Two persons may devise some plot, together sitting. And think themselves alone; but he, the king, is there

A third—and sees it all. His messengers descend . Countless from his abode, forever traversing This world, and scanning with a thousand eyes its inmates.

the ancient worship of these gods. The Mongolians also worshiped the Teng-Ri, or god of the sky. The
Chinese have for centuries believed in "celestial spirits,"
as they call them, spirits of the sun, and moon, and stars;
spirits of clouds, winds, rain and thunder; spirits of
mountains, fields, rivers, grains and trees. All these were
reverenced as gods. So the Egyptians worshiped natu
ral objects and powers. Indeed, every one of the re
ligions which existed in antiquity, and of which anything
is known, possessed nature-worship as their primary ele
ment. The ancient religions which continue unto this,
day, also possess this characteristic, and though covered
with the debris and overgrowth of centuries of supersti
tious teachings, still it is to be distinctly traced.
WHERE DID IDOL-WORSHIP COME FROM ?
Thus far we have no trace of any other than the direct
worship either of God; or of the invisible spirits, or gods,
that were supposed to dwell In the objects of nature; or
of those objects themselves. As yet no attempt had been.



WHENCE CAME THE MANY GODS AND IDOLS? 57
made to represent them by images or idols. When,
where and how did the worship of idols take its rise?
These are questions difficult to answer. In the Bible the
first distinct traces of idolatry are found in Genesis xxxi,
19, where we read that "Rachel had stolen the images
that were her father's." These images, or idols, or gods, as both Jacob and Laban term them, were the teraphim
or luck-givers. They had a human head and were used in
divination or fortune-telling.
They were consulted as oracles.
But these could hardly have
been the first idols, for their
idea was too well developed. There must have been a grad
ual introduction of idols and
of the idea of making repre
sentations of the gods. The
account in Genesis, just re
ferred to, speaks as though it
were no unusual thing to have
gods; there is no expression
of strangeness at the occurrence, nor anything that would
indicate that these were the
first known idols. What follows
is suggested as the probable line of development in the
idea of idols, but so far as is now known, there is no way
of definitely determining the question.
Finding it difficult to fasten their thoughts on invisible,
intangible beings, men, at the beginning, probably sought
to aid their worship by selecting some object to represent
the being worshiped. This object was not to be wor
shiped in and for itself, but, simply, as an aid to devotion,

representing the being worshiped. Then, gradually, the'
worship was transferred to the object and withdrawn
from the being represented. Or, it may be that the being worshiped was supposed in some manner to dwell in the idol, and was worshiped thus. Or, it may be that me
teoric stones were regarded as images of the gods sent
down from the heavens. Or, it may have been in several
of these ways, or in all combined. The aesthetic tastes of
men would soon lead them to give a more shapely appear
ance to the meteoric masses of stone, and then, as these
must of necessity be scarce, copies of them were sculptured. As men became more and more accustomed to these
idols and less and less
spiritual in their worship
they would venture to
give expression to their
ideas of the unseen eods. Other materials were used and, as might be
required by the materi
als, other shapes were
of necessity given. At
first, it would seem, that
only representations of
animals were attempted,,

attached to various ani

When this introduction of idols occurred, we cannot
tell ; probably, not long after the worship of nature had

become established, and die worship of one God had
been generally forgotten. Not very much more than
one hundred and fifty years elapsed between the death of Noah and the
birth of Jacob, so
that in all prob
ability idols had
not long been in
use when this in
cident of Jacob and Laban took place. Not long
after this time the
full human figure was used in idol representations,

period a collec

conceptions of art were lavished on some of these idols,
and at the same time the rudest notions of the most
barbarous nations were also expressed in them. The
word idol originally meant simply an image, and only in
after ages was an idol regarded as itself a divine thing
or being, rather than merely an image of it.

Thus we have traced the worship ot the world down
through the ages of antiquity. We have had to rely upon
other than merely historic sources of information. We
have seen the gradual introduction of Polytheism (many

forms). For the rest of our way the light shines more
and more clearly. Historic times are now reached, and
we shall find much less difficulty in tracing the stories of

IDOL FROM HINDUSTAN,






SACRKD AND HEATHEN TRADlTIONi,. 63
CHAPTER III.
SACRED AND HEATHEN TRADITIONS.
What appears to be of most importance is, the fact, attested by the hieroglyphic paintings of the Mexican, as well as by the tales now current in all quarters from the Arctic Ocean to Cape Horn, that ona of these great periods, called "the Age of Waters," closed with a convulsion, the account of which, in all its broader outlines, is remarkably akin to the Mosaic record of the Deluge.

Archdeacon Charles Hardwick.
FROM time to time during the past half century
travelers have unearthed traditions from among
heathen nations concerning the early history of
the world. They have deciphered inscriptions, found the
key to the hieroglyphics, or writings whose letters were
yet pictures in form, and, by questioning, learned from
the heathen peoples themselves of traditions and legends
which bear upon the prominent events of early history.
These narratives are from a variety of sources and from
peoples differing widely in locality, language and civiliza
tion. They are matters of curious interest, and they
serve to confirm the Biblical stories of the creation, deluge,
dispersion of the races and other events. They agree to
a great extent among themselves, just as far as is really
possible considering the changing circumstances of the
peoples who hold them. But they serve another and
more important purpose to us just here. They throw
much light on the early history of the religions of which
they form a part. They confirm the idea of the original



f-^A /z:a'A-(>a-s (//.; aa'.s.
unity ot the race and ot the early existence of one reli
gion for the world.
The oldest civilizations of the world are, respectively,
those of Eg-ypt, Babylon, Phenicia, the Hindu and the
( ireek. Among each of these the traditions ot the early
events referred to above are found. Almost, though not
([uite, all the nations ot the world try to give some account
ut the origin of the world and of nations. Man)' of the
uncivilized peoples, as the Indians of America, the Mex
icans and the Pacific Islanders, have some pojjular stories
ot the deluge. We propose to place side by side some
of these, that they may be compared with each other.
The traditions of the creation are often mixed up with
those of the deluge or the re-creation, and we give of
them the versions accepted by the best scholars.
TRADITIONS OF CRE.VTKjN.
Among many peoples is found the teaching that man
was made of the dust of the earth. The Greeks represent Prometheus as moulding from clay the first human beings, and giving them life by means of fire which he stole from heaven. The Peruvians called the first man Alpa
Camasca, or "animated earth." The IMandans, a tribe of
Indians ot North America, believed that the Great Spirit
formed two figures ot clay, which he dried and animated
li\" the breath of his mouth. To the one was eiven the
name of the "first man," to the other, "companion." The Otaheitans said tliat God made man of red earth, and the Dyacks of Borneo, that he had been made of common
dust. The Zoroastrians (or Parsees) in the Bundehesh, a
l.iook containing none but ancient traditions, have man)'
traditions regarding the creation and fall of man. The
"garden ot P^den was undoubtedly in southern Persia, or
near by, hence these are traditions which have lingered



SACKJiJJ AiVD HEATHEN TR41)1 fJOSS A
around the spot where the events happened. According
to the Parsees, there was a garden where the first human
belnCTs Hved, and ui it two trees, the one bearing- " Haoma,
"
supposed to give immortaUty to those who drank its juice. (Haoma and the Hindu word "Soma" are
probably different forms of one word. The Hinchi .Soma
was possessed of the same properties as the Parsee
Haoma). Then follows a story of the first temptation of
man, bearing the closest resemblance to the Bible story,
even in the incident of the tempter having taken the
form of a serpent.
The inhabitants of the Caroline Islands, a group in
Micronesia, said: "In the beginning there was no death,
but a certain Erigiregers, who was one of the evil spirits,
and who was sorry to see the happiness of the human
race, contrived to get for them a sort of death from
which they should never wake." The Hottentots said
that " their first parents had committed so great a fault,
and so grievously offended the Supreme God, that he had
cursed both them and their children."
Berosus, the Chaldean, read from the inscriptions on
the Assyrian monuments, the tradition that there had
been ten kino;s before the delucre. Ten antediluvian
heroes are mentioned in Genesis. The legends of the
Parsees say the same thing. In India the tradidons tell
of nine Brahmadikas, who, with Brahma, the first of all,
make ten, whom they called the Ten Fathers. The
Chinese count ten emperors, who reigned before his
torical times began. There is a multitude of correspond
ences similar to these. These are selected simply as
specimens. There is another tradition, well-nigh uni
versal, and agreeing in all important particulars as told
by different nations. This is that concerning the flood.
In addition to traditions there are coins, medals and



66 £IiJiOJi'S CHAINS.
monumental inscriptions which perpetuate the story, as
is illustrated in the specimen coin given below.
TRADITIONS OF THE DELUGE.
Let us keep in mind the differences between the nations
holdino- the tradition. It was impossible for them to have
conferred with one another, or to
have copied from each other. The
confusion of languages, their wide
separation in point of space and time,
prevented this. The oldest historic
nation, Egypt, having lost most of
its sacred books before they were
made known to other nations or even
to the later generations among them
selves, possess few traces of the tradition. One passage
e in the writings of Manetho, the historian, distinctly refers
to the deluge. "The Book of the Dead" constantly refers
to the sun-god, Ra, as voyaging in a boat on the celestial
ocean, and Ra is said to have been so disgusted with the insolence of men that he determined to exterminate the
race.
Clear and complete is the account which Berosus has preserved. He was a learned Chaldean priest, liv
ing in the time of Alexander the Great, about 325 B. C.
This narrative is a translation made from the inscriptions
of the Assyrian monuments, and compared with tradi
tions of his own time.
COIN REPRESENTING
THE DELUGE.
THE CHALDEAN STORY.
After the death of Ardates, his son, Xisuthrus, reigned
eighteen sori (an uncertain period). In his time happened
a great deluge, the history of which is thus described
:
The deity Kronos appeared to him in a vision and



SACRED AND HEATHEN TRADITIONS. 67
warned him that on the 15th day of the month Dsesius there would be a Hood by which mankind would be de
stroyed. He therefore enjoined him to write a history of the beginning, course and end of all things; and to
bury it in the City of the Sun, at Sippara.* He was also
to build a vessel, and to take with him into it his friends
and relatives; he was to put on board of it food and
drink, with different reptiles, birds and quadrupeds. As
soon as he had made all arrangements he was to commit himself to the deep. Having asked the Deity whither he was to sail, he was answered: "To the gods, after having offered a prayer for the good of mankind."
Whereupon, not being disobedient to this heavenly
vision, he built a vessel five stadia in length and two in
breadth. Into this he put everything which he had pre
pared, and embarked in it with his wife, his children and
his personal friends. After the flood had been upon the
earth and had in due time abated, Xisuthrus sent out
some birds from the vessel, which not finding any food,
nor any place where they could rest, returned to the ves
sel. After an interval of some days, Xisuthrus sent out
the birds a second time, and now they returned to the
ship with mud on their feet. A third time he repeated the experiment and then they returned no more. Xisu
thrus hence judged that the earth was visible above the
waters, and accordingly he made an opening in the vessel, and seeing that it was stranded upon the summit of
a certain mountain, he quitted it with his wife and daugh
ter and the pilot. Having then paid his adoration to the
earth, and having built an altar and offered sacrifice to
the gods, he, together with those who had left the vessel

with him, disappeared. Those wlio had remained in the
vessel, when they iound that Xisuthrus and his compan
ions did not return, in their turn left the vessel and began
to look for him, calling him by his name. Him they saw
no more, but a voice came to them from heaven, bidding
them lead pious lives, and so join him who was gone to
live with the cjods, and further informing: them that his
wife, his daughter and the pilot had shared the same
honor. It told them, moreover, that they should return
to Babylon, and how it was ordained that they should
take up the writings that had been buried in Sippara.and impart them to mankind, and that the country where
they then were was the land of Armenia. Having heard
these words this company offered sacrifices to the gods,
and taking a circuit journeyed to Babylon. The vessel having been thus stranded in Armenia, and parts of it
still remaining in the mountains of the Corcyrseans (or Cordyaeans, /. e., the Kurds of Kurdistan), in Armenia, the people scrape off the bitumen from the vessel and make use of it by way of charms. Now, when those who were so commanded returned to Babylon, they dug up the writings which had been buried at Sippara; they
also founded many cities and built temples, and thus the
country of Bab^'lon became inhabited again.
The Hindoo narrative has been colored by the char
acter of that people, but yet it is preserved with great
accuracy, and possesses many points of likeness to the
Biblical story.
I'HE irrNDOO TRADITION.
The traditions of India appear in many forms. The
one which most remarkably agrees with the BibHcal ac
count is that contained in the Mahabharata. We are
there told that Brahma, having taken the form of a fish.



SACA'EJi JXJi HEA'JJIEN TKAV/T/ONS. 69
appeared to the pious Manu (Satya, /. e., the righteous,
as Noah also is called) on the banks of the river Wirini.
Thence, at his request, Manu transferred him to the Ganges when he had grown bigger, and finally, when he
was too large for even the Ganges, to the ocean. Brahma now announces to Manu the approach of thr Deluge, and bids him build a ship, and put in it all kinds
of seeds, together with the seven Rishic, or holy beings.
The flood begins and covers the whole earth. Brahma
himself appears in the form of a horned fish and the ves
sel being made fast to him, he draws it for many years,
and finally lands on the highest summit of Mount Hima
rat (/. c, the Himalaya). Afterwards, by the comrnand of
God, the ship is made fast, and in memory of the event,
the mountain is called Naubandhana (?'. e., ship bind
ing). By the favor of Brahma, Manu, after the Flood,
creates the new race of mankind, which is thenceforth termed Manudsha, or born of Manu.
The Chinese story is sometimes called in question as
possibly not referring to the general deluge, but to some
local flood. The truth is, we know as yet comparatively
little about the story, which is as follows
THE CHINESE TRADITION.
Fuh-he is the reputed founder of the Chinese civilization
and the author of the Yhi-king, the oldest of the sacred
books. According to the legend, he is represented as
escaping from the waters of a deluge, and re -appearing
as the first man at the production of a renovated world.
He is attended by seven companions, his wife, three sons
and three daughters.
Dr. Gutzlaff, long a resident in China, says that he saw
in one of the Buddhist temples a representation of the
deluge in plaster work. Let it be kept in mind, that



JO MR/iOK'S CHAINS.
Buddhism incorporated in every land to which it went all the traditions, myths and legends which it found current
among the people. "In beautiful stucco," Dr. Gutzlaff
says, "was depicted the scene where Kwan-Yin, the Goddess of Mercy, looks down from heaven upon the
lonely Fuh-he (or Noah) in his ark, amidst the raging
waves of a deluge, with the dove with an olive branch in
its beak, flying toward the vessel."
Passing to the other side of the Pacific Ocean, we find among the Mexicans and the Americans traditions of the
same character as the above. These agree so precisely
that they cannot be a myth, a mere invention, but must
of necessity, be the recollection of a real, terrible event,
indelibly impressed on the memories of their ancestors, and faithfully handed down. That it has never been for
gotten, nor its important points altered, even though the
dress of the story has been changed, is an evidence of the awful impression which this judgment of God left
upon the nations descending from the survivors.
The Mexican traditions were first taken down as they were told to the Dominican missionaries. Travelers have
compared their accounts with the hieroglyphics on ancient Mexican monuments and found them to agree.
THE MEXICAN LEGEND.
"Of the different nations that inhabit Mexico," says
A. von Humboldt, "the following had paintings resemb
ling the deluge of Coxcox, namely, the Aztecs, the Mixtecs,
the Zapotecs, the Tlascaltecs and the Mechoacans. The
Noah, Xisuthras, or Manu of these nations, is termed
Coxcox, Teo Cipactli, or Tezpi. He saved himself with his
wife, Xochiquetzatl, in a bark, or, according to other tra
ditions, on a raft. The painting represents Coxcox in
the midst of the water waitino- for a bark. The moun



'SACRED AND HEATHEN TRADITIONS. yj
tain, the summit of which arises above the waters, is the
peak of Colhuacan, the Ararat of the Mexicans. At the foot of the mountain are the heads of Coxcox and his
wife. The latter is known by two tresses in the form of
horns, denoting the female sex. The men born after the deluge were dumb: the dove from the top of a tree dis
tributed among them tongues, represented under the form of small commas." Of the Mechoacan tradition
he writes, "that Coxcox, whom they called Tezpi, em
barked in a spacious acalli with his wife, his children,
several animals and some grain. When the Great Spirit
ordered the waters to withdraw, Tezpi sent out from his
bark a vulture, the zopilote, or vultur aura. This bird
did not return on account of the carcasses with which
the earth was strewn. Tezpi sent out other birds, one
of which, the humming-bird, alone returned, holding in its
beak a branch clad with leaves. Tezpi, seeing that fresh
verdure covered the soil, quitted his bark near the mountain of Colhuacan." The Peruvians also have legends of the deluge as
have many of the Polynesian islanders.
THE FIJI islanders' TRADITION.
The Fiji Islanders say that "after the islands had been
peopled by the first man and woman, a great rain took
place, by which they were finally submerged ; but before
(the highest places were covered by the waters, two large
double canoes made their appearance. In one of these
was Rokora, the god of carpenters, in the other Rokola,
his head workman, who picked up some of the people and kept them on board until the waters had subsided ;
after which they were again landed on the island. It is reported, that in former times, canoes were always kept
in readiness against another inundation. The persons

thus saved, ci^ht in number, were landed at Mbenga,
where the highest of their gods is said to have made
his first appearance. By virtue ot this tradition, the
chiefs of Mben<ja take rank before all others, and have
always acted a conspicuous part among the Fijis. The\'
style themselves Ngalidnra-ki-langi—subject to heax'en
alone."
AMERICAN INDIAN IRAIUTIONS.
Many of the tribes of North America related in their
rude legends that the human race had been destro3'ed by
a deluge, and that their god, to re-people the earth, had
changed animals into men. The traveler, Henry, repeats
a tradition whicJi he had heard from the Indians of the
Lakes. Formerly the Father of tlie Indian tribes lived toward the rising sun. Having been warned by a dream
that a cieluge was coming to destroy the earth, he con
structed a raft, on which he saved himself with his family
and all animals. He floated thus many months on the
water. The animals, which then liad the power of speech, complained aloud and murmured against him. At last a
new earth appeared, and he stepped down on it with all
these creatures, who thenceforward lost the power of
speech as a punishment for their murmurs against their
preserver. ,
THE GREEK STORY.
Hellas has two versions of a flood, one associated
with Ogyges, and the other, in a far more elaborate form, with Deucalion. Both, however, are of late oriein. They
were unknown to Homer and Hesiod. Herodotus, though he mentions Deucalion as one of the first kines of the
Hellenes, says not a word about this flood. Pindar is the
first writer who mentions it. In Apollodorus and Ovid
the story appears in a much more definite shape, though,



SACRED A\l) JlEATIfEK 'J RADrj-JONS.
Io
of course, this is but a re-writing of the early tradition.
Finall)', Lucian gives a narrative not very different from
that ot Ovid, except that he makes provision for the
safety of the animals, which Ovid does not. He attri
butes the necessity for the Deluge to the exceeding wicked
ness of the existing race of men, and declares that the earth
opened and sent forth waters to swallow them up, as
well as that heavy rain fell upon them. Deucalion, as
the one righteous man, escaped with his wife and chil
dren and the animals he had put into the chest and
landed on the top of Parnassus, after nine days and
nine nights, during which the chief part of Hellas was
under water, and all men perished except a few^ who
reached the tops of the highest mountains. Plutarch
inentions the dove which Deucalion made use of to as
certain whether the flood was abated, though he may
have borrowed this from the Septuagint version of the ( )ld Testament, access to which he had probably enjoyed,
and with \vhich he was most likely familiar.
The many points of agreement will be readily noted.
The fact of a deluge of waters sent by the Supreme Being, as a punishment for man's wickedness; the saving
of a chosen few by means of a boat; the re-peopling of
the earth by these, all present points of likeness to the
Biblical account. This is inexplicable unless the record
is true and all the nations of the earth were made oi one
blood. But these are not all of the remarkable agreements.
Of the same character as the above stories, are the
traditions of the history of the race after the flood, of
the building of the tower of Babel, and the confusion of
tono-ues. We can call attention to but one of these, the
Chaldean account concerning the tower of Babel, which
jiiay be regarded as a fair specimen ot the many.



jA E/iJiOJi'S CHAINS.
CHALDEAN STORY OF THE TOWER OF BABEL.
The story of the "Tower of the Tongues" was among
the most ancient recollections of the Chaldeans, and was
one of the national traditions of the Armenians, who
had received it from the civilized nations inhabiting the
.Tigro-Euphrates basin. Berosus records this event in
complete agreement with the Bible, as follows
:
"They say that the first inhabitants of the earth, glory
ing in their own strength and size and despising the gods, undertook to raise a tower whose top should reach the
sky, in the place in which Babylon now stands; but when
it approached the heaven, the wind assisted the gods and
overthrew the work upon its contrivers, and its ruins are
said to be still at Babylon; and the gods introduced a
diversity of tongues among men, who till that time had all spoken the same language; and a war arose between Chronus and Titan. The place in which they
built the tower is now called Babylon, on account of the
confusion of tongues, for confusion is by the Hebrews
called Babel."
WHAT HAS THE BIBLE TO SAY ABOUT IDOLATRY?
There is another aspect of the relation of the Bible to
the heathen religions, to which we should call attention. In what terms does the Bible speak of the worship of
false gods and idols? The Israelites were brought into
contact with idolatry very early in their histoi-y. The
patriarchs were familiar with it, both as they journeyed abroad and among their neighbors at home. Abraham's
parents were at least partially idolatrous. Jacob, while
living with Laban, was accustomed to the sight of the
teraphim and other gods. Joseph had for his wife the daughter of a heathen Egyptian priest. Jacob and his



SACRED AND HEATHEN TRADiriONS. 7c
children, during their life in Egypt, were surrounded by
temples, idol groves, sacred beasts and all the parapher
nalia of heathen worship. Moses was brought up in all
the learning of the Egyptians. Undoubtedly, as was
customary in Egypt, he had for his teachers Egyptian
priests. When Israel made its exodus from Egypt, thej miraculous power which God gave to Moses was brought
into contact with the power of the sorcerers and mao-i
cians of Pharaoh's court. After they had left Egypt
they remembered the idol-worship they had been accus
tomed to see. The first idol ever made and worshiped
by the Hebrews, was the golden calf. Side by side with
this incident, is the first plain command against idolatry:
"Thou shalt have no other gods before me. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of
anything that is in the heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the waters under the earth:
thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor.serve them."
While God was giving this stern, strong, plain command
to Moses, for him to repeat to the chosen people of Israel,
they were engaged in their idolatrous worship. In the com
mand to Israel, we see how God regards the worship of idols. For awhile Israel regarded God's command, On
their way to Canaan they yielded to the charms of the
daughters of Moab, and with most terribly wicked worship they bowed to the heathen god Baal-Peon For
this they were severely punished. During the life oi
Joshua they did not again yield to the temptations oi
idolatry. Gideon's father, Joash, worshiped Baal. After
Gideon's death, idolatry became the national sin of Israel. From Samuel's time until the reign of Solomon, the
people were loyal to Jehovah's worship. Solomon's foreign wives brought with them the gods which they
were accustomed to worship, and soon all Israel was



76 £KROA-S C/L-UNS.
turned to worship them. From this time until alter the
captivity at Babylon, idolatry was the constant sin of
Israel. Often God sent his messengers, the prophets, to
warn them of the danger of their sin. Often His judg
ments were shown in the terrible calamities which came
upon Israel. But it took the most awful of all calamities,
the temporary ruin of the nation, to work a complete cure.
God chose Israel as the people to preserve for the world
the pure worship of Himself, the one and the only God.
How they failed to fulfill their high calling we have seen.
God was preparing in Israel the true religion which
was designed to be universal. In Abraham's seed all the
lamilies ot the earth were to be blessed. The lews were
made the keepers of the treasure of the promises of the
Saviour. God selected them from all the nations for this express purpose ; He gave them a territor)' shut oft from
that of other nations ; in their language, habits, wa)s of
thinking and religion, they were distinct from all others.
They were to be kept separate until the time when God
should give the true religion to the whole world.

'Not in vain the nation-strivings, nor by chance the currents flow

IN this chapter it is proposed to survey rapidly the
progress of the whole heathen world in idolatrous
worship from its first introduction. We have already seen how the world began with the worship of one God,
but passed into the worship of the objects, powers and
forces of nature ; and how to these were given tangible
forms in the shape of idols. Further we have noticed
the gradual introduction of the worship of animals, and
men, and their idols.
METHODS OF GROUPING RELIGIONS.
The various religions might be classified by dividing
them into two groups; first, those having sacred books,
and secondly, those having no sacred books. According to this method, for example, the Hindu, Parsee, Egyp
5

tian, Chinese, Buddhist and Mohammedan rehgions^
would be placed in one group, and the religions of the
Japanese Shintoists, of the Indians of America, of the
Pacific Islanders, ot the African Fetichists and of our
heathen ancestors, in another group. This is rather an
arbitrary division.
Another mode of arranging them is as missionary
or proselyte-making religions and non-missionary religions. Thus, Brahminism, as it never went beyond In
dia, and Confucianism, as it never sent its teachers out of China, would be in one class, while Buddhism which was
spread all over Eastern Asia by its missionary priests, and Mohammedanism whose priests went over Western Asia and Northern Africa making proselytes, would be in another class. We must have some system of classifying and arrang
ing- the different relig-ions, and the followine has seemed
to be the most simple and natural classification. To look
at them first, as original religions and as reformed re
ligions, and secondly, as dead and as living religions. It
happens that most of the dead religions were original
religions, and so we take these up first. Then we notice
the living original religions, and aftervv^ard the reformed
religions, which are nearly all living. The religions
which will be described in the following pages, from
Chapters V. to X., are dead original religions ; those in
Chapters XL to XIX. are living original religions ; and
those in Chapters XX. to XXXVI., are living reformed
religions. It is proper that these terms, as they are in
tended to be used here should be quite clearly defined.
DEAD RELIGIONS AND LIVING RELIGIONS.
Many religions still exist, but some are extinct. We speak of languages as dead or living ; the ancient Greek



THE SUBJECT IN A NUTSHELL. 79
and the Latin, which are no longer spoken, are called
dead. The French, German or English, which are in
common use to-day, are called living. Though these
dead languages are no longer spoken, words and phrases
which are derived from them still survive in the living
languages. Indeed some of the living languages are
built up out of these dead languages. Just so in religions,
there are worships which have no followers to-day; there
are ruins of their temples and idols, and portions of their sacred books remaining to us. The accounts which
ancient historians have preserved for us of their worships^
the ruins of their temples, their majestic monuments and
inscriptions, and their sacred books which have of late
years been translated into our language, enable us to
learn very minutely of many of these worships. Of the
living religions, we have but to study the narratives of
travelers and of those scholars who have taken special
pains to study and explain the sacred books, rites, le
gends and customs of the people following these faiths.
ORIGINAL RELIGIONS AND REFORMED RELIGIONS.
By original religions we mean to denote those which
are, or were, the religions of the earliest inhabitants of
the various countries, and which are but little changed in
the course of time. By reformed religions we mean such as at some later day have branched off from the earlier religions. These reforms are always begun by some'
great man, who, seeing or imagining error in the old
system, undertakes to correct it, and before he is hardly
aware of it, establishes a new faith. Thus Zoroaster re
belled against the impure worship of the corrupt religion
of his country and founded Parseeism ; thus Confucius
gathered together some of the traditions and sayings of
the ancient Chinese writers added to them a great many



-80 ERROR'S CHAINS.
teachings of his own and founded Confucianism ; thus Gautama, the Buddha, convinced of the inabiUty of the
ancient Hindu faith to help the world's sorrow or to heal its wounds, founded Buddhism ; and thus Mohammed
felt himself called of God to wage a war against idolatry, and so he founded the Moslem faith.
Further, we shall take up these religions in each class as
far as possible, in the order of time, taking the oldest
first and the youngest last.
DEAD RELIGIONS.
The gods of the Egyptians, Assyrians, Jews, Greeks, Ro
mans and Britons (including all other peoples of Western
Europe), are no longer worshiped. They sank into ne
glect from various causes. Some fell by a natural decay;
there was not enough in them to enable them to retain
their hold upon their worshipers as foreign religions were
introduced. Some of the peoples holding these faiths
lost their distinctively national existence and their faith
faded out along with their national life. Stronger races
of strange peoples swept over their lands, driving them out or subduing them. The conqueror's customs and
religious worship then took the place of those of the con
quered people.
Another cause of the death of certain religions, and a more frequent cause, has been the coming in of a better
system. In this way the Egypdan religion gave place to
the Christian, and that in turn (in Egypt) to the Moham
medan. The false gods of the Greeks, Romans, Britons and other nations were forgotten in the comine of the
religion of Jesus Christ. Mrs. Browning's beautiful poem, "The Dead Pan," is based on a tradition mentioned by Plutarch, according to which, at the hour of the Saviour's agony a cry of "Great Pan is dead!" swept



THE SUBJECT IN A NUTSHELL. 3 j
across the waves in the hearing of some sailors, and im
mediately the oracles ceased. She writes:
"Gods of Hellas, Gods of Hellas,
Can ye listen in your silence? Can your mystic voices tell us
Where ye hide ? In floating islands. With a wind that evermore Keeps you out of sight of shore ? Pan, Pan is dead.
"And that dismal cry rose slowly And sank slowly through the air. Full of spirit's melancholy And eternity's despair
!
And they heard the words it said

Pan is dead —Great Pan is deadPan, Pan is dead.
" 'Twas the hour when One in Sion Hung for love's sake on a cross
;
When His brow was chill with dying.
And His soul was faint with loss ; When His priestly blood dropped downward, And His kingly eyes looked throneward

Then, Pan was dead.
"By the love He stood alone in. His sole Godhead rose complete, And the false gods fell down moaning. Each from off his golden seat
;
All the false gods with a cry Rendered up their deity

Pan, Pan was dead."
The Greek and Roman faith and the worships of West
ern Europe have all yielded to the advancing Christian
army. The process of tearing down and building up is still
ffoino" on. Parseeism and the American Indians' religion
are dying, because the people who belong to these nations
nre dying out. Mohammedanism is making great inroads



g2 ERROR'S CHAINS.
on tht Fetich-worship of Africa. Buddhism is lessening
the respect for Confucius and Lao-Tsze in China, and is
gaining ground on Shintoism in Japan. Christianity is, in
almost every land, lessening the hold of heathen religions
upon their followers and is slowly leavening the whole
world, as the facts and figures prove. Before the bright
light of the Sun of Righteousness the dark night of error
and superstition is fleeing away.
LIVING WORSHIPS.
The first group, that of original faiths, will include the
religions of Hinduism, Shintoism, of Africa, America, Oceanica, and of the Karens of Burmah. The next
group, that of the living reformed religions, will include
Parseeism, Taoism, Confucianism, Buddhism and Mo
hammedanism. This last is not, strictly speaking, a sys
tem of idolatry, and therefore we do not give it an ex
tended notice ; yet, as it exists as a fierce opponent of
idolatry, and properly has a part in the history of idola
try, we cannot pass it by altogether, but shall give it such
attention as is consistent.
The signs of these times, as well as the signs of the gone-by ages, shows that the world is moving back to its first worship of one God. As an opponent of idolatry
and as a great missionary system, Christianity is likely to
do this great work of bringing the world back to its first
faith. So we propose, briefly, after showing the contrasts
between the Christian religion and the idolatrous wor
ships, to refer to the present attitude of the Christian
system in its work among existing heathen nations. This
will involve a view of the a-reat battle-field of the world,
and of the forces fighting for and against the true worship
of the one God. To this true worship the world is slowly
but surely tending.



THE SUBJECT IN A NUTSHELL. 3 ,
THE PROPOSED TREATMENT.
Heathen religions have often been described as they
are found in their sacred books or in the teachings of
their founders. This is not as it should be. They should
be studied from these sources, but not from these only.
These show the religions, not as they are, but as they
were intended to be. The test of time which has been
applied to them, their after-growth and their effect upon
their followers should be carefully studied. It not seldom
happens that the religion as its founder taught it, and the
religion of later days which was built up on his teach
ings are very different. Take Buddhism for an example.
How widely different is the Buddhism of Burmah from
that established by Gautama ! What vast changes has the system undergone during the centuries that have passed since Gautama's death ! Or take Mohammedan
ism, which was, as Mohammed taught, a crusade against
the idolatrous reverence for relics, images, sacred places
and sacred things generally. To-day, in one of the most
famous of Mohammedan mosques—that at Delhi, India

a hair f''oin Mohammed' s beard, a part of his garments
and his sandals, are exhibited to the devout worshipers in the mosque. The Brahminism of the Vedas, the sacred
Hindu books, differs greatly from the Hindu worship of
to-day with its myriads of idols and its great system of
caste. The same religion often differs in different lands. The Buddhism of Ceylon and the Buddhism of Burmah
and Siam are different, and they together (often called
by way of distinction. Southern Buddhism), differ very
greatly from the Buddhism of China and Japan (called Northern Buddhism). The same religion has a still dif
'.ferent form in Thibet.
It is a part of our plan to look into these religions



84 ERROJi'S CHAINS.
as they existed in their beginnings and in their growths^
and so to present a complete picture. The hfe of a rehgion is not to be found in its sacred books only,
but in the life, worship and habits of thought of its
followers. From the idols, temples, worship, festivals
and religious customs of the every-day life of the house
hold or business circles, we can gain a yet more per
fect picture. The traditions, legends and superstitious
practices of the people generally contain those facts,
which are most widely accepted. The folk-lore, fireside:
stories, children's tales, the myths and songs of any
people contain the principal ideas of their religion^
Thus we propose to try to present as perfect a picture
as possible of the various heathen religions of the past
and present, and we trust the effort may succeed,
A CONCISE VIEW.
Let us take a glimpse of the roads over which we shall'
now travel. Heretofore we have followed but one wide
road. From this other roads begin to branch off, and
by-roads in turn occasionally. It will not be difficult tO'
follow these paths, however, if at the outset we place
ourselves where we can take a bird's-eye view of thewhole and pursue our way steadily to the end.
PARSEEISM.
For some time after the confusion of tongues the na
tions remained in the vicinity of the tower of Babel.
Then they began to disperse, all but one nation. This
one journeyed only a short distance to the south and
founded the empires of Assyria and Babylon, the Persia
of later days. Here we find traces of that idolatrous
worship which soon passed into Parseeism. Zoroaster was
the man who was instrumental in reforming the ancient



THE SUBJECT IN A NUTSHELL. gc;
Assyrian religion. Zoroaster retained the worship of the
sun and of fire, and taught that there were two gods, a good god and an evil god, Ormuzd and Ahriman. There
are only a few Parsees left to-day and the old Assyrian
religion is entirely extinguished.
AFRICAN RELIGION.
The nations who passed south-west across Northerrt
Arabia and Sinai, finally came to Africa. In Egypt we
find relics of a very high civilization, and they seem to
indicate that one of the greatest of the nations of the
earth settled there. Their worship was of the sun, moon and stars and of animals. The River Nile, upon which
their very life depended, was soon received as an object
of worship. Some part of those who came to Egypt wandered up the Nile and passed south and west to
Central Africa. Here they were brought in contact with
nature in its wildest forms. There was little need of
tilling the soil for crops, as nature produced of herself
so abundantly in this tropical climate. The heated at
mosphere did away with the necessity either of substan
tial dwellings or of more than a little clothing. Hence
the nations had little to do, and as the old proverb says,
"Satan finds mischief for idle hands to do," he soon,
evidently, set these nations to occupy their time in quar
reling among themselves. Thus the most brutal habits
were brought about and the traces of their original
nobility and civilization were rapidly destroyed. Theirs
was a quick degeneration. Together with their civiliza
tion their religion decayed, until they were left with a re
ligion hardly worth the name, and were little above the
apes and gorillas inhabiting the wild woods about them.
But they could never become wholly animalized, they
always retain some traces of their religious faith.



:86 ERR UK'S CHAINS.
WESTERN EUROPE.
The nations who passed north-west entered Germany .and soon scattered over Norway and Sweden and France,
and finally across the channel to the British Isles. Among
these peoples, the Teutons, Celts, Scandinavians and Gauls, the early nature-worship was long preserved.
Indeed traces of it are found even at the time of the birth
of Christ. The coldness of their climate, the severity of
the storms gradually developed them into a hardy race
and finally led them to introduce changes into their
religious faith corresponding to their surroundings.
Their myths, legends and songs, as well as their more
directly religious worship, partook largely of the heroic
•element. Christianity early overspread these lands and
the early religions died out as Christianity grew.
THE SOUTHERN MIGRATION.
One of the strongest of existing religions is found in
the Brahminism of India. This is the religion of the
people who moved south-east till they came to the Indus
River. They settled along its banks until they were well
established in their habits of life and religious faith, and
then some of them wandered away to the East, till they
came to the River Ganges, and settled in its valley. Others wandered south, and soon the whole of India was occupied. These people kept up communications with one another and preserved one lano-ua^e, thouofh this was
modified in different parts of the country. Their religion
retained most of its features in common among them all.
Early in their history other Vedas, or sacred books, were
written in addition to the Rig-Veda or book of hymns to the gods. Other sacred books were added to these, called Brahmanas and the laws of Manu. Their eods



THE SUBJECT IN A NUTSHELL. gy,
were multiplied, temples and shrines were built. The
larger rivers were believed to be holy, and were, together
with the crocodiles dwelling in them, worshiped.
From India people wandered overland or across the
Indian Ocean to Burmah and Siam, and thence to the
Malay Archipelago, and from there to the Pacific Isles
and America. These migrations (or wanderings) oc
curred before the Hindu religion was developed. The
peoples who thus strayed away, carried with them the early
-worship of nature. We find this still among many of the savage tribes of North and South America and of the
Pacific Isles. These tribes gradually became savage in
the same way as the African tribes. They possess tradi
tions of an early civilization.
BUDDHISM.
In India in the fifth century before Christ, the Hindu
religion had become a very poor religion indeed. It was
at that time a mere system of priestcraft. The nation groaned under the burdens which the priests placed upon
them. Then a man was raised up to reform this religion. Sakya-Muni was born in the middle of the century ; after
attempting to find in the Hindu religion that help which
the people needed, he cast it all aside and struck out for
himself a new line of reasoning. He called himself the Bud
dha, that is, the " Enlightened One." Soon his teachings
were accepted in all India, going as far as Ceylon even.
But in India the priests soon triumphed over the new faith and Buddhism was expelled and Brahminism re
established. Excepting the Jains, a Buddhist sect in
Western India, there are now no Buddhists in India
proper. In Ceylon it still remains. Buddha taught his
disciples to preach his teachings everywhere. So they went to Burmah (from Ceylon) not long after Buddha's



gg EKROK-S CHAINS.
death. From there it spread East to Siam, and North
east up the Irrawady River along the route that the Chinese traders were accustomed to pass over. From
China it entered Japan. The Tripitakas, or "Three
Baskets," as they are designated, are the sacred books o£
the Buddhists.
china's religions.
The Chinese legends say that Noah was their first em
peror. Whether this be true or not, we know that
China, like Egypt, was early settled and possessed a high
civilization. The nations moved from Persia in the West until they came to the great Hoang Ho River ;^
along its banks, and to the north and south of it, they
settled. Of their early religion we know but little. The
great sage Confucius (or Kong the teacher), was borrk
somewhere about 551 before Christ. He was a states
man reformer. le was not a priest, nor even noted for
piety. But he gathered together the sayings of the ancients, and weaving in with them his own wisdom, he produced the system now known as Confucianism. The
books containing his teachings, and those of his immedi
ate disciples, are called the King.
A
little l)efore Confucius, lived Lao-Tsze, a philosopher
and astrologer, who did something toward re-establish
ing the old religion, and who also added new teachings^
His weird system is called Taoism, and its sacred books, are the Tao-Te-King. Buddhism in China has taken in
with Buddha's teachings the doctrines and gods of Confucius and Lao-Tsze.
SHINTOISM IN JAPAN.
The early inhabitants of Japan are supposed to be the
Ainos a race now almost extinguished. The few that



THE SUBJECT IN A NUTSHELL. gg
are left live in Yezo, the northernmost island of Japan.
Many sailors from the islands of the Malayan Archipelago were washed upon the shores of Japan and soon mixed in with the Ainos. They gradually became
stronger and stronger and, finally, the children of the
mixed races conquered the entire land. The Japanese
retained their early nature-worship, which is called Shinto,
or Kami-no-michi, the "way of the gods," until Bud
dhism came in to disturb its hold upon the people's
hearts. Buddhism entered Japan in 552 after Christ.
MOHAMMEDANISM.
About five hundred years after Christianity was established, it had degenerated in most parts of Arabia and
Syria into a system for the worship of saints and relics.
The people of Arabia were given from the earliest times
to idolatry. Mohammed was born 570 A. D. He built
upon the ruins of Judaism, Christianity and the Arabian
idolatrous worship, the system called Mohammedanism.
His motto was (and it contains the sum and substance of his teachings) "There is no God but God, and Mohammed is his prophet." He began a vigorous crusade
against idols and relic-worship. At first he sought to
extend his system by teaching only, afterwards he used
the sword. From Arabia his religion spread to Turkey,
to India, to Egypt and Africa, and even to China.
Christianity's conquests.
Christianity is the religion for the world. It is in
finitely superior to all religions of either past or present.
It was intended to be the world-religion. Its founder,
Jesus Christ, designed that it should be spread over the
whole world, and gave His disciples their marching
orders before He left them at His ascension. They were



QQ ERROR'S CHAINS.
bidden to go into all the world and preach His gospel
to every creature. They were assured of His assistance
and of final success. Without any of the power of pomp or wealth, or wisdom, or numbers, the little band undertook to obey their orders. They have spread from
land to land, until their camp-fires have been kindled
almost all around the globe. Their triumphs have been
gained by the powers of persuasion. Their past history
is grand, their present outlook glorious, and their future
prospects full of assurance.
Now let us take up more in detail these various sys
tems. Retracing the roads we have hurried over let us
start afresh and proceed more leisurely to study the re
ligious life of mankind, and especially as it is associated
with False Gods and Idols.

CHAPTER V.
THE LAND OF THE SPHINX.
I have come to Egypt to learn something of the wisdom of the Egyptians. Tell me, then, ye tombs, and temples, and pyramids, about God ; tell me about the life to come ! But the pyramids speak not; and the Sphinx still looks toward the East, to watch for the rising sun, but is voiceless and mute. This valley of the Nile speaks of nothing but death. From end to end its rock-ribbed hills are filled, with tombs. Yet what do they all teach the anxious and troubled
heart of man? Nothing! All these hills are silent. — H. M, Field.
HERODOTUS, the Greek historian, who visited
Egypt about 450 B. C, was struck with the ex
treme attention which the Egyptians paid to
rehgion. He says that they were the most religious of all mankind. The passing
stranger was impressed with the pompous ceremonies, the magni
ficent festivals, the im
posing processions and the many gorgeous
ly-robed priests. He
found large temples, where the walls were
covered with sculp
tures, paintings and
hieroglyphic writings.
All Egypt was stamp- ^^^^^^^ ^^^.^^^s. ed with the impress of relio-ion. Every art and science, and all literature were



,g. ERROR'S CHAINS.
distinctly connected with religion, and were used in the
service of their deities. They surpassed all nations in the
reverence they paid to the gods. Their religion was by
no means an open one. Like most of the false religions
of antiquity, there was a great deal of mystery about it.
Even to-day we find among the monuments traces of the
great attention which the ancient Egyptians paid to the
service and adoration of their gods.
HIDDEN HISTORY.
Formerly the world was accustomed to speak of Egypt
as the "land of ruins;" a better title is now given, the "land of monuments." The reason of the change in the
title is that it has been found that its ruins contain the
account of the past history of Egypt. Hundreds of years
ago travelers came across these great ruins covered over
with sculptures and paintings, they found traces of the
existence of gigantic structures, they found, in almost
perfect preservation, great structures like the pyramids
and the sphinx. Here evidently was a treasure-house of information, but where was the key to unlock it? It was
like a great pawnbroker's shop, full of rubbish, but also
with many articles of value locked up within its walls, but
with no key to unlock its doors. It was a land of
enigmas, of puzzling problems, of riddles. The traveler
turned from object to object with the tone of interroga
tion. Why was this, and this ? What was its purpose ? How came it here ? What does it all mean ? Evidendy
these great buildings were not erected, these mysterious
sculptures carved, these puzzling paintings drawn, merely to amuse a passing fancy. There must be some meaning
in them. Scholar after scholar pored over it, beat their
brains about it, and gave it up. Century after century passed away and still the mystery remained. There was

one key which was found, but to use this key another key
was needed. The writing of the Egyptians yet remained.



96 ERJiOH'S CHAINS.
Undoubtedly, in their sacred books, and in the inscrip
tions on the monuments or walls of the temples were
descriptions of the purpose of the great buildings, full
accounts of the past and their lost history of Egypt, and
perhaps accounts of arts and science now lost to the
world. A rich reward this, to the scholar who should
succeed in unraveling the mystery.
THE HIEROGLYPHICS.
But what was the character of this writing that it should
be so difficult to interpret? The writing was a picture
writing, with characters or syllables added, more puzzling
a -7 *7 than the most puzzhng rebus
® ^ A* mrX that ever appeared. The
III I I I LV A. Greeks, who often visited
Egypt, gave the name Hie
roglyphics to this Egyptian writing. The word means "^a^ ^~S^ dn/ I iri the Greek language
/; rrr TTT^^ ^ "sacred sculpture." Neither the Greeks nor the Romans,
even while they ruled Egypt, ever undertook to learn to
->.. read this writing. It seemed
*'
'
to them an unknowable secret. Thus gradually the ancient Egyptian language perished. So the knowledge
of the reading of the hieroglyphics passed away entirely.
For many centuries every attempt to read it failed, and
it remained a hopeless mystery. Finally, about fifty years
ago, a Frenchman succeeded in lifting the veil. Jean
Francois Champollion (born 1790, died 1832), made this
discovery, one of the greatest of the nineteenth century.
He showed how the writino^ was to be read. Now the

whole can be read perhaps almost as easily as Greek or
Latin, or the Chinese or Burmese languages. Thus was
the hidden history brought to light.
As specimens of the hieroglyphics, Wilkinson gives
the opposite Song of the Threshers to the Oxen. His
translation of the lines respectively is as follows: i.
"Thresh for yourselves" (twice repeated). 2. "O oxen."
3. "Thresh for yourselves" (twice). 4. "Measures for yourselves." 5. "Measures for your masters."
Another specimen of hieroglyphics is added below.

The Egyptian gods are numbered by die hundreds. It
is possible for us to refer to but a few here. Tlie ideas of the gods which prevailed here
were grafted on the simple nature
worship which the people brought
to Egypt from their earlier home
In every part of Egypt two
great gods, Lsis and Osiris were
worshiped. lsis is the wife of
Osiris. Ra the sun-god was the greatest of the gods, he was sup
posed to be the representative of
the Supreme Being. And
yet Osiris was
the most popu
lar god. Ra
was generally
represented as a hawk-headed man, and usu
ally with a solar
disk upon his head. Ra was
generally wor

god, as Amen
Ra, Num-Ra,

sculptures he
is represented pasht, the cat-headed god.

and thrown into the water. By and by he revives but
does not utterly destroy Set, though he defeats him. This
story probably is a picture of the daily life of the sun,
contending with the darkness, yet at last yielding to it,
and then again after an interval reappearing at the dawn
in renewed splendor. Osiris was also a type of strug
gling humanity, suffering now, defeated for a time it may
be, yet finally triumphant. This was the reason of his
worship being so popular. Osiris was the protector of
the dead, and he determined their final condition. It was
to Osiris that prayers and offerings for the dead were made, and writings on the tombs were addressed to him.
Beside these gods, there were Set the evil god, who
was represented with the head of a fabulous animal, having a pointed nose and high square ears. Isis, the
wife of Osiris, was represented as a woman, bearing on
her head her emblem the throne, or the solar disk and
cow's horns.
Amon (or Amen) the "hidden," was worshiped at Thebes. Sebek was the crocodile-headed god. His sacred
animal was the crocodile of the
Nile River. Thoth was the chief moon-god. He was the god of
CROCODILE GOD. ^^^^^^^ ^„j learning. Anubis, the jackel-headed was the god worshiped by the mummymakers. Thus gods were multiplied.
ANIMAL WORSHIP.
"If you enter a temple," says Clement of Alexandria, "a priest advances with a solemn air, singing a hymn in
the Egyptian language ; he raises the veil a litde to let
you see the god ; and what then do you see ? A cat, a
crocodile, a snake, or some other noxious animal. The

god of the Egyptian appears. It is but a wild beast,
wallowing on a purple carpet !" This language describes
the worship of ancient Egypt as we learn from the
sculptures on the monuments, as well as it characterizes
the worship at the beginning of the Christian era. To
exhibit in some symbol their ideas of their gods was the
very essence of Egyptian religion. This brought about
the grossest of superstitious worship. To set forth in
symbol the attributes, qualities and nature of their gods,
the priests chose to use animals. The ^ss^,..^,^
bull, cow, ram, cat, ape, crocodile, hippo- ^^S^^mss^
potamus, hawk, ibis, scarabaeus, were all •i.M^:^^^^'^'^^}}-^
emblems of the gods. Often the head scarab^us,
of one of these animals was joined to the body of a man in
the sculpture. But let it be remembered, that the Egyp
tians never woi'shiped images or idols. They worshiped
living representations of the gods and not lifeless images of
stone or metal. Their sculptures were never made for worship. They chose animals which corresponded as
nearly as possible to their ideas of the gods. Each of
these sacred creatures was carefully tended, fed, washed,
dressed, nursed when sick, and petted during its whole
life. After death its body was embalmed. Certain cities
were set apart for certain animals, and apartments of the
temples were consecrated to their use. Priests were
appointed to attend them. Not every animal of every
kind was worshiped, only a few of each sacred kind were
considered as sacred. A few of the whole number were
supported at the expense of the state, and were attended
by great personages. Certain animals were worshiped
in parts of Egypt and detested in other parts. Thus the hippopotamus was worshiped in Papaemis alone ; while the Thebans worshiped the crocodile ; in other places
they were hunted to death.



102 £A'AOK\S CHAINS.
Popularly these animals were regarded as gods, and
were really worshiped. By the priests they were re
garded simply as the representatives of the gods. If a
man killed certain of the sacred animals, by the laws of
Egypt he must die ; if, however, in regard to some ot
them, the killing was accidental, then he might escape by
paying a heavy fine.
A Roman soldier once killed a sacred cat, accidentally.
In spite of the fear of Rome and the interference of the
King of Egypt, the enraged mob instantly killed the
soldier. The story is told, that King Cambyses, when he
invaded Egypt, caught a number of sacred animals, and
placed them before his army. The Egyptians offered
them no resistance, but fled away, afraid to fight lest they
sliould injure the sacred animals.
Three animals were regarded as not representations
merely, but incarnations of eods ; these were the bull
Mnevis, the goat of IMendes and the bull Apis. Apis
was said to be born of a cow, yet also born of heaven.
Ele was to be black, with a white triangle on his forehead, a mark like a half-moon on his back, and a mark like a
scarabseus under his tongue. When Apis died, all Egypt mourned. As soon as a new Apis was found, the Egyp
tians donned their best clothing and made great rejoicings. The dead Apis was embalmed and received further worship. Apis was wrongly supposed to be the god whom
the Israelites imitated in their worship of the golden calf.
MUMMIES.
The Egyptians held it as a central feature of their
faith, that "man was not made to die," that we were to
live a future life, that death does not end all. Many
heathen nations believed that the body, the flesh, was an
evil thing, the seat of all base passions ; not so the

Egyptians. The greatest event in a man's life happened
after his death (to speak in apparent paradoxes). His
funeral, and the arrangements for it, surpassed all other
occasions of his life in their elaborateness. The period of
mourning lasted seventy-two days. Perhaps during all
this time, the process of embalming was going on by the
use of peculiar pre
parations which were
forced through h i s
veins as the blood was withdrawn, and
by wrapping the body in linen bands containing substances which prevented the flesh from decaying. The outermost bandage
was covered with a kind of paste
board, which represented the de
ceased as a workman in the Happy
Fields, carrying the tools of husbandry.
This is commonly called the mummy.
Before the wrapping in the linen bandages began, the body had been
steeped in a liquid called natron
(carbonate of soda). Herodotus
presents a very full description of
the process of embalming. There is
no doubt but that all this was done
as a preparation for the return of
the soul to the body in a future world. The mummy was inclosed in a coffin of wood, and this again,
if the person's friends were rich,
in a stone sarcophagus or coffin. The coffin was placed on a sledge
drawn by oxen or men, taken to the mummy casr.

river or lake-side and ferried over to the burial-place on
the sacred boats. The coffin was deposited in the tomb,
and prayers were said, and offerings given in the chapel
above the tomb. Offerings to Osiris were made during
an entire year by the family.
THE CELEBRATED BOOK OF THE DEAD.
Among many books which the Egyptians once pos
sessed, one still remains in its entirety. It is somewhat
confusing in its style, and
yet it is in the main to be
understood. A copy of
this Funeral Liturgy or Book of the Dead was 6 placed in every mummy's
coffin. We give a very
full abstract of it, because
of its unusual importance
in the religious history of
the world.
The Funeral Ritual is
opened with a dialogue
taking place at the very moment of death, when
the soul separates from the body. The deceased, addressing the deity of
Hades, enumerates all his ddes to his favor, and asks for admittance into his do
minions. The chorus of glorified souls interposes, as in
the Greek tragedy, and supports the prayer of the
deceased. The priest on earth in his turn speaks, and
implores also the divine clemency. Finally Osiris, the
god of the lower regions, answers the deceased, "Fear
5^^_



THE LAND OF THE SPHINX. jqc
nothing in making thy prayer to me for the immortaUty
of thy soul, and that I may give permission for thee to
pass" the threshold." Reassured by the divine word, the
soul of the deceased enters Kar-Neter, the land of the
dead, and recommences his invocations. After this grand commencement, which we have epito
mized, come many short chapters, much less important,
relative also to the dead and to the preliminary ceremo
nies of his funeral. When at last the soul of the deceased
has passed the gates of Kar-Neter, he penetrates into
that subterranean region, and at his entry is dazzled by
the glory of the sun, which he now for the first time sees in this lower hemisphere. He sings a hymn to the sun
under the form of mixed litanies and invocations. After
this hymn, a great vignette, representing the adoration
and glorification of the sun in the heavens, on earth and
in Hades, marks the end of the first part of the Ritual,
serving as a sort of introduction. The second part traces
the journeys and migrations of the soul in the lower region. Next come a series of prayers to be pronounced during the process of embalming, while the body is being
rolled in its wrappers. These invocations are addressed to Thoth, the Egyptian Hermes, who, as among the
Greeks, played the part of Psychopompe, or conductor
of souls. They are of the highest interest, for in each
allusion is made to the grand myth of Osiris and his contest with Typhon, of which Plutarch and Synesius
have eiven us the most recent versions. The deceased,
addressing the god, asks him to render to him again the
service he once rendered on that solemn occasion to
Osiris and his son Horus, "avenger of his father."
The body once wrapped in its coverings, and the soul
well provided Avith a store of necessary knowledge, the
deceased commences his journey. But he is still unable



[q5 eruok's chains.
to move, he has not yet the use of his hinbs ; it is necessary to address the gods, who successively restore all the
faculties he had during his life, so that he can stand up
right, walk, speak, eat and fight. Thus prepared, he
starts ; he holds his scarabseus over his heart as a pass
port, and thus passes the portal of Hades. From the first step, terrible obstacles present them
selves in his way. Frightful monsters, servants of
Typhon, crocodiles on land and in the water, serpents of
all kinds, tortoises and other reptiles, assail the deceased
and attempt to devour him. Then commences a series of combats. The deceased and the animals against which he contends mutually address insulting speeches
to each other, after the fashion of Homer's heroes.
Finally, the "Osiris" (the name applied to all the deceased) has conquered all his enemies ; he has subdued the
Typhonic monsters, and forced a passage, and, elated by his
victory, sings on the spot a song of triumph, likening him
self to all the gods, whose members are made those of his'
own body. " My hair is like that of Nu (the firmament) ;
my face is like that of Ra (the sun) ; my eyes like those of Athor (the Egyptian Venus) ;" and so on for every
part of his body. He has even the strength of Set, that is,
of Typhon, for the strife between the good and evil prin
ciple is but in appearance ; in reality they are one and the
same, and equally receive the adorations of the initiated.
After such labors the deceased needs rest ; he stays
for a time to recruit his strength and to satisfy his hun
ger. He has escaped great dangers, and has not gone astray in the desert where he would have died of hunger
and thirst. From the tree of life the goddess Nu gives
him refreshing waters, which invigorate him and enable
him to recommence his journey in order to reach the first gate of heaven.



THE LAND OF THE SPHINX. 107
Then commences a dialogue between the deceased and
the personification of the divine Light, who instructs him.
This dialogue presents some most remarkableresem
blances to the
dialogue prefixed
to the books given by the Alexandrian
Greeks as transla
tions of the ancient
religious writings
of Egypt, between Thoth and the
Light, in which the
latter explains to Thoth the most sublime mysteries
of nature. This
portion is certainly
•one of the best and grandest of
the Ritual,and may
almost be classed
with the invoca

the close of the
first part.

advance,guided by this new Li^ht, to whom he addresses his invocations.
He then enters upon a series of transformations, more



[Qg ERROIi'^ CHAINS,
and more elevated, assuming the form of and identifying
himself with the noblest divine symbols. He is changed
successively into a hawk, an angel or divine messenger
;
into a lotus ; into the god Ptah ; into a heron ; into a
crane ; into a human-headed bird, the usual emblem of a
soul; into a swallow; into a serpent, and into a crocodile.
Up to this time the soul of the deceased has been
making its journeys alone ; it has been merely a sort of image ; a mere shade, with the appearance of that body
now stretched on the bier. After these transformations
the soul becomes reunited to its body, which is needed
for the rest of the journey. It was on this account that careful embalming was so important ; it was necessary
that the soul should find the body perfect and well-pre
served. "Oh," cries the body, "that in the dwelling of
the master of life I may be reunited to my glorified soul,
do not order the guardians of heaven to destroy me, so
as to send away my soul from my corpse, and hinder the eye of Horus, who is with thee, from preparing my
way."
The deceased traverses the dwellinof of Thoth, who
eives him a book containincr instructions for the rest of
his way, and fresh lessons of the knowledge he is soon
to require. He arrives on the banks of the subterranean
river separating him from the Elysian Fields, but there a new danger awaits him. A false boatman, the envoy of the Typhonic powers, lays wait for him on his way, and
endeavors by deceitful words to get him into his boat, so
as to mislead him and take him to the east instead of to
the west, his true destination, and where he ought to
land, and rejoin the sun of the lower world. The deceased again escapes this new danger ; he unmasks the perfidy of the false boatman, and drives him away, overwhelming
him with reproaches. He at last meets the right boat to



THE LAND OF THE SPHINX. jqq
conduct him to his destination. But before s^ettino- Into
it, it is necessary to ascertain if he is really capable of
making the voyage, if he possesses a sufficient amount
of the knowledge necessary to his safety. The divine boatman therefore makes him undergo an examination, a
preliminary initiation, seemingly corresponding to the
lesser Eleusinian mysteries. The deceased passes the examination ; each part of the boat then seems succes
sively to become animated, and to demand of him its name, and the mystical meaning of the name. The stake for anchoring the boat. Tell me my name ! "The Lord
of the earth in thy case," is thy name. The rtidder. Tell me my name ! " The enemy of Apis," is thy name. The rope. Tell me my name! "The hair with which Anubis
binds up the folds of the wrappers," is thy name ; and so
on for twenty-three questions and answers.
After having thus victoriously passed through this trial,
the deceased embarks, traverses the subterranean river,
and lands on the other bank, when he soon arrives at the
Elysian Fields in the valley of Avura, or Balot, the posi
tion of which the ritual gives in these terms, "The valley
of Balot (abundance), at the east of heaven, is 370 cubits
long, and 140 cubits broad. There is a crocodile lord of
Balot in the east of that valley in his divine dwelling
above the inclosure. There is a serpent at the head of
that valley, thirty cubits long, his body six cubits round.
In the south is the lake of sacred principles (Sharu) ; the
north is formed by the lake of Primordial Matter (Rubu)."
A large picture here shows us this valley, a real subter
ranean Egypt, intersected by canals, where we see the
"Osiris" occupied in all the operations of agriculture ;
preparing the ground, sowing and reaping in the divine
fields an ample provision of that bread of knowledge he
is now to find more necessary than ever. He has, in fact,



IIO ERROR'S CHAINS.
arrived at the end of his journey; he has before him only
the last, but also the most terrible of all his trials.
Conducted by Anubis he traverses the labyrinth, and by
the aid of the clew, gfuiding- them throusfhits windings, at
jast penetrates to the judgment-hall, where Osiris awaits
him, seated on his throne, and assisted by forty-two ter
rible assessors. There the decisive sentence is to be
jpronounced, either admitting the deceased to happiness
.or excludingr him forever. Then commences a new inter
rogatory, much more solemn than the former. The
-deceased is obliged to give proof of his knowledge ; he
must show that it is great enough to give him the right
to be admitted to share the lot of glorified spirits. Each
of the forty-two judges, bearing a mystical name, ques
tions him in turn ; he is obliged to tell each one his name,
,and what it means. Nor is this all ; he is obliged to eive
.an account of his whole life.
"I have not blasphemed," says the deceased; "I have
not stolen; I have not smitten men privily; I have not
treated any person with cruelty; I have not stirred up
trouble; I have not been idle; I have not been intoxi
-cated; I have not made unjust commandments; I have
shown no improper curiosity; I have not allowed my -mouth to tell secrets; I have not wounded anyone; I
have not let envy gnaw my heart; I have spoken evil
neither of the king, nor my father; I have not falsely ac
cused any .one; I have not withheld milk from the mouths
of sucklings; I have not practiced any shameful crime;
I have not calumniated a slave to his master."
The deceased does not confine himself to denying any ill conduct; he speaks of the good he has done in his
lifetime. "I have made to the gods the offerings that
were their due. I have given food to the hungry, drink
Xo the thirsty, and clothes to the naked." We may well



THE LAND OF THE SPHINX. j j j
on reading these passages be astounded at this high
morahty, superior to that of all other ancient people, that
the Egyptians had been able to build up on such a foun
dation as their religion. Without doubt it was this clear
insiofht into truth, this tenderness of conscience, which
obtained for the Egyptians the reputation for wisdom, echoed even by Holy Scripture. Besides these general precepts, the apology acquaints
us with some police regulations for public order, raised
by common interest in Egypt to the rank of conscientious
duties. Thus the deceased denies ever having intercepted
the irrigating canals, or having prevented the distribution
of the waters of the river over the country; he declares
that he has never damaged the stones for mooring; vessels
on the river. Crimes against religion are also mentioned;
some seem very strange to us, especially when we find
them classed with really moral faults. The deceased has
never altered the prayers or interpolated them. He has
never touched any of the sacred property, such as flocks
and herds, or fished for the sacred fish in the lakes of the
temples ; he has not stolen offerings from the altar, nor
defiled the 'sacred waters of the Nile.
The Osiris is now fully satisfied; his heart has been
weighed in the balance with truth, and not been found
wanting; the forty-two assessors have pronounced that
he possesses the necessary knowledge. The great Osiris
pronounces his sentence, and Thoth, as recorder to the
tribunal, having inscribed it in his book, the deceased at
last enters into bliss.
Here commences the third part of the Ritual, more
mystical and obscure than the others. We see the Osiris,
henceforth identified with the sun, traversing with him,
and as him, the various houses of heaven, and the lake
of fire, the source of all light. Afterwards the Ritual

rises to a higher poetical flight, even contemplating the
identification of the deceased with a symbolical figure
comprising all the attributes of the deities of the Egyp
tian Pantheon. This representation ends the work.
EGYPTIAN WORSHIP.
The gods of Egypt were worshiped in temples and
tombs. Every town had at least one temple. The ser
vices were conducted by the priests, and on special occa
sions the king and scribes joined. The common people had but little to do with the worship. The most important

worship took place in the innermost chambers, where
only the priests were at all permitted to go.
The sacrifices were of animals and vegetables with the pouring out of wine and the burning of incense. The
temples were gigantic structures grouped together.
They were generally approached by avenues of sphinxes. The great temples are almost all found in Upper Egypt,
while the pyramids are in Lower Egypt. The inhabitants
of Egypt were once the greatest nation of earth, and
they built temples corresponding to their greatness.

amid of Cheops. This is 480 feet high, and contains
more than ten millions of cubic yards of stone. The
pyramid is so placed that its ibur sides exactly face the
four points of the compass. The pyramids were probably
great tombs. At the foot of the pyramids is the great
Sphinx. This is a monument of a man-headed lion,
nearly ninety feet long and seventy-four feet high. Its
face is twenty-six feet long. It is carved out of solid
rock. This great Sphinx is said to be the image of
the god Har-ma-chu, the setting sun. Between the two
front paws of the Sphinx was placed a small chapel,
consecrated to the god. As Ampere says: "This huge,
mutilated figure has an astonishing effect; it seems like
an eternal spectre. The stone phantom seems attentive;
one would say that it hears and sees. Its great ear
appears to collect the sounds of the past; its eye, directed
to the east, gazes as it were into the future; its aspect has
a depth, a truth of expression, irresistibly fascinating to
the spectator. In this figure, half statue, half mountain, we
see a wonderful majesty, a grand serenity, and even a sort of sweetness of expression."
There was much of majestic beauty about the Egypdan
religion and worship, but there was mixed with it a mass of debasing superstition. When King Cambyses of Persia conquered Egypt, and the supremacy of the world passed
out of Egypt's hands, the downfall of its religion com
menced. The religion of the conquerors was mingled
with their own. After some hundreds of years, Chris
tianity was spread over all north Africa and up the Nile. Then in the year 639, after Christ, Mohammedanism con
quered Egypt. This religion continues to predominate in Egypt.

At that time the heaven above was unnamed, In the earth beneath a name was unrecorded; Chaos, too, was unopened around them. By name the mother Tihamtu, [the Deep] was the begetter of them all. Their waters in one place were not embosomed, and The fruitful herb was uncollected, the marsh-plant ungrown. At that lime the gods [stars] were not made to go; none of them by name were recorded; order was not among them. Then were made the great gods; and these Lakhmu and Lakhamu caused to go; until they were grown they nurtured them.

they dwelt there." Here was great Babel built, and here
occurred the confusion of tongues, and from here the
nations were scattered over all the world. After this
scattering to east, west and south, there was left a large
body of people of different nations, in Chaldea. The

of these peoples, it can be said with certainty only that there were Hamites among them. The Shemites are the founders of the Assyrian king

lands. Their strange and imperfect civilization had an
immense influence over a great part of Asia, for over
1500 years. The peoples of Chaldea did not at first intermingle with
each other, but maintained a separate existence as tribes. Here was, however, the first organized government of
the world. " Cush begrat Nimrod: he be^jan to be a mighty one in the earth. He was a mighty hunter before the Lord: wherefore it is said, Even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the Lord. And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Cal
neh, in the land of Shinar. Out of that land went forth
Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and the streets of the city, and Calah and Resen, between Nineveh and Calah: the
same is a great city." Asshur was of the Semitic race,
while Nimrod was a Cushite. These two people lived
long together, and this explains how they came to have
the same language and civilization in spite of their being
of different origin. The four great cities mentioned
above gave to their king, the tide "king of the four
regions." The founding of this great empire occurred
only a little later than the beginning of the great Egyp
tian kingdom. We know almost nothing of the history



WORSHIP OF 7 HE CHALDEANS. jjj
of the Chaldean kings who succeeded Nimrod, except
that which a few traditions tell us.
THE GREAT CHALDEAN HISTORIAN.
Berosus was a Chaldean priest who lived in the days
of Alexander the Great. He was a very learned man.
He translated the history of Babylonia into the Greek
language. His history commences with the creation and
is carried down to his own time. He drew from the ancient records of Babylonia, from traditions of the
people, and from inscriptions on the monuments. We
have already referred to the traditions of the creation and
deluge which he preserved. About 2400 B. C, according to Berosus, the Medes conquered Babylonia. Here
for the first time we meet with the name of Zoroaster,
the founder of Parseeism. The record of Berosus is very much valued because of the ground which it covers. It
is wonderfully in agreement with the Bible record. At" first his statements were questioned and disputed, but
the researches of modern scholars in many respects con
firmed their complete accuracy.
RUINED MONUMENTS.
The ruins of Chaldea have been as yet but imperfectly
explored. The great buildings and monuments have been buried beneath the ground for hundreds of years, and the work of digging them out is a slow one. When
we remember that these cities and their buildings were among the first ever erected, and that Nebuchadnezzar (or Nabukudur-ussur, as Berosus calls him,) and his suc
cessors only repaired and added to these, we can see
the value of exhuming them. Stone is very rare in Chaldea, and could be brought only at great expense
from a distance. Hence all the buildings of earlier agres



12 2 ERROR'S CHAINS.
were built of bricks. So we read of the Tower of Babel,
that "they had bricks for stone." On each one of these
bricks was generally stamped the name of the kmg who erected the building. The greater part of the early Chaldean inscriptions are found on these bricks. Hero
dotus tells us that the Babylo
nians built with these sun-dried
bricks, and with here and there a layer of reed-matting ce

mented with bitumen. The outsides of the buildings
were covered with burnt or kiln-dried bricks to keep out the
rain. More elaborate specimens of their pottery appear
in articles for domestic uses, and especially in their coffins.
The sacred buildings appear to have been often built
in the form of a pyramid, with steps or stages, forming
a series of terraces, each smaller than the one beneath
it. This is the traditional style of buildings of the Tower
of Babel. The same tendency to build high sacred
buildings is seen in the pagodas of India, Burmah and
China, in the Mohammedan towers, like the Koutub
Minar, and the spires of Christian churches. The object
at the first seems to have been the trettino; nearer to
the heavenly bodies, the object of their worship. On the
upper terrace, or platform, appears to have been built in
most cases, a small chapel, or square room, richly orna
mented, containing an image of the god of the temple.



WORSHIP OF THE CHALDEAA'S. jjy
Of ancient Babylonian sculptures but few are known
to remain. Of these, one is a small bronze figure of a goddess named Keodormabug, and a broken statu
ette in alabaster of the god Nebo. But a number of
small cylinders of stone that were used as seals, and
which are covered with engravings or inscriptions, give us
much information of early Chaldean history. The Chaldeans were far advanced in astronomy and in arithmetic^
which is indispensable to a knowledge of astronomy.
A LIBRARY OF BRICK BOOKS.
The Chaldeans had eight sacred books, said to have
been written by the god Oannes. No copies of these
original books remain. But some of their sayings were
copied into the books of later kings. All that remains of the books of ancient Chaldea is that which had been
transported to Assyria, where it was found by Layard
and later by Smith, in making their excavations at Nine
veh. He found in the ruins of the palace built by King
Asshurbanipal, in one of the halls, a library. "This curi
ous library consists entirely of flat, square tablets of
baked clay, having on each side a page of very small
and closely written cuneiform cursive letters, impressed
on the clay while it was still moist. Each tablet was numbered and formed a page of a book composed of a number of such tablets, probably piled one on another in
the library." The greater part of these tablets are now
in England. This collection was intended for a public
library as we see from the following translation of some
of the tablets
:
" Palace of Asshurbanipal, king of the world, king of Assyria, to whom the god Nebo and the goddess Tash
mit (goddess of wisdom), have given ears to hear and
eyes to see what is the foundation of government. They

have revealed to the kings, my predecessors, this cunei
form writing, the manifestatation of the god Nebo, the
god of supreme inteUigence. I liave written it upon
tablets, I have signed it, I have placed it in my palace for
the instruction of my subjects." The cuneiform characters, as they are called, are made up of marks shaped like arrow-heads or wedges. There
were enormous difficulties in the way of their interpreta
tion. In Egypt the similar task of making known the
meaning of the hieroglyphics was performed In great

part by one man, Champollion, but in Assyria the work was done by many scholars. Now the famous library
is nearly all translated, as are the inscriptions on the
.seals as well. Asshurbanipal lived about B. C. 650.
MANNERS AND CUSTOMS.
The habits of life of any people both affect and are
affected by their religious belief. In heathen lands, both of
the present and the past, the daily home-life is interwoven
with religious observances. The Assyrians have been
called " the Romans of the East." They were a fierce
and warlike race. They were naturally a religious people, and the worship of the gods held a very prominent place
at least in their public life. But, sad to say, their devo

tion to religion was associated with such a degrading
worship of many false gods, that they were dragged
down by it, instead of being exalted. They were very intelligent. They
were mainly agriculturists, though
the arts flourished. It seldom rained
there except in winter, so they turned
the waters of the Tigris and the
Euphrates Rivers into channels, and conveyed them through their fields.
The priests and kings dressed in garments of woven stuffs dyed in
brilliant colors, and beautifully em
broidered with symbolical figures,
animals, men, flowers and divine symbols. The costume of the As
syrians consisted of a robe open at
the side, often with a border of
fringe, and decorated with rich em
broidery, hanging down to the feet,
and confined in the middle by a
broad girdle. It precisely resembled
the djubeh of the Eastern people in the present day.
The common people and soldiers used a shorter tunic,
reaching only to the knees, so as to allow them to walk
freely. The king, in his robes of ceremony, wore over
all a sort of long mantle or chasuble, thrown obliquely
over one shoulder and splendidly ornamented. This is
also seen on the monuments on the figures of the gods.
A high conical tiara surmounted his head, and in his
hand he held a long sceptre or staff, nearly the height of
a man. The insignia of his rank were the same as those
of Asiatic monarchs in the present day, the parasol and
large feathered fly-flaps carried behind him by slaves.
ROBED STATUE.



J 25 ERUOJi'S CHAINS.
The Assyrians wore their hair long and curled at the
end, the beard square and with rows of curls. They
were fond of wearing great quantities of jewelry, large
ear-rings, finger-rings and bracelets. Some of the sol
diers wore a cuirass of small pieces of metal protecting
the body, and allowing the tunic to appear beneath it. These were probably light infantry. Others wore long
coats of mail reaching to the feet, with a conical helmet
to which was attached a sort of veil of chain mail, falling
down on the neck, and brought round to protect the
chin, such as are now worn by the Circassians.
THE RELIGION OF ASSYRIA.
The religion of Assyria and Babylonia was, in its es
sential principles and in the general spirit of its concep
tions, of the same character of the religion of Egypt, and
in general as all pagan religions. When we penetrate
beneath the surface which gross Polytheism has acquired
from popular superstition, and revert to its original and
higher conceptions, we shall find the whole based on the
idea of the unity of the Deity, the last relic of the primi
tive revelation, disfigured indeed and all but lost in the
monstrous ideas of Pantheism ; confounding the crea
ture with the Creator; and transforming the Deity into a
god-world, whose manifestations are to be found in all the phenomena of nature. Beneath this supreme and
sole God, this great All, in whom all things are lost and
absorbed, are ranked in an order of emanation corre
sporuiing to their importance, a whole race of secondary
deities who are emanations from His very substance, who
are mere personifications of His attributes and manifes
tations. The differences between the various pagan re
ligions is chiefly marked by the differences between these
secondary divine beings.



WORSHIP OF THE CHALDEANS. jjy
Thus, as we have already seen, the imagination of the
Egyptians had been especially struck by the various
stages of the daily and yearly course of the sun. In this
they saw the most imposing manifestations of the Deity,
that which best revealed the laws of the government of
the world. In this they sought their divine personifica
tion. The Chaldaeo-Assyrians, especially devoted to as
tronomy, saw in the Astral, and especially in the planetary
system, a manifestation of the divine being. They con
sidered the stars as His true external manifestation, and
in their religious system made them the visible evi
dence of the subordinate divine emanations from the
substance of the infinite being, whom they identified with
the world, his work.
THE SUPREME GOD, ILU.
The supreme god, the first and sole principle from
whom all other deities were derived, was Ilu, whose name
signifies QoA par excellence. Their idea of him was too
comprehensive, too vast, to have any determined exter
nal form, or consequently to receive in general the
^adoration of the people; and from this point of view there is a certain analogy between Ilu and the Chronos
of the Greeks, with whom he was compared by the latter. In Chaldsea it does not seem that any temple was ever
specially dedicated to him; but at Nineveh and generally
throughout Assyria, he seems to have received the pecu
liarly national name of Asshur (whence was derived the
name of the country, Mat Asshzii'), and this itself seems
related to the Arian name of the deity Asura. With this
title he was great god of the land, the especial protector
'of the Assyrians, he who gave victory to their arms.
The inscriptions designate him as " Master or Chief of
the Gods " He it is, perhaps, who is to be recognized in

the figure occasionally found on the Assyrian monuments
(but probably adopted in later times by the Persians to
represent their Ormuzd), representing a human bust^
wearing the royal tiara in the middle of a circle borne by
two large eagle wings, and with an eagle's tail.
THE ASSYRIAN TRIAD.
Below Ilu, the universal and mysterious source of all,
was placed a triad, composed of his three first external
and visible manifestations, and occupying the summit of
the hierarchy of gods in popular worship. Anu, the
Cannes of the Greek writers, was the lord of darkness i Bel, the demiurgus, the organizer of the world; Ao,
called also Bin, that is, the divine "Son " par excellence,.
the divine light, the intelligence penetrating, directing
and vivifying the universe. These three divine persons
esteemed as equal in power and con-substantial, were
not held as of the same degree of emanation, but were
regarded as having, on the contrary, issued the one from
the other—Ao from Cannes, and Bel from Ao. Cannes,,
the " Lord of the Lower World, the Lord of Darkness," was represented on the monuments under the strange
figure of a man with an eagle's tail, and for his headdress an enormous fish, whose open mouth rises over his
head, while the body covers his shoulders. It is under
this form that, Berosus tells us, according to Babylonian
tradition, he floated on the surface of the waters of
Chaos. Bel, the " Father of the Gods," was usually re
presented under an entirely human form, attired as a,
king, wearing a tiara with bull's horns, the symbol of
power. But this god took many other secondary forms, the most important being Bel Dagon, a human bust
springing from the body of a fish. We do not know
exactly the typical figure of Ao or Bin, " the intelligent

guide, the Lord of
the visible world, the
Lord of knowledge,
of glory and light."
The serpent seems
to have been his principal symbol ; though
some other sculp
tured figures seem to
be intended to repre
sent Bin.
A second triad is produced with personages no longer vague and indeter
minate in character,
like those of the first,
but with a clearly
defined siderial as
pect, each represent
ing a known celestial
body, and especially
those in which the
C h al d se o-Assyrians
saw the most striking
external manifesta
tions of the deity
;
these were Shamash,
the sun; Sin, the moon god ; and a new
form of Ao or Bin, in

atmosphere or firmament. Thus did they industriously
multiply deities and representations of them.

THE GODS OF THE PLANETS.
Then come the gods of the five planets : Adar (Sat
urn), Merodach (Jupiter), Nergal (Mars), Ishtar (Venus), and Nebo (Mercury). The worship of Merodach, tliough
noL much cultivated at Nineveh, was of primary import
ance at Babylon, where he was regarded as one of the
principal gods. He was a secondary form, another mani
lestation of Bel in an inferior rank in the hierarchy; he
was called " the ancient one of the gods, the supreme
judge, the master of the horoscope;" he was represented
as a man, erect and walking, and with a naked sword in
his hand. Adar, " the fire," called also Samdan, " the
powerful," although his planet had been called Saturn by
the Greeks, was apparently the Assyrian Hercules. His
appellations are, "the terrible, the lord of warriors, the
strong one, the destroyer of his enemies, he who reduces
the disobedient, the exterminator of rebels," and in other
cases, " the Son of the Zodiac." On some monuments he is represented in company with Merodach. In the same manner, he
is represented in the magnificent colossal
figures in the Museum of the Louvre, and of the British Museum, where he is seen
as a god of terrible aspect, strangling in
his arms a lion that appears quite small in
comparison with him. With the surname
of Malik (king), Adar Malik is mentioned in the Bible with "Cannes the king" (Anu
Malik) (2 Kings, xvii., 31,) as the principal
god of Sippara, where the inhabitants "burnt their children in the fire" in honor of these ex
alted ones. In fjeneral these planetary gods are only fire,
secondary manifestations of the higher order. Such is

the connection between Neboand Ao. Nebo also is dis
tinguished as the "supreme intelligence;" he is the o-od
of prophetic inspiration and of eloquence, and also the
special guardian of royal prerogative, the protector of kings and the prototype whom they reproduce on earth. Like Bel, he has on the monuments an entirely human
form with the tiara, and the dress of a king; three pairs
of horns, ranged one above the other, decorate his tiara,
and tour large wings are often attached to his shoulders ;
the sceptre also is one of his common attributes.
THE GREAT GODDESS ISHTAR.
Ishtar reproduces among the planetary gods Anat and
Bilit, the great goddess of nature, the mother of all the
gods and of all beings ; she is their active and martial
form, for she is called "the Goddess of Battles, the Queen
of Victories, she who leads armies to the fight and is the
judge of warlike exploits ;" but she has a double form
uniting two characters, one fierce and sanguinary, the
other voluptuous, for under the names of Zarpanit and
Nana she presides over the reproduction of beings, and
over sensual pleasures ; she is in this last character
always represented naked, always full face and with the two hands on the chest. Moreover two Ishtars were
always distinguished, that of Arbela (called also Arbail),
and that of Nineveh, who presided over the two fortnights
of the month. The plural name of this double Ishtar,
Ishtaroth, was the origin of the Phoenician Ashtaroth. Nergal, whose image is very uncommon, stands on
the legs of a cock, and carries a sword in his hand.
The application of the name of Mars to his star was
quite natural, for- his titles in the inscriptions are "the
great hero, the king of fight, the master of battles,
champion of the gods," and also "god of the chase."



I ^2 £KKUR':i CHAINS.
THE GENII OF ASSYRIA.
Such were the great gods of Nineveh and Babylon.
Below them popular superstition believed in an immense
number of personifications of inferior order, of lesser
gods, or rather genii, whom it would be waste of time to enumerate. We must, however, mention some personages who are found on the monuments occupying an important position in the Chaldeeo-Assyrian pantheon,
and who were evidently other forms of the gods already
named, but whose position has not as yet been precisely
determined. Such is Nisroch, called also Shalman, who
"presides over the course of human destiny," and who is
also the protector of marriages ; this is the god with an
eaele's head and lara^e wincrs, whose imacje is so common
on the sculptures of the Assyrian palaces. It was in the
temple of this god at Nineveh, that Sennacherib was as
sassinated by his sons. Possibly we ought to consider this god as another form of Oannes.
The great gods are often all invoked one after the
other at the beginning of the solemn inscriptions of the
kings of Assyria. Sargon has given the names of eight
of them on the gates of the city he founded. "Shamash
has conferred on me all I possess," says he in an inscrip
tion. " Bin gave me good fortune ; I have named the great eastern gates after Shamash and Bin. Bel Daeon laid
the foundation of my city, Bilit Taauth grinds like paint
the elements of the world ; I have named the ereat
southern gates after Bel Dagon and Bilit Taauth. Oannes
prospers the work of my hand, Ishtar leads armies to
battle; I have called the great western gates after Oannes and Ishtar. Nisroch Shalman presides over
marriages, the mistress of the gods presides over births
;
I have dedicated the great northern gates to Nisroch

and Bilit." Inscriptions of such and like general purport
were sculptured on the palace walls of many of the
kings and also upon the bodies o^ the winged bulls.
WORSHIP OF THE GODS AT BABYLON.
The deity who was the principal object of worship at
Babylon and at Borsippa was Bel Merodach, with his
wife, Bilit or Myletta, the great nature-goddess, who
assumed the two opposite forms of Taauth and Zarpanit,
the one austere, the other voluptuous, like the two forms
of the Venus of classical mythology. Bilit had a mag
nificent temple in the centre of Babylon, where most infamous customs were practiced. At Ur, the god of the
city, from the remote times of Ur-Hammu, was Sin, the

moon-god; at Sippara and Larsam, Shamash, the sun;
at Erech and Nipur, Bilit-Taauth, "Goddess of the Firmament." The most shameful rites were connected with
the worship of Nana or Zarpanit, at Cutha.
The materialistic and profoundly immoral worship at
Babylon, naturally excited extreme horror in the wor
shipers of Jehovah, and provoked their vehement invec
tives against the idols of Chaldaea. We quote the elo
quent words of Baruch, that portray so vividly an always
materialistic, and often obscene worship that was, in fact,
no more than a constant employment of popular super
stition for the profit of the priests.
"Now ye shall see in Babylon gods of silver, and of gold, and of wood, borne upon shoulders, which cause
the nations to fear. . . . And taking- eold, as it were,
for a virgin that loveth to go gay, they make crowns for
the heads of their gods. Sometimes also the priests convey from their gods gold and silver, and bestow it
upon themselves, Yea, they will give thereof to the
common harlots, and deck them as men with garments, being gods of silver, and gods of gold and wood. . . .
And he that cannot put to death one that offendeth him holdeth a sceptre (Nebo), as though he were a judge of
the country. He (Bel Merodach) hath also in his right hand a dagger and an axe, but cannot deliver himself
from war and thieves. . . . They light them candles,
yea, more than for themselves, whereof they cannot see
one. They are as one of the beams of the temple, yet
they say their hearts are gnawed upon by things creeping out of the earth ; and when they eat them and their
clothes they feel it not. ... As for the things that
are sacrificed unto them, their priests sell and abuse;
in like manner their wives lay up part thereof in salt
;
but unto the poor and Impotent they give nothing of it

. . . The priests also take off their garments and
•clothe their wives and children. . . . The women
also with cords about them sitting in the way burn bran
for perfume." The most remarkable building in Babylon was the
temple of Bel. It was pyramidal in shape, having eight
stages. The lowest stage was 200 yards square. On
the summit a golden statue of Bel, 40 feet high, stood
in a shrine. There were also two other golden statues
and a golden table in this shrine. At the bottom of the
pyramid-temple stood a chapel with a table and two
images of gold within it. Two altars stood outside of
this chapel. A similar temple was at Borsippa near
Babylon. It had seven stages, each decorated in one of the seven primary colors. Like all Chaldean temples,
and like the Great Pyramid of Egypt, the four corners of
this exactly corresponded with the four cardinal points of the compass.

THE Bible utterly,condemns all idol-worship. The'
people of Israel from their neighbors were con
standy learning of idols and were frequently led
away from the worship of Jehovah to that of false gods.
It will be profitable for us just here to turn aside and con
sider these gods. The people of Israel were descended
from an idolatrous race. Joshua wrote (Chap, xxiv., 2),
" Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood" (that
is, the River Euphrates,) "and they served other gods."
Rachel, when she left her father's home with Jacob, stole
her father's " teraphim." These were images connected
with magical rites and they were consulted as oracles in
later days. Laban says : " I have augured, or foretold by
observing signs." The teraphim were used in Israel
even in Ezekiel's time. Laban calls his teraphim his
gods. They were generally images with a man's head

and with bodies of various shapes, though they were quite
small, being often only about two or three inches high.
THE PLAGUES AND EGYPTIAN IDOLATRY.
The people of Israel strangely sought to blend the
worship of the true God and of idols, they " feared Jehovah and served strange gods." They worshiped
in turn very nearly all the gods of the Canaanites, Syri
ans, Assyrians and many of those of the Egyptians. They were accustomed to wear amulets and charms, which were supposed to place them under the protection
of the idol gods. (See Genesis xxxv., 4.) In Egypt the
people of Israel were more thoroughly tainted with false
gods, and it was a long while before they were cleansed
of the taint. To the gods of Egypt Moses flung down
the gauntlet of defiance. He dared their wrath and
defied their anger. In the punishments which God sent
upon Pharaoh and his people for their refusal to let
the children of Israel go, the plagues of Egypt, as we
call them, smote their most sacred symbols. At the com
mand of Moses, Aaron waved his rod over the Nile and
its waters were turned to blood and its fishes died. The
Nile was an object of worship to the Egyptians, as were
the crocodiles and some of the fish
living in its waters. The frogs, in the
next plague, were among the sacred
animals. It was a part of the Egyptian religion that the people and sculptured locust.
especially the priests, should keep themselves scrupu
lously clean, and the plague of the lice was a terrible
punishment. The great Egyptian beetle, the scara
baeus, was sculptured on all their monuments and was
an object of worship. The plague of flies or beetles was
another attack upon their religion. Selected animals



j^ EJiJiOR'S CHAINS.
among the cattle were worshiped. The murrain of beasts
fell upon them, their being gods as the Egyptians be
lieved them to be, could not avert the plague. The plague of boils and blains was another assault upon the
purity of their persons required by their religion. The
other plagues showed most effectually the utter inability
of the Egyptian gods to help their worshipers, and that
Jehovah, the God of Israel, was the one Supreme Being.
THE GOLDEN CALF.
With the remembrance of God's victory over the idol
worship of Egypt still fresh in their minds, the Israelites
soon fell into idolatrous ways. Their leader, Moses, was
absent in the mountain with God. He had gone thither
to receive the commands of God, the first of which was
an unqualified condemnation of all idolatry. As if to
show the necessity of this command, even while Moses was so engaged, the people were demanding of Aaron that he should make them an idol. The commandments
were given to warn Israel against sin. They were as a.
fence to keep them from falling into the mouth of hell.
The Israelites recalled the visible objects of worship to which they had been accustomed in Egypt, and besought
Aaron to make them gods. Weakly yielding to their
urgent request, Aaron asks for their golden ear-rings,
hoping, it may be, that they would not be willing to make
this sacrifice. With the gold thus furnished he cast a
"molten calf," the image of the Babylonish winged bull
Cherub. This he placed before the Israelites as the image of the God who had led them out of Egypt. He
then built an altar before the idol. In the name of
Jehovah, he proclaimed a festival. God is for this cause
exceedingly angry, but in answer to Moses' prayer He
finally spares the people.



IDOLATRY AMONG THE JEWS. 141
As Moses comes nearer to the camp of Israel, he hears
the sound of their revelry, and when his eyes behold the
disgraceful scenes attending the worship of the golden
calf, in his anger he throws the stone tablets containing
the commandments to the ground. He then causes the image to be ground into powder and strewn upon the water which the people must needs drink. Then came
the awful slaughter of
those who were not
loyal to Jehovah. Just
how far Israel had
looked upon the golden calf as a mere
symbol of Jehovah, it
is impossible to say, but God condemns
even the use of a symbol, though it may be
truly said that the
symbol is not itself
worshiped.
During- the rest of
their wandering in the
desert, the people did
not again commit the
sin of idolatry. The
terrible punishments
which had fallen upon
them were quite sufficient to deter them from it. Into the fearfully wicked worship of Baal-Peor, the
Israelites were led by the daughters of Moab. God sent
upon them an awful punishment for this sin also. During
the lives of Joshua and the elders they remained true to
their allegiance to Jehovah, but the following generation

remembered not the awful penalties God visited on
idolatry, and they were caught in the snare again.
BAAL-WORSHIP.
Baal was the supreme male divinity of the Phoenician
and Canaanitish nations. Ashtoreth was their female
divinity. The name Baal means lord. He was the sun
CTOcl. The name is een
erally used in connection
with other names, as Baal
Gad, that is Baal the For
tune-bringer ; Baal-Berith or Covenant-makinpf Baal; Baal-Zebub, the Fly-god.
The people of Israel wor
shiped Baal up to the time of Samuel, at whose re
buke they forsook this
iniquity for nearly a hun
dred years. The practice was introduced again in the time of Solomon, and it continued to the days of
the captivity.
During the life of all the
judges, Israel worshiped
Baal. As soon as Gideon
PHCENICIAN GODDESS ASTARTE. , J J ^1 t v
was dead, the Israelites, who had during his lifetime been less devout in this
direction, returned to it again with energy. As if in
mockery of the covenant made with Jehovah, they chose
to worship Baal-Berith, " Baal of the Covenant." We
are told that this Baal's temple was a fortress, and that
his treasury was filled with the silver brought in great



IDOLATRY AMONG THE JEWS. 143
abundance by his worshipers. Before the story of Sam
son is told the striking words are used, " the children ot
Israel did evil again in the eyes of Jehohah, and Jehovah
gave them again into the hands of the Philistines."
Idolatry was their national sin. From Judges xvii. and
xviii., we see that often the Israelites tried to carry on
both the worship of Jehovah and of idols, like the Saxon
king who is said to have had both an altar to Christ and
an altar to the devils
in his chapel-ca\ e.
Strange to say, Mo
ses' own son, Jona
than, was the priest
in the idol-temple ot
the gods of the tribe of Dan. These idols were destroyed by
the Philistines. It
was the custom of
heathen nations to
carry their idols be
fore them into bat
tle. Idolatry was not
due to popularity
alone, it was not followed merely as a fashion, for it was
often carried on secretly. (Isaiah Ivii., 8, and Hoseaix.,1,2.) Under Samuel idolatry was formally renounced by the
Israelites. But Solomon's foreiTM wives brouo-ht with
them the gods of their own nations. So the gods of Ammon, Moab and Sidon were openly worshiped ; three
of the summits of Olivet were covered with the altars of
Ashtoreth, Chemosh and Moloch, the fire-god. The of
fering of human sacrifice was a part of the worship of Moloch. The ceremony is supposed to have been as

follows : The priest stood on a platform in front of the idol, and while the people bowed down and murmured
their prayers, he placed in the hands of the idol the sacri
fice, frequently a little babe. By some cruel machinery
the idol's hands came together crushing the child, while
the musicians beat their drums to drown its cries. Rehoboam and Jeroboam both led Israel more deeply
into idolatry. Jeroboam erected golden calves, the statues
of the Egyptian god Apis, at Bethel and at Dan, To their use temples were devoted and services, copied prob
ably from the Mosaic ritual, were held. Incense and sacrifice was offered before them. Asa, and Jehosophat
after him, removed all the relics of idolatry.
With Ahab's coming to the throne, Baal's worship was
re-established. This was done at the request of Jezebel,
the Sidonian princess. Ahab did "more to provoke
Jehovah, God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of
Israel before him." From this time Baal-worship is inter
woven with all the life of Israel. The idolatrous priests became more and more numerous and important, being
patronized by the court and fed at the royal table. Finally
came the grand trial scene. As in Egypt long before, God was once more about to vindicate His supremacy. On Mount Carmel the trial took place.
" By scores, by hundreds, chanting to their god,
Clad in white stoles with frontlets of red gold, Baal's prophets marched. The crowd through all its myriad ranks was still, With wide, expectant eyes the king in front. Forth stepped Elijah; melancholy fire Burned in his swarthy-glowing eye; he looked

If Jah be God, then serve ye Him: if Baal, Then Baal.' The great crowd stretched to him, and rocked In mighty agitation to and fro. The gray crags caught his words, and echoed them To Carmel's crest; it threw them to the peak, Snow-crowned, of Lebanon, which tossed them far Along the surges of the boundless sea. He spake again : ' The God that answereth By fire, let Him be God.' As when a wave, That rears itself, a wall of polished glass.
For leagues along the shore, and hangs in air. Falls with one deafening crash, so rose the shout Of answering acclamation from the crowd. White-faced, with restless lips and anxious eyes, Baal'b prophets heard, their hundreds cowed and mute Before one man. They dared not, in mere shame, Decline the challenge. While the dusky gray

The hymns' last echoes died away ; the sun Burned with fierce heat, swift striding up the blue. Standing on that scorched hill, we felt his rays Prick like sharp spear-points. Then I heard again
Elijah's voice. I had been watching close Baal's prophets, but I now looked straight at him.
A fearful gleam was in his eye, a mirth Too stern, methought, for man of woman born
;
His glance was vexing those robed prophets more Than the sun's fire; and then h-e gave it words. 'Might he not spare one little spark, but one. Your fine god riding there,' he cried, 'to light Your sacrifice? He surely has enough ; He's burning you, if not your offering.

'A little louder,' smiled he, 'for perha,ps
In his warm chariot he has fallen asleep.' They leaped, they danced, they cut themselves with knives, Till the blood soaked their robes and poured in streams From their lanced foreheads. Then he laughed aloud
Great shouts of laughter, till the echoes rang From crag to crag on Carmel. 'Keep it up, Another dance !' he shrieked ; 'another song ! Leap rather higher ; never grudge some drops Of your dear blood, so precious in his sight. Ye know he is a god, ray reverend friends; How often have ye told the people so? Your pretty speeches and the miracles Which ye have shown them, these were not, of course, Mere lies accursed. He is a god, )'0u know. Louder, I say; he's old, perhaps, and deaf;
Out with your beards—that 's hopeful—crack your throats
In yelling chorus. Good, good—ha, ha, ha!' He rubbed his hands, waved wildly in the air His sheep-skin mantle, laughed until the tears Streamed down his face, and all his body shook AVith paroxysms of mirth and scorn. Ah me! That laughter sounded fearfully, and seemed
Not human in its fiery ruthlessness. But as b.e stood on Carmel, charred and gray, A dead land lay below, his native land; And the white corpse-eyes made appeal 10 him Against its murderers, murderers of the truth, Baal's lying prophets. Furthermore, I think That this Elijah is not to be judged
Like common men. The little rippling lake, Safe hid among the hills, can never know
The ocean's tempests. —So they writhed and tore, In ecstasies of grief and rage. At last

And washed the stones, and soaked the wood beneath
The sacrifice. He knelt upon the ridge, Against the golden, placid sky of eve ;
Brief, simple, clear, his words arose to heaven ; ' That God would testify unto Himself And to His prophet, and would turn the hearts Of His own people back
to Him again.' Scarce had he spoken, when a broad white
glare.
Scattering earth's light
like darkness in its

JEHOVAH'S TRIU^fPH OVER BAAL.



,.g ERROK'S CHAINS
In the white blaze the sun grew wan, and hung Like a pale moon upon the glimmering sky. The fierce flame licked the water up, the wood Crackled aloft, the very altar stones Glowed fiery red. The pillared smoke arose Through the hushed air in towering flawlessness, Then spread out calm and broad, like God's own face Breathing acceptance. But Baal's prophets shook In utter fear, and smote upon their breasts. And groveled, moaning, down into the dust. Clear broke the shout from that great multitude, •' Jah is the God ! Jehovah He is God ! ' Take them,' Elijah said ; ' let none escape.' We closed around Baal's prophets, thrust them down To where the thirsty Kishon slowly crawled. There made Elijah bare his arm, and score By score he slew them. From the heap of dead Oozed a broad rill of blood, that swelled the wave Of slumbrous Kishon."
This was a severe blow to this form of idolatry in
Israel for the time being. But in Judah, Baal continued to be worshiped. Baal and other gods were worshiped
at their own shrines. Ahaz built altars to them at every
corner of Jerusalem, and high-places in every city of
Judah, replacing the brazen altar of burnt-offering by one
made after the idol altar at Damascus.
The time for the final act in the drama of abominations
is at hand. The last scene opens with the captivity at
Babylon. One would expect that this terrible punish
ment would immediately cause Israel to turn to the true
God, but it did not. In the land of their captivity they
took to them foreigrn wives and with them their idols.
But there were, through all the history of the Jews, a
faithful few who adhered to the pure worship of one God.
Even at the time when Baal-worship was most prevalent there were 7,000 in Israel who had not bowed the knee



IDOLATRY AMONG THE JEWS. 149
to Baal (ist Kings, xxix., 18). Excepting these few, the chosen people were almost as much given to idolatry as
any nation around them. "Israel for many days had no true God, and no teaching priest, and no law" (2d Chron
icles, XV., 3).
Foreign wives, foreign allies, and the unnatural ten
dency to desire visible objects of worship caused this
prevalence of idolatry in the very nation to which God
made especial revelations of His character and purposes. In spite of God's promises and threats, commands and
entreaties, punishments and pardon, Israel still sinned. The false gods mentioned in the New Testament and some of those referred to in the Old Testament, will be
spoken of further on in describing the religions to which
they severally belonged.

CHAPTER VIII.
THE GODS OF GREECE.
There, where now, as we're by sages told,
Whirls on high a soulless fiery ball,
Helios guided then his car of gold,
In his silent majesty o'er all. Oreads then these heights around us filled, Then a dryad dwelt in yonder tree, From the urn of loving naiads rilled
Silver streamlets foamingly. i'RIEDRiCH VON SCHILLER.
THE religious system of the Greeks is the em
bodiment of beauty. No other worsliip that has
ever existed so encouraged the taste for art as
this. Its Hterature, its mythological stories, its idols and its
temples still control and, to a great extent, shape the art
ideas of the world. Its devotees have above all other
people possessed a perception of beauty of form and a
fondness for representing it. The people of Greece appear to have originally come
from the north-western part of Asia Minor. They were
called the Hellenes. The worship which they brought
from Asia was the worship of the " Heaven-Father," the
unseen one who dwells in ether, whose temple is the sky,
and whose altar is properly placed upon the mountain
top. The Hindus called the same being Dyaus-pitar;
the Romans, Diovis-pater or Jupiter; the Greeks, Zeus
pater. One can readily see the resemblance between
these names, and the evidence they bear to the fact that



THE GODS OF GREECE. j ex
these nations all came originally from one common stock.
As the primal Greek race separated into various parts
of Greece different forms began to arise. As sailors
from other lands arrived on their shores, they brouoht
their own gods with them, and thus many new gods were introduced into Greece.
The lively imagination of the Greeks and the out-door
life of their primitive state produced a number of tales
and legends about the gods. Some of these were based
on the tales with which their forefathers Vi^ere familiar in
their early home in Asia. The people lived in separate
villages. Wandering minstrels and merchants carried
these tales of gods and heroes from village to village. Poets then caught them up and adorned them with the
touches of a livelier fancy. Thus soon a rich and luxuri
ant system of legendary lore was in possession of the
whole people.
Just as is the case with other nations, the beings called
gods by the Greeks are but the personifications of the
powers and objects of nature, and the legends but repre
sent the courses of nature and its operations. To these
primitive notions imagination afterwards added, and po
etry clothed the whole with a warm glow. Thus was
formed the popular Greek faith.
ORIGIN OF THE WORLD AND OF THE GODS.
Accordino- to the ideas of the Homeric and Hesiodic
ages, it would seem that the world was a hollow globe,
divided into two equal portions by the flat disk of the
earth. The external shell of this globe is called by the
poets brazen and iron, probably only to express its solidity. The superior hemisphere was named Heaven, the
inferior one Tartarus. The length of the diameter of the
hollow sphere is given thus by Hesiod. It would take, he



,1-2 ERROR'S CHAINS.
says, nine days for an anvil to fall from heaven to earth;
and an equal space of time would be occupied by its
fall from earth to Tartarus. The luminaries which gave
light to gods and men shed their radiance through all the
interior of the upper hemisphere ; while that of the in
ferior one was filled with eternal gloom and darkness, and its still air was unmoved by any wind.
The earth filled the centre ot the universe in the form
of a round flat disk, or rather cylinder, around which the
river (the ocean) flowed. Hellas was probably regarded
as the centre of the earth ; but the poets are silent on
this point. They are equally so as to the exact central
point, but probably viewed as such Olympus, the abode
of the gods. In after times Delphi became practically the
navel of the earth. The sea divided the terrestial disk into two portions, which we may suppose were regarded
as equal. These divisions do not seem to have had any
distinctive names In the time of Homer. The northern
one was afterwards named Europe; the southern, at first
called Asia, alone, was In process of time divided Into Asia and Libya, the former comprising all the country
between the Phasis and the Nile, the latter all between
this river and the western ocean. In the sea, the Greeks appear to have known, to the
west of their own country, southern Italy, Sicily and
Spain, though their ideas respecting these countries were
probably vague and uncertain. The imagination of the
poets, or the tales of voyagers, had placed In the more
remote parts of It several islands, such as the Ogygian,
the Isle of Calypso ; the yEaean, that of Kirke ; the
^olion, that of yEolos; Scheria, the abode of the Phaea
kians—islands in all probability as ideal and as fabulous
as the isles of Panchala, Lilllput, or Brobdignag, though
both ancients and moderns have endeavored to assign



THE GODS OF GREECE. I e ?
their exact positions. Along its southern coast lay, it
would appear, the countries of the Lotos-eaters, the
Cyclops, the Giants and the LjEstrigonians. These isles
and coasts of^the western part of the sea were the scenes
of most of the wonders of early Grecian fable. There,
and on the isles of the ocean, the passage to which was
supposed to be closed to the island of Kirke, dwelt the
Sirens, the Hesperides, the Graecee, the Gorgons and the
other beings of fable, whose varied deeds make up the
ever interesting narratives of the ancient mythology.
The Greeks of the early ages knew little of any people
except those to the east and south of their own country,
or near the coast of the Mediterranean. Their imagination, meantime, had peopled the western portion of this
sea with giants, monsters and enchantresses ; while they
placed around the edge of the disk of the earth, which
they probably regarded as of no great width, nations en
joying the peculiar favor of the gods, and blessed with
happiness and longevity—a notion which continued to
prevail even in the historic times.
The entrance to the city or palace of the gods on
Olympus was closed by a gate of clouds kept by the
goddesses named the " Seasons ;" but the cloudy valves
opened spontaneously to permit the greater gods to pass
to and fro on their visits to the earth, thus linking with
earth's phases the approaches or departures of the gods.
Tartarus was unvisited by the light of day. It was
regarded as the prison of the gods, and not as the place
of torment for wicked men, beinrr to the eods what Ere
bus was to men—the abode of those who were driven
from the supernal world. The Titans, when conquered,
were shut up in it ; and in the Ilias, Zeus menaces the
subordinate and refractory gods with banishment to its
murky regions.



, cj . EHROJi'S CHAINS.
THE CENERATKINS OF THE GODS.
Chaos (void space) was first; then came into being
" broad-breasted " Earth, the gloomy Tartarus and Love.
Chaos produced Erebus and Night, and this last bore to
Erebus Day and Ether. Earth now produced Uranos (Heaven), of equal ex
tent with herself, to envelop her, and the mountains and
Pontes (Sea). She then bore to Uranus a mighty pro
geny—the Titans ; six males and six females. She also bore the three Cyclops and the three-hundred handed
ones, Hottos, Briareus and Gyges. These children were
hated by their father, who, as soon as they were born,
thrust them out of sight in a cavern of mother Earth, who,
grieved at his conduct, produced the substance of hoary
steel, and, forming from it a sickle, roused her children,
the Titans, to rebellion against him ; but fear seized on
them all except Kronos, who, lying in wait with the sickle
with which his mother had armed him, mutilated his un
suspecting sire. The drops which fell to the earth from
the wounds gave birth to the Erinnyes, the Giants and the Mehan nymphs ; and from what fell into the sea
sprang Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty.
Earth finally, after the overthrow of the Titans, bore
by Tartaros her last offspring, the hundred-headed Ty
phceus, the father of storms and whirlwinds, whom Zeus
precipitated into Tartarus.
Rhea was united to Kronos. Kronos, having learned
from his parents, Heaven and Earth, that he was fated
to be deprived by one of his sons of the kingdom which
he had taken from his father, devoured his children as
fast as they were born. Rhea, when about to be deliv
ered of Zeus, besought her parents to teach her how she
might save him. Instructed by Earth, she concealed him



THE GODS OF GREECE. j r r
in a cavern of Crete, and gave a stone in his stead to
Kronos. This stone he afterward threw up, and with it
the children whom he had devoured. When Zeus was grown up, he and tlie other children of Kronos made war
on their father and the Titans. The scene of the conflict
was Thessaly ; the former fought from Olympus, the lat
ter from Othrys. During ten entire years the conflict
was undecided ; at length, by the counsel of Earth, the Kronids released the Hundred-handed and called them to their aid. The war was then resumed with renewed
vigor, and the Titans were finally vanquished and im
prisoned in Tartarus, under the guard ot the Hundredhanded. The Kronids then, by the advice of Earth, gave
t'le supreme power to Zeus, who, in return, distributed
honors and dominion among the associates of his victory.
GODS OF THE GRECIANS.
Tne Greeks of the early ages regarded the lofty Thes
salian mountain named Olympus as the dwelling of their
gods. In the OcU^ssey, where the deities are of a char
acter far more dignified and elevated than in the Ilias, the
place of their abode shares in their exaltation ; and it may almost be doubted if the poet who drew the follow
ing picture of Olympus could have conceived it to be no
more than the summit of a terrestrial mountain :
" Olympus, where they sa)' the ever firm
Seat of the g.ods is, by the winds unshaken,
Nor ever wet with rain, nor ever showered
With snow, but cloudless ether o'er it spreads,
And glittering light encircles it around, On which the happy gods aye dwell in bliss."
Man loves to bestow his own form upon his gods, as
being the noblest that he can conceive. Those of Homer



•56 EJiJfOJi'S CHAINS.
are all of the human form, but of far larger dimensions
than men ; great size being an object of admiration both
in men and women in those early and martial ages.
Thus, when the goddess Athena ascends as driver the chariot of Diomedes,
Loud groaned the beechen axle with the weight, For a great god and valiant chief it bore;
when in the battle of the eods Ares is struck to the earth
by this goddess, he is described as covering seven ple
thra of orround ; the helmet of the troddess herself would,
we are told, cover the footmen of a hundred towns ; when
Hera is about to make an oath she lays one hand on the
earth, the other on the sea ; the voice of Poseidon and
Ares are as loud as the shout of nine or ten thousand men. The gods can, however, increase or diminish their size,
assume the form of particular men, or of any animals,
and make themselves visible and invisible at their pleas
ure. Their bodies are also of a finer nature than those
of men. It is not blood, but a blood-like fluid named
ichor, which flows in their veins. They are susceptible of
injury by mortal weapons ; the arrows of Herakles violate the divine bodies of Hera and Hades. Diomedes wounds both Aphrodite and Ares. They require nour
ishment as men do ; their food is called Ambrosia, their
drink Nectar. Their mode of life exactly resembles that
of the princes and nobles of the heroic ages. In the pal
ace of Zeus, on Olympus, they feast at the approach of
evening, and converse of the aftairs of heaven and earth;
the nectar is handed round by Hebe [youth) ; Apollo
delights them with the tones of his lyre ; and the Muses,
in responsive strains, pour forth their melodious voices in
sone- When the sun descends each grod retires to re



THE GODS OF GREECE. j e«
pose in his own dwelling. They frequently partake of
the hospitality of men, travel with them, and share in their
wars and battles.
With the form of men the Homeric gods also partake
of their passions. They are capricious, jealous, revenge
ful, will support their favorites through right and wrong,
and are implacable toward their enemies or even those who have slighted them. Their power was held to ex
tend very far; men regarded them the authors of both
good and evil ; all human ability and success was ascribed to them. They were believed to have power over
the thoughts of men, and could imperceptibly suggest
such as they pleased. They required of men to honor
them with prayer, and the sacrifice of oxen, goats, sheep,
lambs and kids, and oblations of wine and corn, and
fragrant herbs. When offended, they usually remitted
their wrath when thus appeased. The Homeric gods have all different ranks and offices
;
Olympus being, in fact, regulated on the model of a
Grecian city of the heroic ages. Zeus was king of the
region of the air and clouds, which had fallen to him by
lot on the dethronement of his father Kronos; the sea was the realm of his brother Poseidon ; the under-world
fell to Hades in the division of their conquests; earth
and Olympus were common property. Zeus, however,
as eldest brother, exercised a supremacy, and his power
was the greatest. The other inhabitants of Olympus
were Hera, sister and spouse of Zeus ; Apollo, the god of
music and archery; his sister Artemis, the goddess of the
chase^ and their mother Leto; Aphrodite, goddess of
love, and her mother Dione; Ares, god of war; PallasAthene, goddess of prudence and skill ; Themis, god
dess of justice; Hermoias, god of grain; Hebe, the
attendant of the Olympian king and queen, and Isis,

their messenger; Hephiestos. the celestial artist, and
Pseeon, the physician; and the Muses, the Graces and the Seasons. Poseidon was frequently there ; but Dem
eter, the goddess of agriculture, and Dionysius, the god
of wine, do not appear among the residents of Olympus. The Nymphs and the River-gods occasionally visited or
were summoned to it. Eos, Helios and Selene, rose
every day out of the ocean-stream, and drove in their
chariots through the air, shedding their cheering beams
abroad. All the dwellings of the gods upon Olympus were of
brass or copper, the metal which was in the greatest abundance In Greece. Hephaestos was architect and
smith; he formed all the arms, household furniture,
chariots and other articles in use amono- the Celestials;
but their dress, especially that of the goddesses, appears
to have been the workmanship of Pallas-Athene or of the Graces. The gold which proceeded from the work-shop
of Hephaestos was filled with automatic power; his stat
ues were endowed with intelligence; his tripods could
move of themselves; he made the golden shoes, or rather
soles, with whicli the gods trod the air and the waters, or
strode with the speed of winds, or even of thought, from
mountain to mountain upon the earth which trembled
beneath their weight. The chariots of the gods and their appurtenances were formed of various metals.
Tnat of Hera, for example, is thus described:
'Then Hebe quickly to the eliariot put
The rouml wheels, eight-spoked, brazen, strong
Axlt of iron. Gold their fellies were, And undecaying, but thereon of brass
The tires, well-fitting, wondrous to behold.
Of silver was the rounded nave of each ; The body was hung by gold and silver cords, And two curved sides encompassed it about.



THE GODS OF GREECE. j t
The pole was sih'cr, and upon its end She tied the beauteous golden yoke, and bound On it the golden braces fair ; the steeds, Swift-footed then beneath the yoke were led By Hera, eager for the war and strife."
These chariots were drawn by horses of celestial breed, ^vhich couki whirl them to and fro between heaven and
earth, through the yielding air, or skim with them along
the surface of the sea, without wetting the axle. They
were only used on occasions of taking a long journey,
as when Hera professes that she is going to the end of the earth to make up the quarrel between Okeanos and Tethys; or on occasions in which the gods wished to ap
pear with state and magnificence. On ordinary occa
sions the gods moved by the aid of their golden shoes
;
when at home in their houses, they, like the men of those
ages, went bare-foot.
The Greeks tell almost innumerable stories of their
gods, and their adventures, love-escapades and wars.
Some are wonderfully beautiful, others humble or gro
tesque. Their heroes come in for a share of the honors
paid the gods. We can compare these stories with the
legends of other nations, and see the wondroits resem
blance between them.
srECIMEN STORIES FROM GREEK MYTHOLOGY.
It will be possible to introduce but a few of the very
many Greek legends and myths. We choose to give a
tew fully, rather than to give many imperfectly.
HERMES AND APOLLO.
Hermes Avas born of the mountain-nymph, Maia, in a
cavern of Mount Kyllene, in Arcadia. He had scarcely
been laid in his cradle, when he got up and set off for



I 5q efror's chains.
Pieria, to steal cows from Apollo. As he was going out he met a tortoise, which he caught up and carried back
to the cave; when, quick as thought, he killed the animal,
took out the flesh, adapted reeds and strings to the shell, and formed from it the Phormin or Lyre, on which he
immediately played with perfect skill. He then laid it up
in his cradle, and resumed his journey.
He arrived by sunset in Pieria, where the oxen of the
gods fed under the care of Apollo. He forthwith separated fifty cows from the herd and drove them away, contriving to make them go backwards; and throwing away his sandals, bound branches of myrtle and tamarisk under his feet, that the herdsman-god might have no clew by which to trace his cattle. As he passed by Onchestos in
Ba^otia, he saw an old man engaged in planting his vine
yard, whom he strictly charged not to tell what he had seen. He then pursued his way by shady hills, resounding vales
and flowery plains, and as the moon was rising arrived
with his booty on the banks of the Alpheios in the Pelo
ponnese. He there fed and stalled his kine, made a fire,
killed, cut up, and dressed two of them, and even made
black puddings of their blood, and then thriftily spread
their skins to dry on a rock. He burned the heads and
feet, and put out the fire, effacing all signs of it, and flung
his twig-sandals into the river. With daybreak he slank
home and stole into his cradle, not unobserved by his mother, who reproached him with his deeds; but he re
plied that he was resolved by his actions to procure ad
mission for her and himself to the assembly of the gods.
In the morning Apollo missed his kine ; he set out in
search of them, and met the old man, who informed him
of his having seen a child driving cows along. He comes
to Pylos, where he sees the traces of his cnttle, but is
amazed at the strange foot-prints of their driver. He



THE GODS OF GREECE. i6i
proceeds to the fragrant cave of the nymphs, and Hermes
on seein"- him gathers himself up under the clothes,
afraid of the god. Apollo takes the key, opens and
searches the three closets where the nymph kept her
clothes, ornaments and food, but to no purpose. He
then threatens the child that he will fling him into Tar
tarus unless he tells him where the cows are ; but Hermes
stoutly denies all knowledge of them, and even very in
nocently asks what cows are. Apollo pulls him out of
the cradle and they agree to go and argue the matter
before Zeus. Arrived in Olympus, Apollo relates the theft, and tells what reasons he had for suspecting the
baby of being the thief. All this is, to the great amuse
ment of the Celestials, stoutly denied and its absurdity
shown by the little fellow, who still has his cradle clothes
about him. Zeus, however, gives judgment against Her
mes, and the two brothers are sent in search of the miss
ing kine. They come to Pylos, and Hermes drives the
cattle out of the cave. Apollo misses two of them ; to his
amazement he sees their skins on a rock, and is still more
surprised, when, on going to drive the others on, he finds
the art of Hermes had rooted their feet to the ground.
Hermes then begins to play on his lyre, the tones of
which so ravish Apollo that he offers him the cows for it.
The young god gives him the lyre, and receives the
cattle. The divine herdsman also gives him his whip,
and instructs him in the' management of the herds.
THE LOTUS-EATERS AND THE CYCLOPS.
Odysseus when on his return from Troy, encountered
a violent north-east wind, which drove him for nine davs,
until he reached the country of the Lotus-eaters. He
sent three of his men to see who the inhabitants were. These men on coming among the Lotus-eaters were



i6: SKKOJrS CHAINS.
kindl)- entertained by them, and given some of their
own food, the Lotus plant, to eat. The effect of this
plant was such, that those who tasted it lost all thoughts
of home and wished to remain in that country. It was ]))• main force that Odysseus dragged these men away,
and he was even obliged to tie them under the benches of
his ship.
Then he sailed to the westward and came to the land
of the Cyclops. These were a rude, lawless people, who
neither planted nor sowed, but whose land was so ferdle
as spontaneously to produce for them wheat, barley and
grapes. The)- dwelt in caves, and each without regard
to others governed his wife and children.
In front of one of their harbors lay a beautiful island,
well-stocked with goats. Leaving his fleet at this island,
Odysseus went with one ship to the mainland. Here
he entered the cave of a Cyclops, Polyphemus by name. When Polyphemus returned in the evening with his flocks and found strangers there, he asked who they were.
Odysseus said that they had been shipwrecked, and ap
pealed to his mercy and reverence for the gods. Poly
phemus cared for neither and he seized and killed and devoured two young Greeks. The door of the cave was
closed with an immense rock, so that, if they killed Poly
phemus, they could not have escaped, for they could not
move the rock. The next night, though, when Polyphe
mus was in a drunken sleep, they took his staff, which
was as large as a mast, heated it in the fire, and put out
his one eye. When the giant roared out with pain, the other Cyclops came to see what was the matter. Odys
seus had told him that his name was Nobody. .So when
he called out that Nobody was killing him, they thought him dreaming. Next morning when Polyphemus turned
out his sheep and goats, which were of great size, the



THE GODS 01' GREECE. 163
Greeks fastened themselves beneath their bellies and so
escaped. After they had put out to sea a little way,
Odysseus called oyt his true name, and the angry Cyclops
hurled great stones at him, and nearly destroyed his ship.
HERCULES' TWELVE TASKS.
In obedience to the god Zeus, Hercules was made to serve Eurystheus, who gave him twelve tasks to perform.
The first task was to bring the skin of an unconquerable
lion, the Nemean. Hercules choked the lion. The second task was to destroy the nine-headed hydra, or
water-snake. He cut off the heads, but two sprang up where one was cut off Then his companion with a
torch burned the necks v^here the heads were cut off by
Hercules the second time. The third task was to bring the golden-horned hind alive. He wounded and then caught her. The fourth task was to bring an immense
wild boar alive. The fifth task was to cleanse the immense
stables of King Augeas in one day. This he did by
mining the rivers Penios and Alpheios. The sixth task
was to drive away the stymphalid water-fowl. A god
dess gave him brazen clappers, the beating of which
made the birds rise from their hiding-places, when Her
cules destroyed them with his arrows. The seventh task
was to fetch the wild and furious Cretan bull. The eighth
task was to bring the Centaurs of Thrace. The Cen
taurs w^ere horses with the heads and upper half of the
human body. The ninth was to bring the girdle of the mighty queen of the Amazons. The tenth was to bring the purple-headed oxen of the Ruddy-isle. The eleventh
was to bring the apples of the Hesperides. After meeting
with various adventures he reached the place where they were, and while he upheld the heavens Atlas plucked the
apples, which Hercules, by a cute device, secured from him.



,g, BRKOIi'S CHAINS.
The twelfth task was to bring Cerberus from the underworld. All his tasks were accomplished. The whole
story of the hero Hercules is intensely interesting. '
THE PHIDIAN JUPITER.
Zeus—the Jupiter of the Romans—the chief, was the
earliest of the national gods. The great place of his worship was at Olympia. Here was the magnificent
statue of Jupiter, made by the famous Phidias. This
statue was sixty-five feet high. The frame-work, of cedar
and olive wood, Avas covered with ivory and gold. His
throne was of cedar wood, inlaid with ivory and precious
stones. In his right hand he held a statue of victory,
and in his left a sceptre surmounted by the eagle. The footstool was supported by sphinxes, and the throne was
of cedar wood, inlaid with ivory, the ebony pedestal was
covered with sculptured scenes of his life and adventures.
Probably no idol of ancient or modern times exceeds
this in its majestic, massive beauty. Neither ivory nor gold were plentiful in Greece, yet so devoted were the
people that they provided the immense quantity for this
idol readily. The gold plates were one-eighth of an
inch thick, and were worth then over ^600,000, equal to
an immense sum in our days. At Olympia, as at the
Isthmus ot Corinth, games were held at the yearly re
ligious festivals. From these games the apostle Paul

Paul, the Christian Missionary, came into contact with the heathenism of both Greece and Rome. In Athens,
Corinth and Ephesus especially he was brought face to
face with idols and temples. The story of his visit to
these places as told by Luke (Acts xvii., xviii. and xix.),

THE GODS OF GREECE. 167
and by Paul (in his letters to the Corinthians and Ephe
sians) presents a vivid picture of the condition of the
Greek religion in its latest development. Soon the whole
system was to lie in ruins, its temples were to be for
saken, its idols destroyed, its worship forgotten. This
mighty change was to be produced by the power of God working through one weak man, belonging to what was everywhere regarded as a narrow-minded race, and with
out any backing of pomp, or power, or wealth.
THE CITY CROWDED WITH IDQLS.
As Paul entered the gate-way of the Piraeus at Athens,
he was met immediately with the proofs of the intense
devotion of the Athenians to their worship. Before him
stood Minerva's temple and the image of Neptune, her
rival, seated on horseback, holding his trident. Passing
on he came, after a little, to the temple of Ceres with the
images sculptured by the far-famed Praxiteles. A little
further on his eyes must have fell upon Bacchus's temple and the images of Zeus, Minerva, Apollo, Mercury and
the Muses. All around him are temples, statues, altars
and shrines, and the news-seeking Athenians gather
about him. Every public place and building was ac
counted sacred. The market-place (the Agora) and the
Acropolis were crowded with temples and altars to the
gods, and even to deified virtues. There were altars to
Fame, to Modesty, to Persuasion and to Pity. And, lest they should by any chance leave out any god or being
who might help or injure them, they built an altar to An Unknoum God. With all their worship they had not found the true God.
The magnificent Parthenon—the Virgin's House—was
the glorious temple erected to Minerva's honor. Within
it was the colossal statue o^ ivory and gold, made by the



I 58 ERKOR'S CHAINS.
famous Phidias, rivaled only by the same artist's statue of
Jupiter. In the midst of all this idolatry, what thought
was in the mind of Paul? "His s^Dirit was stirred within
him when he saw the city crowded with idols." It was
said in those days that it was easier to find an idol in
Athens than a man. The Athenians led Paul away to the Areopagus. Here
the judges sat in the open air, upon seats hewn out of
the rock. A temple of Mars crowned the height. Be
fore Paul's view the whole city with its maze of temples,
shrines and statues, was spread out. The intensely earn
est Christian Apostle stood before the frivolous heathen
crowd. He is alone, yet not alone. His Master is with
him. He quails not, he minces no matters, he speaks
boldly, fearlessly. He recognizes their intense religious
ness (if we may so call it). He declares the truth that
the Deity does not dwell in temples made with hands, even with the hundreds of temples before him. With
the recollection of Phidias's famous statues fresh in mind
and the countless idols before his view he declares that
the Deity is not to be likened to forms in gold, silver or
stone, graven by art and man's device. The city is, ap
parently, scarcely moved, but the leaven has been put in, and soon the whole lump will be leavened. A few years pass by and the worship of Athen'; is only a remembrance. Close by Athens was one city whicn Paul visited and
where he founded one of the strongest Christian churches.
This city Avas held in bad repute in all the world on ac
count of its licentiousness. It was not only the seat of
wealth and splendor, but also a den of vice. "To Cor
inthianize" meant to play the wanton. The worship in the temple of Venus was of the most shameful character.
To the north-east of Corinth was the temple of Neptune,
where the celebrated Isthmian games were celebrated.

DIANA OF THE EPHESIANS.
Ephesus was the central city of Asia Minor. One of
its buildings ranked in importance above all others—the
Temple of Diana. This was reckoned as one of the wonders of the world, and the Ephesians were wont to speak of Diana as the goddess whom all the world worshiped. The temple had been once destroyed, and then
rebuilt with great magnificence. The ladies of Ephesus,
at its rebuilding, had given their jewelry. Alexander
offered immense riches to the Ephesians, if they would
but permit him to have his name inscribed on its walls ;
but they would not consent. This was the rallying-point
of heathenism in Paul's day. The temple was 425 feet
long, 220 broad, and its columns were 60 feet high. There
were 127 columns, each the gift of a king. Only a part
of it was roofed over, and this was with cedar. The re
maining parts Avere rich with statuary and columns. "It is
probable that there was no
building in the Avorld in
which was concentrated a greater amount of admira
tion, enthusiasm and super
stition."
The first statue of Diana
of Ephesus was a shapeless
black stone — an aerolite

which had fallen from
the sky. Afterwards her images were made of wood. She is covered with breasts ^^^dal of diana.
and with the heads of animals. She is supposed to
represent the natural fertility of the earth.
Diana was not worshiped in the temple only. Number

less little shrines, containing models of Diana in silver
or gold, or even wood, were made to be carried about
one's person, to be set up on household altars or carried
in processions. There was carried on at Ephesus an ex
tensive trade in these. The worship of Diana, in all its
parts and in all places, was conducted with great mag
nificence.
The Greek language and litei'ature and their temples
and statues, have been for centuries the models of the
world ; but their conceptions of the gods and their myths are no more thought of, and no longer regarded as of
authority in religious affairs. They are emphatically dead as powers over the morals of men.

THE WORSHIP AND GODS OF ROME.
" Within this grove, upon this wooded hill," He said, " some deity his dwelling made
;
But who or what, none knows. The Arcadians Think they have seen great Jove himself, when oft With his right hand he shook his darkening shield, And called his clouds around him." Virgil.

IONG before Rome was founded Italy was peopled
with an industrious class of farmers. But we
—^ have scarce any records of those early times.
Some of their gigantic buildings, lakes and canals re
main, but these are almost all that is left. The religious
ideas of these early settlers entered into and, to a great
extent, moulded the religion of the Romans. The
people of Italy did not have the same vivid imaginations
and lively fancies as the people of Greece. Their early
worship seems to have been of a more serious character than that of the Greeks. Their gods were freer from
moral taint, and virtue rather than vice was required in
followers of the Roman religions. The poetic art was
little cultivated among them, or for that matter, in Rome



of a later day. But Rome soon began to borrow from
Greece, and to appropriate her gods, heroes and myths. There arc no ItaHan myths corresponding to those of
(jreece. In Virgil and Ovid a few adventures of the
Italian gods are related, but these are plainly imitations
or slight modifications of the Greek stories.
TME ETRUSCAN RELIGION.
Before they became acquainted with Greece, the Ro
mans looked to the Etruscans as their instructors in re
ligious things. The disposition of the Etruscans was
melancholy and serious; their form of government a
rigid aristocracy, administered by an hereditary race or
caste of priestly nobility. Their system was founded on
some peculiar views of the world and its periods, and on
the art of learning the will of the supernal powers by
tlic thunder, the lightning, and other aerial phenomena.
Tlie rules and principles of this science were contained
in books ascribed to a subterranean dsemon named
Tages, who, the Tuscan legend said, had risen up, a babe in form, an aged man in wisdom, iVom under the soil
before the plow ot a peasant of Tarquinii as he was at
his work, and who instructed the people in divination.
According to the doctrine of the Etruscans there were
two orders of gods, the one superior, veiled and nameless,
with whom the supreme god took counsel when about to
announce by lightning any change in the present order
of things. The other consisted of twelve gods, six male
and as many females, his ordinary council. These' were
called by the common name of Consentes or Complices
(the Latin of the Etruscan word), according to Varro, because they are born and die together. The general Etruscan word for a god was ^sar.
The supreme god of the Tuscans, answerintr to the



THE H\)RSniP AND GODS OF ROME. 175
.Zeus of the Greeks, the Jupiter of the Romans, was named Tina. A goddess named Kupra was called by the Romans Juno ; and another, named Menerfa or Menrfa, was the original of the Minerva of Rome. These
three deities had always contiguous temples on the citadel
of every Etruscan city. Hence the united temples of Jupi
ter, Juno and Minerva, which crowned the capitol at Rome.
A oroddess named Nortia., answering- to the Roman
Fortuna, was worshiped at the Tuscan cities of Sutri and
Volsinii. Vertumnus also was one of the principal deities
of Etruria. The Tuscan god of the under-world, or
rather the ruler of the dead, it is said, was named Mantus,
and there was a goddess called Mama of a similar nature.
The Lares, or household gods, which form so conspicuous
a feature of the Roman religion, it is probable, belonged
•originally to the Etruscan system of worship.
THE SABELLIAN RELIGION.
The rigid virtues of a portion of the Sabellian race, par
ticularly the Sabines, were always the theme of praise
• at Rome. Grazing and agriculture were the chief em
ployments of these hardy tribes, and their religion was
intimately connected with these arts ; and consequently,
we may suppose, bore much resemblance to that of the
Latins. It has always been asserted that a great portion
of the Roman religion was of Sabine origin. The Sabines adored Sancus and Sabus or Sabinus, as
the founders of their nation. Mamers or Mars was
also one of their deities ; an erect lance was the symbol
before which he was worshiped. The Marsian portion of
this race were as celebrated for their skill in detecting the
will of the gods by the flight and voice of the birds, as the
Etruscans for discerning it in the electric phenomena of
the sky.



176 EKKOA^'S CHAINS.
THE GODS OF THE ROMANS.
There are very man)" gods in the Roman mythology,
of these some twenty have been called the select gods.
These are Janus, the two-faced sun-god; Jupiter (Diovis
pater or Father-Jove) ; Saturnus, the god of agriculture;
Genius, or the god of production; Mercurius, the god
who presided over the business of the market and over
trade in general. Apollo was a god introduced from the Greek mythology. Mars was the god ot war. Vulcan was the god of fire. Neptune was the god of the sea. Sol and Luna were the sun and moon god and goddess.
Orcas was the god of death, like the Hades of the Greeks, or Yama of the Hindus. Father Liber was the
god of the harvest. Tellus was the god of the earth.
Ceres was the goddess ot grain. Juno was the wife of Jupiter. Diana was the moon-goddess. Minerva was the goddess of arts. Vesta was the goddess oi the household. Venus was the goddess of birth.
lA'lIIEI-l JilVE.
The word Jove appears to have meant, originally, God.. It corresponds to Zeus of the Greeks and Dyaus of the
Hindus. Jove or fupiter was the especial protector of
the city of Rome. The chief Jupiter was called the Capitoline Jupiter. In his temple adorning the Capitol
In Rome were also statues of Juno and Minerva. Jupiter
Elicius was so named, we are told, from the following
circumstance. In the time of Numa there occurred great thunder storms and rains. The people and their king
were terrified, and the latter had recourse to the counsel
of the nymph Egeria. She informed him that Faunus. and Picus could instruct him in the mode of appeasing
Jupiter, but that he must employ both art and violence to

extract the knowledge from them. According-ly by her
advice he placed bowls of wine at a fountain on Mount
Aventine, whither they were wont to come to drink, and
concealed himself in a neig-hborino- cavern. The rural sfods
came to the fount, and finding the wine drank copiously
of it, thus illustrating in a striking manner the sensuous
character always supposed to dwell in these deities. They
immediately fell asleep, and Numa, quitting his retreat,
came and bound them. On awaking, they struggled,
but in vain, to get free ; and
the pious prince, apologiz
ing for what necessity had
oblio-ed him to do, entreated
that they would inform him
how Jupiter was to be ap
peased. They yielded to his
prayer, and on loosing them
drew down the thundering
Jupiter by their charms. He descended on the Aven
tine hill, which, trembled
beneath the weight of the
deity. Numa was terrified,
but recovering he implored
the god to give a remedy
against the lightning. The ruler of the thunder assented, and in ambiguous terms conveyed the relief: "Cut a
head,"—"of an onion from my garden" subjoined the
king,—"of a man," — "the topmost hairs" quickly re
plied Numa. —"I demand a life,"—"of a fish." The
deity smiled, and said that his weapons might thus be
averted, and promised a sign at sun-rise the following morning.




78 £JiKUJ\:'S CHAINS.
At dawn the people assembled before the doors of the
kini^r. Numa came forth, and, seated on his maple throne,
looked for the rising of the sun. The orb of day was just wholly emerged above the horizon, when a loud crash
was heard in the sky ; thrice the god thundered without
a cloud ; thrice he sent forth his lightnings. The heav
ens opened, and a light buckler came gently wafted on
the air, and fell to the ground. Numa, having first slain
a heifer, took it up and named it Ancile. He regarded
it as the pledge of empire ; and having had eleven others
made exactly like it by the artist Mamurius, to deceive
those who might attempt to steal it, committed them to
the care of the priests named Salii.
Jupiter was named Feretrius or Bearer, as the spoils of the enemy's general, if slain by a Roman commander,
were borne to him. He was also called Victor and
Stator, as the giver of victory and stayer of flight. We
also meet with Jupiter Pistor, whose altar was on the
capitol, and Jupiter Tonans, the author of thunder. In
the usual Roman manner, an historical origin was given
to all these names. Jupiter was called Lucetius, as the
author of light {lucis), and Diespiter, i. e., Dies Pater, or
Father of Day or of Light.
THE MATRON GODDESS.
Juno was the feminine of Jove—from Jovino we have
the word Juno. Juno was one of the great deities of
Rome and had a share in the worship of the magnificent
temple on the capitol. One Juno was called Juno Mon
eta, and her temple was finally made the mint, or coining
place for money. Female slaves swore by the Juno of
their mistress. As the patroness of married women, Juno was named Matrona. She presided over marriage. Whenever a child w^as born a piece of money was de



THE WORSHIP AND GODS OF ROME. j ^q
posited in her temple's treasury. In July of each year
Juno was honored by a sacrifice. Juno Sospita, the
Pi-otcctress, was represented with a goat-skin about her,
a spear in her hand, and a small shield on her arm. Juno
was generally represented armed, and the Romans usu
ally divided the hair of a virgin-bride with a small spear
point, thus invoking- the protection of this goddess.
THE GODDESS OF SCHOOLS.
All mental work was done under the direction of Minerva. Her statues were placed in the schools, and
in March of each year the school-boys had five days as
holidays in her honor. At the end of this vacation and festival the boys gave their school-master a present called
a Minerval. Minerva's chapel was under the same roof
as Jupiter's and Juno's on the Capitoline hill at Rome.
THE GODDESS OF THE HEARTH.
Vesta presided over the public and private hearth. In
Vesta's temple at Rome a sacred fire was kept burning
by six virgin-priestesses called Vestals. The Romans
believed that if they let this fire go out, the city's safety
would be destroyed. When, through the neglect of the Vestals, it did go out, they were severely punished and
the fire was relighted by the rays of the sun. In Vesta's
temple there was no statue of the goddess. At her
festival in June, plates of meat were sent to the Vestals
to be offered up, the mill-stones were decked with flowers and the animals working the mills went about crowned
with violets and with cakes strung about their necks.
CERES AND LIBER.
Ceres presided over seeds and harvests. She was the
goddess of the farmers. The country-folks before be

ginning harvest Icept feasts to Ceres, wlien tliey brought offeriags of honey-combs covered with wine and milk,
and an animal to be slain in sacrifice. The offerings were
o
taken three times around the corn-field, the country people
following", crowned with oak leaves and dancing- and sinp-
ing. These festivals were of the most joyous character. Liber means Deliverer. The god who had this name was united with Ceres in worship at Rome. The Romans worshiped their gods and goddesses generally in
groups of three; thus, Jupiter, Juno and Minerva in the
Capitoline temple; and Ceres, Liber and (the female)
Libera in the temple at the foot of the Aventine. In the
Capitoline temple the patricians or higher classes wor
shiped. In the Aventine temple the plebians or common people worshipped. There was much gross vileness
connected with all the festivals of Liber.
THE GOD OF BEGINNINGS.
Janus gives his name to January, the first month of
the year. He was the sun-god, and was usually wor
shiped at the beginning of any action. ^ He was regarded as the " opener of the
^^] day." Gates and doors were placed un
der the care of Janus, and their keeper is
even to-day called a janitor. Janus was represented with a key and a staff, and
was named the Opener and the Shutter.
Janus has two faces. An ancient statue of Janus stood in the Forum at Rome of
which the fingers were so formed that one hand represented three hundred in
Latin characters (CCC), and those of the other, fifty-five (LV.), making together the number of da3-s in the ancient lunar year.
JANUS



THE WORSHIP AND GODS OF KOlME. I8l
Under the Capitol, near to the Forum, in Rome, stood
ci short arch-way with a gate at each end. In times of
peace these gates were kept shut, in times of war they
were left open. In this arch-way a statue of Janus stood.
There Avas a tradition at Rome that once, when the ene
mies of Rome had attempted to enter the city by this gate, the god Janus had caused a stream of boiUng water -to gush forth from the earth, and so drove them away.
Rome's lesser gods.
Besides the sjods above referred to, there were gods
and goddesses of councils of war, of funerals, ot thieves
of the dawn, of fortune, of fields and cattle, of fruits and
flowers, and of a host of other things. But of all minor
gods, the Penates and Lares received most honor. These were the domestic gods. The Penates were so named from the place in which they were worshiped, the house
hold pantry. They were supposed to look after the wel
fare of the family. There were four classes of beings
from which men selected their Penates, those of heaven,
the sea, the under-world, and lastly, from the deified
souls of deceased ancestors. The deified spirits of de
parted ancestors were called the Lares, and they were
supposed to watch over the fortunes of their descend
ants. The Chinese also, from the earliest times, have
in a similar manner worshiped their departed ancestors.
THE ROMAN EMPIRE.
As Rome conquered the world the gods of the con
quered nations were gradually incorporated with their own. Thus an immense and involved system was
brought together. Soon, however, the gigantic structure
was to topple over before the coming of Christianity, as
Dagon had fallen before the coming of the ark of Jeho



l82 JiA-KOR'S CI/A/AS.
vah in ancient times. Just at this time, the Roman Em
pire was in the most favorable condition ior the introciuc
tion of Christianity. Within its limits there was a general
peace, great militar)' roads were built, piracy was sup
pressed, commerce and traffic generally increased, and.
travel was made safe and easy. Both the Latin and Greek languages were spread over east and west. But one
other point of preparation was of greater importance.
The deep and wide-spread corruption, brought about by. the heathen religions, seemed to be beyond human
remedy. Corruption, cruelty, sensuality and the most,
unnatural wickedness prevailed. The description Paul
gives in his letter to the Romans of the general life of
the people has been confirmed again and again. He
says :
"Because that, when they knew God, they glorified,
him not as God, neither were thankful ; but became vain
in their imaginations, and their foolish heart was dark
ened. Professing themselves to be wise, they became
fools, and changed the glory of the uncorruptible God
into an image, made like to corruptible man, and to
birds, and four-footed beasts, and creeping things. Where
fore God also gave them up to uncleanness, through the
lusts of their own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies between themselves: who changed the truth of God into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature more than
the Creator, who is blessed for ever. Amen. For this
cause God gave them up unto vile affections : for even
their women did change the natural use into that which
is against nature : and likewise also the men, leaving the
natural use of the woman, burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which is unseemly,
and receiving in themselves that recompense of their
error which was meet. And even as thev did not like to



THE WORSHIP AND GODS OI' ROME. 183:
retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a
reprobate mind, to do those things which are not con
venient ; being filled with all unrighteousness, fornica
tion, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness ; full of
envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity ; whisperers,,
backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, in
ventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, without
understanding, covenant-breakers, without natural affec
tion, implacable, unmerciful : who, knowing the judgment
of God, that they which commit such things are worthy
of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them^ that do them."
The investigations of the ruins of Pompeii and Hercu
laneum, the long buried cities, and the common accounts
of historians of Paul's day, all show that this picture was not at all overdrawn. There was a most terrible need of
Christianity just then to save the empire from falling to
pieces by reason of its rottenness. Milman most graph
ically pictures the change that Christianity gradually
wrought In the religious condition of Rome. He says
:
" Christianity was gradually withdrawing some of all
orders, even slaves, out of the vices, the ignorance, the
misery of that corrupted social system. It was even in
stilling feelings of humanity, yet unknown or coldly commended by An impotent philosophy, among men and
women whose infant ears had been habituated to the
shrieks of dying gladiators ; it was giving dignity to minds
prostrated by years, almost centuries, of degrading des>
potism ; it was nurturing purity and modesty of manner in
an unspeakable state of depravation; it was enshrining the
marriage-bed in a sanctity long almost entirely lost, and
rekindling to a steady warmth the domestic affections ; it
was substituting a simple, calm and rational faith for the
worn-out superstitions of heathenism ; gently establishing



184 ERROR'S CHAINS.
in the soul of man the sense of imniortahty, till it became
a natural and inextinguishable part of his moral being."
With this striking description of the historian, compare
the poetic lines of Matthew Arnold:
"On that hard pagan world disgust And sated loathing fell
;
Deep weariness and sated lust Make human life a hell. In his cool hall with haggard eyes The Roman noble lay, He drove abroad in furious guise Along the Appian way.
He made a feast, drank fierce and fast. And crowned his hair with flowers
;
No easier, nor no quicker passed The impracticable hours."



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 185
CHAPTER X.
OUR HEATHEN ANXESTORS.
To the Aryan of the West not merely the heavenly bodies, the sun,
moon and stars, or the earth with its trees and springs, its fountains, or the sea with its storms and calms, but all things visible, as organs and instruments of Deity, were deserving of reverent adoration. Nothing was too trifling. The quivering leaf, the crackling flame, the falling thunderbolt, the flight or song of birds, the neighing of horses, man's dreams and visions, even the movements of his pulse, all claimed attention, all might give some sign from the other world. All nature had a voice for the imaginative Teuton. The
skies, the woods, the springs, the well, the lake, the hill, were his
books, his oracles, his divinities. —G. F. Maclear.
IT sounds strange to us, who have been so long a
Christian people, to speak of a pagan ancestry.
We can hardly reaUze that the condition in which
we find the Japanese, or Chinaman, or Hindu of to-day,
is the condition in which our forefathers were to be
found not many centuries ago. Yet all traces of their
heathenish belief and practices are not yet extinct. In
our language, especially in many of our names, do we
preserve the relics of the heathenish life of our fore
fathers.
It is not easy to learn of the earliest religion of Britain,
as the records are still greatly beclouded. But recent
investigations of the mounds and relics of old England
and of the origin of English names, together with the
bringing to light of some valuable old records, have



i86 ERROR'S CHAINS.
helped greatly to clear up the subject. Before passing
to consider more particularly the ancient religious life of
Great Britain, let us fasten in our minds a few prominent
facts in the early history of that land.
ANCIENT BRITAIN.
Let us note several prominent parts in the early his
tory of Britain. First, the earliest inhabitants and their
religion, known as Druidism. Secondly, the invasion of
Britain by the Romans and the introduction of the in
vaders' religion. Thirdly, the introduction of Christianity.
Fourthly, the coming of the Saxons and the extinguish
ing of Christianity by the Saxon religion. Fifthly, the
coming again and final victory of Christianity. By fixing
these points in mind, we can without difficulty trace the
religious history of our ancestors.
In early times we find that the Greeks had intercourse
with Britain. The time when this trade was carried on
is fixed by different authors at periods varying from 500
B. C. to 200 B. C. Before even the first of these times,
by some hundreds of years, the Phoenicians of Tyre
visited Britain to purchase tin. These allusions to visits
of Greeks and Phoenicians are found in ancient Welsh tra
ditions handed down by the Druids. Indeed, some of
these traditions go back to a period shortly after the dis
persion of the nations, even beyond Abraham's day. Other traditions are found which relate even to the
deluge itself, as follows:
"There were three awful events in the Isle of Britain.
The first was the bursting of the Lake of Floods, and
the rushing of an inundation over all the lands, until all
persons were destroyed, except Dwyvan and Dwyvack, who escaped in an open vessel and from them the Isle of Britain was re-peopled.



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 187
"The three primary and extraordinary works of the
Isle of Britain: The ship of Nwydd nav Neivion, which
brought in it a male and female of all living things, when
the Lake of Floods burst forth; the large horned oxen
of Au the Mighty, that drew the crocodile from the lake
of the land, so that the lake did not burst forth any more ; and the stone of Gwyddon Ganhedon, upon which
all the arts and sciences of the world are engraven."
All this bears such striking similarity to the traditions
preserved among the most ancient nations in the east
ern part of the world, that we cannot conceive the pos
sibility of its having been invented in any period of the
dark ages; it therefore strengthens our confidence in the
general teaching of the Triads. In early Britain there
were only two classes of British citizens, "the nobles and
the villains," (i. e., villagers). All below these were
slaves. The people possessed a considerable knowledge of astronomy, of geometry and of mechanics. They were
an eloquent people; an ancient historian says that their
orators "sometimes step between two hostile armies, who
are standing with swords drawn, and spears extended,
ready to fight ; and, by their eloquence, as by an irresisti
ble enchantment, they prevent a shedding of blood."
The Britons were also aqquainted with the useful arts.
The houses in which they dwelt, their chariots of war, as
well as a great variety of other works, prove this beyond
the possibility of doubt. We notice the chariots : " Their
cars were admired by the Romans, adopted by individuals
for their journeys, and introduced by the public into their
races. And we have a picture of one of them, sketched by a British hand, and engraven on a coin. There we
see the charioteer mounted on his carriage before us, a
quiver of arrows peeping over his left shoulder, and a
ispear protended from his left hand, his feet resting upon



i88 /:a'A'oa".v chains.
the pole or foot-board annexed to it, and his body leaning
over the horses, in the act of accelerating their motion.
And we have the description ot another in Ossian, very
similar in one or two particulars, and more circumstan
tial. It is the car of a British monarch, bending behind,
drawn by a pair of horses, and embossed with sparkling
stones. Its beam is of polished yew, its seat of the
smoothest bone, and the sides of it are replenished with
spears. Persons who could construct such vehicles,
build houses and make furniture, as well as all the various
offensive and defensive weapons of war, must have had no inconsiderable mechanical knowledge and skill."
THE DRUIDS. WONDERFLL RESEMBLANCE.
We have reason to believe that the Britons inhabited
England not long- after the days of Noah. We might therefore expect to find resemblances between their re
ligion and the religions of other ancient peoples ; and we
are not disappointed. There is a striking correspondence
between the system of the ancient Britons and those of
the Hebrew patriarchs, the Brahmins of India, the Magi
of Persia and the Greek priests. It was one system that
was finally conveyed to these different parts of the globe.
Take, as a single instance of the many points of compari
son, their idea of God. Among their names for the su
preme God which they had in use before the introduction
of Christianity were terms which have been literally trans
lated, "God," "Distributor," "Governor," "the Mysteri
ous One," "the Eternal," "He that pervadeth all things,"
"the Author of Existence," "the Ancient of Days."
These expressive appellations sufficiently indicate their
views of the moral character and attributes of God. The opinion of the Druids as to the nature of God is compre
hensively explained by the following bold and remarkable



067? HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 189
aphorism : " Nid Dim Ond Duw, Nid Duw Ond Dim." It
defies translation so as to convey its force and beauty;
but William Owen has furnished a version sufficiently
plain to convey the idea: "God cannot be matter; what
is not matter must be Gocl." These were the attributes of
the God of the early Druids. They believed that the
Deity was the source of life, and the giver of good. They
defined His duration as eternal, and ascribed to Him
omnipotence as the measure of His power. And as they
found nothing in the animal creation or in man which had
any proportion or resemblance to God, they had neither
statues nor pictures to represent Him ; from which we
infer that they regarded God as a pure spirit, as disen
gaged from matter as He was exalted above all created thinors and above all resemblance to them.
o
WORSHIP OF THE DRUIDS.
The Druids offered sacrifices and observed particular
days for religious worship. Their sacrifices were care
fully selected, and they appear to have had clear views of
their propitiatory character. PHny, describing the gath
ering of the mistletoe, observes: "After they have well
and duly prepared their festival cheer under the tree,
they bring thither two young bullocks, milk white, such as never drew in yoke at plow or wain, and whose heads were then and not before bound by the horns
;
which done, the priest, arrayed in a white vesture^
climbeth up into the tree, and, with a golden hook or bill,
cutteth it off, and they beneath receive it in a white cas
sock or coat of arms. Then they fall to and kill the
beasts aforesaid for sacrifice, praying devoutly that it
would please God to bless this gift of His to the good
and benefit of all those to whom He had vouchsafed to
give it." These sacrifices were offered with very solemn



^qO EKJiOX'S CHAINS.
rites, the common people remaining at a distance, while
the priests approached with trembling awe the bloody
victims, which were carried around the omen-fire.
There is no branch of this subject which presents
itself in a more interesting aspect than that which relates
to the sacred places of this people, and the peculiar man
'
ner of their worship. They worshiped in the open air;
it being a maxim with them, that it was unlawful to build
temples to the gods, or to worship them within walls and
under roofs. Their favorite place was a grove of oaks,
or the shelter of a majestic tree of this kind. Here they
would erect stone pillars in one or two circular rows; and
in some of their principal temples, as particularly that of
-Stonehenge, they laid stones of prodigious weight on the
tops of these perpendicular pillars, which formed a kind
of circle aloft in the air. Near to these temples they
constructed their sacred mounts, their cromlechs or stone
tables for their sacrifices, and every other necessary pro
vision for their worship. These sacred places were
generally situated in the centre of some thick grove or
wood, watered by a consecrated river or fountain, and
surrounded by a ditch or mound, to prevent intrusion.
TEMPLE OF THE HANGING STONES.
One of the most extraordinary monuments of ancient
England, is that called Stonehenge. This is an AngloSaxon term, meaning the hanging stones. This monu
ment is situated on a small hill in the midst of a barren
plain. All around it funeral mounds are grouped. These
mounds are called "barrows," and within three miles of
Stonehenge there are over three hundred and fifty of
these that have been recently discovered. The stones that constituted this Druid temple are many of them
lying prostrate on the ground, a few only remaining up



OLA JlEATHhiV AiMJiSTORS. 191
right with the gigantic stone slabs across their tops. Yet
enough remains to indicate the general design of the
structure as it originally stood. It consisted of an outer
circle, about three hundred feet in diameter, of thirty



jQ^ ERiaOK'S CUATNS.
upright stones sustaining as many others laid horizontally on their tops. Within this was another circle of upright
ones, smaller than those in the outer circle, and without
any stones on their tops. These stones are so large that
it cannot be Imagined how they were raised to their lofty
position. It is very evident that Stonehenge was a place of worship, and from the number of grave-mounds, each
containing the remains of a number of bodies, it is evi
dent that it was a place of great sanctity. It has been
supposed that serpent-worship found a place here.
HUMAN SACRIFICES.
Caesar gives a very careful account of the Druids. In
the century just preceding the coming of Christ, Caesar
conquered the Britons. His account of their condition is the more reliable because this conquest put him in possession of the means of knowing the people who were
in the future to form a part of his empire. His testimony
can best be given in a translation of his own words. He
says
:
"All the Gallic nations are much given to superstition;
for which reason, when they are seriously ill, or are in
danger from their wars or other causes, they either offer
up men as victims to the gods, or make a vow to sacrifice
themselves. The ministers in these offerings are the
Druids, and they hold that the wradi of the immortal gods
can only be appeased, and man's life be redeemed, by
offering up human sacrifice, and it is a part of their
national institutions to hold fixed solemnities for this purpose. Some of them make immense images of wicker
work, which they fill with men, who are thus burned alive
in offering to their deities. These victims are generally
selected from those who have been convicted of theft,
robbery, or other crimes, in whose punishment they think



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 193
the immortal gods take the greatest pleasure ; but if there
be any scarcity of such victims they do not hesitate to
sacrifice innocent men in their place. If there be a super
abundance of cattle taken in war the surplus is offered up
in sacrifice ; the rest of the spoil is collected into one mass.
In many of their tribes large heaps of tliese things may
be seen in their consecrated places, and it is a rare occur
rence for any individual sacreligiously to conceal part of
the booty, or to turn it to his own use ; the s/sverest pun
ishment, together with bodily torture, is inflicted on those
who are guilty of such an offense."
He further speaks of the Druids in another place
:
" The Druids act in all sacred matters ; they attend to
the sacrifices, which are either offered by the tribe in
deneral or bv individuals, and answer all ciuestions con
cerning their religion. They always b.ave a large number
of young men as pupils, who treat them with the greatest
respect ; (or it is they who decide in all controversies,
whether public or private, and they judge all causes,
whether of murder, of a disputed inheritance, or of the
boundaries of estates. They assign both rewards and punishments; and whoever refuses to abide by their sen
tence, whether he be in a public or private station, is
forbidden to be present at the sacrifices of the gods.
This is, in fact, the most severe mode of punishment, and
those who have been thus excommunicated are held as
impious and jirofane ; all avoid them ; no one will either
meet them or speak to them, lest they should be injured
by their contagion ; every species of honor is withheld
from them, and if they are plaintiffs in a lawsuit justice is
denied. All the Druids are subject to one chief, who
enjoys the greatest authority among them. Upon the
death of the chief Druid, the next in dignity is appointed
to succeed him ; and if there are two whose merits are



IQ^ EKJ<OJ^'^ CHAINS.
equal, the election is made by the votes of the whole
body, though sometimes they dispute for pre-eminence
by the sword. "The Druidic system is thought to have had its origin
in Britain, from whence it was introduced into Gaul. . . .
Among the most important doctrines of the Druids is that
of the immortality of the soul, which they believe passes
after death into other bodies; they hold this to be a great
inducement to the practice of virtue, as the mind thus
becomes relieved from the fear of death. Their other
doctrines concern the motions of the heavenly bodies, the
magnitude of the earth and the universe, the nature of
things, and the power and attributes of the immortal
gods." Certainly Csesar's testimony is clear, and he
writes as one who had actually gazed upon the strange
and striking scenes which he describes.
THE DESTRUCTION OF DRUIDISM.
The religion of the Druids was handed down by tra
dition from father to son, and consisted in the proper
performance of certain rites and ceremonies. It has
been stated that the Druids worshiped Bel or Baal,
though this is sometimes questioned. On the eve of
May-day fires were lighted on their altars in honor of
their Supreme God. They had a set of doctrines which were publicly taught, and another set which were made known only to the inidated. The Druids were not gross
idolaters, though they regarded the oak, the symbol of God, with supersdtious awe. But the time for the death
of Druidism had come. Fifty-five years before Christ, the
great conqueror, Julius Ca;sar, landed in Britain. The
skillful and courageous Britons gave him a great deal of
trouble, and prevented his penetrating far from the shore.
Ertiperor after emperor sought to subjugate the Island



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 195
during the years that foHowed, but it was not until 130
years had passed away that Briton was really conquered
by the Romans. Agricola was sent in A. D. 78 to be
govenor of Britain. By his wise policy the whole life of the Britons was changed wherever it came under Roman
influence.
The dwellings of the Britons were very rude and
simple in the early ages, being mostly constructed of
hurdle or wicker-work, and afterward of large stones
without mortar. Their houses were generally round,
having the roof thatched, with a hole left in the centre
for the escape of smoke. The Romans, on the contrary, had long been accustomed to commodious and elegant
dwellings, well built of masonry, and adorned in the
richest manner with statues, pictures, elegant drapery and
handsome furniture. It was not while the Romans were engaged in con
quering Britain that their religion gained a foothold there, but after they had come to power and peace. The Druid
priests were destroyed, and the people, left thus without
religious teachers, gradually accepted to some extent the
then-existing forms of Roman faith.
WHO FIRST BROUGHT CHRISTIANITY TO BRITAIN?
While the Romans were busily seeking to conquer
Britain, an event of unparalleled importance took place.
It was the birth of Jesus, the Christ. Very nearly every
one of the early preachers who by any possibility could
have gone to Britain with the Gospel message, has been
declared to be the founder of Christianity there. The
Apostle Peter is declared, so says an old chronicle, "to
have stayed some time in Britain ; where having preached
the word, established churches, ordained bishops, priests
and deacons, in the twelfth year of Nero he returned to



196 EKRO/fS CHAINS.
Rome." But this, for many reasons, is not to be believed.
Joseph of Arimathea is also said to have first taken the
Gospel to Britain. But the whole narrative of his mis
sion is fabulous. A King Lucius is said to have sent
about 164 A. D. to Rome for missionaries, but this too is
questionable. One more question remains to be con
sidered. Did the Aposde Paul plant Christianity in
Britain? Tertullian, about the year 200 A. D., vi'rote that
the Gospel had spread "also to the boundaries of the
Spaniards, to all die different nations of Gaul, and to
those parts of Britain inaccessible even to the Romans." But more ancient than this is the testimony of Clement,
Bishop of Rome, 102 A. D. "St. Paul preached right
eousness through the v/hole world; and, in doing this,
went to the utmost bounds of the West."
A learned writer thus sums up all the evidence of
Paul's being the first to give the Gospel to Britain
:
"That St. Paul did go to Britain we may collect from the testimony of Clemens Romanus, Theodoret and Jerome, who relate that, after his imprisonment, he preached the
Gospel in the western parts ; that he brought salvation
to the islands that lie in the ocean, and that, in preaching
the Gospel, he went to the utmost bounds of the West
What was meant by the West and the islands that lie in the ocean, we may judge from Plutarch, Eusebius and
Nicephorus, who call the British Ocean the western; and
again from Nicephorus, who says that one of the apostles
'went to the extreme countries of the ocean and the
Bridsh Isles ;' but especially from the words of Catullus,
who calls Britain the utmost island of the West; and
from Theodoret, who describes the Britons as inhabiting
the utmost parts of the West. When Clement, therefore, says that Paul went to the utmost bounds of the West, we do not conjecture, but are sure, that he meant Britain,



OUR HEA THEN ANCESTORS. j gn
not only because Britain was so designated, but because
Paul could not have gone to the utmost bounds of the
West without going to Britain. It is almost unnecessary,
therefore, to appeal to the express testimony of Venan
tius, Fortunatus and Sophronius, for the apostle's journey
to Britain,"
PAGANISM OF THE SAXONS.
The religion of our Saxon ancestors was the same as
that of the whole German family. Christianity, which
had by this time brought about the conversion of the
Roman Empire, had not penetrated as yet among the
forests of the North. The common god of the English
people, as of the whole German race, was Woden, the
war-god, the guardian of ways and boundaries, to whom
his worshipers attributed the invention of letters, and
whom every tribe held to be the first ancestor of its
kings. Our own names for the days of the week still
recall to us the o-ods whom our Eno-lish lathers wor
shiped in their Sleswick homeland. Wednesday is Wo
den's day, as Thursday is the day of Thunder, or, as the
Northmen called him, Thor, the god of air, and storm, and
rain. Friday is Freya's day, the goddess of peace, and joy, and fruitfulness, whose emblems, borne aloft by
dancing maidens, brought increase to every field and stall they visited. Saturday commemorates an obscure
god, Soetere; Tuesday, the Dark god, Tiw, to meet whom was death; Eostre, the goddess of the dawn, or
the spring, lends her name to the Christian festival of the
Resurrection. Behind these floated the dim shapes of
an older mythology— "Wyrd," the death- goddess, whose memory lingered long in the "weird" of northern superstition, or the Shield Maidens, the 'mighty women," who,
an old rhyme tells us, "wrought on the battle-field their



£JiJWJ^'S CIJAINS.
toil, and hurled the thrilling javelins." Nearer to the
popular fancy lay the deities of wood and fell, or the hero
gods of legend and song, " Nicor," the water-sprite, who
gave us our water nixies, and "Old Nick," "Weland,"
the forger of mighty shields and sharp-biting swords, at
a later time, in his Berkshire, " Weyland's Smithy, " or
^gil, the hero archer, whose legend is that of Cloudesly
or Tell. A nature-worship of this sort lent itself ill to



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. .
the purposes of a priesthood, and, though a priestly class
existed, it seems at no time to have had much weight in
the English society. As every freeman was his own
judge and his own legislator, so he was his own house
priest; and the common English worship lay in the sac
rifice which he offered to the god of his liearth. The
religion of Woden and Thor supplanted, for the time
being, the religion of Christ. The new England was once
more a heathen land under the gods of its conquerors.
SAXON GODS.
The first of all the gods was Woden or Odin. He is
the All-father, like Dyans of the early Hindus, Zeus of the Greeks and Jove of the Romans. In the Volsung Saga, Woden is revealed as follows : King Volsung had
made preparation for an entertainment. Blazing fires
burned alone the hall, and in the middle of the hall stood
a large tree, whose green and fair foliage covered the
roof. It was called Woden's tree. Now, as the guests
sat around the fire in the evening, a man entered the hall whose countenance they did not know. He wore a
variegated cloak, was barefooted, his breeches were of linen, and a wide-brimmed hat hung down over his face. He was very tall, looked old, and was one-eyed. He
held in his hand a sword. He went to the tree, stuck his sword into it with such a powerful blow that it sunk
into it even up to the hilt. No one dared greet him. It was Woden. Woden's dwelling was called Walhal. The
Edda, the poem of the gods, thus describes Walhalla
:
"Easily to be known is. By those who to Odin come, The mansion by its aspect. Its roof with spears is held,
Its hall with shields is decked. With corselets are its benches strewed.



200 ERROR'S CHAINS.
"Five hundred doors And forty more Methinks are in Wallial, Eight hundred heroes through each door
Shall issue forth ! Against the wolf to combat."
The heroes are invited after death to Woden's hall.
That the brave were to be taken to Walhalla after death
was one of the fundamental points, if not the very heart
of the religion of the Northmen. They felt in their hearts
that it was absolutely necessary to be brave. Woden
would not care for them, but would despise and thrust them away from him, if they were not brave. This made the Northmen think it a shame and misery not to die in
battle. Old kings, about to die, had their bodies placed
in a ship ; the ship was sent forth with sails set, and a
slow fire burning in it, so that once out at sea it might
blaze up in flame, and in such a way worthily bury the
hero both in the sky and in the ocean. He lay in the
prow of his ship, silent, with closed lips, defying the wild ocean. As Boyesen has sung :
"In tlic prow with jicad uplifted Stood the chief like wrathful Thor; Through his locks, the snow-flakes drifted. Bleached their hue from gold to hoar, 'Mid the crash of mast and rafter Norsemen leaped through death with laughter Up through Walhal's wide-flung door."
Thor comes next to Woden. His name means thunder. He is the spring-god, subduing the frost-giants. Long
fellow has described the Norseman's idea of Thor, thus:
"I am the god Thor, I am the war-god. I am the Thunderer! here in my Northland,
My fastness and fortress, reign I forever !



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. jOI
"Here amid icebergs rule I the nations; This is my hammer, Mjohier, the mighty, Giants and sorcerers cannot withstand it!
"These are the gauntlets wherewith I wield it,
And hurl it afar off; this is my girdle, Whenever I brace it strength is redoubled!
"The light thou beholdest stream through the heavens, In flashes of crimson, is but my red beard.
Blown by the night-wind, affrighting the nations.
"Jove is my brother; mine eyes are the lightning; The wheels of my chariot roll in the thunder. The blows of my hammer ring in the earthquake!
"Force rules the world still, has ruled it, shall rule it; Meekness is weakness, strength is triumphant; Over the whole earth still is Thor's-day!"
SAXON SACRIFICES.
The sacrifices which were presented to the gods in
the early ages were very simple, and such as a people
in the first stages of civilization would offer—the first
fruits of their crops, and the choicest products of the
earth. They also sacrificed animals. They offered to
Thor, during the feast of Jaul, fat oxen and horses; to
Frieda, the largest hos' which they could procure; to
Odin, horses, dogs and falcons, sometimes cocks, and a fat bull. They even proceeded at times to shed human
'blood. The victims were usually chosen from captives
in time of war, and slaves during peace. After being
selected, they were treated with excessive kindness, until
the time of their execution, when they were congratu
lated on their happy destiny in a future life. On great
emergencies, however, nobles and kings were immolated
on the altars of the gods. On all these occasions the
priests took care, in consecrating the victim, to pronounce

SACRIFICIAL RITES OF THE ANCIKNT BRITISH DRUIDS.
certain words; such as, "I devote thee to Odin;" "I send
thee to Odin;" or, "I devote thee for a good harvest, for



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 20 >
the return of a fruitful season." The ceremony con
cluded with feasting, during which they drank immoder
ately. First, the kings and chief lords drank healths in
honor of the gods; afterward, every one drank, making song or prayer to the gods who had been named. After
the victim was slain, the body was burnt, or suspended
in a sacred grove near the temple ; part of the blood was
sprinkled upon the people, part upon the sacred grove.
With the same they also bedewed the images of the gods,
the altars, the benches and walls of the temple, both
Avithin and without, thus completing their work.
FAIRY-LORE OF WESTERN EUROPE.
The Saxons and their kindred, the Teutons and the
Celts, have a great mass of fairy tales, legends, hobgoblin
stories and the like. These tales enter more into the life
•of the people than we are accustomed to believe. While
the strontrer men, the soldiers of the race, told their old
Viking tales or recited their Edclas' poems, the common
people told over and over again the tales of the little beings who haunted hill and meadow, field and forest,
lake and river.
The tales and superstitions of the early Britons were
intimately related to their religious ideas, and exerted as
powerful an influence on their lives, as their belief in the
gods. So it is in keeping with our subject that we pro
ceed to present some of these fairy tales and legends.
Shakespeare has preserved ancient and quaint traditions
of the Fairies and Puck, and of Mab, Queen of the
Fairies, from which we quote.
"Fairy. —Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite Call'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not he That frights the maidens of the villagery,



204 ERROR'S CHAINS.
Skims milk, and sometimes labors in the quern, And bootless makes the breathless housewife churn;. And sometimes makes the drink to bear no harm
;
Misleads night-wanderers, laughing at their harm? Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet Puck, You do their work, and they shall have good luck, iVie not you he ?
Pud'. —'i'hou speakest ariglit, I am that merry wanderer of the night. I jest to Oberon, and make him smile, When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
Neighing in likeness of a filly-foal
;
And sometimes lurk I in a gossip's bowl, In very likeness of a roasted crab. And when she drinks, against her lips I bob, And on her withered durlap pour the ale. The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale. Sometimes for three-foot stool mistaketh me
;
1 hen slip I from her bum—down topples she,
And tailor cries, and falls into a cough ; And then the whole quire hold their hips and laffe,, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze and swear, A merrier liour was never wasted there.
O then, I see Queen IVLib hath been with you. She is the fairies' midwife ; and she comes, In shape no bigger than an agate stone On the forefinger of an alderman. Drawn with a team of little atomies, Over men's noses as they lie asleep :
Her wagon-spokes, made of long spinner's legs;. The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers ; The traces, of the smallest spider's web ; The collars of the moonshines' watery beams; Her whip of cricket's bone ; the lash of film; Fler wagoner, a small gray-coated gnat, Not half so big as a round little worm Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid : Her chariot is an empty hazel nut,
Mide by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Tune out of mind the fairies' coachmakers.



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. 205
This is that very Mab That plats the manes of horses in the night
;
And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, Which once untangled much misfortune bode. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, That presses them."
A few of the very many fairy tales once current in Old England and in Western Europe generally, may well be
p'iven here in illustration of their g-eneral character. •
AN ELFIN STORY.
There was one time, it is said, a servant girl, who was,,
for her cleanly, tidy habits, greatly beloved by the Elves,
particularly as she was careful to carry away all dirt and
foul water to a distance from the house, and they once invited her to a wedding. Everything was conducted in
the greatest order, and they made her a present of some chips, which she took good-humoredly, and put into her
pocket. But when the bride-pair were coming, there was
a straw unluckily lying in the way ; the bridegroom got
cleverly over it, but the poor bride fell on her face. At
the sight of this, the girl coula not restrain herself but
burst out a-laughing, and that instant the whole vanished
from her sight. Next day, to her utter amazement, she
found that what she had taken to be nothing but chips
v/ere so many pieces of pure gold.
THE PENITENT NIS.
It is related of a Nis, who had established himself in a
house in Jutland, that he used every evening, after the
maid was gone to bed, to go into the kitchen to take his
groute, which they used to leave there for him in a large
wooden bowl.
One evening, he sat down as usual to eat his supper



206 EJiROJi'S CHAINS.
with a good appetite, drew over the bowl to him, and was
just beginning, as he thought, to mals;e a comfortable
meal, when he found that the maid had forgotten to put
any butter in it for him. At this, he fell into a furious
rage, got up in the height of his passion, and went out
into the cow-house and twisted the neck of the best cow
that was in it ; but as he felt himself still very hungry, he
stole back again to the kitchen to take some of the groute,
such as it was, and when he had eaten a little of it he
perceived that there was butter in it, but that it had sunk to the bottom under the groute. He was now so vexed
at his injustice toward the maid that, to make good the damage he had done, he went back to the cow-house and
set a chest full of money by the side of the dead cow, where the family found it next morning, and by means of
it got into flourishing circumstances.
NIXES.
The Nixes, or Water-people, inhabit lakes and rivers. The man is like any other man, only he has green teeth. He also wears a green hat. The female Nixes
appear like beautiful maidens. On fine sunny days they
may be seen sitting on the banks, or on the branches of the trees, combing their long golden locks. When any person is shortly to be drowned the Nixes may be pre
viously seen dancing on the surface of the water. They
inhabit a beautiful region below the water, whither they
sometimes convey mortals. A girl from a village near
Leipsic, as the story goes, was at one time at service in
the house of a Nix. She reported that everything there
was very good ; all she had to complain of was that she
was obliged to eat her food without salt. The female
Nixes frequently goto the market to buy meat; they are always dressed with extreme neatness, only a corner of



OUR HEATHEN ANCESTORS. g^^
the apron or some other part of their clothes is wet. The
man also occasionally goes to market. They are fond of
carrying off women, of whom they make wives. From
the many tales of the Nixes we select the following,
which are fair specimens of the whole.
THE PEASANT AND THE WATERMAN.
A Waterman, or Nix, once lived on good terms with a
peasant who dwelt near his lake. He often visited him, and at last begged that the peasant would make a visit to
his house under the water. The peasant consented, and went down witn him. There was everything down under
the water as in a stately palace on the land—halls, cham
bers and cabinets, with costly furniture of every descrip
tion. The Waterman led his guest over the whole, and
showed him everything that was in it. They came at length
to a little chamber, where were standing several new pots turned upside down. The peasant asked what was in
them. " They contain," was the reply, " the souls of drowned people, which I put under the pots and keep them close, so that they cannot get away." The peasant made no remark, and he came up again on the land. But
for a lonsf time the affair of the souls continued to sfive
him great trouble, and he watched to find when the Waterman should be from home. When this occurred, as he had marked the right way down, he descended into
the water-house, and, having made out the litde chamber,
he turned up all the pots one after another, and immedi
ately the souls of the drowned people ascended out of the water and recovered their liberty.
THE WONDERFUL LITTLE POUCH.
At noon, one day, a young peasant sat by the side of a wood, and, sighing, prayed the gods to give him a mor
13



208 EHROR'S CHAINS.
sel of food. A dwarf suddenly emerged from the wood,
and told him that his prayer should be fulfilled. He then
gave him the pouch that he had on his side, with the as
surance that he would always find in it wherewithal to
satisfy his thirst and hunger, charging him, at the same
time, not to consume it all, and to share with any one who
asked him for food. The dwarf vanished, and the peas
ant put his hand into the pouch to make a trial of it, and
there he found a cake of new bread, a cheese, and a
bottle of wine, on which he made a hearty meal. He
then saw that the pouch swelled up as before, and, look
ing in, he found that it was again full of bread, cheese
and wine. He now felt sure of his food, and he lived on
in an idle, luxurious way, without doing any work. One
day, as he was gorging himself, there came up to him a
feeble old man, who prayed him to give him a morsel to
eat. He refused in a brutal, churlish tone, when instantly
the bread and cheese broke, and scattered out of his
hands, and pouch and all vanished,
CHRISTIANIZING THE SAXONS.
According to widely-accepted tradition, when but a
young deacon, Gregory the Great had noted the white
bodies, the fair faces and the golden hair of some youths
who stood bound in the market-place at Rome. " l^Yom
what country do these slaves come ?" he asked the traders
who held them. "They are English, Angles !" the slave
dealers answered. The deacon's pity veiled itself in
poetic humor. "Not Angles, but angels," he said, "with
faces so angel-like! From what country come they?"
"They come," said the merchants, "from Deira." " De
ira!"was the untranslatable reply; "aye, plucked from
God's ire, and called to Christ's mercy ! And what is the
name of their king?" ".^lla," they told him; and Gre



OUR ilEATHEN ANCESTOKS. 20Q
gory seized on the words as a good omen. "Alleluia shall be sung there," he cried, and passed on, musing how
the angel-faces should be brought to sing it. Years went by, and the deacon become Bishop of
Rome, when the Christian princess, Berctas' marriage to the King of England gave him the opening he sought.
He at once sent a Roman Abbot, Augustine, at the head of a band of monks, to preach the Gospel to the English
people. The missionaries landed A. D. 597, on the very spot where Hengest had landed more than a century
before, in the Isle of Thanet ; and the king received them
sitting in the open air, on the chalk-down above Minster, where the eye nowadays catches, miles away over the
marshes, the dim tower of Canterbury. He listened to the long sermon as the interpreters whom Augustine had brought with him from Gaul translated it. " Yourwords'
are fair," yEthe^berdt replied at last, with English good
sense, " but they are new and of doubtful meaning." For
himself, he said, he refused to forsake the gods of his
fathers, but he promised shelter and protection to the strangers. The band of monks entered Canterbury
bearing before them a silver cross with a picture of
Christ, and singing in concert the strains of the litany of
their church. "Turn from this city, O Lord," they sang, "Thine anger and wrath, and turn it from Thy holy
house ; for w^e have sinned." And then, in strange con
trast, came the jubilant cry of the older Hebrew worship,
the cry which Gregory had wrested in prophetic earnest
ness from the name of the Yorkshire king in the Roman
market-place— 'Alleluia !"
Thus was begun the overturning of the heathen faith
of our ancestors, and the establishment of Christianity among them.

BRAHMINISM, AMONG THE HINDUS.
The Hindu mind still superstition sways Still to his Triune God the Brahmin prays; The laws of "caste" each generous hope restrain, And bind all mental powers with palsying chain.
Still lives that old belief the Saniian taught,
Insects and brutes with human souls are fraught. Souls doomed to wander for uncounted years. Till, pure from earthly dross, they seek the spheres. Nicholas Michell,
INDIA is almost a continent like Europe. It is shaped
like a great triangle. Its population amounts to
240,000,000. There are different races in India.
First came to the fertile valleys of the Indus and Ganges the sturdy immigrants from Central Asia, from Tartary and Thibet. These were Scythians, some of them Mongo
lians. Then came the Hindu people, the great family of
the Aryans, who separated themselves from their Persian
brethren sometime near 2,000 B. C, and gradually overspread all India. About 500 B. C, Darius Hystaspes conquered the Indian Empire. Alexander the Great in
vaded it as far as the Indus in 327 B. C. The Mohammedans drove the Parsees from their Persian home about 1,100
years ago, and a small body of them settled in India. Then came the Mohammedans (Arabs, Turks, Afghans and Moguls) and conquered India for a time. There are
now 41,000,000 of Mohammedans in that land. Still later
came Europeans, led thither by the prospects of great

commercial gains, the Portuguese, the Danes, the Dutch,
the French and, finally, came the English.
Over one hundred dialects are spoken in India, but
there is only one sacred language and one sacred litera
ture. This is the Sanscrit. All the Hindu sacred books,
all the sacred knowledge
of Hindu theology, phil
osophy or law, all the
Hindu creeds, opinions,
customs, etc., are recorded
in this language. This lan
guage of their literature
does not change with the
course of time, it remains
the same now as ever.
SKETCH OF BRAHMINISM.
Brahminism grew out of
what is called the Vedic re
ligion. Before Abraham's
day the people living in
Central Asia, being a sim
ple race, addressed their j
prayers to the powers of
nature, as, for example, to
the storms, the clouds and
the sun, seeing the Deity
in each of these. Hymns
were written to these gods
and this forms the earliest of all sacred books, only ex
cepting those from which Moses wrote his account of the
early history of the world in Genesis. This people moved
south into India. The priesthood arose and the other
Vedic books of ceremonies, sacrifices and liturgical foims

2J2 EJiJiOJi'3 CHAINS.
were prepared. Great commentaries were written on
these books, and all were declared to be inspired.
The priests quarreled with the civil chiefs, but their
sacred character was increased by the conflict, and caste
is the result. The priests are the highest caste (or class),
next come the warriors, then the merchant, the farmer,
etc., last of all the tanners, buriers of the dead, etc. These classes never intermarry or intermingle in any
way; it is contaminating to sit together even. About
this time idols appear, and gods multiply until they reach
the number of 330,000,000. Men groaned under this stupendous system of oppressive idolatry. Buddha tried
in the seventh century before Christ, to reform it, but he
failed, though he succeeded in establishing a new faith which has numbered its converts by the hundreds of mil
lions. But Brahmihism continues to be the religion of
India, even until to-day. The task of Christianity to
supplant it is gigantic, and rendered doubly difficult by
the failure of Buddhism. In later days a new reformer appeared, Rammohun Roy. He started the Brahmosomaj, or reformed Brahminism, but under his successor,
Keshub Chunder Sen, it is drifting toward Christianity.
Starting from the Veda, Hinduism has ended in em
bracing something from all religions, and in presenting
phases suited to all minds. It is all-tolerant, all-com
pliant, all-comprehensive, all-absorbing. It has its spiritual
and its material aspect, its esoteric and exoteric, its sub
jective and objective, its rational and irrational, its pure
and its impure. It has one side for the practical, anodier
for the severely moral, another for the devotional and
imaginative, another for the sensuous and sensual, and
another for the philosophical and speculative. Those
who rest in ceremonial observances find it all-sufficient;
those who deny the efficacy of works and make faith the

one requisite, need not wander from its pale ; those who
are addicted to sensuality may have their tastes fully
gratified ; those whose
delight is in meditating
upon the nature of God
and of man, or the rela
tions of matter and of
spirit, the mystery of sen
arate existence, or up(
the origin of evil, m;
here indulge their lo
of speculation. And this
capacity for almost limit
less expansion causes almost numberless sectar
ian divisions even among
the followers of any given
particular line of doctrine.
Yet there remains much
of the old nature-wor
ship, or more correctly
speaking.of theolddev I worship among the Hin
dus even at this late
day. As in Tinnevelly the people worship a stone devil,
who holds a trident in one hand, and a child which he
was about to devour in the other. The idol generally
has a garland of red and white oleander flowers on its
head and shoulders.
DEVIL WORSHIPED IN TINNEVELLY.
THE GODS OF HINDUISM.
The three idols sculptured on the walls of Elephanta
Cave are found all over India, and constitute the chief gods which are worshiped by the Hindus.



214 EKRUR'S CIIAJNS.
All the human race is said to have come from the
highlands of Central Asia, and the worship of these, our
Aryan forefathers, was at first exceedingly simple. Their
manner of life brought them into close contact with na
ture, and we learn from the hymns then written, many of
INDRA, COD OF THE AT.MOSPHERE,
which are still preserved in the Vedas (the sacred book
of the Hindus), that they regarded the powers of nature
as manifestations of gods. In the storms, they supposed
these rival gods were quarreling. In the Vedic hymns,
frequent mention is made of the chief god, called Dyaus,
the " Heavenly Father." Also Aditi, the " Infinite Ex

panse," is called the mother of all gods. Next comes
Varuna, the " Sky in its Brightness," then Indra, the god
of the "Atmosphere;" so running through the whole list.
After a time, the names of the gods are somewhat al
tered, and a sort of trinity is formed. Agni, god of fire,
becomes Brahma ; Surya, the sun-god, becomes Vishnu,
and Indra, the atmosphere-god, becomes Siva. These
constitute what is called the Tri-murti, and are generally
said to represent one god as Creator, Preserver or De
stroyer. Hindus often write in their honor verses like
the following:
" In those three persons the one God was shown

Each first in place, each last—not one alone; Of Siva, Vishnu, Brahma, each may be First, second, third, among the Blessed Three."
As to which of the three gods is to be called the Su
preme Being, opinions difter. The following story is told
in one of the sacred books touching upon this point
:
STORY OF THE SAGES' SEARCH.
A dispute arose among the sages as to which of the
three gods was greatest ; so they applied to the great
Bhrigu, one of the ten Maharshis, or primeval patriarchs
created by the first Manu, to determine the point. He
undertook to put all three gods to a severe test, and went first to Brahma; on approaching whom he pur
posely omitted an obeisance. Upon this the god's anger
blazed terribly forth ; but, restraining it, he was at length
pacified. Next he repaired to the abode of Siva, In
Kallasa, and omitted to return the god's salutation. The
vindictive deity was enraged, his eyes flashed fire, and
he raised his trident to destroy the sage ; but the god's
wife, Parvati, fell at his feet and by her intercession ap
peased him. Lastly, he repaired to Vaikuntha, the heaven

of Vishnu, whom he found asleep with his head on liis
consort Lalcshml's lap. To make a trial of his forbear
ance, he boldly gave the god a kick on his breast, which
awoke him. Instead of showing anger, however, Vishnu
arose, and on seeing Bhrigu, asked his pardon for not
having greeted him on his first arrival. Next, he ex
pressed himself highly honored by the sage's blow (which
he declared had imprinted an indelible mark of good
fortune on his breast), and then inquired tenderly whether his foot was hurt, and proceeded to rub it gently.
•" This," said Bhrigu, " is the mightiest god ; he over
powers by the most potent of all weapons—gentleness
and generosity." This idea was not far removed from the genius of Christianity, which conspicuously encour
ages the overcoming of evil with good.
CAN THE GODS DIE ?
One of the most remarkable ideas to be found in the Brahmanas is that the gods were merely mortals till they
extorted immortality from the Supreme Being by sacri
fices and austerities. A natural or inherent immortality
in these deities was never dreamed of it is said
:
"The gods lived constantly in dread of Death

The mighty Ender—so with toilsome rites They worshiped and repeated sacrifices Till they became immortal. Then the Ender Said to the gods, 'As ye have made yourselves
Imperishable ; so will men endeavor To free themselves from me ; what portion then Shall I possess in man?' The gods replied, ' Henceforth no being shall become immortal In his own body ; this his mortal frame
Shalt thou still seize ; this shall remain thy own He who through knowledge or religious acts Henceforth attains to immortality
Shall first present his bv^dy, Death, to thco.' "

SECTS OF HINDUISM. .
It must not be supposed that the heathen reHgions pre
sent one unbroken front agrainst the oncominsf i"anks of
Christianity. Christianity is divided into sects, it is true;
but these sects are but as the different regiments and
divisions of an army. The banner of the Cross is at the
head of the whole of this grand army, and it floats proudly
over each regiment; the regimental banner is always
placed beneath, and not above, the banner of the Cross»
Hence the various denominations of Christians are not
so many distinct bodies, fighting each other as well as
fighting the common foe; but they are so many bands of
soldiers, fighting, perhaps, each in its own way, yet all aiming to destroy the one common enemy, Satan and his
works. But the divisions of heathen religious systems,
differ greatly from this. Many of them are so different
from each other that there is hardly a trace of resem
blance remaining. Each heathen religious system wages, war against every other one. Buddhism is, perhaps, an
exception to this, at least in its mode of warfare, for it
seeks to swallow up every other system, to incorporate
all other religions in its own and to destroy them by the
change. In each of these systems, as well as in Hindu
ism, which we have now before us for consideration,
there are many different sects. These vary very much
more than the denominations of Christendom, and are
constantly turning their guns upon each other. Thus
God is making Satan to defeat himself, and will bring
good to the world even out of the wicked one's work.
The sects of Hinduism overlap each other. Many
Hindus are attached at the same time to several sects^,
and some of the gods are worshiped by all the sects in common. Following the national tendency of all heathen.

relio-ious systems, Hinduism developed downwards.

prominent point in their faith, and setting all the other
points far in the background.
During all the period from 800 to 500 before Christ,
the need of making peace offerings to the gods was in
sisted upon by certain sects. According to the creed of
one popular sect, for example, if one should slay a hun
dred horses in sacrifice, he would be worthy of being exalted to the rank of a powerful god. Thousands of
animals, principally horses, cows, pigs, and the like, were
slain every clay at this time. The whole land was filled^
with blood. Then came the reaction, a new sect arose,,
who, disgusted and wearied of sacrifices and sacrificing
priests, declared all sacrifices as unnecessary and dis-
pleasing to the gods. The followers of Kali, the god
dess of blood, and especially the Thugs, who came intO'
prominence later on and who are described in connection'
with the worship of Kali, of course opposed this idea.
Yet they were unsuccessful, their rival sect rapidly
gained the popular favor, and, except at Kali's altars,,
sacrifices almost disappeared. The great reformer, Bud
dha, the "Light of Asia," gave great assistance to this
doctrine. He taught, about the seventh century before
Christ, that it was the duty of man to preserve life, and
not to destroy it. The teaching that the souls of men
after death passed into the bodies of animals also aided
in this. Buddha's teachings gained almost universal ac
ceptance in India for a time; it looked as though it would
root out Hinduism. But gradually the Hindu priests
brought Buddhism back unto itself again. The priests declared that Gautama, the Buddha, was an incarnation of the god Vishnu, and by this concession won their way
to the hearts of the people. Each of the gods had their
own followers, and, as may be imagined, the sect that worshiped Vishnu received many new adherents.



ERAHMINISM AMONG THE HIND US. 221
After this, Hinduism rapidly descended to its darkest,
deepest degradation. Priestcraft was extended, rites
were multiplied, and superstitious customs increased. For long years the people groaned under their heavy
burdens, then sought—as, alas ! how often they sought,
but only to fail—to get back to the high ground of a purer religion. Reformers
appeared, and the people
gladly and quickly gather
ed around these reformers,
thus forming;- new sects.
To set forth the whole his
tory of these sects would
require volume after vol
ume. In a general way,
we may say that there are "ftA
five large sects: the fol- ?
lowers of Siva, of Vishnu,
of Sakta, the sun worship
ers, and the adherents of Ganesha. We might well
add to these, and to the
multitude of minor sects
into which they are di
vided, the greatest of mod
ern sects, which is called
the Brahmo-Somaj. In the year 1774 was born a man of marked ability, named Rammohun Roy. He sought to suppress the Suttee, the burning of Hindu widows with the bodies of
their dead husbands. He encouraged native education and the general enlightenment of the whole people. He
went back beyond the teachings of priests and of the

modern cacrcd Mindu books, back to the Vedas, and sought to prove that they taught that idolatry was wrong,
and that one god slioukl be worshiped. To this Supreme
Beinof he cfave the name of Bralima, and hence his sect of reformed Hinduism was called the Brahma or Brahmo
Somaj, or Society of God. After his death, several
other leaders arose, the last of whom, the third from Rammohun Roy, named Keshub Chunder Sen, v/as, perhaps,
most in accord with the founder's spirit. He visited
England lately. Under his leading the society is offering
an uncompromising opposition to caste, idolatry and
superstition, and is accomplishing the best results.
PRINCIPLES OF HINDUISM.
Hinduism as a system has nothing to say about making men better, it only tells of means to make peace with
angry gods. It speaks only threatening and fear. But
worse than this—and it would corrupt our pages to do
more than mention it—much of its worship is vile; vulgar
images are common objects of worship in India.
Its teachings as to the next world and the way to reach it are remarkable. There is supposed to be a wide stream between this world and the next, and the only
way to cross is by holding on to the tail of the sacred
cow when dying.
One terrible feature of Hinduism is Caste. Every
Hindu child is born within a certain caste, and above or
below that it can never go. It is a most rigid system
requiring the members of one caste to have as litde as
possible to do with the members of another. The four
principal castes are— the Priest or Brahmin caste; the
Warrior caste; the Merchant caste; the Sudras, or Ser
vile caste; besides these are the Pariahs, who are below
all caste. Some of the castes distinguish themselves by

No one, however, rich, or learned, or skillful, can rise

above his caste, no one, however poor, or degraded, or
vicious, sinks below his caste. Each caste looks up to^
those above it, and concedes its superiority.
A CASTE-MARKF.D BRAHMIN AT HIS DEVOTIONS.
A Brahmin who had become a Chrisdan, once told a
celebrated traveler, that the people of lower castes than
his own had often asked him to stop and wash his feet in
the water of the street, so that they might drink it! The
whole system, this traveler goes on to say, is a cold and cruel thing, which hardens the heart against natural com
passion. Against its oppression there is no power oL



BRAHMINISM AMONG THE HINDUS. 22
resistance; it extinguishes every element of human
brotherhood. Hinduism is, take it all and all, one of the
vilest, most despotic, most degrading systems of religion.
In almost every other taith there is some redeeming
feature; in Hinduism we seek in vain to find any element
of truth. There
is nothing in it worthy of being
placed in compar
ison with Chris
tianity. Yet the
task of persuading the Hindu people
of this is a very
difficult one. The
missionary seems
as but a youthful
David with his
slinsr and stones in the presence of this very Goliath of Heathenism. But he has God standing with him,
and by His aid the
work will finally be
successful. GOD OF HELL, FROM A HINDU PICTURE.
HUMAN BEINGS KILLED IN SACRIFICE.
Very early in the history of the Hindu religion, human
beings were sacrificed to the gods. Both children and
adults were slain before Kali's altars, especially. Sacrifice
of human beings is referred to in the sacred books ; for
instance, it appears in the following Brahmana
:



22b ERROIi'S CHAINS.
King Hariscandra had no son ; he then prayed to Var
una, promising, that if a son were born to him, he would
sacriiice the child to the
eod. Then a son was born to him called Rohita. When Rohita was grown
up, his father one day told him of the vow he had made to Varuna and bade him prepare to be sacri
ficed. The son declined
to be killed, and ran away
from his father's house.
For six years he wandered
in the forest and at last met a starving Brahmin. Him he persuaded to sell one of his sons named Sunahsepha, for a hundred cows. This boy was bought by Rohita and taken to Hariscandra and
was about to be sacrificed
to Varuna as a substitute for Rohita. At this moment,
on praying to the gods with verses from the Veda, the boy
was released. Some of the Hindu gods are, in accord
with this idea, horrible imaginations, as the god of Hell.
In contrast with such, is Amadeo, god of Love, the cupid
eod of the Hindus. But the Hindus were averse to human sacrifice, and so they found a way to get around it. They introduced
this, passage into their sacred books:
The gods killed a man for their victim. But from him
thus killed, the part which was fit for a sacrifice went out'

and entered a horse. Thence the horse became an ani
mal lit for beuio- sacrihced. The Sfods then killed the
horse, but the part of it fit tor being sacrified went out of
it and entered an ox. The trods then killed the ox, but
the part of it fit for being sacrificed went out of it and
entered a sheep. Thence it entered a goat The sacri
ficial part remained for the longest time in the goat
;
thence, it became pre-eminently fit for being sacrificed
!
HOW HINDUISM REGARDS WOMAN.
Every one ot the heathen religions more or less de
grades woman. Often she is made the slave of man, or,
worse still, the creature to minister to his appetites.
Only Christianity seeks to lift woman to the level of
man. Women in Christian lands rarely ever appreciate
the low condition ot tiieir Oriental sisters. In India, wo
man's condition is worse than in China, and in China
worse than in Japan. In the early religious writings of
the Hindus, woman is spoken of with respect ; but in
later days those teachings have been all but torgotten.
Indeed, the degradation of woman in India—not merely
sanctioned, but commanded, by the Hindu religion—is
without a parallel in any age and among any other race. According to the Code of Manu, the law-book of the
Hindu religion, woman is forbidden to read the sacred
books or to offer up prayers or sacrifices in her own
name and person. She may pray and worship, but only
as her father or husband directs. Woman is regarded
as having no soul, differing from the beasts only in being
more intelligent than they. Moreover, she is commanded
to revere her husband as a god. If a Brahmin, or priest, happens to be reading the ^^edas (the sacred Hindu books), and a woman happens to come near, he must suspend his reading until she pass by.

Her ear is not pure enough to hear the sacred word, they
say. They were kept secluded from sight in ill-furnished
apartments ; really, they were kept prisoners in the

confirmed their truth. What is the picture that is drawn
by these faithful pens of the Hindu woman's Hfe from the
cradle to the grave ? Girls are never welcomed in India.
Formerly a large number were destroyed at birth, but
now the British government prevents that. But they are
as badly off in many cases worse, than if dead. Their
very existence is almost unnoticed by their father. Ask
A CHILD BRINGING AN OFFERING TO THE IDOL OF A BULL.
•a Hindu how many children he has —supposing that he
have three sons and four daughters—he will reply, " I
have three children," not thinking it worth while to count
his daughters. Formerly at least seventy-five out of
every hundred female infants were destroyed. These
infants were generally cast to the crocodiles in the Gan
ges, and, strange to say, the mother thought she was

serving Heaven in doing this unnatural deed. The great,
linguist, Dr. John Le)den, has written :
" To glut the shark and ( rocodile A mother brought ber infant herej She saw its tender, playful smile, She shed not one maternal tear. She threw it on a watery bier
;
With grinding teeth sea-monsters tore
The smiling infant that she bore.
She shrunk not once its cries to hear !"
From childhood they are taught to worship the idols,,
especially Ganesha, the god of wisdom, and so the stone
bulls.
After a little girl has reached her fitth birthday, her
parents begin to look tor a husband tor her. She can
be married when seven years old but may wait until she is ten. The idea of marrying tor love is never dreamed
of. The little one never makes her own choice of a hus
band. Her married lite bears not the slightest resem
blance to the life of a wife in a Christian land. The
Shasters declare that a wife, "When in the presence of
her husband, must keep her eyes upon her master, and
be ready to receive his commands. When he speaks,
she must be quiet, and listen to nothing else besides ;
when he calls, she must leave everything else, and attend upon him alone. A woman has no other god on earth
but her husband. The most excellent of all good works
that she can perform is to gratify him with the strictest
obedience. This should be her only devotion. Though
he be aged, infirm, dissipated, a drunkard or a debauchee,
she must still regard him as her grod. She must serve
him with all her might, obeying him in all things, spying
no defects in his character, and Pfivingr him no cause for
disquiet. If he laughs, she must laugh ; if he weeps, she



BRAHMINISM AMONG THE HINDUS. 23T
must weep ; if "he sings, she must be in an ecstasy." The
wife may never walk with her husband. No other man than he or her father or
brothers must ever look on her face. A Hindu woman
would rather die than to
be thus defiled, as they are
taucfht to reoardit.
Woman in India is in the power of her husband com
pletely; she is his slave, and
must wait on his every mo
tion. Worse than this, she
is not the only wife, for Hinduism permits a man to have many wives. When her hus
band dies, the wife is more
unhappy than ever. All her ornaments and beauti
ful clothing are taken from
her, and only a poor, coarse,
brown robe is left; her black
hair is shorn off^ and the
tali—answering to our mar
riao-e-rino^—is taken from
her. Henceforth, if she live,
she must practice the sever- ^ \
est penance. Often, before '^'^-z^
the British government put ='
a stop to it, the widow was ^
burned alive with the dead body of her husband. For all this degradation and
misery and shameless treatment of women Hinduism is
responsible.

shrines and idols. The rivers are sacred, trees are wor

The temple-courts are filled with chattering monkeys,
and here and there we see the sacred bulls, garlanded
with flowers and fed by the devotees. There is no end,
seemingly, to their temples and idols. Probably no
country in the world has more of these than India. It is
one of the marks of heathenism to multiply the objects
and places of worship. Of course, we cannot here make
mention of all these, we can but describe a few of the
more important, which may serve as specimens of the
rest.

temples placed three together, one of blue, one of white and one of yellow. Juggernaut has many temples; the one at Puri, on the western shore of the Bay of Bengal,
being the largest, and esteemed the most holy. This
pagoda stands at the end of the principal street of the
city, which is very wide, and lined with dwellings for the
priests, small shrines and other sacred buildings. The
wall which surrounds the temple is 21 feet high, and
forms an inclosure 650 feet on each side. The principal

is being placed before the gods, all but a favored few
are excluded from the temple, and the doors are shut_
There are over 20,000 holy men connected with this
temple, and we can easily guess that they help the idols
to get rid of this great mass of food, at any rate it all
speedily disappears. The idols, strange as it may seem,,

many of them die in consequence of excessive fatigue,
exposure to the annual rains, and the want of suita
ble and sufficient food. The plains, in many places,
are literally whitened with their bones, while dogs
and vultures are continually devouring the bodies
of the dead. At the appointed time each idol was washed, dressed in silk and gold, and placed upon his
triumphal car. The car of Juggernaut consists of an
elevated platform, thirty-four feet square, supported by
sixteen wheels, each six and a half feet in diameter. It
is covered with cloth of gold and costly stuffs, and a Jug
gernaut is placed under a canopy. Six ropes, or cables,.
300 feet in length, are attached to the car, by means of
which the people draw it from place to place. The
whole car is covered with sculptures in the Hindu style.
Thousands seize these ropes, as many as could get
hold. In their fanatical frenzy they crowded and shouldered and shoved one another, counting themselves happy
if they could only lay a hand on the ropes. The Car
Festival was the great event of the religious year of the
worshipers of Juggernaut. Its object was to convey
Juggernaut from the temple to his country house, a mile
distant. When the image was placed in the car the mul
titude fell on their knees and bowed their foreheads in
the dust.
As the car began to advance the drums- beat and cym
bals clashed, while from its platform the priests shouted,,
harangued and sang songs, which were received with
applause by the multitude. And so the dense mass, tug
ging, sweating, singing, praying, dragged the car slowly along. Some were knocked down and trampled upon, and some were accidentally crushed by the ponderous
wheels, while a few, mostly those who were sick or in
much trouble, sought death by throwing themselves in

the way of the wheels, this latter being encouraged by
some of the priests. The priests and priestesses chanted
songs in praise of the gods, the muldtudes flung flowers
and other gifts about the car. Such was the Great Car-Festival of Juggernaut in an
cient days. Of late years it has lost much of its popu
larity, and though thousands sdll attend annually, it is now looked upon more as an annual fair than a religious
festival. The devotees are not half so zealous as form
erly, and the priests find almost no one to drag the car.
No lono-er do any self-made victims fall beneath its
wheels, unless it be some poor, weak wretch, tired of life
and desirine thus to commit suicide. The British o-qv
ernment has caused much of this change, but more has
been done by the influence which Christian missionaries have exerted upon the
people. The "Lord of
the World," as they call
this idol, shall yet bow be
fore the Lord of Lords. From this acount of Juggernaut and his wor

see the terrible degradation which Hinduism im

idol's heart. Contrast this with the teachings of the
Bible concerning Him whom the heaven of heavens
cannot contain ! Juggernaut s worshipers regard him as a thing whom they are to keep from getting angry by
petting him and caring for and feeding as for a little
child; that He is a being who needs such things as
clothing to protect and food to sustain Him, and who needs to be washed, and to retire to a summer resort to
escape the summer's heat.
A striking illustration of the inferiority of idols is given
in the incident pictured below. Several converts from Hinduism concluded to undress and disjoint their idol,

and finally they chopped up the several parts and used
them for firewood, thus more than fulfilling the words of
Isaiah (chap, xliv., 9-20), who tells of idolaters making an
idol of parts of their wood and burning the residue to
warm themselves and to roast their meat.

KALI, THE GODDESS OF BLOOD.
Kali is a very popular goddess, and yet her images are
the pictures of terror. She wears a head-dress of snakes,
and a necklace con
sisting of a chain of
skulls. In her hand
she holds a murder
ous-looking knife.
Kali is the wife of
Siva, the destroyer. In September a fes
tival is held in her
honor, called the
Doorga-pooja. In
all of Kali's temples
her idols are gayly
adorned with flow
ers, and prayers are
offered to her dur
ing days of dancing
and singing. There used to be a sect of murderous
stranglers, known as Thugs, who were THE GODDESS KALI. especially devoted
to the worship of Kali, and who performed their murder
ous work as a religious service to that goddess. The story
of this people opens up a chapter of the greatest cruelty,
going far beyond all the ordinary records of crime. Yet it
was all done from a relio-ious motive, as well as for love of
plunder. Strange that it could be so ! The legend that
accounts for their origin is as follows : A long while ago

a giant demon infested this world destroying mankind.
The goddess Kah, to save mankind from utter destruction, attacked this demon and cut him down ; but from
the drops of blood that fell to the ground immediately
there sprang up other demons—a host of them. Then Kali
created two men, to whom she gave handkerchiefs, and
whom she taught to strangle the demons without shed
ding blood. This was done, lest if their blood be shed
more demons should spring up. Kali intended in this
way to destroy the whole brood. When these men had
strangled all the demons, she bade them strangle men
in the same way, to repay her for her service to man
kind. From these two men the Thugs came.
The Thugs were born such; at each one's hearthstone
his children were trained to the work of becoming mur
derers. The handkerchief with which the victim was
strangled, and the pick-axe with which his grave was dug,
were obtained from the priest, and were regarded as very sacred. Their method of procedure was like this : They
waited about the inns or loitered alongr the roads waiting
for travelers to overtake them. The Thug and his in
tended victim would journey together, and, little by little,
he would worm out of him all his plans and intended movements. Thus the Thug could decide on the most
suitable place and time. When they came to this, he
would throw his strip of cloth about the unsuspecting
stranger's neck and draw it tighter and tighter until he
was suffocated. If the Thugs traveled together with a
party of merchants, each selected his victim, and all were
strangled together. After death a hole, a^bout three feet
deep, was dug, and the corpse was buried face down
wards. The greatest care was taken to shed no blood,
and the whole was generally done under cover of the darkness of night. The whole sect was so banded to

Thugs. In the year 1826 die British government first
discovered their existence. During the period of some



HINDU TEMPLES, IDOLS AND WORSHIP. 245
nine years over fifteen hundred of the Thugs were
arrested and executed. The sect is very nearly destroved
now. How astonishing that such a sect should not
merely exist, but that they should perform their dastardly
deeds as a relisi^ious service. The cannibalism of the
barbarous South Sea Islanders is reoarded with the great
est abhorrence ; but their ignorance and degraded condition lessens our condemnation of their abominable deeds.
For the Thugs, an intelligent people, living in a semi
civilized land, with opportunities of getting knowledge
far in advance of the Islanders of the Pacific, we can see
almost no reason for hesitating to condemn most strongly
their awful practices. What a contrast is here furnished
between the religion of Jesus Christ, with its teachings of mercy and love,
and the religion that
not only tolerated,but
even taught, that to

Kah is one of the most celebrated goddesses of all the

people of Calcutta. Her images are very different, but she

tree. This ooddess of destruction beino- more feared than
all others, is worshiped more than all. She is represented
sometimes as standing on a lion or a prostrate man,
always with four hands. These hold knives or skulls, or,
perhaps, human heads, as already noticed Often she
wears a necklace of skulls. The Hindus bring to her
idols the first fruits of the garden, vineyard or orchard.
Some of Kali's temples, like that at Calcutta, are beau

BENARES.
True Hindus consider the city of Benares to be
situated in the
very centre of the
earth, and to be
the most sacred
•city in the world.
There are not
less than 80,000
Brahmins, or "holy caste"
Hindus, residing
here, and the city
also is stocked
with the so-call
ed " sacred bulls and sacred mon
keys."
BAS-RELIEF FROM A HINDU TEMPLE.
There are more than 1,000 temples and over



2C2 EJilWR'S CHAINS.
500,000 enshrined deities. More than 100,000 pilgrims,
visit Benares annually, 20,000 of whom may be seen
rushinsj at one time into the River Ganges, at a oiven signal, that they may bathe at the proper moment. The
river is reached by flights of broad steps, and on these
the Hindus pass the busiest hours of the day, bathing,
dressing, saying their prayers, lounging and gossiping.
Benares is believed by some to be 80,000 steps nearer
to heaven than any other part of the world. Ten miles
around Benares is said to be such holy ground, that who
ever dies within this area is sure of going to heaven,
however great a sinner he may have been.
THE SACRED CITY OF THE SIKHS.
Umritsur, in North-western India, is the holy city of
the Sikhs. This is a sect of reformed Hindus, who at
first rejected idolatry, but who afterwards found its fasci
nation too strong for them. In the centre of a larg-e tank

called the Lake of Immortality, because whoever bathes
in it is shielded from everlasting death—is a temple of
pure white marble, with a roof made of plates of copper,
richly gilded ; this is called the Golden Temple. Before
crossing the bridge or causeway to the temple, one must
put off the shoes from his feet, so holy is the place.
The Sikhs are very fanatical, and they do not receive
visitors with any expressions of friendliness. The city of
Umritrur has no celebrity apart from this temple. The
sect of the Sikhs originated about the middle of the fif
teenth century, and now numbers about 5,000,000.
TAVE-TEMPLES OF ELEPHANTA AND GWALIOR.

and chapels are all cut irom the one great mass of stone.
For three hundred years past there has been little wor
ship here. The temple was devoted to the worship of
Siva. After ascending a flight of several hundred steps
we stand before the great square gate-ways. Immense
columns ranging away in the darkness support the roof
of solid rock. On the walls are sculptured the fantastic forms of Brahma, Vishnu and Siva. The metamor
phoses of these are also shown in sculpture. The cave
is shaped like a cross. At the end of the main passage
way, opposite the principal gate-way, is an altar support
ing a gigantic, three-headed idol. The central face is
calm and benevolent, the forehead is covered with a lofty
diadem, like a mitre, covered with delicate carvings repre
senting necklaces. The face on the right expresses ter
rible rage; its mitre is covered with sculptured skulls and
serpents, and its outstretched hand holds a cobra. The
other face is smiling and the hand holds a flower. The
triple idol represents Siva as the passive god, the destroy
ing god and the saving god. The sculptures are much worn away, but enough remains to indicate the wondrous majesty and beauty of the Elephanta Cave. At Gwalior are a number of Hindu temple-caves.
The precipitous sides of the great mountain are cut
and carved into hundreds of statues, from one foot to
forty feet high, and deep recesses in which they seem
hidden away. One of these 'caves was probably made
about 300 years after Christ. After passing through
several archways we stand before three idols, each
twenty feet high. The worship of these has long since
ceased, and they only remain to show us what the people
of India worshiped hundreds of years ago. More than
a thousand years before this cave was excavated, and
over twenty-five hundred years ago, another great cave

surface of the rock has been dressed so as to form a
smooth wall, and the lower part of this wall 1ms been ex
cavated, and there the statues were sculptured. First
there are nine gigantic statues, each thirty feet high, placed
in niches. Behind these is a small chamber containing
another great statue in a lying position. From this
chamber a door leads into a tank. Following the paved
foot-path which surrounds this tank, you come to another
and larger chamber, which is specially dedicated to the
statue of Adinath, thirty-five feet high. Around the idol
are rich sculptures, and on the cushion on which it sits is
a long inscription. This mountain contains twelve
rooms, in each of which are from one to nine statues;
most of these are from twenty to thirty feet high. For
nearly ten miles around this mountain are bas-reliefs,
statues and excavations. There is a natural tendency
among the superstitious people to seek places of dark
ness for the observances
of their religious rites.
Oftentimes the priests are enabled to impose
on the credulity of the
people much more easily when they add some element of weirdness or
mystery to their strange
religious performances.

acquainted with Hindu learning and so-called wisdom.
The images of this god are not only found in the temples
and schools, and at the corners of the streets in the
cities, but also under the trees on country roadsides.
The sagacity of the elephant is well known, and it is
presumed that the elephant-idol is worshiped for this
reason, just as the serpent is worshiped as the symbol of
cunning, or the sun as the symbol of power. As of al
most all the other gods, Ganesha has his festivals, when
the people come together in great crowds to do him
honor. At one of these annual festivals they bring forth
the god Ganesha, place him in a boat, and accomi^anied
with other boats containing priests and musicians, they row up and down the Ganges. The great crowds of
people lining the shore fill the air with their shouts and
songs, and the occasion is one of exuberant joy.
PAGODAS.
Scattered about the large temple inclosures are great
pagodas or towers. These contained the rooms of the
priests and servants of the temple. Sometimes they
served simply as gate-ways, at other times they were used
as houses for the idols. Rising high above the sur
rounding country, everywhere they could be seen by the
people, and thus their devotion to their idolatrous wor
ship was increased. The priests sought by the use of
every possible means to fix the people's faith in their
idols; like Demetrius, whose business of making shrines
in Ephesus was spoiled by Paul's preaching, these priests
do not wish to lose their hold upon the people, because
thus their means of support would be destroyed. But,
notwithstanding all their efforts, they cannot hold the
people in their bondage, and each year witnesses more
and more refusing to listen to them. None of these

great pagodas are new. For very many years they have
towered above the dwelhngs of the people in their
majestic grandeur when they fall into decay they are

of these pagodas are
several hundreds of
feet high, and are cov

representing scenes in
the lives of the gods

eminent saints. Another famous pa
goda is at Pondicherry, m Southern India. The
s^ate-way to this tem
ple is most intricately
carved. The heathen
aim to set forth in a
durable way, as by
these sculptures, the
parts of their worship. They depend largely
upon the sight for in
structing the people in
their faith, rather than upon their hearing, preaching, or
reading sacred books.
The interiors as well as the exteriors of these temples
are covered with sculptures. The service is in nowise
like that in Christian churches. The people come and
go as they please. They beat the drums to call the at
tention of the gods to the prayers they are about to offer,
rub their hands together as they mumble over some
prayers, leave their offerings before the idol of stone or

HINDU WASHINGS FOR SIN.
A writer for young jDeople thus describes the custom
of the Hindus resorting to the Ganges, and the reasons
for it
:
" The heathen know well that sin needs to be washed
away, but as to how this can be done they have very
strang-e ideas. Some will walk through fire, as if that
would burn away all impurities ; some will cover their

bodies with filth, as if that would cleanse the soul ; others
still fancy tli^t the water of certain streams has power to
remove all taint of sin. The Hindus believe that there
is wonderful cleansing power in the water of the Ganges,
HINDUS WASHING IN THE SACRED RIVER GANGES AT BENARES
so that whoever can bathe in that river is freed iVom
guilt. From all parts of India pilgrims go to the Ganges,
and they believe that whoever dies in that stream is sure
of future bliss. But India is a vast country, and com
paratively few of the poor people who live in the south
ern portion can travel the thousand miles or more to
reach the Ganges. Hence they have their own sacred
streams and fountains, which, though not regarded as so sacred as the Ganges, are yet supposed to have power
to cleanse from sin.
" Several years ago, in a village near Madura, a Brahmin named Sokappen read in one of the sacred Hindu

books, that near the temple of his village there was a
spring- far under round, and that if one would only dig deep enough wa
ter would flow at
that spring from
the Ganges, while
the river itself was

would be a glorious work to do, and so worked for
years, spending all

Gospel, there are yet millions who have faith in their
sacred bathing places. Those who live too far from the
Ganges find some river, if they can, as at Mowli,
where two rivers, the Yenna and the Krishna, meet, and
where multitudes bathe. The dead, also, are taken there,

some to be buried, as was the 'saint' whom Mr. Bruce
describes, and others to be burned, that their ashes may
be mingled with the sacred waters. In the district of
Tinnevelly, Soutla India, is a famous artificial tank. It is
sometimes called the ' Sea of Sacred Milk.' Granite
steps lead down to the water's edge, and in the early
morninof hundreds of men and women gather to bathe and to worship the sun. The water is stagnant and
dirty, though it is esteemed as specially holy. Here the
people wash not only themselves, but also their clothes.
The cost of building these bathing places is immense, yet
the people build them in many parts of India because
they think that, at any cost, provision should be made
for the removal of sin. They know of no better way
than by bathing in these filthy places."

care for them. Besides the penances already mentioned,
we may add that some drag heavy chains or cannon-balls; some crawl on their hands and knees for years ; some roll their naked bodies over and over from the banks of
the Indus to the banks of the Ganges; some stand for life before a slow fire ; some
impose upon themselves a
silence of years, and others hang for hours head down
^\ards. All this is done to
merit salvation. In no other
country in the world, proba
bly, have so many different
ways been devised by which men hoped salvation would
be earned. Here again is
seen the contrast between
the offered salvationof Jesus
Christ and the sought sal
\ation by penances taught
b) this heathen faith, most
striking. The British gov
ernment has now forbidden
altogether many of these cruel performances, and has limited others. But earnest missionary work has done more than anything else to destroy the people's faith in the sanctity and wisdom of
these so-called holy men.
Mr. Bruce, an American missionary at Satara, records
an event which in its day caused great excitement. This
is his story:
FAKIR HANGING TO A LLUB.



HINDU TEMPLES, IDOLS AND WORSHIP. 285
Three or four years ago when we went into Satara,
we used to see, sitting in the veranda of his house, an
old man covered with rags and surrounded with filth.
Sometimes we would see him on the street, with rags innumerable upon his person. In America we should
have called him a crazy man, but ideas differ in different
lands. Here he was a ^^ saint" in whom one of the gods
dwelt. When his saintship came to be known by the
populace, he was honored and worshiped everywhere. Men who ought to have known better would, on see
ing him approach, leave
their work, and run and
prostrate themselves at his
feet. His raofs were re
moved, and he was clothed
with a rich robe of purple. No expense was spared- to
supply all his wants, and
he was attended to by two
servants, furnished by the
Prince of Ouah. At last
this rag- man, crazy-man,
saint, died. He had said
previously, "Wherever I
die, there let my tomb be
built." He died in the city, and there the people wished
to bury him and erect a tomb which should ever after be
an object of worship. But the municipal officers inter
fered and ordered the body to be removed from the city.
Then they buried him in the temple grounds, and another
god was added to the millions of Hindu deities.
This story will serve to illustrate the delusion under
DEVOTEE ENDURINl.; FIRE.

which the Hindus are resting, and the readiness with
which they yield their faith to any pretender that comes
-along. The cHmate of India awakens a dull, lethargic
condition. The activity of Western nations is unknown.
The people are accustomed to move slowly and to avail
themselves, as far as possible, of all the helps obtainable
to lessen the toils of daily life. This also leads them to
fall in readily with the declarations of any foolish fanatic
who may arise, rather than to go to the trouble of sifting
them and rejecting them as they deserve. The whole
system of Hinduism lends its aid to this. It is, itself, a
gigantic system of fraud. The Hindu priests laugh in
their sleeves at the folly of the multitudes in listening so
readily to their instructions. But few of them have any
faith in the millions of gods, whose representatives they
are. This is their profession, by their priesthood they
obtain their living, and, consequently, they do all they
can to make their religion predominant in all the affairs
of their neighborhoods. Hence it comes about, that
instead of at once exposing the pretensions of Fakirs,
holy men and devotees, they lend their aid to gain accept
ance for them with the multitude. So India groans
beneath this oppressive load of priestcraft ; each day the
priests add link after link to the chains that bind her
;
some day, though, she will arise in her might and cast off
ber burdens, walking in freedom. Christian mission
work will speed the coming of that day.

CHAPTER XIII.
HINDU SACRED BOOKS, FAIRY STORIES AND FIRESIDE TALES.
Not only in the writings of the later Stoicism, when already through the despairing twilight a luminous haze had been diffused, not only in
the open plagiarisms of the Koran, spoiled so often in the plagiarizing, but, even centuries before Christ, in the Dialogues of Socrates, in the
Republic of Plato, in the Analects of Confucius, in the Laws of Manou, in the Sutras of the Buddhists, in the Vedas of the Brahmins, in the Zend Avesta of the Parsees, in the Pirke Avoth of the Rabbis, there are unquestionably precepts which might be combined into a very pure and noble code.

Frederick W. Farear.
THE sacred books of the Hindus are written in
the Sanskrit language. They all fall under two
grand divisions, S'ruti and S'mriti. S'ruti means
"that which is heard or revealed," and S'mriti means " that which is remembered and handed down by tradi
tion." In the first division are included the Vedas, in the
second the later Sanskrit literature. There are four
Vedas (pronounced by the Hindus, Vads). The Rig
Veda, containing 1,017 hymns of praise of the personified powers of nature. The Atharva-Veda is com
posed of verses used as magical spells or incantations for
calling down or turning off evils. It had its origin in a
superstitious belief in the power of evil spirits. The Yajur (or Yazur) Veda contains hymns and texts ar
ranged for sacrificial ceremonies. The Sama-Veda re
produces many of the hvmns of the Rig-Veda re-arranged
for worship.
Each of these Vedas consists of three parts, the Man
tras or original hymns ; then the Brahmanas or pure



HINDU SACRED BOOKS, FAIRY STORIES, ETC. 289
commentaries on these hymns, and to these, philosophical treatises called Upanishads were attached. All these are believed to have been given by the gods,

having no human author. As we should say they are
believed to be divinely inspired.
Of the second sort of sacred books, the S'mriti, there

are four ciasses. The six Vedangas, first, the rules for sac
rifices; second, the book of the science of pronunciation ;
third, of metre; fourth, of exposition of the Vedas; fifths of grammar, sixth, of astronomy. Next come the
S'marta-sutras or books relating to domestic rites and
to conventional usages. Then follow the Dharma-shastras or "Law-books," the code of Manu and other in
spired law-givers. Lastly, we have the Itihasas or
legendary poems, the Mahabarata, or cyclopaedia of
Hindu traditions, legends, morals and philosophy, and
the Ramayana. This last contains the story of the wan
derings of Rama, told in 24,000 stanzas.
THE VEDIC HYMNS.
The word Veda means "knowledge." The hymns of the Rig-Veda were written between 1,500 and 1,000 years before Christ, about the time of Moses. They
contain many tedious repetitions, but yet are highly inter
estingf as showing what the ancient Hindus, and more
especially what the forefathers of this part of the race,
believed. Many of these hymns were sung by our
Aryan forefathers before they scattered to settle in India
or in the wilds of Western Europe. We have before
given a specimen of these early hymns. We give here
another that seems to show that in the begfinning- the ancient Hindus worshiped but one God.
"What god shall we adore with sacrifice? Him let us praise, the golden child that rose In the beginning, who was born the lord

The one sole lord of all that is—who made The earth, and formed the sky, who giveth life. Who giveth strength, whose bidding gods revere, Whose hiding-place is immortality. Whose shadow, death ; who by his mignt is king Of all the breathing, sleeping, waking world.



HINDU SACRED BOOKS, FAIRY STORIES, ETC. 29

Where'er let loose in space, the mighty waters Have gone, depositing a fruitful seed, And generating fire, there he arose Who is the breath and life of all the gods. Whose mighty glance looks round the vast expanse
Of watery vapor—source of energy,
Cause of the sacrifice—the only God, Above the gods."
The next selection shows how the worship of one God passed into the worship of many gods, and explains
the origin of caste. The previous selection was written
long before this one :
" The embodied spirit has a thousand heads, A thousand eyes, a thousand feet, around On every side enveloping the earth, Yet filling space no larger than a span. He is himself this very universe
;
He is whatever is, has been, and shall be; He is the lord of immortality. All creatures are one-fourth of him, three-fourths Are that which is immortal in th6 sky. From him, called Purusha, was born Viraj, And from Viraj was Purusha produced. Whom gods and holy men made their oblation, With Purusha as victim, they performed A sacrifice. Why did they divide him ? How did they cut him up ? What was his mouth ? What were his arms ? and what his thighs and feet ? The Brahmin was his mouth, the kingly soldier Was made his arms, the husbandman his thighs.
The servile Sudra issued from his feet."
The common creed of the Hindus, as gathered from
the Brahmanas and Upanishads, is as follows
;
I. The immortality of the soul. Meaning by this,
however, not only that it will always live in the future,
but that it has always lived in the past, hence we may
say, the; eternity of the soul.

2. Nothing can come from nothing, and hence, all of

3. The soul cannot exercise thought, or any activity
apart from the body.



HINDU SACRED BOOKS, FAIRY STORIES, ETC. 293
4. Yet the union of body and soul is a source of
misery to human beings. 5. Hence we have the behef in the transmigration of
the soul. That the soul passes from body to body through
innumerable changes. These bodies include the widest range and are those of animals or of men.
THE LAW-BOOK OF MANU.
This was written about the fifth century before Christ.
Its rules .consist of " immemorial or approved practices,"
"practices of law and government," "penitential exercises," and " consequences of acts." The whole is di
vided into twelve books, of which we give an epitome
:
After an account of the creation of the world, in the
first book, the four stages of a Brahmin's life are the only
subjects treated of in regular order in the second, third,
fourth, fifth and sixth books, four books being devoted to
the duties of the religious student and married house
holder, and the sixth book treating of the two last stages
of anchorite and religious mendicant.
The seventh and eighth books propound the rules of
government, principally, of course, for the guidance of
the second great class of Kshatriyas, from which the king
was chosen. The ninth book contains precepts on the
subject of women, husband and wife ; their offspring and
the law of inheritance and division of property, with ad
ditional rules for kings, and a few precepts relative to
the two remaining castes. It also describes the employ
ments to which the several castes are restricted, and
states the occupations permitted to Brahmins, Kshatriyas,
Vais'yas and S'udras, in times of exigency and distress.
The eleventh book gives rules of expiation, both for the
sins of the present life—especially sins against caste

and for the effects of offenses committed in previous



2gA EHHOJi'S CHAINS.
bodies, as shown in congenital diseases, etc. The twelfth
continues the subject of the recompenses or consequences
of acts, good or bad, as leading to reward in Heaven or
punishment in various hells, and to triple degrees of
transmigration. It closes with directions as to the best
means of obtaining final beatitude and absorption into
the universal essence.
A few specimens of Manu's moral precepts are here
subjoined
:
"Daily perform thine own appointed work Unweariedly; and to obtain a friend

A sure companion to the future world

Collect a store of virtue like the ants,
Who garner up their treasures into heaps ;
For neither father, mother, wife, nor son, Nor kinsman, will remain beside thee then. When thou art passing to that other home

Thy virtue will thy only comrade be.
"Single is every living creature born, Single he passes to another world. Single he eats the fruits of evil deeds, Single the fruit of good ; and when he leaves His body like a log or heap of clay Upon the ground, his kinsmen walk away
:
Virtue alone stays by him at the tomb. And bears him through the dreary, trackless gloom.
"Depend not on another, rather lean Upon thyself; trust to thine own exertions Subjection to another's will gives pain;
True happiness consists in self-reliance.
"Strive to complete the task thou hast commenced
;
Wearied, renew thy efforts once again
;
Again fatigued, once more the work begin
;
So shalt thou earn success and fortune win."
There are, in addition to the Code of Manu, at least
nineteen other codes of various degrees of authority.



HIXDU SACRED BOOK'S, FAIRY STORIES, ETC. 201;
DEGRADATION OF WOMEN ACCORDING TO MANU S LAWS.
A certain Shaster commands : " If a man goes on a
journey, his wife shall not divert herself by play, nor shall
see any public show, nor shall laugh, nor shall dress her
self in jew-els or fine clothes, nor hear music, nor shall sit
at the window, nor shall behold anything choice and rare,
but shall fasten well the house door and remain private,
and shall not eat any dainty food, and shall not blacken
her eyes with powder, and shall not view her face in a
mirror She shall never amuse herself in any such
agreeable employment during the absence of her hus
band."
The following incidents will show how the laws of
Manu, in the case of women, are carried out.
Miss Brittan, for many years a missionary in India,
says: "When I teach in one house, I sit up-stairs in a
little veranda, which is walled all around. Into the ve
randa a strongly-barred window opens, behind which sit
the women who are being taught, passing their books and
work through the bars. I always think of our Saviour's
words when visiting them—' I was in prison, and ye came
urito me.' A Avoman, whose eyes filled with tears when
she saw a flower which was brought her to copy in wool,
said : 'Ah, this reminds me of the time when I was a
child, for there were others like this in my father's gar
den, and I have not seen it for so long.' Then, pointing
a few yards before her to a high wall covered with dirt
and moss, she added : ' That is the only prospect I have had for years.' . . . Yesterday, I entered a house which
was exactly like those I had read of before I came to
India. The Baboo, or gentleman of the house, had a
suite of rooms furnished elegantly—rich carpets, sofas,
chairs, beautiful oaintings and statuar);-, with a centre



296 EKROK'S CHAINS.
table covered with vases and curiosities. It really was
refreshing to see such beauty and elegance. But, alas !
I was shown to the women's apartments, and the tears
would come to my eyes, notwithstanding my efforts to restrain them. Ah, how sad ! The Baboo spoke English to me, and was a gentleman. His wife sat on a dirty mat, which was thrown on a damp stone floor, her
hair uncombed, her one article of clothing—a sarree

wretchedly dirty, and the appearance of everything in the
bare, miserable little room she lived in was that of lowest
heathenism. As I saw no chair, I sat down on the mat
beside the woman until a servant brought me one, which he said the Baboo had sent me."
A well-known missionary relates the following illustra
tive incident
:
" One day, when I was walking in a retired village, my
attention was arrested by seeing two objects, at some
distance before me, rolling in the mud. As I approached
the spot, I found two females almost exhausted by
fatigue. I learned that they had vowed to their goddess to roll in this manner from one temple to another. They had spent nearly a week, and had not accomplished onehalf their journey. But no arguments, no remonstrances
on my part could induce them to relinquish their under
taking. On leaving them, I indignantly expostulated with a learned Brahmin, who stood near by, and pointed
to the miserable objects I had just left. ' Oh,' said he^
' this is worship exactly suited to the capacity of females.
Let them alone ; they are sincere. Of course, their wor
ship will be accepted.' "
THE BURNING OF WIDOWS COMMANDED BY MANU.
Until a comparatively recent date, the fearful rite of
Suttee has been practiced openly in India by all high

caste people. The ancient Vedas and the Institutes of
Manu, which are second in authority, do not enjoin this
rite ; but the Shasters and Puranas, which hold about the
same relation to the Vedas that the Jewish Talmud does
to the Old Testament Scriptures, recommend the flames
of the funeral pile as the widow's sure road to eternal joy
and peace. The following passages, selected from many
similar ones, translated by our missionaries from the Pu
ranas and Shasters, will be sufficient for our purpose :
"If a woman who had despised her lord, or done what
was contrary to his mind, should (even) from mercenary
motives or fear, or from a suspension of the reasoning power, die with her husband, she shall be purged from
.all crimes.
"As the snake-catcher draws the serpent Irom its hole,
so she (no matter how great his sins), by burning, rescues
her husband from hell, and rejoices with him.
" The woman who expires on the funeral pile with her
husband purifies the family of her father, her mother and
her husband. If the husband be a Brahmincide, the
greatest of all criminals, an ungrateful person, or a mur
derer of his friends, the wife, by burning with him, purges
away his sins.
"There is no virtue greater than a virtuous woman burning herself with her husband.
"As long as a woman, in her successive transmigrations,
should decline burning herself like a faithful wife on the
same fire with her deceased lord, so long shall she not be
exempted from springing to life again in the body of some
female animal.
"Though he, her husband, have sunk to the region of
torment, be restrained in dreadful bonds, have reached
the place of anguish, be seized by the imp of Luma (the
Hindu Pluto, the god of the infernal regions), be exhausted



HINDU SACKED BOOK'S, FAIKY STORIES, ETC igg
of strenj^nh, and afflicted and tortured for his crimes, still,
as a serpent catcher unerring-ly drags a serpent from his
liole, so does she draw her husband from hell, and ascends with him to Heaven by the power of devotion.
" If the wife be within one day's journey of the place
where her husband died, and she signify her wish to be
burned with him, the burning of the corpse shall be de
layed till her arrival.
" If the husband be out of the country when he dies,
let the virtuous wife take his slippers, or anything which
Tjelongs to his dress, and binding them, or it, on her
breast, after purification, enter a separate fire. A Brun
hunu cannot burn herself on a separate pile ; but this is an eminent virtue in another woman.
" There are thirty-five million hairs on the human body.
The woman who ascends the pile will remain so many years with her husband in Heaven.
" Dying with her husband, she purifies three genera
tions—her father and mother's side and her husband's side. Such a wife, adoring her husband, enters into celestial felicity with him^greatest and most admired ;
lauded by the choirs of Heaven, with him she shall enjoy
the delio-hts of Heaven while fourteen Indras reis^n."
THE GOD VISHNU MADE MAN.
According to the great poems, the Mahabarata and the Ramayana, Vishnu passed through ten incarnations.
These are frequently represented in sculptures (see
-illustration). They are I. Mataya, the fish. According
to the story, Vishnu became a fish to save Manu (the
Noah of the Hindus) from the universal deluge. II.
Kurma, the tortoise. Here Vishnu became a tortoise at
the bottom of the sea of milk, that his back might serve
as a pivot for the mountain Mandara, around which the

duction of fourteen precious things. III. Varah, the boar.
Vishnu in this form dehvered the world, after a strugcrlc
of a thousand years, from the demon who had seized the
earth and carried it to the lowest depths of the sea. IV.
Nara-sinha, the lion. He thus destroyed another demon.
V. Vamana, the dwarf. He deprived the demon Bali of
the dominion of three worlds. He received from Bali
the promise of as much land as he could step over in
three paces, and then stepped over heaven and earth.
VI. Parasu-rama or Rama with the axe. VII. Rama, the
hero, destroying the demon Ravana. VIII. Krishna, the
dark destroyer. IX. Buddha, the enlightened one. This
form was devised to win back the Hindu Buddhists to
Vishnu's worship. X. Kalki who is yet to appear. He
will be revealed in the sky, seated upon a white-winged
horse, with a drawn sword like a blazing comet. He is
to finally destroy the wicked and to permanently establish
righteousness and truth upon the earth.
A SANSKRIT STORY-BOOK.
Almost all the Hindus' books are story-books, for they
are filled with accounts of the adventures of the gods
and legends and myths. But there is one book called the Hitopadesa, which has been called the "Father of all
Fables." Its stories have been translated into Persian, Arabic, Hebrew, Greek and later into German, French
and English. This book is very old and is exceedingly
popular in India. We have selected four of its stories,
and the reader will probably wonder that such narratives
should ever gain a national popularity.
THE STORY OF THE TERRIBLE BELL.
"A thief had stolen a bell from the city of Brahmapoora,
and was making off with that plunder, and more, into the



-;,, EKA'O A'\S CHAINS.
Sei-parrata hills, when he was killed by a tiger. The bell
lay in the jungle until some monkeys picked it up, and
amused themselves by constantly ringing it. The townspeople found the bones of the man, and heard the noise
of the bell all about the hills; so they gave out that there
was a terrible devil there, whose ears rang like bells as
he swung them about, and whose delight was to devour
men. Every one, accordingly, was leaving the town,
when a peasant woman named Karala, who, liked belief
the better for a little proof, came to the Rajah.
"'Highness!' she observed, 'for a consideration I could
settle this Swing-ear.'
'"You could!' exclaimed the Rajah.
'"I think so!' repeated the woman.
'"Give her a consideration forthwith,' said the Rajah.
"Karala, who had her own ideas about the matter, took
the present and set out. Being come to the hills, she made a circle, and did homage to Ganesha, without whom nothing prospers. Then, taking some fruit she had
brought, such as monkeys love extremely, she scattered it up and down in the wood, and withdrew to Avatch. Very
soon the monkeys finding the fruit, put down the bell, to
do justice to it, and the woman picking it up, bore it back
to the town, where she became an object of uncommon
veneration."
THE STORY OF THE LION AND THE (U.n HARE.
"On the Mandara Mountain there lived a Lion named
Fierce-of-heart, and he was perpetually making massacre
of all the wild animals. The thing grew so had that the
beasts held a public meeting, and drew up 3. respectful remonstrance to the Lion in diese words: 'Wherefore
should your Majesty make carnage of us all? If it may
please you, we ourselves will daily furnish a beast for



HINDU SACRED BOOKS, FAIRY STORIES, ETC. ,q,
your Majesty's meal.' The Lion responded, 'If that ar
rangement is more agreeable to you, be it so;' and from
that time a beast was allotted to him daily, and daily
devoured. One day it came to the turn of an old hare
to supply the royal table, who reflected to himself as he
walked along, 'I can but die, and I will go to my death
leisurely.'
"Now Fierce-of-heart, the lion, was pinched with hun
ger, and seeing the Hare so approaching he roared out,
'How darest thou thus delay in coming?'
"'Sire,' replied the Hare, 'I am not to blame. I was
detained on the road by another lion, who exacted an oath from me to return when I should have informed
your Majesty.'
"'Go,' exclaimed King Fierce-of-heart in a rage; 'show
me, instantly, where this insolent villain of a lion lives.'
"The Hare led the way accordingly till he came to a
deep well, whereat he stopped, and said : ' Let my lord,
the King, come hither, and behold him.' The Lion ap
proached, and beheld his own reflection in the water of
the well; upon which, in his passion, he directly flung
himself, and so perished."
THE STORY OF' THE BRAHMIN AND THE PANS.
"There was a Brahmin in the city of Vana, whose
name was Deva Sarman. At the equinoctial feast of the
Dussera, he obtained for his duxina-gift a dish of flour,
which he took into a potter's shed, and there lay down
in the shade among the pots, staff in hand. As he thus
reclined he began to meditate. 'I can sell this meal for
ten cowry-shells, and with them I can purchase some of
these pots, and sell them at an advance. With all that
money I shall invest in betel-nuts and body-cloths, and
make a new profit by their sale ; and so go on traffick



304 EK-ROA-S CJJ.l/NS.
ing till I get a lakh of rupees. What's to prevent me ?
Then I shall marry four wives, and one at least will be
beautiful and young, and she shall be my favorite. Of
course, the others will be jealous ; but if they quarrel,
and talk, and trouble me, I will belabor them like this

and this—' and therewith he flourished his staff, to such
a purpose as to smash his meal-dish and break several of
the potter's jars. The potter, rushing out, took him by the
throat, turned him off, and ended his speculations."
THE STORY OF THE RECLUSE AND THE MOUSE.
" In the forest of the Sage Gautama there dwelt a re
cluse named Mighty-at-Prayer. Once, as he sat at his
frugal meal, a young mouse dropped beside him from the
beak of a crow, and he took it up and fed it tenderly with
rice grains. Some time after the Saint observed a cat pursuing his dependant to devour it, whereupon he
changed the mouse into a stout cat. The cat was a great
deal harassed by dogs, upon which the Saint again transformed it into a dog. The dog was always in danger of
the tigers, and his protector at last gave him the form of
a tiger ; considering him all this while, and treating him
withal, like nothing but a mouse. The country-lolks
passing by would say, ' That a tiger ! not he : it is a
mouse the Saint has transformed.' And the mouse being
vexed at this, reflected, ' So long as the Master lives this
shameful story of my origin will survive.' With this
thought he was about to take the Saint's life, when he,
who knew his purpose, turned the ungrateful beast by a
word to his original shape."



SHJNTOISM, THE NATUJiE-WORSHIP OF JAPAN. ,q(
CHAPTER XIV.
SHINTOLSM, THE NATURE-WORSHIP OF JAPAN.
As regards the beliefs of the ancient religion, Shintoism, it taught primarily the existence of gods, and in the division which it made of them into good and bad, recognized that fundamental and eternal distinction between right and wrong, the deep rooting of which in the human soul has been man's safeguard against what is bad in religions and in everything else.

Sir Edward J. Reed.
JAPAN is one of the most interesting of countries to
tlie American people. It is our nearest neighbor on the west ; and America was mainly instrumental in
introducing Japan into the ranks of the nations of mod
ern times. The present line of Mikados among the Jap
anese is the longest continued among existing nations.
China has changed its dynasties many times, and has been twice subdued by foreigners, the Mongols and the
Manchis; but the line of Japanese monarchs is an un
broken series from B. C. 660 to the present day. The Mongols sought to conquer the Island Empire in 1281
A. D. ; but they were utterly defeated and driven away. The present emperor, Mutsuhito, is the one hundred and
twenty-third Mikado of Japan.
The religions of this people are two, Shintoism and
Buddhism. The tenets of Confucius have been introduced
together with Buddhism, and Buddhist preachers of to-day
take their texts from the classic Chinese books. Shintoism has been much mixed up with Buddhism. Many
features of its worship have been changed in imitation of



3o6 HJiRUK' S C/.'A JAS.
Buddhism, and some of its essential doctrines liave been
greatly modified. There has been some discussion as to
whether Shintoism is really a religion or only a system
of state-craft ; but it is very generally believed to be a
religion which has degenerated into a mere system of
political machinery. Certainly it has gods and god
desses, and sacred symbols, legends, myths and religious,
notions which existed in Japan long before Buddhism came there. There are also sacred books which have nO'
connection with the Buddhist writings. The temples and
priests are an innovation of later days. Shintoism is and
was the State religion ; it is supported by the State ; its head is the emperor, the Mikado ; its sacred books are
but the chronicles of its history, and the whole system is.
interwoven with the national life of Japan.
THE SACRED BOOKS OF JAPAN.
The Kojiki and the Nihoiiki are the two most sacrerf
Shinto books. The one was written 71 1 A. D., the other 720 A. D. They were composed long before this. It always has been an Oriental practice to commit books to> memory. Thus the Hindu and Parsee sacred books were
preserved, and thus, too, the ancient Japanese books have
been kept. Without being written out, these books were handed down from mouth to mouth. Soon after the in
vention of the Japanese written characters, these records,
were reduced to writing. The story of this is thus told :
"As to the historical records of Japan, it is first mentioned'
that, under the twentieth emperor, in 41 5 A. D., officials
were sent into the country to verify and describe the
names of all the families. Later, a transcription of these
records (originally written, in all probability, in the old
Japanese letters, 'the gods' letters,') in Chinese characters
took place, and in 644 A. D. an historical account of the



SHIA'TOISM. THE NATURE-WORSHIP OF JAPAX. ,,-,
emperors, the country, the officials and the people is said
to have existed, which was destroyed when Iruka was
murdered, and his father's palace, in which these records
were kept, was burned. Only the history of the country
was saved. From this work, as well as from what the old men oi the whole empire remembered, a new compilation was made under the Emperor Temmu {672-686
A. D.V and in order that it migrht not be lost ag^ain, it was
read to a peasant girl, named Are, who was said never ta
forget anything she had once heard. From this record, and from what Are still remembered, the first historical
record of Japan known to us, the Kojiki, was compiled
about thirty years later."
These works, though histories, strictly speaking, are
full of stories of mythology, describing the origin of gods
and men. The mythology of Japan is superior to that
of Greece. It contains but few or none of the horrible
stories of the gods, or the voluptuous amours of gods and goddesses which so abound in Grecian mythology.
Some of their myths are really beautiful, others are very
extravagant. The origin of gods, of men, of the earth,
are here all described. It begins with the time when
"Far in the deep infinitudes of space, Upon a throne of silence, Sat Ame-no-mi-naka-nushi-ro-kami."
This strange name signifies The Lord of the Centre of Heaven. The heavens and earth were then joined together. There was nothing but chaos. Pairs of beings
were then created, male and female. Last of all Izanagi
and Izanami were created.
JAPANESE STORY OF THE CREATION.
It is said that the other pairs of beings before Izanagi
and Izanami were only their imperfect forms or the pro

cesses through which they passed before arriving at per
fection. These two beings Uved in the heavens. The
world was not yet well formed, and the soil floated about
like a fish in the water, but near the surface, and was
called "The Floating Region." The sun, earth and moon
were still attached to each other like a head to the neck,
or arms to the body. They were little by little separating,
the parts joining them growing thinner and thinner.
This part, like an isthmus, was called "Heaven's Floating
Bridofe." It was on this bridge that Izanag-i and Izanami
were standing when they saw a pair of wagtails cooing and billing sweetly together. The heavenly couple were
so delighted with the sight that they began to imitate the
birds. Thus began the art of love, which mortals have
practiced to this day.
While talking together on this Bridge of Heaven, they
began to wonder if there was a world beneath them. They looked far down upon the green seas, but could see
nothing! Then Izanagi took his long jeweled spear and
plunged it into the turbid mass, turning it round and
round. As he lifted it up, the drops which trickled from
it hardened into earth of their own accord, and thus dry
land was formed. As Izanagi was cleansing his spear the lumps of muck and mud which had adhered to it flew
off into space, and were changed into stars and comets.
It is also said that by turning his spear round and round,
Izanagi set the earth revolving in its daily revolutions.
To the land thus formed, they gave the name "The
Island of the Congealed Drop," because they intended to
create a large archipelago and wished to distinguish this
as the first island. They descended from Heaven on the floadng bridge and landed on the island. Izanagi struck
his tall spear in the ground making it the axis of the
world. He then proceeded to build a palace around the

spear which formed the central pillar. The spot was
formerly at the North Pole, but is now at Eshima, off the
central eastern coast of Japan. They next resolved to
walk around the island and examine it. This done, they
met together. Izanami cried out, "What a lovely man !"
But Izanagi rebuked her for speaking first, and said they
must try it again. Then they walked around the island
once more. When they met, Izanami held her tongue
while Izanagi said, " What a lovely woman !" Being now both in good humor, they began the work
of creating Japan. The first island brought up out of the water was Anajl ; and then the main island. After
that, eight large islands were created, whence comes one
of the names of Japan, " The Empire of the Eight Great
Islands." Six smaller islands were also produced. The
several thousand islets which make up the archipelago of
"Everlasting Great Japan" were formed by the spontane
•ous consolidation of the foam of the sea.
After the country was thus formed the divine pair cre
ated eight millions of earthly gods or Kami, and the ten
thousand different things on the earth. Vegetation
sprung up over all the land, which was, however, still
covered with mist. So Izanagi created with his breath
the two gods, male and female, of the wind. All these
islands are the children of Izanagi and Izanami, and when
first born were small and feeble, but gradually grew
larger and larger, attaining their present size like human
beings, which are at first tiny infants.
As the gradual separation of the land and sea went on,
?oreign countries were formed by the congealing of the
foam of the sea. The god of fire was then born of
Izanami, his mother. This god often became very angry
at any one who used unclean fire. Izanami then created
by herself the gods of metals, of clay, and of fresh water.



;io EJiROK'S CJIAJMS.
This latter god was commanded always to keep the god
ol tire quiet, and put him out when he began to do mis
chief.
Izanagi and Izanami though married but a short time,
began to quarrel. Izanami being very angry went down
to the lower world of darkness and disappeared. In the
dark world under the earth Izanami stayed a long time,
and after wearisome waiting, Izanagi went after her. In
the darkness of the under-world he was horrified at what
he saw, and leaving his consort below he tried to save
himself and make his escape to the earth again.
THE GOD CREATKIl FROM IZ^NAGIS STAFF
In his struggles several gods were created, one of them
coming out of his staff. When he got up to daylight,
he secured a large rock to close up the hole in the earth.
Turning this rock into a god, he commanded him to
watch the place. He then rushed into the sea, and con

tinued washing for a long time to purify himself. In
blowing out from his lungs the polluted air inhaled in the
under- world, the two evil gods sprang forth from his breath.
As these would commit great harm and wickedness, Iza
naofi created two other gods to correct their evil. But
when he had washed his eyes and could see clearly again,
there sprang out two precious and lovely beings ; one from
his left eye being a rare and glistening maiden, whom he afterward named Amaterasu, or "The Heaven Illumi
nating Spirit." From his right eye appeared Susa-no O, the "Ruler of the Moon." Being now pure again, and
having these lovely children, Izanagi rejoiced and said, "I
have begotten child upon child, and at the end of my be
getting, I have begotten me two jewel-children." Now
the brightness of the person of the maiden Amaterasu was beautiful, and shone through Heaven and earth.
Izanagi, well pleased, saidr "Though my children are
many, none of them is like this wonder-child. She must
not be kept in this region." So taking off the necklace
of precious stones from his neck and rattling it, he gave
it to her, saying, "Rule thou over the High Plain of Heaven." At that time the distance between Heaven
and earth was not very great, and he sent her up to the blue sky by the Heaven-uniting pillar, on which the
heavens rested as on a prop. She easily mounted it,
and lived in the sun, illuminating the whole heavens and
earth. The sun now gradually separated from the earth,
and both moved farther and farther apart, until they rested
where they now are. Izanagi next spoke to Susa-no O, the Ruler of the Moon, and said, "Rule thou over the new-born
earth and the blue waste of the sea with its multitudinous
salt waters." Thus the heavens, and the earth, and
moon were created and inhabited. And as Japan lay
directly opposite the sun when it separated from the



212 EJiJfOR'S CHAINS.
earth, it is plain that Japan lies on the summit of the
globe. It is easily seen that all other countries were
formed by the spontaneous consolidation of the ocean
foam and the collection of mud in the various seas. The
stars were made to euide warriors from foreiofn coun
tries to the court of the Mikado, who is the one and only
true son of heaven, before whom all should bow.
THE EMPERORS DESCENDED FROM THE GODS.
Amaterasu, on account of her bright beauty, was by
her father made queen of the sun, and shared with the
two creator-o'ods the crovernment of the world. In send
ing her to her dominion, Izanagi gave her the necklace
of precious stones from his neck, and told her to go up
by way of the floating bridge. As the sun was then
near, she ascended without difficulty. Desiring ai'ter
ward to g-ive the government of the earth to her o;rand
son, Ninig-i-no-mikoto, after considerable difficulty in get
ting the god in possession to make way for him, she was
able to carry out her purpose and dispatch him to his
post. She proclaimed him sovereign of Japan tor ever and ever, and appointed his descendants to rule it as
long as the heavens and the earth endure. Before start
ing he received from his grandmother, the sun-goddess,
the Three Divine Insignia of the Imperial Power of
Japan, namely, the Sacred Mirror, which is still worshiped
at the Naiku Shrine in Ise as representative of the god
dess ; the Sacred Sword, which is still enshrined at the
temple of Atsuta, near Nagoya, at the head of the bay of
Owari ; and the Sacred Stone, or " Magatama," which is
always in possession of the Emperor of Japan.
Possessed of these divine symbols, and accompanied
by a number of inferior gods, Ninigi-no-mikoto descended
upon the Floating Bridge of Heaven, or the "Ama no

THE .SUN-GODDESS ENTICED FROM THE CAVE.
The young brother of the Sun-goddess so seriously
offended his bright and beautiful sister that she went
away and concealed herself in the cave of Ameno
Tuaya, closing the entrance with a large piece of rock.



314 £A'A'OA"S CHAINS.
From this time the entire country was dark, and was given
up to the noise and disturbance of all sorts of inferior
ijods. This state of things was so distressingf that all the gods assembled at the cave's mouth, on the bank of the
Yasukawa River, and deliberated upon the means to be
adopted for inducing the petulant goddess to reappear,
for be it understood that alter the birth of the Sun-eod
dess no light could be obtained except from her bright
ness, as she had been appointed to illuminate the space between earth and Heaven, and it was the brightness of
her body that shone through the sun. At the council of
the gods it was decided to entice the goddess forth by means of an image of herself, and one of the gods and
a blacksmith made mirrors, in the shape of the sun, with iron brought from Heaven.
Japanese mirrors are alvi^ays made of fine metal, not
•of glass coated with quicksilver. Those in common use
are generally five or six inches in diameter, having the
surface polished with great care and some figures or
flowers stamped upon the back. The mirror is a Shinto
symbol. In the centre of the Shinto shrine of Ise, in the •" Holy of Holies" of that temple are found four boxes of unpainted wood, resting on low stands. These are
the only objects to be found here. In each box, wrapped
in a brocade bag, is a mirror. On festival days, these
boxes—but not the mirrors—are exposed to view.
The first two mirrors produced by the blacksmith, as
stated above, were unsatisfactory, but the third was
large and beautiful, and is now the deity of the inner
shrine of Ise. The gods also planted hemp and paper
mulberry, and with their fibre and bark wove clothing for
the goddess. They also cut down trees and built a
palace. Magatama jewels (carved and polished pieces
of stone, such as were worn in those days as ornaments)









SHINTOISM, THE NATURE- WORSHIP OF JAPAN. 315
were also produced, and wands were made from sakaki
branches and bamboo. One of the gods then pulled up
a sakaki-tree by the roots, and on its upper branches
hung the necklace of jewels ; at the middle he hung the
sacred mirror, p.nd to the lower branches he attached both
coarse and fine cloth. This formed a large gohei, which was held by Ama-no-futo-dama-no-mikoto, while he pronounced an address in honor of the goddess. And
goheis like this, with jewels, mirrors and strips of cloth
cut zigzag, we still see in the hands of the young priest
esses at the shrine of the goddess herself, and the simpler
gohei or wands, with strips of cloth or paper attached,
are now to be seen, as they have for ages been, all over
Japan, at every Shinto temple or shrine and in thousands
of other places.
A number of young cocks were next collected, and
set to crow in concert; a strong god was concealed by
the door of the cavern, to wrest it open at the favorable moment; and a very renowned goddess, Uzume, was set to dance, blowing music out of a bamboo tube pierced
with holes, while the gods kept time to her performance
by striking two pieces of wood together. A sort of harp
was made, by placing six bows together, with the strings upward. This was played by the drawing of grass and
rushes across it. Uzume, who appears to have entered
upon her task with great spirit, bound her sleeves close
up to the arm-pits, and grasped in her hand a bundle of
twigs and a spear wound round with grass and having
small bells attached to it. Bon-fires were lighted and a
circular box or drum was placed for her to dance upon. Then this young goddess commenced to tread with
measure upon the hollow box and cause it to resound.
She sang a six-syllable song or charm of numbers, and,
gradually quickening her dance wrought herself up to

such a pitch of excitement, or rather "such a spirit de
scended on the goddess," that she loosened her dress,
reveaUno" more and more of her loveHness, and at last,
to the intense amazement and delight of the gods, ap
pears to have discarded her dress altogether. With the
laughter of the gods the heavens shook. The address
in her honor, the stirring sounds of the music and dan
cing, and the loud and joyous laughter of the gods was too much for Amaterasu, and slightly opening the door,
she softly said from inside, "I fancied that because of
my retirement both Heaven and Japan were in darkness! Why has Uzume danced and why do the gods laugh?" Uzume replied, "I dance and they laugh, because there
is an honorable deity here" (pointing to the mirror)
"who surpasses you in glory;" and as she said this, the
mirror was pushed forward and shown to the Sun-goddess,
reflecting her own radiant loveliness, of course, and her as
tonishment was even greater than before. As she peeped
out of the cave to look around, the strong god pulled the rock-door open and drew the bright goddess forth.
Then a rice-straw rope was passed behind her, and one of the gods said, "Go not back behind this." As they
were putting the mirror into the cave it was struck
against the door, and received a flaw which remains to this day. They then removed the goddess to her new
palace, and, as an expression of their kindly interest, they
put a straw rope round it to keep off evil gods.
SHINTO WORSHIP.
Buddhism was introduced into Japan in 532 A. D. Up
to this time Shintoism had continued to be the sole reli

least. It is called by the Japanese themselves, Kami-no

Mikado. He is the descendant of the gods, and his
common designation is Ten-Shi, or " Son of Heaven."
The Mikado has two crests, one, representing the chrysanthemum, is used for government purposes. The

of winds, carries a huofe sack slung over his shoulders,

of occupations, of the household, of the work-shop, the

The sun is one of the most common objects of wor
ship among the Shintoists. The country of Japan is often
called "The Land of the Rising Sun." Their national
flag is of white with a large red sun in the centre. On
the top of Fujiyama, the famous sacred mountain, and on
the sea-shore, pilgrims and priests often gather to offer
their worship to the rising sun.

The characteristics of " Pure Shintd" are an absence of an ethical and doctrinal code, of idol-worship, of priestcraft, and of any teach

objects in nature. It is said tliat tlie Kami, or gods, number 14,000, of whom 3,700 are known to have shrines; but, practically, tlie num

THE SEVEN HOUSEHOLD GODS.
MR. GRIFFIS says : Every Japanese child knows
the Shichifiiku Jin, or the seven Patrons of Happiness. They have charge of long life,
riches, daily food, contentment, talents, glory and love.
Their images, carved in ivory, wood, stone, or cast in
bronze, are found in every house, sold in the stores,
painted on shop-signs, and found in picture-books. They are a jolly company, and make a happy family. On New
Year's Eve, a picture of the Treasure-ship (Yakarebune),
laden with Shippi (the seven jewels) and with all the
good things of life which men most desire, is hung up in
houses. The ship is coming into port, and the passen

'the people. These seven jewels are the same as those which Momotaro brought back from the Onis island.
First there is Fukoruku Jin, the patron of long life or
length of days. He has an enormously high forehead, rounded at the top, which makes his head look like a
sugar loaf. It is bald and shiny. A few stray white
hairs sometimes sprout up, and the barber, to reach them,
has to prop a ladder against his head to climb up and
-apply his razor. This big head comes from thinking so
'much. His eyebrows are white like cotton, and a long,
snowy beard falls down over his
breast. When in
a specially good
humor, he ties a
handkerchief over
his high, slippery
crown, and allows
little boys to climb
up on top — that
is,if they are good boys, and can
write well. When he wants to show how strong and
lively he is, even
though so old, he lets Daikoku, the
fat fellow, ride on
top of his head
while he smokes his pipe and wades across a river. Dai
koku has to hold on tightly, or he will slip down and get
a ducking. Usually, the old shiny-head is a very solemn
gentleman, and walks slowly along with his staff in one

hand, while with the other he strokes his long eyebrows.
The tortoise and the crane are always with him, for these
are his pets. Sometimes a stag, with hair white with age, walks behind him. Everybody likes Fukoruku Jin, be
cause every one wants to get his favor and live until, like
a lobster, his back is bent with age. At a wedding, you
will always see a picture of white-bearded and shinypated Fukoruku Jin.
Daikoku is a short chubby fellow, with eyes half sunk
in fat, but twinkling with fun. He has a flat cap set on
his head, a loose sack over his shoulders, and big boots
on his feet. His throne is two straw baofs of rice, and
his badge of office is a mallet or hammer, which makes people rich when he shakes it. The hammer is the
symbol of labor, showing that people may expect to get
rich only by hard work. One end of it is carved to rep
resent the jewel of the ebbing and the flowing tides, because merchants get rich by commerce on the sea, and
must watch the tides. He is often seen holding the
counting-board, on which you can reckon, do sums, sub
^ tract, multiply or divide, by sliding balls up and down a
row of sticks set in a frame, instead of writing the figures.
Beside him is a ledger and day-book. His favorite ani
mal is the rat, which, like some rich men's pets, eats or
runs away with his wealth.
The great silver-white radish called daikon, two feet
long and as big as a man's calf, is always seen near him,
because it signifies flourishing prosperity. He keeps
his bag tightly shut, for money easily runs away when
the purse is once opened. He never lets go his hammer,
for it is only by constant care that any one can keep
money after he gets it. Even when he frolics with
Fukoruku Jin, and rides on his head, he keeps his hammer swinging at his belt. He has huge lop ears. Once

in a while, when he wishes to take exercise, and Fuko
ruku Jin wants to show how frisky he can be, even if he
is old, they have a wrestling-match together. Daikoku
nearly always beats, because Fukoruku Jin is so tall that he has to bend down to grip Daikoku, who is fat and
short, and thus he becomes top-heavy. Then Daikoku
o-ets his rival's lone head under his left arm, seizes him
over his back by the belt, and throws him over his
shoulder flat on the ground. But if Fukoruku Jin can
only get hold of Daikoku's lop ears, both fall together.
Then they laugh heartily and try it again.
DOMESTIC ALTAR OF THE GODS OF DAILY FOOD AND OF RICE.
Ebisu is the patron of daily food, which is usually rice
and fish, and in old times was chiefly the latter. He is
nearly as fat as Daikoku. He wears a court noble's
high cap. He is always fishing or enjoying his game.



POPULAR GODS AND SHRINES OF SHINTOISM. 327
When very happy, he sits on a rock by the sea, with his.

Ebisu is the same scamp that goes by the other name of Sosanoo.

the father of happiness. He does not wear much cloth

He makes tops, paints pictures or kites for the boys, and
is the children's greatest friend. When the seven patrons
meet together, Hotel is apt to drink more wine than is
good for him. Toshi-toku is almost the only one of the
seven who never lays aside his dignity. He has a very
grave countenance. He is the patron of talents. His
pet animal is a spotted fawn. He travels about a good
deal to find and reward good boys who are diligent in
their studies, and men who are fitted to rule. In one hand
he carries a crooked staff of bamboo, at the top of which is
hung a book or roll of manuscript. His dress is like
that of a learned doctor, with square cap, stole and high
toed slippers.
Bishamon is the patron of glory and fame. He is a
mighty soldier. He wears a golden helmet, breast-plate
and complete armor. He is the protector of priests and
warriors. He gives them skill in fencing, horsemanship and archery. He holds a pagoda in one hand and a
dragon sword in the other. His pet animal is the tiger.
Six out of the jolly worthies are men. Benten is the
only lady. She is the patron of the family and of the sea.
She plays the flute and the guitar for the others, and
amuses them at their feasts, sometimes even dancing for them. Her real home is in Rin Gu, and she is the
queen of the world under the sea. She often dwells in
the caves of the sea or ocean. Her favorite animal is
the snake and her servants are the dragons.
Once a year the jolly seven meet together to talk over
old times, relate their adventures, and have a luxuriant
supper. Then they proceed to business, which is to
arrange all the marriages for the coming year. They
have a great many skeins of red and white silk, which

riages are unhappy. This work done they begin to frolic
like big boys. Benten plays the guitar, and Bishamon
lies down on the floor resting upon his elbows to hear it.
Hotel drinks wine out of a shallow red cup which is as wide
as a dinner plate. Daikoku and Fukoruku Jin begin to wrestle, and when Daikoku gets his man down he pounds
his big head with an empty gourd, while Toshi-toku and
Eblsu begin to eat tai fish. When this fun is over, Ben
ten and Fukoruku Jin play a game of checkers, while the
others look on and bet; except Hotel, the fat fellow, who
is asleep. Finally they get ashamed of themselves for
gambling, and after a few days, the party breaks up and
each one o-oes to his rea^ular business arain.

Almost the first object which meets the gaze of the
traveler after crossing the Pacific Ocean and as he nears

covered heights rise some 1 3,000 feet above the sea. To
the people of Japan this is the sacred mountain. It is

their drawings. It is described in all their poems and
sacred books. It has a strong hold on the people. It is

votive offering is a larofe lantern,

THE SACRED SHRINES OF ISE.
First for sacredness among the Japanese Shinto temples
are the Shrines of Ise. These are to Japan what Mecca
is to Mohammedan lands and what Jerusalem was to the Holy Land. Thousands of pilgrims visit these shrines
every year. Sir E. J. Reed, thus describes his visit:
" At the entrance we were met by two Shinto priests, who had been deputed to show us the sacred place.

Passing under the torii, we were at once amid trees of
an age and magnitude not often equaled. Within the
temple-Hmits we came first to a small edifice, in which
was the white horse of the deity of the place, which hap

pened to be an artificial horse, the real one having re
cently died, and another not being forthcoming at present,
for reasons which I did not learn. Soon afterward we
came to two livincf black horses, consecrated to the ser
vice of the temple, and more particularly for the god of
the place—'the god of food, clothes and house living,'
according to one authority; or, 'the god of the earth's
produce,' as another has it, to ride upon in the proces
sions of the great temple ceremonials. " There are secondary deities worshiped there, the
chief of whom Is the adopted grandson of the sun-god
dess and the great-grancffather of the first Mikado, Jimmu
Tenno, who commenced his reign in the Japanese year i. According to the legend, the goddess wished to send her adopted son, Oshi-ho-miml-no-mikoto, down upon earth
to subdue It, but he put forth his own son Instead as
leader of the expedition. The goddess then presented

Ninigi-no-mikoto with various treasures, the most im
portant among which—and here we touch upon the cen
tral sacredness ahke of the race of Mikados and of the
symbols of the Shinto faith— were the mirror, sword and
stone, or ball (afterwards the regalia of the Japanese
sovereigns). She also attached to his person the other
two inferior gods of Geku. With reference to the mir
ror, she said, ' Look upon this mirror as my spirit ; keep
it in the same house and on the same floor with yourself and worship it as if you were worshiping my actual
presence.'
" Passing under another torii of plain, unpainted tim
ber, like all the torii of the Ise shrines, we came to the
outer gate of the temple proper, to which alone of three
successive gates we and the other pilgrims were allowed
to approach. With certain extremely rare exceptions,
extending only to the Mikado and commissioners of his,
none but priests are allowed to pass this first gate. It
was an open gate, however, with a simple white curtain or cloth thrown across it, blowing about as the wind
listed. Through this open gate, or past the sides of it,
if you preferred to stand there, you could see the next
gate, and beyond that again was a third, and then came
the temple proper, which could not be seen. This was
all ! The buildings, as far as seen, were all of the plain
est possible kind, not unlike substantial, well-thatched
farm-buildings at home. The mirror at this outer temple
was not the original mirror, and the priest did not for a
moment lead us to suppose that it was. There was, in fact,
no pretence of any kind about the place. The ancient
buildings and the plain white curtain were left to produce
that which is perhaps the deepest and most lasting of all
impressions made by religious externals, namely, that of
combined simplicity and antiquity. Of this outer temple

I need only add, that it is in every respect a sequel and
appendage to the inner and more ancient temple, having
been built by the desire of the goddess of the older Ise
temple, who wished to have the deity Toyouke near her.
This, the outer and later temple, dates from the reign of
the twenty-second Mikado of the present reigning dy

of the imperial dynasty. So all Japan has regarded
it for 2,500 years, even down to 1868, and so most
of the people regard it still. This temple came to be
built in the following manner: The sacred emblems of
the national religion had, up to the time of the great
Mikado Sujin, been kept in the imperial palace or temple;
but he, as some say to increase their safety, and as others
allege because he viewed a rebellion which broke out as
a mark of divine disapprobation of their remaining in his
custody, gave them into the charge of his daughter, in a
temple dedicated to them. They were subsequently re
moved and carried from place to place, but at length, in
the twenty-sixth year of the reign of Suinin Tenno, and
therefore in the year 3 B. C, it was resolved to iix the mirror at the village of Uji on the River Suzugawa, and
there and then the present temple was built. The old
building does not exist. On the contrary, a new temple
is erected every twenty years, but each new temple is an
exact repetition of the original, and therefore the present
one is a perfect representation of the architecture of
Japan at the time of Christ. The principal deity here worshiped is Amaterasu, the sun-goddess herself

and uttering a few words of prayer, thus attained and

Was no blessing pronounced, no simple memorial of some kind presented to them? Nothing; but they all
bought little mementos of the place at the stall in the
grounds or at the shops in the village. What was it they said during the minute or two that they stooped before the shrine ? They no doubt asked for whatever
they wanted in particular, and generally for long life,
and the means of life and happiness in the years to come. " Our companions, the priests, suggested that we ought
to see one of the ceremonial dances of the temple, and to
this we gladly assented on learning that it would not be
a repetition of what we had seen at Osaka and Nara, but
that it was one of "the most ancient description, handed
down from generation to generation at these Ise shrines.
The room had an altar at the end opposite the entrance,
over which v|j^s a large mirror. Round the altar and walks were an abundance of goheis, and of bands and
tassels. At the altar-end of the room a priest sat on one
side, and along each of the side walls were the musicians
and dancers, all sitting on their heels. The musicians,
who were also singers, were all men ; the dancers were
quite young girls attired in white and red, with frontlets
of brass, from each end of which depended a cord and
tassel. On the tops of their heads were large bunches
of flowers; their back hair was in a queue, with tassels
attached, surmounted with gilt bows and ribbons. There
were two equally young girls in red and blue with plainer
head-dresses, who in a certain way attended on the
others. The dance began by a subordinate priest com
ing in by a side entrance with a wet branch of the sacred
sakaki tree in his hand. After bowing to the shrine, he

the same entrance, he handed in to the two blue-and-red
attendants, trays of herbs, rice and fruits in succession.
These were borne ceremoniously elevated to the six
priestesses, who conveyed them in a similar manner to
the altar, placing the contents of the first two trays upon
an inner altar, and those of the remaining four upon an
outer altar, then returning the trays to their two attend
ants, who passed them out of the building.
"While this was proceeding, the band sent forth what
sounded to me as wailing, imploring, importunate sounds,
with an occasional rap upon the drum for emphasis.
The priest, who wore the ancient head-dress like that of
the Mikado, now rose, and after a few obeisances before
the mirror sat down upon his heels, facing the altar, and
intoned a prayer, or novito, from a large sheet of paper
held outspread before him, the musicians, and dancers,
and attendants all sitting with bowed heads to its end.
Small branches of sakaki were now brought to the priestesses, and the dance took place to an accompaniment of livelier music. The dance comprised no very active
movements, but consisted mainly of short, slow and grave promenading, with occasional stately bowings and much
slow waving of the branches. This over, a boy entered,
dressed in the military undress robes of a k^^ge (court
noble) of the olden time, and holding in his hands a
branch of sakaki, with a pendant hoop, doubtless in lieu
of a mirror. He danced, as it is called, to much louder
music, but the dancing was little more than further promenading and making certain sweeping movements with
the branch of sakaki, with an occasional high step. Of
course, it is a great pity for the significance of all this to
be lost; but nothing explanatory could be elicited from
any of the Japanese present, and from the answers of the
priests I infer that if the various movements of these



340 ERROR'S CHAINS.
dances ever had any great and special significance, the
remembrance of it is pretty nearly or quite lost. The
priest next came forward again, and, after elevatino- the
written prayer a tew times beiore the shrine, left the
building by the side door. The process of placing the
fruits and 'other offerings upon the altar was now re
versed, and everything was removed from the altars and
taken away, the music meanwhile playing loud and joy
ous strains. With this ended the most ancient of the
dances in the most sacred national shrine of Japan."
Very great changes have occurred in Japan since the year iS68, when the Mikado became the temporal as
well as the spiritual head of the Empire. The interests
of Shintoism have suffered in the change. Prof Max
Miiller estimates that there are now only 200,000 Shin
toists in all Japan.

passed through its borders ; along its coasts travelers have wandered, but few have, until recently, pushed on
into the interior. Even to-day there are vast regions
unexplored. Of the millions of peoples inhabiting these
parts we know only that which the Arab slave- dealers,

been known for many years. The interior, stretching
back from Upper Egypt, and extending clear across to
the River Niger, has been but little traveled by foreigners.
From Zanzibar on the south-east, radiating like a fan,
explorers have passed to the great lakes to the north
west, the Victoria Nyanza and Albert Nyanza, to the
west to Tanganyika Lake, and to the south-west, the Nyassa and Bangweolo Lakes. To the west of these
lakes, saving only the countries lying along the banks of
the Lualaba, Livingstone, or Congo River, along which
Stanley traveled, the land is almost unknown.

Even of the African peoples among whom Europeans
have Hved, it is difficult to learn much of their religions.
First, because they have no sacred books, no records, in
fact no writinti at all. Their traditions and teachings
have all been handed down by word ot mouth. Again,
the Africans are unwilling to tell foreigners about their
religious beliefs, customs and worships. It is difficult to
gain their confidence. When one asks them about it,
they give evasive answers, or pretend to know nothing
about the matter. This fact has led to the supposition
that some of these peoples had no religious nature what
ever, but that they formed an exception to the general
evidence in favor of man's religious nature.
Yet travelers have by patient investigation, obser
vation and inquiry learned considerable. They have
compared their conclusions, and have so been able to
give us some idea of the gods and religions of Africa.
The Africans have no buildings of brick or stone, and
have no knowledge, seemingly, of writing. These two facts have been brought to show that the Africans must have
left the rest of the family of mankind very soon after the
Deluge. The Africans are, with the exception of some of the South Sea Islanders, and the Aborigines of Aus
tralia, the most degraded people on the face of the earth.
But here and there among them are small nations who
are intelligent, and shrewd, and possessed ot capabilities
which place them above their fellow-Africans. The
African peoples are of all shades of color, from blackest
black to purest white, and just so do they vary very
greatly in point of intelligence. Yet the best are very
degraded, and the worst are but little above the beasts
of field or forest. If the Gospel of Jesus Christ is

AFRICAN BELIEF IN A GOD OR GODS.
There are to be found even yet traces of the high
position from which the Africans have fallen in their
degradation. One of these traces is the universal belief
in a God or gods. This, of course, is no such exalted •



^AA EJiliOJi'S CHAINS.
idea of a Supreme Being as is to be found among
Cliristian nations or even among the better nations of
heathens, but still it is a Great One in whom they believe.
This belief is not the result of reasoning, of observation
of the powers of nature or of study of their own human
nature, but is an inborn conception. Apart from revela
tion, apart from argument, from cause and effect, from design, from government or from anything else, men
must believe in a God or gods. Hence we are not as
tonished at finding that among all the Africans there is
this belief Many of their ideas of God are horrible,
shocking and revolting, others again attach no evil ideas
to their gods, but exalt them in a very high degree.
PRAYING FOR RAIN.
In South-eastern Africa, along the Zambesi River, the people pray to a god, with whom they connect no impure
traditions or degraded worship. When in danger of war
or famine, they appeal to this god. They call him Mpambi.
The worship is of this kind: When famine is threat
ened because rain is withheld, the people of a village re
sort to a cleared space of ground, inclosed by a fence.
Here a prayer-hut is erected. Women and men worship
together. Generally a princess having in one hand a
basket containing Indian corn-meal, and in the other a
pot of native beer, or Pombi, goes into the hut, where she can be seen and heard. She puts the basket and
jar on either side of her and sprinkling a handful of meal on the floor, cries, 'Tmva Mpambi, Adza moula!" (Hear, O God, and send rain !) The people respond by
gendy clapping their hands and chanting, Hear, O God
!
This is repeated until all the meal is used up. Then the
jar of Pombi is emptied on the floor. The woman then
comes out of the hut, closing the door. Throwing them



7 HE DARK CONTINENT. , .r
•selves upon their backs, she and the people unite in pray
ing "Hear, O God, send rain!" Then she arises, washes
herseh" in a jar of water which stands before the chief.
Then all the women take their calabash cups and throw
the water into the air, with frantic gesticulations.
Among the Zulus the lightning and thunder were represented as coming from "The Lord in Heaven." If light
ning struck and killed the cattle the people were not dis
tressed. It was said "The Lord has slaughtered for Himself among His own flock. Is it yours? Is it not the Lord's?
He is hungry ; He kills for Himself" If a village is
struck with lightning and a cow is killed, they say "This
village will be prosperous." If a man is killed, thus they
said, "The Lord has found fault with him." When they
pray for rain, the heads of the village select some black
oxen (like the black clouds which bring rain) and one is
killed in sacrifice. Its flesh is eaten in the house in
silence. The bones are burnt outside of the village.
After this a song is sung, or hummed, for no words are used.
THE Hottentots' god, gounja gounja.
The Hottentots call God " Gounja Gounja " or "Gounja
Ticquoa." They are said to have no divine worship, and
few, if any, religious ceremonies, and, in their savage
state, appear a very stupid race, almost void of the power
of reason, without any knowledge of divine subjects, and
but a vague notion that there is one great Lord of all, and
likewise an evil spirit, a devil. They observe a yearly
festival when the seven stars appear together, at the
beg-inning of summer. The parents wake their children
when these stars appear, and go with them into the
fields, where they dance and sing. Their song is, " O
Ticquoa, thou Father over our heads, give us rain, that
all our fruits may ripen and we may have food in plenty."

gods. The Mohammedans and the Portuguese and
English traders have of late years affected the peoples'
notions to some extent; but from the descriptions of
earlier travelers we can see what their belief was. In
Sierra Leone they called God " Canou ;" on the Gambia
River, they called their god " China." The Niam-Niams call their god " Noro."
Among the Africans are found many traditions of the
origin of the world and of men. Among the Zulus, the
following tradition is held, which will serve as a specimen :
ZULU TRADITION OF THE ORIGIN OF MEN.
Umkululu, the first man, had his origin in a valley of
this world, where there was a bed of reeds. He sprung
from the bed of reeds, and a woman (a wife) sprung from
the same bed of reeds after him. They had but one name, that of Umkulunkulu ; and men sprung from Um
kulunkulu by generation. All things, as well as Umku
lunkulu, sprung from a bed of reeds ; everything, both
animals and corn coming into being with him. He
looked upon the sun when it was finished, and said
:
"There is a torch which shall give you light, that you
may see." He looked on the cattle, and said : " There
are cattle ; be ye broken off", and let the cattle be your
food ; eat their flesh and drink their milk." He looked
on wild animals, and said : " That is such an animal
;
that is an elephant ; that is a buffalo." He looked on
the fire, and said: " Kindle it, and cook, and warm your
self, and eat meat when in has been dressed by the fire."
He looked on all things, and said : " So-and-so is the
name of everything." Amonof the Basutos there is a legend that men and
animals came from the interior of the earth, out of an immense hole.



548 EKKO/i'S CHAINS.
GOOD AND BAD SPIRITS.
Between the Supreme Being and man, the Africans
believe that there are a vast number of spirits. They
are not afraid of God, but they have an intense dread of
tliese spirits. They believe that God is too far off to
hurt them much, but they believe that the world of spirits is around them. Even when God does send lightning
or thunder, lor instance, it is because the spirits bring
them down. To their imaginations these spirits people
the darkness with hideous shapes, poison the light with
their presence, sweep over the plains in the forms of wild
beasts, fill the forests, inhabit trees, live on the tops of
the mountains, and in the secluded recesses of caves and
valleys ; make their homes in the sea, the lakes and the
rivers ; the air is full of them, the earth teems with them;
fire is not free from their presence, and human beings
are possessed by them. To them, also, they attribute the sorrows and the
sufferings, the
m isfortunes,
and, in most
cases, the deaths of mankind.
As elsewhere,
there are men
who take advan
tage of the su
perstitious con
dition of their
fellow countrymen, and make gain ofit. Three priests once assured their followers that they could raise

an idol out of the ground, and would do it the next day.
During the night they dug a hole, in which they placed a
lot of dried peas and an idol's head and shoulders. They
covered all up carefully. Just before daylight they took some water and poured it upon the peas. The people
gathered early in the morning to see the priests keep
their promise. They came forth, and, as the peas gradu
ally swelled, began their incantations and murmurings,
and, of course, very soon the idol appeared, and the de
luded people were abundantly satisfied.
THE SPIRIT IN THE INSECT.
The Hottentots believed that the good spirits some
times came in the form of a winded insect, having- a ereen
back, a belly speckled with white and red, and with two
horns. They worshiped this insect wherever they found it.
If this insect alighted on a Hottentot he was looked
upon as a man without fault, and distinguished and rev
erenced as a sacred person ever after. His neighbors
gloried that they had such a favored mortal amongst
them, and published the fact far and near. The fattest
ox belonging to the kraal was killed as a thank-offering;,
and all the people kept festival for days. The case was
in every respect the same if the insect alighted upon a
woman ; she was regarded as a sanctified person and the
delight of the spirit. The son of a German, who had given leave to some
Hottentots to turn their cattle upon his land, was amusing
himself one day in the kraal, when this insect appeared.
The Hottentots immediately ran tumultuously to adore
it, while the young German ran to catch it, in order to
see what the effect would be amongst them. He seized
it in the midst of them. The cry of agony was general
when they saw it in his hands. They stared with dis



35° EKJWK'S CHAINS.
traction in their eyes at him and at one another. "See,
see, see!" said they. "What is he going to do? Will he kill it?" They were wild through apprehension of its
fate. "Why," said he, "do you make such a hideous
noise; and why are you in such agony about this paltry
creature?" "Ah!" they replied, with utmost concern,
"it is a divinity. It is come from Heaven. It is come on
a o;ood desien. Do not hurt it; do not offend it. We
are the most miserable wretches on earth if you do. This
ground will lie under a curse, and the crime will never
be forgiven." This was not enough for the young German, who determined to carry the experiment a little
further, and made as thou'^h he certainly intended to
maim or destroy it. f)n this the people ran about, and
screamed as though they were frantic; they fell prostrate on the ground before him, and with streaming eyes and
loudest cries besought him to spare the creature and
give it its liberty. Having sufficiently tested the reality
of their belief in this insect-god, he let it fly, and they
shouted in all the transports of joy.
FETKIi WORSHIP.
A fetich is some material object in which a god or
a supernatural power is supposed to dwell. An idol is
a representation of a god. Fetichism is the lowest form
of idolatry. Fetichism and witchcraft go together.
The fetiches guard against the power of witches, and
this is their primary object. They act as charms or amu
lets, and are worn on all parts of the body to keep off
disease; are placed around the houses, villages or fields
to keep off hurtful influences. The fetiches are of vari
ous sorts ; the reeds of certain plants, the roots of cer
tain trees, the horns of a diminutive deer, the claws and
teeth of lions and leopards and other sorts of animals,

slips of wood fantastically notched, knuckle-bones, beads
and a kind of white stone, being most commonly used.
Amongst the Kaffirs, whose belief in witchcraft is in

tense, faith in the virtues of fetiches is, as a natural conse
quence, equally great. You rarely meet with a Kaffir
who does not carry with him a whole series of charms.



352 ££:/WA"S CHAINS,
These, of course, are furnished by the witch-doctors and
prophets, and as they are not of the least intrinsic value,
and are highly paid for, the business of making fetich is
a profitable one. To a European a superstitious Kaffir
has a very ludicrous appearance, as the following de
scription of a man who seems to have been peculiarly
impressible to the value of fetich will show. His head was richly bedecked
with pig's bristles, set
straight, so as to stand
out on all sides like the
quills of a hedgehog,
with many feathers on
his head, while around his neck there was strung a great number of charms, the
>rincipal ofwhich were
fragments of bone, the
head of a snake, the
tooth of a young hippopotamus, and an

'iC?f The Africans be

lieve that there are
lucky fetiches which _^y guarantee them suc

dertakings. They re
spect one another's fetiches, and will not attack an
enemy when they think that he has a fetich superior to
their own. They are therefore very ready, and eager to
discover wherein special excellence may lie. A fetich of
supposed superiority will command a high price.

After devouring the bodies of their victims, the priests of the people of Bonny were wont to talic the skulls and place them in the walls of their temples.

A HORRIBLE FETICH.
When hard pressed in war, and in danger of being
utterly overthrown, in some parts of Africa, the people

like the king of Moab, who sacrificed his own son when
the battle went against him, in order to move the compas
sion of his adversaries, or to inspire them with terror, or
as a sacrifice to offended gods—will make horrible fe
tiches of human beings. Perhaps the most astounding
instance of such a practice occurred in West Africa.
The king of Bonny having been defeated in battle, re
treated to his principal town, and finding that it was in
imminent dano-er of being: attacked, called together his
magicians in order that they might aid him in repelling
his enemies. They were equal to the emergency. The
people were assembled in front of the principal gate of
the town. Two holes were dug in the ground close to
each other. The wizards then begun their operations, and when the people had been wrought up by their pro
ceedings to a pitch of unreasoning excitement, so that they were ready to perpetrate any act no matter how
horrible, the chief of the wizards pointed to a girl who
was standing amongst the spectators. She was instantly
seized, and, under his direction, her legs were thrust into
the holes that had been prepared for this purpose, which
were then filled up with earth so that she could not extri
cate herself from them. Then a number of men brouo-ht lumps of wet clay, which they built around her body in
the form of a pillar, kneading them closely as they pro
ceeded, until she was entirely covered over. This device
produced the desired effect, for so terrified were the
hostile tribes at what they regarded as an invincible
fetich—or greegree, as the fetich is called in West Africa

that they dared not attack the town, and, like the kings



356 EJiJiOJi'S CHAINS.
of Israel and Judah, after the sacrifice of the king of
Moab's son, they withdrew from the further prosecution
of the war, and returned to their homes.
The clay pillar, with the body of the girl within it, stood
for several years where it had been erected, and served
effectually to preserve the town from being again attacked or in any way troubled by its enemies.
STANLEY AND THE AFRICANS' FEAR OF FETICH.
The Africans have a superstitious dread of writing and
regard it as a bad fetich. When the African traveler,
Stanley, had almost finished his journey through the
Dark Continent, he was one day
making some entries in his note
book. This book contained all
the important results of his great
journey. Seeing him writing the savages surrounded him and
demanded that he destroy the
" tara-tara," as they called it, lest
it should injure them. They
said that those black lines on
the paper would bring sickness and death to them and their
animals unless the book was
burned. The savages were de
J termined to get the book. Only
by a trick could he save either
the book or his own life. He went to his tent and managed to
exchange his note-book for a
copy of Shakespeare's works.
This he burned "to please his friends," as he told them.
The Africans have idols of all shapes and sizes and

chance, but it is charged to witchcraft. The witches
must be found out and tortured to confession and death.
" I was asked," says Du Chaillu, whose representations
of witchcraft superstitions are abundantly confirmed by
other travelers and missionaries, " to go and see an old
friend of mine, Mpomo, wlio was sick. They had spent
the nicrht before drumming about his bed to drive out
the devil. But I soon saw that neither drumming nor
medicine would help the poor fellow. Tlie film of death
was in his eyes. He held out his hand to me and feebly
said: 'Chall}^, save me, for I am dying.' "He was surrounded by hundreds of people, most of
them moved to .tears by their friend's pitiable condition.
1 explained to him, that I had no power to save him; but
he and all around had the conviction that if I only wished
I could cure him. They followed me to my house, asking
for medicine. Not to seem heartless, I sent him something to make his remaining moments easy. At the same time I warned them that he would die and they must not blame me. When I awoke the next morning I heard the mournful wail which proclaimed that poor Mpomo had
gone to his long rest. The cry of the African mourners
is the saddest I ever heard. They mourn literally as
those who have no hope.
"In the afternoon I heard talk of witchcraft. On the
day Mpomo was buried proceedings were begun to discover who had bewitched him. A great doctor was brought from up the river, and for two nights and days
incantations were repeated. On the third morning, when
old and young, male and female, were frantic with the
desire of revenge, the doctor began his final incantations. Every man and boy was armed with spears, or guns, or
axes. The whole town was possessed by a thirst for
human blood. For the first time I found my voice with

Kx. a motion from the doctor, the people became still.
This silence lasted about a minute when the loud voice of the doctor was heard : ' There is a very black woman who
lives in a house,' describing it, ' she bewitched Mpomo.'
The crowd, roaring and screaming, rushed frantically for
the place indicated. They seized upon a poor girl named
Okondaga, the sister of my good friend and guide Adouma. Waving their weapons over her head, they
tore her away to the water-side, bound her with cords,
and then rushed back to the doctor again. "As poor Okondaga passed by in the hands of her murderers, she saw me, though I had turned away not to
be seen, for I could not help her. I heard her cry out,
' Chally, Chally, do not let me die !' It was a moment of agony; I was minded to rush into the crowd and rescue
the poor victim. But I should only have sacrificed my
life, without helping her. So I hid myself behind a tree,
and, I confess it, shed bitter tears.
"Presently silence fell once more upon the crowd.
Then the voice of the devilish doctor arain rangf over the
town, like the croak of a raven, 'There is an old woman
in a house,' describing it, ' she bewitched Mpomo.' " The crowd rushed off and seized a niece of King
Ouenguesa, a noble-hearted and majestic old woman.
As they crowded about with flaming eyes, she rose
proudly from the ground, looked them in the face unflinchingly, and motioning them to keep their hands off
said, T will drink the mboundou, but woe to my accusers if
I do not die.' She was escorted to the river without being
bound. She submitted without a tear or a murmur.
" A third time the dreadful silence fell upon the town,
and the doctor's voice was heard : ' There is a woman
with six children. She lives on a plantation toward

the rising sun. Slie, too, bewitched Mpomo.' Another
furious shout, and in a few moments they brought to the river one of Quenguesa's slaves, a good woman, whom I knew. The doctor now, in a loud voice, recited
the crime of which these women were accused. Okon
daga, he said, some weeks before, asked Mpomo for
some salt, and he refused her. She had said unpleasant
things to him, and had by sorcery taken his life. "Then Oueno-uesa's niece was accused. She had no
children, and Mpomo had children. She envied him, and had bewitched him. "Quenguesa's slave had asked Mpomo for a looking
glass. He had refused her. Therefore she had killed
him with sorcery. As each accusation was repeated, the
people broke out into curses. Even the relatives of the
poor victims were obliged to join in this. Every one
rivaled his neighbor in cursing, each fearful lest luke
warmness should expose him to a like fate. . . .
"The victims were put into a large canoe with the
executioners, the doctor, and a number of the people, all armed. Then the tam-tams were beaten, and the
mboundou quabi was prepared. Mpomo's eldest brother
held the poisoned cup to his sister's lips. At sight of it poor Okondaga began to cry, and even Quenguesa's
niece turned pale, for the negro face has at such times a
pallor quite perceptible. The mug of mboundou was
handed to the old slave woman, then to the royal niece,
and last to Okondaga. As they drank the multitude
shouted: 'If they are witches let the mboundou kill
them, if they are innocent let the mboundou go out' "Suddenly the slave woman fell down. She had not
touched the bottom of the boat before her head was hacked off by a dozen swords. Next came Quenguesa's
niece. In an instant her head was cut off, and her blood



THE DAIiK CONTINENT. 3&I
was dyeing the waters. Meantime poor Okondaga stag
gered, and struggled, and cried, vainly resisting the work
ing of the poison in her system. Last of all, she fell. Then all became confused. A random hacking ensued,
and in an incredibly short time the bodies were cut in
small pieces which were cast into the river.
"After this the crowd dispersed to their houses, and for
the rest of the day the town was silent. Some of these
rude people felt that the number in their almost extinguished tribe was becoming less, and the dread of death
filled their hearts. In the evening poor Adouma came
secretly to my house, to unburden his sorrowing heart.
He, too, had been compelled to take part in the dreadful
scene. He dared not refrain from joining in the curses heaped upon his poor sister. He dared not mourn pub
licly for her. I comforted him as well as I could, and I spoke to him of the true God, and of the wickedness of
the conduct we had witnessed. He said at last, 'O
Chally, when you go back to your far country, America, let them send men to us poor people to teach us from
that which you call God's mouth,' meaning the Bible. I promised Adouma to give the message, and I now do so."
God pity poor Africa! May the Light of the Sun of Righteousness soon shine on her dark land!

CHAPTER XVII.
THE " GREAT SPIRIT " OK AMERICA.
Darin besteht L-ben die Bedeutung der Amerikanislien Religionen, dass sie mehr als andene, wenigsteiis mehrals andere Religionen von Kulturvolkern, das primitive und unabgeschwachte Heidenthum dar
stellen.

Dr. J. G. Muller.
^ 1 ^HE religion of the American Indians and Alask
I ans partakes of the character of their national
-*- life ; yet there are traces of the original ideas
of God, the creation and early history of man and the
world, which we find in the religions of the far East
ern nations. As we have before said, we believe the
early inhabitants of America to have come from the
eastern shores of Asia, having been washed along in
their fishing vessels by the current of the Kuro Shiwo
(or black stream), flowing by the western coasts of
America, or perhaps crossing on the islands of the North Pacific, where Asia and America almost come together.
They differ from the peoples of Eastern Asia, but, per
haps, only in such points as a different climate and dif
ferent habits of life would produce.
All the people of the continent of America appear to have come from one stock. The squalid Esquimaux at
one extremity of the chain, the polished Aztec or Inca at
thfe other; agriculturists, and hunters, and canoe-men;
tribes frequenting the shores of the great northern lakes,
or scattered in the dense savannahs of the South ; all
their languages grow out of a few flexible tongues. They



THE "GREAT SPIRIT'' OF AMERICA. 363
bear a resemblance to the Turanian languages—the Ma
laysian, the Japanese and others. We can divide the
American peoples into two classes—the civilized and the
savage. To the first class belong the -Mexicans and
Peruvians ; to the latter, the savages of North America,
including the Red Indians, the Alaskans and the inhabit
ants of the West Indies, and wild tribes of South America

the Patagonians, Guianians, etc.
THE INDIANS OF NORTH AMERICA.
These nations have the virtues of savage life—a sense
of honor, according to their perceptions of duty, mutual
fidelity among
individuals, a
fortitude which
mocks at the
most cruel tor
ments, and a
devotedness to
their own tribe
which makes
self-immolation
in its defense
easy. On the
other hand, they
treat their wives
brutally, and
their children
with indifference. The apathy under the good and ill of
life which the Stoic affected is the grand element of the
Indian's character. Gloomy, stern and severe, he is, it
would seem, a stranger to mirth and laughter; yet, in
their legends, frequent reference is made to laughter.
All outward expressions of pain or pleasure he regards

364 ERROR'S CHAINS.
as a weakness ; and the only feeling to which he ever
yields is the boisterous joy which he manifests in the
moment of victory, or under the excitement of intoxica
tion He is capable of great exertions in war or the chase,
but has an unconquerable aversion to regular labor. He
is extremely improvident ; eats enormously while he has
an abundance of food, without thinking of the famine
which may follow ; and, when liquors are supplied to
him, will continue drunk for days. Corresponding to the
priests among other peoples, the Indians have " Medicine
Men ;" they believe that these possess great power, and
they trust implicitly in all their directions.
THE GREAT SPIRIT.
Most of the Indians of North America believe in the
existence of a supreme being, whom they call the Great
Spirit; and of a subordinate one, whose nature is evil
and hostile to man. To the latter their worship is princi
pally addressed ; the Good Spirit, in their opinion, needing
no prayers to induce him to aid and protect His creatures.
They generally believe in a future state, in which the
souls of brave warriors and chaste wives enjoy a tranquil
and happy existence with their ancestors and friends,
spending their time in those exercises in which they de
lighted when on earth. The Dakotas believe that the road
to these "villages of the dead " leads over a rock with an
edge as sharp as a knife, on which only the good are
able to keep their footing. The wicked fall off and de
scend to the region of the Evil Spirit, where they are
hard-worked, and often flogged by their relentless master.
WORSHIP OF ANCESTORS.
As we shall find among the Chinese, the Indians wor
shiped the spirits of their dead ancestors. As among the



INDIAN MEDICINE MEN,
Showing the hideous costumes nnd decorations they sometimes assume in tltcir incantations.






THE ''GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. 365
Chinese, the periodical offering of cakes, libations, flesh
or viands at the grave to ancestors, is seen to be an idea
incorporated into the practice of the American, at least
the Algonic Indians. These Indians, believing in the
twofold nature of the soul, and that the soul sensorial
abides for a time with the body in the grave, requiring
food for its ghostly existence and journeyings, deposit
meat and other food at and after the time of interment.
This custom is universal, and was one of their earliest
traits.
Few things in savage life are of more singular interest
Chan the ceremonies of a burial. Some of the tribes^
for instance, take the body ot their dead, and having
clothed it in the best robes and ornaments, furnish it
with many articles which are supposed most desirable,
and, wrapping the whole carefully in soft, wet hides, place
the precious burden on a scaffold several feet high. In
the course of time, the scaffold falls; then the relatives as
semble and bury the remains, except the skull ; this they
place on the ground, where there are perhaps a hundred
skulls in a circle, all looking inward. About this place of
skulls the women an; often seen, sitting with their work for
hours at a time, holding in their laps the skull of a dead
child ; and not unfrequently they are seen to clasp these
skulls in their arms and lie down, talking as if to a living
child, until they fall asleep.
The Sioux Indians wrap their dead in skins, and lodge
them in the branches of trees, never forgetting to place
a wooden dish near the head, that the friend may quench
his thirst in the long journey he is supposed to have
begun.
Among the Patagonians the dead are frequently re
duced to skeleton before burial, and are Avashed and
arrayed in new clothing once a yean The bodies, while

being prepared, are laid on platforms and guarded by the
reladves, who, dressed in long robes, strike the ground
continually with spears or staves, and keep up a mournful
song to drive away the Spirits, who they fear are un
friendly to the dead.



THE "GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. 567
The Indians, like the Africans, worship fetiches or
material objects in which either the gods
personally or some supernatural power is
supposed to dwell. It not infrequently hap
pens that if an Indian dreams of an idol or
fetich of a certain form, when he wakes he
proceeds to make it according to the pattern
of his vision, and this is the secret history
of many of the grotesque forms which are favorite symbols with them in their sacred
rites. These they designate Manitos.
INDIAN LEGENDS.
The Indians' hopes, fears, worships, and
whole faith and life are found in their leg-ends
and myths. These are preserved by oral tradition, by being handed down by word of mouth from generation to generation. In
the leisure from hunting or war, they gather in the lodge
or about the camp-fire and rehearse these stories. As
Longfellow has sungf:
INDIAN IMAGE. Seen in a dream'
and made by a
Medicine Man.
"Should you ask me, whence these stories? ^yhence these legends and traditions. With the odors of the forest, With the dew and damp of meadows. With the curling smoke of wigwams. With the rushing of great rivers,
With their frequent repetitions, And their wild reverberations, As of thunder in the mountains ? I should answer, I should tell you, I repeat them as I heard them From the lips of Nawadaha.
"Ye whose hearts are fresh and simple. Who have faith in God and Nature,



368 £A'A'OA"S CHAINS.
Who believe, that in all ages Every human heart is human, That in even savage bosoms There are longings, yearnings, strivings For the good they comprehend not. That the feeble hands and helpless, Groping blindly in the darkness. Touch God's right hand in that darkness And are lifted up and strengthened."
THE "SONG OF -HIAWATHA."
Hiawatha is a personage of miraculous birth, whom
the Indians believed to have been sent among them to
clear their rivers, forests and fishing-grounds, and to
teach them the arts of peace. To the patient, toilsome
investigations of Dr. H. R. Schoolcraft, our knowledge
of Indian legends is due. The poet, Longfellow", has
gracefully woven many of these legends together in his "Song of Hiawatha."
Hiawatha is rerarded as the messens^er of the Great
Spirit, sent down to them in the character of a wise man,
and a prophet. But he comes clothed with all the attri
butes of humanity, as well as the power of performing
miraculous deeds. He adapts himself perfectly to their manners, customs and ideas. He is brought up from a
child among them. He is made to learn their mode of
life. He takes a wife, builds a lodee, hunts and fishes
like the rest of them, sings his war soiigs and medicine
songs, goes to war, has his triumphs, has his friends and
foes, suffers, wants, hungers, is in dread or joy; and, in
fine, undergoes all the vicissitudes of his fellows. His
miraculous gifts and powers are always adapted to his
situation. When he is swallowed by a great fish, with
his canoe, he escapes by the exertion of these powers,
but always, as much as possible, in accordance with



THE "GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. 369
Indian maxims and means. He is provided with a magic
canoe, which goes where it is bid ; yet, in his fight with
the great Wampura prince, he is counseled by a wood
pecker to know where the vulnerable point of his antag
onist lies. He rids the earth of monsters and giants,
and clears away windfalls and obstructions to the navi
gation of streams. But he does not do these feats by
miracles; he employs strong men to help him. When
he means to destroy the great serpents, he changes him
self into an old tree, and stands on the beach till they come out of the water to bask in the sun. Whatever
man could do in strength or wisdom he could do. But he never does things above the comprehension or belief
of his people; and whatever else he is, he is always true
to the character of an Indian.
He leaps over extensive regions of country, like an
ignis-fatiMs, the false light caused by the vapors of the
swamp which misleads the traveler. He appears sud
denly like an incarnation of a god, or saunters over
weary wastes a poor and starving hunter. His voice is at one moment deep and sonorous as a thunder-clap, and
at another clothed with the softness of feminine supplica
tion. Such is the character of whom Lono-fellow has sung.
INDIAN ALLEGORY OF WINTER AND SPRING.
An old man was sitting in his lodge, by the side of a
frozen stream. It was the close of winter, and his fire
was almost out. He appeared very old and very deso
late. His locks were white with age, and he trembled in
every joint. Day after day he passed in solitude, and he heard nothing but the sounds of the tempest, sweeping
before it the new-fallen snow.
One day, as his fire was just dying, a handsome young
man approached and entered his dwelling. His cheeks



370 £JfA'OJ?'S CHAINS.
were red with the blood of youth, his eyes sparkled with
animation, and a smile played upon his lips. He walked
with a light and quick step. His forehead was bound
with a wreath of sweet grass, in place of a warrior's,
frontlet, and he carried a bunch of flowers in his hand.
" I blow my breath," said the old man, " and the streams
stand still. The water becomes stiff and hard as clear
stone."
"I breathe," said the young man, "and flowers spring
up all over the plains."
" I shake my locks," retorted the old man, " and snow
covers the land. The leaves fall from the trees at my command, and my breath blows them away. The birds
get up from the water and fly to a distant land. The
animals hide themselves from my breath, and the very ground becomes as hard as flint."
"I shake my ringlets," rejoined the young man, "and
warm showers of soft rain fall upon the earth. The
plants lift up their heads out of the earth, like the eyes.
of children glistening with delight. My voice recalls the
birds. The warmth of my breath unlocks the streams.
Music fills the groves wherever I walk, and all nature
rejoices."
At length the sun beean to rise. A gentle warmth
oo o
came over the place. The tongue of the old man be
came silent. The robin and bluebird began to sing on
the top of the lodge. The stream began to murmur by
the door, and the fragrance of growing herbs and flowers
came softly on the vernal breeze.
Daylight fully revealed to the young man the character
of his entertainer. When he looked upon him, he had
the icy visage of Peboan. Streams began to flow from
his eyes. As the sun increased, he grew less and less in stature, and anon had melted completely away. No



THE ''GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. ,«j
thing remained on the place of his lodge-fire but the mis
kodeed, a small white flower, with a pink border, which
is one of the earliest species of northern plants.
ALASKANS' WORSHIP OF EVIL SPIRITS.
The Thlinkets, an Alaskan tribe, will illustrate the
worship of the Alaskans generally. Their religion is a
feeble Polytheism. Yehl is the maker of wood and
waters. He put the sun, moon and stars in their places.
He lives in the east, near the head-waters of the Naass
River. He makes himself known in the east v\'ind
"Ssankheth," and his abode is "Nass-shak-yehl."
At that time the sun, moon and stars were kept by a
rich chief in separate boxes, which he allowed no one to
touch. Yehl, by strategy, secured and opened these
boxes, so that the moon and stars shone in the sky.
When the sun-box was opened, the people, astonished at
the unwonted glare, ran off into the mountains, woods,
and even into the water, becoming animals or fish. He also provided fire and water. Having arranged every
thing for the comfort of the Thlinkets, he disappeared
where neither man nor spirit can penetrate.
As the good spirits, from the very nature of the case,
will not harm them, the Alaskans pay but little attention
to them. They give their chief attention to propitiating
the evil spirits, so that their religion practically resolves
itself into devil-worship or demonolatry. This is called
Shamanism, or the giving of offerings to evil spirits to
prevent them from doing mischief to the offerer. It is
said to have been the old religion of the Tartar race
before the introduction of Buddhism, and is still that of
the Siberians. Indeed, Paul long ago declared, "the
things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to
devils and not to God " The one whose office it is to



-,-,-, ERJiOJi'S CHAINS. '
•
perform these rites is called a shaman, and is the sorcerer
or medicine -man of the tribes. The shaman has controlj
not only of the spirits, but, through the spirits, of disease,
of the elements, and of nature; he holds in his power
success or misfortune, blessing- or cursing. "The honor,"
says Dall, "with which a shaman is regarded depends
on the number of spirits under his control, who, properly
employed contribute largely to his wealth."
INDIAN SUN-WORSHIP.
We are informed that the worship of the sun lies at
the foundation of all the ancient mythologies, deeply enveloped as they are, when followed over Asia Minor
and Europe, in symbolic and linguistic subtleties and re
finements. The symbolic fires erected on temples and
altars to Baal, Chemash and Moloch, burned brightly in
the valley of the Euphrates long before the pyramids of
Egypt were erected, or its priestly-hoarded hieroglyphic
wisdom resulted in a phonetic alphabet. In Persia these
altars were guarded and religiously fed by a consecrated
body of magical priesthood, who recognized a Deit}' in
the essence of an eternal fire and a world-pervading
light.
The same dogma, derived apparently from the east and
not from the west, through Europe, was fully installed at
Atacama and Cuzco, in Peru, at Cholulu, on the magnif
icent and volcano-lighted peaks of Mexico, and along the
fertile deltas of the Mississippi valley. Altar-beds for a
sacred fire, lit to the Great Spirit, under the name and
symbolic form of Cuzis, or the sun, where the frankin
cense of the nicotiana was offered, with hymns and genu
flections, have been discovered, in many instances, under
the earth-heaps and artificial mounds and places of
sepulture of the ancient inhabitants. Intelligent Indians

yet living among the North American tribes, point out
the symbol of the sun, in their ancient muzzinabikons or
rock-inscriptions, and also amid the ideographic tracery
and bark-scrolls of the hieratic, or priestly inscriptions,
and of the magical medicine-songs.
AMAZON SUN-WORSHIP.
We turn away to the savage tribes of South America and find many of the forms of faith and worship which we have seen among the Northern Indians and among
the nations of the Eastern world at about the time of the
dispersion of the nations. Thus among the Amazon In
dians of Western Brazil, we find the same worship of
the sun that we have seen in Egypt, in Assyria, in Japan,
and amono; the Indians of North America. A traveler among them says: "A sound fell upon our ear§ that seemed
to issue from the depths of a distant cavern. We could
tell it to be a chorus of voices, chanting some sad or sol
emn refrain. As we listened it grew louder, as if the
chanters were drawing nearer; and in the same degree, it was becoming more joyful. All at once a procession
appeared approaching the spot, men marching two and
two, with files of women intermingled.
"As its head emerged from among the thick-standing
"tree-trunks, we recognized our old Zummate friends,
dressed in all the gala of a grand holiday, with plumed
• circlets upon their heads, feather armlets, and garters of
the same, girt just below the knee. "On reaching the malocca, they broke ranks, at the
same time bursting into peals of joyous laughter. Then
surrounding they embraced us, the chief in a speech
again making us welcome to their village.
" We soon discovered the cause of their absence from
home with all these mysterious proceedings. The day

was a grand festival—a religious ceremony annually observed by the tribe, when every man, woman and child go
forth into the woods, to worship the sun. "There, near the mouth of the Amazon, and amid the mountains of Guiana, is iound the same culte, observed
by the ancient Peruvians in the days of PIzarro. and the
Mexicans before Cortez Christianized them."
THE ARAUCANIANS.
The Araucanlans, In the north-western part of South
America, believe In a supreme being, and In many sub
ordinate spirits, good and bad. They believe also In
omens and divinations, but they have neither temples nor
idols, nor religious rites; and discover upon the whole
so little aptitude for the reception of religious Ideas that
the Catholic missionaries that have settled among them
have had very little success in Imbuing their minds with
a knowledge of Christianity. They believe In a future
state, and have a confused tradition respecting a deluge from which some persons were saved on a high moun
tain ; but in other respects religious knowledge Is lacking.
PATAGONIA.
The religion of the Patagonlan Is a Polytheism, the
natives believing that there are great numbers of deities,
some good and some evil. Each family is under the guardianship of one of the good deities, and all the mem
bers of that family join him when they die. Beside these
gods there are subordinate demons, good to their own
friends, but bad toward all others; so that, on the whole,
the bad predominates In them. They are called by the
name of Vallchu.
Yet, among some of the Patasfonlan tribes, there Is
a considerable approach to personal religion. It has been



TTrF. "GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. o-g
thought with some reason that they are totally destitute of
religion. This, however, is certainly not the case, as even
our limited knowledge of these people, their language
and their habits show that, even though they may not
possess any definite system of worship, they are still im
pressed with the idea of some Being infinitely greater
than themselves, who knows everything that they do.
Thus they believe in an omniscient Being ; and such a
belief as this, limited and imperfect though it may be, is
yet a step in the right direction.
To this unknown Being they return thanks for a sup
ply of food after a long famine ; so that we find them
acknowledging that the great Being, who knows all their
deeds, watches over them and is the giver of all good
things. When, for example, they have procured a seal,
after having been half starved for months, they assemble
round a fire, and the oldest man present cuts for each

THE AZTECS.
The religion of the Mexicans breathed a savage spirit,
which degraded them, in a moral point of view, far below
the hordes of wandering Indians. Their deities, repre
sented by misshapen images of serpents and other
hideous animals, were the creation of the darkest passions
of the human breast—of terror, hatred, cruelty and re
venge. They delighted in blood, and thousands of
human sacrifices were annually offered at their shrines.

The places of worship, called Teocallis, were pyramids
composed of terraces placed one above another, like the
temple of Belus at Babylon. These were built of clay,

or of alternate layers of clay and unburnt bricks, but, in
some cases, faced with slabs of polished stone, on which

THE "GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. 381
of the deity. The largest known Teocalli contains four
stories or terraces, and has a breadth of 480 yards at
the base and a height of 55 yards. These structures
served as temples, tombs and observatories.
The Aztecs believed in one supreme, invisible creator
of all things, the ruler of the universe, named Taotl
a
belief, it is conjectured, not native to them, but derived
from their predecessors, the Taoltecs. Under this su
preme being stood thirteen chief and two hundred inferior
deities, each of whom had his sacred day and festival. At
their head was the patron god of the Aztecs, the frightful Huitzilopochtli, the Mexican Mars. His temples were
the most splendid and imposing. In every city of the empire his altars were drenched with the blood of human sacrifice. Cortez and his companions were permitted by Montezuma to enter his temple in the city of Mexico, and to behold the god himself. He had a broad face, wide
mouth and terrible eyes. He was covered with gold,
pearls and precious stones, and was girt about with
golden serpents. On his neck, a fitting ornament, were
the faces of men wrought in silver, and their hearts in
gold. Close by were braziers with incense, and on the
braziers three real hearts of men who had that day been
sacrificed. The smell of the place, we are told, was like
that of a slauo^hter-house.
To supply victims for the sacrifices, the emperors made
war on all the neighboring and subsidiary States, or in
case of revolt, in any city of their dominions, and levied a certain number of men, women and children by way of
indemnity. The victims were borne in triumphal proces
sions and to the sound of music, to the summit of the
great temples, where the priests, in sight of assembled
crowds, bound them to the sacrificial stone, and opening
the breast tore from it the bleeding heart which was

either laid before the image of the gods, or eaten by the
worshipers, after having been carefully cut up and mixed
with maize. In the years immediately preceding the
Spanish conquest, not less than 20,000 victims were an
nually immolated. These atrocities were sometimes, though incongruously,
blended with milder forms of worship, in which fruits,
flowers and perfumes were offered up amid joyous out
bursts of song and dance. According to their mythology,
Taod, who delighted in these purer sacrifices, had once
reigned in Anahuac (a name which at first probably ap
plied only to the country in the immediate vicinity of the
capital, though afterward it was applied to the whole
Aztec empire) in the golden age of the world but being
obliged, from some unexplained cause, to retire from
earth, he departed by way of the Mexican Gulf, promis
ing to return.
This wide-spread tradition accelerated the success of the
Spaniards, whose light skins and long dark hair and
beards were regarded as evidences of their affinity with
the long-looked-for divinity. The Mexican priesthood
formed a rich and powerful order of the State and were
so numerous that Cortez found as many as 5,000 attached to the temple of Mexico. The education of the young
of both sexes remained, till the age of puberty, in the hands
of the priests and priestesses, and the sacerdotal class
were thus able to exercise a widely-diffused influence,
which, under the later rulers, was almost equal to that of
the emperor himself The women shared in all the oc
cupations of the men, and were taught, like them, the
arts of reading, writing, ciphering, singing in chorus,
dancing, etc., and they were even initiated into the secrets
of astronomy and astrology. These facts indicate a civil
ization far above that of many other nations and tribes.

pontiff. He was regarded as the descendant and repre
sentative of the great deity, the sun, who was supposed
to inspire his counsels, and speak through his orders and
decrees. Hence even shght offenses were punished with
death, because they were regarded as insults offered to
the divinity. The race of the Incas was held sacred.
To support its pretensions, it was very desirable that it
should be kept pure and distinct from the people; but
human passions are often too strong for the dictates of
policy ; and though the marriages of the family were con
fined to their own race, the emperor, as well as the other
males of the blood royal, kept large harems stocked with
beauties drawn from all parts of the empire, and multi
plied a spurious progeny, in whom the blood of the
"children of the sun" was blended with that of the
"children of the earth." Among a simple-minded and
credulous people the claims of the Incas to a celestial
origin seem to have been implicitly believed. They were
blindly obeyed, and treated with a respect bordering on
adoration, by the nobles and the common people.
The Peruvians worshiped the sun, moon, the evening
star, the spirit of thunder and the rainbow, and had
erected temples in Cuzco to all these deities. That of
the sun, which was the most magnificent, had its walls
covered with plates of pure gold. The sacrifices con
sisted of the objects most prized by the people—of grain,
and of fruits, of a few animals, and of the productions of
their own industry. Sun-worship, as it is the most
rational of all forms of idolatry, is also generally the
most mild; and doubtless this results from the tendency
which it has to fix the thoughts on the marks of benefi
cence and wisdom which are displayed in the works
of nature. The Peruvian temples were accordingly
never polluted, like those of Mexico, with the blood of



THE "GREAT SPIRIT" OF AMERICA. 385
human victims; and the Incas even went farther, and
signalized their zeal against such horrid rites, by sup
pressing them in all the countries they conquered.
The temple of the Sun at Cuzco, called Coricancha or
'Place of Gold," was the most magnificent edifice in the

empire. On the western wall, and opposite the eastern
portal, was a splendid representation of the sun, the god
of the nation. It consisted of a human face in gold, with
innumerable golden rays emanating from it in every
direction ; and when the early beams of the morning sun
fell upon this brilliant golden disc, they were reflected
from it as from a mirror, and again reflected throughout
the whole temple by the numberless plates, cornices, bands and images of gold, until the temple seemed to
gflow with a sunshine more intense and glorious than that
of nature.

IDOLATRY IN OCEANICA.
I believe that the ignorance which has prevailed regarding the mythological systems of barbarous or semi-barbarous races has too generally led to their being considered far grander and more reason
able than they really were. —W. Von Humboldt.
OCEANICA is one of the five great divisions of
the globe. It embraces all the islands lying in
the Pacific Ocean between the south-eastern
shores of Asia and the western shores of America.
The people may be divided into two classes; the one
called the Papuans, the other the Malayo-Polynesians.
The first resemble the African Negroes, having a black
skin, and crisp (Papua means " crisp") and woolly hair,
broad noses, receding chins and foreheads and thick, protruding lips. These Oceanica Negroes live mainly in New Guinea. They are also found in the woods and mountain
fastnesses of some other islands. They seemed destined
to be utterly destroyed in the struggle with new-coming
races. The second, the Malayo-Polynesians, are the brown
or copper-colored race of Oceanica. They greatly re
semble the Arabs in character, customs and appearance.
They are half-civilized, while the Papuans are barbarous.
They overspread almost the whole of the southern
Pacific Islands. They readily responded to the religious
teachings and civilizing influences of Asia. In Java es
pecially they became almost a reproduction of the people
of India, in their religion, language and habits.

TRADITIONARY ORIGIN OF HUMAN PRIESTHOOD.
The gods first spake to man through the small land
birds; but their utterances were too indistinct to guide the actions of mankind. To meet this emergency, an
order of priests was set apart, the gods actually taking
up their abode, for the time being, in their sacred per
sons. Priests were significantly named "god-boxes"

rally conjoined with priesthood, but they were usually of
the rudest and simplest sort.
Whenever consulted, a present of the best food, ac
companied with a bowl of intoxicating " piper mythisti
cum," was indispensible. The priest, throwing himself
into a frenzy, delivered a response in language intelligible
only to the initiated. A favorite subject of inquiry was
"the sin why so-and-so was ill;" no one being supposed
to die a natural death unless decrepit with extreme old

age. If a priest cherished a spite against anybody, he
had only to declare it to be the will of the divinity that
the victim should be put to death, or be laid on the altar
for some offense asfainst the tjods. The best kinds of
food were sacred to the priests and chiefs and they were
never slow to make use of it. Although unsuited for the delivery of oracles, birds
were ever regarded as the special messengers of the
gods to warn individuals of impending danger, each tribe
havinof its own feathered o;uardians.
POLYNESIAN NOTION OF THE SUN AND MOON.
A curious myth obtained in the now' almost extinct
Tongan tribe relative to the origin of the sun and moon.
Vatea and Tonga-ita quarreled respecting the parentage
of the first born of Papa, each claiming the
child as his own. At last the child was cut
in two. Vatea, the husband of Papa, took
the upper part as his share, and forthwith
squeezed it into a ball and tossed it into
the heavens, where it became the sun.
Tonga-ita sullenly allowed his share, the lower half, to remain a day or two on the
ground. Seeing the brightness of Vatea's
half he resolved to Imitate his example by

•example could be followed by others.



IDOLATRY IN OCEANICA. 393
TRADITION OF MANI S SECURING THE FIRE-GOD S SECRET.
One of the most peculiar traditions of Oceanica is this: To Ru and Buataranga was born a famous son, Mani. At an early age, Mani was appointed one of the guar
dians of this upper world where mortals live. Like the
rest of the inhabitants of the world, he subsisted on un
cooked food. The mother, Buataranga, occasionally
visited her son, but always ate her food apart, out of a
basket brought with her from nether-land. One day,
when she was asleep, Mani peeped into her basket, and
discovered cooked food. Upon
tasting it, he was decidedly of
opinion that it was a great improvement upon the raw diet to which he was accustomed.
This food came from nether
world ; it was evident that the
secret of fire was there. To
nether-world, the home of his parents, he would descend to
gain this knowledge, so that
ever after he might enjoy the
luxury of cooked food.
On the following day Buataranga was about to descend to
Avaiki (nether- world), when
Mani followed her through the
bush without her knowing it.
This was no difficult task, as she always came and re
turned by the same road. Peering through the tall reeds,
he saw his mother standing within easy hearing distance
of him and directly opposite a black rock, which she ad
dressed as follows
:

og,^ £JiJ?OJ^'S CHAINS.
" Buataranga, descend thou boldly through this chasm. The rainbow-like must be obeyed ; As two dark clouds parting at dawn, Open, open up my road to nether-world, ye fierce ones."
At these words, the rock divided, and Buataranga de
scended. Mani carefully treasured up these magic words,
and without delay started off to see the god Tane, the owner of some wonderful pigeons. He earnestly begged
Tane to lend him one; but the proffered pigeon not
pleasing Mani, was at once returned to its owner. A
better pigeon was offered to the fastidious borrower, but
was rejected. Nothing would content Mani but the pos
session of Akaotu, or Fearless, a red pigeon, specially
prized by Tane. It was so tame that it knew its name
;
and, wander wherever it might, it was sure to return to
its master. Tane, who was loth to part with his pet, extracted a promise from Mani that
the pigeon should be restored to
him uninjured. Mani now set
off in high spirits, carrying with
him his red pigeon, to the place where his mother had descended. Upon pronouncing the magic words which he had overheard,
to his great delight, the rock
t __; opened, and Mani, entering the
'^(f^ "^ I 1 pigeon, descended. Some assert
that Mani transformed himself

perched upon the back of the
pigeon, made his descent. The two fierce guardian de
mons of the chasm, enraged at finding themselves im
posed upon by a stranger, made a grab at the pigeon,
intending to devour it. Fortunately, however, for the



IDOLATRY IN OCEANICA. 395
borrower, they only succeeded in getting possession of
the tail, whilst the pigeon, minus its beautiful tail, pursued
its flight to the shades. Mani was grieved at the mishap
which had overtaken the pet bird of his friend Tane.
Arrived at nether-land, Mani sought for the home of
his mother. It was the first house he saw; he was guided
to it by the sound of her clothflail. The red pigeon
alighted on an ovenhouse opposite to the shed where Buataranga was beating out cloth. She stopped her
work to gaze at the red pigeon, which she guessed to be
a visitor from the upper world, as none of the pigeons
in the shades were red. Buataranga said to the bird. "Are you not come from daylight ?" The pigeon nodded
assent. "Are you not my son, Mani?" inquired the old woman. Again the pigeon nodded. At this Buataranga
entered her dwellino- and the bird flew to a bread-fruit tree. Mani resumed his proper human form, and went
to embrace his mother, who inquired how he had de
scended to nether-world, and the object of his visit. Mani avowed that he had come to
learn the secret of fire. Buataranga said,
"This secret rests with the fire-god, Manike.
When I wish to cook an oven, I ask your father Ru to beg a lighted stick from Manike."
Mani inquired where the fire-god lived. Hi
mother pointed out the direction, and said it was
called Are-aoa

kouse-qf-banyan-s/icks. She
entreated Mani to be careful, "for the fire-god
is a terrible fellow, of a very irritable temper." Mani now walked up boldly toward the
house of the fire-god, guided by the curling
column of smoke. Manike, who happened at the moment to be cooking an oven of food, stopped his work and demanded what the stranger wanted. Mani replied, "A

fire-brand." The fire-brand was given. Mani carried
it to a stream running past the bread-fruit tree and
there extinguished it. He now returned to Manilce
and obtained a second fire-brand, wliich he also exdn
guished in the stream. A third time a hghted stick was
demanded of the fire-eod. He was beside himself with
&^ raee. Raking the ashes of his oven, he s^ave the daring^ Mani some of them on a piece of dry wood. These
Hve coals were thrown into the stream as the former
lighted sticks had been.
Mani correctly thought 'that a fire-brand would be of
little use, unless he could obtain the secret of fire. The
brand would eventually go out; but how to reproduce the
fire? His object, therefore, was to pick a quarrel with the
fire-god, and compel him, by sheer violence, to yield up
the invaluable secret, as yet known to none but himself
On the other hand, the fire-god, confident in his own pro
digious strength, resolved to destroy this insolent in
truder into his secret. Mani, for the fourth time, demanded fire of the enraged god. Manike ordered him
away, under pain of being tossed into the air; for Mani
was small of stature. But the visitor said he should
enjoy nothing better than a trial of strength with the
fire-god. Manike entered his dwelling to put on his war
girdle (ume-i-tono maro); but on returning, found that
Mani had swelled himself to an enormous size. Nothing
daunted at this, Manike boldly seized him with both hands
and hurled him to the height of a cocoanut tree. Mani
contrived, in falling, to make himself so light that he was
in no degree hurt by his adventure. Manike, maddened
that his adversary should yet breathe, exerted his full
strength, and next time hurled him far higher than the
highest cocoanut tree that ever grew. Yet Mani was un
hurt by his fall, whilst the fire-god lay panting for breath.



IDOLATRY IN OCEANICA. 397
It was now Mani's turn. Seizing the fire-god, he
threw him up to a dizzy height, and caught him again Uke
a ball with his hands. Without allowing Manike to touch
the ground, he threw him a second time into the air, and
caught him in his hands. Assured that this was but a
preparation for a final toss, which should seal his fate, the
panting and thoroughly exhausted Manike entreated
Mani to stop and spare his life. Whatever Mani desired Manike promised should be his.
The fire-god, now in a misera
ble plight, was allowed to breathe
awhile. Ma.ni said: "Only on
one condition will I spare you

tell me the secret of fire. Where
is it hidden ? How is it pro
duced?" Manike gladly prom
ised to tell him all he knew, and
led him inside his wonderful
dwellinsf. In one corner there was
a quantity of fine cocoanut-fibre ;
in another, bundles of fire -yield
ing sticks—the "«z^," the "oron
ga," the " tauinn" and particu
larly the " aoa," or banyan tree. These sticks were all dry and ready for use. In the
middle of the room were two smaller sticks by themselves.
One of these the fire-god gave to Mani, desiring him to
hold it firmly, while he himself plied the other most vigor
ously, uttering as he did it the following song:
NEW ZEALAND MOON-GOD.
THE FIRE-GODS SONG.
Grant, oh, grant me thy hidden fire, Thou banyan tree ! Perform an incantation
;



iqS erkor's chains.
Utter a prayer to (the spirit of) The banyan tree !
Kindle a fire for Manike Of the dust of the banyan tree !
By the time this song was completed Mani, to his
great joy, perceived a faint smoke arising out of the fine
dust produced by the friction of one stick upon another.
As they persevered in their work the smoke increased,
and, favored with the fire-god's breath, a shght flame
arose, when the fine cocoanut fibre was called into requi
sition, to catch and increase the flame. Manike now
called to his aid the different bundles of sticks, and
speedily got up a blazing fire, to the astonishment and
great delight of Mani.
The grand secret of fire was thus secured. But the
victor resolved to be revenged for his trouble and his
tossing in the air, by setting fire to his fallen adversary's
abode. In a short time all nether-world was in flames,
which consumed the fire-god and all he possessed. Even
the rocks cracked and split with the heat; hence the an
cient saying in that land, " The rocks ot Orovaru (in the
shades) are burning."
Ere leaving the land of ghosts, Mani carefully picked
up the two fire-sticks, once the property of Manike, and
hastened to the bread-fruit tree, where the red pigeon,
"Fearless," quiedy awaited his return. His first care
was to restore the tail of the bird, so as to avoid the
anger of Tane. There was no time to be lost, for the
flames were rapidly spreading. He re-entered the
pigeon, which carried his fire sticks one in each claw, and
flew to the lower entrance of the chasm. Once more
pronouncing the words he learnt from Buataranga, the
rocks parted, and he safely got back to this upper world.

trembled for their land ; for it
seemed as if everything would e destroyed by the de

succeeded in putting out the fire. Rangi thenceforth adopted the new name of Matamea, or Watery-eyes, to commemorate his sufferings ; and Mokoiro was ever
after called Anai, or Smoke.
The inhabitants of Mangaia availed themselves of the
conflagration to get fire and to cook food. But after a
little time their fire went out, and as they were not in
possession of the secret, they could not get new fire. But
Mani was never without fire in his dwelling; a circum

the wonderful secret—that fire lies hidden in the hibiscus,
the urtica argentra, the "tauniu," and the "banyan." This
hidden fire might be elicited by the use of fire-sticks,
which he produced. Finally, he desired them to chant
the fire-god's song, to give efficacy to the use of the
sticks, and from that memorable day all the dwellers in
this upper world used fire-sticks with success, and enjoyed
the luxuries of light and cooked food. By such wonderful
deeds Mani succeeded in introducing himself among the gods. He is to-day much reverenced throughout the
Pacific Isles.



THE KARENS AND THEIR TRADITIONS. ^qI!
CHAPTER XIX*
THE KARENS AND THEIR TRADITIONS.
The Karens are a meek, peaceful race, simple and credulous, with many of the softer virtues and few flagrant vices. Though greatly addicted to drunkenness, extremely filthy and indolent in their habits,
their morals, in other respects, are superior to many more civilized races. Their traditions, like those of several tribes of American Indians, are a curious medley of myth and absurdity; but they have some tolerably definite ideas of a Great Being, who governs the universe > and many of their traditionary precepts bears a striking resemblance to those of the Gospel.

Mrs. Emily C. Judson.
A
LTHOUGH the Karens, as we now know them, are divided into two main clans and numerous
smaller divisions, having different tribal customs
and speaking different dialects, yet their religious cus
toms are marked by the same distinctive features in all
the tribes.
The Karens are not now, and never have been, so far
as can be ascertained, idol worshipers. They look with
cool contempt upon the religious forms of the idolaters by whom they are surrounded. The few Karens who
have so far forgotten their ancient customs as to give a
formal adherence to Buddhist ceremonies, are looked
upon as renegades by their fellow-countrymen.
This feature marks them as entirely foreign in origin
to the country in which tViey are now found. This is
confirmed by their own traditions, which declare that they

came from the north-west, following the mountain ranges
until they found themselves in Burmah, where their home
now is.
These same traditions also declare unmistakably that
they once worshiped the true God, whom they call in their own language Yuah or K'tsah Yuah, the latter term meanine " the Lord Yuah." Karens, however, will seldom
repeat this name ; the heathen declining positively, and
many of the less informed Christians showing a strange
reluctance to repeating it. The reason they give is that the word Yuah, in common speech, means to flow down
of away, and the Karens say that to use this name care
lessly will cause the favor of God to flow away from them.
Although the Karens, however, show this strange reverence for the name of God, a reverence which reminds us
of the similar feeling among the Jews for the sacred
name Jah or Yah which the Karen so closely resembles,
yet they do not worship this Lord Yuah, as a rule. In
deed in most cases the only sign of worship given to
him is the exclamation, " Ba Pa K'tsah !" used when one
is startled or suddenly alarmed. This phrase means literally "worship Father God," or, colloquially, "we wor
ship God." Further than this a Karen scarcely ever offers any form of worship to this Being whom they ac
knowledge to be in very truth the one living supreme God.
The reason for this failure to worship Yuah is ac
counted for by the following strange tradition, which we
give as it is commonly repeated around the camp-fires,
or in the huts of the Karens, as they while away the
cool, quiet nights which succeed the burning days of Burmah:
"We once, oh! children and grandchildren, had the



THE KARENS AND THEIR TRADITIONS. ^q->
Law of Yuah, and worshiped him as the only Hving and
true God. I'his law was a written book, and was made
•of skin, the skin of an animal. Yuah gave us his law
because we were his favored children. Yuah had seven
sons, and his oldest son, the first-born of his creation,
was our ancestor, the first of our nation and the first •of men.
"Yuah told us to be very careful of his law, and for a time our ancestors read his book and kept his command
ments, for they feared that if they did not, Pa K'tsah
(Father God, for that is the real name of Yuah) would .flow (Yuah) away from them. "By and by, however, our ancestors became careless. They had many gardens to make, and they grew forget
ful of the book of the law, and one day they left it upon
a low tree, and the fowls flew up to roost in the evening, and threw the book down to the ground ; and then a dog came and carried it away, and gnawed it. Pa K'tsah was so displeased that he took away his law from us and gave it to our younger brother, the white man. Then
Yuah left us. He said: 'Oh, my children, you are now
in the power of the evil spirits, who hate men. You can
only appease their anger by sacrifices. I am going far away; but do not despair. One day your younger
"brother, the white man, will come to you in ships from
the west, and will bring you back again the long-lost
law of Yuah. Then you will be happy, for the evil ones
will leave you^ and I will return. Till then you must
wait and watch. You shall be afflicted with sickness
when the evil ones eat your spirits. You shall be slaves
to your brethren ; but one day all will be right, when
your younger brother, the white stranger, brings you
again my law." Then, say the Karens, began our troubles and sorrows.

Since then the Karens have regarded themselves as liv
ing in a world of evil spirits, and their religiou-s ceremo
nies are simply propitiatory sacrifices and prayers to
these evil beings, intended to conciliate and flatter them.
When sick

evil beings. The
Karens say that
a man has sev

leave us and wander about
the earth ; what
they see in their
wanderings, we
will see in our dreams. Now,
the evil spirits, according to the belief of the Karens,
are on the watch to catch the spirits of men and devour
them. If one is caught, the man falls sick ; if another,
he grows worse ; if all, he dies. The evil spirits may be
appeased by a sacrificial feast, and may release the cap
tive soul. So a feast is proclaimed, and all the family of
the sick man—sometimes all his immediate relations

gather together and partake of it with great ceremony,
offering portions of the food to the spirits, by exposing
them outside the house or village, where they are quickly

cessory prayer to the evil spirits to release the captive
•soul from their toils.
The streams, the forest, even particular trees, are sup
posed to be the haunts of these evil ones. So a Karen,
when fishing, mutters a prayer to the tutelary spirit, or if
'he fells a tree, first mutters a prayer or makes a propiti
.atory offering-.
In sowing and reaping the grain, or planting fruit-trees,
,and gathering fruit, similar ceremonies are observed.
After death solemn funeral services are held. The :soul is supposed to be immortal and to exist in Hades.
From this Hades we are separated by a stream, impass
^able, save as the soul is carried over upon the wings of a
bird, to which they give various names. The soul is
supposed to linger near the grave or place of sepulture until a solemn commemorative service is held, a month,
tor more commonly, a year, after the decease of the body.
At this time a feast is proclaimed. All the villagers and
relatives are gathered together. A bone of the deceased
is then taken from the grave, usually the back-bone, and shrined in a carved wooden shrine, which is surmounted
by the figure of the sacred bird. Dirges, exceedingly
poetic and beautiful, are sung to minor strains. A procession of young men and maidens moves round the shrine, bewailing the deceased and speaking of the hopes
'of his safe entrance into a beautiful land, or, as the
northern tribes call it, the "silver city." The feast lasts
for a number of days, usually seven, but if the family of
the deceased is rich, it is sometimes prolonged to a month. The bone is then buried with great ceremony,
and the soul is supposed to enter its state of rest ; yet
not a state of perfect happiness, for say the Karens, " No

with him happiness for this life and for that which ;s to come." Mrs. Vinton, a missionary to Burmah, wrote: "The
Karens in general Hsten with gfreat interest when we tell
them of God, and frequently exclaim, 'That is what our
forefathers told us! That is right! That is good!' I
have endeavored to discover how their forefathers came by a knowledge of God; but they always answer, 'Our
ancestors knew Him irom the beginning, but when they sinned against Him He hid Himself from them ; and dieir descendants after them knew not how to worship Him
;
and, as He did not protect them from evil spirits, they
were obliged to offer sacrifices to them to appease their
wrath.'
" They tell us of many attempts ' to return to the wor
ship of the God who made the earth, and the heavens,,
and all things.'
" These efforts have sometimes been continued for
months, and even years ; but the poor Karens have in
variably fallen a sacrifice to the brutal persecutions of the Burmans.
"One village of nearly a thousand inhabitants worshiped
God in this way for some time, unknown to the Bur
mans ; but when the latter learned the fact they sent an,
armed force to destroy the village. Some of the Karens
inquired of their leader if they should fight. 'No,' re
plied the chief 'it is inconsistent with the worship of our
God to fight. We will cast ourselves upon His protec
tion.' They then opened their gates, brought forth their
weapons of defense, and laid them at the feet of their
enemies. Thus defenseless, they were immediately slain
by their cruel oppressors, the Burmans."



THE FIRE-WORSHIPERS. .q
CHAPTER XX.
THE FIRE-WORSHIPERS.
A Parsee believes in one God, to whom he addresses his prayers. His morality is comprised in these words—pure thoughts, pure words,
pure deeds. —F. Max MOller.
MODERN Parsees decidedly object to being called
fire-worshipers, and declare the designation un
true. They are undoubtedly taught from their
youth up to turn their face to some light-giving object while engaged in worshiping God, and they certainly
regard the fire as an emblem of the power of God. Vet they declare that they never worship these, neither
they nor their fathers. The name has been given
them from most ancient times ; and they confess that if
there is not a national worship of the sun and fire, there
is yet an indescribable awe which every Parsee feels to
ward these objects. The Parsees are the only Eastern people who totally abstain from smoking tobacco. They
do not even like to blow out a candle. In many other
respects, this is a singular people, whose religious faith
we are about to describe. But, first, let us turn to its
history.
To-day only about one one-hundredth part of the whole human race are Parsees ; but there have been times when this system bade fair to become the preva
lent religion of the world. It is one of the oldest of re
formed religions. It grew up upon the idolatrous wor
ship of the ancient Assyrian empire. In the days of

out, and it will become one of the religions of the
past.
ZOROASTER, THE PROPHET OF ORMAZD.
This system is called generally by either one of three
names — Parseeism, Fire-worship or Zoroasteranism. It
is sometimes called the doctrine of the Mao-i. Its usual
name is derived from him who was the most celebrated
man in the history of this faith. Zoroaster is sometimes
-called the son of Ormazd. He probably lived about 1,200
years before Christ. The exact date cannot be ascer
tained. It is certain that it was in very early times, be
cause he and his religious reform are referred to in the
Vedas, whose great antiquity has been proven. His
writings stand at the head of the sacred Parsee books,
just as Moses' writings stand at the beginning of our
Bible. It took hundreds of years for the sacred Parsee books to grow, and they were completed in 400 B. C. Pliny compares Moses and Zoroaster as founders of
great religions. He certainly was one of the earliest
and greatest of religious reformers.
His teachings can be learned only from the older Parsee
books, the Gathas. His principal tenet was that there
is one God and not many gods. In his speculations he
taught that there were two forces opposed to each other,
a good being and an evil being ; his followers afterwards
declared these to be a good god and an evil god—Or
mazd and Ahriman. In his moral teachings he declared
that three things were to be kept pure; namely, thoughts, words and deeds.
Zoroaster's worship of one god.
In one of the Gathas (a division of the Zend-Avesta or
sacred Parsee books), Zoroaster is represented as stand

ing before the sacred fire, in a speech seeking to induce
his countrymen to forsake the worship of the devas oi'
gods, and to bow only to Ormazd. In his speecli he de
clares that from the worship ot one God flow all pros
perities, while from the worship of many gods comes
ruin to the race. The following is a translation of his
speech, made by Haug the famous Parsee scholar
:
"I. I will now tell you who are assembled here the wise
sayings of Mazda (/. <?., Ormazd) the hymns of the good
spirit, the sublime truth which I see arising out of these
sacred flames.
" 2. You shall, therefore, hearken to the soul of nature,
[i. e., to plow and cultivate the soil) ; contemplate the
beams of fire with a most pious mind ! Every one, both
men and women, ought to-day to choose his creed (between deva-worship and the Ormazd religion). Ye off
spring of renowned ancestors, awake to agree with us."
Again and again Zoroaster reverts to this theme. It does seem as if his ideas of Ormazd greatly resembled
those of Moses of Elohim or Jehovah. Though the ancient Zoroastrians believed in an evil spirit of almost
equal power with Ormazd, yet Zoroaster himself taught nothing of this. With all the ardor of Mohammed he waged war against the worship of many gods and idols, but with none of Mohammed's iconoclastic zeal. Zo
roaster pursued his course peacefully, seeking to win his countrymen by his words ; Mohammed sought to carry
his faith at the point of the sword. Both sought the
same end, to establish the worship of one God.
ORMAZD AND AHRIMAN.
Zoroaster taught that there were two spirits always at
war with one another. His followers changed his teach
ing into belief in a good God, Ormazd, and an evil god,



THE FIRE-WORSHIPERS. ^j ^
Ahriman. Ormazd brings blessings, Ahriman cursings.
Ormazd is the iatlier of truth, Ahriman is father of Hes.
Qrmazd favors the good, Ahriman causes the evil to tri
umph. With the two gods is associated the idea of two
lives, a good and a bad; of two future homes for man, a
Heaven and a Hell. Heaven is literally a "house of
hymns," and Hell a "house of destruction." The first is
the dwelling-place of Ormazd, the latter of Ahriman.
Between Heaven and Hell is the "bridge of the gatherer,"
over which the souls of the pious can pass, while those
of the wicked fall into Hell. Throughout the Zend
Avesta we find many teachings bearing a wondrous re
semblance to those of the Christian and Jewish Scriptures.
Beyond a question, these are not derived from one
another, but are founded on those convictions of truth
which are a part of our human nature.
FINDING OF THE ZEND-AVESTA,
It is only recently that Europeans have been able to
learn the contents of the Bible of the Fire-Worshipers,
the Zend-Avesta. In the middle of the last century a
Frenchman, Anquetil Diiperron, happened to see some
pages written in the Avesta characters. Hoping to earn
the honor of opening the sacred scriptures of the Par
sees to the western world, he determined to go and get
in Western India full copies of these writings and there to
learn the language. Being very poor, he joined one of
the French Indian Company's ships as a common sailor, for the French Government had refused to encourage his
enterprise. But when he arrived in India he found that
the government had determined differently and would aid
him. But the Parsee priests would neither give nor loan
him manuscripts nor teach him the language of the Zend
Avesta. Finally he managed to bribe a learned priest.



412 ERROR'S CHAINS.
His translation appeared in the year 1 771, after seventeen
years of toil and study. His work created an immense
sensation in Europe. For fifty years but little was done
in Europe in addition to Duperron's work. In 1830,
Eugene Burnouf, a most giited scholar, gave his attention
to the work. Others followed in his track, until now we
have complete and accurate translations of all the Parsee
sacred books in existence.
THE PARSEE BIBLE.
This consists of the writings and sayings of Zoroaster and the commentaries on these prepared by his disciples. Much of the Zend-Avesta is lost beyond recovery. When Alexander the Great conquered the Persian em
pire, he and his soldiers destroyed many of these books.
In the royal library at Persepolis was a complete copy
of the Zend-Avesta, which, by Alexander's orders, was
burned with the building containing them. The names
of these books, of which there were twenty-one, remain,
together with a description of them. In these books was
gathered the whole religious and scientific literature of
the ancient Persian empire. They treated not only of
religious topics, but of medicine, astronomy, agricul
ture, botany, philosophy, etc. The foundation underlying
all these books was given by Zoroaster. God re
vealed all this to him, as the Parsees have always be
lieved, and hence all these books are inspired. The prophet was supposed to have talked with God, asking Him questions and receiving answers. These answers
Zoroaster communicated to his disciples. Thus we read in the Zend-Avesta: " That I shall ask Thee, tell it me right, O Ormazd
!
Who was in the beginning the father and creator of
righteousness ? Who created the path of the sun and



THE FJRE-WORSniPERS. . j ,
Stars? Who caused the moon to increase and wane but Thou ? This I wish to know, O Mazda! besides what 1
know already. "That I shall ask Thee, tell it me right, O Ormazd!
Who is holding the earth and the skies above it? Who
made the waters and the trees of the field? Who is
in the winds and storms that they so quickly run?
Who is the creator of the good-minded beings, O Or
mazd? " That I shall ask Thee, tell it me right, O Ormazd
!
Who created the lights of good effect and the darkness?
Who created the sleep of good effect and the activity ?
Who created morning, noon and night, reminding the
priest always of his duties?
"That I shall ask Thee, tell it me right, O Ormazd!
What guardian angel may tell me good things to per
form five times a day, the duties which are enjoined by
Thyself, O Mazda ? and to recite those prayers which are
communicated for the welfare of all beings by the good
mind? Whatever good, intended for the increase oi
life, is to be had, may it come to me !"
The Dashers or high-priests are the only ones who are now expected to be able to understand the meaning of the
Zend-Avesta; they are expected to thoroughly study it.
All that remains of the Parsee Bible to-day are the following books: the Yasna, Visparad, Vendidad and twenty
four Yashts. The Yasnas are hymns used for sacrifice.
They are solemnly recited before the fire. The priest
takes some consecrated water, bread, butter, fresh milk, meat, the branches of the Homa plant with a pomegran
ate branch, the hair of an ox and a bundle of twies.
These are all placed on a marble table opposite to the
fire on the hearth of the temple. Then the priest re
peats the Yasnas, sometimes half-chanting, half-reciting

them. Thus, " Blessed is he, blessed is every one, to
whom Ormazd, ruling by his own will, shall grant the two
everlasting powers, health and immortality. For this
very good, I beseech Thee. Mayest Thou through Thine
angel of piety, Armaiti, give me happiness, the good true
things, and the possession of the good mind.
" I believe Thee to be the best Being of all, the source
of light for all the world. Every one shall choose Thee
as the source of light, Thee, O Mazda, most beneficent
spirit ! Thou createdst all good true things by means of the power of Thy good mind at any time, and promised
us, who believe in Thee, a long life. " Standing at Thy fire, amongst Thy worshipers who
pray to Thee, I will be mindful of righteousness as long
as I shall be able."
The Visparad is a collection of prayers in twenty-three
chapters. They are used much in the same way as the Yasnas. They resemble many of the Vedic prayers of
the Hindu religion. The Yashts contain directions for
the sacrifices and hymns of prayer and praise. The
Vendidad is the code of the religious, civil and criminal
laws of the Parsees. It consists of twenty-two chapters.
PARSEE WORSHIP.
The Parsee religion enters into the home-life of all its
adherents. The holy fire is kept always burning in the
high-priest's house, and the people go there to re-light
their household altar-fires. A Parsee merchant, Mr.
Dadabhai Naoroji, has described the daily life of the fire
worshiper. Some of their practices are decidedly dis
gusting. A pious Parsee must say his prayers at least
sixteen times every day—on getting out of bed, in wash
ing with nirang (a vile fluid, supposed to be sacred), in
taking his bath, cleansing his teeth. Every time that he



TIJE FJRE- WORSHIPEKS. .
•washes his hands he repeats his prayers, and every meal
begins and ends with prayers. The priests of to-day do
not even understand the old Zend lanouag-e, in which
these prayers are said. Mr. Naoroji says: "All prayers,
•on every occasion, are said, or rather recited, in the old
original Zend language ; neither the reciter nor the
people around intend to be edified, no one understanding
a word of it. There is no pulpit among the Parsees. On
some special occasions there are assemblages in the tem
ples, and prayers are repeated. Ordinarily, every one
goes. to the fire-temple whenever he likes, or, if it is con
venient to him, recites his prayers himself, and as long as
he likes, and gives, if so inclined, something to the priests
to pray for him."
The Parsees have only one wife. They never eat food cooked by a person of another religion than their own ;
they object to eating beef, pork or ham. The priesthood
is a family office ; none but the son of a priest can be
come a priest, Fire is used in connection with all their
worship as the symbol and (so some say) the representative of God. Often one may see in Bombay, India, as
the sun lowers in the west, a group of Parsees with heads
reverently bowed, and hands clasped, repeating their
prayers. Light and fire of any sort are regarded with
great reverence, and the Parsee always turns his face to a
light-giving object when praying. The greatest respect
is shown to the source of light and heat, the sun, and to
the sacred fire in the temple or the high-priest's house.

THE CHINESE PHILOSOPHER LAO-TSZE.
The teachings of Lao-Tsze are not unlike those of Zeno; both recommend retirement and contemplation as the most effectual means of purifying the spiritual part of our nature, annihilating the material passions and finally returning to the bosom of the supreme Reason. Hon. S. Wells Williams, LL. D.
WE now proceed to notice two of the three re
ligions of China, Taoism and Confucianism,
leaving Buddhism until the chapter on Bud
dhism. One-third of all the people of the world are gath
ered in China. Considered in every way it is a gigantic
empire. Its territory stretches over about one-third of
the continent of Asia and, next to Russia, is the largest connected empire on the earth. Within its borders,
occur some of the highest mountains and largest rivers in
the world. The pass over the Mei-ling in the north of
Kwang-tung province, is 8,000 feet above the sea. The Yellow River is over 2,000 miles long and the Yangtse
Kiang is nearly 4,000. China's various climates allow al
most every kind of vegetable and plant to be cultivated.
Minerals and metals of all sorts abound, so that no
country in the world contains greater wealth. The Great Chinese Wall extends from twenty-two degrees of lon
gitude a little north of Peking, and is from fifteen to
thirty feet high, fifteen feet broad and over 1,500 miles
long. This was built more than 2,000 years ago. The
history of China goes back to 2,000 years before Christ;

it has had from those early days a sort of civilization. Two
thousand years ago it had canals and other works of inland navigation. The Chinese have from very early times worn silk. The art of engraving on wooden blocks for printing with movable types was known 500 years before the days of Gu

libraries of thousands of volumes from ancient times..
Every village has its school. The conceit of the Chinese
of their position has been fostered very greatly by their
isolation and ignorance of other nations. Their ruler is
called the Son of Heaven and his dynasty the heavenly
dynasty, whence foreigners sometimes wrongly call the people Celestials. China is called the Middle Kingdom
and the Flowery Land. They call foreigners I-Jin or
barbarians, also Fank-wei or foreign devils.
CHINESE CONTRARIETIES AND LANGUAGE.
They do many things almost in a way directly the con
trary of that in which we do it. Their customs and ideas
are diametrically opposite to ours. "We read horizon
tally, they perpendicularly; and the columns run from
right to left. We uncover the head as a mark of re
spect, they put on their caps. We black our boots, they
whiten them. We give the place of honor on the right,
they on the left. We say the needle points to the north,
they to the south. We shake the hand of a friend in
salutation, they shake their own. We locate the under

foot-notes at the bottom of a page, they at the top. In
our libraries we set our books up, they lay theirs clown.
We now turn thousands of spindles and ply hundreds of
shuttles without a single hand to propel, they employ a
hand for each."
But the most singular thing of all, perhaps, is the lan
guage. The fundamental conception of the language is
ideographic. It is entirely monosyllabic, and has only
characters, no alphabet or letters. In one respect it is
as colossal as the nation in the number of its characters.
Every character is the name of a thing. An immense number of seemingly arbitrary signs is therefore to be
mastered. The labor is alleviated, however, by the fact
that there are certain root forms, variously estimated at
from 315 to 4,000. Out of the characters 214 have been
selected as keys or radicals, one or other ot which is
found in every character
. of the language. The number of words con
tained in the official dic
tionary is 43,500, and
other authorities reckon
as many more. But the
missionary Doolittle, af
firms that a knowledge
of 3,000 or 4,000 charac
ters is sufficient for the
reading of most books. The most complicated characters
in the language contain fifty-two strokes, but such are very
rare. The language is still further complicated in its
pronunciation by a system of tones, which vary according
to the meaning of the word. The language, like the
people, is of the earth earthy, for among its thousands of

words rankly luxuriant there, there was found to be no
expression suitable to express one of the graces of the
spirit, and it was for half a centurya matter of grave discussion what should be the proper rendering of the word God.
THE THREE CHINESE RELIGIONS.
A Chinaman may at the same time be an adherent of
all three of the national religions. The mass of the Chi
nese people accept the three, and see no inconsistency in so doing. It is somewhat as if we Americans were at
the same time Protestant, Romanist and skeptic. The
Chinese support the priests of all religions, worship in
all their temples, and believe in the gods of each and
all. These three reliofions differ from each other, how
ever. Dr. Edkins has so well defined this difference that
we give his words :
" Confucianism speaks to the moral nature. It disv.
courses on virtue and vice, and the duty of compliance
with law and the dictates of conscience. Its worship
rests on this basis. The religious veneration paid to an
cestors—for that is the worship of this system—is founded
on the duty of filial piety. The moral sense of the Chi
nese is offended if they are called on to resign this custom.
" Taoism is materialistic. Its notion of the soul is of
something physical, a purer form of matter. The soul it
supposes to gain immortality by a physical discipline, a
sort of chemical process, which transmutes it into a more
ethereal essence, and prepares it for being transferred to
the regions of immortality. The gods of Taoism are
also very much what might be expected in a system
which has such notions as these of the soul. It looks
upon the stars as divine. It deifies hermits and physi
cians, magicians and seekers after the philosopher's stone
and the plant of immortality.



420 EJiHOJi'S CHAINS.
" Buddhism is different from both. It is metaphysicaL.
It appeals to the imagination, and deals in subtle argu
ment. It says that the world of the senses is altogether
unreal, and upholds this proposition by the most elabor-
ate proofs. Its gods are personified ideas. It denies
matter entirely, and concerns itsell only with ideas. Most
of the personages adored by the Buddhists are known to
be nothing but fictitious impersonations of some of these
ideas. The Buddhist worship is not reverence paid to
beings believed to be actually existing ; it is a homage
rendered to ideas, and it is only supposed to be reflex in
its effects. Their worship is useful as a discipline, but
not effectual as prayer. The Buddhist, if he can obtain
abstraction of mind from the world in any other mode, need not pray or worship at all.
"These three systems, occupying the three corners of
a triangle—the moral, the metaphysical and the material

are supplemental to each other, and are able to co-exist
without being mutually destructive. They rest each on
a basis of its own, and address themselves each to different parts of man's nature. It was because Confucianism
' knew God, but did not honor Him as God,' that the way
was left open' for a polytheism like that of the Buddhists.
In the old books of China, God is spoken of as the Su
preme Ruler. He is represented as exercising over
mankind an infinitely just and beneficent providence.
But the duty of prayer is not enjoined. No worship of
God by the people is permitted. It was only by the
emperor acting vicariously for the people that the Deity was adored in that country. The system of Confucius,
wanting this, was more a morality than a religion.
"Buddhism came to fill this vacancy. Individual faith in God, with a rational mode of worship to accompany it,
could not be a result of the religious teaching which



THE CHINESE PHILOSOPHER, LAO-TSZE. 421
preceded it in China, nor were they inculcated by it. In Buddhism, the Chinese found objects to adore of myste
rious grandeur, and richly endowed with the attributes of wisdom and benevolence. The appeal thus made to their religious faith was strengthened by a pompous form
of worship. Processions and the ringing of bells, fumes
of sweet-smelling incense, prayers, chanting and musical
instruments were their aids to devotion. No wonder
that these additions should prove welcome to the reli
gious susceptibilities of a nation which had hitherto been
restricted within the bounds of a system almost exclusively moral, and which discouraged the worship of God
by the mass of the peopl-e. " How Taoism meets certain other wants which the
-other two systems fail to gratify, we will now show by an
illustration : It was a cold morning in January, when a
missionary walked, on one occasion, to a temple near the
west gate of Shanghai. There is a medical divinity much
bonored, who resides in this temple, to heal, as his wor
shipers think, the ailments of those who pray to him.
The Taoist priest in charge addressed the foreign visitor with a somewhat unexpected exhortation : ' You come
to our country giving us good advice ; now let me address
a little to you. Your religion does not meet the require
ments of the people. When they worship, they wish to
know whether they can grow rich, and recover from dis
ease ; but in the case of believing in Jesus, there are no
benefits of this kind to be looked for.' He pointed to the
little image, representing some physician of a former
dynasty, sitting in its shrine in a dim light, just visible
through the opening of the curtains. 'See,' said he,
* here is the god, ready to tell the believing devotee what
medicine he needs, and to guarantee its healing effect.
Look at the inscriptions fixed on the roof above and on

each side of the shrine. They describe his marvel-work
ing power.' He was asked who placed those tablets
there. ' They are,' he replied, ' the offerings of persons
cured by this divinity.' In the Central Kingdom, the set
ting of the tablets in the temples by individuals is cus
tomary, and they are intended to commemorate benefits
received from the divinities to whom they are dedicated.
A visitor from a village in the country, at a distance of
some miles, now appeared, and went through the usual
ceremonies. He was asked, 'Why do you not consult a
physician ? This idol is dead wood. It cannot see or hear. Why apply to it ?' The devotee answered with
great simplicity, ' I do not know what my disease is ; how,
then, can I apply to a physician? It is on this account
that I ask the god. He will heal me. I have come a
long way on purpose. His fame is very widely spread.'
He was again asked, ' Will you not go to the foreign free
hospital ?' He answered, ' It is not the right time of day,
and, besides, I like to come here ; and why should I not?' He was asked again, ' Do you know that this burning of
incense and seeking for oracular information at an idol's
shrine is displeasing to God ? It is as unwise, therefore,
as it is unreasonable, to apply to this god to tell you
what medicine you should use.' At this point, the Tao
ist priest came to the defense of his system. ' You
believe in Jesus. We believe in our gods. Religions
diflfer according to place, and every country has its own
divinities. We have Kwan-kung, for example, the god of
war, and other divinities, holding the same place among
us that Jesus does among you.' He was asked, ' How can these supposed gods benefit you ? They are but the
imaginary representatives of men belonging to your
nation, who long ago died.' The Taoist asked in re
ply, ' Is it not the same with Jesus ? He also is long

since dead. What benefit do you expect from him ?' He was then told, ' We do not make an image of Him,
place it in a shrine, and cast lots before it, expecting to
learn, by so doing, how a disease is to be cured. The
parallel is not accurate. The benefit we expect from
Him is that He will help us in becoming virtuous, and in
attaining a happy future life. The object of our religious
books is to free us from sin, and Jesus, who still lives in
Heaven, is able to secure us this.' The reference to books
led him to remark, ' We have our books, too, to exhort men to virtue.' He took up a copy of a well-known
work, often distributed gratuitously in China. 'This,' he
said, ' is the Kan-ying-peen (Book of Retribution) ; all
that it contains is intended to make men better. It
promises long life to the good, and all kinds of calamities
to the wicked. Our object is the same as yours—to
make men good.' He was reminded that, according to
the doctrine of this book, happiness and misery were the
rewards of virtue and vice, and that this did not agree
with the system of divination on which his temple depended for its support, and was asked why he encour
aged those who frequented it to expect good from the
throwing of sticks on the floor, and the shaking of lots
together in a wooden cup, if good and ill fortune were
awarded to men by Heaven only according to character.
To this the priest of Tao replied, as he sat surrounded
by his boxes of medicines, arranged in pigeon-holes, with
his recipe-book on the table before him, from which he
selected the appropriate nostrum under the guidance of
the oracle, ' If the person who comes to worship is wicked
at heart, he will not be heard ; the oracle will fail.' ' But,'
it was remarked, ' if he be only virtuous, he need not
come here at all. The great thing is to be good.' " Suchi
are the tenets of Taoism.



^o^ ERROR'S CHAINS.
THE OLD BOY.
Confucius became the prophet of the practical. About
fifty years before Confucius, was born one who became a deep thinker who looked with scorn upon the work of
Confucius. This was Lao-tsze, who was born 604 B. C.
According to the legends of the Taoists he had the appear
ance, when born, of an old man with gray hair, and so
they called him Lao-tsze, which means the old boy.
When he was born, so they say, he was wise as men are
when they become old. Other legends say that as soon as
he was born, he mounted into the air and pointing with his
left hand to heaven, and with his right to the earth, he said:
"In heaven above and on earth beneath, Tao alone is worthy of honor." His complexion was white and yellow;
his ears were of extraordinary size, and were each pierced
with three passages. He had handsome eyebrows, large
eyes, ragged teeth, a double-ridged nose and a square
mouth ; on each foot he had ten toes. All of this was to distinguish him from common men. He became a her
mit-student. His chief disciple was named Yin-He.
The following story will serve to illustrate the miraculous
powers ascribed to Lao-tsze.
THE TALISMAN OF LONG LIFE.
The philosopher's servant, Senkea, who had served
him for 200 years without receiving any wages, finding
that his master was going to take a journey whither he knew not, suddenly demanded his arrears of pay, which
upon calculation were found to amount to 72,000 ounces
of silver. Fearing to face his master, he induced an ac
quaintance to ask Yin-He to broach the subject to Lao
tsze. The acquaintance being ignorant of the relation
existing between the master and servant, and already



THE CIIIXESE PHILOSOPHER, LAO-TSZE 425
•deeming in anticipation Senkea to be a rich man, promised
him his daughter in marriage. The beauty of the girl added
to the persistency of the serving-man, whom Lao-tsze
summoned to his presence. " I hired you originally," he
said, "to perform the most humble duties; your circumstances were poor and no one else would employ you. I
have given you the talisman of long life, and it is due to
this alone that you are now in existence. How have you
so far forgotten the benefits I have heaped upon you as
to cover me with reproaches? I am now about to set out
for the Western Sea (the Caspian) ; I intend to visit the kingdoms of Ya T'sin (the Roman Empire), of Ke-pin
(Cabul), of Tien-chuh (India), and of Gan-se (Parthia)
;
and I order you to act as my charioteer thitherwards. On
my return, I will pay you that which I owe you." But Senkea still refused to obey. Whereupon Laotsze ordered him to lean forward and open his mouth,
and instantly there escaped from his lips the talisman, and at the same moment his body became a heap of dry bones. At the earnest prayer of Yin-He the ser
vant was restored to life, and was dismissed with a
present of 20,000 ounces of silver. Having nothing fur
ther to detain him, Lao-tsze bade farewell to the keeper
of the pass, and mounting upon a cloud, disappeared into
space.
Some Taoist writers claim Lao-tsze as the author of
930 of the current works on the superstitious varieties
of modern Taoism, and add complacently that all other books are unworthy of the same regard, having been
secretly added by the followers of Tao in later ages.
THE VISIT OF CONFUCIUS TO LAO-TSZE.
Confucius once held an interview with Lao-tsze.
From this he returned to his disciples, and for three days 26



426 EJiROK'S CHAINS.
he did not utter a word. According to his own account,,
Lao-tsze exercised a complete fascination over him.
He felt, when conversing with the older philosopher, that
he was in the presence of a master mind, and the mer
ciless criticism of which his doctrines were the object,
,
shook his faith somewhat in their truth. "At his voice,"
said he, " my mouth gaped wide, my tongue protruded, and my soul was plunged in trouble."
To Yang-tsze, a disciple of Confucius, Lao-tsze spoke
in the same strain. " The spots of the tiger, and of the
leopard, and the agility of the monkey, are that which
exposes them to the arrows of the hunter." And in
reply to a question concerning the administration of the
illustrious kings of antiquity, he said, "Such was the ad
ministration of the illustrious kings, that their merits
overspread the empire unknown to themselves ; the in
fluence of their example extended to all beings ; they
effected the happiness of the people without letting them
feel their presence. Their virtue was so sublime that
human speech is unable to express it ; they lived in an impenetrable retreat, and were absorbed in Tao."
THE VOYAGE IN SEARCH OF THE TALISMAN OF LONG LIFE..
The talisman of long life was said to have been lost
after Lao-tsze's death. But Che Hwang-te determined
to find it. He was persuaded into believing that in the
ocean to the east of China there were " Golden Islands
of the Blest," where genii dwelt, whose business and de
light it was to dispense to all visitors to their shores a
draught of immortality, compounded of the fragrant herbs which grew in abundance round them ; that here
also was the talisman of long life kept. So sincere
was Che Hwang-te's faith that he fitted out a naval
expedition to discover these much-to-be-desired regions,



THE CHINESE PHILOSOPIJER, LAO-TSZE. •%2 7
and placed a Taoist magician at the head of the under
taking. On the plea that it had been revealed to him
that the expedition was likely to meet with a more favor
able reception at the Golden Isles if a company of youths and maidens accompanied it, Sen She, the leader, persuaded the Emperor to send several thousands of girls
and young men with him. On the return of the voy
agers they reported that they had sailed within sight of
the islands, but had been driven back by contrary winds. The Emperor determined to try again. This second ex
pedition failed. But private individuals declared that
they had succeeded in reaching the islands, in seeing the
genii, in securing the draughts of the elixir of life, and
that they had seen the Talisman. Che Hwang-te's failures would not let him see the imposture that was being played upon him. Again and again he sent, and great sums were expended, and finally an emptied treasury
forced him to relinquish his project.

CHAPTER XXII.
THE TAOIST SACREU BOOKS AND GODS.
The Tao-te-king still remains the monument of Lao tsze's extraordinary power and penetration ; and it gives ample reason for assigning him a place indefinitely higher than the mass of his contempora
ries.

Archdeacon Charles Hardwick.
LAO-TSZE gave to Yin-He, when he left China on
his last journey, the results of his long life of
meditation in a little book of 5,000 characters.
On this little book the immense volumes of the Taoist
religion are built up. This is called the Tao-Te-King, or
Book of the Way and of Virtue. This is a metaphysical
treatise, and its meaning is very obscure. There is much
of materialistic speculation, magic and divination in this
book. The first chapter tells us that " that which is
nameless is the beginnincf of Heaven and earth." " 7}wu
produced one, the first great cause ; one prodticed two,
the male and female principles of nature; from the two
came three, and the three produced all things that are in Heaven and earth."
All things endure for a set time, and then per'sh.
Together they came into being, and to each is allotted a
certain period of growth and maturity; but when the
highest point of vigor has been reached, it straightway
becomes old and returns home to its root. " This is
said to be a reversion to destiny." Emptiness is the only
thing which endures, and this is at the same time of the
highest use. The space between Heaven and earth, for



THIl TAUIST ^ACJiED books and GODS. 429
example, may be likened to a pair of bellows, which,
though it is empty, never collapses, and which, the more
it is exercised, the more it brings forth. So also with the
wheel of a carriage, or an earthen vessel, or the windows
and doors of a house. In each case it is the non-existing or empty part which is useful. The spokes and nave of
the wheel, the walls of the earthen vessel, and the frames
of the doors and windows are advantaofeous, but the use
of each depends on the part which is empty. " So, then,
existence may be said to correspond to gain, but non
existence to use." When a thing is to be weakened, it
must first be strengthened ; when it is about to be
brought low, it must first be raised up ; and that which is
to be taken away from it must first be given to it.
In the superiority of non-existence over existence lies
the lesson which, above all others, Lao-tsze desired to impress on man. The great concern of all men in all
ages has been to take care of the things of the body, and
to neg-lect the cultivation of the inner man : to seek after
the gratification of sense, and to forget the importance of
the soul. And what is the
result? The five colors,
which so delight the eyes,

A man's palate, which at first revels in the five tastes,
soon loses all sense of flavor. The pursuit of pleasure
or of ambition is equally deceptive. Riding and hunt
ing will drive a man mad, and things hard to procure
bring evil upon their possessors. " Therefore, the sage
makes provision for the inner man, and not for his eyes.

hand." He remembers that rest is the lord of motion,
and never allows himself to depart from a state of quie
tude and gravity.
TFIE BOOK OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.
The Taoists have long been in the habit of printing
by subscription, and circulating as a matter of religious
duty, the collection of maxims known as the Book of
Rewards and Punishments. Each maxim is followed by a gloss or commentary, and in almost every case eluci
dated by appropriate tales and anecdotes. The high re
pute in which this volume stands is further indicated by
the circumstance that the authorship has in modern times
been attributed to Lao-tsze himself, in his capacity of
deified and venerable Prince or incarnation of Tao. "Every wise man," writes a commentator, "ought to be
full of respect for this book: he ought to believe sin
cerely all the maxims it delivers, and ought to practice
them faithfully, regardless of all obstacles, and without
suffering the zeal he had evinced at the commencement
to diminish at the close of his career. He ought every
morning to read it aloud, and to meditate on every phrase
with serious attention. Let him redouble his efforts to
perform good works, and his anxiety and ardor to correct
past failings. Then will happiness spring up within him
self to recompense his merits; and his end will be ad
vancement to the rank of the immortals." While the
general tone of this production harmonizes with the older
treatise, it bears frequent witness also to the presence of
a more eclectic and accommodating spirit. So highly is
this book esteemed as a guide and instructor that its dis
tribution is considered to be a religious duty. Edition
after edition appears from the local presses at the demand
of the charitable subscribers, who give them to the poor.

SOME SELECTIONS FROM THE BOOK OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS.
"Advance along the right way, and retreat from the
evil way."
"Do not betray the secret of the household."
"Be humane to animals."
"Rectify yourself and convert men." "Have pity for orphans, and show compassion to widows."
"Rejoice at the success of others, and sympathize
with their reverses, even as though you were in their
place."
"Do not expose the faults of others."
"Bestow favors without expecting recompense."
"Give willingly."
"A man who does these things is called virtuous. All
men respect him. Providence protects him. Good for
tune and office attend him. The demons flee from him.
The god-like spirits guard him. He succeeds in all that
he lays his hand to, and to him is given the hope of
immortality."
"He who wishes to become an immortal of Heaven must do a thousand and three hundred good works. He who wishes to become an immortal of earth must do three hundred good works."
"He who inflicts an injury in broad daylight, will be
punished by men; but he who inflicts an injury in secret will be punished by demons." "Don't take advantage of the ignorance of men to
•deceive them with lying words."
" Never divulge the faults of your parents."
" Don't rank faults as crimes."
" Don't shoot at birds, nor hunt animals."

" Don't drive insects from their holes, nor frighten'

" Don't kill and cook domestic animals except in ac
cordance with the rites."
" Don't destroy or throw away the five kinds of grain."
" When you see others covered with glory and honor,,
don't desire to see them exiled from the country."
"A handsome figure excites the admiration of the
world, but it does not deceive Heaven."
" Don't laugh at the deformities of others."
" Don't bury the effigy of a man to inflict an incubus,
upon him."
[This refers to the practice of burying a wooden figure of a man to charm away his life, much in the same way that lately, in Shanghai and elsewhere, men were accused of making paper men which suffocated people in their
sleep.] " Don't deceive the innocent and set snares for them."
" Live in harmony with your wife."
"Wives, respect your husbands." "Wives, be not wanting in your duties toward your
father and mother-in-law."
"Don't treat with contempt the soulsof your ancestors."
" Wells and hearths are presided over by certain
spirits, and if you leap over them, not only do you insult
the gods, but you show that you have forgotten the two
thines which are the foundation of the life of men." "A good man is virtuous in his words, looks and ac

actions. If each day he practices these three vices, at the

leading maxims are oriven below.
" Redeem the lives of animals, and abstain from shed
ding blood. Be careful not to tread upon insects on the
road, and set not fire to the forests, lest you should de
stroy life. Burn a candle In your window to give light to
the traveler, and keep a boat to help voyagers across
rivers. Do not spread your net on the mountains to catch
birds, nor poison the fish and reptiles in the waters.
Never destroy paper which is written upon, and enter into
no league against your neighbor. Avoid contentions, and
beware not to stir up ill blood. Use not your power to
-discredit the good, nor your riches to persecute the poor.
Love the good, and flee from the face of a wicked man,
lest you fall into evil. Hide your neighbor's faults, and
speak only of their good deeds, and let your mouth utter
the true sentiments of your heart. Remove stones and
debris from the roadway, repair the footpaths and build
bridges. Publish abroad lessons for the improvement of
mankind, and devote your wealth to the good of your fel

Have all the sages of antiquity before your eyes, and ex

be withheld from him who practices secret benefits?"
THE GODS OF THE TAOISTS.
Lao-tsze had nothing to say of gods and goddesses.
When Buddhism came to China it taught Lao-tsze's dis
ciples to have gods. As the Buddhists had deified La
kya-muni, so the Taoists now deified Lao-tsze. As the
Buddhists worshiped under the form of the "Three Pre
cious Ones," so the Taoists worshiped Lao-tsze as SanTsing, or the " Three Pure Ones." They had an image

superstitious practices, the most of

of the religious acts of the Chinese,
especially those performed in tem

In order to ward off malignant influences, amulets are worn and charms hung up by persons of all

of office, wealth and long life, or to be accompanied by
poverty and misfortune, they betake themselves to a
Taoist priest, who, well versed in the tricks which ape
superhuman knowledge, returns oracular responses,
which satisfy, for the time being at least, the superstitious
wants of the applicants. Nor is their medical advice
based on any surer basis. Dr.
Gray, in his recent work on
China, gives the following de
scription of an incident he witnessed at a temple in Canton: "Whilst I was visiting one of
these temples, a father brought
his son to the priests
sayino- that the child was pos
sessed of a devil. Having con
sulted the idol, the priests in
formed him that there were no
fewer than five devils in the
body of his son, but that they were prepared to expel them all
on the payment of a certain
sum. The father agreed. The
child was then placed in front
of the altar, and on the ground
near his feet were placed five
eggs, into which the priests ad
jured the devils to go. As soon as they were sup
posed to have entered the eggs, the chief of the priests
covered them over with an earthenware vase, and at the same time sounded a loud blast upon a horn.
When the vase was removed, the eggs, by a trick of
legerdemain, were found no longer on the ground but in
the vase. The priest then proceeded to uncover his arm,.

and made an incision with a lancet on the fleshy part. The blood which flowed from the wound was allowed to
mingle with a small quantity of
water in a cup. The seal of
the temple, the impression of which was the name of the
idol, was then dipped into the blood and stamped upon the
wrists, neck, back and fore
head of the poor heathen child,
who was suffering from an at
tack of fever and ague."
The Chinese believe that
when disease does not yield to
medical treatment, the vitals of the sick and suffering one
are being preyed upon by an evil spirit; the physician is
cast acide, and the Taoist priests are called in, to exer
cise their exorcising powers. One can scarcely pass
along the streets of a Chinese city, at night, without find
ing these priests at work. Just as in Japan, one may hear, every night, the beating of the tom-tom as some
priest is drummmg the devil out of some poor wretch's
body.

CHAPTER XXIII.
CONFUCIUS AND THE CLASSICS.
Confucius ! Confucius ! How great was Confucius
!
Before him there was no Confucius ! Since him there has been no other. Confucius ! Confucius ! How great was Confucius !
ONE-THIRD of the human race would probably
join in honoring Confucius. The 340,000,000 of
Chinese would, without doubt, accept the senti
ment of the verse at the head of this chapter—taken
from a popular history of Confucius. No man in any
country has left so decided an impression on his country
men for so long a time as Confucius has left upon the
Chinese. He was, without question, a great man, and
was wise far beyond the men of his age. His sayings,
writings and deeds stand out above those of his country
men. He found the moral sense and religious observances of his countrymen very much debased during his
time, and set himself to reform them by reviving the an
cient observances and teaching the highest principles ot
pure morals and beneficent government.
THE BACKGROUND OF THE PICTURE.
Before looking at the story of Confucius's life let us
pause to look at the times in which he lived and his sur
roundings. He was born in the year 550 B. C. He was
"a transmitter and not a maker," as he said; so it is
important that we should see what there was for him to



44^: £A'JCOA"S CHAIAS.
transmit. We must look into the past history of the
Chinese people, into their traditions and habits, and,
above all, their early religion. In dim antiquity the Chi
nese people came into the valley
of the Yellow River, through
Central Asia, from the west,
which was, perhaps, the cradle of
the race. They journeyed across
the weary wastes of the Mongo
lian Desert until they came to
the fertile plains along the great Hwang Ho. The mountains were
clad with forests. By the regu
lar rains and fruitful soil the la
bors of the people were rewarded by abundant harvest, and they
gradually took possession of the
land. The aboriginal tribes grad
ually yielded to their superior
prowess, discipline and civilization. Colonies were
planted all over the land under the control of chieftains,
or, as Mencius calls them, " Pastors of Men." The his
tory of China, down to about 2356 B. C, is made of
legendary stories. With this period the " Book of His
tory," which Confucius edited, begins. Dr. R. K. Doug
lass, of the British Museum, thus describes the reign of
the two first emperors and the religion of their times:
Anciently there was an Emperor Yaou, all-informed,
intelligent, accomplished and thoughtful ; and if we are
to accept the received account of his reign, this descrip
tion does not do more than justice to his character. His
first care, we are told, was to advance the able and vir
tuous to offices in the State, and finally he united and
harmonized the myriad States of the Empire; and, lo

the black-haired people were transformed. He ap
pointed astronomers to calculate and delineate the movements and appearances of the sun, the moon, the stars
and the zodiacal spaces ; and he then determined the
four seasons and the length of the year. He adopted
intercalary months, and the calendar he arranged is that
which is still in use in China.
On the death of Yaou, Shun, who had shared his throne for some years, succeeded as sole emperor. Like his
predecessor, he was profound, wise, accomplished and
intelligent. He was mild, respectful and quite sin
cere. The report of his mysterious virtue was heard on
high, and he was appointed to take the throne. One of
his first public acts, after having still furdier perfected
the astronomical calculations of Yaou, was to sacrifice to
Shang-te, the Supreme Ruler or God. " Thereafter," we
are told, " he sacrificed specially, but with the ordinary
forms, to Shang-te; sacrificed with purity and reverence
to the six Honored Ones ; oftered appropriate sacrifice to
the hills and rivers; and extended his worship to the
hosts of spirits," This is the first miention wc have in
Chinese history of religious worship, though the expres
sions used plainly imply that the worship of Shang-te at
least, had previously existed. It is to tliis Supreme
Beino" that all the hiohest forms of adoration have been
offered in all ages. By His decree kings were made and rulers executed judgment. In His hands were the issues
of life and death, and he whom He blessed was blessed,
and he whom He cursed, was cursed. In all probability
there was a time when the worship of Shang-te was the
expression of the pure monotheistic faith of the Chinese.
By degrees, however, corruptions crept in, and though Shang-te always remained the supreme object of venera
tion, they saw no disloyalty to Him in rendering homage

to the powers of nature which they learnt to personify,
and to the spirits of their departed ancestors, who were
supposed to guard and watch over, in a subordinate man
ner, the welfare of their descendants.
MONUMENTAL GATE-WAY ERECTED IN HONOR OF CONFUCIUS.
During this reign the empire was divided into twelve
provinces, and ministers of agriculture, crime, works,
forests, religious worship and of music were appointed.
That the standard of morality was high, even at this early
period, appears from the conversations which are reported



CONFUCIUS AND THE CLASSICS. ^^g
between Shun's vice-regent Yu and one of his advisers.
In answer to the question put by Yu: "What are the
nine virtues?" the minister rephed: " Affabihty combined
with dignity ; mildness combined with firmness ; bluntness
combined with respectfulness ; aptness for government
combined with reverence ; docility combined with bold
ness ; straightforwardness combined with gentleness :
easiness combined with discrimination ; vigor combined
with sincerity; and valor combined with righteousness."
THE STORY OF THE SAGE's LIFE.
Heih, the father of Confucius, was a military otncer of great bravery and immense strength. He was married
to Yen Ching Tsai, Confucius's mother, when he was sev
enty years old. Confucius, the child of this aged couple,
was born, so the legends say, in a cave in Mount Ne, The legends tell how his birth was heralded by strange
signs and appearances, how fairies attended the birth of him of whose coming Yen Ching Tsai had been warned by genii. While he was yet a boy, he loved to play in ar
ranging the vessels of the temple-worship, and listened
earnestly to the stories of the reigns of Yaou and Shun.
When fifteen years old, he gave himself to more earnest
study, and when nineteen he was married. His married
life was unhappy, and after a year or so he was divorced
from his wife. Soon after this, being very poor, he ac
cepted the office of keeper of the stores of grain, and in
the next year he became the guardian of the public fields
and lands. When twenty-two years old, Confucius gave
up his offices and became the teacher of an earnest band
of students. He refused to teach dull or idle scholars. He
said : "I do not open the truth to one who is not eager
after knowledge, nor do I help any one who is not him
self anxious to explain. When I have presented one



«[-Q EHJ^OK'S CHAINS.
corner of a subject, and the listener cannot from it learn
the other three, I do not repeat my lesson." When
twenty-eight years of age, Confucius studied archery, and
in the next few years studied music under the celebrated
music-master, Siang. The master directed his pupil to learn the air composed by the sage Wan Wang of an
cient days. Confucius at once took the lute, and in obe
dience to Slang's instructions, commenced to play the
air. He continued it day by day.
" Five days went by, and still Confucius Played all day long the ancient simple air
;
And when Siang would teach him more he said : ' Not yet, my master, I would seize the thought. The subtle thought which hides within the tunc.'
To Avhich the master answered : ' It is well. Take five days more !' And wb.en the time was passed Unto Siang thus spoke Confucius:
' I do begin to see, and yet what I see Is very dim. I am as one who looks. And nothing sees except a luminous cloud ; Give me but five more days, and at the end, If I have not attained the great idea Hidden of old within the melody, I will leave music as beyond my power.' ' Do as thou wilt, O pupil !' cried Siang In deepest admiration ; ' never yet Had I a scholar who was like to thee. And on the fifteenth day Confucius rose And stood before Siang, and cried aloud : " The mist which shadowed me is blown away; I am as one who stands upon a cliff. And gazes far and wide upon the world. For I have mastered every secret thought,
Yea, every shadow of a feeling dim Which flitted through the spirit of Wan Wang When he composed that air. I speak to him, I hear him clearly answer me again ; And more than that, I see his very form
:



CONFUCIUS AND THE CLASSICS. 451
A man of middle stature, with a hue Half blended with the dark and with the fair; His features long, and large sweet eyes which beam
With great benevolence—a noble face I His voice is deep and lull, and all his air
Inspires a sense of virtue and of love. I know that I behold the very man, The sage of ancient days, Wan Wang the just.'
"Then good Siang lay down upon the dust. And said ; ' Thou art my master. Even thus The ancient legend, known to none but me. Describes our first great sire. And thou hast seen That which I never yet myself beheld. Though I have played the sacred song for years.
Striving with all my soul to penetrate Its mystery unto the master's form. Whilst thou hast reachetl it at a single bound ;
Henceforth the gods alone can teach thee tune.' "
Now, at the age of thirty, he became famous. Many
youths, sons of nobles, became his wilHng- scholars. At this
time he visited Lao-tsze, the founder of Taoism. While
in the capital, Avhere Lao-tsze lived, he entered an old
temple where he found a metal statue of a man with a
triple clasp upon his mouth. On the back of the statue
were ensfraved the words: "The ancients were Q-uarded in
their speech, and like them we should avoid loquacity. Many words invite many defeats. Avoid also engaging in
many businesses, for many businesses create many diffi
culties." "Observe this, my children," said the sage to his disciples. "These words are true, and commend them
selves to our reason."
He visited various great cities and courts of emperors, and everywhere was received with honor. Confucius was
saddened by the .-^ight of so much disorder. Soon after writing the "Book of Odes" and the "Book of History," he became magistrate of the town of Chung-Too. He



452 ERROR'S CHAINS.
now had an opportunity of putting Iiis principles of gov
ernment to the test, and the result partly justified his
expectations. He framed rules for the support of the
living, and for the observance of rites for the dead ; he
arranged appropriate food for the old and the young; and ne provided for the proper separation of men and
women. And the results were, we are told, that any
thing dropped on the road was not picked up ; there was
no fraudulent carving of vessels ; coffins were made of the ordained thickness; graves were unmarked by mounds raised over them ; and no two prices were charged in the
markets. The duke, surprised at what he saw, asked
the sage whether his rule of government could be applied
to the whole State. "Certainly," replied Confucius, "and
not only to the State of Loo, but to the whole empire."
Forthwith, therefore, the duke made him Assistant Super
intendent of Works, and shortly afterwards appointed him
Minister of Crime. Here, again, his success was com
plete. As soon as he was appointed he began to carry the laws into effect by punishing high-handed criminals and ere long good government resumed its sway.
Though eminently successful, the results obtained un
der his system were not quite such as his followers have represented them to have been. No doubt crime dimin
ished under his rule, but it was by no means abolished. In fact, his biographers mention a case which must have
been peculiarly shocking to him. A father brought an
accusation against his son, in the expectation, probably,
of gaining his suit with ease before a judge who laid such
stress on the virtues of filial piety. But to his surprise,
and that of the onlookers, Confucius cast both father
and son into prison, and to the remonstrance of the head
of the Ke-clan answered: "Am I to punish for a breach
of filial piety one who has never been taught to be filially









CONFUCIUS AND THE CLASSICS. 455
minded ? Is not he who nesflects to teach his son filial
duties, equally guilty with his son who fails in them ?
Crime Is not inherent in human nature, and therefore the
father in the family, and the government in the State are
responsible for the crimes committed against filial piety
and the public laws. If a king is careless about publish
ing laws, and then peremptorily punishes in accordance
with the strict letter of them, he acts the part of a swind
ler; if he collect the taxes arbitrarily without giving
warning, he is guilty of oppression ; and if he puts the
people to death without having instructed them, he com
mits a cruelty."
Confucius had great faith in the power of example. He could not carry out all his schemes nor always adhere
to his rules. Yet the people rejoiced in his rule, and at
their work sang songs, describing him as their saviour
from oppression and injustice. The tendencies of the
times were against the enthusiastic reformer, yet he
struCTOfled on. After he was dismissed from office in Loo
he became the counselor of princes. He went from
State to State, and ruler to ruler, until he was sixty-nine
years old. He never lost confidence in himself or in his
mission. One morning, in the spring of the year 47S
B. C, he walked in front of his door, saying:
" The great mountain must crumble; The strong beam must break, And the wise man withers away like a plant."
He was now without honor among the princes. As he
said, " No intelligent monarch arises ; there is not one in
the empire who will make me his master. My time is
come to die." That same day he took to his bed, and
after a week's sickness he died. He was buried with
great tokens of respect by his disciples.

TEACHINGS AND WRITINGS OF THE CHINESE SAGI^
No man, probably, has been treated with so much con
tempt during his hfetime, and with so much veneration
after his death, as Confucius. His hfe was a standing
protest against tlie iniquities of liis time. The teachings
of Confucius are contained in tliree thin volumes, called
the Lun Yu, or "Confucian Analects;" the Ta Hioh, or "Great Learning;" and the Chung Yung, or " Doctrine of the Mean." Confucius also edited the Yeh King, or
"Book of Chang;es ;" the She Kingr, or " Book of Odes ;" and the Shoo King, or " Book of History." He derided
spiritual teaching, did not refer to the future life, and had
little to say about the gods. As to where man came from, or where he was going, Confucius was never
troubled. He taught, man is master of his own happi
ness and destiny. He might, by his own efforts, become the equal of heaven. As to morals and good govern
ment Confucius's teachings rank high. He was really a
Statesman and Reformer, rather than a Religious Teacher.
Some selections from his three books will be of use as
illustrating the style and substance of his teachings:
THE WISDOM OF THE SAGE.
" Is he not a man of complete virtue who feels no discomposure, though men may take no note of him ?"
Tsang, the philosopher, said, " I daily examine myself
on three points —whether, in transacting business for
others, I may have been not faithful ; whether, in inter
course with friends, I may have been not sincere ; whether
I may have not mastered and practiced the instructions
of my teacher." The Master said, " He who aims to be a man of com
plete virtue, in his food does not seek to gratify his



CONFUCIUS AND THE CLASSICS ^cy
appetite, nor in his dwelling-place does he seek the
appliances of ease ; he is earnest in what he is doing,
and careful in his speech ; he frequents the company of
men of principle, that he may be rectified. Such a per
son may be said, indeed, to love to learn."
The Master said, " I will not be afflicted at men's not
knowing me ; I will be afflicted that I do not know men." The Master said, "At fifteen, I had my mind bent on
learning.
"At thirty, I stood firm.
"At forty, I had no doubts.
"At fifty, I knew the decrees of Heaven.
"At sixty, my ear was an obedient organyi^r the recep
tion of truth.
"At seventy, I could follow what my heart desired,
without transgfressinof what was rig-ht."
The Master said, " The superior man is catholic and
no partisan ; the mean man is a partisan and no catholic."
The Master said, " Learning without thought is labor
lost; thought without learning is perilous."
The Master said, " For a man to sacrifice to a spirit
which does not belong to him is flattery.
" To see what is rig-ht, and not to do it, is want of courag-e."
The Master said, "A man should say, ' I am not concerned that I have no place ; I am concerned how I may
fit myself for one. I am not concerned that I am not known ; I seek to be worthy to be known.' "
The Master said, " The reason why the ancients did
not readily give utterance to their words was that they
feared lest their actions should not come up to them."
Tsae Yu, being asleep during the daytime, the Master
said, " Rotten wood cannot be carved ; a wall of dirty
earth will not receive the trowel. This Yu ! —what is the
use of my reproving him ?"
28



458 ERjROK'S CHAINS.
The Master said, " I have not seen a firm and unbend
ing man." Some one rephed, "There is Shin Ch'ang."
" Ch'ang," said the Master, " is under the influence of liis lusts ; how can he be firm and unbending ?" Tsze-kung said, " Wliat I do not wish men to do tO'
me, I also wish not to do to men." The Master said,
" Tsze, you have not attained to that." The Master said, " Not to do to others as you would
not wish done to yourself."
Tsze-kung asked, saying, " is there one word which
may serve as a rule of practice for all one's life ?" The
Master said, " Is not reciprocity such a word ? What you
do not want done to yourself, do not do to others."
" When one cultivates to the utmost the principles of
his nature, and exercises them on the principle of reci
procity, he is not far from the path. What you do not
like, when done to yourself, do not do to others."
Tsze-loo said, " I should like, sir, to hear your wishes."
The Master said, "They are, in regard to the aged, to
give them rest ; in regard to friends, to show them sin
cerity ; in regard to the young, to treat them tenderly."
The Master said, "Admirable, indeed, was the virtue
of Hwuy ! With a single bamboo dish of rice, a single
ofourd dish of drink, and living in his mean, narrow lane,
while others could not have endured the distress, he did
not allow his joy to be affected by it. Admirable, indeed,
was the virtue of Hwuy !" The Master said, "They who know the truth are not
equal to those who love it ; and they who love it are not
equal to those who find delight in it."
The Master was mild, and yet dignified ; majestic, and
yet not fierce ; respectful, and yet easy.
Tsang said, " When a bird is about to die, its notes are
mournful ; when a man is about to die, his words are good."



CONFUCIUS AND THE CLASSICS. .rg
Confucius, in his village, looked simple and sincere,
and as if he were one who was not able to speak. Tsze-loo asked about government. The Master said,
" Go before the people zvith your example, and be labo
rious in their affairs."
The Master said, " The progress of the superior man is upwards ; the progress of the mean man is downwards."
The Master said, " In ancient times, men learned with. a view to their own improvement. Nowadays, men learn
with a view to the approbation of others."

CONFUCIAN TEMPLES AND WORSHIP.
The Emperor plowing in the Sacred Field, What time the New Year comes in solemn state. Richard Henry Stoddard.
AMONG the prominent objects of worship in China
may be specified Sliang-te, who is alone worshiped by tlie Emperor; the worship of Con
fucius ; and that of the spirits of deceased ancestors among
tlie common people. Besides these, there is a host of
deities who receive worship with the host of spirits who
are dreaded and who may be propitiated by worship.
The tenets of Confucius have been generally regarded
as a system of religion and
and have received the name of " Confucianism " among
the Western authors. His
precepts form the basis of
morals, but in the worship of Shang-te by the Empe
ror, who is at the head of
the system, he in person can
alone officiate at the most
important ceremonies. At
the same time that he wor
ships Shang-te he unites the worship of Confucius with it on the great altar of
heaven in Peking. The homage of Confucius enters into

the daily life of all students. In every school-room there
is a tablet, containing the name of the sage, before which
every scholar makes his bow when he enters the room.
A missionary thus describes the worship paid to him :
As there is no image of Confucius tor use on sucli oc
casions, a slip of red paper, of only a few inches in length,
on which has been written in black ink an expression meaning " The Teacher and Pattern for 10,000 ages" is
put upon the wall of the school-room. In front of this is
placed a table, having upon it a censer and a pair of can
dlesticks. When everything is
ready the teacher, having first
lighted and put in the censer
three sticks of incense, and in
the candlesticks a couple of
candles, kneels down before the
table, and placing his hands on the floor, bows his head toward
the earth slowly and reverently
three times. He then arises,
and one of his pupils takes his
place before the table, and kneels down, makine the same

till all have engaged in the worship of the sage. After
this, the food which is to be consumed in the feast is
placed on the table before the inscription to Confucius,
where it remains a short time. It is then removed to
another table, or tables, around which the teacher and
his pupils gather and partake of it. Before the feast the
teacher usually presents to each one of his pupils a white

paper fan, on which he sometimes writes a quotation
from the classics, or a favorite stanza of poetry. Be
sides this, he provides a number of toys, equal to the
number of his pupils, each representing a graduate of
the first, second or third literary degrees,' which are dis
tinguishable by the shape and color of their dresses. It
is decided by the throwing of dice in what order the
pupils shall choose these toys. These toys are valued
as an omen for good, or rather as an index of the success
in study which each may hope to attain. It is often an
interesting: and excitingf time amonp- the members of a
school.
On a Chinese youth entering a school as pupil for the
first time in any year, he is expected to bring with him
two small candles, a few sticks of incense, and a small
quantity of mock-money, which are to be lighted and
consumed before a slip of paper, having some title of
Confucius written upon it, the pupil making the usual
prostration before it after these things have been lighted
and while they are being consumed. This is called " en
tering school," or "worshiping the sage." One morning,
some six years ago, a lad, dressed in his best clothes,
marched into a free-school under the charge of a mis
sionary, carrying, beside his books, three sticks of in
cense, two small candles, and a few sheets of mock
money, designed, in accordance with established usage,
as an offerino- to the Chinese sao-e. It seemed that the
teacher had neglected to inform his parents that in the
mission school the sage was not worshiped. The lad
was quietly told that the articles he had brought would
not be used, inasmuch as those who studied the books
of Jesus did not burn incense in honor of Confucius.
Thus from earliest childhood the youth of China are
taught to reverence their great countryman, Confucius.



CONFUCIAN TEMPLES AND WORSHIP.
THE WORSHIP OF SHANG-TE, AT PEKING.
463
Notwithstanding the silence of Confucius on the sub
ject of Shang-te, his worship has been maintained, not,
perhaps, in its original purity, but with marks of rever
ence which place its object on the highest pinnacle of the
Chinese Pantheon. At the present day, the imperial
worship of Shang-te, on the round hillock to the south of
the city of Peking, is surrounded with all the solemnity
of which such an occasion is capable. The altar is a
beautiful marble structure, ascended by twenty-seven
steps : a balustrade surrounds each terrace. On the
upper of these three terraces are five tables or altars, on
which the offerins's to Shano-.te are laid. This is the
central point of attraction in this whole inclosure of a
square mile, which contains thousands of beautiful trees
and many subordinate buildings. On another terrace
stands a magnificent triple-roofed circular structure,
ninety-nine feet in height, which constitutes the most con
spicuous object of the whole. On the day before the
annual sacrifices at the Winter Solstice, the Emperor
proceeds to the Hall of Fasting, on the west side of the
south altar. Here he spends the night in watching and
meditation, after first inspecting the offerings. The tab
lets to the Supreme Ruler of Heaven {i. e., Shang-te,)
and to the Emperor's ancestors are preserved in the
chapel at the back of each altar. There are no images.
Both these chapels are circular, and covered with blue
glazed tiles. The south altar, the most important of all
Chinese religious structures, has the following dimen
sions. It consists of a triple circular terrace, 210 feet
wide at the base, 1 50 in the middle, and 90 at the top.
The heights of the three terraces, upper, middle and
lower, are 5^ feet, 6^ feet, and 5 feet respectively.



•rH £JiJiOK'S CHAINS.
At the time of sacrificing, the tablets to Heaven and to
the Emperor's ancestors are placed on the top ; they
are two feet five inches long and five inches wide. The
title is in gilt letters ; that of Heaven faces the south, and
those of the ancestors east and west. The Emperor,
with his immediate suite, kneels in front of the tablet to
Shang-te, and faces the north. The platform is laid with
marble stones, forming nine concentric circles. The
inner circle consists of nine stones, cut so as to fit with
close edges round the central stone, which is a perfect circle. Here the Emperor kneels, and is surrounded
first by the circles of the terraces and their inclosing
walls, and then by the circle of the horizon. He thus
seems to himself and his court to be in the centre of the
universe ; and, turningf to the north, assuming the attitude
of a subject, he acknowledges in prayer and by his posi
tion that he is inferior to Heaven, and to Heaven alone.
Round him, on the pavement, are the nine circles of as
many heavens, consisting of nine stones, then eighteen,
then tv/enty-seven, and so on in successive multiples of
nine till the square of nine, the favorite number of Chi
nese philosophy, is reached in the outermost circle of
eighty-one stones. As might be expected, careful dis
tinctions are made in the sacrifices. The animals ordi
narily used for food by the ancient Chinese, and the
fruits of the eardi known to them, are almost all included.
But productions recently introduced into the country are
not offered. To Heaven alone is offered a piece of blue
jade, cylindrical in shape and a foot long, formerly used
as a symbol of sovereignty. But the great distinguish
ing sign of superiority is the offering of a whole burnt
sacrifice to Heaven.
After the same style of building, and used as a part of the worship of Heaven and earth, is the Temple ot the









CONFUCIAN TEMPLES AND WORSHIP. 467
Sun, at Peking. This temple has been dedicated by the
Chinese to the sun as the great source of Hght and heat,
and it has been put under the protection of the god of
fire. Farmers frequent this temple in dull, cold weather,
to pray for the sunshine to ripen their grain and fruit,
and the people generally pray to this god for protection
against fire. The fourth day of every month is a high
day at this temple, and it is then crowded with wor
shipers. On this day, a band of music is provided, and,
in addition to the ordinary priests of the temple, extra
priests go about swinging incense, and conducting many
other imposing services.
In the spring of every year, the Chinese pay great
honors to agriculture. The Emperor proceeds to the
park surrounding the Temple of Agriculture, at Peking,
and in a plot of ground reserved for the purpose, and in
the presence of the grandees of the empire, he guides the
imperial plow, and uses the seed-planter, rake, etc.
After this, the Emperor and the attendant princes and
officials proceed to the Temple of Agriculture, which is
dedicated to Shin-7iung, or the " Divine Husbandman,"
the fabulous originator of the art. Here bullocks, swine
and sheep are offered in sacrifice, and prayers made to
Shin-nung, and also to the god of the land, the grain, the
ocean, the wind, the thunder and the rain. Similar plowing and worshiping are performed by the
leading mandarins near the south gates of all the princi
pal cities of the empire, after which the mandarins mount
a platform, and calling around them the principal farmers
of the vicinity, exhort thern to the proper discharge of
their duties as husbandmen. At the close of the ad
dresses, they present to each of the farmers, who have
b)een selected to receive them, certain presents or medals in the name of the Emperor, in order to encourage them.

TEMPLE TO CONFUCIUS.
The most important and sacred temple is that adjoin
ing the tomb of Confucius in Shantung, on which all the
art of the Chinese architecture has been lavished. The
main building consists of two stories, the upper veranda surrounding which " rests on gorgeous marble pillars,
twenty-two feet high, and about two feet in diameter,
which at a distance appear as if huge dragons were coiled around them and hanging from the top. The tiles of
the roof are of yellow, as in Peking, and the ornamentation under the eaves is covered with wire-work to keep
it from the birds. Inside the building is the image or
statue of Confucius, in a gorgeously-curtained shrine,
holding in his hand a slip of bamboo, such as was used
for writing upon in his days. The statue is about
eighteen feet by six feet, and is life-like. Confucius was
strong, tall and well-built, with a full red face, and large
and heavy head. On the tablet is the simple inscription,
'The most Holy prescient Sage Confucius. His Spirit's
resting-place.' On the east side are images of his favor
ite disciples, arranged according to the estimation in
which he is said to have held them. The ceiling of the
building is crowded with tablets, hung up in honor of the
sage, each vying with another in extravagant praise.
Before him and also before his disciples, were the usual
frames for sacrifices, and in front of these, beautiful in
cense-pots, beside them were several most interesting
relics, such as vases, said to be of the Shang Dynasty,
B. C. 1610, the work of which was superb. There were
also two bronze elephants, reported to be of the Chow
Dynasty, and a table of that same era of dark red-wood.
"On the west side are two temples; one in front, in

hind, in honor of his mother. . . . On the east side
are temples to his five ancestors, and a large block of
marble, whereon is a eenealosfical tree, cjiving- all the
branches of his family. . . . The building behind the
grand temple is the temple in honor of his wife, in which
was only a tablet and no image. The second temple
behind that contained four tablets, erected by K'ang-he
in his honor, one character on each, and the interpreta
tion was: 'The perspicuous teacher of 10,000 kingdoms.'
Here also are three pictures of the sage on marble ; one
an old man, full-length, rather dim, having no date ; the
second smaller, with seal characters on the side ; the
third and best, giving only his head and shoulders.
These varied somewhat but were substantially alike. All
of them have the mouth or lips open and front teeth ex
posed, and the full contemplative eyes. Immediately
behind these are engravings on marble, illustrating all
the chief incidents of his life, with appropriate explana
tions at the side. Of these there were altogether 120
slabs, which are built Into the wall.
"The Image of Confucius does not stand alone, but Is
surrounded by Images of his principal disciples, while In
a hall at the back of that dedicated to him are ranged
those of his ancestors. Occasionally different emperors

the most celebrated both as a ruler and a scholar of the
emperors of the present dynasty, went on such a pilgrim

time lying his forehead thrice In the dust before the
image of the sage.'
"In the eighteen provinces there are 1,500 temples

days of each moon, sacrificial services are performed
before him, and once in the spring and autumn the local
officials go in state to take part in acts of specially
solemn worship. According to the Shing ineaoii- che, or
'History of the Temples of the Sage,' as many as six
bullocks, 27,000 pigs, 5,800 sheep, 2,800 deer and 2,700
hares are sacrificed on these occasions, and at the same
time 27,600 pieces of silk are offered on his shrine." We have before mentioned the examination of can
didates for civil service in the classics. It will be of in
terest now to orive more in detail on these examinations.

EXAMINATIONS IN THE SACRED BOOKS.
Dr. H. M. Field tells us of the Examination Hall that,
in the eastern quarter of Canton, is an inclosure of many acres, laid off in a manner which betokens some unusual
purpose. The ground is divided by a succession of long,
low buildings not much better than horse-sheds around a New England meeting-house in the olden time. They
run in parallel lines, like barracks for a camp, and are
divided into narrow compartments. Once in three years
this vast camping-ground presents an extraordinary
spectacle, for then are gathered in these courts, from all
parts of the province, some 10,000 candidates, all of whom
have previously passed a first examination, and received a degree and now appear to compete for the second.
Some are young, and some are old, for there is no limit
put upon age. As the candidates present themselves, each
man is searched, to see that he has no books, or helps of
any kind, concealed upon his person. He is then put in a
stall about three feet wide, just large enough to turn
round in and as bare as a prisoner's cell. There is a
niche In the wall, in which a board can be placed for him
to sit upon, and another niche to support a board that has

to serve as breakfast-table and writing-table. This is the
furniture of his room. Here he is shut in from all com
munication with the world, his food being passed to him
through a door, as to a prisoner. Certain themes are
then submitted to him in writincr on which he is to furnish
o
written essays, intended generally, and perhaps always,
to determine his knowledge of the classics. It is some
times said that these are frivolous questions, the answers
to which afford no proof whatever of one's capacity for
office, but it should be remembered that these classics
are the writings of Confucius, which are the political ethics
of the country, the very foundation of the government,
without knowing- which, one is not qualified to take part
in its administration.
The candidate o-oes into his cell in the afternoon, and
spends the night there, which gives him time for re
flection, and all the next day and next night, when he comes out, and after a few days is put in again for another
trial of the same character, and this is repeated a third
time ; at the end of which he is released, and his essays
are submitted for examination. Of the 10,000, only
75 can obtain a degree—not one in a hundred ! The
9,925 must go back disappointed, their only consola
tion being, that after three years they can try again.
Even the successful ones do not thereby get an
office, but only the right to enter for a third competi
tion, which takes place at Peking, by which of course
their ranks are thinned still more. The few who get
through this threefold ordeal take a high place in the
literary class, from which all appointments to the public service are made. Here is the system of examination
complete. No trial can be imagined more severe, and it
oueht to eive the Chinese the best civil service in the
world.

ANECDOTES OF STUDENTS.
HOW MENCIUS'S MOTHER INCITED HER SON TO STUDY.
During the Chow dynasty (B. C. 1122-225), Mencius,
at the age of three years, lost his father. His mother, whose name was Sin, was a woman of distinguished worth and virture. Mencius went to school, but soon threw aside his books and returned home. His mother
was very much incensed at this course, and taking a knife,
cut the web of cloth she was weaving, saying: " My son,
your desisting from your studies is like my cutting this
web." Mencius, trembling with apprehension, returned
to school and studied with diligence, nor did he intermit
his literary pursuits until he became a worthy, next in
rank to the sage Confucius.
HOW A TIRED STUDENT WAS LED BACK TO HIS STUDIES.
In the time of the Tang dynasty (620-906 A. D.) Lei Peh, while yet young, and before he had completed 'his
studies left school and started for home. On the road he saw an old woman engaged in grinding away on an
iron pestle. Peh inquired why she was thus grinding
the pestle? She answered: '' I want to make a nced/e."
He was surprised at her words, and influenced by them,
returned to school, and studied with most assiduous
application. He finally became a member of the Imperial
college at the capital.
THE LITTLE SAGE WHO HID FIRE TO LIGHT HIS LAMP.
Probably between 479-501 A. D, lived Y'su Yung, who when he was only eight years old, was so fond of study, that
his parents were afraid he would impair his eyes by his
diligence. They therefore forbade him the use of books, but he would not obey them. Constantly he hid fire



476 ERROR'S CHAINS.
until his parents had retired to rest, when he would light
his lamp and study. He took his clothes, and the cover
let of his bed and hung them up over the window of his room, lest the light escaping through it, should be seen
by some one of the family. In this way his name became
very widely celebrated as a scholar. At home and
abroad the people called him " the little sage." At the
aee of twelve he became a hio;h officer of o-overnment,
and was afterward promoted to the Superintendency
of the Offering of Wine.
AN EXAMPLE OF A STUDIOUS ANCESTOR.
Fan Shun Jin, in the Sung dynasty, day and night was
diligent in study. He was in the habit of placing his
lamp within the curtains of his bed, and thus studymg till
past midnight. Afterward, he became a very distin
guished officer. His wife preserved the curtain, which,
at the top, had become black by the soot. Occasionally
she would bring it forth, and show it to her children and
grandchildren, saying, " Yoiu^ father and grandfathei^,

TFIE STUDENT WITH A ROUND STICK FOR A PILLOW.
During the Sung dynasty, Sie Ma Wan, when a boy, whether he was moving about or at rest, in all his con
duct was dignified and decorous, like a perfect old gen
tleman. At seven years of age he heard an explanation of the classic called "Spring and Autumn." He was
very much pleased, and, having returned home, conversed with the members of his family in such a manner as to show that he understood its principles. He was
accustomed to use a round block of wood for a pillow.
When he became sleepy, and fell into a doze, this pillow



CONFUCIAN TEMPLES AND WORSHIP. 477
would roll a little and awaken him. Once awakened, he
would apply himself to his studies again with vigor. He
finally became an object of worship, his tablet being
placed in the temple of Confucius.
THE STUDENT WITH A HOLE IN THE WALL.
In the Han dynasty, which began about 205 B. C, and ended about 25 A. D., lived Kwang Hung, who was very
indigent. Though very fond of books, he was destitute
of the means of purchasing oil. His neighbor, in the
adjoining house, had candles ; but the light could not
penetrate through the wall. Hung therefore made a hole
in it, in order to procure rays of light by which he could
prosecute his studies. In the city, a wealthy man, whose
surname was Great, had a large number of books. Hung
was anxious to work for him, though not for the purpose
of receiving wages. He only desired the privilege of
reading the rich man's books as his pay. Mr. Great was
so much interested in the proposal and in the man that • he gave him some of his books as his wages. Hung
became a very learned man, and finally obtained the office
of prime minister.
With stories like these the Chinese encourage the peo
ple to study the sacred books. Besides the gods above mentioned there are hundreds of others, gods of occupa
tions, professions and callings; gods of literature, of art,
of play-acting, of gambling, and a host of others are found
everywhere.

CHAPTER XXV.
HOME-LIFE UNDER CONFUCIANISM.
A man do good, lie go to Joss; he no do good, very much bamboo catchee he.

The famous Howqua's reply to an American seacaptain.
NE of the most prominent features of the Chinese
religion is the excessive reverence that is paid to
parents. We remember the commandment of
old, " Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God
giveth thee." The Chinese have long lived in their land;
they have outlived the kingdoms of Persia, Egypt, Judea, Babylon, Greece and Rome. It certainly seems as if this
were a fulfillment of the promise of God, that, as they'
honor their parents, so are they permitted to live long in
their land. This reverence for parents, while living and
after death, is found among other nations ; but nowhere
is so great stress laid upon this part of duty as in China.
The ancient ritual on filial duty directs that, during the
lifetime of his parents, a son should not go abroad, or, if
he do so, then to a fixed place. When at home, he
should rise with the first cock-crow, and having washed
and dressed himself carefully, should inquire what the
wishes of his parents are as to the food they would eat
and drink. He should not enter a room unless invited
by his father, nor retire without permission ; neither
should he speak unless spoken to. When leaving the
house, he should report himself, and on returning should



HOME-LIFE UNDER CONFUCIANISM. 479
make his presence known. He should be regular in his
amusements, attentive to his calling, constant in speech,
and avoiding all reference to old age. This last is a
point strongly insisted upon, and every boy has held up
to him as an example to be followed the conduct of Laou
CHINESE SITTING-ROOM.
Lai-tsze, who, fearing that the recognition by his parents
of the fact that he was seventy years old would remind
them of their own great age, used to dress himself in a
child's frock, and play about the room like an infant
!
"Of all things," said Confucius, "which derive their na
tures from Heaven and earth, man is the most noble
;



48o ERJiOK'S CHAINS.
and of all the duties which are incumbent on him, there
is none greater than filial obedience ; nor, in performing
this is there anything so essential as to reverence one's
father ; and, as a mark of reverence, there is nothing
more important than to place him on an equality with Heaven. Thus did the noble Duke Chow. Formerly,
he sacrificed on the round altar to the spirits of his re
mote ancestors, as equal with Heaven ; and in the open
hall he sacrificed to Wan Wang (his father), as equal
with Shang-te."
Repeatedly, throughout the teachings of the sage and
of Mencius, reference is made to ancestral worship. Yet,
it did not orignnate with Confucius, for he but handed
down a more ancient form of worship. Confucius merely
revived that. Really, Confucius cared very little about
worship of any sort ; his system was of the earth, earthy. All the worship of modern Confucianism is the addition
of later days. Whatever of worship or of strictly religious
teaching is to be found in Confucius's writings is there
because of some connection with government or moral
teachings. The idea of filial piety is carried up to the government. The common people must respect and
obey the officers as fathers ; lower officers must look
upon the higher officers as fathers ; and all must look to
the Emperor as father. He, in turn, must look upon his
people as his children. Thus the paternal idea prevails.
WORSHIPING THE TABLET.
Almost every Chinese house has either a "hall of an
cestors" or at least a closet, where the ancestral tablet is
kept. The tablet is called Shin Chu, meaning hotise of t\\&
spirit. It is made of wood, and is generally about twelve
inches high and three inches wide. The wood is gener
ally fragrant, and parts are elaborately carved. It con



HOME-LIFE UKDER CONFUCIANISM. 481
sists of three pieces, a pedestal and two upright pieces.
Often a place is cut in the back, in which pieces of paper
containinof the names
of ancestors are in
serted. Every day be
fore this tablet incense
and paper prayers are
burned. The prayers
are written upon the
paper, and the Chinese
believe that when the
papers are burned they
go to their dead fathers
and mothers. These
are not prayers for
these dead parents, but
prayers to them. They
believe that each man
has three souls, one of
which at his death goes to Heaven, one remains with the body in the grave and one re
turns home and lives
in the ancestral tablet.
In April of each year a
day is selected, when
especial worship is paid
at the graves. Every man, woman and child
hastens away to the ancestral tablet. family tombs, taking offerings and candles to worship at the graves. To neglect
this ceremony is counted a slight to one's dead parents.

To a Chinaman there is no oreater sin than to neglect
the worship of an ancestor ; no greater calamity can hap
pen than that he should die and be burled away from his
native land. Almost every steamer that crosses the Pacific from America carries one or more preserved
bodies of Chinamen, taking them home to be buried.
CEREMONY OF TURNING THE BRIDGE-LADDER.
AfLer the dead body has been laid out, this singular
custom Is observed in many families. Sometimes those

do not practice It on the death of its head. The married
daughters are expected then to return home.

Several Taoist priests are employed to prepare the.
"bridge-ladder" and aid in the celebration of the cere
mony at the expense of the son-in-law or sons-in-law of
the deceased. A post seven or eight feet high is placed
in a socket or frame standinof on the trround. Into holes
made in the sides of this post are fastened several bam

these sticks amount to several tens. The longer ones are placed toward the bottom and the shorter ones toward
the too, the lowest tier being three or four feet from the
ground. At the extreme outer end of each is suspended
by a wire a kind of glass cup containing oil and wicking,
the whole constituting a lamp. On the top of the post is
placed a candle. Into a hole, about three feet from the
ground, made in the upright post, is inserted a pole pro
jecting at a right-angle, some two or three feet longer
than the longest of the sticks having lamps at their ends.



HOME- LIFE UNDER CONFUCIANISM. 485
This "bridge ladder," is placed in the middle of die
room. On one side of the room is placed a table having
candles and incense on it. On the wall or partition of
the room by this table are suspended one or two large
paper hangings, relating to the infernal regions. The
body of the deceased is lying on one side of the room,
or, if there is an adjoining room which can be used it is
placed in tliat.
When everything is ready, the ceremony is commenced
by lighting the lamps and candle on the "bridge-ladder,"
-as well as the candles and incense on the table. The
priests chant their liturgy amid the noise of cymbals.
The married daughter comes forward, having a white
cotton cloth bound about her head, partially concealing
her eyes, or she holds to her eyes a white cotton cloth much as one would a handkerchief while crying. The
eldest son of the deceased, if there be a living son, now
advances and taking hold of the end of the long pole
pushes gently against it. The post turning on its socket,
the entire "bridge-ladder" moves. The wife of the eldest
son, his younger brothers and their wives, the married
daughter of the deceased and her children, etc., now fol
low, slowly, the elder brother as he turned around the
"bridge-ladder" for a few times. In case there is no son a married or affianced daughter
leads the company. During the period that this "bridge
ladder" is thus made to revolve, all of the party join in
loud lamentation and wailing. Their outcry, taken in
connection with the chanting of the priests and the noise of the cymbals, make a very confused hubbub and tumult
of voices and sounds. These, together with the sight of so many lamps and candles burning brightly in broad
daylight, produce a very singular spectacle for the foreign
beholder, which, once seen, will not be quickly forgotten.



486 EJiROK'S CHAINS.
The object of this performance with the bridge-laddei
is to lighten and assist the deceased on his way. It is
called "bridge-ladder'' because it is fancied to resemble
a bridge and a ladder. The bridge would aid the dead
to pass rivers, and the ladder would help him to climb steep places, should he meet such impediments in his journey.
With this extreme reverence for the dead, of course,
there can be no question but that the Chinese hold most
determinedly to the belief in a future life. In reality, the whole character of Buddhism in China is shaped by this.
Buddhism has no distinct teaching of an immortal life
;
and when it was brought to China, it gained no acceptance
until the blank, despairing tenets of the Nirvana was
changed into a bright, cheerful Paradise of the Blessed Dead. Examination will show that the Buddhism of China and the Buddhism of India very little resemble one
another, and, if we mistake not, the difference grew out
of the belief in a future life, which is a prime teaching irb
the Chinese faith.
The worship of ancestors enters into all the homelife,, manners and customs of the entire Chinese people.
WORSHIP OF ANCESTORS AT A WEDDING.
The tablets of the family are arranged on a table
standing in the back part of the reception-room, or in a
shrine placed on the table. Incense and candles, ar
ranged, according- to custom, near the tablets, having
been lighted, the bridegroom and his bride kneel down
three or four times before the tablets, the wife being on
the right-hand side of her husband. While on their knees,,
at each kneeling, they bow their heads down toward the
ground once. On rising to their feet they change places,
and then kneel down three or four times again, and bow









HOME-LIFE UNDER CONFUCIANISM. 489
their heads as before in front of and toward the tablets.
They now arise, and two chairs are placed before the
table which contains the incense, candles and tablets.
If the paternal grandparents of the groom are living and
present, they take
their seats in the
chairs, the grandmother being on
the right hand of
the grandfather,
with their faces turned away from
the table or to
ward the front
part of the room.
In case either has
deceased, the tab
let which repre
sents that person
is placed in the chair which he or she would have occu

kneel down three or four times before them, bowing their
heads toward the ground as in worshiping the tablets.
They then arise, and, having changed positions, kneel
down and bow again three or four times. The parents
of the groom then take their seats in the chairs, and the
ceremony of kneeling and bowing is repeated, in like manner, the customary number of times. While the
bride is on her knees, her new mother usually arranges
some costly ornaments in her hair, as gold or pearls, or
gives her some valuable finger-rings, if able to afford the
expense of such ; or, if poor, she presents her with such head ornaments as she can afford. The women who assist the bride in performing these ceremonies improve

the opportunity to offer tea to her parents at this period,
and are rewarded for their attentions with a present
of money on the spot. In case either parent is dead, the
ancestral tablet for that person is placed in the chair, as
in the supposed case of one of the grandparents having
deceased. The paternal and maternal uncles and aunts
of the groom, if present, in the order of their seniority,
now take their turns of being worshiped by the couple.
Oftentimes, these relatives will not sit, but content them
selves to stand during the worship rendered them.
Standing, on these occasions and during the reception of
these honors, is regarded as a mark of humility.
MOTHER, GODDESS OF CHILDREN.
Married but childless women twice a year go to the temple of Mother, taking incense and candles to burn
before her image. They come to the temple to get a
shoe which is to represent the goddess in their homes.
They declare that if the goddess will give them a male
child, they will render thanksgiving to her. They do not
cherish the slightest desire to have a female child.
The Chinese classics say :
"When a son is born, He sleeps on a bed; He is clothed in robes
;
He plays with gems ; His cry is princely loud ! But when a daughter is born, She sleeps on the ground; She is clothed with a wrapper; She plays with a tile ;
She is incapable either of evil or good;
It is hers only to think of preparing wine and food, And not giving any occasion of grief to her parents !"
, This is an accurate expression of the Chinese prefer

they are but a
few hours old, rather than
keep them.
Whenever a ]
child is born,

takes to some
temple two
shoes, just like

before a child

offer gifts as a
propitiation to
two female de
mons which
are supposed to seek to destroy the mother at the birth

propriate to the occasion. Sometimes several live crabs
are turned out into the streets to take the evil spirits
with them, and other curious devices are employed.
TEACHING A CHILD TO WORSHIP IDOLS.
From childhood, the Chinese are accustomed to worship
idols and ancestors. Family parties may often be seen

in the temples ; grandmothers and mothers teaching the
httle ones to bow down to idols. Here is a description
given by an eye-witness. He was introduced into an
idol temple, and stood in the back part of the great hall,
where the chief idols are placed, and from thence he
could watch what went forward. Soon a well-dressed lady came in with
her three children,
of about seven, five
and three years of
age. The two elder
boys ran forward,
and bowed down
before the idol in
the usual way, and
then called their lit
tle brother to come
forward also and do
as they had done.
But this was evi
dently his first visit
to the temple ; for the little fellow was very much fright
ened at the sigrht of the idol. The mother then draeced
the child into position, and standing behind and holding
him fast by both arms, forced him to bow slightly three
times, and then adroitly slipped out of her sleeve some
toys and sweets, which she gave the child, saying that
the god had given him these nice things because he was
a good boy ; and she told him to thank the idol, which he
did with great heartiness.
When the child grows up, and is able to see through
such tricks, the priest has taken the mother's place, and,
by carefully-concealed deceits, manages to delude him into
believing just what it may be thought best to teach him.

THE GOD OF THE KITCHEN.
There is another important object of Chinese worship,
whose place of abode is in the kitchen. His name is Tsz

candles are burned before the kitchen-eod on the first
and fifteenth days of each month. To represent this god,
the poorer people use simply a piece of red paper, with
the god's name written on it. Generally, a sheet of

white paper is used, on which the likeness of an old man
and woman has been stamped, together with pictures of
fowls, dogs, buffaloes, etc., and tables. This paper is
pasted to a board and suspended in the kitchen. The
Chinese say that there are two objects of worship in
every house, and these are the ancestral tablet and the
kitchen-god. This god is supposed to have charge of



404 £AVv't?/v"6- CJJAJNS.
the family; and his duty is to keep a strict watch over
all the members of it. This he must do, because, at the
end of each year, he has to make a report of the year's conduct to the great god Yuh-Hwang, the " Pearly Em
peror, Supreme Ruler," who rules in Heaven over all the
lesser gods. Five days before the Chinese New Year,
this kitchen-god is supposed to leave every house and
ascend to Heaven, to make his yearly report.
On the day before his supposed departure, feasts are
offered to him, and more than usual honors paid him, in
the hope that he may be bribed to give a good account.
At the exact time of his departure, fire-crackers are let
off, incense burned, and worship offered, in order that he
may start on his long journey in a good temper, and with
as much dignity as possible. His return is expected, and
he is received with the same marks of respect which attend his going away. Every shop-keeper, banker and merchant has a piece
of red paper, on which the w^ords "god of wealth" are
written, pasted on his wall. Seldom do they make an
image ot this god. Incense and candles are burned, and
prayers are offered daily. Often, after the festiA'als of
this god, mock-money and mock-clothing are burned for
the benefit of the spirits of beggars in purgatory.
THE STORY OF MA-CHU, GODDESS OF THE SAILORS.
She was the daugrhter of a man who, with his sons, was
engaged on the ocean in the pursuit of a living. He was
born during the Sung dynasty, and lived in the Hing
Hua prefecture of the province of Fuh-kien. One day, while she was engaged in the employment of weaving in
her mother's house she fell asleep through excessive
weariness, her head resting upon her loom. She dreamed
that she saw her father and two brothers on their separate



HOME-LIFE UNDER CONFUCIANISM. -ge
junks in a terrific storm. She exerted herself to rescue tliem from danger. She immediately seized upon the
junk which contained her father, with her mouth, while
with her hands she caught a firm hold upon the two junks which contained her two brothers. She was dragging
them all toward the shore when, alas ! she heard the
voice of her mother calling to her, and, as she was an
obedient girl, forgetting that she held her father's junk
in her mouth, she hastily opened it to ansv.'er her mother.
She awoke in great distress and, lo ! it was a dream, but
not all a dream, for in a few days the nev/s arrived that
the fleet of junks had encountered a dreadful storm, and that the one in which her father was had been wrecked, and
he had perished, while those in which her brothers were
had been signally rescued. The girl knew that she had
been the means of the salvation of her brothers, and that
opening her mouth to answer her mother's call was the
occasion of her failure to rescue her father's vessel. This
girl became, as the result of her dream, one of the most
popular objects of worship in the empire.
The emperors of China have, at different times since
her death, conferred various high-sounding titles upon her, some of which seem blasphemous. She is called " Queen ofHeaven" and " The Holy Mother in the heavens
above!' One is often reminded by the titles given her
and the worship and honors paid her, of the titles which
are given to the mother of Jesus by the authority of the Pope of Rome. Sailors often take with them some embers
or ashes which they obtain from the censer before some
popular image of the goddess. These ashes they carry
about their person in a small red bag, or they suspend them
about the junk in convenient places, or they put them in
the censer before the image of that which they worship.
When there is a violent storm, and there seems but little



496 EHHOK'S CHAINS.
hope that the junk will outride it, the sailors all kneel
down near the bow with incense in their hands, and call
out in doleful and bitter tones upon Ma-Chii to send
deliverance. In case they reach the port without ship
wreck, they are bound to offer her an especial thanks
giving- of food, with or without theatrical plays in her
honor, according to their vow.
Thus we have seen that the Chinese, thougfh standing
high above other Asiatic nations in point of civilization,
are yet as idolatrous as any. Buddhism and Taoism
have somewhat lessened the hold of Confucius upon the
great Chinese nation ; and Christianity and western
civilization have done much toward introducing a new

A lady living in China narrates the following Chinese myth
:
A gambler once went to a temple, to secure the help
of a certain god therein. His
luck had been bad, and he was unable to bring any ob
lation besides incense and paper money ; but he prom
ised that, if the god would
help him to win a certain sum, he would then bring a
thank-offering- havino; ten feet.
The god reckoned the sorts
of tribute usually paid to him ;
and, as the feet of a pig, a kid and a duck would toGOD OF GAMBLING. ^^^^er mako ten, he supposed that these were the animals that would be laid upon

his altar, should the gambler succeed. So he favored
the gambler, and caused him to gain even more than the
stipulated sum. The gambler fulfilled the letter of his
promise by laying a single crab on the altar. The god
was very angry at being thus duped, and thenceforth
exerted so unpropitious an influence in the gambler's
affairs that he went and ascertained through a spirit
medium the cause of his misfortunes. Aeain he came
with fair words, promising that, if the god would once
more grant his aid, he should have a whole pig as com
pensation. The god was mollified, and again favored
the o-ambler, so that his winningfs were laro-e. He brought
the pig as a thank-offering. It was a fine, strong one
;
but it was alive, and not in a condition in which it would
be edible for either Qfods or men. While the grod looked
in astonishment at this departure from the established
customs in the payment of a vow, the gambler fastened
the pig by a strong rope to the leg of the throne on
which the orod sat, and beran to lisfht the fire-crackers,
by which an offering is announced. The explosion of
the fire-crackers frightened the pig, so that it ran away
dragging both god and throne after it, till both were upset and broken. Thus the astute gambler outwitted
the honest god.

E now come to the study of the last of the sys
tems of idol worship, Buddhism. This is one
of the most interesting of all. It stands at
once nearest to and farthest from Christianity. In its
extent, it is the greatest religion of the world. It in
cludes four-tenths (nearly one-half) of all the world's
population. The following figures indicate the compara
tive streneth of the different existing relio-ions :

It must be remembered, however, that very lew ot the
500,000,0000! Buddhists are Buddhists only. Many of the
Chinese Buddhists are Confucianists and Taoists as well.
Many of the Ceylonese (or rather Singhalese) Buddhists
are devil-worshipers and star-worshipers as well. So, also,
one otten sees in the Buddhist temples ot Japan the
Shinto symbols. Indeed, the rapid and wide growth of
Buddhism is due to the readiness with which it tolerates
other religions. To write the history of Buddhism is to
write the history of the hopes, and aspirations, and most
sacred feelings of nearly one-half the human race of
modern times. Buddhism has been received, by both
very savage and very civilized peoples—the wild Nomad
hordes of the cold northern lands of Tartary, Thibet and
Nepal ; the cultured Chinese and Japanese, and the quiet Siamese, Burmese and Ceylonese. A religion of such wide acceptance by nations and in
dividuals of such different characters and circumstances,
and which has controlled the destinies of thousands of
millions of souls during nearly twenty-three hundred
years, and which comes nearest to Christianity in the
purity of its morals and the benefits it proposes to confer
upon the human race, is certainly worthy of very careful
attention. In studying it we must carefully avoid either
a wholesale condemnation or an unqualified approval
;
we must recognize that there are both crood and evil in
it. It is to be remembered, also, that we can only look
upon Buddha's teachings after the lapse of ages, and
from this long distance the view is likely to be anything
else than clear. Without a doubt the doctrines of Buddha
have been so perverted, that he would scarcely recognize
the religion that bears his name to-day. Then, too,
being an Oriental religion, we Western people cannot
study it under as favorable circumstances as the Eastern



5O0 ERJiOR'S CHAINS.
people. Oriental religions can be seen best by Oriental
eyes.
Buddhism is a reform upon Brahminism. It is of
Hindu origin, and while it has but little sway in the land
of its birth, it retains the Hindu cast in all its wanderingo-s
into other lands and its observances among other peoples.
THE STORY OF GAUTAMA, THE FOUNDER OF BUDDHISM.
In giving these legends of the life of Gautama, it
should be stated that they are derived from the writings
of Buddhists who lived long after Gautama was dead.
They are to be received, of course, with that degree of
credulity which would attend the legends of devoted dis
ciples of any such teacher. Those who have studied Bud
dhism in its native land have collected these legends with
ereat care, among^ whom one of the most careful authors is Rev. Spence Hardy, who has collected and commented
on them with great candor.
At the end of the sixth century before Christ, a wise
and good king reigned in the capital city of his country,,
Kapila-vastu, about one hundred miles ijorth-east from
the great city of Benares, in India. Around this city the snow-crowned, giant peaks of the Himalayas towered up
in the clear blue of the Indian sky. The city was on the
banks of an insignificant river, the Rohini. The people
lived from the produce of their cattle and their rice-fields ;
they adhered to the Hindu religion. The wife of King Suddhodana v/as named Maya, because of her wondrous
beauty. She was childless until her fort)'- fifth year.
Litde Prince Siddartha was born under the shade of a
satin-tree, in the year 552 B. C. In later years he was called the "Buddha." At this time, in addition to the
name Siddartha, he received the name of Sakya-muni
from his family, and that of Gautama from his clan.



BUDDHA, THE " LIGHT OF ASIA! 501
Just as in the case of other famous men, many mar
velous stories are told concerning his miraculous birth,
and the precocious wisdom and power of the infant
prince. At his birth, the legends say, ten thousand
worlds were filled with light, the blind received their
sight, the deaf heard, the lame walked, the imprisoned
were set free, the trees burst forth in blossom, the air
was filled with sweet songs of birds, and even the fires
of hell were for the time being- extinsfuished. On the
fifth day after his birth, at the " name-choosing festival,"
108 Brahmin priests met to select the most fitting name.
One of them, the most learned in divination, predicted
that he will be a " Buddha," who will remove the veils of
sin and ignorance from the world. Gautama is the name by which he is most commonly known among the south
ern Buddhists. Buddha, or, more properly, the Buddha, means the Enlightened One, and is an official title, just
as we say Jesus, the Christ, or the Anointed One. Dur
ing his youth Gautama is noted for his prowess, and for
teaching even his masters in the arts and sciences. He
has, so the legends go on to say, most magnificent equip
ages and many servants. He is early married to his
cousin. He devotes himself to study and meditation,
and his relatives charge him with neo^jecting- to train
himself in manly exercises. Gautama, being told of their
murmurings, appoints a day by beat of drum to prove
his skill against all comers. At the trial he surpasses
the cleverest bowmen, and exhibits wonderful strength
and skill in his feats of horsemanship. In his twenty
ninth year, Gautama abandons his home to devote him
self entirely to the study of religion and philosophy. He had been accustomed to say, " Nothing is stable
on earth, nothing is real. Life is like the spark produced
by the friction of wood. It is lighted, and it is extin

guished ; we know not whence it came and whither it
goes. It is like the sound of a lyre, and the wise man
asks in vain from whence it came and whither it goes. There must be some supreme intelligence where we
could find rest. If I attained to it, I could bring- lieht to
man ; if I were free myself, I could deliver the world."
With this hope, and being moved thereto by four inci
dents, he gave himself, as we have just said, to seeking
the light of the world. These were but ordinary events,
and' yet they had a great effect upon Gautama.
Gautama's four visions.
One day when the prince, with a large retinue, was
driving through the eastern gate of the city on the way
to one of his parks, he met on the road an old man,
broken and decrepit. One could see the veins and
muscles over the whole of his body ; his teeth chattered,
he was covered with wrinkles, bald and hardly able to
utter hollow and unmelodious sounds. He bent on his
stick, and all his limbs and joints trembled. "Who
is that man?" said the prince to his coachman. "He is
small and weak, his flesh and his blood are dried up, his
muscles stick to his skin, his head is white, his teeth
chatter, his body is wasted away ; leaning on his stick he
is hardly able to walk, stumbling at every step. Is there
something peculiar in his family, or is this the common
lot of all created beings ?"
"Sir," replied the coachman, "that man is sinking
under old age ; his senses have become obtuse, suffering
has destroyed his strength, and he is despised by his
relations. He is without support and useless, and people
have abandoned him, like a dead tree in a forest. But
this is not peculiar to his family. In every creature
youth is defeated by old age. Your father, your mother,



BUDDHA, THE '' LIGHT OF ASIA:' cq
all your relations, all your friends, will come to the same
state ; this is the appointed end of all creatures."
"Alas!" replied the prince, "are creatures so ignorant,
so weak and foolish, as to be proud of the youth by
which they are intoxicated, not seeing the old age which awaits them! As for me, I go away. Coachman, turn
my chariot quickly. What have I, the future prey o!
old age—what have I to do with pleasure ?" And the
young prince returned to the city without going to his
park.
Another time the prince was driving through the
southern gate to his pleasure-garden, when he perceived
on the road a man suffering from illness, parched with
fever, his body wasted, covered with mud, without a
friend, without a home, hardly able to breathe, and fright
ened at the sight of himself and the approach of death. Having questioned his coachman, and received from him
the answer which he expected, the young prince said
:
"Alas ! health is but the sport of a dream, and the fear oi
suffering must take this frightful form. Where is the
wise man who, after having seen what he is, could any
longer think of joy and pleasure ?" The prince turned
his chariot and returned to the city.
A third time he was driving to his pleasure-garden
through the western gate, when he saw a dead body on
the road, lying on a bier, and covered with a cloth. The
friends stood about, crying, sobbing, tearing their hair
covering their heads with dust, striking their breasts and
uttering wild cries. The prince, again calling his coacli
man to witness this painful scene, exclaimed: "O woe to youth, which must be destroyed by old age ! Woe to health, which must be destroyed by so many diseases !
W^oe to this life, where a man remains so short a time !
If there were no old age, no disease, no death ; if these



504 EJfJfOJ^'S CHAINS.
could be made captive forever !" Then betraying for
the first time his intentions, the young prince said: "Let
us turn back, I must think how to accomphsh deliver
ance."
A last meeting put an end to his hesitation. He was
driving through the northern gate, on the way to his
pleasure-gardens, when he saw a mendicant, who appeared outwardly calm, subdued, looking downwards,
wearing with an air of dignity his religious vestment, and
carrying an alms-bowl.
" Who is this man ?" asked the prince.
"Sir," replied the coachman, "this man is one of those
who are called bhikshus, or mendicants. He has re
nounced all pleasures, all desires, and leads a life of
austerity. He tries to conquer himself. He has become
a devotee. Without passion, without envy, he walks about asking for alms."
"This is good and well said," replied the prince; "the
life of a devotee has always been praised by the wise. It
will be my refuge, and the refuge of other creatures ; it
will lead us to a real life, to happiness and immortality."
With these words, the young prince turned his chariot
and abandoning his proposed ride returned to the city.
THE GREAT RENUNCIATION.
We now come to a most touching incident in Gautama's life. Moved by the visions of which we have just
spoken, Gautama determines to seek the solitude of the
hermit's hut. His life had been full of intense yearning
which had never been satisfied. Not all the comfort and
prosperity about him could drive away his desire to ob
tain peace. To him, life was a great enigma, and he de
termined to solve it. He was not dissatisfied, but, rather,
unsatisfied. His determination to retire from active life



BUDDHA, THE "LIGHT OF ASIA." 505
was, however, by no means easy. For his wife and his
only son, Rahula, he felt the warmest affection. It was
to be a difficult task to break these ties.
At midnight, he summoned his charioteer, Channa, to
bring- his horse to the palace gate. While Channa was
gone to the stable, Gautama turned back to take a last
look at his wife and child. The princess lay asleep upon
her couch, surrounded with flowers, and her hand was
embracing her little one. Gautama saw that he could
not take the child up in his arms without disturbing the
mother, and he was afraid that she might succeed in
shaking his resolution, did she plead with him.
" So with his brow he touched her feet, and bent The farewell of fond eyes, unutterable
Upon her sleeping face, still wet with tears
;
And thrice around the bed in reverence, As though it were an altar, softly stepped With clasped hands laid upon his beating heart, ' For never,' spake he, ' lie I there again !' And thrice he made to go, but thrice came back, So strong her beauty was, so large his love : Then, o'er his head drawing his cloth, he turned, And raised the purdah's edge :
"Then, lightly treading where those sleepers lay,
Into the night Siddartha passed : its eyes, The watchful stars, looked love on him ; its breath. The wandering wind, kissed his robe's fluttered fringe
;
The garden-blossoms, folded for the dawn. Opened their velvet hearts to waft him scents, From pink and purple censers; o'er the land, From Himalaya unto the Indian Sea, A tremor spread, as if earth's soul beneath Stirred with an unknown hope ; and holy books

That rich celestial music thrilled the air From hosts on hosts of shining ones, who thronged Eastward and westward, making bright the night

Northward and southward, making glad the grounds Also those four dread Regents of the Earth, Descending at the doorway, two by two

With their bright legions of Invisibles
In arms of sapphire, silver, gold and pearl

Watched with joined hands the Indian Prince, who stood,.
His tearful eyes raised to the stars, and lips Close-set with purpose of prodigious love. Then strode he forth into the gloom and cried, ' Channa, awake ! and bring out Kantaka !'
"
' What would my lord ?' the charioteer replied

Slow-rising from his place beside the gate

' To ride at night, when all the ways are dark ?'
"
' Speak low,' Siddartha said, ' and bring my horse. For now the hour is come when I should quit This golden prison, where my heart lives caged. To find the truth; which henceforth I will seek, For all men's sake, until the truth be found.' "
Shortly after he had passed through the ponderous
gate of the city—which, it was said, took a thousand
men to open it—he was met by the evil god Mara. Mara knew that if Gautama proceeded, his power would be lessened and so he sought to turn him back. He
said to Gautama : " Be entreated to stay, that you may
possess the honors that are within your reach ; go not
!
go not!" To this Gautama replied: " A thousand or a hundred thousand honors such as those to which you refer would have no power to charm me to-day ; I seek the Buddhaship ; therefore, begone, hinder me not."
Mara left him in great anger, determined to foil him.
GAUTAMA BECOMES AN ASCETIC.
Gautama then exchanged his clothes with a poor
passer-by, cut off his hair, and sent Channa, the charioteer
back and became a begging, homeless hermit. Several,

hermits had taken up their abode in the caves of the Vindhya mountains ; here they were at once surrounded
by the soHtudes of nature and sufficiently near to a large
city to get their supplies. After coming to these caves
he attaches himself to a Brahmin teacher, and under his
guidance seeks, by undergoing severest penances, to gain superhuman power. After a little, he withdraws by
himself to the jungles, where he spends six years in fast
ing and self-mortification. His severity of self-control
gains him great fame, and disciples gather about him. A
fear that, lest after all his efforts should be fruitless and
that he should die, having gone wrong, made him finally
give up the attempt.
Now came the crisis of his life. The second struggle of Gautama was most intense. He wandered back to a
village to get his morning meal. He sat down to eat it
under a tree, known from that day to this as the " Bo-tree," or tree of Wisdom. There he remained through the long
hours of that day, debating with himself what next to do.
The philosophy he had trusted in seemed to be doubtful; the penance he had practiced so long had brought no
certainty, no peace ; and all his old temptations came back upon him with renewed force. For years he had
looked at all earthly good as vanity, worthless and transi
tory. Nay, more, he had thought that it contained within
itself the seeds of evil, and must inevitably, sooner or
later, brinof forth its bitter fruit. But now to his waverine
faith the sweet delights of home and love, the charms of
wealth and power, began to show themselves in a different
light and to glow again with attractive colors. They were
yet within his reach ; he knew he would be welcomed back,
and yet—would there even then be satisfaction ? Were
all his labors to be lost? Was there no sure grfound to
stand on ? Thus he agonized in his doubt from the early



5o8 EA'J^OJ?'S CHAINS.
morning until sunset. But as the day ended the religious
side of his nature had won the victory ; his doubt had cleared away ; he had become a Buddha, that is an En
lightened Otie ; he had grasped, as it seemed to him, the
solution of the great mystery of sorrow, and had learned
at once its causes and its cure. He seemed to have
gained the haven of peace, and in the power over the
human heart of inward culture, and of love to others, to
rest at last on a certitude that could never be shaken.
He renounced his penances, and from that time declared that no good resulted from them. It was a grand theory
of selfsalvation that he had wrought out for himself

salvation by self-control and love—without any rites,
ceremonies, charming priestly powers, without even the
aid of the gods, man could save himself.
Like the later great reformer, Mohammed, Gautama the
Buddha, had the most perfect confidence in himself, his
convictions and his mission ; this mission was " to set
rolling the royal chariot-wheel of a universal empire of
truth and righteousness." He went to Benares, and there, by teaching, sought to spread the knowledge of
bis method of reaching a perfect inward peace. In about
three months he had gathered together sixty disciples
;
these he sends forth to preach his faith. He himself was accustomed to travel, preach and teach, except during
the four rainy months, from June to October, when he
remained in one place, instructing his declared disciples.
Once he visited his old home, and his wife, Yasodhara,
became one of his disciples ; she was the first of the
Buddhist nuns. Gautama died at the age of eighty years. His body was burned with much pomp, and his disciples contended for the unburned bones. They were
divided in eight parts, and temple-mounds, called topes,
were built over each.



BUDDHA, THE "LIGHT OF ASIA." 509
THE "LIGHT OF ASIA " AND THE "LIGHT OF THE WORLD."
One cannot help comparing Gautama, the Buddha, and
Jesus, the Christ. There is, beyond question, a great
deal of both good and evil in Buddha's life and teaching.
IDOL OF BUDDHA. HIS IDOLS ARE USUALLY OF THIS SHAPE, PROPORTION
AND POSITION, THOUGH INFINITELY VARIED IN SIZE AND QUALITY.
It is wise for us to recognize both good and evil, and to
"hold fast to that which is good." We do not think that
it is placing Buddha on too high a ground when we say



5'0 jEA'A'OA' S CHAINS.
that he stands nearest to Christ of all the founders of reli
gions. We must not confound the teachings of Buddha
with the superstitious notions of his followers of to-day.
The present Buddhism of Asia is but little like the Bud
dhism of Gautama's teaching. Further, we must strip off
the legends, the additions of a later day, and seek to read
the story of his life that lies beneath them. In addition
to this, we must try to place ourselves in closest sym
pathy with our subject.
Thus we see the beauties of this life. Looked at in this
way, we discover a great deal in Buddha's character to
admire. Saint-Hilaire says (we give a free translation
from the French) : " His life has no stain. His constant
heroism equals his conviction ; and if the theory which he
extols is faultless, the personal example which he pre
sents is irreproachable. He is the finished model of all
the virtues which he preached ; his teaching of self-denial,
of charity, of an unchangeable mildness, do not for a single
instant receive the contradiction of a different life. He
abandons, at the age of twenty-nine years, the court of
his royal father to become a devotee and a mendicant; he
prepares silently his doctrines during six years of medi
tation and retreat ; he extends his faith only by the power
of speech and persuasion, during half a century; and
when he dies in the arms of his disciples, it is with the
serenity of a sage who has lived well, and who is assured
that he has found the truth." It is not our purpose to
compare here the teachings of Buddha and Christ, but
simply the life. It is a comparison that we would make,
and not a contrast. Buddha's self-denial for the world's
good, his wondrously pure life, and the heavenliness of
his manners and of some of his teachings greatly resem
ble those of Jesus Christ. Yet, after all, he stands a long
>vay off. He is a light, it is true, yet but feebly shining



BUDDHA, THE "LIGHT OF ASIAr rjj
beside the light of the Sun of Righteousness. To Christ,
Gautama is but
"As moonlight is to sunlight, and as water is to wine."
The Buddha was the son of a king ; Jesus, the Christ,
was the son of a carpenter. The Buddha grew up in the
midst of the splendors of a court; Jesus, the Christ, was
reared in a despised city, in an humble home. Yet the
aspect of the Buddha is that of a disciple, a learner, an
inquirer ; that of the Christ is that of a master, a teacher.
The Buddha seems rather to be a subject, and the Christ
the king. The Buddha approaches the solution of the great problems of sin, suffering and death from below.
He walks as one in a maze, with uncertain steps ; he
tries experiments ; he goes from one teacher to another.
Finally, of a sudden, comes the answer to the problems
with which he has been puzzled ; he throws the spectre
with which he has been grappling. The Christ approaches the great and grave questions, that have been
puzzling the world, as one who has the answers in his
possession. He comes to teach, and not to learn ; to
settle, and not to disturb. There is no hesitating uncer
tainty about His words or steps as there is about the
Buddha's. In meeting temptation, the Buddha shows
weakness, where the Christ shows strength. The Bud
dha's life was long ; the Christ's was short. The Bud
dha gave, undoubtedly, many wholesome precepts; but
there is an element of kindly, self-forgetting love about
the Christ's teachings that is absent from the Buddha's.
Indeed, this is the emphatic point of superiority, that the
Buddha kept constantly before his disciples /,^^'r welfare ;
he taught how a man might deliver himself from suffer
ing. The Christ makes self-salvation but a part of His
fldisciples' work. The Buddha has next to nothing to say



rjo JiJiA-OM'S CHAINS.
about God; the Christ lias all to say about God. The
Christ seeks to show how man's life is attached to God
at every point ; he exhibits the true character of God,
presenting a picture infinitely superior to that drawn by
the hand of any of the founders of religions, or by the
highest imaginations of the purest men. In brief, the
Buddha's life and teachings were unquestionably good,
but the Christ's unquestionably better. This will be more
apparent as, in the following chapters, we study the work
inof out of the Buddha's teaching-s. We shall see how
oo much and how little they benefited the race. Let the
test of time be applied to the answers he brought to the
puzzling problems of sin, suffering and sorrow, and see if they have wrought out the good for which the Buddha
looked, hoped and prayed. We shall see a partial suc
cess and a partial failure, and see the undoubted neces
sity of giving the knowledge of the Gospel to the nations who have known nothing better than that which Buddha.
had to tell.



THE BUDDHIST BIBLE. e j -,
CHAPTER XXVII.
THE BUDDHIST BIBLE, THE " THREE BASKETS," AND ITS
TEACHINGS.
There is that in Buddhism, intelligible to the poor and the suffering,
which has endeared Buddhism to the hearts of millions , not the silly,, metaphysical phantasmagorias of worlds of gods and worlds of Brahma, or final dissolution of the soul '\A Nirvana. No, the beautiful, the tender, the humanly true, which, like pure gold, lies buried
in all religions, even in the sand of the Buddhist canon. —F. Max MOller.
GAUTAMA had himself thoroughly worked out
his system of religion. With regard to his teach
ings, we have more reliable information than in
regard to his life. During his fifty years of teaching he
had ample time to repeat over and over again to his dis
ciples the principles of his faith. In the interval between
Buddha's death and the reign of the Buddhist king,
Asoka (in 307 B. C), legends and stories of miraculous
deeds multiplied about the narrative of Buddha's life. Gautama Buddha's teachinsfs were committed to writing' and commentaries were written upon these. To deter
mine what were the genuine Buddhist sacred books, and what were apocryphal, a council was called by King Asoka.
This king was to the Buddhists what Constantine the
Great was to the early Christian Church. King Asoka
said to the assembled priests, " what has been said by
Buddha, that alone is well said." The canon of sacred
books, as declared by this council, include the collection



-1^ ERKOR'S a/A INS.
called the Tripitaka, or " Three Baskets." These are to Buddhism what the New Testament is to Christianity;
in these we find the orthodox belief. The first of these
baskets is called the Vinaya, and contains all of Buddha's
teachings that refer to morality; the second is called
the Sutras, containing the sermons of Buddha; the third
is called the Abhidharma, containing all that treats of philosophy and metaphysics. The general name, Dharma,
or "law," is applied to the second and third Pitakas, or
baskets. The first and second baskets each contain five
separate works, and the third basket seven. In addition
to these books the Buddhists look upon the commentaries and parables of the famous Buddhist missionary, Buddhaghosha, as of nearly equal value. These were
written about 430 A. D. Still further, we have the work
called the Dharma Pada, or "Footsteps of the Law." This is a book of Buddhist's morals, and Spence Hardy,
one oi the best writers on Buddhism, says that a collec
tion of precepts might be made from this \\ ork, which in
purity of morals could hardly be equaled by any heathen
author. We now give a summary of Buddha's teachings
on the more important topics as found in the Tripitakas.
THE BUDDHIST WAY OF SALVATION.
The method of salvation which was wrought out by Buddha has been admirably summarized by Rhys-David
as follows: "So long as man is bound up by bodily ex
istence with the material world he is liable to sorrow,
decay and death. So long as he allows unholy desires
to reign within him, there will be unsatisfied longings,
useless weariness and care. To attempt to purify him
self by oppressing his body would be only wasted effort; it is the moral evil of a man's heart which keeps him
chained down in the degraded state of bodily life—of



THE BUDDHIST BTBLE. t\c
union with the material world. It is of little avail to add
virtue to his badness, for so long as there is evil, his
goodness will only insure him for a time, and in another
birth, a higher form of material life ; only the complete
eradication of all evil will set him free from the chains of
existence and carry him to the 'other side,' where he will be
no longfer tossed about on the waves of the ocean of trans
migration. But Christian ideas must not be put into
these Buddhist expressions. Of any immaterial exist
ence, Buddhism knows nothing. The foundations of its creed have been summed up in the very ancient formula
probably invented by its founder, which is called the Four
Great Truths. These are : i. That misery always ac
companies existence. 2. That all modes of existence (of
men or animals, in earth and heaven) result from passion
or desire (tantra). 3. That there is no escape from ex
istence except by destruction of desire. 4. That this
may be had by following the fourfold way to Nirvana.
"Of these four prescribed stages called ' the Paths' the
first is an awakening of the heart. There are few that
do not acknowledge that no man can be really called
happy, and that men are born to trouble as the sparks
fly upward, but the majority glide through life filling up
their time with business or with pleasure, buoyed up
with ever-changing hopes in their mad pursuit of some
fancied good. When the scales fall from their eyes,
when they begin to realize the great mystery of so7'row,
that pain is inseparable from existence, and that all
earthly good leads to vexation of spirit, when they turn for comfort and for guidance to the Enlightened One, then they maybe said to be awake, and to have entered the
first stage of the Buddhist way of salvation. When the
awakened believer has gone further, and got rid, first,
of all impure desires, and then of all revengefulfeelings, he



510 ERROR'S CHAINS.
has reached the second stage; in the third he successively
becomes free (i) ixova all evil desires, (2) from ignorance,
(3) from doubt, (4) from heresy, and (5) from unkindliness
and vexation. 'As even at the risk of her own Hfe a
mother watches over her child, her only child, so let him
(the Buddhist saint) exert good-will without measure
toward all beings.'
"
The order here observed is very remarkable. The way to be freed from doubt and heresy lies through free
dom from impurity and revenge, and evil longings of all
kinds ; or, in other words, if a man awakened to a deep
sense of the mystery of sorrow wishes to understand the
real facts of existence, wishes to believe not the false or
the partly false, but the true altogether, Buddha tells him
not to set to work and study, not to torture himself with
asceticism or privation, but to purify his mind from all
unholy desires and passions : right actions spring from a
pure mind, and to the pure in heart all things are open. Again, the first enemy which the awakened believer has
to fight against is sensuality, and the last is unkindliness.
It is impossible to build anything on a foundation of mire
;
and the topstone of all that one can build, the highest
point he can reach, the point above purity, above justice,
above even faith, is, according to Buddha, 7iniversal
charity. Till he has gained that, the believer is still
bound ; he is not free ; his mind is still dark. True en
lightenment, true freedom, are complete only in love.
The believer who has gone thus far has reached the
last stage ; he has cut the meshes of ignorance, passion
and sin, and has thus escaped from the net of transmi
gration ; Nirvana is already within his grasp ; he has
risen above the laws of material existence ; the secrets
of the future and the past lie open before him ; and when
this one short life is over, he will be free forever from



THE BUDDHIST BIBLE. c i 7
birth with its inevitable consequences, decay and death.
No Buddhist now hopes to reach this stage on earth;
but he who has once entered the " paths " cannot leave
them ; the final perseverance of the saints is sure ; and
sooner or later, under easier conditions in some less
material world, he will win the great prize, and, entering
Nirvana, be at rest forever with other triumphant victors.
WHAT IS NIRVANA ?
The central doctrine of Buddhism, the goal of all its
hopes, the end of all its struggles, is Nirvana or Nigban.
But what does this mean ? Some learned men say, ab
sorption or swallowing up into the Deity ; others, that it
means a perfect annihilation, a ceasing to be or exist
;
while still others say that it simply means reaching a
state of perfect inward rest. Nirvana means, literally,
" a blowing out," as of a candle. We cannot conceive it
possible that any one could teach the hopeless, despair
ing doctrine of annihilation, and cannot help believing
that the last interpretation is the true one—that Nirvana
means a perfect, inward peace. Certain it is that Bud
dha's followers of to-day believe in a definitely located
Paradise, a place of perfect enjoyment. Nirvana is an
extinction, but of what? Of the life of the soul? or of
the passions, of selfishness, desire and sin ? and of the
unrest produced by these ? Nirvana is called the highest
happiness. As Max Miiller says, " It represented the
entrance of the soul into rest, a subduing of all wishes
and desires, indifference to joy and pain, to good and
evil, an absorption of the soul in itself and a freedom
from the circles of existences from birth to death, and from
death to a new birth. This is still the meaning which
educated people attach to it, whilst to the minds of the
larger masses. Nirvana suggests rather the idea of a



5i8 ERROR'S CHAINS.
Mohammedan Paradise or of blissful Elysian fields."
Buddha, himself, once said: "Those only who have ar
rived at Nirvana are at rest." Closely associated with
Nirvana is the idea of the transmigration of the soul;
that the soul after death passes from one body to another ; sometimes the body in which the soul is born
again is that of an animal, sometimes of a man. The
Buddhists kill no animals, for fear of annoying the soul
of a dead man, which may be living in the animal. For
this reason they also take great care of wounded and sick
animals. In Bombay is a hospital for animals, carried on
very successfully by the Jains, a Buddhist sect.
BUDDHIST MORALS.
The wonderfully pure and exalted teachings of Buddha
have been gathered together in the Dharma Pada, or
" Footsteps of the Law." Many of them greatly re
semble the teachings of our Holy Scriptures, others are
absurdly ridiculous, while still others are metaphysical
abstractions, and are wholly meaningless. The great majority are, however, full of wondrous wisdom. The fol
lowing selections are translations from the Pali language
SOME OF THE " FOOTSTEPS OF THE LAW."
There is no fire like passion ; there is no shark like
hatred; there is no snare like folly; there is no torrent
like greed. A man is not learned because he talks much. A man is not an elder because his head is gray; his
age may be ripe, but he is called "Old-in-vain."
For hatred does not cease by hatred at any time
;
hatred ceases by love. This is an old rule.
He who lives looking for pleasure only, his senses un
controlled, immoderate in his enjoyments, idle and weak,.



THE BUDDHIST BIBLE. e i g
,
Mara (the tempter) will certainly overcome him, as the wind throws down a weak tree.
He who lives without looking for pleasures, his senses
well controlled, in his enjoyments moderate, faithful and
strong, Mara will certainly not overcome him, any more than the wind throws down a rocky mountain.
As rain breaks through an ill-thatched house, passion,
will break throuo-h an unreflectinsf mind.
The evil-doer suffers in this world, and he suffers in
the next ; he suffers in both. He suffers when he thinks
of the evil he has done ; he suffers more when going on
the evil path.
The virtuous man is happy in this world, and he is
happy in the next ; he is happy in both. He is happy
when he thinks of the good he has done ; he is still more happy when going on the good path.
The scent of flowers does not travel against the wind,
nor (that of) sandal-wood, or of a bottle of Tagara oil
;
but the odor of good people travels even against the wind ; a good man pervades every place.
As on a heap of rubbish cast upon the highway the
lily will grow full of sweet perfume and delightful, thus
the disciple of the truly enlightened Buddha shines forth
by his knowledge among those who are like rubbish,,
among the people that walk in darkness.
The fool who knows his foolishness, is wise at least sc
far. But a fool who thinks himself wise, he is called a
fool indeed. The gods even envy him whose senses have been sub
dued, like horses well broken in by the driver, who is
free from pride, and free from frailty.
Even though a speech be a thousand (of words) but
made up of senseless words, one word of sense is better,,
which if a man hears, he becomes quiet.



-20 ERROR'S CHAINS.
If one man conquer in battle a thousand times thousand
men, and if another conquer himself, he is the greatest
of conquerors.
Let no man think lightly of evil, saying in his heart. It
will not come near unto me. Even by the falling of
water-drops a water-pot is filled. The fool becomes full of
evil, even if he gathers it little by little.
Let no one forget his own duty for the sake of an
other's, however great. Let a man, after he has discerned
his own duty, be always attentive to his duty.
The wise who control their body, who control their
tongue, the wise who control their mind, are indeed well
controlled.
And the man who gives himself to drinking intoxicating
liquors, he, even in this world, digs up his own root.
Akin to these are the followinaf blessings of Buddha:
BUDDHIST BEATITUDES.
One of the gods says to Gautama: 1. Many angels and men Have held various things blessings, When they were yearning for happiness. Do thou declare to us the chief good.
•Gautama answers:
2. Not to serve the foolish,
But to serve the wise ; To honor those worthy of honor : This is the greatest blessing.
3 To dwell in a pleasant land, Good works done in a former birth, Right desires in the heart
:
This is the greatest blessing.
4. Much insight and education, Self control and pleasant speech. And whatever word be well-spoken : This is the greatest blessing.

5. To support father and mother, To cherish wife and child, To follow a peaceful calling:

7. To abhor and cease from sin, Abstinence from strong drink, Not to be weary in well-doing :
These are the greatest blessings.
S. Reverence and lowliness. Contentment and gratitude, The hearing of the Law at due seasons: This is the greatest blessing.
9. To be long-suffering and meek, To associate with the tranquil (?'. f., Buddhist monks), Religious talk at due seasons : This is the greatest blessing.
10. Self-restraint and purity. The knowledge of the Noble Truths, The realization of Nirvana:
This is the greatest blessing.
11. Beneath the stroke of life's changes. The mind that shaketh not
;
Without grief or passion, and secure :
This is the greatest blessing.

They who do acts like these, On every side they walk in safety,
And theirs is the greatest blessing.

THE GROWTH OF BUDDHISM THE BUDDHIST ORDER OF MENDICANTS.
What proud Emperors Carved his sweet words upon the rocks and caves
;
And how—in fullness of the times — it fell The Buddha died, the great Tathagato, Even as a man 'mongst men, fulfilling all
:
And how a thousand thousand crores* since then Have trod the Path which leads whither he went Unto Nirvana where the Silence lives. Edwin Arnold, in the " Light of Asia."
BUDDHISM is a missionary system. It has spread
far beyond the land of its birth, all over Asia.
The methods of its spread were entirely different from those of Mohammedanism, while they somewhat resembled those of Christianity. To-day Buddhism
numbers about two-fifths of the world's population among
its adherents. It is still in vigorous life. It has been
propagated mainly through the Sangha, or Buddhist
Order of Mendicants. The dates usually assigned for
the entrance of Buddhism into other lands are as fol
lows: Into Ceylon, 250 B. C. ; into China, 65 A. D. ; into
Corea, 372 A. D. ; into Burmah, 450 A. D. ; into Japan,
552 A. D. ; into Thibet, about 625 A. D. ; and into Siam, 638 A. D. While some of these have been ques
tioned, no good reason has yet been given for accepting
any others.
* A crore is 10,000,000; a thousand thousand crores would be 10 million millions.



THE GROWTH OF BUDDHISM. 523
We shall at present discuss the character and consti
tution of the Buddhist brotherhood of the Sangha, leav
ing the stories of the introduction of Buddhism into the
various countries to be told in their respective places.
THE SANGHA, OR BUDDHIST BROTHERHOOD.
All of Buddha's disciples who had taken the vows of asceticism were known by the name of Sangha, meaning
"congregation" or "church." The organization of this
order had the most to do with the spread of Buddhism.
Keep in mind that, in common with almost all reformers,
Gautama, the Buddha, did not intend to cut loose from
his old faith. He hoped to make the new wine of his
teachincjs g-o into the old bottles of Brahminism. We
believe that he did not intend or expect that his religion
should spread over Asia. Further, it was not so much
due to his doctrine of the Dharma, or "law," that his re
ligion gained so wide an acceptance, as it was due to his
establishment of the order of the Sangha. Here is one
point of wide divergence from the missionary labors of
Christianity. Its founder, Jesus Christ, did intend, and
distinctly stated His intention of giving His religion to the
world. The order of the Sangha was a growth. Little
by little, as occasion demanded, Gautama laid down rules
for those who would be his disciples, and unconsciously
these disciples became more and more exclusive, shut
ting in themselves and shutting out all others. Finally,
after Gautama's death, they became a distinct body.
THE INITIATION CEREMONY.
Any one who was free from contagious disease, who
was neither a slave, a debtor nor a soldier, and who had
obtained the consent of his parents, might be admitted to
the order. The following account of the ceremony of



C2A SXJiOJi'S CHAINS.
admission has been compiled by T. W. Rhys-David, late
of the Ceylon civil service
:
" The layman who wishes for entrance to the Order
must be at least eight years old before obtaining the
novitiate, and at least twenty before receiving full ordi
nation. On the day appointed, a chapter is held, of not
less than ten monks, the president being of at least ten
years' standing. The monks forming the chapter sit on
mats, in two rows, lacing each other, the president being
at the head of one row. The candidate, in lay dress, but
carrying the three yellow robes of a mendicant, is intro
duced by his proposer (always a monk), makes a saluta
tion to the president, and offers him a small present as a
token of respect. He then three times asks for admis
sion as a novice. ' Have pity on me, lord ; take these
robes, and let me be ordained, that I may escape from
sorrow and experience Nirvana.' The president then
takes the bundle of robes, and ties them around the can
didate's neck, repeating, meanwhile, a formula of medita
tion on the perishable nature of the human body. The
candidate then retires, and changes his dress, repeating
the while a formula to the effect that, though he wears
robes, he does so only out of modest)', and as a protec
tion from heat, cold, etc. When he reappears clad as a
mendicant, he kneels before the president, and repeats
after him three times two well-known Buddhist formulas.
The first of these is that called the ' Three Refuges.'
"
' I go for refuge to the Buddha.
"
' I p"0 for refugfe to the Law.
" 'I cro for refucre to the Order.'
" The other is called the ' Ten Precepts,' which are as
follows
:
"
' I . I take the vow not to destroy life.
"
' 2. I take the vow not to steal.



THE GROWTH OF BUDDHISM. ^2^
"
' 3. I take the vow to abstain from impurity.
"
' 4. I take the vow not to lie.
"
' 5. I take the vow to abstain from intoxicating drinks,
which hinder progress and virtue.
"
' 6. I take the vow not to eat at forbidden times.
"
' 7. I take the vow to abstain from dancing, singing,
music and stage-plays.
"
' 8. I take the vow not to use garlands, scents, un
guents or ornaments.
"
' 9. I take the vow not to use a high or broad bed.
"
' 10. I take the vow not to receive gold or silver.'
" The candidate then rises, pays respect to the presi
dent, and retires a novice. Here, for the novitiate, the
ceremony ends."
RULES OF THE ORDER.
Solid food is forbidden, except between sunrise and
noon, and total abstinence from intoxicating drinks is re
quired. The monks, or brothers of the order, usually get their food by begging from door to door ; each usually carries his brown earthenware begging-bowl. He
says nothing, but only stands, waiting, at the open door of the hut. if something is given him, he mutters a prayer
for the giver, but if nothing, he passes on in silence.
The monks generally live together in groves, gardens
or monasteries. At first they led a lonely life, but after
wards they gathered together in communities. They
were required to dress in simple garments of a dull
orange color, first torn in pieces and then sewn together
again, so that they had no salable value. They wear
three robes ; and, while the people of the warmer coun
tries wear only the loin-cloth, the members of the order
were required to keep their bodies covered. To " put
off the robes " was equivalent to leaving the society.



526 ERROR'S CHAINS.
Personal indulgence, theft and murder would cause the monk who committed them to be expelled from the or
der. No monk was allowed to possess more than eight
articles—the three robes, a girdle for the loins, a begging
bowl, a razor, a needle and a water-strainer. The com
munities of monks, however, were permitted to own
property. Unquestioning obedience to superiors is never
required of a monk among the Buddhists.
DAILY LIFE OF A MONK.
According to the " Manual of Exercises," the daily life
of a monk should be as follows : He shall rise before
daylight and wash; then sweep the wihara or residence

as the clean little hut where the mendicant lives is
called—then sweep round the Bo-tree, fetch the drinking
water for the day, filter it, and place it ready for use.
Retiring to a solitary place, he shall then meditate on the
regulations. Then he shall offer flowers before the
sacred dagaba—the solid dome-shaped shrine in which
relics of the Buddha are buried— or before the Bo-tree,
thinking of the great virtues of the Teacher and of his
own faults. Soon after, taking the begging-bowl, he is
to follow his superior in his daily round for food, and, on
their return, is to bring water for his feet and place the
alms-bowl before him. After the meal is over, he is to
wash the alms-bowl, then again to worship Buddha and meditate on kindness and affection. About an hour
afterwards, he is to begin his studies from the books, or
copy one of them, asking his superior about passages he
does not understand. At sunset, he is again to sweep
the sacred places, and, lighting a lamp, to listen to the
teaching of his superior, and repeat such passages from
the canon that he has learned. If he finds he has com
mitted any fault, he is to tell his superior ; he is to be



THE GROWTH OF BUDDHISM. 527
content with such things as he has, and, keeping under
his senses, to grow in grace without liaughtiness of body,
speech or mind.
THE THREE GREAT BUDDHIST COUNCILS.
Soon after Buddha's death a council of 500 members
of the order was held in a cave, near the city of Raja
ofriha. This council met to form Buddha's teachings into
some sort of a system. A second council of 700 was
held a hundred years later. This was to effect a settle
ment between certain heretics and the orthodox party.
The Rules of the Order and the Doctrines of the Faith
were passed in review and again settled. Then the
heretics advanced still different opinions and called an
opposition council. This was the first great schism.
From this time sects multiplied among the Buddhists.
The next council was the Great Council of King Asoka. Asoka was to the Buddhist Order what Constantine was
to the early Christian Church. There are more men to
honor him to-day than there are to honor Charlemagne
or Csesar. Yet Asoka really caused the downfall of Buddhism in India by the aid he gave it. As Dante had
said
:
"Ah! Constantine, of how much ill was cause, Not thy conversion, but those rich domains That the first wealthy Pope received of thee."
Asoka built many monasteries and provided for the
support of many monks. He became a very zealous
supporter of Buddhism. Some of his edicts, based upon Gautama's teachings, have been discovered within the
last fifty years. In the eighteenth year of Asoka's reign,
a great council of 1,000 monks was held in Patna. This
council finally determined the canon of the sacred Bud
dhist books. This council, held, probably, in the year 246



C23 ERROR'S CHAINS.
B. C, lasted nine months. Asoka was filled with an
aggressive, missionary spirit, and at the close of this
council missionaries were sent into various countries, or
provinces of India, from Cashmere to Ceylon. The mis
sion to Ceylon of Asoka's own son, Mahinda, was the
most important. In the year 62 A. D., the Chinese Emperor Ming-Ti sent to India and brought Buddhist books to China. From China Buddhism spread into
Corea and Japan and Thibet. From Ceylon it spread to Burmah and Siam.
Of late years the sources of our information as to
Buddhist teachings and history have greatly changed. Formerly only Ceylon was looked to for this informa
tion, but of late years the work of Bigandet in Burmah,
Alabaster in Siam, Schlagintweit in Thibet, and Beal in China, have given more thorough knowledge of the facts
of Buddhist doctrine and history.
BUDDHAGHOSHA, THE FAMOUS MONK AND MISSIONARY.
Buddhaghosha lived in the middle of the fifth century
after Christ. He is, next to Asoka, the most celebrated
man in Buddhist history. He visited Ceylon, where he
greatly revived the Buddhist faith. He then went to Burmah, where he established Buddhism among the Burmese. From these people it spread into Arracan, Pegu, and finally into Siam. He wrote a famous commentary
on the Buddhist Bible ; some scholars believe that this is but a translation of older commentaries which Buddhaghosha made, and that his parables are but the parables of Mahinda or even of Gautama re-written. At any rate, they go by Buddhaghosha's name among the Bur
mese Buddhists. His parables are very interesting, and
are used by the monks and preachers in all their sermons. The accompanying story of King Kakavanna is quoted



THE GROWTH OF BUDDHISM. r2g.
from Captain Rogers' translation of Buddhaghosha's
Parables, and will serve as a fair specimen of the stories
as a whole.
THE STORY OF KING KAKAVANNA.
A Rahanda once preached the Law to Kakavanna, his
queen and concubines, in the island of Ceylon. King
Kakavanna, filled with love for the Law, resolved to
make an offering of the putzo which he was wearing. In
a spirit of niggardliness, however, he thought he would
defer the offering until the next day. Two crows, a husband and wife, who were perched upon the tree at the foot of which the Law had been preached, knowing
what was passing in the king's mind, said to each other
:
" The king, from his niggardly spirit, excellent as the Law
is, cannot make up his mind to make an offering of the
putzo." Neither the queen, nor the concubines, nor the nobles understood what the two crows were saying to
each other ; but the king, directly he heard the sound of
the crows, knew what they said. " O you pair of crows," he exclaimed, " how dare you speak so of a king like me?"
The crows replied, " Your majesty, do not take the putzo
you have at home, but make an offering of the one you
are wearing, worth a hundred thousand pieces of gold.
In seven days hence you will receive the five rewards."
The king smiled at the crows' speech. My lord, the
Rahanda, who had been preaching the Law, said to the king, "Why does your majesty smile at me?" "I was
not smiling at my lord Rahanda," replied the king ; " I was smiling at what the two crows said." The Rahanda,
who possessed the Nat's eye, which could behold eight
past and eight future existences, and who saw the pre
vious life of the king, said to him, " Great king, I will tell
you something ; will you be angry with me ?" " My lord,"



i-,o ERROR'S CHAINS.
replied the king, " I shall not be angry with you ; deign
to tell it to me." My lord, the Rahanda, proceeded
:
"When your majesty was a poor man in the Anuradha
country, you used to collect firewood, and live by the sale
of it. One day, when you went out to your work, you
took with you a small cupful of boiled rice. Coming
across a heap of white sand which looked like sheet-silver,
you reflected that your poverty must have been occa
sioned by your not possessing the merit of having made
offerings, and accordingly you raised a pagoda of the
white sand, placed in front of it, as an offering, one-half
of the rice you had with you, and gave the remaining
half to the crows to eat, as an offering to the Rahans. These two crows, husband and wife, are the very same two crows who ate the rice of which you made the offering when you were a poor man." When the king heard
this, he exclaimed, " Oh, how unstable is prosperity ! I
have obtained the position of king only from making
offerings at a sand pagoda !" So saying, he made an
offering to the Law of the putzo he was wearing.
Seven days afterwards, the five rewards came to the
king. The five rewards were these :
The Nats, wrapping up in a thingan the relics of an excellent Rahanda who had obtained Paranibbana while
he was up in the sky, and which were like a jasmine-bud,
came and laid them down before the king. In front of
his palace a mountain of gold arose. The Nats brought
a virgin from the island of Uttarakuru. This woman was
ten cubits in stature. She brought with her a kunsa of rice, which, though one were to cook it and eat it during
a whole lifetime, would never be exhausted. An elephant
of priceless value, which could travel a hundred yoganas
even before breakfast. Seven vessels arrived at the
port completely ^lled with valuable putzos.



THE CR WTH OF B UDDHISM. r , j
BUDDHIST COUNTRIES OF THE PRESENT DAY.
Buddhism in India has almost died out. In Ceylon,
and among the sect of the Jains, in Western India, it still
remains ; but, excepting these parts of the country, Brahminism has triumphed in putting down Buddhism.
In Farther India, that is, in Burmah and Malacca, Buddhism is very strong. Among the Karens of Burmah, Buddhism never gained any acceptance. In Siam, Cambodia and Cochin China, Buddhism is prevalent. In China proper and in Corea it is associated with Confu
cianism and Taoism. In Thibet it has taken the peculiar
form called Lamaism, a regular hierarchy having devel
oped. In Japan it is often associated with Shintoism.
The Loo Choo Islands are also Buddhist.

They sat in silent watchfulness The sacred cypress-tree about, And, from beneath old wrinkled brows, Their failing eyes looked out.

IN the time of Asoka, Buddhism had almost become
the State rehgion of India. The conversion of the
king, however, proved the beginning of its decline.
It continued to exist until the eighth or ninth century
after Christ. To-day there is scarcely a trace of the re
ligion among ail the people of India proper. The only
body of people in India that has any connection with
Buddhism is the singular sect of the Jains. The views of
this body are half Buddhist and half Brahmin. They are
found especially on the Western coast of India, in and
around the city of Bombay. They are divided into two
classes, the Soetambaras, or "clothed in white garments," and the Digambaras, or "sky-clad," that is naked. The
last class now wear colored garments, though formerly
they went naked. Like the Buddhists they reject the
Vedas or sacred books of the Brahmins. The principal
point of their practice is the reverence paid to holy men,

who, by long discipline, have raised themselves to divine
perfection. These men are called Jinas or "conquering
saints," whence comes the name of their followers, the
Jains. They believe in two ever-returning cycles of
time, of immense duration, which defy all human calcula
tion. The first Jina of the second cycle, in which we now
live, attained the age of 8,400,000 years, and each Jina
since has lived a shorter and shorter time. There are
three ways, they say, by which the soul is delivered, viz.:
riofht intuition, riaht knowledge and rieht conduct. This
last consists in observing five duties, or vows of self
restraint. I. Do not kill or injure. (Strict Jains carry
this to a ridiculous extent. They strain water before
drinking it, sweep the ground with a brush before treading
it, never eat or drink in the dark, and sometimes wear a
muslin strip over their mouths to prevent the risk of
swallowing minute insects. They will never eat figs or
any fruit containing seeds, nor even touch flesh-meat
with their finger-tips). 2. Do not tell lies. 3. Do not
steal. 4. Be chaste and temperate in thought, word or deed. 5. Do not desire anything immoderately.
In Bombay there is a hospital temple of the Jains where
sick animals are received and cared for. In this temple
one may see oxen, some with bandages over their eyes, and some lame lying upon beds of clean straw ; others,
blind and paralyzed, are having their food brought to them and are being rubbed down by pious devotees. Here are gathered sick or wounded dogs, cats, fowls of
every sort, crows, buzzards, vultures, rats, mice, sparrows,
peacocks, jackals, etc., and are tenderly cared for.
THE FAMOUS TOPES.
A Tope is a structure built to contain some relic of
Buddha. They were generally erected by a king, who



536 ERROR'S CHAINS.
used the following form of words in its dedication:
" Thrice over do I dedicate my kingdom to the redeemer
of the world, the divine teacher, the bearer of the triple
canopy, the canopy of the heavenly host, the canopy of
mortals, and the canopy of eternal emancipation." The whole structure was dome-shaped, or, more exactly,
canopy-shaped. The relic of Buddha—a tooth, a piece
of bone, or the like —was placed in a gold casket. This
was placed in the relic-chamber on a golden altar. Then
the erection of the building proceeded amidst gfreat re
joicings and with many ceremonies. At its completion the king guided a golden plow, drawn by two ele
phants, and marked out thus with a furrow a line all
around the Tope. All within this line was considered
sacred ground. The most famous Topes are those at Sanchi. These are now in ruins. The Topes themselves are all grass-grown and crumbling, and almost all
of the magnificent gate-ways lie in ruins. As we have
just said, the purpose of these Topes was—not for use as
a temple or as a place of living for the Buddhist monks

but simply as a place in which to preserve relics of the
dead Buddha. As Byron, in Childe Harold, has sung:
"There is a stern round tower of other days, Firm as a fortress with its fence of stone

forty- two feet high from the base; the base is fourteen
feet high, giving a total height of fifty-six feet. The base
is a terrace, extending all around
the Tope. On this the worshipers
walked. A colonnade extended all around the Tope. There is an
extrance to the Tope at each of the
four cardinal points. These four
gate-ways are very picturesque ob
jects. They are covered with
sculptures representing various do
mestic scenes and religious cere
monies. Each gate-way is formed
of two square pillars, two feet
three inches thick and thirteen feet
eight inches high. The capitals of
these pillars vary. Those of the
western gate contain four human
dwarfs ; of the southern gate, four
lions ; and of the other gate-ways
four elephants. The height of
these capitals is four feet six
inches. The carvings on these
gate-ways represent sieges, triumphal processions, worshiping
Topes, or the sacred Bo-tree, pro
cessions escorting relic-caskets, and
certain domestic scenes. These
carvings are not surpassed, in the
beauty of their design and execu
tion, by those of any other tem
ples in the world.
Exactly in the centre of the second Sanchi Tope, there was a small chamber. This was opened by Major Alex

under Cunningham, an Englishman, in 1851. He found
in this cliamber a relic-box, of white sand-stone, nearly one
foot square. On it was inscribed :
" Teacher o. all branches of Vinaya, the Arhat* Kasyapa, Gotra, Upadiyajf and the Arhat* Vachhi Suvijayata, teacher of Vinaya."
Inside the stone box were found four small caskets of
mottled steatite. Each one of these contained small
pieces of burnt bone, and on each casket was written the name of the holy man whose ashes were enshrined
therein. As these holy men, whose names are given, are known to have lived in Asoka's time, it is almost
certain that these Topes, containing their relics, were
built not long after their death, or not later than, say,
220 B. C. There are other Topes at Sonari and Sadthara, at Bhojpur and Andher. These were all used as
relic structures, like the pagodas of Burmah.
CEYLONESE BUDDHISM.
King Asoka was not content with spreading Buddhism
in his own territory. He built hospitals for man and
beast, dug- wells and planted trees by the roadsides, and performed many other good works in other lands. These
lands are described in the old Buddhist chronicles of
Ceylon as being Southern India and Ceylon, and "to the
land of the Greek king, Antiochus." He is said to have
sent embassies to four Greek kings, and to have " won
from them a victory, not by the sword, but by religion."
The most important of all Asoka's missionary enter
prises was that which he sent to Ceylon. "Tissa, the de
light of the gods," was at this time king of Ceylon. To
him, Asoka's own son, Mahinda, was sent as a Buddhist

copies of the Tripitakas, the Buddhist Bible, which had
just been adopted by the Patna council. He took also
copies of the commentaries upon these.



546 £A-MOIL'S CHAINS.
Tissa received Mahinda with great favor, and soon
became a zealous worker in the new religion. At Ma
hinda's suggestion, Tissa built the Thuparama Dagaba
in the city of Anuradha-pura. This relic-house was said
to have contained the right collar-bone of Gautama Bud
dha. Near the Dagaba the king built a beautiful monas
tery. On this hill the missionary Mahinda spent most of
his after life. He had his study cut out of the solid rock,
and steps cut in the rock. Before his view spread out
the great plains and beautiful forests of Ceylon. Within
the cave there still exists the stone couch on which he
rested. In this lonely, cool and quiet rock-chamber, the
great teacher of Ceylon sat, thought, wrote, more than
2,000 years ago. Mahinda's sister came over shortly
after her brother, to instruct some of the kine's female
relations, who wished to become nuns. She brought
with her a branch of the sacred Bo-tree, the tree under which Gautama Buddha had fought and won the battle of his life, and where he gained the Buddha-hood.
THE SACRED BO-TREE OF CEYLON.
This branch was planted near the Dagaba, and, as it
has always been tended with great care, it still grows
there. This Is the tree upon which Whittier has founded
his poem, "The Cypress-tree of Ceylon;" of which Ibn
Batuta, the celebrated Mussulman traveler of the four
teenth century, has spoken. " It was," says Ibn Batuta,
" held sacred by the natives, and its leaves were said to
have fallen only at certain intervals; he who had the
happiness to find and eat one of them was restored, at
once, to youth and vigor." Sir Emerson Tennent, who
wrote about i860, says of it:
" The Bo-tree of Anuradha-pura is, in all probability,
ihe oldest historical tree in th& woi4d. It was planted 288

years before Christ, and hence is now 2,147 years old. Ages varying from one to four thousand years have been
assigned'to the Baobabs of Senegal, the Eucalyptus of Tas
. mania, the 'Dragon-tree of Orotava, the Seqjtoia of Cali
fornia, and the chestnut of Mount Etna. But all these
•estimates are.matters of conjecture, and such calculations,
however ingenious, must be purely inferential. Whereas
the age of the Bo-tree is matter of record, its conservancy
has been an object of' solicitude to successive dynasties,
•and the story of its vicissitudes has been preserved in a
^series- of continuous chronicles, among the most authentic that have been handed -down to mankind. Compared
with it, the Oak of Ellerslie is but a sapling, and the Conqueror's Oak in Windsor Forest barely numbers half
its years. The yew trees of Fountain's Abbey are be
.lieved to have flourished there 1,200 years ago ; the olives jn the Garden of Gethsemane were full grown when the 'Saracens were expelled from Jerusalem ; and the Cypress of Senna, in Lombardy, is said to have been a tree in the
time of Julius Csesar ; yet the Bo-tree is older than the
oldest of these by a century, and would almost seem to verify the prophecy pronounced when it was planted,
that it would flourish and be green forever." To which Rhys-David adds :
" The tree could scarcely have lived so long had it not
been for the constant care of the monks. As it showed
signs of decay terraces were built up around it, so that it now grows more than twenty feet above the surround
ing soil ; for the tree being of the fig species—its bo
'tanical name is ficus religiosa—its living branches could
then throw out fresh raots. Where its long arms spread
beyond the inclosure, rude pillars of iron or masonry
have been used to prop them up; and it is carefully

age ; but we could not be sure ot its identity were it not

been so well brought together by Sir Emerson Tennent.!'
REDUCING THE TKIPITAKA TO WRITING.
In the year 88 B. C. (Buddhism had long before this
become the religion of the whole of this great island),
the king built the largest Dagaba ia Ceylon, 250 feet in
height. It was at this time that the whole of the Three
Pitakas were reduced to writing. This was 330 years,
after Gautama's death. The Ceylonese history says
:
' ' The wise monks of former days handed down by word of mouth The text of the Three Pitakas, and the Commentary upon them:. Seeing the destruction of men, the monks of this time assembled,. And, that the Faith might last long, they wrote them in books."
This has more significance than is at first apparent tO' a European accustomed to beheve that books can only
be preserved by writing. The Hindus believe just the
opposite. Even at the present time, if all copies of the
Vedas were destroyed, the Vedas would still be pre
served in the memory of the priests, as they have been
for certainly more than 3,000 years ; and those priests,
look upon the Veda, thus authenticated, as the test to
which all printed or written copies must give way. If
you depend upon written copies, they would argue, you
are sure to make and to perpetuate mistakes; but the
text, as handed down by word of mouth, is preserved,
not only by being itself constantly repeated, but by the
assistance of the commentaries, in which every word of
the text is carefully enshrined. So long as reliance can
be placed on the succession of teachers and pupils, this
argument may not be so far from wrong ; but when a
text has to be preserved in a small country, liable to be.

BUDDHACIIOSHA IN CEYLON.
Buddhaghosha, the famous monk, was born near the
Bo-tree. He came to Ceylon in 430 A. D. He wrote
a cyclopaedia of Buddhist doctrine, and was readily ac
cepted as a teacher by the Sangha of Ceylon. He wrote
out the Buddhist commentaries in the Pali language, and those that had been made in the Ceylonese language,
about 600 years beiore were completely lost through disuse. From Ceylon he went to Burmah in 450 A. D. He left an indelible impression on the Buddhism of Ceylon, and through it on the Buddhism of the whole of
Southern Asia. Of the writino-s of this distinguished
teacher we have before spoken.
A BUDDHIST TEMPLE IN CEYLON.
The Buddhist temples stand in the most beautiful
situations. Waving cocoa-nut palms, broad-leaved bread
fruit trees, flowering shrubs, with sweet-scented blossoms,
surround the temple court, and astonish the visitor by
their loveliness. But enter the court and what a contrast ! What do we see ? A long narrow room, with
no light but what struggles in through the door, or some
times arises from a few dim oil-lamps ; a shelf running
from end to end of it ; a huge image of painted clay,
more than forty feet long, lying stretched upon the shelf,
with fixed staring eyes, as if quite unconcerned with all
things round about; and a heavy, oppressive smell of smoking lamps and dead flowers, that have been offered
to the image, reminding one strongly of the spiritual
death and darkness of the blind worshipers. Such are the
places of worship of the one and a half millions of Budd
hists in Ceylon. Surrounded by the most luxuriant beau
ties of the natural world, religiously they are in darkness.

its shape and appearance, seems to be the tooth of a

THE SACRED CEYLONESE BOOKS.
There are three books regarded as sacred by the Bud
dhists of Ceylon. The first, called the Mahavanso, is the
most highly venerated. It has been very carefully handed
down and the ancient and modern copies vary but a very
little. It contains "The Doctrine, Race and Lineage of
Buddha," and the authentic annals of Ceylonese Bud
dhism. The second, called the Rajaratnacari, was written
by a priest. It contains a history of Buddha, extracts
from the most ancient books, records of the erection of
temples, and the history of the kings from 540 B. C.
down to modern times. The third, called the Rajavali, is
the work of different hands, and completes the other books.
It narrates the history of Ceylon from the coming of the
Dutch to Ceylon down to the time when they expelled the Portuguese and gained possession of Colombo.

BUDDHISM IN BUKMAH.
On the pagoda spire, The bells are swinging,
Their little golden circlet in a flutter, With tales the wooing winds have dared to utter, Till all are ringing. As if a choir Of golden-nested birds in heaven were singing ; And with a lulling sound, The music floats around. And drops like balm into the drowsy ear. Mrs. Emily C. Judson.
THE early religion of the Burmese was Shamanism;
the belief in evil spirits and the necessity of ward
ing off their hurtful influence by the use of charms
and amulets. Buddhism has taken the place of this degrading system among the Burmese. Besides the Bur
mese there are other peoples in Burmah ; the Karens, of
whose religion we have already spoken, the Shans, who
are Buddhists, and the Mons who adhere still to the old
practice of Shamanism. The old evil-spirit worship of
the Burmese and Shans still remains to some extent in
the Nat worship. Just when Buddhism was introduced
into Burmah is a little uncertain. Dr. Francis Mason,
an American missionary, in his work on Burmah speaks
as follows, and as the whole extract is an excellent account
of the introduction of Buddhism and a summary of its
doctrines, we present it entire : "Three hundred years before Alexandria was founded;



556 j^A-A'OA'\S CIIAIAS.
about the time that Thales, the most ancient philosopher
of Europe, was teaching in Greece that water is the
origin of all things, the soul of the world; and Zoroaster,
in Media or Persia, was systematizing the fire-worship of
the Magi ; and Confucius in China was calling on the
teemingf multitudes around him to offer to euardian
spirits and the Manes of their ancestors ; and Nebuchad
nezzar set up his golden image in the plain of Dura, and
Daniel was laboring in Babylon to establish the worship
of the true God ; a reverend sao-e, with his staff and
scrip, who had left a throne for philosophy, was traveling from Gaya to Benares, and from Benares to Kanouj, ex
horting the people against theft, falsehood, adultery, killing
and intemperance. No temperance lecturer advocates
teetotalism now more strongly than did this sage Gau
tama twenty-three centuries age. Nor did he confine
his instructions to external vices. Pride, anger, lust, envy
and covetousness were condemned by him in as strong
terms as are ever heard from the Christian pulpit. Love,
mercy, patience, self-denial, alms-giving, truth and the
cultivation of v/isdom he required of all. Good actions,
good words and good thoughts were the frequent subjects of his sermons, and he was unceasing in his cau
tions to keep the mind free from the turmoils of passion
and the cares of life. Immediately after the death of this
venerable peripatetic, his disciples scattered themselves
abroad to propagate the doctrines of their master, and
tradition says one party entered the principal mouth of
the Irrawaddy, where they traced its banks to where the
first rocks lift themselves abruptly above the flats around.
Here on the summit of this laterite ledge, i6o feet above
the river, they erected the standard of Buddhism, which now lifts its spire to the heavens higher than the dome
of St. Paul's."

But there is an entire absence of any historical confir
mation of these traditions, and we have no definite infor
mation of the coniine of Budclliism to Burmah until Buddhaghosha brought it about 450 A. D. Burmese Buddhism bears a very close resemblance to
diat of Ceylon. As we have already discussed the prin
ciples of Buddhism in general, we shall pass to notice
more particularly the temples, idols, festivals and worship
of Burmal"L A good idea of Burmese Buddhism can be obtained from a visit to its Grand Shway-da-Gong Pagoda.
THE SHWAY-DA-GONG PAGODA.
The Mecca of Southern Buddhism is the great pagoda,
at Rangoon. This the lareest buildine of the kind in
Burmah, and, perhaps, also in the world. It is situated
about a mile from the city, on a rocky ledge, perhaps 100
feet high, overlooking the valley of the Irrawadd)' and the city of Rangoon. The entrance is guarded by two
hug-e orriffins of brick and mortar. Passinsf on between
rows of long, narrow sheds, beautifully carved and gaudily
painted, and after climbing a staircase, one stands upon
an immense stone terrace, upon which the pagoda itself
stands. The terrace is nearly 1,000 feet square. The
pagoda tapers upwards to a height of 300 feet, and ter
minates in a h'tee. The pagoda is round in shape, and
solid throughout. It is built of bricks, and, unlike the
Pyramids of Egypt, there is no chamber in its interior,
nothing but the casket containing the staff of Kantha
thon, the water-dipper of Gaunagon, a garment of Kat
hapa and the eight hairs of Gautama. The whole of the
exterior is covered with gold-leaf, presenting a dazzling
appearance, as it reflects the rays of the sun. The h'tee
on the top — the umbrella-shaped finial — is made of a
series of gilded iron rings, from which hang a great many

little silver and brass bells, which are swung' and rung by
the wind. Not long ago, the father of the present King
of Burmah placed a new h'tee upon the pagoda. It cost

was Studded with gems. At the very top was a large emerald. This h'tee was brought to a landing-place about two miles from the pagodas. The road over which
it was to come was covered with white cloth by a devout merchant. The pagoda was covered with a framework
of bamboo, which made it easy to ascend to its top.
Weeks of religious festivities were held, during which the
worshipers poured their gold, and silver, and precious
stones into the pagoda's treasury. On the day appointed,, the old h'tee was removed, and the new one hoisted ring
by ring to its place.
Within the pagoda inclosure there are many temples, most containing huge images of Gautama, made of wood,,
brick and lime, or marble and metal. On small tables,,
in front of many of the images, are placed candles, flowers
and little paper flags. Around the pagoda tall poles are
placed at short intervals, each crowned with a h'tee.
Near the pagoda is a great bell, under which a man
may stand upright. The worshipers strike upon this bell,,
to attract the attention of the recording angels, so that
they may not omit to credit them with the worship about
to be performed in honor of the gods.
THE STORY OF SFIWAY-DA-GONG.
Two brothers, said in the native books to have beert
Mons or Talaings, having made an offering to Gautama,
beo-p'ed in return some relic of himself, on which he
too ' stroked his head, and gave them eisfht hairs that came
out. These he desired them to deposit in a pagoda in a
spot where had already been buried certain relics of his
three great predecessors. They ficcordingly started with them for "Suvarna-bhumi," the Sanskrit name of Pegu,
but on the way lost six of the hairs. However, they were
recovered in a miraculous manner, and the holy site



56o £A7iO/i'S CHAINS.
pointed out to them by the Nats. Here, on digging, the
reUcs of the former Buddhas—viz., a water-scoop of Gau
nagon, a robe of Kathapa, and a staff of Kanthathon,
—were found, and tliese, together with the eight hairs of
Gautama, were deposited in a hole on the top of the hill on which "Shway-da-Gong" now stands, and a solid pagoda
of stones, sixty-six feet high was erected. This pagoda
is thus specially sacred to all Buddhists, as the only one known to them as now existing, which is supposed to
contain the relics not only of Gautama, but also of all the
Buddhas of this present world. At the time of its erec
tion, and for centuries afterwards, no town existed on the
site of Rangoon, and the pagoda stood, like many others
at the present day, in the midst of the wild forest. The
history of the pagoda, which is rather a long one, con
tains detailed particulars of the various improvements,
repairs and enlargements made to it by various kings.
The edifice has been cased several times (as was also the
custom with the Ceylon dagobas) with a fresh outer
surrounding of bricks several feet thick, thus each time
increasing its height and size. Thus, in A. D. 1447, the
King of Pegu encased it afresh, and made its height 301^
feet. In 1462, the King of Pegu cast, it is said, a colossal
bell, 168 feet high, 12 feet in diameter and 36 feet in cir
cumference ; also several other smaller bells, and paved
the platform or terrace of the pagoda with 50,000 flat stones. This wonderful bell, it is perhaps unnecessary
to say, is not in existence at the present time.
OTHER PAGODAS.
Besides the Shway-da-Gong Pagoda, there is a host of
lesser ones. The erection of pagodas is generally a
work of merit. It must be borne in mind that these are
never temples, but simply relic-houses. There are

temples and monasteries grouped around them. At one
place is the "Seven Pagodas," built on the spot where
Gautama—when, in the course of his transmigrations,
his soul inhabited the body of a rooster—is said to have
scratched for his breakfast. Again, there are others
built where Gautama has left the imprint of his footsteps.
PAGODA AT MAULMAIN, BURMAH, LITTLE BELLS SUSPENDED FROM ITS
SUMMIT SWING IN THE WIND.
There are a great many traditions told in regard to
the building of these pagodas. One legend runs thus :
A certain hermit, having received one of the hairs of the
Lord, wandered about searching for a suitable spot
where to enshrine it. In the meanwhile he reverently



566 EliA'OR-S CHAINS.
carried the sacred relic on his head. After some time
he arrived on the summit of this mountain, and deposited
the lioly hair in the clelt ot tlie rod-:, and erected the
pagoda on the great boulder. From this legend is de
rived the name " Kyeik-ethel-yuh," meaning "the object
of worship borne on the head of the hermit." This
boulder is more than half hanging over the perpendicular
lace of a cliff. How it holds its position it is indeed dif
ficult to say, as it lies beyond the line of the centre of
gravity. The boulder is thirty feet high, and the pagoda
fifteen feet. Another legend is as follows :
Two merchants joined together and built a small pagoda, two feet high. The next morning, when they went
to pay their homage at this shrine, they found the pagoda
had increased to double their work ; so, takinp- this as a
:sign that the Nats approved of their offering, they con
tinued to enlarge this pile of brick ; they working by day and the unseen power by night. It now measures more
than three hundred feet high. They have also a stone,
which they call an impression of Gautama's foot. Some
of these stones are six feet long, and covered with
strange figures supposed to express their religious ideas.
WORSHIP OF NATS,
The adoradon and dread of Nats enters into all the life and legends of the Burmese. These Nats are spirits,
both good and evil. Offerings are presented and ceremonies performed to obtain favors and advantages from
the good, and to propitiate the evil Nats. The worship
of Nats is intimately related to the old worship of spirits before Buddhism came to Burmah. The Nats are sup
posed to live in the six lower heavens, beyond the moon.
They are able to transport themselves with the utmost
rapidity to and about our world. They are believed to

interfere in tlie affairs of man, even more than tlie gods.
They correspond to the genii of the Arabian Nights'
Entertainment, to tlie fairies and elfins of Britain in olden
times, with perhaps the added ideas of angels and devils.
The story of King Tektha, which follows, will probably
'dve a more correct impression of the Burmese notions
of the Nats than any description could impart. This is
but a single specimen of a great many such stories which
are still current among the Burmese:
A NAT STORY.
Once upon a time, there lived, in Burmah, a king' named Tektha. The kines that were before him had been devout wor
shipers of Gautama, and had listened to what their
teachers and priests taught them. But Tektha did not
believe in Gautama, but listened to strange teachers, who
taught him that everything was God. He would not
hear the Buddhist books, nor worship the relics nor the
images. More than this, instead of behaving reverently
to the priests, he destroyed their temples, and threw the
idols into the water. He forbade his subjects also to
worship Gautama, and threatened that if they did they
should be severely punished.
The people were in dismay. It was of no use for the
priests to carry round their rice-pots ; no one dared offer
them food ; the temples and pagodas were falling into
ruins, and the images of Gautama were lying in the
water, spoilt and decaying.
What would be the consequence of this terrible treatment of their god ? The people were afraid of the pun
ishment with which the king threatened them if they wor
shiped Gautama ; they feared the evils which the great
spirits, the Nats, might bring upon them if they did not



568 ERKOR'S CHAINS.
But a few of the people would not give up the worship to which they had been so long accustomed ; and among
those who still in secret held to the old faith was a girl,
twelve years of age, and her mother. I do not know the
girl's name ; but, said she, " The king has thrown the
idols into the water because he is afraid of them." This
was considered a very bold speech.
Affairs continued in this state for four years. When
the girl was sixteen, she happened one day to be bathing
in a tank with a number of her companions, and, while
amusing herself in the water, she saw an idol lying near.
She ordered her attendants to lift it out and carry it to a
zayat, or rest-house, that was at hand. They reminded
her that she would certainly be put to death for meddling
with it ; but she was very determined, and declared that
she would worship that image as long as she lived. It
was accordingly lifted out of the water, washed and car
ried into the zayat.
A report of what had been done was immediately taken
to the kino^, and you can imamne how enrao^ed he was.
He ordered his servants to take a fierce elephant, and
make the savage animal trample this bold young woman
to death, thus making a terrible example of her case.
But it was not so easy to do this. The seven principal
Nats, who had been greatly displeased by the king's
wickedness, came to the defense of the girl. These seven
were, the Nat of the universe, the Nat of the earth, the
Nat of the trees, the Nat of the air, the Nat of the cities,
the Nat of the villages and the Nat of the white umbrella.
The elephant was brought, but he did not touch the
girl ; he was beaten and goaded, but it was of no avail
;
he would not lift up a foot against her, and instead of
being angry only grew frightened, and tried to run away
from her without harming her in the least.



BUDDHISM IN BURMAH. 569
When the king heard that she could not be put to
deatli this way, he ordered a quantity of dry straw to be
collected, the girl placed in the midst of it, and so be
burnt to death. The straw was brought, she was put in
the middle, but no number of torches, no quantity of fire would make it burn. The Nats were there, and the\'
would not allow her to be put to death.
Then the king sent for her to his palace. He was surprised as well as angry now, and was wondering whether he might not possibly have been wrong in
forsakinof the s^ods of his forefathers. " If the imaofe
which you have dared to take from the water," said he,
" will come through the air into my presence, and I see
it, your life shall be spared ; but if not, you shall be cut
into seven pieces."
The young woman asked permission to return for a
short time to the zayat. Her request was granted, and
there she went and prayed very earnestly that the image
might be carried into the king's presence. And, lo ! not
only one, but eight images, and the young woman her
self with her attendants, were immediately taken up by
the Nats, conveyed through the air, and put down before the king and his principal queen, his commander-in-chief
his officers, and a multitude of people. How they all shouted and wondered !
"Now," said the girl, turning to the king, "now that
the image of my god and teacher has flown to you, will
you order the teachers from whom you have learned this
false religion to mount up also and fly through the air ?"
The king ordered them to do so, but, of course, it was

The fishermen make a small shed, termed a Natsin,
near their fishery, in which every morning offerings of
fruit, leaves, rice, or some such tribute is placed ; if this

large and conspicuous tree ; he halts, plucks a few leaves
near or perhaps takes a little boiled rice out of his bag,
and places them as an offering to the Nat of the tree. In

educated and most enhghtened native officials will, in
any difficulty or trouble, send for one of these diviners
to consult the fates. One or two lucky hits will, of
course, raise any special prophet's reputation through
out the country, and give him abundant business.
THE FUNERAL OF A PONGYEE, OR MONK.
As soon as a pongyee has expired, the body is rever
ently washed by the elders, who were his supporters.
The body is then opened, the viscera extracted, and
buried anywhere without ceremony. The cavity ot the
abdomen is filled with hot ashes and various preservative
substances. Lonof swathes of white cotton-cloth are
wrapped as tightly as possible round the corpse from
head to foot, over which are placed the yellow robes of
the order. Another coarser wrapping of cotton-cloth is
tightly wound over this, and then thickly covered with
black varnish, on which gold leaf is applied, so that the
whole is gilt. A coffin is prepared from a single log,
hollowed out, which many old pongyees keep in their
monasteries ready for their demise. The body, having
been placed in this, is left for some weeks to dry up, for
most of such venerable and aged recluses are little more than a frame-work of bones, covered with a withered
skin. The cover is at length nailed on; the coffin is
thickly covered with a resinous varnish and gilt. It is
temporarily laid in state in the monastery, on a high dais,
ornamented with tinsel, gilding and paper lace, sur
mounted by a white umbrella, or canopy of muslin, and
is constantly visited by pilgrims from the surrounding
country, who make their obeisance and present offerings
of flowers, etc., to it.
As soon as sufficient funds have been collected, a



t^y2 j=:a'A'oj?'s chains.
building, called Nibban Kyeng (tliat is, Monastery of the
Dead), is erected for the reception ot the body. With
obscure and inferior monks this is only made of bam
boos and thatch; but with a distinguished and venerated
monk it is a substantial structure, with large, handsome
pillars of iron-wood or teak, roofed with shingles. This
is open all around, or is only surrounded by a railing to
keep out animals. In the centre, within a high sar
cophagus, richly but rudely adorned with gilding, glass,
mosaic work and painting, is enshrined the coffin, to
await, perhaps, for four years the final funeral rites.
At length, the time of waiting has passed ; the prepara
tions are complete ; a fortunate day has been fixed upon, and for weeks previous, the town where the ceremony is
to take place, and all the surrounding country, has been
astir with the arrangements for and expectation of the
great event.
The coffin is placed on a gigantic car, solidly con
structed, and with four heavy solid wooden wheels, sur
mounted with a canopy similar in form and construction
to that crowning the funeral pyre. This lofty turret is drawn along by hundreds of men, and placed in the cen
tre of the plain. The next day, the fun begins. Two
great ropes of twisted canes, or coirs, are fastened to the
funeral car in front and behind, long enough for a hundred
people to hold on to each and to pull each way. The
people group themselves about either rope as they be
long- to one or other of two neiehboring- villag-es. Then
comes a tug, each trying to pull the car away from the
other.
On the night before the last day of the festival, the
coffin is removed from the car and placed on the funeral
pyre, on an iron grating, under which is a quantity of
wcv^^i. rriade more combustible by the use of oil, resin and

the like, mixed with fragrant woods. Early on the day
appointed for the burning of the pongyee's body, par
ties come from the different villages, bringing rude rock
ets of every size. Some are a foot long and an inch in
calibre ; others are monsters, nine and twelve feet in
length, and have a bore of six to nine inches diameter.

All are crammed to the muzzles with gunpowder, the tubes being hollowed logs of wood strongly bound with

object is to strike the pyre witli the rocket, and fire the
combustibles placed inside. Happy will be the village
which owns the fortunate rocket, and great their pros
perity during- the ensuing year.
All being ready, men of each village are allowed to go
up in rotation and discharge their weapon. The smoke,
the ilame, the roar is tremendous, to the intense delio'ht
of the shouting crowd.
One at length strikes as it seems with full power: a
pause, a little smoke, then a little flame issues from one
corner of the pyre, and a shout from thousands of throats,
proclaims the auspicious event. The crowd rushes for
ward, fire is carefully applied to the mass of combustibles under and around the coffin, and soon the whole is in a
blaze. The people watch round, giving a cheer as each
small pinnacle falls in, and wait, anxiously looking for the
lofty canopy itself to topple over into the flames. This
event is greeted with a tremendous shout, and then all
disperse homewards, happy and merry. A few elders remain to watch the burning pyre till all is consumed, and the next day the monks of the monastery collect the
fragments of half-burnt bones and the ashes of the de
ceased, and reverently inter them in some fitting place,
and, perhaps, a small pagoda is erected over them as a monument. Such is Buddhism in Burmah. American missionaries have won many of the Bur
mese, as of the Karens also, from these ceremonies to
the Christian faith.

SIAM is'the land lying just to the east of Burmah;
on account of the extreme reverence paid to the
white elephant it is often called the Land of the
White Elephant. It has a population of 6,300,000,,
who are, with but a few exceptions, Buddhists. Bud
dhism entered this country in 638 A. D., and was thus the
last nation to yield to the power of that religion. The Siam
ese people are gentle, cheerful, timid, careless and almost
passionless. They are disposed to idleness, inconstancy
and inaction ; they are liberal almsgivers, severe in en
forcing decorum between the sexes. They are fond of sports, and spend half their time in amusements. They
are sharp and even witty in conversation, and resemble
the Chinese in their dexterity in imitation. Of theatrical
displays, rope-dancing and the like, they are extremely
fond.
Of the wit of the people, the best evidence is to be found
in their familiar proverbs, of which a few are here cited:



i76 ERROR'S CHAINS.
" When you go into a wood, do not forget your wood
knite."
" An elephant though he has four legs may slip ; and a
doctor is not ahvaj^s right."
"Go up by land you meet a tiger; go down by water
you meet a crocodile."
" If a dog bite you, do not bite him again."
As in most Oriental lands there is the greatest and most
painful contrast between the luxury and splendor of the
king's court and the poverty and squalor of the common
people. The royal palaces are filled with all that wealth
and power can procure. The peasants' hovels are denied
even the common comforts of life ; they are bare and com
fortless. They contain no furniture, but only a few roughly made vessels of earthenware, and a mat or two
spread upon the floor. The food of a peasant consists
of a bowl of rice with a morsel of fish. At a Siamese
State dinner there are usually served with great ceremony
from sixty to a hundred carefully cooked dishes.
THE CELEBRATED WAT CHANG PAGODA.
This is the most splendid temple in Bangkok. It is
shaped somewhat like a bell, rising to the height probably
of 250 feet. Every inch of its surface glitters with curi
ous ornaments and carvings ; the forms of men and birds,
and beasts like nothing in heaven above, nor earth be
neath, nor waters under the earth. It is made of brick
and plastered on the outside. In a large niche in the
sides, about two-thirds of the way to the top are images
of Buddha, riding on four white elephants made of shin
ing porcelain each facing toward one of the points of
the compass. A sharp spire rises from the summit.
All over this temple tower, from the base to the
top, from eve.ry projecting point hang a multitude of

Within the Wat Chang inclosure, besides the pagoda,
are priests' dweUings, temples, with their idols, a preach
ing-hall, a library and small parks, with flower and fruit
gardens, ponds, caves and stone statues of Chinese sages
and warriors, presenting a scene of bewildering richness.
TEMPLE OF THE EMERALD IDOL.
The Wat P'hra Keau is the temple where the reigning monarch worships. On the road leading to this
temple is another temple, the Wat Poh, where reposes in
gigantic state the wondrous Sleeping Idol. This is a re
clining figure, 150 feet long and 40 feet high, entirely
covered with gold-plate. The soles of this giant figure's
feet are covered with carvings inlaid with pearl and chased
with gold. The designs of these carvings represent the
many transmigrations of Buddha before he obtained Nir
vana (or, as the Siamese call it, Niphan). On the nails
of the toes are engraven Buddha's ten divine attributes.
Beyond this temple are the stables, or, more properly
speaking, the Palace of the White Elephant, where the
huge creature is housed and cared for royally.
Beyond these is the Temple of the Emerald Idol. This
is one of the most remarkable and beautiful structures of
its kind in all the East. Its model is like that of all the
others, but its finish is of a much higher order. The ex
terior is adorned with lofty octagonal pillars, with quaint
Gothic doors and windows, all carved with a great variety



s8o £KJWK'S CHAIA^S.
of emblems, the lotos and the palm occurring most fre
quently. This temple, like all Siamese temples, is built
of brick, with a number of roofs risintj in connected tiers,
and reaching out over broad verandas, supported by
vows of pillars, the whole covered with white cement.
The roots are usually made of many-colored tiles ; at the
ends of the ridge-pole are many ornaments, resembling



ALTAR OF THE TEMPLE OF THE EMERALD IDOL, blAM,






BUDDHISM IN SJAM. 583
bullocks' horns in size and shape. The walls and ceil
ing of the interior are covered with finely-executed paint
ings. Mrs. Leonowens, an English lady who lived for
six years in the palace of the King of Siam, and who
thereby enjoyed unusual privileges, thus describes the
interior and worship of the Wat P'hra Keau :
" The altar is a wonder of dimensions and splendor

a pyramid 100 feet high, terminating in a fine spire of
gold, and surrounded on every side by idols, all curious
and precious, from the bijou image in sapphire to the
colossal statue in plate-gold. A series of trophies these,
gathered from the triumphs of Buddhism over the proud
est forms of worship in the old pagan world. In the
pillars that surround the temple, and the spires that taper
far aloft, may be traced types and emblems borrowed from
the Temple of the Sun at Baalbec, the proud fane of Diana
at Ephesus, the shrines of the Delian Apollo ; but the
Brahminical symbols and interpretations prevail. Strange
that it should be so with a sect that suffered by the slay
ings and the banishments of a ruthless persecution, at
the hands of their Brahmin fathers, for the cause of re
storing the culture of that simple and pure philosophy
which flourished before Pantheism. " The floor is paved with diamond-shaped pieces of
polished brass, which reflect the light of tall tapers that
have burned on for more than a hundred years, so closely
is the sacred fire watched. The floods of light and depths
of shadow about the altar are extreme, and the effect
overwhelmincf.
"The Emerald Idol is about twelve inches high and
eight in width. Into the virgin gold of which its hair and
collar are composed, must have been stirred, while the
metal was yet molten, crystals, topazes, sapphires, rubies,
onyxes, amethysts and diamonds—the stones crude, or

rudely cut, and blended in such proportions as might
enhance to the utmost imaginable limit the beauty and
the cost of the adored effigy. The combination is as harmonious as it is splendid. No wonder it is commonly
believed that Buddha himself alighted on the spot in the
form of a great emerald, and by a flash of lightning con
jured the glittering edifice and altar in an instant from,
the earth, to be a house and a throne for him there !
" On either side of the eastern entrance—called ' The
Beautiful Gate'—stands a modern statue; one of Saint.
Peter, with flowing mantle and sandaled feet, in an atti
tude of sorrow, as when ' he turned away his face and
wept;' the other of Ceres, scattering flowers. The west
ern entrance, which admits only ladies, is called 'The An
gel's Gate,' and is guarded by genii of ferocious aspect.
" On a floor diamonded with polished brass sat a throng
of women, the elite of Siam. All were robed in pure
white, with white silk scarfs drawn from the left shoulder
in careful folds across the bust and back, and thrown
gracefully over the right. A little apart sat their female
slaves, of whom many were inferior to their mistresses
only in social consideration and wordly gear, being their
half sisters — children of the same father by a slave
mother. "The women sat in circles, and each displayed her vase
of flowers and her lighted taper before her. In front of
all were a number of my younger pupils, the royal chil
dren, in circles also. Close by the altar, on a low square
stool, overlaid with a thin cushion of silk, sat the high
priest. Chow Khoon Sah. In his hand he held a concave
fan, lined with pale-green silk, the back richly embroid
ered, jeweled and gilt. He was draped in a yellow robe,,
not unlike the Roman toga, a loose and flowing habit,
closed below the waist, but open from the throat to the



RUINED TEMPLE AND IDOL OF BUDDHA AT AYUDIA, THE OLD CAPITAL OF SIAM.






BUDDHISM IN SIAM. 587
girdle, which was simply a band of yellow cloth, bound
tightly. From the shoulders hung two narrow strips,
-also yellow, descending over the robe to the feet, and
resembling the scapular worn by certain orders of the
Roman Catholic clergy. At his side was an open watch
of gold, the Qrift of his sovereion. At his feet sat seven
teen disciples, shading their faces with fans less richly adorned.
"We put off our shoes—my child and I—having respect
for the ancient prejudice against them, feeling not so
much reverence for the place as for the hearts that wor
shiped there; caring to display not so much the love of
wisdom as the wisdom of love ; and well were we repaid
by the grateful smile of recognition that greeted us as
we entered.
"We sat down cross-legged. No need to hush my
boy ; the silence. there, so subduing, checked with its mys
terious awe even his inquisitive young mind. The vener
able high-priest sat with his face jealously covered, lest
his eyes should tempt his thoughts to stray. I changed
my position to catch a glimpse of his countenance. He
drew his fan-veil more closely, giving me a quick, but
gentle half-glance of remonstrance. Then raisino- his
eyes, with lids nearly closed, he chanted in an infantile,
wailing tone.
"That was the opening prayer. At once the whole
congregation raised themselves on their knees, and, all
together, prostrated themselves thrice profoundly, thrice
touching the polished brass floor with their foreheads,
and then, with heads bowed and palms folded and eyes
closed, they delivered the responses after the priest,
much in the manner of the English Liturgy; first the
priest, then the people, and finally all together. There
was no singing, no standing up and sitting down, no

changing of robes and places, no turning the face to the
altar, nor north, nor south, nor east, nor west. All
knelt still, with hands folded straight before them, and eyes
strictly, tightly closed. Indeed, there were faces there
that expressed devotion and piety, the humblest and the
purest, as the lips murmured, ' O, Thou Eternal One,
Thou perfection of Time, Thou truest Truth, Thou im
mutable essence of all Change, Thou most excellent radiance of Mercy, Thou infinite Compassion, Thou Pity,
Thou Charity!'
"I lost some of the responses in the simultaneous repe
tition, and did but imperfectly comprehend the exhorta
tion that followed, in which was inculcated the strictest
practice of charity, in a manner so pathetic and so gentle
as might be wisely imitated by the most orthodox of
Christian priests. There was majesty in the humility of
those pagan worshipers, and in their shame of self they
were sublime."
WORSHIP OF THE WHITE ELEPHANT
With regard to this subject, before referred to, we
prefer using another's description:
Sir John Bowring tells us that the Buddhists have a
special reverence for white quadrupeds ; that he has him
self seen a white monkey honored with special attention.
Also, that white elephants have been the cause of many a
war, and their possession more an object of envy than the
conquest of territory or the transitory glories of the battle
field. In the money market a white elephant is almost
beyond price. Fifty thousand dollars would hardly repre
sent its pecuniary value; a hair from its tail is worth a
Jew's ransom. " It was my good fortune," he says, "to pre
sent to the First King of Siam (the Siamese have two kings exercising stmreme authority) presents with which I had

a golden box, locked with a golden key, and he informed
me the box contained a gift far more valuable than all
the rest, and that was a few hairs of the white elephant.



590 EHROJi'S CHAINS.
And perhaps it may be well to state why the white ele
phant is so specially reverenced. " It is because it is be
lieved that Buddha, the supreme emanation from the
Deity, will ne

BUDDHISM IN SIAM. cgj
they may possess the presence of Buddha himself. It is known that the Ceylonese have been kept in subjection
by the behef that their rulers have a tooth of Buddha in
the temple of Kandy, and that on various tracts of the
East impressions of the foot of Buddha are reverenced,
and are the objects of weary pilgrimages to places which
can only be reached with difficulty; but with the white ele
phant some vague notions of a vital Buddha are associated, and there can be no doubt that the marvelous
sagacity of the creature has served to strengthen their
religious prejudices. Siamese are known to whisper
their secrets into an elephant's ear, and to ask a solu-
tion of their perplexities by some sign or movement.
And most assuredly there is more sense and reason in
the worship of an intelligent beast than in that of stocks
and stones, the work of men's hands.
"And yet," continues _ Sir John, "after all, the white
elephant is not white, nor anything like it. It is of a
coffee-color ; not of unburnt, but of burnt coffee—dull
brownish yellow or yellowish brown—white only by con
trast with his darker brother. The last which reached
Bangkok was caught in the woods. The king and court went a long way out into the country to meet him, and he was conducted with a grand procession, much pomp
and music, and flying banners, to the capital. There a
grand mansion awaited him, and several of the leading
nobility were appointed his custodians. The walls were
painted to represent forests, no doubt to remind him of
his native haunts, and to console him in his absence from
them. All his wants were sedulously provided for, and
in his 'walks abroad,' when 'many men he saw,' he was escorted by music and caparisoned by costly vestments. His grandest and farthest promenades were to bathe in the river, when other elephants were in attendance, hon

ored by being made auxiliaries to his grandeur. Now
and then the two sovereigns sought his presence, but I
did not learn that his dignity condescended to oblige
them with any special notice. But he wanted no addition
to his dignity. Everything associated with majesty and
rank bore his image. A white elephant is the badge of
distinction. The royal flags and seals, medals and
moneys—on all sides the white elephant is the national
emblem, as the cross among Christians, or the crescent among Turks ; and the Siamese are prouder of it than Americans, Russians, Germans or French are of their eagles, or Spaniards of the golden fleece. The Bourbon
Oriflamme, the British Union Jack, show but faintly in the presence of the white elephant."
RUINS OF THE GREAT TEMPLE OF NAGKON WAT.
Some of the most famous ruins of the world, and but
little known to general readers, are those at Angkor, in Eastern Siam. The Frenchman, M. Mouhot, says the
ruins of Nagkon Wat—a temple which must have ri
valed the temple of Solomon in its splendor—might
take a most honorable place beside our most beautiful
buildings. It is grander than anything left to us by Greece and Rome. Another writer says the ruins of Angkor are as imposing as the ruins of Thebes or Mem
phis, and more mysterious. Modern travelers have
proved in their descriptions of these ruins that these are
not words of fulsome praise.
There are no certain answers to the questions who built it? when was it built? and what has become of the
builders ? But recent researches In Chinese history seem
to show that It was built between the tenth and twelfth
centuries A. D.

side of the causeway are artificial lakes, each of about
five acres in extent. The temple is romantically, as well
as beautifully and impressively situated in the midst of a
forest of palm-trees. The outer wall of the Nagkon
Wat is about half a mile square, and is built of sand
stone, with gate-ways upon each side. These are hand
somely carved with figures of gods and dragons. The main gate-way is on the western side, passing through
which and up a causeway, for a distance of i,ooo feet,
one comes to the central main entrance of the temple.
The entire building is raised on three terraces, each
about thirty feet above the other. The whole is built of
stone, without cement, with joints so closely fitting that
even the lapse of years has not seamed. The immense
blocks of stone were quarried about thirty miles away.
The central temple is oblong, being 796 feet long, 585
feet wide, and 250 feet high in the centre. From the
door-way, on either side, runs back a hall-way, with a
double row of columns, each cut—base, shaft and capi
tal —from a single block. This hall-way has an ovalshaped roof, covered with carvings and walls covered
with sculptures. This gallery of sculptures, which forms
the exterior of the temples, consists of over half a mile of
continuous pictures, cut upon sandstone slabs, each six
feet in width. These sculptures represent subjects taken from the Hindu book called the Ramayana, which de
scribes the adventures of the god Rama and the son of the king of Oudh.
In the Nagkon Wat 1,532 solid columns have been counted. Passing on up steep staircases, we come to several image-houses. These contain several hundred
images, made of stone, wood, brass, clay, of all shapes,
sizes and ages. Galleries cross and recross each other.
Finally we come to the central pagoda, in which are at

mounted by a small, round crown. The tradition says
that this king was an Egyptian, who for some wicked deed
was turned into a leper, and who built the temple in ful
fillment of a vow that he might be freed from his disease.
SOME OTHER TEMPLES.
Near Pechaburi is a cavern, or series of small caves,
called the Cave of Idols. One or two small openings in
the ceiling permit the light to enter. Rows of gilt Bud
dhas line its sides, and a huge reclining image of Buddha
lies at one end of the halls. Just outside of the cave, and
at the bottom of the hill, is a temple containing another
immense reclining Buddha. This is built of brick and
mortar, covered with thick gold-leaf. It is clothed with yellow garments, such as the Siamese and Burmese Bud
dhist priests wear. Its head rests upon the right hand and presses upon a gayly-ornamented pillow. The idol
is 135 feet high.
We notice that very many of these immense reclining
idols of Buddha are found in Siam alone.
There are 3,000,000 of Chinese in Siam, who are Bud
dhists and have their own temples. The largest of these
is in Bangkok, and contains a brass Buddha, sitting cross
legged, and about fifty feet high, and forty feet wide at
the knees. The immense temple roof is 100 feet from
the ground. In a smaller temple, in the same inclosure,
is another brass Buddha, seated upon a rock, with a
copper elephant on one side and a leaden monkey on the
other, looking up, in reverence, at the idol Buddha. When the King of Siam dies, the funeral ceremonies
are participated in by the nation. During about four
months, 300 or 400 men are engaged in building the
funeral temple. The funeral pile, on which the body is
to be burned, is placed in the centre, and the temple



BUDDHISM IN SIAM. rgy
built around and above it. Its style is similar to other
Siamese temples. The trunks of teak trees, not less than
170 feet high, are placed upright so as to form a square
about thirty ieet each way. On this is built an octagonal,
sixty-foot spire, covered with gold-leaf Around this
central building poles are erected, on which are hung
peculiar ornaments covered with crimson cloth. Around
the interior are grouped pictures of the gods and of the
Buddhist's heaven, with lakes, groves and gardens. All around the temple is a screen of woven bamboo work,
and the g^round is covered with the same. The whole
exterior of the temple is decorated with objects of glass,
porcelain, alabaster and silver, with artificial flowers and
images of birds, beasts, men and angels. Splendid chan
deliers are suspended from the ceiling. Under the cen
tral tower is a pyramidal pile, on which the body is to be burned. Thousands of priests are engaged in prayers
during the service. The scene and service at such a
time is impressive beyond the power of description.

^ f "^HIBET i.s a country lying north of India and west
I of China. It has a. population of about six mil
^- lions. The early worship of the Thibetans was
that of spirits, devils and of nature. The old worship,
called the Bon religion, bore a strong resemblance to the Taoism of China, and even to-day Buddhism has not
destroyed that old religion entirely. The people still
have gods of the hills, trees, dales and lakes, and still use charms and resort to magic. Just when Buddhism
was introduced into this branch of the Mongolian family
we cannot tell, but it certainly was not well-established
until 630 A. D. All around Thibet Buddhist missiona
ries had gone long before this, and it is probable that,
there is some myth in the tradition that a few missiona
ries toiled, thougrh in vain, to brlnsf the Thibetans to the
Buddhist belief. At the beginning of the fifth century

Fa-Hian, the Chinese monk, made a pilgrimage to the sacred places of Buddhism in India. He and his four
companions were forced to avoid crossing Great Thibet.
SKETCH Ol-- THE HLSTORY OF *LAMA]SM.
A Thibetan king established his seat of government
ac H'lassa in 617 A. D. He married a Chinese princess ol the Buddhist
faith. By her re
quest, he sent a
minister to India, whobrouo^htback
with him a great number of the Buddhist sacred
books. The king
had great diffi
culty in ov,ercom
ingthe objections
of both priests
and people, but
finally succeeded. About the middle
of the fourteenth
century a great reformer arose in Thibet named
Tsong-khapa.
He forbade the
priests to marry,
and declared that magic and necro
mancy were against Buddhism, and introduced other changes. Another great reformer lived about the same

time named Gedeen-tubpa ; he built the great monastery at Teshu Lumbo in 1445, and in him commenced the
perpetual incarnation of Buddha, in the persons of the
Grand Lamas. In 1650 the sixth successor of this last
reformer visited the Emperor of China, and accepted
from him the desio-nation of Dalai Lama, Lama meaning
priest, and Dalai, ocean. There are several rival Grand Lamas, the Dalai Lama, the Teshu Lama and the Taranath Lama. There rapidly grew up in Thibet a system
of organized priesthood, which has made the Buddhism
of Thibet almost altogether unlike that of any other land.
^
MONKS AND MONASTERIES.
There are the monks and clergy, who are subordinate to the holy and sacred Lamas, the monks and nuns, the
abbots and abbesses, chief Lamas, and, over all, the Grand Lama. The monks go bareheaded, though those of high
rank wear caps ; their heads
are shaved, and they are dress
ed in a yellow robe and high
leathern boots, with the men
dicant's food-bowl and the
prayer-wheel in their hands.
They are collected in vast mon
asteries scattered over the
country, the largest and most numerous being round the city
of H'lassa. These monasteries contain many thousands of la
mas, and similar establish
ments are scattered not only in
the inhabited valleys, but over the wild(;st parts of Great

Thibet. As there is Uttle wood in the country, the people
rarely burn their dead. The dead bodies are usually carried to a high mountain, to be devoured by beasts and
birds. The monks' bodies are, however, burned, and their
ashes carefully gathered as relics. Women are not buried
or exposed with the bodies of their dead husbands, as
was once the case with Hindu women. In fact, this is
rendered impossible by the existence of polyandry, one woman in Thibet
generally having many husbands. The monaste
ries are called
Gonpas ; the La
mas' house, Labrang ; and the

alms-dish ; the body painted yellow or gilt, and the hair
short and curly and painted blue. They are of all sizes,
and there are other imaores of beings connected widi
Buddhistic ideas.
The services consist of recitations and chanting of the
Sutras, or precepts and rules of discipline, to the sound
ot musical instruments, trumpets, drums, cymbals and
conch-shells. The tunes are impressive and solemn
;
incense is burned during the services, and there are offer
ings of fruits and erain to Buddha and to the Buddhisa
twas, especially to Avaloki-teswara, who is incarnate in
the Dalai Lama. Mystical sentences and titles of Bud
dha are also recited. The bell is used during the per
formance of service, and the prayer-wheels—metal cylin
ders, containing printed prayers in rolls, with the axes
prolonged to form handles—are in constant use, not only
during the service, but on every occasion, being fixed in
rows on the walls of temples, near villages, and in streams,
to be turned by water. The prayer-wheels have been in use among these people for more than a thousand years,
for they are mentioned by the pilgrim Fa-Hian.

about eight feet high standing, but they are all, except
the image of the god of war and another, sitting cross

ered with mantles, and crowns or mitres on their heads
;
and altogether, particularly the drapery, are far from
being badly executed. The thrones upon which they sit
are also of copper-gilt, adorned with turquois, cornelians
and other inferior stones. The mouldings and orna



LAMAISM, THE BUDDHISM OF THIBET. 503
ments of the thrones are in a good style. Behind each
figure the wall is covered with a piece of carved work,
like unto the heavy gilt frames of our forefathers' por
traits or looking-glasses. Behind them are china vases,
some of them very handsome ; loads of china and glass
ware, the last partly Chinese, partly European, filled with
grain, fruit or gum flowers, a variety of shells, large
conches set in silver, some ostrich eggs, cocoanuts, cym
bals, and a variety of other articles, making a most heterogeneous gathering. Round the necks of the images are
strings of coral, ill-shaped pearls, cornelian, agate and
other stones, and their crowns are set with the like orna
ments. The ceiling of the gallery is covered with satins
of a variety of patterns, some Chinese, some Kalmuk, some European, brought through Russia and overland.
The gallery is lighted on the south side from five win
dows, and the walls between are hung with paintings of the
different deities and views of heaven. The opposite side,
where the images are, is shut in all the length of the gal
lery with a net of iron-work that meddlers may be kept off.

•as follows
:
The entrance to the chief temples of the holy city is
through a large hall where holy water and rosaries are
sold, and in which stand four statues of the archangels.
The walls are covered with rude paintings of scenes from
the legends of Buddha, and its roof is supported by six
massive pillars, covered with beautiful carving, spoilt by
gorgeous paint and gilding. The temple itself is a long
nave, divided by rows of pillars from two aisles, and by

silver screens of open trellis-work from two large chan
cels. Into the aisle on each side open fourteen chapels
;
at the end is the holy place. In its furthest niche, in a
kind of apse, is the magnificent golden statue of the now
deified Gautama Buddha. In front of the idol is the high
altar or table of offerings, raised by several stages from
the floor; on the upper levels being images of gold, sil
ver and clay; on the lower, the bells, lamps, censers and
other vessels used in the holy service. At the sound of
a trumpet the clergy assemble in the entrance hall, wear
ing the cloak and cap ; at its third blast the procession,
with the living Buddha, the Grand Lama, at its head,
marches down the aisle. When he is seated on his
throne, each Lama, or cardinal, bows three times before
him, and then seats himself on a divan according to his
rank. After a bell is rung, the ten Buddhist command
ments are repeated and other formulas, then the priests
sing in choir pieces from the sacred books. The monks
burst out into a hymn of prayer for the presence of the
spirits of all the Buddhists. One of them raises aloft
over his head a looking-glass, the idea of which seems to
be to catch the image of the spirit as it comes ; a second
raises a jug ; a third a mystic symbol of the world ; a
fourth a cup, and so on. Meanwhile the voices of the
singers, and the sound of the bells, drums and trumpets
grows louder and louder, and the temple is filled with
incense from the sacred censers. The monk with the jug
pours several times water, mixed with saffron and sugar,
over the mirror, which another wipes each time with a
silk napkin. The water flows over the mirror to the
symbols of the world, and is caught in the cup beneath. Thence the holy mixture is poured into another jug, and
a drop or two is allowed to trickle on to the hands of each of the worshiping monks, who marks the crown of

sacred Hquid. ' He then reverently swallows the remain
ing drops, and, in so doing, believes himself to be swal
lowing a part of the divine being, whose image has been
caught in the mirror over which the water has passed.
PRAYING-WHEELS.
Among the most curious things in Thibet are the
praying-wheels. They are little wooden drums covered
round the sides with leather, and fitted
vertically in niches in the walls. A
spindle running through the centre
enables them to revolve at the slight
est push. They are generally in rows
of eight and ten, and well thumbed
and worn they usually are. Others, of
larger dimensions, are placed by
themselves, decorated with the words, •" Om mani padmi hum," in the Lanza
character, all round the barrel.
In the vicinity of the monasteries
are various small temples, like chapels
of ease, rudely decorated with gro- praying machine.

THE MYSTIC SENTENCE OF THIBET.
There is one sentence which the Thibetans and Mon
golians have continually in their mouths. The same
sentence is written upon their
monuments, temple-walls, rel
ic-houses, prayer-wheels—indeed, almost everywhere. It is CM MANI PADMI HUM. These are words from the Sanskrit language. " Om," among the Hindus, is the mys
tic name of divinity, which
begins all their prayers. It
corresponds to our interjec
ll tion Oh ! only that it is uttered
I with a religious emphasis, due
I to its hidden, sacred meaning.
Mani " means jewel ; " pad
-'- mi," the lotus; and "hum,"
PRAYING WHEEL WHIRLED IN THE amen. So the whole scntencc
HAND. .
is, " Oh ! the jewel of the lotus,
Amen." But the Thibetan Buddhists haveattached myste
rious meanings to each of the six syllables of the sentence.
These meanings grew out of the legendary history of the
introduction of Buddhism into Thibet; but even this is
all but forgotten, and the words are repeated by the mil
lions of Thibetans without the slio-htest knowledge of their
force, but with a superstitious belief in their sacredness,
which is unshaken and immovable as the rocks themselves^



LAMAISM, THE BUDDHISM OF THIBET. 607
THE INCARNATION OF BUDDHA IN THE GRAND LAMA.
The Thibetans beUeve that the soul of Buddha dvveUs
in the body of their high-priest or Grand Lama ; that, at
the time of his
death, the soul
passes into the
body of another
person, who is to
be the Grand La
ma until his death.
Thus Buddha is born and re-born
over and over
again. It is an
easy matter to determine into whose body the soul of Buddha enters, because they make it so.
It is very much the same as if the chief Lamas were to
elect the Grand Lama's successor, because, in reality, they
determine where the soul of Buddha shall be found. At present, however, it seems that the Emperor of China
exercises a paramount influence on the discovery of these
transmigrations, or, in other words, on the filling up of
clerical posts ; and there can be no doubt that his influ
ence is supreme in the case of determining the election
of the two highest functionaries of this theocracy. In or
der to ascertain the re-birth of a departed Lama, various means are relied upon. Sometimes the deceased had,
before his death, confidentially mentioned to his friends
where and in which family he would re-appear, or his will

however, the sacred books and the official astrologers are
consulted on the subject ; and if the Dalai-lama dies, it is
the duty of the Pan-chhen to

saint, usually a boy four or five years old, is questioned
as to his previous career; books, garments and other
articles used and not used by the deceased are placed
before him, to point out those which belonged to him in
his former life. But, however satisfactory his answers
be, they do not yet suffice. Various little bells, required
at the daily devotions of the Lama, are put before the
boy, to select that which he did use when he was the

and this question is perfectly justified, for, to test the
veracity of the re-born saint, this particular bell has been
withheld from him. Now, however, there can be no
doubt as to the Dalai-lama or Pan-chhen being- bodily

Lamas who successfully performed all these frauds join them in announcing to the world the momentous fact.

The art of printing trom engraved wooden blocks has
been long known to the Thibetans. This aided greatly
in spreading the sacred books. There is no Buddhist
monastery in Thibet which has not a copy of these works. Sometimes these are very costly; one was prepared about
a quarter of a century ago, which cost ;^io,ooo. Four or
five years ago a magnificent copy of Buddha's works was being executed ior a Mongol prince, in the Thibetan language. At that time So of the i8o volumes were

not receive official recognition and did not really take

translated the principal Buddhist books into the Chinese.
He was assisted by 800 priests. More than 300 volumes were thus prepared.
At this time the celebrated Chinese traveler, Fa Hien,
was collecting sacred books and visiting sacred places in
India. He went by land as far as Ceylon, and returned
from that island by sea after an absence of fifteen years.

This journey furnishes an illustration of the intelligent
earnestness of the Chinese Buddhists of this period.
From the years 420 A. D. to 451, the Buddhists suffered
opposition on the part of the ruling Tartar family of the
Wei dynasty. In the year 526 A. D., the famous Bodhidharma came to Canton. He was received with great honor at the court of the Emperor of Southern China.
The emperor said to him : "From my accession to the
throne, I have been incessantly building temples, tran

scribing sacred books, and admitting new monks to take
the vows. How much merit may I be supposed to have accumulated?" The reply was : "None." The emperor:
"And why no merit?" The patriarch: "All this is but
the insignificant effect of an imperfect cause not complete
in itself. It is the shadow that follows the substance, and
is without real existence." The emperor: "Then what
is true merit?" The patriarch: "It consists in purity
and enlightenment, depth and completeness, and in being

emptiness, nothing can be called 'holy' [shing)." The
emperor: "Who is he that thus replies to me ?" The
patriarch: 'T do not know." The emperor—says the
Buddhist narrator—still remained unenlightened.
Bodhidharma, not being satisfied with the result of his
interview with royalty, crossed the river Yang-tsze into the Wei kingdom and remained at Lo-yang. Here he
sat with his face to a wall for nine years. The people called him the "Wall-gazing Brahmin." When it was
represented to the emperor of the house of Liang, that
the great teacher, who possessed the precious heir-loom of Shakya, the symbol of the hidden law of Buddha, was lost to his kingdom, he repented and sent messengers to
invite him to return. They failed in their errand. The
presence of the Indian sage excited the more ardent Chinese Buddhists to make great efforts to conquer the
sensations. Thus one of them, we are told, said to him
self: "Formerly, for the sake of religion, men broke open their bones and extracted the marrow, took blood from
their arms to give to the hungry, rolled their hair in the
mud or threw themselves down a precipice to feed a famishing tiger. What can I do?" Accordingly while
snow was falling, he exposed himself to it till it had
risen above his knees, when the patriarch observing him, asked him what he hoped to gain by it. The young
aspirant to the victory over self wept at the question, and
said: "I only desire that mercy may open a path to save
the whole race of mankind." The patriarch replied, that
such an act was not worthy of comparison with the acts
of the Buddhas. It required, he told him, very litde virtue
or resolution. His disciple, stung with the answer, took
a sharp knife, severed his arm, and placed it before the
patriarch. The latter expressed his high approval of the
deed, and when after nine years' absence he returned ta^

Strange act to succeed him as patriarch in China.
PAGODAS.
The word Pagoda has been apphed by French and Portuguese authors to temples where images are wor
shiped and priests hve, but English writers confine the
word to the high, tapering polygonal structures seen in
China, which are called ioiirs by the French. Etymo
logically, the word signifies "house of idols," or "abode
of God," being derived from the Persian words but, an
idol, and kada/i, a house, a temple. Some of the pagodas
are built upon hill-tops and other places for the purpose
of securing the prosperity of the locality by the laws of
geomancy. These latter are not used for worshiping in.
Some authors use interchangeably the words dagaba
and pagoda. Exactness with reference to Oriental terms
is very difficult to attain. The same word is not unfre
quently used among the natives themselves, to denote
different objects, and travelers frequently confound the
terms and use them confusedly. We aim at the highest
precision. Dagabas are lofty, tapering, cylindrical build
ings, erected over a relic of Buddha, thoueh sometimes
pagodas also are used for keeping the relics of Buddha.
The pagoda at Tung Cho, near Peking, has thirteen
stories, and is 150 feet high: its base is forty feet in
diameter. It stands near the northern wall of the city,
and is the most conspicuous object to be seen for many
miles around the place Once a year it is the custom,
in some cities, to illuminate the pagodas. A large
number of paper lanterns are used, each having a lamp
or common candle in it. The priests hang the lighted
lanterns at each corner of each story of the pagoda.
At Nanking there stood, a short time since, a cele

brated pagoda, called the "Porcelain Tower." This
tower was of equal stories, the lower one being 1 20
feet around. It rested upon a solid foundation of brick
work, ten feet high, up which a flight of twelve steps led
to the tower. A spiral staircase led to the top, which
was 260 feet from the ground. The body of the tower
was of brick ; this was encased with tiles of glazed por
celain of green, red, yellow and white, and various other
colors. The stories had projecting roofs, which were
covered with green tiles, and seventy-two bells were suspended from each corner. These bells were rung by
the wind, and sent their tinkling tones down among
the busy crowds below. In the interior were hundreds
of little gilded images. The tower was commenced 1430
A. D., and finished in 1 449 A. D. It was totally de
stroyed by the Tae-Ping rebels about i860.
CHINESE BUDDHIST TEMPLES.
The temples of the Buddhists, in China, are of varied
construction. Very many of them bear evidences of ne
glect and decay. In the cities and their suburbs, along
the highways, standing alone by the roadside or on the
hill-tops, are thousands of these edifices, called joss
houses by foreigners, in which are idols of every descrip
tion, before which incense is burning. These temples
are devoted to the worship of various deities, as the god
dess of sailors, the god of war, the gods of special neigh
borhoods or occupations. Generally at the entrance of
the temple drums or bells are placed. These are struck
by the worshipers as they enter, either to call the atten
tion of the gods to the worship about to be begun, or to
summon the attendant priests. Elijah taunted the priests
of Baal, when they gashed themselves before their altar
on Mount Carmel, as they shouted to the sun, as it rose

majestically in the heavens, calling him to come and con
sume their offerings. He suggested that perhaps their
god, Baal, was asleep, and needed to be awakened by a
noise, or that he might be away on a journey and needed
to be recalled. So the Chinese worshipers seem to deem
it necessary to arouse their gods to hear their prayers.
On entering the temple, the worshiper faces the idols,
which are generally in a sitting posture, on a platform

about five feet from the floor. Guarding the entrance,
generally, there are two gigantic images standing, facing
each other. Sometimes, as in the temple of the Kushan
Monastery, there are four statues ; these represent the
ministers of Buddha. The first has black eyes, and a
fierce countenance, intended to strike awe to the heart;
he holds a huge, drawn sword in his hands; a horrible,
black, dwarfish figure crouches beneath his feet. The

second is a merry god, playing on a guitar. The third
stands with an unfolded umbrella. The fourth holds in
one hand a struggling serpent, in the other a ball. Gen
erally, there are three images of Buddha, seated side by
side, in a sort of pavilion; these are called the "Three
Precious Ones,"— Buddha past, present and to come. The Chinese who have come to America have brought
with them their idolatries, so that heathen temples have
been opened for worship of idols, even in this Christian
land. As most of these Chinese are in San Francisco,
the largest Buddhist temple in America is to be found
there. The three idols of Buddha are seated under a

lacquered canopy. Before them is a sort of altar, on
which is a vessel of ashes, in which the incense-sticks are
placed. Beside this is a shallow dish, filled with pebbles
and water, and the narcissus (daffodil) plant growing in
it. In front of the altar stands a large Chinese table, on
which five bronze vases are placed—the end ones for
flowers, the central for the symbols of the three Buddhas,
and the others for candles. The central figure of the 38



626 £J?A'OJ?'S CHAINS.
three idols represents tJie Buddha, the Intelligence ; the
one to his right is Dharma, the Law, and the other is
Sangha, the Priesthood. Beside the main pavilion is the shrine of Kwan-Yin, the goddess of mercy and the queen of Heaven. The idols in Chinese temples range from
six to twelve feet high, and are mostly made of wood,
covered with gilt. Sometimes they are of bronze, wood
or stucco, gilded, and of gigantic size. Crowds of sec
ondary divinities are ranged round the walls of the
temples. The worship in the temples is very simple.
The worshiper first presents an offering of money or rice,
then prostrates himself on his mat, before the idols, rub
bing the palms of his hands together, telling his beads and mumbling his prayers. The people are coming and
going all the day long, for the temples are never shut. In Peking is a temple called the "Temple of the Thousand Lamas." In Canton is the " Temple of the Five Hundred Gods." These are the "Arhans," or scholars
of Buddha. As a temple, it is much like all the other
Chinese temples, but it differs from all in the images of
the deified disciples of Buddha. These are life-size, sit
ting on their heels, in Oriental style, each exhibiting the
wonderful act for which he has been deified. The eyes

THE WORSHIP OF KWAN-VIN.
Kwan-Yin, the goddess of mercy, is worshiped with
great pomp on the nineteenth day of the second month,
which is the anniversary of her birth, and also on the
anniversaries of her death and canonization. The story
of the career of this canonized Buddhist nun is full of
marvels, and it is scarcely possible to enter her temples
without finding women and children in them. On her
anniversaries, women resort to them in large numbers,
and light incense-sticks at the sacred lamp above the altar.
They carry the burning incense to their homes, as the
smoke is supposed to possess a purifying effect. Other
votaries, who have sick relatives, expose tea to the smoke,
which rises in clouds from the incense burning on the
altar. On their return home they administer the tea to
the sick. Kwan-Yin is also much worshiped during the Tsing-Ming, or Worshiping of Graves, as she is supposed
to extend her protecting care over the souls of departed
ones. Paper representations of clothes, houses, servants
and sedan chairs, fashioned of the same material, are at
such a season burnt in front of her altars. The goddess
is supposed to convey these offerings to the departed
spirits for whom they are intended. The ceremony Is
usually performed at midnight. At this season, also,
ladies resort to her temples to pray for afflicted husbands
or children. The form of worship observed on such
occasions is conducted by Buddhist priests. Two tables
are placed, about six feet apart, in front of the idol, and
fruits and flowers are arranged upon them as offerings.
The ladies sit or kneel near the tables, and the priests march round them to slow music. The music quickens,
and at last the priests are found careering round the
tables. This absurd service Is brought to a close by the

portant of these, at Canton, were at one time several
ornaments of great value, which had been presented to the goddess by the Emperor Taou-kwang, in return for
blessings which she was supposed to have conferred on
the southern portion of the empire. One of these was a
jade-stone ornament of great value, which was presented in acknowledgment of a victory which the goddess was supposed to have given to the Chinese troops over the
British barbarians, as they are called, in 1841.
THE WORSHIP OF KUM-FA.
Another goddess who is popular with Chinese wives is Kum-Fa, the tutelary goddess of women and children.
A native of Canton, she flourished during the reign of
Ching-hwa, who ascended the throne A. D. 1465. When
a girl of tender years, she was a constant and regular
visitor to all the temples in her immediate neighborhood. She is said to have had the power of communing with
the spirits of the departed. Becoming at length tired of
the world, she committed suicide by drowning. In course
of time, her body rose to the surface of the water, and when it was taken out the air became impregnated with
sweet-smelling odors. It was placed in a coffin, and a
sandal-wood statue or idol of Kum-Fa rose apparently
from the bed of the river, and remained stationary. A
temple was erected for the image, but an iconoclast de
liberately destroyed it by fire, and it Is now replaced by
a clay figure. Her principal temple stands on the south
side of the river at Canton. Her votaries are mostly wives
who desire to become mothers. The list of the duties
which her ministering attendants divide among them is
a complete summary of the'art of rearing children. One
is considered to be the guardian of children suffering

male or female children, in answer to their prayers. The

fifteenth to teach them how to suck. The sixteenth
watches over unborn babes. On the seventeenth, it de
volves to see that their bodies are, immediately before
birth, free from sores or ulcers. The eighteenth is re

IDOLS.
In some of the temples the idols are very numerous,
and in Yang-chow there is one in which there are said to be no fewer than 10,000. The idols,
which are very diminutive, are con
tained in one large hall, and in their
fanciful, but orderly arrangement,
present a very singular appearance.
In the centre of the hall stands a
pavilion of wood, most elaborately
carved, under which is placed a large
idol of Buddha. The pavilion, within
and without, is literally studded with
small idols, which are different rep
resentations of the same deity. On
each of the four sides of the hall are
small brackets, supporting idols o Buddha ; and a still larger number of these are placed on the beams
and pillars of the vaulted roof. Two are
full-sized figures of the sleeping sg Buddha. At Peking- and Can
ton there are halls precisely
similar. The hall of 10,000
idols, at Canton, is, like the
monastery of which it forms a
part, in a most ruinous state,
and the majority of the idols with t* CHINESE IDOL, ^^^hi^h its walls Were at one time c^'^rs^ idol.

In the prefecture of Shu-hing, where marble quarries
abound, idols are in many cases made of that material.
At Pun-new-chan, a market-town on the banks of the
Grand Canal, one sees in a ruined monastery three large
iron idols, representing the Past, Present and Future
Buddhas. There are in certain temples stone, earthen
ware and porcelain figures. The three large idols in the
Tai-fan monastery, at Canton, are said to be made of
copper, and many of the small idols of Buddha are also made of the same material. Buddha is represented in a
variety of postures, and some of the figures have smiling
countenances, whilst others appear decidedly sorrowful.

of them, is the hall of judgment, where the poor wretches are tried. Then comes one chamber where a man is
receiving from the demons a terrible whipping, being stretched on the ground face' downward, by two men,
while a third is beating him with a paddle. The next
cell exhibits a criminal fastened in a frame, head down
ward, and being sawn in two, lengthwise. In the next,
another is suffering the tortures of slow burning ; an
other is supposed to be sitting under a red-hot bell. In
the next there are cages, and some chained with a Chi
nese cangiie ; in another they are being beheaded ; and,
in another, they are ground in a mill and pounded in a
mortar. In the next they are boiling a poor fellow in oil
;
and, in the last, some poor wretches, for having been guilty
of eating beef, are being themselves slow^ly transformed
into oxen. Several figures in this cell present the various
steps of this transformation. In all these cells numerous
figures of demons are looking on with expressions of
diabolical satisfaction, and, strange to say, around the
sides of each of the cells are rano-ed in scenic manner
o
mountain and hillside retreats, on which are seen smaller
figures of the good and saved, seeming to take an equal
delight in witnessing the pains of the unhappy ones who
have missed of paradise. Notwithstanding all these hor
rors, booths are rented out before all these cells, and a
lively traffic is carried on, and the priests themselves
drive a large trade in selling fans, sacrificial money, etc.,
which are to be burned for the use of these suffering
wretches.

friends from purgatory, it will be accomplished, so say the
priests, by means of the sacred lotus-flowers. The clay images in many of the "Temples of Horrors" are some
times made so as to move their limbs and jaws, when a string is pulled by some unseen person. Occasionally
the people meet in great crowds for the purpose of wor
shiping Kwan-Yin, and beseeching her to deliver from
the ten departments of hell those who have no friends to
intercede for them ; then a wholesale delivery is sup
posed to take place. The priests are greatly enriched at
such seasons, and therefore these occasions are numerous.
MONASTERIES.
The monasteries are often embosomed among the hills, and surrounded by groves of bamboo and other trees. These are sometimes in the neighborhood of crowded
cities ; at other times, away in the lonely wilds of the
mountains. They are generally used as temples, as well
as dwellings for the priests. The monasteries have
kitchens, eating-rooms, sleeping apartments and libraries.
Most of the larger monasteries own land, or other prop
erty, from which annual rent, payable in crops or money,
is received. In connection with some of these monas
teries are large bells. These have no tongues, but are
struck on the outside by a ponderous swinging beam.
In some few cases the sound of the bell is not suffered to
cease ; relays of priests' keep it always ringing. In the
monasteries generally, morning worship is held before
daylight, and evening worship about five o'clock in the
afternoon. The service lasts from an hour to an hour
and a half All the priests join in it. The service con
sists, principally, of a chant or recitation of passages
from the Buddhist sacred books, the Sanskrit prayers in
which have been transliterated in Chinese characters.









FOISM, THE BUDDHISM OF CHINA. 649
This is accompanied, not by the music of organs, but by
one or two of the priests beating the time on a hollow
" wooden fish." The chant is impressive, though monoto
nous. Often they move in slow processions about the
room, chanting as they march, and bowing when they
pass and re-pass the image of Buddha.
In the monasteries great attention is paid to comfort.
There are rooms for the reception of officers, for the
common people, study rooms and the room for daily
worship ; in addition, a place is sometimes provided for
keeping living animals. These are not kept for food, but are donated by devotees who send them there. It is a
part of the Buddhist faith not to kill any living creature,
because, if one kills or injures a horse, or any other ani
mal, he may be inflicting suf
fering on his mother, or some
other friend. For the same
reason, the Buddhist priests of China sometimes take care of
sick and wounded animals.
No animal is put to death, but
permitted to die a natural
death, and then is buried.
When you tell the priests that ^^8
the air, water, vegetables or
grain they eat are full of tiny,
living animals, and when you try to show them by the help
of the microscope, they refuse
to believe that they are really animals having organic
life. The Chinese dislike the Buddhist priests, because
they disown the family relation, and yet they patronize
them and follow their teachings with an unquestioning
faith and an implicit obedience.

On the top of the monument is a neat marble urn, and on

Chinese Buddhists, but even the Thibetans, greatly ven
erate this monument. Often they may be seen measur
ing their length on the ground, and in this way proceeding entirely around the monument.
CHINESE BUDDHIST BONZES.
The priests often go in companies of thirty and forty,
dressed in loose, yellow robes of cotton or silk, with a
wide collar, with beads around their necks, begging for
the support of their monasteries. The people will give
them rice, or oil, or, perhaps, " cash," which is the name of the common round Chinese coin, having a square hole
in the centre. The priests shave the hair from their heads,
and often spots on their heads are burnt with coals of fire
so that the hair will never grow again ; this is a badge
of their profession. They never marry, and they leave
their homes forever. They never even sleep in dwelling
houses with other people. They make no friendships, but shut themselves off from the rest of mankind. They
profess to have given up the world and all its pleasures.
They pass their time in chanting from the Buddhist
sacred books. They are employed in private families to
pray for the sick and dying, or for the dead, for which
they are paid. The ranks of the priests are recruited by
buying boys who are trained for the priesthood. Often,
mandarins tired of business, or shopkeepers unsuccessful
in trade, or scholars falling to pass the examinations, will enter the monasteries and become monks, or, perhaps,
priests. There are often priests who retire from the
world altogether, for a time ; who receive their food
through a hole in the wall of their cells. These profess
to give themselves entirely and only to meditation, and



652 EHKOH'S CHAINS.
SO hope to become Buddhas when they die. The bodies
of the priests are usually burned with great ceremony
and are not buried as is the custom prevalent with us.
BUDDHIST DEVOTEES.
Many Buddhist devotees seek to subdue the flesh by
inflicting painful severities on their bodies. One will
meet, frequently, a company of priests, one of whom will
pull up the sleeve of his coat and uncovering an arm
without a hand, beg for alms, assuring you that he had,
by a slow process, burned his hand to the stump, as an atonement for his sins and as a recommendation for his
promotion at some future time to the state of Buddha
hood. At Peking a priest will often be seen sitting in a
sedan 'chair, the interior of which is thickly studded
with sharp nails and spikes, so that he can neither move
nor sleeo. He informs those who stand round his peni
tential chair that the nails acquire a heavenly virtue in
proportion to the misery which they cause him, and
that he is prepared to sell them for a fair price each,
as antidotes against evil. He assures them that he had
resolved to remain in the sedan chair until every nail
has been sold.
At Tien-tsin there formerly lived a priest who had
passed through his cheek a sharp skewer, to the end of
which he had attached a chain. To relieve him of its
weight, some little boys held up the chain —an act whicli
was, of course, regarded as very meritorious. Sometimes
these devotees perform pilgrimages of penance to distant
shrines, traveling hundreds of miles on foot. It is re
markable that the Buddhists should subject themselves
to such self-torture, as Buddha himself on one occasion,
preached a most powerful sermon against self-torture
and all such follies.

and some other inflammable material, or some oil, or a
candle, is put in each. Around the top of the outside of

other pretty plant. Early in the evening, these vessels
are carried in a procession of priests from the place

this is e.Kplained to be, to afford lights for the spirits that
come or go by water. The priests coming to the water
and going from it, on this occasion chant their classics,
and clap their cymbals together, walking along slowly
and in single file. This ceremony is called letting go the
water-lamps.

THE DO-NOTHING SECT OF REFORMED BUDDHISTS.
For about two hundred years there has existed a sect
in China which bears quite a close resemblance to Bud
dhism, and yet differs widely from this faith in that it
opposes idolatry. They are called the Wu-Wei-Kiau, or
"The Do-nothing- Sect." Their central doctrine seems to
be that relitjion does not consist in outward ordinances
an^ ceremonies, but in quiet meditation. They have
temples but no idols. In a discussion with some priests,
who had brought a huge brass Buddha to the court of
the kino-, Lo-tsu, the founder of this sect, said: "A brazen
Buddha melts, and a wooden Buddha burns, when ex
posed to fire. An earthen Buddha cannot save itself
from water. It cannot save itself, then how can it save
me ? In every particle of dust there is a kingdom ruled by Buddha. In every temple the king of the law resides.
The mountains, the rivers, and the great earth form Bud
dha's image. Why, then, carve or mould an image ?"
This sect worships, in addition to Buddha, a goddess
called the Kin-mu, or "golden mother." She is believed
to protect from dangers, from sickness and from the mis
eries of the unseen world. This sect eat only vegetables.
BOOLDO, THE BUDDHISM OF THE COREANS.
Corea is a country lying between China and Japan. Buddhism entered it in 372 A. D., from China. The Coreans have two names for God ; one, a native name, Hannonim, meaning the Heavenly One; the other, the Chinese name, Shang-te. Buddhism is called Booldo in
Corea. The priests or monks, called Joong, are very
numerous ; they are said to form one-fourth of the whole
male population. Their principal images are of brass,
the secondary ones of carved stone ; they have none of

clay. The priests dress in black or gray, while the rest
of the people generally dress in white. They use rosa

trate of each city in Corea. There are two very popular
eods—belonofino- to the old relig-ion that existed in Corea
before Buddhism was introduced—they are the god of the mountains and the jjod of rain. The Buddhists have
four sects in Corea. In their doctrines and general
worship there is but little difference between the Corean
and the Chinese Buddhists. These few notices of Bud
dhism in Corea must be taken with caution, for our infor
mation respecting that secluded country is too imperfect
to enable us \.o describe it fully or with confidence.

BUDDHISM was introduced into Japan in 552 A. D.
By tliis time, the original Buddhism of India had
been very greatly altered. " It now had a vast
and- complicated ecclesiastical and monastic machinery,
a geographirnl and sensuous paradise, definitely-located
hells and purgatories, populated with a hierarchy of titled
demons. Of these, the priests kept the keys, regulated
the thermometers, and timed or graded the torture or
bliss." The Chinese had very greatly modified the Buddhism of India, and the Coreans had still further changed the Buddhism which they had received from China ; and
now, Japan, in her turn, modifies the religion she received
from Corea. The way Avas prepared for the coming of Buddhism to Japan. Shintoism had become an empty, cold system of political management, used as a support
of the eovernment. It had lost its hold on the affections
of the people, and they were heart-hungry for just such
a warm religious system as Buddhism had to offer. In

the year 552, King Petsi, of Corea, sent to Kin-Mei, the
thirteenth Mikado of Japan, a statue of Gautama, together with books, banners, a baldaquin and other objects of
worship. Buddha had said: " My doctrine shall extend
to the East ;" and King Petsi desired to aid in fulfilling
that prophecy. The mikado suffered the statue to re
main ; a chapel was built for it, and worship offered by a
few of the members of the mikado's court. An epidemic
broke out; it was declared that the new image was the cause of it, and the chapel was thereupon burned and the
statue cast into the river.
In the reign of the next mikado, Bidasu, a Buddhist bonze (priest) came over from Corea. He had been
warned of the difficulties before him, but surmounted
them by a pleasant device. When he was presented to
the mikado at his court, he saw his little grandson, a boy
of six years old, at whose birth there had been some ex
traordinary signs. He prostrated himself at the child's
feet, and worshiped him, declaring that he recognized in
him the incarnation of one of Buddha's disciples, the new
patron of the empire. The mikado left the child in the
care of the Corean priest, to be educated by him. As
might be expected, the child became the first high-priest
of Buddhism. Through,his efforts, being so closely related
to the Emperor, the religion spread with greater rapidity,
and soon became the dominant religion of the land.
BODHIDHARMA IN JAPAN.
In Japan, as in India, there have been many ascetics,
noted for their wonderful penances. One of the first and most famous of these is called Bodhidharma, who founded
the Shin-Shin sect of Buddhists. He came from Corea,
in 613 A. D., according to the legend, floating upon a
large lotus-leaf. Kobo Daishi, the inventor of the japa

nese syllabary or alphabet, was a celebrated priest, born
in 774 A. D. Fodaishi was a remarkable inventive genius, who came from China. The priests had been
required to read the " wheel of the law," as it was called,
with great regularity. He constructed a movable desk,
and spread on it the rolls of the sacred books. He
allowed his disciples, instead of reading all the books
through—which would have been a most tiresome task

to give this desk a half or three-quarters of a turn,
counting it as if they had read the books which passed
before them. He and great priests of later days did
much to mix the two religions. Buddhism and Shintoism
together, and thus secure its readier acceptance. The
thirteenth century was the time when Buddhism attained
the height of its prosperity. At this time, many of the
greatest temples were built, and mostof the sects founded.
Of these sects, there are seven chief and some twenty
minor ones, illustrating the utmost diversity.
THE SUN-CHILD AND HIS MIRACULOUS DELIVERANCE.
In 1222, a child was born, who was named Nichiren,
because his mother dreamed that the sun (nichi, in Jap
anese) had entered her. While still a child, he was in
trusted to the care of a priest. As he grew up, he turned
away from all the accepted teachings, and resolved to found a new and purer sect. He changed the common Japanese prayer from "Save us! O Eternal Buddha!"
to "Glory to the salvation -bringing book of the law!"
This prayer is inscribed in the temples of this sect, upon
their tomb-stones and shrines, and was even engraven
on the shields of their warriors. Nichiren was a travel
ing preacher, and he founded many temples. He bitterly
opposed all other Buddhists, and made many bitter ene
mies. The story is thus told by Grlffis: "On a certain

day, he was taken out to a village on the strand of the
bay, beyond Kamakura, and in front ot the lovely island
of Enoshima. This village is called Koshigoye. At
this time, Nichiren was forty-three years old. Kneeling
down upon the strand, the saintly bonze calmly uttered
his prayers, and repeated 'Namu mio ho ren ge kio ' upon
his rosary. The swordman lifted his blade and, with all
his might, made the downward stroke. Suddenly a flood
of blinding light
burst from the sky, and smote both the executioner and
the official inspec

in pieces, while the
holy man was unharmed. At the same moment, Ho

though there was not a cloud in the sky. Dazed by the
awful signs of Heaven's displeasure, Hojo Tokoyori,
divining that it was on account of the holy victim, in
stantly dispatched a fleet messenger to stay the execu
tioner's hand, and reprieve the victim Simultaneously,
the official inspector, at the still unstained blood-pit, sent
a courier to beg reprieve for the saint whom the sword
could not touch. The two men, coming from opposite

direction^, met at the small stream which the tourist still crosses on the way from Kamakura to Enoshima, and it
was thereafter called Yukiai (meeting on the way) River, a
name which it retains to this day. Through the pitiful
clemency and intercession of Hojo Tokimuni, son of the
Lord of Kamakura, Nichiren was sent to Sado Island.
He was afterward released by his benefactor, in a gen
eral amnesty. Nichiren founded his sect at Kioto, and it
greatly flourished under the care of his disciple, his rev
erence, Nichizo. After a busy and holy life, the great
saint died at Ikegami, a little to the north-west of the Kawasaki Railroad station, between Yokohama and To
kio, where the scream of the locomotive and the rumble
of the railway car are but faintly heard in the solemn
shades. There are to be seen gorgeous temples, pagodas,
shrines, magnificent groves and cemeteries. The dying
presence of Nichiren has lent this place peculiar sanctity;
but his bones rest on Mount Minobu, in the province of
Kai, where was one of his homes when in the flesh."
The disciples of Nichiren drank in their master's
spirit, and they long continued the most poAverful sect of the Buddhists in Japan. The Shin sect, which was
brought to great strength by Shinran in 1262 A. D., dis
carded fasting, penances, pilgrimages, separation from
society, nunneries and monasteries, and taught salvation
by faith in Buddha, and not by works. They use the
sacred Buddhist books in a translation into Japanese,
while the other sects used the (to them) unintelligible
Sanskrit and Chinese. Their temples are built mainly
in crowded cities. Their priests marry, and their sons
succeed them in ofifice. This sect wields a vast influence
over the religious life of the people. To these two men,
Shinran and Nichiren, and their missionary labors, the
great progress of Buddhism in Japan is due.

FURTHER HISTORY OF BUDDHISM IN JAPAN.
The books and idols were brought from Corea in 552.
In 584 several of the nobles at court professed faith in
the new religion. In 585 the pestilence broke out, and
ithe progress of Buddhism seemed to be checked. In 741 an imperial decree was given that two temples and
a seven-storied pagoda be built in each province. This
would seem to indicate the establishment of Buddhism
an Japan. But, from the time (800) when Kobo Daishi showed that, according to Buddhism, patriotism and
piety were one, and that the Shinto gods were but Japa
nese manifestations of Buddha, it grained a sure foothold
in Japan; the religion spread more and more extensively,
luntil the fourteenth century, when the zeal of Nichiren, Shinran and their co-workers were somewhat forgotten.
Many of the largest Buddhist temples now standing were
t)uilt in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and are
therefore, five or six hundred years old. In the four
teenth century the great majority of the soldiers were
Buddhists. Images of Buddha were sewed into their hel
mets ; texts from the sacred books were woven into their
banners ; and amulets or charms, with sacred characters
written on the papers within them, were worn as a pro
tection in battle.
From the year 1570 Nobunaga, a famous warrior, ap
pears as a persecutor of the Buddhists. The Buddhists were then very powerful ; they had enormous monas
teries and stone-walled and moated fortresses. The

BUDDHIST SECTS IN JAPAN.
Buddhism in Japan is broken up into many sects.
These sects differ greatly, much more than even Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. For a time they waged
bitter wars arainst each other, and sou^jht to exterminate
each other.
W. E. Griffis has prepared the following tabular list of
Buddhist sects in Japan:

According to the census taken in japan in 1S72, there
was a population of 33,110,825. Of these there were
75,925 priests, abbots and monks: 9 abbesses; 37,327
novices preparing to become monks or priests ; and
98,585 religious devotees were gathered in monasteries.
These last are mostly of the Shin sect. In 1875 the
census showed a decrease of over 4,000 of these religietLx.
Besides the seven chief sects above mentioned, there are
twenty-one "irregular," "local" or "iiidependent" sects,
which act apart from the others, and in some cases have
no temples or monasteries. A number of other sects
have originated in Japan, flourished for a time, decayed
and passed out of existence. Mr. Griffis estimates that
rt took 900 years to convert the Japanese from their
nature-worship to Buddhism.

THE PROTESTANTS OF BUDDHISM.
The members of the Shin sect, founded in 121 3, some
times called the Shinshin, at other times the Monto
sect, are the Protestants of Japanese Buddhism. They
protested and still protest against penance, fasting, pil
grimages, convents and monasteries, hermitages, charms, amulets and the reading of the Buddhist sacred books in

an unknown tongue. Its founder, the priest Shinran,
married a noble lady of Kioto. The Monto priests always
marry and oppose the celibacy of the priesthood. This is
the most thoroughly organized and earnestly aggressive
of all the Buddhist sects of Japan. Its priests are wideawake and active. Two of them have been studying the
Sanskrit language with the famous Professor Max Muller,

books, which are written in this tonu'ue. One of the tore

burner. An incense-burner was the only object on the
low altar. Besides these there were six black lacquer
desks, on each desk a roll of litanies, and above the altar
six lamps burned low. It was imposingly magnificent. The Japanese have a proverb: 'As handsome as a
Monto altar.'
"
This sect rejects images and all sensuous paraphernalia
addressed to the popular taste. The Creed of the Monto sect is thus given by Aka
matz : " Rejecting all religious austerities and other ac
tions, giving up all idea of self-power, rely upon Amita
Buddha with the whole heart for our salvation, which is
the most important thing; believing that at the moment
of putting one's faith in Amita Buddha our salvation is
settled.
" From that moment invocation of his name is observed
to express gratitude and thankfulness for Buddha's
mercy. Moreover, being thankful for the reception of
this doctrine from the founder and succeeding chief
priests, whose teachings are as kind and welcome as the
light in a dark night.
"We must also keep the laws which are fixed for our
duty during our whole life."
kwanon's temple at asakusa, tokio.
Tokio, the eastern capital of Japan, is the most thickly
populated city of the empire. It has a very large number
of temples and shrines. The most famous and popular of all is the temple of Kwanon, at Asakusa. Asakusa is
really one great play-ground, with the temple in the
centre. The people gather there for pleasure as well
as worship. The approach to the temple is by a long
lane, from twelve to fifteen feet wide, and is lined with
booths, stalls and shops, in which toys and articles of



674 EHJiOA'S CHAINS.
ornament and the like are sold. It is always holiday
time here. The toys, dolls and all manner of playthings
are displayed in wonderful variety. The shops are open
all along their fronts, and the toys are arranged on steps,
rising as they were farther and farther from the front, so
that everything in the shops could be seen at a glance.
The Japanese are a very domestic people, and think a
great deal of their children, and often when they go to
the temple to worship they take the children with them,
and purchase toys, games, puzzles or dolls for them at
these booths. Inside the temple-grounds are "tea
houses," as they are called, where the people sit to quaff
the tea from tiny cups, while they listen to some inter
esting tale, as it is told by the story-tellers. The story
tellers are a regular profession in Japan. Jugglers and
gymnasts, painters and play-actors are doing their best
to amuse the worshipers. Little stands are erected,
where beans (Japanese peanuts) are being roasted, where
savory stews are being prepared, where barley sugarcandy is being pulled, or where sweetmeats are being
prepared for litde purchasers. It is astonishing to see
the manifold ways in which amusements are provided,
and all is in connection with the temple services. The
owners of the booths, etc., all pay a percentage of their
profits to the priests. Just before coming into the temple
proper, one passes through a huge red gateway, having a compartment on each side of the doorway. In these
compartments are two gigantic wooden images, painted
red. They are two of the guardians of Heaven, defending
the passage-way, to keep out evil spirits. The Idols are
protected by wire screens, such as are used to protect
store windows. To these gratings huge straw sandals
are tied. They are the offerings of the worshipers for
the use of the gods. On New Year's Eve the priests are

protection of Kwanon to such who shall be so fortunate
as to secure one. They throw them in the air, their
servants fanning them, so as to distribute them the more
thoroughly, and the great, surging crowds struggle in
their search of them. Inside the gateway are more
booths ; these are for the sale of the objects to be used in
worship —idols, rosaries, candles, domestic altars and the
like. Here, in a little stable on the left of the way, is an
Albino pony. This is for the use of the goddess Kwanon.
Eachmorningthe priests lead the pony before the goddess,
and ask her if she does not wish to take a ride. At a
large table near by, an old woman sells large beans, which
the pious worshiper buys and give to the sacred white
horse for food. He has a priest to attend him. On
another table the worshiper purchases a small dish of beans, which he throws on the ground, and immediately flocks of pigeons sweep down and eat them. These are
sacred pigeons, to whom the right of using the temple and
all its buildings is given. Within the temple-grounds, and surrounding the temple of Kwanon, are some forty or
fifty sacred buildings, temples and shrines, devoted to
the worship of almost all the national gods—shrines of
Sanno, the ruler-god; Dai-Koku, the rice god; Benten, goddess of harmony ; Hachiman, god of war ; and even
of the fox are to be found here. The fox is worshiped
because of the mischief he can do. His litde chapel is on
the summit of a knoll ; just before it are two granite
images of the fox, representing him in a sitting posture,
with his eyes on every one approaching his sanctuary.
The faithful bow, cast their coins in the box placed here
for that purpose, kneel in prayer, hang up their offerings,
and turn away. Near the central temple is a seven
storied pagoda, symbolizing the supremacv of Buddhism.
From the eaves of each story are suspended wind-bells.



JAPANESE BUDDHISM. g^g
We turn to ascend the copper-edged steps of the
central building. This is a plain wooden structure, built
with great solidity, and yet so planned as to be secure
against the frequent earthquakes. Its massive sloping
roof ot gray tiles sweeps up from either side. There are
two main rooms in the temple, a sort of vestibule, where
the worshipers perform their ceremonies, and the screened
shrine of the goddess. The pigeons are perched about
the rafters, and the whole place is noisy and dirty. Huge
lanterns are suspended from the ceiling ; private shrines
are scattered here and there ; the walls are hung with
pictures and white tablets. Around the great red columns
which support the ceiling, and on the wire screens before
the idols, are hung scores of braids of hair of men and
women, presented as offerings to Kwanon. The ceiling is covered with paintings of scenes from Buddha's life.
The worshiper, as he enters, drops a coin in the lap of
an old woman, at the door, who puts a pinch of incense
on the fire burning in a brazier, and passes on to the
front of the altar to pray. The great altar, on which is
the splendid gilt statue of Kwanon, is protected by a
wire screen. Before the screen is a large coffer, extend
ing clear across the front of the altar, with bars across
its top. Into this, before engaging in prayer, each wor
shiper casts a coin. Then he kneels, rubbing the palms
of the hands together, repeating his prayer and telling
his beads. Often one will buy from the priest a written
prayer, put it in the mouth and chew it into pulp and
then throw the "spit-ball" at the screen. If it sticks, he
believes that his prayer will be heard ; if it falls, he expects it to fail ! Men, women and children, shop-keepers
and soldiers, peasants and princes, country and city folks,
are all the time coming and going. After worshiping at
the main altar, the devotee often turns to the side altars



68o ERJWK'S CHAINS.
or to some of the shrines. At the right of the altar sits an
ugly wooden idol, perched up on a table. He rivals even
the main altar in the number of worshipers that throng
to touch him. He is the god Binzuru, one of Buddha's
si.xteen disci
ples who is re
puted to cure

the idol. So constant has been the rubbing that the idol,



JAPANESE BUDDHISM. 5gj
though made of hard wood, has lost all its features ; eyes,
nose, lips, ears are all rubbed away. Near by is a stand
where an old woman sells for the priest pictures, or small
shrines of Kwanon, which are exactly like the accompany
ing pictures.
Behind the screen are many smaller idols and altars, and an inclosed matted space, where those who choose
may, by paying an extra fee to the attendant priests,
enter and worship undisturbed. On high days and great
festival occasions, a space near the altar is fenced in, and
the priests, richly dressed, chant their prayers, while in
cense is smoking and candles are flaring. The crowd
presses against the fence, and by making special gifts of
money, secure special prayers for themselves, and extra
candles, representing such prayers, are placed on the
stand for them by the attendants.
To the left of the altar are placed, by the symbols of
the Shinto-worship, the mirror and white paper. This
enables all shades of opinion to be suited.
Outside the building are groves of plum and cherry
trees, which are esteemed not so much for their fruit as
for their blossoms. Here are carefully kept beds of
lotus, azaleas, chrysanthemums, and camellias and evergreens. These evergreens are dwarfed and trimmed into
all sorts of fanciful shapes, even while growing. Trees
many years old are made to represent cats, dogs, boats,
houses, wagons and other objects. Around the bases of
the idols of Buddha, scattered everywhere, are heaps of
small stones, representing prayers offered. A praying
machine—a stone wheel set to run on a stone post

stands close by. There is an exhibition of wax-works,
which would rival Madame Tussaud's, of London. These
are intended to depict various deliverances from dangers and peril, wrought by Kwanon.

terns, each the gift of a Japanese prince, the head of a
clan. Goincf on through another carved and mlded
gateway, another court-yard is entered, having six large
gilt lanterns, each the gift of a prince of the royal family.
Then another gateway, more richly carved and orna
mented than the last, is passed, and the visitor stood be
fore the handsome shrines. The lacquered steps lead
up to gilt doors, which swing open upon a room covered
with the finest white matting. The walls, panels and
beams are covered with sculpture. There the great
altars rise up, resplendent with golden lacquer and sculp
ture. In caskets are placed the tablets of the deceased
shoeouns and rulers. Imag-es of Buddha and Kwanon
are scattered about. One of these idols represents
Buddha on his death-bed. For many years the mikado
lived in Kioto, secluded from the sight of the people.
The real ruler was called shogoun (in later days, termed
tycoon). This functionary lived in Yedo or Tokio. He was accustomed to worship at Shiba. On the great
festival occasions he proceeded there with an immense
retinue, and the services were performed with great
magnificence.
There are very many idols and shrines in the country
places, as well as in the cities. In every hamlet, by the
Toad-sides, among the rice-fields, by the sea-shore, on the
Tiill-tops, by the running streams, in groves of trees or
in niches of the rocks. Generally, the temples are placed
in elevated positions ; these are reached by long flights
of steps. Just outside of Tokio, and commanding a fine
view of the city, is the hill called Atagosa Yama. One
hundred steps lead to the top of this hill ; there, amid the
clumps of cedar and bamboo, are two idols, formerly
much worshiped. They are both Buddhas ; the one is
-Standing on a lotus-flower; the otheris sitting on atortoise.

Kobe is the sea-port town of Osaka. High up on a mountain-peak, near the city, is a famous temple buih by
Jingu Kogo, the Amazonian empress of Japan, after her return from invading Corea. Many hundreds of pilgrims
visit it annually. In Kobe is the shrine of a hero, much
loved and honored by the Japanese. This is one of the means used by the Buddhist priests to intrench them
selves and their religion in the affections of the people.
Immediately, on the death of any hero or noted person
age, they propose erecting a shrine or a monument to
him, thus drawing the devotions of the people anew to
that particular shrine, and through it, to their faith.
TEMPLE OF FIVE HUNDRED GODS.
The temples of the 500 disciples of Buddha are among
the most celebrated in Japan. Of these, there are several

one in Asakusa, and one in Honjo. In one of these, near the main image of Buddha, is an idol of Hachiman,
having three eyes, horns, hoofs and long hair—a curious
combination. In each corner, in iron caees, are the eods
Daikoku and Yebisu. Yebisu is the god of daily food, and has a fish under his arm ; Daikoku, god of wealth,
sits on two sacks of rice, with a mallet in his hand, which,
when he shakes it, is supposed to send wealth to the
worshipers. Great numbers of strips of paper, with
prayers written on them, are tied to the railing before
these gods, and this indicates their popularity. These
images are found in almost every household, and receive
daily worship. The idols are seated under a scroll, on
their throne. Shallow dishes containing oil with floatino
oo
wicks, are placed on either side and lighted. On low
tables are placed loaves of mochi, made of glutinous rice
flour and fishes, and vases containing scrolls. The head

In the Temple of the Five Hundred Gods, there are,,
besides these eods, a statue of Kwanon and images of the
five hundred of Buddha's disciples. On a throne of
weather-stained rocks and pieces of volcanic rock and
lava, is a colossal image of Buddha, seated on the lotus
flower. On either side of him is a statue of an elephant
and of a lion. Next to Buddha is the statue of the dis
ciple who collected all of Buddha's sayings; next, the
disciple who never forgot anything his master taught
him, and so on through all the list. Away in the rear is.

put him, with his pencil in hand, ready to write out the
sentence of the condemned. On either side are those
who keep the records of the misdeeds of men, and, in^
front, the executioner ready to cast the condemned man
from his boat into the lake of fire. In the future state,,
there are, according to the teaching of the Buddhist,
priests, eight modes of torture. "First, the wicked are
alternately beaten and resuscitated ; secondly, they are
dragged limb from limb, chopped to pieces, pounded in a
mortar, sawn or planed into various shapes, eyes gouged out, and the tongue and nails are plucked out ; in the third, the crowd of the wicked are beaten about like animals
in a pen ; the fourth is weeping; the fifth, is great lamen
tation ; the sixth, burning and roasting ; the seventh, hills
covered with larg-e needles, over which the wicked are
driven ; the eighth, being thrown into the bottomless pit
of perdition." These are specimens of the terrors which,
heathenism holds over its followers.

THE CASTING OF A TEMPLE BELL.
Osaka is the greatest commercial city of Japan. In it
are many temples. One of the most beautiful sounds
BELFRY OF THE TEMPLE AT OSAKA, JAPAN.
the traveler ever hears, as he travels in Asia, is the
sound of the temple bells of Japan. They are very large,



692 ERROR'S CHAINS.
and generally sounded by striking a suspended beam
aeainst the bell. Some of these bells are ten feet hio^h.
On their sides are cast or engraven texts from the Bud
dhist sacred books, images of Buddha or Kwanon, or of heavenly beings. The bell was stuck on a knob on its
side by the small tree-trunk. Few sounds are sweeter
than the quivering, mellow tones of the Japanese temple
bells. The bells are often, as in Osaka, placed in sepa
rate buildings, built for them ; this was to give a better
effect to the sounds. The occasion of the casting of a
bell was one of great public rejoicing. Offerings of
money or jewelry, or utensils of tin, copper, silver or gold were brought by men and women. "When metal enough, and in proper proportion, had been amassed,
crucibles were made, earth-furnaces dug, the moulds
fashioned, and huge bellows—worked by standing men
at each end, like a see-saw—were mounted ; and, after
due prayers and consultations, the auspicious day was
appointed. The place selected was usually a hill or
elevated place. The people, in their gayest dress, as
sembled in picnic parties, and with song, and dance, and
feast waited while the workmen, in festal uniform, toiled,
and the priests, in canonical robes, watched. The fires
were lighted, the bellows oscillated, the blast roared, and
the crucibles were brought to the proper heat and the
contents to fiery fluidity, the joy of the crowd increasing
as each stage in the process was announced. When the
molten flood was finally poured into the mould, the ex
citement of the spectators reached the height of uncon
trollable enthusiasm. Another pecuniary harvest was
reaped by the priests before the crowds dispersed, by the
sale of stamped kerchiefs or paper containing a holy
text, or certifying to the presence of the purchaser at the ceremony, and the blessing of the gods upon him there

'for. Such a token became an heirloom ; and the child who ever afterward heard the solemn boom of the bell
at matin or evening, was constrained by filial, as well as
by holy motives, to obey and reverence its admonitory
call." Such devotion to the idol-worship is not so fre
quently seen to-day, as skepticism is becoming prevalent.
THE COLOSSAL IDOL, THE ICAMAKURA DAI BUTSU.
There is a gigantic image about two miles from Kama"kura, and twenty miles from Yokohama. The colossal
idol of Buddha here (see frontispiece) is of bronze, and,
though sitting in Oriental style, is forty-four feet high, and
including the terrace on which it sits, is sixty-five feet.
It is probably the most finished work of art the Japanese
possess, regarded both for its beauty and the religious
^sentiment it expresses. After leaving Kamakura, with its
wonderful old temples, the road passes out among the rice fields, down toward the shore washed by the waves of
;the Pacific Ocean. Every here and there torii, or birds'
rests, as they are called, great gate-ways, modeled after
those before the topes in India, are placed. They con
sist of two upright shafts of stone, about ten or twelve
feet high, with cross-pieces on their tops bending up
wards at the ends, and extending beyond the uprights,
and a square cross-piece about a foot from the top run
ning from shaft to shaft. Knowing the immensity of the
statue, the visitor for the first time is on the lookout for
It. But its builders have used great judgment in placing
it, for it is not to be seen until one reaches the most fa
vorable spot. After passing through the red gate-way,
with its Gog and Magog, the giant idols, on either side,
the road seems to end in a clump of trees. However, it
passes around the trees, and there, right from the best
jplace to see the idol favorably, there right before him it

sits. There is an irresistible charm about it ; the fea
tures of the face are in such perfect harmony, the gar
ments are so simple, the face is so serene and benevolent
in its contemplative ecstasy, and the whole pose of the
figure so well executed. The hills, clad with evergreens,
gently slope together in the background, and all the
buildings, dwellings for priests, etc., are so dexterously
concealed by the foliage. The place Is silent, and time
has so tempered the bronze idol itself and the stones of
the terrace, that the whole effect is grand, and compels
admiration.
But, while the whole scene inspires one with a sense of
its beauty and grandeur, it saddens one to think that after
all it is an idol. Even while one stops to study its
beauty he is jostled by the pilgrims with their white gar
ments, broad hats, little bells fastened to their girdles
and their staves, as they come bowing and rising alter
nately, till they get near to the idol. The idol is made
of bronze plates, nicely united, though time and the weather have somewhat exposed some of these joints.
In front of it are vases with bronze lotus lilies, and a
bronze brazier where incense is burned day by day for
the benefit of pilgrims.
The imao^e is hollow, and inside smaller idols are ranged..
A window in his shoulder lets in the light. His ears are
large, as are the ears of almost all idols, and the head is
covered with representations of snail-shells, to protect
him from the sun. The idol was cast and erected about
six hundred years ago. At first a building inclosed it,
but it was soon destroyed, and for nearly six centuries past he has been exposed to wind and rain, and snow
and frost, to earthquake and typhoon, and yet he is there unharmed, and widely admired and adored by hundreds
of devout worshipers.

THE FAMOUS TEMPLE OF THE GREAT BUDDHA, AT NARA.
" Long ere great Buddha strode Upon his cahn, colossal, godlike way O'er the broad rolling river^ of Cathay, By the Corean road,
"And stepping stormy seas Hither, to mount the golden lotus throne, O Nara, there to rule and muse alone, Through lingering centuries."
As usual in approaches to Japanese temples, there are
several shops near to the temple itself. In the centre oi the large open space between the lesser gateway and the
temple is an immense and very old bronze lantern, large
enough for a man to stand in. This lantern was presented to the temple by the renowned hero and statesman, Yoritomo, who died in the year 1 199, and is 700
years old. It is in daily use still. This temple was
originally founded, and the immense image made, by the
Mikado Shomu, the forty-sixth of the present line of em
perors, and the third of Nara, who died 748 A. D. The
temple was destroyed 700 years ago, in the terrible civil
wars of the twelfth century, and again seriously injured,
so that the head of the god had to be recast, in the seventeenth century. The great gateway, however, with most
of the other buildings of the great temple, have escaped
such injuries, and, although constructed of wood, have
stood as they now stand for more than eleven centuries.
The interest of this place centres in the great god of
gold and bronze, which has been the wonder of Japan for
so many ages past. It has been positively stated by some
that a considerable amount of gold entered into his com
position; but those on the spot seem to be uncertain as to whether the gold employed in making him was mixed

with the bronze of which he is cast, or apphed superficially
to him. That much has been applied in the latter way
there can be no doubt ; and in places in which the gold
is visible, and which I closely examined, it seemed to me
that it conformed to an external line of ornament in each
case, which would indicate that it was superficial only.
JAPANESE IDEA OF THE JUDGE OF HELL.
The dimensions of this god are truly colossal. His
height from the base of the lotus-flower, on which he sits,
to the top of his head is sixty-three and one-half feet

and above this rises an aureole fourteen feet wide, above
which again rises for several feet the flame-like glory

sixteen feet long ; its width, nine and one-half feet. The
eyes are tliree feet nine inclies long ; the eyebrows, five
and one-half feet ; the ears, eight and one-half feet. The
chest is twenty feet in depth. Its middle finger is five
feet long. Around the head, shoulders and sides of the
god, in front of the aureole, are sixteen sitting figures,
said to be eight feet long. The leaves of the immense
lotus on which he sits are each ten feet long and six feet
wide, and there are fifty-six of them. The casting must
have been wonderfully well executed, although the fine
ness of the leaf-edges, and other parts which we were
able to examine, and the elaborate engraving which can
be traced upon the lotus-leaves in the uninjured parts,
leaves no doubt that the founder's art was elaborately supplemented by the file and graver. The countenance of the god is less mild and calm of expression than is usual in images of Buddha. The right hand is open and
raised upwards ; the left rests on the lap.
SOME JAPANESE GODS.
Many of the gods of Shintoism have been adopted by
the Buddhists. Hotel's image is carved into the shape
of buttons, and used for holding the pipe in the girdle
(a Nitsuki). Inari, the rice-god, and his companion,
Kitsune, the fox, are worshiped. A very great many
superstitions are connected with the fox. If one is sick,
he is said to have a fox in him, and a priest is sent for,
who, by beating a drum—at, say, three beats each half
minute all night long—will drive him out. He is the
cause of a thousand ills to the people. He is reverenced
because he is supposed to be the most cunning creature
in creation. Kitsune becomes by turns a sacred, amus
ing, perfidious, diabolical personage. One superstitious
notion is, that if the traveler fail to honor the fox before



7l2 ERRORS CHAINS.
his journey, he, Kitsune, will take revenge by causing
will-o'-the-wisps to spring up all over the rice-swamps, and
so mislead the traveler, and prolong his journey indefi
nitely. This lighting the will-o'-the-wisp is called the Fes
tival of the Foxes, and is shown in the opposite picture.
SOME JAPANESE FESTIVALS.
New Year's day is observed in Japan with many cere
monies. On the day before all accounts are squared,
new clothing is bought, and the people prepare to spend
the morrow with great joy. The Chinese seek to drive
the devils out of their houses by exploding fire-crackers.
The; Japanese have a feast on New Year's Eve, and when the merriment is almost over, the head of the
house takes a dish of beans and goes all over the house,
throwing the beans in every corner; in this way they
think they drive out the devils, and when they are all
out, they place a sacred piece of paper, which they have
purchased from the priest, on the door, to prevent their
re-entering. On New Year's day the streets are alive
with the people. It is the holiday of the nation, and the
temples are thronged with the gay worshipers and dex
terous jugglers.
We will let an eye-witness describe a Matsuri, or fes
tival scene. He writes from Osaka: "The other day a
procession passed our door, which you, perhaps, would
like to hear of. We heard a din, a Babel of voices,
growing louder and louder, and on going to the door
saw a crowd approaching, composed largely of boys between five and ten years of age, though some men were among them. The first fifty or more were dressed in
uniform colors, a suit of red and white, in squares of
about an inch and a half, the red being a dominant color,
looking, indeed, like circus clowns. Each person had a

along, striking their hands, or perhaps each other, with
the fan, and singing and chatting. The men especially









JAPANESE BUDDHISM. -jqj
were cutting up queer antics. Some of the boys had
bells huno- to their o^irdles. Then came a lot of older
persons, dressed in blue and white garments. Perhaps
a hundred and fifty in all. Last of all came a triumphal
car, a miniature temple, or shrine, with a man in it. They
were having a jolly time altogether."
Another festival is that of the god Tengou. The Japa
nese mariner knows no festival so attractive as that of
which the sea is the theatre. When the sea-side inhab
itants of Sinagawa, at Tokio, celebrate the anniversary
of their favorite deity, Tengou, they believe that they
best show their affection for the idol by transporting it
into the sea. While the veterans of the priesthood and
their servants attend to the annual purification of the
temple and its furniture, the most vigorous of the priests
take upon their shoulders the frame on which the shrine
or Mikosi rests. When they have reached the shore,
they lay aside their sacerdotal vestments, and in good
order plunge through the waves. Meanwhile the crowds
of fishermen, who follow them with tumultuous shouts,
encircle the cortege; seize with their strong arms the
sacred abode of the god ; raise it above the lacquered
caps of the priests ; and in spite of the efforts, real or
pretended, of its official guardians, who struggle against
the crowd in the midst of the waves, the tottering, but
still upright shrine in the hands of the people accom
plishes its maritime pilgrimage.
This ceremonial takes place on the sixth day of the
sixth month, which is about the end of our July. It lasts,
with its different rites, to the eighth day, when, to con
clude, the priests distribute to their flocks branches of
trees laden with fruit in the condition in which the people
most like it—that is to say, when it has scarcely arrived
at maturity.

THE SACRED MOUNTAIN, FUJI.
One of the g^randest sirrhts to be seen in all the world
is the view of the gn at Sacred Mountain of Japan, Fuji
Yama. The writer will never forget the impression it
made upon him. It rises in all its lonely majesty to a
height of 1 3,oSo feet high. Its beautifully sweeping sides
rise, cone-like, from the almost level lands surrounding
its base. It is no wonder that the mountain is so dear

to the heart of every Japanese. On almost all their
works of art, in bronze or lacquer-ware. Mount Fuji is
drawn or wrought. Long before the sun has lighted the
earth below at the sun-rise, and long after the hills and
valleys are shrouded in the darkness of the coming night, Fuji's snow-crowned summit is aglow with light; the huge
cone rising high above the clouds, sublime, colossal and



JAPANESE BUDDHISM. ^9
beautiful in its ruddy purple. To this mountain the Jap
anese are accustomed to make pilgrimages. All who have visited Fuji-Yama in pilgrimage wear a little bell
attached to their girdle, in addition to their pilgrim suit.
Longfellow has introduced into his Poems of Places, in
the volumes on Asia, the following translation of a Jap
anese poem on Fuji
:
"Heaven above from earth below Long ago the gods have parted, Henceforth hiding far from men. Round the hoary peak sublimely Towering o'er Suruga's land, Fuji's venerated mountain, All the wide-arched azure skyThough thou search with wistful gaze Of the hastening sun's bright track, Not a glimpse shalt thou enjoy
;
Nor of gentlier beami ig moon Hail the shadow-fringing shimmer
:
Fleecy clouds are hovering, -^ Hovering round the high, bare summit. Veiling it from mortal ken. Hath thereon the white snow fallen
;
Would'st thou of the lofty gods Know the annals, only Fuji
Can the secret story tell thee."
CUSTOMS CONCERNING BIRTH, MARRIAGE AND DEATH.
With but a very few exceptions the Japanese Bud
dhists are intensely superstitious. Some of the young
men of Japan, who have come in contact with foreigners^
have given up their superstitions ; but the rest of the
people, more especially the peasants, hold a firm faith in
a multitude of superstitious customs. These touch upon
the most insignificant occupations of every-day life, as
well as upon birth, marriage and death.



lO EKHOR'S CHAINS.
When a child is thirty days old it is taken to the temple
of its parents' gods, and, with the assistance of the priest,
a name is chosen. Three names are selected by the
parents, and written on slips of paper. These slips are
tossed in the air by the priest, while he mumbles incanta
tions, and the first slip that falls to the floor is believed
to contain the name chosen by the gods for the little babe.
The priest then writes this name on a piece of sacred
paper, and it is given to the parents as a talisman.
In a few of the Buddhist sects, the priest assist at the
marriage, but in the great majority of cases he has no part to perform there. At the marriage ceremony neither bride nor bridegroom can wear any garment containing
purple color. The Japanese believe that to do this would
be most fatal ; for as purple is the color which fades most
readily, so the marriage of those who wear purple would
•come to an end speedily. The Japanese marriage cere
mony is a very simple one, and Is rather singular, because
religion finds no place in it. When the bride and bride
groom and their friends are gathered together, a small
cup is filled with the native wine, which a chosen friend
hands to the bride, who drinks from it, and then passes
it to the bridegroom ; he passes it back, after drinking,
and thus it passes back and forth between the two a few
times until it is emptied, and this constitutes them man
and wife. The Japanese say that it is thus, that, as hus
tand and wife, they must drink of the same cup of sorrow
or of joy. The writings of Confucius, are the basis of
many of the laws of Japan. According to these, among
the seven causes for divorce is the one: "If she talk too
much." Every heathen religion lowers women to a posi
tion far below that of man. In India, woman's lot is the
saddest, and in Japan, probably the happiest of all heathen
countries. According to Buddhism there is no salvation



JAPANESE BUDDHISM. 711
for a woman unless she is born over again as a man. The nature-worship of Japan gives to woman a much
higher place than Buddhism does. Two things tend to cause the degradation of women in Japan. The one is
the custom of having many wives ; the other is the de
mands of parental obedience. In Japan, according to Bud
dhist teaching, a girl must obey her father in everything,
and no exception is allowed. Hence it not infrequently
happens that the father commands his child to enter upon a life of sin, that he may make money by it. The daughter
is bound to do as she is bidden, and thus the greatest evil that can come upon a woman is brought upon her under the direction of a heathen system. But, thank God, noble Christian women have gone forth from our
own and other Christian lands, and by their teachings and examples have done much to better the condition of
the women of Japan and a brighter day is rapidly dawning upon them. From the moment when a person dies in Japan, religious ceremonies are performed in the house of the
deceased until the body is removed to the grave. Priests
are immediately sent for, who light the candles and in
cense-sticks before the household gods, and who recite
their prayers. The priests, carrying their rosaries, head
the funeral procession as it goes to the temple. The
nearest relatives are dressed in white, and carry various
objects formerly used by the deceased. The square
coffin is set down in the temple before the altar, and re
ligious services are performed, with more or less pomp,
according to the wealth of those who fee the priests for
the services. Very frequently, the bodies are then burned,
and the ashes placed in an urn ; at other times, the bodies
are buried. After a time, the nearest relative of the dead
person buys from the priest a long, narrow board or tab

712 ERROR'S CHAINS.
let, containing the new name of the deceased. This is
placed on the grave. Fresh flowers and evergreens are
kept on the tomb-stones in bamboo vases for a long time.
The relatives resort to the tombs for worship ; praying,
sometimes, to the deceased, asking his aid, or at other
times for the deceased, that he may be freed from the
pains of purgatory. In either case they are very devout.
SOME JAPANESE SUPERSTITIONS.
Scattered all over Japan are trees, which are specially
devoted to the gods, or Kami, as they are called in Jap
anese. Often they twist some rice-straw into a rope, and
bind it around the base of a tree to indicate its sacred
ness. Like the Greeks of old, the Japanese imagine that
the mountains and valleys, the rills and rivers, the rocks
and trees, are all filled with spirits. They tell tales of
trees shedding blood, or groaning in agony, when the
woodman cut them with his axe. Some trees, we are
told, are believed to have wonderful power to attract men
to commit suicide ; this is because they are possessed by
evil spirits. Other trees are noted for the shelter they
afford in storms, for the protection they furnish when
flying from enemies ; these are supposed to be inhabited by good and helping spirits. Many customs among
Christian nations, so-called, are decidedly superstitious.
For example, it is counted unlucky in some parts of
America to spill salt, to break a looking-glass, to have
thirteen people sit down at table.together ; and many are
the stories, undoubtedly true, it is declared, which are told
to illustrate the certaintv with which evils follow these
signs. So in Japan there are many such superstitious
signs and customs, some of them just the opposite of
signs in other lands. These signs are almost innumer
able, and concern the actions of every day. Many are









JAPANESE BUDDHISM. 715
the fairy tales and ghost stories which the O-Baa-San, or
grandmother, tells to the children as they gather around
the fire-box at night, and which send them shivering and
shaking to bed. Some of the superstitious customs,
however, are not revolting, but are very beautiful. Mr.
Griffis, an American teacher in Japan, tells us one of this
better kind. It is called " The Mother's Memorial." It is
popular with all
classes, being
often used by
the Shintoists
as well as the
Buddhists. He
writes thus: "A
sisfht not often
met with in the
cities, but in the
suburban and country places
as frequent as
the cause of it
requires, is the
nagare kanjo
(flowing invo
cation). Apiece
of cotton-cloth
is suspended by its four corners to stakes set in the
ground near a brook or rivulet. Behind this is a hitjh,
narrow board, notched near the top, and having an in
scription written upon it. Resting by the brookside is
a wooden dipper. Perhaps, upon the four corners, in the
hollow ends of the upright bamboo stakes, may be set
bouquets of flowers. The inscriptions and flowers are like those set up upon graves. Waiting long enough.
THE FLOWING INVOCATION.



7i6 ERROR'S CHAINS.
perchance but a few minutes, there may be seen a passer
who pauses, and, devoutly offering a prayer, with the aid
of his rosary, reverently dips a ladleful of water, pours it
on the cloth, and waits until it has strained through, be
fore moving on. All this, when the significance is under
stood, is very touching. It is a silent appeal to the
passer-by, by the love of Heaven, to shorten the penal
ties of a soul in pain. The Japanese believe that the
mother dying in child-bed, suffers, by such a death, for
some sin committed long ago. After death, they say,
she sinks into a hell, until this ' flowing invocation ' ceases,
by the wearing out of the symbolic cloth. When this is
so utterly worn that the water no longer drips through,
but falls through at once, the mother's soul is delivered
from her sufferings. But in addition to the sadness that
this superstition brings upon us, as we think of the delu
sion this people rest under, there is a feeling of indigna
tion awakened as we learn that these cloths can only be purchased from a priest, and that for much money a cloth
can be bought, so thin in the middle, that the water soon
runs through, while the poor person must be content
with a cloth that it will take a long while to wear out."
RELIGION OF THE AINOS.
To the north of the main island of Japan, and almost
touching it, lies the island of Yezzo. The people of
Yezzo are called Ainos ; they are savages in their man
ner of life, though their disposition is kind and their
manner gentle.
The following account of Ainos worship, particularly
the strange "sacrifice of the bear," is from Mr. J. J. Enslie,
Consul at Hakodate, 1 861-3:
" The religious creed of the Ainos is the ancient Japa
nese 'Shintoism,' or the adoration of the Kamis. Their



JAPANESE BUDDHISM. 717
rulers have made many attempts to convert them to Buddhism; but the only result of these endeavors is
that the Ainos now rub their hands together as a form
of worship before their gods, instead of raising the hands
above the head as they formerly did. There is a slight
difference between the symbols of Japanese and Aino
Shintoism—the former exhibiting a looking-glass and a
variety of white paper ornaments, while the latter use a
polished stone and garlands made of a peculiar descrip
tion of very white wood. The Ainos, however, have
numerous festivals totally distinct from Shintoism. The
grandest and most solemn of these festivals is undoubt
edly the Sacrifice of the Bear, for which animal the Ainos
entertain a strange sort of veneration.
" The savage denizen of the forest destined to be ex
alted to the position of a god is reared from a cub by
the village chief, and the female most distinguished in
rank and beauty enjoys the honor of being its wet
nurse. As soon as the bear is two years old, he is car
ried in a cage to an eminence (previously consecrated
for the ceremony), amid shouts of joy and the most in
harmonious concert of various noises ever heard ; while
from time to time the bereft nurse utters the most
piercing and heart-rending cries, expressive of her
poignant grief. Afi.er this uproar has continued for
some time, the chief of the village approaches the bear, and with an arrow gives him the first wound. The ani
mal, previously maddened by the din around him, now
becomes furious, the cage is opened, and he springs
out into the midst of the assemblage. Then, at a sig
nal given by the children of the nurse, everybody in
the crowd wounds him with the various weapons they have brought with them, each one striving to inflict a
wound ; as all believe that he who fails to wound the



7l8 ERROR'S CHAINS.
bear has no claim to any favor from the new Kami, or god. As soon as the poor animal falls down exhausted
from the loss of blood, his head is cut off, and the arrows,
spears, knives, sticks, and in fact all the weapons by
which he has been wounded, are solemnly presented to
the headless trunk by the village patriarch, who requests the bear to avenge himself upon the weapons by which he has been insulted and slain. The severed head is
then affixed to the trunk, and the dead bear is car
ried to the altar, where the Rama Matsouri (the sacrifice
of the bear) commences amid various solemnities, such as
singing, music, and offerings consisting of everything the Ainos most esteem. The nurse meanwhile deals blows with the branch of a tree upon every one who has
taken part in the bear's death. The flesh is then dis
tributed among the people, and the head is placed upon a
pole opposite the hut of the chief, where it is left to
decay.
" The Ainos entertain great fear and profound respect
for strength and courage; and this is the cause of their
veneration for the bear—the strongest and fiercest animal known to them. Their most energetic comparison
is the bear. A man is 'strong as a bear,' 'fierce as a
bear,' etc. The bear is the burden of their national
songs, and, in a word, this animal is the symbol of every
thing they think worthy of respect. To compare an Aino
with a bear is the surest plan to gain his friendship; and
it must be acknowledged that the merit the Ainos attach
to the bear is more or less deserved, as the Yezzo bear
is the finest specimen of his species."

MOHAMMEDANISM.
Utter the song, O my soul ! the flight and return of Mohammed,
Prophet and priest, who scattered abroad both evil and blessing, Huge wasteful empires founded, and hallowed slow persecution, Soul-withering, but crushed the blasphemous rites of the Pagan. Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
THE story of the idol worship of the world would
not be complete without having described that
system of religion which began as an opposition
to all idolatry. This was the motive that led Mohammed
to start on his career of destroying idols, and compelling
their worshipers, at the sword's point, to believe in the
one God. Add to this the fact that this religion has ex
tended far beyond the bounds of its birthplace, and it
will be seen to be well worthy of our attention.
EXTENT OF MOHAMMEDANISM.
There are from 150,000,000 to 180,000,000 of Mohammedans, or Moslems (as they are sometimes called), in
the world. These are found in the south-east corner of
Europe, and are scattered over Asia and Africa. Arabia and Turkey are i/ie Mohammedan countries, though in Egypt and India, and even in China, they are to be found
by the hundreds of thousands. This system is a prose
lyting one, and thus has come to spread so widely.
Starting with but a handful of disciples, the followers of
Mohammed include more than one-tenth of the human
race. Its believers are true, strong believers, holding



720 EHJiOR'S CHAINS.
their faith with firmness and fervor. For hundreds of
years they have been trying to bring the world to the faith embodied in their motto, "God is God, and Mo
hammed is His Prophet." Formerly, in great armies,
they swept over Asia and Africa, making their proselytes
at the point of the sword ; to-day they borrow Christian
methods, and Moslem missionaries go forth to preach the
Koran (their sacred book), and thus seek to extend the
dominion of Mohammed. In their university at Cairo,
10,000 students are gathered to-day, preparing to
go as the missionaries of the Moslem faith. A cele
brated traveler describes this university thus : " This
university is 900 years old (older than Oxford), and still
flourishes with as much vigor as in the palmy days o{
the Arabian Conquest. There I saw collected together
10,000 students. As one expressed it, 'there were two
acres of turbans,' assembled in a vast inclosure, with no
floor but a pavement, and with a roof over it, supported
by 400 columns, and at the foot of every column a
teacher, surrounded by his pupils. As we entered, there
rose a hum of thousands of voices, reciting the Koran.
These students are not only from Egypt, but from all
parts of Africa, from Morocco to Zanzibar. They come from far up the Nile, from Nubia and Soudan ; and from
Darfour, beyond the great desert, and from the western
coast of Africa. Asia, too, is largely represented in stu
dents from Western Asia, from Turkey, Arabia and Per
sia ; and from Central Asia, from Khiva, and Bokhara,
and Turkistan, and Afghanistan, and the borders of
China. They live on the charities of the faithful ; and
when their studies are ended, those who are to be mis
sionaries mount their camels, and, joining a caravan, cross
the desert, and are lost in the far interior of Africa." And
there, we should say, they meet our no less faithful and



MOHAMMEDANISM. 721
ardent Christian missionaries, who are laboring to elevate
the depraved Africans. These carry to a happy completion the very imperfect work which Moslem missionaries
are able to perform.
Now let us turn to the story of the man who founded
Mohammedanism.
THE ARABIAN CAMEL-DRIVER WHO FOUNDED A GREAT
RELIGION.
The descendants of Ishmael and of Abraham have in
habited uninterruptedly a land inclosed by the Red Sea,
the Indian Ocean, the Persian Gulf, the Euphrates River
and the land of Syria. There are a few fertile valleys
and excellent pastures in Arabia ; but a great part of the
country consists of bleak wildernesses, barren hills and
"wastes of sandy deserts. There is not one navigable
river in the whole country. Goods are carried on cam
els, whose drivers travel in groups called caravans. The
Arabs are a simple and temperate race, quick to revenge,
yet exceedingly hospitable. The great majority of the
people in the interior live a tent life; thus they are
Tarought into close contact with nature, and are reveren
tial and imaginative. From their out-door life, they were
early inclined to worship the sun, moon, planets and all
the hosts of heaven and angels. Desiring a visible ob
ject of worship, something to be seen and felt, they made
images of their deides. The " Black Stone," in the Tem
ple of the Kaaba, at Mecca, was an especially honored
object of worship. This stone, about six inches by eight,
was one of the precious stones of Paradise, and fell down
to the earth with Adam. At the deluge, it was taken up
again, or otherwise preserved, and afterward brought by
Gabriel to Abraham, when he and Ishmael were building
the Kaaba. This temple was placed in charge of one



722 EJiJiOR'S CHAINS.
family. In the year 570 A. D., of this family was born a
child named Mohammed, destined to affect the religious
life of hundreds of millions of his fellow-beinfrs.
THE PROPHET S YOUTH AND EARLY MANHOOD.
Miraculous signs were said to have attended his birth. For five years, he remained away from his mother ; at
the end of that time, he became subject to epileptic fits,



MOHAMMEDANISM. 723
and returned to his home. He then saw the multitude
of pilgrims, with their camels laden with spices and beautiful cloths, coming yearly to visit Mecca, and undoubtedly was impressed with the sights and sounds in the Kaaba.
When he was twelve years old, an event occurred
which greatly influenced his after life. With his uncle's caravan he journeyed to Palestine, where he met Jews and Christians. From these he must have gained that
knowledo^e of the Bible which he used in his teaching-s in
after years. The Jews, from the day when God cured them of idolatry, by sending them away to Babylon, had
persistently opposed the worship of idols, and upheld and urged the worship of the one true God. The
Christians were such in name only ; for, with their ritual,
crosses, pictures, vestments and images, they were hardly
better than the idolaters around them. But Mohammed
gained only a superficial knowledge of these faiths, and
knew almost nothing of their leading features.
When he was twenty-five years old he entered the ser
vice of the Khadija, a rich widow of Mecca, for his family
was poor. She appointed him as a camel-driver, to care for the caravans. The widow soon was charmed with the noble appearance and energetic manliness of Mohammed, and in a modest way led him to seek to marry her. The marriage was a happy one, and Mohammed
loved his wife long after her death, even to his old age. When all the world turned its back upon him in scorn,
she clung to him; and while they called him cheat and
impostor, she recognized him as the prophet of God.
During all this time he always appeared as a very relig
ious and upright person. Often with his wife he retired
to a cave, about three miles from Mecca, to pray and
fast. Here, when in his epileptic fits, it is claimed, he saw
visions and received revelations.



724 ERROR'S CHAINS.
GABRIEL S MESSAGE TO MOHAMMED.
In his fortieth year, he was spending the sacred month
in the cave. One night, as he said, there appeared " one
mighty in power, endued with understanding," who stood
about two bows' lensfth from him. It was the ang-el Ga
ts o
briel, who lield a silken scroll in his hand, and bade
Mohammed read the writing thereon. He replied that
he could not; then Gabriel said, "Read in the name of
the Lord, who hath created all things. Read by the
most beneficent Lord, who taught the use of the pen;
who teacheth man that which he knoweth not." Then
the angel flew away, leaving Mohammed in perplexity. After a time, when doubt and despondency filled his
mind, the voice of the angel was heard speaking from a throne midway between heaven and earth, saying: "O' Mohammed ! thou art the prophet of God, and I am Gabriel." This he regards as his commission, and straight
way tells his wife. Secretly he commits the revelation
made him to various persons, and after four years gathers
together thirty or forty converts. Then Gabriel comes
ag'ain, and brincrs from the Lord this messag-e : "O thou
covered, arise and preach, and magnify the Lord, and clean thy garments, and fly every abomination." He obeyed this, and in consequence of the changes he urged,
was forced to suffer persecution. Even his relatives
turned against him. He was mocked and scorned, and
occasionally abused. His disciples suffered with him,
and so he sent away to Abyssinia eleven of them as
missionaries.
At first his teachings had not been uncompromising
;
but, so he thoucrht, in a revelation he was warned that this was wrong, and he proceeded to burn the bridges behind him. Of some of the idol gods he had said :



MOHAMMEDANISM. 725
" Their intercession may be hoped for with God." After
his vision he said, " These are no other than empty
names, which ye and your fathers have made gods."
Then the idol worshipers turned on him; he was, said
they, a fool, a fanatic, a forger. Then they ostracized
him; he was shut out from their homes and cut off from
their friendship. To escape personal violence he fled
the city, mingling with the pilgrims from distant lands as
they journeyed to Mecca, and preaching to them his doc
trines. Then his wife, Khadija, died. Soon after this he
married, and was betrothed (in his fiftieth year) to a
child of seven years, as it is the custom of the Arabs to allow a man to marry as many wives as he might
wish.
Now came the turn of the tide ; his failing fortunes
began to rise again. A few pilgrims from Medina were converted. With zeal they sought to spread Mohammed's
doctrine on their return home. They met with astonish
ing success, and soon the prophet's name was in every
household in Medina, and the motto, "God is God, and Mohammed is His Prophet," was heard on every side. The prophet was invited to go and live in Medina. After
a year, with many companions, his Medina converts re
turned to him at Mecca, and again pledged their fidelity.
THE FLIGHT OF MOHAMMED.
On the 20th of June, A. D. 622, the celebrated " Hejira,"
or flight, took place. From this day, the Mohammedans
date their era, as Christians do from the birth of Christ.
They regard this as the most momentous event of their
history, for from this time forth, Mohammed's course was
one of constant progress. After eight days' journey,
they arrived at Medina, and in great pomp made a tri
umphal entry into the city. He waited until his camel

1 50 feet square, was built ; this is called to-day the Mosque
of the Prophet. Here a simple worship was established. Mohammed was now married to Ayesha, the child to whom he had been betrothed. As he already had one wife he
thus indorsed the custom of having many wives. This
practice and, growing out of it, the enormity of treating
women as really little better than slaves, are the conspic
uous blots on Mohammed's career.
"converts made at the sword's point.
Mohammed was now established in a secure position.
His prosperity spoiled him. He longed for greater num
bers of converts than he could make by preaching simply, hence, his disordered mind prompted him to see a vision
in which he was directed to take the sword to compel
converts. In one of the sacred months he sent eight of
his followers to waylay a Mecca caravan. One man
they killed, two others were taken prisoners, and with
their booty the Mohammedans returned to Medina. The next was the celebrated battle of Badr, when a troop of Meccans came out to destroy Mohammed and his Medina followers, but were themselves destroyed. Mohammed
asserted that 3,000 angels fought with them, and that
thus they gained the battle. This battle placed Mohammed where he could command (or rather demand) un
hesitating obedience from his followers. Battle after
battle followed, and converts were made by the thousands. Mecca was subdued, and then the whole of Arabia. To
his followers, he promised Paradise should they fall in
the fight. Said they to him: "It is hot." He replied:
"Hell is hotter." Mohammed was made of stern stuff;
his indomitable will supported him in his great under
takings. He was not a true prophet, neither was he an

became the Holy Place to which the faithful made their

in saying their prayers, and in all the mosques, by a niche

cated as a CTuide to the devotions of the faithful who assemble there.
Mohammed's successors, the caliphs.
After Mohammed's death, his bosom friend, Abu
Bekr, was elected to be his successor, called the Caliph.
From his attachment to Mohammed he received the name of "The True." The name Abu Bekr means "The Father of the Virgin," and was given him because Ayesha,.
his daughter, was the only virgin bride of Mohammed.
The office of Caliph was the highest that could be held
in the Mohammedan world. All the "Faithful" recog
nized in the Caliph both the temporal and spiritual head. Abu Bekr proved a worthy successor to Mohammed. He put down the Bedouin rebellions, which began immediately after Mohammed's death, and not only conquered
them, but won them to his cause, and turned their fierce
fanaticism into the service of Mohammedanism. Abu
Bekr was a man of the purest character, and had the
firmest faith in Mohammed's mission. He died after a
reign of about two years and a half, and Omar became
the next Caliph.

"he affected no regal state, was the friend and companion
of the beggar and poor, and in his mud palace, at Me

brother of the faith." Omar was killed by a Persian
slave. He was succeeded by the Caliph Othman. He
reig-ned amidst grreat turbulence and discontent until the year 654 A. D., when he was murdered. The next Ca
liph, AH, who reigned till 660 A. D., was, likewise, as
sassinated. Hassan, the next Caliph, was poisoned by
his wife. Several Caliphs, Muavia and Hosein, occupied the throne before Valid I. reigned. His reign extended from 705 to 716 A. D. Under him the empire of the
" Prince of the Faithful " attained its greatest extent.
It then extended from India to Spain. Thus, just about one hundred years from the time when Mohammed had
received his call to enter upon his mission as the Prophet
of God, to re-establish His worship and to destroy idola
try, the empire which he had founded, and the religion he
had started, had spread over Arabia, Syria, Asia Minor,
Spain, part of Gaul (now France), Egypt and Northern
Africa, and over Persia and Northern India. Soon after this, reigned a Caliph whose name is a household word among us, Haroun-al-Raschid, of whom the " Arabian
Nights" has so much to say. The Caliph preceding him
had moved his capital to Bagdad. As the first calendar
says, in the "Arabian Nights" story, " Haroun-al-Ras
chid's generosity was renowned through the world."
The stories tell us of his wandering in disguise among
his people to ascertain more accurately their condition,
and thus to be better able to govern them.
' Hitherto the Caliphate has been held by Arabians;
soon after Haroun-al-Raschid's time, it passes into the
hands of the Turks. They have retained it without in

THE CRUSADES.
Attempts were often made to roll back the tide of
Mohammedan conquest, but without avail. Rebellions
were put down rapidly, and no nation from without
seemed disposed to dispute with the Mohammedans their
possession of the conquered countries. But in the year
1096 A. D., fired by the desire to recover the land of the
'birthplace of Christ, and anxious to revenge the insults
.and injuries heaped upon the Christian pilgrims to the Holy Land by the Moslems, led the Christians of Western Europe to determine to begin a Crusade. The Pope, Urban 11., aided by the preaching of Peter the Hermit,
•succeeded in inducing an army to start for the conquest
'Of Palestine. They seemed to succeed, and yet theirs
vas a doubtful victory. They reached Jerusalem, and
•slew multitudes of the Saracen Moslems. But they
'Could not retain their hold upon the city. A second
Crusade was undertaken in 1 148 A. D., but utterly failed
to accomplish its object. St. Bernard, who had urged on
this Crusade, declared that it had failed because of the
-sinfulness of the Crusaders, and that none but innocent hands could wrest the Holy Land from the Moslem
hands which held it. So in 121 2 began the Children's
'Crusade ; 30,000 children, under the boy-leader, Stephen,
.and 20,000 German boys and girls, under the peasant
lad, Nicholas, started for the conquest of Palestine, only
"to perish by sea or land, or to be carried to the slave
markets. Two other Crxisades were commenced, but
both failed, and to-day the Holy Land is under the do
minion of the Moslem Turk. The religion of Moham
med is still spreading, though only in Africa. It obtained
a footing in Western China some time ago, and more
4ately spread throughout the Indian Archipelago. .

We now pass to consider the Mohammedan Bible»,
known as the Koran, and give attention to its teachings.
THE WRITING OF THE KORAN.
During the Hfetime of Mohammed no attempt was made
to collect the multitudinous revelations constituting the
Koran into one book. The various passages had been
written down from his lips, from time to time at their
delivery, by some friend or follower performing the office of amanuensis ; or they had been first committed tO' memory, and then at some subsequent period recorded.
For this purpose the rude materials in use among the.
Arabs were employed, as palm-leaves, leather, stone tab
lets, or the shoulder-blades of goats and camels. There
was no systematic arrangement of these materials. There
were, indeed, recognized "Suras," or chapters; and it
seems probable that the greater part of the revelation
was so arranged during the Prophet's lifetime, and used
in that form for private reading, and also for recitation
at the daily prayers. Some of the Suras were short and
self-contained ; others were longer, and from time Xx>
time were added to by the command of Mohammed, who
would direct a new revelation to be "entered in the Sura
treating of such and such a subject." There was no fixed
repository for these materials ; but there is reason to
conjecture that the greater portion, or at least the most
important chapters, were laid up in the habitation of one
of the Prophet's wives (for he had no separate room or
dwelling-place of his own), or left in the custody of the
scribes or secretaries who had first recorded them. They
were, moreover, treasured up with pious reverence in the
memories of the people, and transcripts of the several
Suras or fragments, especially of those most frequently
in use for meritorious repetition, or for public and pri



MOHAMMEDANISM. - ^ r
rate devotion, were even before the Flight in the hands
of many persons, and so preserved with religious and
even superstitious care. As the Faith extended, teach
ers were sent forth to the various tribes throughout
Arabia to instruct the new converts in the requirements
of Islam ; and these carried with them, either in a re
corded form or indelibly imprinted on the mind (for the
Arab memory was possessed of a marvelous tenacity),
the leading portions of the Mohammedan Revelation.
THE TEACHING OF THE KORAN.
Sir William Muir, one of the first expositors of the
Koran, thus writes: "The teaching of the Koran is very
simple. God has revealed Himself in various ages, under
different dispensations, through the instrumentality of
inspired prophets. The dispensations varied in outward
and accidental form ; but the great catholic faith in the
unity of God and Islam (that is, submission to His will),
underlies them all. The truth thus successively promul
gated was as often lost or distorted by the ignorance and
perversity of mankind. The mission of Mohammed was to
establish the last of these dispensations; and, while at
first professing to hold that his own teaching was simply
concurrent with that of former revelations, in the end he
caused it to obliterate and override them all.
" The first condition of Islam is belief in the creed
:
'There is no God but the Lord, and Mohammed is His
Apostle.' This at once sweeps away idolaltry, and the
'association with God' of other objects of worship; and it
also establishes the Koran as the paramount rule of faith
and practice. There is no priesthood in Islam. Man deals
immediately with the Deity. Mohammed is but a Prophet,
himself a sinner needing mercy and forgiveness. Salva
tion is promised to the believer; but he is at the same time



736 £JiJeOA"S CHAINS,
bound to abstain from evil, and to do good works, and, in
particular, to observe the ordinances of Islam. These
requirements, though few and simple, pervade the whole
Jife of a Mussulman. The day opens with prayer at the dawn ; with prayer the night closes in ; and the ceremony
is repeated three other times, at fixed intervals, during
the day. Each prayer consists of two or more series of
prostrations, accompanied by ejaculatory prayer and the
recital of short passages of the Koran. Then there are
the prescribed tithes, or alms ; the fast throughout the
v^rhole month of Ramodhan (which, though rigorous from
dawn to sunset, admits of entire relaxation by night) ; and
the pilgrimage to Mecca, which, although not burden
some to the Arabs for whom it was first established, is
evidently unsuitable for observance by all mankind.
"That the fate of man, and whatever happens, great or
small, has been fixed by inevitable decrees is uncondi
tionally asserted throughout the Koran. The doctrine
is often intelligibly urged as a ground of resignation and
patience under misfortune, of equanimity in success, and
of calmness in danger; but it is not confined to such in
nocent and legitimate purposes. The dogma is constantly obtruded in its most naked and offensive form
:
'God misleadeth whom He pleaseth, and guideth whom
He pleaseth aright.' 'We created man upright, and then
caused him to be the vilest of the vile.' 'The fate of every man have we bound about his neck ;' and so
fordi. But while there is nothing to be met with in the
Koran expressly of an opposite tenor, there is much that
by implication conveys the sentiment of free will. Prayer
is continually enjoined. It was practiced by Mohammed
himself, and deliverance is often ascribed to its effect.
Men are exhorted to believe and do good works. They
are warned against infidelity and sin, 'lest they cast them



MOHAMMEDANISM. -,y
selves into perdition.' Salvation, indeed, is dependent
on faith, and faith upon the will of God; yet there are not wanting passages which speak of man as choosing
the wrong or choosing the right, and of Paradise or hell
as the consequence. The believer is frequently bid to
beware of the wiles of Satan. Discretion in the follow
ing of good or evil is implied in many parts of the Koran,
and retribution set forth as the result of its exercise.
Man is responsible for his own sin only. 'The burdened
soul shall not bear the burthen of another.' Hereditary
taint from the fall is nowhere admitted. Adam fell, it
is true, by eating the forbidden fruit ; but his fall (as it
would appear) was the consequence, not the cause of the proneness of his nature to sin. All men have sinned,
but it has been each his own fault, acting independently, and not because of anything antecedent."
SOME SELECTIONS FROM THE KORAN.
We first present one oi the passages in which refer
ence is made to Jesus Christ. In the ninth Sura, the
Koran says : " Fight against them who believe not in
God, nor in the last day, and forbid not that which God
and His apostle have forbidden, and profess not the true
religion, of those unto whom the Scriptures have been
delivered, until they pay tribute by right of subjection,
and they be reduced low. The Jews say Ezra is the son
of God; and the Christians say, Christ is the son of God.
This is their saying in their mouths : they imitate the
saying of those who were unbelievers in former times.
;
May God resist them. How are they infatuated ! They
take their priests and their monks for their lords, besides
God, and Christ, the son of Mary; although they are commanded to worship one God only: there is no God
but He ; far bs that from Him, which they associate with



73& EJiJiOJi'S CHAINS.
Him! They seek to extinguish the light of God with
their mouths ; but God willeth no other than to perfect
His hght, although the infidels be averse thereto. It is
He who hath sent His apostle with the direction and
true religion ; that He may cause it to appear superior
to every other religion ; although the idolators be averse
thereto. O, true believers, verily many of the priests
and monks devour the substance of men in vanity, and
obstruct the way of God. But unto those who treasure up gold and silver, and employ it not for the advance
ment of God's true religion, denounce a grievous pun
ishment. On the day of judgment their treasures shall
be intensely heated in the fire of hell, and their fore
heads, and their sides, and their backs shall be stigma
tized therewith; and their tormentors shall say, This is
what ye have treasured up for your souls; taste there
fore that which ye have treasured up."
The Koran says of idols : " Omen, a parable is propounded unto you ; wherefore hearken unto it. Verily,
the idols which ye invoke, besides God, can never create a single fly, although they were all assembled for that
purpose : and if the fly snatch anything from them, they cannot recover the same from it."
Mohammed's paradise.
Sura LVI., of the Koran, says : " These are they who
shall approach near unto God: they shall dwell in gardens of delight. Reposing on couches adorned with
gold and precious stones ; sitting opposite to one an
other thereon. Youths which shall continue in their
bloom for ever, shall go round about to attend them,
with goblets, and beakers, and a cup of flowing wine
:
their heads shall not ache by drinking the same, neither
shall their reason be disturbed : and with fruits of the



MOHAMMEDANISM. 739
sorts which they shall choose, and the flesh of birds
of the kind which they shall desire. And there shall accompany them fair damsels having large black eyes,
resembling pearls hidden in their shells, as a reward
for that which they shall have wrought. They shall not
hear within any vain discourse, or any charge of sin;
but only the salutation, Peace ! Peace ! And the companions of the right hand (how happy shall the compan
ions of the right hand be !) shall have their abode among
lote-trees free from thorns, and trees of many, loaded
regularly with their produce from top to bottom ; under
an extended shade, near a flowing water, and amidst
fruits in abundance, which shall not fail, nor shall be for
bidden to be gathered : and they shall repose themselves
on lofty beds. Verily, we have created the damsels of
Paradise by a peculiar creation ; and we have made them
virgins beloved by their husbands, of equal age with
them; for the delight of the companions of the right
hand. There shall be many of the former religions, and
many of the latter. And the companions of the left hand
(how miserable shall the companions of the left hand
be !) shall dwell amidst burning winds and scalding water,
under the shade of a black smoke, neither cool nor
agreeable."
THE KORAN ON THE JUDGMENT.
Sura LXXXI. says: "When the sun shall be folded
up; and when the stars shall fall;"^ and when the mountains shall be made to pass away; and when the camels
ten months gone with young shall be neglected; and
when the wild beasts shall be gathered together ; and
* Bayard Taylor writes thus : " Till the sun grows cold And the stars are old And the leaves of the Judgment Book unfold."

when the seas shall boil ; and when the souls shall be
joined again to their bodies; and when the girl who hath
been buried alive shall be asked for what crime she was put to death; and when the books shall be laid open; and when the heavens shall be removed; and when hell
shall burn fiercely; and when Paradise shall be brought
near; every soul shall know what it hath wrought"

THE Mohammedan mosques vary somewhat in
their style of architecture in different countries.
Their builders borrowed, generally, from the style
of the various nations who adopted the Moslem faith. In
Christian lands, they seized upon the Christian churches
or cathedrals, and turned them into mosques ; in India,
the mosques are patterned after the temples of the Bud
dhist Jains (this maybe seen in the Mohammedan mosque
on the Hooghly River, near Calcutta) ; and in Turkey,
they accepted the model of the Byzantine architecture of
Constantinople. Two or three features are common in all. The dome is one of the most common ana most

beautiful features of the mosques. Sometimes there is an open square in each mosque, in the centre of which is
a tank or fountain, for the washing required in Moliammedan worship. Arabesques and sentences from the Koran are in

of Moslem teachers, and always wears a turban higher
than that of the common teachers, readers or Moslems
generally. The people hold them in great reverence.
In the direction of Mecca, there is a niche in every mosque, toward which the faithful must look whenever

reading-desk, upon which is a copy of the Koran—in
Arabic, of course—for the Moslems never allow the Ko
ran to be translated ; and as to printing it, that is not

that it is writ
teti. No copy for a pubUc readingwould be allowed to
be printed. Publication in the languages is not permitted,
except far away from Arabia. It would be thought grossly unholy in Turkey to attempt such a thing.
WORSHIP IN THE MOSQUES.
The congregations of the faithful gather for worship in the mosques on Fridays. This is the Moslem Sab
bath, because, say they, Adam was created and died on Friday, and because on Friday the world will be judged.
The worship consists simply of prayers and washings,
with an occasional sermon on a text from the Koran.
During the service every one maintains the utmost sol
emnity ; though, after the service they lounge, chat and
even make bargains in the sacred building. On entering the mosque, the Moslem removes his shoes, carrying
them in his left hand, sole to sole, with great care, putting
his right foot first over the threshold. He then goes
through with the necessary ablutions (often a mere sham,
a mere going through the motions,) and takes his place

upon the matting, laying his shoes before him. The wor
shipers generally arrange themselves in rows facing the niche toward Mecca. Women seldom go to the mosques,
and if they do, they sit apart from the men. The reason
for this is that the Koran does not say that women must pray, and many Moslems believe that women have no
souls. Yet they believe that they will enter Paradise,
but this is only that they may continue to be slaves of

men ; each of the faithful is to have in Paradise, so they
believe, 80,000 slaves and 72 wives, in addition to those
he had in life and who evinced a faithful spirit.
DANCING AND HOWLING DERVISHES.
The Dervishes are Mohammedan monks. They are among the most curious devotees of the Moslem religion.
They perform their wonderful feats on Friday afternoons
in the mosques. Dr. Philip Schaff writes of one of their
performances which he witnessed : " After the preliminary



MOHAMMEDAN MOSQUES AND WORSHII'. 749
exercises of prayer and prostration, they whirl around on
their toes, ring within ring, without touching each other,
for about an hour, until they are utterly exhausted. I

tion of Allah. They made about forty or fifty turnings a minute. The Howling Dervishes swing their heads up
and down, crying incessantly with all their might, 'La Ilaha,
ill' Allah!' and some other phrases, until they are stopped
by sheer exhaustion." All this is done for the same
reasons for which the Fakirs of India, and the devotees
of other nations torment their bodies.
THE SMART AND SMARTING ANSWER OF A DERVISH.
In the north-west provinces of India there lived a Der
vish who was never guilty of using his tongue too freely
in conversation. If a nod or a sisfn would do, he would
spare his words. He was considered a quiet, inoffensive, but shrewd man. He went by the name of " the holy
Dervish."
In the same place there lived a rich, native gentleman,
good-natured, but given now and then to frolics. One day he proposed to some friends to go together
and pay the holy Dervish a visit. "I wish," the gentle
man said, " to puzzle him with three questions which he
will never be able to answer." They found the holy man
sitting near his hut in a newly-plowed field. The Mohammedan gentleman walked up to him, and with great mock humility said unto him, "Holy father, I
am troubled with three questions; will you kindly answer them to me ?" The Dervish gave an affirmative nod.
The gentleman began. " The first question, holy
father, is about God. People say that there is a God
;
but I cannot see Him, and no one can show Him to me,
and therefore, I cannot believe that there is a God. Will you answer this question?" A nod was the answer of
the Dervish.
" My second question," the gentleman continued, "is
about Satan. The Koran says that Satan is created of



MOHAMMEDAN MOSQUES AND WORSHIP. 751
fire. Now, if Satan be created of fire, how can hell-fire
hurt him ? Will you explain that too ?" A nod.
"The third question refers to myself. It is said in the
Koran, that every action of man is decreed ; now, if it
be decreed that I must commit a certain action, how can
God bring me into judgment for that action. Himself
having decreed it? Please, holy father, answer me."
A nod was given by the Dervish, and whilst the party
were standing and gazing at him, he quietly seized a clod
from the newly-plowed field and sent it with all his might at the gentleman's face. The gentleman became
furious, and had the Dervish carried before the judge.
Arriving in court the gentleman stated his complaint,
saying the pain in his head was so severe that he hardly knew how to bear it. The judge looked at the Dervish, and asked whether
these things were so ? A nod was the reply ; but the
judge said, " Please explain yourself for nods will not do
in my court."
The Dervish replied, " This gentleman came to me with his companions, and asked three questions which I carefully answered."
"He did no such thing," the gentleman exclaimed ; " a clod
of earth he threw into my face—and oh, how it pains me !"
The judge looked at the Dervish, and said, " Explain
yourself."
"I will," was the answer. "Please, your honor, this
gentleman said to me that people maintained that there was a God, but he could not see Him, nor could any one
show him God, and therefore he could not believe that
there was a God. Now he says he has pain in his face
from the clod I threw at him, but I cannot see his
pain. Will your honor kindly ask him to show us his
pain, for how can I believe he has any if I cannot see it?"



752 ERROR'S CUAINS.
" Again, this gentleman asked, that if Satan was cre
ated of fire, how could hell-fire hurt him? Now, the
gentleman will admit that Father Adam was created of
earth, and that himself also is earth. Now if he be earth,
how could a clod of earth hurt him ?"
And as to the third question, the Dervish drew him
self up and said with great dignity, "Sir, if it be written
in my late to throw a clod at this gentleman's face, how
can and dare he bring me before the judge?" The judge allowed that the Dervish had answered the
three questions with his clod, but admonished him to an
swer questions in future in a more becoming way, as he
might not be able to get himself off so easily from the
usual penalties at another time.
DAILY WORSHIP.
Five times daily the Moslem says his prayers. On the
ship, in the street, in the house or store, wherever he
may be, and forgetful of all his surroundings, at the hour of prayer he spreads his
mat, sits upon it, turning his face toward Mecca, raises his hands to heaven,
then bends until his fore
head almost touches the
ground. His prayer is,
^iJglE^^iJii^BPffii'F I^^^S^ generally, a recital of the fe first chapter of the Koran. The five hours of prayer
are, first, between day

tower, of each mosque, by the Muezzin, one of the under
officers of the mosque. He chants the words "Allah
is great. I testify that there is no God but Allah. I tes
tify that Mohammed is the apostle of Allah. Come to
prayer. Come to security. Allah is most great. There
is no Deity but Allah!" In the morning he adds,
" Prayer is better than sleep." At night, for the sake of

One of the most celebrated mosques is that of St.

Sophia, at Constantinople. This was once a Christian
cathedral. It was originally built by Constantine the

Great, in 325 A. D. It was destroyed in 404 A. D., re
built, and again destroyed in 532. After this Justinian
restored it. It toolv seven years to build it. Ten tliousand workmen were employed in its erection. It was
built of materials gathered from all over the Roman
Empire, and comprised remains of almost every cele
brated heathen temple of ancient times. The dome ot
the tabernacle was of solid gold, and was surmounted by
a solid golden cross, encrusted with precious stones, in
all weighing seventy-five pounds. The whole cathedral is
said to have cost more than ^65,000,000 (Mr. Neale's estimate, in his volume on the " Eastern Church.") In the year 1453 A. D., when the Turks entered Con
stantinople, they appropriated this cathedral for a mosque. The Christian emblems were removed, de
stroyed or covered up with plaster; the crosses were
chiseled out of the walls ; the great cross on the summit
of the dome was removed, and the crescent took its
place. The crescent is a half moon, with the horns
turned upward. It is the distinctive Turkish emblem, and, in some sense, the Mohammedan symbol also.
THE JUMMAH MUSJID AT DELHI, INDIA.
In Delhi itself is probably the finest Mohammedan
mosque in all India. This is called the Jummah Musjid
(the Pearl Mosque). It is built entirely of sandstone, and
is raised upon a high terrace. This masterpiece of Indo
Mohammedan architecture is the most venerable monument of the Moslems in India. Vivid though severe
colors clothe every part of the building. After mounting
long flights of steps, the visitor passes through huge
bronze doors into a large, open court, with a fountain in
its centre. At one side is a piece of black marble, in
which is the print of Mohammed's foot—at least, the priests



MOHAMMEDAN MOSQUES AND WORSHIP. 755
say so. In the interior, the roof, pillars and pavement
are of the purest white marble, embroidered with finest
arabesques. These arabesques are composed of colored
marbles, and precious stones inlaid in the marble in vari
ous patterns of scroll-work or of inscription. Bishop

Heber said of this structure: " Tliis spotless sanctuary,
showing;- such a pure spirit of adoration made me a
Christian, feel humbled, when I considered that no archi
tect of our religion had ever been able to produce any

thing equal to this temple of Allah." But the worship is
not now so pure. The building is reverenced by the Mohammedans, not merely on account of its age or won
drous beauty, but because it contains a most highly
esteemed relic of Mohammed. From a small nook of
solid marble, with a carefully-locked door, the priests
take, for the inspection of visitors and devotees, a small
silver case; with slowest, most cautious reverence, the
casket is unlocked, and the priest exposes to view

a hair from Mohammed's beard. What would that fierce
hater of relics and idols, Mohammed, say, could he but see how far his modern disciples have departed from his
teachings ? Besides the hair, they retain as relics a garment and a pair of sandals which once belonged to the
prophet.
Delhi is to the Moslems of India what Mecca is to the Moslems of Arabia and Egypt. The city is surrounded
by walls seven miles in extent. In the suburbs one rides
through miles of ruins of mosques, towers and tombs..
Few cities have had as splendid a career as Delhi, and few
have suffered as greatly. One of the marks of the Mo
hammedan conquest in India, 600 years ago, is the giant
tower of the Koutub, near Aorra. It is the highest tower,
standing alone, in the world ; built of red sandstone,
fluted, and has five stories. The mention of Agra recalls,
one of the most famous structures of the world, erected
by a Moslem Mogul of India. Shortly after a visit to this famous Mohammedan monument, Dr. H. M. Field wrote
the accompanying description of it and of his visit:
THE TAJ MAHAL, THE "JEWEL OF INDL\."

erected before. To carry out his purpose, he gathered

76o ERROR'S CHAINS.
result was a structure which cost fabulous sums of money
(the whole empire being placed under contribution for it, as were the Jews for the Temple of Solomon), and em
ployed 20,000 workmen for seventeen years. The build
ing thus erected is one of the most fam.ous in the world

like the Alhambra or St Peter's—and of which enthu
siastic travelers are apt to say that it is worth going
around the world to see. This would almost discourage
the attempt to describe it, but I will try and give some
faint idea of its marvelous beauty.
But how can I describe to others what is but a picture
in my memory 1 Descriptions of architecture are apt to
be vague, unless aided by pictorial illustrations. Mere figures and measurements are dry and cold. The most
I shall aim at will be to give a general (but I hope not
indistinct) impression of it. For this, let us approach it
gradually.
It stands on the banks of the Jumna, a mile below the fort at Agra. As you approach it, it is not exposed ab
ruptly to view, but is surrounded by a garden. You enter under a lofty gateway, and before you is an avenue
of cypresses, a third of a mile long, whose dark foliage is
a setting for a form of dazzling whiteness at the end.
That is the Taj. It stands, not on the level of your eye,
but on a double terrace; the first, of red sandstone, 20
feet high and i ,000 feet broad, at the extremities of which
stand two mosques, of the same dark stone, facing each
other. Midway between rises the second terrace, of
marble, 1 5 feet high and 300 feet square, on the corners
of which stand four marble minarets. In the centre of
all, thus " reared in air," stands the Taj. It is built of
marble — no other material than this, of pure and stain
less white, was fit for a purpose so sacred. It is 150 feet
square (or rather, it is eight-sided, since the corners are









l-lii






MOHAMMEDAN MOSQ'JES AND WORSHIP. 761
truncated), and surmounted by a dome, which rises nearly 200 feet above the pavement below.
These figures rather belittle the Taj, or, at least, dis
appoint those who looked for great size. There are
many larger buildings in the world. But that which dis
tinguishes it from all others, and gives it a rare and ideal
beauty, is the union of majesty and grace. This is the
peculiar effect of Saracenic architecture. The slender
columns, the springing arches, the swelling domes, the
tall minarets, all combine to give an impression of airy
lightness, which is not destroyed even when the founda
tions are laid with massive solidity. But it is in the finish
of their structure that they excelled all the world.
Bishop Heber said truly : " They built like Titans and
finished like jewelers." This union of two opposite fea
tures makes the beauty of the Taj. While its walls are
thick and strong, they are pierced by high arched win
dows which relieve their heaviness. Vines and ara
besques running over the stone-work give it the light
ness of foliage, of trees blossoming with flowers. In the
interior there is an extreme and almost feminine erace,
as if here the strength of man would pay homage to the
delicacy of woman. Inclosing the sacred place is a
screen of marble, carved into a kind of fret-work, and
so pure and white that light shines through it as through
alabaster, falling softly on that which is within. The
Emperor, bereaved of his wife, lavished riches on her
very dust, casting precious stones upon her tomb as if
he were placing a string of pearls around her neck. It
is overrun with vines and flowers, cut in stone, and set
with onyx, and jasper, and lapis-lazuli, carnelians and
turquoises, and chalcedonies, and sapphires.
But the body rests in the crypt below. We descend
a tew steps and stand by the very sarcophagus in which



762 Emoon's CHAINS.
all that loveliness is enshrined. Another sarcophagus
contains the body of her husband. Their tombs were
covered with fresh flowers, a perpetual tribute to that love
which was so strongf even on the throne, to those who
were thus united in life, and in death are not divided.
-r--^-:r;*J
INTERIOR OF THE TAJ, THE TOMB OF MAHAL.
Here sentiment comes in to affect our sense of the
beauty of the place. If it were not for the touching his
tory connected with it, I could not agree with those who
pronounce the Taj the most beautiful building in the
world. Merely as a building, it does not "overcome"
me so much as another marble structure—the Cathedral



MOHAMMEDAN MOSQUES AND WORSHIP. 7&i
of Milan. I could not say with Bishop Heber that the
mosques of Islam are more beautiful, or more in har
mony with the spirit of devotion, than Christian churches
or cathedrals. But the Taj is not a mosque, It is a tomb

a monument to the dead. And that gives it a tender
interest, which spiritualizes the cold marble, and makes
it more than a building—a poem and a dream.
As we came out the moon was riding high overhead,
flooding the marble pile with beauty. Round and
round we walked, looking up at arch and dome and
minaret. At such an hour the Taj was so pale and ghost
like, that it did not seem like a building reared by human
hands, but to have grown where it stood—like a night
blooming Cereus, rising slowly in the moonlight—lifting its •domes and pinnacles (like branches growing heaven
"ward) toward that world which is the home of the love which it was to preserve in perpetual memory. With such thoughts we kept our eyes fixed on that
glittering vision, as if we feared that even as we gazed
it might vanish out of our sight. Below us the Jumna,
flowing silently, seemed like an image of human life as it
glided by. And so at last we turned to depart, and bade
farewell to the Taj, feeling that we should never look at
it again ; but hoping that it might stand for ages to tell
its history of faithful love to future generations. Flow
on, sweet Jumna, by the marble walls, reflecting the
-moonbeams on thy placid breast ; and in thy gentle murmurs whispering evermore of Love and Death, and Love
that cannot die !

faithful. The long processions, mounted on camels,
gorgeously caparisoned, file out from the cities, and across hill, and plain, and over the desert to Mecca. Mohamme
danism is probably the most active of the non-Christian
religions. The pilgrimages, the numbers of missionaries
and the seeming devotion of the people, as manifested in
their attendance at the mosques, and on the occasions of
festivals indicate this. One of their festivals, celebrated in
India, arouses their religious zeal, and carries it to the
highest pitch of fanaticism. This is the feast of Mohur
rim, the Moslem "Feast of Martyrs," commemorating the bloody death of Mohammed's grandsons. "The martyrdom of these Moslem saints is commemorated by
little shrines in their houses, made of paper and tinsel,'
and on the great day of the feast they go in procession
out of the city (of Delhi) to a cemetery five miles distant where they bury them in newly-opened graves. Men, women and children by tens of thousands on foot, and
others in bullock-carts or mounted on horses, camels and
elephants. Immense crowds gather by the road-side,
mounting the steps of old palaces or climbing to the
tops of houses, to see this mighty procession pass, as it
•goes rolling forward in a wild frenzy to the cemetery.
There they lay down these images of their saints as they
would bury their dead."
CONCLUSION.
The Mohammedan religion was established by the
sword, it has constantl)' suffered by the sword, it seems
destined to perish by the sword. Its history is tracked
with blood. It has kept back the nations that have ac
cepted it, retarding their progress. It has degraded
woman. It has no teachings of sin or a Sacrifice or a,
Saviour. God is the "All merciful," but His mercy is.



76b hKKOJ^S CHAINS.
according to Moslem teachings, with utter disregard of
justice. To be a Moslem is all that is necessary to ob
tain mercy, to refuse to yield to the faith of Mohammed
is all that is needed to deprive one of God's mercy. The
idea of God is cold and cruel, with no idea of the Father.
But Mohammedanism has rendered this service to the
world, it has greatly lessened idolatry. The most stub
born opposition to Christian missionary work comes from the Mohammedans. But the whole building of Moham
medanism, especially in its political relations, seems to be
tottering and crumbling, and threatens soon to fall in
ruins.
May the Cross soon gain a peaceful, bloodless triumph over the Crescent

sayings of the masters of religious teachings, and in com
parison with those of Jesus the Christ, their light is as
that of a candle compared with the light of the sun.
Undoubtedly this conviction has forced itself upon the
mind of the reader as he has considered the various sys
tems of religion ; that there is not one among them all
that can do for the world that which Christianity can ac
'complish. Compare the founders of religions with the
Founder of Christianity, in their lives, characters and
teachings. Compare together the sacred books ; the Vedas, the laws of Manu, the Zend-Avesta, the Tripi
takas and the Koran, with the Bible. Compare the ef
fects of these religions upon the political, social, civil and
domestic life of the people with the effects of Christian
ity; compare Christian and heathen lands. Christian and heathen homes. Christian and heathen governments.
Compare the best parts of the best of heathen religions
with any part of Christianity. One cannot but see the
marked contrasts, and the infinite superiority of Chris
tianity. This being so, then does it not follow that they
•who are seeking to give the Gospel of Jesus the Christ
to the world are rendering a service to the cause of hu
manity? And they are but obeying the command of
Jesus Christ to " preach the Gospel to every creature."
A young curate, who had fed on Sydney Smith's diet of
-sarcastic witticisms, once approached the Duke of Wel
lington with the question, " Do you not think that the
work of converting the Hindus is all a fanatical farce ?"
"Look to your marching orders, sir!" the stern old Iron
Duke replied. Common gratitude moves us to desire
that the world shall be made to know of Jesus Christ. When we read of the worship of our heathen ancestors,
and remember that we should have been doing to-day as
they did, had it not been for the Christian men who took

the Gospel to England, we feel new obligations resting
upon us. Further, all things are working to this end.
Inventions, explorations, the discoveries of science, pro
gress in government, everything waits upon this work.
THE STORY OF THE WORK.
It began 1,850 years ago. A Christian man named Paul went among the heathen of Asia Minor and South
eastern Europe—among the worshipers of the gods of
Greece and Rome—to tell them of Christ. He was ac
companied by other Christians. They met with con
siderable success, though they were made to suffer for it.
In later years, from Rome, that had then become
the centre of Christianity, other Christians went to
Western Europe. From Greenland, of the Arctic Zone,
to the West Indies, of the Tropics, Christianity was ex
tended. Nation after nation gave up its idols, cruel customs were abolished, and a purer life and worship
was begun. But it was left for the last hundred years to
witness the development of this work to its greatest
extent.
THE PRESENT POSITION OF THE CHRISTIAN ARMY.
The Christian camp-fires are lighted and the tents of
the Christian army have been erected in almost every land of the globe. The conquering army pursues only
peaceful methods; it does not seek to drive but to win;
not to harm but to help. In gaining its present position many lives have been lost, many sacrifices have been
made. It has had to contend for the ground it occupies,
inch by inch ; the forces of idolatry have been mustered
against its advance. The giant Goliath, Heathenism, has
counted on a speedy destruction of the stripling David,
Christianity. One country after another has opened its^



THE WORLD'S RETURN TO ITS FIRST WORSHIP. y^j
doors to the coming of Christianity. India, in the year
1 705, opened her doors only to close them again after a
little ; since 1830, however, the work has been prosecuted
vigorously. China, in 1807, and Japan, in 1859, wel
comed the first Protestant Christian missionaries. Thus,
too, other countries of Asia, Africa and the Islands of the
Pacific have received the Christian heralds, within the
last hundred years. Now behold them' marshaled for
the fight. Let us hastily glance at the various fields in
succession.
A FLIGHT OVER THE FIELDS.
Let US rub our Aladdin's lamps, and summon the
genii to bear us away over the world. Let us on imagi
nation's swift wings fly over the battle-fields.*
In Japan we see Buddhism being galvanized into a
new life for the moment, and Shintoism cast off by the gov
ernment and in great part by the people. We see a few
new temples being erected, but many old ones falling into ruins. Western ideas have been introduced, and western
civilization is making rapid progress in this most eastern
land. One hundred and twenty-three Christian mission
aries have won 3,000 Japanese to join their churches. The Japanese have the New Testament in their own
language. Corea has just been reached by missionaries, and the New Testament is being published in the Corean
language. Old China is being brought to the childhood of con
version to Christ ; her conservatism is passing away ; her
exclusive policy is being yielded up; her hatred of the

foreigners (the "foreign devils" and " tTarbarians ") is being overcome and replaced by respect and in some
cases by love. To-day a man behaving himself properly
and not bearing himself insolently, can travel unmolested
in any part of China, even where foreigners once were
murdered. Every one of its provinces has been visited
by Christian missionaries ; in almost all they reside. The
language (said to have been invented by the devil to
perplex missionaries) is very thoroughly understood and
used. Their false science and law is being replaced by
true instruction. Christ is taking Confucius's place, as it
is seen that his teaching can never regenerate China.
Buddha's dreary faith of annihilation, and Lao-tze's super
stitious materialism are being slowly yielded up by the
people. The taking of this Gibraltar of heathenism is by no means accomplished ; yet her walls are being
scaled, and a foothold on their summit gained. They that
have turned the world upside down have gone thither also. By unique and unexpected providence, God is
aiding His workers. The recent terrible famine was such
a providence. Yet while the number of converts is not
great, a very great deal of unseen work has been ac
complished. It seems as though a whole legion of devils
catch up the seed of the Gospel sown in China, almost
as quickly as it touches the ground ; still some, and much,
brings forth good fruit. Considering the powerful oppo
sition, the gigantic obstacle^,, the almost insurmountable
difficulties, that there should be 19,000 living Chinese
Christians to-day, and probably 85,000 nominal Chris
tians, is surprising. To-day 496 missionaries are at work
in China, seeking to convert its 400,000,000 people.
Moravian missionaries are preaching the Gospel of
Christ on the borders of Thibet, the stronghold of Bud
dhism. It is here that the Buddhist Lama or Pope resides.



THE IVORLD-S RETURN TO (TS F/RST WORSHIP. j»^
; In Siam great changes have recently occurred. The
-country is now open to foreigners ; a missionary is in
charge of the government school and this nation, like
Japan, seems to be progressing toward the light. Twenty
four missionaries (one among Chinese colonists), with 631
converts represent the strength of the church there.
In Assam " the light of a brighter day gilds the hill
tops and spreads along the valleys, ripening the long
corn-fields for the reaper's sickle." Long and patient
toil has not as yet been rewarded with great harvest
gatherings, but the missionaries look forward in patient
waiting for a better day. There are 1 3 churches, with
1,800 members; 26 missionaries, and 75 native preachers.
There are European missionaries in Borneo, Celebes,
and the Moluccas ; among the aborigines of Australia,
a.nd in the Island of Mauritius. What a grand work has been done in Burmah, where
missionary labor has been so emphatically blessed ; among Burmese, Karens, Shans and Kakyens. The young mission at Bhamo is in a precarious condition at present, owing to the relations of King Thee-bau to England ; yet
the missionaries there stand by their posts. The Bud
dhism of Burmah seems as yet but little affected by the
presence of Christianity ; the work among the Karens has made more rapid progress than among the Burmese,
because of the preparation for the Gospel by their singu
lar traditions and prophecies. There are 23,000 Christians, the nucleus of a Chrisdan community of about
75,000. There are 103 missionaries in Burmah.
India has been very thoroughly evangelized. The
opposition of the representatives of so-called Christian
nations, the strength of caste, and the attachment to the
elaborate system of Hinduism were the principal obsta
cles to the progress of Christianity. Five-sixths of all

the converts are from the lower castes or ranks of the
people. By education in mission-schools, but mainly by
direct preaching, about 1 1 5,000 converts have been made.
There is a native Christian community (M. A. Sherring

ries were at work in 1875. One of the most extraordinary
events of all modern missionary history was the sudden

awakened, and a wonderful transformation is occurring.

nas, and the women of India are becoming aware of a new life of which they never dreamed. All over India,
Christian villages and churches dot the land; and before
another generation has passed away, if the increase shall
be proportionate to the recent past, India will be a Chris
tian country. The Brahmo-Somaj, a sort of reform on
Brahminism, has recently drawn very near to Christianity,
and as illustrated by Keshub Chunder Sen's recent remarkable address may soon become a Christian body. Little has been undertaken in Afghanistan, Beloochistan
or Arabia, as yet. There are 29 missionories and 1,376
converts in Persia. The converts are principally from
the Nestorians, who have long been nominally Christians. Access to the Mohammedans is becoming easier. In Turkey, momentous changes are occurring. The
despicable, despotic government is losing its power.
Here the first triumphs of the first missionaries were won. The old Armenian race, the Anglo-Saxons of the
East, who received Christianity in the fourth century,
have in later years shown a remarkable readiness to re
ceive Protestant preaching. The Mohammedans, here
as elsewhere, are almost inaccessible. In Constantinople
alone, a city of the size of Philadelphia, they have 300
mosques. There are 158 missionaries in Turkey, and
7,200 converts, and 14,000 children in their schools. In
Syria there is a strong missionary body. It is difficult
to reach the Jews, Mussulmans and Christians (Greek
and Roman Catholic churches), because of their exceed
ing religiosity. The American Congregationalists and
Presbyterians, and also the Church of England, have
missionaries here. There are 1,317 Protestant Chris
tians, no missionaries, and 12,057 scholars in Syria.
Central Asia is almost the only part of the world yet

been done by the brave old Joseph Wolff and English
officers. •':^ ::
Africa, the dark continent, has a population of about
200,000,000. Mohammedanism has thoroughly overrun
Africa, especially the northern portions. Fetichism, the
lowest form of idolatry, holds the great mass of the Af
rican peoples. There are two missions in Egypt ; the
British, with one missionary and two stations, and the
American, with twenty-two missionaries, thirty-four sta
tions and 1,000 members, mainly from the Copts, an old
Christian sect. The children in the mission-schools are
mostly Mohammedan. In South Africa twelve or fifteen
societies have not less than 40,000 converts. The west
ern coast, from Sierra Leone to the Gulf of Guinea, is
fringed with Christian missions. At the mouth of the Congo, on the west, and on the Niger and Zanzibar
coast, on the east, the missions are flourishing. The
greatest interest attaches to the very recent occupancy
of Central Africa. On November 15th, 1876, Stanley's famous letter, mentioning King Mtesa's request for
Christian teachers, was received. A few days after,
$20,000 were offered to found a mission at Victoria Ny
anza. Within seven months a picked party of seven
missionaries stood on the eastern shore of Africa. They
have experienced great difficulties and met with slight
success.
Madagascar may be called a Christian country now,
as may also the Sandwich Islands, the British West In
dies, and, perhaps, the greater part of the islands of Poly
nesia. In Mexico, and in South America, as in the Papal
lands of Europe, Protestant missionaries are laboring.
" The field is the world ;" the motto is—the world for
Christ and Christ for the world. The great triumphs of
the past are being eclipsed by the greater ones of the



THE WORLD'S RETURN TO ITS FIRST WORSHIF. j>jj
present. The old decrepit and deformed sects of Chris
tianity, long sleeping if not long dead, are taking on a
new life. The Pagan religions are attempting the im
possible task of preventing the incoming of Christianity;
but their thraldom is broken, and everywhere the dropping
of the broken fetters is heard. Mohammedanism alone
is gathering itself with vigor to resist and repel and
overcome Christianity, but its sword has been wrested
from its grasp. The conquests of Christianity have not
been won by might of sword ; her victories over old
faiths have not been gained by worldly wisdom. By
love, by persuasion, by patient toil and suffering, the self
offered but God-called missionaries have done this work.
God be praised for their lives, their works and their suc
cesses. May the day soon come when, his " Gospel having been published throughout the whole world for a
testimony to all the nations," Christ, by whose command they went forth, shall come and gather out of all nations His own!
