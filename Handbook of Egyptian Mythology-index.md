INTRODUCTION
WHAT IS A MYTH?
If asked this question, most people would reply that a myth is a story that is not
true, even though you might want it to be. Scholarly arguments about the defi
nition of a myth have been going on for more than 2,000 years. Many defini
tions have been proposed. Among the most common are that myths are stories
about gods, myths are sacred stories, myths are stories that explain the way the
world is, or myths are simply traditional stories that hand on collective knowl
edge or experience.
Writers from various disciplines and intellectual movements have inter
preted myth in different ways. Myths have been seen as a “disease of lan
guage,” as garbled memories of historical events, as a mode of prelogical
thought, as expressions of the subconscious mind, as symbolic descriptions of
the natural world or symbolic statements about the social order, and as the
spoken part of ritual.1 As theories to explain the whole of world mythology,
these interpretations all have flaws, but each of them is applicable to some
Egyptian myths.
In his book on the meaning and functions of myth, G. S. Kirk proposed
three main categories of myths.2 His first category is myths told for entertain
ment. This is a reminder that myths may be sacred, but they are not necessarily
solemn. The validity of this category might be challenged, but some cultures do
seem to have told one version of a myth for entertainment while another, more
secret version, was used in rituals.3
Kirk’s second category includes operative, iterative, or validatory myths.
These are stories about things that may not have really happened, but the sto
ries themselves are thought to have power to transform the real world. Such
myths “tend to be repeated regularly on ritual or ceremonial occasions . . . to
bring about a desirable continuity in nature or society.”4 Myths that are used to
justify and maintain a particular institution or state of affairs are sometimes
known as charter myths. In Kirk’s third category are explanatory or speculative
myths. These may be simple etiological myths that explain the origin of an ob
ject, custom, or natural feature,5 or they may be complex myths that try to an



swer the questions that have always troubled humanity, such as why people
die. Some myths seem to acknowledge that these questions may be unanswer
able but provide strategies for coping with the sorrows and contradictions of hu
man life. Examples of all these different categories of myths can be found
within Egyptian mythology. In order to explore this mythology, we must first
look at the geography and history of Ancient Egypt.
MYTH AND GEOGRAPHY
Egypt is a large country in the northeast corner of the continent of Africa, but
modern geographical terms have little relevance to how the Ancient Egyptians
saw themselves. They had no conception of the huge size of Africa. In the third
millennium BCE the Egyptians’ known world extended only from what are now
Greece and Turkey in the north to what is now Ethiopia in the south, and from
Libya in the west to what is now Iraq in the east (see Map Two). The Egyptians
believed that they were set apart from the people who lived in these surround
ing countries. The ancient word Kemet (usually translated as Egypt) literally
means Black Land. This referred to the rich black soil of the land on either bank
of the great river Nile, which flows through the center of Egypt. The Egyptians
were claiming to be the people of the valley, but they had not always been so.
For many millennia North Africa enjoyed a moist climate. Vast areas that
are now desert were then grasslands with large animal populations. Nomadic
peoples, all with a fairly similar culture, ranged across the grasslands. From
around the sixth millennium BCE on, the climate became drier and hotter, and
the grasslands gradually turned into desert. The first Egyptians built villages on
the edges of the Nile valley, where they mainly survived by hunting and fishing.
By the fourth millennium BCE, agriculture-based communities were established
in the Nile valley and Delta. This great climatic and cultural change may have
shaped the idea found in Egyptian myth that the world had once been different.
Egypt had become one of the driest places on earth and a hard country to
get in or out of. To the north there were marshes, saltwater lakes, and the
Mediterranean Sea. The Ancient Egyptians were never enthusiastic seafarers
and were one of the few coastal cultures to worship no deities of the sea. To the
east, west, and south there were deserts that were dangerous to cross. These
deserts made up about 90 percent of Egypt’s territory. The Egyptians called
them the Red Land in contrast to the Black Land of the valley.6 The mountain
ous areas of the deserts contained gold, gemstones, and types of hard stone that
could be used to make long-lasting buildings and artifacts. The south of the
country often went without rain for many years at a stretch. When rain did

come, it was in the form of violent desert storms that could lead to destructive
flash floods. The usually cloudless skies made it particularly easy for the
Egyptians to observe the stars and planets. Much early mythology may have de
veloped to explain the movement of celestial bodies.
The habitable part of Egypt was effectively a giant oasis created by the Nile
and its annual flood, which is known as the inundation. Every year a combina
tion of melting snows and monsoon rains in the mountains of Ethiopia caused a
huge increase in the amount of water in the Nile. When the swollen river
reached Egypt, it flooded all the low-lying land in the Nile valley and Delta, de
positing a thick layer of silt.7 As the floods went down, the fields were planted,
and crops such as emmer wheat and barley grew very quickly in the moist, fer
tile soil. In a good year, the Egyptians could grow more grain than they needed
to feed the population. In bad years, the flood might not be high enough to
reach all the fields, or it might be too high and sweep away villages and towns
and drown thousands of people. The whole welfare of the country depended on
this one phenomenon, and because of this the Ancient Egyptians seem to have
felt both uniquely blessed and uniquely vulnerable.
Aspects of the inundation were personified as deities (see “Hapy” in
“Deities, Themes, and Concepts”), but there was no god or goddess of the Nile.

The annual rising of the Nile was thought of as part of the divine order of things
decreed by a creator deity. This divine order was known as maat, and the cre
ator was often identified with the god of the sun. The sun was the great
provider of the light and warmth necessary for life. Its rays were also powerful
enough to blind or kill. From early times on, the Egyptians believed that they
needed a spiritual leader who could treat with the dangerous world of the gods
on behalf of humanity. This leader was usually a king with semidivine status.
In Egypt, concepts that might in other cultures belong to the realm of ab
stract philosophy were expressed by symbols, images, and, to a lesser extent,
myths. The divine order envisaged by the Egyptians placed their country at the
center of the created world. This world was still surrounded by the primeval
waters (the nun) from which the creator had originally emerged. The ultimate
source of the Nile and the inundation was believed to be in the nun. Foreign
lands and the deserts that bordered the Nile valley were said to belong to the
realm of chaos (isfet), the force that constantly threatened the divine order.
There was a tradition that the creator and the numerous gods and goddesses
whom he/she had created originally lived in Egypt itself. At the beginning of
history they withdrew up into the heavens or down under the earth, though
their spirits might be persuaded to reside in shrines built for them by the king.
The Egyptians believed that some supernatural beings could still be encoun
tered in the wilder regions of the earth, such as the remote desert and the areas
of untamed marshland on the edges of the Nile valley and in parts of the Delta.
Many of the key events in Egyptian myth, such as the burial of the mur
dered god Osiris, were supposed to have happened in specific places in Egypt or
in its neighboring countries. Thus a mythical geography can be superimposed
on the physical geography. Every major Egyptian temple was designed as a
miniature cosmos in which the main events in mythical history were repeat
edly played out, so there came to be many “tombs of Osiris.” It is this kind of
apparent contradiction that has led many distinguished scholars to write about
Egyptian myth in a tone of baffled irritation. G. S. Kirk complained that a “lib
eralism of interpretation, amounting at times to a chaotic indifference to con
sistency and meaning, is characteristic of Egyptian thought.”8 Much of this con
fusion can be resolved if the myths are examined in the contexts in which they
occur, rather than in isolation.
HISTORY AND THE SOURCES OF EGYPTIAN MYTH
Ancient Egyptian religion had no official holy book equivalent to the Bible or the
Koran (Quran). The relationships between deities did not become fixed at one

moment in time but went on changing and developing for thousands of years.
Egyptian mythology was never gathered by priests into one “authorized version”
or harmonized in any long literary work comparable to Hesiod’s Theogony, an
important source for the study of Greek mythology. Comparatively few literary
treatments of myths survive from any stage of the Egyptian language.
The mythology of Ancient Egypt has to be laboriously pieced together from
a variety of written and visual sources. The extent and nature of these sources
varied greatly during the 3,500 years that the native Pharaonic culture domi
nated Egypt. The remainder of this chapter will give a historical overview of the
sources for Egyptian myth.
PROTODYNASTIC (DYNASTY 0) AND EARLY DYNASTIC PERIODS (DYNASTIES 1–2): C. 3200–2686 BCE
According to a tradition found in ancient chronologies, Egypt was originally di
vided into separate kingdoms of Upper (southern) and Lower (northern) Egypt. A
King Menes was said to have united these kingdoms and founded a new capital
at Memphis to be the “balance of the Two Lands.” Menes cannot easily be iden
tified with any specific king known from contemporary records.
Early Kings
There is plenty of archaeological evidence for a series of powerful southern
kings in the late fourth millennium BCE. The hieroglyphic system of writing
may have been invented for administrative and ritual purposes at the court of
these kings.9 Two early towns were associated with their rule: Nagada, later
known as Ombos, where the local god was Seth, and Nekhen, later known as
Hierakonpolis, where a falcon god was prominent. This falcon god came to be
identified with Horus, although Horus seems to have been a northern god
in origin.
There is much less evidence for a unified northern kingdom at this time.
The gods Seth and Horus were later presented as warring opposites in need of
reconciliation. Some Egyptologists have argued that a historical war between
Ombos and Hierakonpolis, or between the north and south of Egypt, was the
origin of the myth of the conflict between Horus and Seth.10 This kind of “his
toricizing” approach to myth has been out of fashion for many years but has re
cently been revived.
Introduction 5



Objects from the late Protodynastic Period belonging to kings called
Narmer, Aha, and Scorpion have been recovered from temple deposits at
Hierakonpolis and Abydos. These kings may have been rulers of most of
Egypt. They probably all contributed to the legend of Menes the Uniter. Their
ritual objects belong to a formative stage in Egyptian art. Strict rules were be
ing developed to govern the content and style of the art used in palaces, tem
ples, or tombs. This formal court-based art rapidly replaced previous styles
and became the standard canon for over 3,000 years.11 Myths often focus on
episodes of intense conflict or tragedy, but the Egyptian rules of “decorum”
usually made it impermissible to illustrate such episodes in formal art. The
images used in art were felt to have power to affect the real world, so order
had to be shown triumphing over chaos and good over evil. Violent mythical
episodes such as that in which Seth tears out the eye of Horus were not repre
sented directly.
The King and the Gods
From the First Dynasty onward, every Egyptian king was called a Horus. The
extent to which Egyptian rulers were regarded as divine is much disputed,12
but the kings of the Early Dynastic Period certainly enjoyed more power and
responsibility than anyone else in their culture. They were rulers of the first
large nation-state in history. The king was the political, religious, and mili
tary leader of this state. Royal annals for the Early Dynastic Period partially
survive in a copy on the Palermo Stone and related fragments.13 The annals
list the kings of Egypt, starting with a series of prehistoric kings.
Seal impressions and small bone or wood labels of the Early Dynastic
Period portray kings engaging with a variety of deities.14 Mesopotamian seals
and sealings of a comparable date appear to show episodes or characters from
myths set in the realm of the gods. The Egyptian pieces mainly show deities
as “resident” in statues or cult objects in man-made shrines. The labels record
(or anticipate) visits by kings to shrines in different parts of the country. The
royal annals record many years for which the most important events were
deemed to be the dedication of cult images or the king’s participation in ritu
als, such as visiting the sacred lake of the god Heryshef (“He who is upon his
lake”) or “spearing the hippopotamus.”15
There is plenty of evidence by the Early Dynastic Period for a complex
pantheon of Egyptian deities who could be represented in a variety of human,
animal, or semihuman forms. Whether myths about these deities were cur

rent at this stage is hard to say. The unification of the country and the subse
quent patronage of local cults by each king must have led to some kind of or
ganization of the pantheon at this time. Deities began to be grouped into
pairs, groups, or hierarchies. The creation of relationships between deities
who had previously been worshipped in isolation may have generated myths.
Among the earliest pairings of deities were the Two Ladies and the Two
Lords. The Two Ladies were the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjyt. In the sym
bolic language that had developed to express ideas about kingship, the Two
Ladies represented Upper and Lower Egypt and were identified with the
White Crown of the south and the Red Crown of the north. The Two Lords
were Horus and Seth. Most Early Dynastic Period kings associated them
selves with Horus by showing a Horus falcon on the serekh that enclosed
their names. The names and titles taken by a king at the start of his reign
identified the ways in which he manifested Horus and acted as a kind of pol
icy statement.
During the Second Dynasty a king called Peribsen replaced the Horus fal
con with the curious composite animal that represented the god Seth.
Peribsen may have been trying to assert the primacy of his local god, but he
seems to have lost his throne to a king called Khasekhemwy from
Hierakonpolis. Khasekhemwy placed both the Horus falcon and the Seth ani
mal above his name and included the phrase “the Two Lords are at rest in
him” in his title. This seems to be an early example of the Egyptian tendency
to present actual conflicts in mythological terms.
Two sculptures of Khasekhemwy wearing the White Crown may be the
oldest known statues of a specific historical ruler from anywhere in the
world. The king’s enemies are shown as a chaotic mass of contorted figures
under his feet, so the statues embody the triumph of order over chaos. The
reign of Khasekhemwy seems to have marked a change in royal policy.
Recent excavations have confirmed that he built several huge funerary com
plexes at several different sites. A greater proportion of the country’s re
sources seems to have been diverted toward the royal mortuary cult. The em
phasis was shifting from a system in which the king honored the gods and
goddesses in their local shrines to one in which the gods and goddesses were
brought together to help sanctify the king in life and the afterlife.
This trend developed further in the Third Dynasty. Some Egyptologists
place the Third Dynasty at the end of the Early Dynastic Period, whereas oth
ers put it at the beginning of the Old Kingdom. Ancient Egyptian king lists
gave particular prominence to a Third Dynasty ruler called Netjerikhet, later
known as Djoser (Zoser). His reign was regarded as the beginning of a new era.
Introduction 7



OLD KINGDOM (DYNASTIES 3–6) AND FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (DYNASTIES 7–11): C. 2686–2055 BCE
In later times the Egyptians looked back on the Old Kingdom as a golden age of
stability and achievement. King Djoser was remembered for thousands of years
as the king for whom the first pyramid was built. This was the step pyramid at
Saqqara, one of the world’s earliest great stone buildings. Early Dynastic kings
had high-walled funerary enclosures in mud brick and separate tombs under
great mounds. The two forms were put together at Saqqara, so the mound had
to become higher to be visible above the great enclosure walls. A mound was
also found as the focal point of some early temples, such as at Hierakonpolis.
Such mounds may represent the Primeval Mound that features in Egyptian cre
ation myths (see “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”), but there is no written evi
dence from this period to confirm this.
The Pyramid Builders
The man in charge of building the pyramid complex of Djoser was an official
named Imhotep. At this period, literacy was mainly confined to such officials
and their households. Many of these officials served as part-time priests in the
cult places of deities and deceased kings.16 Imhotep, who was a priest of the sun
god at Heliopolis, was later credited with writing a book of wisdom. This
earned him a place as the first of Egypt’s great sages and eventual deification
(see “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). The tradition may reflect an actual ad
vance in the uses of writing at this period.
The development of long, connected texts only seems to have taken place
in Egypt centuries after the introduction of writing. An incomplete naos (inner
shrine) from Heliopolis that dates to Djoser’s reign is carved with some of the
earliest known integrated texts and reliefs. The images of the gods shown in the
carvings on the naos are accompanied by short speeches saying what they will
do for the king. These images may be the oldest surviving representation of the
Ennead of Heliopolis, a group of nine deities that was very important in the cre
ation myths recorded in later times. Some of these myths could already have
been current, but whether they were written down or existed only in oral form
is not clear. A type of religious text that does seem to have developed in this pe
riod was the topographical list.17 This listed deities according to their cult
places and summarized their functions and qualities with epithets. Some epi

thets, such as Horus, “protector of his father,” suggest the existence of a story
behind them.
In the Fourth Dynasty the king’s role was redefined as being “‘the son of Ra,”
the deputy of the sun god on earth. Sneferu, the first king of the Fourth Dynasty,
was one of Egypt’s greatest builders. Three pyramids were completed in his reign,
each with two temples for the funerary cult of the king. Later literary tradition
was favorable to Sneferu but not to his successor Khufu (Cheops), the builder of
the Great Pyramid at Giza (see under “Kings and Princes” and “Magicians” in
“Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). Writing in the fifth century BCE, the Greek
historian Herodotus reported a legend that King Khufu had been cursed by the
gods for closing down their temples to divert resources to his pyramid.
Archaeological evidence suggests an element of truth to this tradition.
Local temples seem to have received little royal support during the Fourth and
Fifth Dynasties. The huge pyramid complexes of this era seem to concentrate
wholly on the divinity of the king, but this is partly an accident of preservation.
Reliefs and statues in the badly damaged pyramid temples did once show the
king interacting with many of the deities of Egypt. Pyramid complexes have
been interpreted as “resurrection machines” for the king and as models of the
Egyptian cosmos, making them a kind of mythology in solid form.18 The kings
of the Fifth Dynasty had smaller pyramids, but several of them built magnifi
cent temples for the sun god.
The favored elite who served Old Kingdom rulers were rewarded with beau
tifully decorated tombs in the royal cemeteries. Many of these tomb owners had
personal names that linked them with deities, such as Ptah-hotep (“the god
Ptah is satisfied”). The inscriptions in their tombs tell us that many of them
were part-time priests in the temples and shrines of deities, but at this period it
was not permissible to show even a statue of a deity in a private tomb. The pre
vailing reticence about religion in daily life makes it difficult to know much
about the gods at this period. A rich new source of evidence appeared in the
twenty-fourth century BCE, when hieroglyphic inscriptions were carved inside
the pyramid tomb of King Weni (Unas). These inscriptions, composed in the
language known as Old Egyptian, are now called the Pyramid Texts.
The Pyramid Texts
The Pyramid Texts are the oldest of the three principal collections of Egyptian
funerary literature.19 They are also among the earliest religious writings known
from anywhere in the world. The texts are divided into sections; each is preceded
by an Egyptian phrase meaning “words to be spoken” but sometimes translated
Introduction 9



as “spell” or “incantation.” These
incantations can be as short as a
single sentence or many para
graphs long. The pyramid of King
Weni contains around 300 incan
tations, but more than 800 are
currently known. Pyramid Texts
have been found in the pyramids
of five Old Kingdom kings and
three queens. No two pyramids
have exactly the same selection.
No illustrations accompany
the Pyramid Texts, though the
ceilings of royal burial chambers
were usually decorated with stars.
Many hieroglyphic signs consist
of images of living creatures.
In the writing of the Pyramid
Texts, potentially harmful crea
tures such as snakes, scorpions,
and some kinds of birds and
people are often shown dismem
bered or skewered with knives.
This suggests that there was a
strong fear of the latent power of
images during this period.
The texts themselves seem to
have been adapted from a variety
of genres, such as hymns, lists of
divine names and epithets, spells
from the type of magic used in
daily life, and the “recitations” that accompanied ritual actions. Many were
composed in the first person and would have been highly dramatic when spo
ken or chanted aloud. Some of the incantations may have been passed down
orally for many generations and only written down when the Pyramid Texts
were first assembled. The majority of the texts probably belong to the “secret
knowledge” written on leather or papyrus rolls, which is known to have been
kept in the libraries attached to some Old Kingdom palaces and temples. The
composing, copying, and reading out of these sacred books were the province of
a special class of priests, known as lector priests. No actual books of this kind

have survived from the Old Kingdom, and they are rare from later periods too.
No major temple library has ever been discovered intact, and this gap is one of
many in the sources for Egyptian myth.
The main purpose of assembling these texts and inscribing them inside
pyramids was to help the body of the deceased king to escape the horror of pu
trefaction and his spirit to ascend to the celestial realm where he would take
his place among the gods. Some of the texts were probably recited during the
king’s funeral or as part of the mortuary cult that continued after his death.
Others may have been intended to be spoken by the deceased king as he entered
the afterlife. In this type of incantation, the king took on the role of many dif
ferent deities.
Around 200 deities are mentioned in the Pyramid Texts. Some are the
major deities already known from cult temples, such the fertility god Min and
the creator goddess Neith. Others are entities such as snake deities and celes
tial ferrymen who inhabit a complex and intensely imagined realm of the
gods. The most frequently mentioned deities are Anubis, Atum, Geb, Horus,
Isis, Nephthys, Nut, Osiris, Ra, Seth, Shu, and Thoth (see “Deities, Themes,
and Concepts”). These include most of the deities who make up the Ennead of
Heliopolis, and it is often argued that the Pyramid Texts largely represent the
theology of the solar temple at Heliopolis. A stellar element was also impor
tant in the Pyramid Texts. The king was destined to join the “imperishable
stars,” and the god Osiris was identified with the constellation of Orion and
the goddess Isis with the Dog Star, Sirius.20 The cult of Osiris is hardly known
before the Fifth Dynasty, but he gradually became the most important funer
ary god.
One thing the Pyramid Texts are not is a collection of narrative myths.
They do contain numerous allusions to myths, many of which are difficult to
interpret. Some passages include what have been called “mythical statements.”
These give the bare outlines of an event that has taken place in the divine
realm, such as “Horus comes and Thoth appears. They raise up Osiris from
upon his side and make him stand erect in front of the two Enneads.”21
Many of the most important themes of Egyptian mythology, such as the
journey of the sun god in his solar barque, the murder of the good god Osiris,
and the violent conflict between Horus and Seth, are already present in the
Pyramid Texts. These texts are also the earliest source for the complex array of
myths and symbols that the Egyptians constructed on the theme of creation.
The gods as depicted in the Pyramid Texts often seem violent, hostile, and terri
fying beings, and this is a consistent picture in Egyptian funerary texts.
Near the end of the Sixth Dynasty, sections of the Pyramid Texts began to be
used in the tombs of important but nonroyal people in various parts of Egypt.
Introduction 11



This has been seen as one of the symptoms of a breakdown of royal authority
that led to the fall of the Old Kingdom.22 In the twenty-second century BCE, Egypt
entered a time of disunity, which historians call the First Intermediate Period.
There were still kings ruling from Memphis, but they did not control the
whole country. A rival dynasty emerged from a place called Herakleopolis. One
of these kings was traditionally credited with writing the remarkable work
known as the Teaching for King Merikare. This text mentions a brutal civil war
in which the king had been involved. Later Egyptian literature generally por
trayed the First Intermediate Period as a time of chaos and misery when the
gods had withdrawn their blessing.
Only one First Intermediate Period king had a pyramid inscribed with
Pyramid Texts, but they continued to be used in some private burials.23 A group
who benefited from the relaxation of royal authority was the nomarchs (provin
cial governors). These nomarchs had close ties with their local temples, and it
was probably among the priesthood of these temples that an innovative new
body of funerary texts began to develop. The independence of the nomarchs and
the period of disunity were brought to an end in the late twenty-first century
BCE by a king called Nebhepetra Montuhotep (Mentuhotep), who came from the
southern city of Thebes.
MIDDLE KINGDOM AND SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (DYNASTIES 11–17): C. 2055–1550 BCE
Once Nebhepetra Montuhotep was established as king of all Egypt, he ruled
from Memphis, but he built shrines for important gods all over the country. He
was eventually buried at western Thebes in a mortuary complex whose chief
feature seems to have been a representation of the Primeval Mound, the place
where creation began.
In the twentieth century BCE, kings of the Twelfth Dynasty built a new
royal residence called Itjtawy and were buried under pyramids at various desert
sites. None of these royal tombs was inscribed inside. Elaborate temples for the
royal mortuary cult were built near these pyramids, but none of them has sur
vived in good condition. Nor have many of the temples built for deities during
this period survived. One tantalizing text known as the Ramesseum Dramatic
Papyrus seems to be the script for a religious ritual in which the king took part
in the reenactment of mythical events, such as the coronation of the god Horus
(see Figure 3).24
More is known about the religious life of the government officials and their
families who formed the elite of Egyptian society. In their decorated tombs, no

marchs could be shown presiding over religious festivals and venerating sacred
objects. Other modes of religious activity and belief could be presented in en
coded ways.25 Short hymns to deities, of the type that might have been sung at
festivals, start to be written on tomb walls or funerary stelae. The coffins in
elite burials of this period were sometimes painted with texts and scenes that
formed part of the second of the major collections of funerary literature: the
Coffin Texts (CT).
The Coffin Texts
Coffin Texts is a modern name for the diverse body of spells or recitations used
on burial equipment during the Middle Kingdom. These texts were mainly
painted on wooden coffins, but they also appeared on tomb walls and on funer
ary items such as stelae and canopic chests. The Coffin Texts were composed in
Middle Egyptian, a form of the Egyptian language that became standard for lit
erary works. The texts were usually written in cursive (simplified) hieroglyphs,
but some examples are in hieratic, a script developed for administrative and lit

erary uses. Modern editors of the Coffin Texts have so far assembled 1,185 dif
ferent spells. Only a small selection of these was used in any one burial.
Many spells in the Coffin Texts are also known from versions in the
Pyramid Texts. Both collections may derive from an archive of mortuary texts
written on papyrus that does not survive. Some of the Coffin Texts spells are
given titles that define their function, such as Spell for Navigating in the Great

Barque of Ra, or include instructions for the rituals that should accompany
them. A few spells incorporate elaborate glosses to explain obscure passages.
These may reflect the way that religious knowledge was expounded among the
elite. Some spells are monologues spoken in the person of a deity, beginning
with phrases such as “I am the Inundation-deity who provides food”(CT 320);
others are dialogues between deities that amount to miniature religious dramas.
A few sections of the Coffin Texts have vignettes: illustrations that form an in
tegral part of the spell. The most elaborate of these are the maps that belong to
a section of the Coffin Texts known as the Book of Two Ways (see Figure 4). 26
These maps, which were usually painted on the floor of coffins, are the ear
liest known maps from any culture. The Book of Two Ways was nothing less
than an illustrated guidebook to the afterlife. It claimed to give two routes (by
water and by land) through a sinister divine realm beyond the horizon and to
provide the deceased with the spells they would need to get past the monstrous
guardians they would meet on the way. The deceased had to pass through the
mysterious region of Rosetau, where the body of Osiris lay surrounded by walls
of flame. If the deceased man or woman proved worthy, he or she might be
granted a new life in a paradise called the Field of Offerings. The Book of Two
Ways has been described by Erik Hornung as representing “the results of gov
ernment-funded research into the hereafter,”27 but research may be too aca
demic a word. The extraordinary visual detail in which the afterlife is presented
has a hallucinatory quality similar to that of the “spirit voyages” induced by
shamans in many cultures. 28
Although they are not narratives, some spells in the Coffin Texts describe
major events in the Egyptian creation story and even provide evidence for
Egyptian views about the end of the world (see “Return to Chaos” under
“Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). The creator god Atum-Ra and his
offspring Shu and Tefnut are particularly prominent. Many texts deal with
transformations of the sun god into various forms. A new element is a stress on
the dangers faced by the sun god during his celestial voyages, such as attacks by
the chaos monster Apophis. The prominence of the solar cult leads some
Egyptologists to believe that the Coffin Texts were, like the Pyramid Texts,
mainly generated by the priests of Heliopolis. Other Egyptologists point to the
huge range of deities that feature in this collection and see the Coffin Texts as
being more representative of regional traditions.29
Coffin Texts spells have been found in sites all over Egypt, but the majority
come from the geographical region known as Middle Egypt. The local deities of
Middle Egypt, such as Thoth and the group of primeval beings later known as
the Ogdoad of Hermopolis, feature in many of the spells. Thoth also appears in
many of the spells that allude to the conflict between Horus and Seth and the

rescue of the body of Osiris. By the time of the Coffin Texts, all the elite dead
could be identified with Osiris, the god who died and rose again.
Literature
The same learned class of priest-officials who composed or used the Coffin
Texts were also the writers and readers of Middle Kingdom literature. The
hymns that were sung to deities each dawn in temples and when statues of
deities left their sanctuaries during festivals can contain beautiful poetry.30
Such hymns were sometimes copied onto papyrus to be enjoyed as literature
or inscribed on stelae dedicated by pious individuals. Middle Kingdom hymns
mainly consist of sequences of divine epithets, but these can be helpful in
reconstructing the myths that may have been current about deities in this
period.
Popular in the Middle Kingdom were texts in which a father instructs his
son on the right way to behave in life. These are often known as Instruction or
Wisdom Texts. One of the topics Instruction Texts deal with is the proper rela
tionship between humanity and the gods, so they sometimes allude to mythical
events, such as the sun god’s decision to destroy rebellious humanity. Other lit
erary works that deal with ethical issues are in the form of prophecies or dia
logues between a man and a supernatural being.31
In a text comparable to the biblical Book of Job, a man named Ipuur
(Ipuwer) questions the Lord of All about why suffering and injustice are rife in
Egypt. The god’s replies are not very well preserved in the only surviving
manuscript, but the gist is that people must accept responsibility for their own
actions.32 Some Egyptologists assign the Dialogue of Ipuur to a genre of pes
simistic literature that describes Egypt as a society in chaos. It used to be
thought that these texts were written during the turbulent First Intermediate
Period or very shortly afterward, but they have now been redated to the high
Middle Kingdom or even to the Second Intermediate Period. The texts mytholo
gize the past in order to praise the present or predict the future. They see Egypt
as a battleground in a continuing cosmic struggle between order and chaos.
Literary narratives had developed by this period, though only a few have
survived. There was almost certainly a parallel tradition of oral storytelling.
Most Egyptian texts were intended for reading aloud, and stories could have
passed from an oral tradition into a written one and back again, as they have in
Arab storytelling in more recent times.33 In some Middle Kingdom stories, gods
feature as characters. If the definition of myth as “stories about gods” is ac
cepted, these narratives might count as myths, but they are really about people
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
16



who happen to encounter gods. Another common definition of myth is “stories
about the world of the gods,” but these Middle Kingdom tales are set in the hu
man world, sometimes in a specific historical period.
A series of linked stories set in the Third and Fourth Dynasties describes
marvels performed by the magicians of this era, such as transforming a wax
crocodile into a real one.34 In the framing story, five deities disguise themselves
as people to help a mortal woman who is about to give birth to triplets destined
to be kings. An incomplete story tells of an alarming encounter between a
herdsman and a seductive goddess.35 Another relates how an official sent on a
mission was shipwrecked on a mysterious island.36 There he encounters a giant
serpent who seems to be a form of the creator sun god.
One Middle Kingdom narrative that only features divine characters is a
fragmentary story about the attempted seduction of Horus by Seth, an event al
luded to in the Pyramid Texts. Some Egyptologists refuse to class this as a gen
uine myth because it may have formed part of a spell used in healing magic.37
Magic and Popular Religion
Heka, the Egyptian term usually translated as “magic,” was one of the forces
used by the creator to make the world. Humans were permitted to use magic in
daily life to protect themselves or to heal others. Knowledge of written magic
was confined to the literate elite, so it is not surprising that some spells have a
distinct literary quality. Healing spells often identify the doctor-magician with
a deity skilled in the use of heka, such as Isis or Thoth; the patient with a deity
who suffered in myth, such as Horus the Child (see “Deities, Themes, and
Concepts”); and the disease or problem with a hostile supernatural force.
These identifications were sometimes extended into a narrative of the mis
fortune that befell the deity and its ultimate resolution. A complex story about
the poisoning of the sun god, known as the True Name of Ra (see “Period of
Direct Rule by the Creator Sun God” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time
Lines”), is an example that may have been composed as early as the Middle
Kingdom. By creating these links, the doctor-magician hoped to mobilize cos
mic forces to act on behalf of the patient as they once had on behalf of the deity.
J. F. Borghouts, who has edited and translated many of the magical texts, com
mented that although some mythical themes that occur in spells are not known
from other sources, “There is, however, not a shred of proof that a specific kind
of ‘unorthodox’ mythology was especially coined à bout portant for this
genre.”38 Indeed, the efficacy of such spells may have partly depended on the pa
tients’ being familiar with the story of which they were being made a part.
Introduction 17



Similar links between human and divine events were created in visual form
on magical objects of the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Period.
Ivory wands that were used to protect newborn children and their mothers
show a wide array of divine beings, some in monstrous forms (see Figure 30).
Many of these have been identified with the deities of Middle Egypt who fea
ture in the Coffin Texts. Brief inscriptions on some of the wands state that
these deities have come to fight on behalf of a particular child. The wands seem
to be based on a myth of an endangered divine child hundreds of years before
such a myth is clearly delineated in narrative sources. Some of the creatures
shown on the wands, such as the griffin, feature in Egyptian animal fables
known from much later periods.
The wands suggest an almost lost world of oral traditions concerning the
gods. They were also among the first private objects to include depictions of
deities, although most of these are not in the formal style found in temples. The
late Middle Kingdom and the Second Intermediate Period were times of intel
lectual and religious change. At the height of the Twelfth Dynasty, the power
and influence of the provincial elites had been suppressed by the crown. This
seems to have been one of the factors that led to a decline in the use of the
Coffin Texts.
By the Thirteenth Dynasty royal authority was also in decline, and this
may have led to greater freedom of expression in religious art and literature.
Images of deities started to be shown on votive objects dedicated by nonroyal
people, particularly in the holy city of Abydos. Middle Kingdom inscriptions
tell of festivals at Abydos in which large numbers of people joined in cere
monies that reenacted key events in the myth of Osiris.39 It was around this
time that an ancient royal tomb at Abydos was reidentified as the burial place
of Osiris. This merging of mythical and physical geography was to become in
creasingly characteristic of Egyptian culture.
That culture seemed to suffer a setback when a Palestinian dynasty took
control of the Delta region of northern Egypt during the seventeenth century
BCE. These foreign rulers, known as the Hyksos, established a capital at Avaris,
a region where Seth was the leading deity. Seth was equated with the
Palestinian god Baal, and the worship of foreign goddesses such as Astarte and
Anat (see “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”) seems to have been introduced into
Egypt at this time.
Hyksos kings called themselves Sons of Ra, but one of them bore the name
of Ra’s archenemy Apophis.40 A legend tells how King Apophis picked a quarrel
with the Egyptian ruler of the Theban area by complaining that the roaring of
the hippopotami kept 500 miles away in Thebes was disturbing his sleep.41 This
New Kingdom story restates the political conflict in mythological terms by

making it into a fight between the Followers of Horus (the Thebans) and the
hippopotamus-worshipping Followers of Seth (the Hyksos). The Theban rulers
who made up the Seventeenth Dynasty gradually drove the Hyksos out of
Egypt. Under the Seventeenth Dynasty, a new collection of funerary texts de
veloped that was to become the famous Book of the Dead. The expulsion of the
Hyksos was completed by King Ahmose I (c.1550–1525 BCE). The Egyptians con
sidered him to be the first king of a new dynasty and a new era.
NEW KINGDOM (DYNASTIES 18–20) AND THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (DYNASTIES 21–24): C. 1550–747 BCE
Ahmose, and the other warrior kings of the early Eighteenth Dynasty, took
Egyptian armies as far as the Euphrates. They established an empire in Syria
and Palestine and took control of much of Nubia. In the late sixteenth century
BCE, the royal court moved back to Memphis, but Thebes became the religious
capital. Most New Kingdom rulers were buried there in underground tombs in
the desert wadi now known as the Valley of the Kings (see Figure 5). The offer
ing cults for the dead kings were carried out in separate mortuary temples some
way from their tombs. Amun, who had been the most important god in Thebes
since the Middle Kingdom, united with the sun god and became the King of the
Gods. The temple of Amun at Karnak in eastern Thebes developed into the
biggest and richest temple complex in Egypt.
The Eighteenth Dynasty is often considered the high point of Egyptian cul
ture. Much great art and architecture was produced during the reigns of Queen
Hatshepsut (c. 1473–1458 BCE); her nephew and stepson, King Thutmose
(Tuthmosis) III (c. 1479–1425 BCE); and the latter’s great-grandson, Amenhotep
(Amenophis) III (c. 1390–1352 BCE). Hatshepsut’s famous mortuary temple at
Deir el-Bahri in Thebes had many innovative features, such as an open court for
solar worship inscribed with a summary of the ruler’s secret knowledge about
the sun god. 42 Both Hatshepsut and Thutmose III built special shrines where or
dinary people could come to pray to deities such as the goddess Hathor in her
cow form or Amun “of the Hearing Ear.”43 Amenhotep III enlarged or founded
numerous temples, and many of the features introduced by his architects re
mained standard for c. 1,500 years. He commissioned huge numbers of divine
statues to stress his identification with all the deities of Egypt. Amenhotep III
sometimes gave himself the attributes of a lunar deity while his chief wife,
Queen Tiy, was identified with the goddesses who could play the role of the so
lar eye (see “Eye of Ra” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”).44
Introduction 19



Amenhotep III and Tiy were the parents of Amenhotep IV (c. 1352–1336
BCE), who early in his reign changed his name to Akhenaten. King Akhenaten
and his chief wife, Nefertiti, were dedicated to the cult of Aten, a form of the
sun god represented by the solar disk. Akhenaten built huge temples for Aten
that were open to the sky. He established a new capital and a new royal burial
ground at Akhetaten (modern Tell el-Amarna). Akhenaten suppressed the cult
of Amun, but the idea that he closed down all of Egypt’s temples seems to be an
exaggeration.45 In Akhenaten’s theology the worship of Aten as the creator sun
god and the king as his representative on earth made other deities and their
myths superfluous. Belief in a separate realm of the dead ruled by Osiris was re
placed by the idea that spirits of the dead could live on in the Aten temples.
Akhenaten’s religious and political policies were not popular, and under the
boy king Tutankhamun (Tutankhamon) (c. 1336–1327 BCE), Thebes was reestab
lished as the religious capital and Amun-Ra as the national god. Horemheb (c.
1323–1295 BCE), the last king of the Eighteenth Dynasty, presented Akhenaten’s
reign as a time of chaos in which the gods had abandoned Egypt. Horemheb was
succeeded by his vizier Rameses (Ramses, Ramesses), the founder of the
Nineteenth Dynasty. Rameses’ son, Seti (Sety) I (c. 1294–1279 BCE), was a vigor
ous king who reestablished Egyptian authority over parts of Syria, but the art of
his reign has a serene beauty. Seti’s son Rameses II ruled Egypt for sixty-seven

years and became a legend in the ancient world for his grandiose achievements.
His battles against the Hittite empire were celebrated in narratives, poetry, and
pictures on the walls of the numerous temples he constructed in Egypt and
Nubia. Rameses eventually made peace with the Hittites and married two
Hittite princesses. He constructed a new capital in the eastern Delta, but he did
not neglect Thebes. The 21-meter-high columns of the central hall at Karnak
built under Seti I and Rameses II give a sense of limitless power.
After Rameses’ long and prosperous reign, the international situation be
came more difficult for Egypt. His son Merenptah had to fight off invasions by
the Libyans and the mass migration known as the Sea Peoples. The same ene
mies in even greater numbers faced Rameses III (c. 1184–1153 BCE), the second
king of the Twentieth Dynasty. He defeated them by sea and land in battles that
are recorded on the walls of his fortresslike mortuary temple at Medinet Habu.
This whole temple is a monument to the triumph of order over chaos, but
Rameses III was the last great temple builder of the New Kingdom.
Temples and Kings
Throughout the New Kingdom much of the wealth generated by the empire and
by the exploitation of Egyptian and Nubian gold fields was spent on building
and endowing temples. All over the country the small, mainly mud-brick, tem
ples that had been common in earlier periods were replaced by large stone struc
tures whose walls were carved with hieroglyphic texts and scenes of kings with
deities. Major temples were like small towns, with their own granaries, slaugh
terhouses, workshops, offices, schools, libraries, and housing. Large numbers of
priests, some working full-time, were needed to run such temples.46
Like the pyramid complexes of the Old Kingdom, New Kingdom temples
were models of the Egyptian cosmos.47 The undulating mud-brick walls that
surrounded temples may have represented the primeval waters that were
thought to surround the inhabited world. Sacred lakes were used for reenact
ments of myths of the emergence of the creator from the primeval waters or for
the pacification of his fiery daughter, the Eye goddess. In the outer courtyard
the king was represented in reliefs or colossal statues as the champion of maat.
The battles that he was shown fighting were sometimes real and sometimes
imaginary, but the foreign enemies always represented the forces of chaos.48
The massive pylon gateways resemble defensive structures, but they also stood
for the mountains of the eastern horizon, between which the sun rose. The
plant-shaped columns of the inner halls formed a stone replica of the marsh
where gods were born or reborn. The innermost sanctuary that contained the
Introduction 21



cult statue was said to be built on the Primeval Mound, the very place in which
the creator first brought forth life.
Each temple was dedicated to one main deity, but in the New Kingdom it
became common to group deities into divine “families,” with subsidiary tem
ples for the chief deity’s consort and child. So at Karnak, for example, Amun
was worshipped as part of a triad, with Mut as his consort and Khonsu as his
son. Not all these groupings seem to have been based on existing myths, but
some of them eventually generated myths to explain features of their cult. The
relationships between deities could be expressed by moving divine statues be
tween temples during religious festivals. These processions, in which the god
was carried inside a boat-shaped shrine, gave ordinary people their only chance
to get close to the sacred images of their deities.
The names of some of the festivals listed in temple calendars suggest that
reenactments of myths were involved, but such reenactments were rarely de
picted. The majority of New Kingdom temple reliefs show a ritualized exchange
between the king representing humanity and a deity representing the divine
realm. The king makes offerings or performs rituals. The god responds with a
gesture or an object that symbolizes the bestowal of divine gifts, such as long

life or power. Among exceptions are scenes that form a narrative sequence
about the divine conception and birth of rulers such as Hatshepsut, Amenhotep
III, and Rameses II.49
It is typical of Egyptian pictorial narratives that some incidents or details
are only found in the text whereas others are shown only in the reliefs. The
text, for instance, describes a sensuous encounter between a queen and the god
Amun, who has taken the form of her husband in order to sleep with her. The
accompanying relief complies with the strict rules of Egyptian art and shows
the god, in his usual appearance, barely touching the queen’s hand (see
Figure 20). The queen gives birth to the future ruler surrounded by deities who
will nurse and protect the child and its spirit-double, the ka. This royal birth
scene may be based on mythical prototypes, but it predates all the known depic
tions of the birth of infant gods. Greek myth has equivalent stories of Zeus’s
disguising himself to seduce mortal women, but their focus is on very human
emotions of lust and jealousy. The seductions by Zeus are set in a mythical age
of heroes, and the god’s behavior may be criticized. In Egypt, such stories were a
solemn part of the myth of divine kingship and were told about living people.
Each Egyptian king was the “son” of the supreme creator god Amun-Ra but
also Horus, the avenger of his father, Osiris. Some New Kingdom rulers took a
renewed interest in the holy city of Abydos and the cult of Osiris. Ironically, the
finest temple at Abydos was built by Seti I, a king who was named after Seth,
the great enemy of Osiris.50 This temple of Seti I is so large and well preserved
that its scenes and inscriptions have been used to reconstruct the daily ritual
that went on in every Egyptian temple. This ritual was influenced by the con
cept of the daily rebirth of the sun god and by the myth of the death and resur
rection of Osiris.51
Some episodes from the Osiris myth are shown in the temple of Seti I, with
the king in the role of Horus. These include a very rare depiction of Isis in bird
form magically conceiving Horus by sexually arousing her murdered husband.
This was a moment of triumph and hope, but it was still not intended to be
seen by any but the highest grade of priests. The murder of Osiris was not
shown on the walls of Seti’s temple, but he was celebrated as a dead god in a re
markable building known as the Osireion (see Figure 6).52 This was built in the
style of an ancient royal tomb. A long passage leads down to an underground
hall where a sarcophagus once stood on an artificial island surrounded by water,
providing a symbolic tomb for the king. An adjoining chamber is inscribed with
the images and texts that form the Book of Nut, a major source for reconstruct
ing Egyptian cosmology.
A hymn inscribed on a New Kingdom private stela from Abydos provides
the most detailed account in Egyptian of the Osiris myth.53 After the usual lists
Introduction 23



of divine epithets, there is a section of narrative verse that begins with Osiris
“appearing on his father’s throne” and ends with Horus being acclaimed as his
rightful successor. If this were our only source for the myth, the story would be
very difficult to follow because the actual death of Osiris is not mentioned and
his enemy is only identified as “the disturber.” Rules still prevented explicit
images of those moments when maat was threatened by terrible events. There
was one place in which it did become permissible to show the forces that daily
threatened the divine balance, and that was in New Kingdom royal tombs. In
the great crisis of death, the king needed to identify with gods in crisis and
share in their triumph in overcoming the forces of destruction.
Underworld Books
Underworld Book is a general term for a type of mortuary text used in royal
tombs and cenotaphs of the New Kingdom. It is taken from an Egyptian term
for the genre to which these books belonged: “that which is in the underworld.”
The earliest of these books, the Book of the Hidden Chamber (now known as
the Amduat), may be derived from solar rituals performed by the king at
Heliopolis and other temples. The versions on the walls of the tomb of
Thutmose III and his successor Amenhotep II look as if they have been directly
copied from a papyrus scroll (e.g. Figure 45). This gives us an idea of what these
temple copies must have been like.
By the end of the New Kingdom about twelve different books were in use.54
They were painted on the walls or ceilings of the tomb or inscribed on impor
tant items of burial equipment such as shrines and shrouds. The books were
composed in Middle Egyptian, but the later ones show considerable influence
from Late Egyptian, a form of the language current in writing from the late
Eighteenth Dynasty onward. The texts are all written in hieroglyphs, but some
times in ways that make them difficult to read. These books contained very re
stricted knowledge, which was supposed to be known only to the king and
people who held high-ranking priestly offices.
The purpose of the Underworld Books was to maintain the cosmos and,
secondarily, to aid the king’s transition to the afterlife through his identification
with the sun god. Their common theme was the daily journey of the sun god,
Ra-Atum. Most concentrated on his perilous passage through the night sky,
which was equated with the underworld. The dangerous journey is probably the
world’s oldest narrative motif, but the Underworld Books are not presented as
stories. The structure of the books is provided by the passing of time55 or by the
geography of the underworld, which was imagined as divided into caverns or re
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
24



gions separated by guarded gates. Every Underworld Book presents a different
view of the topography of the afterlife, yet from the late Eighteenth Dynasty on,
royal tombs included more than one book in their decoration.56
The pictorial element is dominant in most of the Underworld Books. With
a few exceptions, the text is mainly in the form of captions to the images.
Underworld Books such as the Book of Gates and the Book of Caverns are es
sentially more detailed forms of the maps of the underworld found on Middle
Kingdom coffins. Each hour or gate or cavern is represented by giant tableaux of
hundreds of deities, demons, and monsters. Some Egyptologists have called
such groupings “image-clusters.” Individual symbols can modify their meaning
when incorporated into one of these clusters.
These secret books admit the vulnerabilty of the divine order and illustrate
the ordeals faced by the creator sun god. Virtually the entire cast of Egyptian
mythology is drawn in to crew the sun boat and defend the sun god from
Apophis and the other chaos monsters. Even more remarkably, the corpses of
Osiris and the rest of the dead can be shown waiting for their temporary revival
by the sun god in the sixth hour of the night. The Osireion at Abydos was prob
ably constructed as a setting for this mystical union between Ra and Osiris.
In two compositions that are often counted as Underworld Books, the Book
of the Heavenly Cow and the Litany of Ra, the genre develops in different direc
tions. The former is centered on a complex image of the sky goddess in cow form
(see Figure 26), but part of the text is a lively narrative about why Ra felt driven
to leave earth after crushing a rebellion among humanity (see “The Destruction
of Humanity” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). This story may
have originated in a dawn myth first recorded in the Pyramid Texts,57 but by the
New Kingdom it had changed into something more profound. Ra is credited with
human emotions of anger, bitterness, and pity, and the story answers the impor
tant question of why creation includes pain and death.
In contrast, the book known as the Litany of Ra conveys the utter mysteri
ousness of the creator sun god through heightened language and powerful visual
images. The sun god is evoked as the animating force behind the universe in
seventy-five nocturnal manifestations. These manifestations range from major
deities such as Horus and Isis to obscure entities such as the “Great Tom Cat”
and “He of the Cave,” yet part of the Egyptian title for this book was “adoring
the united one in the west.” The characteristic acts of independent beings that
are the mainspring of mythical narratives become almost irrelevant in such a
context.
New Kingdom hymns, such as those preserved in Papyrus Leiden I 350, ex
plore the idea that all deities are aspects of the creator. They speculate on the
miraculous process by which the one creator, usually named as Amun-Ra, was
Introduction 25



able to divide himself into many.58 The worship of the creator sun god as the
maintainer of the universe was widespread among the Egyptian elite. Solar
hymns celebrating the day and night voyages of Ra were inscribed at the en
trances to some New Kingdom private tombs or on statues of priests and offi
cials. By the end of the New Kingdom, a version of the Litany of Ra was ap
pended to the mortuary texts known as the Book of the Dead.
The Book of the Dead
The Egyptian Book of the Dead is a term coined in the nineteenth century CE
for a body of texts known to the Ancient Egyptians as the Spells for Going Forth
by Day. After the Book of the Dead was first translated by Egyptologists, it
gained a place in the popular imagination as the Bible of the Ancient Egyptians.
The comparison is very inappropriate. The Book of the Dead was not the central
holy book of Egyptian religion. It was just one of a series of manuals composed
to assist the spirits of the elite dead to achieve and maintain a full afterlife.
The collection was used for over a thousand years and eventually consisted
of more than 190 spells or “formulas.” Individual copies of the Book of the
Dead vary greatly in the number and selection of spells they include. The order
of the spells did not become fixed until around 650 BCE. In the New Kingdom,
spells from the Book of the Dead were occasionally inscribed on items of funer
ary equipment such as shrouds and coffins or on the walls of royal tombs and
mortuary temples. The majority of copies were on papyrus. These were in
cluded in the burials of wealthy priests, priestesses, and officials.
The spells in the Book of the Dead were most commonly written out in hi
eroglyphs or in a cursive (simplified) form of the hieroglyphic script. The major
ity of the spells are in Middle Egyptian. By the New Kingdom, the spoken lan
guage had changed considerably, so the number of people who could understand
texts in archaic Middle Egyptian would have been very restricted. This may be
one of the reasons why the vignettes to the Book of the Dead became increas
ingly important. By the end of the New Kingdom nearly every spell had its tra
ditional vignette. In some copies the illustrations alone are used to represent
the spells they should accompany. The vignettes can also occur as tomb decora
tion, since from the fourteenth century BCE onward it became acceptable to
show deities on the walls of private tombs.
Copies of the Book of the Dead have been found all over Egypt, but the
temples of Thebes seem to have been the main center of production. Many of
the spells were adapted from earlier funerary literature, particularly the Coffin
Texts. In Spell 17, quotations from the Coffin Texts are interspersed with com

26



mentaries headed “this means.” In these explanatory passages, ancient creation
myths are reinterpreted in terms of later theology. This is a clear example of the
way in which the meaning and functions of Egyptian myths could change from
period to period.
Many deities are mentioned or depicted in the Book of the Dead, but the af
terlife that the spells envisage is dominated by two gods, Ra and Osiris. Some of
the spells concerning Ra were adapted from solar hymns used in temples. The
spirits of the dead could join the “crew” of the sun boat or seek a place at the
court of Osiris, the ruler of the underworld. Most of the spells designed to help
nourish and protect the spirit on its journey to these destinations were based on
earlier prototypes, but there was a new emphasis on judging the past life of the
deceased.
This is seen most clearly in Spell 125, the formula for “descending to the
great hall of the Double Maat.” Before the throne of Osiris, the deceased had to
face a jury of gods and goddesses and declare himself or herself innocent of
forty-two specific sins. Most of the sins in this negative confession are offenses
Introduction 27

against deities, temples, or ritual purity, so Spell 125 may derive from an initia
tion ritual for priests.59 The vignette for Spell 125 supplements rather than il
lustrates the text. In one of the most famous of all Egyptian images, the heart of
the deceased person is shown being weighed against the feather that represents
Maat, the goddess of truth. If the heart were found to be heavy with sin, it
would be devoured by a monster.
In origin, this trial was just one of a series of perils that could be overcome
by magic, but the popularity of Spell 125 in the later New Kingdom coincided
with a new emphasis on god as a just but forgiving judge. In prayers of this pe
riod, people turn to gods such as Thoth and Amun to help them survive in an
unjust society. Other individuals humbly acknowledged that their sufferings
were a just punishment for actions such as breaking an oath sworn in a god’s
name.60 These “penitential texts,” like much of our knowledge of religion in
daily life, come from Deir el-Medina, the village of the artists who built and
decorated the Theban royal tombs. This exceptionally well preserved desert site
was also the place where most New Kingdom literature was found.61
Mythology in Literature
Only about ten Late Egyptian narratives survive from the New Kingdom. The
authors of these stories obviously assumed that their readers would have a de
tailed knowledge of Egyptian myth.
A story about a prince who is doomed by seven goddesses to be killed by a
snake, a crocodile, or a dog has been called the world’s oldest fairy tale. The
ending of the story is missing, but the prince was probably saved by the spirited
princess whose hand he wins in a jumping competition. The story known as
Truth and Lies has been interpreted as an allegorical version of the Osiris myth,
with the deities transformed into a dysfunctional human family.62 The plot in
volves a son who grows up to avenge his father, Truth, and defeat the enemy,
Lies. In contrast to Isis, the hero’s mother is presented as lustful and heartless.
The female characters also prove to be evil in the story of the Two Brothers.
The hero is falsely accused of attempting to rape his brother’s wife and then be
trayed by the woman given to him as a wife by the gods. Many mythological
themes appear in semidisguised form in this story.63 The two brothers have the
same names as two gods (Anubis and Bata) and exhibit some superhuman pow
ers. The story is set in a time when, just beyond the borders of Egypt, it was
still possible to encounter gods and monsters. The motif of the sea’s attempts to
seize a beautiful female occurs both in the Two Brothers and in another New
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
28



Kingdom tale about Seth’s fight with a god of the sea to save the goddess
Astarte. This seems to be a partially Egyptianized version of a foreign myth (see
“Astarte” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). Even more fragmentary tales
involve a woman who turns into a lioness and the god Heryshef’s recruitment
of a human to help him in his war with a divine falcon.64
The most controversial of the stories that date to the New Kingdom is the
Contendings of Horus and Seth. This is the longest narrative to survive about
the conflict between the two gods and its eventual resolution. That does not
mean that it should be taken as the most important or the standard version of
the myth. As many scholars have emphasized, a myth consists of all its ver
sions. This text is in narrative form because it appears to have been read aloud
for entertainment. It combines a retelling of the ancient myth with a satire on
the difficulties of obtaining justice in the New Kingdom legal system and per
haps with veiled comments on recent problems with the royal succession.65
Some Egyptologists believe that the comic treatment of many of the char
acters and events in the Contendings of Horus and Seth disqualifies it from be
ing a true myth, but a robust, often cruel, sense of humor is displayed in the
myths of many cultures. Some of the story’s more scandalous episodes, such as
Seth’s failed attempt to seduce his nephew Horus or Horus cutting off his
mother’s head in a tantrum, are also found in funerary and magical texts.
A devoted but dominating mother who gets her way through cunning and
magic, Isis is the first fully realized character in Egyptian myth. A New
Kingdom ostracon gives part of a story in which Isis and her attendant scorpi
ons take shelter with a fisherwoman (see “Serqet” in “Deities, Themes, and
Concepts”). This story was used hundreds of years later on magical statues and
stelae as part of a sequence of spells to drive out poison. Many of the myths
now known only from magical texts were probably adapted from other types of
source material or from oral tradition. Quite a number of spells survive on pa
pyri of the later New Kingdom. The Harris Magical Papyrus, now in the British
Museum, contains a sequence of anticrocodile spells that is full of allusions to
myths such as the rape of Isis.
Myths are often thought of as communal artifacts, but in Egyptian culture
they had many personal applications. Another example was the use of lists of
lucky and unlucky days, based on calendars of temple festivals. In the so-called
Cairo Calendar, each day of the year is associated with a particular deity or
mythical event.66 These associations were believed to affect what could be done
on a day, making the calendars rather similar to horoscopes. For example, the
twenty-ninth day of the second month of Peret (spring) was the day on which
the “children of Geb” had rebelled against the creator. “Do nothing on this
Introduction 29



day,” the calendar warns. Some entries summarize well-known mythical inci
dents, such as the reconciliation of Horus and Seth; in contrast, others allude to
very obscure myths, such as that of “the lost children of Bedesh.”
The End of the New Kingdom
By the eleventh century BCE, the kings, who lived in the eastern Delta, seem to
have had little influence over the south of the country. The last king of the
Twentieth Dynasty, Rameses XI (c. 1099–1069 BCE), had a tomb cut in the
Valley of the Kings but was probably never buried in it. In the Theban area,
power had fallen into the hands of one family whose members served as gener
als in the army and high priests in the temple of Karnak. Several members of
this family gave themselves royal titles, even after a new line of kings, the
Twenty-First Dynasty, took control in the north. A series of marriages between
the two families kept the peace.
Some of the most beautifully illustrated Books of the Dead were made for
royal and aristocratic women who served as priestesses in the temples of
Thebes during the eleventh and tenth centuries BCE (see, for example, Figure
24). It became the custom for elite burials to include a selection of spells from
the Book of the Dead and a papyrus based on one or more of the royal under
world books. During this period most of the royal mummies were moved from
their original resting places by the Theban priesthood, so the secret Underworld
Books on the walls of their tombs became available for copying.67
The papyri based on Underworld Books are often referred to as “mythologi
cal papyri.” They can consist almost entirely of drawings, with just a few brief
captions. Mythological episodes known from texts of the third millennium BCE
onward, such as the creator’s engendering life or the separation of the earth and
the sky, are illustrated for the first time on papyri and coffins of this period (see
for example, Figure 42). These extraordinary papyri illustrate the Egyptian ten
dency to think in images. Language is rarely adequate to express the numinous.
Instead the Egyptian priesthood devised a complex system of visual symbols to
convey difficult concepts without the use of words.
In the ninth century BCE the production of funerary papyri suddenly
stopped. This may have been the result of disruptions in temple life caused by a
civil war between the Thebans and a new dynasty of kings in the north. The
kings of the Twenty-Second Dynasty were of Libyan descent, but they seem to
have completely adopted Egyptian religion. They favored the cult of the feline
goddess Bastet and rebuilt part of her temple at Bubastis. Reliefs in the Festival
Hall of Osorkon II (c. 874–850 BCE) show all the deities of Egypt gathering at
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
30



Bubastis to honor the king’s jubilee. Bastet was one of the goddesses who could
take the role of the Eye of Ra, the fiery protector of the sun god and of every
king. The cycle of myths associated with the Eye goddess became increasingly
prominent during the first millennium BCE.
Most of the northern kings were buried in the city of Tanis, in tombs
within the temple of Amun-Ra. Some of these tombs have versions of New
Kingdom Underworld Books, such as the Book of the Day and the Book of the
Night, inscribed on their walls.68 The temples of Tanis were adorned with
Middle and New Kingdom statues brought from all over Egypt. This was proba
bly more than an economy measure. The reuse of old royal statues gave new
structures an instant past and invoked the protective presence of the royal an
cestors.
In spite of this tendency to look back on past glories, innovations did ap
pear among small objects. A wide range of amulets in the form of deities was in
troduced during the Third Intermediate Period. These were probably used to
protect the health and safety of the living as well as the bodies of the dead.
Some of the amulets depict mythological episodes such as those in which
Horus harpoons Seth or Isis nurses the baby Horus in the marshes.69 The choice
of such amulets suggests a widespread knowledge of the stories behind these
images. Until the Third Intermediate Period, scenes of nursing goddesses had
always shown a king playing the role of Horus. As Horus the Child ceased to be
so closely identified with the living king, he developed an important role in
mythology and popular religion.
By the eighth century BCE, Egypt was split up into a number of regions
ruled by petty kings and chieftains. The Theban area was under the control of a
line of royal high priestesses known as the Divine Adoratrices of Amun. In tem
ple rituals these priestesses acted the mythological role of the Hand of Atum,
the partner of the creator.70 Egypt’s divisions were eventually brought to an end
by invaders from the south.
LATE PERIOD AND PTOLEMAIC PERIOD (DYNASTIES 25–30 AND THE PTOLEMIES): 747–30 BCE
The first millennium BCE saw the rise and fall of a series of great empires. Egypt
suffered invasions and occupations by the Nubians, the Assyrians, the Persians,
and the Greeks; so for most of this period the country was either ruled by a for
eign power or fighting for its independence. Egypt’s culture was under pressure
from new ruling elites, yet many of the best sources for Egyptian myth date to
Introduction 31



this era. Indeed, some scholars do not recognize that Egypt had a developed
mythology before the Late Period. It is a common cultural phenomenon that af
ter a change of rulers, religion, or language, native people or scholarly incomers
become anxious to record a country’s traditions before they disappear. This of
ten involves codifying these beliefs and traditions for the first time.
Respect for ancient traditions was a policy of the Nubian kings who ruled
Egypt as the Twenty-Fifth Dynasty. These kings came from an area of Nubia
known as Kush. Their culture combined Nubian and Egyptian elements. The
chief religious site in Kush was the holy mountain of Gebel Barkal near ancient
Napata, where there was a temple for Amun-Ra and Hathor as the Eye of Ra.
King Piye (Piankh) and his brother King Shabaqo (Shabaka) were the first two
kings of this dynasty to rule Egypt. A victory inscription of King Piye
(c. 747–716 BCE) is full of references to Egyptian deities and myths. It records
that he seized the capital Memphis “like a desert storm, just as Amun-Ra had
commanded me.” 71 Some pyramid tombs of Nubian kings near Napata are in
scribed with extracts from Old Kingdom Pyramid Texts. In Thebes, priests ap
pointed by the Nubian kings revised and codified the Book of the Dead. Some of
the spells they added contain passages that are probably in the Nubian lan
guage.72 Also dating to this Nubian period is the Shabaqo Stone with a copy of
the text known as the Memphite Theology (see Figure 8).
The Memphite Theology
This text tells how the earth god Geb judged between the rival gods Horus and
Seth and how Osiris was established as ruler of the underworld. It reconciles
the separate creation myths of Atum of Heliopolis and Ptah of Memphis and in
cludes a first-person account by Ptah of how he created all life through his pow
ers of thought and speech. This section has often been compared to the famous
opening of St. John’s gospel: “In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was
with God and the Word was God.” The whole text may have been read aloud
during religious festivals.
King Shabaqo (c. 716–702 BCE) claims to have had the Memphite Theology
copied onto stone because the original was “eaten by worms.” The new version,
which was set up in the temple of Ptah in Memphis, was to prove equally un
lucky. The slab on which it was inscribed was eventually reused as a millstone,
so parts of the text have been ground away. The preface to the Memphite
Theology states that Shabaqo thought this text worthy of preservation because it
was found “to be a work of the ancestors.” In the past, Egyptologists accepted
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
32



Shabaqo’s word that this was a
very ancient text and assigned
it to the Old Kingdom or even
the Early Dynastic Period.
Recent work has shown that
the Memphite Theology cannot
be earlier than the late New
Kingdom. It was probably re
written under Shabaqo using a
deliberately archaic style to
give the contents added author
ity.73
Much of the Memphite
Theology is similar to accounts
of creation in the so-called
Bremner-Rhind Papyrus, which
dates to around the fourth century BCE (see “BRP” in “Appendix: Primary
Sources”).74 Among the texts inscribed on this papyrus are rituals designed to at
tack the enemies of the king, the state, and the cosmos and render them harm
less. The Book of Knowing the Transformations of the Sun and of Overthrowing
Apophis gives instructions on making models and drawings of enemies and de
stroying them by methods such as stabbing, trampling, burning, and burying.
These sections are prefaced by speeches from the creator god describing the cre
ation of life and the establishment of the divine order. This identifies the ritual
as part of the continuing cosmic struggle. Until recently, the Bremner-Rhind
Papyrus cosmogony has received much less attention from scholars than the
Memphite Theology, partly because the former conforms to modern ideas of
what a religious text should be like, whereas the latter was seen as belonging to
the primitive world of magic. Of the two, it is probably the Bremner-Rhind
Papyrus that is more characteristic of the way in which mythology was used in
Egyptian culture.
In the seventh century BCE, most Egyptians must have felt that the forces of
chaos had triumphed when their country endured a series of brutal invasions by
the Assyrians. Unlike most invaders, the Assyrians showed little respect for
Egypt’s gods. They looted the temples of Heliopolis and Thebes, taking away
vast quantities of treasure. The Nubian kings were driven out of Egypt, but they
continued to reign over Kush for almost a thousand years.
The Assyrians did not have enough manpower to leave a large army in
Egypt. They appointed Egyptians to govern the country on their behalf and col

lect tribute. A family from the region of Sais in the Delta collaborated with the
Assyrians for awhile. As soon as the Assyrians were occupied with problems
elsewhere in their empire, this family made Egypt independent again and ruled
as the Twenty-Sixth Dynasty. Under these kings, Greek merchants were al
lowed to trade and settle in the Delta.
The cult center of the goddess Neith at Sais became one of the most impor
tant temples in Egypt. According to a later tradition, the secret of how the soul
can unite with God was inscribed in hieroglyphs in the sanctuary at Sais.75 At
this time a script known as Demotic was introduced to write texts in the contem
porary form of the Egyptian language. It soon replaced hieratic for most purposes.
Persians and Greeks
In 525 BCE the Persian king, Cambyses, conquered Egypt and executed most of
the Egyptian royal family. It is probably only a legend that Cambyses showed
his contempt for Egyptian gods by stabbing the sacred Apis bull (see “Deities,
Themes, and Concepts”). The Persians did not try to impose their own religion
on Egypt, and they were willing to honor Egyptian deities. The innovative re
liefs in the temple of Hibis in the western desert were mainly carved under
Darius I, one of the Persian kings who made up the Twenty-Seventh Dynasty
(see Figure 33). The reliefs include some very unusual forms of deities. These
forms and the epithets used in the captions, such as Atum “scarab who ap
peared at the First Time,” help to define the deities’ mythological roles.76
It was during the first period of Persian rule that the Greek historian
Herodotus of Helicarnassus (c. 484–420 BCE) seems to have visited Egypt. Book
Two of his Historia is a description of the geography, history, customs, and
marvels of Egypt. Some Classicists and Egyptologists think that Herodotus
made up his account from travelers’ tales, but others believe him to be a reli
able eyewitness and take everything that he writes very seriously.77 Herodotus
claims to have talked with Egyptian priests in several important religious cen
ters, but his information mainly seems to derive from Memphis and the east
ern Delta. He argued that the priests’ knowledge was important to humanity
because, unlike the Greeks, the Egyptians had access to very ancient and con
tinuous records.
Herodotus thought it possible to identify many Egyptian deities with Greek
ones, so he calls Osiris, Dionysus, and Horus, Apollo. It became a general prac
tice among Classical writers to use Greek names for Egyptian deities, but these
cross-cultural identifications are not always consistent. Herodotus says more
about religious architecture and rituals than about mythology. “As for the sto

34



ries told by the Egyptians,” he wrote, “let whoever finds them credible use
them.”78 He does not relate the full Osiris myth because he saw it as compara
ble to the Greek Mystery cults, which devotees had to vow to keep secret.
Herodotus does outline some brief myths to explain curious features of
buildings or statues, such as why the temple grounds at Buto contained a float
ing island or why Amun could be shown with a ram’s head. These are not unlike
the kinds of tales told to gullible tourists by unofficial Egyptian guides at the
monuments today. The bizarre legends Herodotus relates about some Egyptian
kings, such as a tale of King Mycerinus (Menkara) raping his own daughter and
burying her inside a cow, may have reflected contemporary folktales. The
Egyptians had a long tradition of telling unflattering stories about past kings.
Between 404 and 343 BCE, several dynasties of Egyptian-born kings were
able to keep the Persians out of Egypt. The three kings of the Thirtieth Dynasty
instituted a style of art and architecture that was to continue under their for
eign successors. A Thirtieth Dynasty mythological text about the reigns of Shu
and Geb defines a ruler’s duties as defending Egypt from foreign enemies, main
taining the country’s defensive walls and irrigation systems, and rebuilding the
temples of the gods.79 A huge granite temple was begun at Behbeit el-Hagar for
the goddess Isis, whose cult was becoming increasingly important. Later legend
claimed that it was the failure of King Nectanebo II (360–343 BCE) to complete a
temple for the god Onuris-Shu that led to his defeat when the Persians invaded
again.80 This time the Persians seem to have punished the Egyptians by destroy
ing some important temples.
The second period of Persian rule was brief because the Persian empire was
soon under attack from the Greeks, led by the young king of Macedonia,
Alexander the Great. Alexander “liberated” Egypt in 332 BCE and was crowned
king in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. During his stay in Egypt, he declared
himself a living god and founded the city of Alexandria on the Mediterranean
coast. After Alexander’s death, one of his generals, a Macedonian called
Ptolemy, made himself ruler and then king of Egypt. The Ptolemy family were
to rule Egypt for around 300 years.
Alexandria and Memphis
Under the Ptolemies, the country was governed from Alexandria, and nearly all
the important posts in the government went to Greek settlers rather than to
Egyptians. In the third century BCE, King Ptolemy II (285–246 BCE) founded a
great library. The contents of the famous Library of Alexandria have been lost,
owing to fires, earthquakes, and tidal waves, but its 700,000 book-scrolls proba

bly contained little about Egyptian mythology. Greek philosophy, science, and
literature were the main interests of the scholars at the Mouseion, a kind of
protouniversity attached to the library.
Most members of the Ptolemy family never learned the Egyptian language,
but they were conscious that they were ruling a multicultural society and that
they needed the support of influential Egyptians. As a symbol of cultural fusion,
the Ptolemies established the cult of a new god, Serapis, who combined features
of the Egyptian deities Apis and Osiris with aspects of Greek deities such as
Zeus and Dionysus. Many of the Ptolemies were crowned in the temple of Ptah
at Memphis, and they often contributed to the cost of religious ceremonies in
the ancient capital.
Ptolemaic kings and queens were happy to identify themselves with
Egyptian deities and to rule in their names. They encouraged the Egyptians to
worship them as divine rulers. The Memphis decree of King Ptolemy V
(205–180 BCE) ordered the setting up of Egyptian-style statues of “Ptolemy who
has preserved Egypt” in every temple. In the decree, Ptolemy refers to slaugh
tering rebels just as Ra and Horus, son of Osiris, had slaughtered those who re
belled against them “in the First Time.” The Memphis decree is best known
from the copies in Greek and two forms of Egyptian on the Rosetta Stone (see
Figure 10).81
Among the cults supported by the Ptolemies was that of the Apis bull, who
lived in a special enclosure at the temple of Ptah. When an Apis bull died, it
was mummified and given a funeral as elaborate and expensive as that of a king.
A papyrus of the first century BCE summarizes the rituals to be performed, in
cluding mythological dramas. The conflict between Horus and Seth and the vic
tory of Ra over Apophis were acted out on boats on the lake of the temple of
Ptah. This is typical of the way in which Egyptian rituals lifted events out of or
dinary time and made them part of the whole sequence of mythological history.
Two young women, preferably twin sisters, played the roles of Isis and
Nephthys to mourn the Apis bull as if he had been Osiris himself. Versions of
the types of laments that they sang have survived in the Bremner-Rhind
Papyrus and other sources.82 The laments are notable for their emotional inten
sity. Osiris is mourned not just as a king but as a beloved husband and brother.
Anthropologist Claude Lévi-Strauss has pointed out that although poetry is no
toriously difficult to translate from one language to another, myths often pass
easily between languages and cultures because their content is far more impor
tant than the way in which they are told.83 Greeks and other immigrants found
the joys and sorrows of Isis to have meaning for their lives. Isis and Osiris came
to be the most famous Egyptian deities among foreigners, but the native
Egyptians continued to worship a multiplicity of deities.

Priests and Temples under the Ptolemies
The Ptolemies undertook massive temple rebuilding programs to legitimize
their rule in the eyes of the Egyptians and their gods.84 Native Egyptian soci
ety was more temple centered than ever, and the priesthood became the cus
todians of Egyptian culture. Working for a temple was virtually the only form
of advancement available to talented Egyptians. The priesthood turned into a
hereditary caste, jealous of its rights and privileges. Yet this was not a period
of decadence. Egyptian art, literature, and theology continued to flourish and
develop.
The architecture of the Ptolemaic temples reflects their use by the general
population. Inside the enclosure walls there were sanatoria where people could
visit statues with healing powers or spend the night in the hope that a deity
would come to them in a dream and tell them how their illness could be cured.
Crowds took part in the annual festival of Osiris and left miniature mummy
figures of Osiris in special shrines. Many temples kept large numbers of the
type of animal that was sacred to the main deity of the temple. People could
pay for these animals to be ritually sacrificed and then mummified to act as
messengers to the realm of the gods. Wealthier temple visitors continued the
Late Period practice of dedicating beautifully made bronze images of deities
(see, for example, Figure 13). An area of the temple that may have been a par
ticular focus for women was the mammisi (Birth House). These structures
were decorated with texts and scenes describing the conception and birth of a
deity, most usually a form of Horus.85
By the Ptolemaic Period, religious texts, such as detailed festival calendars,
cycles of hymns, and the scripts for rituals, were commonly inscribed on tem
ple walls. This was thought to allow the temple to function even if there was
nobody to perform the rites. Some of the most interesting texts are found in the
extraordinarily well preserved temple of Horus at Edfu, which was built be
tween 237 and 57 BCE. Scenes and inscriptions on the walls have allowed schol
ars to reconstruct annual ceremonies such as the Festival of the Beautiful
Union, which celebrated the coming together of Horus and Hathor. The Festival
of Victory commemorated the triumph of Horus over Seth and his followers
(see Figures 31 and 32). This conflict seems to have been acted out on and
around the temple lake.86 A second mythological drama, the Legend of the
Winged Disk, has Horus defending Ra against his enemies, a role usually taken
by the Eye goddess. The foundation of the temple is traced back to the First
Time in a series of texts sometimes known as the Edfu Cosmogony.87
Every major Ptolemaic temple seems to have had its own creation myth,
with the principal deity of the temple playing the role of creator. Texts of this
Introduction 37



type, such as the Khonsu Cosmogony at Karnak,88 use wordplay to incorporate
the myths of other creator deities and show them as aspects of the same phe
nomenon. At some temples members of the priesthood used their knowledge of
history and legend to devise stories to support their claims to land and privi
leges. The Famine Stela on Sehel island in the First Cataract and the Khonsu
Stela at Thebes are examples of Ptolemaic charter myths in which deities inter
act with historical figures (see “Khnum” and “Khonsu” in “Deities, Themes,
and Concepts”).
Among the inscriptions found on the walls of Ptolemaic temples are
lengthy lists of all the sacred places in the forty-two nomes (districts) of Egypt.
The richness of this mythical geography is brought out by Papyrus Jumilhac, an
illustrated selection of the myths and legends of the Jackal nome, the seven
teenth district of Upper Egypt.89 There were probably similar collections for
other regions. Most of the brief narratives are about the conflict between Horus
and Seth, with a particular emphasis on the struggle to protect the body of
Osiris (see Figure 21). Episodes from this cycle become etiological myths to ex
plain topographical features, or elements of ritual, such as why Egyptian priests
wear leopard skins. These are national gods localized, rather than local gods
universalized.
Papyrus Jumilhac was not just an antiquarian collection, as its texts seem
to have been recited during religious festivals. The first Egyptian to write about
Egyptian religion purely as a scholarly exercise may have been a priest called
Manetho who lived in the late fourth and early third centuries BCE. Manetho
was one of the educated elite who could understand the hieroglyphic script and
earlier forms of the Egyptian language, but he also learned Greek. His ambition
was to explain and justify Egyptian culture to outsiders, particularly the Greeks.
He is famous for writing a history of Egypt that only survives in excerpts in
later Classical writers.90 Manetho was credited with at least seven other works,
including books on Egyptian festivals, rituals, and “ancient religion.” Sadly, no
manuscripts of these books have yet been found.
In general, less literature has survived from the first millennium BCE than
from the Middle and New Kingdoms. One virtually complete Late Period story
written in hieratic is antiestablishment in tone and features a cowardly and
lustful king and greedy and heartless priests. The hero, Meryra, enters the un
derworld in his king’s place and is helped by a goddess to avenge himself on
those who have betrayed him.91 There are fragments of mythological tales in
Demotic, including at least one about the crowning of Horus and Seth.92 Some
interesting mythological narratives survive from the Late and Ptolemaic
Periods inscribed in hieroglyphs on special types of statues and stelae used in
healing magic.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
38



Isis and Horus
Magical statues and stelae usually feature a carved figure of Horus in child form
overcoming dangerous animals (see, for example, Figure 16). Such stelae are
known as cippi or “Horus on the crocodiles stelae.” The most famous object of
this type is the Metternich Stela, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,
New York.93 This is inscribed with a collection of spells for driving away dan
gerous animals and reptiles or curing their poisonous bites and stings. These
creatures were both hazards of daily life and symbols of the chaos that con
stantly threatened the divine order. Surrounding the central figure of Horus on
most cippi is a grotesque array of deities in their most terrifying and powerful
forms. These images complement the text of the spells but do not illustrate
them.94 The power of the words and images could be absorbed by drinking or
bathing in water poured over the stela.
Most of the spells center on a briefly stated mythical event, such as Ra
Atum transforming himself into a mongoose to kill Apophis. A few are fleshed
out into narratives with lively dialogue. In the longest of these dramatized
spells, Isis is imprisoned by Seth but escapes to the marshes of Chemmis, where
she gives birth to Horus. Isis is depicted as oppressed by powerful males, strug
gling with poverty, and in constant fear of losing her child. This was probably
the lot of most ordinary women in Ancient Egypt. The cippi texts raise the
question that must be answered by every religion: If god is good, why do inno
cent children suffer? An angry attitude toward divine indifference is put in the
mouth of Isis. Her challenge to the sun god to help her dying child is one of the
most powerful emotional passages in all of Egyptian literature. Ra responds by
sending Thoth to cure Horus. Isis as everywoman has triumphed, and the spell
promises that every child will be saved because Horus was saved.
Cippi have been found in houses and tombs, but large examples such as the
Metternich Stela would originally have been set up in an outer area of a temple.
Ptolemaic Period temples are decorated with endless scenes of gods and
pharaohs, but the absence of specific royal names from some cartouches gives a
clue that it was often difficult for the priests to know who was in charge of the
country or for how long. From the second century BCE onward there were fre
quent wars between rival members of the Ptolemy family as well as rebellions
by native Egyptians. In the first century BCE, one of the feuding Ptolemies un
wisely sought help from Rome, the city that was becoming the greatest military
power in the ancient world. The Romans were eager for an excuse to get hold of
the gold and the grain that Egypt produced.
The Greek writer Diodorus Siculus (of Sicily) visited northern Egypt in the
mid first century BCE. In his description of the country he picked out elements
Introduction 39



of Egyptian religion that he found bizarre, such as the reverential treatment of
sacred animals. Diodorus summarized the myth of Osiris, including his murder
by his brother, Typhon (Seth). He explained the symbolic tombs of Osiris found
in temples all over Egypt by a myth in which Isis deceives the priests in each
temple into thinking that they have the true body of the god. This literal
minded interpretation points up the differences between Greek and Egyptian
thought.
Soon after Diodorus’s visit, Rome was interfering in Egyptian affairs. The
Roman general Julius Caesar took part in a civil war and secured the position of
the last great member of the Ptolemy family, Queen Cleopatra VII (51–30 BCE).
After Julius Caesar returned to Rome, Cleopatra gave birth to a son, Ptolemy
Caesarion. Cleopatra used Egyptian myth to political advantage by identifying
herself with the goddess Isis and her fatherless son with Horus the child. A few
years later Cleopatra joined forces with another Roman general, Mark Antony,
to try to establish a new empire of the east. Mark Antony’s patron deity was
Dionysus, the Greek god generally identified with Osiris. In 30 BCE Antony and
Cleopatra were defeated by Octavian, who subsequently became the first em
peror of Rome under the title of Augustus. Egypt was reduced to being a
province of the Roman empire.
ROMAN PERIOD: 30 BCE–395 CE
For a time, Roman rule had relatively little impact on the religious life of the
country. Roman emperors replaced Ptolemaic kings on the temple walls.
Strabo, a geographer who visited Egypt in the early Roman Period, stressed the
country’s past glories but was able to describe flourishing cult temples.95 Under
Augustus, and later under Trajan (98–117 CE) and Hadrian (117–138 CE), new
temples were built for Egyptian and Nubian deities. The language of temple in
scriptions was still neo–Middle Egyptian, written in a form of the hieroglyphic
script that was increasingly difficult to read.96
The long tradition of speculation about the First Time continued. The tem
ple of Khnum at Esna, which largely dates to the first century CE, is inscribed
with hymns detailing the roles of Khnum and the goddess Neith as creator
deities. Chaeremon, an Alexandrian who became one of Emperor Nero’s tutors,
described the Egyptian priests of his day as pious philosophers who were the
custodians of an esoteric knowledge sought by people of many races.97 One of
the seekers who made good use of such knowledge was the Greek writer and
thinker Plutarch (c. 46–126 CE).

Plutarch’s Osiris
Plutarch is best remembered as
a historian whose biographies
of leaders such as Coriolanus
and Mark Antony formed the
main source for several of
Shakespeare’s plays. Plutarch
was fascinated by Egyptian re
ligion and wrote a book on this
topic called “Concerning Isis
and Osiris.” He could not
speak or read any form of the
Egyptian language, so he had to
rely on conversations through
interpreters and speculations
about Egyptian deities found in
the works of earlier Classical
writers. Plutarch’s narrative of
the life and death of Osiris and
the wanderings of his widow,
Isis, is the one commonly used
in popular books on Egyptian
mythology.
Plutarch had few reserva
tions about describing in detail
the murder of Osiris and the
mutilation of the god’s body.
Much of Plutarch’s Osiris nar
rative must have been based on stories and customs that were current in Egypt
during the first century CE, but this does not make it a reliable source for earlier
periods. The myth of Osiris had been developing and changing for over 2,500
years before Plutarch was born, but Plutarch’s written sources could only take
him back about 600 years. Plutarch himself gave alternate versions of parts of
the story, some of which he thought might be more authentic than others.
His stated purpose in writing the book was to seek the universal truths that
he believed to lie behind the myths and beliefs of all cultures. He quotes other
writers’ far-fetched allegorical interpretations of Egyptian myth. His own com
ments on the nature of myth often sound surprisingly modern. He did not be

Dendara, built during the Roman Period. (Courtesy of

lieve that myths described events that had actually happened. He is scathing
about people who interpreted all myths in terms of natural phenomena such as
crop cycles or eclipses: “One should take the greatest heed and care not uncon
sciously to reduce and resolve the divine to terms of winds, fluxes, sowings,
ploughings, terrestrial occurrences and seasonal changes, like those who ex
plain Dionysus as wine and Hephaestus as flame.”98
Plutarch saw the mythology of Isis in particular as a profound expression of
the benevolent face of the divine. It is to his credit as a scholar that he related
some incidents, such as one in which Isis strikes a child dead with her glance,
that do not easily fit with this view. Roman Period hymns in Greek and
Egyptian speak of all gods and goddesses as merely forms of the great creator
Isis. One of the things that made the cults of Osiris and Isis popular with for
eigners was the promise of a happy afterlife for all the virtuous dead, whatever
their status had been in life. This was not a concept that was very common
among ancient religions.
Vignettes of the judgment of the dead feature prominently in the Book of
Breathing, a condensed version of the Book of the Dead placed in burials during
the Ptolemaic and Roman periods. A new text known as the Book of Traversing
Eternity was sometimes combined with the Book of Breathing. This contained
spells to allow the spirit of a dead person to return to earth to visit temples and
take part in the festivals of Osiris99 The scholar-priests who compiled these
books were presumably drawing on ancient texts preserved in temple li
braries,100 but there is evidence that such priests were also open to influences
from outside Egyptian culture.
Demotic Literature
Under the Roman administration, Greek remained the chief language of intel
lectual and literary life. Huge numbers of Roman Period papyri have survived,
particularly from the Fayum region and the town of Oxyrhynchus. Among
these are literary papyri in Greek and Demotic from temple libraries or priests’
houses. Much of this literature may originally have been composed in the
Ptolemaic Period. Some of the Demotic literature shows foreign influence. A
fragmentary tale of a war between an Egyptian prince and an Amazon queen has
been compared with Greek myths such as the combat of Achilles and
Penthesilia or the conquest of the Amazon queen Hippolyta by Theseus. The
Demotic version is told from the point of view of the “queen of the land of
women.” She appeals to Isis to help her against the Egyptian prince, who is
compared with the chaos monster Apophis.101
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
42



The war between order and chaos is the underlying theme of the myth of
the Eye of the Sun, also known as the myth of the Distant Goddess (see “The
Distant Goddess” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). The outline
of this myth can be pieced together from rituals inscribed on the walls of
Ptolemaic and early Roman Period temples. A literary version in Demotic is the
longest mythical narrative in Egyptian to survive from any period.102 The Eye of
the Sun text seems to have been put together from many different sources and
was probably read aloud to entertain people. It includes passages of virtuoso
descriptive writing, elaborate praises of Egyptian culture that would have gone
down well with a native audience, and animal fables. These short moral tales
are told by the god Thoth as part of his plan to lure the angry goddess back to
Egypt to resume her place in the divine order as the sun god’s chief defender.
Thoth’s story of a lion helped by a mouse has the same plot as a shorter fable at
tributed to Aesop, a Greek slave thought to have lived in the sixth century
BCE.103 Incidents from other fables in the Eye of the Sun have been recognized in
drawings dating to the late second millennium BCE, so Egypt seems to have had
a tradition of animal fables centuries before Aesop.
Another genre with a long history in Egypt was stories about magicians.
These were usually set in the past, like the Middle Kingdom sequence of stories
about Old Kingdom magicians in Papyrus Westcar. One badly preserved
Demotic story cycle tells how the Third Dynasty official Imhotep used magic to
help the armies of Egypt.104 Very similar stories are told about Nectanebo II in
the Greek “Alexander Romance” of the second century CE, which is probably
based on a lost Egyptian original. Another story cycle was centered on a prince
called Setna, a character based on an actual son of Rameses II, Prince
Khaemwaset. Part of one of these stories is known from the fourth century BCE,
but the most complete versions come from the early Roman Period (see
“Appendix: Primary Sources”). The proper uses of magic and other types of se
cret knowledge form one of the main themes of these stories.
Land of Magicians
By the Roman Period, Egypt was renowned as a land of priest-magicians. The
ancient city of Memphis was thought to be the place where they learned their
secret craft. In the first of the stories about Setna, the prince steals the magical
Book of Thoth from an ancient tomb near Memphis. He ignores the warnings of
the ghosts who inhabit the tomb and is punished by horrible hallucinations un
til he gives back the forbidden book. Several manuscripts ranging in date from
the first century BCE to the second century CE preserve parts of an actual Book
Introduction 43



of Thoth.105 This begins with a dialogue between a person seeking divine wis
dom and Thoth, the god of wisdom and secret knowledge. The seeker hopes to
gain some of the very powers mentioned in Setna’s magic book, such as under
standing the speech of birds and animals and seeing Ra in his sun boat. The
Setna story seems to be a warning against trying to use such knowledge to gain
earthly power rather than spiritual enlightenment.
In the second story in the cycle, Setna is allowed to pay a brief visit to the
underworld to see Osiris judging the dead. Such a spirit voyage also forms part
of the Book of Thoth, where it acts as a kind of initiation rite.106 In the Demotic
story, the scenario of the traditional underworld books is fictionalized into a
personal journey. Some of the horrors Setna sees, such as souls tormented by
tasks they can never complete, seem to be based on Greek visions of the after
life. In the third story, Setna’s son Sa-Osiris (“son of Osiris”) turns out to be a
reincarnation of a great magician of the past, a concept that may be more Greek
than Egyptian. A battle against malevolent Nubian sorcerers reflects contempo
rary fears of the powerful Nubian kingdom to the south, which the Romans
never succeeded in conquering.
A number of magical papyri of the Roman Period have survived, mainly
from Thebes. Most of their spells are in Greek, but four papyri of the third cen
tury CE contain elaborate spells in Demotic.107 The Demotic spells often utilize
Egyptian deities in their traditional mythical roles for dubious purposes. So, for
example, the myth of the rape of the goddess Tefnut is invoked in a spell to sep
arate a woman from her husband. The spells in Greek are populated by figures
borrowed from Egyptian, Greek, and Roman myth and Aramaic and Jewish reli
gion. Egypt was a cosmopolitan country, and the Roman Period was an age of
religious synthesis. This is also apparent in the Greek texts known as the
Hermetica.108
Like the Book of Thoth, Hermetic texts were usually in the form of a dia
logue between a disciple and a deity or a revered sage. The deity is most com
monly Hermes, the Greek god identified with Thoth. Some Hermetica feature
Isis or Asclepius, the Greek god of medicine identified with the deified Egyptian
sage, Imhotep. The instructing deity sometimes relates myths about the begin
ning or the end of the world. Many spells in the magical papyri claim the power
to summon visions of deities. In the Hermetica, such visions can lead to a truer
understanding of the meaning of life and the nature of the divine.
The Hermetica were principally a development of Greek philosophy. It
used to be argued that the Hermetica were written and read only by Greeks un
til some Hermetic texts in Coptic were found. Coptic was a form of the
Egyptian language used from the second century CE onward. It was written in
the Greek alphabet with the addition of six signs borrowed from the Demotic
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
44



script. Most scholars now agree that the traditional wisdom of the Egyptian
priests and their knowledge of Egyptian myth were among the elements that
made up the Hermetica.
Some of the Hermetica have much in common with the teachings of
Gnosticism, which promised salvation through gnosis (knowledge) of the self.
Gnostics rejected the material world as evil, a point of view that was alien to
traditional Egyptian thought, which had always celebrated the created world
as part of the divine order. Manicheism, a religious movement that originated
in Iran, was more sympathetic. Its emphasis on a perpetual struggle between
the forces of darkness and light could be seen by Egyptians as a version
of their unending war between chaos and order. The real challenge to tradi
tional Egyptian beliefs, however, was to come from another new religion:
Christianity.
At first Christianity was just one of many religions thriving in Egypt.
During the second and third centuries CE, Christians were brutally persecuted
for refusing to acknowledge that the Roman emperors were gods. Some early
Christian writers, such as the second-century CE Bishop Clement of Alexandria,
are useful though hostile witnesses on Egyptian religion. During the fourth cen
tury CE, Christianity became the dominant religion of the Roman Empire. The
date usually given for the end of Pharaonic culture is 395 CE. This was the year
when the Roman Empire was divided into two. Egypt became part of the east
ern, or Byzantine, Empire, and most of its pagan temples were closed down by
order of the emperor.
The Isis temple at Philae on Egypt’s southern border stayed open until the
sixth century CE because it was protected by Nubian tribes who still revered the
goddess. The latest known hieroglyphic texts are from Philae. When there was
no longer anyone left who could read the ancient texts, knowledge of the
Egyptian gods and their myths gradually died out. This change of religion was
far more significant for Egyptian culture than all the previous changes of gov
ernment.
POST-PHARAONIC EGYPT
The three centuries in which Egypt was predominantly a Christian country are
often referred to as the Coptic Period. It was in the deserts of Egypt that
Christian monasticism first developed, and the great monasteries partially took
the place of temples in Egyptian society. Christian chroniclers provide evidence
that some Egyptians clung to the old beliefs as late as the sixth century CE. A
few magical texts of this period still mention the myths of Isis and the Horus
Introduction 45



child, but most replace them
with anecdotes about the Virgin
Mary and Baby Jesus. The last
stories about the gods of Egypt
are those that tell of their defeat
by Coptic saints.109
In the seventh century CE,
Egypt was invaded first by the
Persians and then by the Arabs.
The Arabs brought with them
the Muslim religion, but many
of the native Egyptians (the
Copts) remained Christian. The
Coptic language fell out of gen
eral use around 1000 CE, but it
has continued to be used in the
liturgies of the Coptic church
right up to the present day. For
centuries Egypt was part of an
Arab empire ruled by caliphs in
Damascus or Baghdad. The
most famous of these caliphs
was Haroun al-Rashid, who fea
tures in the Arabian Nights
Entertainment, a vast collection
of stories compiled in medieval Egypt. Egypt’s greatest medieval leader was
Saladin (1169–1193 CE), who defended Egypt and Palestine against the Christian
crusaders. Arabic literature flourished in Egypt, and one of its themes was the
lost treasures and secrets of the ancient pagan sites.110
Medieval Christian pilgrims who visited Egypt because it was a Bible land
brought back descriptions of the pyramids, which they generally identified with
the granaries of Joseph. A crucial part of the Renaissance, which began in four
teenth-century CE Italy, was the rediscovery of Classical texts. During the fif
teenth and sixteenth centuries CE, Hermetica from Egypt were wrongly thought
to be the world’s most ancient religious documents. This aroused great interest
in Egyptian religion and its relationship to Judaism and Christianity. The myths
of Osiris, Isis, and Horus became the subject of sermons and essays. From the
sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries CE, there were many attempts to de
cipher Egyptian hieroglyphs.111

Up to the end of the eighteenth century CE, most of Egypt was a difficult
and dangerous place for Western travelers to visit. When the French leader
Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Egypt in 1798, he took many scholars and artists
with him. The survivors wrote and illustrated a multivolume Description of
Egypt, which contributed to a Europe-wide fascination for all things Egyptian.
Among the antiquities found during Napoleon’s campaign was the Rosetta
Stone. This was one of the documents used by the brilliant French linguist Jean
Francois Champollion to decipher the hieroglyphic script. The rage for collect
ing Egyptian antiquities meant that papyri and inscribed objects ended up in
museums and private collections all over the world. A fashion for holding
mummy-unwrapping parties inspired Gothic novels, such as Jane Webb’s The
Mummy (1827), which were forerunners of the modern horror genre.
Most major Egyptian religious and literary texts were translated into
Western languages during the second half of the nineteenth century CE. Some of
these sources, particularly E. A. Wallis Budge’s translation of the Book of the
Dead, were drawn on by occult writers such as the Theosophist Madam
Blavatsky and the self-styled Great Beast, Aleister Crowley. Sigmund Freud, the
founder of psychoanalysis, was attracted by the symbolic qualities of Ancient
Egyptian art, and his colleague Carl Jung was fascinated by Egyptian solar
mythology.112 Sir James Frazer, the “Father of Anthropology,” devoted several
chapters of his influential book The Golden Bough to the myths of Osiris and
Isis, which he interpreted as primarily relating to the annual growth and decay
of vegetation.113 Other twentieth-century CE anthropologists and historians of
religion used Ancient Egyptian religion to argue that myths were always linked
with rituals or even that all myths evolved to explain existing rituals. Extreme
advocates of the latter school derived all the world’s myths from prehistoric
Egyptian kingship rituals.114 Equally controversial in recent times has been
Martin Bernal’s work on the Egyptian contribution to Greek mythology and
culture.115 One offshoot of the feminist movement has been a new interest in
goddesses, and Isis is now worshipped again in many parts of the world.
Egyptian mythology has never been a key part of Western literature in the
way that Greek mythology has. Egyptian funerary religion and archaeology
have provided more inspiration to writers than Egyptian myths. The reanimated
mummy is the image that has captured the modern imagination, but the deities
of Ancient Egypt have appeared as peripheral characters in horror stories by
writers such as Théophile Gautier, Arthur Conan Doyle, Edgar Allen Poe, H.
Rider Haggard, Bram Stoker, H. P. Lovecraft, and Sax Rohmer (see “Egyptian
Myth: Annotated Print and Nonprint Resources”).116
The sensational discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922 encouraged
the cinema’s fascination with “the curse of the mummy.”117 The plot of the re
Introduction 47



cent Hollywood blockbuster The Mummy, in which a mercenary searches for a
magical golden book in a haunted city, is very close to that of the Setna story.
Like Setna, the hero has to learn that seeking the secret knowledge of the
Ancient Egyptians can be a risky business. You have been warned.

14. For a comprehensive list of all the deities recorded in the Early Dynastic Period, see Toby A. H. Wilkinson, Early Dynastic Egypt (London and New York, 1999), chap. 8.
15. In most periods the hippopotamus was a sacred animal of Seth. Several Early Dynastic labels show a king harpooning or even wrestling with a hippopotamus. Such representations may have been the origin of a late tradition that King Menes was killed during a hippopotamus hunt.
16. During all of the third and much of the second millennium BCE, Egyptian temples were mainly staffed on a rota basis. People were organized into “phyles” or crews that performed ritual duties in temples for one month in every ten. Temple archives, which show how this rota system worked in practice, have survived from the Old Kingdom. See Mark Lehner, The Complete Pyramids (London, 1997), 233–235.
17. Early examples of such topographical lists are discussed and interpreted by John Baines in “An Abydos List of Gods and an Old Kingdom Use of Texts,” in Pyramid Studies and Other Essays Presented to I. E .S. Edwards, ed. John Baines (London, 1988), 124–133.
18. For a summary of recent theories about pyramid complexes, see Dieter Arnold, “Royal Cult Complexes of the Old and Middle Kingdoms,” in Temples of Ancient Egypt, ed. Byron E. Shafer (Ithaca, 1997), 31–85.
19. For a full bibliography of translations and interpretations of the Pyramid Texts and all the other funerary texts mentioned in this chapter, see Erik Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Books of the Afterlife, trans. David Lorton (Ithaca and London, 1999).
20. Recent research has suggested that the stars and planets were thought of as forming part of the great cycle of the sun’s progression through the sky, so it was not contradictory to claim that the deceased king was joining both the sun and the stars.
21. These statements are from Pyramid Text 477. This is typical of the way in which the death of Osiris was alluded to (he has “fallen upon his side”) but never clearly described. The belief that this terrible event should not be directly shown or narrated persisted right until the end of Egyptian culture.
22. This provincial use may only be evidence for the gradual spread of literacy and an increasing availability of artists outside the capital. Some parts of the Pyramid Texts were probably recited at private funerals long before they were first written down on private tomb walls and coffins.
23. Extracts from the Pyramid Texts occur on tomb walls and coffins right down to the Ptolemaic Period (332–30 BC). It is a remarkable testament to the longevity of Egyptian culture that educated people living in this period could read and appreciate texts composed over 2,000 years earlier.
24. See Kurt Sethe, Dramatische Texte zu altägyptischen Mysterienspielen (Leipzig, 1928). Egyptologists have been unable to agree on the nature of the rituals recorded in this text. They have been interpreted as a coronation ceremony, or as part of the sed festival at which a king’s power was renewed by the gods, or a royal funeral.
25. For a persuasive interpretation of the religious symbolism of Middle Kingdom tomb decoration, see Janice Kamrin, The Cosmos of Khnumhotep II at Beni Hasan (London and New York, 1999).

30. The services in Egyptian temples did not include a congregation. Only priests were allowed to enter the sanctuary and touch the image of the deity. Hymns were sung by temple musicians as part of the process of “waking” a deity each morning. For temple music, see Lisa Manniche, Music and Musicians in Ancient Egypt (London, 1991), chap. 4.

32. The text is translated by Richard B. Parkinson in The Tale of Sinuhe and Other Ancient Egyptian Poems 1940–1640 BC (Oxford, 1997),166–199.
33. In his Folktales of Egypt (Chicago, 1980), Hasan M. El-Shamy argues that “book stories” and oral folk stories develop in parallel, but he cites a number of “crossovers.”
34. For translations of these tales, see “Appendix: Primary Sources” under P. Westcar.
35. The story is translated and discussed by Hans Goedicke in “The Story of the Herdsman,” Chronique d’Égypte 45 (1970): 244–266; and by Parkinson in The Tale of Sinuhe, 287–288.

40. Names linked to the opponents of Ra were sometimes given to criminals and foreign enemies as part of a procedure to obliterate their identities in life and the afterlife. It is possible that this Hyksos ruler continued to use a name that was given to him as an insult when he first came to Egypt.

42. This inscription is sometimes called the “King as Sun Priest text.” It may derive from the scripts for Middle Kingdom rituals. The text is discussed and translated in J. Assmann’s Egyptian Solar Religion in the New Kingdom: Re, Amun, and the Crisis of Polytheism, trans. Anthony Alcock (London and New York, 1995), 18–21.
43. Some offerings suggest that temple visitors were familiar with deities’ mythological roles, but whether this knowledge came through stories or images is unclear. See G. Pinch, Votive Offerings to Hathor (Oxford, 1993).
44. For the influence of solar and lunar mythology on the art and architecture of Amenhotep III’s reign, see “Designing the Cosmos” in A. P. Kozloff and B. M. Bryan, Egypt’s Dazzling Sun: Amenhotep III and His World (Cleveland, 1992), 73–124.
45. For modern myth making about Akhenaten and Nefertiti, see D. Montserrat, Akhenaten History, Fantasy, and Ancient Egypt (London and New York, 2000).
46. At a large temple such as the one at Karnak, there were four “shifts,” so no one had to spend more than a quarter of their time on ritual duties. For all aspects of the priesthood, see David Lorton’s new translation of S. Sauneron’s The Priests of Ancient Egypt (Ithaca and London), 2000.
47. More specifically, the temples were models of the cosmos as it was newly created “in the First Time.” For a summary of the symbolic aspects of temples, see “The Temple as Cosmos,” in E. Hornung, Idea into Image: Essays on Ancient Egyptian Thought (Princeton, 1992), 115–130; or “Worlds within Worlds,” in R. H. Wilkinson, The Complete Temples of Ancient Egypt (London, 2000), 52–79.
48. Greek visitors such as Diodorus Siculus later interpreted such scenes as representing a mythical battle between gods and giants set in the far past, but the Egyptians used contemporary enemies as characters in their defining myth of the war between order and chaos.
49. Hatshepsut’s scenes are at Deir el-Bahari and Amenhotep III’s at Luxor temple. The scenes involving Rameses II are only known from a few stray blocks.
50. Seth was the local deity of the part of the eastern Delta from which Seti and his family came. At Abydos, a picture of Osiris sometimes replaces the picture of Seth, which should be used to write the king’s name.
51. For example, every cult image was treated as if it were the mummified body of Osiris, which could be restored to life by offerings symbolizing the powerful Eye of Horus. See A. R. David, A Guide to Religious Ritual at Abydos (Warminster, England, 1981).
52. The Osireion was probably begun under Seti I and finished by his grandson Merenptah.
53. The hymn is found on the stela of the official Amenmose (Louvre Museum C 286). See in “Appendix: Primary Sources.”
54. The majority of the Underworld Books first appear in the late Eighteenth and early Nineteenth Dynasties, perhaps as a counterreaction to Akhenaten’s efforts to abolish the realm of Osiris. For summaries of all the Underworld Books, see Hornung, The Ancient Egyptian Books of the Afterlife.
Introduction 51



55. The Egyptians seem to have been the first people to divide the day into twenty-four hours: twelve for the day and twelve for the night.
56. The tomb of Rameses VI (c. 1143–1136 BCE) includes all or part of seven Underworld Books. This alone suggests that they were not to be taken as factual descriptions of the afterlife. Underworld Books were true in the sense that they were thought to be effective in bringing about a desired state.
57. In a forthcoming book, Crowns in Egyptian Funerary Literature—Symbols of Royalty, Rebirth, and Destruction, Katja Goebs suggests that the myth of the destruction of mankind evolved from a myth of the sun god’s reabsorption of the powers of all the other celestial beings, just as the sun appears to swallow up the stars at dawn.
58. For translations of a selection of these hymns, see “Hymns and Prayers to Amun-Re: The Apogee of Ancient Egyptian Religious Thought,”’ in J. L. Foster, Hymns, Prayers and Songs: An Anthology of Ancient Egyptian Lyric Poetry, ed. Susan Tower Hollis (Atlanta, 1995), 55–79. The problem of the nature of the relationship between the one creator deity and the myriad other gods and goddesses continued to fascinate Egyptian thinkers long after Akhenaten’s solution had been rejected. See Assmann, Egyptian Solar Religion In the New Kingdom.
59. J. Assmann, “Death and Initiation in the Funerary Religion of Ancient Egypt,” in J. P.

For the possible influence of Egyptian concepts of divine judgment on other religions, see S. G. F. Brandon, The Judgement of the Dead: An Historical and Comparative Study of the Idea of Post-mortem Judgement in the Major Religions (London, 1967).
60. For example, a man named Neferabu describes how the goddess Meretseger struck him down like a savage lioness because he had sinned against her. This seems to be a reference to the myth told in the Book of the Heavenly Cow of humanity’s being punished for its sins by the unleashing of a terrible lioness. For a translation of Neferabu’s stela, see “Appendix: Primary Sources.”
61. Owing to the occupation of the villagers, there was an unusually high literacy rate in Deir el-Medina. Even so, most of the artists probably could not read the texts of the Underworld Books they copied onto the walls of the royal tombs. For the religious life of the villagers, see L. H. Lesko (ed.), Pharaoh’s Workers (Ithaca and London, 1994).
62. See John Baines, “Myth and Literature,” in Loprieno, Ancient Egyptian Literature, 373–374.

66. The Ancient Egyptian year was divided into three seasons, each lasting four months. The months were mainly named after deities. For a translation of the Cairo Calendar, see “Appendix: Primary Sources.”
67. The ostensible reason for moving the royal mummies was to save them from tomb robbers, but it also allowed the high priests to recycle the treasure buried with these rulers. The mummies were gathered together and hidden in two separate tombs, where they were rediscovered in the nineteenth century CE.
68. The burial equipment from these tombs, which includes splendid jewelry with mythological motifs, is displayed in the Cairo Museum. Hardly any royal tombs from the rest of the first millennium BCE have survived in Egypt, but it is known that Underworld Books continued to be used on royal sarcophagi.
69. For examples of such amulets, see C. Andrews, Amulets of Ancient Egypt (London, 1994), pls.80, 101.
70. For the myth of Atum’s creating life with his hand, see “Creation” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines.” The word for hand was feminine in Egyptian. For further information on these powerful royal women, see G. Robins, Women in Ancient Egypt (London and Cambridge, MA, 1993), chap. 8.

79. The text is from the Ismailia Naos, also known as El-Arish Naos. See “Appendix: Primary Sources.”
80. The implication is that Egypt was defeated because this warrior god had withdrawn his protection.
81. One version of the Memphis decree is in the contemporary Demotic language and script; the other is in a classicizing neo–Middle Egyptian language written in hieroglyphs. The Rosetta Stone played an important role in the decipherment of the hieroglyphic script in the nineteenth century CE. The Memphis decree is translated by R. S. Simpson in R. Parkinson, Cracking Codes: The Rosetta Stone and Decipherment (London, 1999).

85. The birth of Isis was celebrated at Dendara. This is an example of how a type of myth that originally applied to only one god was adapted for other deities who had become important. The classic publication on temple birth houses is F. Daumas, Les mammisis des temples égyptiens (Paris, 1958).
86. Followers of the theory that drama was born from the coming together of myth and ritual have cited the Festival of Victory as one of the world’s oldest plays. See H. W. Fairman, The Triumph of Horus: An Ancient Egyptian Sacred Drama (London, 1974).

95. Strabo gave a particularly vivid account of watching sacred crocodiles being fed, an event that had become something of a tourist attraction.
96. For most of Egyptian history there were about 750 hieroglyphic signs in use. By the Roman Period the number of signs had risen to around 7,000, and the old signs were often used in new ways. See “Figurative Hieroglyphs, or ‘Cryptography,’” in Parkinson, Cracking Codes, 80–87.

Other examples of continuing knowledge of ancient religious texts in the Roman Period are provided in a version of the New Kingdom Book of Nut in Papyrus Carlsberg I and the use of part of the Book of the Heavenly Cow in a compilation known as the Book of the Fayum. For translations, see BofN and BHC in “Appendix: Primary Sources.”
101. This tale is part of a series of stories (the Petubastis cycle) set in the Third Intermediate Period. Some commentators believe that Homer’s Iliad was an influence on this cycle. By the Roman Period the Egyptians were claiming that Homer had been born in Thebes and was a son of the god Thoth. For a translation of the Amazons’ story, see Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature, 3:151–156.
102. See EofS in “Appendix: Primary Sources.” Part of a direct Greek translation of this version survives and is thought to have had an influence on the development of Ancient Greek fiction. See W. J. Tait, “Egyptian Fiction in Demotic and Greek,” in Greek Fiction, ed. J. R. Morgan and R. Stoneman (London, 1994), 212–213.
103. The moral given in Aesop is that “a change of fortune can make the strongest man need a weaker man’s help” (translation by S. A. Handford, Fables of Aesop [London, 1954], 41); in the Egyptian version the moral is “it is beautiful to do good to him who does it in turn” (translation by Lichtheim, Ancient Egyptian Literature 3: 159).
104. At this point, Imhotep had been worshipped as a god for well over a thousand years, but he was still treated as a historical figure in literature. This suggests that the Egyptians were not prone to confuse historical and mythical characters.
105. For a summary of this important text, see R. Jasnow and K. T. Zauzich, “A Book of Thoth?” in Eyre, Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Egyptologists, 607–618. It has no connection with Aleister Crowley’s The Book of Thoth, which is about Tarot cards.

MYTHICAL TIME LINES
T
he Egyptians did not think of time as moving at the same rate for all
classes of beings or in all parts of the cosmos. For the dead, an hour in
the presence of the sun god was said to be equivalent to a lifetime in
Egypt. Nor was time always thought of as a linear progression. Historical
Egyptians lived in linear time, experienced by each person as past, present, and
future—like points on a straight line. King lists reflect this view of time, some
times arranging kings or dynasties one after another even when they reigned
contemporaneously. Yet the standard dating system started again with the
reign of each new king because the Egyptians also thought of time as moving
in cycles.
In these cycles, time appears to loop back on itself, and patterns of events
are repeated, often at fixed intervals. In this view of time the roles of cause and
effect can appear to be reversed, creating temporal paradoxes. Egyptian kings,
for example, were sometimes said to be their own fathers.
The main part of this mythical time line consists of a linear mythical
“history” in which I have laid out the principal events of Egyptian myth in the
order in which they should logically occur. It is important to bear in mind that
although everything in this section is drawn from original sources, no Ancient
Egyptian text that we know of attempts this kind of synthesis. I then look at
how the same events recur in different patterns in cyclical time.
LINEAR TIME
The mythical story of Egypt can be divided into seven stages: chaos (pre
creation), the emergence of the creator, the creation of the world and its in
habitants, the reign of the sun god, the period of direct rule by other deities, the
period of rule by semidivine kings (history), and the return to chaos.



Chaos
Summary: Before creation there was a state of chaos that contained the potential
for all life. This inchoate state was imagined as a dark watery domain of unlimited
depth and extent. Elements and qualities of chaos could be personified as gods and
goddesses. Some of these deities had to change or die to begin the creative process.
The origin of the universe was an intellectual problem that came to fasci
nate the Egyptians. Texts that allude to the unknowable era before creation de
fine it as the time “‘before two things had developed.”1 The cosmos was not yet
divided into pairs of opposites such as earth and sky, light and darkness, male
and female, or life and death.
The Egyptians speculated that the primeval substance was watery and dark
and had no form and no boundaries. These primeval waters, known as the nu or
the nun, continued to surround the world even after creation and were thought
of as the ultimate source of the Nile. When personified as a deity, Nun could be
called the father and mother of the creator, because the creator was thought of
as coming into existence within the nun.
After creation, qualities of the primeval state, such as its darkness, were
retrospectively endowed with consciousness and became a group of deities
known as the Eight or the Ogdoad of Hermopolis (see “Deities, Themes, and
Concepts”). The Eight were imagined as amphibians and reptiles, fertile crea
tures of the dark primeval slime. They were the forces that shaped the creator
or even the first manifestations of the creator. In order to become “the fathers
and mothers” of life, they had to change or, in some accounts, to die. Several
temples claimed to be the burial place of these primeval deities.
Amun and his female counterpart Amunet were often regarded as part of
the Eight and personified hidden power. When Amun became a national god, a
new theology made Amun the invisible, unknowable force that began the
movement toward independent life. In some accounts the Eight join together to
be fertilized by the “seed” of the serpent Amun Kem-atef, the “first primeval
god who gave birth to the primeval gods.”2
The serpent may have been considered an appropriate form for the spirit of
the creator because of its undivided body or because it periodically renewed it
self by shedding its skin. When creator gods such as Amun or Atum are spoken
of as serpents, they usually represent the positive aspect of chaos as an energy
force, but they had a negative counterpart in the great serpent Apophis. Apophis
represented the destructive aspect of chaos that constantly tried to overwhelm
all individual beings and reduce everything back to its primeval state of “one
ness.” So, even before creation began, the world contained the elements of its
own destruction.

Emergence of the Creator
Summary: The creator attains consciousness and becomes lonely. He/she differ
entiates the elements of chaos by speaking their names. The first light or the
first sound begins the process of creation. The creator appears as the sun god.
He may be born to a cow, emerge from a lotus on the water or from an egg, or
alight in the form of a bird on the first mound of solid land.
The creator was the “unique one in the nun” who existed in this womblike
environment as “one who is in his egg.” The creator was in an inert state, yet
this state contained the potential for all life. Passages in the Coffin Texts stress
that the “self-created god” came into being alone. For a group-oriented culture
such as that of the Egyptians, such loneliness must have been almost unimagin
able. The creator remained alone until his/her “heart became effective” and
he/she began to think and feel.
In Coffin Texts spell 76, the creator (here named as Atum) brings eight gods
into existence “by speaking with the nun,” presumably separating the elements
of chaos by the process of naming them. Other texts refer to the creator’s driv
ing back the primeval waters, perhaps by the power of spoken command, to cre
ate a space in which to begin the work of creation.
Images of Emergence. The “primal event” of the emergence of the creator to
dispel the watery silent darkness could be represented in many different ways.
No single image or narrative was considered sufficient to express such a won
der. Egyptian cosmogonies (creation accounts) often combine several different
traditions about the creator, but rarely in any kind of temporal framework.3
The first act of the creator might be an exhalation of breath or a great cry.
The first light came with the first appearance of the creator as the life-giving
power of the sun. This manifestation could be pictured as an eye, a child, or a
fiery bird. In Coffin Texts spell 75, although the creator is still alone in the nun,
he/she sends out his/her eye to illumine the darkness and search for other life.
Another image of the first sunrise was a blue lotus rising above the surface of
the nun (see “Lotus” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). From the New
Kingdom onward, a naked child or a ram-headed figure was shown sitting in the
lotus to represent the newborn sun.
The fertile aspect of the nun could be personified as the goddess Mehet-Weret,
whose name means the Great Flood or the Great Swimmer. She was usually
shown as a cow and was considered the mother of all the primeval beings, includ
ing Apophis. Mehet-Weret was envisaged as giving birth to the sun child and lift
ing him up on her horns. A New Kingdom hymn tells us that with the first light
the sky became like gold and the primeval waters like lapis-lazuli.

The sun might also be thought of as emerging from a “cosmic egg” laid by a
primeval bird (see under “Birds” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”) or, less of
ten, by a snake or a crocodile. The role of the primeval bird could also be to
break the silence. Some cosmogonies allude to a goose known as the Great
Honker or Cackler whose strident cry was the first sound. The shining benu bird
(see “Benu Bird” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”) brought both the first
noise and the first light to the nun. The creation myths inscribed in the Edfu
temple give this role to a falcon, who alights on a floating mass of vegetation.
Alternatively, the first bird was said to have found a resting place on the
first mound of dry land. The creator could not become fully active until there
was a place in which to exist. At this stage, the nun was thought of as a great
swamp from which the first land, the Primeval Mound, suddenly emerged.
This mound could be personified as the god Tatjenen, “the rising land.”
Tatjenen, who was often identified with Ptah, could also be called the “father”
of the creator.4 One of the sacred books at Edfu was the Book of the Mounds of
the First Time. This presents a primeval landscape of mounds, water, and reeds

that is close to what the Nile val
ley must have looked like before it
was settled by the first Egyptians.5
The creator could now begin the
work of creating the world and its
inhabitants.
Creation
Summary: At different periods and
in various theological centers, a
number of deities could be identi
fied with the creator who emerged
from the primeval waters. These
creator deities include the gods
Atum, Ra (often combined as Ra
Atum), Shu, Ptah, Khnum, and
Amun-Ra and the goddesses Neith, Hathor, and Isis. Important stages in the
creation process were the establishment of maat, the divine order; the division
of beings into male and female; and the separation of earth and sky.
The Egyptian cosmos consisted of a divine realm in the upper sky; the
earth, with Egypt its center; and the Duat (or Dat), the underworld that was to
become the realm of the dead. The creator produced other deities and then
lesser beings such as people and animals.
The One Who Made Himself into Millions. In many Egyptian sources the cre
ation of life involves three elements: the creation of a body, the transfer to that
body of some part of the divine essence of the creator, and the animation of the
body by the breath of life. Some creator deities were more strongly associated
with one of these elements than with the others. Khnum, for example, was
chiefly a creator of bodies, whereas Shu and Amun-Ra were both gods of the un
seen breath of life. The second element, the transfer of the divine essence, even
tually led to the concept that all deities, or even all living beings, were not just
made by a transcendent creator but were in some sense forms of the creator.
From the New Kingdom onward, this was a distinctive feature of Egyptian reli
gious thought.
The creator was sometimes referred to as “the One Who Made Himself into
Millions” or “He Who Made Himself into Millions of Gods.”6 Creation could
be seen as a process of differentiation, in which one original force was gradually
Mythical Time Lines 61

of Ra and the Eyes of Horus could all be shown in this
way. (British Museum)



divided (without necessarily diminishing itself) into the diverse elements that
made up the universe. The ways in which this could have happened were the
subject of much speculation.
The Heart and the Tongue. The intellectual powers that enabled the creator
to bring himself/herself into existence and to create other beings were some
times conceptualized as deities. The most important of these were the gods Sia,
Hu, and Heka. Sia was the power of perception or insight, which allowed the
creator to visualize other forms. Hu was the power of authoritative speech,
which enabled the creator to bring things into being by naming them. In Coffin
Texts spell 335, Hu and Sia are said to be with their “father” Atum every day. In
the illustrated Underworld Books of the New Kingdom, these two deities were
often shown accompanying the creator sun god.
The power by which the thoughts and commands of the creator became re
ality was Heka (Magic). In Coffin Texts spell 261, the god Heka claims to have
been with the creator even in the primeval era. In the cosmogony of Neith
recorded in the Roman Period temple at Esna, this goddess creates the whole
world with seven magic words. When Isis came to be worshipped as a creator
deity during the same period, she was called the Mistress of the Word in the
Beginning.
From at least as early as the New Kingdom, the god Ptah could represent
the creative mind. Then Sia and Hu were identified as the heart and tongue of
Ptah. This concept is expounded in the so-called Memphite Theology and in
various hymns to Ptah. The Ancient Egyptians believed that the heart was the
organ of thought and feeling. So Ptah was said to have made the world after
planning it in his heart. It was “through what the heart plans and the tongue
commands” that everything was made. Typically, the Memphite Theology also
mentions other models of creation, such as the concept of the creator as Divine
Craftsman or as the biological source of all life. The Egyptians did not take any
one of these theories too literally. They were diverse but complementary at
tempts to convey something of the ultimately unknowable mystery of creation.
The Divine Craftsman. Two deities, Ptah and Khnum, were sometimes cred
ited with physically “fashioning” the world and its inhabitants. Ptah was the
patron god of craftsmen and artists. He was particularly associated with sculp
ture and metalworking. Ptah was said to have invented the Opening of the
Mouth ritual in which an adze and other tools were used to “bring to life” stat
ues and mummies.7 Hymns to Ptah speak of him designing and crafting the
world and “smelting the Two Lands” (Egypt). He was also said to make bodies
for kings out of electrum (an alloy of gold and silver), copper, and iron.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
62



Presumably these were the bodies that kings hoped to inhabit in the divine
realm.
The shaping of royal bodies was a task more usually attributed to Khnum.
Khnum was represented by a ram, an animal renowned for aggressive virility.
He was sometimes described as “begetting” the gods, but as a creator he was
usually celebrated as the divine craftsman who “formed everything” on his pot
ter’s wheel. Craftsmen were valued and well treated in Egyptian society, but
few of them attained high social status. Khnum’s original role seems to have
been as the divine potter who made things at the command of the creator.
When he became a form of the universal creator, Khnum’s name was usually
linked with those of more established creator deities such as Ra or Ptah.
The Hand of Atum. Before creation begins there is no division into genders.
The creator seems to include both the male and female principles. Creator
deities were commonly called “the father and mother of all things.” Deities
who were normally regarded as male, such as Atum, are described as “giving
birth” to other deities during the creative process.8
The actual means by which the creator reproduced were sometimes left
vague and sometimes described in terms of blunt sexual imagery. Pyramid
Texts (PT) spell 527 says that Atum took his penis in his hand and masturbated
“and so were born the two siblings, that is Shu and Tefnut.” In PT 600, Atum
Khepri is said to be the one who spat out Shu and Tefnut.9 Several passages in
the Coffin Texts refer to Shu being exhaled from Atum’s nose and Tefnut being
spat from his mouth.
These apparently contradictory statements are clarified in later sources,
such as the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus and the Memphite Theology. Atum excites
his penis with his hand and takes the semen into his mouth. The vignettes to
some mythological papyri illustrate this moment in graphic detail. The mouth
of the creator acts as a substitute womb. Atum uses his powers of thought and
utterance to transform the seed into the first two gendered deities, who are ex
pelled from his mouth or through the nose and mouth.
The combination of biological and intellectual methods of creation is
stressed in the Memphite Theology, which states that the Ennead of Atum (the
first nine deities created) “came into existence through his seed and his fingers,
but the Ennead is the teeth and lips in this mouth that spoke the name of every
thing and from which Shu and Tefnut came forth.”
Once the twins had been born, the sexual identity of Atum becomes fixed
as a father. A further development was the personification of the Hand of Atum
as a goddess, thus giving him a sexual partner. Since the Hand goddess came di
rectly from the creator, she was his “daughter” as well as his consort. This god
Mythical Time Lines 63



dess was often identified with Hathor, who came to be regarded as the female
creative principle.
The twins sometimes appear to be the male and female aspects of Atum.
He embraces them to transfer his ka (vital essence) to them. In Coffin Texts
spell 80, Shu and Tefnut are described as living with their father in the primeval
waters. The three deities cling tightly to each other as if they were still one en
tity. For creation to continue, Shu and Tefnut had to become fully differentiated
from the creator.
The Lost Children. There are some allusions in the Coffin Texts to Atum be
coming separated from his children. Shu and Tefnut seem to have drifted away
from their father and become lost in the darkness of the primeval waters. In
Coffin Texts spell 76, Shu is made to say that “Atum once sent his Sole Eye
searching for me and Tefnut, my sister. I made light in the darkness and it
found me.” This eye is usually called the daughter of Ra, rather than of Atum,
because she is part of the creator’s solar aspect.10 The Sole Eye is the disk of the
sun envisaged as a goddess. She can function separately from the sun god but re
mains a part of him. The search for the lost children in Coffin Texts spell 76 is
one of the many myths about the first sunrise. Shu, the god of air, creates a void
in the primeval waters so that the solar eye can shine for the first time.11
A fuller version of this myth found in the Bremner-Rhind Papyrus has a
different emphasis. The Lord of All recounts how Shu and Tefnut were nur
tured by the god of the primeval waters, “with my Eye (following) after them
from the time they became separated from me.” When the creator came fully
into existence on the Primeval Mound, Shu and Tefnut rejoiced and returned
with the Eye. “Then she became furious after she had come back and found
that I had put another in her place.” The creator has apparently grown a new
eye/disk.
To appease his angry “daughter,” the creator transforms her into the first
snake, the uraeus cobra, and puts her in the place of honor on his forehead.12
This is one of several myths about the anger and appeasement of the solar eye.
The creator’s relationships with the aspects of his being that are embodied as
daughter-goddesses are crucial to this stage of creation.
The Divine Order and the Separation of Earth and Sky. In Coffin Texts spell
80, new identities are given to Shu and Tefnut. Atum names Shu as Life and
Tefnut as Maat (Truth, Justice, Order). By naming these qualities, the creator
brings them into existence. Atum embraces the two forms of his daughter,
Tefnut and Maat.13 Nun, the god of the primeval waters, tells Atum to kiss
Maat and place her at his nose “so that your heart may live.” Maat the goddess
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
64



was the favorite daughter of the creator, the one who brought her father joy.
Maat as a concept was the ordering and governing principle of the created
world.14 The opposite of maat was isfet (chaos, disorder) or gereg (wrongdoing,
evil). The creator and all his/her creations were to live on and through maat.
All Egyptian rulers, and those who helped them to govern, were supposed to es
tablish the state of maat on earth, “as it was in the First Time.”
A series of cosmic events was part of the First Time. Shu and Tefnut sepa
rated from their father and came together in the first sexual union of male and
female. Tefnut then gave birth to another pair of deities, a son Geb, who was as
sociated with the earth, and a daughter Nut, who was associated with the sky.
Geb and Nut embraced each other so ardently that there was no room between
them for anything to exist. Nut conceived children but could not or would not
give birth to them. Geb and Nut seemed to want to become one, reversing the
movement toward diversity. If creation was to continue, another separation was
necessary.
In his new manifestation of giver of life, Shu separated his children Geb and
Nut. According to Coffin Texts spell 76, Shu lifted up his daughter Nut and set
his son Geb under his feet. This image was first portrayed in detail on coffins
and funerary papyri at the end of the New Kingdom. Geb is shown sprawling at
the bottom of the picture, sometimes still in a state of sexual arousal. Shu
stands with his arms raised supporting the arched body of Nut (see Figure 42).
This arm position was the hieroglyphic symbol that wrote the word ka (life
force or vital essence), which helps to emphasize that Shu is making life possi
ble. Many other beings, including the entities known as the Heh gods, can be
shown assisting Shu to support the sky above the earth.
Shu created a space between earth and sky in which creatures could breathe
the air that gives life. In this space, the sun could rise for the first time and
drive away the primeval darkness. This first sunrise is “the perfect moment”
celebrated in numerous Egyptian texts and images. From this moment the cre
ator was chiefly manifest in the world as the sun god Ra. The boundaries of the
physical world became fixed, though the upper sky (Nut), the atmosphere (Shu),
and the earth (Geb) were still encircled by the dark primeval waters. As part of
establishing the divine order, Shu and Tefnut also become two different types of
time. “Shu is Eternal Recurrence and Tefnut is Eternal Sameness.”15 This began
a great cycle in which everything had to change to survive and yet everything
remained fundamentally the same.
The separation of Nut and Geb made it possible for their children to be
born. These were the gods Osiris, Seth, and Horus “the Two-Eyed” and the god
desses Isis and Nephthys. Some sources leave out Horus. A tradition as old as
the Pyramid Texts had Seth break violently out of his mother’s womb. Seth was
Mythical Time Lines 65



a god whose nature linked him with chaos, so the birthday of Seth was said to
be the day on which disorder and strife first entered the world.
Osiris, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys, together with Geb and Nut, Shu and
Tefnut, and Ra-Atum, made up the four-generational group of deities known as
the Ennead of Heliopolis or the Great Ennead. Horus, the sky falcon whose two
eyes were the sun and the moon, was probably left out of the nine because he
was usually thought of as a manifestation of the creator sun god. The number
nine was sometimes used by the Egyptians to indicate “many,” so the establish
ment of the Ennead can stand for the creation of the whole pantheon of deities.
Other deities were said to come into existence through words spoken by the
creator or from substances exuded from his/her body, such as saliva, sweat, or
blood.
Now that a world existed, it could be inhabited by the whole range of be
ings conceived of by the creator. These included all manner of animals, birds,
fish, and reptiles “which are on the back of Geb.” In addition to these, there
was “god’s herd”—humanity.
The Creation of Humanity. The creation of humanity does not occupy a cen
tral position in Egyptian myth. Some creation accounts omit humans alto
gether. They are only mentioned in passing in the Memphite Theology, listed
between gods and cattle (a term covering all animals). The Egyptians sometimes
divided sentient beings into four types: gods, kings, the spirits of the dead, and
living people.
The Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom concentrate on the afterlife of the
king and have little to say about living people, so it is not surprising that they
contain no allusions to myths about the creation of humanity. Such myths
seem to have been well established by the time of the Middle Kingdom. Several
spells in the Coffin Texts include speeches referring to the creation of human
ity. In Coffin Texts spell 1130, the Lord of All says that he created deities from
his sweat and “people from the tears of my eye.” Everything that came from a
god’s body was deemed to be divine and capable of creative power. As with the
sneezing and spitting that produced Shu and Tefnut, wordplay is involved. The
Egyptian words for people and for tears were homophones; they sounded similar
although they would have been written differently. Most such mythical word
play was ephemeral or relatively insignificant, but the association of people
with divine tears was a popular theme for over 2,000 years.
Several different traditions about the tears of the creator are discernible
even in Middle Kingdom writings. In Coffin Texts spell 80, these tears belong to
the period of pre-creation. Humanity, it says, came forth from the Sole Eye,
which was sent out while the creator Atum was still alone and inert in the
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
66



primeval waters. The cause of the Eye’s weeping is not stated, but it may be
from loneliness as it searches for other beings. The potential to produce humans
is contained in the Eye, but they cannot come into existence until the world
has been created. This is described later in the text, when Shu separates the
earth and sky and gives the breath of life to all creatures on earth, including
people, “in accordance with the command of Atum.” So Atum wills the cre
ation of humanity, but another deity carries it out.
In Coffin Texts spell 714, humanity is said to have sprung from tears wept
by the creator because of the anger against him, tears that caused a temporary
state of blindness. This may be a reference to the rage of the Sole Eye when she
discovers that the creator has grown a new eye in her absence. The creator’s
blindness implies a temporary loss of his power of creative insight or perception
(Sia). Humanity is the imperfect product of rage and misery: a genesis suited to
the rebellious role humanity plays in mythical history.
One hymn to the creator states that humanity came forth from the two di
vine eyes, which are the sun and the moon.16 In the account of creation in the
Bremner-Rhind Papyrus, people originate in the tears wept by the creator on the
return of Shu and Tefnut. It is not clear whether these are tears of joy at the re
union with his children or tears of sorrow at the angry reaction of the solar eye.
In the cosmogony of Neith, the sun god Ra is said to weep when he is first born
because he finds himself alone and unable to see his mother. It is these tears of
sorrow and loneliness that produce humanity. In contrast, deities arise as a by
product of Ra’s joy when his mother, Neith, returns. So, most versions of the
tears myth provide an explanation for the perpetually sorrowful and imperfect
state of humanity.
In spite of this imperfection, the creator was said to have done many things
to help humanity. In Coffin Texts 1130, the Lord of All describes his four good
deeds. These were to create the four winds to give the breath of life to every
body, to make the annual Nile flood so that everyone would get enough food, to
create everyone with equal potential, and to make every person’s heart “re
member the West.” This last deed implies that from the beginning humans
were destined for an eternal life in the Beautiful West, the realm of the dead. A
Middle Kingdom text set in the turbulent First Intermediate Period compares
humanity with a flock and the (unnamed) creator with the good shepherd who
cares for them. “For their sakes He made heaven and earth, and drove away the
rapacity of the waters. So that their nostrils should live He made the winds.
They are images of Him, come forth from His flesh. For their sakes He rises in
heaven. For them He made plants and flocks. . . .”17
New Kingdom hymns to the creator god Amun also refer to god making peo
ple “in his own image” but are vague about how this was done. In a hymn to Ptah
Mythical Time Lines 67



this god is said to have “crafted people” as well as fashioning the physical forms
of the gods. The bodies of deities were usually said to be made of precious metals
and stones, but those of people were made from mud or clay. These were the ma
terials used by the creator god Khnum, who “formed all on his potter’s wheel.”
Khnum did not perform this task just once during the First Time. His
wheel was said to turn every day. He appears to be a god of continuous creation,
working to make the bodies of all creatures destined to live on earth. Khnum
shapes a body for each individual before they are born and a double for their ka
or vital force. Hymns in the temple of Esna elaborate on this idea. They list all
the parts of the human body created by Khnum and the functions they are to
perform, such as the tongue for speaking and the legs for walking. The list in
cludes both male and female body parts.
The Egyptian word for people used in creation texts was normally written
with pictures of a man and a woman following the phonetic part of the word.
Humanity seems to have been divided into two genders from the beginning.
This is in contrast to other ancient mythologies that made woman an af
terthought or an offshoot of the male body. One surviving text may suggest the
existence of a myth of this type. This is the New Kingdom story known as the
Two Brothers (see “Mythology in Literature” under “New Kingdom and Third
Intermediate Period ” in “Introduction”).
After being falsely accused of trying to rape his brother’s wife, Bata goes to
live in a remote valley. There he meets the Ennead of Heliopolis. These nine
gods decide to give Bata a wife to relieve his loneliness. Khnum shapes a
woman with a body more beautiful than any other, and the divine exhalations
of the Ennead give her life. This “perfect woman” soon leaves Bata to marry the
king of Egypt and subsequently murders her husband in several of his incarna
tions. In this story, women seem to be regarded as intrinsically flawed.18 Much
the same could be said, however, of most categories of being in the Egyptian
universe. Even the creator was not always all-powerful or all-knowing.
Period of Direct Rule by the Creator Sun God
Summary: The creator sun god, usually identified as Ra, ruled the earth for a
long period. There was no separation between gods and people during this era.
Some deities defied the authority of the sun god when he began to age. The god
dess Isis plotted to make her unborn son the heir of Ra. The Eye of Ra quarreled
with her father but was persuaded to return to defend him. When humanity re
belled against his rule, Ra sent his Eye to destroy the evildoers and withdrew to
live in the sky.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
68



Most Egyptian chronologies start with a mythical period when Egypt and
the rest of the world were ruled directly by creator gods. The creator was
thought of as living in a palace in Egypt, the most favored part of his creation.
Many cultures have a myth of a lost golden age, when gods or semidivine rulers
presided over a world without pain or conflict. The Egyptian material only
partly fits this pattern.
In the reign of Ra, the gods, including Maat, live on earth, and the creator
cares for his creation in person. Everything should be in harmony with the di
vine order, but two things prevent this age from remaining one of perfect peace
and joy. First, the sun god gradually grows old; second, there are plots and rebel
lions against his authority. Peace and joy do not generate interesting stories, so
it is hardly surprising that the only myths set in this era deal with the decline
and end of the sun god’s reign.
The aging of the sun god is described in a story known in modern times as
Isis and Ra or the True Name of Ra. Its ancient title places it among “the spells
for warding off poison from the First Time,” and the narrator is the scorpion
goddess Serqet. Her monologue forms part of a healing spell, but it is composed
in an excellent literary style.19 As the story occurs in few sources, it cannot be
seen as a very important part of the mythical cycle, but the names of the sun
god recorded in the story reflect the kind of theological speculation found in
New Kingdom hymns to the creator. Gaining power over a supernatural being
by discovering its secret “true name” is a constant theme of Egyptian magical
and funerary texts and a common motif in the folktales of many cultures.
The True Name of Ra. The story begins with a statement by Serqet that the
creator “made heaven, earth, the waters, the breath of life, gods, people, small
and large cattle, reptiles, birds, and fishes.” Deities and people were both ruled
by the creator in his identity of Ra. He appeared in many forms and was known
by many names, but none of these was his true name. This name was concealed
in his stomach to prevent any hostile force from using it against him.
Only one deity dared to challenge Ra’s authority; that was his “daughter”
Isis. She was “cleverer than millions of gods.” She knew everything in heaven
and earth except the name of Ra. So she “plotted in her heart how to discover
the name of this noble god.” Isis’s opportunity comes when Ra starts to show
symptoms of old age, such as a drooping mouth and a tendency to drool. Isis
finds some of Ra’s saliva on the ground. She mixes it with earth and shapes it
into a snake. When the snake comes to life, she leaves it at a crossroads where
Ra passes every day.
When Ra next walks this road to view his creation, he is bitten by the un
seen snake. The poison burns like fire, and Ra gives a terrible scream that dis
Mythical Time Lines 69



turbs all the gods. As the snake
has come from the body of Ra
just like the Eye goddess, it pre
sumably has the same terrible
fiery poison as that goddess’s
snake form. At first, Ra is un
able to speak because his lips
are trembling and his limbs are
shaking. “The poison had over
whelmed his body like the in
undation overwhelms every
thing in its path.” Then the
sun god takes courage and ex
plains to his followers that he
has been stung by an unknown
creature, not created by him.
He summons his “children,”
the other gods, to see if any of
them can help him.
The gods are distraught at
the catastrophe that has over
taken Ra. Isis pretends to be as
bewildered and upset as the
rest. She asks Ra if one of his
own creations has rebelled
against him and promises to
destroy the attacker with her
powerful magic. Ra then tells
again how he was stung while
walking through the Two
Lands (Egypt) because “my
heart longed to see what I have
created.” He gives a vivid de
scription of the symptoms of snake bite. He feels colder than water and hotter
than fire; he is drenched with sweat and has lost his sight.
Isis claims that she can help if Ra will tell her his name. Ra describes him
self by many phrases that define his role as creator. He is the one who created
the physical world, he “made the bull for the cow so sex came into being.” He
is the one who causes the Nile to flood. He is the one who divided the year into
seasons and the day into hours. He ends by proclaiming that he is called Khepri

in the morning, Ra at noon, and Atum in the evening, but none of these is his
true name; so the pain continues.
Isis insists that she cannot heal him without knowing his true name. When
the pain gets worse, Ra gives in and whispers his name to Isis. The actual true
name is not given in the story.20 Ra tells Isis that when the time comes, she can
pass on the secret to Horus, the son who will be born to her. Then Isis recites
magical words that drive the poison out of Ra and destroy it. The mention of
Horus at the end of the narrative provides a justification for the behavior of Isis.
By gaining knowledge of the secret name to pass on to her son, she is ensuring
that Horus will become the ruler of Egypt. The Egyptian audience for this story
would know that her marvelous child, Horus, is himself destined to be poi
soned in a similar way by a close relative and only cured through the secret
knowledge of one of the gods.
Isis was not the only goddess to act against her “father,” the creator sun
god. Isis acted in a secret manner, but the goddess known as the Eye of Ra
openly defied his authority. The story of the quarrel between the solar eye and
her father and its eventual resolution is sometimes known as the myth of the
Distant Goddess.
The Distant Goddess. As described earlier, the Sole Eye was a separable active
force even when the creator was still inert in the primeval waters. The Eye was
sometimes treated as a female form of the sun god, but she was also called the
“daughter of Ra.” Various important goddesses were associated with this role,
most commonly Bastet, Hathor, Mut, Sekhmet, Tefnut, and Wadjyt. For reasons
that are rarely stated, the Eye goddess becomes angry and uncontrollable and re
fuses to stay with her father, Ra. Originally, this may only have been thought to
happen when the Eye returned with Shu and Tefnut. Later versions of the myth
seem to relate to the period when the world and humanity were well established.
In these versions, the Eye goes to a distant realm, sometimes identified
with the Nubian or Libyan deserts. There she rages in her terrible leonine form,
destroying everything she meets. Ra is left vulnerable to his enemies, so he
sends out one or more of the gods to persuade his daughter to return. This is a
dangerous undertaking because the fiery power of the solar eye is stronger than
all other deities.
In some versions the chosen divine messenger is Onuris (Inhur). Onuris
was a hunter god whose name means “the one who brings back the distant
one.” The Onuris myth is only known from scattered allusions. It seems that as
the most powerful and cunning of hunters, Onuris is able to track down and
subdue the solar lioness. He brings her back to Egypt and is rewarded with mar
riage to the lion goddess.
Mythical Time Lines 71



Other texts name Shu as the one who goes to persuade his sister-consort
Tefnut to return. A reference to Shu in Coffin Texts spell 75 as having “pacified
her who is in the middle of her rage” may allude to this mythical role. Thoth
sometimes accompanies Shu or undertakes the mission on his own.21 As “the
heart and tongue” of the gods, Thoth uses wise words to appease the dangerous
goddess.
Several versions of an elaborate literary treatment of this myth were cur
rent in the late first millennium BCE. In the longest of these, Hathor-Tefnut is
roaming the distant southern desert in the form of a “Nubian cat.” Thoth dis
guises himself as a dog-faced baboon to approach the angry goddess. He alter
nately harangues and cajoles her. Thoth lectures her about her duty and dignity
as the daughter of Ra. He tells her about the desolate and gloomy state that
Egypt has fallen into without her bright presence. He paints word pictures of
the delicious food offerings and the singing and dancing she will receive in the
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology

temples of Egypt if she returns. Thoth also tells her a series of entertaining ani
mal fables on the theme of cosmic justice.
The best known of these is the story of the lion and the mouse.22 It tells of
a mighty lion who (like the Distant Goddess) inspired fear wherever he went.
One day, in the remote mountains where the lion lived, he met a panther suffer
ing horrible wounds. The lion asked the panther who had pulled out his fur and
ripped his skin. The panther replied that it was “Man.” The lion did not know
what men were, but he resolved to find Man and punish him.
On his journey he encountered chained horses, donkeys, cows, and oxen.
The lion asked them who had imprisoned them, and they all replied “Man.”
Then the lion found a bear and another lion who had both been tricked and tor
tured by Man. The lion vowed that he would make Man suffer the same pain he
had inflicted on all these animals.
As the lion searched for Man, a tiny mouse ran under his paw. The mouse
begged the lion not to crush him. He pointed out that he was too small to sat
isfy the lion’s appetite. The mouse promised that if the lion gave him his life,
he would one day save the lion in return. The lion laughed at this, because he
thought that no one was powerful enough to endanger him, but he let the
mouse go anyway.
The lion did not realize how cunning Man was. A hunter had set a net over a
hidden pit. The lion fell into the trap and was caught in the meshes of the net and
bound with leather straps. He struggled for hours but could not free himself. In
the middle of the night, the little mouse came and told the lion that he had come
to repay him for the gift of life, because “it is beautiful to do good.” The mouse
gnawed through the straps and ropes until the lion was free. Then the mouse
climbed into the lion’s mane, and they went back to the mountains together.
The implication of this and the other fables is that if the destructive anger
of the solar eye is not balanced by the justice and truth personified by Maat, the
world will slide into chaos. The volatile goddess is not easy to persuade. One
vivid passage describes how she becomes angry with Thoth and transforms
from a cat into the terrible solar lioness whose eyes and nostrils spurt flame.
Then “Thoth jumped like a frog, he quivered like a grasshopper.”
Eventually, Thoth lures the goddess back toward Egypt. On the borders she
is greeted with music and dancing that help to transform her into the “beautiful
of face.” This is the first of a series of benevolent forms of the Eye goddess.23 An
obscure passage deals with an attack on the goddess while she is sleeping.
Thoth wakes her in time, and the forces of chaos are defeated. Eventually the
goddess reaches Memphis, the capital of Egypt, where she is transformed into
Hathor of the Southern Sycamore and joyfully reunited with her father. She is

needed to defend the creator sun god from his enemies. Chief among these, as
in the fable of the lion and the mouse, is “Man.”
In many mythologies, the gods make several attempts at creating people be
fore they are satisfied. Such myths usually involve the destruction of the unsat
isfactory part of humanity. As early as the Middle Kingdom, there are references
to the creator deciding to destroy humanity and abandon the earth.24 The fullest
version of this myth is given in a text known as the Book of the Heavenly Cow,
which is inscribed in five royal tombs of the New Kingdom. The earliest copy is
on one of the large golden shrines surrounding the coffins of King
Tutankhamun.25
The Destruction of Humanity. After Ra had become the ruler of both gods
and men,
Humanity plotted against him, while his majesty, may he live, may he prosper,
may he be healthy, had grown old. His bones became silver, his flesh became
gold, his hair true lapis-lazuli. When his majesty saw how humanity was plotting
against him, his majesty said to his followers “Summon for me, my Eye, Shu,
Tefnut, Geb, Nut and the father and mothers who were with me when I was in
the primeval waters, as well as the god Nun.26 Let him bring his followers with
him, but bring them secretly in case the humans see and their hearts escape.
The gods and goddesses all came and asked Ra to speak. He told them,
“Humanity, which came into being from my Eye, is plotting against me. Advise
me what you would do about it.” Nun and the other deities advise Ra to send
his Eye against the rebels. “No Eye is more able to smite them. Let it go down
as Hathor.”
The guilty ones among humanity flee into the desert through fear of Ra,
but Hathor slaughters them and wades in their blood. When she returns to Ra,
she tells him that she has “overpowered humanity and it was sweet to my
heart.” Ra replies, “I shall have power over them as king by culling them.”
Thus, says the text, “the Powerful One came into being.”27
The goddess intends to continue her slaughter the next day, but for reasons
that are not explained, Ra has changed his mind. He summons messengers who
can travel as fast as shadows and sends them to fetch a large quantity of a red
mineral. Then he orders the Side-Lock Wearer in Heliopolis, a title of the high
priest of Ra, to grind up the mineral while his maid servants mash barley to make
beer. They make 7,000 jars of beer and add the red mineral to it to make the beer
look like blood. Ra has the beer taken to the place where the goddess plans to de
stroy humanity. Before dawn Ra pours the red beer out until the fields are flooded
to a depth of “three palms.”28 When the goddess arrives at dawn, she sees her own

beautiful reflection in the flood. “She drank and it delighted her heart. She came
back drunk without having noticed humanity.” Ra welcomed her back and from
that day on alcohol was drunk during the festivals of Hathor.29
It is not clear whether Ra took pity on humanity after the first day’s slaugh
ter or whether he only wanted to save the portion of humanity that he regarded
as innocent. The latter is probably implied by the fact that the people killed on
the first day have fled to the desert, part of the realm of chaos. These people be
come Enemies of Ra, a group that is shown in the Underworld Books being hor
ribly tortured in the afterlife. The second day’s slaughter is to take place in
fields, presumably in the agricultural land of the Nile valley, usually associated
with the realm of order.
The goddess Maat was sometimes said to have been sent down to live
among humanity. She would stay with a virtuous person even after their death,
but in times of general disorder and strife she would withdraw. Humanity was
sometimes divided into the Followers of Horus (good) and the Followers of Seth
(bad). This division appears to justify the ruthless destruction of many humans
by the gods. A ritual drama inscribed on the walls of the temple of Horus of
Edfu describes a rebellion by the people of Nubia in the 363rd year of Ra’s reign.
The rebels are tricked into killing each other, and their leader, Seth, is be
headed. A myth in Papyrus Jumilhac tells how the goddess Isis transforms her
self into a form of Hathor, slaughters all the Followers of Seth with fire, and
wades in their blood. This might seem to be a direct borrowing from the Book
of the Heavenly Cow, but it should probably be seen as an example of a repeat
ing pattern of events.
In the Book of the Heavenly Cow, even though the rebels have been de
feated, the world can never be the same again. Ra announces that he is sick and
weary, and he cannot bear to remain on earth. Nun, the god of the primeval wa
ters, orders Shu and Nut to help Ra. Nut is transformed into a cow, and Ra rides
away on her back. As the earth darkens, some of humanity beg Ra to stay, and
they shoot at his enemies. This, says the text, was how death came into being.
From this point on, humanity has to fight and die to maintain the divine order.
Nut carries Ra up into the heavens, and the single creator god transforms
himself into many heavenly bodies. He creates the fields of paradise for the spir
its of the dead. Nut “began to tremble because of the height,” so Ra creates the
Heh gods who live in twilight. Shu and the Heh gods support the body of Nut.
Then Ra tells Geb to warn the powerful serpents that live under the earth not
to abuse their magic because he will still look down on them. Ra puts Osiris in
charge of humanity and calls “the moon of Thoth” into being, so that Thoth
can rule the night sky as his deputy. This begins the era when the world was
ruled by a series of lesser gods.

Period of Rule by Other Gods
Summary: After the creator had withdrawn, the earth was ruled by a series of
gods. Violent struggles sometimes accompanied the transfer of power from one
generation to the next. Osiris, son of Geb, was chosen as king of Egypt and
ruled with his sister, Isis. Their ideal reign was brought to an end by the jeal
ousy of their brother, Seth. This god and his followers murdered Osiris and mu
tilated his body. With the aid of magic, Isis was able to revive the body of Osiris
long enough for her to conceive a son. Isis fled to the marshes where she gave
birth to Horus.
Both the child Horus and the body of Osiris were frequently attacked by
Seth and his followers. Horus survived to challenge Seth’s right to rule Egypt.
The two gods fought each other in many different ways. The Eye of Horus was
damaged by Seth, and the testicles of Seth were damaged by Horus. Thoth re
stored the damaged Eye, and eventually Horus prevailed. He became king of
Egypt and was reconciled with Seth. Horus performed rites that helped Osiris to
rise again as king of the Underworld. In time, Horus was succeeded as king of
Egypt by a series of gods and demigods.
The Reigns of Shu, Geb, and Osiris. Egyptian king lists trace the ancestry of
historical kings back into a mythical age. According to Manetho’s history of
Egypt, this age lasted for over 11,000 years.30 The order of the rulers in this di
vine dynasty was not fixed. Creator deities such as Ptah or Ra sometimes begin
the list of divine ancestors, but either Shu or Geb may be named as the first
god-kings of Egypt. Other sources treat Osiris or his son Horus as the first
Egyptian kings. In stories such as Astarte and the Sea (see “Astarte” in “Deities,
Themes, and Concepts”) and the Two Brothers, the Great Ennead seem to rule
as a group. The idea that each generation of the Ennead must have ruled in turn
is probably a later rationalization of mythical history to fit an established pat
tern of royal succession.
Hymns to Shu in the Harris Magical Papyrus hail this god as the eldest son
and heir of Ra and the king of Upper and Lower Egypt. The myth of Shu’s sepa
ration of his children Geb and Nut to create the cosmos seems at some point to
have been reinterpreted in more human terms of sexual jealousy and father-son
rivalry. The latent hostility between Shu and his son, Geb, is made explicit in a
text of the fourth century BCE.31 Like Ra before him, Shu has to contend with
the forces of chaos and with rebels against the divine order. Geb challenges
Shu’s leadership, which causes the latter to withdraw from the world. Geb ei
ther rapes his mother, Tefnut, or takes her as his chief queen; thus he separates
Shu from his sister-wife, as Shu had previously separated Geb from his sister

76



wife. That Geb’s claim to the throne is disputed is clear from an episode in
which he tries to put on his father’s headdress and is burned by its serpent
guardian. Eventually, Geb is accepted as ruler and has to rally his forces to de
fend Egypt against the “children of Apophis.”
More usually, Geb was regarded as the legitimate ruler of everything on
earth. In the Book of the Heavenly Cow, Geb seems to be the chosen heir of the
departing sun god. The warnings in this text about the need to control “the
snakes who are in the earth and the water” suggest that Geb’s reign was not
thought of as a peaceful one. In the fragmentary tale of Astarte and the Sea, a
sea monster opposes the gods and exacts tribute from Geb and Nut. A few scat
tered references allude to a myth in which Osiris tries to seize power from his
father, Geb.32
When Geb passed on the throne to his eldest son, Osiris, it might be logical
to assume that he withdrew under the earth as Ra and Shu had withdrawn to
the sky. There is, however, no clear account of this happening. After the reign

idealized king of Egypt. Relief in the temple of Behbeit el-Hagar. (Courtesy of Geraldine Pinch)



of Osiris, Geb takes on the role of judge in the Divine Tribunal of the gods. This
Tribunal usually seems to meet in Egypt itself rather than in the underworld.
In most Egyptian sources, the reign of Osiris is only described in the
vaguest terms. Osiris is the good king, and Isis is his queen and chief protector.
The oldest references to Osiris link him with the astral or the funerary spheres.
By the end of the Old Kingdom it became customary for all kings to be regarded
as a form of Osiris after they died. The idea that Osiris had once reigned on
earth as these kings did probably postdates this development.
When Greek writers began to take an interest in the myths of Osiris, they
recreated Osiris and Isis as the great “culture heroes” who taught agriculture
and crafts to the peoples of the world and established law and religion. Plutarch
claimed that Osiris had civilized the whole world, a way of acknowledging the
cultural debt that the Greeks felt they owed to Egypt. For the Egyptians, “cul
ture heroes” were largely unnecessary, since most aspects of civilization were
already implicit in the creator’s establishment of maat.
The Murder of Osiris. The death of Osiris is one of the most important events
in Egyptian myth and one of the most obscure. There are no detailed accounts of
the murder until the late first millennium BCE, and even these occur in descrip
tions of Egyptian religion by foreigners. In the Pyramid Texts, Seth is named as
the attacker of Osiris and, by implication, as his killer. In Pyramid Texts spell
477, Seth claims to be taking revenge for a kick that Osiris had given him. Later
tales loosely based on the Osiris myth make sexual jealousy a motive for the
falling out between the two brothers. Some Egyptologists have argued that Osiris
was originally a god of the dead rather than a god who died,33 but once the con
cept of Osiris’s death was established, a slayer had to be identified.
Many Egyptian texts imply that Seth took the form of a dangerous animal,
such as a wild bull, a wild ass, or a crocodile, to kill his brother in a lonely
place. The Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts allude to Osiris being cast down
or trampled and his body thrown in the Nile. In later times it was often stated
that Osiris died by drowning. Being a god, Osiris probably had to be killed in
several different ways to render him permanently dead.
A belief developed that the attack on Osiris was a unique and terrible
crime, carried out on the “night of the great storm.” Yet in theological terms,
his was a necessary death. By dying, Osiris becomes ruler of the underworld and
a source of life for others. A remarkable dialogue in Book of the Dead spell 175
has Osiris complain about his sad fate to Atum. The creator god replies that
Osiris has been favored beyond all others. He has been granted an eternal king
dom in the “land of silence,” whereas his son will be the perpetual ruler in the
land of the living. Many Egyptian thinkers tried to make sense of death by mak

78



ing something positive out of the death of Osiris, but it is the loneliness and de
spair of Osiris that is the most memorable element in this dialogue.
Early allusions to the death of Osiris all imply that it took place in a remote
spot with no witnesses. Classical writers change this into a public assassination.
Diodorus Siculus (whose visit to Egypt is described in “Introduction”) says that
Osiris was butchered by “his brother Typhon” (Seth). Typhon divided the body
into twenty-six pieces and gave one piece to each of his followers to keep.
Plutarch relates that in the twenty-eighth year of Osiris’s reign, Typhon
(Seth) and his followers plotted against him. Typhon secretly obtained the exact
measurements of his brother’s body and had a beautiful chest made to fit it.34
Typhon displayed the chest at a feast and promised to give it to whoever could
fit inside it. Seth’s seventy-two followers all tried the chest, but it did not fit
any of them. Finally Osiris lay down in the chest. As soon as he did so, the con
spirators bolted on the lid and sealed the chest with molten lead. Then they
threw it into a branch of the Nile, which carried the chest out into the
Mediterranean sea.
Isis was away in the city of Coptos, but she heard a terrible lament from
the deities of the northern marshes and knew that Osiris was dead. She
searched Egypt for the body and followed sightings of the chest all the way to
Byblos in the Lebanon.35 There the chest had grown into a marvelous tree that
the king of Byblos had felled and made into a pillar in his palace. Isis stayed in
the palace for a while in disguise before declaring herself and demanding the pil
lar containing her husband’s coffin. She brought the coffin back to the Delta,
but one night Typhon found it. He tore the body into fourteen parts and scat
tered them throughout Egypt. Isis searched for the parts and buried each in the
place where she found it. The penis of Osiris had been eaten by fish, so she had
to replace this with a model.36 Some parts of Plutarch’s narrative have few par
allels in Egyptian sources, but from the Pyramid Texts onward, Isis is presented
as a grieving wife searching the country for her murdered husband.
Isis is usually helped by her sister, Nephthys, and both goddesses may take
bird form to carry out the search. When Isis finds the body or its parts, she re
stores them to wholeness. This originally seems to have meant that Isis was
able to reverse the putrefaction of the flesh so feared by the Egyptians.
By the end of the second millennium BCE, the idea of the mutilation of the
body by Seth was firmly established. This concept was greatly elaborated in the
Ptolemaic and Roman Periods. Lists on temple walls mention fourteen or six
teen parts of the body of Osiris buried at various sacred sites. This was some
times increased to forty-two parts, one for each district of Egypt.
The vigil of Isis and Nephthys as they watch over and lament the body of
Osiris is one of the keynote images of Egyptian culture. It is unusual in showing
Mythical Time Lines 79



deities experiencing strong emotion, even though this emotion is conveyed by
formalized gestures of mourning, such as beating the brow.
Isis already knows that she is destined to bear a child who will be king. In
order to bring this about, she has to revive the sexual powers of Osiris, just as
the Hand Goddess aroused the penis of the creator to create the first life. A re
lief at Abydos shows the all-important moment when Isis in bird form uses her
wings to fan the breath of life into Osiris. Hymns celebrate the exaltation of Isis
when she knows that she has conceived the child who “is king even in the
egg.” Summoned by her cry of triumph, other deities acknowledge and bow
down to the unborn Horus.
At some point, the myth of the death of Osiris and the restoration of his
body by Isis was combined with the cult of Anubis as protector of the dead and
overseer of funerary rites. All aspects of an Egyptian funeral were given mythi
cal precedents in the mummification, entombment, and revivification of Osiris.
A number of myths, particularly in Papyrus Jumilhac, deal with attempts by
Seth and his followers to destroy or despoil the body of Osiris. The corpse is
successfully protected by the magic of Thoth and by the ferocity of Anubis in
his role as guardian of the tomb.
The Birth and Childhood of Horus. After a pregnancy of ten months, Isis
gives birth to a son called Horus. This god was often referred to as Horus, son of
Isis, to distinguish him from Horus the Elder, the sky god whom some tradi
tions made a brother of Osiris and Seth. These two gods had distinct mytholo
gies but were often treated as aspects of the same deity.
The place of Horus’s birth is said to be in the Delta, usually in the region of
Chemmis. To evade his enemies, the divine child was hidden inside a papyrus
thicket or on a floating island. This “nest of Horus” is one of the few mythical
places that is commonly shown in Egyptian art. Temple wall scenes depict
kings in the role of the Horus child in the marshes being washed or suckled by a
cow. This cow can be identified with a number of goddesses but most often
with Hathor, whose name literally means Mansion of Horus. She seems to have
been regarded as the mother of Horus the Elder and the wet nurse or foster
mother of Horus the Younger.37 Many other deities were imagined as protecting
the divine child whenever Isis was forced to be absent.
In literary spells these deities can be changed into the humble human inhabi
tants of the marsh. The theme of the poisoning of the infant Horus was a common
one in magical texts (see “Horus the Child” and “Serqet” in “Deities, Themes,
and Concepts”). Several spells start with Isis lamenting because her child has been
poisoned. The source of the poison is usually the bite of an earth-dwelling snake.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
80



Since destroying your enemies by
sending a dangerous animal after
them was a standard Egyptian curse,
Seth should probably be regarded as
the instigator of the attack. In one
spell, Isis appeals to her mother,
Nut, and her father, Geb, the con
troller of the earth snakes. In others
she challenges the creator sun god to
heal her innocent child. The creator
sends one of his manifestations or
attendant deities to drive the poison
out of Horus, to the great joy of Isis.
The Metternich Stela and
other magical stelae of this type
show Horus as a naked child tri
umphing over all kinds of danger
ous creatures. Some of these crea
tures, such as the oryx (a species of
desert-dwelling antelope), were par
ticularly associated with Seth. In a
few magical texts it is the foolish
ness or greed of the young Horus
that is to blame for his plight. In
one spell, the young god suffers
from a terrible stomachache after
naughtily eating a sacred fish and
has to appeal to his mother for
help.38 Horus is still an impetuous
youth when he takes up the strug
gle to avenge the death of his father
and gain the crown of Egypt.
The Struggles of Horus and Seth.
Some sources give Seth a reign of
hundreds of years; others imply an
interregnum, during which Seth
and Horus struggle to establish who
is fit to rule Egypt. Seth is consis

figure of Horus the Child overcoming evil animals
and reptiles. (Chicago Oriental Institute Museum)



tently portrayed as sexually abusing the young Horus. This may be implied in
the Pyramid Texts by the frequent references to the mutilation of the eye of
Horus and the testicles of Seth.39 The injury to Seth is sometimes interpreted as
castration and sometimes merely as losing the “seed” from his testicles.
In the Middle Kingdom Kahun Papyrus, Horus complains to Isis that Seth
has been admiring his buttocks and wants to sleep with him. Isis advises her
son to tell Seth that he dares not sleep with him unless Seth shares some of his
magical strength. When Seth has agreed to make Horus stronger, Horus must
pretend to let Seth have his way but take care to catch all Seth’s semen in his
fingers.
The Middle Kingdom text breaks off at this point, but a version of the story
is found in the New Kingdom Contendings of Horus and Seth. In this text,
Horus catches Seth’s semen in his hand and brings it to his mother. Isis cuts off
the polluted hand and throws it in the river (see “Sobek” in “Deities, Themes,
and Concepts”). After making Horus a new hand, she uses her own hand to give
Horus an erection and catches his semen in a pot. In this episode Isis is appro
priately playing the role of the Hand Goddess who combines with the penis of
the creator to make the first life.
Isis spreads the semen of Horus on the leaves of some lettuces in Seth’s gar
den. When Seth eats the lettuces he becomes pregnant by Horus and gives birth
to a radiant disk through the top of his head. Thoth takes the disk and places it
on the brow of Horus as a sign that he is the true heir of the creator sun god.40
A cluster of myths deal with the mutilation of the eye or eyes of Horus (see
“Eyes of Horus” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). In Horus’s sky falcon
form, his eyes could be regarded as the sun and the moon or as the morning and
evening stars. References in the Pyramid Texts to the eye of Horus being made
small by the finger of Seth may relate to lunar phenomena (see “The Egyptian
Year” under “Cyclical Time” later in this chapter). Later texts, such as Book of
the Dead spell 17, imply that the eye was torn out and swallowed or broken
into pieces by Seth.
In some versions, both eyes of Horus are blinded or torn out. Although Seth
is the aggressor, he is sometimes said to be punishing Horus for mutilating or
raping his mother, Isis.41 In the Contendings of Horus and Seth, Horus becomes
angry with his mother for helping Seth and cuts off her head. One myth has
Thoth heal Isis by giving her a cow’s head to replace the head that Horus has
taken away.42 The Ennead decrees that Horus should be punished. Seth rips out
the eyes of Horus and buries them on a mountainside, where they grow into lo
tuses. In this story, the eyes of Horus are restored by his foster mother, Hathor.
In other versions he is healed by Isis or Thoth. The latter is particularly associ
ated with finding the eye of Horus when it is lost or putting it back together
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
82



when it has been torn into many pieces. This myth mirrors the mutilation and
reunion of the body of Osiris.
Many references to the contests between the Two Fighters imply that
Horus and Seth were gods of equal strength. These probably reflect the tradition
that Horus and Seth were brothers. Other versions adapt to the concept of Seth
fighting with his younger and weaker nephew by making Horus win through
guile. In the Contendings of Horus and Seth, the two gods compete by turning
themselves into hippopotami and seeing who can stay under water longer. Later
Horus challenges Seth to a race in stone boats. Horus’s boat is only wood
painted to look like stone. Seth tries to make a real stone boat that sinks as
soon as it is launched.
The combat between the two gods was reenacted on temple lakes. By the
first millennium BCE, the duel had become a battle between opposing sides with
the Followers of Horus fighting the Followers of Seth. In the sacred play the
Triumph of Horus, Horus pursues Seth by boat and attacks him with harpoons.
The Triumph of Horus. The Two Fighters disturbed the whole cosmos with
their quarrel. The case needed to be brought before a Divine Tribunal so that
right could be established and a peace made. This Divine Tribunal is usually
headed by Geb, though the ultimate authority is the creator sun god. The
Tribunal is said to assemble in various places, but most often in Heliopolis.
Myths deal with two different trials. In what is probably the older tradition,
it is Osiris who is the plaintiff against Seth. Sometimes the body of Osiris is
said to be present in court supported by Isis and Nephthys. Seth tries to justify
his violence toward his brother but fails. Osiris is vindicated as “one true of
voice,” a term that came to be applied to all the virtuous dead. Only then, some
sources imply, could Osiris complete his metamorphosis into the ruler of the
underworld. Osiris is not resurrected in the sense of returning to life as an indi
vidual on earth. He enters into a new kind of existence in a separate realm that
most beings can only reach by dying.
In some accounts Seth is punished by being forced to carry the body of
Osiris to its final resting place. While performing this humiliating task, Seth
can be envisaged as a boat, a carrying chair, a bull, or an ox. Even after Osiris
became ruler of the dead, his corpse was preserved in a tomb, where it remained
a source of great power.
In a parallel tradition, the disputants are Horus and Seth. Various deities
put the case for each side. Osiris is sometimes represented as sending messages
from the underworld to support his son’s case. Osiris ominously reminds the
other gods that only he can create the crops that feed them. Seth’s claim rests
chiefly on his being the strongest of the gods, whereas Horus stresses the legiti
Mythical Time Lines 83



macy of his place in the royal succession. This argument between might and
right must have seemed topical at many crisis points in Egyptian history.
It would be natural to assume that this crucial myth would always have the
same ending, but many variations on the divine verdict are recorded. These
variations are due to the fluctuating status of Seth as a national god and to the
different contexts in which the myth might be used. The strength of Seth was
needed to defend the gods from their enemies, so it was necessary to reintegrate
the loser into the community of the gods.
In order to reconcile the Two Fighters and turn them into the Two Lords,
the Divine Tribunal divided the land between Horus and Seth. Horus got Lower
Egypt and Seth Upper Egypt, or Horus the Black Land of the Nile valley and
Seth the Red Land of the deserts. The image of Horus and Seth uniting the Two
Lands to support the ruling king was a popular one in royal art up to the end of
the New Kingdom (see Figure 46).
In the Memphite Theology and other texts, however, this division of the
kingdom is subsequently challenged, and Horus is given all of Egypt. The tale of
the Contendings of Horus and Seth, written down at a time when the cult of
Seth was particularly popular, has Seth summoned to live with Ra in the sky as
god of storms. This fits with Seth’s traditional role as a powerful protector of Ra
in his sun boat.
In versions of the myth that occur in hymns or rituals concerning Osiris,
Seth is driven out of Egypt rather than being compensated with any kind of di
vine realm. He may even be given over to Horus and Isis to be punished or exe
cuted. This is his fate in most temple texts of the first millennium BCE. At Edfu,
the triumph of Horus over Seth was celebrated with the cutting up of a hip
popotamus—the final act in the sequence of mutilations that began with the
dismemberment of Osiris (see Figure 32).
Hymns and literary accounts of the Horus and Seth conflict usually end
with a chorus of praise for the newly crowned Horus. Royal rituals and funerary
texts that are structured by episodes from the Osiris myth have a different fo
cus. Before or during his own coronation, Horus is represented as carrying out a
series of rituals for his father, Osiris, including the Opening of the Mouth and
the raising of a symbolic pillar (see “Djed Pillar” in “Deities, Themes, and
Concepts”). These acts correspond with stages in the royal funerary ritual per
formed by the heir of the deceased king to ensure that king’s survival in the af
terlife. These rites validated the royal succession by confirming Osiris in his
new role as king of the dead and Horus in his role as king of the living.
In these contexts, Osiris is represented as too weak or passive to achieve
the transformation to ruler of the underworld without his heir’s help. Here he
seems to embody the vulnerability of the Egyptian state in dangerous transi

tional periods. Other sources, such as hymns to Osiris, portray the god as hav
ing been created by Atum to be a powerful and terrifying force, the underworld
equivalent of the sun god.43 The “inertness” of Osiris is then comparable to
that of the creator before the First Time.
The “time of Horus” was made the prototype for the reign of every king.
Hymns refer to it as a time of peace and prosperity when evil and crime were
unknown. In most Egyptian king lists, the reign of Horus is followed by periods
of rule by other deities, such as Thoth and Maat. Then come nine akhu (spirits),
associated with Hierakonpolis, Buto, and Heliopolis; towns that are known to
have been important in the early history of Egypt. With these kings, and with a
series of kings of lesser status known as the Followers of Horus, myth blends
imperceptibly into history.
Period of Rule by Kings
Summary: Dynasties of gods and demigods were succeeded by dynasties of hu
man kings who acted as intermediaries between humanity and the gods. This
period corresponds with the time span of Pharaonic history. Gods and goddesses
mainly communicated with people through temple rituals, oracles, or dreams,
though deities might still be encountered beyond the boundaries of the Black
Land. Most humans could only enter the divine realm by dying, but stories
were told of priest-magicians who had the power to pass between the worlds of
the living and the dead.
The king was responsible for upholding the divine order in the world of the
living. Failure to obey the laws of maat could lead to periods of chaos. These
only ended when a new royal champion of maat arose. The gods might inter
vene in history by fathering such hero-kings.
Once the gods had withdrawn, humanity had to play an active role, through
ritual and ethical behavior, in keeping any kind of divine presence on earth.
Regular offerings and elaborate rites ensured that deities were present in statues
or sacred animals kept in temples, but their true forms were thought to be in
the divine realm.
On temple walls, kings are shown perpetually interacting with the gods,
but specific communications from a deity to an individual king are usually de
scribed as coming in the form of a dream or a portent. The best known example
is King Thutmose IV’s dream encounter with the deity manifest in the Great
Sphinx at Giza (see “Sphinx” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). Similar
dreams were occasionally recorded by private individuals of the elite class. It
was probably the ba of a person that was thought to be able to enter the divine

realm in sleep and converse with gods and spirits. Ordinary Egyptians did not
expect to meet their deities until after they had died.
Strange Encounters. Encounters between people and deities are described in
stories that use mythological themes, but these usually take place beyond the
Nile valley. In the story of the Two Brothers, it is only after the hero, Bata,
leaves Egypt for the remote Valley of the Pine that he meets the Ennead. In the
tale known as the Shipwrecked Sailor, an Egyptian survives a shipwreck in the
Red Sea and is washed ashore on a paradise island. When he makes an offering
to the gods to thank them for the food he finds on the island, a giant human
headed serpent appears.
The sailor is terrified, but the serpent promises that no harm will come to
him and that he will be reunited with his family. The serpent reveals that there
were once seventy-five snakes on the island, suggesting that he may be the cre
ator sun god who traditionally had seventy-five forms. The serpent eventually
sends the sailor back to Egypt laden with treasure but warns him that he will
never find the “island of the spirit” again.
The hero of this tale does not behave heroically in the sense of being partic
ularly strong, brave, or selfless. All the sailor does is show the proper attitude
for humans by giving thanks to the gods even in adversity and by believing the
serpent’s message of hope. In most Egyptian tales, intelligence and natural elo
quence or book learning are more admired than feats of arms or willingness to
die with honor. The main characters are often priest-magicians (see “Imhotep”
and “Magicians” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”) who deal with threats
from ghosts, demons, and foreign sorcerers by using spells, amulets, and rituals.
The ability to communicate with supernatural beings is the basis of their
power. Some stories feature magicians who are able to see the true forms of the
gods or enter the Duat while still alive, but Egyptian literature is full of warn
ings about the misuse of such powers by the magicians or their royal patrons.
Magical tales were often set in the time of famous kings, such as Djoser (c.
2667–2648 BCE) or Rameses II (1279–1213 BCE), whose reigns were sufficiently
far in the past to be imagined as an age of marvels. Nearly all Egyptian tales fea
ture some royal characters, who are not always shown in a favorable light. In
literature, kings and princes may be fallible or even cruel and lustful. In most
royal inscriptions, by contrast, kings are presented as heroes on a cosmic stage.
Kings and Gods. Each king fulfilled the creator’s plan and the judgment of the
Divine Tribunal: that Horus, son of Osiris, should always rule. Ideally, every
new king (Horus) had to succeed his father (Osiris), even if history had to be

reedited to accomplish this so that intervening reigns or lack of blood relation
ships were ignored.
Many kings claimed that they, like Horus, had been chosen to rule “while
still in the egg.” In practice, it was the inauguration rituals that turned the cho
sen heir into “the living Horus.” Since the office of kingship was so vital to the
stability of Egyptian society, interruptions in the royal succession had to be ex
plained as direct interventions by deities. The accession of individual kings
might be validated by giving them a divine parent. One such royal birth myth is
found in the inauguration inscriptions of King Horemheb (c. 1319–1307 BCE).44
Horemheb was a soldier who served under Akhenaten and Tutankhamun,
but the inscription presents his career in mythological terms. He is called the
son of Horus, Lord of Hnes: the form of the Horus worshipped in Horemheb’s
native town. Horemheb claims that his exceptional qualities were evident as
soon as he was born and that Horus of Hnes always intended that he should be
king. To bring this about, Horus takes Horemheb to Thebes and presents him to
the god Amun-Ra at Karnak and Luxor temples. Horemheb is accepted by
Amun-Ra and by his daughter, the Eye goddess, and acclaimed by a gathering of
all the gods. Horemheb is then able to restore the country and its institutions to
the way things were “in the time of Ra.”
This inscription can be interpreted as a factual account of Horemheb’s in
auguration at Thebes during the Opet Festival in the presence of statues of the
gods, but it elevates these events to the divine realm. A historical event of the
fourteenth century BCE becomes part of the repeating cycle of the acceptance of
the rightful heir by the Divine Tribunal and his restoration of harmony to
Egypt.
In the Egyptian worldview, each reign was supposed to be a successful bat
tle by the leader of the forces of order (the king or a prince representing him)
against the forces of chaos (rebels, foreigners, and dangerous creatures or natural
forces). Such victories were routinely attributed to the reigning king whether or
not they had actually taken place, so that much Egyptian history is mythical in
the modern sense of not being factually true.
Rameses II, for example, presented himself as a hero-king even though his
greatest achievement was probably the peace treaty he negotiated with the rival
Hittite empire. Scenes of his famous battle against the Hittites at Qadesh deco
rate the walls of many of the temples that he built. Conforming to the mythical
prototype of the champion of order, Rameses is shown as a gigantic figure tri
umphing over chaotic crowds of enemies. A poem that accompanies the reliefs
stresses the vulnerability of the king, however, and claims that disaster was
only averted through the intervention of the god Amun. 45
Mythical Time Lines 87



Royal, religious, and literary texts all admit the possibility that if humans
fail to obey the laws of maat, chaos can get the upper hand. Specific acts, such
as desecrating the tombs of the dead or failing to build proper homes for the
gods, are sometimes blamed for these periods of national disaster. At such
times, the gods withdraw even further from humanity, and “their sanctuaries
are empty.”
Some texts, such as the Middle Kingdom Words of Neferti or the Roman
Period Potter’s Oracle, project graphic descriptions of “a land in calamity” into
the future. The prophecy of Neferti describes a period of turmoil and misery but
ends with a vision of “a king from the south” who will overcome rebels and for
eign enemies so that “Truth will return to its proper place, with Chaos driven
outside.”46 This future was the recent past for the author of the prophecy, as the
“king from the south” was Amenemhet I, a commoner who founded the
Twelfth Dynasty.
This alternation between order and chaos was seen as the pattern of human
history, but a few writings allowed the possibility that one day the slide into
chaos would not be stopped by a royal hero, humanity would be totally de
stroyed, and the world would end.

Return to Chaos
Summary: The end of the world will come about because of quarrels among
deities or rebellions by humanity. The creator will become weary, and the world
will return into the dark primeval waters from which it came.
In Book of the Dead spell 175, Atum complains to Thoth about “the chil
dren of Nut,” a term that can refer to the fourth generation of the Great Ennead
or to the gods in general. The children of Nut are accused of making rebellion,
war, and carnage and of dividing up the wholeness of creation. Thoth, who was
in charge of fixing the length of all creatures’ lives, decrees that their years will
be cut short.
In the Tale of the Shipwrecked Sailor, the serpent deities are suddenly de
stroyed by fire. Only the great serpent (the creator) and his little daughter (the Eye
goddess/Maat) survive the holocaust. The serpent god warns the sailor that when
he leaves, the “island of the spirit” will sink beneath the sea. This evokes an im
age of the Primeval Mound, the place of creation, being covered by the nun again.
In Coffin Texts spell 1130, after the creator has described the gifts he has
given to humanity, he goes on to say that after millions of years he will become
one with Osiris. When this happens, there will no longer be a division between
life and death, and everything on earth will go through a period of catastrophic
change. In Book of the Dead spell 175, Atum declares that after millions of
years he will destroy everything that he has made “and the land will return into
the Deep, into the Flood, as it was before (creation).” A spell in the Harris
Magical Papyrus has the magician claim that he can, like the creator, cause the
earth to go down into the primeval waters and the south to become north.
This strain of thought seems to be reflected in the Roman Period Hermetic
text known as the Asclepius. In this dialogue, Hermes Trismegistus warns that
in the “old age of the world” the gods will go back to heaven, Egypt will be de
serted, and “all the people will die.”47 References to an absolutely final destruc
tion are rare in Egyptian or Egyptian-based texts. Even the Asclepius promises
that the supreme god will remake the world. The eschatology of Egypt is most
truly represented by the cycles of destruction and renewal expounded in the
New Kingdom Underworld Books. Many of the events from this linear time line
recur in cyclical time.
CYCLICAL TIME
The Egyptian universe remained eternally the same only through constant
change in the form of cycles of decay, death, and rebirth. The Ouroboros, a snake

swallowing its own tail,
was an Egyptian image
adopted by many other
cultures as a symbol of
eternity. It signified the
capacity of the universe to
perpetually renew itself,
so that every end could
also be a beginning.
The Egyptian Year
The great events of Egyp
tian myth could be treated
either as things that hap
pened once in the re
mote past or as things that
needed to happen over and
over again. The inaugura
tion of a king, which ide
ally took place at New
Year, reenacted the creation of the world and the reign of the sun god as well as
the establishment of “the living Horus” on the throne of his father.48 Each year of
a king’s reign was seen as mirroring the great cycle of the creation, decay, and re
newal of the cosmos. An annual renewal of kingship ceremony at Thebes seems
to have involved a reenactment of a vital stage in the process of creation: the
union between the creator and the Hand goddess.49 After thirty years, the length
of a generation, the king had to undergo a much more elaborate renewal process
to identify himself once again with the life-giving youthful forms of the creator
and the sun god.50
The last month of the year was feared as a time when the gods seemed to
be punishing humanity as they had after the rebellion against the sun god (see
“Sekhmet” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). The new year began with the
coming of the inundation. By the Ptolemaic Period, the first Nile flood was said
to have been caused by the return of the Distant Goddess from Nubia. Every
year, the fearsome goddess had to be persuaded to return home and take on a
benevolent form as she reached the southern border of Egypt. Kiosk-shrines
built on the water’s edge were decorated with comical figures of dwarfs or ani

mals dancing and playing musical instruments to pacify the goddess and wel
come the inundation (see Figure 14).
Alternatively, the Nile flood could be seen as the tears that Isis wept every
year for her murdered husband or as the efflux from the decaying body of Osiris
(see “Osiris” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). During the flood season,
Egypt resembled the nun again. When the floods began to recede, the land ap
peared to rise up like the Primeval Mound, and the fields could be planted. The
growth cycle of food crops (particularly wheat and barley) was linked to the
myth of Osiris. The scything down of the grain and its trampling and winnow
ing were equated with the murder and dismemberment of the “good god.” The
sprouting of the seed that began the next agricultural cycle was celebrated as a
resurrection for Osiris. There were annual festivals in which corn mummies
miniature figures of Osiris filled with mud and seeds—were planted in sacred
areas and watered till they sprouted.51 These ceremonies were not just a re
membrance of long-ago events; the death and renewal of Osiris were seen as
archetypal acts that maintained the cosmos.
The mutilation and dismemberment of Osiris could also be linked to the
lunar calendar (see under “Moon” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). The
full moon could represent both the complete body of Osiris and the complete
eye of his son, Horus. Each month as the moon waned, the body of Osiris and
the Eye of Horus were divided. Evil seemed to triumph, until the waxing of the
moon “completed” these two symbols of beneficent power again. Periodic
eclipses of the moon were explained by myths such as that of Seth taking the
form of a black boar to swallow the eye of Horus and being forced to expel it
again. Regular astronomical events such as the appearance of the morning star
or the heliacal rising of Sirius also feature in Egyptian myth (see “Stars and
Planets” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts”), but by far the most significant
heavenly phenomenon was the daily rising and setting of the sun.
The Solar Cycle
The apparent movement of the sun across the sky was seen both as a life cycle
and as a journey. The daily life cycle of the sun was more an extended metaphor
than a narrative. The sun was said to be born each morning from the womb of
the sky goddess, Nut. At dawn the sun was a child—a daily repetition of the
emergence of the sun child during the First Time. At noon, the sun reached the
peak of his strength and could be portrayed as a triumphant falcon. By evening
he was an old man, virtually the only god to be shown as old. The common
Mythical Time Lines 91



identification of the evening sun as Atum linked it with the myth of the creator
growing weary and letting the world sink back into the nun. Sunset was equiva
lent to death, and the sun’s flesh and soul passed into the underworld. After
moving through the underworld reviving its inhabitants with his light, the sun
would be reborn. Each sunrise was a new beginning for the cosmos.
In early times, this cycle could be described in more brutal terms.52 In the
evening, the sun god died by being eaten by his mother, the sky goddess, and
was replaced by a multitude of stars. In the morning, the reborn sun god ate all
the star gods, staining the sky with their blood (the redness of dawn) and ab
sorbing their power. The one god became many and the many gods became one,
so life came out of death.
Other sources envisaged the sun god in an eternal voyage across the skies
above and below the earth. At sunset, the Day Boat of the sun left the upper sky
to be replaced by the barques for the moon and the stars (see “Boats” in
“Deities, Themes, and Concepts”). The Night Boat carrying the sun god was
towed on water and over sand through the twelve regions of the underworld.

Just as the creator had to overcome darkness and chaos to create the world, the
sun and his defenders had to subdue the monsters that embodied darkness and
chaos. Just as the creator made deities and people in the First Time and gave
them life, the Night Sun gave new life to all the beings in the Duat. In the
fourth hour of the night, the sleeping dead were revived by the sun god and ex
perienced a lifetime in his presence. Thus the reign of the sun god, the lost
golden age of Egyptian myth, was reenacted every night. The fate of the human
dead was locked into the solar cycle.
The Journey of the Soul
Egyptian concepts of the afterlife are strikingly diverse.53 The Beautiful West
could be seen as a place of joyful reunions or as a state of terrifying isolation.
Death was regarded both as a unique event and as part of the continuous pro
cess of decay and renewal. There was no promise of eternal peace for the
Egyptian dead. The afterlife was full of dangers and difficulties to be overcome,
a belief that probably reflected the experience of life of the average Ancient
Egyptian.
After death each individual faced a journey through the underworld to
reach the presence of one of the gods who could grant eternal life. The deceased
would find themselves in an eerie landscape of rivers, deserts, and lakes of fire,
inhabited by demons and monsters. The adventures of the soul in this land
scape are similar to the fairy tales of other cultures, but the prize to be won was
not a precious object or the hand of a princess, but eternal life. Some deities
were helpful to the dead, but others were hostile unless approached in the right
way. The soul of the deceased had to act like a magician and overcome threats
by knowing protective spells and the true names of the beings he or she would
encounter.
Armed with these powers, the soul would eventually reach a divine do
main. The last ordeal might be the judgment of the heart in the presence of
Osiris and the assessors of the underworld. The goal of the journey was to be
transformed into an akh, an “effective” or “transfigured” spirit. Those who
failed to justify their existence in the divine court faced a second death in the
jaws of the Eater of Souls. The fortunate spirits could take their place among
the stars or among the followers of Osiris, Ra, Thoth, or Hathor, but they could
not escape the cycles of destruction and renewal.
The soul might experience life in the Field of Reeds, a paradise similar to
Egypt, but this was not a permanent state. When the night sun passed on, dark
ness and death returned. The star-spirits were destroyed at dawn and reborn
Mythical Time Lines 93



each night. Even the evil dead, the Enemies of Ra, continuously came back to
life like Apophis so that they could be tortured and killed again.
As the Western Souls, the justified dead formed part of the crew of the em
battled Boat of Millions. They might be thought of as rowing or towing the sun
boat or even defending it against the forces of chaos. The vignette to Book of the
Dead spell 39 shows a dead person taking on Seth’s role of spearing the Apophis
serpent. In death, everyone could be a cosmic hero in the perpetual struggle that
was the central feature of Egyptian myth.

4. This is one of the reasons why Ptah precedes Ra in some lists of gods who ruled the world. Although the imagery of the Primeval Mound is drawn from the inundation, the land is said to rise rather than the waters to fall. The rising of the mound was also seen in sexual terms as the life-bringing erection of the earth god.
5. The parts of Egyptian temples decorated with marsh foliage may represent this stage of the nun when chaos had been subdued by the creator to realize its potential. The mounds, which were places of life, had their evil counterparts in the shifting sandbanks, which were a danger to anyone traveling by water.

The question of whether this means that Egyptian religion developed into a form of monotheism is explored in Siegfried Morenz, Egyptian Religion (London and Ithaca, 1973); and in Erik Hornung, Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many, trans.

7. The main purpose of this ritual was to allow the ka (vital force) of the being depicted to enter and “inhabit” the statue. When performed on mummies, the ritual was thought to restore the senses of the deceased, so that they could breathe, speak, eat, hear, see, and smell again in the afterlife.

9. Two different terms for spitting that sound like the names Shu and Tefnut are used in this text. The Egyptians were fond of etymological explanations for the nature of deities. These explanations are often false in linguistic terms, but they can provide information on religious ideas.
10. Writers on Egyptian myth refer to the Eye of Ra as the Eye Goddess or as the solar eye (the sun disk) in distinction to the lunar eye (the moon disk).
11. For this interpretation, see chapter IIIC in Allen, Genesis in Egypt.
12. In representations of solar deities, this cobra is shown in front of or coiled round the sun disk. The uraeus cobra formed part of many Egyptian royal headdresses.
13. Confusingly, in spite of the story of the Sole Eye searching for Shu and Tefnut, the Eye is quite often identified as Tefnut. The role of a deity is often defined by the pair or group of which he or she forms a part. When Tefnut is paired with Maat, they usually play the contrasting roles of the fierce and gentle daughters of the creator.

20. The name itself would have been the type of “secret knowledge” that was only passed on to the initiated. Some of the Pyramid Texts, which were for the eyes of the king, do claim to give the true name of the creator. New Kingdom hymns threaten that any unauthorized person who speaks the true name of god will die instantly.
21. Thoth may not originally have been linked to this myth, but the Egyptian sense of symmetry demanded that as Thoth restored the lost and wounded lunar eye of Horus, he should also bring back the solar eye of Ra. The various stages in the development of the myth cycle of the solar eye were first studied by H. Junker in Der Auszug der HathorTefnut aus Nubien (Berlin, 1911); and by W. Spiegelberg in Der Ägyptische Mythus vom Sonnenauge (Strasbourg, 1918).

23. This section of the myth is probably based on a list of names, epithets, and festivals of goddesses. By the Greco-Roman Period, and probably earlier, the myth of the Distant Goddess was linked with the winter solstice and the annual return of the inundation from the far south. The flood took some weeks to spread northward, so the priests of each major temple would greet it in turn. For the wild celebrations that marked the return of the wandering goddess, see J. C. Darnell, “Hathor Returns to Medamud,” Studien zur Altägyptischen Kultur 22 (1995): 47–94.
24. These references are chiefly in the texts known as the Teaching for King Merikare and the Words of Neferti; see Parkinson, The Tale of Sinuhe, 138, 226. In another work of this period, the Dialogue of Ipuur, the protagonist expresses the opinion that it would have been better if the sun god had realized the true nature of humanity “in the first generation” and struck them all down.

26. These cosmic beings are treated here as courtiers attending the king of the gods. It is a characteristic of Egyptian deities that they can manifest themselves in different forms and different locations at the same time.

31. See “Appendix: Primary Sources” under “Ismailia naos.” Some Egyptologists believe that this unusual text was influenced by the Greek myth of Zeus’s overthrow of Chronos. This may be so, but the fact that the story was inscribed on a shrine in the holiest part of a temple shows that the designers of the temple considered it important and meaningful.
32. According to Papyrus Salt 825, Osiris was slain by Geb and then brought back to life.
33. E. Otto, for example, wrote that Osiris “is from the beginning a dead god to whom poetic thought later attributes a past life.” See Egyptian Art and the Cults of Osiris and Amon, trans. K. Bosse-Griffiths (London, 1968), 28.
34. “He who was put in the chest” is a traditional epithet of Osiris, but it refers to being encoffined after mummification. Plutarch’s story may be an imaginative attempt to explain the coffins in the form of the body of Osiris that were popular at many periods.
35. Cedar of Lebanon was the favored wood for royal and elite coffins and for the barqueshrines used to carry statues of deities.
36. The only partial parallel to this incident in an Egyptian text is an episode in the tale of the Two Brothers in which Bata cuts off his own penis after being accused of adultery by his brother. He throws it in the river where it is eaten by a catfish. Bata’s name links him with Seth, however, rather than with Osiris. It may be that a myth about Osiris’s losing his penis was created to balance the ancient myth about Seth losing his testicles.
37. This is a role that could be of great significance in Egyptian culture, particularly among royalty, who were often raised by foster mothers. Many writers have noted parallels between the myth of Horus in Chemmis and the story of Moses being hidden in a floating basket among the rushes and then given to his own mother to wet nurse.

39. H. te Velde argues in Seth, God of Confusion (Leiden, 1977) that the Eye of Horus was damaged because of sexual activity between Horus and Seth but that through the intervention of other deities, even this unorthodox union resulted in new life.
40. In this story the disk seems to be the solar disk, but in other versions it is a lunar aspect of Thoth, who is born from the “union” of Horus and Seth.
41. A spell from the Harris Magical Papyrus (BM 10042) refers to Isis weeping on the riverbank after Horus has had sex with her. This myth may have arisen through the common identification of Horus with the fertility god Min, “the bull of his mother.” (See “Min” in “Deities, Themes, and Concepts.”)
42. The myth is in the New Kingdom Papyrus Sallier IX. This seems to be the earliest example of a myth devised to explain the animal-headed divine forms common in Egyptian art. Plutarch angrily dismisses the story that Horus beheaded his mother as a ridiculous lie.

DEITIES, THEMES, AND CONCEPTS
DEITIES, NAMES, AND DATES
A complete list of the deities named in Ancient Egyptian texts would need sev
eral hundred entries. This selection concentrates on the gods and goddesses
who are prominent in myth.
The forms of divine names given in this book are those that have been
most commonly used by Egyptologists. Some are the Greek versions of the orig
inal Egyptian names. Many of these, such as Osiris (for Wsjr) or Thoth (for
Djhwtj), are too well known to change. Alternative spellings of divine names
that may be found in other books are given in brackets. These alternatives are
due to the fact that the exact vowel sounds were not usually indicated in
Egyptian scripts.
For the dates of the various periods mentioned in the entries (for example,
Old Kingdom) see the Chronology on page ix.
PRIMARY SOURCES
Each entry is followed by a selection of primary sources cited in abbreviated
form. An alphabetical list of these abbreviations is given in “Appendix: Primary
Sources.”
AKER
Aker was an earth god who guarded the eastern and western horizons. He took the
form of a pair of conjoined sphinxes facing away from each other (see Figure 45).
See also Sphinx
AKHET
The horizon, a place of transition for gods and the dead, was known as Akhet.
The Double Horizon consisted of the Western Horizon where the sun god died at
sunset and the Eastern Horizon where he was reborn at sunrise. The standard



image of the horizon was a sun
disk between two mountain
peaks. Two shining trees grew
on these mountains, and the
Double Horizon was guarded by
a double sphinx or twin lions.

AMMUT
Ammut was a monstrous god
dess who devoured the hearts of
the evil dead.

AMUN
(AMON, AMMON, AMEN)
Amun was the mysterious cre
ator god whose name meant
Hidden One. He was most com
monly shown as a bearded man
in the prime of life wearing a
headdress surmounted by a dou
ble plume. His origins are ob
scure, but Amun and his female
counterpart Amunet (Amaunet)
were listed among the divine
protectors of the king in the Pyramid Texts. Amun and Amunet were part of the
group of eight primeval deities who came to be known as the Ogdoad of
Hermopolis. During the Middle Kingdom, Amun gradually became the chief god
of the Theban area, where he acquired a new consort, Mut, and a son, Khonsu. In
the New Kingdom, the cult of Amun was combined with that of the creator sun
god Ra. Amun-Ra was worshipped as the King of the Gods and creator of the
world and its inhabitants.
In his chief cult temple at Karnak in Thebes, Amun, Lord of the Thrones of
the Two Lands, ruled as a divine pharaoh. Unlike other important deities,
Amun does not seem to have been thought of as living in some distant celestial
realm. His presence was everywhere, unseen but felt like the wind. His oracles
communicated the divine will to humanity. Amun was said to come swiftly to

help Egyptian kings on the battlefield or to aid the poor and friendless. When he
was manifest in his cult statues, Amun periodically visited the necropolis of
Thebes to unite with its goddess, Hathor, and bring new life to the dead.
Amun tended to be the subject of speculative theology rather than mythical
narratives, but he did play a role in the creation myths of Hermopolis. One of
his incarnations was as the Great Shrieker, a primeval goose whose victory
shout was the first sound. In some accounts this primeval goose laid the “world
egg;” in others, Amun fertilized or created this egg in his ram-headed serpent
form known as Kematef (“He who has completed his moment”). The temple of
Medinet Habu in western Thebes was sometimes identified as the location of
this primal event. A cult statue of the Amun of Karnak regularly visited this
temple to renew the process of creation.
By the end of the New Kingdom, Amun was often depicted as a virile ram
with curved horns or as a ram-headed sphinx. It was in these forms that he was
primarily worshipped in Nubia and Libya. As early as the Middle Kingdom,
Amun had been linked with the god Min to become the embodiment of male
sexual power. Amun-Min, the “bull of his mother,” was an ithyphallic self
generating god. Amun-Ra was the mysterious originator of all life, the “one
who made himself into millions.” In the temples of Thebes he was given a part
ner in the form of a royal priestess known as the “god’s wife” or “god’s hand.”
One of her duties seems to have been to physically arouse the god so that he
would continue the ongoing work of creation by generating life.
Like the ram-god Banebdjedet, Amun was said to mystically unite with the
queen of Egypt to sire the heir to the throne. This royal-birth myth was de
picted in several Theban temples (see Figure 20). The idea persisted as late as
the Greco-Roman Period, when legends were told about how the world
conquering Macedonian king, Alexander the Great, was sired by Amun.
Alexander seems to have been acknowledged as the god’s son when he made a
pilgrimage to the remote temple of Amun at Siwa Oasis. According to some
Classical writers, Alexander and his companions were in danger of dying in the
desert when two serpents appeared to lead them safely to Siwa. The oracle of
Amun at Siwa was believed to be infallible. The Greeks wove it into their own
mythology, claiming that the heroes Perseus and Heracles had consulted
Amun/Zeus there.

ANAT (ANATH, ANTA)
Anat was a Near Eastern warrior goddess worshipped in Egypt from the late
Middle Kingdom onward. In the mythology of the Canaanites of Ugarit, Anat
was the sister, lover, and avenger of the storm god Baal. In Egypt she was re
garded as a daughter of Ra and a consort of the storm god Seth. She was a
formidable defender of the sun god and protected kings on the battlefield.
In Egyptian art, Anat was usually represented as a woman carrying a shield,
a spear, and an axe. One spell refers to Anat fighting alongside Ra against a
troop of wild donkeys who embodied the forces of chaos. So fierce was this con
test that Anat gathered the blood of the wounded sun god in fifteen metal
bowls. King Rameses III claimed that Anat had been his shield in the equally
desperate struggle against the invading Sea Peoples.
In Canaanite mythology, Anat and Baal mated in the forms of cow and bull;
in Egypt, Anat was called the “great cow of Seth.” In a myth used in several
spells, Seth sees the Seed Goddess bathing and has sex with her. Only the cre
ator sun god is allowed to mate with the Seed Goddess, so this sacrilegious act
poisons Seth. Anat, “the woman who acts like a warrior,” hastens to her father
Ra to demand help for Seth. Perhaps out of fear of his warrior daughter, Ra has
Isis cure Seth with her magic.

ANTI (ANTY)
An Upper Egyptian falcon god who was brutally punished for crimes against
the gods, Anti was closely associated with both Horus and Seth. He was usu
ally depicted as a falcon in a boat, but he could be shown as a griffin or as a
man with the distinctive head of the Seth animal. Anti sometimes embodies
the bad qualities of Horus, but in Coffin Texts spell 942 he is a manifestation
of Seth who is shaved or skinned by a goddess in revenge for “turning the land
upside down.”
A myth in Papyrus Jumilhac explains why the cult statue of Anti is made
of silver rather than the usual gold. Anti was condemned for some terrible
crime that he had committed, probably the decapitation of a cow goddess. His
skin and his flesh were flayed off his bones as a punishment and hung on a pole.
Like all gods, Anti’s flesh was made of gold and his bones of silver, so only the
silver was left. When Anti was forgiven, the cow goddess restored his flesh with
her healing milk.
Anti seems to be identical with Nemty, another divine falcon who was
punished by the gods. In a New Kingdom story the Divine Tribunal retires to an
island to consider whether to award the crown of Egypt to Horus or Seth. The
deities who make up the Tribunal do not want to be disturbed by Isis, the
mother of Horus. They order Nemty, the divine ferryman, not to take any
woman who looks like Isis to the island. Isis disguises herself as an old hag and
bribes Nemty with a gold ring to ferry her to the island. After she makes a fool
of Seth, he demands that Nemty be punished. The Divine Tribunal orders all
Nemty’s toes (or claws) to be chopped off. Nemty vows that gold shall be taboo
in his town forever, providing another explanation for the use of silver in his
temples.
This was not the end of Nemty’s misfortunes. A spell recounts how Horus
and a god who is probably Nemty travel together in a golden boat. When Nemty
is bitten and poisoned, he begs Horus to heal him. Horus offers to help in ex
change for Nemty’s true name. Nemty tries to fool him by giving the grandiose
names of other deities, but in the end he has to tell the truth. Horus cures him
and gains lasting power over Nemty.

ANUBIS (ANPU, INPW)
Anubis was the terrifying canine god who presided over the mummification of
bodies and guarded burials. He was usually shown as a seated black jackal or as
a man with the head of a jackal or wild dog. Anubis helped to judge the dead,
and he and his army of messengers were charged with punishing those who vio
lated tombs or offended the gods.
The jackals and wild dogs who lived on the edge of the desert were carrion
eaters who might dig up shallowly buried corpses. To avert this horrible end for
their dead, the early Egyptians tried to placate Anubis, “the dog who swallows
millions.” Most of the epithets of Anubis link him with death and burial. He
was “the one who is in the place of embalming,” “the Lord of the Sacred Land”
(the desert cemeteries), and “the Foremost of the Westerners,” that is, the
leader of the dead. Anubis had a female counterpart, Anput, who is also shown
as a jackal.
For most of the Old Kingdom, Anubis was the most important funerary de
ity. His figure was carved in tomb entrances to warn off grave robbers at a time
when no other deities could be shown in nonroyal tombs. By the end of the
third millennium BCE, Osiris had become the King of the Dead. Anubis was in
corporated into the Osiris myth as the god who invented mummification to pre
serve the corpse of Osiris. He became the chief guardian of the mummy of
Osiris and a supporter of Isis and her son, Horus. Anubis came to be regarded as
a son of Osiris, but the darker side of his character was remembered in the epi
thet “the one who eats his father.”
Anubis’s title, Master of Secrets, chiefly referred to the gruesome secrets of
the embalming tent. He was particularly associated with the bandaging of
mummies and with the ceremony known as the Opening of the Mouth Ritual.
This was performed to give the mummy back the senses it had enjoyed in life.

(Art Resource)



In the Book of the Dead, Anubis is shown in the throne room of Osiris supervis
ing the weighing of the hearts of the dead. Among his duties was to fetch the
hearts of the Followers of Seth.
A story recorded in the first millennium BCE tells how the wicked god Seth
disguised himself as a leopard to approach the body of Osiris. He was seized by
Anubis and branded all over with a hot iron. This, according to Egyptian myth,
is how the leopard got its spots. Anubis then flayed Seth and wore his bloody
skin as a warning to evildoers. By this era, Anubis was said to command an
army of demon messengers who inflicted suffering and death.
Anubis remained an important funerary god in the Roman Period, but his
cult was singled out for abuse by Roman writers. This may have been partly be
cause of his popularity with necromancers. Demotic spells explain how to sum
mon Anubis, the Keeper of the Keys to the Underworld, by methods such as
drawing his image in the blood of a black dog. When he appeared, Anubis was
used as a go-between to fetch gods and spirits from the underworld to answer
the magician’s questions. Anubis also acted as an enforcer of curses; a role he
plays to this day in horror films.

APIS
Apis was a bull kept at Memphis who was the most important of all sacred ani
mals. In life, the Apis bull was honored as the physical manifestation of Ptah; in
death he was worshipped as a form of Osiris. A festival called the Running of
the Apis Bull is recorded as early as the First Dynasty. By the Late Period the
Apis bull had become a kind of national mascot.
When an Apis bull died, he was mourned as if he were Osiris himself and
given an extravagant funeral. Priests searched Egypt for a calf with the right
markings to be recognized as the new Apis. The mother of the chosen calf was
given a name (such as “the one of Bastet”) and honored as a manifestation of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 105



Isis. The new bull was crowned at full moon by the high priest of Ptah. Then he
and his mother were installed in palatial quarters in the grounds of the temple
of Ptah. The actions of the Apis bull were carefully watched because they were
believed to predict the future.
The Apis bull came to be closely linked to the myth of the repeated death
and regeneration of Osiris. Diodorus Siculus was told that when Osiris died, his
soul had passed into the first Apis bull and was then preserved in each new bull.
According to Plutarch, each Apis bull was believed to be miraculously gener
ated by the light of the moon. Herodotus, on the other hand, recorded that each
Apis was conceived when a lightning bolt hit his mother.
Herodotus also related that an Apis bull of the sixth century BCE was
stabbed to death by the invading Persian king, Cambyses. The king is said to
have been driven mad as a punishment for this sacrilegious act. Plutarch also
referred to a legend about the slaughter of the Apis bull by Cambyses. He says
that after the bull was killed, its corpse was thrown out of the temple. No car
rion eaters would come near the holy animal, except dogs. By devouring the
body of the Apis bull, dogs lost their place of honor in Egyptian religion and be
came “unclean” animals.

APOPHIS (APEP)
Apophis was the most dangerous of the chaos monsters who constantly threat
ened the divine order. He was sometimes described as a huge crocodile but was
usually shown as a giant snake. Every night Apophis attacked the boat of the
sun god as it passed through the underworld. He was beaten back and slaugh
tered, but however many times he was killed he always came back to life again.
In Egyptian myth, snakes can be divine protectors or symbols of renewal,
but the Apophis snake seems to be an entirely destructive force. He was the
negative counterpart of the snake form of the creator god. Apophis was first
mentioned in the twenty-first century BCE. A much later creation myth ex
plained that Apophis sprang from the saliva of the goddess Neith when she
was still in the primeval waters. Her spit became a snake 120 yards long. He

was “the Great Rebel,” the “Evil One” who led the forces of chaos against the
sun god Ra.
The idea of the Apophis snake may have come from the African python,
which can open its mouth wide enough to swallow a person. Apophis is proba
bly the unnamed snake demon who tried to swallow the nun, the primeval wa
ters, but was forced to cough them up again. The eyes of Apophis seem to have
been particularly feared, and he was said to make a terrible roaring sound. The
movement of his body could cause earthquakes, and he was associated with the
hidden sandbanks that were a danger to boats on the Nile. It has been suggested
that a combination of the snake and crocodile forms of Apophis may be the ori
gin of the dragons of medieval legend.
In Egyptian accounts of the nightly journey of the sun through the under
world, Apophis usually attacks in the seventh and the twelfth hours of the
night. Powerful deities stand in the prow of the solar barque to protect the sun
god against Apophis. Seth, the strongest of the gods, can be shown clubbing or
spearing the Apophis snake. The fight between Seth and Apophis has some
times been interpreted as a myth to explain thunderstorms. Another myth, of
which no detailed version survives, told how the Great Tom Cat, a form of Ra,

cut off the head of Apophis under the sacred ished tree “on the night of making
war and driving off the rebels.”
The spirits of the dead were expected to join in the struggle against
Apophis, and rituals were performed in temples to ensure his defeat. In the
Book of Overthrowing Apophis, the most terrifying deities in the Egyptian pan
theon were evoked to combat the chaos serpent and destroy all the aspects of
his being, such as his body, his name, his shadow, and his magic. Priests acted
out this unending war by drawing pictures or making models of Apophis. These
were cursed and then destroyed by stabbing, trampling, and burning.

ASH
Ash was the god of the western desert and its oases. Later identified with Seth.
ASTARTE (ASHTARTE)
Astarte was a Near Eastern war goddess who was introduced into Egypt during
the Second Intermediate Period. In Egyptian myth she became the daughter of
Ra or Ptah and a consort of Seth. She is probably the same goddess worshipped
by the Philistines as Ashtoreth and the Canaanites as Ashera. She also had
much in common with the important Mesopotamian goddess Ishtar (Ashtar),
the Lady of Battle. In Egyptian art, Astarte was usually shown naked, brandish
ing weapons and riding on horseback or driving a chariot. This made her a very
alien figure. Egyptian goddesses were not usually shown naked, and Egyptian
women never rode horses.
The lion was one of Astarte’s sacred animals, and Astarte was sometimes
given a lion’s head. This identified her with the Eye of the Sun: the solar lioness
who protected her father Ra. Like other goddesses who play this role, Astarte
could also appear as a beautiful seductive woman.
In a New Kingdom story, Seth is offered the goddesses Astarte and Anat as
compensation for losing the throne to Horus. A spell refers to Astarte and

Anat’s becoming pregnant but not giving birth, possibly because of Seth’s asso
ciation with abortion. Astarte is also linked with Seth in a fragmentary New
Kingdom tale known as Astarte and the Sea. This story is very similar to a
myth from Ugarit in northern Syria in which the god Baal overcomes the sea
monster Yam.
The tale begins with an account of the separation of the earth and sky and
the creation of the world. The rule of the creator is challenged by Yam (the Sea),
who embodies the chaotic aspect of the primeval ocean. Yam demands the trib
ute due to an overlord. The harvest goddess, Renenutet, delivers boxes of trea
sure, but it is not enough. Renenutet sends a bird messenger to Astarte’s house
to wake the goddess and tell her to take more tribute to Yam. Astarte weeps at
the message, but she goes to the shore and sings and dances to attract the sea
monster. Yam then wants her for his bride. Astarte is welcomed by the Ennead,
who give up some of their most precious possessions to form her dowry.
Yam threatens to flood the whole earth if he does not get what he wants.
When Yam comes to collect the treasure, he is challenged by Seth. In the
Ugaritic myth, Baal kills the sea monster, scatters the pieces of its body, and de
clares himself king. The damaged Egyptian version probably ended with Seth
defeating Yam and claiming Astarte as his prize.

ATEN (ATON)
Aten was a form of the sun god promoted by King Amenhotep IV in the four
teenth century BCE. This king changed his name to Akhenaten, which probably
means “one effective on behalf of Aten.” He built huge roofless temples to
Aten, at first in Thebes and then in a new capital city, Akhetaten (Horizon of
Aten). Aten was shown as a disk or sphere with rays ending in human hands
holding the symbol of life. In Akhetaten (modern Tell el-Amarna), Aten was
worshipped as the “sole god without equal.” He was the god of light who had
made the world and sustained it every day.
Surviving hymns to Aten stress his role as benevolent creator. There is no
long sequence of events leading up to creation. Aten is simply said to have
“made everything according to his heart” when he was alone. This act of cre
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 109



ation was renewed every morning at sunrise. The hymns list the creatures
given life by Aten in loving detail. “The flowers live because of your rays, the
seeds sprout from the soil when you shine. Refreshed by your sight all flocks of
animals frisk. Birds in the nest fly up joyfully, beating their wings in praise of
the living Aten, their creator.” It is emphasized that Aten created all the foreign
countries and their peoples, not just Egypt and the Egyptians. The only category
of beings who are missing are the numerous gods and goddesses who would
come first in more traditional accounts of creation.
The worship of Aten as the solar disk had been prominent from the begin
ning of the New Kingdom. In the early years of Akhenaten’s reign, Aten was
identified with various manifestations of the creator sun god such as Ra
Horakhty and Shu. Later these references to other deities were purged, and Aten
was redefined as “the light which comes from the solar disk.” This could not
really be depicted, so the disk-and-rays image of Aten may be no more than an
elaborate hieroglyphic writing of the god’s name. The rays only hold out life to
the king and the female members of the royal family. Everyone else was ex
pected to receive life from Akhenaten and his chief queen, Nefertiti, in return
for absolute loyalty.
The worship of the most popular creator god, Amun-Ra, was banned, and
the cults of other deities were neglected or ignored. Akhenaten tried to abolish
most of the complex mythology that had grown up around the solar cycle.
There was to be no nightly struggle against the forces of chaos. Akhenaten’s
theology produced no explanation for the presence of evil or sorrow in the
world. When the Aten was absent at night, all creatures “sleep as though dead.”
The actual dead were no longer thought to pass into another world. They could
only expect to spend eternity adoring Aten in his temples, woken every morn
ing by his light.
Akhenaten’s ideas never seem to have gained popular acceptance. A few
years after his death, his policies were reversed. Amun-Ra became the chief de
ity of the state again, and Aten went back to being an aspect of the sun god.
Speculation continued, however, about whether all deities were simply tran

ATUM (ATEM)
A creator deity who began and
ended the world, Atum was the
senior deity of the group of nine
gods known as the Ennead of
Heliopolis. When Atum became
aware of his loneliness, he mas
turbated and impregnated him
self with his own semen to pro
duce the divine siblings Shu
and Tefnut. Atum and Ra were
often regarded as the primordial
and solar aspects of the creator.
The joint deity Ra-Atum (or
Atum-Ra) wore the Double
Crown of Upper and Lower
Egypt to indicate his position as
King of the Gods. Within the
daily solar cycle, Atum was the
setting sun “who becomes old
every evening.”
At the beginning and end of
each of the great cycles of exis
tence, Atum took form in the
primeval waters as a snake or an eel. Atum and the Apophis serpent have been
interpreted by some Egyptologists as the positive and negative forces within
chaos. The name Atum comes from a word meaning completeness or totality.
The potential for all life was contained within Atum. When the Primeval
Mound came into existence, Atum had a place to begin creation. He conceived
and gave birth to the first two-gendered deities. As the “father and mother” of
the gods, Atum was the ultimate divine and royal ancestor.
In the act of creation, Atum was shown in human form holding or sucking
his erect penis. From the New Kingdom onward, the Hand of Atum was person
ified as a goddess, usually Hathor Nebet-hetepet or Iusaas. The image of the
hand and the penis coming together to create life could be replaced by the con
cept of a divine union between the male and female principles inherent in the
creator. A Hand of Atum is also mentioned in magical texts as a powerful talis
man to drive away evil. In Egyptian symbolism, beings and images often had
dual sexual and apotropaic meanings.

Another part of Atum with an independent existence was his eye. The coa
lescence of Atum with Ra is expressed in the myth in which Atum sends out
his eye to bring light to the primeval darkness. This eye was also a goddess who
was both the daughter and the consort of the creator. The Eye goddess was
mainly referred to as the Eye of Ra, but occasionally as the Eye of Atum. These
terms could be used to express a contrast between the headstrong and danger
ous aspect of this goddess (the Eye of Ra) and her more amenable, protective as
pect (the Eye of Atum). Sometimes, however, the Eye of Ra was the sun and the
Eye of Atum was the moon.
At a later stage in mythical history, Ra-Atum and his warrior daughter
fought a great battle against the forces of chaos. The key event was the slaugh
ter of the chaos monster Apophis under the ished tree. This was a sacred tree
growing in Heliopolis that was linked to the destiny of all beings. During this
battle, Ra-Atum took the form of a cat, a mongoose, or an ichneumon, all preda
tors that kill snakes (see Figure 22).
In solar mythology Atum was often paired with Khepri. They were comple
mentary opposites, the setting and rising sun. In some Underworld Books,
Atum is shown as an elderly man leaning on a stick. This is a rare phenomenon
in Egyptian art, but it reflects the literary tradition that the sun god aged and
became vulnerable to rebellions by deities and people. Such rebellions led to
great changes in the nature of the world, such as the creator sun god’s departure
from earth to live in the heavens or the dissolution of the whole cosmos. In
Book of the Dead spell 175, Atum warns Osiris that after millions of years he
will destroy everything that he has made.

BABOONS
The “dog-faced” baboon (Papio cynocephalus) was an important sacred animal.
The male baboon was particularly associated with ferocious gods and lunar
deities. Baboons in a group were often dawn gods who helped the sun to rise.
Statues and figurines of baboons were placed in temples and tombs from
the Protodynastic Period onward. A god called Babi seems to have been en
dowed with the aggressive virility of a dominant male baboon. This deity lived
on the entrails of the dead but could be persuaded to help deceased men to en
joy the pleasures of sex in the afterlife. Another early baboon deity was known
simply as the Great White One. He seems to have been a personification of the
royal ancestors, but his name suggests that he had a lunar aspect.
The lunar gods Khonsu and Thoth both had baboon forms. Colossal statues
of baboons flanked the entrance to Thoth’s greatest temple at Hermopolis.
Initially this baboon form may only have been associated with Thoth’s lunar as
pect. Later it was prominent whenever Thoth was honored as the god of scribes
and writing, perhaps because a baboon’s dexterous hands resemble those of peo
ple. In a tale from the Greco-Roman Period, a magician makes two wax baboons
come to life and write down thirty-five good stories and thirty-five bad stories.
A baboon was often shown sitting on top of the scales in which the hearts
of the dead were weighed against the feather symbol of truth. This baboon was
sometimes identified with Thoth, the recorder of divine judgments, and some
times with Khonsu, “who eats the hearts of the dead.” Four baboons with
scorching breath guarded the Lake of Fire in the underworld, where they judged
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 113

the Dead. (Courtesy of Geraldine Pinch)



the rich and the poor alike. It was in the form of a baboon that Thoth traveled
through the Nubian desert in search of the fiery daughter of the sun god.
The eight baboons of the horizon were associated with solar worship. These
baboons (sometimes reduced to four or two) were shown standing on their hind
legs and raising their front paws to greet the rising sun. “The baboons, the souls
of the east, praise you when they call out to you at the appearance of your sun
disk.” The baboons were sometimes equated with the eight Heh gods who held
up the sky. The separation of earth and sky so that the first sunrise could take
place was one of the most important episodes in the Egyptian creation story.
This cosmic event was repeated each dawn.
Wild baboons do stretch and chatter when waking up and moving off at
first light. This was interpreted as singing and dancing for the sun god Ra, so ba
boons were thought to be the first creatures to pay proper religious observances.
Baboons were kept as sacred animals in several Egyptian temples. There was a
belief reported by some Classical writers that the most learned Egyptian priests
understood the secret language of baboons. This was thought to be the natural
language of true religion.

BANEBDJEDET (BANEBDJED)
A ram god associated with the town of Mendes (Djedet), Banebdjedet was the
northern equivalent of the god Khnum. His sacred animal was a ram or a goat.
His consort was a fish or dolphin goddess called Hatmehyt (Foremost of the
Fishes), who seems to have been the original local deity of Mendes.
As the word for ram (ba) and the word for soul or manifestation sounded
the same in Egyptian, ram gods were often regarded as manifestations of other
deities. Banebdjedet could be shown with four rams’ heads representing the four
bas of the creator sun god. This linked Banebdjedet with Osiris, who was often
named as a ba of the sun god. The Book of the Heavenly Cow states that “the
ba of Osiris is the ram of Mendes.” Passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that the
soul of Osiris took refuge in Mendes when his body was killed by Seth.
Banebdjedet could also be identified with the first four gods to rule Egypt: Ra
Atum, Shu, Geb, and Osiris. Huge granite shrines for these four deities were set
up in the sanctuary at Mendes.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
114



Banebdjedet was not always treated as a form of Osiris. In a New Kingdom
story, he is consulted by the Divine Tribunal. When they order the ram god to
judge between Horus and Seth, he diplomatically suggests that they ask the
goddess Neith instead. When that fails to settle matters, Banebdjedet proposes
that the throne be given to Seth because he is older than Horus.
Ram gods were particularly renowned for their virility, and one of
Banebdjedet’s epithets was Lord of Sexual Pleasure. A stela from a chapel in the
Ramesseum complex records that the god Ptah took the form of Banebdjedet to
sleep with a mortal woman. The son that resulted was the future pharaoh,
Rameses II. Greek writers reported that a male goat was honored as a fertility
god at Mendes and identified with the Greek god Pan. A Persian king of the
fourth century BCE is alleged to have gone mad after sacking the temple and eat
ing the sacred goat. The sexual aspect of the cult at Mendes made it particularly
disliked by early Christians. Banebdjedet’s form as a ram or goat-headed man
was reinterpreted as a devil figure who entered Western tradition as the horned
King of the Witches.

BASTET (BAST, BOUBASTIS, PASHT)
Bastet was a feline goddess who mothered the king and destroyed his enemies.
Her name probably means She of the Ointment Jar. Her main cult center was at
Bubastis in the eastern Delta. As “the Eye of Ra who protects her father Ra,”
she was a manifestation of the solar eye. Bastet was regarded as both the daugh
ter and the consort of Atum-Ra. Their son, Mahes (Mihos), was a lion deity.
Bastet herself was generally shown as a lion-headed woman until the end of the
second millennium BCE, when her cat and cat-headed forms became prominent.
From the Pyramid Texts onward, Bastet has a double aspect of nurturing
mother and terrifying avenger. It is the demonic aspect that mainly features in
the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead and in medical spells. The “slaugh
terers of Bastet” were said to inflict plague and other disasters on humanity.
One spell advises pretending to be the “son of Bastet” in order to avoid catching
the plague. Bastet may be the poisoned cat who is cured by Ra in a myth al
luded to in another healing spell.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 115



A Twelfth Dynasty text compares an Egyptian king to Sekhmet when he
smites wrongdoers and to Bastet when he protects his loyal subjects. The con
trast between these two goddesses came to be expressed visually by their li
oness and cat forms. Bastet was one of the goddesses associated with the story
of the Distant Goddess, the daughter of Ra who quarrels with her father and re
treats into the desert. She was particularly identified with the form of this god
dess known as the “Nubian cat,” who could be shown with the body of a spot
ted cat and the head of a Nubian woman. A god, usually Thoth or Shu,
persuades the wandering cat to return to Egypt, where she is transformed into a
compliant and fertile divine consort.
Some scholars have interpreted this as a myth about the taming of female
sexuality. According to the Greek writer Herodotus, however, women were
freed from all constraints during an annual festival at Bubastis. They celebrated
the festival of the goddess by drinking, dancing, making music, and displaying
their genitals.
The erotic reputation of the followers of Bastet is reflected in a story about
Prince Setna composed in the later first millennium BCE. Setna encounters
Taboubu, the beautiful daughter of a priest of Bastet, and instantly falls in love
with her. Taboubu agrees to meet Setna in the house of Bastet in Memphis.
Before she will sleep with him, Taboubu makes the infatuated Setna sign a deed

giving her all his possessions. He even lets her kill his own children and feed
their bodies to cats and dogs. Setna is about to embrace Taboubu when he finds
himself alone and naked on the public highway. It has all been an illusion to
punish Setna for stealing a magical book from a tomb. In this story, the irre
sistible Taboubu may be a manifestation of Bastet herself, playing her tradi
tional role of punisher of humans who have offended the gods.

BENU BIRD (PHOENIX)
In some Egyptian creation myths the benu bird is the oldest living creature.
When the first land rose out of the dark waters of chaos, the shining benu bird
alighted on this primeval mound. Its cry was the first sound ever heard. The
earliest references to the benu bird seem to describe it as a yellow wagtail, but
it was later shown as a type of heron (see Figure 11).
The word benu probably comes from an Egyptian verb meaning to rise and
shine. The benu bird may originally have been identified with Venus as the
morning star, making it the forerunner of the renewal of creation each dawn.
The cry of the benu bird was the point at which time began. It was also the benu
bird who would announce the end of time and the return of the world to chaos.
From the Pyramid Texts onward, the benu bird was closely associated with
the creator sun god. In Heliopolis, the center of solar worship, the benu bird
was said to perch on the benben stone, a kind of primitive obelisk, or in the
branches of a sacred willow tree. When Egyptian kings had reigned for thirty
years, they asked the benu bird to renew their strength and vitality.
Both Ra and Osiris could be identified with the benu bird, an expression of
the “secret knowledge” that these two gods were one. As a manifestation of
Osiris, the benu bird led the spirits of the dead through the dangers of the un
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 117



derworld. Some spells in the Book of the Dead aim to assist the dead to trans
form themselves into benu birds, so that they can travel freely between worlds.
The benu bird seems to have been the prototype for the Classical myth of
the phoenix, a creature of which there was never more than one at a time. In
the fifth century BC, the Greek writer Herodotus claimed to have visited
Heliopolis and been told about a marvelous red-gold bird known as a phoenix.
This bird was said to visit the temple of the sun at Heliopolis every 500 years
carrying the ashes of its parent inside an egg of myrrh. It was presumably from
this egg that the next phoenix would eventually hatch.

BES AND BESET
Bes and Beset were protective dwarf deities closely associated with childbirth
and rebirth. A number of dwarf deities are known from Egyptian art under the
names of Aha, Hity (Haty), or Bes. They often appear in groups—strangling
snakes, waving knives, or playing musical instruments. Aha, whose name means
Fighter, attacked and overcame the forces of evil such as demons, chaos serpents,
and foreign sorcerers. Hity was a kind of divine exorcist who drove away evil by
stamping, dancing, and banging a drum or a tambourine. Bes, and the female
counterpart whom Egyptologists call Beset, performed similar functions.
By the end of the second millennium BCE, Bes and Beset were sometimes
identified with the divine siblings, Shu and Tefnut. Paradoxically, Bes became a
giant dwarf whose body reached from the underworld to the heavens. He could
also be regarded as a special embryonic form of the creator sun god. It may be in
this role that Bes can be shown as an androgynous being suckling or cuddling
baby Bes figures, monkeys, or kittens. In the first millennium BCE, the joint de
ity Horus-Bes figured in magic as a divine healer and protector.
Egyptian “old wives” probably told stories about the antics of Bes, but they
do not survive in the written record. The evidence for dwarf deities is mainly
pictorial. They appear on magical objects, bedroom furniture, and items used to
contain or apply makeup. Bes amulets and figurines were popular for over 2,000
years. Some women even decorated their bodies with Bes tattoos to improve
their sex life or fertility.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
118



The masklike face of Bes has wide eyes, a flat nose, and a projecting tongue.
It is framed by hair that sometimes looks like a lion’s mane. Originally Bes may
have been a dwarf wearing the entire skin of a lion or a leopard. By the later sec
ond millennium BCE he is usually a half-human, half-animal creature, with a
furry body, a long tail, and a face as ugly as an “old monkey.” The spotted pelt
of some Bes and Beset figures may relate to the myth in which the flayed skin
of Anti or Seth becomes a protective garment for the champions of order. The
ugliness of Bes and the way in which he often displays oversized genitals added
to his effectiveness as an apotropaic deity.
Beset had the same lion-mask features as Bes. She was sometimes shown as
a dwarf and sometimes with a body of normal proportions. Beset is unusual in
being portrayed naked. In Egyptian myth, goddesses seem to undress for one of
two reasons: to overcome some hostile force by their sexual power or to give
birth. Some figurines of Beset may show her pregnant. As a “divine mother,”
Beset could be a form of Isis or Hathor.
Complex Bes and Beset figurines of the Third Intermediate Period include
visual allusions to the myth of the Distant Goddess Hathor-Tefnut. She wan
dered as a cat in the Nubian or Libyan deserts until she was persuaded to return
by Shu and Thoth, who had taken the form of apes or monkeys. Dwarf deities
such as Bes and Hity are shown in temples of the Greco-Roman Period capering
like monkeys and making music to pacify the returning goddess (see Figure 14).
During the New Kingdom, Bes was usually paired with the fearsome hip
popotamus goddess Taweret rather than with Beset. The two deities appear in
scenes celebrating the births of kings and commoners. Bes and Taweret were
also the guardians of the divine infants worshipped in the Birth Houses of tem
ples of the first millennium BCE. Temple and magical texts give Bes or Bes-Shu
the role of opening the womb to allow a child to be born.
The symbolism of birth was reproduced in tombs to help the dead to new
life. Some royal tombs and sarcophagi show Bes with hippopotamus-faced
demons protecting the lion-shaped bed on which the deceased hoped to be re
born. A painted statue of Bes dominates a tomb chamber in the recently discov
ered Valley of the Golden Mummies.

BIRDS
Egypt was very rich in bird life. The river Nile and the marshes teemed with
water birds, carrion eaters and birds of prey soared above the deserts, and huge
flocks of migratory birds passed overhead or wintered in the south of the coun
try. Many Egyptian deities had bird forms, but flocks of birds were used as a
symbol of chaos. In some Egyptian creation myths, a bird was the first living be
ing. The heavens could be imagined as a cosmic hawk. Many spells claimed to
bestow the power to fly to the celestial realm or between the worlds of the liv
ing and the dead. The ba, the Egyptian concept that is closest to Western ideas
about the soul, could be shown as a human-headed bird.
Birds were traditionally hunted with throw sticks or nets. There was a
Birdcatcher God, who was the son of the Marsh Goddess. Migrating birds were
probably seen as foreign invaders, and large flocks could strip fields and or
chards bare. This may be why the common sparrow was used as a symbol in
words denoting evil things. In temples of the Greco-Roman Period, gods are
shown assisting the king to pull a clap net tight on a chaotic mass of birds. At
Kom Ombo temple, bound foreign prisoners are pictured among the struggling
birds, emphasizing that the bird-catching ritual is part of the eternal war be
tween order and chaos.
As the divine order was created out of the swamps of chaos, water birds
such as the goose, the heron, or the ibis were associated with the first stages of
creation. A primeval goose, named Gengen or Negeg, shrieked or cackled as it
laid the world egg. One of the tasks of the virtuous dead was to guard this egg.
The remains of the primeval egg were said to be preserved in the temple of the
ibis god, Thoth. In the temple of Horus at Edfu, the first bird was said to be a
hawk who alighted on a mat of vegetation floating on the primeval waters.
Many other gods and a few goddesses had a hawk form, including Anti,
Montu, Sokar, Sopdu, Hathor, Nephthys, and Isis. Horus was able to manifest
himself as a sky falcon 1,000 cubits long. Egyptian kings were revered as earthly
manifestations of Horus. When they died, they were said to fly to the horizon in
the form of a falcon to unite with the sun disk. The sun disk itself was often
shown with wings. Texts at Edfu claim that this was to commemorate Horus
assuming this form to blind the enemies of the sun god.
Horus could also appear as a griffin, a monster combining the powers of a
hawk, a lion, and a snake. By the Greco-Roman Period, the griffin was seen as a
symbol of divine retribution. In one of the parables told by the god Thoth to the
Distant Goddess, two vultures who represent sight and hearing learn that even
the mighty lion can be slaughtered by the griffin if he disobeys the laws of Ra.
Another of these parables concerns a vulture and a cat who are both punished
for breaking an oath sworn by Ra. The vulture in this parable is fiercely mater

nal, which reflects the fact that one of the Egyptian words for vulture (mwt)
sounded the same as the word for mother. The vulture goddess Nekhbet was a
mythical mother to every Egyptian king. Queens traditionally wore headdresses
in the form of a vulture.
The goddesses Isis and Nephthys could take the form of kites, small birds
of prey that also ate carrion, to watch over the body of Osiris. One episode in
the New Kingdom story the Contendings of Horus and Seth tells how Isis
tricked Seth into admitting that Horus was in the right. She then turned into a
kite and flew up into a tree to mock Seth from the safety of its branches.
Isis and Nephthys, and other goddesses such as Maat, could also be shown
as winged beings. Their outspread wings offered protection and shade, like
those of the vulture goddess Nekhbet. In her bird form, Isis used her wings to
fan the breath of life back into her murdered husband. The ostrich feather worn
by the god Shu was also associated with the breath of life.
After death the personality survived as a ba. This had the power to leave
the mummy and travel through the Egyptian cosmos, though only the virtuous
soul would find a safe place to alight. From the New Kingdom onward the bas
of the dead were shown as part bird, part human. The bird body could be that of
a stork, a vulture, or a hawk. A sequence of spells in the Book of the Dead al
lows the ba to transform itself into a falcon, a heron, a swallow, or the leg
endary benu bird (phoenix).
The dead also aspired to join the “imperishable stars” of the northern sky,
which were sometimes pictured as swallows. In one myth, Ra devours all the
other deities. He vomits them out again as fish, but they change into birds and
fly up to the heavens to become stars.

BOATS
Boats were one of the most important forms of transport in Ancient Egypt, es
pecially during the inundation season, so it is natural that they are prominent
Egyptian myth. From a very early period the divine realm was thought of as a
watery region high above the earth consisting of rivers, islands, and marshes.
The Duat, the Egyptian underworld, also contained rivers, lakes, and marshy ar
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 121



eas. Therefore, deities and the spirits of the dead were often shown or described
as traveling by boat. In actual cult practice, when divine statues left their sanc
tuaries they were transported in boat-shaped shrines.
In the Pyramid Texts, the deceased king voyages to the horizon on a raft or
skiff made from reeds. Groups of full-size timber boats were buried near royal
tombs for most of the third millennium BCE. Scenes on some tomb walls from
this era show the mummies of important people being taken by boat on a
posthumous pilgrimage to Busiris or Abydos, the holy towns of Osiris, the god
of the underworld.
In many passages in the Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead, the de
ceased soul has to persuade a divine ferryman to help him or her across the
rivers of the underworld. To succeed, it was necessary to know the names of the
ferryman and every part of his boat. The deceased could also be shown sailing
their own boats with the help of the goddess of the sweet north wind. Other fu
nerary spells were intended to assist the dead to join the crew of the solar
barque. This was the boat in which the sun god traveled across the sky and
through the underworld.
The solar barque was called the Boat of Millions because all the gods and
all the souls of the blessed dead might be needed in its crew. The crew is some
times referred to as rowing the solar barque, but this is never shown. Instead, a
number of deities, often in the form of jackals or cobras, can be depicted towing
the boat along (see Figure 43). In some Underworld Books there are two solar
barques, the Day Boat (Mandjet) and the Night Boat (Mesektet). It is possible
that the two huge cedar-wood boats buried beside the Great Pyramid of Khufu
(Cheops) represented these barques.
The sun god can be shown alone in the Day Boat, but in the Night Boat
other deities usually stand on deck ready to defend the vulnerable nocturnal
form of the sun. The dangers included submerged sandbanks and attacks by
hostile crocodiles, turtles, and snakes. The worst of these enemies was the
monstrous chaos serpent Apophis. Sometimes the solar barque was surrounded
or followed by a whole fleet of small boats carrying various protective deities
and emblems. The prow and stern posts of these boats terminate in crowns,
snakes, or human or animal heads.
The moon god and many star deities were also pictured traveling the heav
ens in boats. As early as the First Dynasty, the celestial falcon, Horus, had been
shown in a boat. Several episodes in the prolonged conflict between the Two
Lords, Horus and Seth, took place in boats. In one text, Horus challenges Seth
to a race in stone boats. In the Greco-Roman Period temple at Edfu, texts and
reliefs tell the story of the triumph of Horus over the forces of Seth. With the
help of various deities, Horus repeatedly harpoons the Seth-hippopotamus who

122



attacks his boat. The boat of Horus seems to be presented as an earthly counter
part of the beleaguered solar barque. This whole drama was probably acted out
from real boats on the temple lake each year.
At Abydos a model boat representing the neshmet barque, “the warship of
the gods,” took part in a reenactment of the myth of the death and revival of
Osiris. The priests who carried such boat-shrines played the role of the crew of
the divine barques. The small boat-shrines were sometimes transported be
tween temples on actual boats. The most famous of these was the “great noble
boat” image used as the main cult of Amun-Ra at Karnak. A story dating to the
early first millennium BCE tells how a priest called Wenamun was sent to
Lebanon to buy logs of cedar to make a new boat for Amun-Ra. He suffered
many trials and adventures, including losing all the gold and silver that was
meant to pay for the timber. The ending is missing, but the story probably con
cluded with Wenamun’s triumphant return to Thebes with the precious cedar.

CATTLE
The nomadic ancestors of the Ancient Egyptians were dependent on their herds
for survival. There is evidence that cattle were treated as sacred animals as
early as the sixth millennium BCE. Cattle cults remained a central part of
Egyptian religion and mythology during the whole span of Pharaonic culture.
Human beings were said to be “God’s cattle.” Bulls were revered as symbols of
masculine strength and virility. Many gods had a bull form, and sacred bulls
were kept at some temples. A sky goddess who took the form of a cow was
among the earliest of Egyptian deities. The cow goddess under all her names
represented the loving and nurturing aspect of the divine. The king, and later
humanity in general, played the role of the calf of the divine cow.
From early times the king of Egypt was compared with the leading bull of a
herd, able to defeat all challengers. Bulls as fighters were particularly associated
with the war god Montu, who was manifest on earth as the Buchis bull. The
white bull of Min embodied male sexuality. The mysterious process of heredity
was celebrated in the concept of kings and gods being “the bulls of their moth
ers.” The Mnevis bull was the messenger of the creator sun god, Ra-Atum, who
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 123



engendered all life. The Apis bull was an earthly manifestation of the creator
god Ptah. The moon could be thought of as a virile young bull when it was wax
ing and as an old ox when it was waning.
Bull imagery was not entirely positive. Wild bulls were ritually hunted and
killed as symbols of the forces of chaos. In some accounts, Seth took bull form
to trample his brother Osiris to death. This Seth-bull was castrated by Anubis
and forced to carry the coffin of Osiris to burial. In the New Kingdom story the
Two Brothers, one of the brothers is called Bata, a name of Seth in his bull form.
This Bata transforms himself into a magnificent bull to visit the wife who has
deserted him to marry the king of Egypt. The queen persuades her husband to
sacrifice this bull in the hope of getting rid of Bata. He then transforms himself
into two beautiful trees that the Queen has cut down. She accidentally swal
lows a sliver of the wood and falls pregnant. The child turns out to be Bata re
born. Bata has become “the bull of his mother” and has fathered himself.
In the Pyramid Texts, “the great wild cow of the marshes” is the king’s
mother or wet nurse in the afterlife. In Pyramid Texts spell 485a, the dead king
is described as “the golden calf” of the milk goddess Hesat (Hezat). Two parallel

cow and calf myths developed. In one, the cow goddess Mehet-Weret (the Great
Flood) gave birth to the sun child in the primeval marsh at the dawn of time.
The great creator goddesses Hathor and Neith could both be identified with the
Mehet-Weret cow. Neith was said to have carried the infant sun god the length
of Egypt seated between her horns. In the second myth, the Ihet cow gave birth
to and suckled the infant god Horus in the marshes of Chemmis. The Ihet cow
was most commonly identified with Isis or Hathor. One of Seth’s many crimes
was stealing milk from the cow who suckled Horus.
Royal birth scenes show a pair of cow-headed goddesses suckling the new
born king and his ka. Life, stability, and power were said to enter the king with
the milk of the divine cow. From the Middle Kingdom onward, kings identified
with Horus in Chemmis by depicting themselves being suckled by a divine cow
hidden inside a papyrus thicket. Nonroyal people eventually became part of this
mythical archetype by showing themselves sheltering beneath the head of the
divine cow.
An Upper Egyptian deity called Bat (“female soul”) may have been the ear
liest cow goddess to be associated with sky. Her cult was later absorbed into
that of Hathor. Both Hathor and the sky goddess Nut could be imagined as a gi
gantic cow whose body was patterned with stars. The Book of the Heavenly
Cow describes how Nut first lifted the sun god into the heavens between her
horns. A red or gold solar disk is nearly always shown between the horns of cow
goddesses.
In graphic myths, the sun god sails along the belly of the cow each day. At
night he traveled through the inner sky along an underworld river that was
sometimes identified with Mehet-Weret.
The horned head of the sky cow acted as a symbol for the whole daily cycle
of the death and regeneration of the sun. The sky cow was the mother of the
cosmos, who gave birth to the diurnal and nocturnal forms of the sun.
A further elaboration of this idea turned the chest in which Osiris was re
generated into the body of a cow goddess called Shentayet. The ordinary dead
could hope to be welcomed into the underworld by other forms of the divine
cow. A bull, who may be Osiris, Lord of the Cows, and seven cows with names
such as the One of Chemmis and the One Who Is Great of Love feature in a
spell for “staying alive forever.”

CROCODILES
The Nile crocodile is one of the world’s largest reptiles. It was honored in some
regions of Ancient Egypt and despised in others. The best-known crocodile deity
was Sobek, but a number of gods and demons had awe-inspiring crocodile forms.
In some traditions, a crocodile was the first creature to emerge from the primeval
waters. Crocodiles could be symbols of the life-giving power of the primeval wa
ters or of the forces of chaos who tried to swallow up and destroy life.
Death by crocodile was particularly dreaded because the body would be de
voured. Epithets for crocodiles include “mouth of terror” and “the one who
seizes.” When they seized people, crocodiles were thought to be carrying out
the vengeance of the gods or the decrees of fate. Diodorus Siculus claimed that
crocodiles were revered in Egypt because one had saved King Menas (Menes)
when he was chased into Lake Moeris by his own dogs. This is very similar to
an incident in the New Kingdom Tale of the Doomed Prince, in which the
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology

prince has to jump into a lake when his trusted dog attacks him. The “crocodile
who was his fate” offers to save him in return for help against a water demon.
King Menas is said to have founded the city of Krokodilopolis in the Fayum
in gratitude for his escape. The Roman Period Book of the Fayum lists and illus
trates many of the crocodile cults of this region (see Figure 44). In the Fayum
there was a taboo against hunting crocodiles because “the ba (manifestation) of
Sobek is crocodiles.” Crocodiles were kept as sacred animals in some temples
and mummified after death.
At Athribis, the local crocodile god Khenty-Khety came to be regarded as a
form of Horus. Yet on magical stelae, Horus the Savior was asked to “drive
away all the crocodiles of the river.” At Edfu, crocodiles were reviled as
Followers of Seth. A crocodile son of Seth called Maga was a fearsome opponent
for Horus, son of Osiris. In temple texts at Edfu, the king promises to kill all
crocodiles and crush their eggs.
In the afterlife, the souls of the dead had to evade the Crocodiles of the Four
Directions, who were enemies of the four bas of the sun god. In enigmatic
scenes in New Kingdom royal tombs, the nocturnal sun has to pass through the
body of the crocodile Penwenti, who symbolizes the primeval waters, in order
to be reborn. Greek and Roman writers recorded a bizarre Egyptian belief that
ichneumons (a type of mongoose) killed crocodiles by running down their
throats and gnawing their way out through the bowels. This may be a misun
derstanding of the mythical conflict between the sun god Ra in the form of an
ichneumon and Apophis in the form of a crocodile or a snake.

DJED PILLAR
The djed was one of the most common of Egyptian symbols. It was used in the
hieroglyphic script to write a word that means “stability” or “immutability.”
The original djed may have been a pillar made from reeds or sheaves of corn,
but in time it came to be thought of as the backbone of the murdered god
Osiris. The djed was sometimes personified as a separate god known as “the au
gust djed.”
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 127



Some early uses of the djed symbol imply that it could be thought of as a
pillar holding the sky above the earth. Once a year the reigning king joined in a
ceremony at Memphis to raise a tall djed column by pulling on ropes. Ptah, the
chief god of Memphis, carried a scepter that combines the djed with an ankh,
the symbol of life. Life, stability, and power were the three qualities that gods
traditionally bestowed on kings. Raising the djed column was also part of the
Heb Sed (jubilee festival) through which an aging king’s powers were renewed.
On some occasions the raising of the djed was preceded by a mock combat be
tween people representing the opposing forces of order and chaos.
By the New Kingdom, the djed was closely associated with the mythology
of Osiris. The taboo subject of the murder of Osiris could be alluded to by say
ing that Seth had “laid the djed on its side.” Scenes in temples or royal tombs
show the god Horus (or the king playing the role of Horus) raising the djed col
umn to help his father Osiris to rise from the dead. The Book of the Dead con
tains a spell to be spoken over a gold djed amulet hung round the neck of a
mummy. This spell promises that the dead person will get back the use of his or
her spine and be able to sit up again like Osiris. A djed column was sometimes
painted on the bottom of coffins for the same reason. Model djed columns be
came one of the amulets most commonly placed on mummies.

EYE OF RA
The Ancient Egyptian word for eye (irt) sounded like a word for “doing” or “act
ing.” This may be why the eyes of a deity are associated with divine power at its
most interventional. Since the word irt was feminine in gender, divine eyes were
personified as goddesses. In different contexts, the eyes of the creator were iden
tified with various celestial bodies, such as the disk of the sun, the full moon,
the morning star, and Sopdet (Sirius). These celestial eyes could all be shown as
the part-hawk, part-human eye known as the wedjat eye (see Figure 12). The Eye
of Ra was regarded as Ra’s daughter and protector. This Eye goddess was associ

ated with both fire and water.
Her fiery glance destroyed the en
emies of the divine order while
her tears created life.
After the primordial creator
god Atum had produced Shu and
Tefnut, they became lost in the
watery darkness of the nun.
Atum sent his Eye to find them
“and gave light to darkness.”
This act was sometimes inter
preted as the first sunrise and the
moment when Atum was united
with Ra to become the creator
sun god. In the earliest versions
of the myth, the Eye that was
sent forth may have been
thought of as the morning star
that precedes the sunrise.
The Eye returned with Shu
and Tefnut, but wept with rage
when she saw that Ra-Atum had
grown a new solar eye: the
Glorious One. Human beings
were created from the tears of
the angry Eye or from the tears
of joy shed by Ra-Atum’s new
eye (see “The Creation of
Humanity” under “Linear Time”
in “Mythical Time Lines”). Ra
Atum placated the angry Eye by placing her on his forehead as the uraeus.
Shown as a cobra coiled around the sun disk, she was more powerful than all
other deities.
Important goddesses such as Hathor, Bastet, and Mut can be called both the
Eye of Atum and the Eye of Ra. Other Egyptian texts refer to these two eyes as
if they were separate entities. This may be to distinguish between the creative
and destructive aspect of the Eye goddess. The pupil of the Eye could be thought
of as a womb in which gods and other beings were formed. A child or a dwarf
can be shown inside the Eye, representing the sun that will be born in the red
sky of dawn.

The unblinking gaze of the Eye of Ra could embody the dangerous aspects
of the sun’s heat. The rays of the sun were compared with arrows shot by a di
vine archer to destroy the wicked. They could dry up the water of life and turn
fertile land into desert. A myth with many variants deals with a quarrel be
tween Ra and his daughter, the Eye goddess. She goes off into the deserts to the
south or west of Egypt and lives as a savage lion or a wild cat (see “The Distant
Goddess” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). The sudden disap
pearance of the Eye of Ra has been interpreted by some Egyptologists as a solar
eclipse.
Ra misses his daughter and needs his Eye to defend himself against the
forces of chaos and the rebels among humanity. He sends one or more of the
gods on a dangerous mission to retrieve the wandering goddess. The ferocious
goddess is pacified by Thoth, Shu, or Onuris and persuaded to return to Egypt.
In the Greco-Roman Period, the return of the Eye goddess was linked with the
heliacal rising of Sirius that signaled the coming of the dangerous but life-giving
Nile flood.
The goddess is given an ecstatic welcome by all creation and is reconciled
with her father. She then becomes his consort and the mother of a divine child
who will be the new form of the sun god. In some places a pair of goddesses was
worshipped as the aggressive and pacified forms of the Eye of Ra, such as Satet
and Anuket at Aswan and Ayet and Nehemetawy at Herakleopolis.
On many occasions the Eye goddess fought on behalf of her father, Ra.
When part of humanity rebelled against the aging sun god, the Eye was sent
down as Sekhmet, the raging lioness, to destroy the rebels (see “The
Destruction of Humanity” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”).
Such was her ferocity that she had to be tricked into returning to her father to
prevent her from devouring all of humanity. In the fight against the Apophis
monster, the Eye of Ra fought him under many names such as Bastet, lady of
terror; Wadjyt, the Devouring Flame; Sekhmet, the Glorious Eye; and Wosret,
the Great One.
The feline Eye goddess also represented royal power at its most brutal.
Kings were described as striking down their enemies as Sekhmet had destroyed
the enemies of Ra. Satirical cartoons that showed valiant mice winning a war
against cats may have been a coded way of expressing the hope that ordinary
Egyptians could overcome royal tyranny.

EYES OF HORUS
The Horus eye combines a human eye and eyebrow with some of the facial
markings of a falcon (see Figure 12). Such eyes are used for the animal forms of
various deities associated with the sky. When Horus was imagined as a celestial
falcon, his right eye was the sun and his left eye was the moon. In Ancient
Egyptian, the word for eye is a feminine noun, so the eyes of male deities could
be personified as goddesses. The temporary loss or mutilation of one or both of
the eyes of Horus was a common theme in Egyptian myth. The aggressor was
usually named as Seth, and the attack put the whole cosmos in danger. Horus
was sometimes said to have rescued his own eye, but the idea that it was re
stored by another deity was more common. This “whole” or “completed” eye
was known as the wedjat (udjat). The wedjat eye could represent almost any
aspect of the divine order, including kingship and the offerings made to the gods
and the dead. It also became one of the most popular of all Egyptian amulets.
Two versions of Horus are known: with eyes (Khenty-irty) and without
eyes (Khenty-en-irty). They could be represented by an ichneumon, an animal
noted for its keen sight, and a type of eyeless shrew. The vengeful Horus
Khenty-en-irty was one of the gods who perpetually tortured the evil dead.
Horus the Elder was said to have one green eye and a “lesser” white eye. Green
was sometimes equivalent to red in Egyptian symbolism, so this was the solar
eye. The white (or silver) eye was the moon. The red and white crowns of
Egyptian kings could be equated with the solar and lunar eyes. From the Old
Kingdom onward, pairs of wedjat eyes were painted on coffins for the deceased
to look out through. The glare of these celestial eyes also had apotropaic force
to protect the deceased.
As with the murder of Osiris, the wounding of the lunar eye is never very
clearly described. Some passages in the Pyramid Texts speak of Seth devouring
or trampling the “lesser eye.” Others imply that Seth gouged out the pupil of
the eye of Horus with his finger or caused it to bleed or weep. A later tradition
had Seth in the form of a black boar swallowing the eye or causing it to go blind
with rage.
When Horus is treated as the vulnerable son of Isis rather than as the cos
mic falcon, the narratives are more explicit. In the Contendings of Horus and
Seth, Seth tears out both the eyes of Horus to punish him for beheading his
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 131



mother in a fit of rage. Seth buries the eyes on a mountainside where they grow
into lotus flowers. Meanwhile, the goddess Hathor heals Horus with gazelle
milk and restores his eyes. A similar story in Papyrus Jumilhac has Anubis bury
boxes containing the eyes of Horus on a mountainside. Isis waters the eyes to
bring them back to life, creating the first grape vines in the process. This myth
reenforces the common ritual identification of the Eye of Horus with the wine,
food, and perfumes offered to the gods in temples. The growth of useful plants
from the buried eyes of Horus is a parallel to the growth of barley and wheat
from the body of his father, Osiris.
Myths that involve a single lunar Eye of Horus often name Thoth as the
god who rescued it from under the earth or under water. At some point, the eye
must have been torn apart like the body of Osiris, since Thoth is said to have
put the pieces together again. The six parts of the wedjat eye (pupil, brow, and
so on) were used in the hieroglyphic script to write the fractions that made up
the standard grain measure. Rituals of counting and completing the Eye of
Horus were performed in temples every month, linking it to the lunar cycle.
Once the eye was restored to Horus, he used it to revive his murdered fa
ther, Osiris. In commemoration of this event, a wedjat eye was often placed
over the evisceration wound on a mummy to make the body whole again.
Horus the Physician and Thoth, the Physician of the Eye of Horus, were asked
to heal all kinds of ailments. Drugs used in Egyptian medicine were prescribed
in measurements based on the wedjat eye. An abbreviated version of the Eye of
Horus is still used by pharmacists as a symbol of their profession.

FELINE DEITIES
Many Egyptian deities were represented by predators of the cat family (felidae).
There were North African and Near Eastern species of lions, and leopards and
cheetahs were found to the south of Egypt. Smaller cat species, such as servals,
inhabited the deserts or marshes. One of these species, felis silvestris libyca,
seems to have been domesticated by the Egyptians by around 2000 BCE. Cats
were chiefly prized for their ability to kill pests such as rats, mice, and snakes.
Similar predators, such as mongooses and genets, seem to have been regarded as

members of the cat family by the Egyptians. The characteristics of several feline
species were sometimes combined in a single image.
Lion gods were not as important as lion goddesses, but the lion was an an
cient symbol of royal power. Male leopards and panthers (black leopards) were
associated with the uncontrollable rage of the god Seth, whereas female leop
ards played a protective role. Leonine goddesses usually have a short mane or
ruff like that of a lynx or an adolescent male lion. Since they function as a man
ifestation of the wrath of the sun god, their gender is ambiguous. The lion was a
component of Egyptian monsters such as Bes and Taweret, the sphinx and the
griffin. These mythical creatures were invoked as magical guardians of people
and places. There are many mentions in the Pyramid Texts of the deity Ruty
(Double Lion) who guarded the horizon, the place of regeneration for deities and
kings. This deity may derive from earlier images of a pair of leopards or pan
thers who seem to represent the sky. By the New Kingdom, the spotted leopard
lions of the horizon were identified with the first divine couple, Shu and
Tefnut. An alternative representation of the place of the sun’s birth was a pair of
striped cats flanking a lotus flower.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 133

Many other feline deities acted as ferocious guardians. According to a tem
ple ritual, the body of Osiris was guarded by four lion goddesses: Wadjyt,
Sekhmet, Bastet, and Shesmetet (Smithis). In the Pyramid Texts the goddess
Mafdet helps the dead king by clawing out the eyes of evil snakes. Her sacred
animal may originally have been some kind of mongoose, but she was later de
picted as a cheetah or a lynx. As the divine executioner, Mafdet served justice
by running down and slaughtering the “enemies of Ra.” Her symbol was a har
poon fixed to a block.
The Coffin Texts mention Pakhet the Great who hunts by night as a li
oness or a panther. Her name means “the one who scratches.” The claw
amulets worn by Egyptian queens and princesses may evoke the protective
might of this goddess. The lion-headed Barque of Pakhet provided an escort for
the solar barque. Like other feline deities, she could also take the form of the
fire-spitting cobra who protected the sun god’s heirs.
Unnamed lions, lionesses, panthers, and cats are shown on magical objects
fighting the traditional enemies of the divine order (see, for example, Figure 30).
The images of lions and cats tearing out the throats of foreign captives may al
lude to the myth of the Eye of Ra being sent down in her lion form (Sekhmet) to
destroy the humans who had rebelled against the sun god. Other goddesses who
could be identified with the lion form of the creator’s eye included Bastet,
Hathor, Mehit, Mut, Tefnut, and Wadjyt.
When the eye who was the first-born daughter of Ra became alienated from
her father, she wandered the deserts in the form of a lion or a cat (see “The
Distant Goddess” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). A relief in
the temple of el-Dakka in Nubia showed this goddess with the full mane of a
lion and the swollen teats of a nursing lioness. In this form she was dangerous
even to other deities. Those she devoured would be annihilated forever, with no
hope of rebirth. In her cat form she was a fierce fighter but a force for good. The
myth of Thoth and Shu luring the Distant Goddess back to Egypt with promises
of food and comfort mirrors the way the Egyptians had transformed wild cats
into pets.
It was in cat form that the daughter of Ra assisted her father in an epic bat
tle against the chaos monster Apophis. One terrible night Ra himself took the
form of the Great Tom Cat and fought the Apophis serpent under the ished tree
at Heliopolis. He sliced up Apophis with his knife and split the ished tree in
two, creating the twin trees of the horizon (see Figure 22).
In her pacified form, the feline daughter of Ra united with the creator sun
god to produce a divine child. At Bubastis, the lion god Mahes (Mihos, Myusis)
was the cub of Bastet and Atum-Ra. In the first millennium BCE, Bastet was in
creasingly represented as a fertile mother, suckling or surrounded by many kit

GEB
Geb was the chief earth god and the mate of the sky goddess Nut. They were the
children of Shu and Tefnut, the first divine couple. Geb and Nut formed the
third generation in the group of nine gods who made up the Ennead of
Heliopolis. In the early stages of creation, the earth god and the sky goddess were
locked in a passionate embrace. The forcible separation of Geb and Nut by their
father Shu was one of the most important cosmic events in Egyptian myth.
Geb was nearly always shown in human form. His skin could be painted
green, probably to symbolize the plants that “come forth from the body of
Geb.” Living creatures were said to “crawl on the back of Geb.” None of these
life-forms could come into being until Shu separated Geb and Nut so that air
and light could exist between them. After their separation, Geb and Nut be
came the parents of five divine children: Osiris, Horus the Elder, Seth, Isis, and
Nephthys. As a sky goddess, Nut was also considered to be the mother of all
heavenly bodies, so Geb was sometimes called the “father” of the sun god Ra.
In the Book of Nut, Geb is said to be appalled by Nut’s habit of eating her chil
dren. He is rebuked by the sun god, who explains that Nut’s behavior is a neces
sary part of the cycle of death and rebirth.
Geb himself was said to swallow up the dead, and he was in charge of the
dangerous snakes who lived under the earth. Like other chthonic deities, Geb
could be a terrifying god, responsible for destructive earthquakes. The cere
mony of “hacking the ground” was said to honor Geb but may in origin have
been a rite to subdue the dangerous earth god. A myth found only in an inscrip
tion of the fourth century BCE tells how Geb violently rebelled against his par
ents. He seized the throne from Shu and forced Tefnut to be his queen. Geb as
sumed most of the divine regalia of Ra but was bitten by the fiery serpent who
guarded the sun god and all legitimate rulers.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 135



It was more common to regard Geb as the appointed “heir of the gods” and
the leader of the Great Ennead. He was seen as the chief of the inhabitants of
earth. Egyptian kings were said to sit on “the throne of Geb.” Geb was usually
the main judge in the great dispute between the rival gods Horus and Seth. Geb
continued this role as a judge of the dead in the afterlife. Those found guilty of
being “enemies of Ra” were tied to the “stakes of Geb” to be executed. As the
father of Osiris, Geb could be invoked to provide fatherly help to all dead per
sons who were ritually identified with Osiris.

HAPY (HAPI)
A deity or group of deities who embodied the life-giving power of the inunda
tion, Hapy was usually depicted as a very fat man with pendulous breasts and
blue or green skin. Though Egypt was totally dependent on the annual Nile
flood, the inundation god was not a high-ranking deity.
The river Nile was thought of as flowing out of the primeval waters (the
nun) that continued to encircle the world. Hymns and spells credit the creator
with making the Nile rise each year so that the fields of Egypt could be irri
gated. The flood was said to come from two caverns that were imprints of the
creator’s sandals. The god Khnum was in charge of these “secret caverns of
Hapy.”
The potentially destructive aspect of the flood could be embodied by the
solar lioness known as the Distant Goddess. The powers of the flood to irrigate
and fertilize the Nile valley were represented by Hapy. For this reason, Hapy
has been called a “fecundity figure” rather than a Nile god. Some Egyptologists
interpret Hapy as an androgynous deity, whereas others see his peculiar body
shape as signifying abundance. Hapy can appear as a single deity but is most of

ten shown in pairs or groups. Temples were often decorated with rows of fecun
dity figures carrying the produce of each district of Egypt.
Hymns to Hapy point out that every aspect of Egyptian life was dependent
on the food that he brought. All creatures are said to rejoice at his arrival: frogs
croak, bulls bellow, and crocodiles roar. Hapy is called the Lord of Fishes, the
one “who greens the Two Banks,” and “the maker of barley and wheat.” Hapy’s
life-giving waters were also credited with a role in reviving the murdered god
Osiris, who came back each year with the barley.

HATHOR (H. WT-H. R)
Hathor was the golden goddess who helped women to give birth, the dead to be
reborn, and the cosmos to be renewed. This complex deity could function as the
mother, consort, and daughter of the creator sun god. Many lesser goddesses
came to be regarded as “names” of Hathor in her contrasting benevolent and de
structive aspects. She was most commonly shown as a beautiful woman wear
ing a red solar disk between a pair of cow’s horns.
Hathor’s name means “domain (or mansion) of Horus,” which may make
her the original mother of the celestial falcon. In the Pyramid Texts, the domain
of Horus was a special part of the sky where the dead king would be rejuve
nated. As Lady of the Stars, Hathor was associated with the nocturnal sky. As
the Eye of Ra, she could be identified with the solar disk or the morning or
evening star (Venus). By the Greco-Roman Period, Hathor was honored as a
moon deity. She was the goddess of all precious metals, gemstones, and materi
als that shared the radiant qualities of celestial bodies, such as gold, silver, cop
per, turquoise, lapis-lazuli, and faience.
In Pyramid Texts spell 406, the Eye of Ra (here the solar disk) is “upon the
horns of Hathor.” This seems to be an early reference to the myth of the sun
god being lifted up into the heavens on the head of the celestial cow. Another
divine cow, Mehet-Weret, who was often regarded as a primeval form of Hathor,
had given birth to the sun god and lifted him above the primeval waters. Hathor
could also be identified with the alternative image of the primeval lotus from
which the sun child emerged in the first dawn. She could be worshipped as the
“mother” of all child gods, such as Nefertem, Ihy, and Harsomatus, whose birth
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 137



was a celebration of the ability of the cosmos to renew itself. Horus performed a
similar function for kingship, and Hathor was often shown as a cow maternally
protecting the youthful Horus-king inside a papyrus thicket. The power to rule
entered Horus with the milk of Hathor.
By giving birth to the sun child, Hathor became her own mother (or grand
mother) since she traditionally came into being as the Eye of Ra, the adult form
of the sun god. The Eye of Ra was often described as “the Daughter of Ra who
protects her father.” Hathor was called the Foremost One in the Barque of
Millions because she stood in the prow of the solar barque leading its defense
against the chaos serpent Apophis. Ra sent his Eye to punish the rebellious de
scendants of the humans who had been created from the tears of the Eye (see
“The Creation of Humanity” and “The Destruction of Humanity” under
“Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). In her savage lion form, the Eye had
to be rendered drunk before she could return to the heavens as beautiful, gra
cious Hathor.
The Distant Goddess who abandoned Ra to live in feline form in the deserts
beyond Egypt could also be named as Hathor. This identification came relatively
late, but Hathor had long been regarded as the goddess of foreign lands and their
products. When the Distant Goddess returned, she brought the inundation with
her, but she had to be pacified with music, dancing, feasting, and drunkenness.
This was the mythical justification for the wild, ecstatic elements in Hathor’s
cult. It was proper for the whole of creation to rejoice when Hathor appeared
again in all her radiant beauty and joined forces with her father.
The union of Hathor and the creator could be thought of in sexual terms or,
more abstractly, as a merging of the creator with his own active power. Hathor
was the goddess who personified both the hand that made Atum ejaculate and
the divine “seed” itself. As the female creative principle, she could be the most
seductive and alluring of deities. This erotic side of her nature made Hathor the
patroness of lovers in Egyptian poetry and justified the Greeks in identifying her
with Aphrodite.
In the Contendings of Horus and Seth, the sun god Pre (Ra) becomes angry
when he is insulted by the baboon god Babi and lies down on his back. This im
plies that the creator sun god was sinking back into the inert state that would
mean the end of the world. Hathor, Lady of the Southern Sycamore, visits her
father Pre and shows him her genitals. He immediately laughs, gets up, and
goes back to administering maat (justice). Hathor has aroused the sun god and
driven away his evil mood.
The Underworld Books present Ra and his daughter in less human terms.
As the goddess of the West, Hathor welcomes the setting sun into her out
stretched arms. For both gods and people, Hathor eased the transition from

138



death to new life. The time and manner of a person’s death was decreed by a
sevenfold form of Hathor. As Lady of the Necropolis, she opened the gates of
the underworld. As a tree goddess, she revived the newly dead with shade, air,
water, and food. The spirits of the dead could imbibe eternal life from the milk
of the seven Hathor cows.
The Coffin Texts and the Book of the Dead have spells to help the deceased
live forever as a follower of Hathor. In a Late Period story, Hathor rules the un
derworld, emerging to punish those who behave unjustly on earth. By the
Greco-Roman Period, dead women in the afterlife identified themselves with
Hathor instead of Osiris. It was only after Isis took over many of her attributes
that Hathor lost her place as the most important of Egyptian goddesses.

HEQET (HEQAT, HEKAT)
Heqet was a frog goddess who helped women to give birth and the dead to be re
born. The knife-wielding frogs shown on ivory wands are probably Heqet in her
role as defender of women and children. Heqet, Mistress of Joy, was among the

followers of the inundation god
Hapy when he brought new life
to Egypt each year. The Roman
writer Pliny the Elder noted an
Egyptian belief that frogs were
spontaneously generated from
the mud left by the receding Nile
flood. Heqet came to be wor
shipped as a goddess of the
primeval slime who gave birth to
the sun god.
Heqet was regarded as the
female counterpart of the creator
god Khnum, and the two are
linked in a Middle Kingdom
royal-birth myth. The sun god
Ra sends a group of deities to
assist a woman called Ruddedet
giving birth to three children
who are destined to be kings.
Four goddesses—Isis, Nephthys,
Meskhenet, and Heqet—disguise
themselves as dancing girls while
Khnum pretends to be their ser
vant. At the house of Ruddedet,
her distraught husband asks
them for help because his wife’s labor is so painful and difficult. The deities
lock themselves in the room with Ruddedet, and Heqet “hastens the birth” of
the royal triplets. Isis names the children, Meskhenet predicts their fate, and
Khnum makes them strong and healthy. The deities create three crowns for the
triplets and hide them in a sack of barley before returning to the divine realm.
The story implies that the children were sired by Ra, and they grow up to be the
sun-worshipping kings of the Fifth Dynasty.
In New Kingdom royal-birth myths, Heqet gives life to the body and ka of
the royal infant shaped on the potter’s wheel of Khnum. In temples of the first
millennium BCE, Heqet is shown assisting goddesses give birth to divine chil
dren. At Abydos, Heqet was revered for helping Isis bring Horus into the world
and for assisting the murdered god Osiris to be reborn. All Egyptians hoped that
after they died Heqet would act as a divine midwife at their rebirth.

HERYSHEF (ARSAPHES, HARSAPHES)
Heryshef was a ram god who was the local deity of the important town of
Herakleopolis Magna (Hnes). His name means “he who is upon his lake.” From
early times Heryshef was worshipped as a creator god rising out of the nun. Like
some other ram gods, he could be regarded as a manifestation of Osiris.
The Coffin Texts refer to Heryshef as Lord of Blood and Butchery. He is
shown on ivory wands among the fearsome deities who can act as magical pro
tectors. During the first millennium BCE, Heryshef was revered as a cosmic de
ity whose eyes were the sun and the moon.
In one text, Osiris-Heryshef is crowned king at Herakleopolis. He sits on
the throne of Ra to receive the homage of all the other deities. Even his rival,
Seth, bows down to him, though it makes his nose bleed with rage. Osiris
Heryshef falls ill because he cannot control the power of the headdress of Ra,
and his head swells painfully. Ra cures him by letting out the pus and blood,
and this is said to be the origin of the famous sacred lake at Herakleopolis.
A fragmentary New Kingdom tale has Heryshef appear to the hero Meryra
to ask for his help in a fight against a divine falcon. In a later text, an Egyptian
priest living among the Persians claims to have been summoned back to Egypt
by a dream-vision of Heryshef. The priest credits Heryshef with helping
Alexander the Great to conquer the Persians. When the Greeks settled in Egypt,
they identified Heryshef with their deified hero Herakles (Hercules).

HIPPOPOTAMUS GODDESSES
The male hippopotamus was feared by the Egyptians as a destructive force, but
the female hippopotamus was respected as a fierce protector of her young and
the embodiment of the life-giving power of water. Several hippopotamus god
desses are known, such as Ipet (Opet), Reret, and Taweret (Taurt, Thoeris), but
they are probably just aspects of the same goddess. This goddess could also
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 141



manifest herself in dual or group forms. As Taweret (the Great One) she was
usually shown with a combination of hippopotamus, lion, crocodile, and hu
man features. This monstrous form was a popular type of amulet for 2,000 years
and passed into other cultures as a protective genie.
The Egyptians saw hippopotami as water pigs rather than water horses, so
Reret means “the sow.” This provides a link with the sky goddess Nut, who
also had a sow form. All manifestations of the hippopotamus goddess were as
sociated with the watery regions of the sky, the earth, and the underworld. She
was sometimes equated with Hathor Mehet-Weret, the cow goddess who repre
sented the fertile aspect of the primeval waters (the nun). Mehet-Weret, Nut,
and the hippopotamus goddess could all be thought of as giving birth to the cre
ator sun god. In the secret crypts of the Temple of Ipet at Karnak, the hippopota
mus goddess was said to give birth to a solar form of Osiris who rose again as
Amun-Ra. In the Pyramid Texts, the reborn king is nourished by the sweet milk
of Ipy (Ipet). During the Middle Kingdom and Second Intermediate Periods,
model hippopotami decorated with marsh flora were placed in tombs and tem
ples. These may represent Ipet or Taweret as the goddess of the primeval marsh
where all life began and the dead hoped to be reborn. The full breasts and belly
on composite figures of Taweret are probably those of the inundation god Hapy,
rather than those of a pregnant woman. By the New Kingdom, Taweret
“Mistress of Pure Water” purified, revived, and nourished the dead. The annual
Nile flood performed a similar service for the land of Egypt. A group of Reret
goddesses were among the exotic beings who celebrated the return of the
Distant Goddess who brought the inundation with her. In some versions of this
myth the returning solar lioness can be transformed into a hippopotamus god
dess when she reaches the marshy boundaries of Egypt.
Images on hippopotamus-ivory wands of the second millennium BCE may
allude to this myth and its aftermath when the goddess gives birth to a divine
child who is destined to rule. Taweret is shown among other “fighters” sav
aging foreign captives, brandishing knives or torches, or holding the sa symbol
of protection (see Figure 30). Her role as protector of the divine child is repeated
in later temple reliefs showing the birth and upbringing of kings and gods. She
usually appears in the birth chamber with the lion-dwarf Bes. On a magical
stela, Isis tells her son Horus that “a sow and a dwarf” were the protectors of
his infant body. By the Ptolemaic Period, Taweret had the title Lady of the Birth
House. Even great goddesses such as Hathor, Mut, and Isis sometimes took the
grotesque form of the Great One when they acted as saviors of the innocent.
The guilty, however, could expect no mercy from hippopotamus goddesses.
The female monster Ammut who devoured the souls of those who failed the
judgment of Osiris was a mixture of hippopotamus, lion, and crocodile. In the

HOREMAKHET (HARMACHIS)
Horemakhet was Horus in the Horizon, a solar form of the celestial falcon.
See under Horus; Sphinx
HORUS (HOR)
Horus was the celestial falcon and the embodiment of kingship. The conflict
between Horus and Seth, the Two Lords, was an enduring theme in Egyptian
myth. The name Horus probably means the “Distant One.” Two main forms of
Horus appear in the sources. These are sometimes regarded as separate gods, be
longing to different epochs, and sometimes as aspects of the same deity. Horus
the Great or Horus the Elder (Harwer/Haroeris) was a primeval being who initi
ated creation. As Lord of the Sky, his wings spanned the heavens, and his eyes
were the sun and the moon. This Horus is the son of a sky goddess, either Nut
or Hathor. Horus the Younger was the son of Isis who grew up to avenge his
murdered father, Osiris, and take his place as ruler of Egypt. He was usually
shown as a falcon-headed man. Each king of Egypt was acclaimed as a “living
Horus.”
Egypt’s earliest kings were shown as hawks preying on their enemies. Many
Egyptian deities could be represented by birds of the hawk family. The cults of
some of these gods, such as Nekheny of Hierakonpolis and Khenty-Khety of
Athribis, were gradually assimilated with that of Horus. One of the earliest di
vine images known from Egypt is that of a falcon in a barque. This probably rep
resents Horus as a star or planet crossing the Winding Waterway of the sky.
Later texts paint a dazzling picture of the One of Dappled Plumage who opened
his eyes to dispel darkness and chaos.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 143



Like other primeval deities, the celestial falcon coalesced with the creator
sun god. He then became Ra-Horakhty (Ra-Horus of the Double Horizon) who
triumphed over his enemies to rise in the east. The union of these two powers
could be symbolized by a falcon crowned with a sun disk or a sun disk with fal
con’s wings. When a king appeared to his subjects, it was compared with the
glorious rising of Horemakhet (Horus in the Horizon). The Two Lords, Horus
and Seth, were either named as brothers or as nephew and uncle. Many theories
have been advanced to explain the origins of their combat, from memories of an
ancient civil war to observations of storms or astronomical phenomena. When
the combatants are Horus the Elder, the celestial falcon, and Seth, the chaotic
god of storms, the conflict seems to belong to the primeval age when opposing
elements had to come together to create the divine order.
The necessity of Horus and Seth being reconciled is stressed in many
sources. One of the key images of royal art was Horus the Uniter and Seth tying
together the heraldic plants of Upper and Lower Egypt to symbolize the union
of the Two Lands into one perfect kingdom. The figure of Seth is sometimes re

placed by Thoth, an indication that Seth’s role as the slayer of Osiris could not
always be overlooked. When the great conflict is presented as a dynastic feud
between young Horus and his usurper uncle, Horus must triumph and Seth
must be punished so that justice and kingship can be established for humanity.
Harsiese (Horus, son of Isis) was destined to be king from the moment of
conception. His epithet, “Horus who is upon the papyrus,” alludes to the myth
that Isis hid the infant Horus in the papyrus thickets of Akh-bit (Chemmis), an
island among the marshes. This “nest of Horus” was guarded by divine beings
such as cow and scorpion goddesses. The young Horus grew up to become “the
Pillar of his Mother” and the “Avenger of his Father.” Advised by Isis, Horus
fought Seth in many different ways. He turned Seth’s sexual aggression to his
own advantage and overcame the temporary loss of the power inherent in his eye
(see “The Struggles of Horus and Seth” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time
Lines”). Horus argued his father’s case before the Divine Tribunal led by Geb or
the sun god Ra. Osiris is granted sovereignty over the dead and Horus over the
living. Horus, the devoted son, becomes the prototype for all funerary priests
when he performs a series of rituals to “raise up” Osiris. He also becomes an in
termediary between the worlds of the living and the dead. Horus is shown in the
Book of the Dead presenting deceased souls before the throne of Osiris.
The reign of Horus as king of Egypt was considered the model for all subse
quent reigns. The semidivine kings who came after him in mythical history
were called the Followers of Horus. In a few magical texts a scorpion goddess
called Ta-Bitjet is called the wife of Horus. A passage in the Coffin Texts makes
Horus the Elder and his sister, Isis, the parents of the four protective deities
known as the Sons of Horus. A festival at Edfu temple celebrated the “Beautiful
Union” between Horus and Hathor, Lady of Dendara. Here, Horus is an aspect
of the sun god uniting with the goddess who was his mother, his consort, and
his daughter to renew the cosmos.
Texts and scenes at Edfu illustrate the diversity of myths centered on
Horus. A mythical history of the temple relates how two mysterious beings
subdued the primeval swamp by cutting down reeds. When they stuck a reed in
the ground, it became a perch for the celestial falcon. The reed hut built to
house the falcon was said to be the center of the world and the first temple. In
the Legend of the Winged Disk, Horus (the Distant One) takes the role usually
given to the Distant Goddess and transforms himself into a fiery disk to blind
and destroy the sun god’s enemies. In the ritual drama known as the Triumph of
Horus, Horus, son of Isis, harpoons Seth in hippopotamus form. After a series of
battles by land and water, he drives Seth and his followers out of Egypt, just as
Egyptian kings hoped to drive out foreign invaders.

HORUS THE CHILD (HARPOKRATES, HARPOCRATES)
The posthumous son of the murdered Osiris by his sister-wife Isis was known
as Horus the Child. The Egyptian phrase Hor pa khered (“Horus the Child”)
was transliterated by the Greeks as Harpokrates. In Egyptian art little boys were
traditionally shown naked, with a shaven head and one plaited sidelock of hair,
so this is how Horus the Child appears. He was the most important of the child
gods who formed the third member of divine triads in many temples. Such
child gods had two main functions in Egyptian myth and iconography. The first
was to symbolize the renewal of the cosmos. The second was to overcome the
wild creatures who threatened the cosmic order. In both roles, child gods could
be interchangeable with dwarf gods.
The pregnancy of Isis was said to have been unusually long and her labor
painful and hard. Isis had to hide her infant in the papyrus thickets of the Delta
to preserve him from Seth, the killer of Osiris. This mirrored an earlier mythi
cal event: the emergence of the sun child in the lotus who had to be protected
from the monstrous inhabitants of the waters of chaos by a primeval goddess.
The sun child was destined to begin the work of creation during the first sun
rise, and the Horus child was destined to establish the divine order on earth
when he grew up to be Egypt’s rightful king. Both children were powerful sym
bols of hope for the future, and imagery passed freely between them.
A spell in the Pyramid Texts for repelling snakes refers to Horus, “the in
fant with a finger in his mouth.” Egyptian kings were closely identified with
the infant and youthful stages of the life cycle of Horus. Pepy II (c. 2278–2184
BCE) seems to have been the first king to be shown as the Horus child, either
squatting naked with his finger to his lips or sitting on his mother’s lap.
Powerful rulers of the Middle and New Kingdoms acknowledged their depen
dence on the gods by depicting themselves as the young Horus suckling from

the divine cow in the papyrus thicket. During the first millennium BCE, child
gods were often shown seated on the lap of a divine mother who could be iden
tified with many different goddesses. At Dendara, Ihy and Harsomatus (“Horus,
Uniter of the Two Lands”) were children of Hathor. At Medamud, Horus the
Child was the son of the solar goddess Raet-tawy. Such child gods had to propi
tiate or overcome their terrifying mothers before they could assume power in
their own right.
The more forceful aspect of these child gods could be represented by a form
of Horus known as Shed (the Savior). He appeared on stelae of the late New
Kingdom dressed as a prince who vanquished dangerous animals with his bow or
curved sword. This was a forerunner of the type of magical stela known as a cip
pus. On these, the naked Horus child tramples on crocodiles and squeezes the
life out of other dangerous creatures such as snakes, lions, and antelopes (see
Figure 16). When the Greeks saw such objects, they identified Horus the
Child/Harpokrates with the infant Herakles (Hercules) who strangled two
snakes that attacked him in his cradle. In the Roman Period, Harpokrates be
came a popular amuletic symbol, often carved on magical gems. He was revered
as a god of dawn, which was thought to be the most effective time to perform
magical spells.
Plutarch (c. 46–126 CE) thought that Harpokrates was a second son of Isis
who had been born prematurely with deformed legs. The Horus figures on
cippi often have a body that resembles that of the bandy-legged dwarf god Bes.
A mask of Bes is found on most cippi, and Horus the Child seems to have
taken over Bes’s role as one who drove off demons and protected women and
children. In spite of the triumphant visual image of the Horus child overcom
ing chaotic animals, the texts on cippi and magical statues usually describe
how Horus was poisoned by a snake or a scorpion. His mother, Isis, has to use
her magic or call on the power of the creator sun god to heal him. The healing
of Horus the Child came to represent a promise by the gods to take care of suf
fering humanity.

IMHOTEP (IMOUTHES)
Imhotep was a high official of the twenty-seventh century BCE who was later de
ified as a god of knowledge and healing. Imhotep is mentioned in a Middle
Kingdom text as one of the sages whose memory lives on through their writ
ings. He became a role model for scribes and was credited with the invention of
architecture in stone. Imhotep was usually represented as a man in priestly cos
tume with an open book-scroll on his lap.
In the Late Period, a mythology grew up to explain Imhotep’s extraordinary
talents. His mother, Kheredankhw (Kherduankh), described in one text as a
beautiful singer, was said to have conceived Imhotep by the god Ptah. Son of
Ptah became a standard epithet for Imhotep, though normally only kings were
called “sons” of gods. By the Ptolemaic Period, Kheredankhw is occasionally re
ferred to as a daughter of Banebdjedet, the ram god of Mendes. There was proba
bly a story cycle about Imhotep’s birth that is now lost. An inscription from
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
148

may represent a priest playing the role of Imhotep. (Courtesy of Richard Pinch)



Saqqara gives the main events of Imhotep’s story as: his birth; being presented
as a child to his father, Ptah, and his divine stepmother, Sekhmet; defeating the
Asiatics with the help of Sekhmet; his death and mummification; and his ap
pearance as a god.
The Greeks identified Imhotep with their god of medicine, Asclepius. The
supposed tomb of Imhotep in the desert near Memphis and a nearby temple, the
Asklepion, became places of pilgrimage for sick people and childless couples.
Hippocrates, the founder of Greek medicine, is said to have been inspired by
books kept in the temple of Imhotep at Memphis. Priests of Imhotep were con
sulted about the meaning of dreams. Imhotep was said to appear to dreamers as
a shining human figure or as a scarab. In a story inscribed on a Ptolemaic stela,
it is not clear whether it is Imhotep himself or a priest of Imhotep who inter
prets King Djoser’s dream of seven fat and seven thin cattle and discovers the
origins of the Nile.
Imhotep remained a popular deity in the Roman Period. A surviving frag
ment from a story cycle has Imhotep use magic to defeat an Assyrian queen.
His association with architecture was remembered by calling him the skillful
fingered one “who fixed the plans of the mansions of the gods.” The philosophi
cal text known as the Asclepius is a dialogue between Imhotep/Asclepius and
Thoth/Hermes about the secrets of the universe. Three thousand years after his
death, Imhotep was still celebrated as the embodiment of Egyptian wisdom.

ISIS
The protective mother of Horus and the loyal wife of Osiris, Isis was part of the
fourth generation in the Ennead of Heliopolis: the children of Geb and Nut. She
was most commonly shown as a woman wearing the throne symbol that helps
to write her name. As the “throne goddess,” she was the mother of each
Egyptian king. Her maternal tenderness eventually included all humanity, and
Isis became more widely worshipped than any other Egyptian deity.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 149



It is not clear whether Isis featured in the earliest myths about Osiris and
Horus. At some important cult centers of Osiris, such as Abydos, her role was a
marginal one until the New Kingdom. By that era, Osiris, Isis, and Horus had de
veloped into a true divine family, if a markedly dysfunctional one. The kind of
unselfish love that Isis displays toward Osiris and Horus is rare in Egyptian myth.
The Pyramid Texts do allude to Isis searching Egypt for the body of Osiris
after he had been struck down by his brother Seth. Some of the spells promise
that Isis will save the dead king’s body from putrefaction or reassemble his scat
tered bones, just as she had the corpse of Osiris. Isis and her sister, Nephthys,
kept a long vigil over the restored corpse and became the prototypes for all
mourners. A New Kingdom hymn tells of Isis using spoken magic to drive away
“the disturber” (Seth) and protect her husband’s body. Like the creator deity
Atum, she is able to produce life without an active partner. She stimulates the
“inertness” of Osiris and takes his seed into her body to conceive a son.
An earlier version of this event in Coffin Texts spell 148 has Horus con
ceived by a flash of divine fire. Isis knows at once that she is carrying a son who
will overcome Seth. She hides Horus in the marshes of Chemmis and brings
him up to avenge his father. The conflicting ties of love and kinship suffered by
Isis are described in the New Kingdom narrative, the Contendings of Horus and
Seth. Isis intervenes when Horus and Seth fight in the form of hippopotami. She
stabs Seth with her magical harpoon but spares him when he reminds her that

they are brother and sister. Angered by this betrayal, Horus cuts his mother’s
head off. It takes more than this to kill Isis. The gods give her a new head,
sometimes that of a cow.
By contrast, most sources of the first millennium BCE make Isis the impla
cable enemy of Seth. She takes many forms to lure, hunt down, and destroy
Seth and his followers. The joy of Isis when the Divine Tribunal finally made
Horus king became proverbial. The myth that Horus repaid his mother by rap
ing her seems strange, but each king had to take possession of the throne god
dess and beget a repeat of himself.
Magical and literary texts stress the cunning and determination of Isis. As
Weret-Hekau (the Great of Magic) she could be shown as a cobra suckling and
protecting kings. She was “cleverer than millions of gods” and a better guardian
of Egypt’s borders “than millions of soldiers.” In the Contendings of Horus and
Seth, Isis transforms herself into an old woman to fool the divine ferryman and
a young girl to trick Seth into making damaging admissions. In the story known
as the True Name of Ra (see “Period of Direct Rule by the Creator Sun God”
under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”), Isis is able to turn the sun
god’s own power against him to get what she wants. In several dramatic spells
Isis is reimagined as an ordinary woman forced to leave her child alone in the
marshes while she begs for food. When Horus is poisoned, she stops the
progress of the solar barque across the heavens until he is cured.
By the later New Kingdom, Isis was often shown in the solar barque with
Ra. This was one of the roles she took over from the goddess Hathor. The cult
of Isis became more and more prominent during the first millennium BCE. She
began to be honored as the goddess of the sea, responsible for bringing ships
safely to harbor. The Greeks identified Isis with Demeter, the harvest goddess
who perpetually searched for a lost child. In her stellar form of Sopdet/Sothis,
Isis had always been linked with the coming of the inundation that made the
harvest possible. She was now credited with inventing agriculture and all man
ner of useful crafts and institutions.
According to hymns of the Greco-Roman Period, it was Isis who made the
world and decreed that men should love women and children should love their
parents. All other goddesses became merely “names” of Isis. In his book
“Concerning Isis and Osiris,” Plutarch suggested that the all-powerful Isis al
lowed herself to be portrayed as a woman of sorrows to console suffering hu
manity. This, and her promise to believers of a happy afterlife, made the Isis
cult the closest rival to Christianity in the early centuries of the first millen
nium CE.

KHEPRI (KHEPRY, KHOPRI)
The dawn manifestation of the sun god; usually shown as a scarab beetle,
Khepri was one of the four main forms of the sun god, Ra. His name derives
from the Ancient Egyptian word kheper meaning “to become” or “to be trans
formed.” Kheperu were changes or transformations, and Khepri was the one
who transformed or “created himself.”
Khepri appears as an irridescent beetle, a beetle-headed hawk, or a beetle
headed man seated on a throne. The scarab beetle’s habit of pushing a large ball
of dung was transformed into the image of a giant beetle pushing the sun and
other celestial bodies across the sky. Young beetles hatch out of buried dung
balls and fly off. Their apparently miraculous emergence from the ground may
have given rise to the idea of Khepri as a self-generated deity.
As early as the Pyramid Texts, Khepri is given as one of the names of the
sun god. He is addressed as “the shining one” and the one “who is in the nun.”
Khepri was linked with the creative power of the heart and identified with the
infant sun god who began creation by rising out of the primeval waters or the
primeval lotus.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology

The miracle of that first sunrise was repeated every day. In the myth, the
True Name of Ra, the wounded sun god tells Isis that he is “Khepri in the
morning, Ra at noon, Atum in the evening.” Khepri, the young sun of dawn, of
ten formed a pair with Ra-Atum, the old sun of evening. The Night Boat of the
sun was associated with Atum and the Day Boat with Khepri. At Heliopolis,
Atum-Khepri was worshipped as one god who daily underwent a series of trans
formations. In the Book of What Is in the Underworld, the corpse of Khepri is
divided and buried during the night, but he rises again triumphantly at dawn.
Human life was seen as a series of kheperu, such as child into adult or old
person into corpse. Khepri could help the final transformation from mummy to
akh (transfigured spirit). In the Book of the Dead, Khepri is invoked to over
come the intense fear of putrefaction. The deceased declares that his corpse will
not decay because “I am Khepri. My body parts will continue to exist.” This
promise of a permanently renewable life after death made the scarab form of
Khepri the most popular of all Egyptian symbols. Millions of scarabs were made
as amulets over a period of 2,500 years.
Khepri had no temples of his own, but giant stone scarabs were set up in
some temple complexes. The famous example by the sacred lake at Karnak is
close to an underground chapel that represented the Duat (the Underworld). In a
very secret ritual, the cult image of Amun-Ra would descend into this chapel
and return transformed into Khepri, “who emerges from the earth.” This Khepri
statue has generated its own mythology. Local women touch it when they hope
to conceive, and tourists are told that the statue has the power to make wishes
come true if you walk round it three times.

KHNUM (CHNUM)
The god Khnum was usually shown as a man with the head of a long-horned
ram. He was thought to control the Nile inundation, and he embodied the dan
gerous but life-giving power of this annual flood. As a creator deity, Khnum
shaped people and animals on his potter’s wheel and put life and health into
their bodies. He was sometimes paired with the frog goddess, Heqet, but in his
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 153



main temple on the island of Elephantine at Aswan, Khnum formed a triad with
the goddesses Satet and Anuket.
Khnum was one of the chief deities of the First Cataract, an area of rocky
rapids on the southern border of Egypt. An inscribed stela found on one of the
small islands in this region of the Nile relates an interesting tradition about
Khnum. The inscription purports to be a decree of King Djoser (c. 2667–2648
BCE) but was actually composed about 2,500 years after his reign. It tells how
Egypt suffered seven terrible years of famine, because the Nile did not rise high
enough to flood the agricultural land. Djoser summoned the wisest of the
priests who could read the sacred books and ordered him to discover the source
of the inundation. The priest consulted ancient books and discovered that the
inundation came from twin caverns under the island of Elephantine. He told
the king that only the god Khnum had the power to unbolt the doors and re
lease the flood from these caverns. Djoser hastily made offerings to the deities
of Elephantine. Then Khnum “the maker of every body” appeared to the king in
a dream and promised to let the flood gush again so that the years of hunger
would be ended.
It was probably the fertile mud spread by the inundation that Khnum was
thought to use as a “potter god.” In the Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts he
mainly seems to make objects, such as boats. One story set in the Old Kingdom
tells how Khnum was one of a group of deities who visited Egypt in disguise to
assist at the birth of three children destined to be kings. Khnum’s particular role
was to make their bodies healthy. Later texts and scenes that describe the con
ception and birth of divine kings show Khnum making the royal body and its ka
or double on his potter’s wheel. This seems to be taking place in the celestial
realm as a necessary prelude to the king’s physical birth.
In temples of the first millennium BCE, the births of gods were celebrated in
similar scenes. Khnum creates and animates the physical forms of these baby
gods, starting with shaping the egg in the womb. At the Roman Period temple
of Esna, Khnum’s role as maker of bodies was celebrated at the Festival of the
Potter’s Wheel. Hymns sung at this festival praised “the lord of the wheel” as
the one “who fashioned gods and men.” When Khnum was viewed as a univer
sal creator, his name was joined with those of other creator deities such as
Amun, Ptah, or Ra. His wheel was spun to remake the cosmos every morning.
The Egyptian word for ram sounded similar to the word for soul or manifesta
tion (ba). This may be why Khnum was sometimes identified with the soul of
other deities such as Geb, Osiris, and Ra. Most Underworld Books show the
nocturnal sun as a man with a ram’s head, because it is the soul of Ra that is
passing through the underworld.

KHONSU (KHONS, CHONS)
Khonsu was a moon god whose name means “the Traveler.” In the south of
Egypt he was said to be the son of Amun and Mut. In the north, he was the son
of Ptah and Sekhmet. He could be shown as a falcon-headed man or as child
wearing the sidelock of youth. His usual headdress represented a full moon
above a crescent moon.
The earliest references to Khonsu make him a terrifying figure. He was the
“angry one of the gods” who strangled lesser deities and ate the hearts of the
dead. Later he was associated with fate, judgment, and punishment. A baboon
form of Khonsu was feared as the Keeper of the Books of the End of Year. These
were the books in which the gods wrote the names of those who were going to
die during the year. People appealed to a gentler aspect of the god, “Khonsu the
Merciful,” to alter the decrees of fate.
It was mainly for his ferocious qualities that Khonsu was invoked in spells
to oppose powerful demons. An inscription dating to around the fourth century
BCE relates how a statue of Khonsu was sent to help a foreign princess who was
possessed by a spirit. The story is set 900 years earlier in the reign of Rameses
II. It tells how Rameses married a princess of the distant land of Bakhtan. While
the king and queen were celebrating a festival in Thebes, news came that the
queen’s sister, Bentresh, was very ill.
King Rameses sent a learned scribe to Bakhtan. He diagnosed that the
princess’s illness was caused by a spirit that was too powerful for him to fight.
The prince of Bakhtan asked the king of Egypt to send him a god who could
fight this spirit. Rameses consulted the oracle of Khonsu at Karnak and was told
to send a statue that was inhabited by a special manifestation known as
“Khonsu who determines Fate, the great god who drives out disease demons.”
The divine statue arrived in Bakhtan after a journey of seventeen months.
The god created magical protection for the princess, and “she became well at
once.” The prince of Bakhtan and his soldiers watched in terror as Khonsu con
versed with the spirit he had driven out. Khonsu ordered the prince to make of
ferings to placate the spirit so that it would never return. The prince was so im
pressed by the power of the divine statue that he decided to keep it in Bakhtan.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 155



After several years, the god appeared to the prince in a dream making it clear
that he wanted to go home. The prince did not dare to keep the statue any
longer and sent it back to Egypt with many rich gifts for the temple of Khonsu.
The temple of Khonsu at Karnak is very well preserved. On one of its walls
is a text known as the Khonsu cosmogony. This type of text tries to explain the
origins of the world. In this version, Khonsu is identified with the great snake
who fertilized the cosmic egg and “traveled to Thebes in his name of Khonsu
(the Traveler).”

KINGS AND PRINCES
Kingship was a sacred institution, established in the First Time as part of the di
vine order (maat). This did not mean that individual kings were always consid
ered infallible. Mythical history included a long period when individual deities
ruled as kings or queens of Egypt. A number of myths center on disputes over
the royal succession. The most important of these was the sixty-year conflict
between Horus and Seth. When Horus was acclaimed as the rightful ruler, he
became the model for all Egyptian kings.
It was an Egyptian king’s duty to please the gods, give justice to humanity,
and make offerings to the spirits of the dead. Kings and princes were praised as
champions of maat when they led the armies of Egypt into battle (see “Period of
Rule by Kings” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). Kings could be
shown literally upholding the divine order by taking on the Heh gods’ task of
supporting the sky. In the Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, the king can be
identified with the creator who swallows up all the other deities each night.
Dead kings were also assimilated to Osiris, the murdered god who rose again as
ruler of the dead. In New Kingdom Underworld Books, the king sometimes
joins the sun god in his barque to fight the nightly battle against chaos.
Living kings could be credited with divine qualities. The boy king
Tutankhamun was optimistically described as having the courage of Seth, the
strength of Horus, the knowledge of Ra, the skill of Ptah, and the discernment
of Thoth. Royal-birth myths gave some rulers a divine parent. Inscriptions in
Luxor temple tell how the god Amun transformed himself into a likeness of

King Thutmose IV (c. 1400–1390 BCE) (see Figure 20). He entered the palace
where Thutmose’s queen Mutemwiya was sleeping. She was woken by his per
vading scent and was overcome by desire. Amun then did “everything that he
wished with her.” He promised the queen that their son (Amenhotep III) would
rule Egypt “like Ra for ever.”
Such myths were sometimes used to justify a change of dynasty. The cli
max of a cycle of stories set in the reign of King Khufu (c. 2589–2566 BCE) is the
birth of three “sons of Ra” who will replace Khufu’s dynasty as rulers of Egypt.
This Middle Kingdom story cycle portrays Khufu as a tyrannical monarch who
needs to be told what is right by a wise peasant. His bad reputation survived
right down to the fifth century BCE when Herodotus was told that Cheops
(Khufu) had set his own daughter to work as a prostitute to help pay for his
pyramid building.
Weak or unjust rulers feature in tales of many different periods. In the New
Kingdom tale The Two Brothers, a King of Egypt has the husband of a woman
he wants to marry slaughtered and gives in to all this evil woman’s whims. In
the Late Period story of Meryra, a king learns that he is going to die unless
someone enters the underworld for him. Meryra agrees to die in the king’s
place. He plots a dreadful revenge from the underworld when he learns that the
ungrateful king has seized his widow.
Greco-Roman Period stories about a prince called Setna describe him steal
ing a magic book from a tomb. He fails to learn from the example of an earlier
prince who was killed by Thoth for using the forbidden book. In another of the
stories, an Egyptian king called Siamun is snatched from his bed every night and
beaten by wax figures brought to life by a Nubian sorcerer. The king is only
saved from this humiliating treatment by the wisdom of a priest-magician. Later
in the same story, Setna and his father, King Rameses II, are powerless against
Nubian sorcery until the spirit of the priest-magician returns to help them.
Herodotus tells a story about an Egyptian king called Rhampsinitus, who
may be partly based on Rameses II. Rhampsinitus is unable to protect his royal
treasure from a clever thief. In the end he has to accept the thief as his son-in
law. As in earlier Egyptian tales, intelligence and courage come off best against
hereditary power.

LOTUS
In some versions of the Egyptian creation story, the sun god was born from a
blue lotus that emerged from the primeval waters. The flower itself could be
identified with the great goddess who gave birth to the sun. The blue lotus
came to be a general symbol of rebirth. It was also the emblem of the god
Nefertem.
The sweetly scented blue lotus (nymphea caerulea) grows in still water. Its
flower buds only rise above the water and open their petals when the sun is
shining. This lotus is pollinated by beetles, which links it with Khepri, the bee
tle god of dawn. The image of the first sunrise as a lotus emerging from the dark
waters and opening to reveal its golden stamens seems to be an ancient one.
From around the fourteenth century BCE on, the newly risen sun could be
pictured as a naked child sitting inside the lotus and holding one finger to his
lips. In hymns intended to be sung at dawn, the sun god Ra is “the child of gold
who issues from the lotus.” Ra was thought to age during the course of the day,
so the infant god became an old man by sunset.
In some accounts the lotus comes into being after the eight primeval beings
known as the Ogdoad of Hermopolis fertilized the waters of chaos. These fertile
waters might be thought of as a great primeval goddess who, in the form of a
cow or a lotus, gives birth to the creator sun god. This goddess can be named as
Mehet-Weret, Hathor, or Neith. Various child gods such as Horus the Child,
Ihy, and Nefertem could all be identified with the solar child in the lotus. Ihy, a
son of Hathor, was called “the child who shines in the lotus.”
Nefertem was occasionally shown as a child seated on the lotus but more
often as a man or a lion-headed man wearing a lotus headdress. His epithets,
such as “the Great Lotus” and “the lotus-flower at the nose of Ra,” identify
him with the lotus itself. A sweet and powerful scent was a distinguishing char
acteristic of Egyptian deities, and Nefertem was the god who presided over per
fume making. In Egyptian funerary art, the dead were often shown holding a
blue lotus to their noses. Breathing in the perfume of the lotus gave them new
life as followers of Ra.

MAAT (MA’ET)
The central concept of Egyptian cosmology and ethics was personified as the
goddess Maat wearing an ostrich feather on her head. The word maat can mean
truth, justice, righteousness, order, balance, and cosmic law. The goddess Maat
was the beloved daughter of Ra, the creator sun god. She traveled with him in
the sun barque, delighting his heart and giving “life to his nostrils.” The pri
mary duty of an Egyptian king was to be the champion of maat. In the afterlife,
the dead were judged on whether they had done and spoken maat.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 159

From the Old Kingdom onward, Maat’s presence was thought to be vital to
the daily regeneration of the sun god. In Underworld Books she is often shown
standing close to Ra in both the Day and Night Boats of the sun. This, or the
dual nature of Egypt as two kingdoms, may explain why Maat can appear as two
identical goddesses.
Maat shares her feather emblem with the air god Shu. She was sometimes
equated with Shu’s sister, Tefnut. The gods were said to “live on maat,” and the
goddess was identified with the basics of life: air to breathe, bread to eat, and
beer to drink. From the fourteenth century BCE onward, Maat was often shown
as a winged goddess. Like Isis, she could revive the dead with the air generated
by her beating wings. Another emblem of Maat was a plinth sign that was used
in the writing of her name. Such plinths are shown below the thrones of deities
who act as divine judges. This depiction has been interpreted as a symbol that
maat was the base on which Egyptian society was built.
Kings were frequently shown offering a miniature figure of Maat to the
chief deity of a temple. All the daily rituals and sacrifices would be deemed
meaningless unless the king and his people were living righteous lives. Judges
and high officials wore images of the goddess to signify that they were enforcing
her laws. Maat was often linked with Thoth, the impartial judge, who was said
to have put the laws of maat into writing. This gave a divine precedent for the
many works of Egyptian literature that teach or debate how to “live in maat” in
the real world.
Egyptian myths of a golden age included a period when Maat was ruler of
earth. She was sometimes said to have withdrawn to the heavens because she
was grieved by the wicked behavior of humanity. Maat could still be thought of
as living with an individual like his or her good angel and accompanying that
person into the afterlife. Eventually “joining Maat” became a euphemism for
dying.
In the Book of the Dead, the Hall of the Two Truths (or the Double Maat)
is the place where the souls of the dead come to be judged. The hearts of the
dead were weighed against the feather of Maat, and her image sometimes sur
mounts the scales. If, like Ra, the dead person had Maat in his or her heart, the
scales would balance and the deceased would be declared “true of voice” or
“justified” (see Figure 7).
A hymn from the time when Egypt was occupied by the Persians evokes
“the beautiful face of Maat” shining from the heart of Ra. The goddess is urged
to reside in the tongue and the head of the Persian king, so that he will do
maat. During the Greco-Roman Period, Maat seems to have lost her central
place in Egyptian religion, and some of her functions were taken over by Isis.

MAGICIANS
Ancient Egyptian heroes were usually magicians rather than warriors. Deities
such as Isis and Thoth were presented as powerful magicians, and the dead
needed to use spells and amulets to survive in the afterlife. At a time when
reading was a rare skill, book learning of all kinds was associated with magic.
Historical figures with a scholarly reputation, such as the Third Dynasty offi
cial Imhotep, became magicians in legend. The amazing powers attributed to
the ritual specialists known as lector priests were the subject of many tales.
A cycle of Middle Kingdom stories set in the reign of King Khufu
(c. 2589–2566 BCE) tells of great magicians of the past. The first story in the se
quence probably featured Imhotep, but only the last few lines are preserved.
The second story concerns the chief lector priest Webaoner (Ubainer) and his
wife. This lector priest discovers that his wife is meeting a lover in a lakeside
pavilion. He consults his magic scrolls and makes a crocodile of wax “seven fin
gers long.” This wax crocodile is thrown into the lake when his wife’s lover is
bathing. It becomes a crocodile 7 cubits long (about 3.5 meters) that seizes the
lover and keeps him at the bottom of the lake for seven days. Webaoner shows
his king what he has done and turns the terrible crocodile back into a wax
model. The king condemns Webaoner’s wife and her lover to death. The wife is
burned and the lover is given up to the magic crocodile, who drags him down
into the underworld.
A lake is also the main setting for the third story, but this is much more
cheerful in tone. King Sneferu is bored, so the wise lector priest Djadjaemankh
advises him to go for a trip on the palace lake in a barge rowed by twenty beau
tiful girls. When one of the rowers loses her favorite turquoise pendant,
Djadjaemankh uses his magic to roll back the waters and recover the jewel from

One of Khufu’s sons then promises to bring him a 110-year-old peasant who
is more skilled in magic than all these priest-magicians of the past. The peasant
Djedi can tame lions with his magic, an ominous prospect for King Khufu, as
this animal traditionally represented the power of the king. Khufu wants to be
head a criminal and have Djedi bring him back to life. Fear of losing your head
in the afterlife is mentioned in many spells, so this may be Khufu’s motive.
Djedi rebukes the king for wanting to experiment on people and restores the
severed heads of two geese and a bull. Finally, Khufu asks Djedi for what he re
ally wants: the number of the chambers in the mansion of Thoth. This secret
knowledge would probably allow Khufu to build the perfect tomb for himself.
Djedi warns him that this knowledge is destined to be revealed only to the eld
est of three kings who will replace Khufu’s dynasty.
Secret knowledge is a central theme in the stories told about Setna, a char
acter based on a prince of the thirteenth century BCE who is known to have
done much restoration work in the cemeteries and temples of Memphis. In leg
end, he was transformed into a tomb robber, determined to steal a copy of the
Book of Thoth. Setna meets the ghosts of an earlier prince and his wife. They
warn him that if he takes the Book of Thoth and tries to use the spells it con
tains, the gods will punish him. Setna ignores their warnings, but he is forced to
return the book after a series of uncanny experiences.
In one of these, Setna agrees to the murder of his own children. This turns
out to be an illusion, and Setna’s son Sa-Osiris grows up to be a great magician.
He takes his father on a magical journey through the underworld and shows
him the very different fates of the evil and the good after death. When Setna and
his father (Rameses II) are challenged by a Nubian sorcerer to read a sealed let
ter without opening it, only Sa-Osiris can perform this feat. The letter tells how
hundreds of years before, a magician called Sa-Paneshe defeated a Nubian sor
ceress and her son who were casting spells on a king of Egypt. Sa-Osiris then re
veals that he is the spirit of Sa-Paneshe reborn to protect Egypt from the contin
uing threat of Nubian sorcery.

MEHET-WERET (MEHURIT, METHYER)
Mehet-Weret was a primeval cow goddess who gave birth to the sun god. Her
name originally meant the “Great Flood” but was later reinterpreted as the
“Great Swimmer.” She was a female counterpart of Nun, the god of the
primeval ocean, and a rival for his title of “oldest of beings.” In some contexts,
Mehet-Weret is merely an epithet of creator goddesses such as Hathor, Neith,
or Isis.
Mehet-Weret was thought of as existing before creation as a kind of fertile
current in the primeval ocean. Spell 17 of the Book of the Dead states that the
sun god Ra was “born from the buttocks” of Mehet-Weret. The primeval lotus,
from which the sun child is alternatively said to have emerged, was probably
also a form of this goddess. After creation, Mehet-Weret was identified with the
celestial waters traveled by the sun barque. In the nocturnal sky she was proba
bly the “river” of stars we know as the Milky Way.
Mehet-Weret could be shown as a cow-headed woman, a seated cow, or a
cow carrying a child. One of Mehet-Weret’s titles was “mound” or “island,” al
luding to the idea that the newborn sun god was raised above the primeval wa
ters on the head or back of Mehet-Weret so that he could begin his work of cre
ation. In a variation on this myth, Neith/Mehet-Weret is said to have saved the
infant sun from her children (the first crocodiles) by carrying him through the
waters of chaos. This finds a parallel in later mythical history. After a revolt by
humanity, Ra begins a new order by being carried up into the heavens on the
back of Nut in cow form. Nut and Mehet-Weret are sometimes treated as a pair
of cosmic cows with parallel myths and sometimes as the same deity. Nut has
an alternative sky form as a giant nude woman stretched above the earth. Ritual
spoons in the form of a nude female swimmer may depict Nut/Mehet-Weret.
The starry-patterned cows that form the sides of a golden bed from the
tomb of Tutankhamun are labeled Isis-Mehet [Weret]. The purpose of such fu
nerary beds was to help the dead king to ascend to the heavens, supported by
the celestial cow. In the Book of the Dead, the cow who stands at the entrance
to the realm of the dead is sometimes named as Mehet-Weret. By the New
Kingdom all the elite dead could hope to be helped by the cow goddess during
the vulnerable period of rebirth.

MIN
Min was an ancient god of human and agricultural fertility. The most mascu
line of gods, Min was shown as a cloaked figure with a large erect penis. He
wears two tall plumes on his head, and his right arm is raised in a smiting ges
ture. Above his right hand is a flail, which may be a herdsman’s whip. These
features suggest that Min could be an apotropaic deity, driving away evil with
his aggressive body language. Statues of Min were carried out to protect and
bless the fields, and the first fruits of the harvest were presented to him. From
the Middle Kingdom onward, Min was often identified with Horus, the son of
Isis. At Thebes, Min united with Amun to form a creator deity capable of gener
ating all life through his sexual potency.
From early times, Min could be represented by a mysterious emblem that
has been variously interpreted as a lightning bolt, a barbed arrow, a pair of fos
silized shellfish, or a door bolt. This symbol appears on the 5,000-year-old
Colossi of Min found in his temple at Coptos on the edge of the eastern desert.
Min was worshipped as Lord of the Eastern Desert by the miners, quarrymen,
and hunters who worked in this desolate region.
Min is mentioned in several of the Pyramid Texts. His tall plumes seem to
give the dead king the power to fly up into the heavens. Spells in the Coffin
Texts helped deceased men to achieve the sexual prowess of Min, “the woman

164



hunter,” in the afterlife. Coffin Texts spell 335 asks who Min is and answers:
“He is Horus, the protector of his father.”
A tall-growing lettuce whose juice resembled semen was Min’s sacred
plant. An episode in the Contendings of Horus and Seth when Seth becomes
pregnant after eating “the seed of Horus” smeared on lettuce leaves illustrates
the extraordinary generative powers of Min-Horus. The sacred animals of Min
were a falcon and a white bull, and one of Min’s most important titles was Ka
mut-ef (the Bull of his Mother). Min was said to secretly unite with his mother
under cover of darkness to beget himself. During the festival of Min, the queen
of Egypt took the role of the “mother of Min,” probably so that the royal ka (vi
tal force) could be passed intact from king to king. In narratives in which the
gods are treated like people, this archaic ritual becomes the myth of the rape of
Isis by her son Min-Horus-Nakht (Horus the Strong). This led to a further iden
tification of Min with Osiris, the father of the son of Isis.
When the Greeks settled in Egypt, they saw Min as a form of the virile
goat-god Pan, the protector of travelers in lonely places. One Classical writer
claimed that Min was promoted to god of fertility after making love to all the
women in Egypt when the men were away at war.

MONTU (MONT, MONTH)
A fierce Upper Egyptian falcon god who may have originated as a star deity,
Montu was the chief god of the Theban region and had temples at Armant,
Medamud, and Tod. He was usually shown as a falcon-headed man, wearing a
sun disk with two plumes and holding a curved sword or a spear. Fighting was
“the work of Montu.” He attacked the enemies of maat (order) and inspired
kings and warriors on the battlefield. Battleships were decorated with protec
tive images of the “four Montus” (of Thebes, Armant, Medamud, and Tod)
spearing and trampling the enemies of Egypt.
Armant (Hermonthis) was considered to be the southern equivalent of
Heliopolis, the city of the sun god Ra. As early as the twentieth century BCE,
Montu was worshipped as an aspect of the sun god. His chief consort was Raet
tawy, a female form of Ra usually shown wearing the sun disk and cow horns
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 165



headdress of Hathor. The gods Montu-Ra and Atum-Ra could represent the
kingdoms of Upper and Lower Egypt. Montu-Ra was the patron deity of King
Nebhepetre Montuhotep (“Montu-is-content”) who reunited Egypt at the end of
the First Intermediate Period.
Egyptian kings liked to compare themselves to “strong-armed Montu.” An
inscription of Amenhotep II (c. 1427–1401 BCE) claims that as a youth of eigh
teen he was able to shoot arrows through a copper target while driving a chariot
because he had the skill and strength of Montu. Rameses II (c. 1290–1224 BCE)
boasted that he had turned defeat into victory at the battle of Qadesh by attack
ing the enemy “in the likeness of Montu,” charging their ranks “like a swoop
ing falcon.”
Rameses also compared himself to an “eager bull” in battle, which was an
other of Montu’s forms. Montu was probably associated with the fights between
bulls staged at some religious festivals. From the fourth century BCE onward, a
black and white bull was always kept in the Montu temple at Armant. These
“Buchis bulls” were revered as manifestations of the twin souls of Ra and
Osiris. Each Buchis bull had a staff of twenty. He wore crowns and necklaces
and a face net to keep off flies.

MOON
A variety of male and female deities was associated with aspects of the moon.
The god who personified the moon itself was called Iah (Yah), but he never
gained great importance in cult or myth. Khonsu and Thoth were major lunar
deities who could be shown wearing a crescent (the new moon) and a disk (the
full moon). The Egyptian equivalent of “the man in the moon” was a great
white baboon. The moon was also thought of as the left eye of Horus, the heav
enly falcon. The complex mythology of the moon centered on its dramatic
monthly cycle of decline and renewal.
As a god of the new moon Khonsu could be shown as a child, whereas as
god of the full moon he appeared as a falcon-headed man crowned with a lunar
disk: “a sun that shines at night.” As a god who punished the wicked, Khonsu
acted like a lunar equivalent of the merciless Eye of Ra. Khonsu and Thoth
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
166



were both divine reckoners who decided the length of a person’s life span.
Thoth was said to have invented the lunar calendar, which fixed the date of
temple festivals. One myth relates how Thoth’s baboon form was created to
rule the night sky as the deputy of the sun god so that humanity need not fear
the dark. In the Book of Two Ways, the spirits of the dead strive to join Thoth in
the Mansion of the Moon.
A temporary destruction of the moon is one of the mythical events fre
quently mentioned but never very fully described in Egyptian texts. In some
versions, the lunar eye of Horus seems to be attacked or even swallowed by the
god Seth in the form of a black pig. Thoth forces him to disgorge the moon
again. This is similar to the image of the sky goddess swallowing the sun every
night and giving birth to it every morning, so Seth can be regarded as the
“mother” of the moon.
Other texts refer to a fight in which one or both of the eyes of Horus are
torn out by Seth. Thoth is usually said to be the one who finds, heals, and re
stores the wounded eye. From Classical times onward, these myths have been
interpreted as symbolic accounts of lunar eclipses or of the monthly waxing and
waning of the moon. The waxing moon was sometimes represented in temple
art by a fierce young bull and the waning moon by a tame ox (castrated bull).
The lunar cycle also came to be linked with the death and revival of Osiris.
The Greek writer Plutarch reported the belief that the fourteen days of the wan
ing moon were equated with the fourteen parts of the dismembered body of
Osiris, which had to be joined together to make him whole again.
Plutarch also noted that the moon was sometimes thought of as female.
From early times the right or solar eye of the heavenly falcon was personified as
a goddess. The liking for complementary pairs seems to have led to the creation
of a lunar eye goddess. The Two Ladies, Wadjyt and Nekhbet, could sometimes
stand for the fiery light of the sun and the radiant light of the moon. Goddesses
such as Hathor and Bastet might play the roles of both the solar and the lunar
eyes. Their terrible lion forms were usually solar, but their gentler cat forms
could be lunar. The behavior of cats was believed to be influenced by the lunar
cycle. When Isis became the paramount deity, she was also worshipped as a
moon goddess.

MUT (MOUT)
Little is known about the ori
gins of this goddess, but from
the New Kingdom onward she
was worshipped as the Queen of
the Gods. At Thebes, Mut be
came the chief consort of
Amun-Ra and the mother of the
moon god Khonsu. Her name
derives from the Egyptian word
for mother. Mut was most com
monly shown as a mature
woman wearing the vulture
headdress of an Egyptian queen,
but she also had lioness and cat
forms.
In royal-birth myths, the
reigning queen was identified
with Mut uniting with her con
sort Amun to produce a divine
child who was destined to rule
Egypt. Each new king absorbed
the power to rule from the milk
of his mother Mut. As an em
blem of sovereignty, Mut could
be shown wearing the White
Crown of Upper Egypt or the
Double Crown of Upper and
Lower Egypt and holding royal
scepters. A few New Kingdom
hymns name her as the leader of the gods, the female equivalent of the creator
sun god. They praise her for creating the inundation from the sweat of her body
and caring for all people.
Mut could also play the role of the shining first-born daughter of the sun
god, the Eye of Ra. She was sometimes linked with the myth in which Ra and
his daughter take the form of cats to slay the Apophis serpent under the ished
tree. When Mut quarreled with her father, she roamed the Libyan desert in the
form of a cat and had to be persuaded to come back to Egypt. Her return was
greeted with wild rejoicing among gods, people, and animals.

The myth of the return of the far-wandering goddess was reenacted in tem
ples of Mut. The important ritual of the pacification of the angry goddess took
place on a crescent-shaped lake representing the mythical place, Isheru. The
purpose of the ritual was to transform the destructive aspect of the solar god
dess (Sekhmet) into one of her more benevolent aspects (Mut, Lady of Isheru,
Hathor, or Bastet). The pacified goddess would then consent to take a husband
and give birth to the divine child.
Mut-Sekhmet was credited with the power to prevent or inflict plague and
other infectious diseases. The hundreds of lion-headed statues of the goddess
from the temple of Mut at Karnak may have been set up to protect Egypt from
the epidemics that periodically devastated the Ancient Near East.
The “flame of Mut” was one of the most feared of divine weapons, and her
role as a punisher was not restricted to the mythical realm. Traitors and crimi
nals who were considered “enemies of Ra” might be burned alive on braziers in
her temples. A particularly terrifying form of Mut-Sekhmet-Bastet had wings, a
penis, and three heads: human, lion. and vulture. When the souls of the dead
faced judgment in the afterlife, they could invoke this deity to save them from a
horrible death in the Place of Execution.

woman wearing the Red Crown of the north. Her temple at Sais in the Delta
was one of Ancient Egypt’s most famous buildings.
Neith was a very important deity in the Early Dynastic Period. The curious
symbol that represented Neith in these early times may originally have been
a click beetle. Later this symbol was reinterpreted as two arrows crossing a
shield. Click beetles are usually found near water, and Neith was often equated
with Mehet-Weret, a primeval goddess whose name means the Great Flood. She
was the mother of the creator sun god and so had claims to be considered the
oldest of beings. At Sais, Neith was called “the great mother who gave birth to
Ra; she instituted giving birth when there had been no childbirth before.” By ex
tension, Neith could also be regarded as the mother of that other divine child,
Horus.
As early as the New Kingdom, Neith was alluded to as “the Mother and
Father of all things.” A text in the Roman Period temple of Esna describes how
Neith created the world by speaking seven magical words. As the personifica
tion of the fertile primeval waters, she was the mother of the snakes and
crocodiles “who are in the abyss.” Neith, “the nurse of crocodiles,” was shown
as a crocodile-headed woman suckling two small crocodiles. She was often
named as the mother of Sobek, the most important crocodile god. When Neith
spat into the primeval waters, her spittle turned into the terrible chaos monster,
Apophis, who nightly challenged the rule of the sun god. One festival at Esna
commemorated Neith saving the newborn Ra from her children (the crocodiles
or the chaos serpent) by carrying him across the waters.
Neith, “mistress of the bow,” was depicted holding a bow and arrows. The
arrows of Neith were used to strike down the enemies of the sun god, including
her offspring Apophis. In the Pyramid Texts, Neith was named as one of the
four goddesses who protected the royal sarcophagus and canopic chest. This
protective role was later extended to all the dead.

NEPHTHYS
One of the Two Sisters who mourned for the murdered god Osiris, Nephthys
was the youngest of the five children of the sky goddess and the unwilling part
ner of her brother Seth. She mainly features in myth as the devoted companion
of her sister, Isis, but she was a popular protective goddess in funerary art.
Nephthys was usually shown as a woman wearing the signs that write her
name (Lady of the Mansion) on her head.
Nephthys never enjoyed the high status of her sister, Isis. In spite of her
nominal pairing with Seth, Nephthys seems to have lived with Isis and her hus
band Osiris. Perhaps because of her sham marriage, Nephthys is described in
one of the Pyramid Texts as “an imitation woman with no vagina.” A few
Egyptian texts allude to the distress of Isis on discovering that her husband has
slept with Nephthys. The Greek writer Plutarch relates that Nephthys tricked
Osiris into sleeping with her and then gave birth to a monstrous son, Anubis.
Nephthys abandoned the child to die, but Isis found and saved him. Plutarch
saw Osiris as representing the fertilizing Nile flood, Isis the cultivated land of
the Nile valley, and Nephthys the usually barren desert.
After the murder of Osiris, Nephthys and Isis searched for his body or for
the dismembered parts of that body. The two goddesses were present during the
mummification of the body by Anubis. Isis and Nephthys are mentioned in the
Pyramid Texts as part of the group of four goddesses who guarded the king’s
mummified body and organs. As one of the goddesses of weaving, Nephthys
was particularly associated with the linen bandages that wrapped a mummy.
These bandages were sometimes called the “tresses of Nephthys.” When it be
came common to identify all dead persons with Osiris, Isis and Nephthys were
often shown standing at either end of the funeral bier.
The sisters, sometimes in the form of two kites (small birds of prey), were
said to have kept a long vigil over the mummy of Osiris to protect him from fur
ther attacks by Seth. This vigil was reenacted by two young women, who repre
sented Isis and Nephthys, at festivals of Osiris and at the funerals of important
people and sacred animals. In the passionate laments sung during this ritual,
Nephthys describes herself as the “beloved sister” of the “good king” Osiris.

Nephthys seems to play only a minor role in the bringing up of her nephew,
Horus. She is usually shown watching in scenes in which Horus raises the djed
pillar, a tableaux that symbolized the revival of Osiris. In the Book of the Dead,
Nephthys often stands with her sister behind the throne of Osiris presiding over
the judgment of the dead.

NUN (NOUN, NU)
Nun was a personification of the primeval ocean from which all life came. After
creation, the watery darkness known as the nun continued to surround the
world. It existed above the stars and as an abyss that formed the lowest depths
of the underworld. As a deity, Nun was considered the oldest of beings and
called the Father of the Gods. He and his female counterpart Naunet were
among the eight primeval beings who made up the Ogdoad of Hermopolis.
As a member of the Ogdoad, Nun had a frog or frog-headed form. From the
New Kingdom onward, he was also shown as a fecundity figure presenting the
king with the gift of water, the most precious of all substances in desert coun
tries. The Egyptians believed that all the seas and rivers had their ultimate

source in the nun. During the annual Nile flood, Egypt seemed to revert to its
primeval state, and civilization was in danger of being swept away. The creator
had to intervene and send divine messengers to ask Nun to curb the destructive
power of his flood.
Since the nun also contained the potential to create life, Nun was thought
of as a demiurge, a kind of instinctive movement toward consciousness. At
Memphis, the creator god Ptah was said to “have embodied himself as Nun” in
order to make things live and grow. More often, Egyptian creation myths speak
of the creator’s coming into being “in the nun.” The generative powers of the
nun could be personified by a goddess known as Mehet-Weret (the Great Flood)
who gave birth to the creator sun god.
Every night the sun god Ra returned to the watery abyss to be regenerated.
Most semiconscious or unconscious states, such as dreaming, drunkenness, or
death, were thought of in terms of descending into this abyss. In the
Underworld Book known as the Book of Gates, Ra joins the spirits of the dead
in the nun. At the climax of this book, the god Nun appears as a giant figure
lifting the sun boat out of the depths and into the sky. More pessimistic
Egyptian texts speak of the world ending when the creator chooses to return to
his “father” Nun.
The chief god of any temple could be identified with Nun in order to give
him seniority over other deities. Egyptian respect for the wisdom of old age led
to Nun’s being revered as a counselor. In one myth, Ra consults Nun when
people start to rebel against the gods. Nun’s advice is to send the goddess
Hathor down as a lioness to punish humanity. In myths from other Near
Eastern cultures, a great flood is sent to kill the wicked. The Egyptian version
may not be as different as it seems, since Hathor can be both the solar lioness
and the goddess known as the Great Flood.

NUT (NOUT)
Nut was the sky goddess who was the daughter of the air god Shu and his sister,
Tefnut. Nut was the consort of her brother, the earth god Geb, and the mother
of several important deities including Osiris, Isis, and Seth. As the sky, Nut was
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 173



shown either as a giant nude woman arched above the earth or as a giant cow
with starry markings. Her name probably derives from an Ancient Egyptian
word for water (nw) and her symbol was a water pot.
Several myths deal with the separation of sky and earth. The first, which
seems to be as old as the Pyramid Texts, relates how Nut and Geb embraced
each other so fervently that there was no room between them for anything to
exist. Either at the command of the creator or because he was jealous, Shu sepa
rated his children and held Nut and Geb permanently apart (see Figure 42). Nut
could then give birth to the children she had already conceived.
In the Coffin Texts, Nut is described as the “mother of the five epagomenal
days.” A late explanation of this statement is found in Plutarch’s book on
Egyptian religion. It tells how Nut (whom Plutarch calls Rhea) was pregnant,
but the sun god put a curse on her so that she could not give birth on any day of
the year. The god Hermes (Thoth) played a board game with the moon and won
enough light to make five extra days on which Nut’s children could be born.
The five children were Osiris, Horus the Elder, Seth, Isis, and Nephthys.
In other accounts of mythical history, there seems no permanent separation
until the creator sun god Ra decides to leave the earth after a rebellion by hu
manity. Nut takes the form of a cow to carry Ra up into the heavens, a myth
encapsulated in the image of a sun disk between cow’s horns that became the
insignia of several goddesses. When she was holding the sun god high above the
earth, Nut’s “limbs began to shake,” so the eight Heh gods were created to sup
port her.
Nut was particularly associated with the night sky, and some scholars have
identified her with the Milky Way. In the Pyramid Texts, it is Nut who draws
the dead king up to the heavens to live again as a star. The sky was often
thought of as a watery region in which the stars and planets might swim like
fish or sail in boats.
In the day, the sun god sailed along the “sea below the belly of Nut.” Each
evening, the sun god was swallowed by Nut and passed through a perilous inner
sky inside her. At dawn, Nut gave birth to the sun, her blood turning the sky
red. At the same time she would be swallowing the moon and the stars to give
birth to them again at dusk. This violent imagery may have given rise to a rein
terpretation of Nut’s character as “the sow who eats her own piglets.” From the
New Kingdom onward, the solar cycle was depicted in royal tombs and in tem
ple halls with giant figures of Nut stretching across the ceilings.
In funerary religion Nut was regarded as one of the most helpful goddesses.
She was sometimes carved or painted on the underside of coffin lids, so that she
could embrace the deceased for all eternity. In the Book of the Dead and in dec
orated tombs she was shown in a paradise garden as the goddess of the

dead and strengthen them for their journey through the underworld.

OGDOAD OF HERMOPOLIS
The Ogdoad of Hermopolis was a group of eight primeval deities whose chief
cult center was Khenmw (Eight Town), later called Hermopolis Magna. The
Ogdoad embodied the qualities of primeval matter, such as darkness, moistness,
and lack of boundaries or visible powers. It usually consisted of four deities dou

bled to eight by including female counterparts. Obeying some primitive in
stinct, the eight came together to make the place (the Primeval Mound or the
Island of Flame) or an object (the Primeval Lotus or the Cosmic Egg) from which
the creator sun god emerged. This made the Ogdoad “the fathers and mothers”
of the creator. Alternatively, creator gods such as Amun, Ptah, or Thoth were
viewed as calling the eight into being. The creator was then “his” own ancestor,
the “father of the fathers and mothers.”
The deities who make up the Ogdoad differ from one source to another.
Nun and his female counterpart Naunet, the deities of the primeval waters, are
nearly always included. Naunet may be a primeval form of the sky goddess,
Nut. Amun and Amunet, deities of invisible power or the breath of life, are in
some of the oldest lists. When Amun was regarded as a creator separate from
the eight, he and Amunet were replaced by Nia and Niat, deities of the void.
Primeval darkness was represented by Kek and Keket or occasionally Gereh and
Gerehet. Some lists have Tenemet, “chaos,” or Heh and his female counterpart
Hehet. Heh and Hehet are difficult to interpret. They may originally have em
bodied the strong currents in the Primeval Waters. The Ogdoad of Hermopolis
was sometimes treated as identical with the group of four or eight Heh gods cre
ated by Shu to help him support the sky. They in turn were sometimes identi
fied with the “Eastern Souls,” the eight baboons who helped the sun to rise.
The Ogdoad could be represented in human form, but sometimes the males
have frog or jackal heads and the females snake heads. The amphibian and
snake forms of the Ogdoad were thought of as mating in and fertilizing the
Primeval Waters. An image of the waters alive with glutinous frog spawn may
be what the Egyptians had in mind. In some sources, the Ogdoad seem to be
forces that the creator has to subdue before the work of creation can begin. In
others they simply seem to die after bringing forth life. The Primeval Mound
was both the place of creation and the tomb of the Ogdoad. The Heh gods could
then be thought of as the shadows or heavenly souls of the Ogdoad.
The Heh gods belonged to the twilight after dusk and before dawn. This
was the equivalent in the daily solar cycle to the period of precreation in the
great cycle of mythical history. The Ogdoad merged in the primeval waters to
allow the creator to come into being, and the Heh gods acted together to make
the void in which the earth could come into being. Members of the Ogdoad
such as Nun and Naunet and Kek and Keket were said to help the sun to be re
born as Khepri every morning.

ONURIS (ANHUR, INHUR, INHERT)
A hunter deity renowned for capturing a dangerous goddess, Onuris was the lo
cal god of Thinis (This), the home town of the kings of the First Dynasty. He
was usually shown as a bearded man wearing a plumed headdress and carrying a
spear and a coil of rope. As a hunter of threatening animals, Onuris could be
treated as an aspect of Shu or of Horus the Harpooner. The Greeks identified
Onuris with Ares, their god of war.
The epithets of Onuris characterized him as full of strength and vigor. He
was the “bull of Thinis,” “strong of arm” and “high of feather.” Anticrocodile
spells mention a great combat between Onuris-Shu and the evil crocodile Maga.
Onuris, “the good warrior,” was invoked as protector against demons. In royal
tombs of the late New Kingdom, Sopdu and Onuris act as guardians for the dead
king in the snake-infested deserts of the underworld. The name Onuris means
“bringer-back of the distant one.” This refers to a myth in which Onuris left
Egypt to hunt in a remote desert region. His quarry was a wild lion goddess. No
detailed version of this myth survives, but Onuris seems to have caught and
tamed the goddess. He brought her back to Egypt, where she became his bride
under the name of Mehit (Mekhit).
Originally, this Distant Goddess may simply have been a personification of
the deserts of Nubia. Later, she was identified with Hathor-Tefnut, the wander
ing Eye of Ra, who left Egypt after quarreling with her father. In this version of
the myth she was persuaded to return to Egypt and civilization by the god
Thoth and her brother, Onuris-Shu. Texts in temples of the Greco-Roman
Period refer to Shu “who brought back his beautiful sister to her father.”
As a further complication, Shu and Tefnut could sometimes be identified
with the sun and the moon, and the goddess Mehit (“the completed one”) could
be a personification of the full moon. Onuris then becomes the god who re
turned the lost lunar Eye of Horus and restored the cosmic balance.

OSIRIS
Osiris, the “great god” who ruled the Egyptian underworld, was the eldest son
of the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. He and his sister-consort, Isis,
ruled Egypt together until Osiris was struck down by his anarchical brother,
Seth. Osiris died and became “the Inert One.” The gods eventually decreed that
Osiris should be resurrected as king and judge of the dead and that his posthu
mous son Horus should be made king of the living.
Osiris was usually shown as a mummified king wearing an atef crown and
carrying a crook and flail. His skin can be black or green. These colors may orig
inally have indicated putrefaction, but they came to symbolize the connection
of Osiris with a cycle of death and regeneration based on plant life. In the
Pyramid Texts, the dead king is frequently identified with Osiris or his stellar
counterpart, Sah (Orion). By the second millennium BCE, this identification was
nominally extended to all the dead. Every aspect of burial and mummification
came to be linked to the mythology of Osiris.
Where, when, and how Osiris was first worshipped is much disputed. It has
been claimed that Osiris was originally a deified Predynastic king, a primitive
vegetation spirit, a jackal god of an early royal necropolis, or a mother goddess.
Even the etymology of his name is uncertain, though it may simply mean the
Mighty One (Death?).
The cult of Osiris only became prominent during the Fifth Dynasty (c.
2494–2345 BCE). He gradually seems to have taken over the attributes of other
funerary deities, such as Andjety of Busiris and Khentamentiu of Abydos. The
latter’s name (Foremost of the Westerners) became an epithet of Osiris, indicat
ing his leadership of the spirits and demons of the Duat. At all periods there are
a few texts that describe Osiris as a terrifying figure who dispatches demon
messengers to drag the living into the gloomy realm of the dead.
In most accounts, Osiris was born wearing a crown and was chosen to suc
ceed his father, Geb, by the sun god himself. A few sources allude to a violent dy
nastic struggle between Geb and Osiris. One late text from Kom Ombo even
claims that Osiris was killed and born again after a union between his father,
Geb, and his grandfather, Shu. No detailed accounts of the reign of Osiris or the
manner of his death survive from before the Greco-Roman Period (see “The
Reigns of Shu, Geb, and Osiris” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”).
In the Pyramid Texts, Osiris is either struck down and trampled by his
brother, Seth, or drowned in the Nile. A double death was probably thought
necessary to kill a god permanently. The relatives of Osiris have to search for
and “gather up” the body. Later sources stressed that Seth had deliberately torn
up the body, but in the Pyramid Texts it is probably natural disintegration that
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
178



Isis has to reverse with her magic. With the help of the gods Anubis and Thoth,
the body of Osiris is preserved and becomes the first mummy.
The sexual power of Osiris seems to be strong enough to survive his death,
so he is able to make Isis pregnant. Having ensured the continuation of the cos
mos through the conception of Horus, Osiris sinks back into an inert state.
Other deities such as Isis, Thoth, and Horus have to argue his case before a
Divine Tribunal. Osiris is vindicated as a “possessor of maat” (truth, justice).
Since his death was unjust, the creator allows Osiris to leave his mummy and
rule the kingdom of the dead as Wenenefer (Onnophris). This name originally
seems to have meant “the one whose body did not decay,” but it was later inter
preted as “the beneficent one.” The actual raising of Osiris seems to be accom
plished by Horus presenting the power of his Eye to Osiris.
A Middle Kingdom royal ritual equates the body of Osiris with barley and
Seth with the donkeys who thresh the grain by trampling on it. This is the ear
liest definite example of the death and resurrection of Osiris being linked to the
annual cycle of the reaping and sowing of crops. Like the virile Min, Osiris
could be worshipped as a god of agricultural fertility. Ithyphallic corn mummies
were made and buried during festivals of Osiris. Their magical purpose was to
give new life to the dead, just as the seed corn grew into new plants. The body
of Osiris could also be shown regenerating inside a tree.
From at least as early as the New Kingdom, all the liquids that came from
the body of Osiris, such as semen, sweat, and pools of putrefaction, were associ
ated with the life-bringing flood waters of the Nile. In some accounts the body
of Osiris was divided into anything from fourteen to forty-two parts. During the
first millennium BCE, these body parts were said to be buried at sacred sites all
over Egypt. The “tomb” of the left leg of Osiris on the island of Bigah was said
to be the source of the inundation.
The body of Osiris also played an important role in some of the New
Kingdom Underworld Books. In the darkest hour of the night, the soul of the
sun god Ra reached the cave where the body lay and became one with the soul
of Osiris. This allowed Osiris and all the dead to awake and live again. In the
Book of the Dead, Osiris was shown enthroned in the Hall of the Two Truths
overseeing the judgment of the dead. A New Kingdom prayer states that
Osiris is the greatest of the gods because all Egyptians have to come to him in
the end.
The idea of Osiris as a just judge and savior of the dead was prominent dur
ing the last stages of Pharaonic culture. In a story of the Roman Period, a prince
is shown that after death, rich and poor are treated equally and only the good
will survive the judgment of Osiris and enter his paradise.

PRIMEVAL MOUND
The Primeval Mound was the first land to rise above the primeval ocean at the
dawn of time. The Primeval Mound was the place where the spirit of the cre
ator could take on a form and begin the work of creation. The Mound remained
the center of the cosmos and a place of continuous creation. It could be shown
as a rounded or stepped mound. The pyramidion-shaped benben stone of
Heliopolis may also have been an image of the Primeval Mound. The god who
embodied the Mound was Tatjenen (Tatenen).
Mounds featured in many different creation myths. In Memphis, Tatjenen
was worshipped as a form of the creator god Ptah. At Thebes he became a form
of Amun. A high hill of sand is mentioned in the cosmology of Heliopolis.
Atum, or his erect penis, was sometimes identified with this hill. At
Hermopolis, the primeval forces known as the Ogdoad came together to form a
mound or an island as a place for the primeval egg. Some sources imply that the
broken shell of this “world egg” was used by the creator to make the first land.
When the first being was imagined as a bird, such as a phoenix, a goose, or
an ibis, the Mound was its first perch. The trees that are sometimes shown
growing out of the Mound may be the sacred grove from which falcon gods such
as Horus and Sopdu are said to have emerged. Every major Egyptian temple
claimed that its sanctuary was built on the site of the Primeval Mound. The
sanctuary was the place where the god of the temple became manifest, as the
creator first became manifest on the Mound.
By the New Kingdom, the god Osiris had developed strong associations
with the Primeval Mound. Like the Ogdoad, he could be thought of as being

buried in or under the Mound. His soul could be shown as a bird perching in a
tree or grove growing from the Mound. In some Underworld Books, the souls of
Ra and Osiris meet in bird form on top of the mound to bring new life to the
dead. The resurrected Osiris was shown enthroned on the Mound at the center
of the underworld.

Ptah was a creator deity who made the world with his heart and his tongue. As
Ptah “South of His Wall” he was the chief god of the Egyptian capital,
Memphis. He was usually shown as a bearded man wearing an artisan’s skull
cap and an enveloping cloak or shroud. As “he who is beautiful of face,” Ptah
had skin of celestial blue. His scepter combined the djed symbol of stability
with the was symbol of dominion and the ankh symbol of life. He bestowed
these three qualities on Egyptian kings, who were often crowned in his temple
at Memphis.
Ptah’s consort was the solar lioness Sekhmet. Their son was Nefertem, the
god of the primeval lotus. Ptah was also credited with siring Imhotep, a histori
cal figure who was deified as god of medicine and learning. The Apis bull, the
most important sacred animal in Egypt, was the earthly messenger and visible
ba (soul or manifestation) of Ptah.
A Mansion of Ptah is mentioned twice in the Pyramid Texts. This may be
the same Mansion of the ka of Ptah (Egyptian— .Hwt ka Ptah; Greek—Aigyptos)
that eventually gave its name to the whole country. In the Middle Kingdom,
Ptah was already known as a divine craftsman who could make a new body for
a dead person. Ptah became the particular patron of metalworkers and sculp
tors. That dwarfs were traditionally employed to make jewelry may have been a
factor in the development of a dwarf form (pataikos) of Ptah. The Greeks later
equated Ptah with their bandy-legged smith god, Hephaistos.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 181



Ptah was said to have invented the Opening of the Mouth ritual that was
used to symbolically animate cult and ka statues and reanimate mummies.
Osiris was the mythical prototype for all mummies, so in Coffin Texts spell 62
Ptah helps Horus to “break open” the mouth of Osiris and let him breathe
again. During the New Kingdom, Ptah acquired a reputation as a compassionate
deity. As Ptah “of the Hearing Ear,” he listened to the prayers of ordinary
people.
The text known as the Memphite Theology may date to the late New
Kingdom. In it, Ptah is acclaimed as a self-created deity who made everything
that existed through the powers of thought and speech. This concept is recon
ciled with the theology of Heliopolis by identifying Ptah with many of the
deities from the creation myths of that city. Ptah was linked with Nun and
Naunet, the deities of the Primeval Waters who “gave birth” to Atum.
Alternatively, Ptah was said to have shaped the creator Atum with his heart
and tongue. Ptah-Tatjenen was the personification of the Primeval Mound, the
place where creation began. Taking the role of Shu, Ptah was said to have made
the sky and lifted it above the earth as easily as if it were a feather. He united
the Two Lands (Egypt) as Horus in his “great name of Tatjenen.” One of the so
phisticated hymns in Papyrus Leiden I 350 reduces the Egyptian pantheon to
three. Amun was hidden power, Ra the visible power in the heavens, and Ptah
the power manifest on or in the earth.
Ptah was also part of the triple entity Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. This divine group
has been interpreted as symbolizing the whole cycle of regeneration, with Ptah
standing for creation, Sokar for death as metamorphosis, and Osiris for rebirth.
Ptah-Sokar-Osiris was sometimes shown presiding over the judgment of the
dead in the Hall of the Two Truths. He remained important in funerary religion
right into the Roman Period.

the primeval form of the creator to make the cosmos and its laws. He ruled as
King of the Gods, first on earth and later from the heavens. Ra was born to his
mother the sky goddess each morning. He passed through many transforma
tions before being absorbed back into her each evening. Alternatively, the
progress of the sun was pictured as a voyage across the skies above and below
the earth. Each night the divine crew of the solar barque had to overcome the
forces of chaos so that Ra could revive the sleeping dead and renew the world.
The name Ra is simply the Egyptian word for the sun, the most visible of
the divine forces that created and sustained the world. The cult of Ra seems to
have originated in the town that the Egyptians called Iunu and the Greeks
Heliopolis (“city of the sun god”). From the twenty-sixth century BCE to the
Roman Period, all rulers of Egypt called themselves Sons of Ra. The Enemies of
Ra were the enemies of Egypt and maat (the divine order). The close identifica
tion between Ra and the divine order was expressed by making the goddess
Maat into Ra’s best-loved daughter.
In some Pyramid Texts of the Old Kingdom, the dead king claims to rest
like the sun in the west and shine like the sun in the east. In others, he humbly

asks for a place among the spirits who escort the “reed-float” or papyrus boat of
Ra across the Winding Waterway of the sky. In the Coffin Texts of the Middle
Kingdom there is an increased emphasis on the dangers of this voyage. When
the Night Boat enters the caverns under the earth or within the body of the sky
goddess, it is attacked by hostile forces such as the all-devouring chaos monster
Apophis. Surviving temple rituals show that every Egyptian king was expected
to play an active magical role to help the sun god to triumph over the forces of
darkness and chaos.
The secret Underworld Books that decorate New Kingdom royal tombs
link the fate of deceased kings and all the dead with the voyage of the sun (see
“The Solar Cycle” under “Cyclical Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). Just as
morning light wakes sleepers in life, the passing sun god reanimated the mum
mies of the virtuous dead and his own mysterious nocturnal forms. In the un
derworld, Ra himself was mainly shown as a ram-headed man, or a scarab
within a solar disk, in the cabin of the solar barque (see Figure 38). This central
figure is sometimes labeled as the “flesh” of Ra. For much of the voyage the
sun god is as passive as the corpse of Osiris while a huge array of other deities
protect and defend him. The forceful power of the sun is concentrated in the
goddess known as the Eye of Ra, who often guards the prow of the solar bar
que. Much solar mythology was expressed by images rather than narratives.
The solar cycle could be summarized by showing Khepri (the scarab beetle),
Ra-Horakhty (a falcon-headed man), and Ra-Atum (a mature man wearing the
Double Crown) together in the solar barque. Khepri was the self-generating sun
of dawn. Ra-Horakhty (Ra-Horus of the Double Horizon) was the triumphant
sun who rose in the east as ruler. Ra-Atum was the weary setting sun whose
death was an essential part of the cycle of renewal. The sun god could also be
depicted with four rams’ heads representing his four bas (souls or manifesta
tions) (see Figure 19). The four souls are often named as Ra, Khepri, Atum, and
Osiris. In some Underworld Books, Ra mysteriously merges with the corpse of
Osiris, the ruler of the underworld. When they become “the United One,” the
dead can reawaken and the world can be remade.
The fact that the sun god was crucial to the theology of kingship may have
led to a rather uncomplimentary portrayal of Ra in Egyptian literature. In some
narrative myths, Ra appears as an aging king unable to prevent treachery and re
bellion among his subjects (see “The True Name of Ra” and “The Destruction
of Humanity” under “Linear Time” in “Mythical Time Lines”). The Book of
the Heavenly Cow tells how the weary Ra withdrew to the heavens after bru
tally punishing the humans who had rebelled against his rule on earth. Egyptian
Instruction Texts sometimes interpret invasions or civil strife as punishments
from the angry sun god.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology

In the cycle of myths centered on Horus, son of Isis, Ra is a remote author
ity figure who does not always support the weak against the strong. When the
infant Horus is poisoned, his mother’s screams of anguish stop the solar barque
from moving. This challenged both the power of Ra and the authority of the
king, whose ritual task it was to secure a “free passage” for the sun. Ra gives in
to the righteous anger of Isis and sends his deputy Thoth to heal Horus. An al
ternative view of the sun god is found in a Greco-Roman Period narrative about
the Eye of Ra. The wise god Thoth persuades the Eye goddess to return to her
father Ra by telling her fables that show that the sun god is all-seeing and fre
quently intervenes to establish justice on earth.

RENENUTET (ERNUTET, HERMOUTHIS, THERMOUTHIS)
Renenutet was a cobra goddess of fertility and luck whose name meant “the
snake who nourishes.” She could be represented by various combinations of
snake and woman, including a cobra-headed woman suckling a child.
Renenutet was associated with the nourishing and healing powers of mother’s
milk and with food of all kinds. As the deity who controlled the harvest, she
was the mother of the corn god, Neper. In the rich farmlands of the Fayum she
was worshipped as the consort of the crocodile god Sobek and the mother of
Horus.
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 185



In the Pyramid Texts, Renenutet is one of the names given to the fire
breathing uraeus on the king’s brow. She could be identified with other head
gear and clothes worn by the dead king to cause gods and demons to fear him.
Renenutet was also one of the divine foster mothers who nourished the royal ka
(vital force) of each king.
Even in her cobra manifestation, Renenutet was revered by farmers and
housewives as a gracious and beautiful goddess. The cobra-shaped bowls and
figurines commonly found in Ancient Egyptian houses probably represented
Renenutet, the Mistress of Provisions. As Lady of the Granaries, she helped to
protect Egypt’s vital grain supplies from rats and other vermin. In the myth
Astarte and the Sea, Renenutet is chosen by the gods to present the tribute de
manded by the rapacious sea. This was probably because she was responsible for
the good things of the earth.
Renenutet should probably be regarded as identical with Renenet, a goddess
who formed a pair with Shai, the god of fate. Renenet was said to be “on the
shoulder” of deserving people from birth, bringing them good fortune. In the
Greco-Roman Period, her role as goddess of fortune was gradually taken over by
Isis-Thermouthis.

SATET (SATIS) AND ANUKET (ANUKIS)
Satet and Anuket were two goddesses worshipped in the region of the First
Cataract of the Nile. Satet, Lady of Elephantine, was shown as a mature woman
wearing a version of the crown of Upper Egypt decorated with antelope horns.
Anuket, Lady of Nubia, was shown as a young woman wearing a feather head
dress. Her sacred animal was the gazelle, a creature admired by the Egyptians
for its delicate beauty. Both goddesses are called daughters of Ra, but from the
late Middle Kingdom onward they formed a triad with Khnum, the ram god of
Elephantine (modern Aswan). It is not clear whether Satet and Anuket were re
garded as mother and daughter or as senior and junior consorts. Khnum, Satet,
and Anuket were probably treated as a group because all three were linked to
the annual Nile flood.

A rock shrine on the island of Elephantine was one of Egypt’s most ancient
holy places. It was often thought of as the “source” of the inundation. River
worn pebbles in the forms of pregnant or nursing women found in the shrine
suggest that it was dedicated to a fertility goddess. In later times the most im
portant nilometer in Egypt was situated in the temple of Satet on Elephantine.
This measured the height of the inundation as it reached the Egyptian border.
Satet was associated with the purifying powers of Nile water and desert spring
water. Her sacred animal, the antelope, was renowned for its ability to find wa
ter in the desert. The Pyramid Texts mention the four water jars of Satet that
are used to purify the dead king so that he can take his place among the gods.
By the Greco-Roman Period, Satet (Mistress of the Water of Life) was identified
with the star goddess Sopdet-Isis. The heliacal rising of Sopdet (Sirius) coincided
with the coming of the inundation.
This awe-inspiring natural phenomenon became linked to the myth of the
return of the Distant Goddess, the Eye of Ra. Satet seems to have represented
the ferocious aspect of this goddess. In Pyramid Text 439, Satet, the Fiery One,
claims to be a deity more powerful than Ra. In the Coffin Texts, Satet defends
the dead against dangers from the south with her pain-inflicting arrows. As pro
tector of Upper Egypt, Satet was sometimes paired with the warrior god Montu.
Anuket, the beloved daughter of Ra, usually represented the pacified form of
the Eye goddess. She controlled the fertilizing power of the Nile flood. Her
breast milk nourished and healed, and she was one of the divine foster mothers
of every Egyptian king.

SEKHMET (SAKHMET)
Sekhmet was an aggressive solar goddess who was the instrument of divine retri
bution. She was shown with the body of a woman and a leonine head, often sur
mounted by a sun disk. Death first came into the world when the Eye of Ra was
sent down as Sekhmet to punish rebellious humanity. “She who dances on blood”
nearly destroyed the whole human race before she was tricked into stopping. As
humans were said to have sprung from the tears of the Eye of Ra, Sekhmet was
slaughtering her own children. She was a more protective mother to the kings of
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 187



Egypt, and in Memphis she was
worshipped as the consort of Ptah
and the mother of Nefertem.
In the Pyramid Texts,
Sekhmet was named as a parent
of the king when he was reborn
into the celestial afterlife. In the
Coffin Texts, she was identified
with the Red Crown of Lower
Egypt and with the fire-spitting
uraeus: “the serpent who is upon
her father.” She was said to be
“the one who wields the knife”
on the night of the great battle
between the forces of order and
chaos. In New Kingdom funer
ary literature, Sekhmet often
stands in the solar barque to de
fend Ra from the Apophis ser
pent. Users of the Book of the
Dead hoped to destroy their su
pernatural enemies “as Sekhmet
the Great would.”
King Rameses II claimed that Sekhmet the Great rode with him in his char
iot, ready to destroy the enemy with her fiery breath. She seems to have embod
ied the negative qualities of the heat of the sun that could lead to sunstroke,
drought, famines, and epidemics. Of all the archer goddesses in the Egyptian
pantheon, Sekhmet was the most dreaded. Her arrows came to be personified as
seven messengers who inflicted plague and destruction on humanity. As the
controller of disease demons, Sekhmet became a patron goddess of medicine.
From the Old Kingdom onward, the priests of Sekhmet seem to have been spe
cialists in healing magic.
Sekhmet had to be propitiated during the dangerous transition from the
old to the new year, when infectious diseases were a particular danger. Spells
and rituals were used to transform the raging solar lioness into a beneficent
goddess. From the New Kingdom onward, Sekhmet was mainly thought of as
the aggressive aspect of greater goddesses: first of Hathor, then of Mut, and fi
nally of Isis.

SERQET (SERKET, SELKIS)
The goddess Serqet was usually shown as a woman with a scorpion on her head
(see Figure 20) or as a scorpion with the head and torso of a woman. She con
trolled the breath of life and was one of the four goddesses who traditionally
protected the body and vital organs of a dead person. Serqet was also one of the
formidable deities who defended the divine mother and the boat of the sun god.
Scorpion charmers invoked the power of Serqet to drive away scorpions and
snakes.
Scorpion stings were a common hazard in Ancient Egypt. The female scor
pion is larger than the male and has a greater supply of poison. Representations of
Serqet always show the tail raised in the stinging position. Scorpion stings cause a
burning pain and shortness of breath and can be fatal to young children and the
elderly. This seems to have led to the belief that Serqet could help the dead to
breathe again as part of the process of rebirth. To indicate that Serqet was a benev
olent goddess, she was sometimes represented by a harmless type of water scor
pion rather than the poisonous type. She was shown on the east side of coffins
and canopic chests as a guardian goddess. In the Book of Two Ways, Serqet is one
of the deities who guards a bend in the river on the watery route to paradise.
Scorpions and snakes were classed together as enemies of humanity and the
divine order, and many spells were devised to repel them. The Egyptians hoped
that by honoring the scorpion goddess, they could save themselves from all poi
sonous creatures. Serqet defended the sun god from the great snake Apophis,
and she appears in some narrative spells as the helper of her “sister” Isis.
One spell to drive out poison includes a story about how the pregnant Isis
fled to the marshes to hide from her brother, Seth. On her journey she was pro
tected by seven scorpions, who were probably a sevenfold manifestation of
Serqet. Isis tried to shelter in a village. A rich woman refused to let Isis into her
house, but a poor marsh girl welcomed the goddess into her hut. The scorpions
were angry about this and decided to punish the rich woman. They placed all
their poison in the tail of Tfn, the leading scorpion. Tfn crept into the rich
woman’s house and stung her baby son. Isis was wakened by the rich woman’s
cries and took pity on the child. She was able to drive out the burning poison
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 189



and make the child breathe again because she knew the true names of the seven
scorpions. The rich woman was so grateful that she gave all her possessions to
the poor girl in order to please the goddess. Myths of this type may have been
acted out at a festival known from the Roman Period during which devotees of
Isis handled live scorpions.

SESHAT (SECHAT)
Seshat was the goddess who measured and recorded the world. As Lady of
Builders she was the patroness of architecture, astronomy, and mathematics.
Known as “she who is foremost in the library,” Seshat was an assistant or fe
male counterpart of Thoth, the god of wisdom and knowledge. She and Thoth
fixed the length of a king’s reign by inscribing his name on the leaves of the
ished tree at Heliopolis.
Seshat usually wears a panther skin, a symbol of priestly office. She some
times carries a palm frond carved with notches to mark the passing years. Her
mysterious headdress consists of a seven-pointed star (or seven-petaled flower)
topped by an object that may be a bow or an inverted pair of horns. The goddess
known as Sefkhat-abwy (the Seven-Pointed One) is probably Seshat under an
other name.
As goddess of writing, Seshat was the keeper of royal annals and genealo
gies. She was shown recording the booty gained by kings in battle, perhaps as a
reminder that a share was due to the gods. Seshat was even said to descend into
the underworld to record everything in the realm of the dead.
From as early as the Second Dynasty, she was shown assisting kings to lay
out the foundations for temples and align them with stars and planets. In the di
vine realm, Seshat was in charge of building the mansions of the gods. She was
sometimes assisted in this task by the gods of sight and hearing. Seshat also
built “mansions in the West” for the fortunate dead.
Seshat was occasionally identified as an aspect of another helper of the
dead, the goddess Nephthys. In a Coffin Texts spell, Seshat is said to be angry at
a child she gives birth to, just as later tradition made Nephthys reject her son,
Anubis. In other Coffin Texts, Thoth and Seshat “bring writings to a man in the

realm of the dead.” These writings were the spells that would help the dead per
son to vanquish the terrors of the underworld and become a powerful spirit.

SETH (SET, SUTEKH)
Seth, the tumultuous god who was the enemy of his brother, Osiris, and the ri
val of Horus, was one of the five children of Nut and Geb. Seth’s sister,
Nephthys, and the foreign goddesses Anat and Astarte were among his consorts.
Seth acts as a catalyst in Egyptian myth. His thoughtless actions are bad in
themselves but can lead to good outcomes, such as that of Osiris becoming the
ruler of the underworld. The brute strength of Seth was needed by the gods to
defend the solar barque from the chaos monster.

The cult of Seth seems to have originated in Upper Egypt, though he was
later identified with foreign gods worshipped in the eastern Delta. In the Early
Dynastic Period, Seth, Lord of Ombos, was the chief god of the eastern desert
and its rich gold mines. In the western desert he remained the Lord of the Oases
and their vineyards into the Greco-Roman Period. At all periods, Seth was asso
ciated with dangerous aspects of the desert such as flash floods and sandstorms.
Many desert animals, particularly oryxes, wild asses, and the mythical griffin,
were considered Sethian creatures. Seth himself was represented by a sinister
imaginary animal. In myth, Seth takes the form of many different animals, such
as bulls, pigs, hippopotami, wild asses, crocodiles, and panthers, to carry out de
structive acts.
From the Pyramid Texts onward, Seth was accused of striking down Osiris.
Vague allusions to Seth trampling or rending Osiris were eventually trans
formed into stories of complex murder plots. The two gods were often pre
sented as opposites. Osiris could stand for order and everything that was
Egyptian. Seth could stand for disorder and everything that was foreign. Osiris
ruled the fertile black land of the Nile valley, and Seth the barren red land of the
deserts. As the god “who causes storms and clouds,” Seth was also the natural
opponent of the solar sky falcon Horus the Elder. Alternatively, this conflict
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
192

of an unknown animal. (Courtesy of Geraldine Pinch)



could be stated in terms of a dynastic feud and a struggle for justice between
Seth the Usurper and Horus the Younger, the posthumous son of Osiris.
During this long struggle Seth was wounded in the testicles and Horus in
the eyes. In the New Kingdom story, the Contendings of Horus and Seth, the
two gods alternate between arguing their cases in front of the Divine Tribunal
and fighting each other. Seth’s main weapon is a gigantic mace or was scepter
that only he can lift. He is presented as massively strong and monumentally
stupid, like a giant in a fairy tale.
In temples of Horus, the story ends with a total military victory for Horus
and annihilation for Seth and his followers. In other sources, terms for peace are
agreed so that the Two Lords (Horus and Seth) can work together to unite Egypt
and defend the cosmos. One of the secrets revealed in the royal Underworld
Books was the joining of the Two Lords into one double-headed being to combat
the forces of chaos in the hour of greatest danger. As “the great of strength in the
Boat of Millions,” Seth speared and bound Apophis every night (see Figure 43).
The concept of the perpetual struggle between Seth and Apophis was paired
with a story of a single combat that took place in the mythical past. When the
world was still directly ruled by the gods, Seth fought Yam, the insatiable sea,
who was threatening to swallow the earth. The ending is missing in the only
narrative version of this myth, but several New Kingdom spells claim that the
magician will overcome demons just as Seth once overcame the sea monster.
Other New Kingdom texts describe Seth as committing a series of sacrile
gious crimes such as felling sacred trees and hunting sacred fish, birds, and ani
mals. He was also notorious for breaking sexual taboos. His lustful nature leads
him into inappropriate heterosexual and homosexual encounters. In one myth
he is punished for mating with the “seed goddess,” who personified the semen
of the creator. In another, Seth’s attempt to sexually dominate his rival, Horus,
leads to the unnatural birth of the moon god Thoth.
From the late New Kingdom onward, ritual scripts and narrative myths
deal with attacks by Seth on the body of Osiris. Secretions from the corpse were
said to play a vital role in making the Nile rise, crops grow, and women con
ceive children, so these were attacks on life itself. Seth disguises himself to try
to steal the amulets protecting the body of Osiris. He is always recognized and
brutally punished by Anubis and Thoth. At Edfu the priesthood of Horus cele
brated a day of castrating Seth and “reducing him to pieces” in retaliation for
Seth’s mutilation of the body of Osiris and the Eye of Horus. The actual ritual
involved the sacrifice and dismemberment of a wild ass in front of a cult state
of Osiris.
By the Greco-Roman Period, Seth was vilified in most temples. The Greeks
identified Seth with the monster Typhon, who rebelled against the gods and had
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 193



to be destroyed by Zeus. Seth-Typhon was invoked in spells to kill the magi
cian’s enemies as he had killed his own brother, Osiris, or to separate lovers as
he had separated Osiris and Isis.

SEVEN HATHORS
The seven manifestations of Hathor presided over births and deaths. They pro
nounced the ultimate fate of all humans.
See also Cattle; Hathor; Shai
SHAI (SHAY)
Shai was the personification of destiny. Every individual had his or her own
shai, a personal destiny that helped to make that person unique. As a god, Shai
might be shown in either human or snake form. He could be identified with any
of the creator deities who shaped the destiny of the whole universe.
Shai was one of the deities credited with fixing the length of a person’s life
and the manner of his or her death. He also came to be associated with good or
bad fortune in life. In the city of Alexandria, Shai was transformed into a snake
god of fate and luck known as Agathos Daimon.
Shai was often paired with the goddesses Meskhenet or Renenutet, who
presided over the vulnerable periods of a person’s birth and infancy. In the Book
of the Dead, Shai can be shown next to the scales in which the heart of the de
ceased person is weighed. Like the goddesses Meskhenet and Renenutet, he oc
casionally took the form of a “birth-brick” with a human head. These bricks
were the supports on which Egyptian women squatted to give birth. As deities
of the birth-bricks, Shai and his female counterparts helped the souls of the de
ceased to be reborn.
Egyptian thinkers debated how far a person’s fate was predestined. Some
Instruction Texts took the pessimistic view that it was impossible to evade
your fate, but hymns and prayers claimed that gods such as Amun had the
power to change a person’s destiny and bestow extra years of life. A New
Kingdom story tells how a longed-for son was born to the king and queen of
Egypt. On the night of his birth, the Seven Hathors announced that the prince
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
194



was destined to be killed by a snake, a crocodile, or a dog. The king tried to save
his son by shutting him in a remote palace away from all animals. When he
grew up, the prince begged to be released on the grounds that his fate was “in
the heart of god.” He traveled to the land of Naharin and married a princess
who had also been imprisoned by her father. She saved the prince from his first
fate, the snake. The prince managed to escape from his second fate, the dog,
only to be seized by his third fate, the crocodile.
The end of the story is missing, but the last words imply that the prince
may be able to save himself by fighting the crocodile’s enemy. The prince in
this story seems to have much in common with a god called Shed who became
popular at the end of the New Kingdom. Shed, whose name means savior or
protector, was shown as a young prince overcoming dangerous animals such as
snakes, crocodiles, and lions. The story of the Doomed Prince seems to drama
tize the Egyptian hope that human courage and divine intervention could save
an individual from a bad shai.

SHU (SCHU, CHOU) AND TEFNUT (TEFENET)
Shu and Tefnut were the children of the creator sun god. They were the first di
vine couple and formed the second generation in the family tree of deities
known as the Ennead of Heliopolis. Shu was the god of dry, life-giving air and
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 195



sunlight, who first separated the earth from the sky. Tefnut may have been as
sociated with some types of moisture, such as morning dew.
Shu and Tefnut were produced by an androgynous creator god, usually iden
tified as Atum or Ra-Atum. He is said to have masturbated and swallowed his
own semen in order to reproduce himself. As a result of this act, Shu was
sneezed out and Tefnut was spat out. Atum then lovingly embraced his
“fledglings.”
At first, Shu and Tefnut were not fully differentiated from the creator. In
the Coffin Texts they are often treated as a trinity: “the one who developed into
three.” This may be why the monotheistic theology of King Akhenaten found a
place for Shu and Tefnut as aspects of the god of light. Some early statues of
Akhenaten and his queen, Nefertiti, probably represent them as Shu and
Tefnut.
In more orthodox Egyptian thought, some kind of separation was necessary
for the process of creation to continue. Texts ranging in date from the Middle
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
196

Kingdom to the Greco-Roman Period describe how Shu and Tefnut left their fa
ther, either accidentally or in order to explore. They were soon lost in the dark
ness that surrounded the creator. The creator became lonely and anxious. He
took the “sole eye from his forehead” and sent her out to seek for his lost chil
dren. Some versions imply that Shu and Tefnut were lost for a very long period.
They seem to be adult when they return with the Eye of Ra.
The first sexual union of male (Shu) and female (Tefnut) produced two chil
dren, the earth god Geb and the sky goddess Nut. These two passionately em
braced until they were separated by their father, Shu. This act of separation is
one of the most commonly depicted mythical scenes in Egyptian art. Shu is
shown in human form, with a feather on his head, trampling on the body of Geb
and holding up the body of Nut. Shu becomes a cosmic giant “whose stride is
the length of the sky.” He was assisted by various deities known as “the sup
porters of Shu.” The most important of these were the eight Heh gods whom
Shu created out of his own bodily fluids.
By separating the earth and sky and making a void filled with air and sun
light, Shu allowed the process of creation to begin. He therefore counted as a
creator deity. He was also one of the deities said to have ruled over Egypt after
the departure of the sun god to the heavens. One list gives him a reign of 700
years. According to a late myth, he eventually lost his throne and his consort,
Tefnut, to his son, Geb.
Tefnut, “the greatly beloved daughter,” was sometimes identified with two
other “daughters” of the creator sun god: Maat, the personification of the divine
order, and the Eye of Ra. In some versions of the story of the Eye goddess,
Hathor-Tefnut, the fiery solar eye, quarrels with her father and goes to live in
the desert in the form of a savage lioness. Her brother, Shu, is sometimes
named as the god who persuades her to return.
Shu and Tefnut were also identified with the twin Lions of the Horizon.
They are shown as two lions or spotted great cats, facing away from each other
with the sun on the horizon between them. These lions had various temporal
meanings. They could represent yesterday and tomorrow or two forms of time:
n.h.h (eternal recurrence) and -d- t (eternal sameness).

SIA AND HU (HW)
Sia and Hu were the principles of creative thought and speech personified as
gods. Sia has also been translated as perception or insightful planning and Hu
as authority or authoritative utterance. Sia and Hu, along with a third deity,
Heka (Magic), were the forces the creator used to make the world and the di
vine order.
As deities, Sia and Hu were said to have sprung from blood that dripped
from the penis of Ra. The two gods were regarded as the constant companions
of the creator sun god. In the Pyramid Texts, Sia “who is at the right hand of
Ra” is in charge of wisdom and carrying the god’s book. He is also described
as being “in” the eye of Ra, so that the sun god can see and understand every
thing that happens in the world. In the Coffin Texts, Hu is called “the one
who speaks in the darkness,” presumably the primeval dark before light was
created.
A Middle Kingdom text asks how the creator, who has Sia, Hu, and Maat
(the divine order) always with him, can have allowed Egypt to descend into
chaos. In New Kingdom Underworld Books, Sia and Hu are often shown stand
ing in the solar barque with Ra. Sia acts as a spokesman for Ra during the noc
turnal journey of the sun. He gives the order to open each of the twelve gates of
the underworld.

SNAKES
Antisnake spells are among the oldest of all Egyptian texts, and many magical
objects show deities helping humanity by overcoming poisonous snakes.
Mythical snakes were found on both sides of the battle between order and
chaos. Several creator deities had a primeval snake form. The ability to shed
their skins made snakes an obvious symbol of eternal renewal. The cobra, who
rears up and spits poison at anything that threatens her young, was adopted as a
general symbol of female divinity. The uraeus on royal crowns had a mythical
precedent in the cobra goddess who protected the creator sun god in the First
Time. Yet the greatest enemy of the sun god was Apophis, a giant serpent with
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology
198



crushing coils and hypnotic eyes. An Egyptian proverb states: “One should wel
come the uraeus and spit on Apophis.”
The Greek term uraeus probably comes from an Egyptian word iaret,
which means “the one who rears up.” When the creator god Ra-Atum lost his
children in the dark primeval waters, he sent his Sole Eye to look for them. The
Eye goddess returned with the lost children to find that Ra-Atum had grown a
new eye. She was enraged, but Ra-Atum transformed her into a snake with
power over all other deities. Her fiery poison destroyed anyone who challenged
the sun god and his rightful heirs. All snake goddesses could be identified with
this fire-spitting cobra, whatever their other functions. Isis was clever enough
to turn this serpent power against Ra in order to win the throne of Egypt for her
future son. When the sun god withdrew to the heavens, he charged Geb with
controlling the dangerous serpents who lived under the earth.
Three important cobra goddesses were associated with the three environ
ments where snakes were most often encountered: marshes (Wadjyt), cornfields
(Renenutet), and desert hills (Meretseger). Like the divine cow, the cobra god
dess could be shown protecting an infant god in a papyrus thicket. This god is
sometimes named as Nefertem, the child in the lotus. Wadjyt’s name links her
with Egyptian words meaning papyrus and freshness or greenness. She could
embody the constantly renewed vitality of the marsh vegetation.
Renenutet, “the good snake,” was the goddess of fields, granaries, and
kitchens. She ensured a bountiful harvest for the living and continuing nourish
ment for the kas of the dead. The snake deity, Nehebkau (“the numerous of
coils”), was considered to be her son. In the Pyramid Texts, Nehebkau feeds the

dead king and acts as his messenger, but only after he has been subdued by the
finger of Atum.
Meretseger was another snake deity who was not always benevolent. She
was the goddess of the pyramid-shaped mountain peak that overlooked the
Valley of the Kings and the Valley of the Queens at Thebes (see Figure 5). Her
name means “the one who loves silence.” The artists who worked on the royal
tombs felt that they needed to propitiate Meretseger before they could work
safely in her domain. One of them describes Meretseger as striking like a lion
when she was angry but coming like a sweet breeze when she was appeased.
Meretseger’s mountain was one of the entrances to the underworld. Snakes
were said to sleep below the earth like the dead every night and come alive
again by day. The visions of the underworld painted on the walls of the royal
tombs writhe with snakes. Snake-headed demons and fire-spitting snakes pun
ish evil souls. Each of the twelve gates of the underworld has a snake guardian,
and the solar barque and the corpse of Osiris were protected by the coils of the
mehen snake, a kind of counter-Apophis (see, for example, Figure 38). Time it
self was depicted as an endless snake that swallows up the hours. One of these
images, the “Ouroboros” or “tail-in-mouth” serpent, passed into other cultures
as a symbol of infinity (see Figure 18).

SOBEK (SUCHOS)
Sobek, the “raging one,” was shown as a crocodile or as a man with the head of
crocodile wearing an atef crown. He was mainly worshipped in areas of the
country where the Nile crocodile was a dangerous predator. Sobek was said to
be the son of Neith, a goddess who embodied the primeval waters. His consort
was sometimes Hathor and sometimes the harvest goddess Renenutet. From
the New Kingdom onward, he was regarded as a form of the creator sun god “in
his identity of Sobek-Ra.”
At Krokodilopolis in the Fayum, Sobek was praised as the one “who rose
out of the primeval waters, the great male being, the lord of the floating is
lands.” He was honored everywhere as a god of water. Sobek was the Lord of the

Winding Waterway, the Lord of the Nile, and the one “who greens the Two
Banks,” an epithet he shared with the inundation god Hapy. As Lord of the
Marsh, Sobek was particularly associated with the marshes that lay between
the Nile valley and the edge of the desert. In the celestial realm, Sobek inhab
ited a glittering mansion in the liminal region of the horizon.
People who worked on the Nile had good reason to fear and respect
crocodiles. Sobek seems to have become the patron god of fishermen. A myth
mentioned in the Coffin Texts tells how Isis cut off the hands of her son Horus
and threw them in the river. Ra ordered Sobek to retrieve the hands of Horus.
Sobek was unable to do so until he invented a fish trap to catch the hands.
Many fish were regarded as creatures of chaos, so as a fish eater, Sobek was
helping to establish order.
On other occasions, however, Sobek was counted among the enemies of the
divine order. In one spell in the Coffin Texts, Sobek “the rebel” is held responsi
ble for mutilating the body of the good god Osiris. Sobek was sometimes identi
fied with the crocodile form of Seth, the slayer of Osiris. The Greco-Roman
Period temple of Kom Ombo was jointly dedicated to Horus the Elder and
Sobek. It is possible that at this site Sobek represented an acceptable manifesta

SOKAR (SOKER, SOKARIS)
The ancient god of the cemeteries of Memphis, Sokar became the god of death
as a transformative process. His qualities were often combined with those of
the chief god of Memphis and the god of the dead to form the tripartite deity
Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. The annual Festival of Sokar was one of the great events of
the Egyptian ritual calendar.

guarded by the Aker sphinx. Detail from the Amduat (Book of that which is in the
Underworld) painted in the tomb of Thutmose III at Thebes. (Courtesy of Nigel Strudwick)



Sokar could be represented by a human or hawk head emerging from a
mound or chest. He could also be shown as a shrouded hawk or as a hawk
headed man or mummy. The silver hawk-headed anthropoid coffin of
Sheshonq I (c. 945–924 BCE) was probably intended to transform the dead king
into Sokar.
As a chthonic deity, Sokar had to be appeased when canals were dug, fields
were plowed, or underground tombs were built. He was also a divine craftsman,
responsible for making the silver bowls in which the feet of the dead were
washed. At some point this aspect of Sokar seems to have been transferred to
Ptah. Ptah and Sokar could be paired as creator deity and god of the dead as Ra
and Osiris often were.
As early as the Old Kingdom, Sokar was said to be the name of Osiris after
he was murdered by his brother Seth. In the Book of What Is in the Underworld,
Sokar presides over a snake-infested desert region that must be crossed by the
sun god and the royal dead. Sokar, Lord of the Mysterious Region, dwells in a
cavern guarded by the two-headed Aker-sphinx. There he repeatedly overcomes
a multiheaded chaos serpent. In later Underworld Books, it is the body of Sokar
Osiris that lies in this mysterious cavern waiting for the reviving light of the
sun. The spirits of the dead were thought to join in the Festival of Sokar, which
seems to have celebrated the power to journey between the realms of the living
and the dead. The image of the god was dragged through the necropolis in his
henu barque, a special boat decorated with images of fish and antelopes. Sokar
was accompanied by five daughters of Ra in the forms of geese.
Statuettes of Ptah-Sokar-Osiris placed in tombs sometimes contain copies
of the Book of the Dead. Others conceal corn mummies, symbolic bodies of
Sokar-Osiris, to help the tomb owner attain resurrection. Figures of Sokar were
prepared as part of the month-long Khoiak Festival, the annual reenactment of
the mysteries of Osiris. The instructions for making these figures were said to
be based on a divine prototype. The goddess Shentayet of Busiris made a new
body for Sokar out of clay, dates, sweet-smelling spices, and precious stones and
metals. The mixture was shaped into an egg and then divided among fourteen
vessels. This links Sokar to lunar myths of destruction and renewal.

SONS OF HORUS
The four gods Imsety, Hapy (not the same as the inundation god), Duamutef,
and Qebehsenuef were known collectively as the Sons of Horus. They were the
traditional guardians of the four canopic jars used to hold mummified organs.
Imsety generally protected the liver, Hapy the lungs, Duamutef the stomach,
and Qebehsenuef the intestines. The four sons were also associated with the
four directions (south, north, east, and west) and with four vital components for
survival after death: the heart, the ba, the ka, and the mummy. Imsety is usu
ally shown in full human form, but Hapy sometimes has the head of a baboon,
Duamutef that of a jackal, and Qebehsenuef that of a hawk.
In the Pyramid Texts, the Children of Horus are invoked to protect “Osiris
the king,” support his body, and beat up his “great enemy.” These roles are re
peated in a Middle Kingdom ritual drama in which the Sons of Horus fight the
Followers of Seth and then lift the body of Osiris into the heavens. Imsety,
Hapy, Duamutef, and Qebehsenuef were sometimes identified with the four pil
lars that held up the sky.
Obscure passages in the Coffin Texts seem to name Isis and Horus the
Elder as the parents of these four deities. Kinship terms were often used very
loosely in Ancient Egypt, so son can just mean descendant. The Sons of Horus
were sometimes treated as identical with the group of royal demigods known as
the Souls of Pe and Nekhen. After the reign of Horus, the Souls ruled the king
doms of Upper or Lower Egypt. According to one spell, the Souls of Nekhen
(Hierakonpolis) could be quarrelsome and were not always willing to obey
Horus.
From the New Kingdom onward, the Sons of Horus formed part of a group
of seven star gods who helped Anubis to protect the body of Osiris. In the Book
of the Dead, the sons are present when the dead are judged before Osiris. They
were often shown standing on a blue lotus, like a fourfold version of the infant
sun god who emerged from the primeval lotus (Figure 7).
The four sons came to be regarded as powerful protectors for all the dead.
Pallbearers at funerals played the roles of the Sons of Horus carrying the corpse
of Osiris. The sons were often named or shown on coffins and canopic chests,
paired with the four protective goddesses: Isis, Nephthys, Neith, and Serqet.
The heads of the four sons formed the stoppers for sets of canopic jars. If the in
ternal organs were returned to a mummy, figures of the Sons of Horus were
sewn to the mummy wrappings or placed inside the body cavity. Their function
was to prevent any parts of the body being lost. The terrible fate of the body of
Osiris was never to be repeated.

SOPDU (SOPEDU, SOPED)
The warrior god Sopdu presided over the harsh environment of the eastern
desert. Sopdu, Lord of the East, was one of the guardians of the four directions.
As the “sharp-toothed one” he protected the dead from attackers from the east
or southeast. He could be shown as a falcon perched on a standard or as a
bearded man wearing a plumed headdress and carrying a battle-ax.
Some representations of Sopdu, Lord of the Foreign Lands, resemble the no
madic Bedouin tribesmen of the eastern desert and Sinai peninsula. From early
times, Sopdu was revered as a protector of the turquoise mines of Sinai, where
he was paired with Hathor, Lady of Turquoise.
Sopdu was sometimes called “the eastern Horus.” In the Pyramid Texts,
Horus-Sopdu is said to be the son of Sopdet and Sah, the astral forms of Isis and
Osiris. Sopdu “of the shining plumes” was a form of the cosmic falcon who
could be addressed as the oldest of beings. This Sopdu falcon dwelled in a sacred
grove, which probably grew on the Primeval Mound.
Like other warrior deities, Sopdu had the epithet “great of strength.” He ha
bitually raised his hand in a threatening gesture to drive off supernatural foes
such as the fearsome Crocodile of the South. The messengers of Sopdu were
dreaded by the living. The evil dead could expect to be butchered in the
Slaughter Yard of Sopdu.

SPHINX
The sphinx was a mythical beast with the body of a lion or lioness and the head
of a different creature. The most common combination was the body of a lion
and a human head with the face of a reigning king or queen. These sphinxes
embodied the power and duty of the ruler to defend Egypt. Other sphinxes had
the heads of rams, hawks, or even the Seth monster. These served as terrifying
animated guardians for temples or tombs.
Standing sphinxes were usually shown trampling the enemies of Egypt and
the divine order. Female sphinxes sometimes had wings, and it may be this
form that influenced the development of the female sphinx of Greek mythol
ogy. A double sphinx known as the Aker was the guardian of the two horizons,
the entrance and exit to the Duat, the Egyptian underworld. During the first
millennium BCE, a sphinx god called Tutu became popular. He was usually
shown as a standing sphinx with wings and a tail in the form of a snake. Tutu
was one of the monstrous offspring of the goddess Neith. He was invoked to
keep enemies at a safe distance.
The best known of all Egyptian sphinxes is the Great Sphinx of Giza. This
was carved out of an extremely faulty piece of an outcrop of rock during the
twenty-sixth century BCE to act as a gigantic guardian for the royal cemeteries
of Memphis. Both in ancient and modern times the Great Sphinx has generated
a mythology of its own. From the New Kingdom onward, it was identified with
a Caananite desert god called Hauron or Hwl and worshipped as a solar deity.
The two great pyramids built for Khufu and Khephren came to be thought of as
the mountains of the horizon with the sphinx as the sun rising between them.
A granite stela found between the front paws of the Great Sphinx describes
how a prince named Thutmose once visited Giza to hunt desert animals. In his
time (early fourteenth century BCE) the statue seems to have buried in the sand
up to its head. Looking for shade in the heat of the day, Thutmose lay down in
front of the statue and went to sleep. He dreamed that the Great Sphinx spoke
to him “as a father speaks to his son,” naming itself as Horemakhet (Horus of
the Horizon) Khepri-Ra-Atum. The god complained that he was “ailing in all

206



his limbs” because the sand had overwhelmed him. He promised that if the
prince would free him from the encroaching sand, Thutmose would enjoy a
long life and one day be king. When he awoke, Thutmose sent for numerous
workers.
The remainder of the inscription is badly damaged, but we know that the
helpful prince did become King Thutmose IV. Mud-brick walls that may have
been intended to keep sand away from the Great Sphinx bear his cartouches.
Thutmose’s inscription uses the traditional motif of the creator sun god (the
sphinx) under attack by the forces of chaos (the desert sands) and needing to be
helped to a rebirth.
To the Arab inhabitants of medieval Egypt, the Great Sphinx became
known as the Father of Terror. The statue was believed to guard hidden trea
sure, which it sometimes revealed to the deserving. According to one legend,
the Great Sphinx kept the sand from overwhelming Giza until a zealous holy
man destroyed its power by mutilating the statue’s face. In modern times, the
Great Sphinx has been seen as the guardian of the hidden wisdom of the lost
kingdom of Atlantis or as the symbol of an ancient galactic master race who
built a second sphinx on Mars.

STARS AND PLANETS
Individual stars and planets were considered to be celestial manifestations of
major deities, such as Horus, whereas the circumpolar stars were the glittering,
unchanging spirits of the vindicated dead. The Pyramid Texts contain many ref
erences to the dead king becoming a star. Some Egyptologists believe that this
“stellar afterlife” was older than the “solar afterlife,” in which the fate of the
king and humanity was tied up with the sun god. Others argue that the sun, the
moon, and the stars all formed part of a great celestial circuit in which the dead
took part in various ways.
In Pyramid Texts spell 245, the sky goddess Nut assigns the dead king a
place in heaven as the Lone Star (Venus?). The image of Nut as a naked woman
stretched above the earth has recently been interpreted as a representation of
the Milky Way rather than of the sky in general. Some Egyptian texts refer to
stars sailing on the sea below the belly of Nut. The belly or flanks of Nut in
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 207



cow form can be patterned with stars. The markings of the celestial cow some
times resemble those of a leopard. In the Predynastic Period the sky may have
been imagined as a giant panther or leopardess who devoured the stars each
morning. In the theology of the Pyramid Texts, the creator god could be thought
of as absorbing the power of the stars (all the other gods) each dawn to create
one celestial power, the sun. This process was reversed each evening when the
sun set and the one god became many again.
The Egyptians were aware that not all stars held a fixed place in the sky.
Observations of the procession of the equinoxes may have had a profound im
pact on the formative period for Egyptian myth. A few scholars even trace all
conflicts and fatalities among the gods to this origin. The Decan stars were
thought of as joining Osiris in the underworld before rising from the dead when
they became visible again above the horizon at dawn. Star clocks were painted
inside some Middle Kingdom coffins. Their main purpose was to incorporate
the spirit of the coffin owner into this stellar cycle of death and regeneration.
The most important of the Decan stars was Sirius. This star was repre
sented by a goddess known to the Egyptians as Sopdet and to the Greeks as
Sothis. She was shown as a woman wearing a crown surmounted by a five
pointed star. Each year the period when Sirius rose above the horizon at dawn
coincided with the coming of the inundation. This event also marked the start
of the Egyptian year. In the Pyramid Texts, Sopdet is named as a manifestation
of the goddess Isis. Later in Egyptian history, Sopdet was equated with the Eye
of Ra and the heliacal rising of her star was linked to the myth of the return of
the Distant Goddess.
Sopdet formed a triad with the star gods Sah and Sopdu-Hor. Sah is almost
certainly the great southern constellation known to the Greeks as Orion. The
Pyramid Texts describe Sah “of the long stride” as a stellar manifestation of
Osiris. As the Lone Star, Sopdu-Hor acted as the herald of the sun god morning
and evening. Various forms of Horus were equated with other planets such as
Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. It is possible that the planet Mercury was associated
with Seth.
The constellation we know as the Great Bear was interpreted by the
Egyptians as several deities guarding Seth’s bull form or its severed leg. This is
one of the few recognizable parts of the star maps that decorate the ceilings of
some royal tombs. The Babylonian concept of the stars of the zodiac was intro
duced into Egypt by the Greeks. Three Decan stars were assigned to each zodia
cal sign. Nut could be shown on coffins or temple ceilings surrounded by the
hours of the day and night and the twelve signs of the zodiac.

THOTH
Thoth was the god of wisdom and secret knowledge who invented writing and
the different languages of humanity. As a lunar deity, Thoth was the deputy of
the sun god, Ra. He mediated between the Two Fighters, Horus and Seth, and
returned the estranged Eye of Ra to her father. As the divine physician, Thoth
used his magical powers to heal the wounded Eye of Horus. Thoth could be
shown as a “beautiful” baboon or as an ibis or an ibis-headed man. Ra was said
to have created the baboon form of Thoth to shine in the night sky and the ibis
form to act as a messenger between earth and heaven.
Thoth was sometimes called the god “without a mother.” One text states
that Thoth came “from the lips of Ra” to uphold maat, the divine order. He was
also said to have sprung from the forehead of Seth after this god swallowed
some of the semen of his rival, Horus. At his main cult center of Hermopolis
Magna, Thoth, Lord of the Ogdoad, was worshipped as a self-creating deity who
produced the cosmic egg on the Island of Flame. As a moon god he was pictured
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 209



crossing the night sky in a boat, but Thoth could also be the navigator of the
boat of the sun god.
Thoth, the “excellent of understanding,” observed and wrote down every
thing that happened and reported it to Ra every morning. As the record keeper
of the gods he was paired with the librarian goddess Seshat. Thoth and Seshat
knew the future as well as the past. They inscribed a person’s fate on the bricks
on which their mother gave birth and the length of a king’s reign on the leaves
of the ished tree (see Figure 40).
Thoth set a divine example as a just judge and an incorruptible official. He
lifted Maat, the goddess of justice, to her father, Ra. Thoth was responsible for
framing and enforcing the laws of maat. In this role he could be either a gra
cious peacemaker or a merciless executioner. During the conflict between Seth
and Osiris, Thoth acted as the advocate of the murdered Osiris before the
Divine Tribunal. His spells and amulets prevented Seth from destroying the
mummy of Osiris in its eternal resting place. Thoth gave his protection to Isis
and healed her infant son, Horus, in the marshes of Chemmis.
The New Kingdom story, The Contendings of Horus and Seth, pictures
Thoth as the secretary of the Ennead of Heliopolis. He writes several letters on
behalf of the Ennead as they struggle to decide between Horus and Seth, and he
offers sensible advice to the sun god. When Isis literally loses her head at one
point in the conflict, it is Thoth who gives her a new one. In earlier sources it is
the damaged Eye of Horus that Thoth “makes new.” Thoth’s offering of the
whole eye (the wedjat) to Horus and Horus’s offering of it to Osiris became the
precedent for all offerings to gods and spirits.
From the Middle Kingdom onward, Thoth was shown as an ape or an ibis
headed man holding out the wedjat eye. In some cases this eye should be inter
preted as the Eye of Ra rather than the Eye of Horus. The Eye goddess who was
the estranged daughter of Ra was too powerful to be overcome by force. Ra
chose Thoth to fetch this Distant Goddess back from a remote desert. Disguised
as a baboon or monkey, Thoth accomplished his task through humility, cun
ning, and perseverance. According to one account he had to ask the goddess to
come home 1,077 times. Thoth was given Nehemtawy, a pacified version of the
Distant Goddess, as his consort.
Thoth played an important role in everyone’s afterlife. In the Pyramid Texts
the dead kings fly up to the heavens on the wings of Thoth. In the Middle
Kingdom Book of Two Ways, the Mansion of Thoth provides a safe haven for
spirits who can use his magic to get past the demons of the underworld. Some
of the royal Underworld Books of the New Kingdom name Thoth as presiding
over the mystical union of Ra and Osiris that allowed the dead to reawaken
each night. In the Book of the Dead, Thoth stands ready to record the verdict

210



when the heart of the deceased is weighed against the feather of maat (see
Figure 7). Those who feared failure asked Thoth to plead for them as he had
once pleaded for Osiris. All funerary spells could be regarded as works of Thoth.
A tradition grew up that Thoth had written forty-two books containing all the
knowledge needed by humanity. Some of this was occult knowledge to be re
vealed only to initiates who would not misuse the power it gave them. The
Greeks identified Thoth with their messenger god, Hermes. The body of litera
ture known as the Hermetica claimed to preserve the teachings of Hermes
Trismegistus (Thoth the Thrice Great). Hermes Trismegistus was eventually
reinterpreted as a great thinker who had lived thousands of years in the past.

TWO LADIES
The Two Ladies were Nekhbet (Nechbet), the vulture goddess of Upper Egypt
(the south), and Wadjyt (Wadjet, Ouadjet, Uto), the cobra goddess of Lower
Egypt (the north). From the Early Dynastic Period onward, the Two Ladies were
the chief divine protectors of the king. As vulture and cobra, or as twin cobras,
they were often featured on royal headdresses, jewelry, and furniture. Nekhbet
was identified with the White Crown of Upper Egypt and Wadjyt with the Red
(sometimes green) Crown of Lower Egypt.
Nekhbet’s name means “she of Nekheb,” an ancient town in the south of
Egypt now known as El-Kab. Wadjyt may mean “the green or fresh one” or “she
of the papyrus.” The first papyrus plant was said to have come from the body of
Wadjyt. Her chief cult area was the twin towns of Pe and Dep, home of leg
endary early kings of Egypt. These towns were later known as “the house of
Wadjyt,” a name rendered by the Greeks as Buto.
At his accession, each king was given the title He of the Two Ladies. In
coronation scenes, the goddesses were often shown in human form on either
side of the king. Wadjyt often appeared as the uraeus cobra on the king’s fore
head, and Nekhbet hovered above the king, shading and fanning him with her
wings. The male equivalent was the Two Lords, Horus and Seth, who could also
represent north and south. These two gods violently oppose each other in myth
but periodically come together to support the king or the creator sun god. These
Deities, Themes, and Concepts 211



moments of reconciliation could be symbolized in the form of a single deity
with two heads. The Two Ladies have similar forms in royal jewelry. This sug
gests that Nekhbet and Wadjyt might once have been thought of as warring op
posites, but no specific myths relating to their conflict survive.
Both goddesses were represented by dangerous creatures who needed to be
appeased. Nekhbet took the form of the largest flying bird known to the
Egyptians. There was a general fear of vultures devouring or dispersing bodies
buried in the desert. Nekhbet could also appear as another dangerous animal,
the long-horned wild cow of the marshlands. She was one of a group of cow
deities who wet-nursed and protected the divine child in the marshes of
Chemmis and the newly reborn king in the afterlife. This eventually led the
Greeks to identify Nekhbet with their goddess of childbirth, Eileithyia. Statue
groups show either a cow or a cobra in a papyrus thicket protecting the king as
divine child.
As well as appearing as a cobra, Wadjyt could be shown as a woman with
the head of a lioness. She was one of the goddesses identified with the destruc

could be associated with the light of the moon.

WEPWAWET (UPWAUT)
Wepwawet was a jackal god whose name means the Opener of the Ways. He
was most commonly shown as a standing jackal on a standard. Standards of this
type were carried before the king on ceremonial occasions and into battle.
Wepwawet’s animal form was later reinterpreted as a wolf, and his cult center
at modern Assiut was named Lykopolis (Wolf-Town) by the Greeks.
Wepwawet may originally have been a title of the archaic jackal god Sed.
The Heb Sed, the great festival at which the king of Egypt renewed his strength
and power, was named after this deity. Egyptian kings were identified with
Wepwawet, “the swift-roving jackal,” when they defended their borders, so dur
ing the Heb Sed the king had to run a race to prove his fitness to rule. There
was one protective Wepwawet for Upper Egypt and one for Lower Egypt.
In death, the king might become a god by assuming the jackal-face of
Wepwawet. Spells in the Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts record Wepwawet
helping the dead ascend to the heavens and opening “a good path” for them
through the dangerous landscapes of the afterlife. At Abydos, he performed this
service for the murdered god Osiris. There he was identified with Horus or
Anubis, the loyal sons of Osiris who helped him to rise from his inert state to
become the king of the underworld. Wepwawet also sniffed out and punished
the enemies of Osiris.
Wepwawet’s role as a kind of celestial guide dog made him a popular deity
with ordinary people who faced dangerous journeys in life or death. Like
Anubis, Wepwawet was Lord of the Sacred Land. This meant that he was a su
pernatural guardian of the desert cemeteries. In the Book of the Dead,
Wepwawet is one of the council of seven gods who guard the twenty-first and fi

Hieroglyphs. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000.
A good place to start for anyone who would like to try reading some
Ancient Egyptian texts in their original language and script. The lessons
on Middle Egyptian grammar are interleaved with essays on the geography,
history, and culture of Ancient Egypt. Several of these essays discuss cre
ation myths.
John Baines and Jaromir Malek. Atlas of Ancient Egypt. Rev. ed. New York: Checkmate
Books, 2000.

with a superb range of maps. The “Gazetteer of Archaeological Sites” in
cludes concise information on all the major temples and royal tombs.

Erik Hornung. Idea into Image: Essays on Ancient Egyptian Thought. Translated by
Elizabeth Bredeck. Princeton, NJ: Timken, 1992.

Antonio Loprieno (ed.). Ancient Egyptian Literature: History and Forms. Leiden and
New York: E. J. Brill, 1996.
Essays on all periods and genres of Ancient Egyptian literature. Most are in
English and suitable for readers with little prior knowledge of Ancient
Egypt. In the chapter “Myth and Literature,” John Baines concludes that
although myth was not dominant in Egyptian “high culture,” it was im
portant in literature for over 2,000 years.
Gay Robins. The Art of Ancient Egypt. London: British Museum Press, 1997.
A well-illustrated introduction to Egyptian art that takes a chronological
approach. Mythological themes found in the art are traced over long peri
ods of time. This book is unusual in doing full justice to the last thousand
years of Pharaonic culture.
Jack M. Sasson (ed. in chief). Civilizations of the Ancient Near East. 4 vols. New York:
Scribners, 1995.
These volumes cover the history and culture of all the major civilizations
of the Ancient Near East. There is a chapter titled “Myth and
Mythmaking” for each culture. The one for Egypt, by Jacobus van Dijk, is
a model of clarity. Also of interest are the chapters “Ancient Egyptian
Religious Iconography,” by Erik Hornung; “Tales of Magic and Wonder
from Ancient Egypt,” by Susan Tower Hollis; and “Death and the Afterlife
in Ancient Egyptian Thought,” by Leonard H. Lesko.
Ian Shaw and Paul Nicholson. British Museum Dictionary of Ancient Egypt. London:
British Museum Press, 1995.
A reliable source of information on all aspects of Ancient Egypt. There are
numerous entries on Egyptian deities, each with a short bibliography.
David P. Silverman (ed.). Ancient Egypt. London: Piatkus, 1997.
A beautifully illustrated book written by an international team of
Egyptologists. It is divided into three main sections: The Egyptian World;
Belief and Ritual; and Art, Architecture, and Language. Three chapters
“The Boundaries of Knowledge,” “The Celestial Realm,” and “The Life of
Ritual”—are outstanding.

Egyptian Religion and Myth
Many more specialized works are cited in the endnotes to “Introduction” and
“Mythical Time Lines” and in the suggestions for further reading in “Deities,
Themes, and Concepts.”
James P. Allen. Genesis in Egypt: The Philosophy of Ancient Egyptian Creation Accounts.
2d ed. Yale Egyptological Studies 2. San Antonio, TX: Van Siclen Books, 1995.
This short book is essential reading for anyone interested in ancient cre
ation myths and cosmologies. It examines the elements of the Egyptian
universe, the process and means of creation, and the nature of the creator.
Annotated translations are given of sixteen key texts.
Rudolph Anthes. “Mythology in Ancient Egypt.” In Mythologies of the Ancient World,
edited by Samuel Noel Kramer. Garden City, NY: Doubleday, 1961, 15–92.
A summary of the main sources for Egyptian myth. There are detailed dis
cussions of a selection of myths, such as those relating to the lunar Eye of
Horus. Anthes stresses that “continuous change of mythological concep
tions” took place.
Jan Assmann. Egyptian Solar Religion in the New Kingdom: Re, Amun, and the Crisis
of Polytheism. Translated by Anthony Alcock. London and New York: Kegan Paul
International, 1995.
Assmann is an influential and controversial Egyptologist. In this book he
analyzes the iconography of the daily journey of the sun god and discusses
the development of the idea of a unique creator deity within the polytheis
tic religion of Ancient Egypt. It is not aimed at beginners.
John Baines. “Egyptian Myth and Discourse: Myth, Gods, and the Early Written And
Iconographic Record.” Journal of Near Eastern Studies 50, no. 2 (1991): 81–105.
This important article discusses the status of myth in Egyptian texts. It in
cludes a valuable summary of the ideas of the leading German-language
writers on Egyptian myth.
R. T. Rundle Clarke. Myth and Symbol in Ancient Egypt. London: Thames and
Hudson, 1959.
This book is primarily about developments in the mythology of Osiris
from the Old Kingdom through to the end of the New Kingdom. There are
summaries of some other important myths and a useful chart of religious
symbols.
Egyptian Myth: Annotated Print and Nonprint Resources 217



H. Frankfort. Ancient Egyptian Religion. New York: Columbia University Press, 1948.
A short book that is still worth reading. In the section “Change and
Permanence in Literature and Art,” Frankfort argues that the “coherent
myths preserved in writing” belong “to the repertoire of popular story
tellers.”
George Hart. A Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses. London and Boston:
Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1986.
The best available A–Z of Ancient Egyptian deities. The 134 entries cover
all the main gods and goddesses, many of the obscure denizens of the un
derworld, and some foreign deities who were worshipped in Egypt. Hart is
particularly good at explaining complex deities, such as Horus. Most en
tries are illustrated with line drawings.
Erik Hornung. Conceptions of God in Ancient Egypt: The One and the Many.
Translated by John Baines. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1982.
One of the most profound books ever written on Egyptian religion.
Hornung uses a wealth of primary sources, including myths, to illuminate
the nature of Egypt’s deities and their relationship with humanity. The last
part of the book focuses on the controversial issue of whether the
Egyptians ever developed a form of monotheism.
Erik Hornung. The Ancient Egyptian Books of the Afterlife. Translated by David Lorton.
Ithaca, NY, and London: Cornell University Press, 1999.
This study is the ideal place to start for anyone who wishes to explore the
funerary literature of Ancient Egypt. Hornung summarizes the contents of
eighteen funerary collections or books and places them in their historical
context. Many of the illustrations that can form a vital part of these works
are shown and discussed. There is a very comprehensive bibliography for
each chapter.
Barbara S. Lesko. The Great Goddesses of Egypt. Norman: University of Oklahoma
Press, 1999.
The author starts with an introduction: “Early Women and the First
Evidence of Faith.” She goes on to describe the cults of Nut, Neith,
Nekhbet and Wadjet, Hathor, Mut, and Isis. Unlike much that is published
about Egyptian goddesses, these are reliable accounts closely based on pri
mary sources.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology

Manfred Lurker. The Gods and Symbols of Ancient Egypt. Translated by Barbara
Cumming and revised by Peter Clayton. London: Thames and Hudson, 1980.
This book covers the symbolic meanings of the animals, plants, and ob
jects that appear in Egyptian art as well as the significance of divine fig
ures. The entries are illustrated with black and white photographs or line
drawings. The book ends with a useful chronological table, which lists the
main cultural and religious developments in each period.
Dimitri Meeks and Christine Favard-Meeks. Daily Life of the Egyptian Gods. Translated
by G. M. Goshgarian. London: John Murray, 1997.
The authors have been criticized by many scholars for choosing to treat
the Egyptian pantheon as if they were a “community that has caught the
interest of anthropologists.” The book does contain a mass of unusual in
formation and draws extensively on mythological texts preserved in tem
ples of the Greco-Roman Period.
Stephen Quirke. Ancient Egyptian Religion. London: British Museum Press, 1992.
Quirke argues that Ancient Egyptian religion had two main functions: to
answer personal dilemmas about the nature of the world and to bind the
community together. The long chapters “Power in Heaven” and “Power
on Earth” deal with the mythology of Ra, Osiris, and Horus.
Byron E. Shafer (ed.). Religion in Ancient Egypt. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press;
London: Routledge, 1991.
This useful book consists of three long essays: “Divinity and Deities in
Ancient Egypt,” by David P. Silverman; “Ancient Egyptian Cosmogonies
and Cosmology,” by Leonard H. Lesko; and “Society, Morality, and
Religious Practice,” by John Baines. The section by Lesko looks at some of
the lesser-known creation myths, such as the Khonsu Cosmogony from
Thebes.
Vincent Arieh Tobin. “Mytho-Theology in Ancient Egypt.” Journal of the American
Research Center in Egypt [JARCE] 25 (1988): 169–184; and “Divine Conflict in the
Pyramid Texts.” JARCE 30 (1993): 93–110.
Two articles that examine the process of myth making in Egypt and the
links among myth, ritual, theology, and politics.
Egyptian Myth: Annotated Print and Nonprint Resources 219



Pascal Vernus. The Gods of Ancient Egypt. Translated by Jane Marie Todd. London and
New York: Tauris Park Books, 1998.
This book has magnificent color photographs by Erich Lessing, but the
text is of equal importance. The subjects covered include the organization
of the Egyptian pantheon and the ways in which individuals related to
their gods. Vernus writes particularly well about animal forms of deities.
Books and Articles on Egyptian Myth in Other Languages
More has been written about Egyptian myth in German than in any other lan
guage. Important or interesting works include Siegfried Schott’s Mythe und
Mythenbildung im alten Ägypten (Leipzig: J. C. Hinricks, 1945); Emma
Brunner-Traut’s article on myth in Lexikon der Ägyptologie, edited by W. Helck
et al., vol. 4 (Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz, 1982), 277–286, and her
Gelebte Mythen: Beiträge zum altägyptischen Mythos (Darmstadt: Wissen
schaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1981); Jan Assmann’s “Die Verborgenheit des
Mythos in Ägypten” (in Göttingen Miszellan 25 [1977]: 7–43); and Heike
Sternberg’s Mythische Motive und Mythenbildung in den ägyptischen Tempeln
und Papyri der griechisch-römischen Zeit (Wiesbaden, Germany: Harrassowitz,
1985). In French, Susanne Bickel’s La cosmogonie égyptienne avant le Nouvel
Empire (Orbis Biblicus et Orientalis 134; Freiburg and Göttingen, 1994) summa
rizes, analyzes, and interprets a range of creation myths; and Isabelle Franco’s
Mythes et Dieux: Le Souffle de Soleil (Paris: Pygmalion, 1996) is a very readable
general survey of Egyptian mythology.
English Translations of Ancient Texts
This is a selection of major sources for Egyptian myth. Many more will be found in
“Appendix: Primary Sources.”
Thomas George Allen. The Book of the Dead or the Book of Going Forth by Day.
Studies in Ancient Oriental Civilizations 37. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1974.
Probably the best English translation of the 174 spells generally agreed to
make up the Egyptian Book of the Dead. Allen does not include the
vignettes for the spells, and the notes are intended for scholars. The
vignettes can be found in reprints of E. A. Wallis Budge’s edition of the
Book of the Dead, but his translation should not be relied on.
Handbook of Egyptian Mythology

J. F. Borghouts. Ancient Egyptian Magical Texts. NISABA vol. 9 Leiden: E. J. Brill,
1978.
Translations of 146 spells from a variety of sources, ranging in date from
the Middle Kingdom to the Late Period. This anthology concentrates on
spells that were probably used in daily life. Many of these spells incorpo
rate short myths. There are outstandingly helpful notes and indexes.
R. O. Faulkner. The Ancient Egyptian Coffin Texts. Vols.1–3. Warminster, England: Aris
and Phillips, 1973–1978.
Literal translations of 1,185 Coffin Texts, including the Book of Two Ways.
The notes are mainly concerned with grammar and give the reader little
help to understand these difficult texts. There are very comprehensive in
dexes at the end of Volume 3.
R. O. Faulkner. The Ancient Egyptian Pyramid Texts. Warminster, England: Aris and
Phillips; Oak Park, IL: Bolchazy Carducci, n.d.
Literal translations of 759 Pyramid Texts; the oldest of the major sources
for Egyptian myth. The extensive notes are intended for Egyptologists
rather than the general reader. The index of the deities mentioned in the
Pyramid Texts is arranged in the traditional order of the Ancient Egyptian
“alphabet.” More Pyramid Texts have been discovered since this transla
tion was first published in 1969.
John L. Foster. Hymns, Prayers, and Songs: An Anthology of Ancient Egyptian Lyric
Poetry. Edited by Susan Tower Hollis. Atlanta, GA: Scholar’s Press, 1995.
Nine of the thirteen sections in this anthology concentrate on religious
poetry. The book includes selections from the Pyramid Texts and the Book
of the Dead but is most useful for the translations of a wide range of
hymns to Amun and Ra. Each section has a brief introduction, and there is
a helpful glossary.
Miriam Lichtheim. Ancient Egyptian Literature. 3 vols. Berkeley, Los Angeles, London:
University of California Press, 1973–1980.
These ground-breaking anthologies have introduced thousands of readers
to Egyptian literature. They translate works ranging in date from the
twenty-fourth century BCE to the first century CE. The translations include
important sources for myth such as the Memphite Theology (misdated to
the Old Kingdom), the Contendings of Horus and Seth, and the Setna
Cycle.
Egyptian Myth: Annotated Print and Nonprint Resources 221



R. B. Parkinson. The Tale of Sinuhe and Other Ancient Egyptian Poems: 1940–1640
BC. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1997.
The best available translations of Middle Kingdom literature. The anthol
ogy includes two magical tales and several dialogues and teachings that al
lude to myths. Lively introductions and detailed notes to each translation
make the book ideal for the general reader.
A. Piankoff. The Tomb of Ramesses VI. 2 vols. Edited by N. Rambova. Bollingen Series
40/1. New York: Pantheon Books for the Bolingen Foundation, 1954.
This magnificently produced book includes translations and interpreta
tions of the numerous Underworld Books that decorate the walls of this
royal tomb. The complex pictures that are an integral part of these works
are illustrated in the plates volume.
Plutarch. De Iside Et Osiride. Translated and with an introduction and commentary by
J. Gwyn Griffiths. Swansea: University of Wales Press, 1970.
After 2,000 years, this is still one of the most interesting books on mythol
ogy ever written. Plutarch recorded many mythical narratives while ex
ploring the true nature of Isis, Osiris, and Typhon (Seth). He believed that
the study of mythology was important because “the longing for truth, par
ticularly for truth about the gods, is a yearning after divinity.”
A Selection of Literature Influenced by Egyptian Myth
Lucius Apuleius. The Golden Ass. Translated by Robert Graves. 1950.
The Golden Ass, also known as Metamorphoses, was written in the sec
ond century CE and is the only complete Latin novel to have survived. It is
the entertaining story of a sorcerer’s apprentice who is turned into a don
key by a witch. After many scandalous adventures, the repentant hero is
rescued from his enchantment by the goddess Isis and becomes a priest of
Osiris.
William Golding. The Scorpion God. 1971.
A novella that begins with a vivid recreation of the sed festival at which
an Egyptian king tries to renew his right to rule. Golding examines the
mythologies of power and the impact of doubt on a fixed world view.

Christian Jacq. Ramses under the Western Acacia. Translated by Dorothy S. Blair.
1998.
The last in a series of five historical novels about Rameses II by a French
Egyptologist. All the novels feature the interplay between myth and ritual
in Egyptian religion. There is a glossary of the deities that are mentioned.
Norman Mailer. Ancient Evenings. 1983.
A violent and erotic novel, which includes some retellings of Egyptian
myth. Much of the novel is set in the reign of the charismatic Rameses II,
but the hero is reincarnated three times during the story, so there are col
orful descriptions of the Egyptian afterlife.
Elizabeth Peters. The Snake, the Crocodile, and the Dog. 1992.
One of a series of comic mystery novels about pioneering Egyptologist
Radcliffe Emerson and his formidable wife, Amelia Peabody. Several books
in the series use an Egyptian myth or legend as the basis for the plot. This
one is based on the Tale of the Doomed Prince. A painless way to learn
about the history of Egyptian archaeology.
Tim Powers. The Anubis Gates. 1983.
An ingenious fantasy novel, partly set in Egypt. The time-traveling hero
has to cope with Romantic poets as well as Egyptian magicians and
deities.
Saxe Rohmer. Tales of Secret Egypt. 1918.
Although Rohmer is best known for his Fu Manchu stories, Egypt was his
real passion. He published several collections of well-researched short sto
ries in which tomb robbers and Egyptologists encounter ancient magic and
dangerous deities.
Charles Williams. The Greater Trumps. 1932.
A “theological thriller” that draws on the belief that the Tarot pack was
based on esoteric knowledge from Ancient Egypt. Isis appears in an un
usual guise at the climax of the story.
