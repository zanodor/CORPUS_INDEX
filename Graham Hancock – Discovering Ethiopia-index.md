Chapter 1 • Land and People
Ethiopia is situated between 4° and 18° north in eastern Africa. It is a ruggedly mountainous country enjoying a generally temperate climate throughout the year. Bordered by the Sudan, Kenya, Somalia and Djibouti, it has a coastline on the Red Sea 800 kilometres long. The tenth largest country in Africa, Ethiopia has an area of 1,235,000 square kilometres. It is twice the size of Kenya, of France or of Texas. With a population of 32 million people, the average number of inhabitants per square kilometre is only 25.9. However, the population density in the fertile central highlands is three times that figure. At present only 10.4 per cent of the country is under any form of cultivation, although 68.8 per cent of the land area is deemed to be arable. Ethiopia is made up of 1 5 administrative regions. These are Arssi, Assab, Bale, Eritrea, GamoGofa, Gojjam, Gondar, Harerghe, lllubabor, Kaffa, Shoa, Sidamo, Tigray, Wollega and Wollo.
GEOGRAPHY
The central area of Ethiopia is a vast highland region of faulted volcanic rocks thrown up during the Tertiary Period of geological time over 20 million years ago when the great Rift Valley started to open. This huge and dramatic scar on the face of the earth in fact extends from Lebanon through the Red Sea, down the Danakil Depression and onwards to form the valleys of Ethiopia and Kenya, before terminating finally in Tanzania and Mozambique. The Ethiopian highlands alone cover an area roughly the size of France, and form a well-watered, temperate world of their own at between 1 ,500 and 4,700 metres surrounded by burning, inhospitable, lowland deserts which only the most determined can cross with any semblance of success. The highland escarpment, inhabited by the bulk of the Ethiopian population, is steep in the north, and has been denuded of soil by the silt
carried away each year by the Blue Nile — the soil upon which Egypt's
agriculture has prospered. The Simien Mountains — the roof of Africa
— rise to over 4,000 metres, and the highest point is Ras Deshen (4,620 metres). The Danakil basin, lying between the highlands and the Red Sea,

§17§
in the Rift Valley, situated in warm lowland areas, generally below 1 ,600 metres. Fishing, boating, and bird-watching make these beautiful stretches of water attractive to tourists. Lake Tana, in the Gondar region (not part of the Rift Valley), is Ethiopia's largest lake, with an area of 3,600 square kilometres. Lake Abaya, 1,160 kilometres, is the second largest. Others include Lake Chamo (551 square kilometres), Lake Ziway (434 square kilometres) and Lake Shala (409 square kilometres). Lake Shala reaches a depth of 250 metres. The depths of other lakes vary from four to 85 metres.
CLIMATE
Weather conditions in Ethiopia are determined by the physical nature of the country and by its situation close to the Indian Ocean. Throughout the year it is warm and pleasant in the low-lying areas and cool and bracing in the central highlands. There are two principal seasons: rainy from J une through October; relatively dry for the rest of the year. Meteorological conditions vary according to the altitude. In some areas in the central highlands, there is a month-long season of 'little rains' early in the year. The average temperature during the hottest season is 18C, falling to 14C in the rainy season. The average annual temperature in
Massawa — the hottest city in Ethiopia — is 30C. The highest recorded temperature in Massawa was 45C. The amount of rainfall varies from place to place. However, in most parts of the central highlands the annual average is well over 1,000mm. The mean amount of rainfall over three years was 1 ,1 53mm in Addis Ababa, 477 in Asmara, 53 in Assab, 1,234 in Dessie, 640 in Dire Dawa, 1,241 in Gambela, 1 ,245 in Gondar, 896 in Harar, 1 ,509 in j imma, 1 84 in Massawa and 671 in Neghellie. The wettest months for the central highlands are J uly and August, while November and December have the coldest nights. During the nights of the coldest months the temperature often drops to around freezing point. Humidity varies between 50 per cent and 80 per cent throughout the year. The Ethiopian climate is generally Mediterranean in character.

§20§.
PEOPLE AND LANGUAGES
It is not without reason that the great historian, Conti-Rossini, characterised Ethiopia as a rich cultural mosaic. There are over 80 languages and dialects in Ethiopia and as many cultural variations. In the Eritrean coastal areas and in the northernmost highlands are to be found speakers of Tigre, a Semitic language closely I inked to the ancient Ge'ez now surviving only in church liturgy and literature. In the Tigray region, where Axum is found, another Semitic language, Tigrinya, is spoken. The heartland of Ethiopia is the homeland of Amharic, the official language, also derived from Ge'ez. Further south, Guraginya, a Semitic language, is spoken by a numerically small ethnic group of Hamitic origin. To the east and south are the Cushitic-speaking peoples: the Oromos, the Afars and the Somalis. The linked Sidama group of languages are spoken in the south-east. Although the various Oromo clans have remained
socially distinct, their common culture is a fascinating feature of their lives. This kind of unity in diversity is one of the special characteristics of Ethiopia today. To the far west and south-west, Ethiopia's Nilotic peoples are found: the Nuer and the Anuak living near Gambela, and other scattered groups further south. Each has its own distinctive language and culture. Also found in Ethiopia are a number of small communities whose languages and cultures are connected to specific aspects of the country's long history. One such group is the Falasha, now living in the Gondar region, whose culture reflects Ethiopia's early links with Judaic Palestine. Ethiopians are generally considered to be a courteous and hospitable people. They were known to Homer as the "blameless race" with whom the gods dined. Ethiopians are proud and patriotic. Fine soldiers, they have been known for their bravery and achievements since ancient times.



§21 §
RELIGIONS
Ethiopian culture and tradition have been much influenced by both Christian and Moslem religions. The Amharas and Tigres are predominantly Christian and adhere to the Orthodox Church. The Oromos, the largest ethnic group in the country (who appeared in central Ethiopia in the 1 6th century), are more mixed, with Christian, Moslem and pagan communities.
LIFESTYLES
In their political structures, the different peoples of Ethiopia have evolved their own distinct but equally fascinating solutions to the age-old problems of individual freedom and social control. The Borena in the south, along the border with Kenya, used to run an almost perfect form of 'presidential' government. Every eight years an Aba Gada (father of the Gada, or the age-group system) was elected who would administer the tribe by travelling round Borena territory according to a set route and routine throughout his entire term of office, spending a month at each stop. Like all the 80 nationalities of the country, the Adares, the Afars and the Ethiopian Somalis of Harerghe have their own distinct ways of life. I n the hotter lowlands that these people inhabit, the donkey and the mule give way to the camel as the principal beast of burden, and Islam is the predominant religion. Ethiopia is first in Africa in her livestock population. Nearly 90 per cent of all Ethiopians are engaged in farming and cattle-raising and live in the countryside. Be they Beni Amer or the Kunama of the Eritrean region, the Afar or the ethnic Somali of the Danakil and theOgaden, the Anuak of the southwest, or the Borena along the border with Kenya, the peripheral inhabitants

§24§
of Ethiopia lead a nomadic and pastoral way of life. The central highlands, by contrast have supported farming communities for thousands of years, and the Christian highland peoples have followed a biblical, moral and civic code of behaviour for over 16 centuries. Despite the predominance of Christianity in these regions, small islands of Islamic settlement are also found. Farmers in the Ethiopian highlands grow cereals, pulses and oilseeds. Their staple food, injera, is made from teff (Eragrostis Abyssinica), which is a tiny grain related to millet and indigenous to Ethiopia.
The Konso, who inhabit mountainous terrain in Gamo Gof a province, have practised the technique of terraced agriculture for over 400 years. The result is an amazingly picturesque landscape with thegreen intricacy of terraces merging into the contours of the hillsides. The Guraghe have evolved a virtually famine-proof way of life based on cultivation of the versatile ensete plant (false banana), which they use for purposes ranging from food to the construction of large, spacious houses. The Dorze are famous for their craftsmanship in weaving and for their fascinating funeral rituals. The gentle folk of Gambela lead a truly pastoral existence with seasonal sorghum planting and fishing carried out along the Baro river. This relatively large river plays a central role in the life of the Nuer and the Anuak in
much the same way as the Omo affects the lives of the Mursi, the Karo and the Galeb.

COSTUMES
The costumes of the Ethiopian people are as varied and interesting as the population itself, reflecting ancient and modern trends in decoration; the fanciful as well as the practical. A love of ornamentation ruled by a natural affinity for beauty leads Ethiopians to adorn themselves in often memorably dramatic fashions. Timeless symbols such as the cross and lion's mane have long been used in decoration. Tattooing of the forehead, cheeks, neck, and hands, and elaborate traditional coiffure, though no longer the rule with sophisticated city dwellers, are still seen everywhere among the rural folk. A profusion of jewellery is an integral part of national dress, whether crafted by skilled gold- and silversmiths, or by village artisans working with cowrie shells, base metals and colourful beads. And rain or shine, richly ornamented umbrellas, gorgeous in colour, are held above the heads of priests and deacons during church services. In their dress, as in other areas of cultural and religious tradition, the Ethiopians participate in a heritage that is lively, colourful and unique. One delight awaiting the visitor is the ever-changing pageant of costumes that will pass before him as he walks through the cities or drives about the countryside, as he witnesses a religious ceremony or takes part in public celebrations. Generally speaking, the basic costume of highland Ethiopia is the shamma, a loose flowing garment often worn in addition to shirts, skirts and trousers. In the streets of Addis Ababa the traveller will see the shamma in all its permutations. Other common items of apparel include the netela (single-sheet), a light cotton shawl; the kutta, a heavier version of the netela; the gabi, a coarse blanket-like cotton cloth worn for warmth; and the burnous, or black cloak. The kemis is a full-length embroidered dress with an embroidered hemline, worn by women. In the hot lowlands Ethiopians often wear little or nothing above the waist. They wear a leather skirt or a shirit, a piece of cotton cloth wound around the waist and coming down the calf.

FESTIVALS
The bright blue sky and the bracing highland air supplant the gloom of the season of thunder and lightning. The torrential rains, the hail storms and muddy floods subside and the ground firms up, coming alive again with greenery, the spectacle of flowers, and with ripe crops filling the air with sweet effervescence. This is Tseday, the Ethiopian season of spring, and a very delightful time to see the countryside. Maskaram First (11 September) is New Year's Day, the harbinger of the harvest season, merry
making and marriage. Nowadays, New Year's Day celebrations are heightened by Revolution Day observed the following morning. But perhaps the most unusual of Ethiopia's many festivals are those of Kulubi Gabriel, Gishen Mariam, Sheikh Hussein and Sof Omar. Vast crowds turn up each year to pray for a cure, a baby, some special grace, or to give thanks for prayers already fulfilled. St. Mary's Churches at Axum and Lalibela have their own big annual religious festivals taking place in January and during Ethiopian Christmas respectively. The second important festival is Maskal, on 27 September, when Ethiopians commemorate the finding of the True Cross by St. Helena, the wife of Constantine the Great. Huge bonfires are lit all over the country on the eve of Maskal and dancing and feasting take place on the day itself. Maskal also marks the end of the big rains and the advent of the season of flowers. On 19 January there is the Feast of Epiphany, or Timket, probably
Ethiopia's most celebrated festival — and certainly the easiest and the most convenient for outsiders to see and enjoy. On the eve of Timket, the holy Tabot (Ark of Covenant) of each church is brought to some central watering place where the following morning bishops, elders, and the clergy assemble in all their gorgeous costumes for all Christians of the neighbourhood to renew their vows and be sprinkled with holy water, after which the Tabots are borne in procession back to their various churches accompanied by their respective congregations. Easter is the most solemn of the festivals. Its celebration is accompanied by the unique and sacred music and dance of the Church and by the most moving rituals during midnight Mass.



Overleaf: The 12th century city of §^9§ Lalibela, with its remarkable rockhewn churches, is one of the best places in which to participate in the dramatic Timket festival.
CALENDAR
Ethiopia still retains the Julian calendar, named after Julius Caesar, for
whom it was devised by Alexandrian astronomers. The year is divided into 12 months of 30 days each and a 13th month of five or six days (hence the tourism promotion slogan "13 months of sunshine"). Taking for its
starting point the Birth of Christ — and owing to differences of opinion
over the date of the Creation — the Ethiopian calendar is seven years and eight months behind the Gregorian calendar. Ethiopian Christmas Day is on 7 January of the Gregorian calendar, while Ethiopian Easter coincides with Gregorian Easter once every four years.

Chapter 2 • History
Ethiopia may well be the true 'Cradle of Mankind'; since the fossilised remains of man's oldest known ancestor, Australopithecus Afarensis, have been found here. Dating back at least 3.5 million years, the original find
— nicknamed 'Lucy' — was made in 1974 at a site on the lower Awash river in north-east Ethiopia, and has since been supplemented by many
other discoveries in the Omo river valley and elsewhere on the Awash. 'Lucy' was an upright-walking hominid, a metre tall, with a small brain and apelike features. Her teeth, as well as her legs and pelvic bones are, however, distinctly human. Her discovery rocked the world of paleoanthropology because it proved that mankind's ancestors were at least a million years older than had hitherto been believed.
LEGEND AND ANCIENT HISTORY
Early tradition has it that Cush, one of the sons of Ham and a grandson of Noah, came to Ethiopia from Mesopotamia. Latter-day legend claims that Menilek I, the son born to Solomon by the Queen of Sheba, settled in Axum bringing with him the Ark of the Covenant from the Temple in
Jerusalem to establish the dynasty which reigned — with only brief
interruptions — untiM974. Ethiopia had, infact, one of the world's longest uninterrupted monarchical lines. Ethiopia's historical importance stemmed, in part, from her favourable location and terrain. The cool, celestial 'island' of ancient times was not only part of Africa but also lay on the edge of the Graeco-Roman world to which it was linked both by the Nile river system and the Red Sea. Ties of kinship, proximity, culture and trade also provided connections with the Indo-Persian-Arab races. Lying at the centre of these three cultural worlds and protected on the east by her inhospitable deserts, Ethiopia
was influenced — but never quite dominated — by any of them.
By the first century AD Axum was the capital of a sizeable empire controlling the northern highlands and in constant touch with Egypt and Greece through her main port of Adulis (now lying buried some 40 kilometres south of the present-day port of Massawa).



§32§
Early in the 4th century a Syrian boy and his brother were taken to Axum after being stranded in Adulis. The boy, Frumentius, grew up in Axum and succeeded in converting the ruler of the time, King Ezana, to Christianity. When Frumentius went to Alexandria to inform the Patriarch that a bishop was required in Axum, the latter consecrated Frumentius as the bishop. The early coins of Ezana's reign bear the crescent and the sun's disc
— representing the moon and the sun that Axumites traditionally
worshipped — while later coins bear the cross, the symbol of his new faith. Under King Kaleb (514-542 AD) much of the Arabian peninsula came under Christian rule and was subject to Axum. The Roman Emperor Justinian secured Kaleb's help in promoting trade in silk and spices from India to Europe through the Red Sea. By this time Ge'ez had replaced Sabaean as the court language of Axum. The rise of Islam in the seventh century however, drove the Axumites back across the Red Sea into their natural highland strongholds. By the eighth century Ethiopia was isolated from the outside world to such an
extent that — as Gibbon put it so poetically — the Ethiopians, "encompassed on all sides by the enemies of their religion, slept near a
thousand years, forgetful of the world by whom they were forgotten/'

THE MIDDLE AGES
But on the highlands of Ethiopia those years were not wholly uneventful. With all foreign commercial and cultural contacts cut off, the country, still under central control from Axum, gradually extended her sphere of political and cultural influence southwards. Late in the 10th century the King of Axum was overthrown by the pagan Queen J udith (known as 'the monstrous one7
) who had his sons murdered. For nearly three hundred years thereafter Ethiopia was ruled by the new Zagwe dynasty established in their capital at Roha (now known as Lalibela) in Lasta. The year 1 270 witnessed the restoration of the Solomonic dynasty when Yekuno Amlak, who claimed descent from an Axumite prince who had fled south to escape Judith's wrath, ascended the throne. During the subsequent era the country was ruled by Rases (warlords) and Shums (chiefs) who would themselves submit to the king of their respective province or region and, through him, to the King of Kings {Neguse Negest). Thus, the extensive domains, kingdoms and provinces of Ethiopia were ceaselessly subjected to mutually feuding temporal pressures and personalities. In 1531 General Ahmed Ibn Ibrahim, nicknamed Gragn ('the lefthanded'), entered the Ethiopian highlands at the head of a Moslem army that he had raised from Harar. Emperor Lebna Dengel (1508-1540) fled to Lake Tana and appealed to Portugal for military assistance. It was fol lowing this appeal that Christopher da Gama, son of the famous explorer Vasco da Gama, arrived at Massawa with 400 men. He was killed, but his men joined the new Emperor Claudius and slew General Ahmed Ibn Ibrahim near Lake Tana. Subsequently, in 1557, the Pope sent a Jesuit mission to Ethiopia in an attempt to convert the country to Roman Catholicism. The Jesuits made little headway and were eventually banished from Ethiopia in the middle of the 17th century.









§36§
MODERN HISTORY
In the 1840s both France and Britain entered into treaties with KingSahle Sellassie of Shoa. But it was with the accession to power of King Menilek II that Ethiopia was thrown into the maelstrom of modern politics during Europe's 'scramble for Africa'. By a fraudulent misrepresentation of an article in the Treaty of Wuchale which Italy had concluded with Menilek, Italy laid claim to Ethiopia as her protectorate. Britain and France supported Italy's claims and the three proceeded to attempt to divide up eastern Africa into respective spheres of influence. This attempt failed in Ethiopia, however. At the decisive Battle of Adwa on 1 March 1896, Ethiopia scored a resounding victory over Italian colonial forces, thereby succeeding in asserting her age-old freedom and independence. Ethiopia's independence was subsequently recognised not only by the defeated Italians but also by the other Great Powers of the time. Within the country a dynamic spirit of unity was fostered. Menilek founded Addis Ababa as a new and permanent capital in which he established the embryonic government ministries of a centralised, modern state. Schools and roads were built. Work on a railway line from Djibouti to Addis Ababa commenced in October 1897. The line reached Dire Dawaon 24 September 1902 and Addis Ababa itself in 1917. The story of the attempted Italian conquest of Ethiopia, cut short at Adwa in 1896, did not end there, however. In December 1934 Italian forces opened fire on Ethiopian troops at Walwal in the Ogaden. This incident was the precursor to a devastating series of attacks, amounting to a full
scale — if undeclared — war and leading to the Italian occupation of Ethiopia from 1 936 to 1 941 . Ethiopian patriots carried out gueril la warfare throughout the five years of occupation and were, after the outbreak of World War II, finally joined by the Allied forces who helped them to regain their lost independence. However, unrest continued in the north. After 11 years of British administration, E ritrea was federated with Ethiopia in 1 952. 1 n 1 962 the federation was finally abolished by popular vote and Eritrea was fully integrated into Ethiopia as one of her 15 administrative regions. A revised Constitution was adopted by Ethiopia in 1955 with a



Overleaf: A mural depicting St. §37§ George slaying the dragon, which adorns the walls of St. Mary's Church at Axum.
nom inative Senate and an elective Chamber of Deputies. But despite the Constitution, things remained essentially as they had always been. The gap between rich and poor was widening; an antiquated system of land tenure was in force; corruption was rife and inefficiency prevailed in the judiciary; rigid censorship was enforced; heavy taxation was imposed on the peasantry; and only limited educational opportunities were provided for all but the elite. Unrest began to manifest itself in the 1950s among young officers and the student population of the country's colleges. There was an attempted coup d'etat in December 1 960 while the Emperor was out of the country, during which many government ministers were killed. The coup failed, and the ringleaders were executed. However, the event marked the beginning of open discontent with, and resentment against, the feudal regime. The following ten years saw the senile Emperor systematically losing his grip on events. In February 1974 there was a mass uprising in Ethiopia demanding an end to misrule and exploitation. A few minor reforms were granted; these half-measures, however, proved to be ineffective. The ageing Emperor was deposed on 12 September 1974, and the Coordinating Committee of the Armed Forces, the Police and the Territorial Army (the Derg) took power as the Provisional Military Government of Socialist Ethiopia. The 1974 Revolution has effected radical and far-reaching changes. The Rural Land Reform Proclamation has done away with any private claims to real estate. By nationalising all rural land, the Revolutionary Government of Socialist Ethiopia has made the peasantry the beneficiaries of the fruits of their own labour. The establishment of peasants' and urban dwellers' associations has made it possible for the people to run and administer their own day-today affairs and to coordinate development activities at the grass roots level. Prior to 1974 the illiteracy rate in Ethiopia stood at the monstrous level of 93 per cent. By February 1983 the UNESCO-award-winning National Literacy Campaign had reduced that figure to 45 per cent. The rate of
illiteracy in Ethiopia continues to fall — with universal literacy targeted for 1990.

Chapter 3 * Arts and Crafts
Ethiopia shares with Egypt the visible remains of a rich, ancient culture. But whereas Egypt's golden age was most closely associated with the Pharaohs, Ethiopia's art sprang from her early Christian heritage. I n a land of 1 5,000 churches, religious art has permeated much of the culture and priests share with warriors a love of richly embroidered and colourful costumes. Places of worship are often living museums of exquisite vestments. Ethiopia possesses an ancient civilisation, over 80 language groups, a unique alphabet, a varied geography, and a strategic location at the crossroads of Asia, Europe and Africa. These are some of the factors that have endowed the country with a truly eclectic but distinctly rich tradition of arts and crafts ranging from prehistoric cave paintings and tools to contemporary art forms.
Yared, the sixth century Ethiopian saint to whom is attributed the creation of the formalised sacred music and dance unique to this country, was the first man to devise and use an original system of musical notation in Africa. The system has three modes, or moods, and a complex notation of 700 signs.
ORNAMENT
The Ethiopian love of ornament, design and aesthetic art is reflected not only in the dress of the people but also in their personal adornment and domestic utensils. The country is a treasure-house of jewellery. Especially so are the monasteries and churches with their jewel-studded crowns and diadems, and with their daggers and shields set with rubies and emeralds. Jewellery and ornament form an important part of Ethiopian dress, thus keeping alive the traditional craftsmanship of goldsmiths and silversmiths.
The same creative tradition is maintained also by the humbler — but no
less impressive — skills of the rural weavers of grass, leather and hair; stringers of colourful glass-bead necklaces and cowrie shells; decorators of gourds; and tattooers of the human body.



§41 §
PARCHMENT PAINTINGS
The monasteries of Ethiopia produced some of the earliest illuminated parchments. These are of high standard in book decoration and have contributed a great deal to establishing a traditional style of painting on parchment. Priceless Ethiopian manuscripts can be found in libraries and museums in Leningrad, Leipzig, Vienna, the Vatican, London and elsewhere. The Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris possesses no fewer than 1,000 of these ancient manuscripts. Good, modern examples of brightly coloured illustrated stories drawn from Ethiopian history and the Bible are produced in large quantities, and despite the repetitiveness of subject matter individual artists produce very distinctive parchment paintings. The popular story revolving around the visit of the Queen of Sheba to the Court of King Solomon has given us pehaps the oldest comic strip in history. The ancient tradition of religious art is still very much alive. However, younger artists, many of them exceptionally gifted, have also evolved their own unique styles based on modern values, and this trend is particularly evident over the last 20 years.
MURALS
Church decorations, which in Ethiopia are second only to manuscript illumination in importance, are another medium for artistic expression. Many Ethiopian masterpieces may never be known to the outside world because they are painted on the walls and ceilings of remote and inaccessible churches or monasteries. A prodigious quantity of such murals exists, as well as small wooden panels, or triptychs, adorning the interior
of practically every church — both old and new — in Ethiopia.

§44§
MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS
Ethiopia's music and dances have their own distinctive characteristics and are tremendously varied in style and content. Like many other elements of Ethiopian culture, the country's music has affinities with both African and Levantine forms of artistic expression. I n Ethiopia, the north African arabesque chromatic style meets and comes to terms with the more simple pentatonic musical world of central Africa. This merging of instruments and styles from various sources has led to the development of musical traditions that are unique to this mountainous country. Among the most commonly-used instruments are a wide variety of drums similar to those found elsewhere on the continent. Side by side with these, however, are instruments unique to Ethiopia, such as the sixstringed krar believed to have originated from the 'kinnor' or the Hebrew lyre. Similarly, the begem, the largest and most dignified of Ethiopian string instruments, which resembles the lyre of the Greeks and Romans, is believed to be a replica of the biblical harp of David. The most popular traditional instrument is the masenko, a diamond-shaped one-stringed horse-hair fiddle and the only Ethiopian instrument played with a bow. Some of the wind instruments, made of bamboo cane, are the washint, popular with shepherds, and the embilta, a ceremonial instrument devoid of finger-holes, used for heralding. The me/e/cet is another wind instrument; resembling a trumpet, it is about a metre in length, has a bugle-type cap and no finger-holes. The longest bamboo instruments are the chechazey (made from bamboo enclosed in a cow's oesophagus). The extraordinary dinkey is 4.5 to 6 metres in length. The negarit is a small kettle-drum of about 45 centimetres in diameter. The kebero, another type of kettle-drum, comes in a wide variety of sizes and shapes, though it is usually tall and slender. The atamo is a small drum held in the hand, under the arm or between the knees of the player. The kebero, tsinatsil (sistrum), and the qatchel, a small hand-bell, are all used in church ceremonies.



§45§
CHURCH MUSIC AND DANCE
Ethiopian ecclesiastical music merits the term classical. It is quite different from the folk music of the country and its mastery requires years of rigorous training. Its origin and development are something of a mystery, although it is bel ieved that some of its elaborate and exotic dances may have come down from the mystery cults of ancient Egypt. Saint Yared, as noted above, is said to have composed the entire body of liturgical music. If this is indeed the case then he achieved a great deal. Music and dance within the
Ethiopian Orthodox Church are not — like the hymns and chants of other
churches — just additions to Mass or prayer; they constitute integral parts of the religious ceremony. And while they remain formal and solemn, the singing and the movements of the debteras (the church scholar-musicians) make for a lively, dramatic and mystifying show. As Edward Ullendorf states, "the entire spectacle, the carriage of the Tabot (Ark of the Covenant) in solemn procession, accompanied by singing, dancing, beating of staffs or prayer sticks, rattl ing of.sistrum and the sounding of drums, has caused all who have witnessed it to feel transported.
"

§48§
FOLK DANCE
Religious festivals, along with secular feasts and weddings, provide ideal occasions for folk dance in Ethiopia. A great deal of the colour in the Timket (Epiphany) and Maskal (the finding of the True Cross) comes from the dancing done by the huge crowd of people gathered to observe the occasion. After the ceremony proper, the crowd breaks up into smaller groups to sing and dance for much of the day. I n Ethiopia singing seldom takes place without some dancing, although there is variation as to what part of the song is accompanied by dance. There are all kinds of folk dances employing all forms and combinations of stamping, jumping, skipping, shaking, turning and twisting. Minjar has perhaps the most eclectic dance utilising shoulders, footwork, skipping, square-dance movements and dance-drama. With the Guraghe, footwork is the most important part of the dance. By contrast, the Wolaita from southern Ethiopia employ more intricate legwork and a more total participation of the whole body, set against the rhythm of drums. The Wolaita can provoke raucous laughter just by dancing with a stick. The Dorze have a form of dance which emphasises acrobatic skills; somersaults and cartwheels abound. With the Kotu (a branch of the Oromos living in Harerghe) it is the head that does most of the movement. Despite all this diversity there are certain characteristics of Ethiopian
folk dance which are general and widespread — at least amongst highlanders. One of the main types of dance movements in Ethiopia, the
eskista, or shoulder dance, is, for all practical purposes, common to most of them. In eskista the shoulders and chest move, rather than the feet.
However, several techniques are employed — jerking, shaking or twisting
— and the direction of the shoulder movements can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. With women the movement of the breasts is also significant. These subtle differences allow the eskista to express a whole range of
emotions — from the softest feeling of love, through the ecstasy of happiness to the wildest explosion of warlike spirit. These movements reveal the very soul and the different moods of the revelling Ethiopians. Although intricate footwork rarely accompanies eskista, this does not mean that the dancers stand still. On the contrary, they walk, turn, jump



§49§
and sometimes crouch almost to the ground. At moments of almost manic excitement the dancers draw air sharply through the teeth, making a susurration sounding like 'eskista'.
Another popular song-dance in Ethiopia — awardance — is the fukera, performed by warriors, their heads adorned by lions' manes, and carrying spears and shields. Between verses in which the warrior recounts his exploits he dances, holding his spear horizontally across his shoulders, moving his head from left to right, with his face set in a ferocious expression.
POTTERY
The potter's craft in Ethiopia goes back to the pre-Axumite civilisation of around 1,000 BC. The traditional potter, usually a woman, used only a knife-shaped bone and a piece of goat skin for moulding her pots into shape; the design being plain, with simple, incised geometric patterns. Superb traditional pottery is today produced by monks at the Sambo Tree Monastery in the north-east of the country. Monks prepare the clay, while the nuns mould pots into shape. Guraghe pots are embossed with knobs in a peculiar fashion and have loops for hanging them up when not in use. The Falashas of Gondar(followers of J udaism), traditional potters and blacksmiths, are unique in that they alone fashion human and animal figurines in stylised form.
CARVING
Carving is another traditional craft which continues to flourish in some parts of the country. Kaffa, with its hardy timber, produces some of the finest wood-carving in the country. The very popular three-legged J imma stool is carved from the solid trunk of the shola (sycamore) tree. Other carved objects made of wood include combs (of which the most ornate are used by the Afar people), rosary beads, bowls, camel bells, coffee urns, butter pots, and headrests. Covers for the Bible and prayer books are also carved from wood. Chairs, tables, stools, portable altars and, in some of the churches, remarkable ceilings, some dating back to early Christian times, bear intricately carved and beautiful designs.

§52§
HORNWORK
The horns of oxen, buffalo, ibex and oryx are made into various decorative and utilitarian objects. Drinking mugs are the most usual, but horn is also used for walking sticks, light fittings and jewellery.
WEAPONRY
Shields traditionally used by noblemen were made of skins, sometimes covered with velvet, and richly ornamented with metal embossing or filigree work. Shields for warriors were made of rhinoceros or hippopotamus hides and ornamented with raised bumps. Other accoutrements of Ethiopian warriors included finely made daggers, swords and spears, with richly designed scabbards of metal or leather.
WICKERWORK
Basket weaving is perhaps one of the most highly developed of all the crafts. The basket weavers of Harar are particularly famous. Woven from different coloured grasses and fibres, their wares are highly prized for their intricate designs. The mesob, a brightly fashioned tray woven into a conical
basket, used as a table — or with its lid on, as a food container — is exclusive to Ethiopia.



§53§
CROSSES AND METALWORK
Oral tradition has it that after the conflict between Islam and Christianity began, an Ethiopian emperor issued an edict commanding all his subjects to wear a cross around the neck to prove fidelity to their faith. Perhaps because of this hundreds of thousands of crosses of gold, silver, brass and other metals are to be found in Ethiopia. They range from small pendants made of delicate gold and silver filigree, or wrought in silver, gold, and iron, to huge processional crosses, and to the smaller hand crosses with characteristic square bases carried by priests. The symbolism, shape and style of other forms of Ethiopian metalwork vary according to the region or period of making. From couk mawchas (ear-wax cleaners) to incense burners, from the old silver filigree of Harar and Keren to the gilded and glittering crowns of Axum, they are highly refined works of art that are the result of a long indigenous tradition.
LEATHERWORK
Ethiopia has the largest livestock population in Africa — and one of the largest in the world in terms of per capita distribution. Because of this animal products in general have an important place in the life of Ethiopians
— and perhaps none more so than leather. There are leather mats, leather skirts, leather hats, leather cloaks and coveralls, leather sacks, leather milk pots and butter containers, and even leather homes. Leather is also used in combination with straw, bamboo,
wood, beads and cowrie shells — as in, for example, the gorgeous milk
and butter pots of Bale, the leather skirts of the Bena in Gamo Gof a, and the commonly seen ankelba, a baby-carrier strapped round the back of the mother. The traditional !unch-boxistheage/g/7, a leather-covered basket indigenous to Ethiopia, used also for carrying the personal effects of the bride to her new home. In addition there is a whole range of Ethiopian harnesses and riding equipment characterised by bright and blazing colours not usually associated with leather.

§56§
BEADS AND COWRIE SHELLS
Beads and cowrie shells are used as status symbols by some Ethiopian
lowlanders. The Galeb and the Bume peoples of the Omo Valley adorn themselves with huge quantities of beads and also use beads to decorate household goods and clothing. The kaleidoscope of costumes, objects made from beads and cowrie shells, and the great variety of decorative jewellery and coiffure found throughout Ethiopia are extensively documented in Ethiopian Costumes, another publication of the Ethiopian Tourism Commission.
WEAVING
As one approaches the village of Geech, high up in the Simien Mountains, one sees small huts or sheds adjacent to the bigger dwellings. In these sheds are men standing in waist-high holes with their hands moving in front of them. The sight is curious and little does one suspect that the men are
working with the simplest hand-and-foot looms. A similar method of weaving is employed by the Dorze of southern and central Ethiopia.
The Konso in Gamo Gofa, famous for their unique form of terraced agriculture, are also known for making huge cotton blankets called boolooko. It is common to see very old men sitting outside in the yard with a wad of fluffy cotton in one hand and an inzirt (the simple Ethiopian hand-threader, or distaff) in the other. From simple wares like this to the intricate embroidery of the Dorze, weaving has a rich and colourful history in Ethiopia. Fashion-conscious urban populations have given added impetus to the work of Ethiopian weavers and inspired the profusion of designs and patterns found today on the borders of shammas (shawls) and dresses. The classical Ethiopian lion woven out of tan, black, brown and white woollen fibres has achieved international recognition, as have the finely patterned rugs made by the students of the Handicrafts School and the Ethio-Craft Rehabilitation Centre.

A RENAISSANCE OF ETHIOPIAN FOLK CULTURE
Ethiopia's artists, craftsmen, and their trade have not always been accorded their due recognition. Azmaris (minstrels) and their profession were often belittled by the very people who enjoyed the sweet melodies of their masenko{a one-stringed musical instrument). Likewise, weavers, potters, smiths and scribes were not duly respected. Folk culture/and with it folk
song and dance, were neglected — and not appreciated — outside their restricted localities. All this is changing. Today artists and craftsmen practise their trade with pride as they make their own contribution to cultural and social development in Ethiopia. The Revolution has brought about a vigorous renaissance of Ethiopia's arts and crafts. As part of the National Cultural and Economic Development Campaign every town, and in most cases every kebele (neighbourhood association), has its own /c/netguad(cultural troupe) and its own cultural hall. A kinetguad is made up of amateur singers, dancers, poets <md writers, working with the song, dance and folklore of the nation; each troupe specialises in re-creating the folk culture, dance and music of its particular area. The repertoire of the professional national troupe is, however, a medley of all of Ethiopia's different cultures. These troupes put on entertaining skits, dance-dramas and musical shows on special occasions. With regard to the crafts, every kind of assistance and encouragement is given to all craftsmen. Organising, modernising and developing cottage industries is now a national concern, directed by a national body specially established for this purpose.

Chapter 4 • Nature and Wildlife
There are six main regions in the world set aside by conservationists as animal sanctuaries. Africa, south of the Sahara, is one of them because of its unique flora and fauna. Ethiopia, in a sense, is a microcosm of the entire sub-Saharan environment because of the huge variety of its ecosystems, terrains and geography. The Dallol area in the Danakil Depression, where the
temperature can rise to 50C — and which is more than 100 metres below
sea-level — shimmers with yellow and blue deposits of potassium. Insharp contrast are the 4,500 metres high, snow-capped Simien Mountains, and the arid Horn of Africa, both of which are rich in very different flora and fauna. The alpine Bale plateau boasts sparkling streams and the largest expanse of moorland in Africa. Also to be found in Ethiopia are colourful gorges deeper than the Grand Canyon; arid moonscapes with unique plant life and land formations; impenetrable jungles; and apparently endless plains and savannahs. There are also wonderlands of lakes, rivers, hotsprings, geysers, volcanic areas spouting steam, and untouched forests. Africa used to be known as the 'Dark Continent'. However, considerable areas have now been so much explored and developed that 'the back of beyond' of 50 years ago is today traversed by numerous trucks, mini-buses, and cars on well-worn routes. The wondrous spectacles of wildlife in many African national parks are now becoming more and more circumscribed by areas of human habitation, and, consequently, are becoming less and less the natural wonder they used to be.
The era of freshness and discovery is now, alas, over — or nearly so. Ethiopia is the sole exception Here the wilderness remains virtually
unchanged since time began and 'the back of beyond' still exists in plenty

in the mountains, in the savannahs and in the awesome deserts of the lowlands. Anyone who travels here in any direction will discover that he is breaking ground that few, other than the indigenous inhabitants, have ever been over before. There is the excitement of discovery in every footstep. The range, number and habitat of many Ethiopian birds, mammals, and other species of wildlife are still imperfectly known. "For those with a taste for something unusual, Ethiopia presents a call to adventure and provides an opportunity to find something new. There are



§61 §
remote areas rich in wildlife. Ethiopia has more large species of mammals than any East African country/' So writes the well-known naturalist, Dr. Leslie Brown, who contributed much to the campaign to save the Walia
ibex from extinction and who played a vital role in the UN declaration of the stunningly beautiful Simien Mountains as a world heritage area. At the same time also, a study financed by the EEC in 1981 considered
the Omo Val ley to be of paramount importance because it had long been recognised as a unique remnant in East Africa of untouched wildlife and wilderness. Ethiopia's geographical location and remarkable physical features have endowed it with a rich and varied natural heritage of vegetation and wildlife. Its avifauna, forexample, is one of the most diverse and abundant in Africa. Some 835 species of birds are found in Ethiopia, of which 26 are exclusive to Ethiopia. So far the existence of 103 species of mammals has been recorded in Ethiopia. Among the endemic mammal species are the Walia ibex, the Simien red fox, the Mountain nyala, the Gelada baboon, the Somali wild ass, Menilek's bushbuck and Swayne's hartebeest. The Walia ibex is found only in the Simien Mountain massif, while the Gelada baboon can also be found in other highland areas. It is to protect these rare species that the Simien Mountain National Park was established. The Nubian ibex(not an endemic animal) is found in the hills of northern Eritrea adjoining the Red Sea and further north along the Sudanese coast. The rare and shy Somali wild ass ranges over the Danakil area to the northeast. The Bale Mountains National Park is the home of the Simien red fox(found in larger numbers there than in the Simiens), the Mountain nyala, and Menilek's bushbuck. Ethiopia's seventh endemic animal, Swayne's hartebeest, is restricted to the Netch Sar National Park straddling the southernmost two of Ethiopia's Rift Valley lakes, Chamo and Abaya. There are pockets of wildlife and utter wilderness in all regions of Ethiopia. Generally speaking, however, the main wildlife concentrations occur in the southern and western half of the country, where most of the planned national parks, wildlife reserves, and controlled hunting areas are located. In total there are nine national parks at various stages of development, 14 wildlife reserves and 14 controlled hunting areas. Details on some of the most accessible parks and reserves are set out below.

§64§
AWASH NATIONAL PARK
The Awash National Park Is the oldest and most developed game reserve of its kind. It is bordered by the Awash river and lies some 225 kilometres east of Addis Ababa on the Assab highway. The 1,800 metres high semidormant Fantalle volcano, an extensive area of pools of mineral hot-springs fringed with doum palms, and the extraordinary phenomenon of rocky blisters (Hawaii is said to be the only other place on earth where these volcanic features are seen) are some of the attractions of this park. The wildlife consists mostly of East African plains game with the exception of giraffe and buffalo. The oryx, the bat-eared fox, the caracal, the aardvark, colobus and green monkeys, Anubis and Hamadryas baboons, the klipspringer, the leopard, the bushbuck, the hippo, the Soemmerring's gazelle, the Grevy's zebra, the cheetah, the greater and lesser kudu . . . and 400 species of birds are to be found within the 700-square-kilometre area of the Awash National Park.
BALE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK
Surprisingly enough it is not to the Simien Mountains that one should go to see the Simien red fox. The fox is now more abundant, and more easily seen, in the Bale Mountains National Park. With their vast moorlands, their lower reaches covered with St John's wort, their extensive heath, their virgin woodlands, their pristine mountain streams and with their alpine climate, the Bale Mountains are a beautiful world all of their own. Rising to a height of over 4,000 metres, the Bale mountain ranges border the southern highlands of Ethiopia. Mount Batu, the second highest peak in Ethiopia, is 4,307 metres high. The establishment of the Bale Mountains National Park was timely in saving the Mountain nyala, Menilek's bushbuck and the Simien red fox
— one of the most beautiful and colourful members of the dog family. All three endemic animals thrive in this environment and the nyala in
particular can be seen in large numbers. The creeks of the Park — which
become important rivers further down — are well stocked with rainbow and brown trout, introduced there from Kenya in the 1960s.



§65§
BARO RIVER
The Baro river area, accessible by land and air through the western Ethiopian town of Gambela, is unlike any other region in Ethiopia. It is a place of exciting adventure and one of the few remaining challenges to the explorer. Lost in the endless undulating plains of high Sudanese grass, the traveller can enjoy a sense of achievement in just finding his way. This is Ethiopia's true tropical zone and here all the elements of the African safari are to be found, enhanced by a distinctly Ethiopian flavour. Nile perch weighing over 100 kg have been caught in the waters of the Baro, and huge crocodiles thrive here on such fare. The White-eared kob is a rare and worthy trophy for hunters; Nile lechwe, buffalo, giraffe, tiang, waterbuck, Roan antelope, zebra, bushbuck, Abyssinian reedbuck, warthog, hartebeest, lion, elephant and hippotamus are also found here.
DAHLAK MARINE NATIONAL PARK
The Red Sea marine wonderland of the Dahlak archipelago (comprising
some 200 islands) offers a fascinating array of natural attractions. On the island shores gazelle browse among stunted acacia trees and geckos hide under the hot rocky outcrops. There is also a wonderful variety of birdl if e, including sooty falcon, brown booby, spoonbill, osprey, whimbrel and shrike. The most amazing sights however, are to be found in the shallow seas and among the coral gardens and reefs which surround the islands. Myriads of different species of marine life are to be found. The rare and gentle dugong(the 'sea cow' believed to have given rise to mermaid legends of old), the fierce barracuda and the manta ray are amongst the most familiar and easily identifiable. But there are many other more bizarre, exotic and colourful underwater creatures inhabiting this unspoiled marine environment. The Dahlak islands lie from 1 5 to110 kilometres off Massawa, scattered over an area of approximately 1 5,500 square kilometres. Many are barren, almost waterless, and only scantily inhabited. The climate is hot throughout the year, with average temperatures in winter of around 28C.

§68§
OMO NATIONAL PARK
The Omo National Park is situated in the remote south-west of Ethiopia.
It is adjacent to the Omo river, which flows southwards into Lake Turkana, supplying 92 per cent of its waters. The Park is one of the richest and least visited wildlife sanctuaries in eastern Africa. The eland, the oryx, Burchell's zebra, Lelwel's hartebeest, the buffalo, the giraffe, the elephant, and more common species like the waterbuck, the kudu, the lion, the leopard and the cheetah may be seen in great numbers. If one is lucky, one may also spot a pack of wild dogs.
The Omo Valley is virtually free from human habitation, except along
the banks of the river. The Omo National Park, the largest in the country with an area of 3,450 square kilometres, is a vast expanse of true wilderness.
The Omo Valley — including the Park area — is rich in palaeoanthropological remains. According to the 1982 findings of scientists of the University of California at Berkeley, the latest hominid remains from the
Omo Valley are probably over four million years old.
RIFT VALLEY LAKES
Much of Africa's volcanic activity is concentrated along the immense, 2,800-kilometres-long crack in the earth's surface known as the Rift Valley
— without doubt the greatest valley in the world. The valley is the result of two roughly paral lei faults in the earth's surface between which, in distant geological time, the crust was weakened and the land subsided. Ethiopia is often referred to as the 'water tower' of eastern Africa because of the many rivers that pour of f the high tableland. The Great Rift Valley's passage through Ethiopia is marked by a chain of lakes fed by these rivers. Numbering seven in all, the Rift Valley lakes each have their own special life and character and provide ideal habitats for the exuberant variety of flora and fauna that make the region such a delight for naturalists and tourists.



Overleaf: 'Crocodile Market, §69§ Lake Chamo. This lake and the Omo river contain some of the largest concentrations of Nile crocodile in the world.
Lake Zwai
The northernmost and largest of the chain, Zwai is a shallow freshwater lake. Its extensive aquatic vegetation attracts a variety of interesting water birds. Especially common and easy to see are the long-tailed cormorants,
darters, and various herons and storks — including the distinctive saddle bill stork. Wading through the water lilies are long-toed marsh birds such as the black crane and the greater jacana. The handsome African fish eagle perches in the fig-trees along the shoreline, throwing back its head to give its haunting, gull-like cry. Green pigeons, black-headed orioles, woodhoopoes, and barbets are also found here.
Lake Langano
Becauseof its hotels, campingfacilities, and its proximity to Addis Ababa

it is 210 kilometres south of the capital city — the brown-and-coppercoloured Lake Langano is popular for swimming, aquatic sports, sunbathing and for camping. There is also much of interest for bird-watchers. Along the shores of the lake many cliff-dwelling and acacia-inhabiting birds are
to be found. Fan-tailed ravens and hornbills — including Hemprich's hornbill whose nesting grounds at Langano were discovered and described
for the first time not too long ago — find ideal habitats amongst the surrounding cliffs. I n the acacia woodlands helmet-shrikes are to be found in great numbers along with colourful bush butcher-birds, several of whose pairs often combine to build a nest.









§72§
Lakes Abyata and Shala
Not far from Langano — and about 21 5 kilometres south of Addis Ababa
— are Lakes Abyata and Shala, situated in the heart of the Rift Valley Lakes National Park. The two lakes are exceptionally scenic stretches of water. Lake Shala is shrouded by an aura of primeval wonder, and may also be the deepest lake in Africa north of the equator. Lake Abyata, a soda lake, has vast expanses of white shoreline. But it is for their birdlife that these lakes are best known, with as many as 150 different species found here. At Abyata greater and lesser flamingoes abound, along with whitenecked cormorants, great white pelicans, several species of herons, storks,
spoonbills and ibises — includingthe sacred ibis(sacred to ancient Egypt)
— various species of African ducks, shorebirds, gulls, and terns often in their thousands. In addition, during the northern winter, thousands of Asiatic and European ducks and waders migrate to Abyata's shores. Lake Shala is well-known for its large colony of great white pelicans
— undoubtedly the most important breeding colony for this species in Africa. The sacred ibis, Abdimi's stork and the white-necked cormorant are also found here in abundance. Although the bird colonies of both these lakes are protected from human disturbance, most species can readily be observed at Abyata where they regularly fly from their breeding grounds to feed. The Park's acacia woodlands, cliffs, and riverine forests also provide excellent environments
for bird-watching — the forests being especially good fortrogons, turacos and weavers.



§73§
Lake Awasa
When it comes to the aesthetic values of lacustrine peace and serenity,
Lake Awasa — lying just south of the town of Shashamane — is peerless. A gentle chain of mountains and a low plateau surround the lake, opening
to a wide, low bay in the south. Swampy bays interspersed with volcanic rocks, sandy shores with bare rocky hills, and every formation of terrain imaginable can be found near Lake Awasa. The lake teems with a great variety of fish, and, as elsewhere in the Rift Valley, there are many species of birds.
Lakes Abaya and Chamo
The two southernmost of the chain of Ethiopia's Rift Valley lakes, Abaya and Chamo are the lushest in vegetation and the richest in wildlife.
The lakes support many species of fish — including the Nile perch and
the tiger fish — and hordes of hippos and crocodiles. Local people call one spot on the western shores of Lake Chamo Azo Gabia, or 'Crocodile Market', because of the huge numbers of crocodiles to be seen there. One should take a good look at an Ethiopian country market to appreciate the accuracy of this analogy. The Netch Sar National Park embraces the eastern shores of Lakes Abaya and Chamo. Netch Sar was established as a sanctuary for Ethiopia's seventh
endemic animal — Swayne's hartebeest — an endangered species.
The bluff between the two lakes — locally known as the 'Bridge of
Heaven' — is carpeted with luxuriant vegetation and gives life to numerous
springs. The town of Arba Minch — meaning 'forty springs' — takes its name from these gushing streams.

§76§
SIMIEN MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARK
In the earth's long history of violent geological changes, the most recent volcanic upheavals took place in eastern Africa. The region's torrential rains created many gushing waterfalls, which in turn eroded away the newly-formed mountain massifs, creating the great gorges and gullies so typical of the area. The Simien Mountain massif is a broad plateau, cut off on the north and west by an enormous single crag over 60 kilometres long. To the south the tableland slopes gently down to 2,200 metres, divided by gorges 1,000 metres deep that can take up to two days to cross. Not enough geological time has elapsed to smooth the contours of the crags and buttresses of hardened basalt. As far as the eye can see (looking north from the escarpment), the fused volcanic cores jut up starkly, defying the elements. Overhead stretches the vast dome of sky of the deepest blue, which spreads downwards as clear as sapphire to the mauve of the horizon. I n this spectacular splendour are to be found the Walia ibex, the Simien red fox, and the Gelada baboon (three of Ethiopia's endemic animals). Other species include the Hamadryas baboon, the klipspringer and the bushbuck, as well as birds like the lammergeyer(the famous bone-breaker), the Auger buzzard, Verreaux's eagle, the kestrel and the Lanner falcon. The Simien Mountains National Park covers 225 square kilometres of highland area at an average elevation of 4,000 metres. The highest peak in Ethiopia and the fourth highest in Africa, Ras Deshen, which rises to 4,620 metres, stands adjacent to the Park. The Park is situated 120 kilometres north-east of Gondar, the castlecity of Africa and one of the former capitals of Ethiopia. The Simien escarpments, which are often compared to the Grand Canyon of the United States of America, have been adopted by UNESCO as a world heritage site.



Chapter 5 • Towns and Cities to Visit
ADDIS ABABA
With a population of 1.2 million people, Addis Ababa is not only the political capital but also the economic and social nerve-centre of Ethiopia. Founded by Emperor Menilek in 1887, this big, sprawling, hospitable city stil I bears the stamp of his exuberant personality. More than 21 ,000 hectares in area, Addis Ababa is situated in the foothills of the 3,000 metres Entoto Mountains and rambles pleasantly across many wooded hillsides and gullies cut through with fast-flowing streams. The altitude of the city itself ranges from 2,200 metres to 2,500 metres above sea-level. There was never an urban plan as such for Addis Ababa, and the capital
has therefore grown in a very natural way over the years — with no social or economic segregation. Thus, the most modern buildings, gleaming in their marble and anodised aluminium, stand side by side with simple country-style huts surrounded by cattle, sheep, goats and chickens. Millions of eucalyptus trees planted on the hillsides add their characteristic aroma to the fresh mountain air. Before moving to the present site of Addis Ababa, Menilek had established temporary capitals at six different locations. He built or enlarged each town he lived in, and then moved on and abandoned it to its own destiny. Asked to explain this practice by a Frenchman, Monsieur
Mondon Vidaye, Menilek — then on the point of abandoning Addis Ababa

is reported to have replied: "Why do I move on each time? For the
same reason that my predecessors kept on moving. It is because we have
exhausted the firewood of the area — and we have to move on to an area where there is an abundant supply of firewood. " The Frenchman suggested
to Menilek an alternative to the impermanence of Ethiopian cities — the planting of a fast-growing tree. Menilek said he would be glad to stay in Addis Ababa if he could find a tree that would grow fast enough to meet the city's clamouring demand for fuel. The result was the introduction
of the eucalyptus from distant Australia — and this tree is the real secret
of Addis Ababa's existence and success. The city — its name translated
into English means 'New Flower' — became Ethiopia's first permanent capital since the decline of Gondar. Rules and regulations were laid down in 1907 enabling people to buy and sell land in Addis Ababa. A year later the new capital got its first mayor, and two years later people began to acquire title deeds to their land.

Restaurants in Addis Ababa
There are a number of restaurants offering various exotic dishes from many parts of the world. Ethiopian food is served atthe Addis Ababa Restaurant, the Maru Dambia, the Filwoha Adarash, the Ghion Hotel Tukul, and the Africa Hotel restaurant. Chinese food is served at the China Bar, the Hong
Kong, and the Chung Hwa restaurants. European food is served at the Cottage, the Lalibela Restaurant, at the Hilton, and at all main hotels. Middle Eastern dishes are the speciality of the Omar Khayyam; while the Sangam offers an array of excellent Indian specialities. Italian food is served at Castelli's and the Villa Verde.
Entertainment
There are six cinemas showing international films with English dialogue or sub-titles. Most of these cinemas also stage dramas in Amharic depicting Ethiopia's social and cultural life during different historical epochs.
Shopping
The shops in Addis Ababa are fairly well stocked with almost all consumer goods. The local jewellery, sold by the weight of gold or silver, is in particularly high demand. The main market-place, known as the Mercato, has a wonderful range of goods and products, items of local art and
Ethiopian curios. Here, hagglingover prices is expected — andoneshould allow ample time for this. At the shops in town, however, prices are fixed, although a small discount is often allowed on large purchases. The Ethiopian Ceramic Workshop supplies kiln-fired pottery in traditional styles.

Places to Visit in Addis Ababa
Addis Ababa University The main campus of the Addis Ababa University lies in the Sidist Kilo area. This campus occupies a palace and stands in grounds inherited by Haile Sellassie from his father. The palace itself was built by Haile Sellassie in amodern style, before the Italian occupation of Ethiopia. The Institute of Ethiopian Studies and the Ethnological Museum in the same grounds are also well worth a visit.
St. George Cathedral The St. George Cathedral was built in 1896 in the traditional octagonal shape in commemoration of Ethiopia's military success at the Battle of Adwa. (St. George is the patron saint of the soldier). The Italians partially burnt it down in 1937; however the Cathedral was restored after the Second World War. It houses modern paintings by Master-Artist Afework Tekle, an Ethiopian painter whose work has won wide international recognition.
Menilek Mausoleum and the Trinity Cathedral The Menilek Mausoleum was built in 1911 and the Trinity Cathedral in 1941. Both serve as tombs of emperors, princes and Ethiopian martyrs of freedom. Menilek's wife, Taitu, and his daughter, Zauditu, are also entombed at the Mausoleum. The Trinity Cathedral was built to commemorate Ethiopia's liberation from five years of Italian occupation. Its interior resembles that of many European churches. However, its hall is divided into three parts, with two outer aisles and the Holy of Holies in the centre.

§84§
The Mercato The Mercato covers a vast area in western Addis Ababa. It is the largest open market-place in Africa and presents the visitor with a confusing, but fascinating, medley of people and culture. It is divided into areas specialising in various goods and products. The section dealing with Ethiopian arts, crafts, and antiques such as metal crosses in many different designs, manuscript books, old swords, drums and musical instruments, holds the most obvious fascination for tourists. However, the spices on sale in the market, the vegetables, baskets and carpets are also interesting to contemplate in their rich diversity.
Entoto
Addis Ababa lies in the natural amphitheatre of the surrounding hills the Entoto being prominent among them. When Menilek first came here a century ago his builders originally started work on the chilly and eerie heights of E ntoto, before moving down to the comfort of the valley. Little remains of this early town, with the sole exception of the Mariam and Raguel churches, both of which have interesting murals.



§85§
Excursions from Addis Ababa
The small town of Bishoftu, or Debre Zeit, is only about an hour's drive south-east of Addis Ababa. It is surrounded by three volcanic crater-lakes which offer swimming, boating and water-skiing. The Managasha Park lies about 35 kilometres west of Addis Ababa. A mountain forest sanctuary for birds and animals, Managasha is also a favourite weekend resort. Mountain-climbing through the forest to the great crater of Wachacha is also popular. Ambo, or Hagere Heywot, is situated about 1 25 kilometres west of Addis Ababa on the same road. It is a popular spa with a hot-spring swimming pool. From here it is an easy excursion to the beautiful volcanic craterlake of Wonchi, 26 kilometres away along a dirt track in serene surroundings. A hundred kilometres north of Addis Ababa on the Gondar road is the revered and ancient monastery of Debre Libanos. Founded by St. Tekle Haimanot, it is set in spectacular surroundings at the bottom of an immense gorge through which one of the tributaries of the Blue Nile flows. The Abbot of Debre Libanos is regarded as the head of all Ethiopian monasteries and bears the title of Itchege.

ASMARA
The main metropolis of Eritrea, Asmara (with a population of 373,830) is the second largest city in Ethiopia. Lying at an altitude of 2,300 metres above sea-level, Asmara has a climate typical of the Ethiopian highlands. Prior to the Italian occupation of Eritrea in 1 889 it had been a small church village and the camp of Ras Alula, then the Governor of Hamassien. Under the Italians Asmara developed into a sizeable town with a 'native quarter' (now the market-place) and a European section (now the main shoppingcentre). Liberated by Allied troops in ApriM 941, Eritrea remained under a British Military Administration until 11 September 1952, when it was federated with Ethiopia by a decision of the United Nations. Eritrea was fully united with Ethiopia on 14 November 1962.
Excursions from Asmara A few hours' drive from Asmara the traveller comes across a number of historic sites. Some of these are rich in remains of bygone civilisations
— including the pre-Christian Sabaean and the Axumite civilisations. South of Asmara lie Sanafe and Adigrat. 116 kilometres along the road to Adigrat there is a small site of ancient Axumite ruins. Pillars of one of the ancient buildings can be seen on the right-hand side of the road. Between the 121 and 122 kilometre posts, an 11-kilometre dirt track leads to one of the most famous ancient cities of Ethiopia: Cohaito (or Coloe as the Greeks called it). The track is rough, and negotiable only by four-wheel-drive vehicle, but well worth the effort of following. There are extensive remains of buildings, tombs, and a beautifully cut stone reservoir. In the cliffs nearby are some old cave paintings. There are Axumite buildings at Yeha dating back to the 5th or 4th century
BC, while at Matara — near Senafe, and 135 kilometres from Asmara is the only as yet undisturbed site of an Axumite city, with ancient walls and staircases preserved in near-perfect condition. There is also an obelisk bearing an inscription that is one of the earliest examples of Ge'ez writing.
On the road from Adigrat to Axum the monastery of Debre Damo is to be found. The oldest of its kind in Ethiopia, it is built on top of an amba (table mountain). Visitors to it must be hauled up the steep cliff-sides by rope.



§89§
AXUM
Axum, the site of Ethiopia's most ancient city, is today a small town blissfully ignorant of its glorious past. The 16th century Cathedral of St. Mary of Zion is built on the site of a much older church probably resembling that of Debre Damo, dating from the 4th century AD. Only a platform and the wide stone steps remain from the earlier structure. The Cathedral is the repository of the crowns of some of Ethiopia's former emperors. According to church legend, it also houses the original Ark of the Covenant
— thus making St. Mary's the holiest sancturary in Ethiopia. The most striking relics of Axum are, however, its obelisks or steles, some still standing, some fallen. They are made of single blocks of granite carved in the representation of multi-storey buildings. The tallest, now fallen, stood over 33 metres high and represented a building of 1 3 storeys. The biggest obelisk still standing is 23 metres high, with 10 storeys. The carving is deep and precise, showing the beams for each floor, and the windows. The style of construction depicted is similar to that still in fashion in Hadramaut in South Yemen. Other historical sites include the graves of King Kaleb and King Gabre Meskel, the so-called Bath of the Queen of Sheba, and the ruins of the vast Royal Palace over which, unfortunately, the road to Gondar now passes. The market-place has interesting curios and ancient coins for the delight of tourists. The Yeha Hotel is a tourist-class lodge. Reservations must be made in advance.

BAHAR DAR
Bahar Dar nestles in the southern shores of Lake Tana, and is a centre for boating to the islands on the lake and excursions to the Tissisat Falls
— the most spectacular waterfall on the Blue Nile river. The monastery of Dek Stefanos has a priceless collection of icons and manuscripts and houses the mummified remains of a number of Ethiopian emperors, including Yikuno Amlak (1 268-1 283), Zara Yaqob (1 43^1 468), and Fasiladas (1632-1665). There are monasteries on some 20 other islands and peninsulas on Lake Tana. The nearest to Bahar Dar are Kebran Gabriel (forbidden to women) and Ura Kidanemereth, on the Zegie Peninsula, which is famous for its frescoes. Bahar Dar is a commercial centre of considerable local importance. The large USSR-built Polytechnic Institute and the UNESCO-sponsored Pedagogic Academy are located there. The Ras and Ghion Hotels provide excel lent service and the Tana Hotel is equally impressive in its catering.
DIRE DAWA
With a cosmopolitan population of 94,000, Dire Dawa lies 51 7 kilometres
east of Addis Ababa — marking approximately the half-way point to Djibouti. Its warm and dry climate contributes to its relaxing and congenial atmosphere. The market-place is frequented by camel-herding Oromos, Somalis, and Afars. There are some caves near the town with prehistoric cave paintings.
There are two fairly good hotels — the air-conditioned Ras, which has a swimming pool, and the Karamara. Dire Dawa has two pleasant openair cinemas.



§93§
GAMBELA
Empty docks and huge warehouses fallen into disuse are a reminder of the time when the western Ethiopian town of Gambela was a prosperous trading centre and a thriving inland port. The navigable Baro river connects it with Khartoum, 1 ,388 kilometres away and, because of this, during the late 1940s the British government was permitted to establish port facilities here. One of the motorboats still in use at Gambela was brought upriver from Khartoum by the British more than a quarter of a century ago. Navigation on the Baro is possible only during the Ethiopian rainy season from June through September. At one time traffic during those months was so heavy that 30 to 40 vessels at any one time could be seen lined up to offload or take on cargo at Gambela. Present developments point to a full revival of the economic potential of the waterway in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, the new Baro Bridge at Gambela, the longest bridge in Ethiopia, completed in 1981, is contributing to a transformation of the life of the region.
The landscape, the climate, the vegetation, and the Nilotic peoples
the Anuak and the Nuer — of the lowlands around Gambela are quite unique. The western section of the Ethiopian highland plateau comes to an abrupt end in the province of lllubabor, just beyond the picturesque town of Gore. From here the land falls away rapidly into the Nilotic lowlands of Gambela, going through a series of fast and fascinating changes that impress upon the traveller the intimate nature of the links between lifestyle and geography in Ethiopia. Descending from the highlands, compressed between high and narrow banks of severe black rock, pouring angrily over rapids, the Baro suddenly loses its momentum as it reaches the lowlands and spreads out into a riverbed of white sand with the banks 1 00 metres or so apart. Mango and banana plantations intersperse with Anuak settlements of low grass huts while, further downstream, vast grassland plains begin, with the only sign of cultivation being sorghum and bean fields close to the river. From here westwards beyond Itang and Jickaw, the Anuak cultivators give way to the pastoral Nuer, whose love of cattle is legendary. Nuer cattle camps, into which whole herds of longhorns are gathered at night for security, make a dramatic and beautiful sight. There is one tourist-class hotel in Gambela.

§96§
GONDAR
Gondarwas the capital of Ethiopia from the rise of Fasiladas (1632-1665) to the fall of Tewodros (1855-1868). The city's unique imperial precinct contains a number of castles built by various emperors during that era. Although the earliest of these castles was built by Fasiladas just after the expulsion of the Portuguese, the architecture at first sight seems to reflect Moorish-European influence. However, closer scrutiny reveals interesting architectural features of the Axumite tradition and a strong affinity with contemporary styles of building fashionable in South Arabia. An aura of mystery still shrouds the intellectual parentage of the ideas and skills behind these magnificent castles. Elsewhere in Condar is the palace known as Ras Beit built in the 18th century as the private residence of the famous king-maker, Ras Mikael
Sehul — and in continuous use ever since. It now serves as Government offices. A short distance away from it is the Bath of Fasiladas and the so-called House of Chickens. Within easy access of Gondar lies a monastery, the ruined palace at Kusquam, and the church of Debre Berhan Sel lassie with its unique murals. The town itself has a lively and interesting market-place.
There are four hotels in Gondar — one luxury-class and three touristclass.



§97§
HARAR
The 54-kilometre drive from Dire Dawa to Harar up the escarpment of the Rift Valley is a memorable experience. The warm desert-like aura of Dire Dawa soon gives way to rolling, rich, green farmlands. The road passes the lakes Adele and Alemaya. Some of Ethiopia's best coffee is cultivated in these highland areas, and a mild stimulant known as khat also grows extensively in this region. Harar was a fiercely religious city from the early days of the expansion of Islam until 1887, when the authority of the central government was restored by Menilek. With its 99 mosques, Harar is considered to be the fourth most holy city of Islam. It was after first seizing Harar that Ahmed Gragn launched his attack on the Christian highlands in 1527. Sir Richard Burton's visit to Harar in 1855 nearly cost him his life, when he found it harder to evade detection there than he had done on his visit to Mecca. The French poet, Rimbaud, also chose Harar as his city of exile from French intolerance. The whole setting of medieval walls tightly embracing the ancient city, its rich and exciting market-place (probably the most colourful in Ethiopia), its towering and majestic mountains, and its bracing, cool ai«r make Harar an exciting place to visit. The local Ras Hotel provides first-class catering facilities. From Harar, the road leads through a scenic valley strewn with weird
wind-weathered rocks, to Jijiga — an important marketing centre.

§100§
KEREN
About90 kilometres north-west of Asmara, in a mountain stronghold, lies Keren. Occupied by Egypt in 1872 and acquired by Italy in 1888, it was, much more recently, the scene of the bloodiest Anglo-Italian fighting during the 1941 Liberation Campaign. The town's British War Cemetery bears vivid remembrance to this. Keren is the major trading centre for the western lowlands: its market-place specialises in silverwork, beads, and in the production of all manner of tropical fruits. In and around the town grow ancient baobab trees. In one of these, about one kilometre north of the town, is the mystic shrine of Mariam Daari, literally 'the church inside a tree'. Lower in altitude than Asmara, Keren has a delightful, relaxing climate.
LALIBELA
The best way to get to Lai ibela is by air. One can cover the eight-kilometre distance from the airstrip to the Rocks of Ages in a 45-minute drive by
four-wheel-drive vehicle — or a three-hour ride on muleback. The surrounding landscape is amongst the most rugged and awe-inspiring in the country. King Lalibela is credited with the creation of the11 rock-hewn churches
in the 12th century. Their incredible execution — one cannot say
'construction' as they were carved inside and outside from solid rock their treasures, and the priests who serve in them, are a living expression of the magnetic fascination of medieval Ethiopia. During the season of 'big rains' from J une through September, the town is inaccessible. A visit during Ethiopian Easter, Timket (Epiphany) in January, or during some other major church festival is particularly rewarding. The Seven Olives and the Roha provide excellent hotel facilities.



16th century. ArouncM 850 control passed from them to the Egyptians
from whom the Italians took over under a special arrangement in 1885. A causeway now connects Massawa to Taulud Island, and another causeway runs from Taulud to the mainland. Arkiko, a village lying a mile or so south on the mainland, was the main port of entry into Ethiopia until the 1850s. While some of the smaller buildings on Massawa Island are several hundred years old, most of the larger ones date from the 20 years following 1870. The palace was built between 1871 and 1873 by Werner Munzinger, a Swiss scholar and businessman employed by the Egyptian Khedive as Governor of Massawa. The perfect white sands of Gurgusum Beach, 15 minutes' drive north along the coast from Massawa, extend for several miles. A second delightful beach is located on Green Island, in a bay a short boat-ride from Massawa. Massawa has two international-standard restaurants offering savoury seafood, and there are also several small nightclubs. The Red Sea and the Dahlak Hotels in Massawa provide excellent catering facilities.

Chapter 6 * Useful Tips and Guidelines
Airlines and Air Services
Ethiopia is fortunate in having an experienced and internationally-reputed national carrier. Airline Executive, the international magazine of the air transport industry recently characterised Ethiopian Airlines as "one of Africa's pace-setting airlines and the airline with the fastest growing system of international routes within the continent/' Ethiopian Airlines serves 27 cities in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Its domestic service, which still flies the legendary DC-3 aircraft, links 43 airfields and 21 landing strips with the capital city. Of these, only Asmara and Dire Dawa airports are presently equipped to handle jets. Ethiopian Airlines maintains the most modern and comprehensive training schools for pilots and aircraft maintenance technicians in the region. Over 30 airlines utilise these centres for the training of their own employees. Ethiopia is also served by Aeroflot, Air Djibouti, Air-India, Alitalia, Alyemda, CAAC, Interflug, Kenya Airways, Lufthansa, Nigeria Airways and Yemenia Yemen Airways. Addis Ababa's Bole I nternational Airport is shortly to be expanded, and will be able to handle even the largest of the new-generation wide-body aircraft. The airport is about eight kilometres from the city, and has one restaurant and one of the largest duty-free shops in the world, of which there are small branches in the arrival and departure lounges. There are also banking facilities and a Tourist Information Desk. Airport Tax is levied on all departing passengers (with the exception of transit passengers) at the rate of E.Birr 8 for international departures and E.Birr 2 for domestic flights. It is possible to enter Ethiopia by land and sea from Djibouti, Kenya and the Sudan. Asmara, Dire Dawa and Moyale are secondary ports of entry and exit, but the vast majority of travellers to Ethiopia arrive and leave through Addis Ababa. This occasionally creates a shortage of hotel accommodation during Ethiopia's tourist season, from December through May. You can reserve your room in advance through Ethiopian Airlines, which has offices or agents in all the major cities of the world, or through National Tour Operation (see section "Tours and Travel Arrangements" for address).

Car and Taxi Services in Addis Ababa
National Tour Operation (NTO) maintains large fleets of vehicles ranging from chauffeur-driven saloon cars for hire, limousines for airport to hotel transfers, luxury air-conditioned buses for tours and four-wheel-drive safari vehicles. The cream-coloured NTO Mercedes taxis are stationed outside all the major hotels and at the airport They have reasonable fixed rates, and a receipt is given for the fare. The small blue and white taxis that ply around the city are not usually for single-party occupancy hire, nor do they always go where the customer wishes. If you stop one, you should first ask if the driver is going in your direction, and fares (which start as low as 0.25 Birr) must be negotiated at the beginning of your trip. NTO's basic rates for a chauffeur-driven car range from $8 to $15 per day, depending on the vehicle required. The rates per kilometre are between
$0.50 and $0.80. NTO has branches at the airport (telephone: 18.21.77) and at the Hilton Hotel (telephone: 15.33.83).
Cinemas
Most films are in English with Arabic and French subtitles. There are seven cinemas in Addis Ababa, but some of these can be crowded and untidy and are not recommended for tourists. Showings begin at 4.30, 6.30 and 9 p.m. Admission usually costs $2.00.



§111§
Courtesies
A saying from the Ethiopian highlands enjoins that one's home is for entertaining strangers. The same hospitable principle applies throughout, the country today, whether in shops, modern offices or a humble hut on a. country road. Whatever the traveller's reasons for stopping by, chances are that he will be met first with an eager face and a series of questions aimed at ascertaining his well-being, country of origin and his purpose for visiting. And the next enquiry is likely to be: "Please, tea or coffee?" Getting the tea or coffee may take as long as half an hour, but you should accept the offer to please your Ethiopian host. And if you are in a hurry to proceed with the business of your call, you will not speed up matters by forgoing the hospitality.
For a people to whom 3,000 years is as close as yesterday, and whose heritage goes back millions of years, time does not march with as much speed as it does for Western visitors. There is a genuine effort under way in all quarters of Ethiopia to make people more mindful of time, but old habits die hard; the person who expects punctuality and a sense of urgency will be unduly frustrated in Ethiopia. Another highland proverb says that "patience is bitter, but her fruits are sweet." Take heed of this bit of wisdom and allow yourself as much time as you can in all your dealings in Ethiopia. In the highlands and among traditional folk smoking is not appreciated and it is forbidden inside church grounds and in front of priests. Removing your shoes is another courtesy expected of you when entering church buildings or mosques.



§11 2§

§11 6§
Doctors and Dentists
As there is an acute shortage of doctors and full medical facilities the backlog and queues for medical attention are often formidable. Let us hope that you do not feel the need to call on them. But if the necessity does arise, the best thing to do is to go straight to the Emergency entrance of the nearest hospital, or ask your hotel to call a doctor.
Some hospitals and clinics in Addis Ababa:
Anti-Epidemic Clinic; Black Lion Hospital; Balcha Hospital; Ethio-Swedish Hospital; Gandhi Memorial Hospital; Menilek Hospital; Ras Desta Hospital; St. Paul's Hospital; St. Peter's Sanatorium; TB Centre; Yekatit 12 Hospital; Zauditu Hospital. The hospitals and pharmacies are put on rotation for service during the night and on public holidays. You will find which are on duty from the radio or the daily newspapers.
Electrical Current
Electricity supply is 220 volts 50 cycles AC. American-manufactured electrical appliances usually need an adaptor before they can be plugged in to wall sockets. Sudden, unexpected blackouts can happen even in Addis Ababa.
Emergencies
In an emergency dial: 44.51.69 for Ambulance services 11.24.00 for Fire services 11.94.44 for Police
Hairdressers
There are modern salons in both the Hilton and Chion Hotels, but others in the city include:
A.H. Hair Studio, telephone 44.79.86 Finfine Beauty Salon, telephone 44.59.58 May Fair Hairdresser, telephone 44.08.83 Zeru Barber Shop, National Theatre building.



Overleaf: A fleet of luxury air- §11 7§ conditioned buses run by the National Tour Operation await visitors outside Addis Ababa's Ghion Hotel.
Health and Visa Requirements
In order to enter or leave Ethiopia you are required to be in possession of a valid International Health Certificate showing inoculation against yellow fever (which must be dated no later than six days prior to arrival in Ethiopia). Travellers from, or who have transited through, cholerainfested areas must also have a valid certifice of vaccination. Valid passports or travel documents are required, although nationals of South Africa will not be permitted entry. Visas are required for visitors to Ethiopia, with the exception of nationals of Kenya. Transit visas (valid for a maximum of three days) can be obtained on arrival. Tourist visas (valid for 30 days, renewable for a further period of 60 days) can be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but should normally be obtained through Ethiopian diplomatic missions abroad. Visitors to Ethiopia should be aware that, besides entry visas, travel passes are also required for those wishing to journey widely in the countryside outside Addis Ababa. Only guided tourism is permitted in Ethiopia, and unless one is visiting a relative, travelling without a professional tour guide, a business sponsor or an escort is discouraged.
Health Precautions
Prophylactics against malaria (not in fact necessary in Addis Ababa as the city itself is above the malaria risk zone) are advisable if you have planned trips in the countryside, especially to the lowlands. In theoutlying regions it is wise to drink only boiled water, or the bottled mineral waters that are available everywhere. Swimming in lakes or rivers should be avoided, as there is always a risk of contracting bilharzia. However, hotel swimming pools, the many hot-water springs, and the alkaline lakes at Debre Zeit and Langano are safe to swim in. Travellers should remember that Ethiopia is the 'Roof of Africa', and that the high altitude of most of the country puts a strain on the heart and nervous system until one is acclimatised, so avoid any unnecessary physical exertion for the first few days. Sufferers from heart ailments or high blood pressure should consult their doctor before coming to Ethiopia. Avoid contact with stray dogs and cats as a precaution against rabies.

§120§
Hotels
The Ethiopian Hotels and Spas Corporation is responsible for the development and maintenance of the country's state-owned hotels, restaurants, resorts and spas. EHCs establishments are divided into six regional chains, each chain having a parent hotel in Addis Ababa (or Asmara in the case of the Ambassoira group, consisting of the hotels in Eritrea). The Historic Route is served by the largest chain, the Ghion. The east belongs to the Ras, the west to the Ethiopia, and the south to the Wabi Shebelle. The specialised Filwoha chain consists of spas such as Wondo Guenet, and Sodere resort. The Hilton is independently managed. There are good tourist-class hotels in Addis Ababa, along the Historic Route, in Asmara, Harar, Dire Dawa, and the northern Rift Valley Lakes area. Rather spartan accommodation is also available in all the major towns, but these hotels and lodging houses are not recommended for tourists, unless absolutely necessary. Besides, foreigners are required to stay only in Government-approved hotels, where such hotels exist. The Addis Ababa Hilton International is, of course, a luxury hotel of international standard. The nearby Ghion Hotel, which was completely
refurbished for the 1 9th OAU Summit Meeting, makes a good, and slightly less expensive, alternative.

§122§
Languages
There are more than 80 major language groups in Ethiopia, but the national language, Amharic, is spoken throughout the country. Orominya and Tigrinya are other widely-used Ethiopian languages. English is the second official language and is understood in all the towns and among the modern and educated sector of the population. French, Italian and Arabic are also widely understood. It is useful to try to learn some words of Amharic; your efforts in this direction will be appreciated. A few useful phrases:
Tena Yistilign — a common greeting, that can be used with anyone and at all occasions
Sint naw — how much is it?
Mercato yat naw — where it the Mercatp?
Buna alle — is there coffee?
Yellem — there is not any
Ameseginalehu — thank you



§123§
Money
The monetary unit of Ethiopia is the Ethiopian Birr, with a par value of E. Birr 2.07 to US$1 .00. The Birr is divided decimally, and coins are circulated in values of 1, 5,10, 25 and 50 cents. Notes are printed in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 50 and 100 Birr. Under Ethiopian law, only the National Bank of Ethiopia may deal in the exchange of foreign currency. However, the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia, its branches, and some major hotels act as agents for the National Bank in exchanging foreign currency. Receipts must be kept as these will permit reconversion into foreign currency. There are no restrictions on the amount or kind of foreign currency, traveller's cheques, letters of credit or bank drafts which may be imported into Ethiopia by visitors. All currency imported must be declared on the official currency form when entering the country. No Ethiopian currency in excess of E.Birr 10 may be brought in or taken out of the country by any individual. Visitors may; not export foreign currency in excess of the amount and kind originally brought in. Tourists are expected to have spent a minimum of $50 per day while in the country and this is taken into account when reconverting local currency. Currency may not be exported by mail, except by permission of the National Bank of Ethiopia. Credit cards are accepted at only a very few major establishments in Ethiopia, such as the Hilton, Ethiopian Airlines and other major carriers, all of them in Addis Ababa.



§124§
Nightlife
The Dahlak Paradise (in the same building as the Ambassador Theatre and the Harambee Hotel) is billed as the most modern and trendy nightclub in Africa. The Ghion Hotel has the only Casino in Addis Ababa. The Ghion's new bar and restaurant, Unity House, is in the best tradition of the hotel. The Africa, Hilton, Ras, and Wabi Shebelle hotels all have nightclubs. In Ethiopia, a bar is euphemistically called buna bet (coffee house). But there is only one Coffee House. The Coffee House (located opposite the Egyptian Embassy, near Sidist Kilo) is rightly called the best place of its kind in East Africa. It is unrivalled for its unique atmosphere of friendliness, and its great repertoire of modern music, jazz, rock 'n' roll and reggae. The Kara Mara, on the Bole Road, serves national food and drinks, accompanied by traditional folk music. There is a midnight curfew in effect throughout the country. If you go to a night-spot outside your hotel and stay past midnight, you are expected to remain there until 5 a.m.



§125§
Pharmacies and Pharmaceuticals
Medicines produced by the Ethiopian Pharmaceuticals Manufacturing Company are available in many pharmacies all over the country. Distribution of medicines is handled by the Pharmaceutical Marketing Corporation which acts as a wholesaler to the pharmacies. There is a scarcity of imported medicines, so if you are under medication it is wise to bring sufficient supplies with you to last you through your stay in Ethiopia. Bring also malaria tablets, other travel medicines, toothpaste and personal cosmetics as all these will be cheaper if bought in Europe or America than in Ethiopia.
Some pharmacies in Addis Ababa:
Anbessa Pharmacy, Gandhi Street. Telephone 11.18.93 Ghion Pharmacy, near Ghion Hotel. Telephone 44.86.06 Hilsen Pharmacy, Revolution Square. Telephone 44.65.55 International Pharmacy, Ras Damtew Avenue. Telephone 15.38.23 London Pharmacy, Piazza. Telephone 11.14.02 Nalbandian Pharmacy, Bole Road. Telephone 15.64.68



§126§
Photography
Most kinds of photographic equipment and films are available only in the duty-free shops in Ethiopia. Visitors are advised to arrive with their own supplies. Professionals (journalists and travel writers, researchers, etc.) need explicit photographic permits obtained from the Ministry of Information and National Guidance. The ordinary tourist does not need such a permit, but it is necessary to proceed with discretion. You should avoid taking photographs of military establishments and strategic installations (and bridges are considered such), and certain Government buildings and Party Headquarters. Do also remember that many local people, especially those of the lowlands, are not used to being photographed, and it is possible to arouse their hostility by attempting to take pictures of even their cattle or homes. Moslem women, in particular, have a strong religious objection to being photographed. And it is only common sense to be courteous and show reverence in churches and at religious festivals.



§127§
Places of Worship
Most Ethiopians belong to the Ethiopian Orthodox Church or are fol lowers of Islam. Churches and mosques are found throughout the country. On non-fasting days (every Wednesday and Friday being among the 239 fasting days) Orthodox Church services start very early, at 5 a.m. Moslems observe the five daily hours of sa/at (prayer) and in Addis Ababa jummah is observed at the big Anwar Mosque, Friday at 1 p.m. The big, modern Trinity Cathedral at Arat Kilo, behind the Old Parliament building, is a good place for attending Orthodox services. Ecumenical services are also occasionally held there.
I n Addis Ababa and Asmara there are places of worship to accommodate most religious creeds.
Armenian Orthodox: St. George Church, on Adua Avenue, near Ras Mekonnen Bridge Greek Orthodox: St. Frumeritius Church, on Adua Avenue, at the Piazza Synagogue. Shalom Shelemy, in Benin Sefer, near Abuna Petros Square Protestant: Bethel Church (Presbyterian), on Patriots' Street; German Congregation of Evangelical Christians, on Omedla Street, at Jan Hoy Meda, near Sidist Kilo; International Lutheran Church, behind Mitchell Cotts, near Mexico Square; St. Matthew Anglican (Church of England), on the Dessie Road near the YMCA; Seventh Day Adventist Mission, on Ras Damtew Avenue opposite the Gandhi Memorial Hospital; Sudan Interior Mission Chapel, opposite the north entrance of Black Lion Hospital. Roman Catholic: Catholic Cathedral, off Wavel Street, south of the Piazza; Church of the Holy Saviour, on Churchill Road, below the Ras Hotel; St. Gabriel, on Patriots' Street, near Ras Desta Hospital; St. Mary, between the English School and Menilek II Hospital.



§128§
Planning Your Budget
Because the tourism industry is still in its infancy, the choices for the lowbudget traveller are somewhat limited. As a result some tourists, used to travel conditions in Europe or America, may feel that prices are high in Ethiopia. But in comparison toother African countries, the cost of living is in fact quite low. For example, while on a par with other Hiltons in all respects, the Addis Ababa Hilton is one of the cheapest in the world. A single room costs from $40 to $80; while doubles and suites range between $70 and $100. A continental breakfast in the Hilton costs around $4, lunches start as low as $1 2.50 and dinner with a bottle of wine may come to only $22. At other restaurants (for example the Lalibela, near the Stadium), an excellent three-course table d'hote lunch costs as little as $3. Local wines (surprisingly good) can generally be purchased for around $5 a bottle, while beer costs $1 .25 in most bars and usually no more than $2 in nightclubs. Business visitors to Ethiopia, staying in a first-class hotel and making frequent use of taxis, photocopying and other services, should budget an
absolute minimum of $100 per day for the duration of their stay — an amount that will have to be increased if large numbers of international telephone calls are to be made. Most hotels apply weighty surcharges to the cost of international telex and telephone calls and it is often cheaper all round to reverse the charges



§129§
Public Holidays
Ethiopia's Sabbath is Sunday. For purposes of observing religious ceremonies and celebration; the Ethiopian Orthodox Church and Ethiopian Islam have many holy days throughout the year, and every church has at least one feast day a month.
The following are national public holidays:
7 January — Ethiopian Christmas {Gena)
19 January — Ethiopian Epiphany {Timket)
2 March — Adwa Day
6 March — Victory Day
1 May — International Labour Day
6 May — Ethiopian Good Friday
8 May — Ethiopian Easter [Fasika)
— Id al Fitr [Ramadan)
11 September — Ethiopian New Year's Day [Engutatash)
12 September — Popular Revolution Day
27 September — The Finding of the True Cross [Maskal)
- Id al Adha (Arafa)
1MB. Ethiopian Easter(like European Easter) and the Moslem holidays are based on the lunar calendar and their dates vary from year to year.
Office hours of Government establishments, and of most private "companies, are from 8 a.m. to 12 noon and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., except on Saturdays, when offices are open only in the morning. Ethiopian Airline's administrative offices (not ticket offices) are an exception to this rule, working from 7.30 a.m. to 4. 30 p.m. Monday to Friday, with Saturday off.



§130§ Opposite: Vendors come on board to sell refreshments to passengers on the Addis AbabaDjibouti railway.
Radio, Television and Newspapers
Foreign newspapers and periodicals are not generally available. The Ministry of Information and National Guidance publishes the Englishlanguage daily, the Ethiopian Herald (except on Mondays), the Arabiclanguage weekly, Al-Alem, and the quarterly magazine, published in
Amharic, Yekatit There is also a political quarterly, Meskerem, published
by COPWE.
Radio Ethiopia has broadcasts each evening in Arabic (5 p.m. to 6 p.m.), English (6 p.m. to 7 p.m.), and French (8 p.m. to 9 p.m.). Television broadcasts are from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a daily newscast in English at about 9.1 5 p.m. The daily newspapers publish the evening's television programmes.
Rail
There are two isolated rail lines in Ethiopia, with a total length of 1,102 kilometres. The 11 7-kilometres-long Massawa-Asmara railway was started in 1887 and reached its farthest western point of Agordat in 1928 This is a short line but if is remarkable because of the spectacular terrain through which it passes. The railway makes its way from the port of Massawa up the escarpment to Asmara, disappearing through 30 tunnels, crossing 60 bridges and climbing 2,300 metres. A large proportion of Ethiopia's import-export trade is carried over the 782-kilometre-long Addis Ababa-Djibouti railroad. The line runs through the Awash National Park and across the Rift Valley, traversing the lands of the Afar and Kotu peoples. A train ride from Addis is thus certainly worthwhile if one can bear a day-long ride with few modern conveniences. A multi-million-dollar modernisation of this line is soon to be implemented. There are both morning and night trains from both Cities, and the journey takes at least 10 hours. One-way fares are approximately. First Class US$24; Second Class US$15; Third Class US$7.

§132§
Restaurants
In hotels such as the Hilton and the Ghion the menus are of international standard. But Addis Ababa also has a number of good restaurants serving Chinese, Italian, French, Indian and Middle Eastern food. For Chinese food there are the Hong Kong and the China Bar restaurants; Castelli's and the Villa Verde serve Italian cuisine, and the Omar Khayam and Sangam offer Middle Eastern and Indian menus respectively. Other good restaurants include the Lalibela, the Cottage, the Kokeb and the Ras Grill. Ethiopia's main dish is called wot, which may be meat or vegetables
cooked in a hot, spicy sauce. This is eaten with — and traditionally upon
— a flat, spongy bread called injera. While chicken {doro) wot is probably the single most typical Ethiopian dish, a full meal will generally consist of a number of different dishes. The Ghion Hotel serves excellent Ethiopian food, and there are other restaurants in the city such as the Addis Ababa, the Finf ine Aderash, or the Kara Mara, where Ethiopian food may be had in the grand manner, accompanied by traditional folk music. More simple Ethiopian meals may be purchased very cheaply at bars and small local restaurants in allVarts of the country.
Tipping
In all Government hotels and restaurants a service charge of 10 per cent is added to the bill, so tipping is not necessary. In general, tipping is not customary in Ethiopia, although a tip will be gratefully received.



Overleaf: View of the twisting, §133§ precipitous road between Dessie and Kombolcha.
Roads
Northern Ethiopia has probably the best highway system in East Africa.
Some of these roads — for example the route between Addis Ababa and Dessie, and the Asmara-Massawa highway, are engineering marvels, climbing and descending precipitous gradients through tunnels and hairpin bends, and offer dramatic scenery and panoramic views. In the south,
the Maji road into the Omo basin, currently under construction, is likely to be equally remarkable. The new Moyale highway connecting Addis Ababa with Nairobi is completed on the Ethiopian side. Dry weather roads link Addis Ababa also with Djibouti, Khartoum and Hargeisa, in Somalia. The proposed Gaborone to Cairo highway could be routed through Metema (Gondar), Bahar Dar, Addis Ababa, south through Awasa to Moyale and on to Nairobi. All Ethiopian regional capitals are connected by road to Addis Ababa. A total of 1 2,406 kilometres of all-weather roads branch out from the hub of the country to remote and far-flung regions. Of these, 3,986 kilometres are fully asphalted, the remainder having good gravel surfaces. There are 3,392 kilometres of rural roads. The fastest road in the country, the 835-kilometre-long highway from Assab to Addis Ababa, was completed in 1973. Buses leave daily from Addis Ababa to all the regional capitals and major towns; and all rural points with roads are serviced by buses and micro-buses. Fares are control led, and they average 0.02 Birr per kilometre on the large buses and 0.04 Birr per kilometre on the micro-buses.

Shipping Services, Boats and Ports
Ambatch boats, which resemble those depicted in ancient Egyptian tomb murals (built of peeled logs lashed together with bark) are the glory of some of the Rift Valley lakes and are said to be the most handsome still in use anywhere in Africa. Then there are the tankwas made of papyrus of Lake Tana, and the hollowed-out tree trunk canoes seen on the Baro
and Omo rivers of the south-west. Taking a ride on these simple craft is a memorable experience. There are also modern motorboats available at some of these lakes and rivers, operated by the Maritime and Transit Services Corporation (MTSC). Ethiopia has more than 800 kilometres of coastline along the Red Sea
and two ancient and historically rich — and now fast-growing — ports, Assab and Massawa. Ethiopian Shipping Lines provides regular maritime links with other ports on the Red Sea, and in the Mediterranean and Atlantic, such as Aden, Djibouti, Jidda, Genoa, Marseilles, Barcelona and Rotterdam. Ethiopian Shipping Lines has a substantial commercial fleet oriented towards v cargo; there are no passenger-only vessels.

§137§
Shopping
Shopping in Ethiopia can be an exciting activity — if, that is, you are not intimidated by the age-old custom and art of bargaining. Everyone has their own style and approach to a bargaining market; some use simple rules like offering half (or some other fraction) of the price quoted, or pretending not to like prospective purchases in order to elicit a more reasonable price. Another way is simply to decide how much you are willing to pay for an item and make that your counter-offer. However, you should not then feel that you have been cheated if the item you are after is readily delivered to you at that price. Shopping in the Mercato, Africa's largest open-air market, is fun, and attractive bargains are plentiful. Here you will find the colourful basketwork and silver filigree of Harar, the three-legged stools of Jimma, the hand-made wool carpets of Debre Birhan, the crosses of Gondar, along with the pottery, wood carving, embroidered cloth, parchments and jewellery of all the different regions of Ethiopia. If you prefer to shop at a place where all the handicrafts are displayed under one roof, and the prices are fixed, then take your shopping list along to the Ethiopian Tourist Trading Corporation. The ETTC boasts the largest duty-free shop on the continent, which stocks everything from carpets to cameras, and watches to handbags. It covers an area of over half a square kilometre, and here duty-free goods can be purchased both on arrival in Ethiopia and on departure. In the same complex as the DutyFree Shop are the ETTC studios and workshops. Here local craftsmen and artists produce furniture and artifacts for the tourist market using traditional materials, methods and designs. Hand-carved tables and chairs, hand-painted lampshades of genuine parchment, hand-woven wall hangings, silk-screened T-shirts and costume dolls are only a few items from their wide selection. The main ETTC complex is adjacent to Bole I nternational Airport, but there are small stores at all the main hotels. The ETTC shop at De Gaulle Square in the centre of town deals with exotic and precious items of silver, gold and modern ceramics. 'Dill Gebeya' at the old airport on the Jimma road is a modern ETTC supermarket. Animal products such as skins, and antiques deemed to be relics, require export clearance. The Wildlife Conservation Authority and the Antiquities Authority will provide this. The Ethio-Craft Rehabilitation Centre on the Dessie Road, and the

§141§
Telecommunications and the Postal Service
The Sululta satellite earth station, linked to the INTELSAT Atlantic Ocean satellite in 1974, has boosted Ethiopia's modern telecommunications capacity, with the result that direct telephone links are now enjoyed with 20 countries. Nationally, trunk dialling sytems exist between Addis Ababa and Asmara, Assab, Awasa, Bahar Dar, Debre Zeit, Dessie, Dire Dawa, Gondar, Harar, Jimma, Makale, Massawa and Shashamene. Telegram offices in Addis Ababa are open around the clock. There are telex facilities at the Hilton and bigger hotels and telephone facilities for the press at the Telecommunications Centre near the Ras Hotel. The price for a three-minute telephone call to Europe is about $1 5, plus $5 per each additional minute; to the USA it is approximately $20, plus $7 per each extra minute; and calls to Africa and the Middle East will cost about $1 2, plus $4 per extra minute. A telephone call within Addis Ababa costs 0.20 Birr. The postage rate to Africa is: 0.75 Birr for letters, 0.55 for a postcard, 0.40 for printed.matter and 0.50 for aerogrammes. The postage rate to Europe, the Near East and the Middle East is: 0.85 for letters, 0.60 for postcards, 0.45 for printed matter and 0.50 for an aerogramme. The postage rate to the USA, the Far East, Canada and Australia is: 1 .10 Birr for letters, 0.75 for postcards, 0.55 for printed matter and 0.50 for an aerogramme. These rates are for letters up to 10 grams. Above this, the rates vary according to weight.
Time
GMT + 3. This is true but misleading since Ethiopia not only has its own calendar of 1 3 months, but it also reckons the hours of the day differently. You must keep this in mind when making or accepting appointments. When an Ethiopian says he will meetyou at eight, he may mean at 2 p.m. Ethiopian time goes by 12-hour cycles of day and night. One cycle starts with 'one' at 7 a.m. and goes on to 'twelve', which is 6 p.m.; another cycle starts at 7 p.m. ('one' again) and goes through to 6 a.m. ('twelve'). And while in Ethiopia, where the Julian calendar is in force, remember that you are seven years, eight months and at least a week younger, always. So that
midday, Sunday 12 June1983 is only — by their reckoning — 6 o'clock, Sunday 5 June 1975. In Addis Ababa the telephone number for checking your watch or finding out the local time is 902.

What to Wear
In lowland areas the lightest possible cotton clothing, with a hat and sunglasses, is all that is required: In Addis Ababa and throughout the highlands, where the climate is more like that of spring in the Mediterranean, or a good early summer in northern Europe, light to medium-weightclothing is appropriate. During the rainy season, from June through September, an umbrella or raincoat is essential and a sweater should also be packed as the evenings can be quite chilly.
Ethiopians tend to be fairly formal and conservative in their dress suits and ties being standard in Government and business offices. It is necessary to remove one's shoes when entering churches and mosques and it is wise to bring along a pair of thick socks to wear as protection against splinters.



Gains of the Ethiopian Revolution
Ethiopia's history extends back to ancient times — indeed to the very dawn of human development. It is the cradle of mankind where the oldest man-like skeleton, 3.5 million-year-old Dinqinesh, or 'Lucy' as it is known to the rest of the world, was found in 1974 in the eastern part of the country. Always regarded as a land of mystery and enchantment, Ethiopia had a special fascination to the Romans and the Greeks. There were ancient trade and cultural links with Pharaonic Egypt, India, China and Mesopotamia, reinforced by exports of such exotic goods as gold, ivory and myrrh. Today, Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa, is the headquarters of the Organisation of African Unity and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, as well as being host to many other regional and international offices, thus retaining its age-old tradition of world-wide contacts. The last 1 3 years, however, have seen one of the most far-reaching changes in Ethiopia's history, a change that began with the popular Revolution of 1 974

a Revolution that has brought about a radical transformation of the country's political and socio-economic structure, that has guaranteed the rights of all Ethiopians to a fair and equal share in the nation's resources and productivity, and that has spread the benefits of education, literacy and social welfare to all sections of the population. No understanding of Ethiopia can thus be complete without an insight into the conditions that gave rise to the Revolution, and into the profound changes that have taken place in Ethiopian society in recent years. In this essay, we give a brief history of the background to the Revolution and we review some of its most significant achievements during the period 1974-1986. Prior to the Revolution of September 1 974, Ethiopia's economic and social system was based on feudalism and the exploitation of the majority by the few. The peasantry, constituting over 85 per cent of the population, lived under one of the cruellest land tenure systems in history. The best part of the country's arable land was the personal property of the emperor, Haile Selassie, members of his family and a few privileged aristocrats and feudal lords. The rest was distributed amongst highly placed bureaucrats and clerical functionaries, as well as a few senior military officers and favoured merchants. Selassie's rule, however, became increasingly oppressive, anachronistic and unpopular. Not only were most of the landlords highly-placed office bearers in the government, but their right to acquire up to 75 per cent of the produce of their tenants was protected by law. In addition to such merciless economic exploitation, the tenant and members of his household were also obliged to render free physical labour to the landlords. With the establishment of a handful of manufacturing industries in some urban centres, and the commercial farms that began mushrooming during the

1 960s, the workers who, as former peasants, had run away from rural exploita
tion, found themselves in the hands of an even more cruel exploiter — the feudo-bourgeois factory owner. The feudal methods of exploitation were refinedly blended with modern capitalist techniques of profit maximisation making urban exploitation all the more unbearable. Illiteracy in Ethiopia at this time claimed more than 93 per cent of the population, and, of the school-age children, only 1 9 per cent attended schools. In the field of health services, the situation was equally grim. The overwhelming majority of the people lived outside the reach of modern medical facilities which were located mainly in urban areas. This already ugly and unbearable situation in feudal Ethiopia, was further
exacerbated by tragic and recurrent famines — about which absolutely nothing was done. Between 1 957 and 1 974 alone, three droughts claimed the lives of a million people, mainly in the northern regions of Ethiopia. The already prevalent discontent and anger among the students, the workers, the peasantry, the military, the urban middle class and the population as a whole erupted into one of most decisive and radical popular revolutions in modern history. With the mandate of the people, the leaders of the Revolution, the Provisional Military Administrative Council (PMAC), deposed Haile Selassie on 1
2
September 1974 and set about in earnest the task of demolishing the feudal order which was the root cause of the age-old suffering of the Ethiopian people. As first steps the major means of production and distribution were nationalised. Big industries, large commercial farms, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions were placed directly under Government control. Perhaps the most important and far-reaching of these early Revolutionary measures was Ethiopia's sweeping land reform programme. All land was nationalised at a stroke, with private holdings being limited to ten hectares. This effectively did away with landlords and the entire feudal system and ensured that the nation's wealth was fairly shared.



To date, some 5.5 million farming families have been organised under farmers' associations and around 4.5 million people have become members of 3,913 service cooperatives throughout the 14 administrative regions of the country. One of the main functions of the service cooperatives is the distribution of agricultural inputs, arrangement of credit facilities and the marketing of members' produce. They also serve as vehicles for the development of rural industry and training. This peasant organisational structure has been followed by a still higher
form of cooperative — the producers' cooperative. Under this system farmers pool their resources to work together. Some 1,500 producers' cooperatives have so far been formed. Parallel to the land reform programme, urban reform was instituted limiting home ownership to one house per family. This had many positive effects, particularly in over-crowded cities like Addis Ababa where the shortage of accommodation for the poor had traditionally been a severe problem. All urban land and all rentable houses and flats were nationalised; as in the countryside, the
expropriated property was administered by associations — in this case Urban Dwellers' Associations. Similar to other mass organisations, Urban Dwellers' Associations (UDAs) are run by people elected by the assembly of the masses through secret ballot. The kebele, the lowest unit in the structure of the UDAs, is an important democratic forum where all the city dwellers in their respective areas meet, discuss and decide on all matters which affect them. Through the kebeles' higher and central organs the masses engage in various political and socio-economic activities and participate in programmes of urban development, establishment of people's shops, cottage industries and other cooperatives. They also encourage urban dwellers to organise themselves and build their own houses and participate in the campaign to eradicate illiteracy. Peasant Associations and Urban Dwellers' Associations are themselves part of a wider forum of Ethiopian mass organisations which have given coherence and momentum to the Revolutionary struggle and to the aspirations of the people. Other mass organisations include the Ethiopian Trade Union (ETU), the Revolutionary Ethiopian Women's Association (REVVA), the Revolutionary Ethiopian Youth Association (REYA) and various professional associations encompassing teachers, journalists, artists, writers, musicians and medical personnel amongst others. The Revolution has also registered a number of conspicuous achievements in social development. A mass literacy programme was launched in 1979 to inculcate literacy and spread new political ideas. It reduced the number of illiterate adults from the staggering figure of 93 per cent before the Revolution to less than 38 per cent today through the setting up of more than 300 literacy centres throughout the



country. Tangible recognition of this remarkable achievement came with the bestowal of a major UNESCO award for the national effort in the field of literacy. Adult training centres with around 284,000 students are expanding to provide post literacy and vocational training for the new literates, as are night schools with an enrolment in excess of 260,000 students. In 1974 the total enrolment of school children in the country in grades one to six was 9 per cent. Today this figure has surpassed 50 per cent and the number of kindergartens in the country over the same period has jumped from a little over 70 to 700. Health services represent another area in which gratifying results have been .achieved. The nationwide provision of medical services has grown from a bare 15 per cent before the Revolution to nearly 50 per cent now due to the numerous measures taken by the Government and supplemented by popular participation in self-help. Health-service delivery and manpower training institutions, as well as the numbers of trained personnel, have almost doubled since the Revolution. In the first 10 years of the Revolution the number of clinics in the country grew from 650 to over 1,850, health centres from 93 to over 130 and health personnel from 6,472 to well over 17,000. Progress in the political sphere, through the raised consciousness of the people, and through Party formation, has also been an important aspect of the new order being forged in Revolutionary Ethiopia. It should not be forgotten that Ethiopia launched its Revolution, deposed its tyrannical and repressive monarch and abolished the feudo-bourgeois system
without — initially at least — the benefit of having a vanguard Marxist-Leninist party. The indispensibility of such a vanguard party was, however, always apparent to Ethiopia's revolutionaries. A few years after, forged in the flames of the practice of the Revolution itself, agreement was reached for the creation of a centre for assembling genuine revolutionaries. The Commission for Organising the Party of the Working People of Ethiopia (COPWE) was thus established on 18 December 1979 with Comrade Mengistu Haile Mariam as its Chairman. COPWE's organisational structure was identical to any fully-fledged Marxist-Leninist party. Although its mission was in the main to help expedite the formation of the vanguard party and to disseminate Marxist-Leninist ideology among the masses, it also acted as a vanguard party until it was replaced by the Party itself. COPWE provided the organisational unity capable overeating ideological and practical unity among revolutionaries, and furnished its members with adequate theoretical and practical experience to launch their historic responsibilities as Party functionaries. Having made this decisive contribution towards the realisation of the Party,
COPWE ceased to exist and the Workers' Party of Ethiopia (WPE) came into



being on 1 2 September 1 984. This was an historic occasion not only for Ethiopian revolutionaries who have struggled selflessly to build a truly vanguard party to guarantee the success of the Revolution, but also for the international revolutionary movement that struggles for the growth and consolidation of popular power and socialist construction everywhere. Part and parcel of the struggle for national reconstruction has been Ethiopia's ability to defend itself, and its popular Revolution, both from internal
and from external enemies — who at several times have engaged in acts of sabotage and open military attack aimed at arresting the country's progress. The most desperate offensive came in 1977-78, when the country faced attack on several fronts mounted both by internal and external enemies, coordinated and financed by international imperialism and reaction. As the Ethiopian Head of State Comrade Mengistu Haile Mariam aptly described the situation then, the whole country was turned into "a huge theatre of war." What the enemies failed to realise, however, was the fact that the Ethiopian people were as resolutely determined then as they have always been in the past to defend and safeguard their country. When Ctpmrade Mengistu made his historic "call of the Motherland" on 12 April 1978, telling his people that the fate of the country and the Revolution were in jeopardy, the response was immediate and decisive. In a matter of less than three months, Revolutionary Ethiopia was able to recruit, train and field over 300,000 militia who, alongside the experienced veteran armed forces of the country, vanquished the enemy at all fronts. This unique historic undertaking not only enabled Ethiopia to safeguard its territorial integrity and its hard-won Revolution, but it also made a gigantic contribution towards the creation of a people's army which to this day stands dedicated to the country and the Revolution. In tandem with all the measures, efforts and achievements described above, an imaginative and well planned economic development programme has been one of the central features of the Ethiopian Revolution. In April 1976, the National Revolutionary Development Campaign was
declared and the Central Planning Supreme Council was set up — the objectives of these measures being to ensure the control and consolidation of the gains of the Revolution, to place the national economy under central planning, and to maximise national productivity. Subsequently, starting in 1978, six annual development campaigns were launched with the following objectives: to rebuild the war-damaged national economy; to increase the production of basic consumer goods and services and improve their distribution; to alleviate acute shortages of foreign exchange; to ameliorate socio-economic problems such as unemployment and prostitution; and to lay down the infrastructure for the building of a socialist economy. The annual campaign programmes proved effective in mitigating urgent economic and social problems but, because they could not transform the structure of the economy, the Ten-Year Perspective Plan (1 984/85 - 1 994/95)

was launched. It is being implemented through three sub-plans with time spans of two, three and five years. The major objectives of the Perspective Plan are to increase production, raise the standard of living, build an independent economy, develop hitherto unexploited natural resources, upgrade the educational and professional standards of the people, foster the development of science and technology and gradually eliminate unemployment. The agricultural sector, as the mainstay of the economy, has been given due attention, especially in view of the serious food shortages caused by the recurrent problem of drought. The establishment of State farms is also another significant step in the national effort to enhance and strengthen the agricultural sector of the economy. The State farms, which are now, together with producers' cooperatives, responsible for generating 5 per cent of the total national agricultural product, have become very useful and exemplary enterprises in promoting collective farming by showing peasants the advantage of collectively using machinery and social labour. With respect to industrialisation, the national policy envisages the construction of light, medium and heavy industries as paramount objectives that must, nevertheless, go side-by-side with agricultural development in the economic construction of the country. For quite a lengthy period after the Revolution, the Government had to be engaged in a major reconstruction effort of repairing, rebuilding or replacing many of the industrial establishments destroyed or damaged by secessionists and counter-revolutionaries in the course of the Revolutionary struggle. At the same time, several notable new industrial ventures have been established. Most significant of these are the Mugar and Dire Dawa cement factories, the Kombolcha textile factory, the tractor assembly plant in Nazareth and the farm implements and leather factories established in several regions. In addition, the Melka Wakena and the Gibe hydro-electric stations which are under construction will further boost the industrial output of the country. These endeavours will obviously contribute to the boosting of the national economy as well as enhancing the growth of the working class in Ethiopia. On the basis of all that has been achieved so far, Ethiopians are thus delighted and proud at the imminent prospect of the fulfilment of perhaps the
fundamental objective of the Revolution — the establishment of the People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. The constitution of the PDRE was adopted in early 1 987 after a nationwide referendum that itself followed a lengthy process of discussion and enrichment of the draft constitution by the entire populace. Indeed, in Ethiopia today, there is no area of activity that is planned and executed without the participation of the people through their democratically-elected representatives. Nothing can demonstrate better the Revolution's commitment to make the people masters of their own destiny than this very proof.
