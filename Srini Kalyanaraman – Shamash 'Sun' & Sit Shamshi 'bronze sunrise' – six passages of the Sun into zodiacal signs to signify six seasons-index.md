# Index for Srini Kalyanaraman – Shamash 'Sun' & Sit Shamshi 'bronze sunrise' – six passages of the Sun into zodiacal signs to signify six seasons.pdf

Shamash 'Sun' & Sit Shamshi 'bronze sunrise' derive from
षष् + अशीतिमुख, six passages of the Sun into zodiacal
signs to signify six seasons
The objective of this monograph is to demonstrate that Shamash 'Sun divinity' (ANE) is derived from Suryasiddhanta reference to ष़ डशीतिमुख, six passages of the Sun into zodiacal seasons to signify six seasons
This is an addendum to: Shamash, sun divinity of ANE 3rd m. BCE is derived from six seasons linked to Sun's passage into 6 zodiacal signs https://tinyurl.com/yxfccy5o
RV 1.28.5 refers to Vedamãso; Sāyaṇa interprets this as a reference to the 13th intercalary month to fuse the solar and lunar calendars. The word -मास 'a month or the 12th part of the Hindu year
(there are 4 kinds of months , viz. the solar , सौर ; the natural , सावन ; the stellar , नाक्षत्र , and the
lunar , चा*न्द्र ; the latter , which is the most usual and consists of 30 तितिs , being itself of two kinds as reckoned from the new or full moon cf. IW. 179 ; for the names of the months » ib. 173 n. 3) RV. &c (मासम् , for a month ; मासम् एकम् , for one month ; मासेन , in the course of a month
; मासे , in a month = after the lapse of a month)'(Monier-Willisms)
मास is thus a Vedic word which refers to a calendrical tradition. It is suggested that the
expression Shamash in ANE as a reference to Sun Divinity is derived from षष् + मास = Shamash
'Six months'. In this expression, षष् is relatable to the Suryasiddhanta reference षड्-शीति-मुख the passage of the sun into zodial signs to signify the six seasons. https://tinyurl.com/yxfccy5o

I think the key is to understand the significance of the expressions षडशीतिमुखं and षडशीि्. in: िुलादे: षडशींत्यशै : षडशीतिमुखं तदनं भचिुर्ष्टमेवं स्याद तिस्वभावेषु रातशषु and identifying cardinal solar points of the solar calendar which define the six seasons. aśītiḥ अशीतिुः f.

There is also a pun on the word अशीतिुः | अशीि signifies numeral 86 and
also aśīta अशीि a. 1 Not cold, hot. -2 The eightieth. -Comp. -करुः , -रश्मुः &c. the sun.
Thus, अशीतिमुख is a metaphor for the Sun and the semantic expansion in the expression षष् +
अशीतिमुख signifies the Sun which is the creator of six seasons in the annual calendar. षष् +
अशीतिमुख gets the cognate Shamash in Ancient Near East venerated as the Sun Divinity (who is

I found this enote of elucidation by W.. Brennand, in reference to अशीि " the eightieth
" » अवायग्-शीि्/अ (Monier-Williams), i.e. the 86 days count specified by सूयर्तसद्धान्त :
[quote]The Solar Mana is that by which are determined the lengths of day and night, the Shadasiti-Mukhas, the solstitial and equinoctial times and the holy days of Sankranti on which good actions bring good desert to the performer. Verses from (4) to (6) relate to a peculiar division of time consisting of successive periods of 86 solar days beginning from the time when the sun enters the sign of Libra; the 86th day of each period is called Shadasiti-Mukha, and there are four such days in the year, the first happens when the sun is at 26 of Sagittarius, the second when he reaches 22 Pisces, the third when he is at 18 Gemini, and the fourth at 14 Virgo. The remaining 16 Saura days or degrees of the Saura month, when the sun is in Virgo are sacred, good actions performed in those days confer great merit, equal to that of a sacrifice, a gift then in honour of deceased ancestors is imperishable. [unquote] (W. Brennand, 1896, Hindu Astronomy, Chas. Straker & Sons, Ltd., Bishopsgate Avenue, E.C., London.) https://archive.org/stream/hinduastronomy00brenuoft/hinduastronomy00brenuoft_djvu.txt
Shadasheeti divides solar year षडशीतिमुखं 86 days four times every year (86X4 = 344 +16 days) which overlaps the six-fold division of seasons of a year (6 X 60). This is a fusion of seasonal calendar with the solar calendar. This reinforces Suryasiddhanta as the basis for षष् > Shamash 'Sun divinity' of ANE.
An intercalary month mentioned in the Rig Veda {Vedamãso dhrutavrato dvãdasha prajãvatah; vedã ya upajãyate. (I/25:8)} is a fusion of solar calendar, seasonal calendar and lunar calendar. Now we know that Surya siddhanta gave the name in 3rd of 4th millennium BCE to Shamash as

I am grateful to Dr. Jayasree Saranathan for the brilliant insights she has provided into the tradition releated to time-reckoning of ष़ डशीतिमुख or passages of the sun into zodiacal signs.
ष़ डशीतिुः means numeral '86'. How does this reconcile with four seasons and six seasons in variant calendrical reckonings of ancient times?
"The 12 zodiacal signs are categorised as Chara (moving), Sthira (fixed) and Ubhaya (common / both chara and sthira). Sun's entry in Chara rashi marks Vishu, in Sthira marks Vishnupadi and in Ubhaya marks Shadasheeti. All the entry days are meant for yajna, tarpan etc....Like many concepts that were lost with time, the practice of spiritual shadana associated with Ubhaya rashi kaala was also lost and therefore substituted with a standard time identified with the first day of sun's entry into the Ubhaya rashis. Now we identify Shadasheeti with the day of solar sankramana in 4 Ubhaya rashis. Since meditation on Shadangan is best in these months. Shadasheeti Punyakala is best remembered as the day of Shadangan. The concept is derived from Shadangan, the name of Shiva as one having 6 limbs. Meditation on the 6 limbs of Shiva was meant in Tantric sadhanas. Shadasheeti also means 'bound by six' or 'fastened to six'. Since the word also means 86, it is probable that number 86 was chosen. Shadasheeti is thus basically a time identified for certain spiritual sadhanas and as such they are not clubbed along with physical division of the zodiac in astrology. This appears in Muhurtha astrology for identifying best time for sadhana related to Shiva. Munda people have the habit of doing Karam Puja on Shadasheeti days."

Seasons within the Hindu calendar
It is even more interesting, how the solar year was classified on the basis of seasons. The 12 lunar months of a solar year are divided into six ritus (seasons), each comprising of approximately two months. Since the seasons are solar based, each of the six seasons — Sharad (late monsoon), Hemant (early winter), Shishir (winter), Vasant (spring), Grishma
(summer) and Varsha (monsoon)- commence around the 21st date (±2) of each even month of the Western calendar.

The Hindu calendar recognizes the importance of the summer solstice and winter solstice in a solar year, determining the six seasons. The Dakshinayana or the sun’s southern course starts from June 21 till December 21, during which the day-length is successively getting shorter until it is the shortest in december. The Uttarayana or the sun’s northern course progresses from
December 21 until June 21, during which the day-length gets successively longer until it is the longest in June. Sun reaches the equinox twice in a year, during which the length of day and night are equal. The first point is Vernal Equinox in March 20(Vasant Sampaat). The other point is called Autumnal Equinox in September 22(Sharad Sampaat).
...When does the year start?
The start of the year varies from one region to another, predominantly based on the cultural as well as agricultural harvest season. In most regions, the year starts on the New Moon before the Sun enters the zodiac sign of Aries (Meṣa). This happens on or around the day of the March
equinox, which marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. It is during this time of the year that the grains have been harvested and the new season of sowing starts. It follows the spring equinox (Vasant Sampat) and generally falls on 14 April of the Gregorian year. The same date is observed as the traditional new year in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Manipur, Tripura, Bihar, Odisha, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan as well as in Nepal and Bangladesh. Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Sinhalese in Sri Lanka also celebrate the same day as their new year. [unquote]

Rtu /season is mentioned in the Rig Veda. Though seasons are mentioned in it Atharvaveda (655-2) and several Samhitas mention “Six Seasons”.
Valmiki in his Ramayana described Hemanta Rtu in Aranya kanda, Vasanta Rtu and Varsha rtu in Kishkinda Kanda.
Manu mentioned seasons in the verses: 1-30, 3-217, 4-26, 9-36 and 3-273. Kalidasa in his famous book on seasons Rtu Samharam (The Gathering of the Seasons) begins with summer season. It has got six sections, one each for a season. It has 144 verses.
According to Taittiriya Samhita Vasanta Rtu is the first one. Krishna also says that he is Vasanta rtu among the seasons (Bhagavd Gita 10–35).
