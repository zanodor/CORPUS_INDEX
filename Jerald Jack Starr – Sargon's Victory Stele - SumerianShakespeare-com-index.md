Who is the defeated enemy on Sargon's Victory Stele?
Sargon lived in the mid 24th century BC. He seized the throne of Ur
Zababa, the king of Kish, and went on to conquer all of Akkad. He
conquered Sumer in 2350 B.C. and later conquered the rest of
Mesopotamia, thus creating one of the first empires in history.
The empire lasted for almost two centuries.
For a number of reasons there has been very little speculation about the
identity of the defeated enemy that is portrayed on Sargon's Victory
Stele. First of all, it is heavily damaged, so there are just a few images of
the enemy remaining on stele. Second, the enemy prisoners are naked, so
they can't be identified by their clothing. Third, and perhaps most
important, Sargon had a lot of enemies, so it's difficult to pick just one.
I would like to propose a new theory, one that is suggested by the stele
itself.
Part of Sargon's Victory Stele (Louvre). The pictures on this page are
from three fragments. The fragments are parts of two similar steles
celebrating the victories of the Akkadian king.

Sargon leads the victory procession. He carries a mace. The man
behind him holds a parasol to shade Sargon from the sun and to symbolize
his high rank. The other men carry battleaxes. The drawings on this page
are by Lorenzo Nigro.
Prisoners are bound and placed into neck stocks . . .
. . . while vultures and war dogs feed on the dead. The vulture on
the right carries off a human leg. The scene is a grim reminder to everyone
that resistance to Sargon is futile.
For the purpose of this discussion, I'll concentrate on the two fragments
below that depict the bound prisoners (Louvre Sb 3) and
Sargon with the net (Louvre Sb 2). The other fragment (Louvre Sb 1) is
on the page Sargon's other Victory Stele.

Sargon holds a net full of prisoners. Using his mace, he bangs the
head of the prisoner who has long hair. The nationality of the prisoners in
the net wasn't known. To the right is the partial figure of a diety. It has
tentatively been identified as Inanna/Ishtar, the goddess of war,
but it is actually a male god. His fringed robe is typical of male attire, and
Sargon is standing right beside him wearing the same kind of robe. As can
be seen on an Akkadian cylinder seal of the same period,
the garment is unlike the flounced dress that is typically worn by Ishtar
and other goddesses. He is actually Ilaba (il-a-ba), a warrior god. Part of
his name is shown in the fragmentary inscription above Sargon's shoulder.
To the side of Ilaba is a mace with a curved handle. It's the same mace that
Sargon carries in the victory procession.

full of prisoners and he clubs one of them who is trying to
escape. Eannatum's stele also has an image of vultures feeding on the
enemy dead, for which it was named. It seems Sargon made a deliberate
effort to copy Eannatum's stele, which had been constructed about 70
years earlier. Eannatum's stele commemorates his victory over the
Sumerian city of Umma.
On Eannatum's stele, the net of prisoners is held by the war god Ningirsu.
Eannatum thus
attributes his victory to the gods. On Sargon's stele, he himself holds the
net of prisoners,
leaving no doubt about who won the victory. It also sends a subtle
propaganda message
that people should fear Sargon more than they fear the gods themselves.
Lorenzo Nigro, in his excellent article “The Two Steles of Sargon: The
Iconology and Visual Propaganda at the Beginning of Royal Akkadian
Relief”, has an interesting theory. He proposes that the vanquished
enemies on Sargon’s victory stele are Sumerians. This makes perfect sense
because Sargon’s victory over the Sumerians was a very important
milestone during his reign. It was the beginning of his empire. Nigro
proposes that the figure of the
long-haired man struggling to escape from the net is none other than
Lugalzagesi. He is the Sumerian king who led an army of fifty ensis
(rulers, governors) in the battle against Sargon.
Nigro also suggests that the man's long hair and beard are meant to
differentiate him from
the other prisoners. The loose hair means he had lost his royal bun while
fighting (unlike Sargon) and it symbolizes his loss of kingship. Nigro then
points out that the figure is drawn larger than the other prisoners, almost
as large as Sargon, in conformance with the ancient tradition of drawing
kings larger than other men. Therefore, if the captive enemies on the
victory stele are Sumerians and the long-haired man is their king, it can
only be Lugalzagesi, the leader of the Sumerian army. It’s a known fact
that Lugalzagesi was captured by Sargon after the battle.
It’s a persuasive argument, and I was reasonably convinced. I was about to
use it on a new webpage I was writing about Lugalzagesi. I knew Sargon
forced the captured Lugalzagesi to watch the construction of a stele

commemorating his own defeat, then executed him. I realized that it must
have been heartrending for Lugalzagesi, the former king of Umma, to see
a victory stele that exactly mirrored the victory stele of Eannatum. It
commemorated the humiliating defeat of Lugalzagesi’s Ummaite
forefathers with the same images of captured prisoners in a net and
vultures feeding on the dead. Now to see himself as the one in the net
and clubbed with a mace, foretelling his own death, must have been
completely devastating.
It’s a very compelling story, but something about the premise of the
story kept bothering me.
It was the hair. The hair bothered me.
Sargon profile. His long hair is knotted in a bun. Above his shoulder is a
damaged inscription that reads, "Sargon, king".
It all started about a month ago, when Trevor Eccles emailed me about
one of my webpages. I had stated that Sargon on his Victory Stele was
wearing the ceremonial helmet with a knotted bun in the back, the kind
worn by the King of Kish (see Helmet: King of Kish). Trevor wrote that he
wasn’t entirely convinced that it was actually a helmet; he thought it was
just Sargon’s hair, worn in a chignon. Trevor is an amateur Assyriologist
who lives in Paris, so he is very familiar with the Mesopotamian section at

the Louvre where the stele is kept. During our correspondence he made
several trips to the Louvre to take a close look at the stele. He still wasn’t
convinced that Sargon was wearing a helmet, so I deferred to his better
judgment and deleted the statement from my webpage. He also corrected
another error on this website, but we won't go into that now. Trevor also
sent me Nigro’s article about the victory stele, which has several pictures
that I had never seen before.
I was studying the article in preparation for the new web page about
Lugalzagesi. I had read the article several times before. Then I saw
footnote 14, which I had missed during my previous readings: “The hair
style [of the prisoners on Sargon’s stele] is comparable
with that of Sumerian soldiers carrying pieces of booty [in the victory
procession] on the lower register of the Standard of Ur, thus confirming
the south Mesopotamian provenance of the prisoners in the net.”
Southern Mesopotamia means Sumer, which is south of Akkad.
“Hmmm”, I thought to myself. In The Standard of Ur: King, I had already
identified the men in the victory procession. They aren’t Sumerian soldiers
carrying booty. They aren’t even the allies of the Sumerians bearing gifts
to celebrate the Sumerian victory. They're actually the defeated enemies,
bearing tribute to the conquering Sumerian king.
They are Akkadians.
This man in the victory procession on the Standard of Ur bears tribute to
the Sumerian king. He wears the distinctive angled-skirt of the Akkadians.

Note the hairstyle. His short hair can be seen beneath his headdress. All of
the defeated enemies in the victory procession have the same hairstyle.
The hair is curly and full on top but short on the sides. By contrast, all of
the Sumerians on the Standard of Ur have clean-shaven heads.
Some other examples of the enemy’s hairstyle are shown below:
A defeated enemy herds a ram that
is garlanded for the sacrifice during the victory celebration of the
Sumerian king.
The enemy on the War end panel of the Standard
of Ur.
Notice how this hairstyle matches that of the bound prisoner on Sargon's
victory stele.

So, to put it simply, the enemies defeated by the Akkadian king Sargon
were Akkadians.

angled-skirt. The irony of this picture is that the Akkadians are both the
victors and the vanquished.
All the prisoners in Ningirsu’s net on Eannatum’s Vulture Stele have
shaven heads.
That’s because they're Sumerians, from the city of Umma.

On the other hand, all of these captured enemies (except for one) in the
net held by Sargon have the Akkadian hairstyle. The hair is curly and
full on top but short on the sides, the same hairstyle worn by the
Akkadians on the Standard of Ur.

hair goes all the way down the back of the head, but the heads of the
prisoners in the net are shaven in the back. The explanation for this is
found in the Sumerian Lexicon. Kiši4...aka refers to the Akkadian practice
of shaving half the head as punishment or a sign of slavery ('forelock; half'
+ 'to do'; Akk., muttata gullubu(m) II). The prisoners have half of their
heads shaven to signify that they were on the losing side in the civil
war. This would distinguish them from the other Akkadians that were on
the winning side, who presumably still had all of their hair. I believe the
half-shaven head is a sign of punishment, not of slavery, because
Akkadians did not enslave their own countrymen, and because I agree
with Nigro’s assessment that Sargon intends to be merciful to his captives.
Proof that the prisoners in the net are Akkadian is seen in the way they are
portrayed. In the words of Nigro, "Thus captives in Sargon's net are not
represented as a heaped-up mound of corpses as in the Stele of Vultures,
but as regularly seated figures stretching their right hands to Sargon in a
gesture of submission." Nigro says, "the king does not want to
slay those enemies who are ready to accept his sovereignty" and that
Sargon's conquest brings order to the conquered people. It shows that he
doesn't want to kill his own subjects (foreign barbarians might not be so
lucky). As commoners, the prisoners in the net will be spared if they
accept Sargon as their ruler. The same cannot be said for the captive king.
Sargon's smiting him with a mace is symbolic of the act of killing him.
Now on to what was bugging me most about the hair. It was the long hair
of captive king. Sumerian kings in this period of history are never shown
with long hair. Gudea, Ur-Namma, and Eannatum, all have shaven
heads. That's why I had difficulty accepting the premise that the long
haired man was Lugalzagesi. There must be another reason for the long
hair of the captive king, other than the fact that his loosened hair
symbolizes his loss of kingship.
I suggest the reason for his long hair is to make him recognizable to the
viewer. He has now been clearly identified as an Akkadian king,
but Sargon conquered many Akkadian kings, so the question still remains:
which king is he? Since the captive king must be someone
important enough to warrant Sargon's construction of a major victory
stele, there is only one real possibility for his true identity.

Notice how the captured king most closely resembles Sargon. They are the
only two people on the stele with long hair and beards. Who is Sargon?
Sargon is the king of Kish. So the captive king in the net is the former king
of Kish. Specifically, he is Ur-Zababa. Sargon had previously been his
cupbearer.
Sargon had a dream:
“The sleeping Sargon groaned and gnawed the ground. When King Ur
Zababa heard about this groaning, he was brought into the king's holy
presence. Sargon was brought into the presence of Ur-Zababa (who said:)
'Cupbearer, was a dream revealed to you in the night?' Sargon answered
his king: 'My king, this is my dream, which I will tell you about: There was
a young woman [the war goddess Ishtar] who was as high as the heavens
and as broad as the earth. She was as firmly set as the base of a wall. For
me, she drowned you in a great river, a river of blood.'" (ETCSL, Sargon
and Ur-Zababa, lines 12 -24)
Apparently it all came to pass. Sargon usurped the kingdom of Kish from
Ur-Zababa after a bloody battle.
The defeat of Ur-Zababa is the specific battle that is depicted on the

Victory Stele. Ur-Zababa is the only king whose defeat was important
enough to warrant a major monument like the Victory Stele. This is
especially true because Sargon had rebelled against his rightful king, so
he needed the Victory Stele for propaganda purposes, to justify his actions,
as can be seen on the stele itself. The symbology of the stele is all about
Sargon legitimizing his overthrow of Ur-Zababa. Like all usurpers, Sargon
was self-conscious about how he came to power. Even his name, which
translates as "rightful (or legitimate) king", is an attempt to justify his
reign. The same is true for the stele.
For more on Sargon's motives, see Queen Ku-Baba, the grandmother of
Ur-Zababa.
The battle of the personal gods:
Additional proof that Ur-Zababa is the captive king is a fragmentary
inscription on the stele about Ilaba, the warrior god. Perhaps
unsurprisingly, Ilaba was the personal god of Sargon. According to Nigro,
Ilaba occurs only in the earliest inscriptions of Sargon’s reign. The battle
with Ur-Zababa occurred right at the very beginning of it, so the
stele fits perfectly within the given time frame. Ur-Zababa was named for
his own personal god, Zababa, who was the god of the city of Kish. "Ur
Zababa" literally means “man of Zababa”. Sargon equated
his personal god Ilaba to the god Zababa after becoming the king of Kish.
“Ilaba is identified with Zababa, the patron deity of Kish, when
Sargon assumed the kingship of his hometown
and he was later to be closely associated with Enlil.” Sargon’s
identification with the god Zababa early in his reign is therefore
completely self-serving. In identifying himself with Zababa, Sargon
implies he has the blessing of the city’s patron deity as he seizes power
from the king who was actually named for the god. In this way, the
usurper clothes himself with the mantle of legitimacy. Later, after
he conquered Sumer and was building an empire, when no one would dare
question his legitimacy, he would drop his identification with this
minor god of a single city-state and start to associate himself with more
important gods like Enlil and Ishtar. Thus the supreme leader of the
empire aligned himself with the supreme gods of the Sumerian/Akkadian
pantheon, assuring greater importance for himself while also
increasing his appeal to many more of his subjects.

For his own reasons, Sargon identifies his personal god Ilaba with Zababa
(the personal god
of Ur-Zababa and patron deity of Kish) when he usurps the throne of Kish
from Ur-Zababa,
and then he identifies Zababa with Enlil when he conquers
Sumer and Akkad.
Mace
In the victory procession, Sargon carries the “divine mace” of the god
Ilaba, but he uses a different mace to strike and kill Ur-Zababa. This mace
has a round head. It is similar to the mace used by the Sumerian war god
Ningirsu on Eannatum’s Vulture Stele. The mace that Sargon uses may
actually belong to the god Zababa, because there’s a good possibility
that Zababa was originally on the reverse side of the stele, which is now
missing due to damage. In this way, the gods Ilaba and Zababa would both
appear to be giving Sargon their blessings. If he is using the mace of
Zababa, it means that Sargon is using the weapon
of Ur-Zababa’s own personal god against him. There's some ironic
symbolism in that. An alternative explanation is that Sargon uses his own
mace to strike Ur-Zababa, thus making the killing much more personal,
both literally and figuratively. There's some ironic symbolism
in that as well.
As previously stated, the battle with the Sumerians was an important
victory for Sargon, setting him on the road to empire. It would certainly
warrant its own victory stele, which has been lost to the ravages of time or
it's still buried somewhere waiting to be discovered. In a
real sense, however, the victory over Ur-Zababa was even more important.
If he had not first become the king of Kish, the king of one single city
state, he never would become the “King of Kish”, with a capital “K”, the
traditional title given to any king who ruled all of Sumer and Akkad.
Only after he defeated Ur-Zababa could he go on to conquer the rest of
Akkad and then conquer the Sumerians, to thus become the King of Kish,
