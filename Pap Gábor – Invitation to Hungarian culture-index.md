Invitation
(to Hungarian culture)
“AnytimeisappropriatetoserveGodandeverythingyoudoforyourhomeland
isnootherthantheserviceofGod.” ~KingMátyás(1443–1490)
This writing addresses every member of the people of the Holy Crown and contains the basic information about our culture. This is the least we should know about ourselves, our aptitude and our duties in the
world.
At the same time it tries to heal wounds, too. It tries to obliterate the bitter memory of the 2004 referendum on dual citizenship – once and for all. We know exactly that this referendum did not reflect the
opinion of the nation: the poll data was manipulated and the results were previously decided and fed into the computer. As the consequence of this referendum our compatriots – who are forced to live outside the
Hungarian borders owing to outrageously unfair dictates – were denied equal rights with us, their brothers living in Inner Hungary. Therefore we hope that this writing can somewhat (and solely temporarily)
compensate for the document that expresses the fact of dual citizenship and that was unrighteously hold back from them. Hopefully all Hungarians can soon hold this certificate in their hands. We intended this
document – brought into being by the wisdom of the community – as an evidence and testimony of our togetherness for all times. May it be of great benefit to you all!
You may know, but it is worth remembering that there are two types of man and accordingly two types of
society ever since mankind exists. As individuals we can only live either for others or at the expense of others. In the first case all kinds of fights between two individuals or two groups can be initiated for each
other only. And the goal is to expose the values hidden in the other person. In these types of conflicts nobody loses and the winner is the person who is capable of lifting the other above himself. In our
mythology this type of fight is represented by the lifestyle and deeds of Hunor and Magyar.
In the other case the goal is the inconsiderate enforcement of the interest of a person or group. Morals play here no part at all. And the strategy dictated by the interest is the following: find out who can be better
than you, and exterminate them in time! At the end of a conflict like this the winner is necessarily the one who is worse and morally inferior and the victim will be the innocent brother. The examples for this
lifestyle are the two brothers who committed fratricide: Cain from the Old Testament and Romulus from the Indo-European tradition. If mankind accomplishes this behavioral model in the everyday life – and we
can see this practice in politics, economy and culture! – its deterioration befalls inevitably. The enforcement of interests at the expense of others is the typical behavior of the animals, not the humans. In phylogenesis
this approach can only take us up to the level of the primates, the apes. And in case our ancestors were humans, it is unavoidable to come down to this level. Moreover in the course of deterioration it is not the
primates’ the final stage. If success is the ultimate objective that affects our behavior, we can descend as far as to the level of the insects. This is because it is the insects that are the most successful living creatures on



Earth. This is where the road of Cain and Romulus can lead those choosing it.
There are thus basically two alternatives for the organization of a society. Those who want to enforce the Cain model, first of all they have to create closed systems within the community, and have to get the people
forced into them believe that the way out leads solely sideways. They must conceal the possibility of escaping upwards, towards Heaven, or if it is not manageable, they have to block this way. (This is the exact
objective of the constant corruption of the churches.) A closed system can be a factory, a school, an electric power distribution system, a media organization, a political or religious sect or a country forced between
unnatural borders. The next step is to guarantee equal chances to the individuals who live for others and the ones living at the expense of others.
In our example let this closed system be a poultry-yard, with chickens – the animals living for each other
and foxes – that prey on them – enclosed among them for the sake of demonstration. It is easy to anticipate what happens to the poultry- yard if we declare equal rights for the chickens and the foxes and let them live
according to their own laws. This type of social structure is conventionally called democracy which means “rule of the people”. The fact is though that in this structure – in the past and at present, as well – it is not
the people who have the authority, but the masses assembled from subjects without personalities. It means that a parasitical scoundrel can take a share in managing the affairs of the state to the same extent as
someone who contributes to the prosperity and enrichment of the community selflessly throughout his life. (Nowadays the situation is even worse: the “people’s democracy” has turned into the “machine’s democracy”
since the announced results of a referendum can be practically unlimitedly manipulated “thanks” to electronic data processing, that is “machines”.)
The operation of such a society is ruled by Gresham’s law. This law states the following – the definition can
be found in encyclopedias, it is worth looking up –: “if there are two kinds of money in circulation in a country, the bad money inevitably drives out the good one”. It is easy to see: this is the model of Cain
working in the world of economy. The authenticity of this theory is not confined to monies though – it can be applied to all closed (!) systems where there are two different scales of values in circulation at the same
time. The most obvious field where this law works is not even economy, but politics and especially culture. Those who are “different” are of direct concern that they choose the worse (i.e. the morally inferior)
solution in each conflict, because that is their only way to success. In a society ruled by Gresham’s law the ideal characteristic is intelligence – without morals. Or to put it bluntly: slyness, disingenuousness and
inconsideration. The typical representative of this society is the parasite.
Let us see now the other case! In a society where the individuals take on the fight for the others, it is not the “rule of the masses” but the
hierarchy (an order ruled by higher principles, i.e. the “sacred rule”) that defines the relation between the individuals and the communities of different sizes. In a society like this everything and everybody can play
their part until they can make the most of their abilities – and not for their own, but for the community’s advantage!
We should know: the created world – the Universe – does not work on democratic but hierarchical
principles. If a society wants to operate in a healthy way on the long run, it has to adapt its rules of operation to this wider, universal order that comprises the given society as well.



There is only one danger that can threaten the operation of a hierarchical society – and those who are against hierarchy attack it based on this argument. This is the danger of turning into tyranny or
dictatorship. It occurs if the main standings of the hierarchy are seized by power-crazy would-be monarchs or desperate Mafia leaders – as cuckoos in the nest. (Or as in our example: the foxes in the poultry yard.) In
the history of mankind we know about only one type of social structure that operates as a hierarchy and still can effectively ward off the danger of tyranny. And that is the principle of the Holy Crown and the
operation of this theory in everyday life.
These days you may hear frequently about the Doctrine of the Holy Crown or the Mystery of the Holy Crown. The explanation though, what these expressions mean and why they are so important to us, is
usually missing. In the following we attempt to fill this need and provide a clear definition.
In the territory of the Holy Crown the plenipotentiary, the source of law is not an actual person (the alltime king) but the Holy Crown as a living personality. This means that it becomes theoretically and
practically impossible to possess absolute power and to abuse the law. The vindication of the rights of the Holy Crown does not devolve solely on a single person, the king, but on the nation and the king – in equal
shares and in this order! Consequently the possibility that the society turns into either ochlocracy that can be manipulated unlimitedly or uncontrollable dictatorship can be excluded. If one party makes a mistake, it
is the right and the obligation of the other to correct this mistake or to get it corrected.
Based on this we can acknowledge: it is not in the interest of Hungary but the whole mankind that the royal prerogatives of the Holy Crown shall be restored. Against all rumors we should know that the legal
system represented by the Holy Crown is not provisional! It was valid yesterday, it is valid today, and it will be valid tomorrow – as long as mankind intends to live a life worthy of human beings. Remember, this is
the only crown in the world honored with the word “saint”! And the king crowned with it is the only monarch in the history of the world who owns legitimately the title “apostle”. Thus the order prevailing on
the territory of the Holy Crown is the order of the universe – or the Creator himself.
Some important additional information: every human being since their birth lives in two time scales: as an individual they live in the “small or astronomical year” of 365-366 days and as the member of a nation in
the “Great Cycle of the Sun” or “precession cycle” of 26,000 years. (These are not astrological but astronomical data, therefore scientific facts!) The legal authority of the Holy Crown works in these two
time scales: since it assigns the exercise of the rights to two parties, and to both of them together: on the one hand to the nation living in the time scale of the precession cycle and on the other hand to the king, as
an individual, living in time scale of the small year. The harmony between these two elements is the key and the sine qua non of the smooth and efficient running of the hierarchy or sacred rule.
This harmony was an essential characteristic of the Hungarian Kingdom during the reign of the Árpád
dynasty (traditionally called the Turul dynasty, reigned from 1000 until 1301), and with minor interruptions lasted until the death of King Mátyás (1490). During the reign of the Habsburg dynasty this
harmony broke off fatally. At the National Assembly of 1687 the nation was forced to surrender their socalled “right to resist” (ius resistendi). This right entitled the nation in case of an unlawful act of the
monarch to enforce – by force of arms if necessary – not the rights of a person or an interest group but those of the Holy Crown. The balance therefore shifted towards one-man enforcement of law or



dictatorship. The nation as “the body of the Holy Crown” has been closed out of the governance and the inhabitants as “the members of the Holy Crown” became the exposed subjects of the antinational tyrants at
their will and pleasure. It is a fact of experience: this situation is prevailing to this very day, and means the same burden to all Hungarians, regardless to the borders. And thereby to all mankind!
Furthermore we need to know: under our ancient laws that so far have not been legally amended, the whole
territory of the historical Hungarian state is the inalienable property of the Holy Crown of which not a single square foot can be expropriated or sold. Thus the landowners decoyed or forced into the country
from abroad can only be temporary beneficiaries of the lands they occupied and the funds and properties belonging to them. In the event of the restoration of the legal system of the Holy Crown – that is expected
in the near future – all lands and properties that were appropriated illegitimately revert to their rightful owner, the Holy Crown. This is all about the recognized facts. But is it enough to realize the truth? The
pictures and the message of our Holy Crown with the two saint physicians signify equally to the king and to the nation: our aspiration is not the conquest but the cure, in every aspect of life. The world is seriously
ill today and it cannot be healed with spectacular and tempting promises but only with one’s personal approach, setting the good example. We are looking for our fellow men that have similar intentions! We
know after all that a single raindrop left alone can never reach the sea, only if it can get together with its companions, the other raindrops. That is how they form first a brook, then a stream, and a river... And
then – but then alone! – can the single droplet overcome all earthly obstacles and reach its journey’s end. However, it is not enough to find the way. We need to set out on our journey as well.
So be it!
