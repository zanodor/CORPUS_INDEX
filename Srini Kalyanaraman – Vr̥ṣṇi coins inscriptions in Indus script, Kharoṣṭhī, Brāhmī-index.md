"The Vr̥ṣṇi-s were known to Panini and to Kautilya; the latter describes them as a Sangha. In the Mahabharata they are counted amongst the Vratya brotherhood of Kṣatriyas. As one of the Yādava clans they are closely associated with Kr̥ṣṇa in myth and lore. It is said that they migrated to Dwaraka from Mathura, after Kr̥ṣṇ's capital was besieged by the demon Kalayavana. The reference to 'Yavana' here and the subsequent migration from Mathura may have had some historical basis" The coins of the Vr̥ṣṇis are by far the rarest of the so-called 'Tribal' coins of India.

formed by the four Vrishni heroes as his emanations
(a Saumya benevolent face to the east, a Simha lion face to the
south, a Varaha boar face to the north, a Raudra terrible human
face to the west) is described in detail in the Vishnudharmottara

description of the four Vyūhas Saṃkarṣaṇa, Vāsudeva,
