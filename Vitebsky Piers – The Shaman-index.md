THE SHAMAN
PIERS VITEBSKY
The shaman occupies a key role as a healer
mediating between the world of the living
and the world of spirits, and is a potent
figure in the increasingly important areas of
alternative medicine and new religion. This
book is a richly illustrated guide to the world
of shamanism both today and in the past,
from the snowscapes of Siberia to the
jungles of the Amazon.
Themes explored include visions, initiation
rites, shamanic chants, shamanism and
mental health, the shamanic use of plants,
and the political and social background to
the shaman’s work, from the Stone Age to
post-Communist Russia. Also covered are the
links between the shaman’s sense of unity in
nature and the recent growth of ecological *
consciousness in Western societies. At the
core of the book are key questions about the
mysterious realities that fall outside the
rationalist, scientific tradition.
Illustrations include colour photographs of
modern shamanism in practice in a variety
of cultures across the world, records of
shamanic art and artefacts, and a wealth of
historic archive images, including
cosmological maps and other equipment.
Many of the images are previously
unpublished.
At the back of the book, on tinted paper, is
a fascinating commentary on sources, as well
as a list of useful addresses and a directory
of peoples discussed in the text.

Introduction
Each time I return home from fieldwork
among communities with shamanic
traditions, people ask me the ques¬
tions: what is a shaman? What does a
shaman actually do? What effect is
there on the people around them? Yet
among the many existing books on
shamans, there is little that addresses
these questions directly or enables readers to
explore the subject for themselves.
This book offers an introduction to the
enchanting, but sometimes violent and disturb¬
ing world of the shaman. Shamanic motifs,
themes and characters appear throughout
human history, religion and psychology. The
word “shaman” comes from Siberia. There it is
pronounced sham-an, with the stress on the last
syllable. In English, it is usually pronounced
either shar-man or shay-man: the plural is
shamans. The word shaman has been used quite
loosely around the world - almost interchange¬
ably with “medicine-man/woman”, “sorcerer”,
“magician” and “witch-doctor”, particularly
where these figures have operated outside the
mainstream of institutionalized religions.
Although I have included other specialists who
retain control of their trance, I have focused
mainly on the kind of shamans who make a jour¬
ney of the soul. What these shamans do is so spe¬
cial that they deserve a term to themselves.
The number of people
who are fascinated by
shamanism is increasing
constantly. 1 have tried to
give a comprehensive picture,
without mystification, of what
shamans do and have done for

many thousands of years. I have paid attention
to their social context because I believe that a
shaman’s activity has meaning only in relation to
other people. Since there are thousands of
ethnic groups known to have
shamans, I have tended to focus on a
number of representative peoples,
and developed these throughout the
book in order to give the reader a feel

The Shamanic
Worldview
Being chosen by spirits, taught by them to
enter trance and to fly with one’s soul to
other worlds in the sky or clamber through
dangerous crevasses into the terror of
subterranean worlds; being stripped of one’s
flesh, reduced to a skeleton (for a hunting
society, bones are the very core of life), and
then reassembled and reborn; gaining the
power to combat spirits and heal their
victims, to kill enemies and save one’s own
people from disease and starvation - these
are features of shamanic religions which
occur in many parts of the world. At the
same time, shamans live ordinary lives,
hunting, cooking, gardening and doing
household chores like everyone else. When
shamans talk of other worlds, they do not
mean that these are disconnected from this
world. Rather, these worlds represent the true
nature of things and the true causes of events
in this world. The understanding is widely
shared in the community, and many people
may be shamans to a greater or lesser degree,
according to their insight into this reality.

10 THE SHAMANIC WORLDVIEW
What is a shaman?
Shamans are at once doctors, priests,
social workers and mystics. They have
been called madmen or madwomen,
were frequently persecuted throughout
history, dismissed in the 1960s as a
‘‘desiccated” and “insipid” figment of
the anthropologist’s imagination, and
are now so fashionable that they inspire
both intense academic debate and the
naming of pop groups. Shamans have
probably attracted more diverse and
conflicting opinions than any other
kind of spiritual specialist. The shaman
seems to be all things to all people.
The word “shaman” comes from the
language of the Evenk, a small Tungus
speaking group of hunters and reindeer
herders in Siberia. It was first used only
to designate a religious specialist from
this region. By the beginning of the
20th century it was already being
applied in North America to a wide
range of medicine-men and medicine
women, while some New Age practi¬
tioners today use the word widely for
persons who are thought to be in any
sort of contact with spirits.
The Siberian shaman’s soul is said to
be able to leave the body and travel to
other parts of the cosmos, particularly
to an upper world in the sky and a
lower world underground. This ability
is traditionally found in some parts of
the world and not in others and allows
us to speak of clearly shamanistic soci¬
eties and cultures. A broader definition
than this would include any kind of per¬
son who is in control of his or her state
of trance, even if this does not involve a j
soul journey, as in Korea. In these sens¬
es, shamans are quite different from
other kinds of spirit medium who are
possessed and dominated by spirits as
and when the spirits themselves choose
and who then need to be exorcized. But
even though the shaman enters trance



WHAT IS A SHAMAN? 11
under controlled conditions, his or her
“mastery” of the spirits remains highly
precarious. The shaman’s profession is
considered psychically very dangerous
and there is a constant risk of insanity
or death.
There can be no shaman without a
surrounding society and culture.
Shamanism is not a single, unified reli¬
gion but a cross-cultural form of reli¬
gious sensibility and practice. In all
societies known to us today shamanic
ideas generally form only one strand
among the doctrines and authority
structures of other religions, ideologies
and practices. There were probably
purely shamanist communities in the
past but we have only vague ideas about
_ what it must have felt like to live in
1 them. Shamanism is scattered and frag
j merited and should perhaps not be
;'ah” at all. There is no doc¬
trine, no w'orld shamanic church, no
holy book as a point of reference, no
priests with the authority to tell us what
is and what is not correct.
Nevertheless, there ate astonishing
similarities, which are not easy to
explain, between shamanic ideas and
practices as far apart as the Arctic,
Amazonia and Borneo, even though
these societies have probably never had
any contact with each other. Many cur¬
rent interpretations emphasize the heal¬
ing side of shamanism, but this is only
one aspect of the shaman’s work.
Among other things, shamanism is a
hunter’s religion, concerned with the
necessity of taking life in order to live
I oneself. The shamanic view of cosmic
equilibrium is founded largely on the
idea of paying for the souls of the ani¬
mals one needs to eat (see pp.30-33),
and in many societies the shaman flies
to the owner of the the animals in order
to negotiate the price.
IN AWE OF THE SPIRITS: TWO FRIGHTENED LITTLE GIRLS
A shaman works in partnership with spirits. In
the shamanic experience, feelings of exaltation
and joy are experienced only as a counterpart
to feelings of fear. A shaman is someone who
can handle forces on which ordinary people’s
lives depend but which also fill them with
terror. This sense of awe and helplessness is
conveyed in the following account of a
Kalaalit (Eskimo) shaman in Greenland who
tried to interest two little girls in becoming his
pupils. One of them recalled in later years:
“I was shivering with fear. His helping spirits
could be heard buzzing and humming from
the roof, from the walls and right down from
the floor. It was strange, beyond our under¬
standing. ‘Now, here comes Amarsinijoq!’ he
said, and we felt a great commotion in the
house. None of us said a word - I was
trembling with fear and had a feeling as if my
skin was being flayed off me, from my head
downwards. ‘Now he is in here,’ the shaman
said. We were unable to utter a word, so
frightened were we, nor dared we run away out
through that long, dark house.”
This monster emergedfrom an opening in the
ice, so terrifying the Canadian Inuit shaman
who made this drawing that he failed to secure it as a helping spirit.



12 THE SHAMANIC WORLDVIEW
Spirits and souls
Human beings constantly modify and
investigate their surroundings. At the
same time, the physical universe acts
upon us, so we are linked to the world
in a circuit of activity and feeling.
Neither we, as humans, nor our sur¬
roundings have full identity or meaning
without the other.
This picture of mutual dependency
could characterize an avant-garde eco¬
logical position, but it is also integral to
the shamanic view of the world in
which everything not only animals,
but also plants and rocks, wind and
rain - may be imbued with spirit. In any
system of beliefs, understanding the
nature of spirit is a profound theologi¬
cal and psychological problem. In
shamanic thinking, “spirit” sometimes
seems better translated as the “essence”
of a phenomenon - it is what makes an
animal an animal, or a tool a tool.
Spirit can also be consciousness: crea¬
tures, trees, rocks and tools can have
consciousness similar to our own
human consciousness. At the same time
as having their own existence, spirits

also sometimes deliberately act upon
humans and cause events in our lives.
They can love humans, and so nourish
us and feel compassion. They also have
needs and emotions, such as hunger,
jealousy and pride, and so can attack us
and eat us or drive us mad.
This kind of religious sensibility rep¬
resents the fruits of millennia of experi¬
ence at the same time as it provides a
means for acting upon the world.
Shamanism is a practical and pragmat¬
ic religion, never only a mystical one.



SPIRITS AND SOULS 13
m
The sense of unity it provides therefore
does not deny the distinct identity of
separate phenomena. Within the inte¬
grated shamanic universe there are
many categories. Numerous separate
spirits have their own forms, names and
qualities. The spirit of the sun is distin¬
guished from the spirit of the moon.
Maybe they are brother and sister, or
husband and wife. Their resemblance to
humans will be emphasized by myths
about how they came to be as they are
and how they affect our lives.
Bear spirits are big and fierce while
mouse spirits are timid but can usefully
enter narrow crevices. The spirit of a
knife cuts while that of a pot contains.
Just as every person is unique and yet
has something in common, so every
stream and every mountain may have a
specific spirit with its own name, prop¬
erties and effects on humans. Spirits
may marry humans or endow them
with some of their own properties. But
with these same properties, they may
also overwhelm us. These alternatives
reflect the ambiguous properties of the
environment itself in which animals,
landscape and weather may either
nourish or destroy us, according to
their mood of the moment.
The consciousness of spirits can
merge into human consciousness. The
soul of a living human is usually
believed to become spirit when it dies,
and dead humans may become either
ancestor spirits or part of some larger
elemental spirit. At the same time, the
soul may be an image of the body. The
Sora of India see the soul as contained
in the blood and so having exactly the
same shape as the body it fills. The Sora
say that the soul is like a photograph
and older generations, like many people
the world over, believe that having a
photograph taken can weaken a person.

Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Wyoming,

14 THE SHAMANIC WORLDVIEW
Shamanic logic starts from the idea
that the soul can leave the body. This
happens to everyone at death, but the
experience of dreaming is taken to show
that the soul can also wander indepen¬
dently and return without causing
death. Shamanic societies often see soul
flight during trance as a controlled
form of dreaming, in which shamans
turn an involuntary form of universal
human experience into a controlled
technique. Many peoples believe that
humans have more than one soul.
Shamans’ souls can travel to other
realms, and laypersons’ souls may be
kidnapped by spirits or enemy shamans
while their bodies remain, for the time
being, alive. The soul which wanders
represents the person’s consciousness or
personality, while the soul which stays
behind keeps the body’s metabolism
functioning. If the first of these souls
does not return, the second soul will
not survive long without it. In parts of
SOUL AND LIVER
Among the Wana of the Celebes, a person’s
dreaming soul is a small model of that person
which resides in the fontanelle; each hand and
foot has a “gem” which is also equated with
the pulse. Souls can also be represented by the
internal organs. The liver can be captured by
SOUL OL A PERSON AND ESSENCE OF A SPECIES
The Inuit of Canada believed that animals and
birds have a group soul. A single word was
used to identify all the members of one species.
Often, two humans had the same name. This
gave them a soul-relationship and a mutual
sympathy. So a person’s name can link him or
her to other people and also to an entire
species. In addition, the person is sympatheti¬
cally linked to dead persons who bear the
same name, forming a network of partially
shared souls which bridges the living, the dead
and the animal kingdom.
southeast Asia it is considered danger¬
ous to wake people too suddenly in case
their dream soul does not have time to
return safely.
However, the anatomy of the psyche
can be more complex than this. Eskimo
peoples generally believe that there is a
third soul, representing the person’s
name, which is transmitted from one
living holder to the next, while the
Yuchi and Sioux of North America
have four souls each. Other variants are
possible: among the Jivaro people of
Amazonia the wandering soul is com¬
bined with the person’s guardian spirit,
while among the nearby Yagua a per¬
son has two souls while alive and three
further ones which become active (and
dangerous) only after death. The exis¬
tence of helper spirits (see pp.66-9,
91-3) suggests that shamanic cultures
have an idea of the person which is not
as tightly bounded inside the body as is
common in industrial societies.

devour the liver of someone already fated to
die, but do not always wait and can also be
incited by a sorcerer. One young man was
attacked in the forest, his liver eaten and the

the incident and went on living normally for a
while until he suddenly collapsed and died.

Layers of the cosmos
THE SHAMANIC WORLDVIEW 15
The shaman’s activity is based on ideas
of space, and although the everyday
world is permeated by spirits there are
also other, separate realms to which
shamans must travel. If one assumes
that spirits exist, and that they exist in a
different realm from ours and reach out
to affect our health and our food sup¬
ply, then it follows that when these
things are disrupted someone must
travel into the realm of the spirits to
persuade them to behave differently.
Perhaps “space” can best be under¬
stood as a metaphor for the otherness
of the spirit realm. If we see spirits as
the essence of the things around us,
then this realm is not geographically
removed. Rather, it occupies the same
space as we do but is accessible to only
some of us some of the time. This access
comes only with great effort and skill.
Space is a way of expressing difference
and separation, but the shaman’s jour¬
ney expresses the possibility of coming
together again.
The gulf in space represents firstly a
difference of being. Spirits, whether of
dead people whom we have known or
of forces of nature, exist not here but
somewhere else. This gulf can also
sometimes reflect the moral inferiority
of humans as they live a degraded exis¬
tence in a state of separation from the
divine. In this light, the shaman’s jour¬
ney resembles the quest in other, more
explicitly moralistic religious systems,
such as the search for the Holy Grail. It
is possible to see this as a quest to

grows from the body of a woman supposedly
sacrificed during.a drought. It reaches up to the

THE UPPER AND LOWER WORLDS OF THE SIBERIAN SHAMAN
Siberian peoples traditionally believed that the
world was divided into three layers. Human
beings lived on the middle layer, but the upper
world, in the sky, could be reached through a
small hole. It had a hard surface with a
complete landscape and even animals. This
upper world was further subdivided into several
levels. Among hunters in the far north there
might be only three of these, but in the south
under the influence of nearby empires and
courts there might be many more and the
LAYERS OF THE COSMOS 17
supreme ruler Bai Ulgen was thought to live
on the ninth or even sixteenth level. The lower
world was likewise divided into several layers
and was often considered the realm of the
dead. These other worlds were partly like
ours, in that they had rivers, mountains and
creatures; and partly different, in that it may
have been night there when it was day here.
The Nganasan people thought that it was cold
in the lower world and dressed the deceased in
winter furs. The Yakut, on the contrary,
thought that it was cold in the sky, and
shamans would sometimes return from a
journey to the sky covered in icicles.

return to some primordial state of
grace. The shaman is a specialist in
crossing this otherwise impassable gulf,
and only a shaman has the necessary
technique and the courage to do so.
The separate realm of the spirits need
not always be located on other cosmo¬
logical levels. It is sometimes located on
this earth and the shaman’s task is to fly
to known spots on the familiar land¬
scape. In a particular tribal region in
India, one passes the land of the dead
on the bus into town. But even on
earth, the otherness of the realm is
emphasized by the physical inaccessibil¬
ity or the taboos surrounding the site,
which may be an awe-inspiring outcrop
of rock or a mountain cave.
The fundamental technique of
shamanic travel is a state of controlled
trance (see pp.70-73). Shamanic geog¬
raphy can therefore also be seen as a
topography of mental states (see
pp. 154-9). Some psychologists and
neo-shamanists today are trying to pro¬
duce “maps” of mental states, in vari¬
ous literal and symbolic senses. In this,
they seem to be following very closely
the correspondence which traditional
shamans themselves make between
their state of mind and their location on
a chart of cosmic space.



18 THE SHAMANIC WORLDVIEW
Levels of reality
In whatever way other people conceive
and experience their ordinary sur¬
roundings, according to shamanic
thinking the dimension of the spirits is
permanently present, although it is
largely hidden. It is hidden because it
expresses not the surface appearance of
things but their inner nature. Thus to a
shamanic culture there is more to reali¬
ty, especially to its conscious aspect,
than that which meets the eye and the
other ordinary senses. One author has
written of the Nunamiut, an Eskimo
people, that “the spirit of an object may
be thought of as the essential existing
force of that object. Without a spirit, an
object might still occupy space and have weight, but it would have no
meaning and no real existence. When
an object is invested with an inua [soul],
it is a part of nature of which we are
aware.” There are various ways of expressing
the difference between the world of
essences and our habitual world of phe¬
nomena or impressions. Although they
have an underworld, the Sora of India
also experience the spirits through a
complete overlap between the two
worlds, which are frequently at cross¬
purposes in a way which causes consid¬
erable difficulties for the living. The
other world is an inversion or parody of
this one. The seasons are reversed, and
when people cut down trees in the hoe¬
ing season to make a clearing for their
crops, they annoy the spirits who are
already using those same trees as bean
A Canadian shaman from the Baker Lake
community pictures himself as a transparent
man. Shamans are commonly drawn or.painted
as skeletons, representing their ritual
dismemberment during the process of initiation.
In order to heal a patient, a shaman may need
to see through the sick person's outer skin to the
organs and the hones inside. The shamans of
Hudson Bay believe that the inu'sia or
"appearance as a human being " - resides in a
bubble of air in the groin, and that from it
comes not just appearance but strength and life.
Each species has its own inu'sia. and it is this
core that makes a man a man. a caribou a

the limit shaman can strip his body so that
nothing remains but the bones. He must then
name each part of his body and each bone, name
by name. In this way he sees himself naked,
freedfrom the perishable and transient flesh and
blood, and devotes himself to the work of the
poles to support their own crops, which shaman through the part of his body which will

SEEING AND VISION
Among the limit people of Alaska, a person
who wanted to become a shaman's apprentice
might explain, “ Takujunuiquma -■ I come to
you because I desire to see.” The idea that
wisdom involves some kind of second or inner
sight is widespread among shamanic cultures
and is often associated with the loss of a
person’s normal eyesight. In Greek legend
Tiresias, who possessed a typically shamanic
multiple nature, having been both a man and a
woman (see pp.91—3), was struck blind by the
Greek Goddess Hera. Zeus compensated for
this by giving him the gift of second sight.
Other Greek “seers” were also blind, such as
Calchas in Homer's poem The Iliad. In many
parts of the world there is an association
The limit believed that uttering a name created a reality, even if only a mental one. Objects
and their names were equally real. A person’s
name is part of their soul in that it symbolizes
, their social existence and their relationship to
the environment. It can also represent a
person’s essence: it is this which they will pass
on to another person after death. Christian Soras say that Jesus is more powerful than the
spirits of their shamans, but that they still
believe in the old spirits as these have their
own names and all names refer to something.
NAMES AND REALITY
The words of limit songs are part of the
material environment, like snow, bones or
skin. They have a functional property, which
can be wrapped up, carved and put together,
just like the material of any other craft.

between blindness and musicianship, or the
gift of poetry. Homer himself is said to have
been blind, and the sightless poet Milton
would recite verses as soon as he awoke, which
had come to him in his sleep.
Shamanic power is also often expressed
in terms of special sight, as when Siberian shamans’ eyes are gouged out by spirit
blacksmiths during their initiation and
replaced by new, specially adapted eyes which
can see other realities. In the photographs
below, a shaman of the Hmong people of the
mountainous areas of Laos is making a
journey into the spirit realm. The metal rings

20 THE SHAMANIC WORLDVIEW
A SHAMAN'S-EYE PHOTOGRAPH OF NON-ORDINARY REALITY?
This unique photograph of Tamu shamans
was taken in Nepal at the climax of a rite to
soothe the ghost of a person who had died in
an unnatural and inauspicious way. The rite is
called a Moshi Tibet.
Five shamans are sitting side by side and
chanting. The shamans and their audience are
on tenterhooks, waiting for the souls of the
dead person to come (in this region of Nepal,
a person is believed to have more than one
soul). Everyone’s attention is focused on a bird
which is tied to a model spirit-house. They are
waiting for it to flutter its wings, which
indicates that the souls of the deceased have
arrived. When one of the shamans saw the
photograph he exclaimed, “This is exactly
what the god, the witches and the ancestors
look like! They don’t really look the way you
see them in pictures, with faces. These are the
exact colours I see, in exactly the right
positions. But how can a camera see what
only I can see? This is secret knowledge,
ordinary people can’t see these things. It must
be a very good camera.”
The shaman explained that the yellow line
running right across the picture is what the “*
ancestor spirits who come to protect the
shamans look like as they arrive. The orange
bar across the shamans' heads is the god
Khhlye Sondi Phhresondi who has come to
protect them from the souls of witches. These
witches, who are actually malevolent living \
humans, can be seen above the heads of three
of the shamans in the form of green wavy
lines. The witches are absent at two significant
points. These are where the protective orange
line is at its strongest, and over the head of
one shaman on the right who dropped out for
a rest and is therefore not engaged in the
spiritual battle. This photograph is published
here for the first time, with the permission of
the shamans.
The spirit world also contains and
expresses the true causes of things that
happen in the ordinary world. The two
realms are linked in such a way that
events in the spirit world have effects in
this world, so a successful hunting sea¬
*
son or a famine, a healthy community
or an epidemic, can all be ascribed to
the actions of spirits. When a shaman
moves freely between these worlds, this
is also a way of saying that he or she can
perceive the other reality and under



stand how it affects this reality. In the
speech of shamans and of their soci¬
eties, these two realities often appear to
be merged, so that a shaman may casu¬
ally mention in the same breath that he
took the bus to market and rode a wild
animal to the moon. It would perhaps
be truer to their understanding not to
talk of separate realities. Rather, spirits
represent the real essences of things and
are the real causes of events in the
world of ordinary perception.

Concepts of power
Shamanism involves both under¬
standing the world and acting
upon it. The shaman must

order to make the

govern life and
nature work
Porcupine quills, which are lor the benefit
fired, at witches in Nepal. of the commu¬
nity. Spirit is more than just conscious¬
ness, and because it is capable of caus¬
ing things to happen in this world it is
a form of power. Much of the shaman’s
work consists of harnessing it. The Sora people describe the impulse
of spirits as a force, power or energy
(;renabti). Just like the Latin origin of
the words “power” and “potential”,
this word is derived from the verb “to
be able”. Sora see electricity as operat¬
ing in the same way as spirit, which is
similarly dynamic and capable of stor¬
age in containers, transmission along
threads, and leaping across gaps. But
spirit is far more than electricity, since it
is also consciousness. Its impetus can¬
not be switched off since it has its own
will. When shamans negotiate with this
power it not only enables them to make
things happen, but even to turn into
animals. Since human affairs include much
suffering, disease and death this is a
dangerous and often dark occupation.
Shamanic power is not something to be
taken on lightly and often exacts a
high price. In Siberia, Mongolia
and many other areas, people
dread being called by the spir¬
its to become shamans and
resist for as long as they have
the strength. Recently, in a remote area
of Siberia, the last local shaman died as
an old man. He had tried to pass on his
secrets to his grandson but the grand¬
son had repeatedly declined the gift,
and later explained that he could not
face the personal sacrifice which would
be required of him, since a shaman’s
power is fed from the soul-force of his
immediate family. His wife and children
must therefore suffer poor health and
early death as the shaman unintention¬
ally sucks the life out of those with
whom he lives. The spiritual power that emanates
from the natural world must operate
alongside chiefly power, military power
and even purchasing power. Although
speakers of different languages may not
always use the same words for these,
they often perceive analogies between
them, and shamanic power has some¬
times been very closely associated with
political power (see pp. 116-9). Shamanic power depends on keeping
control over the trance state. There are
many other forms of trance that are not
shamanic, such as the trance of medi¬
ums in those forms of possession where
the spirits are in control of the situa¬
tion. These are basic to most African

HOW ANACONDAS ARE NOT SHAMANS BUT HAVE SHAMANIC PROPERTIES
Shamanic ideas are very
subtle and our understanding
of them is complicated by
problems of translation.
Mystical power itself is not
an easy concept to discuss.
The word for a shaman in
parts of the Amazon is paye
and one may be told that
someone “is paye”. One can
also be told that the
anaconda, as a species, is
very paye but that the tapir is
only a little bit paye. Here,
the word “paye” is used not
to describe a role (like “a
priest”) but as a quality or
attribute. Paye seems to
mean “imbued with shamanic
power” and these remarks
would be better translated
as “the anaconda is a
s^iamanistic animal” and
“the tapir is only a little
bit shamanistic”. The
anthropologist who reports
this information from the
Wayapi adds ironically that
it is unfortunate that he is
obliged to use a Siberian
word to discuss holders of
spiritual power in the
Amazon, but adds that at
least it has left the local
expression paye undamaged
by overuse in English.

power as points of rest or
concentration in the
movement of spirit:
“Everything as it moves
now and then, here and there,
makes stops. A bird as it flies
stops in one place to make its
nest and in another place to
rest from its flight. A man
when he goes forth stops
when he wills. So the god
(Wakan) has stopped. The
sun, which is so bright and
beautiful, is one place where
he has stopped.
“The moon, the stars, the
wind he has been with. The
trees, the animals, are all
where he has stopped, and
the Indian thinks of these
places and sends his prayers
to reach where the god has
stopped and to win health
and a blessing."

religions, but also occur widely in
Christianity and in other world reli¬
gions, where possession by spirits is
generally regarded as improper or
unclean, and something to be “treated"
either by exorcism or by the casting out
of demons. In many parts of the world
possession by spirits, as opposed to
mastery over them, is particularly com¬
mon among women. This has been seen
as a form of compensation for their
social and political powerlessness. For
the same reason, possession may be
prominent among subordinate classes
or ethnic groups. Such an interpretation
fits a great many situations, but posses¬
sion, just like shamanism, is also an

POWER REGURGITATED
FROM THE STOMACH
Power can pass through
many objects, substances,
forms and actions. Among
various peoples of the
Peruvian upper Amazon, a
shaman keeps one aspect of
his power as a thick white
phlegm in the upper part of
his stomach, which is the
most vital part of the body.
This phlegm contains spirit
helpers which the shaman
calls upon for healing, as well
as magical darts which he
fires into victims to harm
them. As the dart seeks its
victim and buries itself inside,
it is partly an object and
partly a living being, partly
material and partly spirit.
In this region of Peru, in
particular, power regularly
takes the form of plants (see
pp.85-7). The shaman’s
phlegm is called yachay,
which is derived from a
verb meaning “to know".
A painting of a Peruvian vegetalista shaman and his phlegm.
It therefore also represents
power as knowledge. The
magical substance, the
helping spirits and the darts
are just three aspects of the
same shamanic power, which
in turn consists of knowing
how the world really is and
how to manipulate its
processes. The shaman is able
to regurgitate some of this
phlegm and give it to a pupil
to drink, in order to pass on
this knowledge and power.



THE RANGE OF SPIRIT-SPECIALISTS IN SHAMANIST SOCIETIES
Shamans usually work in the same community
alongside other specialists such as diviners,
herbalists, midwives and bone-setters. There
can also be more and less powerful shamans.
Among the Sora of India, male shamans work
mostly in the “lesser” tradition of divining and
healing, while funerals are conducted by
shamans of the “great” tradition, who are
mostly women. Among the Yakut of
northeastern Siberia, the “black” and “white”
oyun (male shaman) and udaghan (female
shaman) were a wide range of traditional
spiritual and medical specialists. Others would
include the otohut (healer), iicheen (wise
person), tiiulleekh kihi (dream interpreter), and
korbiiochhu (foreteller of the future). The
midsummer issyakh festival, celebrated by the
white shaman, was counterbalanced by an

integral part of the wider culture.
A shaman’s power is derived from
spirits and can reside in objects, songs
or actions, such as the beating of a
drum. The nature of this power varies.
In Lapland, Saami shamans used their
drums directly as divining tools. In
many shamanic cultures the rhythmic
beating of a drum or some other per¬
cussion instrument is an aid in achiev¬
ing a state of trance. In parts of
Amazonia the shamans may swallow
spiritually powerful plants and insects
as a way of internalizing their power.
There are terrible stories of people who
have abused hallucinogenic drugs such
as ayahuasca, which emphasize the
dangers of taking these plants when
one is inadequately prepared. This is a
point made repeatedly by native experts
(see pp.85-7). To concentrate only on
the chemistry of shamanic plants is to
miss the point. Their significance is
much wider. Yet spirit power remains
elusive and always partly outside the
shaman: it is hard to acquire and can
easily be lost again.

Regional Traditions
Every landscape has its own spiritual
meaning. On the peninsula of Kamchatka,
the Siberian sense of landscape sees spirits
in the forces of the weather and in the cliffs
and lakes of this vast, sparsely populated
mountain region. In the lush Amazon jungle,
by contrast, spirits are thought to reside in
particular species of the huge trees that crowd
down to the water. The Amazon river and its
tributaries dominate much of South America,
and the enormous biological diversity in the
waters and the surrounding jungle allows the
elaborate use of plant medicines that give
Amazonian shamanism its special tone.
Certain patterns of shamanic thought seem
to recur across a wide range of landscapes, in
many diverse cultures and in many different
social and political situations. These may be
a survival from the earliest human sense
of the divine. As more elaborate societies
developed over time, other forms of religion
arose and shamanic ideas were often
eliminated or incorporated. They sometimes
lie hidden within the major world religions.

The religion of the stone age
In 1991, the frozen, mummified body of
a man was found preserved under a
glacier in the Austrian Alps. He was
overtaken by a blizzard while crossing a
high mountain pass some 5,000 years
ago. He may have been a shepherd, but
his skin tattoos, a stone disc on a
leather thong and some dried medicinal
mushrooms in his possession have led
to speculation that he could have been a
shaman on a ritual or spiritual journey.
Long before this “Ice Man" was
found, the discovery in the early 20th
century of prehistoric cave paintings in
the south of France had triggered spec¬
ulation that the half-human, half-ani¬
mal figures who appear among the
ordinary animals may be shamans, and
that shamanism may therefore be the
original, primordial human religion. In
one picture, a man with an erect phallus
lies next to a bison, with a bird-headed
staff alongside; the man seems to be
bird-headed himself and this is thought
to be a shaman in trance. This interpre¬
tation was popularized in the 1960s by
Lommel in a lavishly illustrated and
influential book called Shamanism: the
Beginnings of Art. However, LommelV

It is difficult to equate these Cultures
with the peoples of Europe 40.000 years

by Lommel are all based on hunting, I
their local ecological and social condi¬
tions must have been very different.

the debate to rock paintings in North '!

SIBERIAN ROCK ART FROM PREHISTORIC TIMES
TO THE PRESENT DAY
The sheer diversity of prehistoric paintings and carvings from
various parts of the world that have been published from the
11960s onward ensures that the possible existence of prehistoric
shamans will continue to excite controversy. A major source,
still largely unknown in the West, is the Russian study of
Siberia and central Asia, a region with one of the strongest
shamanic traditions in modern times.

from France have ever been published,

■‘altered states of consciousness”.
However, if the social position of a pre¬
historic shaman is almost impossible to
guess, the shaman’s state of mind is
even more intangible.
The ideas surrounding shamans are
so complex and subtle that it takes all
the efforts of anthropologists working
among living people to discover them,
and even then there are many dangers
of misunderstanding. It is possible that
palaeolithic hunters had shamans in
their communities, but the theory can¬
not be proved. It seems unquestionable
that, until the development of agricul¬
ture, all human societies were based on
hunting and in recent history shaman¬
ism has had a particularly strong link
with the hunting way of life. This is not,
however, a simple and exclusive connec¬
tion (see pp.30 33).

Those modern authors who adopt a
psychological approach, as well as neo

potential for “altered states of con¬

which means that these states can be
rediscovered in different times and

for altered states is realized much more
in some persons and societies than in
others, and takes very different forms in
each kind of society.
Even though the existence of palae¬

discipline and medical practice. It is

hunting that we find it hard to imagine
the pursuit of animals as being all that
stands between us and starvation.
Indeed, some Westerners interested



HUNTERS, HERDERS AND FARMERS 31
in shamanism today may be vegetari¬
ans, a position which would be impossi¬
ble to explain to most traditional
shamans. The continuity in shamanic
thought between human and animal
souls is based on the necessity of killing
animals. The attitude of hunting soci¬
eties toward game has been described
by one sensitive Western observer as a
“complex of worship and brutality”.
These beliefs tie in with the widespread
idea of a guardian Master or Mistress
of Animals (see pp. 106-9) who is the
keeper of animal species and represents
their collective soul or essence. This
being releases animals to human
hunters in order to provide them with
sustenance, but in exchange demands
certain sacrifices, and in particular the
observance of rules of social morality
(see pp. 110-15, 125-7). The way in
which a shaman’s soul flies around the
landscape to locate game animals
resembles the flight to rescue the cap¬
tured soul of a patient. Just as living
humans hunt animals, so spirits hunt



32 REGIONAL TRADITIONS
HUNTERS AND LOVERS
There is a common conceptual
link between hunting and
seduction, with the
penetration of the animal’s
body analogous to sexual
union. Among the Desana of
the upper Amazon, the word
for “to hunt” also means “to
make love to the animals”.
The prey is courted and
sexually excited so that it will
draw toward the hunter and
allow itself to be shot. The
hunter himself must be in a
state of sexual tension arrived
at through sexual abstinence
for at least a day beforehand.
He must make himself
attractive for the courtship by
means of physical cleanliness,
ritual purity, magical spells
and face paint. If the animal
he kills is female, he may
express sorrow at having
killed “such a pretty beast”.
In parts of Siberia the
shaman, representing the
community, may enter into a
sexual relationship with the
daughter or sister of the
Master of the Animals, who
is herself a reindeer or elk
and represents her species.
During rituals representing
his marriage to her, the
shaman’s dance includes wild
movements and snortings as

of shamans seems to vary strongly with
the nature of their society. There are
some kinds of female shaman in
Siberia, but the classic Siberian idea of
the shaman as master of spirits is very
much an image of the male hunter or
warrior, with his heroic style of jour¬
neying across the cosmos and engaging
spirits in battle. This type of figure con¬
tinues into societies such as those of
Mongolia and Central Asia, where



HUNTERS, HERDERS AND FARMERS 33
hunting has gradually been superseded
over hundreds or thousands of years by
the keeping of large herds of semi
domesticated animals. Female shamans
become more prominent in agrarian,
crop-growing societies, as is the case in
South and Southeast Asia. Sora
woman shamans in India sometimes
hold a sword or axe as they go into
trance in order to fight with neighbour¬
ing tribesmen and were-leopards on
their soul journey, but in many regions
women’s imagery tends to be domestic
rather than heroic. In Korea, all
shamans are women, or occasionally
men dressed as women, and the Korean
shaman has been called “a woman
among women, a ritual expert of and
for housewives”.
Situations such as these suggest that
a concentration on healing represents a
reduction in the full scope of shaman¬
ism. Wherever hunting and warfare
exist in a shamanistic society, shaman¬
ism lies at the heart of these activities.
Hunting imagery often persists and
retains a strong ideological value and
emotional charge in societies where
hunting has long ceased to be a serious
economic activity, or even to be prac¬
tised at all. At the same time, in herding
and crop-growing societies the empha¬
sis of ritual shifts away from the body
of the hunted animal, which is always
shown respect and may be given an
offering of food and alcohol, to that of
a domestic animal which is sacrificed.
Shamanism may be a particularly
appropriate religion for a classless
hunting society, but shamans also func¬
tion under the most diverse social and
political systems. As the importance of
hunting declines, other forms of
religion, divination and healing
begin to appear and the shaman
ic element which remains in them
becomes increasingly ambiguous
and hard to pinpoint. The
shaman as a single central figure
is joined or replaced by a range
of complementary and parallel
specialists. This process is linked
with the growth of the nation
state, which can hardly arise on
the basis of a pure hunting econ¬
omy. In societies with a more
complex social organization,
natural human anxieties about
chance and misfortune shift from
hunting to floods and crop fail¬
ure, passports and permits, and
passing exams or finding a job.
At a Sora funeral, the shaman offers a
buffalo’s soulfor the deceased to use for
ploughing in the underworld. Hunting
has largely disappeared, and rituals
concentrate on domestic animals.

This is the classic shamanic area. The
very word “shaman” comes from the
language of the Evenk (Tungus), a
hunting and reindeer-herding people of
the Siberian forests. Although some
scholars have argued that the word is
actually derived from Sanskrit, the
term shamanism could strictly be used
to mean only the religions of Siberia
and Mongolia. These religions, which
traditionally did not have a name, share
a layered cosmology with a tree, pillar
or mountain linking the different levels.
They also involved a belief in the sepa¬
rability of the soul from the body and
the magical flight of the shaman’s soul
to the sky and the underworld.
Typically, the shaman is initiated by
being tortured and dismembered by
spirits and then put back together
again. Through much of the area there
is a special association between the
shaman and the blacksmith.
There are, however, very important
local variations. On the Pacific coast
facing Alaska, the Chukchi and
Siberian Eskimo lived traditionally by

hunting whales, seals and walruses.
Many different peoples across thou¬
sands of miles of inland forest lived by
hunting reindeer and elk, sometimes
breeding and herding them in large
numbers as well as fishing in the numer¬
ous streams and lakes. Further south,
as the forest gives way to steppe, hunt¬
ing societies turned toward pastoral
ism, with large herds of sheep, goats
and even camels.
There were many different kinds of
“shaman”, even within the same society
or encampment. Some were healers.



SIBERIA AND MONGOLIA 35
others were finders of game, still others
warded off evil spirits or contacted the
dead. The idea of the pure or ideal
shaman, as posited by Eliade, becomes
increasingly difficult to sustain in any
survey of this ecologically and socially
diverse region. Broadly, there are two
different strands that go to make up the
overall religious pattern of the region.
The strand that has attracted by far
the most attention involves the kind
of shaman who participates in the
immanent forces of the world,
whether these are human, animal,
or elements such as water and
wind. In this kind of shaman
ism the shaman becomes
something other than himse
or herself, such as an animal.
These kinds of shamans
travel to the sky, usually
in order to redress an
unfavourable situation
such as sickness. The
other strand is that of
clan shamanism, which is
concerned with the repro¬
duction of the family,
kind of shamanism is associ¬
ated with the cult of the sky
and of the mountains which
lead towards them. These
cult sites, made of a cairn of
stones with a vertical pole sticking up
out of them, are still popular and are
called oboo in Mongolia and nearby
regions. Shamans of this second kind
rarely went into trance and concentrat¬
ed instead on prayer and sacrifice. Such
shamans did not turn into animals or
travel to the sky. Among the Buryat and
Yakut, the differences correspond to a
native classification of shamans into
black and white. Broadly speaking,
black shamans went into trance and
with the spirits of the under¬
world and disease, while white
shamans did not enter trance but
invoked blessings for humans and
livestock from the spirits and
gods of the upper world.
These white shamans corre
to what in other parts
of the world might be
called priests.
When religion is closely
tied to ecology, it follows
that changes in the envi¬
ronment and way of life
must be accompanied by
changes in religious struc¬
tures and behaviour.

master of the world. The
shaman gave this warrior the
title of Genghis Khan. But
Genghis was also able to fall
into trance and divine the
future for himself without
any help. When the shaman
later changed sides and
prophesied that Genghis’s
younger brother would
depose him, Genghis had the
shaman put to death. The
shaman’s body lay in a tent
for three days and on the
third day rose up through the
smoke-hole to the sky. No
more was heard of him and
the political ambitions of his faction were broken.



breeders such as the Evenk
and the Yukaghir in central
and northeastern Siberia,
the shaman was a
leader and negotiated
the spirits for the souls
of animals to be hunted.
Towards the northwest, for
example among the Nganasan, the
shaman had less connection with the
clan as this was too dispersed. On the
Pacific coast, among the Chukchi and
Korya, the clan was weak and families
could perform some of their own
shamanic rites. Where there were pro¬
fessional shamans, they were relatively
unattached to social groups and per¬
formed particularly spectacular tricks
to retain clients.
The context of shamanism in south¬
ern Siberia and Mongolia was very dif¬
ferent. Here, sizable herds led to larger
communities and a strong clan. In addi¬
tion, the influence of Buddhism from
the Middle Ages onward led to a more

elaborate cosmology and shamanism
was more fully institutionalized. As
well as being healers, shamans also
often served as sacrificial priests.
During important rituals, the shaman’s
role would be that of escorting the soul
of the horse or other sacrificed animal
to the next world.
By the 19th and early 20th centuries,
when the first field studies were made,
these shamanists had become marginal
frontier peoples sandwiched between
the modern Russian and Chinese
empires. In Mongolia and southern
Siberia, shamanism was also competing
with the Tibetan form of Buddhism,
called Lamaism. But Mongolia is
unusual among shamanist regions in
having early, non-European written
sources. The Secret History of the
Mongols and the works of the Arab
traveller Rashid Al-Din show that,
while Mongolian shamanism a thou¬
sand years ago was in many ways simi¬
lar to that which is practised today, its
SIBERIA AND MONGOLIA 37
social and political significance was
constantly changing. Mongolia was
twice subjected to Buddhist missionar¬
ies, while the Chinese court shared the
cult of the sky with the tribes of the hin¬
terland. The sky is male and the source
of good fortune and military success. It
is often referred to as a father and the
Mongol chief Genghis Khan claimed to
be the Son of the Sky. The association
of the sky with the male line also led to
an emphasis on military fortune. For a
shaman to claim to be able to go there
by himself was to venture into a politi¬
cally sensitive area and so this kind
of shamanism would tend to be found
in small backwaters, such as among
a tribe of hunters, rather than in the
more central regions of empires.
Shamanic traditions have also under¬
gone fierce suppression this century
under Communism (see pp. 136-7).
Shamanism in this region is closely
related to religions and beliefs found in
two very different parts of the world.
Northern America was probably first
peopled from Siberia, by hunters who
crossed the Bering Strait when it was a
land bridge. The shamanism of the
Eskimos of the American north is
almost identical to that of the Eskimo
and the Chukchi
on the Siberian side
of the water. The
shamanic tradi¬
tion in Mongolia
is close to the pre
Buddhist Tibetan
religion of bon-po
and to various
forms of religion
that can still be
found in Nepal
and other parts of
South and South- g Mongolian ongon, or
east Asia. receptacle for spirits.



38 REGIONAL TRADITIONS
South and East Asia
In religious terms this is the most com¬
plex region of the world, the home of
the ancient religions of Buddhism,
Hinduism, Confucianism, Taoism and
Shintoism as well as host to long-estab¬
lished and locally adapted forms of
Islam and Christianity. Throughout
these diverse and powerful religious tra¬
ditions run strands of human contact
with spirits, many of them probably
older than any of these great religions
with their written texts and institution¬
alized structures. Almost everywhere in
the region, daily life is coloured by the
presence of spirit possession, exorcism,
black magic, oracles and prayers
involving spirit mediums, holy men,
wise women, monks, yogis, seers, divin¬
ers and priests. Many of these practices
involve trance.
However, in all the confusion it is
easy to lose sight of any shamanic ele¬
ments. Religious specialists like the
North American medicine-man would
not be called shamans here because the
sheer volume of religious activity and
the richness of traditions give each kind
of specialist a distinct identity and
domain of action. In Siberia, most spe¬
cialists are called “shamans” by out¬
siders simply because the religion of the
region as a whole has been labelled
“shamanism”, but in local languages
the terms are distinct. The “white
shamans” of the Yakut and Buryat cor¬
respond to figures who further south
would be called “priests”. In South and
East Asia the definition of shamanism
is tested to its limits but still varies from
place to place with the traditions that
have grown up among outsiders for dis¬
cussing each part of the region. Thus, in
Nepal, the term “shaman” is reserved
for people who make soul journeys sim¬
ilar to those found in Siberia and
Mongolia, whereas in Korea it is used
for female mediums who control their
trances but do not make soul journeys.
In Nepal, soul flight is found more
among the central Asian peoples of the
Himalayas than among the Hindus in
the southern plains. Throughout the
Hindu-culture area, trance is common¬
ly caused by spirit possession without
soul flight. Trance specialists in general
are contrasted with the sober priest¬
hood of Brahmins, who receive their
vocation by heredity and through the

painstaking study of holy books.
However, there is one form of relation¬
ship to the Hindu gods through ecstasy
or trance called bhakti, which often
involves driving metal hooks into the
body or walking on red-hot coals. This
“way of devotion” is considered by
many to be equally valid but distinct
from the “way of knowledge” of textu¬
al scholars. However, it is not shaman¬
ism and does not involve soul flight,
which in India is generally found only
among marginal tribal people. While
Hinduism and Buddhism maintain that

well correspond to religious beliefs in

The ancient shamanistic religion of
Tibet, called bon-po, has been absorbed
into the Tibetan form of Mahayana
Buddhism called Lamaism, and is
probably the origin of Lamaism’s
numerous demons and elaborate forms
of exorcism. Throughout the
Theravada Buddhist countries too,
such as Sri Lanka, Burma and
Thailand, a contrast exists in principle
between the pure and austere doctrine
taught by the Buddha and the world of
the lay population, whose health, agri¬
culture, love life and even examination
results are constantly affected by gods,
demons and other spirits. Many
Buddhist monks are also intimately
involved in sorcery and exorcism.

SHAMANS IN HINDU
AND TRIBAL INDIA
The complex nature of
shamanism in this region is
illustrated by the Sora, an
aboriginal jungle tribe in
Orissa, India. Here there
are two kinds of shamans
who travel to the underworld
during trances.
The “great” shamans, who
are mostly women, conduct
funerals while the “lesser”
shamans, mostly men,
perform divinations and
cures. During trance the Sora
shaman’s soul vacates her or
his body, which is used by a
succession of dead persons to
speak and engage the living
in dialogues. Each kind of
shaman has a different
tradition of helper spirits,
stretching in an unbroken
chain back to an original
founder at the beginning of
time. The work of the two
kinds of shaman intertwines,
since it is the funeral which
reveals which kind of spirit
each dead person has
become, while divinations
and cures work out which
dead person is attacking the
patient and then fends that
person off with a sacrificial
offering. The funeral shaman
has a number of assistants
who light funeral pyres,
dance, sing and impersonate
ancestors in pantomime. All
these people can be called
kuran, the same word as the
shamans themselves. This is
the opposite situation from
the Siberian Yakut (see p.25),
where every kind of specialist
tends to operate separately
and has a separate name.
Here, by contrast, the
emphasis seems to be on

what all specialists have in
common as they each play
their own part in the
collective drama of the
shamanic rite. Although the
Sora live a separate life from
their Hindu neighbours, their
shamanism reflects a close
involvement stretching over
thousands of years. Each
village has a hereditary earth
priest whose performance
does not involve trance. This
resembles a widespread
pattern throughout Hindu
India, in which people chosen
and possessed by spirits are
contrasted with the sober
hereditary priesthood of the
Brahmins. In addition, Sora
shamans acquire their
shamanic powers by
marrying Hindu spirits in
the underworld. These spirits
belong to the high castes
of warriors and kings who
for centuries have wielded
political and economic power
over the Sora.



SOUTH AND EAST ASIA 41
Islam and sometimes Christianity. As in
India, shamanism is often the religion
of earlier, aboriginal tribes such as the
Temiar and Batek of Indonesia or the
hill tribes of Vietnam. As in Siberia,
however, shamanic behaviour is very
strongly influenced by its relations with
centres of state power, and shamanism
seems equally to be a religion of com¬
munities, such as the Wana of
Indonesia, which are not so much abo¬
riginal as distant from such centres.
In China and Japan, full-scale
shamanism with soul flight seems to
have been much more common in the
past than it is today. Huang-Ti, the
Yellow Emperor who is credited with
writing a classic work on acupuncture,
flew up to heaven on a dragon with sev¬
enty of his wives and councillors. This
kind of journey symbolized a Chinese
emperor’s power to rule. The achieve¬
ment of trance through dancing and
transformation into a bird seems simi¬
lar to Siberian shamanism, except that
the predominance in Siberia of male
shamans, using the masculine imagery
of the hunter, gives way to a strong
female tradition. In ancient China,
female shamans feature as founders of
dynasties. In Japan, shamanistic posses¬
sion among women has continued to
this day but has been diluted by
Shintoism, while many women now
choose to join new religions such as
Dojo, which is based on possession and
exorcism. The tendency to female
shamanism is greatest in Korea, where
all shamans are women apart from a
minority of men, who dress as women.
Generally, it is probably fair to say that
in those parts of eastern Asia where
women shamans are more prominent,
the soul journey is absent and the defi¬
nition of people as shamans rests on
their control of spirits while in trance.

MORTIFICATION OF THE FLESH
In Sri Lanka, both Hindus and Buddhists
practise mortification of the flesh as a form of
offering, perhaps because a god has answered
their prayer to save their child’s life or to get
them a good examination grade. They walk on
carpets of red-hot coals and pass metal darts
called vels, “lances”, through
tongue, or hang suspended
from a scaffold by metal
hooks in their backs.
Participants generally feel
no pain. Penitents some¬
times enter trance, but this
is not shamanism: it is part
of a wider pattern of
Hinduism and Buddhism.

In this region, shamanic soul-flight
occurs mainly in the Arctic and sub
Arctic. Among Eskimo peoples,
shamans function very much as they do
in northern Siberia. For such shamans,
dismemberment, dramatic flights
through the air and journeys to the bot¬
tom of the sea are common. Further
down the Northwest Coast, one enters
a region which is culturally very varied,
in which trance and spirit-journeying
ares not universally found. Among var¬
ious peoples, the shaman may rescue
the soul of a patient by travelling along
the path of the old ancestors to the land
of the dead, making an opening in the
surface of the ground, or diving to the
sea-bed and returning with blood
streaming from the nose and carrying
the patient’s soul in a little bundle of
eagle down. By contrast, in the canoe
journey of the Salish, a group of
shamans do not enter trance but mime
the journey to retrieve their patient's
animal guardian-spirit.
Further south, deep trance and soul
journey are rare, and the nature of initi¬
ation changes. Rather than by undergo¬
ing the Siberian experience of involun¬
tary torture and dismemberment by the
spirits, shamans often seek initiation
deliberately through isolation and fast¬
ing. The role of trance and journeying
is taken by dreaming or by a “vision

quest”, especially m the Plains area.
Young men, and sometimes women, go
into the wilderness and fast for some
days to seek a vision from the spirits.
This procedure may be followed by all
young people as a form of initiation
into adulthood. Lame Deer, of the
Lakota Sioux, recalls, “All of a sudden
... I heard the cry of an eagle, loud
above the voices of many other birds. It
seemed to say, ‘We have been waiting
for you. We knew you would come ...
You will have a ghost with you always
another self.’”
The question remains as to whether
such people are really shamans. Even in
those places where everyone undergoes
an initiation and seeks a vision, there
are more professional people who
develop their visions further, so that

THE SPIRIT CANOE OF
THE SALISH SHAMANS
Among the coastal Salish on
the border of Washington
State and Canada, several
shamans join together to
form a spirit canoe in order
to travel to the underworld
and retrieve a patient’s
animal guardian-spirit. At
night, the shamans form two
imaginary canoes. Each
shaman holds a pole or
paddle and the canoe also
contains a cedarwood board
with paintings of its owner’s
vision of a spirit canoe.
Accompanied by drums,
rattles and singing, the
shamans’ souls sink beneath
the earth each in turn singing
their own guardian-spirit
song. After they have
retrieved the patient’s
guardian, they return it to
the patient who then gets up
and dances.
The Salish shaman canoe
has become widely known
through the work of Michael
Harner, who has adapted it
for use in neo-shamanic
workshops. Here, the
participants in the workshop
form the crew of the canoe
while the role of shaman is
played by one, trained person
who sits inside the canoe next
to the patient. The others
keep watch around them
during the voyage.

SHAMANS AMONG ESKIMO PEOPLES
Eskimo peoples include the Greenlanders and
a few villagers in Siberia, but most inhabit
the American Arctic. Each of the different
Eskimo-speaking peoples has its own name for
itself - the main political and linguistic groups
are the Kalaalit, the Inuit, the Inupiat and
the Yupik - and the word “Eskimo” is now
considered insulting among some groups such
as the Inuit (“genuine people”) of Canada.
o Miles 2000
CJHHTT

Because of this, the term “Inuit ' has been used
interchangeably with “Eskimo", but this is not
really satisfactory because it is not a collective
word for all the groups.
The Eskimo are almost entirely a coastal
people and their traditional religion is based
on fishing and hunting. All became Christian
under the influence of early missionaries,
although some are abandoning Christianity
again as they begin to reassert their traditional
belief systems. As the Eskimo’s early contact
with Europeans grew, they
grafted a a commercial
trapping economy on to the
subsistence pattern of their
lives. Nevertheless, the
elements in the Arctic
especially beyond the northern
tree-line are harsh and the
supply of animals uncertain. In
winter and spring the
traditional Eskimo lifestyle
involved hunting whales, seals
and walrus. In the summer and
autumn they might sometimes
move inland, and live off herds
of caribou. Everyday rites
among a community which
was seldom more than several
hundred strong were
generally conducted by
laypersons, while shamans
specialized in dealing with a
crisis, such as starvation. The
shaman negotiated with the
spirits of non-human life forms
such as game animals, the
dead, and various monsters.

clear distinctions remain between
laypersons and specialists. In terms of
healing, there are two main kinds of
specialist who deal with two different
causes of illness. If the patient is ill
because their soul has been kidnapped
and taken away by spirits, this produces
unconsciousness or some similar seri¬
ous disturbance and the healer’s own
soul enters trance in order to set off and
retrieve it. But if the illness has been
caused by the intrusion of a foreign
object sent by a sorcerer, the patient
generally suffers physical pain rather
than mental disturbance. The healer
does not usually enter trance but
extracts the object by massage or by
sucking, whether directly by mouth or
through a special tube made of straw,
birdbone or other material. The healer
may then display the object to the
patient and onlookers. The first kind of
healer is a shaman by any definition,
while the second is better called a med¬
icine-man or medicine-woman. Sorcery,
or black magic, is widely atributed to
shamans, and Henry, the last tradition¬
al Washo shaman from the California
Nevada border, made a conscious
choice to avoid these prac¬
tices in his own life’s work.
North America is the only
part of the world, apart
from some areas of tropical
Asia that were under British
colonial influence, for which
the very rich ethnography
on shamanism is freely avail¬
able in English. Popular
summaries cannot do justice
to the many classic anthro¬
pological descriptions writ¬
ten around the end of
the 19th century, although
native religion was widely
repressed until at least the
mid-20th century. Recently there have
been revivals among native peoples as
well as movements among urban whites
based on their understanding of these
traditions and their own needs (see
pp. 150-53). Native writers and spiritual
teachers now often present their own
versions of native traditions. Like the
accounts by earlier anthropologists,
current interpretations of shamanism
are inevitably coloured by the precon¬
ceptions and agendas of their time.

THE MIDEWIWIN
LODGE
In the Midewiwin ceremony
of the Ojibway (shown in a
birch-bark drawing, right), a
lodge symbolizes the
universe, with its four sides
representing the cardinal
directions. A stone near the
eastern entrance represents
the permanent presence of
the powerful manitou spirit,
and a post portrays the
cosmic tree breaking through
the levels of the cosmos. The
state of trance is open to
anyone, but a shaman, who
must go through eight stages
of initiation, becomes
particularly powerful - the
later stages are considered
psychologically dangerous
because of the awesome
powers contacted. The
shaman-initiate lies down
and a special kind of shell is
placed on various parts of his
body in order to localize the
manitou there. The shaman
members of the society then
symbolically shoot him in
these places, while the candidate re-enacts the state
of trance of the solitary
visionary in the wilderness.



46 REGIONAL TRADITIONS
South and Central America
The shaman is a
dominant figure in
a great many native
Central and South
American societies.
Despite the great
distance from the
Bering Strait, South American
shamanism bears
striking similarities
to the forms of shamanism in Siberia,
from where the native Americans migrat¬
ed. Cosmologies are often layered, with
a world tree or pillar, and shamans fly
to upper and lower worlds. Shamanic
initiation often involves an initial sick¬
ness, the experience of being dismem¬
bered or reduced to a skeleton, use of
numerous helper spirits and marriage
to a spirit spouse. The similarities to
Siberia are perhaps the strongest evi¬
dence for the basic durability of
shamanic ideas over the widest range
of environments, social structures and
historical periods. Yet South American shamanism also
has some highly distinctive features.
Perhaps the most important is the elab¬
orate use of hallucinogenic plants to
induce trance and visions. About one
hundred plants are used in the
Americas, although the range of avail¬
able psychotropic plants is probably no
greater than in the Old World, where
they are used much less. Some common
hallucinogenic plants, such as datura
and peyote, are also used in southern
North America, but it is in South
America that the most species are used,
and the most intensively. In Central
America, the Mazatec use psilocybe

HOW SHAMANS TURN INTO JAGUARS
A distinctive feature of
Amazonian shamanism is the
close identification between
the shaman and the jaguar,
and in many languages they
are called by variants
of the same name. Shamans
may turn into jaguars by
singing spells, putting on
jaguar ornaments, teeth and
skins, or by taking
hallucinogenic drugs. Guahibo
shamans keep their
hallucinogenic snuff in a
hollow jaguar
bone with a
stopper at
each end.
Shamans
may also
become
jaguars
for good when they die. Like
the Siberian loon, a bird
whose form is adopted by
shamans, but much more
powerful and aggressive, the
jaguar is a creature which can
move freely on land, above
ground and in the water. It
climbs huge trees in the
manner of a shaman’s soul
and is also a superb swimmer,
so that many peoples believe
in water-jaguars which live at
the bottom of rivers and who
can be reached only by
shamans. A Peruvian
vegetalista may protect
himself with a spell:
Where are you coming from,
offspring of the black jaguar?
You nourish the earth with the
milk ofyour breasts,
In this way you came forth.

Among the Desana, the
shaman turns into a jaguar
after taking a particularly
large dose of snuff. After
months of fasting and
sleepless nights spent
chanting, a group of novices
will be called together by
their living teacher. It is at
this point that the snuff
itself “chooses” who is to
become a true shaman. One
must have courage and
determination when taking
the snuff. Some novices
merely feel violently sick,
while others pass on through
their headache and dizziness
and turn into jaguars. While
their bodies lie in their
hammocks, their souls soar
up to the Milky Way or roam
the jungle. These shamans
devour their enemies, and
even the ordinary jaguars of
the jungle become more fierce
and dangerous.

mushrooms to induce hallucinations,
while the Huichol religion is based
around the peyote cactus, which is
“hunted” as if it were a deer. Tobacco,
although strictly speaking not hallu¬
cinogenic, is widely considered a sacred
plant and tobacco smoke is often used
in ritual for purification.
The South American shaman is dis¬
tinguished from the ordinary person
through mastery of trance and soul
flight. These lead to the acquisition of
helper spirits and of songs and chants.
Chants are particularly powerful in this
region as expressions of the shaman’s
power and it seems that shamans can
sometimes achieve altered states of con¬
sciousness through melodies alone. A
shaman may lose this power through
becoming contaminated, violating a
taboo or being attacked by a more
powerful shaman. The shaman’s power
must be constantly cultivated and its
loss may lead to illness and perhaps
death. Among peoples such as the
Matsigenka, Siona, Kagwahiv and
Shipibo-Conibo, ordinary peoples are
thought to possess shamanic power,
which increases as they grow into
adults. Those who go on to train as
shamans are those who increase this
power to the point where they can use it
to intervene in the many processes that
are governed by spirits.
There are many kinds of shaman.
Among the Wakuenai, owners of
chants do not take hallucinogenic
plants and are distinguished from those
who do. Among the Desana, the
shaman who takes hallucinogens turns
into a jaguar and is distinguished from
the shaman who owns chants and heals
by singing the names of plants, animals
and spirits, as well as from another kind
of shaman who can travel in the aquat¬
ic realms of the universe. Shamanism is
closely allied to sorcery and often there
are no separate terms for the shaman
who heals and the shaman who harms.
This ambiguity in the shaman may be
specially marked in communities where

RATTLES
While the drum is
the instrument of
shamanism in
Siberia, it is joined in
North America by
the rattle (right). In
South America the
rattle takes over
almost completely.
Just as the Siberian
drum is thought to
be made from the
world tree, so the
handle of the South
American rattle is
held to symbolize
this tree, while the
hollow gourd of the
rattle is often
thought to represent
the cosmos. The
seeds or pebbles
inside are spirits and
souls of ancestors.
Shaking the rattle
activates these spirits
who will then assist
the shaman.
shaman from other worlds is particu¬
larly important and authoritative as a
source of morality and social control.
The quality of being a shaman is not so
much a fixed role as an expression of
the kind of power which he or she has.

native and European ancestry and
speak Spanish as their mother tongue.
They have lost their Indian ethnic iden¬
tity but continue to practise a form of
shamanism which is typical of the
upper Amazon region.
The Huichol people of Central Mexico (left)
take peyote cactus to achieve hallucinogenic
visions, in which they often see the stories for
their brightly coloured yarn paintings. In the
example below, a horned shaman rises to the sky
world. A wise Huichol ancestor can rejoin the
living as a rock crystal, and this ancestral soul
may be put into a fermented drink that is
consumed by a living shaman.
America has been very violent and in
many ways this violence continues.
Shamanic ideas have featured in some
social and revolutionary movements.
The Wakuenai on the border of Brazil
and Venezuela have a long history of
belief in Messiahs and during the 19th
century the messianic leader Venancio
Kamiko used indigenous shamanic
imagery to protest at white invasion of
Indian territory. Shamanism is not con¬
fined to purely Indian communities.

vegetalista because of their skill with



50 REGIONAL TRADITIONS
The rest of the world
Shamanic motifs occur throughout the
world, although usually there are not
enough of them in one place to make
up an entire shamanic complex. A fre¬
quent motif is that of a tree or ladder
connecting earth and heaven. The
European story of Jack and the
beanstalk closely resembles a Yakut
shaman’s rescue of the woman abduct¬
ed as a prospective bride by the raven¬
headed people in the sky (see p.101).
The princess is captured and taken to
the giant’s castle in the clouds; Jack
climbs up there, does battle with the
giant and saves the princess. The main
difference is that, as we now tell it, this
story is not the foundation of a society
and a system of morality.
Shamanic motifs acquire a moral
dimension wherever the emphasis is on
the gulf between this world and heaven.
The Dinka of southern Sudan, whose
religion is in some ways reminiscent of
the Old Testament, say that earth and
sky were once very close together but
that human misdeeds caused the sky to
move far away, so that bridging the gap
has become a problem. In this light,
Christ himself can be seen as a kind of
shaman as he travels between heaven
and earth in order to bring about the
moral salvation of humanity.
In most African cultures, people do
not travel to the spirits’ world. Instead
the spirits come to this world, and
trance occurs when people are pos¬
sessed, rather than when they call the
spirits and control them, as in shaman¬
ism. However, many people among the
Bushmen of the Kalahari are able to
climb to the sky, and it is possible that
shamanic ideas are more widespread
than is generally acknowledeged.
Among some Australian Aborigines,
a shaman is initiated by spirits, who dis¬
member him. In some areas they kill
him, open up his body and place rock
crystals and other powerful substances
inside. Shamans are also active in the
New Guinea Highlands. The Sambia
say that weaker shamans can perform
healing, divination and sorcery whereas
only strong shamans can make soul
journeys and perform exorcisms. Here
and throughout the Highlands,
shamans are closely involved in the con¬
stant warfare between communities,
and much of their effort is spent trying
to kill enemies by magically projecting

splinters of bone and teeth, as well as
undoing the effects of other people’s
sorcery on their own community.
There are also traces of shamanic
themes in the European past. The
German god Odin underwent an ordeal
of initiation by hanging in the world
tree, Yggdrasil. He could also change
into various animals and travel to dis¬
tant places. Related themes occur in



Jacob’s Ladder, painted by Sidney Nolan
(b.1917). The biblical story emphasizes the gap
between heaven and earth. Rungs are widely
used in Christian and Islamic mysticism to
symbolize the stages of the soul’s ascent to God.
THE REST OF THE WORLD 51
Celtic and Norse mythology. But even
the religious historian Eliade admits
that these do not necessarily add up to
entire systems of shamanism. However,
the Saami, or Lapps, of northern
Scandinavia did have a form of
shamanic practice very like that of
Siberia until it was repressed by the
authorities in the 17th and 18th cen¬
turies. The old Saami religion is proba¬
bly related to their historical connec¬
tions with tribes further east around the
Ural mountains.
Ancient Greek culture contains strik¬
ing shamanistic elements, and attempts
have also been made to trace these to
eastern roots, through the Scythian
tribes of the Russian and Central Asian
steppes. Orpheus, like Hercules, went to
the underworld to retrieve the soul of
someone who had died young (see
pp.99). This type of journey involved
typical shamanic themes of overcoming
guardians and obstacles, and negotiat¬
ing with the king of the underworld.
AN AFRICAN BUSHMAN
CLIMBS TO THE SKY
The Bushman says: “The
giraffe came and took me off
again. We came to a river and
I swam down it with my head
downstream. Then my
protector told me that I
would be able to cure people
by going into trance. We
entered the earth and when
we emerged we began to
climb up a thread to the sky.
Up there in the sky the spirits
and the dead people sing for
me so that I can dance. If a
person dies, I carry him on
my back, I dance him so that
God will give his spirit to me
and then I put his spirit back
into his body. When you
approach God, all sorts of
mambas, pythons, bees and
locusts bite you. And when
you return into your body
you go ‘He-e-e-ef This is the
sound of you getting back
into your body.” Ancient
bushman rock art, such as
the giraffe from the Erongo
Mountains (below), may refer
to such shamanic experiences.



Becoming a Shaman
The shamans activities depend closely on the
ability to sweep the audience along with the
power of his or her performance, which must
have its effect both on the audience and on
the shaman. Shamans use many props and
symbols to represent their psychic experience
and to affect the experience of their clients.
Magar shamans from Nepal such as those
shown here use special costumes, feathers of
powerful birds, and drums and bells to create
hypnotic musical effects, as well as the poetic
language of spells and prayers.
The shaman is chosen by the spirits, and in
the central experience of initiation is often
symbolically killed by the spirits and reborn.
Through this experience, the personality of
the shaman is enhanced and this is expressed
through the acquisition of the spirit helpers
who enable the shaman to voyage across the
cosmos. Other, hostile spirits represent the
negative side of the client or even of the
shamans own personality. The shaman
“death” may be repeated or echoed on a
smaller scale each time the shaman performs.

54 BECOMING A SHAMAN
Who becomes a shaman?
The shaman is a neurotic
and a psychopath; the
shaman is the sanest per¬
son in society, deeply
sensitive to the moods of
others; the shaman is a
showman, conjuror and
charlatan. All of these
conflicting characteris¬
tics are regularly ascribed
to shamans by observers,
and all of them involve
many assumptions about
the shaman’s personality
and psychology. In view
of the arduous nature of
the shaman’s calling, it is
probably true that a dis¬
tinctive personality is
required, but the nature
of this may vary. Siberian cultures
demanded great emotional and physical
strength and it was sometimes even said
that a man who had lost his teeth could
no longer be a shaman. Yet a tearful,
spindly child among the Sora may have
the ability to see spirits
and be earmarked for
the calling.
In native Americans,
shamanic powers may
be spread widely. In
parts of Amazonia a
large proportion of the
male population are
shamans, though some
may be more powerful
than others and initia¬
tion often amounts to
an essential stage in the
development of adult
male identity. The North
American vision quest
often functioned in a
similar way, and the Sun
Dance was explicitly
combined with annual puberty rites.
The shaman’s special powers may be
inherent in a person from birth, in
which case they must be brought to
light; or else the person may have a pre¬
disposition or potential for shamanship

Siberia, beating a decorated drum
to call her helper spirits.
A SIBERIAN SHAMAN
PLAYS HIS DRUM
“Putting his head down inside
the drum, the shaman starts
to sing quietly. He sings
slowly and dolefully. He
strikes the drum in various
places with quiet, spaced-out
strokes. One gets the
impression that he is calling
someone, collecting his
helpers and summoning them
from a great distance.
Sometimes he hits the drum
hard and utters a few words.
This means that one of his
helpers has just arrived. Bit
by bit the song becomes
louder and the drumstick
strikes more often. This
means that all the spirits have
heard their masters
summons and are coming
towards him in a throng.
Finally the blows become
very powerful and it seems as
if the drum will split. The
shaman is no longer looking
at the inside of the drum but
is singing at the top of his
voice. Now all the spirits
have been gathered up.
Without stopping his song,
the shaman puts on his
breastplate. He stands on the
spot bending down slightly
and tapping his foot.” The
drum responded to the touch
of the drumstick with the
most diverse sounds, from
thunderous beats with the
sharp clang of iron to the
most delicate rustling, a
continuous soft hum,
accompanied by a light
jingling. The shaman also
used the drum as a sounding
board to deflect the waves of
noise so that in the darkness
it seemed as if his voice was
moving from one corner to
another and from below to
above and back again.

and must somehow acquire the power.
The two states are not always clearly
distinguished. The Washo shaman
Henry grew up surrounded by two
shamans, a brother-in-law and an uncle;
both of whom he respected and adored.
As a child, he would dream that a bear
was looking at him and then he would
fly up towards the moon. He was later
taken away to a brutal boarding school
run by the US Army and designed to
de-culture native children, but while
sleeping in the dormitory there he
received the power dream that set him



56 BECOMING A SHAMAN
on his path to becom¬
ing a shaman. His
spirit helper, Water,
was not inherited from
his relatives, but the
inclination to shaman
hood was surely affect¬
ed by his childhood
closeness to them.
In Mongolia and
Siberia the element of
inheritance is often
made explicit, particu¬
larly where the male
lineage is important. The Mongol
shaman had an hereditary right or
quality called udkha which was traced
back to the celestial origin of his line.
Tengriin udkha was the udkha that sig¬
nified descent from the sky god Tengri,
Ner’jeer udkha signified descent from
an ancestor who was struck by a thun¬
derbolt. The udkha was also the mark
of shamanism as a profession: black¬
smiths had a comparable hereditary
udkha of their own. In Mongolia, as in
some other parts of Asia with a history
of states and empires, the hereditary
rights of shamans and rulers were
transmitted in a similar way. Genghis
Khan was conceived when a shaft of
light from the sky god entered his
mother’s tent and
impregnated her. He
later interpreted this as
giving him the right to
conquer all the earth,
just as his father ruled
the sky.
Among the Sora, the
main shamans are
mostly female. Their
power comes partly
from the way in which
they operate in a soci¬
ety whose lineages are
male-centred. Like
ordinary women, a
shaman will marry a
man from a different
lineage and will bear
children to that lin¬
eage. But in order to
gain her shamanic
power she will also
marry an underworld
spirit, who represents
her own brother. He is
the spirit son of her
predecessor, who is
her own aunt. The shaman in turn will
bear a spirit son who will marry her
successor. While the children she bears
in the outside world are lost from her
lineage to her husband’s lineage, the
child she bears to her spirit husband
through an act of symbolic incest
allows her shamanic power to be
retained by her own lineage.
The shaman’s power may also be
bought, as in parts of the upper
Amazon. But most traditions empha¬
size that it is the spirits themselves who
choose who is to become a shaman.
Henry was chosen, but also paid an
older shaman to teach him the tech¬
niques that he lacked. Selection by the
spirits is crucial. Even with a principle
of heredity, a
shaman’s relatives and
descendants will be
numerous and it is
often not clear who
should inherit the gift.
The spirits of the pre¬
vious shaman may
wander out of control,
as among the Evenk
of Siberia, seeking
new hosts and causing
widespread illness. In
many regions the

WHO BECOMES A SHAMAN? 57
A LITTLE SORA GIRL’S
APPRENTICESHIP
While other people’s attention wanders, an
apprentice shaman watches her teacher
intently during her trance. The future shaman
is escorted during her dreams by spirits to the
underground land of the dead. The journey is
frightening, but the spirits are kind and
reassuring. As the dreams become more
regular and less disturbing, they lose their
fearsome quality. Around puberty, the girl will
marry an underworld spirit and begin to
develop the ability to visit the underworld at will, by means of trance.
A Sora woman becomes a shaman late in life,
because there is no suitable young girl available.
The shaman is supported by a bystander.
future shaman may be approached in
dreams and visions by spirits who sug¬
gest that he or she should take on this
role. Commonly, the person falls seri¬
ously ill and comes to understand the
spirits’ intentions during the course of
this illness. It may be an illness such as
smallpox, which without modern medi¬
cine is normally fatal. But for prospec¬
tive shamans the disease leads to an
acceptance of their new role which
allows them to be healed and so to
heal others.
The Yakut believed that
a shaman could cure only
those diseases whose
spirits had tasted that
shaman’s flesh during
initiation. Throughout
Siberia and in many
regions, people may suffer from
a quite distinctive “shamanic ill¬
ness”, in which they appear to go
out of their minds, babbling gib¬
berish, rushing naked across the
landscape with no regard for their
own safety, or spending weeks up a
tree or lying motionless on the
ground. During this period, the peo¬
ple refuse to undertake the onerous
life of a shaman and are pur- A Tungus shaman

who are determined to make them
capitulate. Almost always, the initiate
gives in, but the struggle can be bitter
and can last for years. The spirits
threaten that if the candidate continues
to refuse, he or she will continue to be
tortured by them and will eventually be
killed. Thus, the shamanic “gift” and
the so-called “mastery” of spirits are
double-edged: they are not active¬
ly sought but are rather imposed
against the shaman’s will, and as
well as granting power also
cause lifelong anguish. A
similar view prevails in
many shamanic cultures.
The imagery of pursuit
by the spirits is sometimes
sexual. We have seen that
the Sora shaman gains her
power through an incest¬
uous marriage that takes
place in the underworld. One
male shaman among the
Nanai (or Goldi) on the
Siberian-Chinese border was
approached during his illness
by a very beautiful woman
who said, “I am the spirit who
has chosen you. I taught your
ancestors to be shamans
and now I have come to



58 BECOMING A SHAMAN
teach you. The old shamans have died
and now there is nobody to heal peo¬
ple... I love you and you must be my
husband. I shall give you spirit helpers
and they will help you to heal... If you
don’t obey me, too bad for you - I shall
kill you”. Female Nanai shamans are
similarly visited by male spirits. This
aspect of the shaman’s experience may
very well be linked to sexual fantasy
and frustration. In sev¬
eral parts of the world,
the spirit husbands of
female shamans are
often said to be lusty,
and are able to bring
about orgasm in their
shaman wives during
trances and dreams.
Some studies link this
phenomenon to the
inability of the living
husbands to satisfy
their women sexually.
In whatever way the
shaman is initially
selected, he or she will
come to fit into an
order which is com¬
pletely different from
the order of most other
people’s everyday life. Just as among
the Wayapi people, shamans and cer¬
tain trees are both paye, or imbued with
shamanic spirit, so the Guajiro of
Amazonia say that a person becoming
a shaman becomes pulasu, a word
which also means “spirit” (unusually
for South America, most Guajiro
shamans are women). It is not that the
shaman actually becomes a spirit, but
rather that she joins a
range of other phe¬
nomena in this world
which are also called
pulasu because they
bear witness to the
constant hidden pres¬
ence of the other
world. One sign that
someone has been
chosen by the spirits is
that she develops an
allergy to the meat of
some particular ani¬
mal which for her is
a metamorphosis or
messenger of a being
in the other world. The
way to say “I am aller¬
gic to turtle” is “turtle
is pulasu for me".

hands she holds the patient’s sickness,
which she is about to throw away.
DYUKHADE CHOSEN BY THE SPIRITS
Dyukhade, a great shaman during the 1930s
among the Nganasan people in northwest
Siberia, declared: “I became a shaman even
before I saw the light of day. Before she
became pregnant, my mother had a dream in
which she became the wife of the Smallpox
Spirit. She woke and told her family that her
future child was to become a shaman through
this spirit. When I grew up a little I fell ill for
three years. During this illness I was escorted
through various dark places where I was
thrown now into water, now into fire. At the
end of the third year 1 was dead to the world
and lay motionless for three days. It was only
on the third day that I woke up again, when
they were getting ready to bury me. During
those three days, while the people around
thought 1 was dead, I went through my
initiation. I reached the middle of the sea and
heard a voice saying, ‘You will receive your gift
from the Master of the Water. Your shamanic
name will be Loon [a diving bird].' 1 came out
of the water and went along the shore. 1 saw a
naked woman lying on her side. This was the
Mistress of the Water. I begun to suck her
breast. She said. ‘So my child has appeared.
I'll let him drink his fill, my child has surely
come out of great need and exhaustion." "



BECOMING A SHAMAN 59
Initiation and instruction
For a prospective shaman the initial
approach by the spirits must be fol¬
lowed up by a period of instruction.
Illness itself becomes a means to learn¬
ing and understanding, as the future
shaman is introduced to helper spirits,
shown around the realm of the spirits
where he or she will have to operate so
decisively, warned of possible enemies
and shown the true nature of diseases
and misfortunes to be combated.
Especially in Siberia and Mongolia,
the first approach by the spirits takes
the form of a violent onslaught which
leads to what seems like a complete
destruction of the future shaman’s per¬
sonality. This is followed by a rebuild¬
ing of the shaman, whose new powers
are not simply an external adjunct or
tool, but amount to a form of insight, a
perspective on the nature of the world,
and especially on the particular forms
of human suffering which he or she has
just undergone so intensely. The inter¬
nalization of all these experiences will
lead to the emergence of a new person¬
ality, and it is this which is expressed
through the destruction of the shaman’s
previous nature.
The candidate’s psychic experience is
expressed as a bodily dismantling. Tie
or she may see him- or herself as a
skeleton, a theme widely found in Asia
and the Americas. In Siberia every bone
and muscle is taken apart, counted and
put together again, while blood oozes
from the joints of the candidate’s inert
body as it lies in its tent surrounded by
anxious relatives. There are other ways
in which the shaman can become a
changed person, and the terror of the
experience can also be tempered with
exhilaration and delight.
In this painting by a former shaman, a Peruvian
vegetalista is shown being spiritually taken
apart by snakes called huatanruna. The two
spirits at the top spin like discs and act as
guardians for the shaman's heart.
One dark night, an Inuit (Canadian
Eskimo) woman called Uvavnuk was
struck by a meteor in the form of a ball
of fire. The fire entered her body and
she felt lit up from within by a glowing
spirit which was half human and half
polar bear. She lost consciousness for a



60 BECOMING A SHAMAN
period, and when she recovered
she entered her house
singing and intoxicated
with joy. Subsequently,
for much of the time she
remained an ordinary person,
but whenever she felt the power
of the meteor inside her she was
able to act as a great shaman.
Initiation need not always
be violent. In the North
American type of vision
quest, an essential rite of
passage in the lives of
many Plains peoples, a
boy typically sets out into the wilder¬
ness to fast and pray for a few days in
order to acquire a guardian spirit. This
spirit, often an animal, endows the boy
with its own characteristics, tells him
what to put into his medicine bun¬
dle, and teaches him
medicine songs that
,0 allow him to call on
the spirit and seek pro¬
tection in times of danger.
The initiation of a shaman does
not necessarily involve a single
dramatic moment, but can be a
cumulative process that lasts
throughout a lifetime. The
Sora shaman begins her
journeys to the under¬
world during her dreams
as a child. The little Sora
girl’s visits to the underworld are cer¬
tainly frightening, but there is no devas¬
tating dismemberment. As she reaches
adolescence, she will marry her spirit
husband and some time afterward will

DYUKHADE IS DISMEMBERED AND
THEN REBORN
The initiation of the Siberian shaman
Dyukhade reveals many of the themes of
shamanic death and rebirth. He describes the
ordeal in his own words: “The husband of the
Mistress of the Water, ‘the Great Underground
Master', told me that I would have to travel
the path of every illness. He gave me a stoat
and a mouse as my guides and together with
them I continued my journey further into the
underworld. My companions led me to a high
place where there stood seven tents. The
people inside these tents are cannibals,’ the
mouse and stoat warned me. Nevertheless I
went into the middle tent, and went crazy on
the spot. These were the Smallpox People.
They cut out my heart and threw it into a
cauldron to boil. Inside this tent I found the
Master of my Madness, in another tent I saw
the Master of Confusion, in another the
Master of Stupidity. I went around all these
tents and became acquainted with the paths of
various human diseases.
“After this I came to a wide, endless sea.
The shore had sparsely growing trees and
short grass. There I saw seven flat cliffs. When
I went up to one of them it opened wide.
Inside there appeared teeth like bear’s teeth
and a cavern like a box. ‘I am the stone that
weighs down the earth,’ announced the rock,
‘with my weight I hold down the turf of the
earth so that the wind does not lift it up.’ The
second cliff opened wide, saying, ‘Let all
people, both baptized and unbaptized, take the
stone from me and let them use it to smelt
iron.’ Then one after another all the other
cliffs opened wide and each one of them said
how it could be used by humanity. For seven
days l was held spellbound by these cliffs. It
was really they who gave me my instruction.
“Then I went through an opening in another
rock. A naked man was sitting there fanning
the fire with bellows. Above the fire hung an
enormous cauldron as big as half the earth.
When he saw me the naked man brought out a
pair of tongs the size of a tent and took hold
of me. He took my head and cut it off, and
then sliced my body into little pieces and put
them in the cauldron. There he boiled my
body for three years. Then he placed me on an
anvil and struck my head with a hammer and
dipped it into ice-cold water to temper it. He
took the big cauldron my body had been
boiled in off the fire and poured its contents
into another container. Now all my muscles
had been separated from the bones. Here I am

this sitting alongside an older, practis¬
ing shaman and it may be some time
before any spirit voices speak through
her. It would be difficult to determine at
what point she has become a fully initi¬
ated shaman, and some candidates may
not stay the course. One Korean teacher
of shamans says that no more than
three out of ten candidates succeed in
becoming fully-fledged shamans.
The theme of death in the shaman’s
initiation is completed by a rebirth, and
the shaman’s movement through cos¬
mic space is sometimes explicitly
likened to a return to the womb. As well
as being suckled at the breast of a spir¬
it mother, the Siberian shaman was
sometimes rocked by the spirits in an
iron cradle on a branch of the world
INITIATION AND INSTRUCTION 61
tree. Among the Alaskan Eskimo, the
underground passage into the igloo
clearly symbolizes the vaginal passage
into the womb, and the word ani means
both “to go out of an igloo” and “to be
born”. While one shaman was waiting
between lives to be reborn he felt that
the inside of his mother was like a little
igloo, but that the exit passage was so
small that he would have difficulty get¬
ting out. Only when he heard a voice
calling him to come out did he finally
force his way through the narrow pas¬
sage. In the same community, a fully
initiated shaman who was about to fly
out of the igloo during trance was
bound with a seal-line, representing the
umbilical cord, which ensured that his
departure would not be permanent.
It is this imagery which has allowed

my flesh, the blacksmith said to me, ‘Your
marrow has turned into a river,’ and inside the

to pull them out of the water with his tongs.

the shore the blacksmith put them together,
they became covered with flesh and my body

thing that was still left
unattached was my head.

eyes and put in new ones.

shamanic initiation resembles the ordi¬
nary initiation practised in the puberty
rites of many societies, in which every
adolescent is said to return to the womb
in order to be reborn, this time as a
fully-fledged adult, or in other words as
a more complete person than before.



INITIATION AND INSTRUCTION 63
Instead of being dismembered, a shaman may also be swallowed by a powerful animal during
initiation. In this drawing, a future shaman in Greenland is devoured by a giant polar bear.
Not all initiations are successful,
although the social expectations can be
so high that a candidate may be embar¬
rassed into lying. A young Winnebago
Indian early this century recalled,
“They said that if anyone fasted by the
black hawk’s nest for four nights he
would be blessed with victory and the
power to cure the sick. So I fasted there.
The first night, I wondered when things
would happen, but nothing took place.
The second night my father came and
we sang and prayed together, and I
wept as I prayed. Then I passed the
third day alone and my father came
again in the evening and we prayed
again. But still I experienced nothing
unusual. On the fourth day I went home
and told everyone that I had been
blessed and the spirits had told me to
eat. But I was not telling the truth. I
was hungry and they gave me the food
that is carefully prepared for those who
have been blessed. All I wanted was to
appear big in the eyes of people.” Years
later he went to a meeting of the peyote
cult {peyote is a hallucinogenic cactus).
Here too he failed at first to feel any
effect, but eventually, “I looked at the
peyote and there stood an eagle with
outspread wings. The eagle stood look¬
ing at me. Then I saw a lion lying down
and also looking at me. Then I prayed
to Earthmaker and said many things
that I would ordinarily never have spo¬
ken about.” Here at last was the vision
he had longed for but had felt inade¬
quate because he had never received it.
Spirits will start to speak through Sumbari

a succession of twenty-eight spirits passed
through her but did not speak at all. At the
same time, however, the spirits that were
passing through her father often turned aside
to address the silent spirits that were passing
through Sumbari. They gave detailed
instructions about kinship and social relations
in the world of the ancestors, knowledge which
will be the foundation of her future practice.

that of a possessed person, is mostly
highly controlled. This is probably due
to the nature of the initiation, which is
echoed and developed in ritual perfor¬
mances. The little Sora girl, clambering
down to the underworld in her dreams,
and the prospective Siberian shaman
who is abducted, tortured and dismem¬
bered in a vision, both repeat part of
their initiatory experiences every time
they make the journey in the course of
their work. During initiation, the future
shaman did not yet have the knowledge
and resources to withstand the strains
of what he or she was undergoing, and
the violence of the experience was
linked to the shaman's inability to con¬
trol it. Indeed, it was very similar to
involuntary possession. If initiation
marked the death of the self, ego or per¬
sonality, then in regular performances
the shaman now operates as a newly
formed and greatly enhanced person.
Trance is closely related to ecstasy.
These two words are often used indis¬
criminately, or else trance may be used
as a medical term concerned with a
person's physiological state and ecstasy
as a religious term for essentially the
same phenomenon. But the American
Trembling, shuddering, goose-flesh,
swooning, falling to the ground, yawn¬
ing, lethargy, convulsions, foaming at
the mouth, protruding eyes, insensitiv¬
ity to heat, cold and pain, tics, loud
breathing, a glassy stare... These are
some of the characteristics of trance.
How can these kinds of behaviour be
signs of a divine state? Although they
are disturbing to many, they are an
essential part of much shamanic activ¬
ity around the world.
The shaman’s state of mind during
initiation and performances is mysteri¬
ous. The state of trance seems to involve
a focusing of attention in one area
accompanied by a reduced awareness
of surroundings outside this focus.
Modern discussion of trance is often
cast in terms of one or more “altered
states of consciousness” or even a
“shamanic state of consciousness” (see
pp. 146-9). Some sort of trance is fun¬
damental to both shamanism and pos¬
session, but a shaman’s trance, unlike



TRANCE AND ECSTASY 65
A Kung Bushman of the Kalahari in a state of

anthropologist Rouget argues that
trance and ecstasy should be distin¬
guished as belonging to quite different
kinds of religious sensibility. While
ecstasy entails stillness, silence and soli¬
tude, trance depends on movement,
noise and company. Ecstasy involves
sensory deprivation, while trance if any¬
thing involves sensory overstimulation.
Rouget contrasts the marabouts, or
Muslim holy men, of Senegal, who
“seek out ecstasy in the silence, solitude
and darkness of their grottos”, with the
“practitioners of the ndop, who enter
into trance in the midst of a dense
crowd, stimulated by drink, agitated by
wild dancing and the din of drums”.
Even if we accept this distinction,
ecstasy and trance can co-exist in
many religions, and even individuals.
A Wana shaman from Indonesia lunges out to
catch the soul of a patient.
Shamans may sometimes use contem¬
plation, as in the North American
vision quest. Yet the idea of the cosmic
journey itself, with its struggle to over¬
come obstacles and enemies on the way,
explains why the shamanic experience
tends to be vigorous, especially in the
classic shamanism of hunting societies.
AWARENESS OF TWO WORLDS
Reports vary on how far a shaman’s
experience while in trance is remembered once
the shaman has returned to a normal state of
consciousness. As early as the 18th century, a
Russian traveller was told by a Yakut shaman
that he remembered nothing, and other
Siberian shamans have said the same this
century. On the other hand, an Altai shaman
acted as if waking from a deep sleep and
announced, “A safe journey! I was well
received!” In another account a Selkup
shaman picked himself up, smoked, drank tea
and then recounted his journey blow by blow.
Since trance is a cultural activity carried out
in front of an audience, shamans must either
dramatize their journey while it is happening
or report it afterwards. Shamans can show an
awareness of both worlds simultaneously. A
Sora woman shaman was in trance when her
baby started crying and the person holding it
tried to put it to the shaman’s breast. The
spirit inside her broke off its speech for a
moment and said, “No, I’m a male spirit,
wait until a female one arrives after me.”



66 BECOMING A SHAMAN
Helpers and teachers
Shamans cannot function unaided and
are dependent for their achievements
on helpers, so that their feats are not so
much superhuman as super-assisted.
Apart from living assistants who pre¬
pare equipment and play musical
instruments, spirit helpers can range
from a single wise ancestor, through
serried ranks of spirit soldiers armed
for battle, to a hallucinogenic plant.
Spirit helpers may convey the
shaman on a journey, like the crew of
the Wana shaman’s canoe described on
pp.71-2. Where the helper is an animal,
it may often serve as a vehicle itself by
carrying the shaman on its back.
Helpers may warn the shaman about
obstacles and enemies to be anticipated
on the journey and assist in removing
or fighting them. Often they provide the
shaman with magical abilities or
strengths which correspond to their
own properties. Tools and weapons
may have their own spirits, representing
their efficacy. Shamans may also send
helpful spirits as emissaries or servants,
rather than voyaging themselves on
every occasion.

surround him during a trance.

Perhaps most importantly, spirit
helpers provide a shaman with teach¬
ing. They provide instruction in magi¬
cal techniques and enhance the
shaman’s perception, while the teaching
also represents a process of moral and
spiritual growth. It is not simply that an
initiate is inexperienced in the tech¬
niques of fighting demons, but rather j
that a young shaman has a limited
understanding of how reality operates,
an understanding that is still very simi¬
lar to that of a layperson. All these
aspects of development are captured in
the Siberian image of the shaman
wrapped in swaddling clothes and sus¬
pended in an iron cradle on a branch of
the world tree, or being breastfed by the
Mistress of the realm about which he
has to learn.
Helper spirits are often humans, such ;
as an early ancestor or a previous
shaman who is now dead. When a Sora
shaman enters trance and her own soul
departs to the underworld, the voice of
her predecessor, the previous shaman of
her tradition, appears and promises to
lead a succession of other spirits one by
one to speak through the shaman’s
mouth. The shamans own soul will
remain absent throughout the trance
and her predecessor will act as mistress
of ceremonies. Sora shamans also have
another kind of helper, a high-caste

fill to respect and cultivate because oth¬
erwise they could be lost or could
become harmful. Thus one of the great¬
est Sora shamans in living memory is
said to have been killed by the spirit of
his predecessor and teacher because he
made her an offering of stale rice from
a previous year’s harvest. The Washo
shaman Henry was given his power
after having a dream in a boarding
school dormitory. He dreamt of a buck,
the animal which is “boss of the rain'’,
and because it was raining when he
woke up Henry interpreted the dream
as meaning that he would be able to
control the weather. The first time he
tried to do this was to remove some
deep snow, but he did not do the job
properly and there was heavy flooding.
The second time he tried to use his
power, he again called down the rain to
melt some snow and this time he
dropped a medicine bundle into the
river. That evening the weather turned
warm and it rained. However Henry
had used buckskin from his shaman’s
rattle to tie up the medicine bundle, and
had replaced the buckskin on the rattle
with thread. The spirit of the buck was
offended and Henry lost for ever his
power to control the weather.
Although the boarding-school life of the Washo
Henry was designed to regiment his mind and
strip away his native culture, he was nevertheless
visited by spirits in his dreams.
spirits remain as a distillation and
reminder of that experience.
The shaman’s identity often seems to
merge strangely with that of the spirit
helper. Being aided by an animal, or
riding on its back, are ways of taking on
that animal’s properties and involve a
degree of thinking and feeling like that
animal. At this point the various prop¬
erties remain external to oneself, but it
is only one further step to become the
animal and take its properties fully into
one’s own person.
Yet at the same time helper spirits
remain in part external to the shaman,
something that he or she must be care

THE DIVINE INSPIRATION OF POETS
The idea that inspiration beyond a person’s
normal capacities comes from outside oneself
reaches far beyond shamanism. In ancient
Greece, poetry, music and the arts were said
to be gifts of the Muses, goddesses whose
name gives us the word “music”. Great poets
acknowledged that they were merely channels
for the Muses. The Odyssey, Homer’s epic •
poem about the travels of the hero Odysseus
after the fall of Troy, begins:
This idiom has stayed alive in Europe for
thousands of years. Although the Greek gods
and spirits had no place in Milton’s Puritan
theology, they still provided compelling images
for his literary vision. Paradise Lost, his epic
about God’s duel with Satan, opens:
Of Man s first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,

Voyages to other realms
A Sora shaman fasts on the morning of
a journey to the underworld, although
she may drink alcohol and smoke
tobacco. An assistant lights a lamp
which will be kept burning in the dark¬
ness below throughout the shamans
journey. The shaman sits down with her
eyes closed and her legs stretched out
straight in front of her. Then, perhaps
beating a steady pulse with a stick or
knife, or else swishing grain around
with a winnowing fan, she sings a song
calling on a succession of former
shamans who are now dead. The jour¬
ney which she is about to undertake is
an impossible one for ordinary people,
who will eventually make it once only,
when they die, and with no hope of
returning to their bodies.
The earth and the underworld are
linked by a huge tree, down which she
must clamber. The path includes dizzy¬
ing precipices on the descent to the
“murky-sun country, cock-crow-light
country”. In order to make this jour¬
ney, the shaman’s soul “becomes” a
monkey, like those of the shamans who
have gone before her. After some min¬
utes of singing, her voice peters out
and her head flops down on to
her breast, meaning that her
soul has departed.
Sora shamans make their
journeys frequently and
calmly. In Siberia,
journeys happen
much more rarely
and tend to be
more dramatic
as shamans
shoot up to the
stars or dart between
clashing rocks under¬
ground. A Yakut shaman in the last
century would have gone off alone to
meditate deeply. Then, hiccoughing
nervously so that his whole body quiv¬
ered, he would keep his eyes downcast
or fixed immovably on the light of a fire.
As the fire died down and darkness set¬
tled over the yurt (tent), he would put
on his special voyaging kaftan and take
long, deep gulps at his pipe. The hic¬
coughing would become louder and the
shaking more excited as he reached for
his drum and drumstick. In Siberia,
there were various routes upward.
The Khant shaman climbed up a
branch which was lowered from the sky,
brushing the stars aside with his hand.
The Nenets shaman walked up a bridge
made of smoke and the Chukchi went
up on foot or on a reindeer. As they
climbed, shamans sometimes had to
hack their way through ice, and large
chunks of it were said to fall behind
them into the tent. In Siberia, the
entrance to the upper world was often
through a membrane or small hole,
which is consistent with the interpreta¬
tion of the shaman’s voyage as a jour¬
ney into the womb.
Often shamans use a vehicle such
as a bird to fly to the sky and a fish
to dive under the water; or they may
become the vehicle themselves, in
the same way that the Sora
shaman can become a
monkey. Vehicles express
the shaman’s extraor¬
dinary power of loco¬
motion. which is not
available to the unaided
human body.

SHAMAN-VOYAGERS IN LITERATURE
The shamanic journey, with
its temptations, obstacles and
monsters, is the prototype of
many adventure stories in
which the struggle to
overcome such difficulties is
the very mark of the hero.
Odysseus, for example, is
shipwrecked by the angry god
of the sea and sails through
clashing rocks and past sirens
(shown, right, in Ulysses and
the Sirens, painted in 1909
by Herbert Draper) whose
beautiful singing drives any
ordinary man to his death; he
is locked up in a cave by a
one-eyed giant; and is kept as
a sex-slave by a sorceress who
turns the rest of his crew into
pigs. He also visits the dead
in the underworld.
Throughout, he is protected
by his own cunning and by
the goddess Athene who,
significantly, is herself the
goddess of shrewdness. The
object of his journey is to
rescue himself by reaching
his wife and home. On this

voyage,' which is one of self
discovery as well as of the
discovery of the world,
Odysseus can be seen as both
shaman and patient.
A similar combination of
adventure with spiritual quest
occurs in almost any kind of
story which explores conflict
and resolution through the
unfolding of narrative. In
Bunyan’s Pilgrim’s Progress,
Pilgrim wades through the
Slough of Despond and faces
Giant Despair. In Norton

the realm of Pue, the Lord or Owner, to

patients were two women and their chil¬
dren, and the fear was that the women’s
menstrual cloths, which had been hung
up to dry and had disappeared, might
have blown into a forest clearing which
was being burned. Since menstrual
blood is the source of human life it
must not be destroyed by fire, even acci¬
dentally. From the discussion with Pue
it emerged that the cloths had not been
burned after all, and the shamans’ spir¬
its were able to rescue their patients’
souls on the return journey and blow
them back into their bodies. On other
occasions, of course, a patient may be in
serious danger and shamans and their

and a shaman’s

kind of death.
While in the
underworld, Sora
shamans must not eat any food that
is offered by the dead, or play with
the children there, however inviting
this may seem. If they succumb to
temptation, they will be unable to
return. A Sora person who appears to
be dying will be urged, “Don’t let them
feed you, don’t swallow it!”
The shaman's psychic journey may
also take place entirely on the level of
this earth. An example is the Desana
shaman in the Amazon who travels to a
nearby outcrop of rock to negotiate
with the Master of the Animals who
inhabits a cave there (see pp. 107-8).
Another is the Alaskan Eskimo
shaman who flew across the Bering
Strait to Siberia to see what had hap¬
pened to a missing person. This spirit
journey retraced a voyage which ordi¬

SHAMANS AND ASTRONAUTS WALK OUT-OF-BODY AND NEAR-DEATH
ON THE MOON EXPERIENCES
Anthropologists have sometimes been asked if
it is true that Americans have walked on the
moon, but the questioners have then added,
“But why did they need so much equipment
our shamans don't need any of that!" For
some villagers in Nepal the moon is the land
of the dead, and the question arises, “Did they
meet our dead up there?” A widespread story
in Siberia is that when the US astronaut John
Glenn reached the moon he was met and
helped by an old white-haired Russian doctor
and wise-man called Ivanov, who when he
reached the end of his long life had ascended
there from earth.
roads, reciting his movements step by
step to his audience. Even his helper
spirits are creatures grazing on the sur¬
face of the earth. When called by the
shaman, they journey across the local
countryside along routes which are also
recounted in detail. Unlike journeys in
the underworld and across the cosmos,
such journeys have a particular effect
on the patient because the patient’s
physical and emotional state is mapped
on to a landscape which he or she
already knows intimately. Sometimes a
shaman’s voyages take place entirely
inside the patient’s own body. The sym¬
bolic significance of these forms of
Out-of-body experiences resemble the
shamanic journey in some respects. A person
may experience himself floating in the air,
looking down at his own body and sometimes
travelling to other realms and meeting spirits.
A near-death experience goes further.
Someone who is close to dying may float above
his or her body and then drift down a tunnel
towards a brilliant white light. The person has
a great feeling of bliss, feels impelled to return
(but with some reluctance) and then regains
consciousness inside his or her body. This kind
of experience seems to have become common
in hospitals after the introduction of
resuscitation machines for victims of serious
heart attacks. A person generally has little if
any control during these experiences, but they
may represent a first step on the path followed
by shamans, who likewise cannot control their
experiences at first. Some shamans receive
their calling only after nearly dying from a

journey is explored on pp. 156-9.
In most of North America and eastern
Asia, shamans do not go on voyages when
in trance. The Salish shamans present an
intriguing compromise: the shamans do
not actually enter a state of trance, but
instead act out a canoe journey to the
land below the earth. One modern cos¬
mopolitan shamanic movement has
adopted this technique for use in work¬
shops (see pp. 150-153).



74 BECOMING A SHAMAN
Battles with hostile spirits
A shaman from Nepal met a Westerner
who remarked how good it must be to
live in harmony with the cosmos. The
shaman replied, “The main part of my
job is killing witches and sorcerers. I am
terrified every time before I perform a
big ritual because I know that each
time, one of us has to die.”
Healing the victim of a sorcerer may
involve doing battle with the aggressor
as well as saving the patient. In addition
to darts and harmful objects, sorcerers
may send their familiar spirits to attack
a victim, or even eat the victim’s soul.
Grave dangers come not only from
animate, conscious enemies, but also
from the fact that a shaman’s soul must
wander without the protection of its
body. The destructive spirits on the way
and even the harshness of the terrain,
particularly on underworld journeys,
symbolize this danger. As the Wana
canoe journey shows (see pp.71—2),
ideas about the degree of these dangers

spirits are a falcon and a stone-thrower.
can vary greatly, and indeed one
anthropologist calls it a “slow boat to
heaven”. In Siberia and Central Asia,
by contrast, the sense of danger is very
strong. According to a Nenets tradi¬
tion, it is dangerous to fly near the sun
and the moon since they pull you
towards them and you may be unable to
move away. The man in the moon is a
shaman who got stuck there and could
not escape. The journey to the lower
world, generally associated with the
land of the dead, usually involves
squeezing through tight, dangerous
gaps. The Altai shaman would cross
bleak, lifeless steppes towards a dark
iron mountain in the distance which
propped up the sky. The approach to
the mountain was littered with the
bones of previous unsuccessful
shamans and their horses. The sky
banged and flapped constantly against
the top of the mountain and it was only
at the instant when it rose off the moun¬
tain top that the shaman could slip
through with one finely judged leap.
From here, the shaman would go down
through the “jaws of the earth” to an
underground sea, straddled
by a bridge the width of a
single hair. As the shaman
teetered across this hair, he
could see the bones of previ¬
ous shamans who had fallen
gleaming palely through the
gloomy depths. Obstacles
such as these are echoed
closely in other regions of
the world. In Venezuela the
Warao shaman also has to
pass a pile of the bleached
bones of his predecessors

in a huge tree trunk with doors which
open and close rapidly.
The inanimate, impersonal nature of
the dangers menacing the Altai shaman
is itself chilling. But another kind of
fear can come from a landscape which
is aggressive because it is highly animat¬
ed. The Warao novice must swing on a
vine across an abyss filled with “hungry
jaguars, snapping alligators and fren¬
zied sharks”, run along a slippery path
between demons armed with spears,
and pass by a giant shaman-eating
hawk. Different traditions speak vari¬
ously of monsters, cannibals, demons,
wild animals, impossible precipices and
numerous other ordeals which the
shaman must overcome. The Nepalese
shaman belongs to one of many tradi¬
tions in which a shaman whose soul is
defeated during a fight with a powerful
enemy can quite easily die.
Spirits have consciousness and intelli¬
gence on the model of humans, and so
can engage a shaman in either a physi¬
cal battle or a battle of wits. The idea of
the battle is borrowed from warfare or
from hunting among the living, and the
imagery will include blood and gore, or
the catching of souls in a trap. The male
assistants of a Sora shaman sing at a
funeral of how they mount a war party

and go to rescue the
deceased from a bad
place in the cosmos:
“Let us hold our axes,
let us grab our axes.
Let us brandish our
swords, let us bran¬
dish our knives.” In
a battle of wits, the
shaman must match
the cunning of the
enemy. In a typically
shamanic episode from
Greek myth, Oedipus tries to
save the city of Thebes
from a plague and is
confronted on the road
by the Sphinx, who asks
travellers a riddle and
then strangles them when they cannot
answer. He answers the riddle so that
the Sphinx destroys herself instead and
the plague is lifted. A Dolgan shaman
in Siberia proved unable to locate the
spirit who was making his
patient ill, so he invited a
singer of heroic epic
tales to come to the
healing seance. When
the singer reached
the point in his story
where the hero
engages an evil spirit
in battle and begins
to defeat it, the spirit
that was afflicting the
patient could bear it no
longer and emerged from its
victim’s body in order to
help its colleague. At
that very moment the
shaman engaged it in
combat and defeated it.
The shaman may also be subjected to
tests in the form of temptations. The
hungry Warao initiate must refuse
tempting barbecues of boar, tapir and
alligator and avoid the sexual blandish
Shamanic battle themes are carried
over into other religions which
absorb shamanism. Here, in a
Chinese Buddhist parable, Monkey
fights a White Bone Demon.
GOOD AND BAD TRANSPORTED INTO
OUTER SPACE
Science fiction “Space Operas” (right), based
on journeys through the sky and battles
against powerful enemies, serve as a modern
continuation of ancient shamanic themes. The
film Star Wars corresponds closely to a
shamanic struggle, with Luke Skywalker as the
apprentice shaman. Obi Kenoby as his master,
Darth Vadar as lord of the evil realm and
Princess Leia (and indeed her whole planet) as
the soul to be rescued. The shaman has his
assistants, including the friendly spirit
Chcwbacca, while the hosts of evil spirits are
represented by the Empire's stormtroopers.
One obstacle after another is placed in the way
of the heroes by the forces of evil, only to be
removed by the heroic shaman and his team.
The powerful weapons used reveal a continuity
with shamanism in their blend of ultra
advanced technology and ancient magic.



A SHAMAN’S FIGHT TO
THE DEATH WITH THE
SMALLPOX SPIRIT
In Siberia, whole clans
sometimes perished from
smallpox. The Even believed
that the evil spirit of
smallpox appeared on the
migration routes of reindeer
herders in the form of a
woman with light hair like
that of a Russian. Usually she
arrived sitting unnoticed on a
sledge at the back of a
caravan of visitors. But the
shaman saw her and knew
that she had come to their
place “to pay a social call”.
The shaman prepared himself
for combat. Most shamans
were unable to fight alone
against the spirit of smallpox,
which charged them in the
form of a huge red bull. If a
shaman was strong enough to

ments of seductive spirit women. In
other words, the shaman must work out
what moral valuation to put on experi¬
ences and actions. The buck in the
Washo shaman Henry’s power dream
was standing in the West but looking
East. For the Washo, evil souls reside in
the East and Henry took this as a mes¬
sage that he should avoid developing
the potential for black magic which was
a usual part of a shaman’s activity.
Just as with helper spirits, so hostile
spirits can also be interpreted as corre¬
sponding to something inside the
shaman’s own psyche. The forest,
wilderness or under¬
world are places
beyond the civilizing
reach of human cul¬
ture, and perhaps
correspond to the
“unconscious” mind
of psychoanalysis
(see p.145). The dis¬
tinction that exists
between good and
evil spirits is generally
not as clear-cut as in
some highly dualistic
religions such as
Christianity. Like the
forces of nature, spir¬

its may be either helpful or destructive.
The task for a shaman is to enlist their
aid, persuade them, and if they insist on
working against the shaman, to thwart
them. The struggle between benign and
hostile spirits reflects the ambivalent
nature, not only of the world, but also
of the shaman and humanity itself.

Music, dance and words
At the beginning of the Bible God said,
“Let there be light,” and there was
light. In commands, prayers, curses and
spells, words make things happen. They
create reality by declaring the speaker’s
intention. “By the power of song we
cross this desert,” sang an Altai
shaman who travelled to the under¬
world. A shamanic performance pro¬
vides the language to express otherwise
inexpressible psychic states, which can
never be described in literal terms, and
it may be that shamans are particularly
good at fantasizing and at organizing
ambiguous impressions into coherent
images. The shaman primarily uses nar¬
rative to organize experiences into an
epic series of initiations, journeys and
battles. What takes place does not just
reflect the shaman’s or the patient’s cur¬
rent situation, but is also part of a story.
As the narrative unfolds over time it
moves from problem to resolution.
Obstacles are described only to be
removed, and there is a close analogy
with psychoanalysis and related “talk¬
ing cures” (see pp. 144-5).
An orchestra plays while a Sora shaman nearby
descends through the floor to the underworld.
A Korean shaman manifests the Warrior Spirit,
and dances joyfully because the spirit has been
well entertained. She holds a roll offlags to use
in divining, and her chin band is decorated with
bank notes which are her divination fees.
The power of words lies not only in
their meaning but in their musical
effect. The vegetalistcis use a range of
magical chants called icaro which are
derived from hallucinogenic plants and
also embody the shamans' own powers.
Singing, like shamanism itself, is
regarded as a culmination of a human’s
potential for growth: “A man is like a
tree. Under the appropriate conditions
he grows branches. The branches are
the ieuros."
The experience of the spirit realm in
shamanism is closely tied to music. In
particular, there is a powerful connec¬
tion between trance and the rhythmic
regularity of percussion instruments. In
virtually every region where shamanism
is found, the drum is the shamanic

drum may also be used as a boat or as a
container to scoop up spirits, and may
be decorated with drawings of animals
and of the shaman’s family so that they

Melody can also be important. In the
chants of Sora shamans, all melodies
are built out of the same pentatonic
scale but each category of spirit has its
own signature tune which must be sung
by the shaman invoking it. After the
shaman has gone into trance and the
spirits start to speak through her
mouth, they sing their replies in their
same signature tune and this is a way of

THE PHYSICS OF
SHAMANS’ DRUMS
These diagrams show lines
of vibration on the surface of
a round drum at different
frequencies. The pattern
of harmonics on a drum
membrane is highly complex,
especially on shamans’ drums
which in Lapland and Siberia
are oval. Tests on ancient
Saarni drums from Lapland
show that each drum was
struck in a limited number
of places, presumably
corresponding to the sound
characteristics of that
particular instrument. Saami
drums were covered with
elaborate drawings of people,
animals and the cosmos.
Shamans used their drums
for divination by studying
the movements of a pointer
across these drawings while
the drum was being played.
A typical pointer was a
bunch of metal rings called
a “frog”. The frog’s jumps
depended on the harmonics
of the vibrating skin and
modern experiments suggest
that these movements are
almost impossible to predict
reliably.
confirming the identity of the spirit
contacted. But the crucial song at a
funeral which rescues the deceased by
resisting or denying all the categories of
spirit which may have captured him or
her, is sung in a monotone chant which
avoids any hint of melody.
A shaman’s relationship with spirits
is as much corporeal as spiritual. It is
sometimes hard to know where the
jerking movements of a shaman in
trance, or the acting out of the
shaman’s adventures, end and a dance
begins. The dancing of Siberian
shamans imitates the movements of
animals and birds, and in general dance
expresses whichever qualities are
thought to give a shaman power. While
Siberian dance emphasizes the relation¬
ship with wild animals, the dance of the
Korean shaman emphasizes the power
gained from royal and bureaucratic
spirits as the dancers change their robes
to meet whichever spirit or god appears.
Here, it is not only the shaman who
dances but also the patient and the
patient’s family and friends. Each one
has a personal “Body-Governing God”
who possesses that person and dances
through their body. For the patient, this
dancing is part of the cure while for
other participants it brings good for¬
tune. Women find it much easier than
men to give themselves over to their
Body-Governing God.
Even where shamans themselves do
not dance, it can remain central to their
work. The yurupari dancing of the
Desana is not performed by shamans, *
but with its phallic flutes and warnings
against incest it acts out myths and
themes which are fundamental to the
cosmology within which the shaman
operates. During funerals the Sora
shaman sits motionless, surrounded by
a small group of the dead person’s
weeping relatives amid a swirling crowd
of dancers, while the spirits speak one
by one to them through her mouth. The
crowd dances with a movement which j
echoes the war-dance of the rescuing
spirits, as well as the sexual intercourse
which will produce a new baby, who
will eventually receive the name of the
dead person.

DYUKHADE RECEIVES HIS DRUM
FROM THE COSMIC TREE
The Siberian shaman, Dyukhade, describes
how he acquired his drum: “Then the spirits
led me to a young larch tree which was so high
that it reached right up to the sky. I heard
voices saying, Tt is ordained that you should
have a drum made from a branch of this tree.’
And 1 noticed that I seemed to be flying along
with the birds of the lake. As soon as I started
leaving the ground, the Master of the Tree
shouted to me, ‘My branch has broken off and
is falling... Take it and make a drum from it
and it will serve you for the rest of your life.’
And I saw the branch falling and actually
caught it on the wing.”
In this picture from Nepal, a Magar shaman
enacts a remarkably similar ritual to that of'
Dyukhade. Using his drum to catch a branch
thrown down from the Life Tree by another
shaman makes him a teacher and guardian.

Costumes and equipment
A medicine rattle

America.
A shaman’s costume
helps to underscore
the expressive work
that is begun by
dance and gesture.
One can move from
acting as an animal
to dressing up as
that animal, or from
pulling a grotesque face
to putting on a mask.
Musical instruments
are objects or even ani¬
mals in their own right as well as mak¬
ers of sounds: the Siberian drum is also
a reindeer or a horse to be ridden, while
the Amazonian flute is also a penis.
Shamans use many such objects,
which they see as a concentration of
power in the world. Rocks are often
thought to be containers for spirits,
perhaps because of their durability, and
shamans sometimes keep special small
stones. Crystals are used by shamans
from America to Borneo and may be
thought of as the crystallized tears or
semen of sky spirits. Parts of plants and
animals are also widely used. Like
helper spirits, they endow the shaman
with something of their own properties,
and may perform actions on the
shaman’s behalf.
A shaman’s equipment is an
extension not only of the
shaman’s person but in partic¬
ular of his or her capacity to
act. The carved, weasel-like
Alaskan kikituk, like the rein¬
deer and the birds on a Siberian
shaman’s costume, summarizes cer¬
tain powers in its owner’s mind and
communicates these to the audience.
Such objects also allow the shaman
to perform an associated action. A
kikituk enabled the Alaskan shaman
Asatchaq to heal patients by biting the
disease spirit inside them, or to bite an
enemy to death. The reindeer on his
costume acted as the mount of a
Siberian shaman when he wished to
ride to the sky. A multiple significance

question one hears
when there is a
rumour that a new
shaman has appeared
is, “ Yes, but has he
got the costume?”
Like the gift of
shamanizing itself
the shaman may
inherit the costume,
or he may have it
made. One Siberian
shamans costume
was destroyed by the
authorities in the
1950s and he secretly
had another made

to his daughter. She
became a surgeon,

thought that the
costume gave her the
power to follow a
politically acceptable
career in heeding.
ASATCHAQ’S POWER
OBJECT COMES TO LIFE
Among the Alaskan Eskimo,
shamans kept an effigy of
an animal such as an ermine
or weasel as a power-object.
This effigy was called a
kikituk and was carved out of
wood or ivory. The shaman
could carry it in his parka or
inside his body, where it
would enter or leave through
his mouth or armpit. He
could heal patients by using
it to bite the spirits attacking
them, but could also send it
to kill an enemy by burrowing
into his body to the heart. In
one account, a shaman called
Asatchaq used his kikituk
to kill an enemy and then
retrieved it from the corpse
by gently calling it back. Like
the small lithe animal it was,

Shamans’ rattles are

BLACKSMITHS
In Siberia and Mongolia,
the blacksmith was generally
more powerful than the
shaman. He had a similar
mastery of esoteric
techniques, but a greater
mastery of fire, and he made
the metal ornaments which
were essential attachments
to the shaman’s costume
(left). He was also the master
of the shaman’s initiation, as
is shown in the story of the
blacksmith who tempered
Dyukhade (see pp.60-61).
Smiths and shamans were
nurtured in the same nest,
but the smith was the
shaman’s elder brother. He
had no fear of spirits and the
shaman, being the smith’s
junior, could not cause his
death because the smith's
soul was protected by fire.

Shamanic botany: hallucinogens
Hallucinogenic plants show
beyond doubt that there can
be a physiological basis for
shamanic states of conscious¬
ness. Yet as with drumming
and dancing (or fasting or
deprivation of sleep), the cause itself
does not explain the content and the
emotional tone of the shamanic
states. Although psychotropic
plants are found throughout m
much of the world, their use

As there are both friendly and hostile
spirits, so one can receive either benign
or terrifying visions. Although native
users insist that these visions come from
the spirits, for those who believe in
the unconscious they are open to the

vision lies within and that what one gets

young man did what the spirit suggest¬
ed. Amid the screams, someone sent for
the police and the entire group was later
given long jail sentences.
As a historian of religions, Eliade saw
the use of hallucinogens as a compara¬
tively recent degeneration of “pure”
shamanism, in which people achieve
visions spontaneously. But even his
pure religious experiences are often
reached via extreme fatigue, fasting or
stress and are similar to those reached
under the influence of hallucinogenic
plants. Although palaeolithic states of
mind are a mystery, archaeologists have
found snuff-inhaling tubes and other
equipment which show that the use of
hallucinogenic plants in the Americas is
very ancient. La Barre has even argued
that religion itself arose from the
visions of ancient shamans and that
shamans, as “impresarios of the gods”,
existed before the gods (see pp. 132-5),
who are no more than shamans who
have grown great after their deaths.

Tricks of the trade
“When the great Khan is seated in his
high hall at his table, and the cups are a
good ten paces distant from the table
and full of wine and milk and other
pleasant drinks, these bakshi contrive
by their enchantment to make
the full cups rise up out of their
own accord and come to the
Great Khan without anyone
touching them.’' In this account
from the 13th century, Marco
Polo says that shamans could
also raise storms like the
shamans in Nepal today who
lift one finger to make the snow
fall and the other to make it
stop, or who can turn back a
bolt of lightning even after it
has set a house ablaze.
Sceptics have long main¬
tained that shamans rely on con¬
juring tricks. Certainly, some shamans
use spectacular effects some of the time,
but they claim that their tricks, like
their equipment, are not the main
point. “I use my rattle and feathers,'’’
said the Washo shaman, Henry, “only
to gain the attention of the sick person,
nothing more.” The point of such tricks
is to make others aware, through an
outward expression, of the shaman’s
inner power. Yakut shamans often used
to twist their heads off and put them on
a shelf, from where the head would con¬
tinue talking. The detachment of the
shaman’s head was a powerful reminder
of a central moment in the shaman’s
original initiation when the spirits
removed his head in just this way. On
the first occasion the shaman was pas¬
sive and helpless, whereas now he can
repeat the experience at will and under
his full control.
Being a trickster is an essential strand
in the make-up of a shaman, who must
change form to fight and outwit
obstructive spirits. Primeval
shamans used trickery to capture
J| the sun so as to give people day¬
light, or stole the secrets of fire,
hunting or agriculture from
jealous spirits. A Nepalese
shaman in this century was
imprisoned by the authorities
but walked out through the
main gate unnoticed in the
form of a sheep. Sometimes,
shamans practise their trickery
on clients. A male Sora shaman
was once treating an attractive widow.
The spirit of the woman’s husband
spoke through him and told her
that the one thing he really
missed was spending the night
with her and could he do it
just once more? She agreed,
but of course the only way
the husband could make
love with her was through
the shaman’s own body.
The shaman slept with
the woman, who emerged
blameless. The shaman

THE SOUND OF A SHAMAN DEPARTING
AND RETURNING
“The fire was put out, and there was darkness
and total silence. Sitting in a corner of the
birch-bark tent, the shaman played quietly on
the domra (a kind of balalaika) and sang for a
long time summoning his spirits. The sound of
the domra coming from the corner of the tent
suddenly started to move about. It sounded
first as though it was coming from the centre
of the tent, originating at floor level, then it
rang out right under the roof and finally
seemed to move into the distance, sometimes
falling completely silent and then becoming
audible once again, approaching slowly from
far away The Khant explained to me in a
whisper that the shaman was flying about,
calling his spirits.
“And then suddenly in the darkness
someone seemed to fly past (as they later
explained, this was the shaman flying out
of the tent). The tent began to fill with an
intriguing rustling noise and suddenly
various sounds could be heard, resembling
the cries of the birds and animals. First we
heard the sound of the cuckoo: ‘cuckoo,
cuckoo!’ Its soft, melodious song could be
heard for some time in different corners of
the tent. Then the sad and delicate song of
the cuckoo was suddenly replaced by the
flapping of the wings of an enormous owl:
‘kho, kho, kho, kho!’ This ill-omened
hooting literally filled the tent and made a
forceful impact on the mood of the audience,
was admired for his imaginative trick.
A person who can persuade spirits to
cure someone can also persuade them
to attack, and in many traditions the
role of healer and sorcerer are merged.
An Alaskan Eskimo shaman once
“drowned” an effigy of his rival and
during the next whaling season this
rival was dragged under water by a har¬
poon line. Such shamans used to collect
the bones, skins and sinews of dead ani¬
mals, breathe life into them and send
them on deadly missions. This sorcery
was called tupitkaq, a word which is
also used to refer to the positive process

especially in the complete darkness. After
this there was the cry of the hoopoe: ‘khu
do, khu-do!’ At this my neighbours anxiously
whispered, ‘A hoopoe, a hoopoe, oh dear!’
“Suddenly this grim picture was broken by
the rousing and cheerful cry of startled ducks:
‘krya, krya, kryaf The mood of the audience
immediately changed, and they whispered
happily and heaved sighs of relief. Then the
chatter of a squirrel rang out. It seemed to be
leaping from one tree to another. The people
sitting in the tent were surrounded by a whole
crowd of spirits in the form of birds and
animals. Now was the moment for divination.
When the squirrel appeared someone said,
‘Squirrel, I am going to shoot you - fall
down!’ The sound of a squirrel falling out of a
tree foretold a good hunt. But if the squirrel
began to chatter more loudly and to jump
about more, that meant an unsuccessful hunt.
“And then suddenly someone seemed to fly
into the tent from above, and again the sound
of the domra and the song of the shaman
could be heard. This meant that he had
returned from his mysterious, distant
wanderings. And again it seemed as if the
domra was playing in different parts of the tent
one after another, under the roof or else at
some distance. Unexpectedly under the gentle
accompaniment of the domra, there arose the
beautiful song of a girl who seemed to be
approaching slowly from afar... ”

90 BECOMING A SHAMAN
The uncertainties which
shamans can feel about their own
tricks is revealed by the story
of Quesalid, a Kwakiutl man
from Vancouver in Canada.
Quesalid was convinced that
shamans were merely conjur¬
ers and frauds, and set out to
unmask them by the unusual
path of apprenticing himself
to them in order to learn their
tricks. And indeed, they did
teach him how to pretend to
faint, to make himself vomit,
and to use spies to pick up med¬
ical and personal details about
patients. They also taught him
their greatest trick, to hide a
tuft of down in his mouth, suck
the patients body, then bite his
tongue so that the down
became soaked in blood. The
shaman then vomited the
bloody down and presented it
practise as a shaman and he was
unnerved to find himself resounding¬
ly successful. He became famous,
yet continued to believe himself
to be a fraud who succeeded
only because the patient
believed in him. In his con¬
tests with other shamans,
Quesalid triumphed time
after time and healed their incur¬
able patients. His rivals confessed
their trickery, were humiliated,
went mad and died, but Quesalid
continued his now inescapable career
as a great shaman. But his own atti¬
tude had changed. He saw the
shamans who lacked the bloody
worm technique as even more
fraudulent than himself, since he at
least gave the patient a tangible rep

BECOMING A SHAMAN 91
The shaman’s multiple nature
Shamans are central figures in their
societies, yet they are also marginal,
marked off from others by the extraor¬
dinary nature of their experiences and
personalities. Even if shamans are ordi¬
nary hunters, housewives or farmers
when off-duty, they retain the constant
potential to enter other worlds and
become other beings. Their different
identities are often opposed in pairs
and expressed simultaneously during
rituals: the shaman is both healer and
sorcerer, human and divine, human and
animal, male and female. The sum of
each paired term indicates the totality
of the shaman’s way of being.
The shaman has a double nature as
both human and divine because he or
she incarnates the spirits in his or her
own body. This is quite unlike a priest,
for whom impersonating Allah
Jehovah or the Holy Ghost is
inconceivable or even blas¬
phemous. The shaman
becomes spirit, like a
possessed person, but
is always in control of
the incarnation.
Similarly, the shaman can
become a fish or a bird,
a reindeer or a whale. In
Amazonia, a shaman can
become a jaguar by taking
an exceptionally large dose
of viho snuff. When he dies,
the shaman may turn per¬
manently into a jaguar. An
identical belief about tigers is
found among the Batek and
ethnic groups. The lowly tribal Sora
shamans gain their powers by marrying
high-caste Hindu spirits, opening up a
perspective which allows the Sora to
unravel and explore the tensions in their
troubled relations with neighbouring
peoples. Shamanism in Latin America,
in particular, seems preoccupied with
the trauma of colonial power and with
the violence of relations between
Indians and whites.
A shaman also has a complex person¬
ality by virtue of the drama of his or her
performance. The shaman does not suf¬
fer from a multiple personality in the
sense of a psychotic illness, because this
sense of multiple personality implies a
world of private fantasy whereas the
shaman’s spirits concern the community
at large. As well as the shaman’s own
spirits it is the gods, nature spirits,
waterfalls, ancient ancestors and
recently deceased loved ones of
the community whom the
shaman incarnates, playing
on the audience’s own
feelings of tenderness
and fear. The wide¬
spread use of masks,
disguises and animal
costumes underlines the
extent to which the per¬
sona presented is not the
shaman’s own.

Sora shamans. These previous shamans
become monkeys and help the present
shamans on the difficult path to the
underworld. In order to clamber to the
underworld, the living shamans slip out
of their bodies and their souls also turn
to monkeys.
Shamanic societies recognize many
strands which go to make up a person
and which do not correspond simply to
the European components of body and
mind, or soul. For example, each of the
different parts of the body in Mongolia
has its own ezhin, a spirit “Master” or
“Owner”. In modern psychological
terms, the shaman’s helpers resemble
the alter ego or other similar “projec¬
tions”. That is, they can be interpreted
as aspects of the total self, arising
through one’s personal history and
relationships with others and experi¬
enced as being external.
Thus shamans often send familiar
spirits to do a job, whether of healing or
of sorcery, rather than going them¬
selves. Again, the Sora shaman’s own
soul is absent in the underworld during
trance but her place is taken by the

voice of her own teacher and predeces¬
sor, with the extra authority which this
brings. The Washo shaman Henry used
to visit a high school which owned a
skeleton of a Hindu. One day its spirit
entered (or “got on”) Henry and there¬
after became one of his main helpers.
After this, Henry gradually came to
form a new picture of himself when
healing. While sitting alongside the
patient, he envisioned himself moving
around the patient’s body in the form of
a skeleton with a turban on its head.
The Wana canoe journey can take
two different forms which reveal clearly
how interchangeable the shaman's iden¬
tity can be with that of his spirit
helpers. In one form, the shaman
recounts the journey in song but it is his
helper spirits who propel the boat,
negotiate with the Owner in the sky and
rescue the patients’ souls. In the other
form, instead of being slowly propelled
by a crew of spirit oarsmen, he leads his
helpers himself along the path of the



wind, of the blinking of an eye, or of a
flash of lightning.
Whether we see spirit helpers as
external or internal to the shaman must
depend on our initial assumptions
about reality. But either way, we can
recognize that this is a way of talking
about the size or scope of the person.
Whatever minimum core the person is
thought to have, these spirits represent an
augmentation of that person. A psycho¬
logical approach, which sees spirits as a
metaphor for something inside the mind,
stretches our idea of the person to
encompass them, while shamans and
their societies conceive them as lying
outside the person and entering into
relations of association and alliance.
THE SHAMAN’S MULTIPLE NATURE 93
The Siberian shaman summons spir¬
its from all quarters with the sound of
his drum, which he then uses to gather
them up. The spirits are scattered
aspects of the shaman’s self - or rather,
since this might imply pathology, they
are scattered extra aspects of whatever it
is that gives the shaman a much larger
personhood than ordinary people, con¬
taining as he does all his own past,
everybody else’s past, their inner feel¬
ings and the sentience of the surround¬
ings. The phrase “mastery of spirits” is
not always appropriate since the rela¬
tionship between shaman and spirit can
be an uncertain one, and the shaman’s
anguish can be too intense to justify the
name of master.
The berdache We- Wha stands between the men and the women.
TRANSVESTITE
SHAMANS
Transvestism is closely
associated with shamanism
in many parts of the world.
The male Siberian shaman’s
costume generally contains
female symbols, and among
the Chukchi of northeastern
Siberia, some male shamans
became like their female
spirits and dressed as women,
did women’s work and used
the special language which
was spoken only by women.
This can be seen as a marriage
with a spirit, but involving a
more total identification. At
times a male shaman acts out
a female role without any
cross-dressing. Just across the
Bering Strait in Alaska, the
Eskimo shaman Asatchaq
would take out his kikituk
effigy by “giving birth’’ to it.
While someone drummed, he
would rub his belly until it
swelled, pull down his
trousers, kneel in the birth
position and pull blood from
between his legs, followed by
the kikituk. Among North
American Indians there is a
strong tradition of male
transvestism, called berdache.
Among the Navajo the
berdache is called nadle,
meaning “one who is transformed”, or “changing
one”. When berdaches
became shamans they were
regarded as exceptionally
powerful. The Mohave
believed that female shamans
were more powerful than
male, but that berdache
shamans were stronger than
either. Among the Navajo the
berdaches had special chants
for curing insanity and aiding
childbirth and the Lakota
and Cheyenne had similar
ideas. A knowledge and
awareness of the berdache
tradition has had a
significant influence on the
gay liberation movement in
the USA.



94 BECOMING A SHAMAN
Death of the shaman
In many parts of the world the shaman
undergoes a symbolic death during ini¬
tiation, which is followed by a resurrec¬
tion. Yakut shamans could be killed
and come to life three times. One
shaman called No-Jaw was cut into
pieces by an enemy and his body scat¬
tered, but his spirits gathered him up
and brought him back to life. This hap¬
pened a second time. The third time.
No-Jaw tried to run away, but his legs
became entangled in a tree-root. His
enemy not only cut him up but also
threw his jawbone into the fire. The
shaman came back to life, received his
name of No-Jaw and was given a calf’s
jawbone as a substitute.
Eventually, the shaman will die in the
ordinary sense. Yet the shaman is not
simply an individual. He or she is also
the bearer of powers which must
remain in the world of the living. The
shaman received these powers from a
predecessor and will hand them on to a
successor. This can be done only when
a young recruit is ready to receive them.
If a Sora shaman cannot find a succes¬
sor before dying, she may seek out a
little girl years after dying and teach her
in dreams. The task of finding a suitable

origins in the distant past

special rite is performedfor

clan gods, and his son and
successor adds a special

successor can be difficult, and the spirits
of a dead shaman can wreak havoc as
they rampage through the community
seeking a new recruit. In one village in
Siberia, the last shaman died in 1992.
In the last few years of his life,
Communist persecution ceased, but he
could not persuade any of his descen¬
dants to take on his vocation. With his
death, a whole tradition died.
As well as passing on power, a
shaman may become a protector spirit
and the owner of a site on the land¬
scape. Among the Darkhat Mongols, a
shaman would be taken out of the yurt
(a round tent) and laid in his favourite
place. He was left on a stretcher on the
ground and his equipment was hung on
a nearby tree. It was forbidden to visit
the site for 49 days. After three years he
was converted from a dangerous spirit
into a helpful one. Another shaman
would set up a table of offerings and act
out the behaviour of the dead shaman
as if he had already become a protective
spirit, in order to encourage the dead
shaman to follow suit. When he was
sure that this had happened, the living
shaman passed the spirit into a doll
called an ongon and hung it in a shrine
as a permanent protector.
Where the shaman is feared, the
funeral rites may reflect this fear and |
the spirit’s location become an unsafe
place. At the burial of a dangerous
“black shaman”, the Darkhat would
break the skin of his drum. Since the
shaman was thought to ride his drum
through the air like a horse, this immo¬
bilized him. When the Yakut shaman
No-Jaw was about to die. he toid his I
son to pull him on a sledge to a site by
the river. As the son approached the
spot, his father suddenly vanished and
was never seen again. But now people

with his calf’s jawbone, will answer.

Shamans and Clients
The shaman’s experience is never just a
personal voyage of discovery, but also a
service to the community. Through the
ordeal of initiation, the shaman is enabled
to empathize with the sufferings and needs
of others. Being a shaman is probably, in
fact, the oldest profession, covering the roles
which in industrial societies are played
separately by the doctor, psychotherapist,
soldier, fortune-teller, priest and politician.
Among the Sora of India, the spirits of a
dead boy may entered a shaman and speak
to his mother and his other relatives through
the shaman’s mouth. Not only the resolution
of the mother’s mourning process but even
the inheritence of the boys belongings will
depend on the outcome of the conversations
that pass between them. Here the shaman
serves not only as a therapist but also as a
lawyer, both roles being accomplished
through a kind of psychodrama.
In this picture of a group of Sora, the old lady in the centre is a
shaman. The spirit of a dead hoy has entered her and is speaking
to his mother, to the left of the shaman. The mother shows the
spirit his silver necklaces and red-fringed loin-cloth which she has

Healing the sick, rescuing lost souls
A soul catcher used by a Tlingit shaman to bring back the wandering soul of his patient.
In the shamanic view of the world, ill¬
ness has only a limited number of pos¬

souls may be lost, in which case the
shaman’s soul travels to the realm of the
spirits to fight for it and bring it back.
Alternatively, there may be a foreign
object such as a hairy caterpillar or a
splinter of bone lodged in the sufferer’s
body. This could have been put there by
spirits, or else a magic dart could have
been fired into the patient by a sorcerer.
In this case there is something surplus
inside the patient which must be
removed. The shaman will suck out the
object and perhaps display it to the
patient and onlookers. Although trance
may be used in such circumstances, a

soul flight is unlikely because the prob¬
lem is not in the realm of the spirits, but
right here in the physical world. If a liv¬
ing enemy is implicated in the cause of
an illness, the shaman may try to harm
him or her through sorcery, as one way
of making the patient stronger is to
weaken his or her opponent. Possession
and exorcism, in which a spirit inhabits
a victim’s body and needs to be cast
out, do not usually form part of
shamanic healing.
Illness can also be caused by the
breaking of taboos which are consid¬
ered basic to morality and good living.
Such acts weaken the patient through a
withdrawal of vital forces. This kind of

the underworld, into releasing Eurydice, but

The shamanic perception of well¬
being does not only encompass physical
health in the medical sense, nor is it
restricted to mental health in the psy¬
chiatric sense. It includes good nutri¬
tion, good friendship, prosperity, and
successful business and warfare. All of
these things depend on ideas of bal¬

ronment, and on ideas of giving and

ESCAPE FROM THE
RAVEN-HEADED
PEOPLE IN THE SKY
The idea of an opening in the
sky was widespread in Siberia
and the shaman had to use
this route when climbing up
into the spirit realm. The
Chukchi and Even thought
the hole was located by the
Pole Star. Looking down
through the hole, one could
see the camps of the earth
people and watch their
women doing the housework.
According to the Yakut, a
separate sun and moon shone
in the upper world and the
houses and barns were made
of iron. The sky-people had
raven heads and human
bodies. Once an elderly sky
dweller said to his son, “Go
down to the middle world
and bring yourself back a
wife!” His raven-headed son
set off and returned dragging
a woman by the hair. They
were all happy and held a
banquet with dancing while
they shut the woman up in an
iron barn. Then they heard
the sound of a shaman’s
drum, followed by his
singing. The sounds grew
louder and then a head
appeared from below in the
sky-opening. This was the
shaman, determined to
rescue the soul of the woman
who had fallen ill on earth.
He put his drumstick to his
brow and immediately turned
into a bull with a single horn
growing from the middle of
his forehead. With one blow
he smashed the doors of the
barn where the woman was
imprisoned and disappeared
with her down below. A
shaman was not always
successful, however. On one
occasion the spirits of the
upper world lit a fire by the
opening and stood in
readiness. When the shaman
appeared in the opening they
started beating him with
burning logs and drove him
back down to earth. (For a
psychoanalyst’s interpretation
of this story, see p.141.)
SHAMANS AND OTHER
HEALERS IN SIBERIA
Among the Even of Siberia,
the shaman was sent for only
after all ordinary forms and
methods of folk medicine had
been tried. The functions of a
physician were performed by
various healers and members
of the family. A range of
medicines of vegetable and
animal origin were a
common part of any
attempted treatment. The
antlers of young reindeer
were used as a general tonic,
and the blood which spouts
out from inside a young
antler when it is first cut was
considered especially
valuable. Other popular
medicines were a kind of fern
called oir, ginseng, and
poplar buds which were
employed as a painkiller. For
liver and stomach diseases,
jaundice, dysentery,
rheumatism, painful joints,
abscesses and ulcers, the
healers used bear’s gall and

musk, a secretion from the

deer. The services of the
shaman were only turned to
as a last resort.
Shamans are not the only
healers in a community. They
work alongside herbalists,
midwives and bone-setters.
There can also be hierarchies
of power among shamans
themselves. Among the Yakut
of northeastern Siberia, the
“white” shamans dealt only
with the clean, auspicious
gods of the sky, while the
“black” shamans dealt with
the demonic spirits of the
lower world. The white
shaman prayed instead of
going into a trance, and did
not kill animals as sacrifices,
but consecrated and released
them at the issyakh festival
which marked the traditional
New Year, on midsummer’s
day. The issyakh declined
under the influences of
Christianity and Communism,
but has recently been revived.

HEALING THE SICK, RESCUING LOST SOULS 103
THE WOMAN WHO WAS SEDUCED BY
A MONKEY INCUBUS
Among the Iban of Borneo, many illnesses are
attributed to an incubus who abducts or
seduces the patient’s soul. Incubi are really
animals which assume human form and charm
their victims, preferably married women, with
passionate love songs. A sick woman called
Rabai dreamed that she was having sexual
intercourse with her husband, but as she
awoke in the pale light of dawn she heard the
door being opened and noticed her husband
still asleep beside her. She had been visited by
an incubus who had assumed her husband’s
form. Her outraged spouse sent word for a
very special shaman who had the power to
summon evil spirits to appear in the flesh and
to engage them in a fight to the death. After a
great deal of preparation, the shaman set his
trap in an inner room of the house. He
unshuttered an opening in the rear wall and
laid out a bait of eggs and rice. Then, screened
by a curtain of ikat fabric, he waited clutching
his spear and sang in the persona of the
woman a song of longing to her demon lover:
Calling and crying like a plaintive bird
With the insistent, enticing voice of a lover
These gentle slopes that were bathed at noon
Now call to you
To offer you rice that is sweet and but newly
cooked.
Your darlingest one, day long
She entreats you to come, O Pati Merigi,
To offer you sweet tasting-morsels
As she whispers her yearnings at your waiting
ears.
Then a faint creaking was heard through the
curtain, indicating that the incubus had
arrived, and the shaman’s song changed, as if
the creature were squatting in front of its
beloved and eating. The shaman leaned out
through the curtain, with extreme caution so
as not to startle the feeding incubus, for the
audience to see him. His smooth, calming song
continued but his movements were the
movements of a skilled hunter moving in for
the kill. He drew back behind the curtain and
the tension mounted for another hundred
seconds. Suddenly there was the noise of a
scuffle and the agonized yelping of a monkey.
The audience rushed in and found the room in
turmoil. The food was upturned and scattered
and a trail of splattered blood led across the
floor to the shutter, which was half-torn off its
hinge. The monkey, it seemed, had also
urinated in its panic. It was mortally wounded
and had crawled off into the jungle to die. In
the centre of the room, panting, stood the
shaman still clutching his spear which was
smeared with blood and hairs.
Further incubi that had been molesting
other women in the longhouse were killed on
the following four nights. An anthropologist
who was present obtained samples of the
blood and hairs from one of these skirmishes
and sent them off for analysis. He received the
following reply: “On 24th January, 1951, some
hair and smears on glass slides were received
for examination from Dr Wallace, Medical
Officer in Charge, Third Division.
Examinations carried out showed that the hair
was monkey’s hair and the smears monkey’s
blood. The specimens are being returned to

phlegm and can be fired through the
mouth into a distant victim.
In one account a Catholic preacher
pierced by a virote spends eight months
seeking a cure before coming to a vege
talista called Don Emilio, who succeeds
in healing him. After discussing the cir¬
cumstances and taking the patient’s
pulse, Don Emilio rubs camphor and
blows tobacco smoke on the affected
area and feels around for the dart. He
prepares a mixture of three plants
which “know each other very welE and
then starts to regurgitate the magic
phlegm from his stomach. When the
phlegm is in his mouth, he spends
about an hour sucking the place where
the dart has struck, and as he extracts
bits of it he spits them in the direction
they came from. The plant mixture is
used to loosen any remaining effects of
witchcraft. The patient will need to
return for several more sessions before
he is completely cured.



104 SHAMANS AND CLIENTS
Divining
Divination is a means of discovering
information which cannot be obtained
by ordinary means or in an ordinary
state of mind. Although shamans are
generally diviners, divining does not
necessarily require shamanic powers.
Many societies have diviners without
having shamans. These may be simply
skilled laypersons, like people in the
West who read crystal balls and
teacups. Among the Even of Siberia,
everyone watches the behaviour of ani¬
mals before setting out on a journey
and if they think they see a negative
omen, they will abandon the journey
for that day. Similarly, they often inter¬
pret their dreams as prophetic and lis¬
ten to the crackling in the fire to find
out what will happen the next day.
Some people are better at this than oth¬
ers, but they are not necessarily
shamans. It seems probable that as the
Soviet state eliminated their shamans,
divination may actually have increased
to fill the vacuum.
The process of divination can also be

an integral part of the res¬
cue or soul journey. In
parts of northern South
America, the shaman sets
out to seek advice from his
helper spirits on how to
cure the patient. The
Paviotso shaman in the
Great Basin would go on a
journey in order to seek a
diagnosis and interpret the
cause according to the
images he saw. If he saw
the patient walking among
fresh flowers, the prognosis was good, if
among faded flowers, then death was
inevitable. If he saw that the illness :
was caused by an intrusive object, he
would immediately start sucking it out.
Bones are used for divination by people as
diverse as the nomads of Mongolia (below) and
the Batak of Sumatra ( inset).



DIVINING 105
Divination frequently comes
from dreams, either of the
patient or of the shaman.
The dream may focus on
details or give a broad
impression. When a Yakut
shaman dreamed of having
sexual intercourse with a
spirit lover, he awoke know¬
ing that he would have a
case that day and be success¬
ful; if he dreamed of a spirit
full of blood and swallowing
a patient’s soul, he would
know that the patient was
doomed and would avoid any
commissions that day.
Sickness is only one of the many
problems that beset humans in an inse¬
cure and unpredictable environment.
The food supply (see pp. 106-8), the fer¬
tility of people, animals and crops, bad
weather, social relations and difficulties
in love all provoke anxiety.
Divination is not only
used to address the future,
but may also find out what is
going on elsewhere in the
present. While it seems cer¬
tain that diviners must be
acutely sensitive to clues in
the environment and peo¬
ple’s behaviour, shamans
also use techniques such as
asking spirits for informa¬
tion. The Nganasan shaman
Dyukhade was asked to
locate a man who had been
lost in a blizzard for two
weeks. “The stalks of with¬
ered grass and the bushes around my
tent had no knowledge,” he explained
afterward. “Finally I asked the spirit
owner of a stream and on the third day
he showed me and I found the man,
completely covered in ice but alive.”

ASATCHAQ FLIES FROM
ALASKA TO SIBERIA
A shaman may be able to see
a distant place through clair¬
voyance, send a messenger
there or fly there in person. A
young Alaskan Eskimo man
had been away a long time
trading in Siberia. His father
was worried and asked the
village shamans to help. The
first shaman sent a coloured
bead flying off to the island
where the young man had
last been reported. The bead
returned and told the shaman
that it had seen red spots like
blood by the tents on the
island and that the young
man must therefore be dead.
The second shaman visual¬
ized the island through clair¬
voyance and also saw that it
was red. A powerful visiting
shaman from another village,
Asatchaq, decided instead to
fly there himself.
That night, Asatchaq had
his hands tied behind him,
wings grew out of his armpits
and when the lamp was put
out he started to rise out
through the ventilation hole
and set off towards Siberia.
As he flew past a group of
tents on the Siberian shore
he saw another shaman, his
hands bound like his own,
flying towards him. Asatchaq
tried to ask him for informa¬
tion about the missing youth
but his words turned into
flames and the other shaman
turned round and fled. For a
while the two shamans circled
the village but Asatchaq
feared an attack and moved
on quickly until he reached
the next camp where the
youth had disappeared.
Looking through the hole in
a tent top, he saw the young
man lying there and put his
face to the hole so that the
man should recognize him
afterwards. So powerful
was his flight that when he
returned to the worried
father’s tent he was unable
at first to descend to the floor
and circled around inside the
tent. Finally he collapsed
unconscious and when he
came to, he said, “Your
shamans are fooling you. I
have just seen your son lying
in a tent and I showed my
face to him through the
hole.” Sure enough, the son
returned the next day and
said to Asatchaq, “Last night
I could not sleep and as I
looked up I had a vision; it
was your face, in the hole.”

Obtaining animals
In hunting societies, catching game is so
basic that it has even been argued that it
may be an older and more fundamental
function than healing. Observing the
movements of animals can include the
same sort of location techniques as
those used by the Alaskan shaman
Asatchaq when he had to find a young
man who had gone missing (see p. 105).
These practices seem to be particularly
common in northern and Arctic land¬
scapes, where animals constitute practi¬
cally the only food. In the tropics, some
shamanist peoples like the Batek
Negrito of Malaysia, for whom hunting
is also important, use virtually no hunt¬
ing magic but simply rely on their
knowledge of animal
habits. Others, like
the peoples of
the Amazon,
have elaborate ideas
about shamans and
animal spirits.
A shaman may be able
to locate or lure game
because he or she has
actually been a game
animal. While one Eskimo man was
walking along the shore in Alaska his
soul was abducted by a boatload of
spirits and taken to the land of the
whales. All winter, for eight months, his
body lay unconscious in his house. In
the spring his soul returned in the form
of a whale and allowed itself to be har¬
pooned by his own relatives. He had
returned home, and so his body
regained consciousness. This experience
was his initiation as a shaman, and he
became especially adept not only at
calling whales but also at dissuading
them from giving themselves to enemy

villages, whom he could thereby starve.
Tor most hunting peoples, the fertility
of humans and animals, society and
species, are considered to be intimately
connected. These links can work by
analogy, implying that fertility is in
principle unlimited; or through some
form of recycling of souls, implying that
the store of life-force is somehow finite.
The first approach can be seen in parts
of Siberia, where the reproduction of
game animals was encouraged through
dances and mimes representing their
rutting and mating. At the instigation
of the shaman, a ritual called the
“renewal of life” was performed. This
involved games such
as dancing and
wrestling. All
the dances, per¬
formed by both
sexes or by men
alone, had an
explicitly sexu¬
al meaning as
they sought to

also a duty, and use his

depended. By their actions the shaman
and the hunters had to gladden the
spirits animating these species and
induce them to play the same kinds of
games themselves.
If, as in the second approach, the
life-force is in principle finite, it may be
that souls are reborn within the same
species, as when Eskimos throw the
seal’s bladder or kidneys back into the
sea. On the other hand, among the
Desana of Amazonia, game animals
must be bought at the price of human
lives. The shaman inhales an hallucino¬
genic snuff made from the viho plant
and visits the remote hill-caves of Vai
Mahse, Owner of the Animals. There
the animals hang suspended in bunches
from the rafters of Vai-Mahse’s house,
which is thought of as a large animal
womb. The shaman negotiates for the
release of an agreed number of animals
for the season’s hunting, according to
the orders which the men of his village
have placed with him. But in return he
promises the souls of a certain number
of living people, who must therefore die.
As he walks through the house the
shaman shakes the rafters to wake up
the animals, who then go out into the
jungle. The price of the animal spirits is
calculated “per shake”, and if the
shaman inadvertently wakes up more
animals than he has paid for he has to
reopen negotiations and promise more
human deaths. The people who are to
die in this way will not turn into hum¬
mingbirds, as with ordinary deaths, but

will be returned to replenish Vai
Mahse’s store in exchange for the ani¬
mals which he has allowed the hunters
to kill. Although this exchange of souls
is essential for the community’s sur¬
vival, it causes some anxiety because
people fear the shaman may trade in
the souls of those he dislikes. In fact, he
generally offers only the souls of other
tribes. Disease epidemics that sweep
across neighbouring peoples are some¬
times attributed to a particularly large
deal negotiated by such shamans.
The shaman’s role in obtaining ani¬
mals is obvious in any shamanic society
where hunting is still important. Some
animal-rights supporters have difficulty
understanding the central role of hunt¬
ing in the lives of many indigenous peo¬
ples. In some Eskimo communities,
where the harsh landscape allows no
other way of life, anti-hunting lobbies
have caused social devastation and eco¬
nomic destitution. Modern neo-shaman
ists, however, with an imagery drawn
largely from native North America with
its emphasis on spirit helpers and
power-animals, are often more com¬
fortable with the culture of hunting.

whales. For a whaler to be successful, his wife
had to hold up her own small pot containing
water from a pond, said to be the vaginal
blood of a mythical woman. The moon-spirit
would drop a tiny whale into this pot. The
women did indeed have little whale-effigies of
lamp-oil tar, said to have been dropped into
their pots by the moon. These effigies were
believed to gestate inside the pots and were
guarded carefully until after the hunt was over.

DYUKHADE MEETS THE MISTRESSES
OF THE REINDEER
During the initiation experience of the
Siberian shaman, Dyukhade, his stoat and
mouse spirit-guides led him to a high mound.
He noticed an entrance in the mound and
went inside, where he discovered it was light.
There sat two women who looked like
reindeer and were covered with fur. On their
heads grew branching antlers, and the antlers
of one of them were made out of iron. These
women were the Mistresses of the Reindeer.
They each gave birth to two reindeer calves in
front of Dyukhade. The first mistress released
her two calves and explained to him that these
were to be his sacrificial animals. One of the
calves was to serve the needs of the Dolgan
and the Evenk people, while the other was for
the Nganasan Tavgy. The second reindeer
woman released her calves and said that one of
these would be wild and that the other would
be a domesticated reindeer.
These female divinities explained to
Dyukhade that the fertility of all reindeer
depended on them. They allowed him to pull
one hair from each of them and said, “Put one
hair in your right pocket and one in your left.
With these you will clothe yourself in a
shaman’s costume.”

Protecting the community
The shaman is not a private mystic, but
exists to serve a community. For the
shaman, the community is generally a
fairly small-scale society in which ideas
of the soul combine with a cyclical view
of natural processes, so that an impor¬
tant part of the shaman’s role is to reg¬
ulate and assist the conservation of the
community’s soul force. The Evenk of
Siberia believed in a clan river which
ran around the earth, sky and under¬
world and along which the souls of
deceased clan members passed on their
way to being reborn in the same clan. In
some Eskimo cultures the name soul is
distinct from a person’s other souls and
returns with the name to a new living
being who may or may not be related.
Among the Sora, the new bearer of a
name is not a reincarnation but may
inherit some personality traits from the
last person to hold the name. Each lin¬
eage has a reservoir of names which are
either attached to living persons or are
held in trust by ancestors in the under¬
world, who are only waiting for the
birth of a suitable baby to whom they
can give their name.
The inclusion of some people in a
community or group implies the exclu¬
sion of others. Spirits which appear
helpful to some people may seem to be
hostile to others. The link between
shamans and violence is most apparent
when communities are at war. The soci¬
eties which make most use of spirit
aggression seem to be quite small, and
lacking in a highly formalized social
structure or a strong chieftainship.
One such society is the Achuar who
inhabit the jungle of the Peru-Ecuador
frontier on the upper Amazon. Here
there are no fixed communities, but
widely separated single households in
an almost permanent state of conflict.
There is no cause of illness or misfor¬
tune except someone else’s aggression,
usually in the form of magical darts:
even someone who drowns in rapids is
believed to have been dragged under by
an anaconda sent by a hostile shaman.
Here the power to heal depends on the

power to kill. A cure can be effected
only by a shaman who possesses an
identical kind of dart to that used by
the aggressor, which burrows into the
patient and draws its fellow dart out
into the open by mutual recognition.
These darts can never be annihilated or
put out of circulation. Their impulse
continues indefinitely and the only way
to get them out of a patient is to project
them into someone else.
In the highlands of New Guinea,
the Baruya live in a similar situa¬
tion. Healing and warfare fuel each
other in a never-ending cycle, since
illness is caused by a magic projectile
sent from an enemy village and the
patient can be healed only by
returning the projectile back to
its sender. Shamans work
night after night to extract splinters of
bone, stone or cassowary feather from
their fellow-villagers and fire them back
to the village from which they came.
As a person with extraordinary pow¬
ers, the shaman may need to be held in
check by the society he or she serves.
Both Baruya and Achuar shamans are
considered unreliable. More Achuar
shamans are murdered by their neigh¬
bours than killed by rivals’ darts, while

trol over their magic arrows or spirit

doubles, which sometimes turn against
their own people. In both societies, a
shaman could not avoid attacking peo¬
ple because this would also amount to a
refusal to heal.
Many traditional societies see sor¬
cery as integrally related to healing. In
other societies, the roles of healer and
sorcerer are distinguished, at least in
principle. The Sora sorcerer is an inver¬
sion and perversion of the healing
shaman. Yet when the Washo shaman,
Henry, received a vision which steered
him exclusively towards healing and
good actions, it was against a back¬
ground of tradition in which shamans
were expected to be sorcerers as well.
The shaman’s techniques as such are
morally neutral, but within the commu¬
nity much shamanic activity is con¬
cerned with morality, and many areas
of social behaviour may be regulated
and arbitrated through the shaman. In
this respect the shaman is not so much
a psychotherapist as a sociotherapist.

ATTACK, CURE AND COUNTER-ATTACK
Running through the centre of the picture is

tributaries (2). The territory of the Momol
clan is marked by (3), showing the clan’s
sacred ceremonial tree (4), the Mistress of the
clan’s territory (5) and the clan's reindeer
guardian spirit (6). The entire territory is
protected by a fence of spirit watchmen (7).
Across the river to the top of the picture is the
territory of the Nyurumnal clan (8) with their
own ceremonial tree, Mistress of the territory
and reindeer guardian spirit (9, 10, 11). The
Nyurumnal clan likewise have their fence of
spirit watchmen (12).
The action begins in the Nyurumnal
shaman’s tent (13) where we see the shaman
and his assistants (14, 15) sending an attacking
spirit into Momol territory to destroy the
Momols. A wavy line (16) shows the path of
this spirit, which penetrates unnoticed and
unchallenged past the Momol clan’s spirit
fence (7), changes into a wood-boring worm,
enters the entrails of a member of the Momol
clan (17) and begins to destroy his corporeal
body. The victim is shown inside his tent (18)
with his wife (19). Now the action shifts to
the Momol shaman’s tent (20). The shaman,
surrounded by clan members (21, 22), starts
to divine to find out the cause of the sickness.
The shaman sends a spirit goose and snipe (23,
24) to the patient with orders to extract the



man’s duty to stay with his family. Not
even shamans are immune from the
moral control of their own system. The
vegetalista and the Baruya shamans
who extract a magic dart will return it to
its sender, who may be killed by it if hit
unexpectedly. The Sora sorcerer’s spirits
can never have enough victims to feed
on and eventually turn on and consume
the sorcerer. This is interpreted as
moral justice: the spirits are evil, but the
result is good. As the Sora say, “The fire
has blown back on him”.
A very prominent mechanism of
morality is taboo and punishment. The

worm. Their path is shown at (25). They poke
their beaks into the sick man’s entrails but the
disease spirit jumps out of the patient and
tries to escape. The shaman sends some more
helpers to catch it. A splintered spirit-pole
clutches the spirit and holds it, while a spirit
knife stands by (26). The shaman then orders
a spirit owl (27) to swallow the disease spirit,
carry it to the abyss of the lower world and
release it through an opening like an anus (28).
Now follows revenge. The Momol shaman
sends a two-headed pike (29) to attack the
Nyurumnals along the track shown at (30).
Inside a Nyurumnal tent (31) the pike spirit
attacks its victim (32) and carries off that
person’s corporeal soul (33, 34). Meanwhile
the Momol shaman reinforces his people’s
defences by building a further fence of larch
spirits (35), overseen by guards made of
splintered poles (36), across the point where the Nyurumnal shaman’s spirit had originally
penetrated his defences. Finally, animals are
sacrificed to the Momol clan’s own spirits and
their skins hung up (37, 38).
This picture shows both ordinary and
shamanic reality, as well as a succession of
events making up a total drama in which the
shaman is the key player. It also shows how
closely Evenk shamanism was bound up with
the community. If war is diplomacy by other
means, here we see how shamanism can also
function as warfare by other means, and that
its healing side appears inseparable from what
we must call sorcery.

punishments often appear dispropor¬
tionately harsh for what might seem a
minor offence, but the actions are more
than they seem. A Wana woman’s men¬
strual blood must _not be burned
because it is the source of human life. In
some Eskimo settlements, the seal’s
bladder must not be eaten, or thrown to
the dogs, but must be returned to the
sea because it is from this that another
seal will be regenerated. These actions
represent both a sense of aesthetics and
a powerful respect for the preciousness
of life, in a context where human
actions are believed to affect it. It is in
the nature of an integrated view of the
universe that a wrong action in one
realm may have a bad consequence in
another. Acts like murder and incest
damage the single structure which
encompasses living humans, social
groups, ancestors, spirits, animals,
plants, landscape and elements.
Diagnosis and treatment re-establish
that single moral universe and this act
of repair is seen as a cleansing of ’‘pol¬
lution”. Thus a sick person is a sign of
a fault in the cosmos, so that both tend
to be healed together.
ASATCHAQS DUEL WITH A SHAMAN
FROM SIBERIA
After he flew to Siberia to find his host’s
missing son (see p. 105), Asatchaq became
famous in that part of Alaska. He was on a
later visit there with his wife when another
shaman came across the ice from Siberia on a
dog-sledge. The Siberian shaman had heard
that there was a great shaman on the Alaskan
side and wanted to compete with him. That
evening, the Siberian started to perform. He
cut off his tongue, swallowed part of it and
gave the rest to the dogs. Then he gouged out
his own eye, ate all of it except the iris and
threw that to the dogs. As a wind blew in
through the entrance of the house, it brought
the parts of his body back into place. Then the
Siberian started to drum and the lamps were
put out. He summoned his spirit helper and
Asatchaq’s wife felt so ill that she started to
die. Asatchaq began to revive her while the
Siberian boasted that he could kill anyone he
wished. Then Asatchaq produced his kikituk
and walked around the house stopping at
every sick person and making the effigy gnash
its teeth at them, which was his standard
method of healing. When the Siberian shaman
was off his guard, Asatchaq jabbed the kikituk
several times into his back. The next

Shamans and the state
Just as shamans do not function except
in a society, so they do not work in a
political vacuum. Shamanism is not
timeless: all forms of shamanism that
are known of have changed constantly
as they have been affected by contacts
between peoples, struggles for territory,
inter-tribal warfare, the growth and col

history. Such a standpoint allows him
label different forms of shamanism
as more and less authentic (for example,
techniques using hallucinogens are con¬
sidered a mark of degeneracy).
Closer attention to political context,
however, shows that Eliade’s archetypal
forms emerge from diverse and compet
ing political and religious practices
which closely reflect the struggles
strategies of the moment. Too close
focus on the shamans initiation and
career may simply repress our aware¬
ness of history.
Political power resides in the ability
to control other people’s actions, so
that it is not only spiritual power which
is based on ideas of fertility, blessing,
ancestry and helper spirits. In the kinds
of society where people widely believe
in such things, they are also the founda¬
tion of political power. Genghis Khan's
justification for trying to conquer the
world, and massacring the populations
which stood in his path, lay in his sup¬
posed descent from the god of the sky.
Indeed, at the same time as being the
most archetypal region for Eliade’s clas¬
sic shamanism, Mongolia, south Siberia
and Central Asia have been most deeply
involved in the rise and fall of empires.

The Emperor P’u-i was the
last of the Manchu dynasty
that ruled China for more than
250 years. Although P’u-i
himself wished to embrace a
modern, western lifestyle (he
was also known as Henry), his
position as Emperor forced
him to adopt the role of a
shamanic oracle. He was tried
as a war criminal by the Mao
government in 1950.



of their wild forest cousins.
What are the various political con¬
texts in which shamans function? It is
helpful to consider this in terms of the
shaman's relationship to the state.
Societies without a state, such as groups
of hunters, may have a chief as well as a
shaman, or else the shaman may also be
a charismatic leader and warrior. The
Achuar of Amazonia and the Baruya of
New Guinea show a mixture of these
types of leader. They have “Big Men",
or prominent warriors, but it is the
instability of this kind of “chieftain¬
ship'’ which fuels their chronic warfare
and gives the shaman’s magical powers
of aggression such prominence.
Wars take place between villages or
clans even within a larger state, such as
happened among the Evenk within the
Russian empire and the Soviet Union.
This is a way of relating to other, simi¬
lar groups without passing through the
machinery of the state itself One rea¬
son why Sora shamanism does not
include tit is kind of warfare sorcery
may be that the Sora are in sufficiently
close contact with the outside world
that they can now attack each other by
using lawyers from the nearby town or
denouncing each other to the police.
Where people’s political relationships
are tied up with the state, their access to
the divine also takes place through a
correspondingly bureaucratic idiom.
Throughout Asia, helpers are some¬
times spirits of the wild, but are very
often also kings, policemen, generals
and clerks at government offices where
identity documents and permits are
sought and obtained. One Sora shaman
who lived under the British empire says
that his spirits are more powerful than
any other shaman’s because they are not mere Hindu clerks who write by
hand but white typists. Away from state
power, the shaman’s battle or negotia¬
tion takes place with a being who is
powerful but in some ways an equal, as
in a hunter’s relationship with his prey.
As the community is drawn further into
the state this relationship is replaced by
a humble petition at the feet of an
emperor in the sky or the underworld.
While the forms of shamanism are oth¬
erwise similar, the Masters of the spirit
realm among the small northern
Siberian groups are replaced in south
Siberia and Central Asia by a spirit
Khan or Emperor.
Few, if any. shamanisms have avoided
incorporating an awareness of state
power, and where contacts between
shamanic communities and the state
are close, such communities are often
marginalized from the dominant cul¬
ture or the capital. In these situations
shamanism, like possession cults, may
be opposed to an established priest¬
hood, as happens so clearly in the
Indian culture area (see pp.38-41).
Another response to political domi¬
nation is for shamanism to act as a
mark of distinctive ethnic identity or
even as a focus of resistance. In cases
such as these shamanism may be not so
much weak as anti-centrist - perhaps in

keeping with its hunting origin - and
subversive. The picture of the Hindu
world revealed in Sora shamanism
often amounts to a satire or a parody.
Shamanism was widely persecuted m
the Communist world (see pp. 136-7).
A more forceful resistance occurred
in the Ghost Dance of the Indians of
the Great Basin and the plains in
1889-90. This was partly a transforma¬
tion in religious experience and expres¬
sion, under the pressure of political
circumstances. After the military
onslaught of the US Cavalry and the
extermination of the bison by white
hunters, the Sun Dance could no longer
keep its earlier function of seeking
supernatural help in warfare and hunt¬
ing. Many leading Sun Dancers turned
to the Ghost Dance religion. The
founder of this movement was told by
God in a vision that the dead would
return, bringing back with them the
good old days. To make this happen,
the Indians were to dance the local style
of round dance for days on end, an
action which led to many people col¬
lapsing from exhaustion and experienc¬
ing visions themselves. Among the
more warlike tribes, the movement took
on an anti-white tone and ended in
1890 with the brutal massacre of Chief
Sitting Bull and the Sioux dancers at
Wounded Knee. Other groups of Sun
Dancers learned the lesson of this
slaughter. Turning away from any polit¬
ical quest, they redirected their empha¬
sis to healing sickness and promoting
the spiritual health of the community.
Similarly, shamanism may become
particularly associated with women, as
in much of eastern Asia where it has
been subordinated to a Buddhist or
Confucian High Culture which is more
male-centred. Its status need not be
seen as inferior. In Lewis’s classic argu¬
ment, the preponderance of women in
possession cults worldwide provides a
front for a “feminist subculture” in
which women protest obliquely at a
male-centred world. In her study of
Korean female shamans Kendall dis
that the family gods
and ghosts dealt with by women are an

already two different focuses of power,
such as shamans and chiefs, the chiefs
were sometimes incorporated into the
structure of the colonial state while the
shamans were forced to the margins
and persecuted, or else became the
focus for a resistance movement.
Alternatively, shamanic power may
become concentrated at the centre and
the figure of the shaman itself central¬
ized. In the Manehu empire, most kinds
of shaman remained in the forests of
northern Manchuria while clan shamans
came to court and evolved into little
more than priests, unable to enter trance
at all. Shamanic guardian spirits such
as the white pheasant became mere
heraldic devices on army uniforms. An
18th-century emperor decided to revive
the tradition of shamanism as central
to Manehu identity by writing it all
down. The result was to create a
shamanic state religion which lasted
until 1911. but one in which all the
dynamic and expressive elements of the
old oral tradition were smothered in the
complicated ritual texts and civilized
manners of Confucian court etiquette.

Dramas and roles
The smell of food being prepared, the
sweat of the audience packed closely
together, the atmosphere of expectation
or fear, the joking, the distractions
of children cutting across the
arena, the music, song, dance,
drama and mime - all these
are inextricably entwined
with the methods of ritual to
produce the full experience of
the shamanic rite. Consider the
scene at a funeral as a Sora
shaman sits down to go into
trance, against the throbbing
of drums and the pounding of
feet among people crushed shoulder to
shoulder inside the tiny mud house.
According to the mood of the
occasion and the degree of
their personal involvement,
some people squat on their
haunches and huddle intently
around the shaman arguing
vehemently with the dead as
they appear one at a time and
speak to them through her mouth,
weeping and embracing her
as she is momentarily filled
with the spirit of someone
they loved. A number of people come
and go at the edge of the proceedings
and interpose the occasional care¬
less remark, while others crack
irreverent jokes to the accom¬
paniment of loud guffaws.
From one funeral to the
next, and on many ritual
occasions in between, various
goupings of people find them
selves in constantly recurring con¬
tact as they continue to devel¬
op their complex personal
and social relations long after
some of their number have crossed the
dividing line between life and death.
The initiation or vision quest, and
the maintenance of relations with
his or her helper spirits, involve
the shaman in long periods of
solitude. This led Eliade to see
shamanism as a “mysticism ...
at the disposal of a particular
elite”. But being a shaman is
ultimately a public role and the

that shamanic action is sometimes
highly theatrical is not to imply that the
shaman is “only acting”, as
though this were something
false. Rather, the performance
transforms the inner reality or

range of people who are
involved in a number of differ¬
ent ways. It is this which makes

but whose consciousness has been
transformed through a powerful associ¬
ation with spirits. The audience is
sometimes even able to test this para¬
dox, as when they put a Sora shaman’s
baby to her breast while she is incarnat¬
ing a male ancestor (see p.65).
Shamanic performance is a highly
skilled activity in which the delicate col¬
lective mood is vulnerable to collapse,
resulting in the failure of the purpose
of the ritual. In this light, healing power
is a form of artistry. The Kwakiutl,
Quesalid, became a great shaman
because he performed as
one and it was his success
at performing which gave
him the power to cure (see
pp.89-90).
There are gradations of
theatricality and expertise,
just as there are gradations
of shaman. In many parts
of the world, shamans are
not distinguished sharply
from other people who
have some degree of the
same skills, such as divin¬
ers. The term “shaman
ship” is helpful here, since
it suggests a talent or inclination like
musicianship or craftsmanship which is
spread variously among different per¬
sons. The shaman gives a full-scale

Kendall has movingly doc¬
umented the attempts of a young Korean woman,
Chini, to act out her initia¬
tion as a shaman. Her own
state of faith regarding her
spirits is not clear but whatever it is, she
is unable to make the leap from this to
successful performance.
Some leading neo-shamanists have
taken anthropologists to task for an
overemphasis on shamanic performance,
arguing that it leads them to concen¬
trate on the superficial form rather than
the spiritual content of much shamanic
activity because they are reluctant to
treat the shamans’ experiences of spirits
as real and discuss these instead. While
the neo-shamanists are surely right in
this, the problem lies in an incompati¬
bility between views of reality rather
than in the notion of performance itself.



A Nepalese shaman dances around the “world
mat" - on which chaff is separatedfrom grain
in an effort to find a patient's departed soul
(below). The shaman who spots the soul
(above) is staring off into the other world.
The view of performance which they
condemn presupposes a separation of
the shaman from the audience which is
found only in some highly formalized
traditions of theatre. However, if daily
life is seen as a kind of drama in w'hich
every participant has a role, then a
shamanic performance becomes simply
an intensified form of this.
In a shamanic performance the
shaman interacts with the spirits, the
immediate patient, and also with the
wider audience, which amounts in some
sense to society itself. The shaman's
relationships with spirits and with
patients are respectively the focus of
different phenomenological and thera¬
peutic interpretations (see pp.70- 73 and
98-103). It is also possible to explore
the question of how' far familiar spirits
may be considered an expression of the
shaman’s relation with aspects of his or
her ow'n self.
The involvement of shaman and
audience has recently been explored in
performance theory. Here, shamanic
ritual appears close to post-modern
theatre, in which the performance is not

a finished product but a continuing
process of self-expression. Many
anthropological approaches imply that
ritual performance acts out some hid¬
den cultural script, but it is perhaps
more appropriate to suggest that
the culture itself is constantly being
formed and reformed through these
performances. The narrative force of
shamans’ accounts of their initiations,
journeys and battles, the initial uncer¬
tainty and step-by-step detection work
of divinations and confessions, all make
it clear that something vital is being
created on the spot by a collective con¬
sensus as the performance proceeds.
There are important levels on which
the roles of shaman, patient and audi¬
ence cannot be sharply distinguished. A
rite to heal one sick person is also a rite
to ensure the continued good health of
the group. The mutual involvement of
persons in shamanistic societies often
ties their perceptions and their fates
very closely together. When a group of
Sora crowd around a shaman to argue
with an attacking spirit and defend
their sick relative, they also know that if
the patient dies, he or she will become
an aggressive spirit which will pass on
its own terminal sickness to those who
remain alive. Similarly, the shaman’s
initiation is an inner drama which must
somehow also be witnessed by the pub¬
lic. Shamans are constantly judged for
their effectiveness. Atkinson’s study of
the Wan a of Indonesia shows how
shamans must continually use perfor¬
mance in order to prove their shaman
ship and to win public confidence.
THE NEED TO PERFORM DIAGNOSIS BY DANCE
In Siberia, some shamans suffer if they have
not performed for a long time. Recently
among the Evenk a female shaman fell ill and
asked another herdswoman to heat a piece of
iron until it was red hot and then give it to her.
She took it and began to lick it and the iron
hissed until it became cold. The shaman said
that her soul felt at ease at last, she fell into a
deep sleep and awoke the next morning fit and
healthy again. Although he is not a shaman,
her son sometimes has the same need.
A Yakut shaman sets out dancing after a
woman’s sick soul by springing like his
reindeer spirit mount and tapping himself with
a stick as he goes. He dismounts, ties up his
deer and continues on foot. Then he becomes
a hawk, flies and lands. Meanwhile his
reindeer and the reindeer-vehicle of the evil
spirit engage in battle, while the shaman slips
off to look at the condition of the patient’s
soul and dances his reaction to the state of the
patient, whether curable or doomed.

THE MANY PEOPLE AFFECTED BY A SHAMAN S PERFORMANCE: THE WOMAN WHO DIES TO SAVE HER BABY
The following extract from a dialogue between
the living and the dead among the Sora gives a
glimpse of the wide range of persons whose
lives can be involved and changed in a
shamanic performance. The words are spoken
through the mouth of a frail old female
shaman nicknamed Rondang, meaning “Bag
of Bones”. The dead woman, Panderi, was a
young wife who died suddenly after carrying
her baby through the jungle. At first Panderi
tells how closely integrated she felt in the
family of her husband, whom she married only
recently and with whom she was very much in
love. Her husband is present but too overcome
with grief to speak and the dead woman
converses with his female relatives:
Panderi (dead woman): [faintly] I got eaten
up, I got drunk up, mothers [describing the
action of an attacking spirit].
Mother-in-law (living): Ah my dear, it was so
sudden, just like that, you ... [continues
inaudibly].
Panderi: After I came and joined your group,
mothers ...
Mother-in-law: [rising out of inaudibility] Yes,
“this is my house, my home” you said ... Have
a drink before you go.
Panderi: [same small, shaken voice] O dear,
really I got eaten up, I got drunk up.
Mother-in-law: [near-inaudible monotone]
Didn’t we do all your healing rites and
sacrifices whenever you needed them? Yet if
only you’d been ill first we could have done
something this time. Didn’t we do all your
sacrifices?
[It emerges that Panderi was killed by a gang
of spirits who had intended to kill her baby,
who is the only son and heir of her husband’s
family, but that she bent over to protect him
and the spirits killed her instead.]
Panderi: It’s not that; but your little grandchild
would have been swallowed right up and l
would still have been alive. I bent down to
protect him, mothers, and they ate me up
instead.
Mother-in-law: Yes, if they’d got the child,
you’d have been all right.
Panderi: Yes, they ate me right up. [Calling
out:] “Ah, really, help me, fathers. Ah, really,
help me!”, 1 cried, “Ah aunts, Ah uncles. Ah
mothers-in-law, Ah fathers-in-law!”
Mother-in-law: How could we see you?
[Not only does Panderi feel close to her hus¬
band’s family, she actually defied her own fam¬
ily in order to marry him. Her family disap¬
proved of the match because the couple were
cousins of a prohibited degree. The day she
died her brothers brushed her husband aside
and plundered the couple’s house for her per¬
sonal ornaments on the assumption that the
baby would not survive to inherit them since
other women will not breastfeed orphans.]
Panderi: [tearful] “Where’s my husband,
where’s my husband, I want to be with him, I
want to speak to him, where’s your nephew,
where’s your son?” is all I cried. [Quiet again:]
They ate me up fresh-and-alive. [Fast
hysterical monotone:] “Ah husband. Ah
spouse, now that we’ve stopped being cousins,
you do my sacrifices instead of my brothers.
Ah fathers, Ah mothers!” I said - [her mother
in-law is speaking very fast in the background,
words inaudible] Your child, your grandchild,
they would have beaten him and snatched him.
but I screamed, “O gai, my baby! O gai, my
baby!” and bent down over him, so they ate
me up instead.
At the inquest it emerges step by step that the
gang of dead people who ate and drank
Panderi was led by one of her husband's
cousins who stands in exactly the same
relationship to him as do Panderi’s family.
The attacker is understood as a symbolic
representation of her own family and the
attack is seen as a fulfilment of their wish to
destroy her marriage. This wish was also partly
acted out by her brothers when they took back
their sister’s ornaments. But for the moment
the baby is still alive and the husband goes to
the extraordinary lengths of taking him to a
Christian orphanage. Meanwhile, at every
seance where she appears, the dead Panderi
continues to assert her loyalty to her husband’s
lineage and she finally persuades her younger
sister to marry the husband in her stead. The
interpretation of her death gives expression to
conflicting views of her marriage. Whereas in
the early stages it seems as if her family’s view
of the marriage will prevail, by the end the
husband is able to see Panderi’s death as an
act of self-sacrifice and the supreme expression
of her love.

A summary of shamanic procedure
COMBING THE HAIR OF THE WOMAN AT THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA
The father of the sea spirit Takanakapsaluk
cruelly cut off her fingers, which turned into
the different species of sea creatures on which
the people depend. So it is only as a result of
her suffering that humans can live and she
may grant them animals or withhold them at
will. When there is an incurable sickness, a
hunter is particularly unsuccessful, or an entire
village is threatened by famine, a shaman may
be employed to descend to the seabed. He sits
behind a curtain and after elaborate
preparations calls his helpers, saying again and
again, “The way is made ready for me, the way
opens before me!” while the audience replies,
“Let it be so!” Finally, from behind the curtain
the shaman cries, “Halala - he - he - he, halala
- he - he!” Then, as he drops down a tube
which leads straight to the bottom of the sea,
his voice can be heard receding ever further
into the distance until it is lost altogether.
During the shaman’s absence, the audience
sits in the darkened house and hears the
sighing and groaning of people who lived in
the past. As soon as the shaman reaches the
seabed, he has to dodge three deadly stones
which churn around leaving hardly any room
to pass. The entrance tunnel to the sea spirit’s
house is guarded by a fierce dog over which
the shaman must step; he is also threatened by
her father. He enters the house and finds
Takanakapsaluk with her lamp and a great
pool of sea creatures beside her, all puffing and
blowing. As a sign of her anger, she is sitting
with her back to the lamp and the pool. Her
hair is filthy and uncombed and hangs over
her eyes so that she cannot see. The dirt on her
hair and body represents the sins and misdeeds
of humans. The shaman turns her gently
towards the lamp and the animals and combs
her hair, for she has no fingers and is unable to
do this for herself. Then he tells her, “Those
above can no longer help the seals up by
grasping their foreflippers,” and she answers,
“The secret miscarriages of the women and
breaches of taboo in eating boiled meat bar
the way for the animals.” When the shaman
has mollified her, Takanakapsaluk releases the

animals and they are carried out by a torrent
into the sea, to be available again to hunters.
Now the shaman returns. He can be heard a
long way off returning through the tube which
his helper spirits have kept open, and with one
last “Plu - a - he -he” he shoots up into his
place behind the curtain, gasping for breath.
After a silence he says, “Words will arise” and,
one after another, people start to confess their
misdeeds, often bringing out secrets which
were quite unsuspected even in a small
community living at close quarters. In
particular, many women confess to having
concealed miscarriages. After a miscarriage
has taken place, all soft skins and furs
belonging to everyone inside the house must
be thrown away. This is such a serious loss that
a woman may try to conceal any miscarriage
or irregular bleeding. By the end of the seance
there is such a mood of optimism that people
may even feel grateful to the woman who
caused the problem.

The diagram on the right repre¬
sents a typical pattern of
shamanic action, leading
from a problem through a
struggle to a resolution.
The initial problem may
be a single illness, an epi¬
demic, or a life-threaten¬
ing economic crisis such
as crop failure or a
shortage of animals.
Given that there are inti¬
mate causal connections
between any human actions
and the behaviour of the surrounding
environment, these afflictions may well
be a consequence of incorrect human
behaviour such as a breach of taboo.
The cosmos must therefore be healed
along with the humans, and it is the
cosmos which provides the arena for
action. At the same time, the cosmos
also represents the human community
or even the single person, as can be seen
most intensely from a gynaecological
expedition of the shamans helper spir¬
its into the patient’s womb (see
pp. 158-9). Against this cosmic back¬
ground, the object of the shaman’s
attention is the community or the per¬
son: the person’s soul may have been
abducted, or the community risks star¬
vation. The drama is acted out simulta¬
neously in physical, psychological and
sociological idioms, all of which are
encompassed in a religious attitude.
The shaman is able to act because of
a relationship with spirits which gives
him or her efficacy at the point in the
spirit realm which is causing the prob¬
lem. The shaman is qualified through
initiation, repeated practice and public
approval of his or her performances.
The shaman is able to summon reliable
helper spirits and overcome or tame
hostile ones, because he or she has suf¬
fered in a comparable way, for
example by dying and then
being resurrected.
The action taken by
the shaman brings his or
her qualification into the
cosmic arena, through
the technique of trance
which makes possible
the journey to the
realm of the spirits.
The centrepiece and turn¬
ing point of the rite is the
encounter between the
shaman and the spirit who has power
over the client. This may take the form
of a physical battle between warriors, a
tender coaxing between hunter and ani¬
mal, a negotiation between business
partners, a debate between a cunning
opponent and an even more ingenious
shaman, or a plea for mercy from a sup¬
plicant to a mighty lord. Whichever

must prevail if the problem is to be
resolved. The opposing spirit must be
defeated, outwitted, won over, led to a
compromise or made merciful. This is
an opposition, maybe in the form of a
literal dialogue, between the wrong way
things are at the moment and the right
way the community wishes them to be
in the future. It is here that the rite’s full
implications are acted out most explic¬
itly on every available level - in music,
dancing and words. The shaman may
also extract a harmful object from the
patient's body, thereby removing an ill¬
ness physically. There may be a cathar¬
sis, as people purge their “uncleanness”
through public confession and repair
their poisoned social relations. In a way
which is by no means “merely” symbol¬
ic, the personal and social reality of the
various participants will have been
changed for the better.

Understanding
Shamans
■'
At first sight, the shaman’s actions seem
incompatible with the generally accepted
worldview of industrial society. Shamanic
thought conflicts with the “rational” and
mechanistic models of cause and effect which
operate in mainstream science. Yet some
sciences seem quite open to unconventional
ideas at their frontiers, and privately a lot of
to believe in spirits,
challenge that shamanism poses to
modem ideas is perhaps a social and political
ne. Shamanism offers a worldview in which
humans must use their environment not by
dominating it but through a precarious and
hard-won compromise, and at the price of
constant attention and respect.
In a world in which most people’s lives are
becoming ever more depersonalized, a
glimpse into shamanic society offers a view
of relationships between humans based on
the intimacy of the small-scale community
which is fast disappearing. The neo-shamanic
movements in big cities must work against
this background and it remains to be seen
whether shamanic ideas will be able to
serve the needs of modern people in their
increasingly fragmented and rootless society.

130 UNDERSTANDING SHAMANS
Early impressions
Most shamans have not possessed a
written tradition, and so the descrip¬
tions of them that survive have been
written by outsiders. Because there can
be no such thing as a neutral, objective
description, these outsiders saw the
shaman largely in terms of their own
likes and dislikes. The people who were
responsible for the early accounts of the
shaman were representatives of more
organized world religions, and were
often also associated with colonial inva¬
sion and administration.
The Spanish Catholic priests who
accompanied the conquistadors to the
Caribbean and South America after
1492 found Indians who freely admit¬
ted that they were under the spell of
spirits who incited them to warfare,
cannibalism and intoxication. These

sponded closely to

of trance, while under the influence of

that contributed heavily to the brutal
and tragic nature of European domina¬
tion in that region.
The word “shaman” was introduced
from Siberia into Russian literature in
the less fanatical 17th century by the
Russian Orthodox priest Avvakum. He
saw the shaman as a religious figure,
but one who serves the Devil rather
than God. During the following century
the administrators, traders and scholars
who travelled in Siberia thought of
shamans mainly as quacks or charla¬
tans, although they were also seen by
scholars as relics of an archaic form of
religion (see pp.28-9). By the late 19th
century, a view had evolved of the
shaman as a special kind of mad person
(see pp. 138-41).
It was not only the many different
Christian traditions and European
administrations which interpreted the
shaman in their own ways. Buddhist,
Hindu and Taoist civilizations all
encountered shamans and responded
with various strategies of persecution,
assimilation or co-existence (see
pp.38-41 and pp. 132-5).

THE SHRIEK OF A DEMON IN MEDIEVAL MONGOLIA
In the early 14th century, Franciscan friars in
Mongolia would “think nothing of expelling
demons from the possessed, as they would
expel a dog from a house”. They would take
the “idols” (ongons or spirit-dolls) of the
possessed person and carry them to the fire,
but the idols would leap out of the fire again.
“Because of this the brothers then take holy
water which they throw into the fire. The
demon flees from the fire and the idols are
burnt up. Then the demon in the air shrieks,
‘See, see how I am driven forth from my
dwelling-place!’ ”

AN ORACLE OF THE DEVIL
A ceremony involving a South American
shaman who has taken hallucinogenic snuff
is described by the Spaniard, Oviedo: “They
worship the devil in diverse forms and images
... They make a demon they call cemi, as ugly
and frightful as the Catholics represent him at
the feet of St Michael or St Bartholomew; but
not bound in chains, but revered: sometimes as
if sitting in judgement... These infernal images
they had in their houses in specially assigned
and dark places and spots that were reserved
for their worship ... And inside there was an
old Indian who answered them according to
their expectations ... and it is to be thought
that the devil entered into him and spoke
through him' as though through his minister ...
These old men they greatly revered ... and
without the devil’s considered opinion ... they
did not undertake or carry out anything that
might be of importance.”

Shamanism in the history of religion
The idea that the shaman is a surviving
archaic religious figure is common to
most outsiders’ interpretations,
whether positive or negative. Eliade’s
book. Shamanism, probably the great¬
est single work on the subject, is sub¬
titled “archaic techniques of ecstasy”.
According to Eliade, “[The] dialectic of
the sacred tends indefinitely to repeat a
series of archetypes, so that a hiero

realized at a certain ‘historical moment'
is structurally equivalent to a hiero

Western scholars have long been fasci¬

origin of religion. In the 19th century,
Tylor claimed that the idea of the soul,
and hence religion itself, arose from
people’s experience of wandering while
dreaming. At the turn of the century

the sociologist Durkheim argued, large¬
ly from his studies of Australian
Aboriginal religion, that the origins of
supernatural beings lay in a projection
of society and that in religion society
was in fact worshipping itself.
Palaeolithic discoveries in the 20th
century (see pp.28-9) opened the way
for interpretations that made the
shaman the key figure in the quest for
the origins of religion. La Barre argues
that all our knowledge of the supernat¬
ural or the divine comes from shamans
and similar visionaries. Since it is
shamans who make the soul-journeys
to the realms of supernatural beings, it
must be they who gave the world its
generally accepted ideas about the cos¬
mos, heaven and hell. Priests merely
represent a “routinization” of the
shamanic role, since they no longer
have the necessary visions themselves.
Even the gods are former, early
shamans who have grown greater since
their deaths. While Eliade would not
have agreed with all of this argument.

he was concerned to distinguish pure
forms of shamanism from degraded
ones. In pure forms, the shaman attains
“ecstasy” by spiritual means alone,
whereas degraded forms include those
in which the shaman relies on hallu¬
cinogenic chemistry for assistance. Such
a viewpoint reduces Eliade to tracing
shamanic strands through the regions
of the world and evaluating them for
authenticity, rather than seeing how
they are actually used and felt by peo¬
ple who also live with other religions as
part of their lives. North and South
American Indian religion is pervaded
with both Protestant and Catholic
Christianity, and even the political
rebellions against the white man have
often taken the form of movements in
search of a biblical kind of Messiah.

concerned with the forms in which the
divine or spiritual manifests itself to us,
and here shamans provide an experi¬
ence that is extremely direct as well as
relatively uncluttered by dogma. The
complementary approach, through theo¬
logy, is concerned with traditions of
interpreting a given body of religious
knowledge which is based on such man¬
ifestations. The understanding of the
Christian concept of revelation can be
greatly helped by study of the shamanic
experience of spirit.
However, while prophets and other
mystics with a direct experience of god
are often crucial in the early stages of a
world religion, in later stages they can
present a dangerous challenge to estab¬
lished authority. The typical shamanic
claim to incarnate or become a spirit¬
ual being can appear blasphemous, a
view which is strengthened under
monotheism. The Christian Church in
later centuries, for example, has tended
to suppress, marginalize or absorb this
kind of mysticism. This authoritarian
religious attitude is echoed even in
modern psychological interpretations
of shamanism, in which the shaman is a
wild, mentally undisciplined person
suffering from a nervous pathology, in
contrast to specialists in more “disci¬
plined" practices like meditation, con¬
templation or science.



SHAMANISM IN THE HISTORY OF RELIGION 135
SHAMANS VERSUS BUDDHISTS IN MONGOLIA
The 13th century was a time of rapid change
in Central Asia. The Mongol chief Genghis
Khan lived in the early 1200s in an old tribal
world with clan shamans. This was no longer
appropriate for the expanded international
horizons of his successor Kublai Khan. As a
boy in the 1220s, Kublai began to have daily
discussions with a Tibetan lama whom he
later made head of a new, institutionalized
Mongolian Buddhist religion in 1264. Kublai
himself adopted the Sanskrit title Chakravarti
and declared himself to be a reincarnation
of the former kings of Tibet and India.
Mongolian Buddhism faded out with the
decline of the Mongol empire, but it was
reintroduced in the 17th century by Lamaist
missionaries who persecuted the shamans to
such an extent that Buddhism has remained
the religion of Mongolia ever since. It has even
survived through the more intense Communist
persecution of the present century. While
Lamaism was called the yellow faith, named
after the Tibetan Yellow Hat sect, Mongolian
shamanism was called the “black faith”. The
lamas called shamanism the “old wrong
way of seeing things”, but as in Tibet and
elsewhere, shamanic and Buddhist ideas and
practices in fact became closely intertwined, so
that they amounted to components in one wider religious system.
Some outlying areas of Mongol culture
never adopted Buddhism. Among the
Mongolian-speaking western Buryats near
Lake Baikal in Siberia, a temple was built in
1840 and fourteen lamas installed. The local,
shamanist population pointed out that the
head lama was keeping concubines. He was
replaced by a local man called Samsonov who
had a wife and children and knew nothing
about Buddhism. Samsonov set up yurts
(tents) and outhouses for his collection of
shamanist dolls (ongons). Samsonov’s son tried
to suppress shamanism but the local villagers
thought that the idea of gaining religious merit
by handing over their wealth to the lamas was
a waste of resources. To escape his clutches,
many joined the Orthodox Church and the
shrines inside their yurts now contained ongons
side by side with icons of St Nicholas.

Communist regimes
Siberian graves had shamanic devices, such as the skins ofsacrificed reindeer, even under Communism.
The Communist regimes of the 20th
century covered much of the heartland
of Asian shamanism, which was perse¬
cuted along with the region's many
other religions. Since there were no
shamanist churches or temples to pull
down, persecution was aimed directly
at the shamans themselves.
In Siberia they were con¬
sidered to be local leaders,
class enemies hostile to the
Soviet regime and were
often sentenced to exile
and sometimes dropped
out of helicopters and
challenged to fly. At the
same time, the Marxist
doctrine of the historical

them as the most primitive

The Mru of Vietnam were able, partly as a
result of their isolation, to preserve shumanic

THE DRUMS WHICH BELONGED TO THE MAN FROM THE KGB
Some time after the terrors of Stalin’s reign, a
Russian anthropologist travelling in Siberia
was helped by some local people. When he
offered to repay their help, he was told, “We
don’t want anything in return, we’d just like to
look at the collection of shamans’ drums
which we know you’ve got.” The Siberians
went to the man’s apartment in the city and
looked at his private collection. One of them
picked out just two of the drums and said,
“You are a good man and these two drums are
all right so long as they remain in your
possession. But if they ever pass into anyone
else’s hands, something terrible could happen.”
The collector was astonished, because he knew
that these two drums had a sinister history.
They had belonged to a KGB officer who had
worked in a remote area of Siberia. This
officer had been in the habit of visiting small
settlements pretending to be ill and asking for
the local shaman. When the shaman appeared
ready to help him, the officer would lead him
to a lonely place and shoot him. He would
then take the drums of the shamans he had
shot as trophies. It seems that many years later
something of this dark history was
communicated to the native man.
THE SHAMAN AND THE POLICE CHIEF
The story is told of how a Soviet police chief
threatened an old Yakut shaman with his
revolver. The shaman told him gently, “My
son, don’t do that, you’ll hurt yourself.”
Somehow, the policeman shot off his own
thumb. He was furious and blamed the
shaman, who was jailed, but mysteriously
escaped and came walking in through the door
of the police station. He was put in ever more
tightly guarded cells, but each time he escaped,
only to turn himself in. Finally he was
sentenced to hard labour in a remote forest,
cutting down a grove of trees and chopping
them up for firewood. An inspection team
visited him in the summer and were astonished
to see his axe flying magically around the
clearing, felling trees and stacking the logs
up neatly. At the beginning of winter the
authorities came to collect the firewood, but
the shaman had disappeared and so had the
stacks of logs. They had joined themselves up
into living trees.
The Yakut anthropologist and poet
Kulakovsky wrote a long poem called The
Shamans Dream in which he predicted the
destruction of the Yakut people under Soviet
rule and urged resistance to the last man. The
first President of the Soviet Republic of
Yakutia was Platon Sleptsov, who was also a
poet and a great singer of traditional Yakut
heroic epic songs. He adopted the pen-name of
Oyunsky, meaning “Son of the Shaman”.

138 UNDERSTANDING SHAMANS
Are shamans mentally ill?
It was from the turn of the 20th century
that scholars and investigators began to
emphasize the psychopathology, “hys¬
teria” or “neurosis” of the shaman.
These views were largely based on the
particularly violent and alarming per¬
formances of the Siberian shamans.
Lommel’s view in the 1960s of the
palaeolithic shaman’s mental disorder
as a necessary stimulus to artistic cre¬
ativity (see pp.28-9) was a significant
step on the road that leads through the
hippy era to the New Age, where the
shaman is seen as perhaps the most
sane of people. The strange behaviour
of shamans while in a state of trance is
now generally thought to lie within the
range of “normal” human behaviour,
and may even be regarded as a univer¬
sal psychobiological talent. The patho¬
logical, ineffectually “fantasy-prone”
shaman of the past has become today’s
creative imaginer. This turnaround of

opinion was helped in the 1960s by the
widespread experimentation with dif¬
ferent forms of psychedelic drugs.
Perhaps the closest parallel to
shamanic “madness” is in the clinical
condition of schizophrenia. A schizo¬
phrenic episode can plunge a person
into terrors comparable to the Siberian
shaman s initiation vision, as his or her
personality disintegrates in the same
way. However, both psychologically
and socially, the differences are great.
Where the shaman’s concentration is
increased, that of the schizophrenic is
scattered; where the shaman retains a
far-reaching control of his or her own
state of mind, schizophrenia entails a
loss of this control; and where the
shaman’s experience is always brought
back to society and shared for society’s
benefit, the schizophrenic is trapped
inside a private experience, almost to
the point of autism.



ARE SHAMANS MENTALLY ILL? 139
Outside trance, the shaman is usually
a normal, even ordinary person. As
with other kinds of creative personali¬
ties, some seem excitable or strange
while others are sturdy and competent
members of their communities. The
existence of the difficult and tempera¬
mental Beethoven does not preclude
or explain - the creativity of a deeply
steady personality like Bach. The surest
argument for seeing shamans as being
basically psychologically sound is that
the community could not otherwise
entrust them with the protection of its
own mental health and livelihood.
The shaman’s mental strength comes
from an expanded experience of mental
disturbance. The initiation is a con¬
trolled disintegration which is always
followed by a reintegration into some¬
one more powerful and more whole.

but has the means to avoid falling in.

THE AGE OF SHAMANIC INSANITY
The Russian anthropologist Basilov
summarizes Russian literature from the early
20th century on the shaman’s mental state: “In
the 19th century the shaman’s wild antics were
given a straightforward explanation. Shamans
were cunning charlatans who pretended to be
possessed by ‘demons’ in order to deceive their
naive fellow-tribespeople. At the beginning of
our century a different opinion arose: shamans
were people of a disordered mind, neurotics.
While this suggestion was still very tentative in
Mikhailovsky in 1892, by 1905 Kharuzin was
proposing ‘to recognize that all true shamans
are above all neurotic persons’. Bogoraz
claimed in 1910 that among the shamans
known to him, ‘many were almost hysterical
and some were literally half-insane.
Shamanism is a form of religion created
through the selection of the most nervously
unstable persons." In 1929 Ksenofontov
published The Cult of Madness in Ural-Altaic
Shamanism while Zelenin wrote in 1935 that it
was impossible for a mentally healthy person
to become a shaman at all."
This view was no more extreme than what
was being written in western Europe and
North America. In 1939 Ohlmarks connected
the “arctic hysteria” of Siberian and Eskimo
peoples with the long winter nights and lack of
vitamins, while other reseachers found similar
hysterias throughout the tropics. Until his
recent death the great psychoanalytic
anthropologist Devereux maintained that
Mohave shamans were mentally ill and he
wrote books with chapter headings such as.
“Insanity due to dreaming of an insane deity”.



PSYCHOANALYSIS AND THE
REGRESSIVE SHAMAN
To the Freudian psychoanalyst the echoes in
every shamanic journey of the trauma of
initiation suggest a neurotic or compulsive
repetition. A fuller version of the story of the
Yakut shaman who rescues a woman from the
raven-headed people in the sky (see p. 101) has
been analysed by the psychoanalyst Ducey.
The rescue is told not from the position of the
woman saved, nor even from that of the
shaman who did the rescuing, but from the
perspective of a novice shaman who watches
the action while he is lying in a nest on the
ninth branch of the world tree, being breast¬
fed by a white reindeer. The shaman who
rescues the woman is older than the novice
and was nursed on the same tree. But he was
nursed only on the eighth branch and is later
surpassed and killed by the younger shaman.
Ducey interprets the story as an oedipal
conflict between the young shaman and a
father figure. The young shaman’s attachment
to his mother is represented both by the
ARE SHAMANS MENTALLY ILL? 141
suckling and by the narrow entrance to the sky
which suggests that the whole incident takes
place inside the womb of the novice’s mother.
The appearance of the older shaman’s head
through this narrow opening represents the
father’s penis during intercourse with the
mother in whose womb the young shaman is
growing. The son is jealous of this intimacy
but can do nothing about it on the first two
occasions. The third time, the intruder is
repelled at the threshold by firebrands.
This excursion into the shaman’s psychology
does not lead Ducey to a pathological
assessment. He concludes that the story is
an allegory of growing up in which the son
replaces the father, and that the initiation
enables the child to emerge from the
“pre-oedipal” world of autistic fantasy
(breastfeeding) and enter the “oedipal” realm
of shared cultural fantasies. The story allows
these fantasies to be fulfilled, but in a setting
of shared cultural experience. The implication
of his analysis seems to be that through his
initiation the shaman lives out the fantasy on
behalf of the wider society.

However outsiders may understand the
shaman’s own mental state, shamanic
societies see a continuity between this
and the state of the patient and of soci¬
ety as a whole. Like the shaman’s initia¬
tion, the patients’ “illnesses” too are in
fact episodes in their overall personal
development. The question “Does the
shaman heal?” is only a smaller part of
the question “Is any of this real?” In
both cases, the answer must move away
from narrow concepts of experimental
scientific validation towards under¬
standing different peoples’ assumptions
about the nature of reality. Procedures

like “reality testing” do not test reality
but test new material against a pre¬
conceived notion of reality. Shamanic
cultures have particular assumptions
about what exists (ontology) and how
things happen (causality). If one shares
these assumptions, then the possibility
of effective shamanic action follows.
Conventional Western medicine also
works in this way. There is a great deal
of ritual, awe and status involved in
most people’s consultations with a
doctor, and the “placebo effect” shows
that people given a dummy pill often
respond to it as well as if it contained
an active medicine. In most situations
where shamans are available, patients
combine shamanic treatment with hos¬
pital medicine in subtle and complex
ways. Conventional medicine in turn is
increasingly influenced by shamanic
attitudes, especially where the focus is
on fostering a good relationship
/
between doctor and patient. The paral¬
lels are closest in psychotherapy and
also where healing involves a social
context, as in group therapy. These
approaches emphasize the need to
understand the world and one’s own
position in it. The ritual works because
it expresses needs and feelings, but it
also changes the patient’s health by
altering perception (see pp. 156-8).
There may be physiological effects but
these are not the only proof of efficacy,

At a funeral among the Sora, a shaman enters a trance surrounded by assistants and mourners.
THE SLOW, PAINFUL PROCESS OF
SHAMANIC HEALING
A little girl who died recently has returned to
speak with her young mother. Her mother is
too overcome with grief to respond and the
talking is done on her behalf by an older
woman, the child’s aunt. The dialogue takes
place during a Sora shaman’s trance just a few
months after the little girl died. The living
regard her with mixed feelings of tenderness
but also fear that she may pass on her illness
to others, as the recently dead always do
among the Sora.
Dead little girl: [arriving from the Underworld,
faintly] Mother, where are my nose-rings?
Living Aunt: [answering for the girl’s mother]
They must have burned up in the pyre, darling,
we looked but couldn’t find them. 1 don’t
know whether they jumped to one side or what.
Little girl: [petulantly] Why aren’t you
showing me my nose-rings?
Aunt: They were so tiny. If I'd found them of
course I’d show them to you. [A pause; the
aunt continues:] Oh my love, my darling, don't
cause your own illness in others. Can you say
that your mother and father didn’t sacrifice for
you? They didn’t turn their backs or refuse to
help you. did they? Think of all those pigs, all
those chickens, goats, buffaloes, my lovely
child. Didn’t your father say, ‘'Let’s light a fire,
let her stay at home and not go out to work,
look at her, she’s already got the face of an old
woman,” didn’t he say that? ... What? Your
two gold necklaces aren’t here. Your brother's
wearing them now....
Little girl: [addressing herself to her silent
mother, and crying] Mother, you were horrid
to me, you scolded me, you called me Scar
Girl, you called me Leper-Girl, you said,
“You’re a big girl now, why should I feed you
when you sit around doing nothing?”
Aunt; She didn't mean it, she couldn't help
saying it: after all. you were growing up and
there were such a lot of chores to do.
Little girl: [sulkily] I want my necklaces ... I
used to hobble round bent double, I couldn't
stand up straight ... [Unreasonable childish
tone:] Why can't I have my nose-rings? I have
to go digging, shovelling and levelling earth
[in the Underworld], all without my nose-rings.



DO SHAMANS REALLY HEAL? 145
My mother gave it to me in her womb, it’s in
her family. I came out in scars all over, my
fingers started dropping off. That illness was
passed on to me, that’s how I got ill.
Aunt: Then don’t you pass it on, don’t you give
it to your mother and little sisters!
Little girl: If I grab them I grab them, if I
touch them I touch them, if I pass it on I pass
it on: that’s how it goes.
Aunt: Your cough, your choking, your scars,
your wounds, don’t pass them on ...
Little girl: My Mummy doesn’t care enough
about me freturns to the Underworld].
The effect on the girl’s mother is at first
completely devastating, because the little girl’s
reproaches exactly mirror what we might call
the mother’s own self-reproach. It is in the
evolution of this dialogue over the course of
the next few years that the healing power of
Sora shamanism lies. The little girl will
gradually come round to saying that her
mother was a good mother and that no
grudges remain. Because these early, cruel
conversations so closely match the feelings of
the mourners, the later modification will be
equally convincing. It will also be comforting,
as the girl becomes disinclined to pass her
illness on to her living relatives and turns into
a supporting and protective spirit instead.
the: healing power of dialogue
Shamanic healing may involve a dialogue
between the patient and someone else, either
the shaman or a spirit. This is carried to
extraordinary lengths in Sora shamanism but
is also present in psychoanalysis, which is
likewise a “talking cure”. A Sora patient talks
to the dead through a specialist, while a
psychoanalyst’s patient talks to the specialist
about other, absent personalities in the
patient’s life.
The diagram shows the logical relations
between these two approaches and clinical
psychiatry. From left to right, it depicts a
progressive separation of the body from the
soul or mind and the emergence of the
category “medicine” as a readiness to treat the
body on its own. At each stage, what is at issue
is not the nature of reality, but the
appropriateness of technique. What is trimmed
off at each stage is not simply a spiritual
aspect of the patient. The inclusion of the soul
means not just that the body is seen as related
to it, but also that the person is seen in
relation to other persons. So what is trimmed
off is a layer of integration in the social
dimension of the whole encounter - that is, the
degree of dialogue involved. As a form of
psychotherapy, Sora shamanism is based on a
dialogue which takes place between the
mourner and the person on whom his or her
attention is focused. Psychoanalysis is likewise
based on dialogue, but the other speaker is
absent and the analyst plays the role of a pale
substitute. Clinical psychiatry, in its use of
tranquillizers and shock therapy, does not use
dialogue as a therapeutic technique.

146 UNDERSTANDING SHAMANISM
Kinds of consciousness
The 1960s’ emphasis on psychedelic
drugs has been largely superseded by a
much wider interest in the whole range
of what are now called “altered states of
consciousness” or ASC. Psychologists
are not so concerned with the question
of the reality of spirits or of their social
context. Instead, they tend to look for
the universal human psychobiological
potentials which are supposedly cul¬
ture-free and which can be reproduced
and studied under laboratory condi¬
tions. This research uses neurophysio¬
logy (the study of the nervous system)
especially the relationship between
drum rhythms and brain-waves - and
chemistry, through the study of opiate
like compounds called endorphins.
New Age and neo-shamanist practi¬
tioners share this commitment to the
idea of states of consciousness that are
independent of cultures, for although
they find some ethnography fascinating
and moving, they do not wish to be
closely tied to all its specific features.
Some authors speak of a general reli

gious state of consciousness or of a
trance state which encompasses both
shamanism and possession. Others
identify a distinctive shamanic state of
trance or ecstasy based on the shaman’s
experience of soul flight. Although
some speak of a single “shamanic state
of consciousness”, it seems increasingly
likely that there are many.
A broader and more far-reaching
approach is offered by Walsh, who dis¬
putes the belief that shamans, yogis and
Buddhists all “access” the same state of
consciousness. He argues that just as
shamanic consciousness was previously
confused with pathological states like
schizophrenia, it is now confused with
meditative and yogic states. Even this
shamanic consciousness must vary
between the clear light of an exhilarat¬
ing journey to the sky and a terrifying
journey to murky worlds below the
earth. Biochemical and physiological
measurements, says Walsh, are not
needed if we concentrate on what peo¬
ple say they experience, an approach

which for thousands of years has
allowed mystics to classify states of
consciousness with great precision in
many different schools and practices.
Walsh characterizes the shamanic
states of consciousness as being
intensely concentrated. The shaman’s
experiences are coherent and highly
organized according to the purpose of
the journey and the symbolic imagery
used in a given society. Walsh contrasts
this with Patanjali’s method of yoga
and Buddhist vipassana insight medita¬
tion. The former is based on unwaver¬
ing concentration on inner objects and
the latter on a fluid attention to all
objects. In their calmness, however, they
both differ from shamanic conscious¬
ness, which is a highly aroused state as
the shaman flies between worlds and
battles with spirits. Although Walsh
does not say this, such a comparison
makes the shaman’s degree of control
appear only partial, as the relation with
spirits is a tempestuous and stressful one.

ways of talking about consciousness use
metaphors of space and maps. One
current neo-shamanist project aims to
map, literally, the realm of non-ordi¬
nary reality. But one can also see the
shamanic journey’s movement between
locations as a metaphor for changes
of consciousness which cannot be
expressed in any other language.
ENDORPHINS AND ENDURANCE
While drumming and
hallucinogenic plants
provide an external
trigger for psychic states,
the question remains of
how the body and the
mind respond to them.
During the 1970s,
biologists reported that
under certain kinds of
stimulation the body
produces its own
substances, called
endorphins, which are similar to morphine
and reduce the body’s
sensitivity to pain by
attaching themselves to
receptors on nerve cells.
As well as analgesia
they can induce
euphoria, amnesia and
altered states of
consciousness. The role
of endorphins in
inducing shamanic states
of consciousness and
making possible feats of
endurance remains
obscure. They cannot
explain the content or
emotional tone of the
shaman’s experience.

ZEN AWARENESS
There are many states of
human consciousness. The
consciousness in Zen
Buddhism is different from
that in vipassana Buddhism:
In Zen, the way people
should move towards perfect
composure is to forget
everything and to have
nothing at all in their
consciousness, no trace or
shadow of their thinking.
Then their minds will be able
to see and feel things as they
are. But if they try to stop
their minds consciously, this
will only give them another
burden and they will become
preoccupied with the need to
stop their minds. There are
different schools of Zen,
according to whether
composure is approached
mainly through meditation or
by contemplating koans, or
paradoxical questions such as
“What is the sound of one
hand clapping?” or “What is
the meaning of Mu [a
nonsense sound]?”
A Zen master says: “Do
not try to stop your mind,
but leave everything as it is ...
Things will come as they
come and go as they go.
Eventually your clear, empty
mind will last fairly long.”
INHIBITIONS
A shamanic state of
consciousness can be reached
and maintained only with
difficulty. Chini, a young
Korean candidate, has been
suffering torment because
she is destined to become a
shaman and yet cannot act
out the performance for her
initiation. The gods have not
yet empowered her to act as a
shaman for clients. At a first
ceremony she was cleansed of
unwelcome ghosts; by the
second one it is hoped that
the spirits will give her the
necessary powers. But at the
ceremony, Chini cannot lose
herself in the performance
and give herself to the spirits.
Her living teacher shouts
instructions, “Jump and keep
shouting out the spirits’
commands,” but Chini keeps
lapsing into silence. A
Buddhist sage, speaking
through her mouth, explains
that an intrusive spirit is
blocking her and the spirits
will not grant her the power
without a further year’s hard
work. Chini keeps doing
everything wrong and the
more her teacher corrects her,
the more she gets flustered
and her mistakes increase.
This obstructing spirit turns
out to be Chini’s own
pockmarked sister, who was
destined to become a shaman
but who committed suicide
instead. This dead sister casts
an inhibition on Chini’s
ability to perform as a
shaman, an inhibition which
may be permanent.



150 UNDERSTANDING SHAMANS
New shamanic movements
The picture of the shaman as psychotic
persists in some quarters even today,
but it has largely been eclipsed by a new
and more positive evaluation. Aldous
Huxley experimented with mescalin in
the early 1950s and the appreciation of
shamanism has grown steadily since
then both among academic specialists
and in popular culture. From 1968,
Castaneda’s books on the Yaqui Indian
teacher Don Juan became cult reading
and posed a serious challenge to con¬
ventional frameworks of reality and
ideas about its limits. The figure of the
shaman is idealized in dissident psychi¬
atry and many other quarters.
This groundswell has been reinforced
by the collapse of European empires
accompanied by a new hesitancy in
Euro-American intellectual colonialism.
Western industrial culture has begun to
suffer an increasing loss of confidence
in Christianity and the scientific world¬
view. A similar disillusionment has
taken place in the former Communist
world. This process has led to a spiritu¬
al quest which has been met by diverse
forms of religion such as charismatic
churches, Buddhism or paganism.
Among these, shamanism is seen as a
non-institutionalized, undogmatic form
of spirituality which offers considerable
scope for personal creativity. Currently,
“shamanism” is taken by young people
as the ultimate form of individual free¬
dom in electronic “techno” dancing, a
far cry from the scholarly obscurity of
early 20th-century shamanic studies.
From the 1970s, new shamanic move¬
ments have sprung up in the USA and

Europe. These combine the
legacy of the drug culture
of the 1960s with a long¬
standing interest in non
Western religions, current
environmentalist move¬
ments, strands of the New
Age movement and all the various
forms of self-help and self-realiza¬
tion. Popular anthropology has
also contributed, especially via the
work of Castaneda. These move¬
ments take the strongest form of
the view that shamanism is
opposed to institutionalized reli¬
gion and political systems and speak
of a democratization of shamanism in
which every person can be empowered
to become their own shaman. They
think of shamanism not so much as a
religion but as a view of reality and an
effective technique.
Teaching is carried out by various
foundations and groups using weekend
workshops and other courses with sup¬
porting literature and tapes. Neo
shamanists interpret the shamanic
“altered state of consciousness” as a
universal human potential which is only
partially realized in any given tradition¬
al culture. For example, the Harner
Method teaches a “core shamanism”
which has been abstracted from several
different cultures. The North American
founder of this method, Michael
Harner, has said that “many of these
traditions have a lot of elements in
them that are not really shamanic, but
relate to the cultural configuration
[and] have no relevance to us in our cul¬
ture. I’m trying to understand the basic
universals of shamanism and to present
these bare bones to the people I teach
[so that they can] integrate these things
into their own lives.”
However, this approach raises prob

Traditional cultures form almost the
entire history of shamanism and pro¬
vide the basis for our knowledge about
it, yet they contain integral elements
which are incompatible with other New
Age values such as vegetarianism, fem¬
inism or a desire to separate healing
completely from sorcery. There is a risk
that the new shamanists may create
their own ideal image of shamanism
and then judge traditional societies as
failing to live up to this image.

SHAMANIC COUNSELLING
“Shamanic counselling” is a term widely used
in some New Age circles and elsewhere. In one
well-established method the patient (here
called a client) is invited to concentrate on a
personal problem for which he or she would
like to seek advice. The client is then helped to
travel mentally to upper and lower worlds in
“non-ordinary reality” and seek guidance from
spirit beings encountered there. It is the client
who makes this journey, rather than the
specialist, and each client is encouraged to
become his or her own shaman. The rationale
for this is that in a “spiritual democracy”
people should not need to seek spiritual
authority from someone outside themselves, at
least not in ordinary reality. The real
counsellors are the spirit guides in non¬
ordinary reality. This technique was developed
by an anthropologist who is familiar with
shamanism worldwide. While travelling under
the counsellor’s guidance, the client is
encouraged to use certain classic shamanic
techniques such as acting out dialogues or
mimed encounters with power animals and
mythic personages. Although real drums are
also used, the journey is often made to the
sound of a tape-recorded drumbeat which the
client hears through headphones. Apart from
being better adapted to life in crowded
apartments, this allows clients to narrate their
experiences as they occur, so that they can
later discuss them with the counsellor.
BACK TO THE PALAEOLITHIC WITH
ACID-HOUSE RAVE
“Trance brings on a liberating state of
consciousness,” says Colin. “ You get into
contact with a space of inspiration and
freedom. That makes people go out of their
heads. After all these psychedelic experiences I
know that somewhere inside there’s a profound
longing to get back to the palaeolithic states
that we used to experience thousands of years
ago. We’re indebted to psychedelic plants for
making the human group stick together and
for an acute sense of the ecological link which
unites us to the planet.”
“All the raves today are a load of crap.” The
Shamen, professionals in tribalism, are fed up.
“Too much hardcore, too much violence, too

speeded up amazingly. “At 160 beats a minute,
180 beats a minute, you get tachycardia. The
rhythm gets you down!” One curious thing:
the rhythm began to go mad when the quality
of the ecstasy went down. “The only stuff you
find now is spiked with amphetamines and
heroin. That has nothing to do with what we
used to know.”

The cosmos within
In Chinese legend, the shamanically inspired trickster-figure of Monkey multiplies

Shamanism is a chameleon-like pheno¬
menon, reappearing across diverse
regional traditions, in varied historical
and political settings and co-existing,
sometimes uneasily, with major world
religions. Shamanic ideas lack the insti¬
tutional framework and the centraliza¬
tion represented by a Pope or a Dalai
Lama, or by the great temples of
Hinduism. Being fluid and innovative,
such ideas can be adapted to work in
the remotest forest, in the court of the
Chinese Emperor or even in a work¬
shop in downtown San Francisco. For
the shaman, any world can be the other
world. In the depths of the Indian jun¬
gle, the other world is that of the bazaar
with its bicycles and aeroplanes, while
in Siberia and Amazonia it includes
doctors from other planets.
Rather than looking for an institu¬
tion we can call shamanism, our under¬
standing should focus on the figure of
the shaman. The shaman unites areas
such as religion, psychology, medicine
and theology which in Western life have
become separate. Through his or her
extraordinary individual experiences



THE COSMOS WITHIN 155
A LANDSCAPE OF LEOPARDS OR A
LANDSCAPE OF PSYCHOSIS?
A Sora landscape is rich in associations and
imagery relating to the lives and the minds of
its inhabitants. The village and surrounding
rice fields at the bottom of the valley are the
domain of ancestor spirits, who are mostly
supportive and nourish their descendants by
putting their own soul-force into their growing
crops. The jungle on the steeper slopes is the
domain of a number of spirits which reside in
trees and rocks and attack the living in order
to absorb them into themselves.
Each of these spirits represents a distinct
form of death, so that someone killed by a
leopard will join Leopard-Spirit and reside in
that spirit’s site. From there, the dead person
will join other leopard victims to attack
passers-by with actual leopards or by
producing scratching and clawing symptoms.
Much of Sora shamanism consists of talking
to the dead and persuading them to become
benign ancestors rather than representatives of
hostile jungle spirits.
A Sora shaman’s patients suffer from the
effects of human consciousness stored in rocks
and trees, rather than from disorders such as
schizophrenia and psychosis. The psychiatrist’s
or psychoanalyst’s patients live in an isolated
world of personal symbolism which can be
shared at best only with their doctor. By
contrast, the Sora mental map is the same as
that of the physical landscape over which
groups of people walk, work and dispute every
day of their lives. This is equally a map of the
social order in the broadest sense. Dialogues
with the dead bring together a crowd of people
who all agree which spirits are where and who
has been absorbed into each of them.
It is this common landscape that furnishes
the means by which both personal experience
and the social order are regulated and
perpetuated. For the Western secular tradition
generally, the structure of experience is based
largely on the structure of the experiencing
mind, with its various subdivisions into
conscious and unconscious, or ego, id and
superego. For the Sora, the mind is not
subdivided but rather the structure of human
experience is based on the structure of the
outside world which the mind apprehends.

the shaman’s means are psychological
but the ends are sociological, to heal
and maintain the community. Even the
shaman’s psychology is partly socially
conditioned: there can be no state of
mind without a history or without the
surrounding politics and social struc¬
tures with all their fault lines and con¬
tradictions. If it is true that shamans
utilize a universal human potential,
then the practice and the valuation of
this potential is constantly changing.
Shamanism is not only a religion or a
facet of religion, it is a very active and
practical one. Although shamans are
mystics and experience the basic pat¬
terns of the world and appreciate them
for their own sake, everything a shaman
does is ultimately directed towards reg¬
ulating some aspect of the world on
behalf of the community. The shaman’s
soul travels in order to rescue the souls
of others, to fight demons and to obtain
food and material resources. A little
Sora girl’s dreams are a private experi¬
ence, but as she becomes a shaman she
places her experience at the service of
her public inside the formalized frame¬
work of ritual. In the Siberian shaman
Dyukhade’s initiatory vision (see
pp.60-61), what the seven cliffs showed
him was not simply how the world
worked but how the cliffs served to fur¬
nish the basic materials for human tech¬
nology.
Shamans and their clients often seem
barely distinguishable, as the universal
human capacity to dream is developed
into a specialized technique of trance,
or as the initiatory illness of the shaman
provides a qualification to treat compa¬
rable illnesses in a patient. All members
of the society share the same cosmos
and landscape. In a shamanic culture,

shaman, but is a basic way of talking
about one’s emotions and social rela¬

the universe, or it may be a geography
of the trees and bus-stops outside some¬
one’s house. The young Sora wife who
died to save her baby (see p. 124) per¬
ished as the direct result of walking past
a certain spot on the path between two
villages. But the connection which was
made between herself and that loca¬
tion also summarized both sides of a
debate about her love for her husband
and gave a verdict on the validity of
their marriage.

This is symbolized by the locations in

“above a great rock, above a great tree,
above a great cliff, above a great scar in
the earth, above a crevasse.” In rescuing
the soul, the shaman removes his
patients from the psychic condition
associated with these wild and wretched
places and transfers them to a whole¬
some state. He leads the patient out of
one metaphor, or state of mind, into
another. This wildness has its uses,
however. These sites and mental states
are reminiscent of those which the

The shamanic cosmos is not only “out there”
but is inside every one of us, and the shaman
who journeys through the cosmos is also
travelling through the community’s own
mental and physical space. Sometimes the
correspondences go further than simply
referring to the community’s familiar
landscape and the shamanic voyage takes place
entirely inside a patient’s body. Among the
Cuna Indians of Panama, each part of the
body has its own spirit or essence which
symbolizes that organ’s function. Childbirth
takes place through an essence of the womb
called Muu. In the following rite to induce
labour, Muu is seen as the shaman’s adversary
but she is not so much an evil spirit as a bodily
function which is not working as it should.
The analogy between the patient’s inner
anatomy and the geography of the cosmos is
made clear: “The inner white tissue extends to
the bosom of the earth... Into the bosom of
the earth her exudations gather into a pool, all
like blood, all red.”
The shaman sits under the sick woman’s
hammock and repeats at great length the steps
by which the midwife sent for him, as if to
make the patient relive precisely and vividly
every step of her own pain. He then
enumerates each helper spirit, called nelegan,
in detail, and gives them special weapons and
equipment: black beads, flame-coloured beads,
tiger bones, armadillo bones and silver
necklaces, but especially their pointed,
penetrating hats.
At last the nelegan enter the patient’s vagina,
and after all this emotional preparation it is
reality, but over-emphasis on a trip of
discovery can lead to a false sense of
shamanhood. The shaman is dedicated
to easing the difficulties of other people,
and the torment of the shaman’s initia¬
tion is also the pain of the community.
The shaman’s performance unites the
inner and the outer worlds, the worlds
of the individual and of society, the
world contained in the mind or body
and that of the cosmos beyond.
quite possible that she actually feels the
penetration. The hats “light up” the route and
this may also illuminate her own state of mind.
Once inside, their itinerary moves across a
landscape which is both the internal anatomy
of a living body and an emotional geography
of the psyche which inhabits it:
The nelegan set out, the nelegan march in a
single file along Muu's wad, as far as the Low
Mountain,
The nelegan set out, the nelegan march in a
single file along Muu’s road, as far as the Short
Mountain,
The nelegan set out, the nelegan march in a
single file along Muu’s road, as far as the Long
Mountain,
The nelegan set out, the nelegan march in a
single file along Muu’s road, to Yala Pokuna
Yala...
Line after line, the shaman enumerates the
ridges and curves as they are passed by his
helper spirits. The patient’s pains take the form
of an alligator and an octopus and Muu’s own
guards appear as a black tiger, a red animal or
a dust-coloured animal. The nelegan tie down
each of these in turn with an iron chain while
it roars and slavers and tears at its
surroundings with its claws and draws blood.
We can only guess the effect of these
descriptions upon the patient, but it must
surely be profound. Finally, the nelegan reach
the womb and use their hats as magical
weapons to win a tournament with the spirits
which they encounter there. Now begins the
return journey. This must induce the birth by
dilating the cervix and vaginal passage and the
nelegan must draw the baby out behind them.



THE COSMOS WITHIN 159
The shaman summons further reinforcements
such as the armadillo, a Lord of the
Burrowing Animals. Whereas on the inward
journey the nelegan squeezed through in single
file, on the return journey they come out
marching four abreast.
In order for such a “cure” to work, the
shaman takes a situation which exists on the
emotional level, but with physical
consequences, and which is essentially chaotic
in its nature, and in what it might signify. The
structure of the chant gives meaning to the
patient’s blockage and pain and gives them an
elaborate and specific relationship to cosmic
order. As with all shamanic journeys, it does

pregnant woman’s womb, told in the primitive

so in a narrative way which allows for the
resolution of the problem through the
convincing unfolding of events. This resolution
induces a physiological process of release
which we can see happening again and again
in the most diverse healing situations
throughout the world. It is the symbols
themselves, existing primarily in the abstract
realm of the mind or soul, which cause the
desired changes in what may be called the
physical world.

What is a shaman?
I shall use the word “shamanism” as little
as the English language allows.
Communism, Feminism, Capitalism,
Buddhism - all these “-isms” are doctrines
or ideologies set up in relation to other
ideologies with texts, teachings and even
political aspirations. Shamans and their
communities have not generally done this,
and shamanic ideas and practices coexist
more or less freely with those of more
formalized systems. Perhaps the shaman’s
activities should be called “shamanry”, like
wizardry, and the shaman’s professional
quality should be called “shamanship”. At
the very least, since there is no unifying
ideology, we should talk of “shamanisms”
in the plural. I have concentrated on the

shamanism of traditional societies because
these are the core of shamanic practice.
Some of the ideas and rites described may
be changed or no longer be practised today.
However, there is a current revival of
shamanism among some traditionally
shamanist peoples.

Concepts of power
The idea of a tree, pillar or mountain at the
centre of the world is found far beyond
shamanic cultures, as in the Mount Meru of
Buddhism or the pyramid-shaped ziggurats
of ancient Mesopotamia and Central
America. I have taken the bus past the Toda
land of the dead in the Nilgiri mountains of
south India. This place is called
euphemistically am-nodr, “That Land”.

Regional Traditions
The religion of the stone age
Hunters, herders and farmers
In most hunting societies, women are not
supposed to handle weapons or kill
animals. Yet sexual taboos on the hunters
show that women are involved symbolically
in the men’s activities. At the start of the
spring whale hunt in Alaska, a woman lay
down where the ice met the unfrozen sea
with her body facing the village. Her
husband’s boat was turned as if returning
from the hunt and the harpooner leaned
over in silence and struck her body gently
with the point of his harpoon. Then the
woman walked home without looking back.
For the rest of the hunt, she did not move
but sat on the sleeping bench, because every
domestic action would affect her husband’s
hunt adversely. If she scrubbed the floor, the
whale’s skin would be too thin; if she used a
knife, his harpoon line would break.

North America
Shamanism in Siberia is largely a thing of
the past. The classic literature on this
region is vast. Most is in Russian and very
little of this has ever been translated into
any western language. Some of the Siberian
material presented here has been translated
for the first time.
Siberia and Mongolia: The best overview of
Siberia in English is Siikala 1978 (see also Eliade
1964). Other excellent overviews are Basilov 1984
(in Russian, partly translated in Balzer 1990) and
Hamayon 1990 (in French). Books edited by
Dioszegi, Hoppal and their colleagues contain
numerous short articles and Dioszegi (1968) is an
enjoyable read. Some important longer works are

Becoming a Shaman
Who becomes a shaman?
Initiation and instruction
Dyukhade’s experience is typically Siberian.
As it unfolds, we see that it is not only ani¬
mal species which have a “Master”, but also
various states of mind and forms of human
experience. The Nanai story comes from
Shternberg, who believed that sexuality was
at the root of the shaman’s experience.

absolutely steady to see sickness, steady¬
eyed, no shivering and shaking.”

Voyages to other realms
Battles with hostile spirits
In Siberia, the Oroch thought that shamans
could fly to the sun, but that this was pretty
pointless except for the sake of the exploit
itself. This journey is extremely dangerous
because of a girl who lives on the sun. Just
looking at her face can blind you and going
near her could burn you up. The path to the
sun passes via the moon. The shaman's soul
would begin its dizzying journey on a
winged horse, then it would rush along on a
roll of thread and on a rag ball with wings,
fly between the constellations, then change
on to a bird and finally approach the sun in
a winged iron boat. On the return journey
he would descend to earth in a winged iron
coffin. Nanai shamans used to visit the sun
on serious business, in quest of children’s
souls for infertile women.

Tricks of the trade
The shaman’s multiple nature
A shaman’s effect is often achieved by
magically creating a resemblance between
an object and the person who is to be
affected. A Wana shaman sharpens a piece
of bamboo, aims it at a victim and sings:
You, oh spirit of bamboo,
make light as I throw.
Over there is the heart to head for.
Make the liver fall out.

Death of the shaman
An old shaman in Nepal had been training
his son for years, but withheld the most
important and powerful secrets until the
last days of his life. On his deathbed, he
gave these to his son, saying, “You were
young and impulsive, I was afraid you
would misuse them. But when I am gone
you will be the senior shaman, you will have
to use these powers responsibly.” Yet even
now the younger man cannot be sure
whether he has received the full richness of
his father’s knowledge, or whether he will
have to build this up himself from
experience and practice.

Dramas and roles
There can be sudden twists in the status
accorded to shamans. During the 1970s in
South Korea, shamanism was marginalized.
The elite regarded it as primitive in
comparison to the more civilized
Confucianism and shamanism was
discouraged officially as a matter of state
policy. However political circumstances in
the 1980s led to the official encouragement
of shamanism as an authentic expression of

A summary of shamanic procedure.
Uvavnuk, the Inuit woman who became a
powerful shaman after being struck by a
meteor, afterward repeated the following
song incessantly:
The great sea
Has set me adrift,
It moves me as a weed in a great river,
Earth and the great weather
Move me.
Have carried me away
And move my inward parts with joy
Her sense of intoxication spread to
everyone else in the house and without
prompting they all began to confess their
own misdeeds and to accuse each other.
And those accused also confessed and lifted
up their arms as if to fling away all evil,
which was was blown away like a speck of
dust with the words, “Away with it, away
with it!” Shortly before she died, Uvavnuk
announced that she would protect her
people from hunger. She obtained a large
number of whales, seals and walrus from
the Mistress of the Animals. The next year,
they had a greater abundance of game than
at any other time within living memory.

Understanding shamans
Early impressions
Shamanism in the history of religion
Communist regimes
Are shamans mentally ill?
Do shamans really heal?
A shaman and client are often more closely
bound together psychically than a doctor
and patient. The view of the shaman as a
“wounded healer”, based on Jungian ideas
of the analyst, combines images of the
shaman’s own vulnerability and of his or
her power. This is not a contradiction, since
the power is based on the vulnerability. In
the typical medical model, the doctor is
presented largely as invulnerable and all
capable, while the patient remains passive
and helpless. In the Jungian model, both
A shaman flies to the other realm with the help
of his animal spirits.



168 DOCUMENTARY REFERENCE
the analyst and the patient have both
wounds and healing powers. The analyst
projects her own experience of being
wounded onto the patient in order to know
the patient emotionally; while the patient
may initially be unaware of his self-healing
abilities and project them onto the analyst
but will later become able to take them
back. This view seems close to much
shamanic healing. For example, Sora dia¬
logues show sick people taking an active
part in their own healing.

New shamanic movements
The cosmos within
An elderly shaman among the Inuit, who
could no longer move about physically, gave
a symbolic acknowledgement to this
physical disability by making the interior of
the igloo serve as a map of the cosmos. The
raised platform became the land, the floor
was the sea, while the spiral arrangement of
the igloo’s snow-blocks became the heavens
with the ice-window serving as the sun and
the door-opening as the moon. The shaman
transposed the different parts of the igloo
throughout the universe and so could travel
there when he needed to locate game for his
community.

Directory of Peoples
This glossary lists only peoples
who are referred to often in this
book and who are likely to be
unfamiliar to many readers.
Especially for smaller peoples
without a state of their own.
ethnic names are unstable and
are often likely to be the names
of clans, subgroups or places
where they live now or where
they came from in the past. In
addition, many peoples are
known to outsiders by names
which they themselves find
insulting. I have used their
own names wherever possible,
although this sometimes causes
problems. For example, there is
now no fully acceptable word to
cover all the groups previously
known as “Eskimo”.
Buryat A people speaking a
language close to Mongolian
and living around Lake
Baikal in Siberia.
Bushman See Kung.
Chukchi A small group in the
far northeast of Siberia,
facing Alaska across the
Bering Strait.
Cuna, Kuna A people of
Panama.
Desana A group in the upper
Amazon, partially
overlapping with the Tukano.
Eskimo A people or group of
peoples spread around the
arctic coastline in North
America, Greenland and
Siberia. The name “Eskimo”,
meaning “Eaters of raw
flesh”, was given them by
neighbouring North
American “Indians” and is
now out of favour. But
although every group has its
own name for itself, these are
very little known worldwide,
except for the Inuit in
Canada. Moreover, there is
no other collective word for
all such groups, so that I
have been obliged to retain
this word more than I should
have liked.
Even, Evenk Two groups of
Siberian hunters and reindeer
herders, previously generally
known by the name Tungus.
The word “shaman” comes
from the Evenk language.
Gurung A non-Aryan people in
western Nepal, probably of
Central Asian origin.
Huichol A native people of
Mexico, widely known for
their use of the peyote cactus.
Inuit The main Canadian
branch of the “Eskimo”. The
name means “humans”.
Kung A people of the Kalahari
Desert on the border of
Botswana and Namibia,
called Bushmen by outsiders
(see San).
Kwakiutl A native people of
British Columbia, Canada.
Lapp An outsiders’ name for
Saami.
Manchu A people of
Manchuria, in northeast
China. Linguistically related
to the Tungus forest tribes,
they became the modern
emperors of China.
Matses A group in northern
Peru. Noted for elaborately
decorating their bodies to
look like jaguars.
Matsigenka Neighbours of the
Matses in Peru, but sharing
little in the way of traditions.
Mazatec A native people of
Mexico, who make an
extensive use of psilocybe
mushrooms.
Mestizo Not really an ethnic
name: in Latin America,
populations of mixed Indian
and European blood. In
parts of the upper Amazon,
their plant-inspired shaman
is called a vegetalista.
Mongol The main inhabitants
of Mongolia, rulers in the
Middle Ages of a great
empire of their own; their
rulers also became the
emperors of China.
Nganasan A small group of
hunters and reindeer herders
in northwest Siberia.
Saami A people of northern
Scandinavia, known by
outsiders as Lapp.
Sakha Called Yakut by Russian
colonists of Siberia. Sakha
was reinstated as their
official name in 1990.
Salish A coastal people on the
border of Washington State,
USA and British Columbia,
Canada.
San A people of the Kalahari
desert, called Bushmen by
outsiders (see Kung).
Sora An indigenous “tribal”
people in the state of Orissa,
India, speaking a Mundu
language.
Tungus see Even, Evenk
vegetalista see Mestizo
Wana A small group on the
island of Sulawesi in
Indonesia.
Washo A people of the
California-Nevada border.
Yakut The common Russian
name for the Sakha of
Siberia.

New Shamanic Movements
Is shamanship a universal
human potential? Could I
become a shaman? Increasing
numbers of people in modern
society are asking these
questions. The number of
organizations, magazines and
workshops concerned with
shamanism, or claiming to be,
is now very large. Not all of
these are of equal authenticity
or integrity, and since shamanic
practice can be spiritually and
psychologically highly
provoking readers are advised
to examine them very
searchingly before making any
substantial personal
commitment. Some
of the more significant
addresses are listed here, but
the inclusion or omission of
any organization from this list
does not necessarily imply any
endorsement or criticism.
Many forms of neo¬
shamanism use elements from
North American native
religions which I have
characterized in this book as
not strictly shamanic. In
addition, particularly in North
America, native organizations
have started to criticize some of
these systems for cultural
imperialism or intellectual
piracy. There are numerous
native organisations which
combine in various ways the
teaching of outsiders with
a lobby for their own cultural
regeneration. It is not possible
to list these here. While some
would not welcome wide
publicity, others advertize in
the main magazines.

AUTHOR'S ACKNOWLEDGMENT
I owe a great debt to the many shamans and their clients
who have helped me over the years, to the scholars whose
works have taught me and to the many institutions which
have enabled me to travel. Jonathan Horwitz. Laurel
Kendall, Mark Nuttall and Judith Pettigrew kindly com¬
mented on the manuscript but should not be blamed for
any faults which remain. I dedicate this book to my wife
Sally in gratitude for her support and understanding.
