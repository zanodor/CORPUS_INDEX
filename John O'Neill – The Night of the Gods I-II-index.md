PREFACE TO VOLUME II.
I
CANNOT let this book go forth without endeavouring to
express my deeply-felt and warmest thanks to all the friends
who have so kindly helped to bring out this second volume
which concludes my dear lost husband's work, The NiGHT OF
THE Gods, although, as will be seen by Mr. Hewitt's note at the
head of p. 790, and throughout the text, much of the second
volume is simply a collection of rough notes which have been
printed as they stood, but which would undoubtedly have been
worked out, applied, and summarized, had the Author lived to
complete his work. The system of index also, which he contemplated, and on which he had made considerable progress, was
most elaborate and exhaustive. This it has been found abso
lutely necessary to curtail very considerably. When all my dear
husband's friends have been so kind and helpful in the bringing
out of this .second volume of The Night OF THE GODS, it seems
almost invidious to make distinctions. But I must record my
sense of gratitude to Mr. Hewitt, not only for his great kindness
in going over the MSS., but also for the consoling words of help
and encouragement he gave when I was almost despairing. I
must thank sincerely and warmly Mr. Nutt for undertaking the
publication, and for the great personal interest he has shown in the
book. To the old friends who have known my dear husband
longer even than I have, it has been, I am sure, a labour of love to
do what they can to help, but I am none the less deeply indebted
to them, and thank them from my heart. To take the Committee
in the order in which their names stand, after assuring them all
of my profound and undying gratitude, I must mention especially
Dr. Budge for his kindness in revising the proofs, Mr. Morris Colles
for his invaluable help and advice, Prof Douglas for his assistance
in the revision of the proofs, and here again Mr. Hewitt must be
assured that his help in that labour has the best thanks I can give.



iv Pjxface to Volume II.
Dr. Warren originated the hope that in spite of many discourage
ments the book might be given to the pubhc in its complete form.
Mr. Hewitt gave me the first practical suggestion as to how the
book should be brought out. Mr. Rowe carried out that suggestion
promptly and efficiently, and prepared the way for the realization
of the desire I had scarcely dared to hope to see fulfilled. To my
dear husband's brother-in-law, Mr. Grattan Geary, I am indebted
for invaluable literary advice and assistance, and to him and to my
husband's old friend, Mr. Justice Pigot, for the generous donations
which made the task of publishing by subscription comparatively
easy.
With these iQ\<i poor words of thanks I will leave these pages to
speak for themselves. My husband's aim will be realized if they
prove an aid to students in their endeavour to illumine the " Night
of the Gods."

MEMOIR OF THE AUTHOR.
IT may be interesting to briefly indicate the various steps which
led an official in one of the great public departments, whose
active life was spent in the discharge of duties of a very different,
if not less arduous kind, to devote years of labour to the study
of the origin of cosmopolitan religious myths and symbols, and
embody the results in a work of so profound and varied a character.
Gifted with intellectual powers of no mean order, Mr. O'Neill
combined an exceptional capacity for grasping general principles
with a marvellous patience in mastering details. This faculty was
full}- recognised by his departmental superiors, and marked him
out for employment from time to time on special missions requiring
special aptitudes. Thus he was sent by the War Office to Paris in
1868 to investigate the working of the Intendance Militaire, and in
1878 his services were lent to the Foreign Office for employm.ent in
their newly acquired possession of Cyprus. He was appointed
Auditor and Accountant-General, and it fell to him to evolve order
out of the monetary chaos prevailing in that island, where coins of
eleven different currencies, having no recognised relation to each
other, were in circulation to the great profit of the money-changers,
who fixed a rate of exchange almost daily to the bewilderment and
impoverishment of the ordinary trader. Mr. O'Neill succeeded in
establishing a regular currency of three factors —the pound ster
ling, the Turkish beshalik, and the Egyptian piastre—which were
accepted thenceforward by the tax-gatherer, the merchant, and the
general public as the equivalent of the pounds, shillings, and pence
of Great Britain. While engaged in this and other administrative
work of considerable difficulty, he found time to observe and note
the many remains of the ancient religious beliefs of the island
which were continually cropping up.
For such observations in an island which was for centuries a
debateable land between East and West, between Egypt, Phoenicia,
a2

and Assyria on the one hand, and Greece and the Hellenic
civilisation on the other, in the remoter past, and Venice and
the Turks in after ages, the Author was in some measure prepared b>' the trend of inquiries which he had already pursued with
remarkable zest and indefatigable application.
In 1869 he became a contributor to the Pall JMall Gazette, then
under the able editorship of Mr. Frederick Greenwood. While so
engaged, in what might be called his leisure hours, he had sent to
him for review, M. Aime Humbert's /^r/^w Illustye,^ work which so
interested him that he at once resolved to study Japanese in order
to explore the field of inquiry thus opened to his view. His first
studies in that difficult language were made under the competent guidance of Professor Summers, by whom he was introduced to
Mr. W. G. Aston, the accomplished Japanese scholar, then attached
to the British Embassy in Japan. The friendship then begun
lasted for his life. Mr. Aston greatly facilitated Mr. O'Neill's
Japanese studies, and with this view obtained for him through the
Foreign Office introductions to several Japanese gentlemen of good
family who were then in London for the purpose of becoming acquainted with the mechanism of Western administration. In
return for instruction in Political Economy and the principles of
scientific taxation, these gentlemen imparted to him a singularly
thorough knowledge of the Japanese language, literature, history
and religious beliefs. It may be mentioned, that as a special token
of personal regard, one of the most distinguished of the.se Oriental
students presented Mr. O'Neill with the beautiful weapon with
which his father, a Daimio of high rank, had committed the Happy
Dispatch during the troubles which preceded the establishment of
the new order of things in the Empire of the Rising Sun.
Mr. O'Neill published A First Japanese Book, which has been of
great use to students. It is a translation of one of the Buddhist
discourses of Kiu-o {Kiu-6-Dow-a) with notes, and the original
rendered into Roman characters. This field of Oriental research
led naturally in after years to a study of Chinese and some slight
acquaintance with the thousands of ideagraphs which enable that
ingenious people to dispense with an alphabet. In this branch
of study Mr. O'Neill was greatly indebted to Professor Gustav



Ulcnioir of the Author. vii
Schlegel, of the Leyden University, for help and instruction.
That great authority on the learning of the Far East kindly
corrected the proofs of the first volume of the present work. The conception of embod\ing in TiiE NiGHT OF THE GODS
the result of years of patient labour in so many and various fields
of inquiry, occurred in this wise. After leaving Cyprus, Mr. O'Neill
resided in France for some years, writing for many of the Reviews,
English and French, on a variety of subjects. He gave special
attention to medieval French literature, and to the curious and long
since obsolete patois of the Free Companies of the France of the
Middle Ages. He embodied some of the fruit of these researches
in a disquisition in French on Li Roys des Ribands. It was while
engaged in these researches and on literary work, reviewing books
on religious symbols for one of the Quarterlies, that it occurred to
him that the common origin of the religious myths and symbols
is to be found in the impression made on the mind of every race
in c\-cry clime, by the phenomena of the revolution of the earth, and
its relation, real or apparent, to the sun, the moon and the stars.
The phenomena being universally observed by primitive man in the
same stage of development, and under very similar conditions, gave
rise to similar, if not to identical, interpretations. This general
principle, applied to the sym.bols and myths of races and climes so
diverse as those of the Aryan races of Europe and India, the yellow
races of Eastern Asia, the red races of America, the black races of
Africa and Australia, yields some striking and unexpected results.
It was from the midst of these promising labours, of which these
pages are the first-fruits, that Mr. John O'Neill was removed, almost
without warning, by death.

The Wheel.
THE whirling of the Heavens must obviously have been
observed before the wheel was invented. No one will deny that. But did this heavens-whirling suggest the wheel early, or did the wheel suggest itself much later as a symbol of the heavens-whirling ?
The Norse symbol for the revolving of the Universe is a mill.
And this is, of course, because the mill-stone turns. The very same question that has been stated for the wheel here arises as to the mill-stone also.
And I think it may be conceded that the application of wheels to carts was a later idea than the invention of the wheel itself. Indeed, the cart-wheel might have been a wholly independent VOL. II. B



584 The Night of the Gods. [The
invention, the origin of which would have been the accidental
discovery of the roller. The theory I have felt induced to support here is that an
adoration-wheel was suggested by the heavens-motion ; and that the fire-wheel, the quern, and the churn, were possibly deductions
from the adoration-wheel, or accidental discoveries in its use ; the
fire-wheel coming first in point of time. The use of the potter's-wheel by the Egyptian fashioning-god Khnemu, for shaping men and women, would seem to suggest the classing of that wheel also with the conceptions to which the
heavens-motion, the Universe-motion, gave birth. Of all the
wheels —worship, fire, quern, churn, and potter's— the potter's is
the one farthest removed, in the initial conception of its idea and
its function, from the cart-wheel or developed roller. The humble place of the grindstone in this catalogue must not
be forgotten. Nor will the place be too humble if we ask the question : Why should not heavenly bodies at length fly to pieces, even to " cosmic dust," as overworked grindstones do ? The late Lazarus Geiger in 1870 made some profound observations upon the Buddhistic and other symbolisms of the Wheel. He cites from the Vedic hymns a passage pregnant with meaning for my present purpose : " Powerfully separating two Wheels with the Axle, as it were, Indra fasteneth Heaven and Earth." Then he suggests that when, full of expectation, the wise men of that
period, at the dawn of the morning, directing their glances towards the East where the shining god was to appear to them, prefigured by twirling two pieces of wood (that most primitive type of the great progenitors of the two worlds revolving like a wheel) the revolution of the heavens which was preparing the advent of the
beneficent appearance of the new-born day,—when, in their naive faith, they imagined they might assist or even further that revolution by this incessantly repeated holy work ; and when, in the centre of the small type of the world which they were turning between their hands, the spark suddenly flashed up, as did up yonder in the great celestial world the wonderful majestic flame of the morning sun, what joy and awe must have thrilled their hearts, on seeing that the great god of heaven, Agni himself, had des
cended into their sanctuaries. . . . If by circumambulation, by circular processions or races, by turning objects of various kinds the movement of the heavens is imitated, these are outbursts of a

once powerful instinct, of an imitative impulse which must once have swayed mankind with irresistible might at a certain stage of
their existence.^
Geiger here obviously leans to the sun, but I go farther than he did, and say that the turning of a wheel must have been resorted to as an imitation of the revolution of the heavens, as a representation of the supreme motions of the Highest. It would have been an act of homage, of reverence, of abnegation, of impetration. The practice would have tended to become ritualistic, to conciliate the regards of the deity, and would subsequently have been meritorious in his worshippers. One of Numa's famous precepts, of which Plutarch gave the priority to the Pythagoreans, was " Turn round to pay adoration to the gods; sit after you have worshipped." And hereon Plutarch observed that as to the turning which worshippers were to use in divine adoration, it was said in his time to represent the rotatory motion of the Universe.^ For us, this must nakedly mean that
God (numen) prescribed the reverent imitation of his own works,
that is labours. The Universe-wheel appears in Irish myth as the Roth Fail, Wheel of Fal, otherwise the Roth Ramach, where " paddles " is not, I venture to assert, the proper rendering of ramach. The French rame, which meant a braitch before it became an oar, is a straight illustration of my objection ; and ramus and radix are of the same family, which brings us near to the radius of a circle, and the spoke of a wheel. This wheel was made by Simon Drui,^ assisted by Mog Ruith, a celebrated Irish Druid from the island of Valencia,"* The wheel enabled Simon Drui to fly in the air
clearly a legend of a winged heavens-wheel god —but it broke—an
Icarus incident—and parts of it were (see p, 2'J2)) brought to
Ireland by Mog Ruith's daughter. A St. Columba legend turns
the wheel into a vast ship (an Argo Navis in fact) filled with a fabulous number of warriors, sailing over land and sea with equal ease (a kind of devinaille), but eventually to be wrecked on the

pillar-stone of the wheel at Cleghile (see p. 273), that is on the
Universe-Axis—an obvious End-of-the-world myth.^ Mog Ruith means slave of the wheel, which is just like the
slave of the Ring in the Thousand and One. The Welsh Gvvydion's consort was the ocean-nymph Brightwheel, Arianrhod^ Woden (as Gylfe) had a leman called Gefjon also an ocean-nymph, and she had a " diup rodhul," a deep or lofty wheel.^ Prof Rhys connects these wheels with the Gygean Ring of Lunet (Elunet, Lynette). According to the traditions in the Isle of Man and in the Eastern Counties of Leinster, the First-man
of the Island " rolled on three legs like a wheel through the mist."* On the I ith of June, at Riom in Auvergne, a wheel of flowers
(formerly of wax), several feet wide, is still (1883) carried in procession by the clergy, and " from time to time piously turned
on its axle for the edification of the faithful." It is eventually
deposited on two great ancient stones, formerly considered holy
and preserved to this day.''^ When Easter falls as late as it can, that is on 25th April,
the French God-feast (fete-Dieu), our Corpus Christi (body of Christ), and the German Frohnleichnamsfest or Frohn-corpse
festival, falls on St. John's day (24th of June). The name of this Corpse-feast has nothing Christian in it either in French or German, and our own name, like the Italian (corpus domini) and the Spanish, is merely the church-Latin one. It was probably a "pagan" midsummer feast; and the very ancient compromise between moon and sun worship which still guides the annual
fixation of the " Christian movable feasts " is, of course, answerable
for the present fluctuation of its date. M. Henri Gaidoz, in his Dieu Gaulois die soldi (1886), has
' Rhys's Hil). Lects. 210, 214 to 216. See also Melushie, ii, 134, 159 ; Gaidoz, Etudes, 99, 100. - Is not the true signification of the Aryans, the bright, shining ones, the star-gods of the heavens? Manu's Aryavarta or " path of the Arya," then becomes radically the " turn of the heavens " (root wart or war, to turn ; Sanskrit, vartis, a house) ; and that great Sanskrit astrological work the Arya Siddhdnta, and the (probably fabulous) name of its author Arya-Bhata (root bha, to shine or speak), take their natural and proper places. Arya thus would come, like Arjuna, from root arg, to shine. The dark Dasyus whom Indra cast into unfettered captivity (Wilson's Rig Veda, ii, 241) would thus be the fallen ones, from root divas, to fall, to perish. The English verb to dash means to ruin.

advanced numerous proofs of the connection of the wheel-symbolism with St. John's day, that is with the summer-solstice heavens
worship sacred festival. But M. Gaidoz refers almost all his instances of the wheel to the sun. The view here upheld throughout is, on the other hand, that the wheel-symbolism is to be referred in its supreme significance to the grand aggregate of the
(apparently) revolving heaven itself, and not to any one member of it, not even to the (to us) great Sun. To refer the wheelconception ab origine to the sun seems to me to be taking a part
for the whole, a single function for the entire visible macrocosm ; and to be also a magnification of Sun-worship at the expense of Heavens-worship ; a too rapid and too broad generalisation of the taking and facile theory of Sun-worship. We have, in fact, allowed the Sun-worship theories, even when insufficient, as they often are, to dazzle our eyesight ; we have committed the sin which was deadly and inexpiable to the Incas, we have gazed at the sun until it has blinded us to the more all-embracing theory. As has been said before some of M. Gaidoz's facts have here been diverted to the heavens-worship theory, and there is one class of these which M. Gaidoz, with his usual clear candour, declines to explain from Sun-worship. I shall here add another
very curious fact, one of the most significant survivals that has
turned up in the course of the present enquiry. M. Jules
Lemaitre, the spirited writer of the " Billets du Matin " in Le Temps, has described a custom of the plains of the Loire. On the Fete-Dieu one year he saw the men of Tavers near Beaugency, although they were far (the old pagans) from being devout, lay a
large cart-wheel flat on a pivot, and on this wheel they fixed the altar or reposoir from which the priest was to give the benediction. When he uplifted the ostensory or remonstrance containing the corpus domini, with which to make the blessing cross-sign over the
people, the altar was made to revolve, and so the blessing of the rite was sent nrbi et orbi round the compass. This very telling superstitio seems so important that M. Lemaitre's own words are
subjoined,^ showing that there was also a St. John at the reposoir,
' "Tout de suite j'ai pense aux Fetes-Dieu d'autrefois. Vous rappelez-vous les reposoirs qu'on faisait chez nous, et comme c'etait amusant ? Une annee, les hommes du bourg, qui n'etaient pourtant guere devots, voulurent se signaler. lis s'aviserent de placer horizontalement, sur un pivot, une enorme roue de charrette, sur laquelle on construisit I'autel.

as the temporary altar or altars put up for resting the Corpus Christi during the Fete-Dieu processions are called in French. This would indicate that the feast, in the particular year referred
to, fell at or near the summer solstice, as it sometimes does, and as
it perhaps always did until it was disturbed by Moon-worship, or by a vague lunar calendar. M. Jules Lemaitre has been good enough to inform me that he does not think this wheel-altar was
traditional on the spot. The Japanese Buddhist priest Kiu-6 of the Shingaku sect, in one of his familiar sermons, speaks slily of a number of fish
arranged in the centre of a dish, as being '' seated wheel fashion,^
and lost in the meditation " peculiar to a rival Buddhist sect, the Zen Shiu, or Contemplation School. According to this Zen Shiu,
the significant act of the close of Buddha's life was his slowly
twirling a lotus-flower with finger and thumb, in perfect silence.^ No one understood his meaning but Kashyapa, who spoke not, but merely smiled, and was at once appointed by Buddha to be his successor. It is obvious that the twiddling of the wheel-flower and the meditation in a " wheel-seat " are references to the
revolution of the heavens.

W/ieeL'\ The '
' Praying "- Wheel. 589
The " Praying "-Wheel.
THE transition from a revolving adoration-wheel to a praying
wheel is easy, and the mere turning of a wheel would have preceded the added prayers ; and thus the ultima ratio of what we call the " praying-wheel " of Buddhism seems to be the worship
of the revolving heavens. As a matter of fact, however, our term
Praying-^]\Q€i is a misnomer; for, as Mr. Alabaster points out,^ prayer is not a Buddhist practice, the Buddhist having no divine
entity to pray to. What are called prayers are not prayers at all,
but sentences, dharanis, mantras, verses, formulae for repetition, to assist meditation on the vanity and misery of existence or the
excellence of Buddha, and so forth. So that in fact, so far as my arguments here go, the Buddhist machine is still strictly an adoration or meditation-wheel, and not a praying-wheel ; although that term is convenient, having been long given it by
us Westerns, subjectively. The mani or hand-cylinders of the Thibetan Buddhists are twirled clock-hands fashion on their handles by the help of an
external small chain and weight which gives the momentum. The holy formula Om Mani padme hum is embossed outside, and is also written innumerable times on

the size of a policeman's rattle up to huge vats 15 feet high and 10 feet through, with a heavy iron crank, to benefit a whole district. In some Lamaseries in Ladakh they are worked by clockwork and heavy weights, wound up at sunrise and sunset.
Upright cylinders— all these machines, it must not be forgotten,
are upright, with the axis pointing heavenwards—are fixed in sheds over running streams which work them by means of skewcog turbine-wheels. They are also worked by wind-power.^ Priests go along the roads near Rarung, in the English Himalayas, twirling their little hand-mills^ just as Turks and Christians finger
their circular strings of beads, or rosaries, which must have a like
origin.
Huc,^ who also gives an account of the prayer-barrels in the Tartar Lamaseries and in the running brooks, dammed for the purpose at Kunfum, mentions similar machines which are suspended over the fire in the Tartar tents, and turned like smokejacks by the draught which rushes up through the central smoke
hole.
Prof. Rhys Davids^ speaks of " the well-known praying-wheels : those curious machines, which, filled with prayers or charms or passages from holy books, stand in the towns in every open place,
are placed beside the foot-paths and the roads, revolve in every
stream, and even, by the help of sails like those of wind-mills, are turned by every breeze which blows o'er the thrice-sacred valleys
of Tibet." [And then he refers to Hue and Gabet's Voj/ages, i, 324 ;

for it is not possible to separate the consideration of the turning of the praise-wheel from the ritualistic practice of walking round and round shrines and sacred trees.]

GEIGER pointed out, too, how the holy butter, indispensable
at the morning sacrifice, was obtained " by a quite analogous
process " of rotation ; and that the corn-mill was, in its simplest shape, two round flat stones and a twirling-rod. ["Let the
creaking stones, for whose rotation the priests hasten, supply the altar," Rig V. iii, 283. The same hymn, seven verses previously, says, "the exulting stones delight"; and the commentators add that they delight to bruise the Soma. The mill here referred to appears therefore to be one for crushing the juice out of the soma
stalks.] And then comes in Geiger's act of insight. He seems to
have boldly theorised that the artificial production of fire was accidental in the apparatus of the adoration-wheel ; being " decidedly of opinion that that religious toying consisted essentially only in the rotatory motion, without regard to what might come of it." This would account for the sacredness and the primitive worship of fire which we know to have been universal. He further pointed out how Agni (fire) is called in the Vedic hymns, now the child of Heaven and Earth, and now the child of two pieces of wood ; and also how in Brandenburg the needfire was obtained by drilling in the nave of a wheel, and in England, Scotland, Sweden, and Germany, by turning (by means of a rope wound round it) a
wooden windlass bored into a stake. In some villages of the Masurian Poles who inhabit Prussia, it
is the custom on St. John's Eve, after putting out all the fires, to plant in the ground an oaken post and mount on its point a wheel, which the young folk turn with rapidity until the post takes fire by the friction.! ^ ^^^\^ of ^ood with a hole in the middle, like the Indian arani, was employed in Germanic countries, according to Mannhardt^ to obtain the nothfeuer— our needfire—as a remedy in cattle epidemics. Friedreich mentions^ an old cart-wheel instead of a disk ; which disk I take to be merely a primitive
solid wheel. As to the Northern central Cosmic fire, it is clear that, of the four sacrificial Vedic fires—to the North, South, East, and

Hoai-Nan-tsze relates the tradition that the fabulous Sui-Jin,
a sort of Chinese Prometheus, contemplating [the revolution of?]
the stars and the constellations, rubbed wood, and produced fire.^
In the Odyssey (ix, 384, 388), a propos of the blinding of the Cyclops, the perforation of a beam of timber by the carpenter's drill is described as effected by two gangs of workmen who pull
the rope of the tool alternately in opposite directions. To separate the amrita (ambrosia) from the other elements in
the Ocean —always viewed in the Indian myths as another Chaos, potential of all treasures—the gods and their rival genii the Asuras, who seem on a par with them at the start of the legend, resolve to churn it. They pluck up Mount Mandara by the roots, and transport it into the midst of the waters. It is thus enlaced by the coils of the great serpent Sesha or Vasuki, whose head is seized by the Asuras, while the gods grasp the tail ; and by their alternate and contrary pulls the holy mountain, which is the axis of the world, is twirled like a block of wood under the hand of the turner, and so the churning is accomplished ; the mountain catching fire in the
course of the process.^ The great mill of Norse mythology, which revolves as the
starry heavens, was also the mighty friction machine from which
the sacred fire proceeded. In a Norse legend King Frodi has a hand-quern called Grotti, which grinds peace (harmony.?) and gold. Two maidens of the old giant race, Fenja and Menja, grind it continually, one singing
while the other rests. They rebel, and grind (? the reverse way) fire and war instead.* An Iceland quern grinds, in the name of
the Lord, everything it is ordered.^ The word mondull, for the handle of the mill, is the ancient
Teutonic manthula, a swing-tree (Fick, iii, 232), Skt. root, manth, to bore, twist, swing.*' This also gives us some clue to the etymology of the mountain Mandara and the fire-stick pramantha. As to
mill-symbols in heraldry, see p. f. Aufrecht has given the etymology of Mentula as a diminutive

of the Sanskrit pra-mantha, the agitator, the stick which is turned in the hollow piece of wood to obtain fire. This stick is constantlycompared in the Vedas to a phallus, and Aufrecht brought it from the root inanth, to shake.^ The theory which identifies pramantha with Prometheus would have also to account for ''K-mfii^devq, who, according to Hesiod, was brother to Tlpo/jUT]d6u<i. The following passages, which are added from Wilson's Rt'g Veda, remove all doubt as to the holiest mode of producing Agni, or fire: "Agni, the two-fold generated" (ii, 6^), 85). "Both his associated mothers, blackened, are in movement, and give birth to
an infant " (ii, 64). " Strong priests extract this Agni from his
primitive seat by force" [that is, by violent friction] (ii, 68). " Agni, offspring of two mothers, devimata " ; " offspring of two parents "
; " son of strength," said to refer to the force required for the friction by which, " Agni, thou wast born from the dry wood "
(i, 79, 160, 68, 182). " Whom the two sticks have engendered like a new-born babe";^ "thou art manifested in the timber, Agni, by the act of attrition." Agni " on every occasion descends pure of origin from heaven, and present (in the wood) as the embryo, imme
diately consumes the offering." " The priests churn thee, Agni,"
" Agni, the brilliant purifier, who is dormant " (in fuel). {Rig
V. iii, 7),
" the churned, imperishable Agni." " The two sons of Bharata,^ Devasravas and Devavata, have churned the very powerful and wealth-bestowing Agni."
"the ten fingers have generated this Ancient" (Agni). (iii,

The classical Sanskritic name for India is Bharata ; the Mahd Bhdrata is its great epic, and Bharata is said to have been "a king who appears to have ruled over a large territory in ancient times." Clearly he must have been a divine chakravartin. It is eminently worthy of note, too, that the root brahm means to whirl. Recollect, too, that Bharata is the eldest of the hundred sons of Rishabha, who is again son of Nabhi (the Omphalos) and Mem (the Universe-mountain).

lower of the sticks with the face upward, the upper downward, so that quickly impregnated it may generate the showerer Agni
then the bright blazing son of Ila . . . is born of the wood of
attrition." (iii, 34.) "Matariswan brought for the gods from afar Agni, hiding of
himself and generated by attrition, as a fugitive." " When Agni
has displayed in the material firmament he is called Matariswan," which name Wilson explained as " who breathes (swasiti) in the maternal atmosphere (matari) " ;^ but this is unsatisfying. The Hindu pictures of Agni represent him dual with two
faces —it may be to express his two-fold birth ; he also has three
legs, which may refer to the three fires on the altar, which again
may refer to the supernal triad. The fires may also be the hearth, the sacrifice, and the cremation fires. The number seven, too, dominates, as we should have expected from his central Northern
origin, in all his attributes. He rides on a red-horned blue ram
where the blue may be celestial, and the red that of fire.^ Blue is the colour of the ram of the Egyptian Ammon, also of Vishnu. Krishna, whose name is black, is painted dark blue ; and Sri
Rama, whose skin is green, is called blue.^ I shall add several other strange passages from the Rig Veda : "By thee Agni, Varuha observant of his duties" [of revolving] "and Mitra and Aryaman, bountiful divinities, are animated; so that thou hast been born comprehending them all universally in all their functions, and encompassing them all as the rim does
the spokes of a wheel." (ii, 70.)* " Whatever offerings the priest
presents, whatever prayers he recites, Agni knows them all ; he
comprehends all priestly acts, like the rim of a wheel " {ibid.
222), "Agni, thou encompassest the gods as the rim the spokes."
(iii, 260).
This all-encompassing Agni must, it is presumed, be Star
Fire. We may also look on another probable invention of fire
production — that is, from flints—as an accident of the manufacture
' Rig. Veda, iii, 6, 36. - Creuzer and Guigniaut, i, 247. ^ Creuzer and Guigniaut, ii, 201, 210, 248. * Compare this with the passage from Cicero on p, 36.

of stone weapons and utensils, as suggested by De Mortillet and others. This discovery would thus be later than the wood age, when the drill-fire was stumbled upon, and may perhaps be regarded as a scientific as opposed to the earlier sacred event. Though the drill (and the mirror) have all over the world been,
and still are, employed in religious ritual for the production of fire,
it does not appear, I believe, that the profaner flint was adopted by the ancient priesthoods. Here is a further support to the views here taken : the drill would have had its origin in Polar-star worship, the mirror in Sun-worship ; while the flint would have
remained irreligious. But I may not pass unmentioned here a very divergent theory which, so far as I know, belongs, as a modern argument, to Prof Sven Nilsson, who, in his Stone Age^ says that men learnt how to light a fire from observation of the self-ignition of the branches of
trees by friction one against the other under stress of the wind.
The supposition appears the more ingenious if we refer it— Prof.
Nilsson does not—to a time when man was still a climbing animal, and when this particular production of fire might perhaps have come under his immediate notice in his own tree-huts, where the timbers of his perched-up nest would be more subject to rubbing against the branches, and would also be more directly under his eye. But it does not seem probable that a rapidity and force of
friction sufficient actually to produce fire could thus often be developed, and the instances observed must, if any, have been of extreme rarity. This theory sounds much more like a late deduction, to account for forest-fires, from the well established practice
itself of obtaining fire by wood-friction. Perhaps the earliest mention of this idea is to be found in the fragments of Sanconiathon preserved for us at second hand by Eusebius— " the trees which grew at Tyre, rubbed together by violent winds, ignited." ^
Before quitting the subject of Fire, I should like to put on record the speculation that we may perhaps dimly discern the invention of explosives (which came at a very late period to be used as destructives in human warfare) as being evolved with
slowest graduation out of the earliest fireworks used in the archaic,
and still in the modern, Chinese rites, especially those of tlie
spring-tide New-year. These barbarous fireworks would have

been primitively preceded and led up to by burning pieces of dry bamboo, which, as ancient Chinese records prove, by their
loud crackling frighted away evil spirits. It is by no means
necessary to confine the religious or ritualistic origin of explosives
within Chinese limits, witness the indiscriminate discharge of fire
arms among Eastern Christians at Easter, and by the Moslems at
the Beiram. Abel Remusat maintained that gunpowder had been known to the Hindus from remotest antiquity, and also to the Chinese, who had in the Tenth Century "thunder-carriages" which seemed to him to have been cannon ; and he found it difficult in any other way to account for the fire-stone throwers, so often mentioned in the history of the Mongols. But these may have been catapults for hurling hot stone-shot. When Hulagu in 1253 set out for Persia, added Remusat, he had in his army a body of Chinese artillerymen. But then the term "artillery" was used by ourselves for
weapons and machines of war before our use of powder in guns. The Abbe Hue's statement^ that " in China, Tartary, and Thibet, everybody can (1845) make gunpowder" is, however, of consider
able importance. From this point of view, the Catherine-wheel would represent
the fire-wheel of the Universe, and would have been a symbol in the worship of Agni. The French name for this firework nowadays is " soleil " ; and soleil, Sirius, and Surya are all said to come from
the same root. There is good reason, too, for asserting that Surya
was not originally the Sun-god (see pp. 597, 598).

Wheel.'] The Heavens-Wheel. 597
The Heavens-Wheel.
THE conception of the encompassing Wheel-god is by no
means confined to the Fire-god, Agni. We also find it applied to the Wind-gods, the Maruts ; and to Mitra, Varuna, Surya, Krishna. " Adorable Maruts . . . like the spokes of a wheel, none "
[of you] " are inferior " [to the rest], " but equal as days." (iii, 340). " Exceeding is your greatness, Mitra and Varuna, whereby the ever-moving Surya has through the days milked forth the stationary waters ; you augment all the rays of the self-revolving the One Wheel of you two goes round (vam ekah pavir a vavartha)." Rig V. iii, 347, Sayana, and Wilson, urmecessarily remark that pavi, the circumference of a wheel, is here put by metonymy for a chariot. My view is that wheel is not alone expressed but clearly meant. Indeed the commentator, and Wilson, in another passage (279) freely add the words in brackets that follow : " heaven and earth [have been caused] by the Maruts [to revolve like a wheel]." This cannot be correct either, for the earth was fixed, for the Vedas. (Note here the idea of the winds helping round the wheel ?) " The two adorable Krishnas (ubhe Krishne, which the scholiast affirms means 'day and night') upholding by the might of Sur}-a (Suryasya Mahana) successively revolve." Rig- V. iii, 46, where the commentator, no doubt correctly, identifies Surya with Indra the impeller (preraka) of the universe. Another test serves as a
good gloss to this : " the dark day and the light day revolve alternate " (p. 395), and would almost lead one to consider the " two blacks " or darks, the two Krishnas as two successive nights, remembering that the night is the first half of each day. " The Seven yoke the chariot to the only wheel ; an only courser with a sevenfold name moves the triple-naved everlasting Wheel, that nothing can arrest, on which repose all beings." This
translation is given by Senart^ ; the following is Wilson's : " They yoke the Seven to the one-wheeled chariot ; one horse, sevennamed, bears it along ; the three-axled wheel in undecaying, never loosened, and in it all these regions of the universe abide. The

Seven preside over this seven-wheeled chariot ; the seven horses draw it ; seven sisters ride in it together ; and in it are deposited the seven forms."^ The " forms " are explained by the commen
tators as the seven divine rivers or the seven notes of music, but
the gloss seems superfluous, or at all events to give us the develop
ments in place of the origin. In this last passage, we have three distinct poetico-theological
figures for the Seven Rishis, the seven stars of Charles's Wain, the Waggon and Horses, the Chinese Ti Cheh or Ruler's chariot (§§ 17, 20). The triple nave is clearly an allusion to the central, supernal triad (§§ 5, 35) ; and the whole passage seems to be a rhapsody on the primum mobile, the volubilis et rotundus Deus,
the revolution of the universe about the Pole. Once the Universewheel idea is mastered, it is difficult to conceive how anyone could ever have applied that last passage of the Rig Veda to the Sun. The Hindu celestial chart or *' zodiac " (here a misleading term for us) is called the Rasi Chakra, see Moor's Hindi'L Pmttheoii,
plates 2 and 88. There is in Gustav Schlegel's UranograpJnc Chinoise a passage which he quotes from the T'ien Kivan Shu, and which describes this great constellation of Ursa Major as pivoting round the Pole
like a chariot in its course.
[When a Draco'nis was the pole-star, the star | of Ursa Major was but 12° distant from it ; but the most northern star of Ursa Major, a, is now about 28° away from the present pole.] Here we must " quote Shakespeare " too, while wondering where, on earth, he got the idea from :
" It [majesty] is a massy Wheel Fixed on the summit of the highest Mount, To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things Are mortis'd and adjoin'd." {Hainlct ill, 3, 17.)
I have come across a curious employment of this metaphor of the wheel in the Religio Medici (7th ed. 1678, p. 11). " In divinity
I love to keep the rood, and tho' not in an implicit yet an humble faith follow the great Wheel of the Church ; by which 1 move, not reserving any proper Poles or motion from the epicycle of my own brain." The word " wheel " appears as " primum mobile " in the
Latin {Argentorati, 1652, p. 37.) It is worth noting that the state-coach or chair of a Korean

official has but one wheel, and has consequently a number of
supporters as well as of pushers.^ § 14. As regards the Polar and Solar theories, it may here be remarked that the winter decline of the Sun suggested at an early time an adverse, overpowering, and superior force. This
decline becomes absolute defeat, flight, and disappearance in high Northern latitudes. And even the daily setting of the Sun in more oblique positions leaves conspicuous the central pivoting functions of the Polar Star, which the Turkomans still call temir-kazik, the iron pivot, which is the " nail," the motionless centre of \\\q. priinuni mobile, of the supreme sphere of the old astronomers ; the " point
quiescent " of Bacon and Aristotle. " The sailors and shepherds of the Teutons knew very well that the revolving of the star-lit sky
was round a fixed point, the polar star, and it is probable that
veraldar nagli, the world-nail, the world-spike, an expression preserved in the Eddubrott ii, designates the north star."- With this we must connect, too. the sword nagelring, and the god
Nagelfar. In order to make this clearer, the facts must be dwelt
upon that the stars never set at and near the Pole, but seem to go ever round and from left to right Such would have been man's earliest experience had human life begun at the Pole. The epitaph of Anaxagoras declared that he had unveiled the mysteries
of things and discovered the secrets of the Pole, and to him. is
given, by Diogenes Laertius, the assertion that in the beginning the
stars revolved in a tholiform manner, that is like the doKo'^ or dome
of an observatory ; he also said it was a motion not utto, under,
but Trep), around, the earth ; while at first the pole star always appeared in the zenith, but afterwards acquired a certain declination. Anaximenes, although the passage is disputed, used the illustration
of a hat rotating on a man's head. In the late Mr. R. A. Proctor's New Theory of Achilles' Shield, I believe he argued that when the
constellations were arranged, the celestial equator must have been
on, or taken as on, the horizon."*

§ 15. The Wheel-God. — A well-known Assyrian personage, sometimes depicted upright against a wheel, and sometimes with the trunk of his body as it were engaged in or issuing from a wheel,^ seems to be Dayan-Same, the Judge of Heaven, the Polar deity, Assur, who is without ^^"^ companion, a real monarch of v^^^ the Empyrean. He holds a bow with which he impels a
triple-pointed dart, which dart has been accepted as a symbol of
the thunderbolt. The rock inscriptions of Behistun and Per
sepolis are said to show Ahura Mazda thus represented. But the presentation will, perhaps, prove to have also belonged to the
earlier self-subsisting Zervan Akarana, the first principle of all
things ; which produced the dual co-principles Ahura and Ahriman,'"^ and with whom, as Boundless Time, the Greek Kronos must be bracketed. This was long ago indicated by Eudemos {apud Damascius^ ed. Kopp, p. 384) ; and Zervan Akarana was already, according to Berosus, a mere legendary personage in the third
century before our era. Such too seems to me to be the primary signification of the Pahlavi sorvan (which Mr. West renders "unlimited time") as contrasted with daman in the Dindi Mainogi ctiiradJi. " Unlimited Time {porvdii) is undecaying, immortal, and undisturbed ; painless,
hungerless, and thirstless."^ " The affairs of the world of every kind proceed through destiny and time and the supreme decree of the self-existent eternity {sorvdii), the King and long-continuing
Lord."" After these, the similar passage in the Shikand Gihiuhiik
Vijdr (vi, i) is not quite comprehensible as it stands in its context
(p. 146). In the Assyrian cylinders this Wheel-god is, so far as I can
test it, always placed in the upper portion — the sky— of the com

remains inexplicable ; but the hypothesis that the Wheel-god is
the Polar deity makes plain even the cryptic passage in St. Augustine,^ where he says of Varro's Sabine god Summanus that night thunder was attributed to him, while the thunder of the daytime was Jove's. As the Roman sceptic put it, Coelo tonantem
credidimus Tovem ; while the believers said, as Varro has it^ : . ^
Tunc repente coelitum altum tonitribus templum tonescit. Festus,
as if to settle the matter, informs us (pp. 348, 349) that the cakes offered in sacrifices to Summanus were called Summanalia, and were made in the shape of a Wheel. Guigniaut thinks Summanus was of Etruscan origin. He is often mentioned by the ancient Latin writers (Cicero, Ovid, Pliny), and St. Augustine* assures us that the early Romans rendered him greater honours than Jupiter himself The Arvalian brothers sacrije^a ficed a black ram to the Etruscan Summanus, whose temple was in * the Circus Maximus. His statue of clay (? baked) was before the
j^ Capitoline temple. The Romans had forgotten — if they ever knew
L — all about him (A. Maury).' Creuzer speaks thus on the subject : \- Some saw in him the Polar Star, which was of such great ^. importance to the Augurs. In the Canticles of the Arvalian
i brothers (v. p. t) he is called the Fathe r, and this title has justly recalled the Dis Pate r of Cicero , the subterranean power. It might be then that, like the most ancient Zeus of the Greeks, Summanus was on one hand the Master of the Celestial Pole, and on the other hand the sovereign of the abyss, (ii, 494.) This unlooked for confirmation of my views is not carried far enough ; expression is not given to the theory of the fallen god,

The god who is here called the Sun-god is Samas, the son of father Ea and Mother Damkina. " His worship was very old ," iJ^t Surv writes Mr. Budge, " and goes back to a time when the great powers of Nature were worshipped." Samas of Sippara was a well-known deity B.C. 3800, in the time of King Sargon, was probably the then supreme deity, for Sargon mentions no other god. " One of his truest and best votaries was Nebobaladan, King of Babylon about
B.C. 900. By his order was this fine tablet made." Doubtless at that date Sarnas may have been worshipped as the Sun-god ; but I draw attention to the following leading points. 1. The long-bearded god seated upon the throne of heaven seems to be the supreme heavens-god of Time. The Q which he holds is dealt with at p. t The figures under his throne are
marvellously identical with the figures of the pataikoi of the Phoenicians. This is a direct and important connection with the
Phoenician and Eg}'ptian gods !l and Ptah. The canopy over his head is the vault of the heavens, and the pillar is the Pillar so often
treated of here, throughout. In that case the seated old god would be Ea (?) and not Samas ; or if Samas, then Samas as having succeeded to his father Ea. But in any case, and decidedly, not the Sun. 2. The square altar and the round image upon it are in exact agreement with the Chinese round temple of the heavens and
square temple of Earth. 3. The round image is now said glibly by everyone to be " the
disk of the Sun "
; but that does not seem unquestionable. Suppose it, for example, to be the circumference of the heavens. We have in the centre the nave or omphalos ; then we have the four cardinal divisions and points indicated with precision ; and finally
we have the four rivers of heaven. What can these have to do on
the " disk " of the Sun ? 4. The unmistakeable ropes by which the circular object is
hung from the top of the heavens-pillar, may be symbols of the
suspension of the Sun, but they also with strange appropriateness
illustrate the chain of Zeus and the fine passage in Job (xxvi, 7) " He has spread out the North over the Void, and hung the Earth
upon nothing." 5. I suggest then that the original significance of this round idol was the Wheel of the Universe ; at the same time admitting

(in accord with the theory running through this Inquiry') that it may have later become the Sun-symbol. [The supreme sanctity even of the altar is seen in the fact that none dare touch it but the priest, who passes on it (one is tempted

I would also refer the reader (not for the first time) to Miss C. F. Gordon-Cumming's exceedingly able articles on "Pagodas, Auricles, and Umbrellas" in the EnglisJi Illustrated Magazine for June and July, 1888. There will be seen (p. 607) immediately under the throne of Buddha, the Wheel revolvable on its axle, flanked by the two supernatural Dogs, surmounted by the three
heavens (as stick-less umbrellas), as sculptured in the caves of
Ellora ; and also (p. 608) the sacred wheel, overshadowed by the umbrella, and adored by men and women, as well as by winged and hat-feathered deities.
St. Augustin says^ the pontiffs sacrificed to R usor. which must
be for Rursor, a personification of the re-turn, of the eternal
re-volution and renewal of the Universe ; quod rursus cuncta
eodem revolvuntur, said Varro,' and it is as well not to forget that the word Universe itself means " the One that turns " or " the turning of the One."
I here insert a curious little Ainu legend from Mr. B. H.
Chamberlain's translation,- which may disclose to us the Mountain-Palace, the heavens-deities and their head the wheel- (and
fire) god.
"Suddenly there was a Large House on the top of a hill [Mountain-palace of heaven?] wherein were Six persons beautifully arrayed, but constantly quarrelling [the 'war in heaven' of all mythologiesj. Thereupon Okikurumi [which is as near as
may be to the Japanese for Big- Wheel] came and said: 'Oh! you bad hares! you wicked hares! Who should know your
origin? The children in the sky [?sons of the gods] were pelting each other with snowballs; and the snowballs fell into this world of men. As it would have been a pity to waste heaven's snow, the snowballs were turned into hares; and those
hares are you. You who live in this world of mine, this world of

human beings, must be quiet. What is it that you are brawHng about?' With these words Okikurumi seized a fire-brand [which makes a fire-god as well as a wheel-god of him ?] and beat each of the Six with it in turn. Thereupon all the hares ran away." This is the origin of the Hare-god ; and for this reason the body of the hare is white, because made of snow ; while its ears, which are
the part where it was charred by the fire-brand, are black.

" Turn, turn thy Wheel above the staring crowd, Thy Wheel and Thou are shadows in the cloud." {Enid.)
LET us now endeavour to interpret the wheels spoken of
by Greek authors as having been suspended in Egyptian temples ; in taking which for symbols of the mutability of human affairs, Plutarch was perchance well advised. More closely, these wheels would have shown forth the incessant unrolling of events in Time, the continual and continuous revolution and evolution of the Universe ; the restless course That Time doth run with calm and silent foot. (Marlowe's Faustus, iv, 2, 2.)
§ 16. If it be that the turning of a mimic Universe-Wheel became an act of adoration of the heavenly sublimity (as I have endeavoured to show) one easily expounds the occult circle or turbo which Horace {Epodes, xvii, 7) implores the sorceress Canidia to twirl the reverse way in order to undo her spells ; it may also be the p6/ui^u<; spun round as a love-charm in the second Idyll of Theocritus. Fortunae pila, the play-ball of Fortune, is a term used by Aurelius Victor {Epit. 18). And another gloss might be put upon the reversal of the magic toy, which m^ust have been a forerunner of our teetotum, by con
sidering that reversal as an invocation of the nether, the infernal
powers ; for the wheel is also found associated with the god Hades

or Pluto ; and it must not be forgotten that the southern celestial hemisphere seems to southern mundane man to revolve in the opposite direction to the northern. The reversal of the turbo
would thus be an early type of that diabolical incantation " saying the Lord's Prayer backwards." Burchard bishop of Worms, who wrote on ecclesiastical punishments in the I2th century, mentions a wife's sortilege.^ The naked body was smeared with honey ; she then rolled herself in wheat spread upon a cloth on the ground ; carefully picked off every grain that adhered to the honey ; ground this wheat in the mill, turning the reverse way ; and made cakes of it to weaken and kill her husband. The church's penance for this was 40 days on bread and water.
Mr. Andrew Lang seems to identify the p6[x^o^ of the Dionysiac Mysteries with the Ka)vo<;, and both with the turndun, the bull-roarer of English country lads, the Gaelic srannam (strantham) and the bribbun of Australia. The bribbun is a fish-shaped flat board of wood tied to a string and whirled
round so as to cause a peculiar muffled roar. The /cwvo?,
according to Lobeck {AglaopJiainus, 700) was " a little slab of
wood tied to a string, and whirled round in the mysteries to make a whirring noise." The instrument has been tracked, .says Mr. Lang, almost round the world.
Nortia, Nurtia, or Nursia, was the Volscian (or the Etruscan) goddess of fortune, of destiny, of time. This has been conjectured to be a corruption of Nevortia, the immovable, that which cannot be turned away, or of Neverita. She appears to have resembled
the Fortuna of the Latins. The Etruscan mirrors frequently give the divinities of destiny carrying the sphere, the pole, and a mystic chest, which may be the area containing the arcana of the future. Another Etruscan deity of destiny is Mean, who has been conjectured to be the same with Mania, the mother of the Lares.^
She was represented winged : for Fortune and Victory— alas ! for
the beaten and the luckless—are both winged ; and even docking the wings of their statues (so they treated Ni/c?; at Athens) will not
keep them at home. But the wings are also, and perhaps primarily, the attributes of these goddesses, as powers of the flying heavens.

two statues of the Fates, but Zeus Moiragetes (leader of the Fates
or Dispensers) is dedicated instead of the third of the Fates
(Motpai). One of Numa's famous precepts, of which Plutarch gave the
priority to the Pythagoreans, was " Turn-round to pay adoration to the gods ; sit after you have worshipped." And hereon Plutarch observed that as to the turning which worshippers were to use in
divine adoration, it was said in his time to represent the rotatory
motion of the Universe.^ Unless, indeed, added he, this change of posture may have a mystical meaning [as if the first was not mystical enough !] like the Egyptian Wheels,^ and signify to us the instability of human fortune ; and that in whatsoever way Zeus
changes and turns our lot and condition, we should rest contented
and accept it as right and fitting. The theories here developed
reconciles Plutarch's two explanations into one. The foregoing leads up naturally to the globe or sphere (the
more perfect symbol) and wheel of Fortune volubilis Fortuna^which have not yet perhaps been adequately accounted for. Such wheels were to be found not very long ago in Brittany in several churches and chapels, either hung from the roof, or high up against a pillar. The wheel was provided with little bells, and with a pendant
cord which, when pulled by a devotee, set the wheel turning. Youths
and maidens consulted these wheels about their own juvenile wishes but staid men and the aged did so also as to their worldly projects.
There is an account of such a wheel in the Abbey church at Fecamp given by Baldric, Bishop of Dole, who visited the monastery about the year 1120.^ This Normandy v/heel seems to have been an elaborate piece of mechanism ; for it not alone revolved, but rose
and fell rota Fortunce quce desceudebat et ascendebat, et semper
rotabat. It is perhaps needless to multiply instances ; but there is a similar English wheel mentioned in the Monasticuni Angliaun (i, 104) which being full of little bells was turned to excite increase
of devotion ad inajoris excitationevi devotionis. Here, there is no room for doubt, we have a survival of the adoration or the praying
wheel proper. But the Breton wheels were clearly for speiring into
the future, and there was a triangle inscribed in some of them, with
^ Clough's Plutarch's Niima, 147, 148. - This wheel idea is also to be found, I think, in Clement of Alexandria [Sironi.

figures of a child, a youth, and an old man at the corners. There is among the Blockbooks exhibited in the British Museum (No. 14) a wheel of Fortune^ containing a human figure, which is altogether as like the Whe~el of Ixion given at p. f as well may be. That distinguished mythologist, M. Henri Gaidoz, whom I hope to number among the adherents of this portion at all events of these theories, writes thus of the globe and wheel of Fortune" But now we meet with Fortune, ^\'hose wheel has become a hackneyed and a famous symbol, i)i which the wheel has tost its sense of a solar symbol. The wheel is here the emblem of the
mobility, of the volubility, of human affairs. But it must be noted that as an emblem of Fortune the wheel has a doublet or a substitute ; when Fortune has no wheel she has a globe. Wheel and globe alternate one with the other ; they are evidently divergent transformations, the doublets of a same symbol. Wheel,
ball, and disk, have the same signification." "I say ditto to Mr. Burke" (as Southey vouched the second candidate to have done at Bristol), except that instead of saying the Wheel of Fortune "has lost" the sense of a solar symbol, I move the previous question, and say it never had it. The title of
Fortuna redux, the bringer-round, seems especially applicable to an unrollcr of the events of Time, to the revolver of the sphere of heaven which "brings about" those events. Accordingly it is given to Fortune only in a secondary way ; the supreme Jupiter is the deus redux. Thus there seems to me to be little reason to
doubt that these particular wheels of Fortune are also resolvable into the Universe-Wheel ; and they were turned by the provident and by the impatient alike, to prompt, to hasten the evolution of
events, or to forecast them. Thus the imitative adoration-wheel became not only a praying but a divination apparatus ; and this last form of it may even have preceded the custom of set prayer. Thus the old original Great Wheel of Fortune is not a roulette. It is worth noting that the Baal-God of the Canaanites simply meant Lord, that is God, of Fortune.

Wheel itself is connected by Fick with the roots kar, to move
round, and kal, to drive. Thus the Russian kolo is a wheel,
and %o'\o9, the axis or pole of revolution, is said to stand for a
(non-existent) word koKo'^. This last may, I think, be doubted furiously, as the French say.
Whirl, a motion ; ivhorl and zvherve, a spinning-weight ; and
ivhotd of leaves, are all obviously of the same family as wheel.
Quern ought to belong to these, one would imagine ; and it is
referred to the root gar to grind, which is the same as kar, Clumi

A
SIMILAR origin must be suggested for the Egyptian
super-excellent sacred glyph Rd, _0, which, with one
notable exception —the iconoclastic Amenhotep IV—is invariably
initial in the glyphic names of kings, no matter what its proper syllabic order in those names may be. The glyph Ra, though generally called a disk, seems more accurately to be a sphere
that is, of course, a hemisphere—in low relief, whether on Egyptian or Assyrian monuments. With the spot in the centre, O, the glyph may have indicated the heavens and their omphalos. Or the spot may even be the punctum saliens of the Universe-Egg
(see p. t), the point at which the life-spark was supposed to be kindled ; or it may be the name of a solid wheel. And the attentive reader will have seen that these suppositions are in no way conflicting, but rather cumulative ; they are all " on the spot " ; on the same central spot of the Universe. The supreme position of Ammon-Ra as King of the Gods, may thus perhaps receive a fresh illustration. The Egyptian temples where the
suspended wheels appeared (see p. 605), or their .sites, may have originally been dedicated to the revolving-heavens deity ;
but the wheel may have often come to be identified, or rather
confused, later with the disk of the Sun rolling like a wheel upon
its heavenly diurnal course. "The Masonic 'point within a circle'," says the Chinese scholar
Mr. H. A. Giles,^ " is held to represent the one Supreme Power,
whatever that Power may be, the great architect of the Universe, recognised alike by ourselves, and our brother masons of every religious denomination." This is extremely curious and interesting for my purposes ; and it must not
be forgotten that Ptah was assisted in Egypt by the Seven Khnumu or Architects. Mr. Giles
justly considers it curious also that the same emblem should be found among the Chinese
"signifying, if not Heaven itself, still the most
prominent object in the sky"—namely the Sun. He points out how it was (that is, how it is alleged by the Chinese to have
been) the ancient form of the character for Sun, which is now

written Q, a shape which it had almost taken in the Shuo Wen dictionary, of our first century. I venture entirely to deny that this symbol originally meant the sun in China. It may have descended to it. But how anyone wlio patiently reflects and compares can take this round with a centre for the sun as
" a dot within the circle of the sky," I cannot comprehend. This, too, is a quite opposite explanation from the " disk of the sun," which is the common form now used by almost everyone. And as a matter of stubborn, universal, unvarying fact, the sun is not a dot at all to the human eye ; nor is it in the centre of the circle of the sky, except only on the equator at the equinoxes and at noon.
All the rest of the time it is (save at rising and setting) an eyeblasting blaze moving over the heavens. The comparatively modern Chinese, I suggest, may have made
a mistake similar to that of the Japanese—they are both hopeless
as archaeologists—who mis-apply the word aim (heavens, sky) to
the sun. In the Rev. Dr. Wm. Wright's Empire of the Hittites, Prof Sayce says that the following Khetan ideograph O " is the solar
disk." In an inscription from Jerabis, now in the British Museum, he says, "it is preceded by the determinative of divinity and must here, accordingly, denote the Sun-god" (pp. ^p^~)
168, 183). I believe there is firm ground for saying that,
so far, there is no " Hittite " reason for connecting these emblems, as Hittite, with the sun. The ideograph O seems to me to be a
solid archaic wooden wheel, with its central nave-1 for the axle.
Otherwise, how can that navel be accounted for ; and, in any case, what can the hole have to do with the Sun ? And we have even
another equi-valent and most adaptable idea for the symbol —the
revolving Universe-millstone (see p. 464) which replaces the wheel in Norse mythology, and the " Eye " of which is directly above the Hvergelmer well, the source of all heavenly, earthly, and under
ground waters.^ Further, presuming the duplex "determinative of divinity" to have been hit upon with his usual happy ingenuity by Prof. Sayce, I would suggest that it may be an emblem of the dual divine nature, as male and female ; but it must not be forgotten that it is a form of the Cypriote syllable Mo.

Rhodian cross is straight and quite different.^

The Wreath.
THE wreath, apparently as an analogue of the wheel, is found
in Christian symbolism from the 6th to the 9th centuries. The hand of the supreme deity is seen issuing from the wreath, just as we have seen the divine torso issuing from the wheel.
Ciampini, in the Vetera Alonnnienia, has given instances from the Roman churches of SS. Cosmo and Damian, S. Euphemia, S. Stefano in Monte Celio, S. Agnese, S. Praxede, and S. Maria Nuova. Indeed Bosio in Roma Sotterama gives a much earlier wreath from a grave-stone in the catacombs, in which we actually do find the torso ; and he adds another wreath from a catacomb.
Sarcophagus, where the wreath acts as fellies to six spokes ; and
further, Gori, in Synibolcs Literariee, gives a similar design from a
brass shield, also found in the catacombs. These two last do not display the hand ; but Gori's
brass, of which a tracing is here given, contains the A and 12. I direct attention to the form of the final letter, which may have been adopted as
a triune symbol, and its lilceness to the fleur
de-lis is patent. Of course it will not be forgotten that the wreath, or crown, was a very ancient pre-Christian symbol of supremacy, whether in sovereignty or in victor}'.

THE wheel which eventually gave us our " gothic " wheel
windows and rose-windows may be detected in the remoter times of Christianity. Here is one from the "sculp
tures of the ancient sarcophagi of the Catacombs
earliest epoch," taken from Didron's IconograpJiic
Chrctienne (fig. loi). And here is another from the capital of a column in the Church of St. Demetrius at
Salonica of the 4th century {ibid. fig. 102). It may be a defect of perception on my part, but I cannot imagine how Didron could
claim the first of these as a variety of the Greek form of the Cross of Christ, and the second as " a Greek cross or star, with six equal branches." On the same page he certainly does use the term " Mystic Wheel " ; but the symbols cannot be
cross, wheel, and star, all at once or at choice. For me they are obvious survivals of the Universe-wheel ; and I add for comparison a specimen of a six -spoked wheel from a Roman covered travelling waggon called a covimis, which exhibits a striking resemblance to the Salonica example above given. It is taken from the French edition of Guhl and Koner's work.^
Every tarik or path, that is order, of the
Muslim dervishes has its particular sign. That of the Kadiri is the rose (gul) worn on the cap. It is thus expounded by Ibrahim el Eshreme. Mahomet called his two grandsons Hasan and Hosein, his two Eyes, his two roses. The rose is a sign of the prophet himself. The Kadiri " rose " of Bagdad has two outer and two inner
rings and three circles, and is made of green cloth. The first circle signifies shir'at, the Law [which is just the Buddhist's wheel of the
Law] : the second the tarik or path of the order ; the third the
' La Vie antique : Rome. Paris, 1885, fig. 360. The covlnus or covinnus was also a Breton and Belgic war-chariot. The word is said to be from the Celtic, and perhaps contains the same root as our cover, and cove, to arch over. The roof of the waggon was barrel-arched over in the manner common in our own London brewer's dray.

" the fakir, the hakir, the kitmir (that is, dog of the Seven Sleepers)
of the gate of the sultan of the saints who dwell by the rivulets of paradise."^ One of the cap-roses of the Rufai dervishes " is a

M. Napoleon Ney'' says the secret societies of Islam in Algeria
form a clan of the Chain (Ahl es Selselat) ; their holiness is a
Ladder, at the summit of which is the R'outs, the refuge or Saviour ; the members followed the Way, trika ; and the initiation
is called "taking the oiirid" or rose. "What Rose do you wear?" is the question of one Moslem to another. M. Ney's suggestion that this Rose (which I identify with the Universewheel) is the true mystical rose of Rosicrucianism, must be
accepted as the veritable theory on the subject. And, of course the rose is not a flower but a rose-cross, that is a wheel-cross.
This theory at once makes plain the perennial puzzle of stereo
typed snh rosa, and effectively glosses such a phrase as " rosarium
auxilium," in Appuleius.* It also gives the true etymology of
rosary. For rose and roue ; rosa and rota (wheel) and Irish roth (wheel) ; Greek polov (rose), Portuguese roda (wheel) and Welsh rhod (wheel) ; with the Sanskrit ratha a wheel-cart, all come from
one source. And as for the derivation from the dialect word ^pohov and therefore from the ancient Persian vrada and Sanskrit
vrad, " to bend, be flexible," which Littre patronised for rose (but not for roue), I venture to say that it is as wild as anything ever set up by the old snapshot school of All-eggs-under-the-grate
etymologists. This also gives us, at last, the true key to the interminablydisputed etymology of the island-name Rhodes. Other suggestions were that Rhodes comes from the rose-briar itself, or from the
oleander or rose-laurel, the poSo-Bd(j)vr] ; or from pod or pocd " the tree or fruit of the pomegranate." But it is obvious from the
similarity of this last word to rose that it must also, and perhaps
initially, have meant the flower of the shrub. And all these

suggestions are nonsensical ; for the rose, oleander, and pomegranate are rampantly luxuriant not in Rhodes alone, but in the
Levant generally. But we may retain for further use the probable fact that the
word poa, porj, or poia is the original name of the rose-w/ieet which would throw a considerable light on the symbolism of the fruit of the poa-flower, the pomum granatum, the garnet-apple itself The shrub sprang from the blood of Dionusos ; also from
the blood of Agdistis. 'Volo, the daughter of Staphulos and
Chrusothemis, was shut-up (pregnant by Apollo) in a coffer, and
launched to sea—a Moses-myth. The Telchines who called themselves Heliades (rj\td8e<i) that
is children not " of the Sun " (they might as well be called " of
Elias ") but " of "HA-to9 the great central god who primes Sunworship, and whose nomen appears in so many ages and tongues
in II, El, 'EXajd/Sako^i, "EXevo<i and 'EXevrj, and so forth. These Seven Heliades were born of Helios and the goddess Rhodos or Rhode, one of the Okeanides, daughter of Poseidon and Aphrodite. That is, as it might be interpreted, the Seven of Ursa Major were born of the turning of the Wheel which has produced or spun all creation. This is why the Rhodians, descendants of the (Seven) Heliades, called themselves autochthones. And Rhodes is thus a
true parallel in its genesis to the Japanese Onogoro ; for Helios or Apollo (apud Pindar) asked Zeus for the island, which he had discerned in the depths of the Ocean. Lachesis, the Fortunegoddess of the golden spindle and the star-spangled robe, then extended her hands, and Rhodes appeared on the surface of the waters.^ It is thus forced upon us that Helios must here have its
screwing, revolving sense, and that the spinning or churning motion imparted by Lachesis is as important as in the case of Onogoro ; and this is a paramount origin-reason for calling Rhodes
the wheel-island (or the whirled, churned, spun, island) ; Avhich all the gods, before its production, swore the great oath to place for ever on the head of Helios ; that is to make of it a central-land on the Axis, a middle-kingdom, the Earth in fact ; for all these Islands are but figures of the Earth : and the gold that rained
upon Rhodes is nought but the heavens-river— tlie Yellow River
of Chinese myth — descending upon the Earth.

The Rhodian Helios was son of Hyperion and Basileia ; he was drowned by the Titans ; and in his myth actually crops up the great mythological leading incident for which I contend throughout
this hiquiry. In a dream, 'YXkvr) (daughter of Zeus) tells her grieving father that the quenched Helios was placed among the
gods, and that wliat zvas theretofore called in the heavens the Sacred
Fire zaas tJienceforzuard to be called Helios or the San. Helios is
also son of Perseus. It would be absurd to contend that the Heliades-nymphs who became poplars were daughters of the Sun. Their metamorphosis shows them to be central Universe-tree dryads. (I am not
forgetting the long and short e, the r/ and the e, nor the presence and absence of the aspiration.) What can Helas son of Perseus and Andromeda have to do with the Sun ? What has Helene to do with the Sun ? Mount 'EXt/ccoj/'? name cannot possibly be drawn from the Sun. It is here impossible to avoid the repetition of the central mythic
cosmic fact that 'KKlkij means a turn or a tower, a round turn, a
volution ; and therefore the great celestial revolver, the Great Bear. The Seven sons of this same Helios (or of Apollo) by the nymph Rhode were (apud Diodorus Siculus) Kerkaphos, Kandalos, Makareus (Makar ?), Triopas, Aktis (to act, to actuate, action
and activity, of course come from the root a^; to drive ; as well as agent, axis and axle do), Ochimos, and Tenager, This is clearly a great heptarchy of great gods.
The eldest of them, Kerkaphos—also called the fourth Heraklis
or fourth Makar —was probably a revolving-heavens-light god —see KepKL^ a spindle, KepKco to weave, KepKvpa and K.6pKvpa, Corcyra, Corfu—perhaps another spun-island. Kerkaphos fathered the three

Li'ndos. The mother of lalusos was Kvp/Sela (but Kurba and Putna and Hieraputna were also names of the Cretan Kameiros town) The lalusians were also Telchines ; they had the P^vil-eye, and were changed to Rocks. The mother of Lindos was Kudippe.
This triad divided the earth (i.q. Rhodes) between them. A PlKEnician myth m.akes Kadmos, the creator and First-man, pursue his sister Europe and Zeus to Rhodes, where the great cemetery

sons of Makar, or four Makars, took possession of the four Makarian islands, Lesbos, Chios, Samos and Cos. Rhodes (like
Cyprus) was also called Makar—it may be the central island (as it were mythically, though not geographically) of the four. The
meanings of " happy," " blessed," for ficiKap (compare /xaKpd<;, great, high, distant ; /jiaKeSvo<;, long, tall ; and MuKeSovia, and also what is said of the Maccabees, p. t ) must be entirely secondary meanings ; just as the beatific sense of " that blessed word Mea-oTTora/xia " is assuredly due to its mid-position between the heavens-rivers : there is Paradise ; there is Nirvana.
These four Makar gods or genii should be, according to all the
analogies in this Inquiry, the four gods or spirits of the Cardinal points.
Armenios or Armenos, the argonaut, was a native of the Roseisland, Rhodes. Iphi-Kles, brother of Hera-Kles and an argonaut (who eats the rust of a knife which rusted in an oak) is said to have seized Rhodes. Phorbas, son of Argos or of Lapithos, and thus a heavens-stone god, came from Ehs (that is descended from the heavens) on the Island. There was a temple there to Helene Dendritis (thus a Universe-tree goddess). Nor should it be forgotten that Helene named another island (alias Makronisi) one
of the Cyclades {k,vic\o<^, a wheel); and there Paris had his first
interview with her— a clear parallel to Izanagi and Izanami. In view of the functions of Lachesis in producing Rhodes, it is worth noting one Simonides is said to have written that the Kolossos was constructed by one Laches of Lindos, and that these lines were inscribed at its foot

This is generally discredited, but it seems just as valuable as
anything else told of the Kolossos, and it fits singularly into my arguments ; for the consonance of Laches and Lachesis would point to the mythic spindle-Axis and make the Kolossos an Atlas. Attention is directed to the sacred number of (8 x lo =^)cigJity ; and the tradition also says that the artist (whether Laches or Chares)
worked tzuehe years at it. Eight and twelve are, as is abundantly seen here, the half cardinal and zodiacal points. Recollect the French rose-des-vcnts with its (8 x 4 =) 32 rhumbs, or spears.

We must not quit Rhodes without a glance at Rhodope, the Ocean-goddess who wedded Al/zo?. This pair, aspiring to be worshipped under the names of Zeus and Hera, were changed into Mountains. On the summit of Mount Aimos, the Balkans of to-day, the poets placed Ares when prospecting the earth for the slaking of his fury. The Aimodes were also Seven Western islands (peaks .'' the Shetlands ?) ; and the Romans are said^ to have so f?) called the victims immolated to Jupiter Fulminans. Al[xo<; is a
thorn, a spit, which is a connection with the central spit-axis whose end enters the eye of the Cyclops. [A folklorist (suspected of an occasional sardonic grin at his
fellows) has perfidiously suggested that the oath by " the holy Poker " must have originally been sworn by the Universe-axis.] K'lfjbwv was a King of Thebes, that is of the heavens. The place name Haemi Extrema, a cape in Thrace, must have a similar origin, and so must Ha^monia for Thessaly. Akastus, son of Pelias and husband of Atalanta, was called Haemonian. lason was
hsemonius juvenis ; Achilles, haemonius puer, and so forth. There was a Rhodopean spicula as well as a Rhodopean rock ; and Orpheus, who was of Rhodope, was changed into a rock.

The Shoes of Swiftness.
And he walketh on the vault of the Heavens. {Job xxii, 14.)
I
HAVE already theorised, under the headhig of the Loadstone Mountain, when deahng with the brazen, tireless, feet of Talos, that a walking or running round of the hea\ens-gods may have been devoutly believed in before the conception of a wheel arose in the human brain. This maybe the chief clue to the
leading significance of all the footprint legends and also of those of the shoes of swiftness, and the mythic and sacred sandals, and slippers. We should thus have three differing though coinciding theories of the going o{ the heavens: (i) the walking, running, or dancing ; (2) the flying ; and (3) the Wheeling. This walking-round idea of the heavens seems to be preserved to us in the English Welkin ; so etymologists need perhaps no longer be so shy of connecting the word with the Anglo-Saxon wealcan, to walk, to roll ; the last, oddly enough, being it is said
the earlier sense (see Prof Skeat's Dictionary).

Pallas Athene binds beneath her feet her lovely ambrosial golden sandals that bear her alike over the wet sea and over
the limitless land, swift as the breath of the wind {Odyss. i, 96.) Hermes does precisely the same in the same " run " of words (v, 44.), Here is called golden-sandalled (xi, 604). These shoes of swiftness are clearly the common wear of the deities of the revolving heavens
and that must of course be the original reason why Apollo was called Sandaliarius at Rome ; and the cobblers came to the god,
instead of the god —which is base—taking his name from the cobblers. I think we must also, on a comparison with El's walking
on the vault of the heavens, in Job (xxii, 14), admit a similar conception of the majestic progress of the heavens-god in the fine passage in NaJium (i, 3) : "Jehovah hath his way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet." The idea here favoured as to all the celestial foot-chases, such as that of the swift huntress Atalante by HippoMenes, and of the Roar of Kalydon by Atalante among a very select field, is that they have their origin in the running-round of the heavenly hosts in chase of one another : and that that is why Zagreus (lost in Dionusos) was called a mighty hunter. Another aspect of the same
cosmic motion is of course the dance of the stars, yopa'^o'^ aorpwv

fully treated of under the head of " Dancing." The Irish Feni (= the Whites), the subjects of Finn (= White, bright) were swift of foot. Finn's nephew especially was renowned for this quality. I constantly have occasion to point out that whiteness (see Argos) is a common note of the heavens in all myth ; and this is giving a high origin to the names of the Fenians and the Whiteboys. A triad of the champions of the Feni were
Finn-, Dubh-, and Treun-Chosach = Whitefoot, Blackfoot, and
Strongfoot.The third name compares with the shoes of IppiKrates, and indicates an axis-power ; the second with MclamPous, and the first and second can refer to heavens-walkers of the day and of the
night. To change the venue somewhat, we find in that odd booklet of
Cyrano de Bergerac's L Histoire couiique des Etats et Empires de la Liine (the same that fore-made the phonograph), that he throws it
out that the earth may very well turn, not for the reasons which

Copernicus alleges, but because the fire of hell being at its centre, the damned, in their efforts to get away from the flames, scramble
along the vault, like the dog in a spit-wheel, and so send the earth round ! Perseus got his winged sandals (TrrTjva 7reSt\a and ireBiXa vTroTTTepa) from the white-haired triad of Graiai (hags), with the cap of Hades ("AtSo? Kwy) : note that kwyj also = dogskin), that is
the cap of invisibility, and the (beggar's) wallet (Kt(3Lat<;y which is also owned by the Japanese god of Fortune, Hotel. Here doubtless we also get the real clue to the seven-league Boots and the Shoes of Swiftness of Jack the Giant-Killer. He gets them from a huge and monstrous Giant with three heads, who
runs and hides himself in his large vault under ground —a fallen triune god. The Norse Loki wears these shoes when he escapes from hell. The two Pisasha demons in Stanis/as Julicris Indian Tcle> from the Chinese, have each a magic shoe, and when he puts it on he can walk as if flying, without encountering any obstacle. In the Katlid Sarit Sdgara the shoes of the (male) Ma)'a give the
pov/er of fl>'ing through the air. This Maya was the architect and artificer of the Asuris, dwelt on the Deva-giri (god-mountain) and built the palace of the shining white Pandavas of the heavens. In the German story of " Heads off! " are a pair of boots which carry the owner wherever he wishes to go. In the Norse tale of the Three Princesses of Whiteland (the heavens) is a pair of boots which make the wearer invisible and enable him to go where he pleases. In the Greco-Italian tale of Lion Bruno, the robber who
pulls-on the boots can run a mile faster than the wind. In Solomon's slipper (in the Persian tale of King Bahram Ghur) which is wrought with threads of gold, a joUrney of a hundred years wearies not, but seems a distance of a hundred steps. It is given to the King by the lord of one of the four cardinal KafMountains of the Universe. In a tale of the King and his Seven Sons- are a pair of sandals which carry the wearer where he wishes. In the Indo- Persian tale Bahar-i-Danish a pair of wooden clogs transport the wearer from end to end of the world in the twinkling of an eye ; and there is the German and Portuguese magic tale of the " Dancing shoes." I here draw upon one of many useful chapters

in Mr. W. A. Clouston's Popular Tales and Fictions (i, 72) ; but only so far as the incidents are concerned.
The shpper incident in the Cinderella myth finds its place quite naturally in this magic shoe-shop. Perhaps one of the earliest appearances of the Cinderella slipper is in the Rhodope legends.
I cite the version in Abraham Fleming's blacklettcr translation
(1576) of Tlic Variable Hystoric of rElianns (bk. xiii, ch. 32). " Of the Fortune of the harlot Rhodope . . . As shee was washing herself uppon a time, and her wayting maydens keeping her apparell, an Eagle came swingeing downe out of the christall ayer, and snatcheth up with her talans one of Rhodopes shooes, and carried the same with her as far as Memphis, and there let it fall in the lap of Psammetichus, as he sate in iudgement. At the fairenes wherof, and the cunning workemanship therin shewed,
he much mervailing — and besides that, wondering not a little at the
straunge deede of the Eagle —commanded that a general search should be made throughout al Grecia for the person whose fine foote that prety shooe fitly served. In ye executing of which precept Rhodope was founde, and therupon presented to Psammetichus ; in so much that the vertue of her amiable personage did not only kindle the fier of love in Psammetichus
hart—wherby he had her in no small estimation —but did so inflame his affections, and wynde his wit in suche knots of intangling desires, that hee maryed her forthwith, and enioyed her company in the pleasaunt and delectable bed of wedlocke." The viidlci of the fabled kings of Alba (the heavens) were
purple, that is blood-dipped, slippers {Festns). This must be the
origin of la mule du pape. There is a golden cross on the slipper of the pope, which might be likened to the suastika on Buddha's
footprint, and which cross it is that is kissed by the devout. In
French the word in?de is now alone applied to this particular pantoufle. Baiscr la mule du pape, they say for what English less
reverently calls kissing the pope's toe. Red slippers are put on a
dead pope's feet, which are then put out through the railings of the
chapel where he lies in state, that the faithful may kiss them as
they throng by. I suppose we must detect somewhat of the same supremely sacred general idea in our own otherwise idiotic observances as to
carefully throwing old shoes and slippers, " for luck." The Moslem shares these pagan weaknesses with the Christian.

Buddha's Footprint.
TD UDDHA'S Footprint.— \ here find it indispensable to devote
"^ some space to the famous Footprints of Buddha, and their
connection with the Wheel. The bas-reliefs of the Amravatti Tope (near the mouth of the Kistnah, on the East coast of India) afford numerous examples of the footprint. These carvings, which are supposed to date from the 2nd to the 5th centuries A.D., frequently represent altars on or
before which are a pair of footprints marked with the chakra
(wheel), but with no other figures. On one fragment is cut in relief a large pair of feet, which exhibit other emblems. "In the
centre of the soles," describes Professor Fergusson, " is the chakra ;
above it the trisul emblem reversed, with a suastika on each side.
Below the chakra is the suastika again, with an ornament like the
crux ansata on each side. On the great toe is the trisul ; on each
of the other toes a suastika."^ Before proceeding farther, stress must be laid on the considera
tion that the chakra or wheel, the trisula, and the suastika are all claimed in this Inquiry as insignia of the central heavenly polar deity. On one of the gate pillars of the Sanchi Tope there is
carved a large footprint marked with the chakra, in this case " an
unmistakable chariot-wheel."' E. Burnouf gave a list of the footprint-emblems in his Lotus de la Bonne Loi (1.S52), which he took from the Cinghalese Dharnia Pradipika ; and Col. Low contributed another, which he took from a Siamese source, to the Transactions of the Royal Asiatic Society. Alabaster gave another in his
translation of the Siamese Life of Buddha. In all of these, the centre of the foot is occupied by the chakra. In Alabaster's list of emblems we find that
" On each of his feet is a figure of the beautiful wheel chakra
with its thousand rays or spokes, all richly adorned as if it were a
wheel of emeralds. Its outline is shown by elegantly drawn circles, and its centre is filled with exquisite devices, which gleam
in beauty like the jewelled chakra of the angels. Around the

chakra are loS other figures ; namely, the crystal spear . . .
a palace ... a chakra . . . the mountains which form the walls of the world ; the Himalayan forest ; Mount Meru
. . . the constellations ... a figure of the lord of the
chakra (Vishnu ?) . . . the seven great rivers or seas, the
seven chains of mountains that encircle those seas ; the seven
great lakes . . ." (Alabaster, p. in.) Alabaster, commenting on this, fully recognises the cosmical character of the loS symbols, which of course are not unconnected with the 108 names of Vishnu. We have, says Alabaster, Mount Meru, the centre of each system of the Universe ; the seven annular mountains that surround it, and the seven belts of ocean between them . . Mount Chakrawan (Chakrawala) the wall of the world, the crystal annular mountain which encircles the system ; a group of stars
which may refer to the principal constellations, or the signs of the
zodiac. He then proceeds to give a plate which is taken from the
facsimile in the great Wat Po temple at Bangkok of the footprint at Phrabat ; and he points out that the 108 Siamese compartments tally in number with those of the Burmese footprint in the British Museum and with those of a Ceylon drawing in Mr. Skeen's account of Adam's Peak ; this is also the number of the " evident
gates of the Law" in the Lalita Vistdra. Continuing his com
mentary, Mr. Alabaster says, as to the crystal spear, that the
word crystal, keon, is applied in Siam to anything gemlike, or
beautiful, or royal. The "trident," or ^'r/sula, which appears on the
footprint, he represents as the "weapon of Siva." As engraved from a photograph, it resembles rather an archaic fleur-de-lis ; and, ab origine, must have been rather the triune emblem of a triad
than a "weapon" (see ante, p. 62). I direct especial attention to
the fact that the spear is the first symbol on the footprint, the palace the second, and the /rz'sula the third. Thus the palace stands between the " spear," representative of the Universe-Axis, and the /r/sula, representing the central
supernal triad. The /r/sula also consists
clearly of a reproduction of the spear itself with the addition of two side-branches curved outwards, which form the fleur-de lis ; as may be seen from the rough sketches

here given. The connection between the Japanese spear and palace (pp. 43, 228) will be borne in mind. The following description of
the " palace of the angels," which occurs a second time in the footprint, is taken from the Book of Iintra, one of the most ancient of the Siamese law-books : " There is a celestial abode in the Dewa heavens, an aerial dwelling covered with gold and gems, with roofs shining with gold and jewels, and roof-points [ornamental finials] of crystal and pearl ; and the whole gleams with wrought and unwrought gold, more brilliant than all the gems." This is clearly a myth taken from the gorgeous night-heavens of the limpid-aired East. The mountain appears in the footprint in ten compartments ; seven of these are together, and three are
single and separate. But the footprints are otherwise connected with the world- mountain, and also with the Tower. The Chinese
pilgrim-traveller Fah-Hian (circ. A.D. 400) mentioned the footprint on Adam's Peak, and another at Sangkashi—perhaps Sankisa^ about which he wrote that " a Tower is erected where there are certain marks and impressions left on the stones by the feet of the different Buddhas." Sung-Yun, another Chinese, a century later, said " there is a trace of the shoe of Buddha on a rock ; they have raised a Tower to enclose it." It is by no means to be disregarded that the Adam's Peak footprint is claimed by Hindus as that of Siva, by Moslems as that of Adam, and by Christians as that of St. Thomas ; but the Buddhists are in possession.
My suggestion upon all this briefly is that the manifold symbols on the sole of the Buddha's Foot are not exactly the imprint left
thereon by his footing of the Universe, but that they figure forth the forms he impressed on the Universe in his progress. This is a reverse idea, a complement, a mould plus matrix idea. The various footprints we shall here see all over the world are made by
the divine feet ; but the print /;/ the divine foot —on its sole — is,
like the pattern cut in a butter-printer, the formative mould by
which Matter, by ivhicJi all things, were pressed, trodden, into Form

These feet on the lotus-flower on the (sheep-headed or calfheaded?) world-tortoise, and guarded by the triune Naga serpent, whose vast hood probably represents
the heavens-vault, must be taken to convey the same holy cosmic meaning
as the Footprint. The drawing is taken from plate 102 of the Hindu PantJieon of Moor, who remarks that " as to the exact reference of the pair of
feet on the back of the tortoise, the
author can give no satisfactory explanation." " In Japan Buddha is never represented by the feet alone, as in
the Amravati remains and many other Indian art-relics."^ The very natural human and common biblical metaphor of enemies as footstools is found in another form in Egypt, where overthrown and garotted foes were painted on the mummy's sandal
soles, which really furnishes a sort of a parallel to my theory about the soles of Buddha.^ David speaks (2 Chron. xxviii, 2) of building " a house for the footstool of our El." " Exalt ye Yahveh our El, and worship at his footstool" (Ps. xcix, 5). "Thus saith Yahveh, the heaven is my throne, and the earth is
my footstool" (Isaiah Ixvi, l). This last is applied to the Most High in the Acts vii, 49 (and of course I here always claim that
celestial position for the Polar deity). Of course the idea of the Footprint was pre-Buddhic in India;
and we find also another aspect of it, which seems to me clearly
to refer to a centrally placed deity at the Northern Pole of the Universe—where the visible world is displayed as it were his foot
stool. A connection between the Footstep and the Eye of the
heavens is even made in the Satapatha-brdJnmxnd^: " The wise
ever behold that Highest Step of Vishnu, fixed like an Eye in the heaven." We have this idea again in the Russian abbot Daniel's
pilgrimage to Jerusalem, 1106 A.D.,* where a mosaic of Christ is labelled : The sole of my foot is a measure of heavens and earth. This was on the vault which covered " the Navel of the Earth."

"There is also the temple of another Artemis," gibed the slapdash Clemens of Alexandria/ " Artemis Podagra (or the
gout) in Laconica, as Sosibius says." If this be not pod-arga, and thus white-footed, it ought to mean foot-bound, and would have
reference to a fixed-pole or fixed-axis (? a female oidiPous) goddess. For that is how I endeavour to explain the connection between the (differential) idea of the footprint we are just at this moment considering in these immediate instances ; and I connect this idea also with the gods who stand on One Foot (p. 215 supra). An oracle warned Pelias (who had succeeded KreTheus as king of lolkos) to beware of a one-shoed man (monosandalos), who turned out to be lason, who had lost one of his shoes or sandals in fording the heavens-river Anauros.^ (Compare the single sandal of Perseus at Chemmis.) The Samoan god Ti-iti-i pushed up the heavens, and his hoofs made holes six feet deep in the rocks as he pushed.^ Here we have the shoes of IphiKrates (or -os), and the nails in the shoes of Magnes, by which he is fixed
to the loadstone rock, as close variants. In the myth of Ila, the daughter of Manu makes in the form of a cow the print of her hoofs "on the most sacred spot of earth," the naveP ; and a mantra addressed to her says " glory to the butter
filled footmark of Idha." This butter (or ghee ?) in the footprint seems to be an analogue
of the oiling of the Semitic stones, pp. in and 120 supra. Agni, when generated by friction for the sacrifice, is placed " in the footmark of the Earth in the form of a cow (prithivya
//^zyaspade)," that is, according to the commentator Sayana, " on
the Northern Altar," Rig V. iii, 25. " Now sit down, Agni, on the footmark of Ila," 381. " Agni, we place thee upon the earth in the
centre [navel], in the place [footprint] of Ija (Ilayaspade nabha
prithivyah adhi) "
; that is, in the middle of the northern altar,
explains Wilson, adding that the same recurs in the YajusJi xxxiv, 14, 15, and is also quoted in the Aitareya BrdJiuiana i, 5. So that the passage has always been an important one. Rig V. iii, 34.

Saraswati, Mahi, the three goddesses who are the sources of
happiness," 243. We shall immediately see the three steps of Indra and of Vishnu (as Vamana). Vishnu is again to appear as (or seated on) Kalkin, the white horse, at the close of the present Kali yuga, or black age, with a flaming sword like a comet ; and the great white horse is to stamp its right fore hoof as the signal for the end
of all things. The print of a horse's hoof, to be seen in Cicero's time in a
silex at Regillus, was believed to have been made by Castor's horsc.^ The horse-fountain HippouKrene issues from the footstamp of Pegasos on Mt. Helikon, which like Helike, the great
Bear, must derive its name from its revolution, for it is the vault of
the heavens. Pegasos must be formed from Trrjji], a fountain, as has always seemed evident. He is the river-horse in point of fact of the heavens-river. The shoe of Perseus at Chemmis in Egypt (Herodotus ii, 91) must here be again mentioned. It brings
together the horse, the rider, and the footprint. Mailduin and his companions discovered a very large and broad and flat island, where was a broad green racecourse, in
which they saw immense hoof-marks the size of a ship's sail or of a laree dining-table. The horses were swifter than the wind.^ Have
we not in all these a sufficient origin for the practice of carefully
putting-up old horseshoes (which must be found promiscuous-like)
" for luck " ? Sir G. Birdwood, however, does not take this "footprint" view
of the sacred horseshoe. The vault of heaven, the womb of nature, with its included constellationary life, and above all the seven guardian planetary and twelve guardian zodiacal divinities, is what
is represented by the HorsesJioe with its seven gems or nails, by
the nava-ratna (nine-gems), and by the Ark. The two first are
magical images of the vault, that is talismans.^

At Mecca are Abraham's footprints. At Hebron is the print of Adam's foot in the Haram.^ Said a South African Bushman to Dr. Moffat^ : " I'll show you the footsteps of the very first

print of Christ's right foot is still shown on Mount Olivet, as it was in the twelfth century. In the Byzantine age, the prints of both feet seem to have been extant. These were the last marks made, as he sprung to heaven. The various Leaps that are shown must be connected with this. There is the saltus Domini at Nazareth, shown now as in the
twelfth century.^ Seven footprints were shown as Abraham's to Nasir-i-Khusran in A.D. 1047, on the south side of the Sakhrah Rock.^ The Itinerary of the Bordeaux pilgrim to Jerusalem (A.D. 333?)" said that the marks of the shoenails of the soldiers who killed Zacharias were to be seen throughout the whole enclosure, so clearly that you would think they were stamped in wax. One of the relics of Mahomet shown at the Mid-Ramazan festival of the hirkai'-sherif (holy mantle : compare the holy coats of Trier and Argenteuil) at Stamboul is a calcareous stone with the impress of the Prophet's foot, which he left either in mounting his horse at his own door, or else when he sprung up to heaven.'' Matthew Paris relates^ that the friar-preachers gave Henry HI a piece of white marble on

Predatory wild mankind doubtless took an absorbing interest in the tracks of the animals he chased ; but there was one footmark that outmarked all pawprints, the trace left by homo homini lupus, by the most terrorising of all the wild beast enemies of man, by savage Man himself Thus Defoe upon it "It happened one day, about noon, going towards my boat I was exceedingly surprised with the print of a man's naked foot
on the shore, which was very plain to be seen in the sand. I stood like one thunderstruck, or as if I had seen an apparition. . .
Like a man perfectly confused, and out of myself, I came home to
my fortification ; not feeling, as we say, the ground I went on, but
terrified to the last degree . . . fancying every stump at a
distance to be a man. ... I fled into my castle like one
pursued . . . for never frighted hare fled to cover, or fox to earth, with more terror of mind than I to this retreat. I slept none
that night . . . and did not stir out of my castle for three days and nights " {Robinson Crnsoe.
If there be anything in this view of the matter, it would be one instance, at all events, in support of the hackneyed verse of Petronius: Primus in orbis deos fecit timor ; though not in the
sense of the rest of the quotation, which runs : ardua coelo fulmina quum caderent.
I must also mention the custom of the ancient Egyptian pilgrim, who left the conventional print of both his poor feet
engraved at the shrine, with his name, quality, and genealogy. At Bramfield in Suffolk "there is not much of a view" from the round church tower, which stands at a distance from the church,
" but people go up there to cut their names atid tlic sJiape of their feet on the leads, and I thought perhaps as how you might like to cut yourn," said the parish clerk's boy-son to the traveller."

is given as the chief place of the tenth nome of Upper Egypt by
J. de Rouge; and Tebti Wj) is given as a pehu or division of the
twelfth nome of Upper Egypt by Brugsch. Can these places have
possessed holy Footprints, or shoes ? The very strange observance by which the skin was removed from the foot-soles of Egyptian mummies may have been a refinement upon the eastern custom of taking off the shoes when entering a mosque or even (in Japan) a house. " Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy ground " {Exodus iii, 5). And with this last we must connect the evil-working action of " shaking-off the dust of one's feet against " an enemy, as Paul and Barnabas did against the Jews
of Antioch of Pisidia {Acts xiii, 51), soon after Paul had "fastened his eyes " on Elymas the Magus at Paphos, and cursed and blinded
him, as is related a few lines earlier. This Egyptian funereal custom, observed as we might say on the mummy's entering the dread kingdom of Osiris, curiously enough crops up in an Icelandic tale.^ " The Giant told her that Hermodr was in a certain desert
island ; but she could not get there unless she flayed the soles of
her feet, and made shoes for herself out of the skin " [which
contains a confusing introversion of ideas] ; " and these shoes would take her through air and over water as she liked " ; this last giving us precisely the Odyssean sandals of Pallas Athene

Footprint.^ The Three Steps. 633
The Three Steps.
HTHE Three Steps. In the Rig Veda, "Vishnu is glorified, because that in his three paces all worlds abide " (ii, 94). He
is called " thrice-traversing " (ibid.), and he is said to have " traversed
the three regions with three wide steps" (ii, 97), and to have
"three times planted his foot" (i, 53); "his three imperishable
paces, filled with ambrosia, delight us with sacred food" (ii. 95);
and all these texts have their explanation in another statement that " Vishnu alone made, by three steps, this spacious and
durable aggregate " (ii, 95^. See also the strange text : " Four are
his horns, three are his feet, two are his heads, seven are his
hands " (p. 164). " Oh rivers, the dwelling-places of the intelligent gods are thrice three " (for each of the three Lokas has three divisions)
" the measurer of the three " [worlds] " is the sovereign at sacri
fices ; three females of the waters" [Ila, Saraswati, and Bharati] " charged with the rains descend from heaven at the triple
solemnity. . . . Three are the excellent uninjurable bright
regions " {Rig V. ii, loi). " The three" (divisions of the) " firma
ment" [Universe?], "the three worlds, the three brilliant spheres,
the three heavens" [the Indra, Prajapati and satya lokas] "the three-fold earth" {ibid. 218).
Some of the final additional notes (1849) of Guigniaut's Creuzer (ii, 1338) make the Zeus of Dodona a Universe-god of the three empires, heavens, sea (earth?) and hell, and he seems to corres
pond to the triple or three-eyed Zeus (Triopas and Tpi6(p6aXixo^) of the Argives and Etolians.^
When Bali usurped the sovereignty of the three worlds, Vishnu,
as Vamana the dwarf, tricked him into a gift of three paces of land, and then, growing vast, stepped from heaven to earth and hell. In the Taittirtya Santiitd, " Indra, assuming the form of a she
jackal, stepped all round the Earth (?) in three strides ; thus the gods obtained it." In a different temper Indra is addressed : " Devourer ! having trampled on the heads of the malignant, crush them with thy wide-spreading foot, th}^ vast wide-spreading foot

I suggest that these texts furnish us with the best interpre
tation of Gradivus as an adjectival title of Mars, and I support the
suggestion by his connection with the leaping, dancing Salii in Livy i, 20, 4 : (Numa) Salios item duodecim Marti Gradivo legit Shakespeare's scrap of some old hymn-song, too, in Lear (iii, 4, 125): "Saint Withold footed thrice the wold," seems to have its place here.
Lords of the Three Worlds, Sam-Kai-Kung, H W- S-, is the
term applied in Amoy to the spirits of the Universe.^ They are called Kwan 'g or governing-spirits, and the first is the T'lcn (heaven, %) Kwan, the next, the Te HI) Kwan, and the third the Sui 7j\c Kwan. The Chinese Buddhists also have their three worlds, tray-lokya, Sam-Kai (as above). Dr. De Groot says the three are
a kind of trinity always mentioned together ; a sole divinity in
three persons. They are addressed in inscriptions on lanterns as
H
'L'.' -X 'mj' Sam Kwan Ta Ti, which De Groot renders " O three governors, great gods " ; but I think it is obvious that we have
here at Amoy a popular Taoistic version of the Tai Ki triad.

Footprint^^ The Legs d Man. 6 35
The Legs o' Man.
n^ HE Legs d Man. It seems to me to be nothing less than obvious that this famous device finds its particular explanation
in these three Vedic steps, and its general one in the running
round of the heavens. It is found in Greek art both on the shield of Athene and on
the buckler of the giant 'Ey/ceXaSo? (/ce\a8o9 = noise), on whose body Jupiter threw Mount Etna, or otherwise Athene cast upon
him the whole island of Sicily— Sicilia, Sicelia, Si/ceXta, TpivaKui]
(Odyss.), Trinacria (y£?i)., Trinacris (Ovid), Triquetra (Horace).
One would be inclined to expound the names of the people

Siculi or St/ceA,o/—from seculum (archaically seclum), generation,
race, epoch ; and also to connect the word with the Campanian word for a falx, secuta (Varro), our sickle. Compare ^dyKXr] or
^dyK\ov, the Sicilian's scythe. The Siculi were said to have been
driven from the banks of the Tiber.
Besides the form of the three running legs—for they are with
out any manner of doubt running full speed—there was a form of
three sickles. The name triscelum, rptaKeXi]^, means three-legged ; but I think, in view of the unmistakeable three sickles on the coins of Megara and Megarsus and Lycia, we must also admit that the word could have meant three sickles. This parenthesis is
merely to clear the ground ; for the three helter-j-/^^/ter legs are
also found on the Lycian coins. But to account for the sickle, we
must, I think, go to the Speiravrj or dpTrr} of Kronos. There is
another view of these "sickles," that they are meant for curved radii to imply wheel-motion, like the designs on the Hissarlik
whorls (as to which please see Index).] These human legs are also on the coins of Aspendos in Pam
phylia, " charged " sometimes on a flj'ing eagle, sometimes accom
panied by a barndoor cock, regardant. On a Lycian coin the "sickles" even become three cocks' necks with crested heads. Three winged monsters take exactly the same position on a
Persian cylinder.^ On this subject, reference is also requested to "the Tomoye" (p. t)- This bird-symbology is, for me,

merely dififerent but not distinct from the other. The legs are the rounding-round of the heavens ; the wings mean their flying-round. The human legs, are also found on Celt-Iberian coins, with a
human face at the middle. There is nothing new in giving the idea of celestial motion to
these three running legs, but this interpretation of that motion has
hitherto been confined (so far as I am aware) to the theoretical three bounds of the Sun, its supposed hop, skip, and jump at morning, noon, and night. Faint lunar suggestions have indeed
also been made.^ But the major explanation which I desire to furnish, the running-round of the heavens, encompasses both sun
and moon as items in the universal march or course of the celestial phenomena. It is stated that the Legs are not found in the arms of the ancient kingdom of the Isle of Man before the thirteenth century.^
But what does that mean.? There is an original example in the
Heralds' College of a shield of the time of Edward P (1272- 1307) ; and this only proves to me that the badge may have existed any time previously. Such devices as that don't grow on such shields like mushrooms. It is also said to be in the arms of " many noble families in England, Germany, Switzerland, and Poland."^ The Duke of Athole (Stuart-Murray) quarters it ; so does the Earl of
Dunmore (Murray) — motto of both : Furth Fortune and Fill the Fetters. So does the Earl of Cromartie. Note by the way that
this motto is four F's. If they be arranged like this 4tti they
afford an exact fylfot with the addition of the short middle-bars.
Was this the motto's genesis ? And did both the fylfot and the four F's come, from the crusading fights, like much of our heraldry, as the conquest of the Manx and Scottish spears .? (See what is
said of the fylfot under the heading of " The Suastika.") The common term, as an inn-sign and so forth, for this Manx symbol is still " the Legs o' Man," an expression comparable to the French jambes de Gargantua. As to the Isle of Man here, there is much more to be said than meets the eye. The Gaelic is Inis-Manann, so called from Mannanan Mac Lir, a sea-god.

Cormac's Glossary made a merchant—that is I suppose a sedi-man

of him, and said he knew by examining the heavens how long fair or foul weather would last.^ This makes a heavens -god of him also. Lough Corrib ( = Orbsen) burst out of his grave over
the land- —a myth like those of Lough Neagh and of the Italian lake Albanus (see " The River.") Professor Rhys calls him " the great wizard of the sea " f and he says that Llyr (with which word I presume Lir is to be equated), " was a great deal more than a god of the sea ; he was apparently a form of the Celtic Dis, and was assimilated under the regime of the Romans with their Janus."
The town of Leicester ( = Leir-cestre = Caer Lyr) seems to have
been a great centre of his worship. If this symbol then ever belonged to Llyr, we should be drawn again towards my former suggestion that another triple emblem may, after all, be the Fleur de Lli, which river forms with Archan
the two rivers that separate Britain from the world of spirits, and through which the blessed Welsh Bran (son of Llyr) waded, like lason through the Anauros.* I would also suggest that Man and Maine are related. And it seems to me extremely interesting that
I should have been led quite independently to the identification of the Tomoye in Ireland (see p. t)- Thus there would not be one
but four triple Celtic emblems : the shamrock, fleur de Lit, tomoye and legs o' Man. We can even trace the triple idea again in the (now) GoodFriday Manx custom of making a large " hammock or soddog, with three corners," which is baked on the hearth itself, and not on a griddle, for no ij-ofi must touch the fire that day, a rowantree
stick being used as a poker.'' This ritual may thus actually date
from before the use of profane iron came in ; and the three-cornered cake is ceremonial and sacrificial, which gives us a genuine origin
for our popular jam-tarts in that form. " 6'<?^/-cakes " of this shape used to be made in our Lady God\wa.'s town of Coventry on New Year's Day, and sold about the streets.'' The names of these cakes and of Godiva are, it is presumed, to be referred to the Godes who

surrounded Odinn. But the triplicity in the tri-angle is that of a
triad or trinity. The Finnish Para is a three-legged scarecrow or fetish which could be endowed with life by three drops of blood from the left little finger, a magic word being spoken while they fall/ Its possessor is always sure of plenty of milk and cheese. " In the Cosmic philosophy of Hwai Nan-tsze (B.C. 122) it is asserted that a bird
with three legs exists in the sun."- Hel or Helle, Death in Norse mythology, rides a three-legged horse ; but this may only refer to the halting pace at which death overtakes many mortals.^ It would seem that we must also connect both the Tripod, tripus, rpLTTovi, and the tripudium, with the three-legged idea. Apollo as a prophetic god, that is as a power that brings round the sphere of the future, was frequently represented seated
or leaning on the tripod or on the Omphalos. Through the tripod he shoots his arrows at the Python on coins of Crotona.'' The
omphalos here gives a central celestial " pitch " to the tripod.
One of Apollo's two mighty tripods (rpLTrov^ fieya^;) is buried in
the land of Hyllus, "TXXo?, deep within the earth, that it may be ever hidden from mortal ken"' ; with the other tripod Triton
vanished into the Triton ian lake, Tripodo or tripudio was the verb which applied to sacred ritualistic dances or hops such as those of the Arvalian Brothers. The
dance itself was a tripodatio, and tripudatio was a dance of priests
round the altar. I think we need have no doubt that it was a wellaccentuated three-stepped movement, say like a polka. Tripudium must be the same word, and the augural sign so given by the sacred
chickens" must also have been a jumping " in exultatione," as Festus
in one place said it was. Fowl will sometimes do this—and a very
comical antic it is to see by accident—but only for a second or two ; and when one begins, two or three more will do the same ; and prank about as if demented. But it is all over before you can count half a dozen. The other explanation about pecking so hurriedly that the food dropped from their beaks, was invented

(Festus gives it also under Sollisthnuvi) by a man who was no henwife. It looks very much as if it was born of pure ignorance and a vulgar confusion of tripudatio with trepidatio ; unless indeed it
be also partly a " whim-wham for a goose's bridle," hit upon by augurs to give a crooked answer to cross questions. I can quote a very remarkable Chinese parallel for reading ritual
into the actions of birds. It is in the Li Ki^ where it is said (in
the Taoistic section called the Yiieh-Ling, or Monthly Calendar) that in the first month of autumn " Young hawks at this time
sacrifice birds, as the first step they take to killing and eating them." Elsewhere (in the Wang Chih or Regal Rules) the otter
sacrifices fish in the first spring month, and the wolf sacrifices
its prey.^ And this was a good deal older than Festus.

640 The Night of the Gods. [Bttddhas
The Chakra as Wheel of the Law.
OF all the symbols on Buddha's Footprint (see p. 624) it is
the chakra or Wheel that most immediately concerns us here.
In Professor Fergusson's bas-relief No. 2 from the sanchi tope there is a chakra " exactly like a chariot-wheel, with two figures
standing by it, and perhaps about to make it revolve, while others
around are offering it adoration." The Lalita Vistdm describes the chakra as the first and most marvellous of the seven extra
ordinary possessions of a universal emperor. In the Thibetan version, as well as by Southern Buddhists, this chakra or disc is
regarded as a quoit-like " weapon," but also at the same time as the glorious Wheel of the Law, which, being set in motion by the Emperor, rolls before him and establishes the law in his wide
dominions. But the name of the universal emperor, Chakra-vartin, clearly shows him to be a Wheel-god ; and it is expressly stated that he rules not only over this Earth but over the other three
kindred earths described in cosmogony. [It seems as if this Wheel-god, this Universe-Emperor, this chakravartin, showed himself again in the Greek inscription found in the Mosque of Light in the ancient Emesa (now Horus) of the
black stone of Elagabalus. Dr. H. Hayman's version of it was " The King, who is the round image of the Universe, won over the
peoples having all things by driving a chariot with skill." The
inscription as given by Waddington is :

In the Zoid Avesta, Gaya Maretan, the first man, that is
Man-god, "first took the turning of the wheel from the hands of the Daeva" (ii, 201). M. James Darmester remarks on this that the wheel meant is that of sovereignty, and that "the
expression smacks of Buddhism.." It is doubtless the same Universe-wheel as has descended almost as a nominis umbra to Buddhism, and it is also the same wheel as is given to Mithra
in another passage of the Avesta (ii, 136) where the god "drives

along on his lofty-wheeled chariot, made of an invisible substance, . . . accompanied by the wheel of sovereignty, and rolling upon it." I see no reason to accept Mithra for a sun-god in this passage, but rather as the heavens-god " who goes over the
Earth, all her breadth over, after the setting of the sun" {Z.A.
ii, 143)Professor Rhys Davids says •} The cakra, Pali cakka, is no ordinary wheel ; it is the sign of dominion ; and a cakravarti is he who makes the wheels of his chariot roll unopposed over all the world, a universal monarch. The title given to the first
Buddhist sermon, the rolling onward of the royal chariot-wheel of righteousness, Dharmacakra Pravartana Sutra, may be derived from, or it may be the origin of, the chakrawarti parallel. The Moslem dervish suspends a cherkha, or circle from his neck, meaning thereby that he resigns himself entirely to the will of God, for blessing or for punishment.Speaking of the " Rail" at Buddh Gaya, Fergusson calls it " the most ancient sculptured monument in India," and states that "its
religion, as might be expected, is principally tree and serpent worship, mingled with veneration for dagobas, wheels, and Buddhist emblems."^ I have elsewhere claimed the dagoba as a symbol of the heavens-vault (p. 220). The toran or gateway of the Bharhut tope had for its " central emblem on the top of all " the chakra or wheel {ibid. 87), which is an exact parallel to the position of the (winged) sphere on the
Egyptian pylon. On the torans at Sanchi " the worship of trees
is represented at least y^ times ; of dagobas or relic shrines 38 times ; of the chakra or wheel, the emblem of dharma, the Law, 10 times" {ibid. 97). On a "Rail" at Amravati is "in the central compartment the chakra or wheel, now generally acknowledged to be the emblem of dharma, the second member of the
Buddhist trinity." " Below that the tree " he continues ; but
I shall not pursue him into the speculation that it "possibly represents Sanga, or the congregation" (p. 102). Of course, what all the sacred trees and plants represent is the cosmic Universe-tree, as so often retraced in this Inquiry,

642 The Night of the Gods. [Buddha s
Here is the wheel, on a pillar, on a rough unhewn stone altar,
taken from the carvings at Buddh Gaya. I have elsewhere, I trust abundantly, shown that the wheel is pre-Buddhic, and that its connection with the Buddhist dharma is to be understood as meaning that that dharma is the Law of the revolving Universe and
of its revolver, of which the wheel is an emblem. Daniell describing the cave at Karli says, "on the
pillars, above the capital, is a group of lions from the centre of which a few years since rose the chacra of Vichnou though not the least appearance of it at present remains." "The Chacra of Vichnou the Mahadeva, and the bulls, seem not to favour the opinion of its being a temple of the Bhoods " [Buddhists]. Following this indication, Fergusson^ agreed that the pillar of four lions
(at Karli) supported a chakra, " or Buddhist wheel." As elsewhere shown, I see no reason for making very archaic examples " Buddhist " in origin. This Buddhist preoccupation of Fergusson's mind led him to say of "Cave No. 17" at Ajunta that it "is generally known as the Zodiac cave, from the figure of a Buddhist
chakra or wheel painted at one end of its verandah, which was
mistaken by early visitors for a celestial emblem."- If the theories here set forth by me are urged to any purpose, it may be thought that the mistake was not on the part of the "early visitors." The tower of the temple of Jagannath, figured by Fergusson from a photograph (p. 431), carries where we put weather-cocks
a vertical wheel exactly like the steering wheel, with projecting
spokes, of a ship. He puts a similar wheel to his own restoration of the Black Pagoda at Kanaruk (p. 222). In each case the vertical wheel is traversed by an upright
pole carrying a flag. Appended is a sketch of the wheel and staff on the Black Pagoda, as to which I will add that the Tibetan Lamas are fond of everywhere putting up "Trees of the Law," which are
nothing but lofty flagstaffs with silk flags, emblazoned
with the formula Om mani padme hdm. Every fie.sh flirt given to the flag by the winds is a new mantra of praise.^ It is almost needless for me to point out how we have here brought together the Universe-tree, the Universe-wheel, and the Universe-axis.

Footprint?\ The Cliakra as Wheel of the Law. 64.
Another paraphrastic fantasia upon the conception of the Wheel of the Law is that all existence of which we have any notion is but part of an endless chain or circle of causes and effects ; that so long as we remain in that Wheel there is no repose and no peace ; and that rest can only be obtained by escaping from that Wheel into Nirvana. The twelve nidanas, or cause-andeffects, are the twelve constituent parts of the Wheel ; ignorance
and desire are the axle of the wheel, which has predisposition, samskara for its spokes, and decrepitude and death for its tire.' Thus, too, in the Dai-mu-ryo-jyu Kyo, a sutra of the Japanese
Buddhist Shin-Shiu sect, to attain salvation or nirvana is " to
remain in the state of not returning to revolve (avaivartika), and
to enter the company of the steadfast ;
"- that is, of the non-revolv
ing, of the fixed, the steady.
Now it seems to me that we can get back to no other startingpoint for all this wheel-symbolism and imagery than the (apparent) revolution of the heavens, which gives Law to the Universe, to the unresting whirling Universe in which we live, move, and have our being ; and in which the decay and renewal of things is perpetually
and everlastingly repeated. To escape from this never-ending whirl is the life-idea of the Bud
dhist — is the dream confined to the Buddhist? to have done with it, to get out of the Wheel, de s'echapper de I'engrenage, to obtain refuge at the mathematical point which is the motionless centre of its
Nave ! —this is Nirvana.

design in the Codex Pighianus of Berlin, which I venture to copy from M. H. Gaidoz's valuable Dieu Gaidois du Soled, p. 48 (see
also the remark at p. 34).
An observation of De Rouge's about the tet^ u of Ptah, which
I seek to identify with the Universe-axis, here finds its proper place,
" In the hieroglyphs the tat designates stability by the summit (faite), and probably the pleroma, that is to say the final and perfect end which the soul ought to attain by the imitation of
Osiris.""
A
friend, whether in half-joke or whole-earnest I do not inquire,
here suggests that the mad desire to reach the north pole of this
planet may be a survival of the belief that it is a motionless spot
partaking of the nature of nirvana. [There is, however, a curious curse pronounced in the Rig Veda
(iii, 304) against " the man who invites the Rakshasas to the food
of the gods " or who reviles a priest : the Maruts are prayed_to
" send him into darkness de void of wlieels/^I But I have still more directly to expound the fact of the
chakra being on the soles of Buddha's feet. The emblem is either, as we have seen, the only or the chief emblem in the footprints. In either case it is central and imposing, in the very middle of the sole of the foot. Admitting the explanations I have been
endeavouring to develop, would we not thus (see also p. 626) have Buddha as the central supreme power of the Universe, presiding
at, standing on or above its wheel, on, at, or above the nave of its
wheel, trampling the world under his feet ; or else from place to place leaving behind him those marks of his footsteps which,
rightly interpreted, are but cryptic emblems of the whole of his
Creation.
As to the form of the chakra on the Siamese footprint, as to which I have already said so much, I think there need be no
hesitation in admitting that it implies rapid revolution on its centre. I here give a rough sketch of it, merely indicating, as
needless for the present purpose, its elaborate and minute ornamentation. An identical symbol is seen on the shield of Athene Polias (which I maintain to be the title of a Polar divinity)

on an amphora in the Berlin Museum (catalogue, No. 1686). The
goddess is standing, and menacing with a spear.^ I do not see how the connection of the revolving Universe-wheel with the adjectival name
Polias is here to be denied. The curvature
of the conventional spokes appears to
indicate a spinning round ; if not, I am at
a loss to attribute any other signification
to it. Among the multiplicity of ornam.ents or symbols on the "whorls" dug up at Troy and figured in Dr. Schliemann's Ilios (1880} are many either rude in the extreme, or occasionally, exhibiting some amount of regularity. Among the latter are Nos.
1833 and 1837, which I here outline. It is scarcely possible to compare these whorls with the Siamese chakra above without coming to the same conclu
sion that the deflected rays were meant to imply revolution, which would be quite natural in spinning
whorls ; but I hope in addition to prove, in the chapters on the Suastika and Weaving, an intimate and widespread connection between Spinning and the Universe with its wheel. Among the more obvious of the ruder examples of the revolving-wheel decoration are

cotta ball. I shall have more to say about this. 230 is off a vase. There are some whorls still, in which the intention of the whorlscratcher is not so well expressed ; and that intention can now only
be inferred by comparison with the others. Such are Nos. 1834, 1842, 1853, and 195 1, with which I do not trouble the reader. I cannot embrace the theory {Ilios, p. 413) that No. 484 is either a
cuttle-fish or a tortoise ; Dr. Schliemann is no doubt correct in

are in point,
directions in
saying (p. 417) that " in the pattern 1862 we see the sign y-| , the
reversed suastika, repeated ; only its branches are here curved, and
the centre of this curious cross is occupied by a circle with a point." The suastika is, " to the best of my belief" (see the chapter on the subject), a symbol of the revolution of the Universe, and embraces
also the indication of the four cardinal points. There is, however, a straight-rayed chakra on other footprints. Such is that from the Amaravati Tope already here mentioned, and figured by Mr. James Fergusson. It is repeated in Ilios (p. 349) and here follows a
rough sketch of that particular chakra. There is
no lack of corresponding markings on the Trojan
whorls. Nos. 18 17, 18 18, 1820, and 1995 in Itios and exhibit at the same time the four cardinal an unmistakable manner. Nos. 1824, 1829, 1831 and 1835 are equally clear examples ; and so are 1 82 1 and 1828, which resemble each other, and 1 84 1 , which shows another variety of pattern. The
following sketch of 1835 sufficiently indicates the
design on that whorl. No. 1991, already given, seems to combine both the straight and the curved rays. Of course, the black spots in the centres of the whorls denote the hole through which passed the spindle-stick, when the whorls were used as weights to aid in effecting the spinning. I shall just add here a quite different type of
wheel, taken from a terra-cotta ball, not a Vv'horl,
found at Hissarlik. Here is the wheel of an ox-cart from a Thracian
coin of the fifth century B.C., believed to be the
earliest representation of an Aryan wheel nowextant.^ Solid wooden waggon wheels are still in Portugal in which the two wheels are worked,
with the axle attached, out of one straight log of a tree,
in one piece, the centre part being hewn away." [It is worth while referring to what is given in the
Appendix (p. f) regarding the brontia and the " Serpent's-egg."

Van Boot/ writing of the Serpent-stone, which the Bohemians called Duchanek, and held in such great esteem for its magic powers, said it was nothing but the spinning-weight (peson) used by women
on their spindle, in order the better to make the thread twist, and to
prolong its twirling. " I recollect thirty-six years ago," he says,
" when I lived as a child in Flanders, to have seen with the women

The Suastika.
THE late justly celebrated Dr. Schliemann arrived at the
conclusion that all the many thousands of Whorls gathered by him at Hissarlik in the course of years had served as votive offering's. This verdict was strongly supported by Mr. H. Rivett
Carnac, who wrote upon the many similar " clay discs called spindle-whorls " found at Sankisa and at other Buddhist ruins in the N.W. Provinces of India.^ The designs cut on many of the Indian whorls are identical with those of the Trojan examples. It is worth noting that Sankisa was already connected with a Buddha's footprint, and therefore presumably with the chakra, by Sung-yun 1500 years ago (p, 626). Similar whorls are possessed by the Pelew islanders of the Pacific ; they give them a supernatural origin, and use them as money of high value. Such whorls have
also been found in the Swiss lake-dwellings, with the spindle-stick still remaining fixed in them. Professor Sayce seems to concur in Dr. Schliemann's conclusion.- My theory is "the same, but
different."
I fancy that the populations that made and used these whorls in their manual domestic industry were profoundly penetrated by a very living belief in the connection between the spinning round of the whorl and the supremely adorable revolution of the heavens. Their devotional feelings would have been akin to those which we see surviving in such vigour at the present day among the Tartar and Thibetan Buddhists and Lamas, where
everyone is ever and always turning a praise-wheel, or cylinder, or barrel, or some other similar machine, to gain m.erit and perform worship. Hand-toys of this kind are the very commonest of objects. One pictures the spinners of those far-gone days as
happy in the simple faith that they too gained merit by the twirling of the whorl rather than by the busy labour of their fingers ; and that they would by no means have held with Mrs. Browning's " Get work, get work ; 'tis better than what }-ou work to get." From this point of view it is easy to attribute the symbols on the

whorls to a sacred origin, and to bracket them with the now cryptic formula of the praise-wheel : om mani padme hum. The symbolism of many of the whorls, as I have shown in the chapter on the " Footprint," has reference to the revolving Universe-wheel, and T must now exhibit specimens of another class which clearly adopt the Suastika, an emblem which I have already sought to identify (p. 646) with the same great turnabout. The seven
following designs represent whorls on which the suastika y~| or
some resemblant scratch appears ; they are all taken from Dr. Schliemann's Ilios. There are many more, either similar (with
a difference^ or else much more rude. I have pointed out
and endeavoured to account for the reversed suastika rT~ by a
reference to the southern hemisphere, the underworld of the infernal powers (p. 670). Whether the arguments will have convinced other students of the subject I cannot say, but the Trojan whorls supply a great number of examples of what I venture to call the more evil emblem. The following outlines

The double end to one of the four points of the emblem, which occurs twice on each of the whorls numbered 1872 and 191 1, can scarcely be accidental or a mere slip of the hand ; but one must be slow to build upon this, because the incisions or scratches are very rude, and also because examples of a mixed emblem, half
right and half reversed, are common. Whether this —and even
whether the total reversal was due to ignorance, carelessness, or
design, who shall now say ; but supposing it to be due to design,
we may perhaps see in this variety of the suastika (if I may loosely employ a now convenient term) a combination of the supernal
and infernal emblems : or, again —-for it is well-known that the
reversed suastika was used as a female symbol— an epicene emblem embracing the male and female duality of most of the primeval cosmogonies.^ I now insert some drawings of this mixed symbol, all again taken from Dr. Schliemann's wonderful Ilios (1880) :

It will be seen that 1871 shows what must be meant for the right suastika, in rude but cursive form, four times over; that there are also four crosses, which I take to be a simpler form of the four

the divisions of the globe on p. 162, and resembles the figures on
these whorls. This curved cross or suastika must thus, I incline
to say, represent the cardinal division of the sphere, and the curvature may be simply spherical ; or, do they represent four ivings ? Not alone that, but may not the angular suastika be a merely stiffened, conventional development of the curved .symbol ?
But upon this again see " The Palace." To these is appended a corresponding example from the Buddha footprints at Amaravati. It is taken from one heel (the

discernible on this pair of footprints, only the one given here is reversed. But by far the most miscellaneous assortment of these mixed emblems is to be found
on the central, the equatorial, band of a terra-cotta
ball No. 245 {Ilios, p. 349). I here reproduce the band, and shall perhaps have something to say regarding the ball later on.

The etymology of the word suastika is, it is suggested, as
follows. The syllable su is the same as in the excellent, j-//perior,
5//pernal mountain j-zz-lMeru, to which is opposed the evil, infernal
m.ountain Ku-Meru (p. f) ; e^s is the verb to be, to live ; and
titli, fire, it is timidly suggested, also appears in the term. Simi
farl}', one concludes that the T/Vans were fire-gods, not Sun-gods which would make them central deities, and so connect them
with their central Kronos (p. f). If a possible fire origin for the term su-astika could thus be conceded, etymologically, it can I think
be supported b\- other evidence. Ad. Kiihn in Die Herabkuvft des Feuers says it represents rhe wooden
apparatus for the production of fire men
tioned so often in the \"edic hymns ; suggesting that the elbows at the points
I
q" '^ were for nailing it down, while the end of

another stick, the pramantha, was twirled
with a cord in the central cavity until fire was produced. Emile Burnouf concurred in this.^ So much has already been said upon
the nave of the wheel in connection with the production of fire that it need be only here remarked that Kiihn's theory is, although partial, not inconsistent with what is here advanced. The drawing of the Hindu suastika (which it will be seen is reversed) is taken from M. Gustave Dumoutier's excellent paper in the Revue
iVEtlinograpJiie, 1885. The root mat, to whirl [iiiatli, to churn) seems to betray itself in pramantha ; and of course the same pramantha is said b}' some to ha\e been the origin of the myth of

Prometheus ; and J/^t/arishvan also brought fire from heaven for Manu. I should also wish to mention the theory of Mr. R. P. Greg,
who has devoted much time to the subject. He argues that the right and the reversed s}'mbols are identical, and that they were the emblem of the supreme Aryan god, Dyaus or Zeus, originally the Bright Sky god, who came more especially to mean the god of both sky and air, and the controller of rain, wind, and lightning

as in Jupiter tonans and Jupiter pluvius. Later the symbol belonged to Indra, the rain-god in India (still according to Mr.
Greg)"; to Thor or Donnar among the early Scandinavians and Teutons; and to Perrun or Perkun among the Slavs {Troja, p. 124). The distinguished Scandinavian scholar and antiquary Mr. George Stephens has figured and described in his Old Northern Runic Monuments a Viking's runic sword, found in a barrow in
1825, on which the suastika M-i vvas employed as a phonetic for
Thur (/.t'. Thor) in the sword-owner's name Thurmuth. The sign, he says, is " also found on early Christian monuments for the
divine Lord in the new creed, Christus. Just so we write Xmas but pronounce Christmas."^ This is an extremely interesting observation. Agincourt in his Histoire de TArt par les Monuments gives a suastika from a granite slab in the catacombs.
Far be it from me to go counter to these theories. As the reader of these pages will have seen, I go even farther back ; referring the suastika to the wheel, and the wheel to the supreme
heavens-deity who controlled the revolution at the polar centre of motion. Of course this wheel-origin does not exclude, but really coincides with the simple four-spoked " rose " formed by the N. and S. line as it crosses the E. and W. line. The palace too
(if that be one of the significant allusions in the suastika) revolves like and with the infinite Universe-wheel (see p. 584). In the"Hittite" rock-sculptures near Ibreez or Ivris in the territory of ancient Lykaoniathe garment of a priest is ornamented with the suastika. It is found times without number on the prehistoric pottery of Cyprus and the Trojan plain, writes Professor Sayce,- " but no trace of it has ever yet been found on anything

very swe-v-ping. It has been discovered, says Captain Conder, on the rocks of Rumbold's Mow, among mediaeval mason's-marks, and is now a caste-mark among the Hindu worshippers of Vishnu. It has also
been found on Assyrian bas-reliefs, and in Attica {Heth and
Moab, 228). After all that has been said here upon the subject of Chinese
astrology, no surprise need be felt at finding the emblem in the
Chinese celestial sphere. It
/9z
is called Pa-kui, the eight
chiefs ; and consists of eight
stars, besides a central one, as shown in the drawing.
These stars are a, e, /m, and
three others stars of Phcenix,
«
*/^
with xxiii, 192 and 259 of Piazzi's catalogue, and another star in the southern Pisces. The Mongols call it the eight demons that
preside over brigands ; and perhaps they are right, for it is a
southern, that is an infernal, constellation, and the figure it gives is
the reversed suastika. This, too, is the form of the archaic
Chinese character f\^ now otherwise written (^ Wan), which
meant a hive of bees with their queen. Reference is begged to
what is said about bees, p. t ; and also the number 10,000 (p. f). The Chinese name for the suastika which is marked upon the breast oi Buddha is Wan-tsze, the 10,000 character, from which the Sinico-Japanese Man-ji is a corruption, and it has been already
pointed out that the Japanese Man-ji or " 10,000 sign" ought
perhaps to be rendered the All (p. 538); but that sign is what we
have been calling the "right" suastika j-J^ . It may perhaps
some day turn out that, after all both have often been indis
criminately used, and that it is, as above hinted (p. 652), now difficult enough to reclassify all the various ramifications of the
sign. Be this as it may, the (reversed) suastika is said to survive
in the 24th Chinese radical, sheh -)- . T\\<i Shuo [F^;/, as cited by
M. Gustave Dumoutier,' says that the horizontal line is East and West, the upright line North and South ; and that thus the four

quarters of the world and its centre, that is to say, the entire
universe, is included in the sign. Liu sheh, a literati of the
seventeenth century who became a Christian, said that on ancient
vases the same sign was employed in place of the three, or four, characters which mean the origin of vegetable life, the renewal of
all things, and that which perpetuates itself (Ts'ai Y , Kia ^ , and
Tsai ^ or Ts'un ^). Thus, said Liu sheh, the character sheh J
comprises all these things : the origin, existence and perp2tuity,
or infinite renewal, of life.^ Here is inserted the Japanese Manji, as it appears in the cognisance of the Hachisuka family, copied from an excellent paper on " Japanese Heraldry " in the Transactio)is of the Asiatic
Society of Japan (v. i), by Mr. T. R. H. McClatchie, and this is what he says about it " The Manji badge of Awa is curious.
This figure is drawn thus pj2_ - a'ld some
times, but less frequently, thus M-i . It is
taken from a Chinese character meaning 10,000, and is a Buddhist symbol supposed
to be emblematical of good luck. It is frequently to be seen on Buddhist temples as a sign of Fudo Sama, the motionless Buddha. It was often marked upon the lids of coffins, to act as a charm against the attacks of a demon. An exact fac-simile of this figure
is also to be met with in European heraldry, but it is a very rare " charge." It is there termed a Fylfot, but nothing is known as to its origin ; the only description given in heraldic works being
that it is supposed to have been a mystic symbol.
I would venture to suggest that in the suastika's Japanese
name Manji, the i/.-r/z-sign, the word man should not be rendered " 10,000." " The All," Pan, the Universe, would be better equiva
lents. Man, ^ or 7/ means " myriad " and " all," as well as 1 0,000. Here is given Mr. McClatchie's drawing of the Fylfot, adding
two others from Mr. Charles Boutell's English Heraldry (1879; which describes the Fylfot as

Are we here, at last^
this fylfot ? In Le Grand
d'Aussy's well-known Vie Privce des Francais^ I have met with
the curious remark that the different parts of wind-mills, so
frequently found in old heraldry, were brought by the crusaders from Asia, where windmills were invented. His editor, De Roquefort, repeatedly searched the Armorial General and other heraldic books without, he strangely affirms, ever finding trace of such a heraldic sign. Le Grand d'Aussy must, however, have referred to
the fylfot ; and also to the anile or fer de moulin, ferrum molendinare,- which appears in English heraldry as the " fer-de-moline "
or mill-rind, the iron grip of the eye or central hole of a mill
stone.'' Mr. C. Boutell makes this emblem a modification of the Cross-Moline, which is properly the croix anillee or crux Molen

dinaris. It resembles the cross borne b}' the Melin family; and may clearly come from the cosmic symbolism of the great Universe-mill. The crux Molendinaris may establish a connection between the arms of a windmill and the suastika.

twirled by the breeze in gardens, not a bird-scarer but a lucky engine and charm against the evil eye. Much symbolism still remains to be explained from the Mill idea, as in the water-wheel, for example. As regards what Mr. McCIatchie says about good luck, there can be no doubt whatever that the suastika or manji, or fylfot, or whatever we choose to call it, was freely and universally used as a
talisman. Its use on seals is clearly of this nature. It occurs,
reversed, on a slightly-baked clay seal found at Hissarlik (No. 496
Ilios,^^. 414, 415), with the arms curved round into spirals, somewhat like No. 1868 above drawn ; and seven terra-cotta seals have been found at Pilim in Hungary with either the right or the reversed sign ; one of these seals even shows two of each {Ftios, p. 562). It is found on the chest of the horse in a Cypriot terra
cotta equestrian statuette in the Louvre, just in the position in which the Moslem horsemen now suspend the crescent as an
amulet.^ Wuttke in his Deiitscher Aberglatibc (p. 268) says that in
Oldenburg a Wheel is put on the gable, or else near the door, to protect a house from bewitching. MM. Jourdain and Duval, writing of the " symbolic wheels " of the cathedrals of Amiens and
Beauvais,- attribute the origin of the rose windows which began to appear in the gables of Gothic cathedrals in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries to nothing else but the lucky wheel, the wheel of Fortune. These last two points, as well as many others on the subject of the Wheel, are taken from M. Henri Gaidoz's able and
attractive Dicu Gaiilois dn Soleil {I'^'^G).

It is stated in UWie's Buddha and Early BuddJiisvi (pp. 7, 9, 22, 227) that the suastika is seen in old Buddhist zodiacs, and is one
of the symbols in the Asoka inscriptions ; that it is the sacred mark of the Jains, and that Vishnu-worshippers have the same
sacred sign. He adds that it occurs also in the early Christian catacombs. It has likewise been pointed out that as the old Hebrew letter
tan it was marked as the sign of life on the forehead in Ezekiel's vision (ix, 4, 6). I have found an ancient form of this Hebrew fi^mmm letter in the Thresor of Claude Duret (1619) p. 124,
n^* which I here insert. Origen in his Homily In diversos, V# and St. Jerome, on Ezekiel, say that the tan of their days
had the form of a cross. (Duret, p. 316). Professor Max Muller mentions some important facts on the subject of this suastika emblem, among others :
It occurs often at the beginning of Buddhist inscriptions, on Buddhist coins, and in Buddhist manuscripts. It always means an. auspicious sign. In the footprints of Buddha the Buddhists
recognise 65 auspicious signs, the first of them being the svastika. [This is taken from Eugene Burnouf's Le Loins de la Bonne Lot, p. 625 ; but although the suastika may be considered the first of the minor signs, the great central Wheel, as shown
above, is undoubtedly the main great sign of t.he footprints.
J. O'N.] The fourth is the sanvastika, r-j-', the third the nandya
varta, a mere development of the svastika. [I wonder whether the nandyavarta can be a sort of labyrinth of the " paths " leading to
the holy centre typified by the middle of the
suastika. J. O'N.] Among the Jainas the svastika was the sign of their 7th jina, suparsva ; and the 7th of the twenty-four Jaina Tirthankaras is also marked by the svastika. Some sthupas are said to have been
built on the plan of a svastika, and the outline of certain buildings called svastika and nandyavarta does not correspond very exactly
with the form of those signs, {llios, p. 346 ct scq) I confess I have not been able to satisfy myself as to the

Moor in his Hindil Pantheon (plate 2) gave these, to which he

The Labyrinth.
THE current derivation of labyrinth is unsatisfying, if not
eccentric : " Put for \aFupiv6o<i ; from XaFpa, usually Xavpa, a lane, alley, Homer, Od. xxii, 128." This does not deal with the
termination -pivOo'^, nor does it get us very far with the word Xd^ipo<i a pitfall, or labrum, "poetically [i.e. mythologically ?] a
ditch with a raised bank of earth : IMoeniaque in valli formam
circumdata labro (Ausonius, Be Clar. Urbib. v, 9)." This word the dictionaries chose to make, came from lambo, to lap (!) ; but labrum (with a differing quantity) a vat or bath, they brought from lavo, to wash (!). Of course the words are identical, and as for the
quantity, nous nous en fichons,
Liddell and Scott says \d^pv<; is a Lydian word and = TreXe/cu?
(citing Plut. ii, 302A), which was an axe for felling trees, with two edges ; also a sacrificial axe and an executioner's axe : but not a battle-axe proper. These meanings apply of course to TreXe/cvi, which Mr. Wharton in his Etynia GrcEca puts to the old-Irish lee stone ; which oddly enough brings us back again to the stone
weapon. There are a number of mythic names in Lab- which a priori ouo-ht to be connected. Such are Labda, Labdakos, Labrados,
Labros, Labes, and others. Labdakos (grandson of Kadmos) was father of Laios, and they were both kings of the heavens {id. quod Thebes). Labdacidae were particularly famous in ancient story, wrote Dr. Leonard Schmitz, on account of the misfortunes of all of them (Sophocles,
Antigone, 560; Stat. Theb. vi, 451). That is, according to the
theories here urged, they were all fallen supernal gods. Labda was the daughter of Amphion, who was also a king of the heavens, and a son of Zeus. Amphion (which it is elsewhere suggested means Dual-Being) is a supreme god of Universeharmony (a doublet of Orpheus, who was also turned to Rock),
dominates the brute creation with his lyre, and by his harmony builds up the firmament, that is charms the stones into stacking
themselves without other aid to form the walls of Thebes. In the myth of Labda (Herod, v, 59, 92 ; i, 14, 20, 23), her infant Ku^/reXo?,

Laws. —The clue to the meaning of Ldios is afforded unwittingly by Herodotus (v, 92), where he says that 'Her/oy
was the son of 'E;^e«:/5aT7;9 of the tribe of Petra (the Rock) but whose ancestors were AairiOai. The Lapithai were of Olympus, that is of the heavens, and fought the Centaurs in a war-in-heaven. As
to Lapithes we have certainly XdiraOo'? and \d7rad0v
a trench, which may run parallel to Xa/3i/309 the pit
fall ; but it seems to me that with the clue of irerpa,
and the fact that Laios can come from T^a'i, a stone-pillar, we must detect in Lapithes (the Latin) lapis a stone, which persisted
in the Greek as Xd-a^ and (tt and all) as XeTra? a bare rock, clifif,
or scaur. The Lapithai were thus clearly stone-deities ; and Laios would be the god of the stone-pillar, king of the heavens. When the ten Bacchiades, too, set out to kill Kupselos, they arrive in the canton of The Rock, trerpa, and enter the house of Eetion. Laas, too, say Liddell and Scott, is used " especially of stones
thrown by warriors " ; which completely suits the idea of a
god's missile hurled and falling to Earth. It was also applied to the (heavens-)stone of Sisyphus. The " original form," say Liddell and Scott, however, "wasXafa9; and a connection with X/^09 and lapis seems impossible." But then, I ask, how about
Xe7ra9 ? Lapithes was son of Apollon, brother of Kentauros, and father of Phorbas, Triopas, and Pen'phas. The Lapithai were governed by Pein'thoos (whose myth wants studying) the son of Ixion and half-brother of Kentauros. We are here clearly among none but supreme heavens-gods of the stone, central, triad, wheel, and circle
categories. Labrados is the brother of Ataburis ; and both are connected closely with Zeus. It would here take us too far to follow-up (Zeus) Ataburios, Labradeos, Labrandeos, &c., which seem to be
fusions of other gods in assimilating, syncretic Zeus. As Labradeos
he held a hatchet (of stone, of course, see p. 112) instead of lightning
or the sceptre. This hatchet seems to have been called Xd/3pv<;, which must
mean falleti from heaven —a meteorite in fact, a stone-weapon of
the gods.^~~~^
VOL. II. G



664 The Night of the Gods. [^Buddha s
This \d^pv<; is taken from a ridiculous book, Noel's Diction7iaire
historique et etyniologique des Novis Grecset Roviains {\%o6 ; p. 195). He hardly ever cites a source ; but says that Arsalis, king of Caria, conqueror of Kandaules, king of the Lydians, brought back
the battle-axe of the kings of Lydia which was called labrys whence Zeus was called Labradeos in Caria. In his Dictionnaire
de la Fable (1803) the word labrys is not given, but he records that the hatchet belonged to Herakles, who gave it to Omphale, queen
of Lydia [of course, she is a central goddess at the omphalos tes ges] whence it passed through the line of the Lydian monarchs down to Kandaules, when it fell into the hands of the Carians, who armed their Zeus with it. Another account is that of ^Elianus, who says labradeus came
from the violent rains that fell at Labrada ; which is not wholly
absurd, for it retains the idea oifalling.
As to the usual derivation of labradeos from 'Kd/Spo^;, a glutton, it may reasonably be suggested that the taproot of the matter goes farther down. Labros, a dog of Actaion, runs in a couple with his other dog Argos. What if Argos were the dog of the upper (Northern) heavens, and Labras the dog of the infernal regions of the dead ? They would then go on all fours with the Egyptian " jackals " of the North and South (see Dogs, p. j). Labrados was a Carian god. The " gluttony " may be because of his being the god of the infernal regions, which are never sated with the dead, as he was never sated with human and other victims. The words labiros, pitfall ; and lapathos, the pit, would then fall into
their places ; and we should perhaps be driven to search for our
root in the rare and very classic, and therefore (perhaps) ancient word labes, " a fall," as in the fall of the rain from the heavens,
labes imbris e ccelo (Arnobius v, 185) ; an idea we have just had
otherwise. The root is " 7'ab or lab (= lap), to droop, hang-down,
slip, glide, fall" (Skeat : who cites Fick, 1,751 ; VaniCek, 791 ; and who, aptly enough for the present occasion, gives limbo for one
of the examples). The sense " droop, hang-down " accords very closely and strangely with the idea of the " inverted precinct " and the bent
mountain (pp. t and f). In the first —the inverted or infernal
mountain—we have a wholly different idea from the bent, that is the over-arched mountain of the upper heavens; but the

sense of drooping or hanging- down can be, and probably was, applied to both. And here one might say that the detection of the inner meaning of a myth very much resembles the guessing of a riddle, or rather of that archaic, primitive, childish form of the
riddle called the devinaille—a word that hides both the idea of hohness and guessing, of divine and divining. Labyrinth would thus be the many-chambered infernal regions ; and we should have a striking parallel in the Egyptian Amenti, where the sinuous path followed by the dead in their progress from death to resurrection is indicated by the loops of the serpent Mehen

the dead cultivate below in their progress towards resurrection.'^ Herodotus (ii, 148) says the Egyptian Labyrinth had twelve vaulted halls, and could be entered only subterraneously. This is almost decisive. All ancient labyrinths were described as wholly or partially underground. The Egyptian labyrinth was much earlier than Herodotus thought* The 3,000 (= 10 x 300) apartments or compartments of the labyrinth of Herodotus exhibit a curious accord with the myth of Cypselus, and the fact that half was North and half South, half under and half over-ground, is an
inevitable indication of the upper and under heavens. The stronghold of Oeth and Ann-oeth in Welsh myth is a huge

beehive-shaped prison, elaborate in numerous compartments both under and over ground. Its walls are wholly built of human bones,^ and it was built by Mana-wydhan, the enemy of Merlin. Majmm-\3.n is his Irish match, both are great gods ; and we may perhaps see Maine in both names. Herodotus (ii, 148) could not obtain admission to the real labyrinth, the underground portion, where they told him royal Pharaohs and holy crocodiles were interred. The Minotaur was
also interred in the Cretan underground labyrinth. Minos was son of (Zeus) Asterios and consort of Pasi-phae (All-shine). He was father of Ari-adne (who led The-seiis out of
the labyrinth and ascended into the heavens) ; of Phaidra {(^al- in all such names = brilliance) consort of Theseus ; of Androgeos ; and of Deukalion, a founder of the labyrinth, of which Dai'dalos is a builder. Have we in AaLSaXo^ and Aac-SaXa a couplet of central
stone- or dolmen-gods ? (Deus + dallan, dalle, etc., see p. 270.) Then we have Pasiphae as mother of Minotauros or ManBull, who was not (nor is he) hard to seek and find in Nineveh. Minotauros was shut up in the labyrinth, or by another account engulphed in a labrum (a "bath" as it is called) with the aid of Cocalus (compare Kcokut6<;). Minotauros was also a god of cannibalistic sacrifices. The Seven couples of youths and maidens immolated (and eaten) to him yearly, are nothing
but the celestial Seven (as dual entities) expounded in this
Inquiry, finding expression in the acme of supremest ritual. Cicero {Favi. xii, 25) splits Minotaurus into Calvisius and
Taurus. In that case Calvisius equals the "bald" heavens; just
as they are arid in p. f. The brazen cow which holds Pasiphae is no other than the metallic firmament which coincides with and contains the Allbrilliant heavens, for which the Cow is another most familiar Eastern symbol.
It is here humbly suggested that Book of Resurrection is as good a title as any for the Peremhru ; which would thus literally mean " Arising-as-the-Day " (arises). Champollion said, " Mani

from (or as) the Daj^ {Egypfs Place, v, 161 to 171). Theodule Deveria (upon whom be fame !) wrote Permharu and gave a sense for per-m of sortir en (a I'etat de) that is " issue as." Per means to
issue, to come-out, to appear, to come-up (as vegetation); and
therefore in permharu it may signify, it is submitted, to rise, as the heavenly bodies do (in the East) from the under-hemisphere.
(Th. Deveria: Catal. MSS. (i 881), 49; Pierret : Diet. 319; Vocab. 151.) The sense ^' go-owt fro7n the day," seems untrue and con
torted.
These infernal fields, this labyrinth, with the soul passing
through it to the resurrection of day, seem to me to furnish a better explanation of the game of Hop Scotch than that given at p. 6^6 as progress through the various heavens. The " game " may have been originally a meritorious work (like the adoration
wheel) for the aiding of the " souls in purgatory " in their upward progress. We should thus have the Egyptian Amenti as, in this point of view, a straight type of the Christian purgatory for the souls of the just ; while the Egyptian hell of torments^ equals the
Christian hell of the damned. As for the termination of Xa^vpivQo'^, it may be identical with
that of Koptv^o?, Corinth. Liddell and Scott suggest \xi)pivQo<i a
cord, and 'TdKtv$o<i, Hyacinth, who was killed accidentally by the
quoit or discus of Apollo. But after all, perhaps 7r\ivOo<;, " a brick or tile, a brick-shaped body, a plinth," is as good a word here, and
as handy, as any. And, just for record, it may be noted that labynnihos and Atabyr'xs have a resemblance. I would also here draw attention to the phrase Ato? KoptvOo'i which, according to Hesychius, was proverbially said of those who were always doing and saying the same things. This perpetual repetition is a primary note of the powers of the revolving
Universe. The shot that endeavours to bring down laburinthos from

Encore une etoile qui file
et disparait
Of course a fall implies a height to fall-from. Thus the fall of the stone may be as important in mythology as it is in gravitation, and may thus challenge comparison with either the Newtonian or
the Adamic fall of the apple. Another view of the "falling" may make it the "depending," the "down-hanging" half of the heavens. The labarum {Xd^apov) of Constantine must range itself in the same category of mythological words. Tt showed a crown or
wreath (that is the circle of the wheel) ; a cross (the pre-Christian) and a monogram, which came to be called by a violent wrench of interpretation, a symbol of the name of Christ. (Prudentius I)i Synnnach, i, 488. Niaph. H.E. vii, 37.) Liddell and Scott say Constantine " added Christian emblems " to it. There is another decidedly curious and interesting point that somewhat unexpectedly here comes to my aid. Zeus precipitated the /cu/cX-wTre? (or wheel-eyes) into Tartaros, but they killed KdfMTnj

their gaoleress, and escaped to the upper day. Another myth makes Kampe the female warder of the Titans ; and Zeus kills her because she would not let them out to help him. So that Kampe's
position in legend is well-established ; and I suggest, and draw
especial attention to the suggestion, that it is that name that gave us the Elysii campi ; and as Kd^iirr] means " a winding, a bending, a turn," it has nothing whatever to do with the Champs Elysees as fields, but only as the windings of the underworld, the Labyrinth in
fact, for which Ka/xirr] seems to be another, but lost, word. The
Greek 'HXvaiov irehiov certainly does not hint at Ka/xTrrj ; but the meanings " plain or field " for irehiov must be quite secondary ;
for example there is the river IleSaio? in Cyprus (which may be so called after the Trehiov of the underworld, and not because you can during most of the year foot its bed dry-shod). It is true that
irehov is the ground, but it is also true that irehr) is a foot-shackle ;
and TreSiov must be connected with the oblique cases of ttoO?, ttoSo'?,
Latin pes, pedis, in the sense, perhaps, of path, wanderings a-foot. The shepherd's crook was a pedum. The Greek analogue would thus be 7rdTo<i, a way trodden and worn ; and the root would be pat, to go. Thus 'RXvaiov vreStoi/ would be the Elysian (foot-worn)
path and x\o\. field. (I know not whether any connection could be established between Kampe and tlie Indian Champa, the capital of Anga, of which Kama was king. Champa was founded by Champa son of
Anu, son of Yayati.) It seems quite provable that 'EA-eua/^ and 'HXucrtoy are one and
the same. Mr. Aston directs my attention to the fact that "the Lower
Regions have in the old Japanese stories the epithet ya-kuma, that is eight windings or many windings."
I have, under the heading of "The Suastika," suggested that \X the nandyavarta may be the Labyrinth ; see the illustrations of the Nandyavarta there given. I know not whether my readers will find any con
firmation of this theory in a silver coin of the town of Knossos in Crete. The minotaur on the reverse is a bull-headed man kneeling on one knee, and
either casting a round stone or holding the Universe in the hollow of his hand. (From Barthelemy, in Guigniaut's Creuzcr, plate 212). Another labyrinth, also from a coin of the

same town, gives us a quite different conception. The word Yivwdiwv surrounds the design. " ChishuU :
Antiq. Asiat. p. 127" (same plate of
Guigniaut's work). Colebrooke figured the nandyavarta thus ; and Burnouf calls it also the nandavartaya and gives it sense as " the for
tunate involution (enroulement) or circle."
It is thus lucky, like the suastika and the tomoye. The Amara-Kosha, the oldest vocabulary known, makes it also the name of a particular sort of temple or sacred construction, and Burnouf says the nandyavarta of the Jains

Holmboe remarks* that a similar figure is well-known in Norway as a children's game, which he has heard called " Troy-town castle," Troyeborg Slot, which may be considered as equivalent to Asgaard Slot. This is bringing the labyrinth exceedingly near to the hop-Scotch diagram. " THE DORIC FRET." I here open a parenthesis, or an
interleaf—an Extrablatt as Jean Paul Richter used to call it—to indicate the connection between the heavens-palace and the meander or " Doric fret," which will again lead me on to the Indian nandya-varta as a symbol of the heavens-palace or Universebuilding ; to the Labyrinth as an exponent in brick and mortar of the same supernal (and infernal) idea ; and to the suastika as a
most universal emblem of the same import, but embracing also the
cross of the cardinal points. The Labyrinth and the Suastika have had sections to themselves

already, so mention is here made of them only incidentally, to the extent absolutely required by the context. I have purposely inserted the group of Egyptian hieroglyphs on p. 665 in order to train-on the Reader's eye to the present short
excursion. The Egyptian hieroglyph cr^i, whose syllabic value was per, was

full or reduced—of the wondrous impenetrable Universe-palace.
The likeness of the suastika r+J (which is the
Chinese and Japanese Manji) to the centre of the Nandya-varta is very clear, has often been remarked upon. I see, too, that M. Zmigrodzki (of Suchaj
Galicia) has suggested that if we put entire suastikas in a row, connecting them with lines, no matter how, or even take half or quarter suastikas ^ and do the same, we obtain the different forms of the Greek meander.^ Burnouf wrote nandya-varta-ya, and gave the sense of the holy term as " fortunate involution (enroulement)." It is thus lucky,
like the su-astika and the tomo-ye. The Amara-kosha, the oldest vocabulary known, makes it also the name of a particular sort
of temple or sacred construction, and Burnouf said further that the nandya-varta of the Jains might pass for a kind of Labyrinth.^ Professor F, Max Miiller, quoting Burnouf, says'' that the outline
of certain buildings called svastika and nandyavarta does not correspond very exactly with the form of those signs. Well, as for the matter of that, where are there any two sacred buildings, whatever, whose plans do correspond very exactly ? But here is
Burnouf—no mean authority—putting the Labyrinth to the
Nandya-varta, which is a sacred building as well as a sacred symbol. I first add briefly here that the Labyrinths of Nauplia are quarried tombs ; that the Catacombs are nothing else ; and that Pliny* made the remarkable statement that Labyrinths were laidout in pavements and gardens for the diversion of children, who in a narrow space thus took many thousand steps. But Pliny is too disdainful here : else why did the Christians perpetuate the custom
of decorating the floors of their basilicas with these Labyrinths, which, as Mabillon has shown in writing of the eleventh century," they considered symbolic of the temple of Jerusalem. But I go higher, to the heavenly Jerusalem. At the time of the Crusades, mimic pilgrimages were made in these Labyrinths by way of devotion by those who could not go to the Holy Land. Such was the custom in the cathedral of Rheims in the 13th century.

From all this I theorise that the processions in the Egyptian " hall of processions " supra were analogous devotional exercises ; that it is most likely that there was a " Labyrinth " in the pavement
of those halls or courts ; that the hieroglyphs of this type |^|
were an abbreviation of that Labyrinth, its picture in little ; and
that the same original signification must be given to the Meander. Although Pliny is charged above with running down the Labyrinth he might be sup
ported—but then it is 19
centuries after date from Mr. C. A. Holmboe'sbookon Norwegian
antiquities,^ where the
following figure is given of the children's " Troyeborg slot " or Troy-town castle (which I think may be viewed as equivalent to Asgaard slot, for I always want to make the mythic Troia a heavenly Trinidad.) This is a clear Labyrinth. I am not aware that all these symbols and proofs have been focussed before ; and the circuit being thus completed for the
first time I can only hope that—in the words of Virgil about the
dark paths of the Cretan Labyrinth—some indeprensus et
irremeabilis error has not led me wholly to grief by taking the wrong turn.

with reversed spiral, which also appears as one of the sacred emblems in the Siamese Buddha's footprint, seems to be connected with the holy revolution of the heavens. In Siam it is called
the chank-shell, and in the life of Buddha the thousand-eyed Indra, the heavens-god, marched before him blowing a great chank-shell 2,000 fathoms long. The Siamese royal Brahmin astrologers blow shrill sounds from these shells in state processions ; and a gilt and jewelled chank is among the royal insignia. In Hindu mythology the sacred sankha is borne by Vishnu, and was churned up from the sea of milk.^ The Indian conch-shell is sacredest when its
whorls, instead of coiling from right to left, as they ordinarily do,
follow the reverse direction from left to right, that is in the same
sense as the revolution of the heavens. A daksJimdvarta like this used to sell for its weight in gold, but now costs no more than four or five pounds sterling. Pouring sesam seed and water over the head from one of these right-handed sankhas destroys all the
sins of a whole life.

678 The Night of the Gods. [Buddhas
The Chakra as Weapon.
AS to the disc as a destroying weapon, Indra with his great
weapon chakra drives the evil Asura from heaven ; it is also the attribute of Vishnu, and " flying from the hand, and rapidly
revolving, utterly exterminates those against whom it is directed. As one of the insignia of Buddha, the Dharma-chakra, it would thus refer to the extermination of ignorance, misery, and sin." Mara, the evil one, hurled his chakra against Buddha, and though he could not injure him, his weapon clove the mountains in its course. *' Indra formerly stopped in battle the rapid chariot of Surya. Etasa has borne away the wheel (bharachchakram Etasah) and demolishes." {Rig. V. iii, 283). " Kutsa, thou hast swiftly destroyed the Dasyus, and thou hast cut them to pieces in the battle with the wheel of Surya." (iii, 148.) The destructive employment of the disk admits of another
view. It seems to me that it is made clearer to the mind if we
regard the Universe-wheel as the exponent of Time—of Kronog
thedevourer—of teinpiis edax reruni. The conception is central in Hinduism, where Vishnu, who as Siva is the producer and reproducer, becomes as Rudra the destroyer and dissolver. " Le Temps matte toutes choses," wrote Rabelais. We have clearly the sam^ idea in Greek mythology when
Apollo kills /f;/<'zcinthus (TaKcvOoi;) accidentally with a diskos, or
quoit. First-man K adrn os also puts the Boeotian Hj'antes to flight in a heavens-war. Ifya, besides being the Latin pronunciation of the Greek letter V, was also a name of Semele as Hyes ("T?/?) whether " rainy " or
otherwise, was of B acchus and Zeus ; the //y^cinthides, sacrificed to the Cyclops Gerestes (a word which implies old age) ; Hyas, son of Atlas and father of the Hyadts, who were otherwise daughters of first-man Kadmos, or of Atlas ; Hjagms the (Phrygian) inventor of harmony and first flute-player, who composed canticles for the Mother-goddess, Bacchus, Pan and company ; the Muses as Hyantldes ; Hyantms, grandson of Kadmos ; the hyperborean hyena (/y/^ina) ; all these and many more such demand study.

to be simply the brilliant starry heavens, father of Danae, was also accidentally killed by Perseus, son of Zeus and Danae, with a quoit. Akrisios was also changed into a stone. Perseus had a harpe from Hephaistos (like Kronos) the shoulder, and heel-wings of Hermes, rode the winged horse Pegasus, and encountered Atlas, changing him also into a stone, or into a mountain. (Has Perseus
any connection with irepQw, to devastate, as long maintained. If
so, he would be an evil god, with a strong likeness to a personage in the Apocalypse.) Danae was shut up in a tower and visited by Zeus in the form of golden water. All these are central supernal heavens-myths.
The hurling of the chakra is still frequent in Indian divine symbolism. The following are taken from Moor's Hindu Pantheon.
1. Here is Vishnu whirling the chakra on his
finger for a cast (plates 13,48), in propria
persona and in the man-tortoise and man
fish avatars. 2. As the boar-man he does the same (plate 48). 3. Krishna does the same with a more orna
mental object, and reminds us of the juggler
who still twirls a plate, a hat, and so forth,
with a short wand or the finger. (Plates
61,65.) 4. Vishnu, seated on Mounted Mandara while it is twirled, does the same, with the little finger of the left hand. (Plate 49.) 5. Indra does the same, using a short stick, which would answer to the Universe-axis (plate 79). One cannot but reflect that a Hindu who
even now sees the juggler's twirling-trick may attach to it a sacred significance unknown to us ; and that the much-exaggerated magic tree-trick has also a holy creation meaning for the native mind. That both were once very
holy may at all events be safely maintained.
Sir George Birdwood, out of the wealth of his Indian knowledge, has been good enough to furnish me with some information as to the chakra weapon, three or VOL. II. H

four of which are worn on the conical caps of the Sikh Akah or worshippers of the god Akal and may be seen in the Indian Museum (Armour : Punjab case). It is a perfectly
flat quoit having a cutting outer edge. It is used
by twirling its inner blunt edge round and round the middle finger of the right hand, and then after
it has acquired a certain momentum, letting it fly.
It is a circular flying knife, that flies with great
force but very uncertain aim, being quite a useless weapon in modern warfare. The dependence at any time placed in it, says Sir George Birdwood, was evidently due to its sacrosanct character as derived from the formidable fiery discus of Vishnu. Sir Monier Williams^ describes his visit at Patna to the temple of the tenth Guru Govind, rebuilt by Ranjit Sinh about fifty years ago. Over the gate are the first Nine Gurus, with Nanak in the
centre. The guardian of the shrine, which opens on one side (? aspect) had a high-peaked turban encircled by steel rings (cakra) used as weapons. He was evidently an Akali or " worshipper of the Timeless God," a particular class of Sikh zealots who put every opponent of their religion to the sword. As Sir M. Williams entered, accompanied by a Mussulman friend,
this Akali displayed great and hostile excitement ; but eventually
the interior of the shrine was seen, with "a number of sacred swords which appeared to be as much objects of worship as the sacred books." Here we clearly have the deification of the central
divine weapon—sword or lance—which this luquhy contrasts in
Japan, Scythia, and Greece. Sir Monier Williams, in making AksX mean the Timeless, clearly indicates a .connection with the Zoroastrian (Zervan) ^/^aran. It seems to be another great central god-name which we must put into the large category of divine words in Ak-, all perhaps to be referred, with axis and axle, to the root
ak or ag (Sanskrit aj\ to drive, urge, conduct.- Akal would thus be the Impeller of the Universe wheel, and the chakra-weapon would thus be the fit equipment of his fanatical worshippers. Perhaps we must connect the place-names Akhal (of the TekkeTurkomans), between Mero and the Persian frontier, and Akhalzikh and Akhal-kalaki, south of the Caucasus between Tiflis and

the Black Sea, with this god's name. Vambery says " the Turkish spoken by the Turkomans of Akhal differs but slightly from the dialect spoken in the Caucasus."^ ^Jack the Giant-Killer's sword of sharpness which he obtains from the huge and monstrous giant with three heads who could beat 500 men-in-armour, and who can hide in a large vault underground, may be a reminiscence of the divine chakra. Veleut (Wayland) the Smith in the Edda of Sremund forged a sword of sharpness which is called Balmung in the Wilkina saga.

Stone Weapons of the Gods.
AT p. t and p. f, we shall meet with the Japanese Mount Kagu
as a Cosmic and as a divine metal mountain. At p. 704 are mentioned the Japanese Kagura dances. At p. fthe etymology of the word Yamato is suggested. But I must now dwell somewhat longer upon the words kag7i and yaiiia, with the result perhaps of connecting some of the gods of Shinto witl'i the sacred mountain. Kagu-tsuchi is one name of the fire-god. This, according to the Japanese etymologists, may be either Kagu tsu chi, the Adorable of Kagu, or Kagu-tsuchi, the Kagu hammer or mallet, which would indicate a mountain thunder-god.^ If Kagu really means "shining" as suggested on p. t, then Kagu-tsuchi would be a shining weapon, a sort of Flaming Sword. Motowori's treatment of tsucJd in Kami-names is not convincing. He follows Mabuchi in taking it to be a cor
ruption of tsu iiioc/d ; but still thinks c/ii to be a mere honorific.
'' At the same time it is remarkable," writes me Dr. W. G. Aston," that most of the gods with this termination to their names have something to do with thunder; and with this the mallet or hammer
is an easy association of ideas. In a passage in the NiJiongi, tsuchi, in an enumeration of gods, is represented by the Chinese character for thunder." Kagutsuchi also produced the eight mountain-gods. When his father Izanagi clove him in three with his sword there were formed the triad of gods, Ika-dzuchi, great-hammer, god of thunder ; O Yama tsu mi, the August of the great (or old) mountain ; and Taka O Kami, the High great god, the god of rain, snow, and storms. There were two other deities, a male and female pair called Kana-yama, or Metal-mountain, produced at the same time as Kagutsuchi. For me, their names also have reference to the mythical Metal-mountain of heaven (p. 132), to Mount Kagu in fact ; and I further think that what has been said here about Kagu and Yamato (p. t) justifies me in suggesting that the names of the archaic Kagura and Yamato dances (see p. 704), connect them with the primeval polar mountainworship. The name of the third dance, Adzuma, I cannot account

for; the word occurs in the Kojiki with the sense of wife'; certain
temples are " reverently styled the three temples of Adzuma,"- and of the triad of gods there worshipped one is Take-rnika-dzuchi, Lofty-great-mallct, or the thunder-god, who appears to be no other than the Ika-dzuchi named above. As a dual god he pairs with another of the triad, Futsu-nushi, whose temple faces the North, and whose symbols are a two-edged sword and also a " stone bow." Futsu-nushi means the keen or sharp lord, or the crackling, snapping lord, according as fiitsu is taken. If Futsunushi was really worshipped as a sword" (of which perhaps it is superfluous caution to have any doubt) we have a striking and complete parallel to the Scythian Ares. In either case, the name and the epithets may clearly refer to the weapon of the thunder
god, and recall Shakespear's " thunder's crack " and " the fire and cracks of sulphurous roaring" in T/ie Tempest. Other names for
the deified weapon point in the same direction^ ; such are Sashifutsu, Thrust-and-crack ; Mikafutsu, great-crack ; Futsu no
mitama, spirit of cracking. Elsewhere the Kojiki represents , Takemi-Kadzuchi as the offspring of Ame no Wohabari, the Broadsword of heaven, with which Izanagi clove Kagutsuchi. The whole of the passages about the various swords and weapons of the early Japanese gods are still obscure ; and I can only indicate, without at present demonstrating, a connection with the other mystic swords, lances, and spears, met with in the present treatise ; to which, perhaps, might be added the club of Rama, the seventh incarnation of Vishnu. It would, however, much simplify matters if we could refer the whole question (as I think we safely may) to a remote Stone Age. The connection of the stone weapons, or " swords," the thunder-bolt, and the heaven-rocks would then be easy. Indeed
this seems to me to be the only possible solution of the difficult
passage in the Kojiki, where two of the gods carry on their backs
heavenly rock-quivers {iiva-yugi), that is, as I suggest, quivers for holding the thunder-stones ; at their sides " mallet-headed swords "
{jsHclii no taclii or tsutsiii no tac/ii) ; in their hands wooden bows,
and under their arms their arrows,"' which last is quite in accord

ance with the ancient Chinese practice, as shown for instance in
the Lt-Ki, where the Emperor carries the bow in one hand and the arrows under the opposite armpit.^ This theory seems to me to be borne out by another Kojiki passage {ut sup., p. 102), where a god comes to an encounter bearing on the tips of his fingers a rock which it would take a thousand men to hft ; and it throws quite a new hght on the " multitudinous rock-masses" in heaven, and on the names of such deities as Iwasaku, Rock-spHtter ; Iwatsutsu, Rock-mallet {ut sup., p. 32), and Iwa-tsuchi-biko, Rockhammer-prince (p. 25), and the first human Mikoto of Yamato,
who is also a Kami {i.e. Kamu) — Kamu- Yamato At'^re-biko. The name Iware is still preserved in that of a village in existing Yamato {Kojiki, p. 129). One of the warlike songs seems to mention such primitive weapons without any additional word which could mean " sword " (pp. 347, 142) ; and these last passages seem very strong evidence indeed in favour of this Stone Age hypothesis. To these must now be added what, admitting the premisses, appears to clench the argument. There is a constellation in the Chinese sphere called T'ien-tsiang, heaven-mallet (or
club). These mallets, i^, as well as hammers {ch'ui, ^f). were, according to the commentators, made of stone and of metal. Here we have the heavenly stone weapons actually perpetuated on
the Chinese celestial chart. It is important to add that the Taou Keen liih, a treatise on ancient Chinese swords written at the end of our fifth century, mentions swords of stone as well as of iron, copper, and gold.'^ The old Norse sax, the Old high-German sahs, and the AngloSaxon scax, a sword, are plainly related to the Latin saxum, a stone, and therefore indicate a descent of these sword-names from a time when they meant stone weapons. Saxanus is an epithet of Hercules in two inscriptions,"* and he is called by the identical name of lapidarius in another.^ And instead of meaning " of stone," these words must here have had the same signification
as lapidator, that is stone-thrower. In the Norse mythology aerolites and the tubes named fulgurites were, as elsewhere, taken to be thunder-bolts launched red-hot

in storms by Thor ; whose name, of course, is equal to tlionar, the Old German domir, and the Norman-French thure, thunder. The same word {Jiamar, &c.) meant stone and hammer in the GothoGermanic languages, and the hammer-weapon was of course thrown like a stone as well as swung ; in fact one of our muscular games to
this day is " throwing the hammer." Thus ccrolites were the hammers thrown by Thor, and his hammer was a projectile and not a sledge-hammer for mere hammering alone. And as the
thunderbolt shatters what it strikes, the hammer of Thor is called the Crusher or Miller, Miollnir. Like the sword of the Hindu Arjuna, the hero of the AlaJidbhamta, which strikes of its own motion without brandishing, the hammer of Thor also returns to the hand of the god after it is flung and has stricken. And as the hammer
was red-hot, Thor wore iron gauntlets.' Some passages from the Rig Veda on this subject may serve to supply some lights : Grasping his sharp thunderbolt with both hands, Indra whetted it to hurl it like the water ; he whetted it for the destruction of Ahi. Indra who art fully endowed with strength, with energy,
with might, thou cuttest to pieces as a woodcutter the trees of
a forest, thou cuttest them to pieces as if with a hatchet (ii, H). Endowed with increased vigour, Indra hurled the wheel of Surya (Suraschakram pravrihad), and deprived them of existence
(ii. 35)-' Indra, aided by the Angirasas, has whirled round his bolt, as Surya turns round his wheel (Suryo na chakram), and slain Bala.
(ii, 234). Indra, armed with the thunderbolt, crushed Rauhina when
scaling heaven (ii, 238J. Indra with the adamantine [weapon] demolished the hundred ancient cities of Sambara and cast down the hundred thousand of
Varchin (ii, 244). We catch from a distant quarter the sound of the stones [the thunder] whereby the performer of pious acts [the sacrificer for
rain] has secured the waters (;i, 62). Here we have the weapon as a thunderbolt in every case, and also as adamantine and as a heaven-stone ; it crushes, and it is
also sharp, and cuts like a hatchet, as the lightning hacks trees ;

it is besides whirled round like a wheel, and is even a wheel itself
hurled hy Indra. " Divine Twashtri " is further (7?z^ V. iii, 93. 483) "the able artificer, the dextrous-handed, the first divider, the well-handed"; and in hymning the thunder it is said (416) : " Fierce Indra, Twashtri made (for thee, the mighty One) the thousand-edged, the hundredangled thunderbolt, wherewith thou hast crushed the ambitious, audacious, loud-shouting Ahi." The monkeys of Rama threw stone weapons against their
enemies, and the thunderbolt of Indra {vajra, asaui) was a lithic
missile.^ The great Mexican deity Quetzalcoatl was the child of the god Citlalatonac and the goddess Cittaliene by an extraordinary
gestation. Cittaliene brought forth a flint dagger or tecpatl, which so alarmed her other sons that they flung the stone down from the height of heaven. It fell upon Chicomoztoc, the seven-caved
divine universe-mountain, and gave life to 600 gods and goddesses, of whom the principal were Quetzalcoatl and Tezcatlipoca.Another myth tells of a shower of stones which fell from heaven, and among them a large rounded one named techcatl {2,\\ox<\ which very much resembles tecpati) in the form of a block, which became the altar of human sacrifice.'' By yet another myth, Chimalma
the wife of Mixcoatl (cloud-serpent) finds a cJialdiiJinitl stone in sweeping, swallows it, and becomes miraculously pregnant of
Quetzalcoatl (feather-serpent.) The chalcJiihuitl is translated emerald : can it have been jade? Another version still makes the
god Citlai-latonac (refulgent star) shine in the Milky Way, and send a messenger to Chimalman, who is a virgin of Tulan, or paradise, to announce to her that she shall miraculously conceive
her son, Quetzalcoatl, to whom the invention of temples in the form of round towers is attributed.'* All the imagery here tends in
the direction of the supreme__slar, the heaven-river, the universeaxis, and the holy heaven-stones, with which wc have been concerned throughout this Liqniry.

Footprint. The Flaming Sivord. 687
The Flaming Sword.
HAVING mentioned (at p. 6'S2) the "flaming sword," I
ought now to say that a careful consideration of all the arguments advanced by Francois Lenormant leads me to go somewhat farther than it occurred to him to do ; and to claim that famous weapon too as the Chakra. The words that refer to it in Genesis form, as is well known,
a most obscure expression—lahat ha'hereb hammith —happesheth. The lahat ha'hereb is a distinct independent unique object. Endowed with a proper motion, it turns on itself, as is formally
indicated by the use of the reflective participle of hithpa'el. I (Lenormant) translate " la lame flamboyante du glaive qui tourne," in order not to diverge from the sense given to lahat in all versions
since the Scptuagint ; but this traditional sense, although philologi
cally very receptible, is not certain, and there is no other instance
of it ; whilst lahat does appear in Exodus vii, 1 1 (with which 22 should be compared) in the certain and accepted sense of " prestige, enchantement, prodige magique." Therefore we could render the obscure expression : " the turning prodigy of
the glaive courbe." In fact 'hereb is properly the harpe, the glaive
recurved like a reaphook (faucille). [I purposely retain Lenormant's "glaive " and " faucille "
; and I draw especial attention to the fact how near he continues to approach to my perfectly independent line of argument.] In any case, the 'hereb is connected with the cherubim (kerubim) of the gate of Gan'Eden in a way which curiously recalls the connection of the cherubim and the wheels in the double vision of the Merkabah of Ezechiel (i, 15-21 ; x, 2, 6, 9-17). It would seem that we must place the 'hereb, continues Lenormant, whom I trust that I faithfully abridge, between the cherubim hovering
(planant) at a certain height, where it turns upon itself, moving
of its own proper motion of rotation, like the wheels of the prophet.
I s to this movement of rotation, I (Lenormant) do not hesitate to think that it is not possible to understand it except as
taking place, equally with that of the wheels, on (surj a horizontal plane.



688 The Niglit of the Gods. [Btiddhas
It is more and more certain that Chaldea was the starting-point of the story, which goes back to an extremely far distant date.^ At the same time Lenormant freely admits that these zvheels which moved before Ezechiel's cherubs were also very obscure to him. One wheel was near each cherub, and the wheel was a wheel-inside-a-wheel. The four cherubs went in the direction of their heads, and did not turn aside in their course. When they proceeded, the wheels went joined to them. . . . The wheels
also, as well as the cherubs, were filled with eyes all over; they had
an appalling circumference and altitude.^ As to the cherubim, Lenormant, in a masterly argument, proves them to be taken from, or identical with., the colossa[ w i n ged buljs
(kerub, a bull), the favouring genii which flanked and protected the entrances of Assyrian palaces, and which the Chaldeo-As
syrians from the tenth to the fifth century li.C. called kirubu." [The most solemn subjects have their grotesque side ; and
I find in a price-list of the "finest American beef" this year (1889), a mention of the "Wing end" of the sirloin and of the
ribs.]
It seems to me, on a comparison of all this with what I have here and in other passages advanced, that the 'hereb resolves itself into the chakra-weapon ; the wheels into the symbols of the revolu
tion of the heavens, or even at need into circles of the celestial sphere parallel to the equator ; and that the four cherubs become
the four great animal constellations on which I have already
dwelt. The chief weapon of the great Babylonian god Ea had seven rays and fifty faces, which turned every way, destroying the bodies of the fighters ; which reminds us, says Mr. WalHs Budge," of the flaming sword which turned every way mentioned in Genesis

Ceraunia, Brontia, and Ombria.
THE only way to make it clear what was meant of old by
Ceraunia, brontia, and ombria is to classify a few extracts. Anselm van Boot, in his Historia Gemmanun} says the ceraunia
was so called because it falls with the thunder. It is smooth, and in this differs from the brontia, and is sometimes round and sometimes long. The Germans called it " Donnerkeil, Donnerstein, gros Krot
tenstein, Schlegel, Straalhamer, Stralkeil, Stralstein,and Strapfeil " ; and the Italians, Sagetta, a word which they also applied to the glossopetra (of which lower down). The ceraunia is exactly like a wedge. They generally have, where the equilibrium is {i.e. in the centre of gravity) a very round hole, one side of which is larger than
the other as the holes that are made in hammers are. And as all these stones look like hammers, wedges, hatchets, plough-shares
(socs ?) or similar instruments which have hobs for handles, some have thought that they v/ere not the arrows (bolts) of the thunder,
but iron instruments changed to stone by time. But it is a belief so constant and approved by so many that the ceraunia is the thunderbolt, that if any one would combat it, he would seem out of his senses. He cites Gcorgius Agricola, Kentmannus, and Conradus Gesnerus, and gives the following figures of ceraunia
which clearly show that we would have been all treated as madmen
in Van Boot's time, the latter half of the i6th century. The
Ceraunia are white and transparent, black, or red. Some are
like halberds. The black and round are called bctitli, and they are

thought to ha\e the power of breaking or dispersing a marine
army or carrying the assault of a town.
The Glossopetra is also pretty clear to us. Van Boot roughly
fieures it as follows :
Here the largest spear or arrow-head was either embedded in some substance or had remained in an unfinished state. The tongue-like figure accounts for the Latin name, and the tongue
was of course the serpent's. The Italians were nearer the truth
with their " sagetta." Some believed them to be thunder-darts
(pp. 436, 620). The Chelonite, Brontia, or Ombria, was called in Germany
" gros Krattenstein, formerly Donnerstein or Vetterstein." They
called that which fell with the thunder brontia, and that which fell with tempest and rain without thunder ombria. For all that
they are identical. Some are yellowish, others greenish, others dark and dull, and of other colours. These stones are often
hemispherical, and rarely longish. They are at times as big as an Ggg. Some have two circles like the nave which turns round the
axle of a wheel, with five raised spokes, as it were, equally divided,
going out to the circumfer
ence. Pliny said the brontia
was like a tortoise-head. [This must be a mistake for

distinguished from the brontia only by its exterior form.." His

figures of the brontia (or ombria or chelonite) are here closely copied ; and it is clear that they are nothing but fossil echino
dermata. They seem to resemble cidaris or pedina rotata. This seems to explode (and account for) a good deal of the conflicting and unintelligible statements one meets with about the brontia and the ombria. The " Serpent's-egg," of v^-g;^^ /cr^^
which I also give a careful
reproduction, must be relegated to the same category. But Van Boot said it was classified among the toadstones. They were of a white black (there can be no mistake about it: " d'vn blanc noir"), very white inside and very hard outside, and seemed to have an affinity with the brontia and ombria. His own opinion was that they were the petrified eggs of land tortoises. It just occurs to one to ask whether some of the decorations on the whorls (see pp. 645, 646) may not have been made in imitation
of these magic " stones " of the past. " Fossil echini of flint" have been found buried with bodies on Ashey Down, Isle of Wight, and (Saxon ?) near Chatham.
Scottish peasants retain a belief in their virtue. Evans saw
bored cidares in Saxon necklaces, and others turned into spindle
whorls.'

the tulasi shrub or basil (ocymuin sanclnui) is planted in the court
yard, with a space round it for reverential circumambulation, or
domestic pradakshina. As a rule, all the religion of the women consists in walking round the tulasi, and praying and making offerings to it. The perambulation is repeated 108 times, while repeating the 108 names of Vishnu, with the right shoulder turned towards the plant ; that is following, mimicking the (apparent) revolution of the heavens round the Universe-axis, with which the World-tree, or rather
its stem, must be identified. A plant of this holy basil also appears

where women who have no tulasi at home go for their soul's constitutional.- At Vishnu's temples one of the acts of devotion is to walk round the outside of the temple, with the right shoulder
towards it, once, seven times, or 108 times.^ The Buddhist dagopas of Ceylon arc circumambulated in the same way, and the tawaf or circuit of the Kaaba at Mecca is in the same holy direction.^ Hindus, when worshipping at serpent-shrines, lie prone, and thus wriggle round snake-like several times with the right side
to the shrine.'^ The chief mourner, holding a lighted torch, walks
three, or three-times-three, times round the funeral pile at Benares
before he sets fire to it." The Adi Granth, the Sikh bible, is kept in the sanctuary of the Golden Temple at Amritsar ; and the Sikh reverence and worship of the book are well known. The chief act of devotion is to circumambulate the corridor which surrounds the sanctuary three, five, or seven times ; and many of the worshippers are not Sikhs at all, but Hindu women : so consonant is the practice with their ingrained habits of mill-round devotions."' The great pradakshinas or religious pilgrimages of the Hindus are always made " right wheel." The most remarkable of these circular tours are of course the well-known pilgrimages along both banks of a sacred river from the source down the left bank to the mouth, then across, and up the right bank again to the starting

point. The Ganges thus takes six years, if it doesn't kill ; the Nerbudda three years ; the Godaveri and Krishna about two years.^ The Paharis of the Himalayas take their flocks round the village in the same constant direction, walking at first and then
running, thrice or oftener ; or they lead a sheep or a goat round
the sick or injured, and then sacrifice it by striking off its head.^ This is of course an outcome of their dancing round the kJiuda,
the Holy or " Ark " of their dcvi or village-goddess. At the great annual festival the khuda itself is frequently carried round in a
very narrow circle—made to revolve in fact— " right wheel "
; the
men at the same time dancing round it in the same direction. The women, however, dance simultaneously in the reverse direction,
linking themselves together into a ring by each putting one arm
round another's waist, and keeping the free left arm towards the
khuda.- The reason of this particular reversal is to be found in
the opposite natures of the two primeval dual co-principles, one of the names for which are the masculine and the feminine. In
Abyssinia the priests march thrice round an ark, in the right,
correct, direction.' This most important religious practice is found in India as far
back as the Rig Veda : " The ministering priest performs Agni's worship ; having walked round [the altar], he takes up the ladles
which are first, to present the oblations."^
In Thibet great stone-slabs are put up and inscribed with the divine charm Om mani padme hum, and merit is acquired by walking round them with the right shoulder to the stone. These stones sometimes extend for a mile or half a mile together along the great tracks, which always run on both sides of the stones, so that travellers both ways may pass them in the orthodox fashion.
If indeed in the famous formula Om mani padme hum the second and third words are to be rendered "jewel " and "lotus" or
" the jewel in the lotus," it is also possible to consider mani
(manava) as the child that issues from the lotus flower, and as 1
signifying male or a phallus,* which would attract the mani to the
j
phallic interpretation (p. 66) of the Japanese spear made of a f jewel. If then the Egyptian symbolism of the lotus-flower as a
feminine adjunct could be brought in,* we should have in Om the

central triad, and in mani with padme the central dual male and female principles that form two of that triad. This interpretation, which seems to me of importance, departs but slightly (and without differing) from Prof Rhys Davids's " the self-creative power is in the cosmos " and from Hodgson's Thibetan gloss of " the mystic
triform deity is in him of the jewel and the lotus." But among the
endless attempts at interpreting this famous formula of Om mani padme hum, the Abbe Hue's seems to me easily to bear away the palm.^ He elaborated it after communing freely with the Thibetan Lamas. There is no doubt that viani means gem, and padme lotus ; and he then expounds as follows, taking the gem to be perfection, and the lotus as the emblem of Buddha: "Oh (for) perfection, (and absorption in) Buddha. Amen" The illimitable repetition of the mantra is thus a perpetual aspiration after Nirvana.
In the Sinha-sana Dvva-trinsati a lotus-flower produces a diamond each day, and never fades. Hue mentioned various modes of circular pilgrimage practised
outside the Buddhist Lamaseries of Tartary. The most meritorious seems to be to prostrate the body flat, forehead to ground, at every step made ; thus measuring the path of pilgrimage with one's length the whole way round. Other pilgrims walk the distance, but carry an immense load of sacred books, the exact weight of which is prescribed for each by the local grand Lama When the round is completed, the pilgrim is credited with having
repeated the whole of the sacred scriptures contained in the books
under which he, she, or it—for children also go circuit—have
staggered. Less fanatical persons simply walk the circuit, telling their beads or turning a chukor or hand prayer-wheel the while.^ And of course the Buddhist, Mahomedan, and other rings of beads must be put into the category of circular devotions. But the most comprehensive of all the practices of this kind is perhaps the Revolving Library invented by the Chinese Buddhist priest Fu Dai-ji (as he is called in Japan) who lived in our 6th
century. As the Buddhist scriptures consist of 6,771 volumes, it
is impossible for any one pair of eyes to read them through ; but
the will can be substituted for the deed, and the whole merit of the
encyclopedic reading realised, by Fu Dai-ji's invention. He fixed

his library of 6,771 books so plumbly on a slick-swivelling pivot,
that one vigorous push sets the structure revolving. The Rin-z6 (revolving library) at Asakusa is of red lacquered wood on a black
lacquered base, and lotus-shaped stone pedestal. The books it holds were brought from China 600 years ago, and are still aired at every autumn equinox.^ [See also the analogous facts as to the Praying- Wheels, p. 589.] There is a Lapp folktale of a man who disappeared in the
winter-time, but was followed (in current slang "shadowed") in his disappearance by his wife. Tracking him in the snow, she found that he had walked round and round a bush, and that after several
circuits his footsteps began to take the form of bear-slots ; whereupon she also circumambulated the bush, and gradually turned into a she-bear. Soon afterwards she found her husband as a
bear in a bear's den. He lamented bitterly when he saw her, saying he was now doomed to be killed by his own son. She was, however, to jump on his empty skin so soon as he was flayed.
She did so, and recovered her human form." Here we clearly have a (fallen) bear-worship, and the perambulation of a (once)
sacred tree in the far North, leading, as worship, to perfect union
with the deity adored.
One of the most striking " actualities " of circular worship which has come under my notice is given by Mr. Consul, F.S.A., Bourne." He observed in February, 1886, among the aborigines
Shans or Lolos or both—near Ch'iao-t'ou, at an altitude of over
6,000 feet, the following :
" Another New-year's institution [besides the ' Christmas tree '] is an immense see-saw [which is also a round-about] ; that is, a
pole 25 feet long, pivoted on an upright iive feet high, so as to revolve freely. Two men mount the machine, one at each end, and throwing arms and chest over the pole, they then, as if with
giant strides, make it revolve ; one man shoving off with his feet from the ground while the other is high in the air." Thus we may again see the Tree and the revolution of the heavens combined in these primitive festive observances.

Dancing^ Cwcidar Worship. 697
In a Korean Buddhist temple " the monks in their finest garments were solemnly walking in procession round and round
in an endless circle, chanting as they did so a litany in Sanscrit."^ There are some curious passages in the Rig Veda (iii, 132, 133) which seem to make the fire circumambulate the victim on the altar. The words in brackets are added by the all-supplying and all-questionable scholiast Sayana, who was so studiously copied by Wilson. "The multiplying [priest] conducting [the worship] of
the gods, circumambulates " [the fire]. " The offerer of the
oblation, ancient and multiplying [the ofi'ering] thrice circumambulates " [the victim]. " Agni moving measuredly, circumam
bulates [the victim] of his own " [accord]. One can only repeat
Wilson's constant remark : " the expression is not very clear."
In the extremely ancient Hindu ritual for cow-sacrifice, the Agnidhra priest thrice circumambulated the victim clock-hands
fashion ; and the victim was also led round the fire three times."-^ The Lacasdemonians used to whip their children (as a relic, doubt
less, of child-sacrifice) round the altar of Artemis Orthia, the
upright Diana.'* In the oldest known form of Arabian sacrifice, as described by Nilus, a camel is bound to the altar, and the worshippers are then
led thrice round it, chanting solemnly, before the immolation. In later Arabia the tawaf or act of circling the sacred stone was still a principal part of religion. At Mecca in the times of heathenism, the sacred circuit of the Caaba was made by the Bedouins either naked or in clothes borrowed from a religious community."* The celebrated sheikh Muhi eddin el 'Arabi related a vision of his when in a state of insila meditation : Once when I was near the holy and reverend Ka'ba I beheld a Person who continuously made the tawaf or circuit of that holy building. His height was quite as great as the Ka'ba itself I concluded the Person must
belong to spiritual bodies only. As he continued his circuits, he recited the words : " Truly we have been for many long years engaged in walking round this holy house." Muhi-eddin questioned him, and he replied, "I am of Mankind ; it is now more than 40,000
years since I left this world."^

In consecrating a church the bishop makes three circuits of the new building. In his iirst circular turn he sprinkles the upper part of the walls with holy water ; the second time the sprinkling is made upon the lower part of the walls, "towards the foundations "
;
and the third aspersion is made at his own height. Subsequently he walks round the new altar seven times sprinkling holy water upon it. Later on a priest with an incensor unceasingly circumambulates the altar, incensing it, until the prayers and ceremonies are complete.' And the Lavabo of the mass seems to preserve a mention of circular worship in the phrase : circumdato altare tuum, Domine. Most devout Christian processions still start from some sacred spot of assembly and, without stopping anywhere on the road, return to the same place by another route." This seems to perpetuate the idea of the non-retrograding heavens-motion ; and the
same superstitio is seen in the ubiquitous dislike of retracing the steps on a journey. Processions are still commonly and almost instinctively made with devotion round villages and fields ; round the parish ; round a cloister in a monastery ; or round a church,
inside or out.^
The only ancient processions cited in the Montpellier Catechism are : the translation of the Ark from Kiriathiearim to the house of Obed-Edom and from there to the town of Hebron (ii Sam. vi) ; the solenni procession at Antioch to transport the relics of the martyr St. Babylas, in the time of the Emperor Julian ; and a procession at Milan under St. Ambrose to transport the relics of
St. Gervais and St. Protais. But these instances, it is to be feared, do not assist us very much. Another remark of the catechism
(pp. 285, 291), which is more to the purpose, is that pious processions in time of public calamity were called Litanies, that is supplications, whence also comes the term Litanies of the Saints,
Litania, litatio, a sacrifice'* ; lito, to sacrifice* ; liturgy ; and lituus,
an augur's wand, ought all to belong to one central idea of worship.
Some translators have even suggested, writes Capt. Conder,^

that when Samuel is represented as going " in circuit " to Bethel,
Gilgal and Mizpeh (i Sam. vii, 16) the real meaning is that he perambulated or walked in procession round the sacred enclosures

THE mystic ceremony of Thakshina " (Sanskrit, dakshina,
right), says Alabaster, is observed by Buddhists and
Brahmins in Siam. On festival days they—especially the women march thrice round some holy spire, with hands raised in ador
ation, or holding smoking scent-sticks ; and Fergusson in his Tree and Serpent Worship says the gallery of the ancient topes was
clearly intended for this purpose. The practice of walking round persons or objects, keeping the right hand towards them, is also
Brahminical.^ Then there is the old Highlanders' ceremony of going deisiil,
" sunwise," round chapels, houses, people, and cattle ; now done for
luck, but preserving for us a lingering trace of the worship
practised by their ancestors.^ It is also done round graves, and it was a common custom to turn oneself round to the right at the
beo-inning and end of journeys for luck, as well as at weddings, and
on other occasions. The " turn round three times and catch who you may " of children's games will here occur to any one ; and the catching may hang on to the practice of securing a victim for
human sacrifice pointed to in the Welsh stampede, after the
quenching of the Halloween bonefires, to the cry of " The cutty black sow catch the hindmost!"; just our own "devil take the
hindmost ! "" To turn the reverse way, to the left, still well-known
in Scotland by the expressive term " wither shins," is evil and unlucky. Witches dance that way, and it is like the Bible upside
down."* Essentially the same thing, the turning of the whole body to
the right—" left shoulders forward," " right turn "—is to be found
in Pliny (xxviii, 2). In adorando dextram ad osculum referimus, totumque corpus circumagimus ; and in Plautus {Ciirculio, I, i, 70) Si deos salutas, dextroversum conseo ; and further Solinus (45 Med.) : Tarpeium Jovem terna dextratione lustravit. The round

Plutarch records^ that Alexander, having anointed with oil the funeral column of Achilles, ran, as was customary, naked round the tomb with his companions, and placed a wreath or crown (see
p. 613) of flowers on it. We now generally call the direction of these circulations " with
the sun," and thus we still " send round the bottle "—a practice which was once doubtless sacred, and arose in archaic sacrificial meat, bread, and wine feasts. The term " with the sun " is by no means a clear or a good one, and indeed that remarkable " philosopher " known to us as Mr. Alfred Jingle added the explanatory gloss of " through the button-hole." Perhaps the quickest way of indicating the direction to the modern perception is " clock-hands
fashion." The cards are still dealt in the same direction at a round game.
Those still amenable to the old superstitio walk round their chairs or turn them round for luck. When playing a game of chance,
the clairvoyant author of " A Lodging for the Night " makes the president of "The Suicide Club" deal out the fatal cards the reverse
way.^ One can get the idea of " with the sun " another way by
imagining (or observing) a gyrating plant, such as a hop, doing its spiral climbing round a pole. The point of its shoot follows
the sun from its rising to its setting, and it therefore goes round
the pole (ascending of course meanwhile) as the hands of a horizontal chronometer do round their pivot. But there are many plants, like the Wistaria and the Kidney-bean (phaseolus vulgaris), which do their climbing the reverse way ; in fact Darwin'' says the
greater number of climbing plants do so ; so that this illustration is ambiguous also, and we must keep to the useful phrase " clock
hands fashion." The Greek diviners, who faced the North (p. 425) had the favour
able auguries of the East on their right hand, while the Romans, who right-about-faced to the South, looked upon the left-hand auguries as the lucky ones. But of course the Grecian practice
came to have its influence on the Romans :

SCHOPENHAUER who, it need scarcely be said, identifies
muscular irritability with the Will, has the following philosophy of Dancing. Irritability, he says, objectified in the muscular
tissue, constitutes the chief characteristic of animals, and of the animal element in man. Where it predominates to excess
dexterity, strength, bravery—that is fitness for bodily exertion
and for War—is usually to be found. Nearly all warm-blooded
animals, and even insects, far surpass Man in irritabilit)'. It is by irritability that animals are most vividly conscious of their existence ; wherefore they exult in manifesting it. There is even still
a trace of that exultation perceptible in Man, in dancing.^ In this view many dancers will agree ; but nevertheless an
endeavour is made in the following essay : first, to trace the origin of at least some forms of Dancing more closely than has yet been
done, to a primitive religious practice ; next, to connect that primi
tive religious practice both with the circular perambulation of
Eastern shrines and with the use of the Prayer- wheel ; z.\\^ finally,
to explain all three—round dancing, circular worship by perambu
lation, and the twirling of the prayer-wheel —from the extremely
ancient worship of the (apparently) revolving Heavens, which first
gave a primitive sacred symbolism to the Wheel.
In the most archaic times China would appear to have been
already well-accustomed to ceremonial, ritualistic dancing. In the \
first month of spring, the imperial chief director of music had to
practise dancing with his pupils.^ In the second month of the same season dances were publicly performed.* Such ceremonial
dances "displayed the gravity of the performers, but did not awaken the emotion of delight." They were taught to boys from thirteen onwards." On all occasions of the display of sacrificial offerings, the accompaniments of dancing and singing were imperative, unless some great state reason interfered as an obstacle.^

The CJioiv Li laid it down that the imperial dancing-master directed
the dances with silk-tasseled wands and plumes at the periodical
sacrifices to the deities of mountains and rivers, or to the spirits
of the Earth, of its four regions, and of cereals ; or at the ceremonies prescribed in times of drought.^ The emperor took the
lead of the " sons of the state," or young nobles, and danced the
six consecrated dances with them.' To this day in Formosa (Hainan) a Spring feast of Fire is celebrated about our month of April, and during the previous week the peasants are instructed in the dances, or rather cadenced miovements, which the ceremonies
require.''^
We shall now cross over to Japan, and examine the similar archaic Shinto observances still extant. At the famous Kasuga
temple at Nara, young girls are kept in readiness, just as we have seen them in India, to go through the ancient Kagura dance for the pilgrims. They wear a white inner garment, loose red drawers, and a long gauzy mantle ornamented with the Kasuga crest of the Wistaria flower. Their locks are gathered into one long tress which
hangs down the back, a chaplet of artificial Wistaria and single scarlet
camellia flowers crowns the forehead, while their faces are thickly
painted white,. As the dance proceeds, to the accompaniment of
an orchestra of three priests —who perform on the drum and flute,
while singing the Kagura tita or hymn —the dancing-girls grasp alternately a fan or a bunch of small bells.^ Mr. Satow has traced
the ritual of this temple back to the (alleged) Japanese date of 859 A.D., when it is said to have been first composed. The temple of Oharanu near Kioto, where the Kasuga gods are also wor
shipped, is said to have been founded in 850, and there, according to the very ancient ritual of the purification feast, the general of
the body-guard directed his men in the dance called Adzuma-mai. Subsequently, at the command of the vice-minister of religion, the
musicians performed a sacred concert in which the flutes first played a short movement alone, and were then joined by the harpists and the singers ; an officer of the ministry of religion
leading ofT with the first few bars, and the official singers finishing the piece. This again was followed by a Yamato-mai, danced in turn by the chief priests of the temple, by members of the great

Fujihara family, and by the vice-minister of religion himself.^ At the Ge-Ku and Nai-Ku temples at Yamada similar dances are now performed for pious pilgrims at a charge of from five to twenty dollars, according to the number of dances required. At Mitake the dances are exhibited on a large covered platform, and there is a similar stage at the temple of the goddess of Food near Daruma-ji. So also at To-no-mine, at Nikko, and at Yahiko.^ The Kami, the native Shinto gods, delight in these Kagura, and also in the Yamato-mai dances, which last from March 18 to July , 10, and are no doubt of extreme antiquity. The dancing takes
place, in fact, at every notable Shinto shrine. It is pantomimic,
and represents—so Dr. W. G. Aston informs me—some mythical
or historical religious event. At one temple in Tokio it took place once a month to sound of fife and drum. The dancers were masked and costumed ; there were no words spoken, the rite
consisting solely of music and dancing. The dancing, like the Wistaria, has been adopted from Shintoism by all-assimilating Buddhism ; and there is a dancing stage with an orchestra at the Hondo Buddhist temple in Kioto, just as there is at the Shinto temple of Shimo-Gamo in the same capital; while the family of the hereditary Buddhist high-priest of the Shin-shiu or Monto sect embroider the altar-cloth of their chief
temple with an eightfold Wistaria flower.^ Chaitanya, the founder of the Hindu sect which bears his name and is peculiar to Bengal and Orissa, was born about 1485, and is regarded as an incarnation of Krishna. One of his tenets insisted upon the importance of singing (sankirtana) and dancing, added to
contemplation, in order to fit the mind for ecstatic communion
with the deity ; and his followers often swoon away in their fits of
religious choreal emotion.* But this is merely a quite modern revival. In the Rig Veda Indra is called the Dancer: "Thou/ Indra, the Dancer^ hast destroyed ninety cities ; Dancer, thou hast destroyed tliem" (ii, 34). I cite Wilson's version. The Scholiasts
say the dance of Indra is the war-dance of battle, but the gloss is
unnecessary, and it seems inaccurate. In Saivism at large, one of the aspects of Siva is that of a wild
and jovial mountaineer (kirata) given to hunting, drinking and

dancing (nritya-priyah). He is even called the Lord of Dancing, and performs with his wife the tandava dance, surrounded by
troops of dwarfish buffoons. Prof. Robertson Smith explains " lord of dancing " as meaning : he to whom dancing is due as an act of homage^ ; but the consideration here now urged induces me to hazard the view that the dancing of which the supreme central
god is lord, is the turning of Indra, of the Universal heavens. The worshippers of Siva in this character generally belong to the sect called Saktas, who are devoted to the wife of the god.^ The extremely archaic and mysterious god Bes (see remarks upon him
at p. t) " is associated with ideas of the dance."'^ There can be no doubt, says Sir Monier Williams, that dancing in the East was once exclusively connected with religious devotion, especially with
homage paid to Siva in his character of I ord of Dancing." There seems to be no adequate reason for thus " especially " circum
scribing the ritualistic worth and significance of the observance. An important bronze statue in the Indian Museum shows the mahadeva tripur-antika Shiva apparently unconsciously destroying the demon Tripur-Asura by merely graceful and solemn dancing.* A plate in Moor* shows Mahadeva, Brahma, and Indra dancing in
worship before the seated goddess Devi or Bhavani. A hint that dancing was (nay, still is) also a natural, instinctive mode of
showing off the paces in sexual selection. Vishnu as Krishna dances while playing the flute,'' or holding the sphere as BalaKrishna while he treads on the serpent Kaliya's head. The Mandala-nritya or Rasa-mandala'' which is called merely " a circular dance in honour of Krishna," is really (compare rasi-chakra
for the zodiac) the dance of the spheres. A representation of it in Moor (plate 6^) shows eight couples of Gopis dancing in a ring round Krishna and his consort Radha, who are also dancing.
There are eight musicians—six females outside the ring and the two deities inside, who both play on the flute, which was Krishna's
favourite instrument. To quote further from Sir M. Williams : Most of the SouthIndian temples, he writes, maintain a band of musicians ; that of

Tanjore has one of fifty. They all too keep up troupes of dancinggirls, of whom there are fifteen at Tanjore. Ten of these danced before Sir M. Williams in the court of the temple. It is wellknown, he adds, that in ancient times women were dedicated to the service of the temples, like the Vestal virgins of Europe. They were held to be wedded to the god, and had no other duty but to dance before his shrine ; hence they were called the god's
slaves, deva-dasi.^
Although the texts are familiar, I may not omit to adduce the dancing, sacrifice, and worship before the golden calf in Exodus xxxii, 8, 19 ; the prophets of Baal leaping on the altar (i Kings, xviii, 26) ; the prophetess Miriam and the rest of the women singing to the Lord with timbrels and dances (Exod. xv, 20, 21) ; and David leaping and dancing and playing before the Lord with all his might (ii Sam. vi, 14, 16 ; i Chron. xv, 29)." The exhortations in the Psalms must also be quoted : " Praise the Lord with the timbrel and dance " (cl,4), and " Let the children of Zion praise His name in the dance " (cxlix, 3). Captain Conder in his Syrian Stone Lore says that the sacred dances which formed part of the ritual of the Phoenicians and Hebrews still survive in Palestine. At Debir (Dhaheriyeh) he saw the elders of the village dancing solemnly before the shrine of their Neby. According to the Mishna, dancing used to take place in the temple at Jerusalem at the feast of Tabernacles, that is, of tents or huts. Numerous Phcenician clay and stone statuettes show that dancing to music was a common practice at temple festivals. Perrot and Chipiez^ engrave a limestone group of three dancing-women holding hands at arm's length, with a flute-player in the middle. The women (who remind one of the modern dancing dervishes) wear long skirts down to the feet, with conical hoods. Sometimes dances took place round a cone, or round a tree-trunk with a pigeon's nest in it— probably a practice of the

sang in their carnal devotions. Kadesh, the capital of that nation, which means " consecrated," was only one of the many shrines/ such as Kadesh-Naphtali and Kadesh-Barnea, where such loose rites were established. Dancing is an important item in the deotaworship of the aboriginal Himalayans ; but a curious outcome of this is the order promulgated by a former orthodox Brahman Rajah in Kulu who ordered that all the deotas in his dominions should assemble once a year at his capital, and dance in homage round the image of the god Rughonath (?) which he had brought from the holy city of Benares ; " and this order is still obeyed by some 200 deotas."- The Shakers, whom Anna Lee founded in
1774, dance during divine service, by a revival and not a survival
of an ancient rite which was long ago practised by the Essenes."
Dances still take place round the menhir (tall-stone) in the Orkneys on New-year's night, and also round that near Croisic in
Brittany.''
If we now consider the customs of the American continents, we shall find from Velasco' that, as pointed out by Dr. A. Reville in his Hibbert Lectures, the grand form of religious demonstration among the Peruvians was the dance. The title of the principal festivals, rayvii, means " dance." These dances were so animated that the performers seemed to the. Spaniards to be out of their
senses. The Incas themselves took no part in these violent movements, but had an Inca dance of their own, which was grave and measured ; and it is well known that the Lica was identified with
the deity.*"' In Franklin's first Journey' he found even the halfbreed red Indian women passionately fond of the dance, though a stranger would have at first imagined the contrary from their apparent want of animation ; for they affected a sobriety of demeanour the very opposite of their general character. Here was, doubtless, a reminiscence of the sacred origin of their dancing, and we may compare the fact with what has been already stated as to the Incas and the Chinese. The word for " dance " (bina) has come to mean religion with the Bushmen, who say when they are ignorant of a religious

mystery : " I don't dance that dance."^ When Pund-jel, the supreme creator of the Black-fellow, made the two clay images of the first men, he danced round them. Lucian {irepl 'Opxwewf;) said that there was not a single ancient mystery in which there
was not dancing, and it had come to be said that the revealers of mysteries " danced them out " {i^opj(^ela6aL). " That's how it's done," in fact, as Jack Pudding says.
It has flashed upon me since writing the foregoing that the Seven Maccabees must have been originally supernatural. They
" were also known as the As!noJiQdi.ns, a name traced ... to
an illustrious ancestor named Chasmon : in Josephus, Asaino7i&\xs."'^ The suggestion is here inevitable that we have to do with none other than Eshmun, the Eighth, about whom so much is here said (see Index). In that case Maccabee would be connected with the Greek (or Phoenician ?) Makar (see Index) ; and the Seven would be simply the Kabirim of Ursa Major ; which would account for
the Danse Macabre ! Judas, who alojie of his father's jive (not seven) sons, was called Maccabeus (i Mace, ii), would have been so named after the Seven Maccabees, just as we have the Orsini
(from Ursa) in Italy to this day. This supposition will alone
make clear the rabbinical cabalistic playing with the name Mac
cabee, in which they saw either the final letters of AbrahaM, IsaaC
and JacoB, or else the initial letters of Exodus xv, il. They also
said it meant a hauniicr, " as expressing valour and success in war."^ In this last case we should have some of the endless obscure references to the weapons of the gods often pointed out in this Inquiry. This crux is commendable to Semitic scholars. We find another leading instance of religious dancing in the Dance of Death, or danse Macabre of the middle ages, which was also known as the chorea Machabaorum according to Littre, from whom however Devic utterly differs. This " dance of the Machabees " is described by Du Cange in terms which seem to make it
more of a mystery-ballet—to invent a term—than anything else
It was, he says —and he traces it in a text of 1453 —a pleasing
ceremony piously instituted by ecclesiastics, in which the dig
natories, whether of the church or of the world, together led the
dance, quitting its mazes one by one, so as to figure forth that

each one of us must undergo death. The clearness of this passage is not that of cr}-stal ; and we may conclude that the dignatories
were personated by " professionals," for the text of 1453 mentions four measures of wine for them : quatuor simasias vini exhibitas
(subsequently a doctor's phrase) illis qui choream Machabaeorum
fecerunt. Naturally, I shall not attempt to decide between Littre (who relies on Du Cange) and Devic ; but it would seem that the subject is by no means threshed out. Meanwhile Littre's witnesses
seem to have the best of it.' " In the early Christian Church," says the Encyclopedia Brit
annica, " special provision was made for dancing in the choirs." [This, it may be remarked, was a clear inheritance from Paganism.] " Scaliger, who astonished Charles V by his dancing powers, said bishops were called praesules because they led the dance on feastdays. According to some of the fathers, the angels " [who would thus be clearly star-beings] " are always dancing, and the glorious
company of apostles is really a chorus of dancers," [which brings them hazardously close to the zodiacal signs]. " Dancing however
fell into discredit with the feast of the agapze. St. Augustine says : Melius est fodere quam saltare ; and religious dancing was generally prohibited for some time "; but " After the middle of the
1 8th century there were still traces of religious dancing in the
cathedrals of Spain, Portugal, and Roussillon ; especially the Mussarabian mass at Toledo." Spanish : mozarabe, mustarabe ; Portuguese : mozarabe, musarabe. From mosta'rib = arabized ; the name given by the Arabs to the foreign tribes that dwelt among them. Engelmann {Gloss, p. 2 1 says that this term for the Christians who dwelt among the Moors was especially applied to those of Toledo who were there permitted six churches. Cardinal Ximenes, according to Voltaire,^ re-established Mozarabian mass in the cathedral of Toledo, with its orderly and devotional dances in the choir and nave. The
Mozarabic liturgy is in great part Grecian in character, although
Latin in tongue ; and, differing in this from all the ancient
Christian liturgies of the Gauls, it takes no account of the Gregorian or Ambrosian chant. The Mozarabian liturgy has been

7i2 The Night of the Gods. ^Dancing.
Leaping.
AS to the scriptural "leaping" just mentioned, a parallel
custom in Chinese mourning may here be introduced. It
would seem as if—music and dancing and singing being out of the
question in the funeral ceremonies —^jumping and shouting took
their place, as a relief to pent-up emotion. Thus the Li-Ki^ lays
it down that when a ruler dies, " the officer of prayer, the minister,
the officer of the temple, all the relatives, and the high nobles, with
tlie great and other officers, will wail and leap ; leaping three times
\\\\\-\ each burst of grief . . . The son in the arms of his bearer is made to leap, and the women in their apartments also
leap. Thrice will they do so, leaping three times each time "
strange inversion of our festive three times three ; and it might be
added in passing that it is at least odd that three times three is still the ordinary number of commencing strokes to /^// the death of a man in the tolling of our own " passing bell." Thence, it is said, the libellous joke upon our Alton Lockes : Nine tailors (for
tellers) to a man.
We are further informed in the Lt-Ki (i, 169) that "beating the breast by women, and leaping by men, are extreme expressions of grief." There are many other similar passages in this Ritual. It might here be noted that Richard Pococke, writing in
the middle of the i8th century,- described the funerals of Mull, where " widow and children danced with others round the corpse
till very lately."
This form of devotion occupied in fact a large place in primitive religions generally, and the remarks of Tsze-yu, the great disciple of Confucius, on the subject of the expression, the relief, of inward emotions by outward movements of the body, will not be out of place here. When a man rejoices, said the sage, he looks pleased ; when pleased he thereupon sings ; when singing he sways himself about ; swaying himself about he proceeds to dancing ; from dancing he gets to stamping and a state of wild excitement ; that
excitement goes on to distress ; distress expresses itself in sighing ;
sighing is followed by beating the breast, and beating the breast

by leaping.^ This attempt at a psychological analysis is wooden
and superficial to a degree—compare it with Schopenhauer's—and the commentators seem to think the passage corrupt ; it is not
however, without its interest, especially for those who have witnessed the ceremonies and contortions of the Moslem Rufai or
" howling " dervishes. This jumping was also a mode of showing grief in ancient Egypt. Mariette says of a mourning bas-relief of Sakkarah (Memphis) : " Women are jumping with the strangest contortions , . . these funeral dances are kept up at the present day in the
greater part of the villages of Upper Egypt."^ As to this jumping, again, it remains of course in numerous
dances familiar to our eyes and feet, such as the Highland Fling and the Irish Jig. Even in the milder gymnastics of our modern
drawing rooms it survives in the polka, the Mazurka and the
Schottische.

714 The Night of the Gods. [Dancing
The Salii.
THE (fifth) priestly college of the Salii, the ancient Roman
dancing dervishes of Mars, the father of Romulus and of the
Roman nation, must not be forgotten.
Mars was Protean in his aliases—Mamers, Mamercus, MamiiiTus, Marmar, Mars, Mars pater, Marspiter, Maspiter, Mavors, and perhaps Marsyas. The Marsi of Latium, who had been doubtless the original worshippers of Mars, were known as Magicians and snake-charmers down to the latest Roman times. They were augurs (cic. Divin. ii, 33, 70) and their incantations were called Marsa nenia by Horace {Epod. xvii, 29). They were probably as lugubrious as what is now known as the Gregorian chant.
The origin of the Salii was lost, for we m.ust transfigure their own fable that they were founded by Numa to guard the buckler that fell from heaven ; but we may group all the facts known about them. Their college was on the Palatine hill, and their annual feast was in the first half of the month of Mars, of March, the opening of the natural year with spring, when they made solemn
processions round the city and the holy places, dancing, singing, and
carrying—" moving "—their twelve bucklers (ancilia movere) ; et
salius la^to portans ancilia collo (Lucanus : Pharsalia i, 603 ;) for the one buckler was twelve bucklers, which, doubtless, represented the
annual zodiac, and furnish a curiously close parallel to the twelve bells of another fabulous Emperor, Hwang-Ti (p. f). The later invention, when the symbolism was forgotten, that they were merely priests of the god of war,^ and that Numa had eleven other facsimile bucklers made, to puzzle would-be thieves of the single heavenly object, is transparently childish : it would have been so
easy to steal the whole dozen of little oval ancilia cut out at the sides. On the preservation of the heaven-dropt buckler, too, depended the safety of Rome ; which gives us a clear plagiary of the Trojan palladium and the Athenian statue of Athena.
A These priests of Mars carried a lance, or spear, or wand, or staff,
' or rod," and wore the conical headdress or apex described at p. f.
' I must here beg the reader to refer to the observations on the most archaic conceptions of Mars at pp. f. 2 Smith's Diet. (Apex), t See Index to References before Index.



Dancing?^ The Salii. 715
Dionysius (ii, 70) describes it as conical, but on ancient monuments it is round as well. They had the head veiled (which recalls Kronos) and their songs, sung by their vates or inspired chanter were called axamcnta, a word derived from axis, because, say the grammarians, they were written on tablets of wood ; but it seems
to mc that this gloss is quite needless, and misleading besides.
These axis-hymns were in a speech so archaic that they had become
incomprehensible, even to the Salii themselves in classical times.
Varro {L. L. vi, t6, Seal.) gave the beginning of one of them : Divom Dio exta cante, Divom Dio supplicante ; (Z. L. vii, 3, 86). which sounds very much like a forerunner of the early rhymed
Latins hymns of the Christian church^ ; and Festus (p. 3) said they
were in univcrsos Jwniines coinposita, where homines is clearly an
error, perhaps for deos, for he goes on to say : " nam in deos singulos versus ficti a nominibus eorum appellabantur, ut Janualii, Junonii, Minei-vii." That is, as I understand it, that the Carmina Saliaria, the axis-canticles, were addressed not to individual gods but to the gods or god of the universe ; to Janus, Mars, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva ; that they were part and parcel of a heavens
worship. A hym n to Ista r in Akkadian and Assyrian thus begins,
according to Prof. Sayce, " Thou who as the axis of the heavens "7 dawnest. In the dwellings of the earth her name revolves."" It would appear that the old and rude poetic metre called the Saturnine versus, numerus, carmen, or metrum, which Ennius said was invented by the Fauns of the rocks, was in its origin proper to such sacred hymns as those of the Salii and the Arvalian brothers, which latter Marini'' thought were embraced by the general term
carmina Saliaria. As to the bucklers, there is room for much doubt about their
actual form. Lanzi^ gives a drawing of three or five, which look
bean-shaped carried on a pole by " slaves," from a Florentine gem,
1 .g., Salve radix, salve porta, Ex qua mundo lux est orta. The god of gods, the divum dius here adored, is said to be Janus, whom the Salii called Janes or Eanus, calling themselves too after him, Janes or Eani. The fratres ^rvales also had a common formula : Jano patri Arietes II (? to Janus, second cf the Mars-ian fathers) which was attributed to the Salii as well. (Vossius : Inst. Oral, iv, i, 7 ; Marini : Atti, &c. ii, 366, ?86.) See also what is said on Janus. 2 Wallis Budge's Babyl. Life and Hist. 131. ^ Atti, &c. 11, 596. • Sa^gio, II, iv, I. See also Guhl and Koner : La Vie Antique, ii, 414.

which is here retraced. But this scarcely accords with a silver
denarius (which I also sketch) struck under Augustus.^ In the latter the ancilia have some resemblance to zodiacs joined by an oval piece which bears the hand and arm rings. In the centre we have the apex head
dress. As to the motto P. Stolo III Vir, Stolo was a surname in the gens Licinia. The description given by Festus is tantalizing :
" E coelo cecidisse fertur Ancile, id est scutum breve, quod ideo sic appellatum-est quia ex utroque
latere erat recisum, ut summum infimumque ejus
latus medio pateret." Festus p. 131 (ed. Miill.) Creuzer conjectured that the bucklers may well have had an astronomical and calendaric sense ; and Johannes Laurentius Lydia seems to have made this certain by saying that the twelve Salii of
Numa celebrated Janus after the number of the Italic months.^
The tunics of the anciliae-bearers or " slaves " on the Florentine
gem are, says Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, covered with
zodiacal or celestial-constellation figures.
The forged legend of the forging of the eleven terrestrial bucklers,
with intent to deceive, also gives the name of their maker as Mamurius Veturius, which must mean no more, and no less, than Ancient ' Mars (Mamers). Surely this is more common-sense than Varro's shot which gives the meaning of " ancient memory " to mamurius
veturius ! Itague Salii quod cantant " mamuri veturi " significant
veterem memoriam (Z. L. vi, 6, 63 § 45). Nor must we forget the indubitable connection of Numa, who ordered the 1 1 bucklers, with numen, and of Pompilius with the solemn pomps of the gods ; nor the pregnant fact that Numa as high-priest was Numa Martius, the Numa .of Maj;s.^ which brings us back again to Mamers, as before. Furthermore Numa is credited with the division of the year into 12 mos, and the making of the
bucklers may be a fantasia grounded on this belief. [See the
fuller disquisition on Numa, p. 719.] It is as well here not to
forget the round bucklers prominent in the rites of Hera of Argos (as to Argos meaning the heavens, see Index), nor the bucklers of
the Curetes.

Dancing:'] The Salii. 717
The reward which Mamurius received for his art in forging the additional bucklers was, recorded Plutarch/ to be commemorated
in the hymns which the SaHi sung. This is obviously pure legend. Mamurius was in the hymns because he had been the hicrhest o-od There were Salii at Alba as well as at Rome, and Hercules had atTibur his Salii, his Leapers, as well as Mars ; and they employed
hired dancing-girls (salii virgines conducticias), who also wore the
apex, and aided the priests in the sacrifices (Festus). These
Sabine Salii were later installed at Rome on the Quirinal hill. Indeed Servius says- (though it may be doubted) that in the more archaic times the Salii of Mars had served Hercules, and that it was Numa who diverted them to Mars. Tullus Hostilius seems to have doubled their number to twice-twelve, perhaps to provide deputies, and none but patricians were admitted. The dance of the Salii seems to have been a sort of polka rather than a waltz ; its name, tripodatio and tripudium, seeming
clearly to imply three " steps," while the priests' (and the girls')
very title, Salii, indicates jumping, or hopping. Livy (i, 20, 4)
says they went through the town as Numa ordained, cum tripudiis
solemnique saltatu ; and Seneca (Ep. 15) calls it familiarly a
fuller's jump, fullonius saltus. And Horace {Odes, iv, i.)
Illic bis pueri die Numen cum teneris virginibus tuum Laudantes, pede candido In moi-em SaliCim ter quatient humum.
May we not also conclude from the three steps that it was a " round " dance, and does not this number of steps connect the rite with the central supernal triad ?
Creuzer \\\, 399, 511) recognises the "complete analogy of the dances of the Salii with the astronomico-mimic dances of the priests of Anterior Asia, Samothrace and Crete," to which I refer under the headings of Kabeiroi, Corybantes, Curetes, and so on (see Index).
No Roman citizen, says Smith's Dictionary of Antiquities, danced except in connection with religion ; and all the religious dances, with the exceptions of the Bacchic and Corybantian, were simple, and consisted of gentle movements of the body, ^

witli various turnings and windings round the altar. The Encyclopedia Britannica adds that" a mystic philosophy" [—which
is merely an empty phrase if the thing be a positive fact—] found
in the sacred dances which formed so prominent a part of the worship of antiquity, a resemblance to the courses of the stars. The feast-days of the Salii were also those of the Matronalia or women's festival, when beans were exchanged and eaten. The eating raw, with salt, of the young tender pods of broad beans is still a common incident of the spring in that part of France which was formerly the country of the Santones, and small cottagers vie with each other in having this primeur. We find in a seventh-century sermon of St. Eloi, directed against Pagan superstitions, that leaping was among the surviving observances of the vanishing faith which were then being cried
down, especially at the summer solstice. Nullus in festivitate S.
Johannis, said the Saint, vel quibuslibet sanctorum solemnitatibus
solstitia aut vallationes, vel saltationes aut caraulas, aut cantica
diabolica exerceat." It is perhaps needless to point out here that
the carol was primarily a dance. [The sequence of a line of argument has obliged me to show elsewhere that the three-stepped dancing of the Arvalian Brothers resembled that of the Salii ; that the dancing of the Dactyles may have given rise both to their name and to the metric dactyl ; and that the Curetes and Corybantes had their sacred dances, which were meant to show forth the harmonious march of the hosts of the heavens. The remarks under the heading Dactyles as to Gigon (Herakles) and the dancing of the stars, and as to
the circular hymn-dances at the initiations of the Kabciroi are also important.]

Numa Pompilius.
'^T^HE following points taken with those already stated, seem j[ to me to be quite sufficient proof that Numa Pompilius rg^j resents aji extremely ancient supreme heavens-god , and parallel to the similarly accoutred fabulous Emperors of the dawn of Chinese cosmogony. Numa's senators \j-cad, zodiacal constellations] had to offer
solemn sacrifices, and dispatch public business \_rcad, the most
public of all affairs—and yet the most secret ! —the working of the machine of the Universe] for the space of six hours by day and six by night [the chronological import here is the only and
obvious one] to preclude rivalry.^ Numa was one of the four sons \jrad, cardinal points] of Pomponius. He was born on the day of the foundation of Ronie in spring [that is, the beginning of the year, the creation
of the Universe]. One of Numa's foursons was called Mamercus [clearly Mamers,
that is Majrs]. And surely we must never forget that if Numa was the second King of Rome, Romulus, who was the first, was the god Ouiririlis, and was the s on of Mars, the supreme god, and Rhea (Sylvia), who was clearly an avatar of the daughter of Ouranos and
Gaia, and who was also the mother of Zeu s. We are, in fact, " in the dead waist and middle " of the Cosmic gods. The year (of 365 days) was introduced by Numa [that is, he
initiated the revolution of the Universe]. His father was Pomponius, himself Pompilius, his daughter Pompilia, and one of his sons Pompo, in which one may venture to see the pompa or iro^iTri, the sacred solemn public procession of the gods, commemorating the highest of all processions, the
successive revolving of the hosts of heaven. There were pompilia
indigitamenta (Arnob. ii, 95). Plutarch said further that Numa's precepts came from the Pythagoreans ; but they were Universal. One was " When thou sacrificest to the celestial gods let it be with an odd number, and
when to the terrestrial with an even." This is also of the very
I dough's Plutarch's A'wwa, 129, 130, 13S, 152, 12S.

essence, root, and origin, of Chinese conceptions. The male yang
is odd, and the female yin is even. Days with odd numbers are strong, those with even numbers are weak. External projects should be kept for odd days, while
internal ones belong to even days.^ Sacrifices should be on the
odd days to the constellation Ma-tsu." The whole system of the Chinese radical philosophy is mapped-out in a sort of Memoria technica called the Ho-t'u Loh-shu, that is "the yellow (river)-plan and the Loh (river) writing." These are both heavens-rivers, as will be here abundantly shown for the Whang Ho. Now the central figure of this great numerical and symbolical chart is
•
• • • which is simply the confluence of the odd yang • • •
with the even yin * . This cross symbol of dots is found
(let it be parenthetically said) on Gaulish coins, on vases, on cylinder-heads, and on bronze nails of the lake-dwellings and Etruscan tombs ; on coins of Louis d'Outremer and Raimond de Tutenne, and even in the ornaments of the sacrifice-altars
of Mexico. It is impossible to separate these crossed dots, •
which on joining by lines become a cros^ ©-•-• from the •
analogous cross-symbol of the s_uastika, and both sources com
bined give us a remotest origin for the pre-Christian cross. Another of Numa's precepts was " when thou goest on a \t journey look not behind thee." This universal superstition has its supernal origin of the never retrograde motion of the revolving heavens. The next remarkable precept'' was " Turn round to pay adoration to the gods ; sit after you have worshipped." Plutarch hereon recorded (what must have ceased to be indubitable to him)
that the turning was said to represent the rotatory motion of the Universe. No wonder then that Numa used processions and
religious dances, as Plutarch stated (137). The legends about his Egeria resemble the Phrygian tales about Attis, the Bithynian about Herophile, and the Arcadian myths of Endymion. Egeria seems to have been a title of Juno as the midwife, and St. Augustine suggested that Numa's Egeria

was an embodiment of hydromantia or divination by water. She would thus have been a heavens-river goddess, before becoming a terrestrial perennial fountain. The meaning of Egeria (e-gero, to
bring forth or forward) would suit a supreme revolving-heavens goddess. That she was a mountain, that is a heavens-mountain, goddess is allowed.^ Numa's consort was Tatxa., daughter of Tat'in?, the Sabine, who was dual king (that is, god) with Romulus. One would like to connect this tat with stat and the Egyptian tat or dad. But etymology does not seem to see it. Others of her emblems were white robes and veils, a seal or a heart held in the hand, and the familiar Freemasonic pair of clasped
or hands made fast. The Roman archaic god Fjdius is clearly a duality of this idea.
This Mcdius was also called Modius and was miraculously conceived in the temple of Enyalian Mars ; founded and dwelt in the town of Cures (see " The Curetes ") ; left a son called Sabinus or Sabus, the first king (that is, god) of the Sabines ; and was also descended of the Sabines. [See what will be said of words in Sab- later.]
This son of Mars was named Cures, either from (his ?) pike, called Curis in the Sabine tongue, or else " from the name of the
genius who passed for his father" (Noel). This is just the deification of the weapon (sword or lance) which we find in the cases of the Japanese deity Futsunushi and of Ares himself A sense of the word Modius given by Isidorus Hispalensis- must not escape us ; he said it was the hole in which the mast (here the UniverseAxis) is stepped. Fidius was also called Fabidius (? the Bean-god)
which may, after all that has been said and done, give us the clue
(to be pushed home some other time) to the hitherto unexplained and most archaic superstitions about beans : such as that the flamen dialis could neither touch a faba nor even pronounce its name. It would be like Orpheus, the harmony-god, who makes the universe dance-round tabooing eggs because of the supreme sacred significance of the Egg of the Cosmos.

Here is the place to recall the fact that one of Numa's four sons
was Calpiis/ and that Calpe was one of the pillars of Hercules. The sacred Calpar wine must have a sacred connection ^\ith this. Pinus was the remaining son of Numa. Thence, perhaps, the rinarian priests (of Hercules ?). The pine was the tree of the all-mother Cybele, and of Sylvanus, that is.

Dancing.'] The Dance of the Stars. 7^3
The Dance of the Stars.
rHE "dance of the stars" was an ancient classic idea in
Greece and Rome. Plato in riiiucus spoke of the turnings
and dances of the stars —ra? ^o/aem? Kau Ta<i irapa/SoXa'i rcov
daripcov. Varro in Marcipor had :
Quum pictus aer fervidis late ignibus Coeli choreas astricas ostenderet.
Manilius too (i, 668) used the words signorumque choros, which are to be understood of the dance of the signs or constellations. Hyginus too (cap. xxii) : Pleiades existimentur chorcam ducere stellis, which is like the Zoroastrians calling the Great Bear the
leader of the stars in the North. And Horace (Odes, iv, 14) Pleiadum choro scindente nubes. The folklore about the sun ' dancing on Easter morning may well be a garbling of this idea. The word chorus seems originally to have meant a round dance, Hesychius making x^P^"^ equivalent to /cJ/cXo?.^ Tibulhis, again,
(ii, I, 88) makes the stars dance after their mother Night :
Jam Nox jungit equos, curmmque sequuntur Matris lascivo sidera fuh'a choro.
According to Aratos, the two other stars next the polar in tlie
Little Bear's tail were called xop^vrai, the dancers. Proclus has rather a curious passage (in Theol. Plat. t>67)
where enlarging upon the natures of the triad of great gods,
Zeus, Poseidon and Plouton, he says, "the first of these gods
governs the inerratic sphere, and its revolution ; the second
presides over the planetary spheres, and perfects their multiform
efficacious and prolific motions."In 1627 Peacham's Compleat Gcntlcnia7i still taught its students
that " The coelestiall bodies are the eleuen heauens and Sphceres. The eleuenth heauen is the habitation of God and his angels ; the tenth is the first mooner ; the ninth the christalline heauen ; the eight tb.e starry firmament; then the seven planets in their order" (i Saturn, 2 Jupiter, 3 Mars, 4 Sun, 5 Venus, 6 Mercury, 7 Moon). "The Imperiall Heauen is immoueable." [This seems to have been

an original confusion with the motionless Pole], " most pure
immense in quantitie and cleere in qualitie. The tenth Heauen or first mooner is also most pure and cleare, and maketh his reuolution in foure and twenty houres, carrying with the swiftnesse the other Heauens violently from East to West, from their proper
reuolutions, which is from West to East. The ninth or christalline heauen moueth, by force of the first mouer, first from E to W, then
fro W to E upon his owne poles, and accomplisheth his reuolution
in 36,000 yeares. The eight Heauen or glorious starry Firma
ment hath a threefold motion, viz. : from E to W in foure and
twenty houres, secundum primum Mobile ; then from W to E according to the motion of the ninth Heauen ; then sometimes to the S, and sometime towards the N, called motus trepidationis. Touching the motions of the Planets, since you may haue them in euery Almanacke, I willingly omit them" (pp. 58, 59). Lucian^ said that the people of India saluted the rising sun with a dance, in imitation of the dance of the god. This of course can
only refer to the (apparent) circular revolution of the sun. Irish 1
nurses still tell children that if they get up early enough on Easter
morn they will see the sun dancing. Dancing can even still be traced in connection with the worship on the housetops mentioned in the Old Testament ; for on the frontier of Franche-Comte, on
Twelfth Night—le jour des Rois— it is the custom to dance on the roofs in order, as the peasants now say, to obtain a good crop of hemp.^

Dancing?)^ The '^Dancing'' Der^vishes. 725
The "Dancing" Dervishes.
AS to religious dancing in Mahometanism, there are few who
have not heard of, and there are many who have seen the Mevlevi or " dancing dervishes." Before saying anything conclusive about them, I shall quote from Mr. John P. Brown's useful work on the Dervishes generally^ some account of their origin. Their founder was a native of Balkh, and was born A.D. 1226. Their sheikhs, or heads, are descendants of the prophet, and the office of head sheikh or general of the order is hereditary. On account of the connection of the order with the earliest Sultans of the Ottoman family, it frequently happens that the reigning Sultan becomes an honorary member of it, and sometimes attends its religious exercises. Turkish grandees follow their Sultan's
example, and those of them who are of this order never fail, when
alone, to take off their turbans, and put on the high Kulak or conical felt cap of the Mevlevi. The Mevlevi convents are better endowed than those any other order of dervishes, and inherit vast
lands given by the Seljucide sultans, and confirmed by the
Ottoman princes. Their high conical, pointed, unrimmed, felt bonnets are also
directed to the Zenith, while twirling rapidly to the right on
one spot. This pivoting is managed by a " step " in which the bare or stockinged left toes continue constantly to be placed and
replaced over the right, while the pivoting is done on the heels
almost without quitting the same spot. In this consists their
" dancing." The Mevlevi Dervishes, says Mr. Jno. P. Brown in his useful book, " move round from E. to W. " on the left foot, pushing them
selves round with the right, " in a quasi-mystic circle " ; the left
hand pointed to the earth, and the right upwards to the heavens,
in profound silence, mentally reciting their zikr^ which consists
simply in a continuous repetition of the one word " Allah !
"
When a postulant (Murid) is admitted to the path by the
Bektashi dervishes he stands on his left foot and presses the right
great-toe over the left one (p. 167).

726 The N ighi of the Gods. [Dancing:
" I have been told the custom refers to the harmonious movement of the Universe, and that the soft music of their order is symbohc of that of the spheres; but I am incHned to doubt it "
(p. 54). Mr. Brown also says "the singularity of their dance has nothing in common with that of the other societies " of dervishes :
and he thinks " it is probable that these innovations had their origin among Mussulmans in the sacred dances of the Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Romans of the Lower Empire " (p. 229). However that may be, Mr. Brown adds elsewhere from the Shekaik Nuiiidiiieh, and without comment of his own, that " the Mevlevi
are those who join together as brethren, and by the love of Allah, worshipping Him in a house of love, to the melodious sound of the
fljitc (nai), which expresses the harmony of his creation, revolve
round like his empyrean, dancing for joy, the result of their ardent desire to be united to him. Revolving round and round the Simakhana (dancings-hall) they free themselves from all unworthy passions " (p. 203).
It scarcely seems as if this can be invented ; it carries conviction with it as a traditional belief which must be quite pre-Ma
hometan. It should be noted that pre
liminary to starting for their spin, these
dervishes fold the arms on the breast in
the form of the suastika ; and that their pirouetting causes their full, long petti
coats to balloon-out in a conical form.
Petrie^ wrote of " the dancing festivals of
the Canaanite and other ancient nations in honour of the Heavens."
There is also a legend that the angel Jebrail (Gabriel) once brought some
good news to the Prophet, who from joy turned round like the Mevlevi, and
let fall his cloak. They all take off
their cloaks (khirkas) to " dance." Their
flute, the nai, open at each end, is peculiar to the Mevlevi, and many of the order play on it exquisitely, all
their music being soft, tender, and pathetic. The pipe or flute
' Simi] also means heavens ; selva sima, the seven heavens ; that is, presumably, the seven dancers. 2 F.cch-s. Arch., p. 15.

seems to represent the Universe-axis in Greek myth (see p. 48). The Mevlevi also on Sunday and Friday, repeat, seated in a circle, a prayer called the Ismi Jalal (name of Majesty), 1,001 times. This "prayer" is simply the one word Allah. It is odd, too, that the celebrated m)stic work the Mcthncvi Sherff, attributed to the founder of the Mevlevi, says that " the Beinsr who is above all
combination, all distinction, is a Tree without branches, or trunk, or roots to which the mind can be attached." The Kadiri and Khalveti dervishes take each other b)- the
shoulder and turn round in the hall of their convent, calling out Hai Allah, Living Allah. This is called the dewan, or turning
(Brown, pp. 104, 201). D'Ohsson gave this, which he called devr, dance or rotation, to the Kadiri, Rufai, Khalwetti, Bairami,
Gulsheni and Ushaki dervishes. Of my own observation I can state that the Rufai did not practice this when I saw them. They sat in a circle and swayed the body.
The " howling " of these Rufai dervishes seems to have its
_origin_Jn the shouting (hallel, tahlil) that accompanied sacrifice among the Semites, and may, says Prof. Robertson Smith, have been a wail over the death of the victim, though it ultimately took
the form of a chant of praise, hallelu-Iah^or. among the Arabs,
degenerated into a meaningless repetition of the word labbaika.' It may have been to drown the (human) victim's cries, or to make a concert with them. This theory would also account for the show
of self-mutilation and self-torture still practised by the Rufai.
The Peyadis, or dancers of Pey among the Shanars of Tine
velly, in their frantic movements, shouts, and (apparent) selfmutilation, approach closely to the Moslem howling dervishes.
They also wear " a high conical cap." This is quoted from " Demonolatry " in the Contemporary Revieio
(xxvii, 371, 374, 375). The article translates Pey (in Bottom's sense), writing devil in its stead. It also quite throws the reader out by its use of the English word God in such a phrase as nanc Sattya sami, which is paraphrased as " it is indeed I who am the
trnc God !'' When will missionaries (and others) give up these aberrations? One only wishes in \ain for vaore facts about Pc)-. The Hill Arians of the Western Ghats in Travancore also worship Pc)', who is male and female. The male is worshipped

Sacrifice is made, and a great feast follows. There is a Pella-Pey.
(Mr. A. F. Painter in Bombay Gazette Budget, nth April, 1890,
p. 23.) Pey ought to come from the same \-oo\. pa as pater and
father. I abridge an account of the dancing of the malawiyeh (Mevlevi)
derwishes at Tripoli in Syria, given by Capt. Conder {Heth and Moab, p. 65 sqq. ) : High cap of light-brown felt, in shape of
truncated cone—room opening to the air on the north—conical hats
—Right great toe placed over left one, with legs close together ; a very ancient attitude of contemplation in India and elsewherelong robes expanded into cones as they twirled—time of music a
slow waltz, revolutions 30 to the minute—motion ; a turning on sole
or heel of left foot, the right foot being brought round in front. " We could not doubt that the ancient dance we witnessed was
that of the Cabiri, the seven 'great ones' or planetary gods,
revolving round the centre of the terrestrial globe." The Malawiyeh are of Persian origin. Their mosque at Konieh containing the tomb of Hazret Moulana, their original leader. The position of their arms in twirling—left hand down, right hand raised[which I have connected with the axis on which the heavens seem to turn], Capt. Conder takes to typify the female and male elements in nature, merely. But this does not explain the position
of the arms ; for left is feminine, and right masculine, no matter what the position of the arms and hands. Elsewhere (p. 82) Capt. Conder notes that on the bronze plate found at Palmyra, the emblematic figures of the seven planets have "the right hand raised, the left lowered, as among the Derwishes." This I think must be scored up in favour of the axis theory. The phrase " with the sun," as indicating a direction, is, as I
have elsewhere noted, an extremely vague and bad one. A good
instance of this is that Capt. Conder says (p. 218), the Khonds of Eastern India in their worship perambulate circularly " with the
sun"; but (p. 68) he states that these dervishes spin against the sun on their own axes and at the same time revolve in an orbit
against the sun.



Dancing.^ The "Dancing'" Dervishes. 729
There are reckoned twelve original orders of Dervishes, but these have many branches. Altogether some say that there arc as many as sixty different orders, and others even a hundred, each
bearing the name of its founder. Some, such as the Vaisi, are said to be anti-Mahomet, and the Bektashi arc said to be "quite atheistic," while some of their branches are called " pantheistic." Though called Orders or Sects, in accordance with our Western
Customs, the proper title for their divisions is paths} tarigat. At
all events they believe in transmigration (hanasukh), and sacrifice a sheep at the admission of a postulant (Murid). Their mystic
ritual is clearly freemasonic. I. de Asboth- describes a dzikr of the howling dervishes at the Sinan thekia, or monastery, at Serajevo in 1882. When the half-circle of howlers had become frenzied, a lad sprung within it and began twirling round like a spindle with outstretched arms, and gazing upwards, ever quicker and yet more quickly. He grew paler and paler, and was soon as pale as death. His eyes closed when he had been spinning for " half an hour," and was " at the
rate of sixty evolutions {sic) per minute," one thought he must each
moment collapse. Loftus'' described the dancing of a dancing-boy at Hillah, near the ruin of Babylon, who began dervishlike to move slowly round on one spot, gradually increasing the speed as the music quickened, until at length he spun round with amazing velocity as though
fixed on a pivot. " Like dervises who turn as on a pivot," wrote Byron in Don Juan'' ; and thus too must the famous Chinese beauty of 18 centuries ago have danced. She called herself Chao, and was surnamed Fei-yen or Scudding Swallow, because of her lithe graces. Daughter of a musician, she was trained as a dancinggirl, led a life of pleasure, entered the Emperor's Seraglio, and
danced herself successively into the positions of leading concubine and Empress- Consort. Her skill was such that she could dance on
the palm of the hand, or in a bowl.'' A Korean dancing-girl at a Buddhist temple " began slowly to
revolve with her arms extended horizontally, after the manner of

a dancing dervish." " She soon reversed the motion." " A good
name for it would be the peg-top dance."^ I think there is no longer any room for doubt that all these religious ceremonies which we have been considering are like the adoration-wheel, the Kalmuck's rotator}' calabash, the tulasi and
other perambulations, including the Irish ailitJin\ a survival of
Polar-star worship, a ritualistic homage to the stupendous, overwhelming (apparent) revolution of the Heavens. Is it too " light fantastic " to surmise that all our modern " round " dances had an
identical origin ? And if they had, how strange to reflect upon the comparative rarity in these same modern round dances of the
anciently sacrilegious " reversing," which even at the present day is
still gibbeted, and even taught, under some such horrific byword as
ambipedipulation. Although it may serve to raise a smile at my own expense, I cannot refrain from here repeating the " religious
dancing " story of the )'oung hussar who, as many a soldier will do, had become suddcnl)' " converted." He was not at first quite
resigned to the surrender of all the joys of his unregenerate stage, and so, by way of making the best of both worlds, he suddenly in
the whirl of a w^altz asked his partner about her soul. " Oh," said
she promptly, " if you're going to talk like that, we had better sit down." This section may wind up by quoting from Dr. A. Reville's " Hibbert Lectures, 1884," a- very important passage for my present purpose : The dance was the first and chief means [this is perhaps over
strained] adopted by prehistoric humanity of entering into active
union with the deity adored. The first idea was to imitate the measured movements of the god, or at any rate what were supposed to be such. Afterwards this fundamental motive was more or less forgotten ; but the rite remained in force, like so many other
religious forms which tradition and habit sustained even when the
spirit was gone (p. 224). Perhaps I ought here to say that my conclusions were arrived at quite independently of Dr. Reville's ; and I am not aware that he has anywhere made even an allusion to the worship of the (apparently) revolving Heavens, and of their pivot the Polar-star, in connection with Dancincr or otherwise.

winged solar disk, the two extremities of
which rest upon baseless columns " (pp. 88, 90, 93). These columns deserve notice, and may be phallic as well as symbols of the
Pillar so often dealt with in this book. Creuzer said' that the globe surrounded with the serpent, or the circle or disk in the centre of which is a hawk-headed serpent, were emblems of Kneph or of Amen. And Guigniaut stated' that Creuzer
had discerned even before Young that the globe or disk flanked by two uraei serpents, winged (as on the temple-fronts) or unwinged, o-oes back to the supreme divinity Kneph-Agathodemon, as the Greeks called Khnum. Champollion the younger gave it specially to Thoth. Khnum, it should be remembered, is associated with Ptah, and is sometimes found moulding the cosmic Egg on a potter's- wheel out of matter furnished by Ptah. But it is more to my purpose that Theodule Deveria had
recoo-nized on the naos-cornices "the solar disk flanked by two wxTSA and by two eyes " as " symbols of the celestial spaces," adding
that " the winged disk has the same signification."* I can desire very little more when I find this accomplished and lamented
scholar bearing me company so far on the way to my generalisation of the emblem of the winged Sphere. There must be more than meets the eye in the following extract

sphere?^ The Winged Sphei^e. ^j^^Z
To Horapollon (of whom or of his odd-looking Greco-Egyptian name we know absolutely nothing) we owe the transcription ovpaio'i (Greek, ovpa, a tail) of the Egyptian word ara (araret)
, the name of the haje asp (/« . "This serpent," said he
(i, i) has the tail folded under the rest of the body ^^^. The
Egyptians call it ovpatov, the Greeks jBaaCkio-Kov, and its image in gold is placed on the heads of the gods." For that reason it was
worn by kings also. It was employed f/,. to determine the word
goddess, while god was written | (hatchet) or ^^. (hawk).
Placed over the basket i^^ , it " expressed domination over the
regions of the North" (pp. 556). Its head was an amulet. When two arau wearing the hats of the N. and S. are combined with the winged sphere (houd)
empire of the Universe is clearly signified vj
(pp. 187). <J De Rouge make a somewhat similar statement to the above elsewhere (p. 105) ; " the heavens of the N. and of the S. are represented by two crowned vipers." "An uraeus (ara) and a vulture with extended wings represent the heavens-goddesses of the N. and of the S.," says de Rouge.^ This is the only time I have met with this statement as to the ara. Again ; " The upper portion of the Egyptian stelae," said de Rouge,^ " is occupied by figures which generally have reference to the supreme deity under the form of the ^^^^^^^^^
solar disk adorned with two extended wings.
The divinity in that case bears the name of _Hat, g reat god , lord
of the heavens." [He calls it Hat, but Pierret's Dictionnaire (p.
187) gives Hout or Houd, <•> . Prof Ebers says Hut means wingexpander, and Mr. Wallis Budge informs me it is properly Behutet] At the top of a stela of the xiiith (?) dynasty de Rouge (p. JJ^ describes the same, accompanied by the two arau (uraji) " which represent the goddesses of the N. and the S." as having beside it the legend " Hat, great^god, ray of light, lord of heaven."

/J' The Night of the Gods. ^The
De Rouge's exposition (p. 71) that, " in the solar course directed
from E. to W., one of these extended wings [of the Sun] was directed towards the N., the other towards the S." must be a
late (as it is a lame) superfaetation of sun-worship. In describing
a stela in the style of Sais (p. 120) de Rouge calls it " the winged globe," \\liich approaches my theory that it is the winged sphere of the universe; and Layard {Monumeuts, ist series, plate 20) calls the similar Assyrian symbol the winged globe. The
winged sphere with ura:^i is also found sculptured in relief on the vaulted ceiling of the monolithic Phoe
nician cella or shrine at Ain el Hayat.^ The North side of the pylone at Karnak,
the abode ofAjneru shows in high bas-relief an unmistakable
sphere~flarn<edby two arau, and winged. The fact that when the wings are omitted they are replaceable
(and replaced) by the uja ^^§ eyes of the N. and of the S.
confirms the theory that the sphere is the Universe-sphere of the heavens, when it is understood that the eyes are (as I venture to think is in this inquiry part-proved) the motionless points of the
Universe-axis. There are instances where one wing is replaced by an eye, the other wing remaining on the sphere, as in a stela
of the 1 8th dynasty (Louvre: Notice, 106). v^ " The name of the Sun," said de Rouge,^ " varied according to y/ the diverse places where it was adored " [It would be much safer
^ to say that the Sun drew to itself the various names of divers local gods.] " Thus at Edfu the Sun was called Hout, and that is the , name which it receives ordinarily in the winged disk which I decorates the summit of all temple doors." Of course I demur to)
the unqualified assertion that Hout (properly ^^2ZdlX^^ Behutetfls'lhe Sur[ But here we have the

infernal region."' Elsewhere, however, " the serpent expresses by its undulations the route of the Sun traversing the region of souls." The Stoic Cleanthes was of opinion that the sun " described a spiral when departing from the equator towards the N. and towards the S."^ Can this perhaps be the same conception ?] In the Popol Vuh there was in the beginning nothing but water and the feathered serpent or serpent-bird, Ouetzalcoatl, so far as / the Quiches knew. I am happy to find myself in some agreement with Capt. Conder" in the opinion that in these matters " old-fashioned authorities *' are not to be despised and disposed of in the lump, as mere " 2d. a lb." stuff. One such investigator of the old school
was Stukeley, and in his Abiiry'' the following passage deserves disinterment and separate preservation :
" When these ancient patriarchal temples came to be perverted to idolatry, they consecrated many of them to the Sun, thinking their round form ought to be referred to his disc ; and that these pyramidal stones set in a circle im.itated his rays. And had the ancient Greek writers seen our temples of Stonehenge and the rest they would have concluded them dedicated to the Sun. "These temples of ours are always of a round form, yet there are three manifest diversities which I have observed, regarding that threefold figure by which the ancients expressed in writing the great
idea of the deity. This figure by Kircher is called ophio-cyclopterygo-morphus. 'Tis a circle with wings, and a snake proceeding from it. " I. The round temples simply, I call temples ; 2. Those with the form of a snake annext, as that of Abury, I call serpentine temples or dracontia, by which they were denominated of old ; 3, Those with the form of wings annext, I call alate or winged temples."'
[Proceeding in a straight line from Thebes to Glisas, said Pausanias (ix, 19), you will see a place surrounded with chosen
stones, which the Thebans call the head of the serpent. I. O'N.] Then he proceeds to describe alate temples on the banks of the Humber near Barrow (p. 92), at Navestock Common in Essex (p. 96), and in Cornwall (" the Hurlers," p. 97). Again Stukeley interprets Rowldrich in Oxfordshire, where a stone temple exists (called " Rollerich stones" by Camden) as

" Rholdrvvyg, which means Druid's wheel ox circle'' (p. lo). And
then he cites the case of Joshua (iv, 20) pitching the 12 stones in the form of a wheel (gilgal),and caps it by citing Joshua v, 9, where
the place is said to be called Gilgal because of the rolling away of
reproach. Things changed afterwards, for we find in Hosea (xii, 11; ix, 15 ; i^) 15) that the Jews were forbidden to go to Gilgal, where bullocks were sacrificed, and where all wickedness was ; where they
multiplied transgressions, and were sure to go into captivity as
surely as Bethel was to come to nought (Amos iv, 4 ; v, 5). After
these passages I think we are justified in reading i Samuel vii, 16, as meaning that Samuel performed circular-worship at the wheeltemple and the stone-god and the sacred tower when " he went
from year to year in circuit to Gilgal and Bethel and Mizpeh." He " called the people together unto the Lord to Mizpeh " (the tower), and the terrible sanctity of the place among the sanguinary
Israelites may be but too well seen in Judges xx and xxi, where the cold-blooded slaughter of the men, women, and children of Jabesh-Gilead, and the enslavement of 400 maidens, was perpetrated because " they came not up to Mizpeh to the Lord."
To return to Stukeley. He suggests (p. 11), or rather he
doubts not, that the altar which Moses built with twelve pillars under Mount Sinai (Exod. xxiv, 4) was such a circular work as our stone circles, and (p. 25) that the gable-end of a house was so-called from gabal, which we find in Elagabalus. The Semitic root gabal means lofty, as I have before pointed out (p. 94), and
the gable-end also displayed the sacred wheel (p. 659). I must say
that this derivation of gable, a word which, in nearly resembling forms, is universal throughout Europe, seems a much more
possible and sufficing one than that from the Irish gabJial, a fork, which is nothing but a shot, and a blank shot besides. I must, too, claim as a leading symbol of the leading heavens
god—that is of the Polar deity—the " dotted ball with expanded
wings" found by Loftus at the Susa ruins. He described his find^ as moulded composition bricks in a ruined wall, with glazed coloured figures and designs in high relief, the colours being much
varied and in a good state of preservation. Among the smaller
figures was frequent " the symbol of the Deity—a dotted ball with

expanded wings." This ball, it seems to me, can be nothing else
but the celestial sphere, and its " dots " the constellations. I beg to submit that it is strong evidence that the " winged disk " (which one sees so often surrendered to the Sun) was originally a symbol of the flying of the heavenly sphere round the pole. There is an engraving of a similar symbol in Rawlinson's Great Monarchies,^ taken from an Assyrian cylinder, where the "Sphere" seems to me to be sensibly ovoid. If this be really so, we have the Egg of
the Universe, and a notable support of what will be said about it
later.
The following " literal translation " by Sir Monier Williams
from the Isa Upanishad—the only upanishad " not written by
men "— seems to me clearly to refer to a Polar celestial deity
There is one only Being who exists Unmoved, yet moving swifter than the mind ; Who far outstrips the senses (?), though as gods They strive to reach him, who, himself at rest, Transcends the fleetest flight of other beings ; Who, like the air, supports all vital action. He moves, yet moves not.
This passage is extraordinarily close to Sanchoniathon's description
of Il-Kronos and his wings (p. 748), And the wings are not confined to the sphere itself, or to its pivot ; they are also found combined with the world-tree emblem upon which I have already so much insisted. Such is no doubt the winged oak over which Zeus threw a magnificent veil, on which were represented the stars, the earth, and the ocean. This myth was taken by Pherecydes of Syros from Phoenician books. The Universe is thus conceived of as an immense tree, furnished with wings to indicate its rotatory motion ; its roots plunging into the Abyss, and its extended branches upholding the display of
the veil of the firmament.An important variety of the winged sphere is that of the frieze of the great temple (of Hathor) at Dendera. The sphere or " disk " is generally painted red, and the wings are multicoloured.
The hieroglyphic sentence, " Great God, Lord of the Upper region," accompanies it. The wings here would seem to assume and

Gebeil.^ The serpents have become conventionahsed —are turned
to stone, in fact — but the sphere still continues a true ball. This symbol in Phoenicia thus filled the same supreme position on the r lintels of doorways that it held in Egypt, and this should be i compared with the frontispiece of Vol. I. For further examples, there are the door of Um-el-Awamid (Renan, pi. 52 ; Per. and Chip. iii. 126) and a votive stela of Carthage (Crespi : catalogo pi.
2
; Per. and Chip. 253). This other model, which omits the
serpents, but has a triple topknot, comes from the top of a Cypriot
Phoenician funeral stela. But another form still, in which the wings disappear, but the serpents remain, with a developed topknot, was found by Renan, also
at Um-el-Awamid (^Mission, pi. 55). And to these must be added (for topknot and serpent-changes) this Carthaginian Tanit votive stela, from the Bibliotheque Nationale (Per. and Chip, iii, 127, 128).
The topknot is three balls in one case, and taking the four last examples, and combining them with the feather head
dress of the Pataikoi (which see), we seem
to cret the same idea as in the featherhats of Egyptian deities and the Princeof-Wales' plume. Is the whole concep

some divine bird ? In the last instance

Layard called a " winged disk or globe ") which occurs at Bavian, in company of the wheel and the seven stars, over the head of an Assyrian Monarch. For comparison another, which displays the bird's legs, is added from an Assyrian cylinder found at Koyunjik, where it floats over a conventional artificial sacred
tree, the fish-god Dagon grasping one of the claws.
(Perhaps an indication of the intercessory office and power of Dagon or Cannes, the mediator ?) It is not impossible that the nucleus of the winged symbol may here represent the Cosmic Egg^ or Eye.
A very conventional winged object, where the ring seems to take the place of the bird's head, is seen at the
summit of the " Hittite" (?) stela from Birejik in the Brit. Mus.'' Another form of the same symbol from PerscpoHs is to be seen in plate 41 of Ouseley's Travels and yet another analogous emblem is added from an Assyrian
standard copied by De Beaumonf* from Layard, and by me from De Beaumont. Perhaps in this suppression of the human figure
we have that rebellion against idolatry found later on in Islam.

The Man-Bird-God.
FLENORMANT mentions the "symbolic image of the
Supreme god, that is a winged disk surmounted (or not) by a human bust," which is often found on Assyrian bas-reHefs and on Babylonian and Assyrian cylinders, above a mysterious and sacred plant which is frequently guarded by celestial genii,
and sometimes adored by royal personages.^ This plant is, of
course, the Universe-tree.
The royal cylinder of Sennacherib exhibits above a sacred tree a crowned human torso issuing from a circle which has a bird's wing, extended feet, and fanned tail.
On each side of the central figure another
bust issues from the wing, giving us a
triad. Layard describes it as a "winged
figure in a circle, here represented as a triad with three heads " ; and he adds
" the mythic human figure with the wings
and tail of a bird, inclosed in a circle,
was the symbol of the triune god, the supreme deity of the Assyrians and of the Persians, their suc
cessors in the empire of the East."- A similar but single figure
is given by Mr. Dosabhai Framji in his History of the Parses, apparently as a type of Ahura Mazda. Here is another, and apparently imperfect, symbol which is given in the Empire of the Hittites from one of Schlumbcrger's terra-cotta seals. I know not whether
it is to be taken for a winged man, or rather a man
bird ; the reverse of the seal exhibits a galloping winged-horse (or mare) with the wings outspread a Hittite Pegasus.
I add one more, taken from an ancient white agate cylinder with cuneiform writing in Ker- Porter's Travels (plate 80).

Ancienne (Flandin and Coste) ; also in Perrot and Chipiez's La
Perse, p. 814, figs. 480 and 392 ; to these should be added the tailpiece of their ch. 5. In the Persepolitan fig. 480, one hand of
the god is extended, the other holds, like a large knuckle-duster, a
ring (the chakra }). In the palace of Xerxes at Persepolis is, on one of the walls of
the apadana, tlie king on a high throne, and in the centre of the canopy overhead is "the winged emblem of Ahura-Mazda" (Dieulafoy). This " symbolic figure of Ormuzd, with his winged disk, is a reproduction of the similar divine figure so often seen hovering over the king and his soldiers on the Assyrian bas-reliefs." " Ormuzd is often represented on the monuments of the Acha;menid dynasty ; he has the form of a man crowned with the tiara,
and enclosed in a winged disk." [In this case it is clearly an
annular flat rim. and not a disk.— I. O'N.] It will be seen that the supreme winged symbol was intruded by the Achemenides, and to be at all tolerated by the Mazdeans, who had no idols, statues of gods, or representations of them, must have been regarded as supremely holy and significant indeed. " In the sculptures of a royal tomb at Nakhsh i Rustam we see a king in adoration before Ormuzd and a fire-altar." In the rock-caverns near Persepolis is to
be seen Darius and " opposite him is a lighted fire-altar and the image of Ormuzd " [M. Babelon has here wholly failed to grasp the leading fact that the winged man-wheel-bird is not " before " or " opposite," but always without exception in the uppermost central
sky of the picture or sculpture.— I. O'N.]. On the cylinder of Darius (Brit. Mus.) is "the disk of Ormuzd hovering in the air"
above the king in his chariot. The seal of Artaxerxes Mnemon (Louvre), from Susa, shows " the winged disk " (which again seems to be a ring) '' of Ormuzd " above the medallion of the king, which has for guardians or heraldic supporters a pair of winged sphinxes, with head-dresses like the Egyptian pschent
(or skhent) xf , with the uraeus (not the lituus) in front.^ There
was clearly a good deal of assimilation or absorption of foreign
divine ideas, a sort of theological syncresis going on, at all events
in court circles, at this time. It must be remembered too that these divine emblems arc found on royal tombs, while a true

Mazdean could not have a tomb ; it was a damnable abomination
to defile the earth with his corse, which had to be exposed to
beasts and birds of prey. On every side, therefore, it is likely
that this emblem of Ahura, if it be Ahura at all, was a foreign, a
heretical, importation. An Assyrian woman-bird found at Van may be seen in figs, loi and 1 02 of Babelon's Manual} It clearly exhibits
the ring, seen also in the man
wheel-bird. It is bronze, and is
now called " a sort of Siren."
It is clearly the central supreme
goddess. Here is an outline of
its back, with a central loop for suspension, so that it might seem to soar overhead, no doubt. I add the wings and eagle-head of another four-winged manbird which is one of the " supporters " of the sacred tree on an
Assyrian bas-relief (Louvre), and I draw attention to the four-winged man-gods at pp. 92 and 93 of^ Mr. Babelon's handy and valuable Manual. In all
these cases it will be seen that two wings are erect and two depressed ; and in considering this arrangement, it is not easy to avoid the conclusion that, so far as wings are concerned, the Sanconiathon fragment which describes Thoth's statues of Kronos
(see p. 748) must have been written from some such statues. This is how Cyrus is represented (apud M. Dieulafoy) in the bas-relief which is " the most ancient Persian sculpture known," and the conical -capped but otherwise nude " Hittite " Ashtoreth found at Carchemish has but two wings.^ A rare form of Anepu (Anabis) gives him the trunk of a bird, the legs and arms of a man, the head of a "jackal," and the equipment of an archer.' This is clearly a heavens-god, whether Anabis
or no.

and ^-=^ . It will be observed that the sun is neither O nor O
here. We may detect the germ of our persistent term of the " aquiline " nose in the accompanying upturned face of the winged man-god-bird Garuda, embraced protectively by Hanuman the ape-man-god.-' Another face is added from a wanged Garuda upholding Vishnu. The beak of the raptorial bird is
clearly put into the god's nose. One text of the Rig Veda (Wilson's, ii, 143) makes ^'1^ Indra himself a bird. It runs as follows: "They have
r^f styled Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Agni ; and He is the celestial well-winged Garutmat." Besides giving the wings (of Kronos) to the supreme Indian heavens-god, this passage '* also supports my contention elsewhere that Mitra was not originally the Sun-god, but a form of the supreme central heavens-deity. The Irish god-Druids (see p. 350) and Mog Ruith ( = slave-of
the-wheel) in particular are described soaring in the air by means of a simple pair of wings put on and off at pleasure.^ They are thus gods of the Winged-Tree. The Volundr or Wayland Smith of the Norse Edda is clearly both an axis and a revolving god. He loses the use of his feet,^
which simply fixes him to one, the central axial, position ; and he tlien makes himself efficient wings, which are those of the winged sphere. I know of no other supposition for reconciling the two mystic facts ; and this supposition does so perfectly. The identification of Hephaistos and Daidalos by some ancient authors'*
is thus too no longer a puzzle. Among the " savage " curiosities in the British Museum may be
seen (in the case labelled : "New Ireland, 36"-— 28th Jan. 1890) a whole pantheon of large wooden god-images taken from a temple in the large island of Tombara, to the East of Papua or New Guinea. With these very strange, elaborate, and apparently unique idols, which are painted in parti-colours, chiefly red and white, may also be seen spread-winged birds with beaks like toucans and ibises. These too are formed in wood and painted in a conventional manner to represent feathers. But strangest of all is a large divine man-bird, with extended wings and tail, wherein the god

squats not in a circle but in a sort of scroll or banderolle. It is
almost absurdly odd to find the two Eyes of the Egyptians also paralleled by two glass eyes fixed to two wooden struts in front of the wings. The identity with the conception of the Assyrian, Persian, and Egyptian symbols, is astonishing and undeniable. The Eyes on the coffin of King Antef (nth dynasty) in the Louvre^ are encrusted in enamel. A statue of the 5th or 6th dynasty shows eyes of opaque white quartz with a pupil of trans
parent rock-crystal let-in, and a little metallic point in the crystal.
The eyes of a lion-ornament (?) are in glass-paste, with a leaf of metal. This discovery of the winged man-god and the Eyes in New
Ireland, has induced a search—very superficial as yet—for similar Egyptian or West Asiatic coincidences. The boomerang of Australia was clearly known in Egypt. It was a curved bit of
heavy hard wood »—--• which was flung at long-necked water-fowl. Sport of this kind is often the subject of monumental paintings.
A leading case in the representation of these winged deities is the great fight between Bel and the Dragon, that is between Merodach or Marduk and Tiamat the demon of Bahu (Hebrew, Bohu) the Deep, the Ocean, or chaos, which is also mentioned at p. 85. A piece of sculpture in the British Museum gives the forms of the combatants as
here shown (p. 746) by the kind generosity of Mr. Wallis Budge, who has already given them in his Babyhmian
Life and History.
It is thus natural that the evil, the
fallen, as well as the good powers of the heavens should be winged. A bronze 4-winged figure in the Louvre is
said to be (from a cuneiform inscription upon it) " the demon of the S.W. wind." If so, (and the quarter of the compass may have been evil) the two pairs of wings must have been extended to the evil gods.

This figure seems to be connected with another in the De Clercq collection which backs (and looks over the front of) a bronze plaque, the designs on which M. ClermontGanneau takes to be " the Assyrian hell," but which appear to be
heavenly, funereal, and infernal ;
containing in the upper stratum or compartment the winged sphere side by side with the 8-spoked wheel, both being flanked with other emblems. In the second compartment is a row of Seven i long-robed figures, one arm up and ^^'^^ ^""^ one down, each owning the head of some animal. "These are
the heavenly genii called Igigis." They may parallel the Seven Kabirim. The plaque is engraved in Mr. Babelon's book.^ As to the 4- winged animal-god or jinni whose back we see as he looks
over the plaque, his face is that of a leopard, his body that of a
dog, and his hind legs those of a large raptorial bird.

MUST here comment more fully than has yet been done
upon the symbolic representation of the Phcenician ll—the Kronos of Philo—which was given by the Phcenician Sanconiathon : "Taautos, that is Thoth, . . . imagined for Kronos the
insignia of his royalty: four eyes before and behind, of which two
are in repose and shut " [while the two others are open], " and on
his shoulders four wings, two raised and two lowered, to express symbolically that Kronos saw sleeping, and slept awake," [which has been dealt with under " The Eye of Heaven " ;] "and in the same way the positions of the wings show that he flew in repose, and reposed in flying." [Just the symbolism for the Polar Power whirling the heavens round, but ever reposing himself at the
motionless centre of motion.] " He had also two wings on the head." " To the other gods Taautos gave two wings on the shoulders,
as accompanying Kronos in his flight—ox? r]ri avvLTrravro r^y Kpovw.'
[These would be other heavenly stellar gods, gods of the revolving firmament, which never rests ; and they therefore were figured
without the furled wings of Kronos.] Thoth, as the designer of the idols of Kronos, must be viewed
as our own embodiment Art—that is art religious.
These considerations are important for my purposes, but they
will lead us farther afield.
In the first place the four shoulder-wings —two raised and two
lowered—exhibit a most striking likeness to the Kerubim of t\v2 Merkabah of Ezekiel (i, 6 ; x, 2i) which have the same number
of wings—two raised and two extended on the quarters ; and this contributes another argument for regarding the cherubs (see p. i86)
as powers of the celestial sphere, stellar gods or genii, in the sacred
astrology of the dim past. The gate of Asgard is guarded by two ganns, wolf-dogs, called Gifr and Geri. Geri is also the name of one of Odinn's dogs, and
Gifr indicates power to fly. Odinn flies through the air with his dogs high above the earth. One of the Asgard dogs always watches, while the other sleeps.^ Here are the ideas of the eyes

sphere.^ The Wings of Kronos. 749
and wings of Kronos and of the heavens-beasts again under other
forms. [I fancy that the self-same idea, but with wheels taking the place of wings, is to be found in the " obscure " passages of the Rig Veda (iii, 357 ; i, 78) in an address to that mysterious duality the Aswins : " You have arrested one luminous wheel (vapuschakram) of the car for illumining the form (irma ? the creation)
while with the other you traverse the spheres (to regulate) by your power the ages of mankind " ; which are expounded to mean
" the divisions of time in general." ^
The wings at the shoulders, head, and heels of Mercury clearly
range themselves in the same category, and the wings of his caduceus seem to me to go very near to making it the Universe
axis. (See the fuller remarks on p. 53.) The Korean black court-hat is " in the form of a rounded cone
terraced in front. On either
side project wings like
gigantic ears." The king's
hat is somewhat similar, but
is dark blue, and the wings
are " fastened behind, as if
folded in rest." Again it has " a high oval crown*
with a step in it half-way up," and it fits tightly over the forehead,
from a photograph. It seems to me noteworthy enough to find this idea of supple mentary wings still extant in a 12th century manuscript of the Hortus Deliciariuu, in the Strasburg library. They belong to a pigeon, or dove as we have got into the habit of calling it ; and the accompanying figure was given by Didron in his Icono

to be trite to refer all the Egyptian " disk "-bearing deities to a similar heavenly spherical symbolism. Among the Herculaneum paintings is found a series of medallions which are assigned to the planets in the order of the week-days which they have named. But it always seems to be forgotten, or thrown into the back-ground,
that the deities flourished for awful ages before their fallen names
were given to the planets. The first of these medallions represents
'Saturn with his apTrr), or scythe, in his proper rank as first of the gods and owner of the first day of the week. A graving said to
be Etruscan^ represents him winged, with his scythe rested on a globe or sphere, the well-known type of the supreme deity of the Universe which has now fallen so low that it is relegated to old Time with his hour-glass in the comic almanacks. A medal of Elagabalus, struck at Heracleain Bythinia, affords the same design. A fine cornaline in the museum of Florence represents a half-nude
Saturn (?) seated at the prow of a vessel, his scythe in the right
hand. Behind him rise the walls of a city wherein is seen a
temple. The city is perhaps the celestial city, and the temple is the palace which we have so often seen in these pages. The position of Kronos here as pilot is of importance when viewed in connection with what is elsewhere advanced (p. f) as to the Cabiri. Capt. Conder" calls the Phoenicians a "stock of hardy
sailors who were the first to learn to sail by the pole-star" ; but he
cites no authority for this statement.

Divine Birds.
THE most sacred religious bird with the Egyptians seems to
have been the bak, the hawk ; which I presume we must take, chmate for chmate and species for species, to represent the
Roman imperial eagle of Jove. In another direction, the Greek
name for the hawk, Ikpa^, is sufficiently indicative of a consecrated character. Poseidon and Hermes, both first-rates, each of them changed Hierax into a hawk ; the Ocean-god (in a foolish myth) because Hierax supplied wheat to the Trojans ; and Hermes because Hierax (the hawk itself of course) woke up Argos (the heavens) while Hermes was stealing, for Zeus, a heifer. The hawk was especially the bird of Ra ; Ra was hawk-headed, and was the supremest, all-embracing Universe-god ; the gods themselves were (according to one view) merely so many impersonations of his various attributes.
The whole conception of the divine bird springs from the idea of motion in the heavens, in the atmosphere ; the fleshly type of
which was the flight of the noblest birds—the hawk and its congeners ; and its divine manifestation was in the motion of the
universe, in the unresting flight of the winged___Krgnos, the El or fl of Sanchoniathon. Mr. Frederick Greenwood^ writes of that born observer of Nature the late Richard Jefferies : "He was not in the least afraid to say (though whether he did so in print I
forget) that he had discovered in the hawk's ascending flight— (a
sweeping spiral flight, in which the wings do not seem to beat at
all)—a distinct law of motion unknown to the philosophers ; and I
fancy a learned duke has since discoursed on the same theme." This is a valuable fact for me. No one would dream of accusing Jefferies of symbolic mysticism ; his evidence on the point is as natural and spontaneous as spring water. In a generation of
Egyptian gods later than Ra, the jia\vk lias_desc end ecLto_Jiorus, to whom also then belongs the winged-sphere ("discj^f the sun "
as it is generally called) with the ara^ serpents. The hawk is
obviously proper to gods, to the male principle ; for the vulture on the other hand is sacred to the female principle.- I have here

^"^"^ Idllii/r"^^^ imperial bird. In any case it clearly seems
a dual bird with double body as well as
two heads, and probably conveys the common notion of divine
duality merely. The same Austrian spread-eagle may be seen, surrounded by four elephants, on a gold coin from the collection of Tippoo Sahib
in Moor's Hindu Pantheon, plate 103. [The Reader must also be referred to the important discussion of the Eagle and the Vermilion Bird under the heading of the Four
Living Creatures, p. 185.] The most primitive shape of the chief god of the Blackfellows,
Pund-jel, is that of an eagle-hawk, and he and the antagonistic crow between them created everything.^ Yehl the god of the North American Thlinkeets, according to Bancroft, is a raven or flies in a crane's skin. Odin had his hawk-skin. This raven or
a crow created for the Thlinkeets, while a hawk, a crow and a teal did the same for the Yakuts. The hawk was an Aztec messenger of the gods. Among the Canaris men descend from a beautiful bird with the face of a woman. Aristophanes was far from romancing when he said birds were the oldest of gods. In the (Greek) Osiris myth Isis became a swallow to seek round the world, without resting, the body of the god ; light flashed from her feathers. The Thlinkeet Yehl stole fire for men, in his form of a
heavens-bird, the crane, he brought in his beak a burning brand which dropping on stones and sticks gave them the fire which is
still got out by rubbing or striking.'' In the Torres Straits Kusa
Kap, the gigantic fabulous bird, brings a burning stick (moii) to
his mother, who then invents cookery.^ Yehl also stole water for man from the evil Khanukh, just as Odin in bird-form stole Suttung's mead, or the hawk Gayatri brought the soma from
heaven. The Gallinomeros of Central California theorised that in the

primeval darkness the hawk and the coyote made two balls of inflammable things. The hawk then flew up with them into the heavens and lit them with flint-sparks/ and they became the Sun and Moon. Here we have Egg, (see p. t) hawk, Egyptian scarab
and fire all together.
The Egyptian goddess Mut (= Isis = Hathor = mother) was represented by a vulture, or as vulture-headed ; a vulture-cap was worn by Isis, and according to the Egyptian belief the vulture had no male, and so produced its young by parthenogenesis.
The Vulture ^\ is the symbol of maternity. It writes the
word mother, as well as that of the Theban goddess Maut ^^^
Horapollon (i, ii) said V\ meant mother or heaven. Maut wore
thehatoftheN.and S. Xy which would mean both hemispheres of
the heavens, and a Vulture-skin or a brooding Vulture seems sometimes to be identified with her head, the wings forming her cap. But Nekheb, the goddess of the S., is at times a vulture,
and a vulture over a basket indicates sovereignty of the S. The vulture and the hawk were both graven (with the winged sphere or the scarab) on the back of the sacred ichneumon. The vulture must thus be connected with the central divine winged bird, and thus we obtain a very lofty sacred sanction for
the Parsi devotion of their dead as food for vultures. The Parsis
still carry vultures for their dakhmas to places where they are
scarce." Of course, too, the soul in its becoming a bird would be helped on by being swallowed up and assimilated by a bird. The notable Chaldsean vulture stela in the Louvre, on which
the names of the kings indicate a date circa B.C. 2500, exhibits a flock of vultures flying away with human heads, hands, and arms in
their beaks.* The star-name Altair, for Aquilae, is really Al-nasr al-tair, the
flying vulture, and not the eagle. It is odd that Vega, that is Al-vakah, more correctly and in full Al-nasr-al-waci, " the falling
vulture," is on its way to become the polestar. In some 12,000
years or so it will be within 5° of the pole.

In Mexican legend the Wok, or serpent-eating hawk, is the
messenger of Hurakan, " the heart of heaven," and of the lightning
and the thunder which are the signs of Hurakan,^ who was also
called "heart of the sea" and "centre of the earth": all names
which correspond to the Navel.
I think that the natural selection of hawks, eagles, vultures, and such other birds of prey, was influenced by their habits of soaring
and hovering. Of course their superior general powers of constant, rapid, and facile flight, which make them almost denizens of the sky, would help ; but the hovering all but motionless seems to me to be the point of contact with the motionless centre of the winged
heavens-sphere,^ It should be kept in view also that the Chinese ritualistic view
of the hawk m^ade it sacrifice its prey.'' Other animals of prey
were said to sacrifice to the supernal powers also—as the otter (its fish) and the wolf. It might be added that the swallow, whose
powers of flight are even more striking at first sight than those of any bird of prey, and which works the air sometimes at immense heights, does not appear much among the heavens-birds, but the
pigeon (another bird of great flight- powers) does ; perhaps in its character of messenger. The swallow's somewhat evil repute
might connect it with the shooting stars and the pairkas (p. 90). The widespread idea of the souls of men becoming birds must perhaps have sprung from the belief that they joined the winged
choir of gods, genii, angels, and so forth, who fly round as and
with the heavens-deities. It is besides a fantasia upon the same ever-strong human desire which is put in words in the title of Nadar's well-known booklet,
Le Droit dc Voter. Man wants to leave his planet-prison. It is a
constant blasphemous rebellion in fact, like high spirits and
muscular irritability, against the divine force of gravitation. Augury by the flight of birds must have had a similar heavenly origin, and we should remember that in making his temple Math his rod or lituus the first thing the Augur did was to face or to place his back to the North (see p. 431). In the Egyptian funereal papyri it is common to see the souls depicted over each personage

sweet voice.^ Two of the symbols on the Siamese Buddha's footprint are a Kinon or Kinara, half man and half bird, and a Kinari which is
half bird, half woman.'' The Hindu demons, the man-eating Rakshasas, keep their souls in parrots. According to the Chaldean tablets, the first monstrous generation of men was bird-headed, and was developed in the bosom
of Chaos,'* We find the same idea in the cosmogony credited to Cannes by the Berosus fragments. In the primeval waters and darkness were engendered marvellous two-winged men, of whom some had four wings and two faces, one body and two heads, male and female, each possessing the organs of both sexes.'' " Their images," and those of many other monstrosities or symbolic and mythical combinations, " were to be seen in the temple of Bel," and doubtless now exercise our own gaze in the Assyrian and Babylonian monuments and cylinders. This was what gave Phoenicia, says Prof. Robertson Smith, its cherubim Griffins and Sphinxes." When the Mexican Earth is burnt, in the second age of Tletoniatiuh (sun of Firej, men are all to be changed into birds, and

as Zarathushtra (Zoroaster) ; and later the tri-natured Saena-bird, Simurgh,^ became the incarnation of Supreme Wisdom {Ze?id
Avesta, \, Ixxviii ; ii, 203). The bird Khamrosh every year strips the tree Harvisptokhm of its universal seeds. Tishtrya, the star,
then scatters them with the rains to all regions.^ There can now, I presume, be but little doubt that the rukh or roc of the Arabian Nights is the story-teller's form of the same

De Saulcyi said the Arabian rokh might be the last syllable of an Assyrian word nesrokh, almighty eagle, the primordial divinity of the Assyrian theogony. But nasr in Arabic is a vulture. In Malayan ruwak-ruwak means a bird of prey. I think we may also, without being too fanciful, retrace the
central Bird in the Princess Parizade's Talking Bird in Galland's Arabian Nights. The Bird is on the top of a mountain, which
has to be laboriously climbed to attain it ; and it is in company with the Singing Tree, whose leaves chant a perpetual harmonious concert, and the gold-coloured Yellow Water, which incessantly
boils up in a great fountain-jet, and ever falls back in its basin
without overflowing it. Here, doubtless, we have the World-tree,
the music of the Spheres, and the Heavens-river. Aengus and his consort Caer as a pair of swans flying thrice round the Lake ; the bird-maidens of Emain and of the fairy mansions of Connacht silver-chained in pairs ; the pair of birds
joined by a chain of red gold in the myths of Cuchulainn,- are all Irish heavens-bird deities. The most
beautiful of these world-birds has a golden
necklace, from which thrice fifty golden balls depend by golden chains. The sacred brazen melek-taoush or king-peacock (?) taken about by the Kawals or priests of the Yezidis (who have been loosely called devil-worshippers) was, I
believe, first figured in Layard's Nineveh and Babyton (pp. 47, 48). Like the gold
feathered, glittering - plumaged cock Vidofnir, who perches on the topmost bough
of Yggdrasil,'' I claim it for the divine bird on the summit of the Earth-axis, and draw
attention to the likeness of the stand to the seven-branched candlesticks shown at p. f. The great standard brass lamps in the Indian Museum (14,987 and 14,988) have 19 peacocks (three tiers of six, plus one atop) which much resemble this Yezidi-bird.

There is also in the Museum a Bombay lamp for 9 wicks, surmounted by a peacock, which is like the Yezidi-bird and its stand.
This Yezidi bird has also a resemblance to another bird on an Assyrian standard, which is here copied from De Beaumont,' who confesses his indebtedness to Layard. (See also the Chaldean standard-eagle
at p. 753-) On a Babylonian contract-tablet,
the seal of one Kiribtu gives us a priest standing before an altar,
over which a cock is perched on the top of a pole." This was in
or about B.C. 753, when Rome was a-building. [I hope no one, flinging a gibe at the writer here, will ask for
a connection of these instances with the weather-cock on the church-steeple. If any one so does, he must be referred to the words of Holwell," for which however all responsibility is emphatically declined. " The ancients kept a cock in their tirit or towers to give notice of the dawn. Hence this bird was sacred to the sun, and named WeKTcop, which seems to be a compound out of the titles of that deity [? !] and of the tower set apart for his service ; for these
towers were temples."] K. O. Miiller pointed out^ that one name for Orion was
WXeKTpoTToSLov, SL gigantic Cock's-foot, the spur of which was the
girdle of Orion. Agenor was the father (by Telephassa) of Europa, Kadmos, Phoinix, and Kilix. Thus the bird-god Phoenix and first-man Cadmus are brothers in this myth. Of course they were both
Phoenician conceptions. The fact that (pctvc^ meant both a phoenix and a palm-tree
deserves, perhaps, more attention from this point of view. But the
word (})olvi^ is considerably mixed ; and the bennu of Egypt ^^
(the very doubtful " origin " of the phoenix) roosted in a tamarisk,
not a palm. The .sacred palm-tree of bronze at Delphi which

Feathers.
STUKELEY (p. 92) laboured to show that the name of the
Egyptian god Kneph (now identified with Khnum) was
equivalent to the Hebrew ganapJi, to fly ; and he, oddly enough for what has herein been said about the cherubim (p. 748), quoted from Psalm xviii, 10, "he rode upon the cherubim and did fly." And he quoted from Eusebius {Pr. Ev. iii, 3) that " the Egyptians painted the god whom they called Kneph like a man in a blue garment [which seems a confusion with Ptah, for Khnum is usually green]
holding a circle and serpent, and on his head feathers or wings." I have here given, from Baedeker's Lozver Egypt (127), the head and head-dress of the ramheaded Khnum, who is " associated with Ptah, and is sometimes represented as moulding the Egg of the Universe on a potter's wheel, out of matter furnished by Ptah." And I think that, if all that has been said in this Inquiry about Kronos and his wings be unbiassedly compared with what is just here advanced, it will be conceded, as extremely probable in every way, that the feathers upon the atef, SJiuti and other crowns of Egyptian deities are not
simply the " ostrich-feathers of truth," but are divine emblems
subordinate to the
wings—feathers, if
you will, of the wings of the winged
sphere ; just as in Sanchoniathop all the other heavenly gods who follow II (Kronos) in his flight (p. 748) arc less gifted than their primate in
the matter of wings. I here add, merely for reference, the somewhat similar head-gear of the crocodile-headed Sebek and of
Osiris. There is also the single feather of Maat, and the " long feather head-dress termed Shuti " of Amen-Ra. (I must also refer here to what is said at p. 739 about the Prince of Wales's plume.) For convenience in study the following list of the featherN2

thy enemies. If a man holds a bone of that strong bird, no one can smite or turn to flight that fortunate man. The feather
of that bird of birds brings him help ; it brings unto him the homage of men, it maintains him in his glory. All tremble before
him who holds the feather ; they tremble therefore before me,
Ahura." In Mexico the mother of Huitzilopochtli, or left-hummingbird,
becomes pregnant of him by a floating feather. In the SJidh Ndniah when Rudabah's side was opened to bring forth Rustem, her wound was healed by rubbing it with a feather of the Saena-bird Simurgh, and Rustem himself, sore-wounded by Isfendy^r, was cured in the same manner. The Saena bird is also of course the Syena or Hawk or Kite to
whom portions of two .Suktas of the Rig Veda (iii, 172) are addressed, and whom the commentators say is to be understood as the supreme spirit, Parabrahma. Wilson thought this was " the notion of a later day," but those who follow my arguments may be
inclined to assign to the identification a very archaic origin indeed. This was the bird whose shape the Gayatri took to carry off the Soma plant from heaven. Indra himself is elsewhere called a
Syena (iii, 156). In the Iliad {y^M, 237), Apollo flies down the slopes of Ida, that is of the heavens-mountain as a hawk. " In the Rig Veda,

The Egg.
'T^HE EGG. As has been said (p. 769) Ptah, the opener, was also the creator and breaker of the egg of the Universe, from which the Sun and Moon came forth ; and there is, strangely enough, an egg-shaped single Object (ichi motsu) in Japanese mythology, according to Hirata, which formed in space, and afterwards developed into the Sun and the Earth. The first words of the ancient Chronicle of Japan called the Nihongi are :
Of old, before heaven and earth separated, and the negative and positive were unparted. Chaos was like a fowl's Q^g ; and subsequently Deity came into existence in the
midst thereof.
I have come across a somewhat irreverent allusion to this in a verse
of poetry contained in a sermon of the Elder Okuda Raijo:
Ame-tsuchi no Hirakenu saki ni Utauran Tamago no naka no Niwatori no koye !
(Is it likely, now, that a cock could have crowed inside a hen-egg before the separation of heaven and earth ?) which leads one to repeat Bayle's remark upon Anaxagoras that the ideas of the Ancients who wrote about Chaos were not less confused than
Chaos itself.
[A lengthy monograph would not be wasted upon the ramifications of the Egg conception. I shall only add the following as more immediately pointing to the heavens and to their central
deity ; for, indeed, the question cannot be left here in its present crude state. The Sidonians according to Eudemos, posited before all things Time, and then Desire and Darkness. From the union of this first pair came another duality, Aer and Aura, or Air and Breath, who in their turn produced the Cosmic Egg, of which
Time is here, as it were, the grand-parent.^ Another genesis, due to Damascius, makes Time engender in

and female principles, and so virtually the multitude of all things.
Yet another genealogy— here are any number of them, each more
or less inconsistent — given by the same Damascius as that of the
Phoenician Mochos, says that there were at first Ether and Air,
corresponding—though not in primitiveness —to Eudemos's Aer and Aura, as above. From these was engendered Tiutc (called 'Ulom). Time then produced first Chousoros, the opener ('Hushor, Ptn/i), the demiurgus who opens the Egg, and then Time produced the Eee itself Damascius looked upon the egg as intended for Chaos, or perhaps for the heavens, seeing that it was said that when it split in two its halves formed heaven and earth. In both these suppositions Damascius is borne out by Sanchoniathon, whose
o-enesis —the last to be given here — makes Rua'h (Breath, the
above-named Aura) become amorous of its own essence ; the union was called Desire (Hipesh), and gave rise to Muth or Mot, in the form of an Egg, which illumined itself ; and so sun, moon, stars,
and planets shone. The Egg here certainly looks like Chaos, in which case the eggshell would answer to the vault or sphere of the
hea\ens.' As to the contents, the meat, in the egg, we further find that Sanchoniathon's egg-shaped Muth consisted frankly of mud, or more academical!},' of a humid and chaotic matter in which the elements of earth and water were still mixed ; or, again, of the
putrefaction of a watery mixture, a slime ; and from this Muth or
Mud issued all the seed of creation, and the generation of all
things.^ The golden Egg, splendorous like the Sun, in which Brahma,
the father of the worlds, took birth b}' his own energ\', floated on
the waters. The god took thought, and split his envelope into two parts ; with these he formed the heavens and the earth, placing between them the subtle ether, the Eight regions of the world and the permanent container of the waters.- In the SatapatJia BraJimana (xi) " a golden Egg came into existence in the Waters. It then became a year [that is one revolution of Nature, the unit of Time]. From it in a }'ear a man came into existence who was Prajapati. He conceived progeny in himself ; with [the word of?]
his mouth he created the gods."

Another Egyptian account is that the Egg was laid by the god Seb. Now Seb sometimes bears a goose on his head, and his
name is written with a goose "^ J Jj , and both the goose and
the Qgg '^ signify son.^ So that it might almost seem as if crediting him with the laying of the Egg was an afterthought, or the theory of a sect who held that the bird came before the Egg. For Seb is the god of the Earth, the consort of the heavens-goddess Nut, and together these are the parents of the gods. I know not whether we are to see an emblem of " hatching " in the vulture which forms with its enclosing wings the head-dress of Maut
(consort of Ammon). One myth makes the dove-goddess Atargatis be born from an t%^' ; and when one comes to reflect upon it the opening of the
Egg ought, if it took place naturally, to produce a bird ; and this may have supplied another sort of support to the heavens-bird
conception. In Korean cosmogony an Egg of extraordinary size, shaped like a gourd, and of pure gold, is found on a mountain, and on being
opened discloses a beautiful rosy baby-boy. He wedded the daughter of a well-dragon. Their daughter, again, married a foreign youth who was also born out of an Egg which had been laid, in point of fact, by a queen, his mother.^ It does not seem that we have as yet got this legend quite accurately. Mr. E. A. Freeman, writing of the Mosque of the Companion
at Khairwan, say-s* : " the ostrich-eggs that hang about his tomb may suggest the roc's eggs of Sindbad and Aladdin. They are said to be merely ornamental, and to have no symbolical meaning." It seems to me that there can be no doubt that these eggs (which also hang in festoons in Armenian churches ; and not, as is amusingly said, to keep the rats from the oil) are symbols of a lost
heavens-bird worship. It is just as well to extract from Galland* the passage about
the roc's agg in the talc of Aladdin : "Jinni," said to him Aladdin, "there is wanting to this dome a roc's ^^\g hung from the centre of the vault ; I demand of thee in the name of the Lamp I hold, that thou doest in such sort that

The Winged Scarab.
THE winged Scarab shown on the summit of Ptah's pillar of
stability (here claimed for the Universe-axis) at p. 66 seems
to partake of the supreme central bird idea. '^ Ateuchus sacer, the celebrated scarabaeus of the ancient Egyptians, was believed to be of the male sex only, and its act of
rolling the clay-balls containing its eggs was supposed to be its
manner of propagating its species (Plutarch, De hide, 1. x, 74). The Egyptians accordingly consecrated the scarabasus to Ptah, the
god of origin and creation, who is often represented on the monu
ments with a scarabsus in place of a human head."^

O.'N.] " which implants in matter the germs of existence and light " [the same confusion, under the influence of the all-sufficiency of sun-worship] " was Khepera or the Scarabseus with the sun's disc, whose emblem was the beetle
{scarabceus sacer)'' [One is the more surprised at the words " sun's
disc " here, as the writer immediately goes on to talk of the " ball,"
which I, greatly daring, call the spho^e^ " As that insect rolls up into a ball the eggs which produce its offspring, and was supposed to have no female, so this deity was believed to have concealed
within the globe of the world " [say rather sphere of the Universe\
" the germs of organic life. Ptah is the greatest of the gods, and is the embodiment of the organising and motive power. It is Ptah who imparts form to the germs sown by Khepera, and under the name of Sekhem Nefer breaks the ball rolled along by the Scarabaeus, or in other words the Egg of the Universe, from which emerge his children, the elements and forms of heaven and earth . . . .

"Ptah was the ancient god of Memphis, who deHvered to Ra the germs of creation, and was assisted in his labours by the seven Khnumu or architects " [whom I identify with the Rishi of Ursa Major]. " As from him were supposed to emanate the laws and
conditions of existence, he is also styled Lord of Truth." [The titles lord of truth and judge of heaven, seem rather to come from his immovable unswerving position as a Polar deity and an all
seeing Eye.] " The ' primaeval Ptah ' is also spoken of as the head of the Solar " [why " solar " alone ?] " gods, and also occasionally as the creator of the Egg from which, according to an older Myth, the sun and moon came forth. Thence too is derived his name
which signifies ' the opener.' "^ The winged-beetle, winged-hawk, and winged-vulture appear on the back of Ptah's Hapi bull as well as the winged-sphere does. This
is not surprising considering the supreme rank of Ptah. What is more unexpected is to see them all also on the back of the ichneumon. This at once demonstrates a supreme significance in the divine ichneumon-emblem. I would suggest that this may have had its origin in the animal's antagonism to the serpent. The name of the beetle, K/icper, the becomer, means also the
roller or evolver, I believe, and if the god Khepera not only produced all things, but also produced himself (Khepera meaning self-begotten), and afterwards gave birth to the other gods, Khepera must simply be an alias of Ptah. I cannot admit that
what the beetle rolls along is " the disc of the sun," nor can I see how that view can be cosmogonically maintained. It is much too local for the archi-supreme central notions with which I would connect Ptah. The beetle must be rolling up or rolling round the sphere of the Universe ; and it is the revolutions of that sphere which cause all becomings in Time ; it is that sphere which we
have already seen (pp. 607, 608) as the Fortune-globe of the events
goddess. The sacred and cosmic significance of the word %eper is
exemplified by the formula " %eper %enti %ep ^et neb em-;i^et %eper-sen : the Becoming which is m the Becoming of the All when it Becomes." Again the term " %epera %eper t'esef: self
existent Being " frequently occurs in Egyptian texts, where %epera
fully means scarab as well as being.

A hymn contains the passage : " Hail Ra, lord of the Law, \ <^ whose shrine is hidden, lord of the gods, %epra in his boat, at whose I command the gods were made."^
Canon Cook- points out the resemblance of Kheper ^
to our chafer, a kind of beetle. De Rouge'' calls it the " mysterious
symbol of divine renaissance " and describes Ramses I as adoring the scarab as the "symbol of the creator."
The god Khepera, Khepra H <z> [1 , the Becoming, had a
scarab for head. The verb kheper " to be, to become, to be trans
formed " was Q <=> \ and ; and ^^ while " to give
existence," s-kheper, was 00^^^ . The mummies of the nth
dynasty almost always wear a scarab on a finger of the left hand. The replacing of the mummy's heart by a large stone scarab at the same time demonstrates the high significance of the scarab and the
great importance of the heart in the Egypcian view of the human organism. The Ptah called embryo is hatted with the scarab, and there was a bull-headed scarab which is very rare. (Pierret : Diet?) The scarab that replaced the mummy's heart had the
30th chapter of the Peremhru inscribed on it. Tahutmes (Thothmes) III " furnishes more scarabs than all the
other monarchs put together. His legend was reproduced on
scarabs down to very recent epochs, either from reverence for the person of this king or because of the mystic sense that it
presented." (De R., Not. Sojil, 76.) This legend is the celebrated " Ra-men-Kheper which must have been adopted for /^"T^ religious reasons by Tahutmes (" born of Thoth ") and for the same reasons continued subsequently. As already
stated it would seem to convey an absorbing worship of Ra © and Kheper the stablishers, which was perhaps the devo- \^_^

Kronos.
§ 37. Kuhn and others make Kronos god of the nocturnal heavens, which is quite in the direction of the present Hne of argument. Menzel said he must be conceived of as enthroned in the North ; and it is necessary to point out that the ancestor of Kronos, the ^^Xtovv of Sanchoniathon in the Philo-Eusebian version which Philo explained as 'TyJriaTo<;, or the Most High, must also be claimed for the position of the Polar deity, to whom
it seems eminently to apply, for his abode is clearly in the highest point, the apex, the pole, of the revolving sphere ; every other point being, by comparison, on a lower level. In Pausanias's
description of Corinth (II, ii ; see also V, xv) he says that in the forum " there are three statues of Zeus in the open air ; one of
these is without a name ; the second they call Terrestrial, and the
third the Most High, 'T-^icno^." This is the Phoenician divinity
whom the late Francois Lenormant identified with the el-'elion of Genesis xiv, 18. Sanchoniathon's Phoenician original of Philo's
Kronos was (Philo's " Ilos," that is) II or El, and both he and



and Plah.'] Kronos. 775
Atlas, whose correct Phoenician name is now lost [the Phcenician word for the apin) might give it ?] were sons of the Heavens and Earth, of Philo's Ouranos and Ge, the Phoenician Shama and Adamath.i Osiris as the Most High, " the lord above all," Neb-er-tcher, must, it would seem, be viewed as a supernal god, that is in his pristine
stage, before he was relegated to the lower hemisphere. Another
of his titles Neb-ua, the Only, would refer to the same period of
his evolution. It is utterly out of the question to ignore the importance of the survival in the Latin Mass of such Hebrew words as Sabaoth, Hosanna, Alleluia and Amen. " Sanctus, sanctus, sanctus, dominus Deus Sabaoth " (thrice holy Lord God Sabaoth) " Hosanna in Excelsis : Hosanna au plus haut des Cieux," that is, to (or in) the
highest spot of the heavens. Such were the words which in Isaiah's vision (vi, 3) he heard the six-winged- Seraphim shouting to each other ; and such are still the exclamations in the Preface
of the chiefest part of the Mass. Before that there is the famous " Gloria in Excelsis Deo : Gloire a Dieu au plus haut des Cieux "
;
and the same adscription of unlimited praise says : " Tu solus
Altissimus—thou alone art the Highest." I have purposely left the rendering in the original French of the Montpellier Instructions
or catechism.'* The Preface of the Mass also makes the Angels praise, the dominations adore, the powers tremble, the Heavens and the Virtues of the Heavens and the blessed Seraphin all exultantly
celebrate together the majesty of the omnipotent P'athcr and eternal
God — Cceli, Coelorumque Virtutes ac beata Seraphim socia exulta
tione concelebrant. These are important words, and my desire
is here to lend them their very fullest weight. The term Ancient of Days seems also to me especially applicable to a deification of the backward abysm of Time, as in Daniel vii, 9, 10: The Ancient of Days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool ; his throne
was like the fiery flame, and his Wheels as burning fire. A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him. This in one respect somewhat resembles the imagery of the Greek poets who

make Kronos an old man with abundant hair and beard ; he is
ev'^airr\<i, \daio<;, evpvjev€io<;. I append an illustration which would seem to be this aged, bearded, hairy (and winged)
Kronos ; but Bellori and Bartoli, in their
Colnmna Aiitonini, call it Jupiter Pluvius, who ^^^C'WMW extends his arms and wings, while tJic rain runs
-'fl'JlKjy^" jj-, floods from his body. It is for me, too, the
same idea that we are so familiar with in French as le Pere Eternel. Belitan meant Bel the Ancient, that is Bel considered as Time. The Ancient or the Old of the Phoenicians had his image as such in the Kaaba of the Arabs, who called him Hobal and Ab- and father of Time. (Movers, p. 263.) In the Zulu myths Unkulunkulu, or Old-Old one, the first man, " came to be " ; the Bushmen have their Ovakuru Meyuru, or " old ones," who control the skies' ; and the creation of the Black-fellows was effected by "the very, very old ones" (Nooralie or Nurrum
bung uttias). Hoary Old Father Christmas, with his tree too, clearly belongs
to this class of conceptions. A very significant invocation of a form of Horus (?) which belongs to the baser epoch, calls him the " Old man who becomes young." Here, for one thing, we have perhaps the original of the Faust legend. It is said to represent " the eternal youth of the divine nature victorious over time and death" (Pierret, Diet. 132) ; but this explanation ignores the old age. The conception is
perhaps rather that of life-in-death, of the renascence of things, of the continuance of the species but disappearance of the used-up
individual. It seems to me more than probable, too, that this " Old man who becomes young " is properly not Horus but the embryonic
Ptah. If this could be ascertained, it would be satisfactory in many ways.
The " disappearance of the used-up individual " of course infers the uprise of a new generation, which is, however, in this case of Ptah (or Horus) accomplished by a magic or, as I expound it, a natural-magic change, and is not a transmission by generation. But the changes were rung upon this idea in Egypt in many different ways, so that the succession of human generations was completely

set at naught in the conceptions of the supreme divine power and
methods of self-continuance. Thus a god Hke the infant Amen (or Hor-Amen) could engender himself and become his own child, which is merely a restating of the case of the ancient cosmogonies at their start (p. 20). Or the god was " the fecundator, the bull, of his mother "
5^ ""^^-^ \^\ ^^^=— • Thus the ithyphallic god Khem or Amsu
the generator is his own father and his own son and the husband of his mother. Another strange way of stating this idea of the blotting-out of generations in the eternal existence of the gods was to make a deity (as Hor-Amen is by " another account ") the generator of his own mother.
Under these circumstances a genealogical tree is a diiTficulty in Egypt, and these considerations serve to explain why in the
Chaldean and Assyrian similar " trees " we find the same, or nominally almost identical, gods appearing in more than one generation ; and even quite independent " trees," purporting to be authentic, which only occasionally coincide or confirm each other. This is important to bear in mind whenever we find a son-god usurping the worship of the father, or the new generation, son or
daughter, taking the place of the old, in the case of fallen or falling gods.
Freret had ascertained in the last century^ that the worship of
Kronos represents the most ancient form of the religions of Greek
countries ; a form so very archaic that there scarce remained here
and there a vestige of it in what we are wont to call Hellenic times. The name Dea applied to Rhea the consort of Kronos made her as it were tJie goddess par excellence^ and was said by Hesychius to have been Tyrrhenian.^ [In the Phoenician mythology of Mochos, Ulom, Time answers to the Kronos of Eudemos. Hieronymus and Hellanicos call him
Kronos ay/]paTo<; imaging Time—which it has been conjectured should be unbounded, air^qpavro'^. He was so far back as to be father to the male and female duality Ether and Chaos.^ Pherecydes made Zes, who lives eternally, Kronos, and Chthonia, the three first cosmic principles ; the first of the three preceding the

other two. Zes is equivalent to Zeus, and Chthonia of course to Ge, the Earth. Zes is also called Ether, the active, and Chthonia,
Earth, the passive principle ; or Zes is Fire ; or Zes is the breath, Ruah of Sanchoniathon. But then Kronos, according to Phere
cydes, produced by his generation, fire, breath, and water.^ In any and all cases the remotely primaeval place of Kronos is clear.
It is scarce necessary to remind the reader that in Homer Zeus is earlier than Kronos, while in Hesiod he is later, Kronos being
son of Ouranos. Proclus- in his Scholia on Plato's Cratylus said that " Kronos had been considered by some as the same with the one Cause of all things. He was however," said Proclus, [not this Cause but]
"analogous to this Cause; just as Orpheus calls the first cause Xp6vo<; (Time) nearly homonymously with Kp6vo<; (Saturn). But the Oracles of the Gods " (that is, expounded Taylor, the Chaldean
oracles) " characterise this deity by the epithet of The O/wc, tm
aira^, calling him Once beyond, arra^ iirUeiva. For the Once is
allied to the One." But all this refining is mere spinning of Pla
tonian cobwebs round the one initial quibble of maintaining that
K/30V09 and Xpovo'i are not, to all intents and purposes, one and
the same. Eusebius, in his book called, by a foregone conclusion, the
Pr(Eparatio Evangelica (iv, T/), gave human sacrifices to Kronos, Zeus, Ares, Apollo, Dionysos, Hera, and Athene. These then, by
this test of highest sacrifice, ought to have been the chiefest Grecian gods. Clement of Alexandria adds Artemis, Peleus and Chiron. The last was a son of Kronos, and clearly a primeval astrological heavens-beast, and Peleus was by one account his grandson. The
human sacrifices therefore ran in the family, in this first and best
of families. It was Ptah's eldest son Imhotep, who was worshipped with him at Memphis, that seems to have been really taken for Ask
Icpios by the Greeks. They also called him 'lfxov6'>j<; (p. 275).
Guigniaut paralleled the Phoenician Time (11) not alone with the Time (Zervan Akarane) of the Avesta, but also with the Time of the Orphic verses.'' I have elsewhere connected Kronos with the Zoroastrian Zervan Akarana ; and Guigniaut also per

ceived the identity of Kronos (or Saturn) to whom numbers of ancient peoples immolated human victims, with the Belus or Baal adored on mountains, and also with the Indian Siva- Rudra, one of whose epithets is Maha Kala, mighty Time, and who had such names or (Vaishnaic?) incarnations as Bali or Maha-Bali.^ Vishnu is considered as Time in the Rig Veda? Siva, as Kala,
Time, is the father and dissolver of all things, while his daughter (who is also his consort) Kali, is Death and the mother of tears' and in fact it might be said broadly that deeply rooted in Saivism
is the contemplation and personification of the forces of nature,
that is the powers of the supreme deity, now as generative and
productive, again as destructive, and then again as regenerative,
and so on in an infinite circle.
Siva, Time, is often represented with his son and counsellor
Ganesa, the god of intelligence, invention, numbers and much more'' ; which affords a parallel to Sanchoniathon's Kronos and Thoth or rather Ilos and Taautos.

780 The Night of the Gods. \^Kronos
The Symbols o and Q and CIDI
THE circular re-entrant idea of Time is also, of course, to be
detected in such words as cycle (= /cu/cXo?, circle = kakra, wheel) ; period {irep'i + oho's, a way) ; annual (annus, year; annulus
ring, i.e., little annus, which is thus a big ring) ; the revolution,
the rotation {i.e., wheeling, rota = wheel), and even the whirligig,
of time. In the celebrated Babylonian tablet of 900 B.C. in the British Museum, given by Dr. Wallis Budge's kindness on p. 602, the Supreme heavens-god Samas holds in his extended right hand (fS^ what I conceive to be perhaps the earliest form of >^^ the Egyptian arcana-symbol Q. In the hand of this
Babylonian god there appear to be two objects, a ring and a rod
each separate. If this be so, I would theorise that the rod is the
Universe-axis and the ring the revolving Universe. The combination would then be a Universe symbol, and, as Q in Egypt meant 10,000,000, would be comparable to the Japanese Manji (see p. 656) which means io,ooo, and would therefore be the All. The idea of
revolution will then too fit-in to the general interpretation of the
sign Q as " reproduction, renewal, eternity," "the infinite renewal
of years," or of revolutions, that is of the natural unit of time.
If Q thus means Eternity, it would also, of course, imply
Immortality ; and this may explain its stretching into the r'an
(—;^ in which royal names are inscribed. They thus "entered
into Immortality." This would explain, too, the sarcophagi which
are hewn in the form of a ran c— . such as that of Ramses III
(Louvre ; lid at Cambridge). It will assist us, perhaps, to take a list of some words in which
Q occurs :
Q Shen — 10,000,000; infinity.
,^r Shen—the Nile at the period of inundation (Brugsch).
This may be fancied to have been originally the heavensriver or the subterranean river which furnished the unknown "source of the Nile."

Q© and ^ O^^ Shen, Shennu, a place in the first
nome of North Egypt (Brugsch, Geog., i, 242).

these two symbols (see what is said of Mat— (Index)

the Universe.
Q

or fortification (E. de Rouge).
Q" T/p. Shna, sacred serpent (Brugsch).
Q ^^_^ T=T Shenur, the great circle of water designation of
the sea (Brugsch). This is the Cosmic Ocean.
There is another way of considering this symbol. Eternity has
been and can be viewed abstractedly (the only way of thinking it) as two or as one. "Each moment is the conflux of two Eternities," a sounding but barren phrase which so enchained the mystic side of Carlyle's brain, might be represented by a straight line starting
each way to an infinite distance from the moment in, thus :
m
-^— Eternity (past) 1^ (future) Eternity
Or, again. Eternity may be conceived (but not comprehended) as re-entrant, that is as return
ing into itself; when a circle would represent it,
and come into play thus : The circle-symbol would have been helped into use, too, by the various cycles which re
constitute certain celestial positions, and which
of course led to the ancient belief that terrestrial events also re-happened at cyclic intervals. Of course the original suggestion of the circle-symbol would have come from the Universe



782 The NigJit of the Gods. \Kronos
revolution, the unit of time, that which was in fact conceived as being one with time, as explaining why all things take place in
time, and as thus fitting the circle as a representation of time and
its events, that is of the All. The sign Q may combine all these ideas (of line and circle),
and the point where the circle reposes on the line may be the
Present. Rut " 'twere to consider too curiously, to consider so."
It must not be forgotten either, that in the Egyptian symbol the
line and circle (if such they be) are often bound together and become a bar and a ring joined by a clamp, as it were, and particoloured so as to convey, apparently, a complex set of ideas now
perhaps for ever lost to us. Guigniaut thought that boundless Time was represented by the
ring or the circle^ ; but it would seem that the definite, simplex, signification is the unit of time which one revolution of the heavens affords. Thence of course the meaning of continuous revolution
beginningless and endless—of Eternity.
^
I know not whether it is permissible to theorise that
the sign of "eternal life," as it is now generally interpreted,
the ankh -r , is compounded of Q and | the latter being
meant for stability. I believe Ptah is the only god
that combines the aiikli, the tat u and the divine ivas
sceptre 1 , all which he holds thus in his hands. The
arikh was made into neck-chains and (with the was) is
poured-out in a thread of the water of eternal life (?)
from vases.
The Rig Veda says that " Vishnu causes 94 periodical revo
lutions- by his gyrations, like a circular wheel vast of body." Again, " the twelve-spoked wheel of the True revolves round the heavens and never decays ; 720 children, in pairs, abide in it," (p. 1 30) ; " all beings abide in this five-spoked revolving wheel ; the heavily loaded Axle is never heated ; its eternal compact

The commentators make up the 94 with the 8 watches, the 30 days of the month, the 24 half-months, the 12 months, the 12 zodiacal signs, the 5 seasons, the two solstices, and the i year. It will be observed that the day itself per se, the prime heavenly (apparent) revolution is here omitted ; and that many of the others are mere reduplications ; so that this gloss must be received with caution.

Tzvelve and five are here expounded to be the months and the seasons ; the 360 are the days (day + night) in the vague year of 12 times 30, and the " 720 in pairs " are the same, reckoning day and night separately. As to the three axles and the gibe " but who knows it ? " I have little doubt they refer darkly to the threefold divine nature of the central Power ; to conjecture, with the commentators, that they are "the three double seasons, or hot, wet, and cold " would be puerile. Thus we see that Vishnu was, as Wilson pointed out,^ " identical with Time," or rather with the supreme central Power who by turning the Heavens produced the grand total of successive motions which measure Time ; and thus does the Rii^ Veda bring us aeain to the Wheel and to Kronos.

1AM not oblivious of the fall of Kronos, and his subsequent
phases as the reverse of a supernal deity ; which perhaps are
not unconnected with his relegation to the nocturnal heavens merely. The fact that Kronos was a hidden, a dark, a veiled god may refer to his relegation to the under, the hidden world or
hemisphere. Plouton is said in the commentary of Olympiodorus on the Gorgias to wear a helmet that covers the face (the AtSo9 Kvvet] (?) of the Iliad, v. 845) on account of the dark invisible kingdom over which he presides. The Japanese too have their gods of the Unseen ; and the conception is also Chinese. But the myths of

Egyptian ideas about the West—m.ust be kept apart, and not all ancient or modern mythologists have succeeded in so doing. Cast down he was, no doubt, but the gods die hard, and his primeval
phase may live for ever— may endure in omne volubilis aevum. The Roman hill of the Capitol was at first the Mount of Saturn,
where the Capitolium was, in its most restricted sense, the temple of Jupiter ; and there v/as, according to Dionysius of Halicarnassus, a complete assimilation between the Capitol and Mount Kronios, at the foot of which were celebrated the Olympian games ; and Mount Kronios, the omphalos of the holy Elidian city, was the primary focus of the Capitolian form of worship.^ Other points of no mean import are that the Chaldeans considered
Saturn the most significant of the planets, and drew from it the greater number of important auguries. The Greeks called it both
Kronos and Helios, which last is as certain as it is strange,^ for in a resume of the astronomy of Eudoxus in a papyrus at the Louvre
Saturn clearly is called 6 tov r^Xlov acrrrip. Here Helios cannot

tion, of the terminology of a more ancient worship on the newer
one of " the planets." The rise of one god often seems as puzzling as the decline and fall off of another ; and it is frequently a mere matter of chance. The case of the Assyrian Asshur is a good one to show what luck does for a god. He, with his dual feminine Sheruya, formed one of the numerous pairs of deities into which the Babylonian and
Assyrian primordial entity divided. He was at first merely the local god of the town of Aushar or Asshur (now Kalah-sherkkat) which becoming the first focus of national Assyrian life, Asshur
succeeded to the position of the great god of the Assyrian nation.
Every local or village-god of the same standing all over the East had just as good a start as Asshur. His supremacy grew so manifest that it almost approached a monotheism, and he was thus naturally made the father of all gods, and succeeded without
question or thought of question, to all the pride and privilege of the Supreme Spirit first evolved from Chaos, to whom he put an end, or rather whose entity he carried on under another name. In the same way Tyr was cast into the cold shade by the glories of Woden.
This is the Doom of the Gods. The ancient god of Fire of the Accads also lost his importance, and at length quite vanished, being swallowed up in Rammanu, a god one or two generations younger than Asshur, according to what
genealogical tree we accept. Ishtar, too, the famous Ishtar, who was of the immediate family of the elder Rammanu, became in many sanctuaries of Babylon and Chaldea a goddess two generations younger than herself, as the daughter of Sin and not of the
earlier Anu.^ It will thus be seen, too, that the tendency ever is to be off with the old god and on with the new, to take up with the new generation : a radical and a therefore ineradicable bent not
alone of mankind, but of all Nature. According to Martialis Capella (ii, 40) the Sabine god Summanus was supposed to be the same divinity as Pluto (see p. 489) If there be accuracy in this, it must be recorded as another instance of a fallen deity. Yet another instance of a god who has failed in or retired from his supernal business, or at all
events of an infernal counterpart, is the Vediovis, or Vedius, or
Vejovis, or pleonastic Vedijovis of the Etruscans. O. Muller^ makes

these names a compound with the bad negative prefix Ve-, and the divinity was a dreaded, an evil, a subterranean one. Another
fallen god —their name is Legion ! — is Old Ophion the serpentgod, the first master of the heavens, cast with his companions into Tartaros by Kronos himself The defeat of the " Old Serpent who is the Calumniator and Satan," who is cast down and shut up in the abyss, does not appear in the Old Testament, but in the
traditions of the Hebrews ; and it is to be found also in chapters xii and xx of Revelations. The term Asura is applied in the Rig Veda 26 times to Indra, Agni and other divinities in the sense of " mighty one," although Deva is generally the word for a god. But in the Brahmanas it has become the name of the demons with whom the Devas are at war. The Avestan form of Asura is Ahura, and that, of course, is the name of the most high god, while the Deos (Avestan form of Devas) are the black demons. One of the endless illustrations of that axiom of comparative religious science : One man's god is another man's devil, all the world over. The tossing of Hephaistos out of heaven by Zeus, and the hanging of Hera herself in chains out of heaven^ are clearly incidents of the " war in heaven " ; and of the falling of gods ; of
their facile descent to Avernus. And it is merely a hollow old superstition of the poets that the gods know all, yet have suffered nothing. One of the most famous and mysterious of the fallen gods is the Egyptian Set. Set was the elder brother and slayer of Osiris (a Cain and Abel
incident). His worship had a great vogue as one of the great gods of Abydos under several sovereigns of the i8th and 19th dynasties ;
but a violent reaction took effect later [this is vague], for the
figures of Set were destroyed or mutilated with a care zvluch makes them extremely rare in our miisemns. The symbolical animal of Set is a carnivorous quadruped with a long and slightly bulging snout, and straight, long, erect, blunt-topped ears. These marks
are often exaggerated [as ifj to distinguish it from the finenosed jackal with pointed ears.^ Set was brother and consort of Nephthys. When Horus vanquished Set he did not kill,

but only emasculated him.^ The giant serpent Apophis was a symbol of (fallen ?) Set, but another legend made Set the first victor over the serpent, another link with the Hebrew Genesis, and a stela in the Leyden museum shows him piercing it with a dart. " It was not till the decline of the Empire," says M. Renouf,- " that this deity came to be regarded as an evil demon, that his name was effaced from the monuments, and other names substituted for his
in the ritual." Brugsch" seems to say that Egyptian astronomical texts associate Set (as Plutarch did) with the Great Bear. This would give the
unfallen Set a high Northern origin. He is found engraved on the belly of a scarab wearing the
sekhet V/ or hat of the N. and S. ; written near is Nubti, " lord of
the S." a Nubian name of Set (p. 462). He is also seen on the base of an enamelled hedgehog, again with the sekhet, and standing
on a serpent which he is strangling with the right hand, while in the
left he holds a hatchet.^ He is paralleled with the Theban Mentu.
The PereuiJiru identified Set with Bes, and Bes is a good god. In the white-ink (i8th dynasty?) Tenena papyrus in the Louvre (3074) Deveria said^ that Set takes_thej)lacejif Thotlvand is caJled Setes. The third of the five complementary annual days was the birthday of Set. The five were consecrated to Osiris, Aroeris, Set, Isis and
Nephthys ; so Set is here clearly unfallen. Set was son of Nut the heavens-goddess. Before the downfall of Set " he was the warriorgod par excellence and the mythic animal which represents him
here ^vl was from a very ancient epoch the symbol of valour.
Later it was execrated as the symbol of evil."" This fall of Set if
duly studied would I feel certain afford a valuable historic clue to
the changes in the mythology of Egypt. He had many different
names : Sutekh for one (?) 1 g^ • -"^"^ Set is written

It is clear from all this that there are three leading facts here. I. Set was a god of Abdu (Abydos) and Nubia, and not of Thebes or Memphis; 2. He had two if not three phases; as a good god, as
the fighter with Osiris and Horus, and as a fallen evil god ; 3. It has been customary to mix up all these matters so that confusion
alone has been the resultIn some exorcising texts (Louvre 3235, 3237, 3239) "Set of the plagues " is vituperated as the asp, the evildoing snake, in whose mouth is burning venom, whose visage is affrighting—(Set) the
assassin of his brother (Osiris).^ Brugsch considered that Set's Greek name o( .Tv(f)Q)v came from
Tebha A f~[] *K\ '^xl a name ('or title ?) given to Set by inscrip
tions in the Edfu temple. The head of Set is always that " of a nondescript animal, somewhat resembling an ass."Set's animal is seen in the ran of the Hyksos monarch Salatis
(Set Shalati HI and also in a title of the Kinsf of
Upper Egypt Rasquenen, who was a contemporary of the Hyksos.
This title means " life-dispensing favourite of Set." A 0. Z' ^
Apap Apapi or Apepa (Aphophis) a Hyksos monarch '^ ' '^ of the 17th dynasty, demanded the cession of a well from Rasquenen which led to the eighty years' war of independence which ended in the downfall of the Hyksos. Could this expulsion or extinction of the Hyksos have also been the downfall of the Set whom they adopted ? (But the
syllable Set, with the figure of the god %|| , occurs of course in the
ranu of subsequent monarchs, notably Seti I, " favourite of Ptah," and Meneptah (Seti II) of the i8th dynasty which succeeded the
Hyksos.) I know not whether the rod user | which appears in
the names of monarchs, is to be connected at all with Set. It is well worthy of notice that both these Setis are connected by their other names with Ptah. M. Pierrot says^ that " The Cartouche of King Seti was defaced because the name of the god Set, which

and his images destroyed." The Phoenician god Baal took rank among the Egyptian gods

83.) This seems an assimilation or a parallel to Set, if not another instance of the worldwide truth that one man's god is another
man's devil.

Polar versus Solar Worship.
[In one or two of the sections, especially that on Polar I'ersus Solar Worship, the paragraphs are in places almost entirely disconnected or only connected remotely. They are in fact notes which would have been pieced together in a continuous argument if Mr. O'Neill had lived to complete his final revision of the work. I have pinned all these together and placed them consecutively in the order indicated in his numbers. Though the sense has not been made so clear as it would have been if connecting links had been added, they ought still to be printed, as in most cases they are of themselves valuable. —J. F. Hewitt, 25 Scpfeviber, 1895.]
1MAY be expected to find space for a brief mention of the counter-claims of Polar and of Solar worship as regards
Ptah. It is well known that the priests of Thebes put the reign of Ra (who may perhaps be taken to have by then become a sungod) before that of Ptah, while the priests of Memphis, who were
followed by Manetho, put Ptah first, at the origin of things.^
That he was " at the origin of things " is considerably proved by his name Ptah, which, whether in Egyptian or in Hebrew means " to open," and his connection with the Universe-Egg and its
opening is fully dealt with at pp. 761, 769. The " White Wall " of Memphis is familiar to us all. M. de Rouge mentions " Heri, son of Kaankh, priest of Ptah and of all the gods of the White Wall at Memphis.''- The Ethiopian Piankhi who captured Memphis, " the
city of the White Wall," there offered great sacrifices to Ptah. It was the ancient capital of the Pharaohs, the city of Ptah and his bull Apis (Hapi). There can be no doubt that Ptah was the supreme god at Memphis, and my suggestion would be that there,
wittingly or not, esoterically or not, a Heavens-worship antagonistic to that of Thebes survived, " Ptah, the supreme god of Memphis," says M. de Rouge,^ " perhaps long maintained himself in a higher sphere (dans une sphere plus elevee) " than the Sun-god " for he is
not found identified with the sun (except in the type of the
infernal divinity, Ptah-Sekar-Osiris'') whilst elsewhere he seems to

be even indicated as the father of the Sun." Some of his titles were " Lord of Justice " (which agrees with what has in this Treatise been said about the polar judge) and "king of the worlds."
The white triangle on the forehead of Ptah's incarnation, the Apis
bull, seems to refer to the primeval triad so often met with in these pages. Hapi was "the second life of Ptah " and sometimes " the son of Ptah." Some of the sacred marks can be made out on a Hapi-bull in the Louvre.^ It was spotted, with black head, and a triangular white " blaze " on the forehead, and at times a white crescent on the
chest. On a stela (Louvre S. 1907) King Pimai, 22nd dynasty, adores a human Hapi with a bull's head. After death Hapi (like every human Egyptian) became an Osiris (Osar-hapi, Serapis) ; but the bull is also seen on monuments bearing the mummy of Osiris and galloping towards the mountain of the dead. Ptah's " habitual form is that of a man with shaven head " [which
gives an enormous antiquity and significance to the religious
tonsure ; and Ptah's son, the Memphian Imhotep—a parallel to the
Theban Khons and the Greek Asklepios —was also shaven^] " wrapped up as a mummy. The features are usually very fine, for Ptah was surnamed ' the handsome-faced god.'
A liturgical papyrus text (Louvre 3176 S.) contains a " sort of
litany of Ptah-Socaris " recited by the superior officiant. It
contains 17 invocations to Ptah and 18 to Socaris.'' The following
notes and comments on the " Ptah-Sekar-Osiris " theories seem to me to prove that there is no firm basis for the theory.
" The third character of Ptah, the infernal character, in which
he " [why Jie alone, when all three arc named ?] " bears the names of Ptah-Sekar-Osiris. In this type, which appears on some stela?, and more habitually in the funereal rituals, he has an adult body swathed like a mummy, with a hawk's-head bearing the solar disk."
[It would seem that it is not solar, that it is not a disk, and that the
hawk's head is not Ptah's.] " It appears to identify Ptah in the hells " [where he is not] " with the sun " [which may be safely denied] "and with Osiris." (De Rouge: Not. Sovi., 126.) " A 3rd form of Osiris identifies him with Ptah under the name of Ptah-Sekar-Osiris. Osiris here takes a hawk's head wearing the solar

disk, and seems identified with the infernal Sun " [De Rouge ahvays
had the Sun in his eyes] (p. 137). " Ptah is a mummy, because as Ptah-Sekar-Osiris he symboHses the inert form of Osiris, who is about to transform himself into the
rising Sun." (Pierret, Diet. 459.) " Sekar, Sekar-Osiris, PtahSekar-Osiris, and even Ptah-Sekar-Osiris-Tanen, is a sort of deifica
tion of the mortal coil (depouille)." [This seems difficult or incon
sistent.] " It is the name of Osiris laid in his coffin. ' His soul
rests in the repose of Sekar.' P.-S.-O. symbolises at the same time
a transitory state, near to resurrection, since he is sometimes a
hawk,"&c. (P. P. 517.) The fact is no one has come to any clear conclusion whatever
about the matter. Sanskrit not only calls the Sun Siiryaand Siirya (masculine and feminine) but also Svar, which is neuter ; that is, supposing the sun to be meant ; but it may turn out that originally Surya and Surya
were a dual pair of central deities. Pushan loves his sister Surya. It is thus suggested that the predominance of Sun-worship was due to a later evolution, and that a considerable proportion of mythical facts, now uninterpreted, or referred somewhat unsatis factorily to the Sun, can be more simply deduced from the adoration of the Polar and other stars.
The likeness of the O to the Greek % that is the initial of all
these supreme names of heavens-deities must not escape us.

Is it to carry out a preconceived theory which neither the Egyptian sounds nor glyphs convey ? How is it shown that the word or idea of "disk " was in the Egyptian mind ; and, if unshowablc, why is it forced into the Engh'sh ? What is intended by perpetually thrust
ing the (superfluous) word "disk" upon us? Who began it, and why ?
But the root-origin of "orientation" may be rigidly stated as follows :
Let us first start from the initial fundamental fact that the Gods, the 6eot, are the whole host of heaven : stars, planets, moon and sun.
We have next the leading and ever-abiding fact that each one of these gods appears, offers itself, to our worshipping gaze on the
Eastern side of the world. (Of course we speak as dwellers on the Northern hemisphere of this Earth.)
But as to this last point of rising, we must narrow the field by
another most pregnant religious fact, which is that the most
Northern stars never disappear in the West, never set ; and there
fore never rise in the East. The limit of these is fixed by the latitude of the place of observation, that is the temple ; and the
latitude is, otherwise stated, the height of the polestar above the horizon.
This last portion of the heavens is the Northern land of the greater and greatest gods, of the One who sways and of his governors.
As to the Easterly places of rising of the rest of the stars, and
the times of their rising, it is obvious that, so far as worshippers were concerned, these times must have been confined to the nighttime when alone they are visible to the mass of naked human eyes. On
to this we must add the obvious fact that the devotees would look
for the rising of their Star at the earliest possible moment at which
it was visible. We have next the ruling phenomenon that, as the Earth's turning is a Sun-motion, not a heavens-motion, any
particular star (that rises) appears later every day than it did the
day before. Combining this fact with the variating duration of
star- quenching sun or day-light (there is no real night with us at
midsummer) it will be seen that the periods of visible rising and visibility among the hosts of heaven of any particular star are much circumscribed in the annual round, and that it disappeared altogether from its worshippers for a longer or shorter number
P2



794 The Night of the Gods. \Kronos
of nights, according as its place is more or less southerly in the
heavens. We can then imagine the watchful priests of the ardent worshippers eagerly and with awe looking forward to the actual moment of its first visible appearance, on the first annual occasion
when it showed itself to its adorers. Now this shining moment must always be when the sun has
set on the opposite horizon. Amen (Ammon) in Egyptian is said to mean hidden, mysterious. (Obiter: It is impossible to conceive such a term as
originally applied to the Sun.) De Rouge said the Egyptian name of the god appears to have been pronounced Amun, and signified mystery and adoration.^ Movers made Mithra an Assyrian god, discerning in him a form of Belus analogous to Hercules ; and he derived from Babylon rather than from Persia the worship and mysteries of Mithra, such as they were spread over the west after passing through Asia Minor.The name of the god Ra is said to mean "maker," " disposer" ; that is that he disposed or organised the world of which the
matter was given him by Ptah i^PcreinJin), ch. xvii). If this be so,
he was clearly not a solar god by origin. Khnum was also a workman or foreman of Ptah's, as is seen from his forming the Egg on the potter's wheel from stuff furnished by Ptah. But Khnum's task would thus seem to have been cosmically anterior to Ra's.
The periods of Ra, especially his pre-Solar stage, are not distinguished in any of the explanations of Egyptologists ; and it would thus appear that a good deal that belongs to the Cosmic creation-god is given indiscriminately to the Sun. For example
the reading of ( O ^-^ 1^^ Ra-men-Kheper " the Sun
establishing form " is clearly a confusion of this kind. This, which is found on a vast number of scarabs belonging to divers epochs,
may (if O here be the Sun) mean rather " Kheper the stablisher of
the Sun " ; and if—which seems greatly more probable — Ra be not the Sun but the Cosmic former, it may mean " Ra and Kheper the
stablishers." In fact the god Khepera O <::r> (I the Becomer, may
here be meant. Again, in the text of the PcmnJin), ch. xvii, " I am Ra, who appeared at the beginning, and who governs what he

and Pia/i.~\ Polar 7)ersus Solar IVorship. 795
has made," it is only by violence that Ra can be made the Sun.
This Sun-idolatry is carried so far by some interpreters that
M. Grebaut says^ : " the solar light was the body, the sensible manifestation of the divinity." "Ra,"says Prof Ebers, ably condensing the theories, "a deity who bears 75 different forms, at first appears in the Nu (moisture

the primary source of all things) under the name of Turn, or the
evening Sun." This, of course, is represented as the exoteric view ;
but even so, it is strange how the cultivated intellect brings itself to making the declining sun an emblem of initiality, of beginning. Night may precede Day, but how can Evening do so?
It is flat contradiction. At all events, even " the poor Indian," now worked so hard, would surely have taken the morning sun for more of a commencer ; as Hamlet puts it, they are " too much i' the Sun." But this lending of a glaringly incongruous character to the Sun of evening affords a handy type of the natural outcome of the artificial forcing applied by the Sun-worshippers to the whole of human myth : which for them is always on the sunny side of possible and impossible interpretation. They are ever and always getting them " outof heaven's benediction unto the warm sun." And the putting of the " 75 different forms " all upon one god is the
result of ignoring or confounding the several phases of his evolution.
For example, the prima-^val Tum, who is said to be Ra, cannot be
the Ra who is the sun in later over- myth and sun-worship. Here the question must be faced boldly, and it must be said simply
that Ra is not Ra ; or, to put it more scientifically, that Ra^ Raa
. . . are not . . . Ra.^ ^a... It is much nearer the truth
to take the Ra of origin as the All, to Ilav (not that this is pure
accuracy, either) and to look upon the so-called esoteric and exoteric practices of Egyptian theology and worship as not
manufactured ad hoc (except by myth explainers) —such things are not made but grow ; as not contemporaneous or collocal in their production, but as totally separate in time, and place ; and
as wholly antagonistic as their facts tell our common sense that they are. They are simply independent religions which fight and wrestle for the upper hand and grow while they contest, and in their struggles throughout the ages get very much entangled, enveloped, developed, maimed, and even lopped ; as the sur\-iving
remains show- us : and that not alone in the Egyptian faiths, but

796 The Night of the Gods. {!<',rouos
in every other human religion that has ever pushed forth on this earth under the heavens of its gods. And the one leading idea, the one dominant note, for interpretations of Egyptian mythology is the almost patent fact of the rise of Sun-worship upon the ruins of another religion, another more vast heavens-religion, all the mysteries and facts of which Sun-worship drew into itself; and then mangled, distorted,
devoured and assimilated them, tant bien que mal ; for it is clearly
possible in a great many leading cases to point out the true,
straight signification in the Universe of the plain natural fact
which, when warped into a solar significance, became a puzzle and
a non-sense— a mystery of religion in point of fact. Not but Sunworship has its own patent, genuine facts too, and plenty of them,
of a first-rate importance and truthfulness to universal nature ; but
that it has —as any religion that becomes dominant must by the
nature of the case do— attracted to itself and absorbed the sur
viving essentials of what went before.
The astounding length to which Sun-interpretations are carried in Egypt may be judged from De Rouge's vast assertion that " the Sun is the most ancient object of Egyptian worship which we find on the monuments,"' and he says the heavens ("celestial space") are called the divine mother because the bosom of the nocturnal heavens every day brings forth the Sun. To be sure, on the same page he recorded that "Ammon became Ammon-Ra (AmmonSun) " and adds that Ptah "perhaps long maintained himself in a more elevated sphere." And surely mid-summer madness can no farther go than in making the lion-headed goddess Sekhet (who was at first the great paramour of Ptah, and afterwards the avenging tormentor of the damned in hell-flames) into " solar
radiation, in its double action: vivifying and destructive" {ibid., p.
131 ; Pierret, i?zV/., 503). It is equally surprising to be told that
Khnum, the architect who helped Ptah at the origin of things, and
who " is the humid principle, is also identified with the Sun " (De
R., p. 123). This is simply looking us straight in the face and
saying black is white. M. Pierret goes one better and says that "as a symbol of ardour applying itself to his solar role, Khnum is represented with a ram's head " {Diet., 374). I have tabulated a icw of the Egyptian gods who are averred to be the Sun :

According to Brugsch^ the ritual of the Hapi bull had become
official under the fourth king of the first and the first king of the second dynasties. This is admitted by Mr. Le Page Renouf," but he thinks the great development of this bull-worship was later. The name Ra begins to be added to the royal names of kings
(Nebka-ra, Noferka-ra) in the third dynasty. [Prof. A. C. Haddon stated at the Folklore Society on 17th December, 1889, that there is no Sun-worship in the Torres Straits islands. The Sun, if anything, is rather evil than good ; while rain
and the winds which bring rain are their best natural friends. The
constellations are important as their times of rising give them the
proper dates for sowings and plantings. Their " spirits " seem to go to the West, and in one legend some dead men who change
into fruit-bats or flying foxes, go Northwards.] There is one portion of the assumed Sun-symbolism in Egypt which seems very difficult of acceptation. The serpent Apep (?)
or Mehen ^ U, which belongs to the lower hemisphere is said
to " symbolise the sinuosities of the course of the nocturnal sun." " Nocturnal sun " is in itself an absurdity even if it means the moon ; and the course of the sun, day or night, is not a sinuosity
in any sense. Osiris is said to represent the " nocturnal sun." The

and Ptah.\ Polar versus Solar Worship. 799
sun in the lower hemisphere, that is when concealed by the earth, is no doubt meant ; but what a loose method of thought was the cause or the result of foisting everything in mythology on the Sun.
Funereal scenes on the monuments are said, again, to " refer to the nocturnal course of the sun in the subterranean regions." Where the sun is there cannot be night, and the idea of the underworld is darkness ; so that these two ideas seem to me to be diametrically opposed. I cannot realise the conception of the staters of this theory. Do they, perhaps, mean a dark sun, a sun that becomes
dark on going under? (Pierret : Diet., 331, 395, 492.)
De Rouge says^ that Hathor as Nub in the form of a spotted cow [the Hapi bull was spotted] received the dead in the West,
that is to say at the tomb [or rather at the entrance of the lower
hemisphere]. " She then seems to identify herself with the nocturnal heavens." " The nocturnal heavens were considered to be
the abode of souls." It is not easy to define precisely what De Rouge intended here by the phrase " le ciel nocturne." There is one very striking piece of Egyptian symbolism regarding which (though it is not my present business here)
I should like to record a suggestion. The Greeks, seeing Har
pa-khrat, "which means Horus the infant, carrying his finger to his mouth, as little babies do, mistook the meaning of the gesture,"and made of Har-pa-khrat Harpocrates the god of silence. If the contemporary Greeks were all abroad, we may be also somewhat out in our reckoning in saying that pointing the finger to the
mouth is here a sign of infancy. What a baby does is not to point its finger to its mouth, but to plunge it into it, for purposes
of suction. Does "the infant Horus" do this? The determinative
of words relating to speech is a figure pointing the hand to the
mouth S(\ . It is also said to determine names of foods, and
words relating to tasting and feeling. In the case of Horus the
gesture may perhaps refer to the birth of The Word, the X0709, the
word of truth, the ma khcru ^ \
The importance of the Word was great in Egypt. The soul gained its victories in the underworld with the help of holy words taught it by the Rituals. I sis and Nephthys spoke sacred words which restored the soul to life. Thoth was " lord of the divine Word."

Qui discum audire quam philosophum malunt—who like better
listening to the quoits than the philosopher (Cicero: De Orat.,\\,
5,21).
Amenophis IV who proscribed the worship of Amen to
substitute that of " the solar disk" [this in itself is a piece of non
sense—the substitution of an object, a symbol, for a god] caused
the name of Amen to be everywhere defaced, even in the cartouches of kings which employed that name to write the king's
name. " For Khunaten and his heresy of the disk in Thebes, see
Brugsch, Hist, of Egypt, i, 442. It had little or no effect on myth."
Lang's M. R. and R., ii, 95. Amenophis IV, under the guidance of his mother Tail, favoured
sun-worship apparently ; or at all events a cult which had for its emblem a " disk " whose " rays " ended in hands. He hammered and defaced on the monuments then existing the names of all the deities except Ra. Even in the ranu (cartouches) of his ancestors he knocked out the name of Amen. But he and she were fairskinned foreigners, not Egyptians ; his memory was accursed, and his name was effaced from the list of kings ; so that if he were a sun-worshipper he was denied and renounced by the nation. There seems to be no proof positive as to Amenhotep IV having been a sun-worshipper. Such statements are continually
made as that he " made a kind of religious revolution by introduc
ing the exclusive worship of the solar disk."^ This phrase " worship of the solar disk" is wholly inadmissible : worship of the
sun is understandable, but making a god of the " solar disk " is mere gibberish. The one undoubted fact is that he defaced the name of Amen, especially at Thebes. He docs not seem to have done any damage at Memphis. And it seems quite within the possibilities that he may have been an adherent of the old heavensworship, of which the O, the Universe-heavens and its omphalos was the symbol. It may be due to a great defect in the power of conception, but I confess I cannot comprehend how it is managed to connect this symbol O and its central dot or spot with the sun.
What is the solar significance of the spot ? Is the spot the sun
(and in that case what becomes of the " disk " ?) ; or is it on the
sun, and if so why ? Elsewhere De Rouge^ said that Amenhotep IV " would suffer

and Ptah:\ The White Wall. 80 a
\
The White Wall.
THE whole history of Memphis is associated with that vast
sanctuary the temple of Ptah, which included within its precincts the temples of the other gods, and was surrounded by the famous White Wall which must have comm.anded the city like a huge castle. Thence was Memphis, as well as the nome around it, called the city of the White Wall and Ha-Ptah-ka, or House of the ka (or double^) of Ptah, of the Opener. Ha-Ptah
X and Ha-Ptah-ka I , , \ — are given as the sacred
name of Memphis by Brugsch."
De Rouge' says White Wall T ' \ referred to the citadel, which
was the most ancient portion of Memphis. This then ought to have been the oldest name of the place ; and if so would fall well in with what has been said about the Grecian Thebes (p. 497). The province in which Memphis was situated was called the White
Wall nome :
][
- F JxL and not the Memphis nome. The name of
the town itself, around the White Wall, was in Coptic Memfi and
Menf, its present name. The Egyptian was Mennefer 1 with
the addition of the group A pyramid-town which M. de Rouge
thought might have been the ancient name. If so it might have meant Mouutaiu-town in the sacred mythological sense. Dr. Ebers* says Memphis itself was a corruption (Coptic Menfi or Memfi Assyrian Mimpi^) of the popular name Men-nefer, " good place, or haven of the good." As to Mennefer meaning Good-port, it has occurred to mc that the sacred meaning might be that of the French Port-de-Salut.
But why should not Men here mean stability ? ^^ is merely phonetic : mc-Ji. Men, stability, would be the same word that
from the 22nd dynasty'^ the obelisk jl, was employed to write
ideally even in the name of Amen. If this could by any means be

8o4 The Night of the Gods. \Kronos
accepted, we should have the idea of Ptah's tat and his stability
in the very name of his own town.
The word men "^^^^ with the determinant f=^ means the
heavens. Here we must look to the idea of stability also, the
" firmament " in fact.
Teta r ^ n or Thetat (^ 1 ^ j , ( Athothis) the fabulous (?)
second king of the first dynasty, is said to have built the " King's
tower," and also the " royal palace," in Memphis.' This extremely early mention of a "Tower" and a "Palace," combined with the fact that the Mount Barkal Memorial stone of Piankhi mentions Memphis as the " seat of the god Shu from the beginning of
things,"^—Shu being an Atlas—encourages the suggestion that
this Tower and Palace are celestial, like all those that occupy us
throughout this Inquiry.
[There is also a king Atetha f t| -^ M °^ ^^^ same dynasty,
who may be the same personage.] Was the White Wall originally the actual wall at Memphis,
covered with figures of the gods, or of the constellations ? If not
and even if so— I ask whether " white " should not be here taken in the sense of shining (the Egyptian word het means both) and whether the gods of this shining luait do not essentially mean the
starry host of the firviament, the gods of whom Ptah, the Polar deity, the Lord of the heavens and King of the Worlds, was the
highest.
The headdress of the Northern Egyptian gods (^ was white
and conical. Agni, bright fire, is the great holy white god of the Vedas, and Heimdal, as a Norse fire-god, is the whitest of the Asas.'' Balder
was so bright that shining rays issued from his whole body ; he was the whitest of the Ases, and the whitest of all plants (which recalls the Avestan white haoma) was compared to his brow and known by that name.* See also what is stated on this subject of
" white" and " bright," at p. 586. The Celtic word for silver (old Irish argef) is an Italic loanword (Latin argentum ; Oscan aragetud ; Armenian arcath,
1 Bragsch, Hist., i, 57. Bivd., Low. Egypt, 360. " Brugsch, ii, 420. ^ Rydberg's Teutonic Mythology, 18S9, ]i. 403. * Rhys's tJib. Lects., 529.

ap'yvpo'i). This word is from the Celtindic root m'g. meaning white and bright.^ It would seem that apjupo'^ comes from or with apyo<; ; and the Egyptian name for silver (it was scarce) is white gold. Argent in heraldry is white. The Sanskrit rajata means white and silver,
and must be a near relative of raja or rajan a king ; adiraja =
primc-Eval king. raj = to shine. The root is said to be arg; to
shine. Everything points in the direction of Argos and Argus being one and the same, the white, shining, myriad-eyed heavens. This is all the explanation we want of Atlas being whitebrowed
XevKop.eTcoiro'i, excelling in astrology, and being the inventor of the
sphere. Caput inter nubila condit. It seems also to make clear the ivory shoulder of Pelops. (See further as to Argos on p. f.) The Egg which Chaos produces in the Orphic Cosmogony is
shining and silver-white,^ and those epithets must refer to the heavens-vault. The primeval divine being of Korean myth, Dan Kun, the sandal-tree prince, descended from heaven, and took up his abode at the foot of a sandal-wood tree on the Ever-white mountains."
Here apparently we have not only the universe-axis, but the white
{z'.e. brilliant) vault of heaven.
On the death of the Babylonian, says Dr. Wallis Budge, his
soul went to " the land of the Silver Sky,"* or of the " shining sky "
;
or else to the " land of no return." This last seems to be a replica of the Egyptian region of the second death, from which there was no redemption.
It is passing strange that the same idea of the white wall has independently struck Prof Rhys as to the Irish god Nuada, the " Celtic Zeus or Mars-Jupiter." There was Nuada Argetlam (Silverhand), Nuada Derg (Red),^ Nuada Necht (a Neptune?) and Nuada Finnfail, that is Nuada of the White Fal. One attested signification of fal was wall or enclosure, and Nuada Finnfail " might be interpreted to mean Nuada of the White Wall, which might be regarded as referring, to the sky or heavens.""

Nuada Finnfail prove to mean Nuada of the White Fence, one would have to admit the probabiHty of an allusion in the epithet
to a pellucid prison like Merlin's." Nuada equals the Welsh Nudh or Lludh. Erinn is called the
island of Pal, Inis Fail, which puts it into the category of all the
divine islands, which are practically figurative of the Earth's
insulation in heavens-space. An islet in Wexford now known as
Beggery Island, is really Beg Eire that is Little Erin ; it was also
anciently known as Inis Fail. Ireland was also called Mag Fail,
Plain or Field of Pal, which is a straight parallel to the /lara, plain, in Japanese Shinto mythology where Japan is called the ReedPlain Middle-Land (Ashi-Hara no Naka-tsu-Kuni), where the reed ashi is the Axis and hara, plain, the expanse of the heavens.
Ath Finnfail, the ford of the white wall, would thus, too, answer
to the heavens-bridge of this Inquiry. Vortigern {i.e. Supreme King), whom Prof, Rhys equates with Kronos, goes to Gwynwas or Gwas Gwyn, the white mansion, the abode of the happy dead.



and PUiJi.\ Aroos, Argo, and the Argci. 807
Argos, Argo, and the Argei.
HOMER called Argos the many-fired, TroXvTrvpov, that is the
many-starred. There was Hera Argeia, and Juno both Argeia and Argia. Argeia was the mother of Argos. The names
Argos Hippium (Pegasus etc.?) and Argos Dipsion (St-v/rio?, arid

applied only to Argos) must be reserved for the present. The ship Argo, made by Argos, would clearly be the heavensboat which occupies us so much in this Inquiry, and not merely the Argo navis constellation of our spheres ; and the argo-nauta;,
apfyo-vavraL, are those who sail in that boat, the gods and the souls of the dead (alias Charon's passengers) who sail in search of the
golden fleece of the starry heavens, the fleece suspended, like the Veil which this Inqui)y makes one of its chief divisions, on the
(beech) tree of the Universe in the field of Mars, that is the Universe again. The Argo is further identified with the heavens by its mast which is an oak of the Dodona forest of Zeus, that is the Universe
tree, and gives oracles. The Argonauts set sail in it, too, from the
cape of Alaguesldi in ThcssdXy, which is nothing but the Magnetic North pole in the heavens of the theoi, the sky-gods. The ares (old form of aries), the fabulous talking ram that
furnished the xp^<^onaWov 8epa<i, is curiously enough alone nameless among all the named personages and places of the legend. One
conclusion therefore is that his proper name was the common
name of his type, and identical with 'A/a?;?, Alars. This would
indeed be a striking result of these investigations ; and still more
so would it be, if instead of the Greek kpl6<;, which is not " in it,"
to use the sporting phrase, we take the ap<i or aprjv, the Lamb. The animal was immolated to Zeus the father of Ares, and afterwards
ascended to the heavens as a constellation. This would give us
the primitive sacred animal of 'Ap?;? as that which bears his name. The dragon that watches the Fleece, and the wild brazen-hoofed
flame-breathing bulls that surround it, are variants of all the
celestial guardians, whom to catalogue is long. The name Argos of the dog of Ulysses compels us to see a
heavens-dog in this animal. One of the dogs of Acteon (Lumin

The Night of the Gods. [Kroiios
OLis?) was also called Argos, and was probably stolen by Ulysses. Hermes is a flute (that is, an Axis) god, and plays Argos, the heavens, into a deep sleep ; which is merely a Universe-harmony
mytli. The Argei (earlier Argeo and Argea) were a portion of ancient
Rome where certain most archaic sacrifices were made. The origin of the name was lost to Varro {L.L. v. 8, 14) who said : Argeos
dictos putant a principibus qui cum Hercule Argivo venere Romam et in Saturnia subsederunt. Festus said the quarter was so-called because certain illustrious men of the Argives were there buried
(was it to the N. of the city, one wonders ?) Argei loca Romae appellantur quod in his sepulti essent quidam Argivorum illustres
viri. Livy (i, 21) says that Numa instituted many sacrifices [they
are naturally attributed to him as the supreme deity, see p. 719] and the places destined to their celebrations were called Argei by
the pontiffs —Argeos pontifices vocant. This brings us to the strange human dummies made of rushes and called Argei, which are also mentioned at p. t. and which were thrown by the Vestals in the presence of the pontiffs and magistrates every year to the number of 23 (which may be an error ; xxiij for xxiiij) on the ides of May from the wooden-post or pile
bridge, pons sublicius, into the Tiber. The number 24 (= 2 x 12) would refer to the signs of the Zodiac (see also the heading Rags in the Appendix). These were said by Dionysius of Halicarnassus
(i, 19) to take the place of actual human sacrifices. And as sacrifices by drowning they must have been to the heavens-waters deities. Varro said : Argei ab Argis ; Argei fiunt e scirpis simulacra hominum xxiij ; ca quotannis de Ponte Sublicio a sacerdoti
bus publice dejici solent in Tiberim {L.L., vii, 3,90). And Festus : Argeos vocabant scirpeas effigies, quse per virgines Vestales annis
singulis jacicbantur in Tiberim. Varro also cited from Ennius, " libaque fictores, Argeos. et tutulatos " [I must not be led aside by the sacrificial cake libum or libus, which must have been originally connected with the great god Liber, norby tutulus which had to do with Tutunus.] I think we can come to no other conclusion but that these
Argei referred originally to the natives of Argos, of the shining
heavens, to whom the sacrifices were made.

and Ptali.'\ Danae. 809
Danae.
DANAfi, daughter of Akrisios, " King" of Argos, was grand
daughter of Abas, 1 2th King of Argos. The buckler of Abas, dedicated by Danaos to Here, or by /Eneas {^-En. iii) in the town of Ambracia, was, hke the Indian chakra, the terror of his enemies. Abas was son of Poseidon or of Belos, which last would make him, as his name might, a Semitic Father-god, but a-/3a9 would also be motionless or inaccessible. The myth which makes him a centaur fighting against the Lapithai shows him to have been a central deity. Hesiod put him at the head of 24 (= 12 x 2). For the Lacedemonians he was a great diviner. Abaster and Abatos, the horses of Pluto, and the xA.baton of Rhodes, are to be connected with Abas, perhaps ; as well as the Abazii or silent
festivals of Dionusios, son of Kapreos, King of Asia. Danae was shut up quite young by her father in a brazen tower. She is thus an Axis-goddess, and Zeus's golden-rain is \r
the heaven's-river, Danae's son was Perseus (see p. 411), who is exposed with his mother, according to a Moses-myth, in an old boat or a coffer. Danae like Daphne, is also a tree (the Alex
andrine laurel). Danaos, also son of Belos (6 apyalo<i), was brother of Ramasses or of Aiguptos, who (note the Moses-myth) came from Egypt to found Argos. Danaos reigns 50 years and has 50 daughters ; flees, that is, becomes a fallen god. In his flight he goes to Rhodes (Rodos), which I derive from the same root as rodon, a rose-wheel (Irish roth ; Welsh rliod, a wheel). The house of Danaos is said to issue from lo, who was of Argos. The 50 Danaides marry the 50 sons of Aiguptos, and kill them the first night. (The Lynceus myth would just now take us too far.) Pelasgos, " King " of Argos, favours the 50 nymphs (as in the tragedy of /Eschylus, who differs from other poets). The Tantalos-punishment of the Danaides, who in Tartaros perpetually fill a sieve-bottomed barrel,
contains a reference to the perennial circulation of the Universe
waters. But we must go behind Danaos and Danae, to the god-name
Dan, Zan (Zanos).^ Den, Zen (Zenos) = Zeus; and Zand ( =

attributed the invention of geomancy. The Danai of havaov ^'Apyo'i were thus clearly a supreme heavens-race, the celestial prototypes of the Danai-Greeks, or Danaidai. Nor must we forget the Suvukt] or coin given to Charon ; and I shall decidedly hazard the suggestion that we have in this
syllable dan- the true divine origin of the word dance, the existing etymologies of which are unbearable and unintelligible.
The transition is now irresistible to the Irish tri dee Dana, the Three Gods of Destiny. Prof Rhys says the name of the goddess Danu " has nothing to do with them "
; but I wonder whether this statement might not be reconsidered. It differs from Keating,^ as Prof. Rhys points out. Danu or Donu gave Danann, or Donann, or Donand in the genitive case ; but Danann and Donand were also nominative, and gave a genitive Donainne. Danu was tJie Irish supreme goddess par excellence (Irish goddess = dea ;
genitive de, dee, dei, dea, dae). The Irish pantheon are thus called the Tuatha (tribes) de (of the goddess) Danann ; which I maintain to be a straight celestial parallel to the Aavai or AavatSai of the Argos-heavens ; while the tuath (tribe) Dea or Dei (of the goddess), otherwise the fir (men) Dea, are an Irish race, another and terrestrial reproduction of the AavatSai-Greeks. In Welsh Danu becomes Don and her " tribes " the Children of Don. Arionrhod, Silver-wheel, the Heavens, is a daughter of Don ; but
she is also in the Welsh triads a daughter of Beli, who must be the
Belos (?>. Bel) that we also have in the family-tree of the Aavai (Manu has a genitive Manann or Manand which is also a nomi
native.)

Seb-Kronos.
THE Greeks assimilated Seb to Kronos, but Seb was the
male Earth, the spouse of Nut the heavens-goddess. Thus, sex apart, and earth to earth, Seb was parallel to Rhea. But there are points about Seb which somewhat justify the Greeks. He was considered to have reigned before Osiris ; he was the
father and also the erpa of the gods ; his name was written
^a °
^\ 1 Seb (^^ and also <^ the Q.g<g, sa — son). His images are
very rare, though he is often painted in temples or on mummy
cofifins. He appears erect, with the '^;:^ on his head in the right
bottom of a coffin of Sotimes (Louvre) ; but he is generally seen,
supine, ithyphallic and covered (earthlike) with foliage, below the
heavens arched over him ^f^. By one account the Egg of the universe was laid by Seb ; the major myth is of course that which assigns it to Ptah and Khnum. Seb-Kronos is given high rank in Lord Lytton's mysterious tale The Ring of Amasis, and

The Seven Kabeiroi.
"^HE numerous points connected with Ptah and with the Number Seven which have here been touched on would be left sadly incomplete if all mention of the Cabires or Ka/:^tt/3ot of Herodotus (ii, 51 ; iii, 37) were omitted. For Herodotus made them the seven sons of Ptah, whom he and the Greeks, however, called Hephaistos ; perhaps because of an alternative name of Memphis: Het-Ra-Ptati, " house of the Ra of Ptah." The aira^ Xeyo/xevov, YlaTaiKol, which he represents to be the Phoenician name of the Phoenician figure-heads that resembled the pygmy Memphian images of Ptah and the Cabires, insulted and burnt by the great, but insane, Cambyses, might almost have rather reached the Greek from the Egyptian, so much does the word resemble a derivative from Ptah. This etymology is obvious even superficially, and I see that Bunsen, or the late Dr. Birch {Egypfs Place,



Kabeiroi?\ The Seven Kabciroi. 8i
&c., i, 45) had already made the suggestion. I here give rough drawings from Sir Gardner Wilkinson^ of some of the figures from Memphis which no doubt are similar to those Cambyses and Herodotus saw ; and I think there can be no doubt whatever of their
being of an extremely archaic, almost savage, character and origin far, far prior to the stiff orthodox representation of Ptah of the genuine Egyptian type, which I have given from the same source
(plate 25) ; at pp. 214, 217 (under Tat of Ptah) (see p. 814) ; and
to the fact that the eyes are the mystic hieroglyphic ufa ^^%
eye (which is not so clear as it might be in the small scale drawing). This is what is now called " the eye of the Northern and Southern Horus"; but it is proposed to claim for it here a Ptahic significance. I give here one of these Eyes from a
bas-relief of the great temple of Dendera. It is a single one, drawn along in a barque (^Description de
I'Egypte, planches iv, 22, 2) and I connect it (pp. 467, 496, 512) with the All-seeing E}-e of heaven, the Polar
Star. [It is the Eye of Horus, and nothing else. E. A. W. B.] To return to the Cabires. Crcuzer said that the pataikoi, who ordinarily had the form of dwarfs or pigmies, also frequently took

big-bellied and even markedly spherical forms. And he suggested further that they may have thus gradually undergone a complete transformation into those vases or vase-gods, surmounted by a
TT^v (!-'TT7^''"^' ^^-^'
head, and called Canopes perhaps from the mystic vase with that name in the city of Canopus near Alexandria, where remarkable traces of the worship of the Cabires have been found. An ancient mistaking of the still extant Coptic name of the city-Kahennub,
or "golden soil "— seems answerable for the localisation of much of this mythicism. An ancient fable says that, just as Canopus was the pilot of Osiris his fleet, so Canobus, so revered in Lower Egypt, was the pilot who took Menclaus and Helen to that country ; and dying there, his head was put upon a vase covered with characters, and pricked with minute points or holes, in which vase, fire, and water, struggled for the mastery. The head on the vase is sometimes female, and hands are added at the sides, as if to emphasize the personification of the Sphere-god.^ Creuzer also brought together the spherical vases and the Egg of the Universe ; but it is singular that though always approaching it, he nowhere hit off the exact point of these analogies of his, which seems to be
' A'c'//£-. de FAnl., ii, 311.

that the spherical vases represent the Sphere of the Universe, where, as in the Canobus myth, the two first principles of life,
heat and moisture—fire and water—struggle into fructification. Nor will this view be discordant with the fact that Canopus is also the most brilliant star of the ship constellation Argo ; and the minute prickings upon the vase would clearly represent the hosts
of heaven. Another development of the hoddy-doddy dwarf conception was in the direction of a more human-looking pygmy armed with the lance,^ which we have here so often seen as the symbol of the heaven's axis. M. Babelon says " The Phoenician pataeci, images of the god Pumai (a word from which pygmy and Pygmalion are derived) were only copies of the Egyptian gods Bes or the embryo Ptah " (p. 264), and " the type most frequently copied by the Phoenicians is the grotesque god Bes or the embryo god Ptah, whom they turned into the god Pygm?eus, called Patrecus by Herodotus " (p. 279). Elsewhere we have mention of " the god Bss, of Egyptian origin, the god Pygmaeus " (p. 259). Again : " the god Pygmffius, who is made up, as we have seen, of Bes and Izdubar together" (p. 276).

placed on bed-heads and on women's toilet-tools. " Represented
in adoration before the rising sun." [It is impossible to say what De Rouge here interpreted as " the rising Sun."] Strikingly like the attendants of the Assyrian winged man-bulls. " One of the legends of Bes make him come from Taneter, i.e., Somali-land."
[But ta-nuter — divine-land also.] Warlike character and taste for music recall centaurs of Greece. His bronze images are rare ; they are common in wood, stone, and baked clay, which seems to indi
cate great archaism. Bes received other names, and occurs in groups in which his marks are mingled with those of other gods. With the attributes of Amen " he composes a pantheistic divinity " [an idea difficult to
the precisian]. Sometimes he is double-headed [that is dual
most primitive notion] as in the end-pictures of some funereal rituals. He often wears on the head a naos in which is a Hapi bull. In the symbolic group known as " Horus on the crocodiles " and the "old man growing young," the monstrous head of Bes is
always in the arch of the little Stela | 1 [and is presumably the
old-man god, while the child-Horus (?) is the new generation].^
M. Pierret adds that the PeremJiru identifies Bes with Set, and that he is Set on the stelae just mentioned : a theory to which one does not see one's way. He has been compared, says M. Pierret {Diet.), with " the archaic type of the winged Gorgon and the female form of Siva." His head-dress may be palm-leaves.
I think we must first put aside, for separate use if necessary,
the Typhon -f- Set view of Bes. Next let us discard almost altogether the dwarf theory, unless, indeed, in the magical sense in which Vishnu became the swelling dwarf Vamana ; for the main idea imparted by the images is well described by our term " brute
force," and he is rightly compared to H erakles. These images too
are proofs positive of an extremely archaic pre-artistic type superstitiously adhered to. His dancing makes him a supreme heavensgod, and so he is correctly connected with the Centaurs. His r"2lations to the Hapi bull bring him nearer to Ptah ; and his Northern head-dress and dual heads would also be correct for a supreme central heavens-god. His warrior qualities make him like Ares, also a supreme central deity. His beneficent employments indicate a good and not an evil god.

Brugsch gives Bes a sacred animal also called bes j '^^ vvhich
enters as a syllable into the proper names of the 26th dynasty. I think too it may be conceded me that we have in the Jinni Shaibar, in Galland's Arabian Nights tale of Prince Ahmed and the Peri Banu, another instance of a Cabire. He was but a foot and a half high ; was humped before and behind ; had an immense pig-eyed head covered with a pointed bonnet ; a bushy beard thirty feet long ; and carried an iron bar of five hundredw^eight on his shoulder. He was also, like the Grecian Ares, of a temperament so violent that nothing could stay his avenging hand.^ Pot-bellied dwarfs are also found on the moneys of the island of
Cossura.After all that has been said in this Treatise about the central fire of the Universe, we need not be surprised to find that the Cabires, the sons of Hephaistos, were also considered as fire
powers or fire-gods. [The protrusion of the tongue, as seen in the Egyptian images I have here figured, is still a gesture of honour among some savage tribes, and even, as Hue's Travels abundantly show, among the Mongols and the Lamas of Thibet. The following specimen of tongue-protrusion is taken from a figure of Vishnu in Moor's Hindu Pantheon (plate 26).] A further proof of the utterly far-back origin of the worship of the Cabires is the fact of their having been mysterious to everyone of the ancients who wrote upon them or came across them, including of course Cambyses and Herodotus themselves. It was said that their true names w^ere
declared only to the initiated, which would give us a close parallel to what is stated elsewhere as to Mithra. One may be permitted to wonder whether these " true names " were known even to the adepts. The other names by which they were known are but
adjectival ; mere vague indications of high qualities. Francois Lenormant, whom they much exercised, gives the reading Kabirim for their Phoenician name, which would thus simply mean the Great, the Powerful,^ as Bochart long ago pointed out. That the Phoenician Kabirim were seven, and that they were the " sons " or
' I have elsewhere (pp. 126, 304, 758) pointed out other heaven -worship analogies in this tale, and in that which fellows it in Galland, which has the Princess Paiizade for heroine. 2 Neumann : N'miii iuediti\\ (iv, 10-14). ^ Orig. de mist. 542.



8i8 The NigJit of the Gods. [The
the " brothers " of an Eighth, who was either Siidduq (the Just) or
Eshmun (the Eighth)—the Phoenician yEsculapius— or the two rolled into one, is clear enough from Sanchoniathon and from Isidore's Life by Damascius. Abd-Eshmun, servant of Eshmun,
is a pious personal Semitic name.^ Eshmun is found in Coptic as shmun, and at Carthage as Ashmun (by Quatremere). He was worshipped at colonial Carthage as well as at Berytus (Beyrout) where he had a famous
temple.I draw attention to the curious datum of the Seven Rishis as
Eight in the Vayu-Purana, p. tThe Welsh for week, wythnos, means eight-night ; the German says acht Tage ; there were eight (7+0 Irish Maini ; eight officers of Arthur's court act as w^atchmen, dividing the year between them (Seven of these being subordinate to one) ; and Woden's Ring Draupnir (= dropper) dropped eight others like itself
every ninth night.'^ We have thus 7 + 1=8, and 8+1=9, which it is well to bear in mind. The Greeks called the Cabires civaKTe^, Rulers ; Varro calls them dei magni et potes, and they
were also named dii potentes, and sometimes dii socii, or the associated gods. Creuzer concluded that without any doubt they were the Eight great Egyptian gods with, and including Ptah at their head : and it was matter of ancient notoriety that the Egyptian god whose name the Greeks rendered as Hephaistos
that is, Ptah—and also their own Asklepios (probably Ptah's son
Imhotep) were indifferently named as the god of Memphis.
Ammianus Marcellinus {H/st. Liv. xxii) so calls /Esculapius. Pausanias (x, 32), speaking of the temple of Asklepios near Tithorea, says he was there called 'Apxay^ra^ the primaeval leader. In explaining the Phoenician and Canaanite Siiduq by The Just, we must take "just " in its original sense of straight, right, upright,
even, balanced ; and then Sudiiq clearly becomes an admirable epithet for the central, immovable, impartial, greatest deity of the heavens. In fact Creuzer equated Suduq and Ptah (Hephaistos).^ [Haoshyanga the grandson of Gayomanth, the first man-god of Zoroastrianism, was called Peshdad, the Just, or the Law (Avestan,
' Kelig. of the Semites, 1889, p. 68. ^ Damascius ap. Phot. Cod. 242. •< Rhys's Hib. Lects., 360, 364, 367, 368, 372. » Relig. de VAvt., ii, 124, 242, 285, 1094. t See Index to References before Index.

Paradhata). He is given the introduction of iiie-vvorship, which
simply means he was a central fire-god.^] As to Eshmun, the Eighth, too, we must discard the idea of primacy, in the first, and look at the octarchy as ranking the other
way up, as an ascending, not a descending series ; the last being in
this case the first. Creuzer suggested that both in Phoenicia and in Egypt the Seven Cabires were " the seven planets " : in itself a loose and
unscientific phrase when one reflects that it includes the Sun
and the Moon. Schelling took a similar line.^ But if this were ever true, it must have been at a comparatively late date, when the names of the great gods had been ascribed to certain of the planets, and can never have been (as I endeavour to show under the heading of " The Number Seven ") in the youth of the human world. My suggestion would be that in the Seven Cabires, we have the Seven Rishis, the stars of Ursa Major, the seven Khnumu, "Q y
uniters or architects, who assisted Ptah in his labours, otherwise
the seven Thesasu. Khnum as the fabricator of gods and of men is shown making
a human figure or the Egg on a potter's wheel. \\\ Khufu (Cheops) is called khnum, builder, of the great pyramid, in one of its chambers (Col. Campbell's) in the red-paint marks of
the masons on the stones. I think we can still detect other corroborations of this theory.
The Cabirian mysteries were celebrated at night, and the initiated executed a circular ritualistic dance, to the sound of the sacred hymns, round the neophyte clothed in the purple, veiled, and seated on a throne. This ceremony was called Qpovwai^ or dpoviayid^ (as one of the Orphic hymns was called OpoviaixoC) and in it we might discern a connection with the course, the dance, of the Seven round the Pole in the Vedas, which I have already so abundantly
illustrated. These initiations were also phallic orgies, according to Herodotus, and there is plenty of evidence, as I have from time to
time incidentally indicated, of the connection between the Axis and the phallic symbolism. Mariners prayed to the Cabires in bad weather : and of old sailed their ships by the Great Bear, and even by the Little Bear, if we may trust Aratos, who wrote his Greek astronomical poem
' West's Pahlavi 7'exts, iii, 57. - Creuzer and Guiijniaut : Rcli^'. tic t Ant., ii, 2S5, 1074.

Phenomena about three centuries before our era. He said both
Bears were called by the name afia^a, a chariot. Also that the Greek navigators whom Homer calls e\iK(07ra<; were guided by the
Great Bear, 'EX1V77, rather than by the pole-star, which, or the Little Bear, the Phcenicians used. This may have been a result of the
greater skill of the Phoenician mariners ; or the differing practice
may have originally arisen out of worship. Aratos distinctly recorded that Ursa Minor served as a guide to the Phoenician pilots
of Carthage. {^PJicsnom. v. 39 ; Cicero : Nat. Deor. ii, 41.) Thales, wrote K. O. Miiller,^ recommended his countrymen to copy the Phoenicians and steer by Ursa Minor ; which was called
the Phoenician constellation, and also the Dog's-tail. Marcianus Capella^ says the Egyptian paintings showed a ship with seven pilots, all alike and brothers. The Phoenicians put the Kabirim as figure-heads upon their ships, as we have seen, and also upon their
coins ; they were thus, therefore, perhaps the greatest gods of this greatly seafaring race, and Sanchoniathon even gave the construction of rafts and ships to their " descendants." Another fragmentary myth will have it that Dardanos, who invented rafts, bore the Cabires, the divine protectors of navigation, on a raft to Sam.othrace, which was from him also called Dardania. Captain Conder points out in his Syrian Stone-Lore that a Phoenician terra-cotta model of a galley from Amathus is steered by a pataikos with an enormous head ; this galley has the symbolic central supernal eye on its prow.
This ship's-eye is thus common to the Chinese and the Phoenicians ; and it survives upon the Neapolitan and the Chinese prows, which, as to height, resemble those of the Phcenicians. M. Leon Henzey also says^ that Egyptologists suspect a connection between the words pataikos and Ptah, and he refuses certainty to the theory which makes the pataikoi images of the Phoenician god Bes. Pigmy figures attributed to Ptah-Sokaris are often found about Memphis. On a medal of Trajan (Farncse Museum) a Cabirean god is shown wearing a bonnet terminating in a point, and holding a branch, as well as an astrologer's square^ ; and we have seen that the Chinese made Ursa Major the Regulators. In the Medici lararinni is or was a bronze statue of a Cabirean god standing on
one foot— which may, like the Eg}'ptian Ptah's single leg, be an

allusion to the universe-axis —and wearing a bonnet of conical form ; his eyes are scarcely open, which may be an occult reference to the closed eyes of Kronos (II or El) which have been already adduced from Sanchoniathon. Capt. Conder, having described the gyrations of the dervvishes at the white monastery of the Malawiyeh (Mevlei) at Tripoli in Syria, says : We could not doubt that the ancient dance we witnessed was that of the Cabiri, the seven " great ones " or planetary gods, revolving round the green centre of the
terrestrial globe {Heth and Aloab, pp. 72, loi). I could scarcely desire a better confirmation of my own theory : only I go farther back than planet-worship. He also (p. 142) speaks of the seven
altars raised at various sites to the seven chief gods, the Cabiri,
whom he says (p. 210) the seven black stones at Uruk typified.



82 2 The Night of the Gods. \The
The Kabeiroi Generally,
IT must not be thought that we are devoting too much time to
the Cabires. Their worship was widespread in Phoenicia, Greece, and Egypt ; and it must be our business presently to connect or identify them with a great number of archaic fraternities of godhoods and priesthoods, such as the Abbadires, Dioscures, Anaces (Anaktes), Piotes, ArvaHan Brothers, Eleusinian mysteries, Atrides, HeracUdes, Cercopes, Lares, Cobales, Penates,
Goes, Sahi, Corybantes, Satrapes, Curetes, Telchines, and Dactyles, Tripatores. The images of the Cabires have been found on the coins of Phoenicia (TripoH), Thessalonica, Smyrna, Hephaistia in Lemnos, and in the island of Imbros. There seems to be a general consensus that, as Bottiger and Movers agreed, the Cabirean cult was brought to the Asiatic islands of Samothrace, Lemnos and Imbros
by the Phoenicians. But it also flourished in the towns of the
Troad, notably and archaically at Pergamos itself. Berytus (Beyrout) is signalised as a prominent Phoenician sanctuary of theirs. Vestiges of Cabires worship have also been discovered in the Asiatic island of Thasos, which neighbours on Samothrace ; in Crete, as we should have expected from the ancient Cretan worship of Kronos, or II, which also came from Phoenicia ; in Boeotia, in the province of Messenia, and especially at Athens. It spread westwards, and became characteristic and of first importance in ancient Italy. The Greeks appear to have
detected it in Celtic countries,^ and traces of it were recognised by
the ancients— orso they thought— in the British Islands.^ Its priests
were also called Cabjres, for the priest ever seeks to identify
himself with his god, and is so identified wholly or in part by the worshippers. That there were Cabirean games, too, was pointed

out by Eckhel/ who alleged a medal found in Lemnos with the legend Ka/Seipetd Hvdta ^i. In degenerate times the Roman emperors courted the honorary title of Cabires on their coins, and Antoninus, Marcus Aurclius, Commodus, Lucius Verus, and even Faustina have so been found on the coins of the once Phoenician
Tripoli.^ But the most celebrated sanctuary of the Cabires was that founded in all probability by the Tyrians in Samothrace, an island whose history is in its every epoch steeped and dyed in myth. It may perhaps be suggested that the Tyrrhene Pelasgians are not unconnected with the god Tyr. Wherever they are to be found, said K. O. Muller, there too is found the Cabiric religion.^ Herodotus said (ii, 51) that the archaic Pelasgoi established the orgies
of Samothrace ; and the Pelasgoi —it is common propertyworshipped from all time the potent starry hosts of heaven, whom they called deoi, which Plato (Crat. 397C) connected with Oeoi and the movement of the heavenly bodies, Herodotus (ii, 52) with the ordinance and government of the universe (Oevre^), while others have brought it from dedofiac, to look upon, to keep watch,
to control ; and there is, too, the obvious verb deco, to scud along.
Any of these derivations, all of them, are suitable to the divine powers of the firmament ; nor must we forget a term which is very
possibly closely allied dvco, to be divinely frenzied, to burn
incense, to sacrifice. These Oeot were also called /jieydXot, ')(pr]a7oi,
SvvaToi, the mighty or lofty ones ; the pure or the oracular or the
beneficent ; the powerful ; the last of which epithets is a straight
translation of Kabirim.* The inscription Deo Cabiro on a coin^ seems to give Cabirus its adjectival sense. K. O. Muller thought the worship of the Kabeiroi must be referred to Thebes (see p. 497) as its metropolis.
A short excursus on the deoi will not, I hope, be here quite
thrown away, ©eou became deolo in the Ionic dialect, and Oiotaa, for Oeovaa, was " a running " (from Oeco). The dictionaries used to derive deo<; from " 6eco, to set, to make," but if they had only brought it from the same verb in its more primitive sense of " to run, to race, to send along," they would have exactly hit off the

perpetual (apparent) motions of the heavenly host of the Qeoi K. O. Muller^ makes the name (Beta equal to Brightness. I fancy it would be no easy task wholly to disprove the
originally more or less close relation of all the words here mentioned. Take Oka, a show, compare it with Qea a goddess, and the latter becomes the self-manifested ; just as Qeaw, to show
oneself, in its highest application referred to the gorgeous selfdisplay of the supreme heavens. And that is probably why 6ecopia, the act of gazing [at the 6eoi, at the heavens] came to
mean the annual or octennial (?) solemn embassy to Delos in the
state ship decopU, in which the Athenians sent their Oewpoi, their
gazers and their priests, to consult the oracle. These theoroi or
speirers were sent octennially by the Corcyroeans to Delphos
(Pans. x,.9) and also by the Achaians {ibid. i8), to bring back a branch of the sacred laurel at which Apollo had made atonement. This explains, too, decopla coming even to mean the sacred public
ritualistic functions and games ; 6edpiov, a holy place, a temple where the Oewpoi met ; and diarpov, a theatre. Then we have, always in the same connection, Odco {Oeew, an
Ionic verb) to see with wonder ; Oavpud^w, to wonder, to revere ;
and 6(ovfia (6av/ia) a miracle ; 6v(o, to sacrifice, to burn incense, to be divinely frenzied {0ulco) ;

these words to the witches' sabbat, and to Sabaoth, the hosts (of
the heavens), or to try and explain Sabaean from the Syriac tsaba, washing, as Littre does the French Sabeen, Sabeisme, Sabien, and Sabisme ; adding that it is by an abuse and an error that Sabeisme is applied to the adoration of the stars. I should much rather, then, err with Voltaire, who wrote to Catherine II on loth August,
1773 : Je me borne a lever les mains vers I'Etoile du Nord, je suis de la religion dea Sabeens : ils adoraient une etoile. I am glad to
hail the aid of Sir G. Birdwood, who says^ Sabaism is so term.ed from the Hebrew tsebaoth, armies, applied particularly to the hosts of heaven, astral and angelic ; and it means " the worship of the
7 planets and 12 signs of the zodiac and of the stellar bodies
generally." (See what is elsewhere said (pp. 160, 510) about the modern Subbas who call themselves Mandoyo.) [The reader is requested here to be careful to refer to what is said about Thebes at

At Samothrace the images of the Cabires were jealously guarded with mysterious care, and Pausanias (iv, i) cites three successive reformers of the mysteries of Demeter and the Cabires ; although their Latin axamehta, or axis-hymns remained in later times all
but unintelligible to the priest who chanted them.The name Abadir for the swaddled stone with which Rhea deceived Saturn^ clearly proves a Semitic origin for that stonemyth ; for ab-adir means Glorious Father, and is thus at once an alias for Jupiter and the title of the holy stone or Greek betylos.
It also shows that we should read into the myth, as the earliest names we can now find, those Phcenician ones of Amma, II, Ba'al, and Beth-iil, instead of Rhea, Saturn, Jupiter, and Betylos. This is confirmed for us by St. Augustine (Ep. 17) who mentions the African Abbadires as divinities that were baitulia or holy stones ;

and explains their name as " powerful fathers." This has induced Munter^ to suggest that the Abbadires of Carthage were the same as the Cabires of Phoenicia : which would be giving the Cabires, from another quarter, the very high antiquity which has been here claimed for them. The priests of the Abbadires were called
Enc-addires.
The priest who presided, at all events at the initiation mysteries
of the Cabires, was called the Ko?;? or Ko/t;?, which Bochart derived from the Hebrew Cohen, a priest. Schelling also explained it from the Hebrew as being a purifier or a prophet ; but Freret and Welcker made Greek of it, the former saying it meant an auditor. The functions of the Koes were important. He received the confessions of novices, and could absolve from murder, provided it was
not complicated with sacrilege by being committed in a temple. Perjury was also, as a crime against the gods, a reserved case.^ That the Cabires shared a pretty general fate and became fallen divinities, may be seen from the tales of the revolt of the Telchines
(which see) against Bacchus,^ and of the two Corybantes putting their third brother Dionysos to death, which are echoes of each
other and of other typical heavenly rebellions and slaughters. Cicero, too, mentions a Dionysos, son of Cabirus, who was one of the Cabires as well one of the Anaces or Tritopatores of Attica."* We shall see farther on that the Telchines had a bad reputation ; and in Malta at this day the Punic word qbir or kibir survives with
the signification of devil.^ But, having considered the Cabires generally, and also as Seven in number, it is now requisite to treat of them as a Triad, as a Duad, and even as Unity; and we shall thus perhaps find adequate reasons for extending the term Kabeiroi to all the great primitive gods, and
even for circumscribing the origin and position of these last, until we, by a number of concurrent and convergent considerations, gather them all up into one, two, or three central, supernal, polaraxis deities. And here, it may again be repeated, we are by no means wasting time and space, but are arguing and proceeding
directly to the conclusions of this Inquiry into Polar-Star Worship.

K. O. Mliller held KaS/itA-o? (who is so much mixed-up with the Kabeiroi) to be but another form of KaS/^o?. In this he followed " the old grammarians " and a scholium of Phavorinus. Hermes he argues was called by both names by Lycophron. The doublenamed god was adored in Samothrace, To the three Kabeiroi of that island (say the scholia to Apollonius of Rhodes) a fourth is added in Kadmilos, who is identical with Hermes, according to Dionysodorus. Akousilaos " the logographer " said that from Kabeira and Hephaistos sprang Kadmilos, from him the three Kabeiroi, and from them the Kabeirian nymphs.- Miiller also recorded a plausible suggestion that KaS/io? and Ka^w to create, to form, are connected; Kadmos being thus "the Creator, the Former."

The Three Kabeiroi.
THE most remarkable of all the accounts of this Triad is that
giv^en by Pherecydes, the teacher of Pythagoras, both on ac
count of its early date in the sixth century B.C., and because it tallies with the Egyptian and Phoenician facts. Pherecydes^ made the Three Cabires children of Hephaistos and Ka^lpa, daughter of Proteus, a Fortune-god who revealed the future when he could be got hold of; for, like Kronos, he concealed himself, was furtive,
wily, difficult of access. But these three Cabires were in reality six, that is three male and female pairs, who were worshipped in the isles of Lemnos and Imbros, and in the towns of the Troad. This pairing merely indicates the duality that is found all over the Eastern and the Classic areas, where an untold number of single
deities split up into sexual pairs : and we shall further on track
down the idea into the Two Cabires. It should also be noted in passing that Ptah-Siiddiiq and Eshmun, when represented as the
father of the Seven Cabires, are without consorts, and must thus
be regarded as androgynous, the earliest form of the dual divine
idea.
The old historian Akonsilaos^ coincides with Pherecydes.
But the historian Mnaseas, as preserved for us by the Scholiast of Apollonius of Rhodes (i, 917) also gave a strange Triad of deities as belonging to the Cabirean island of Samothrace. These bore the very strange and striking names of Axieros, Axiokersos, and Axiokersa, whom he identified with Demeter, Hades, and Persephone. Pausanias (ix, 25) calls Demeter and Persephone Cabirian, and then conceals his ignorance of the Cabiri under an
affectation of mystery and dread of the sacrilege of disclosure.
This must now pass for a literary or rhetorical artifice. It is clear,
however, -that he uses the term as an adjectival epithet for the great gods, for he also makes Prometheus one of the Cabiri, the wrath of the Cabiri implacable, and their mysteries the gift of Demeter. The Scholiast of Apollonius of Rhodes said they were Demeter, Persephone, Hades, and Hermes. Here we clearly have names into which enters the very remarkable adjective a^i6<i, which I

should very much desire to connect with a^wv, the Universe axe
tree, and also the Pole of the heavens. If this could be granted me, we should have a triad of axial deities in Axi-Eros, AxioKersos, and Axio-Kersa. Movers and A. Maury suggested^ (as though it were any explanation) that Axios, like Siiddiiq (as
above) is but an honorific epithet. But we can also trace back through the Latin into ancient Latium a Jupitur Axurus, which is generally given as A«xurus, from the town, mountain, and stream in Latium called Anxur, But the stream was also the fons Neptunis, and Neptune was a central god ; and the mountain, the stream, and Jupiter together take us rather to the heaven-river and the mountain which is the Universe-axis. I therefore opine for Axur ; and if we take the modern derivation of axis from a
root ag or ak (Skt. aj) to drive, the deity and deities at the axisend, the nave, the umbilicus, would be not alone axis-gods but
primarily driving-gods, the impellers, the compellers, of the rolling
heavens.
Quce gelidis ab stellis axis aguntur. — {Li/cre/his, vi, 721.)
where axis means the North Pole.^ Axi-Eros would then be, like ''ljjLepo<; (whence, it would appear, the island Imbros) and "E/909, simply Divine Supreme (or com
pelling) Love or Desire, the cJuville ouvriere, to borrow an apt
expression ; and I must here digress to show that Desire was in more than one Cosmotheogony a central supernal numen.
The Sidonians posited before all things Time (II or Kronos), then the pair Desire and Darkness, as produced in and by Time. From the union of this pair sprang Aer (air) and Aura (breath, female) ; and this couple it was that produced the cosmic Egg.^ But, according to Sanchoniathon, Rua'h (breath) becoming enamoured of its own principle, the mystic coalescence (where
we have an epuration of the Herm-Aphroditean idea) was called Hipesh (Desire), and gave rise to Mot (Mut, mother) in the form
of an Egg, which illumined itself; and so the sun, moon, stars, and
planets shone.* The Egg here, as to its shell, seems clearly to
figure forth the vault of the heavens.

Again, according to Statius, Lectantius, and Theodontius, the
Greeks made Earth, or T?"}, Tartaros, and Love (Eros, Desire)
actually precede Ouranos, the heavens, who was the last son of
Mother Earth^ or Trj/xriTrjp, who is all one with AT]/j.7]Trip. " Hesiod
indeed," said Pausanias (ix, 27), " or at least the author of the Theogony, says that Chaos was first generated, afterwards Earth,
and then Tartarus and Love." Here we get very close to Mnaseas, as above, with his Demeter, Hades, and Persephone. Varro- mentions the Egyptian Isis as among the Cabirean deities whom he
calls dii potes ; and Isis is a parallel to Demeter. Hades too was
by Plato^ otherwise called Zeus Chthonios. Hesiod {TJieog. 116) made chaos absolutely first ; followed by Gaia, Tartaros, and Eros. Chaos alone produced Erebos and Night (Nu^). Gaia produced Ouranos (as above) and bore to him afterwards Okeanos and Titan, Caecus and Crius, Hyperion lapetus, Thea and Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys ; and youngest after these Kronos of crooked counsel, who ever
detested his powerful sire Ouranos. Another genealogy of the primeval gods is clearly meant by Proclus when (on the Cratylus) he makes the Royal Series of gods to be Phanes, Nux, Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus and Dionysos. Syrianus (on Aristotle's Metaphysics, bk. xiv) makes ancient theologians assert that Nux and Ouranos reigned ; and prior to these the illustrious Erikepaios, their mighty father. In the Phaedrus Plato seems to make the first intelligences (t-ou?) Phanes,
Ouranos, Ge, and the sub-celestial arch (7; virovpavio'i a-^i^)^ These Platonic refinings were endless, entangling and embarrassing ; elsewhere Taylor (vir in Platonicorum philosophia versatissimus, as Boissonade called him) makes " Herakles, according to the Orphic theology, the same with the celebrated Phanes or Protogonon, the exemplar of the universe."- Now the clear fact of the matter is this that Phanes is not a name but a definition indicating that the protogonon, the first-generated power, appeared, and was not made. This was what Lactantius (i, 5) pointed out that Orpheus meant, viz., that the true and great god was he
before whom nothing was generated, but that from him all was generated ; and he was thus called a phanes an appearance and

existence from infinity. Ausonius in his Epigrams (28, 29) makes out that the Ogygian (Theban) Bacchus, the Egyptian Osiris, the Indian Dionysos, the Roman Liber, the Arabian Adoneus, and the Lucanian Pantheus, were all identical with the Fhanes of the
mystics (quod erat absurdum). According to the Orphic cosmogony, Kronos (Time) generated Chaos and ^ther. Chaos produced the Egg, shining and silver white, which gave birth to Phanes the bi-sexed, but this seems clearly a bungle, in view of what is said as to Phanes above. Phanes also seems to make a triad with Metis and Erikapaios, but
this again must be a later " restoration." Mr. Andrew Lang' quotes Clement of Alexandria (p. 6'j2) as saying that " in the fourth generation the Egg gave birth to Phanes the great hero of the Orphic cosmogony." Here Clement seems to have been heretical. The Zulus, as reported by Bishop Callaway, say of Unkulunkulu, or Old-Old, their first man, that " he came to be." This is Phanes
over again.
In Hinduism again we have first the solitary Brahm, exempt from all duality. The Universe has Brahm's name and shape ; but still Brahm alone subsists nameless, shapeless ; the rest being all but a vain phantom of existence, of which Maya, who produces
naught but illusions, is the essence. She is the Desire of Brahm,
who is eternal divine Will.^ In the Veda.s'^ : In the beginning there was neither non-entity, nor entity. Darkness was enveloped in darkness. There was undistinguishable water. The One was developed by the power
of fervour (? heat). Desire first rose in It.
The Celts reckoned Dis ( = Roman lanus) the father of all, and regarded darkness and death as preceding light and life. Thus the day began with night, and the year began on November-eve, when the power of darkness gains the ascendant.* Compare Ennius {Ann. i, 27) Ouos omnes Erebo perhibent, et Nocte
creates. (Obiter, it is difficult to separate the Desire of the Hindus and
Buddhists from Schopenhauer's Wille. It seems to give us his groundwork.)

This makes it sufficiently clear that Eros, Desire-^and a fortiori
Axi-Eros—was a central primaeval divine personality in many of
the ancient schemes of initial evolution. And, as regards the Three Cabires, Axieros may thus safely be taken to occupy the first rank as the Unity and fecund source whence sprang the male and female duality Axiokersos and Axiokersa ; for as E. Vinet
pointed out, Kepao<; and Kepcra, like Kopo'? and Koprj, €pao<;, and eparj, must be regarded as simply verbal exponents of the male and female principles which produce and reproduce all the forms of
Nature, just like the Japanese Izanagi and Izanami of our startingpoint. The Phoenician names of these principles seem to have been the Semitic words Tholad and Tholatha, procreator and generatrix,^ where, it is by no means idle to remark, we seem to have endings very much resembling our own lad and lass. Thalath was the Chaldean name of the goddess Omorca (Tiamat), and became Thalatta in Greek, according to the fragments of Berosus. This gives us the moisture principle of the two which form the duality. Bel (Merodach) cut the goddess in two and so made heavens and earth.^ The (Tartar?) Chuvash tribes near the Volga call their sacred enclosures keremet. Besides Thor they also adore, it would seem. a triad with this name : Keremet the father, Keremet the mother, and Keremet the son.^ Their neighbours, the Mordvin Finns, also have this Keremet enclosure. It is strangely like the Mahavedi or sacrificial ground of the Satapatha-Brahmana/* Its southern
entrance, its central sacred tree and its Yuba (Sanskrit, Yupa)
sacrificial post are worthy of close attention. The Hon. J.
Abercromby has written most usefully on these Finns. The Votyak Finns make Keremet the evil younger brother of Inmar, the heavens-god. He gives his name to the sacred groves where he is worshipped because he may work mischief^ Vambery says he is the evil Korlimes of the Altai Tartars and Schiefner thinks this is a perversion of Khormusd the modern Persian for Ahura Mazda. Thus again we have one man's god another man's devil.

bracket, Axieros with Hephaistos (that is Ptah) ; Axiokersos with Ares ; and Axiokersa with Aphrodite. The Aphrodite mentioned by Pausanias (vol. i, p. 153) as bearing on her head the pole (ttoXo?) may be this same central goddess ; ttoXo? of course
also meant the heavens. (Vol. 3, p. 263, notes.) And Guigniaut and E. Vinet seem to have endorsed his views as regards Hephaistos, Alfred Maury pointing out^ that it was received in Lemnos that Hephaistos as a fire-god was the father of the
Cabires ; Creuzer further calling him the Cabire par excellence. Vinet confirms the identification of Axiokersos with Ares.
And here must be entered a protest against considering Ares for our present purposes as a war-god; that was but a secondary quality of his, a part which he doubled with that of central deity.
For Mars was called stator, just as Jupiter was, and stator (from
sisto) must be taken as fixed, motionless, immovable, like the Pole
of the heavens. The same idea is to be seized in stata mater, as
applied to Vesta, and in Statanus, Statina, and Statulinus, which even came to be explained by the decadents as the tutelary divinities of babies beginning to walk or to " stand aloney." According to the Cretan theogony, too, Ares was a central god, the son of Zeus and Hera- ; and if it be true that Ares is related
to dp'prjv and Mars to mas, maris—the ideas are as old as Plato
and Varro^—Ares would, like Axiokersos, be notably a primitive
exponent of masculinity. The Scythian Ares —whose native
name was Tiv—was the supreme deity first and the god of battles afterwards. As Herodotus attests (iv, 62) his vast square altar-pile
was accessible only on one side, the other three sides being perpendicular ; each tribe had one, and the emblem of the god was an antique sword-blade planted upright in this altar-pile, which was formed of faggots. It would have been of interest had Herodotus said whether the only approach was on the South side. Ammionus Marcellinus (xxxi, 2) says the Alans in his day adored this same naked sword thrust in the ground, taking it as the god
Mars himself.
The central-goddess Medea, M?;Seia, gave the magic sword to her divine son MtjSeto?, Medeus, and with it he slew Perseus.'' To

this sword-blade, which I would identify with the spear or lance or
universe-axis —the Persian Jemshid pierces the Earth with a golden
blade— sacrifices of oxen, of horses, and of one in a hundred of the human war-captives were made. In neighbouring Thrace this god was as dominant as in Scythia, and the Greek traditions brought Ares from Thrace. In Sparta human victims v/ere long immolated in the temple of Ares, and the Spartan youths sacrificed a young dog to him. The dog I have endeavoured in many
places to directly connect with the great central deity, and human sacrifices were made only to the supreme gods. The barbarous Sabines of archaic Italy represented their
Mamers—so Mars was called in the Osk tongue' —by a lance planted in the earth, and they also slaughtered men in his honour.''^ Curis in the same tongue meant lance, and thus, it has long been maintained, came the Juno Curitis or Quiritis, who leant upon a spear, and even Ouirinus.^ The vehement deity of Caria and Lydia, Zeus Labrandeos, who strangely resembles Ares, also held a lance ; and so do the pygmies that we have been seeking to
identify with the Cabires. One clear point about Ares-Mars, which differentiates him from a pure war-god, is his position as patron-deity of the opening year ; and his pairing with Aphrodite- Venus, by which he became the father of Harmonia, makes him clearly the masculine nature-principle begetting the order of the Universe. It seems too
that this god was sometimes identified later with the Sun, both in
its salutary and its hurtful effects,^ which is another acknowledgment of supremacy. The Areopagus, which Suidas said was a high rock on which
the famous tribunal sat of old, simply means hillock or cliff of Ares, "Apeto? 7rdyo<i. Arethusa means no more than devoted to Ares, as
worshipper or as victim —the Latin Marticola or Marticultor. At Plata^a in Bceotia was a temple of Athene Areia.*
Such considerations—and not primarily or chiefly his other
calling of god of battles—explain the great position of Mars as
the national god of Rome ; and seem to throw the true light upon Lucan's " Et Coelum Mars solus habet " {PJiars. i, 661) and " habet ventos, incertaque fulmina Mavors " (x, 206). [See also what is
said of Mars under "The Salii," p. 714.]

And so far as to the supreme position of Ares. Return we now to our Triad of Cabires for the purpose of mentioning a few other
particulars that still survive, before we pass on to the Tzvo Cabires. Creuzer signalises, what Guigniaut calls a precious datum, the mention by the historian Polemon of three stars corresponding to the Three Cabires, as well as two stars for the Dioscures.^ There were three Samothracian Corybantes, and they were also called
Cabires. Riickert^ says there were triads of Cabires or of Diescures at Prasies in Laconia ; in Argos, where they were the three primitive Atrides (also twins and called Dioscures^ ; and at Athens, where they appeared as the Anakes or Anaktes, the sovereigns (from ava^) ; and the Tritopatores of Attica, the three patriarchs or first forefathers, whose identity with the Cabires is confirmed by
the presence of a Dionysos in each.

836 The Night of the Gods. [The
The T2V0 Kabeiroi.
IN considering the Three Cabires we have had a duahty
emanating from a unity ; Axiokersos and Axiokersa, the
male and female principles, issuing from Axieros or Desire, the primate ; or, as O. Miiller demonstrated the myth, Love plus
the two sexes. Movers, following Bottiger, recognised but two original Cabires, and he brought them from Phoenicia to Samothrace.^ Welcker,
too, made the Cabires of Lemnos two great twin divinities who had come from the religion of the Dardanians, that is from the tov/ns of the Troad where the Cabirean worship prevailed. The Phoenicians are also believed to have taken the worship of but
Two Cabires to Cyprus —Thclad and Tholatha, the procreator and the generatrix, also called Axiokersos and Axiokersa, Zeus and Aphrodite (where Zeus takes the place of Ares), Ba'al and
Ashtoreth.2 Here, it will be remarked, we have two apparently distinct kinds of duad ; a twin pair, and a sexual pair ; though the com
bination of the two kinds is quite possible. Epimenides of Crete
represented the Two Cabires as male and female, as the two great Cosmic powers,^ and I have already dwelt on this sexual conception. As to the twin theory, at Berytus we seem to get the clue of it, for there, as Movers showed, the Cabires were the twin issue of one father (which almost gives us a triad), and were connected with day and night. This will suggest to any one the brace Castor and Pollux, Kdarcop and Ilo\vSevKr]<; (two out of four) who came from the two Eggs of which Zeus was the procreator.'* The Cabires of Samothrace were, it would seem, considered to be Kastor and Polydeukes ; the title Oeol /xeyaXoi being accorded to each.^ As to the rising-and-setting astronomical myth of Castor and Pollux, we find it in China, where two brothers named Opeh and
Shichin who were at constant war—which has a Cain and Abel
sound —are made to preside over the Scorpion and Orion, and are
' Creuzer and Guigniaut, ii, 1098, 1075. - Freund und Thiel, s.v. Cyprus. '^ Creuzer and Guigniaut, ii, 304. '' It is important to note that the twins in each Egg were a male and female pair. ' Varro, L.L. x. Ovid, Tri's/. i, 10, 45. Pausanias, viii, 21. Diod, Sic. iv, 49.



Kabeiroi^ The Two Kabeiroi. 837
thus effectually separated, for Scorpio's rise is Orion's setting which accords, as Dupuis pointed out, with Orion's death by the sting of a Scorpion.^ But the other as it were Siamese-twin idea
of inseparable stars is found in the Hindu zodiac—with a reminis
cence of the sexual ingredient— where the sign Mithuna consists of male and female twins.^ In Sir W. Jones's ancient Indian zodiac, and in three others brought from Ceylon by Sir A. Johnston, are a male and a female figure, either standing or seated, joining arms.^ On the Assyrian and Babylonian cylinders they have been found as two little virile figures, superposed, generally head and tail.* This, when combined with the diagram of the Bears on p. 247, very much disposes one to think that the twin idea was originally
carried back to their unborn positions ; and that these Gemini'
were therefore at first actually the twin Bears. In the Greek Sphere Castor and Pollux are a and /3 Gemini, and one myth, made these stars also Amphion and Zethus of Thebes. A so-called Egyptian zodiac gives two men holding hands, and a man leading a woman by the hand. In " the Persian sphere of Aben-Ezra " is likewise found a man holding a virgin by the hand.^ According to Captains Freycinet and Moerenhout the stars Castor and Pollux are known as the Two Friends in Otaheiti and the Carolines." In a Javanese zodiac published
by Sir S. Raffles are found a pair of butterflies ; the P.ersians have a pair of goats ; and Scaliger discovered two peacocks. This interesting subject is taken up again Under the heading of " The
Dioscures " (p. 839). , The Scholiast of Apollonius (i, 917) said Zeus was the first of the Cabires and Dionysos the second ; and Cicero, knew of a Dionysos, son of Cabirus, among the Cabires as well as among the Anakes or Tritopatores.'' Dionysos, again, seems to have
been a third brother of the Corybantes (who were also called Cabires) put to death by the other two.** Here we have again the highest places in the thcarchy given to the Two (or the Three) Cabires from all antiquity. One is even tempted to preserve Guigniaut's suggestion that the Aswins, that very puzzling pair of the Rig Veda, may be the two Cabires also. The same

idea has occurred to Mr. Andrew Lang, who says^ "the Asvnis correspond in Vedic mythology to the Dioscuri, the Castor and Polydeuces of Greece. They, Hke the Dioscuri, are twins." Nor can we leave out of this reckoning the twin Prodromoi or precursors
mentioned by Pausanias.
It is impossible here to avoid touching on Janus, Eanus, or Yanus, whose double-face suggests at once the germination of the idea of duality. The Etruscans made him the heavens, the
revolving gear personified, whence his command of January. He was Initiator, and had the first offerings at the sacrifices to the
great gods. He was the Eternal Father, Patricius ; and the Salii
in their canticles invoked him as deorum Deus (or divom Dios), the god of gods. As Clusius, or turnkey, he was the guardianmonarch of the Universe. If Janus really comes from the root ya, to go, as Professor Skeat teaches, the etymology agrees with
Cicero's explanation " ab eundo,"^ that is, from his going, which I interpret to have had initial reference to the perpetual going of
the heavens and of Time ; for Janus was also Time itself, especially the beginnings and the ends. Not alone was he Time but also Chaos=^; and thus in everything archaic that relates to Janus we have the conception of a central primeval Unity opening out into
duality.
There may be a connection between Janus and Zaz/, Juno and
Atwi/7;. (Dr. J. Taylor's Orig. of the Aryans, p. 316.) There were

The Dioscures.
BUT we must now show how the Dioscures (Aioa-Kovpoi, sons
of Zeus or of Deus) and the Two Cabires were either confounded or are one and the same. That they were the same was in Varro's time^ the popular
behef, to which Varro, however, did not subscribe. Welcker thought they got to be mixed up. The conclusions of Movers {c. 654) make it very likely that they were identical ; and so Creuzer distinctly asserted.^ Those brothers of one clutch, Castor and Pollux, were the two dioscurean brothers, and we have seen the connection of Castor and Pollux with the two Cabires. Ruckert said^ that the Lemnian triad were " Cabires or Dioscures "
;
and he further opined that the two dioscures were the chiefs of the Curetes, and ruled the two hemispheres of the heavens-vault, and that that was why they wore conical casques surmounted by a star. This is bringing us comfortably close to the divine hats of the North and South in Egypt. Like the Cabires and the Tritopatores, the Dioscures, there is no doubt, were revered as dominators of the winds and pro
tectors of ships in tempests."* I. D. Guigniaut, whose opinion was worth having, thought they had annexed this attribute after their confusion with the Cabires.^ Eckhel said*^ the navigation class of ideas attached both to the Dioscures and the Cabires ; and Pellerin" engraved a silver coin of Tripoli showing on one side the head of Apollo (?), and on the other the Two Cabires as Dioscures,
as was clear from the inscription : Secov Ka^etpcov "Evpicov.
The Dioscures were also fire-gods, like the Cabires, and, when they were conjuring the storm, appeared at night on the mastheads in those lucky little flames which foreign sailors call the fire of St. Elmo or of St. Helena or the " comozants."

Hence were they the visible signs of the helpful presence of Castor and Pollux in the long past, and nowadays the reassuring signals
of St. Elmo. The chimney of Ben Nevis observatory is often fringed with an electric halo. The proceedings of the Meteorological Society record a similar flame on the top of the iron cross of a chapel at

storm felt a pricking and tingling on the crown of the head, and their alpen-stocks gave a singing sound. It was a brush-discharge which at night would have been visible in the tongues of fire which, as Omar Saleh wrote to Emin Pasha, have been marked as a
great portent on the spear-points of the Mahdi's dervishes. Thus, by their connection with the primal elements fire and water, do the
Dioscures exhibit their divine duality. Polemon, who recorded the
fact that the three Cabires were represented by three stars, also
gave two stars to the dioscures. Like the Cabires, the Dioscures were robed in the purple ; Cicero^ gives Anaces, the sovereigns,
from ava^, as a surname of the Dioscures. The Amphissenses too, wrote Pausanias (x, 38), celebrate the mysteries of the youths who are called Anactes. Of these gods there are various opinions. For according to some they are the Dioscuri, according to others the Curetes, and a still greater
number think they are the Cabiri. And they were all correct. It is at times not possible to distinguish them from the Corybantes ; they have even been bracketed with the Diotes of the
Spartan coins and with the royal pair of Spartan Heraklides.'*

The Corybantes.
THE Phrygian Corybantes have also been identified as
Cabires, and in fact it would seem as if it was only the diversity of tribes and dialects and localities that brought about this diversity of names for similar conceptions. ^ Movers {c. 654)
showed that the identity was recognised by many ancient writers, and Ruckert^ said the Corybantes were fundamentally the same as the Curetes and the Dactyles. Strabo (x, 473) recorded that, according to the report of some of his ancients, the Corybantes and the Curetes were an outcome of the Idaean Dactyles. Creuzer said=^ that the Salii (who are dealt with in this Treatise under the
head of "Dancing," p. 714) were none other than the Corybantes, for the priests of all of these, of the Corybantes, the Cabires, the Carcines, the Sintians and the rest, were called by the names of
their gods ; which affords another indication that all these titles, which are plural and general, were common and adjectival names, and not proper names. The music and dancing, too, of the Corybantes, the Curetes, and the Dactyles, which Creuzer (ii, 278, 284) pronounced to have adfigured the harmonious march of the hosts
of the heavens, form a point of contact with the Salii. Their raving frantic gestures and screaming music connect them, too, with the Moslem howling dervishes. There is another obvious connection between the Corybantes and the Cabires when Pherecydes puts the former at Samothrace, the most notable seat of the Cabires themselves.
Proclus said the Corybantes were the guardians of the triad Artemis, Persephone, and Athene ; but, as may be seen by what he says of the Curetes (p. 844), he was not a safe guide. The Emperor Julian in his Oration to the Mother of the gods said that Corybas is the Sun.
I must not omit to mention here that Satrapes was a name of
Corybas,* who was the son of Cybcle, whose priests were called
Corybantes. I fancy Korubas is to be connected with /co/509 and

Skeat follows Burnouf in bringing the word from the " Zend " shoithrapaiti, region-chief, which I think must certainly be initially understood as Ruler of the Regions, that is of the Avestan seven Karshvares of the Universe, which ruler was the central pre-solar deity Mithra, "not yet the Sun, as he became in later times," "who moves along all the Karshvares, and brings glory, and brings sovereignty." Another such ruler is given us in another
passage of the Avesta, where sacrifice is made "unto the awful kingly glory, made by Ahura Mazda, that clave unto the bright Yima, the good shepherd, for a long time, which he ruled over the Seven Karshvares."^ The Yima of the Avesta is, ofcourse, a form of the Yama of the Vedas ; a primate among the mengods of the dawn of the Universe. Satrap (or Chatrapa) in Persia —like the titles of the Burmese Kings and the Mahratta chiefs —simply means "lord of the Umbrella."^ If this be the case,
the " Umbrella " in question is clearly, as already urged at p. 221,
the canopy of the heavens. The passage from Pausanias referred to above mentions the
brazen statue of a god in the city of Elis. " One of its feet is
enfolded with the other, and it leans with both its hands on a
spear. . . . They say that this is a statue of Neptune . . .
they call it, however, Satrapes and not Neptune ; and Satrapes is a name of Corybas." There would seem to be here a possible connection between this statue of a forgotten god and the onelegged Ptah given on p. 214, and also with the central spear-god
mentioned earlier in this Inquiry (pp. 143, 371).

The Curetes.
THE Curetes of Crete were said to have been its oldest
inhabitants, which was only another way of saying that the memory and records of man ran not to the contrary of their extreme antiquity ; and the gods and their priests were all Curetes.^
Riickert, who identifies in essentials the Curetes with the Cory
bantes, says that the human Curetes, who were priests and mediators between men and the gods, were terrestrial copies of the divine Curetes, whose chiefs were the Dioscures {q.v.). Strabo
(x, 473) said that the Curetes as well as the Corybantes came of the Idsean Dactyles. Their armed dances, says Creuzer, like those of the Corybantes and the Salii, were meant to show forth the course of the stars, the harmonious march of the hosts of the heavens.^ According to him, the bucklers of the Grecian celebrants
of the mysteries of the Curetes were like the sacred bucklers of the Roman Salii. Dionysius of Halicarnassus'' calls the Salii by the Greek name of Koup?;T6<?, which he draws from Kopo'i or Kovpo<i, a young male, just as I have above derived Ccrj'bas from the male
principle, and just as AL6<;-icovpot has the same origin. But another strange origin has been suggested : the Sabine word airis, which Festus said meant a pike or lance,-* whence the tutelary Mamers (Mars) was called in the Sabine towns Cures or Father Curis or Quiris whence Ouirinus (the real divine name of Romulus), quirites
etc. ; the Sabine natives of Cures being called, although very rarely,
quirites. Numa founded and dwelt-in this Cures of the Sabines,
whence came, said Plutarch again, Quirites.^ For the half-savage Sabine, Mamers was his own very idol, the bare lance planted in the ground. And this is exactly paralleled in the Japanese
god Futsu-nushi, who is dealt with at p. 683. The consort of Mamers was Neriene, and a Juno Curis (Festus) or Curitis, leaning on a lance, was adored at Tibur, where Mars-Ouirinus was also honoured. It may not be impossible that the Sabine curis and the

has descended in modern Greek to the equivalent of the French Monsieur. But in any case, it is valuable for my purposes in this
Inquiry to see the Universe-axis lance made the origin of the
Curetes. The Curetes are celebrated as the twins in the Orphic hymns
(Paus., ix, 25, note). Proclus said the Chaldaeans made Kronos their head ; and he also said they were the guardian triad of another triad, which last was Kronos, Rhea, and Zeus. Elsewhere (on the
Cratylus) he makes this triad Rhea, Zeus, and Persephone. He added that one of the Curetes was Athene. This seems to show that he was in doubt upon the subject, or else that all primeval gods were called Curetes : the term had become archaic and obscure
even in the days of Proclus. Ruckert^ cites the 38th (or 37th) Orphic hymn, in which the two great gods of Samothrace figure with the subordinate band of the Curetes with arms of resounding brass, skimming along the ground with airiest feet, but as they pass shaking the solid earth.
' Trojds Ursprung, s. II.



Kabeiroi] The Dactyles. S45
The Dactyles.
THE Dactyles of the Cretan Mt. Ida connect themselves at
once with the Curetes who cared for Zeus on that holy hill. The Dactyles were also priests of Cybele, as well as divinities, a peculiarity which they shared with the Corybantes, Curetes,
Cabires, Carcines, Sintians, Telchines, and many others. We have already seen that Ruckert^ detected the same radical characteristics in the Dactyles, the Curetes, and the Corybantes. Herakles was one of the Dactyles as well as one of the Cabires. Herakles is one of those that are called the Dactyles of Ida, said Pausanias (ix, 19, 27), and Hesychius said that in Egypt he was surnamed Gigon. One of the explanations is that Gigon means " the dancer"-; in which case, as leader of the dance (of the stars), h would be in his place among the dancing Cabires and Dactyles,
as well as among the Salii who were his priests. Munter has commentated at length the Greek (Gaulish) metrical inscription of the 2nd or 3rd century A.D. which appears to be that of a young
sailor devoted to the Cabires. The four last lines of it run : " But the souls of the dead are divided into two bands, one of which wanders vagabond on the face of the earth ; the other forms choirs [that is dancing troupes] with the stars that shine in the heavens.
It is to this celestial Army that I belong ; for I have the happiness
to have a god for leader."^ Creuzer (ii, 508) is positive about the
dactyles being nothing else than the Curetes, Salii, Corybantes, and
Telchines.
e
Before quitting the Dactyles, it is worth while to mention
the ingenious theory that the prosodic dactyl, _ v^ ^, a long and two shorts, comes from the joints of the finger ; but that scarcely helps us to an explanation of this name of these
divinities. They were said to be the inventors of numbers—of the digits—and that may be thought to contain a somewhat more satisfactory suggestion. If they could be connected with the fingers, a vast range of speculation would be opened up as to the widespread worship of the Hindus and others by finger gestures and twistings (mudras), which are undoubtedly to be also seen practised by many divine figures of the Hindu pantheon ; and as to the indigitamenta of the Romans, the " imposition of hands,"

the white hand of Moses, and the primitive red-hand emblem of
the Phcenicians and the Irish. But this suggestion, which I have not before met with, must be reserved for another occasion. And there is yet a further suggestion which I shall hazard here. We have seen that the sacred dances of the Salii and the Arvalian
brothers were three-stepped (pp. 638, 717). Those of the Dactyles may have been so also ; and we all know that the three steps of " round " dances are a long and two shorts. Besides, all these
fraternities danced to the singing of their own hymns. What more consonant, then, than an accord between the feet of the verse and those of the dancer ? And this immediately lights up and explains the use of irov<i zwA pes both in musical and poetical metre, as well as our own thence-descended "foot." It may be said that this does not account for the measure being called a dactyl, a finger ;
but there was no word for the light fantastic toe in Greek or in
Latin, or for the matter of that, in Hebrew—no more than there is
now in French—except "the finger of the foot," 8dKTv\o^ ttoSo?,
digitus, doigt du pied. Digitus is a mere doublet of dactylus, and
the Dactyles no doubt danced bare-footed, or at all events bare
toed in sandals.
Other " feet," the /Sa/cxeZo?, which was a short and two longs, u
, and the 'vTro/SciK'x^eto';, u, tv/o longs and a short (or vice

Ari'on invented both di/Z/jrambic poetry and its name. The
proper subject of the 8i6vpa/j.(3o<; was the birth of Bacchus ; and it was always given in the Phrygian mode, that is accompanied by flutes.^ The origin of the term is held to be unknown, but surely
it must be allied to the thj/rses of Bacchus, and its first syllable
must refer to what children learning music still call a " one-two time." Ari'on and his Kithara were placed among the stars ascended into heaven, in fact.
A certain kind of fossil was called the dactylus Ideus, and it would seem that the name of Corybantes was also given to these stones. Van Boot in Le Parfaiet loaillier- gave engravings of the stones, and says they were so called from a resemblance to the
finger, and from Mt. Ida in Crete ; but this is far from satisfactory. I am unable to pursue the subject.

Kabeiroi?\ The Telchines. 847
The Telchines.
THE Telchines of Rhodes and the neighbouring country also
seem at times to be the Cabires, and their name is brought from OeX^eiv, in its sense of enchantment.^ The statue they were
the first to put up to Athene was called Telchinia, the sorceress. There is a temple of Athene Telchinia in Teumessus, said Pau
sanias (ix, 19). It may be conjectured, he went on, that she was thus called from the Telchines who formerly dwelt in Cyprus, and a part of whom came among the Boeotians. The Curetes of Crete were also called Telchines, that is magicians, and the Curetes, as we have seen, were " the most ancient inhabitants of Crete." So were the Telchines, of Rhodes, where they had a shocking reputation for maleficent practices. An ancient name of Rhodes was
Telchis, and Crete was also called Telchinia. All this points to the term Telchines being a general one; we have already seen that Creuzer applies it to the Corybantes, Curetes, Dactyles, and Salii ; and the magic is an extra link with the Dactyles, if there be anything in the above suggestion as to the indigitamenta. The
evil sense is accounted for by the traditions of their revolt against
Bacchus, their killing of Apis, and their forging for Kronos the harpe with which he mutilated Ouranos. Now Kronos, as we have often seen in this Inquiry, became a fallen god ; and the evil Telchines must have had a fall too, like the Cabires, who are
nowadays mere devils (qbir, kibir) in Malta.

The Arvalian Brothers.
THE Salii have, for convenience, been already dealt with
under the head of " Dancing" (p. 714), but something must
here be said as to the college of twelve priests called the fratres
^Ervales, between whom and the Salii (and therefore the priests of
the Cabires) there were doubtless points in common. They were
said to have been instituted by Romulus {Gcll., vi, 7), which simply means that none knew when they arose ; and their annual sacrificial ceremonies, the Amb-arvalia, were until the fourth century of our era, held for three days about the 29th of May in a sacred grove some five miles outside Rome in honour of the Etruscan
Lases (Lares) of the farm-fields (arvi or arvae) or of Dea Dia, that is //}£" Goddess /^r ^,tr^//^;z<r^, said to have been Ceres or Demeter,
that is the Universal Mother. At these festivals the priests were
veiled (capite velato) like the Salii, and they danced ; and that their dances were, like those of the Salii, three-stepped seems clear
from the " stage directions " of one of their chanted hymns carmen descindentes, tripodaverunt in verba haec. These words also make it clear that they danced to the singing of the hymn.
After the dancing, a similar rubric says they went in : post tripo
dationem deinde, signo dato publice, introierunt. Marini's labours (ii, 597) showed a likelihood that by ancient usage the Arvalian hymns were included in the general term
Carmina Saliarii, and the sumptuous sacrificial feasts of both the
Salii and the Arvalian brothers are celebrated in Roman classic literature. A most ancient remnant of the Latin tongue comes from the two tables of stone of 218 A.D. found at Rome in 1777, which bear a rubric and a hymn of this fraternity. As given by Marini' the hymn probably ran as follows, each line being repeated
thrice :
1. Enos Lases juvate !
2. Neve luerve [lurt^rve] Marmar sins [s^rs] incurrere in pleoris
[pleores].
3. Satur furere [fu/ere]. Mars limen. Sali sta. Berber.

5. Enos Marmar [Mamor] juvato ! 6. Triumpe !
The following version, by which Creuzer " literally translated this canticle," is almost wholly an obvious delusion
1. Lares, help us ! 2. Marmar (Mamers), permit not a destructive blight to attack
our flowering harvests. 3. Let them give a clean grain, O Mars ! Arrest the fatal sea
blast, great god (Berber) !
4. Invoke alternately all the Semones (deified heroes). 5. Mamor (Mamurius), come to our aid ! 6. Triumph !
(i and 5.) Here Enos is quite left out in the "translation."
One suggestion is that it may be = Aenos, the mountain where was a temple to Zeus Aenesios. Then the Aenesi would not be the mere companions of Aeneus (dicti sunt Aenese comites Festus, p. 17) but the fellow-gods of " Enos." Aenigma, as a sacred mystery or dogma, is then clearer. But we have " Enos Eases " and " Enos Marmar," which may thus give us an identi
fication of Mars with Enos and with the Lares. A better solution
would perhaps be to take the Greek "Eyo? = Annus = year ; in which case lines i and 5 would be " Lares, help on the season. Mars, help on the season " ; reminding of Ovid's " imbres arva
juvantes," showers that do good to the fields.^ (2, 3, and 5.) The identity of Mamers, Mamor, Mamurius, Marmar, and Mars does not seem to be recognised in the trans
lation. (3.) Satur. must be Saturn ; and furere must have reference to
the divine frenzy, theomania, or inspiration. Limen may be the Gate, the hoKava of the Dioscures, the gate of the next world or of heaven (see p, 250). Sali is followed by sta, and Sali ! may perhaps, in this primitive excited chanting (which conveys a strong reminder of the still extant hoarse shouting of Allah ! by the Moslem dervishes) be taken as a command or an incentive to jump, to dance ; while sta ! would be a direction to leave off, to be still. Why Berber is translated " Great god " is not explained. (4.) Semo seems to have been a very ancient agricultural god (Freund and Theil), and Semunis conctos may refer to a plurality
' Ars Ai/ior., i, 647.



850 The Night of the Gods. \_The Kabeiroi.
of such gods ; but the plurality may be only a duality, which is,
strictly, implied by alternei ; alter being one of two.
If the above notes on the several lines carry any weight, then the Lares worshipped by the Arvalian confraternity would (leaving
the puzzling Berber out of account) have been a pair—Saturn and
Mars, or Kronos and Ares— and this would, again, make these
lares another apparition of the dual Kabeiroi (^.'i'.). The victims which were annually led round the farms before being sacrificed for a good crop on the same 29th of May were also called amb-arvales; and these hosticB are nowadays represented
by the sacred images, and even by the host still with bell and incense taken round the cultivated fields and vineyards in many Christian countries. The college of the Arvalian brothers certainly
existed as late as A.D. 325 as the inscriptions prove ; and Smith
{Diet. Ant.) suggests the survival of their perambulations in the rogations or gang- week of the Latin church to which the beating
of boundaries succeeded (he says) at the English reformation.

In Ame, then, there is an all-important River, the Ama no Yasunogawa ; but this, too, as will soon be apparent, is borrowed from the Chinese. It is not hazardous to say that its " broad, peaceful, stony bed "^ is merely local colour copied from the Japanese rivers
themselves. The character of this bed fits it for the ordinary place
of assembly of the gods.- It is also called the River of eight, of many channels, which may have reference to its separations near
the Pole ; for it is well-established that the River is no other than the Milky Way, the Sinico-Japanese word for which is Tenga,

852 The Night of the Gods. [The Heavens
The Chinese Chang K'ien, who lived in the second century B.C.,
said to have discovered the sources of the Hoang Ho or Yellow River, which before his time was believed to flow direct from the verge of heaven, or Mount Kw'en-Lun, and to be a continuation of T'ien Ho, the heaven-river, or Milky Way.^ I think also that the Chinese tradition of the loss of the three last sections of the Yi King which are attributed to Confucius, and their subsequent discovery " by a girl at the Yellow River "^ must be given a mythical signification, bearing in mind the mystic and divinational uses of
the Yi King. It is not only possible but highly probable that the eyots—to risk the term—formed in the Japanese heaven-river by its many channels were the assembly-places of the gods on important occasions,^ somewhat as the Thames afforded, in the forested and insecure past, its Magna-Charta island. It is not out of place to cite the walled temples which the Scandinavians and Slavs
established on river eyots, or on spots artificially surrounded with
water ; a practice which descended to the christian Wasserkirchen, ecclesise in undis, which resemble forts encompassed by a moat, and could only be entered by a bridge. There is a curious legend of a Japanese kami or god (the strong or Holy Wohabari)
blocking-up and turning-back the waters of the River and also blocking-up the road to the rock dwelling of heaven.* However, the duty of the Avestan star or constellation Vanant is to keep the passes and gates of the heaven-Mount, and prevent the Paris
and Daevas from cutting off the road of the Sun: there is a resemblance here which must be recognised. Mena, the first pharaoh-god of Egypt, deflecting the course of the (heavens?)
Nile seems to be the identical myth. And there was a similar stoppage of the River in the Indian myth: "Thou, Indra, hast set open the path of the rivers by
slaying Ahi," says the Rig Veda.^ In another and difficult passage, " Viswamitra arrested the watery stream." Another text (iii, 147) runs : " Indra, thy protecting thunderbolt has slain Vritra
obstructing" (the waters, adds the commentator). Again (157) "thou, Indra, hast slain the slumbering Ahi for" (the release of, adds the commentator) "the water." Once more (425) "thou,

Indra, hast caused the waters detained by Dhuni to flow like rushing rivers." Once again the Agni Vaishwanara slew the stealer (of the waters) and sent them down (upon earth), and clove
the (obstructing) cloud. {Rig Veda i, 158.) Vanant seems to mean the Smiter, and the Japanese Kami's name, Wohabari, is interpreted broad-pointed blade, a sort of
" flaming sword " (on which subject see p. 687). And if this line of interpretation could permissibly be followed up, we should have
the drops from Izanagi's weapon, which in falling on to the stony river-bed formed eight Kami,^ explained as notable stars seen in the Milky Way near a former Pole of remote astronomical time ; and this would lead at once to the plausible and workable hypothesis that the gods, the kami, who assembled as we have seen, were the stars, and that Shinto, the Kami no michi, the Way of the Kami or of the gods, is no other than a lost star-worship. This, for one thing, would explain the distinction of heavenly from earthly Kami, the whys and wherefores of which have long posed Shinto scholars. Not that it is for one moment suggested that the worship was elaborated in Japan ; its name, Shinto, or in full Shintau, is pure Chinese ; and may be of comparatively late adoption. The final syllable of the compound is nothing but the famous Chinese Tao, directly translated into pure Japanese as Michi, Way or path ; and it is well-known that the m.ajority of the Taoist divinities are
stellar gods. Hereupon, my friend Mr. E. M. Satow writes me (13th Dec. 1887) : " The fact of Shinto being a Chinese word does not, I think, prove anything as to the origin of Shint5. I doubt whether it is to be found in any very early composition ; and the
view that it was invented to distinguish the native religion from Buddhism and Confucianism appears to me the right one." Mr. Satow's opinion on this subject is of more weight than any one's ;
SD deeply has he studied the rituals and the revivalism of Shinto.
It is, further, a truly astonishing coincidence that from the drops of blood which fell when Kronos mutilated Ouranos with his KapxapoBov<; cip-m], his pronged spear, were born the Furies, the Giants, and the MeXtac (= jj,e\ia-aai, said Hesychius), the Bees,

By "another account " they w^ere the daughters of Melia, a daughter of Okeanos (see p. 89). It is easy to ask the question : which first gave the
origin of the names in Meli-, the bees or the stars ; and it seems
very difficult to answer it. Meli is honey, and Melissa or Melitta is a bee, and so far it
would seem plain-sailing that honey is the original idea. But then the goddess Melissa was the daughter of Melisseus or Melissos, and the sister of Amaltheia. She fed Zeus with meli, honey [Lactantius i, 22] and was the first bee-mistress [Columella ix, 2] but her father was clearly a prior bee-master. She was not the goddess of bees and honey, a place taken by Mellona or Mellonia. Melissa was also one of the Oceanides, and the Cretan highpriestess of the Great Mother took the title of Melissa. Demeter also brought a swarm of bees (or stars ?) out of the torn body of Melissa. Melobosis was another of the Okeanides, and Meliboia was also a daughter of Okeanos, and was wife to Pelasgos, a " first man " and son of Earth (Demeter and Here were Pelasgians). Melinaia was a title of Aphrodite. Add to this that Meliteos was a son of Zeus, who, when exposed in a forest, was fed by bees ; that melikos (with which compare melodia) meant harmonious,
and melizo, to sing—both ideas being more easily connected with the chorus of the stars than with the sweetness of honey, and it will be seen that the question is far from a solvable one. Superadd that yLieXta is an ashtree,^ and then investigate the two following
words, melitosponde and melithyta. Melitospondc was a sacrifice in which libations of honey were
alone offered ; and Melithyta {Ovetv), were sacred honey-cakes offered to (Zeus) Trophonios, who is also, according to Pausanias, one of the gods plunged alive like Daphne in the Earth ; that is
an earth-traversing Axis-god. With his brother Agamedes (Lead

This looks like a doublet of the Atlas myth. The building by these brothers of the treasury of Hyrieus {vpiev^, the beehive-man or god ; from vpov, bee-hive, and vptov, honeycomb) is merely " another
account "
; for the " treasury," the arcanus, is also clearly the beehive of heaven. The single movable stone which admitted ^the
thief to the treasury in this widely-spread folk-tale may have some
reference to the hole for the axle-tree. The cave of Trophonios, and his engulphment, may also refer to the fall of the god. Before consulting the oracle of Trophonius, said Pausanias (who narrated
his own experience) sacrifices were made to him and all his divine
family— Zeus the king, Kronos, Demeter, Europe (nurse of Trophonios). The oracle-cave was on a hill, in a circle of white stones, above which rose brazen obelisks. The melithyta, or honey-cakes, probably a sticky mass, were held in the hands, no doubt to embarrass the more the already addled consulter of the oracle when he went down into, and was pulled by ropes up out of the cave. Trophonios was also a name for the under- world Hermes
(Cicero). The still famous German mountain Melibocus should not be
forgotten. Ptolemy called it MeXi^oKov 6po<i but this, I fancy,
should be /xeXi/BcoKov, for the is even still pronounced very long indeed in its neighbourhood. We should then have the compound
of Meli- and /3w«:o9 (for /SoO/co?), a herdsman. (Ptol. Celt, ii, 5,28;
C/uv., iii, 5.) Meliboios (Melibosus) was a famous shepherd of old

Byz. 455), and where was a famous temple of " Juno " (read Mylitta, a name of the Babylonian " Venus Urania," that is of Anat ?) The worship of the Assyrian Anat-Mylitta was blended in Persia with that of the Iranian Anahita, the waters-goddess circ. temp. Artaxerxes Longimanus (Darmesteter, Z.A .i, p. Iv.).

town named Melisse. There is also the MeHtta of Mauritania (Tingitana). " The people of Delphi say," wrote Pausanias, x, 5, "that the other temple of Apollo was raised by Bees " (from wax and wings, which is obviously a gloss) " and was sent by Apollo to the Hyperboreans." I think we have here the distant hum of the bees
of the heavens-hive, and a fading echo from its Northern summit. Pausanias (x, '^d>) also says that Myonia, a city of the Locrians,
" is situated in a lofty place and contains a grove and altar of the
gods called Meilichioi." Can this, which simply means honied,
refer to the Bees, the Stars, of the heavens ? " To these divinities they perform nocturnal sacrifices, and they consume the flesh of
the victims in the place where they sacrifice before the sun rises." This seems a parallel case to the Arab sacrifice to the morning
star of a camel eaten hastily before sunrise, mentioned by Prof. W. Robertson Smith in Religion of tJie Semites. Both Zeus and Bacchus were Meilichios. Mr. Lang identifies Chrusaor (Goldensword) with Zeus Meilichios.^ The head_of_Orpheus (the harmony-god who makes the heavens dance-round, and who in dismemberment resembles Osiris) is found near the mouth (source ?) of the heavens-rivet- Meles.

"0/jii]po<i means united ; and the other harmony-god Amphion may, as is elsewhere suggested, mean Dual-Being. Compare, too, the mystic charts of allknowledge which in Chinese myth issue from the heavens-river.] This comparison of the stars to bees may be traced, I think, in the beliefs of the Ersa Finns who were pagans until the middle
of the 1 8th century. The eldest son of their supreme goddess is the heavenly Beehive God, who lives in the sky and rules over the
sun, fire, and light. As bees cluster round their queen, so souls [perhaps spirits or minor deities .''] surround the Beehive God. The second son of the supreme goddess is the earthly, forest,
local, Beehive God who rules the village and the world. The third
son is god of the night, and receives the souls of the dead into his Kingdom of the Dark Beehive. The eldest daughter of the Supreme goddess, again, is the Beehive daughter, who protects

bees and is goddess of Fortune } the wide-spread superstitions,
which connect bees and luck, good or bad, here, perhaps, find their starting point. It is scarcely necessary to point out that the beehive
is the universal heaven. The high priestess at Ephesos in early days, when the great Asia-Minor goddess Derketo was there worshipped, was called " the queen bee," reminding us that Bee (Deborah) was the name of one of the greatest of the " prophetesses " of ancient Israel.^ Deborah gave her oracles under a sacred tree near the El-house (beth-El),
which according to sacred tradition marked the grave of the nurse
of Rach-El. This tree is called an allon in Genesis xxxv, 8, which Stade^ connects also with tl. Here peep through not alone the stars but the heavens-god and goddess, the heavens, and their Axis. The great blue Bee is one of the sacred creatures of Vishnu, or
of Krishna, which in the end comes to the same thing.*
M. Grebaut^ considers the bee \M^ to be the hieroglyph denot
ing domination over the North in general ; and I fancy the word
Kheb ^Jl^^^j with the trifloral determinative, should be
translated North, and not bee/' The Napoleonic bees can be detected as early as Louis XII,
who, in his war against the Genoese, wore a white coat of arms on which was embroidered in gold a hive and its bees.^ Does not the happy description of " a land flowing with milk and honey " seem to take a new significance from all this ?

-A:
The Milky-Way (continued).
ND now a few of the endless records of the heavensRiver myth which remain in the Chinese sphere must be mentioned. Ko-Hung, a philosopher of our fourth century, wrote that the heavens-River divides near the North Pole into two arms which flow thence even to the South Pole, one by the constellation
Nan-tow j^ iSj- Southern Bushel (in our Sagittarius), the other by
the Eastern Well Tung-Pi ^^ (in Gemini). The River is the
water of the heavens flowing through the skies, and dashing under
the earth.^ It is clear from the constellations nameci that the heavens- River is here conceived as flowing both ways from the North Pole downwards. In Ko-Hung's time the Pole was but a trifle farther from the Milky Way than it now is. Other names for it, besides T'ien-ho and T'ien-han heavens-River and heavensstream, are Ho-han river of rivers ; Ts'ing-han Pure-river; Sing
han Stars- stream ; Yin-ho Silver-river ; and Kiang-ho, Red-river. Here, I venture to suggest, we identify the rivers Vanguhi and Rangha which come down from heaven, like two Indian Gangas, to
surround the earth — the one in the East, the other in the West and have puzzled Avestan commentators, who will perhaps some day have to revolutionize their system of cosmical interpretation, which is now being continually revised. The Avestan and Vedic
Apam napat, the navel of the waters, the high, bright, shining, lord
in the highest spot, the divider of the waters among the countries of the material world, then easily becomes the source of those two Rivers, and adds yet another testimony to the umbilicus orbis terrarum.
It will perhaps one day be recognised—for present interpre
tations are not alone lame but inconsistent—that the Avestan
water-stars Tishtrya and Satavacsa were originally polar constel
lations, or the same or successive polestars, each in turn the navel of the waters ; and perhaps we might join with them the Lord of the " dog-star " in Chapter 53 of Sale's Koran; for it does not appear that there is any special reason for connecting the Cais tribe of Arabs, who worshipped the star in question, with a totemic dog. Even if there were, the dogs at the heaven-bridge connect

that animal closely with the Polestar. Dr. Warren's remarks on the subject of the two Iranian stars deserve close attention/ and
it may be added that the other leading Avestan stars, the seven Haptoiringas, which are the Indian seven Rishis of Ursa-Major, and Vanant (as above, § 28) are clearly circumpolar constellations
also. I would here cite a passage in the Shikatid-Ginnanik Vigar
(iv, 29)'' where the five constellations especially pertaining to Ahura are (i) the great one that is supreme and measurable (or very
visible) ; also called the great one of the middle of the sky, i.e., of
the centre of the heavens, in Bundahish (ii, 8 ; v, \). It is clearly, I think, polar. (2) Haptoiring (Ursa Major) created by Mazda. Then come the stars (3) Vanant, (4) Satavaesa, and (5) Tishtrya. Thus the Iranian heaven-fountain of the golden-mantled Ardvisura
Anahita—the four horses of whose chariot are the wind, the rain,
the cloud, the sleet—is the wide -expanding mother of all the waters that spread all over the universe of the seven Karshvares.
Ardvisura's seat is in the star-region, her springs are on the top of the mythical Avestan mountain Hukairya—in Pahlavi " Hugar the lofty," from which the waters leap down the height of a thousand men. She is in the Avesta the large river of a thousand
cells (wells?) and a thousand channels, known afar, as large as all the waters that run along the earth, that runs powerfully from the height Hukairya down to the (atmospheric) sea Vurukasha.^ And the Ganga of the Hindu mount Meru flows towards the four
quarters, that is, all over the world. The centre of the Hindu zodiacs is often occupied by a circle which represents the Earth surrounded by the Seven Seas, and at the ' central point Mount Meru, with the palaces of the great divine triad. And this zodiac is not intended to be conceived-of as on " the flat," for the Brahmans compare it to a dhustura or datura flower which has the form of a pyramid, cone, or extinguisher.*
The following passages from the Rig Veda (Wilson's version)
referring to the heavens-rivers or waters, and their ruler, may here be grouped :

"Apamnapat^ has ascended above the bent" {i.e., above the
arched, above the heavens, to their central summit] . . . the broad and golden rivers spread around, bearing to all quarters his
exceeding glory" (ii, pp. xxiii, 301). "I invoke the heavenly, the
well-winged, the swift-moving, the majestic ; who is the germ of the waters" (ii, 144). " Indra, the seven-rayed, the Showerer, the
powerful, who let loose the seven rivers to flow" (ii, 238). "The aggregated streams come bearing everywhere the water, and conveying it as sustenance for the asylum of all rivers ; the same path is to all the descending currents" (ii, 239). " Agni, the grandson of the waters (Apamnapat)" (ii, 75> "The two-fold born Agni is present at the highest region of waters (apam
sadasthc) " (ii, 85). " The seven great rivers augmented in might
the auspicious pure and radiant Agni, as soon as he was born "
(ii, 320). Then we have again " Agni abiding in the waters " {Rig V., i, 58). "Agni hiding in the hollow of the waters" (i, I77)- "Sovereign of men, Agni, thou art born for the days, pure and all-irradiating,
from the waters, from the stones [by striking], from trees and from
plants " [by friction and burning] (ii, 209, 208). I can discover no key to this mysterious connection, nay, identifi
cation, of fire and water, save in the theory of their simultaneous presence, their common origin, at the Navel of heaven ; combined,
of course, with their primaeval rank as the dual cosmic powers,
heat and moisture. It should now excite no surprise if the fiery stream of the
writer of Daniel, which issued and came forth from before the Ancient of Days (viii, 10) be also identified with the heaven-river,
or Milky Way. Artemis Potamia was, according to Pausanias, regarded at Olympia chiefly as the goddess of rivers, lakes, and floods ; this
makes a central heavens-rivers goddess of her. K. O. Mliller^ calls Hera the Ocean-goddess ; and points out
that in Hesiod Okeanos is the father oi fresh water (Pontos = salt
sea), from whom are all streams and springs.

The Glyph
THE determinative of Egyptian glyphs connected with water
is ^^;:^ which I conceive to refer to the heavens-river. That
is the only explanation, as it seems to me, that can account for its presence at the summit, the sky-line of stelae. M. Pierret's
suggestion (Dia., 194, 134) that in that position the zigzags
represents the "flowing-out," the ccoulement, of time, does not carry conviction with it, although there were water-clocks, and we use the expression " a good deal of water has run under the bridge since then." He is much nearer to the true symbolism in saying that Nu pQQ ; which carries the determinative ^^ , is " the
deification of primordial water," " the immensity of the heavens
waters " Cp. 375). It is in fact the cosmic ocean or okcanos ;
or else water as the first principle of things. It can hardly be also " the abyss." Though the sacred name of the Nile was Hapi
°/vw^ the vulgar name was simply River, aur \\ j^m^^ ,

origin. It is strange that this glyph of water is almost identical with
the ancient Chinese character shui, water, ^ or -^ as given by Prof Gustav SchlegeP and it also resembles the astrological sign for Aquarius, who must have had his origin in the god of the heavens-river or ocean.

Holy Water.
AND all this lays bare for us the origin of the Iranian and
Hindu holiness of water; "river-water is everywhere
throughout India held to be instinct with divinity," says Sir
Monier Williams.^ Among primaeval peoples, who observed the connection between the rains and the springs and watercourses which were
manifestly swelled by them, all waters became of supernal origin,
the gift of the heavens-god ; as rain is, to this moment, on the lips
of everyone in riverless Eastern countries—" the River of God,
which is full of water." And thus the heavens-river, clearly
discerned by the eye of faith in the heavens as the Milky Way
became the generation and sanctifier of all earthly rivers. According to Josephus, the Ganges, Tigris, Euphrates and Nile were but members of the one great ocean-River of the Greeks, which ran about the whole earth ; which Aristotle described as having its origin in the upper heavens, descending in rain upon the earth, feeding, as Hesiod, Homer, and Euripides said, all fountains and rivers, and every sea ; then branching out into the Rivers of the underworld, to be returned fire-purged and sublimated to the
upper heavens, there to recommence its round.^ Says Burnet, in his Sacred Thco?y of the Earth (p. 226) : "Aristotle, I remember, in his Meteors saith there is a River in the air constantly flowing betwixt the heavens and the earth, made by the ascending and descending vapours." The same idea is found in the Rig Veda : " The uniform water passes upwards and downwards in the course
of days.''" This is " the river of the Ocean " of which Pausanias speaks. Herodotus (ii, 23) said he knew no river named Okeanos, and that he believed it w^as either invented by Homer or some poet of former times. Wherein Herodotus was an arch-heretic, having been the first that said so ; Pindar and ^Eschylus, who mentioned
the sources of Ocean from which the sea and every river flows, were orthodox. (See also what is said as to Ogen later on.)

fecund waters in all directions, having been born from the head of her father, the king of mountains, in the form of the boiling spring
of the divine river which falls from the heavens upon the earth.' The Scamander was said to have been born of Zeus, and live
bulls and hard-hoofed horses were sacrificed to it.The ancient Italic river Numicius, which it is impossible not to connect with uumcn, may also be the heaven-river. Janus weds one of its nymphs, Juturna, by whom he has a son, Fontus, the good genius of springs and sources. Juturna is the daughter of
Vulturnus, also a river-god, whose name is derived from one of
the heavenly birds, the vulture. The goddess Anna, surnamed
Perenna, the personification of the fruitful lunar year, is also a nymph of the river Numicius.^ [No direct connection of Anno Perenna with the Hindu Anna
Pourna, the divinity of plenty, has, so far as I can trace, been proved. It remains for the present one of those strange coincidences which recall what is known as " mimicry " in the world of insects and
vegetables ; or the actual identity, as to sound, of many Japanese and Maori words which have no other resemblance whatever.] The very same heaven-river conception is also traced in Mexico,
where Tlaloc, the god of Waters, dwells in the north on the highest
mountains, whence come the rains, and all streams.^ The Mexican cross symbol was chiefly joined to Tlaloc's
worship, as indicating the four quarters to which we have seen the Hindu world-river spreading out. The place of the Peruvian
god Viracocha is closely analogous. A slightly different form of
the Chinese legend is the broad river-torrent which we have already met with on Shodo Shonin's legendary mountain and also the living fountain of immortality on the top of Mount Kwen-lun, whence flow in opposite directions the four great rivers of the world,* which are also typified by the four canals on the under
shell of the world-tortoise f and the expression in the classics, Ssehai, the four seas, is doubtless connected with the same myth, the Indian version of which comes in very aptly here. The heaven

spring Ganga falls upon Mount Meru, and having watered the land of joy at the summit, forms four lakes on the four counterforts of
the holy Mountain, whence it afterwards flows out by four large
rivers through the mouths of four symbolical animals—a correspon
dence with the four great constellations of the Chinese sphere
towards the cardinal points, into four seas.^ In the same way we have in the Japanese Ame what the native commentators unsatis
factorily call " true, or august, pool-wells," which may have been in the partially dry stony bed of the heaven-river. Not only does the
Iranian cosmic current embrace all the waters, its tide is also ever
ebbing, ever flowing in the blood and milk of animals, and in the
sap of the vegetable creation. Here, if anywhere, is the place to
quote Estienne de la Boetie :
Ainsi veoid on en un Ruisseau coulant, Sans fin I'une Eau aprez Faultre roulant ; Et tout de reng, d'un eternel conduict, L'une suyt I'aultre, et I'une I'aultre fuyt,
Par cette cy celle Ik est poulsee, Et cette cy par I'aultre est devancee, Tousiours I'Eau va dans I'Eau, et tousiours est ce Mesme Ruisseau, et tousiours Eau diverse.
This is the River, this the heavens-dome, and this the Sea, which one may clear-see in Coleridge's delighting rhapsody : In Xanadu did Kubia Khan a stately pleasure-Dome decree ; where Alfeph the sacred River ran, through caverns measureless to man, down to a sunless Sea.
The Irish Boyne is called after the goddess Boann, and the Shannon after the goddess Sinann, and both rivers suddenly burst forth from the sacred or the secret well. They are manifestly
heavens-rivers, as may also be seen from the Brugh or heavenspalace being on the Broad-Boyne (p. 228). The gold-coloured Yellow Water, sought for by the Princess Parizad6 in Galland's Arabian Nights, is a reminiscence of the same idea of abundance ; for one single drop of it let fall into a fountain basin, in no matter what quarter of a garden, multiplies
until first it fills the basin, and then rises in the centre in a jet which never ceases to spout upwards and fall back again into the basin, without ever overflowing. The colour affords a close connection with the Chinese Yellow River, which is a continuation of

the Milky Way. To the Healing Water of the Fountain of the Four Lions in the cognate tale of Prince Ahmed and the Peri Banu might be assigned an analogous origin ; the four lions, to whom a sheep is sacrificed, representing the Four celestial Beasts
(see p. 187). The Christian's regeneration in baptism takes place ex aqua et spiritu sancto.^ Bells about to be blessed are washed inside and out with holy-water in which salt is, according to the ritual, mixed. In making the baptismal water holy, the bishop or priest makes
the sign of the cross over it, extends his hand over it and touches the surface of the water with the palm of the hand. He divides the water and sprinkles some of it towards the four quarters,
saying : " I bless thee, creature of water, by the God that made
thee issue from the earthly Paradise in four rivers." He breathes thrice on the water, and then plunges the blessed and lighted paschal beeswax candle thrice into it, plunging it lower and lower each time. " He who knows the Golden Reed standing in the Waters is the mysterious Prajapati " (Lord and Father of All).^
He then pours into the water, in the form of a cross, some of the sanctified oil of the Catechumens. In some churches beeswax from the lighted Paschal candle is made to drop into the water in the form of a cross. In the holy-water for the consecration of a
church are mingled salt, ashes, and wine, which have been
previously blest separately. The holy w^ater at the entrance of
churches replaces the ancient laving water,'^ which still remains
at the entrance of every mosque. The Mountain with its rivers is found persisting in " the earliest

sarcophagus in the Vatican, which will be found figured in Bosio's
B-Ovia soterranea (1632, p. 591). The Lamb stands, says Didron {Icoji. Clurt.), " on the mystical mountain, whence descend the four streams of paradise." This is the Hebrew version of the heavensriver. The second drawing is also from Bosio (p. S'^), and Didron calls it " Jesus standing upon the mountain of paradise, giving His
last instructions to His apostles. Below are six lambs representing
the Apostles : there was not space sufficient for the sculptor to give

Beyond this, there is nothing whatever Christian about it, and we should get
much farther back, and find firmer ground, if wc discerned here a reminiscence of the central supreme heavenly
deity on the supernal mountain, with the seven (and not six) lambs representing the Seven Rishis.
The cylinder of " Sargon the first " (B.C. 3200 ?) figured by Heusey^ {Palais Chaldeeii) and by Babelon,^ shows Izdubar or Gistubar holding to a yak-horned bull a gourd-vase out of which gushes a double stream. This must be the Universe-river, and Gistubar has all the appearance of a classical river-god. This is
Chaldsean, but the Assyrian pillar-statues of the hareem at Khorsabad hold in their hands a similar vase which sends forth a quadruple stream (Babelon, p. Z']\ which takes upon their bodies the course of the priest's vestment known as a stole.

Nebulae and Meteors.
HERE must be mentioned, that it may not be lost sight of,
the very curious and eclectic Chinese view that " the stars
are the upper stratum of the primeval ether, and the essence of the
water of the river, that is, of the Milky Way. The ether emanates and rises, and its splendorous essence floats above, and rolls in a sinuous current which has been named the heaven-River or torrent, and the vaporous stream or pure River. All the stars were produced
by it ; it is therefore also called Sing-han the stars-River " and Tyz«g-han, Pure-river. This is given by Prof Gustav SchlegeP from a work of Yang Hiung, a philosopher who flourished B.C. 53
to A.D. 18 ; and surely it is a startling testimony to the range of the
speculations of the old Chinese astrognostics. Making allowances
for some confusion of thought, and for the difficulties of rendering, is it radically so very wide of the Western modern nebular and star-universe theories of Wright, Kant and Laplace? It may be observed, in passing, that Schopenhauer, who is careful to make Laplace render unto Kant the things that are Kant's in these
speculations, himself renders to Kant what is Wright's (of Durham).^ I might even add to this ancient fragment another in which we almost seem to hear a far-off" echo of Mr. Norman Lockyer's
meteor theory of solar systems. It is a passage from the Phoenician
historian Sanchoniathon as it comes to us in the Greek abridgment of Philo through Eusebius : " The air having illumined itself by the ignition of both Earth and Ocean, there were produced winds, mists, and vast down-pourings of the waters of Heaven dashing upon the earth. For when, because of ardent heat, the All had split up and dispersed from where it was at first, it afterwards came anew to encounter and hurtle in the air ; and thunders and
lightnings were produced by its shocks.^

872 The Night 0/ the Gods. \Thc Heavens
Weaving the Veil.
UNDER the headings of "Buddha's Footprint" and the
" Suastika " a close connection is indicated between archaic Spinning and the Universe-wheel ; that connection may be pushed farther and perhaps driven home in another direction also. The Chih Nu of the Chinese Myths, the celestial Weaving
damsel, strictly consists of three stars to the north-west of the
Milky Way—a, e, and t, Lyrae. Popularly, however, the principal
star takes the lead, and a, or Vega, the pupilla of the Latins, is the heroine. She lives on one side of the River of Heaven, and her young man, the Oxherd, Altair, keeps on the other side of the
stream. Strictly, this constellation too consists of three stars, a,
Altair, ^ and 7 Aquilae. As usually happens in such cases, the course does not run smooth, and it is only on one night in the year that they can meet, and then only by the kindness of a flock of birds which join wings and make tliem a bridge such as it is fabled that our own swallows make for their young. This festive
time is still kept on earth too, at least in China and Japan, with all sorts of high jinks, on the seventh night of the seventh moon (see later under " Number Seven "). The Chinese maids of honour then hold, or ought to hold, a
contest in needle-threading. Seven needles have to be filled by the ' slender half-moonlight with silk of the five elemental colours, and
the nimblest thimbles thus attest their practised skill in embroidery.
Tables are laid in the open air with a dish called the hash "of
united hearts," fruit, and wine " of the bright stars"—a term not
unlike our comet-vintage. Incense is burnt to the herd and his
sweetheart, and wishes are made for riches, or for long life, or for children ; only no one must ask for more than one of the three. They " plant life," too, by sowing peas and wheat in flower-pots. The girl's Japanese name is Tanabata, and the youth is called
Hikoboshi—an alternative term, Kengiu, being the Chinese Kienniu
— and one version of the legend runs that this beautiful solitary
weaving maiden was observed by the Lord of Heaven—who is represented both as her father and her grandfather, and is here
figured to be the Pole Star — for years and years busily occupied,
without any great success, upon a web of the very finest silk gauze.
In pity for her forlorn case he sent her a mortal husband ; but in

his earthly company she forgot her task ; her needle or her shuttle became false to the pole, and the Centre of the Universe, being wroth with her, pronounced the doom that she should only meet her helpmate once a year, and as above. There are no constellations round which more far-eastern
legends gather, and the reasons seem to be that Vega's night culmination at one time marked the Chinese tenth moon, in our November, when the yearly feminine home-tasks began ; for women were up till then engaged in the outdoor field-work like the men. Spinning and weaving then were in full swing, and they so continue still to be, among the rural populations ; the whirring of the
wheels, the clatter of the shuttles, and the chirping of the crickets answering each other, as an old Chinese ode says. In consequence of the precession of the equinoxes, Vega's culmination very gradually changed to the following moon, in which the winter solstice falls, and she, as Chih Nli, consequently took over the
Symbols and significance of Nii, the Virgin (four stars in Aquaris), who is surmised to have occupied that eleventh moon when she, Nil, was so named on account of the marriages which then took, and still take place among the Chinese peasantry ; for, the heavy farm labours of the year being then over, people have a little more time to look about them. At that period of the solar year, too,
occurs the mythical junction of heaven with earth, the union of the yin and the yang, the male and female principles of Chinese cosmical philosophy. Thus Chih Nii succeeded to Nii as the patroness of marriage ; and, as she and Altair (who went through corresponding changes here omitted) culminate nearly together, they became representatives of the yin and yang ; and the lines joining the stars on the Chinese celestial charts adfigure the yoni
and linga ; the lines similarly drawn for Nii form a weaving-frame, or primitive loom. When Vega and Altair were thus opposed on the midnight meridian of the 23rd of December, their bridge of meeting, called Tung-kiao, or the eastern bridge, must have been
invented, and thus the current feast of the seventh moon embraces
the traditionary myths of the tenth and of the eleventh moons also.^ Of course we find the same myth in Korea, told of " Ching Yuh " and " Kyain Oo."^

A loom and a garment bore the same name, hata, in archaic Japanese; and that word gives the second half of the girl's name Tanabata. The legend can be carried far back in the higher Japanese mythology where we find Amaterasu, the daughter of Izanagi, who was appointed sun-goddess, sitting aloft in her inviolable garmenthouse or workroom, overlooking the weaving of the awful garments of the gods ; and her work-maidens bear the same title as the Chih Nil of the Chinese legend. Vega also bears in Chinese star-lore the alternative name of the Queen-mother, while the stars e and ^ are called the Daughters. One of the legends of the i^i^yV/^z" also puts Amaterasu and Susanowo, the Impetuous-male, on opposite sides of the Milky Way^ ; like Tanabata and Hikaboshi. The Weaving damsel is still worshipped in the very ancient but obscure little Japanese seashore Karasu temple, under the names Wakahirume and Orihime ; the latter a straight translation of Chih Nli. One of the Chinese legends on the subject may here find a place. Chang K'ien of the 2nd century B.C. was the first Chinese who ever penetrated to the extreme regions of the West ; whence he was said, in metaphorical style, to have " pierced the void." He was sent by the Emperor to discover the sources of the Yellow River, the Hwang- Ho, and sailed up the stream for many days until he saw a girl spinning, and a youth leading an ox to the water. Asking where he was, the girl gave Chang K'ien her shuttle, telling him to show it on his return to the astrologer, KunP'ing of his own country, who would know from it where he had been. Kun-P'ing accordingly found that, at the moment ChangK'ien received the shuttle, he had observed a wandering star intrude between Chih Nii and K'ien Niu, whence he inferred that
the traveller had actually sailed up the bosom of the Milky Way, of which the Yellow River was firmly believed to be the continua
tion.^ Si-ling shi, the principal consort of Hwang Ti, whom I have elsewhere shown to have been a central primeval heavens-god, first
taught the art of rearing silkworms.^ The occupation of the Peruvian virgins of the Sun was to make tapestries for the Sun's temples, and garments for his children the Priest-king Incas. The supreme goddess of the Ersa Finns,

who were pagans until the middle of the 1 8th century, sits on a silver mountain in the sky, spinning a golden thread.^ And we must not forget the skill of Athene so calamitously challenged by the Lydian Arachne,^ nor the famous Web of Penelope, which can now be scarcely considered as a dawn- myth ab origine. And if we approach the world-wide subject from another quarter, we find in a myth taken by Pherecydes of Syros from Phoenician books a winged oak over which Zeus throws a magni
ficent veil representing the stars, earth, and ocean. This is mani
festly but the Universe likened to an immense tree — axle-tree which the myth-elaborator endowed with wings to operate its rotatory movement. The roots of this immense tree plunge into the abyss, while its spreading branches uphold and display the veil of the firmament.^ I pass by these important wings only directing
special attention to them, for we have met with them in the chapter on the winged sphere, p. T^^J. Nonnos, of Panopolis/ represents Harmony, the mother of all things, irafjiixrjTr^p, weaving in her palace
the cosmic peplos or veil, an idea which he may have taken from
Pherecydes. Nonnos says : Bent over the artful loom of Athene, Harmony wove a peplos with the shuttle. In the stuff which she wove she displayed first earth, with its omphalos in the centre ; around the earth she unrolled the sphere of the Heavens, adorned with the figures of the stars [which may mean the symbolic figures of the constellations]. To the earth she harmoniously added the sea which is associated with it : and she therein depicted the rivers, under their image of bulls, with a man's face furnished with horns. Finally, all along the exterior border of the well-woven garment, she represented in circular form the Ocean, enclosing the universe in its course, Apuleius, who in mythology was of the school of the assimilators,
makes Natura, the parent of things, say {A/ct. xv or xi) that she is likewise the Phrygian primitive Pessinuntica, the mother of the gods ; the Cecropian Minerva {i.e. Athene) of the Athenians ; the Paphian Venus {i.e. Aphrodite or rather Ashtoreth) of the island

Sicilians ; the most aged goddess Ceres {i.e. Demeter) of Eleusis ; as well as Juno, Bellona, Hecate and Rhamnusia, together with
queen Isis of the Ethiops, Arii, and Egyptians. This is interesting for more reasons than one. It exhibits the original sin of the Latin races (still committed by the French, and boggled over by ourselves) who insist upon bestowing their own Latin names upon the foreign gods they with such eagerness assimilated and misunderstood. Pausanias (viii, 5) relates the tradition that Laodice, daughter of Agapenor, sent from Paphos, in Cyprus the divine, a veil to Athene Alea in the Arcadian temple of Tegea, which was a famous sanctuary for criminals. Sixteen women, chosen out of as many cities of Elis, every fifth year wove a veil for the Olympian Here
(v, 16 ; vi, 24).
This veil, too, was the superb and ample peplos with which the statue of Athene at Athens was clothed every five years on the feast called Pan-Athcnaia ; and it is doubtless the veil which, as
Winckelmann pointed out, is a distinctive characteristic of Kronos among the statues of male deities. Eckhel conjectured that it
denoted the occult character of the god of sly, wily, crooked
counsels a^Kv\ofjbr)r'q<;, as he is called by the poets ; but it seems
to me that the Greek term in its origin was simply an epithet for
the arched, curved, bent heavens, and we also find it so us.ed for the Mexican heaven-mountain which is recurved from its summit to its base. In the Capitoline Museum a veiled Kronos or Saturn who lifts the left hand towards the veil, is seated on an archaic throne, and Ge or Rhea offers him a stone swaddled up like an
infant. When Porphyry called the heavens a peplos, as being the
veil of the gods,, he was but using a very ajicient figure. Harmonia, as the daughter of Ares and Aphrodite, of the male and female principles which produce the accord of nature, represents, and has given us the word for, the harmony of the Universe, the rhythmic revolution of the spheres ; and in her famous nuptials her consort Cadmus represents the first man or
God-man, the Adam of the Hebrews,, the Oadmiin of the Phoeni
cians. It should be borne in mind, too, that the Greek Universe was definitively organised by Zeus, with the aid of Harmony. Pausa
nias (ii, I, 7) says that atGabala in Syria, as to which I have earlier
said much (p. 498), there was preserved in the temple of Doto a



River. '\ Weaving the Veil. ^77
sacred peplos, symbolical image of the cosmic veil. This Doto,
says F. Lenormant, is an Aramean synonym —dotho, the Law—of
the Phoenician goddess Thour6—thur6= Hebrew thorah, the Law —who, according to Sanchoniathon, was also called Shusarthis ('husarth, harmony), and who enlightened the mysterious ana allegory-enveloped theology of Taut^ her progenitor. This peplos plays a considerable part in Greco- Phoenician fable. Zeus gave it to Europa as a wedding-garment, and Europa gave it to Harmony when she espoused Cadmos, and so forth. At Gortyne in Crete were celebrated annually the nuptials of Zeus and Europa, that is
of the imported Phoenician Ba'al and Ashtoreth, near to a sacred
plane-tree. On the silver coins of the town Europa is seated among the branches of the tree, and her divine companion is figured by a
bull on the reverse side. On several coins Europa is engaged in
spreading the peplos over her head among the branches.^ The Egyptian goddess of the heavens (Hathor, Nut, Isis) is represented in a tree (the sycomore) which is obviously the Universe-tree of life, and she dispenses the liquor of imqiortality
and the fruits of the tree to her worshippers." It is on the leaves of the Persea-tree that Sesheta, consort of
Thoth and goddess of sacred writings, inscribes the names of those who become immortal. Here the Persea is clearly the Universe
tree of Life.* The Taoist goddess Si Wang Mu (that is, West-Queen-Mother)
bestows on her clients the fruit of the peach-tree (t'ao) of immortality, which ripens, once in three thousand years. This is also said of the k'iung tree, of which she distributes the immortalizing leaves
and blossoms.^
1 " Taut, whom the Egyptians call Thoyth (says Philo's Sanchoniathon a/WEusebius), glorified for his wisdom among the Phoenicians, was the first to ordain in a scientific manner, and in place of the ignorance of the vulgar, the knowledge of divine things and the worship of the gods. After several generations he was followed by the god Surmubelos (Shumru-Ba'al = Ordinance of Ba'al) and the goddess Thouro." I shall just note here, and then leave for future elaboration, the point that the Chinese Tao, which is represented by the Sinico-Japanese To and the Japanese Michi, the Way, also seems to me undoubtedly to bear the interpretation the Law as well. This is bringing into a
strange proximity indeed the Cosmic Veil, the universal Harmony, and the Wheel of the Law. - Orig. dePHist., i. 56S, 573. ' Sir G. Wilkinson's And. Egyf'tus {2nd series), PI. 36A.

878 • The Night of the Gods. [The Heavens
A Christian book of illuminations in the British Museum (King's 5) gives a figure of God, with a triform nimbus, in the midst of a tree, holding the sphere in his hand. Hathor seems also to have been given a black veil in her
infernal or nocturnal character.^ Hathor being but another form of Isis (Isis-Mut-Hathor, where Mut, of course, like the Chinese Mu, means mother), we also find Isis-Neith, another modified
equivalent, usually with the weaver's shuttle either on her head or in her glyphic. Her name was written with a peculiar form of
shuttle \\ ^ . The Greeks viewed her as Athene. Her head
wear is either this shuttle or the hat of the North V ; and Plu
tarch has attributed to her the famous inscription in the temple at Sais : " I am everything that has been, that is, and that will be ;
and no mortal has yet lifted up my veil."^ Proclus says (on the Timceus of Plato) that the veil of the goddess, which was carried in procession in the greater Panathenaia, showed the giants vanquished by the Olympian gods ; and he expounds the veil to be an emblem of the universe which the
goddess weaves. The Egyptian inscription, too, according to
Proclus was "E7&) et/^/ irav to '^e'yovo'i, kol 6v, koI ea-oiievoV koX tov

and no mortal has ever yet been able to withdraw my veil. The fruit I have brought forth is Helios.) The singular parallelism with
the passage I am about to cite from the Rig Veda is remarkable. This wondrous veil appears in the Rig Veda (iii, 395) in a mystic passage which seems to be quite out of its place : " I understand not the warp-threads (tantu) nor the woof-threads (otu), nor that which is woven by the common labour of the assiduous. " What son of man abiding below can declare the words to be
spoken hereafter by the father. " He verily knoweth the threads of the warp and of the woof, He speaks in due season what is to be said, who encompasseth all . , . dwelling both above and below, and contemplating
diversely." " The fttmavidah or Vedantis," remarks Wilson (in discarding their exposition, however) " understand this as alluding to the

River. '\ Weaving the Veil. 879
mysteries of creation ; the combination of the threads being the
Universe." This is clearly the meaning ; and all the rest of
Wilson's long extract from his scholiast is distracted. I must not omit the following further texts of the Rig Veda ; " Day and Night, perpetually reverenced, are, in regard of our good deeds, like two famous female weavers interweaving in concert the extended thread, the web of the sacrifice" (ii, 218) and " Night enwraps the extended (universe) like a woven garment" (ii, 307). And I shall transcribe from Sir Monier Williams's version of the Isa Upanishad the following passage :
" whate'er exists within this Universe is all to be regarded as enveloped by the great Lord, as if wrapped in a vesture."^ To these must be added the mysterious v_eil woven by _M4>^> the sister and spouse, the Sakii, of the Being-of-beings, of the creator Brahma. This veil received and enveloped the dual pair when they were united, and the innumerable forms of the creation represented symbolically on the magic web were thus endowed
with life.2
It is this Veil which is the mantle of " Elijajh^" a word simply I compounded of the two God-names El and Yahveh ; and his disappearance into the heavens in a chariot of fire and a whirlwind, leaving his mantle behind him, are but variants of the invisibility of Brahm and the obviousness of Maya (see p. 831). The veil hung between the Holy and the Holy-of-Holies in the Jerusalem temple, represented the image of the Universe. At p. 807 an endeavour is made to identify the famous Golden Fleece
with the Veil of the starry heavens. f> The star-spangled robe of Lachesis (see p. 616) is another
version of the Veil. It seems clear and subsistent, that, as Mannhardt admits, the Indian Varuna is the Greek Ouranos (Lang's Myth., &c., i, 23). Asura and medha are titles given in the Veda to Varuna, and they are, of course, the terms combined in the Avesta for the supremest god Ahura Mazdao, with all-seeing Eye, the father of Fire, whose
robe is the vast starry veil, which is also the garment of the Indian Varuna. (Dr. J. Taylor's Orig. of the Aryans, p. 320.) This would also, forcedly, bring in the Varana (later the four-cornered Varena-cathru gaosho Varcno) of the Vcndiddd. It seems as if the Veil or Garment of the Universe had variants

in Jack the Giant-Killer's coat of invisibility which he got from a
three-headed Giant ; in the cloak of invisibility of the Three Giants in the German tale of " Heads off!

clothes.
The Phrygian goddess Atlie—to be carefully distinguished from
the Greek Ate—was the great deity of Troy, and the Greeks
identified her with their own Athene. As Professor Sayce points out, 'Athi was the name of the great goddess of Carchemish ; and
from the similarity of the emblems of both, there can be little doubt that here we have also the Egyptian Hathor-Neith. The cow was Athe's sacred animal and symbol, as it was Hathor's ; and the Palladium idol of Athe, which fell from heaven at Troy, held in its left hand a distaff and spindle, which furnish a parallel to the shuttle of Neith.^ Dr. Schljemann quotes the late Mr. James Yates's statement, in Smith's Dictionary of Greek and Roman antiquities, that the distaff and spindle were often hung up by women at the shrines of Pallas, the patroness of spinning and the
arts connected with it, as supporting his (Dr. Schliemann's) view, that the whorls found in such thousands at Hissarlikwere similarly offered to Athe or Athene Ergane, as her Greek title would seem
to be. There is great likelihood in this view, and I do not desire
to be understood as saying anything positive against it. There is however nothing on the whorls, I believe, which can be taken for a
representation of Athe's rude Palladium idol, of which so many have been found at Hissarljk ; and in the major theory I have already suggested on p. 649, my aim has been not, as the careful student will recognise, to set up any contradictory or controversial matter, but rather to develop for these whorls a wider significance, and a symbolism reaching farther back into the dim dumb past. In fact my endeavour, under this head of " Weaving," has been to
connect it back through spinning, as closely and universally as my
information will admit, with the religious symbolism of the revolving
Heavens.

The making of Rhodes with the golden spindle of Lachesis is,
it is suggested at p. 6i6, a figure for the spinning-genesis of the Earth round its Axis ; and Dr. Warren has ingeniously suggested' that Plato's Spindle of Necessity is the same Axis. To trace this Weaving conception from mythology into and down through philosophy would be a task as interminable as Penelope's Web itself, but here and there the thread maybe picked up. In Hindu philosophical speculations the world consists of mere phenomena, the garment or vesture of the deity, the tissue or web of Maya. In Plutarch's well-worn account of the beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, material things are the forms of which the invisible Ammon is the substance ; they are the garment with which he clothes himself and by which he is made manifest to man. Aristotle gave the World a soul, which was not the divinity, but was made by the deity, and was the movable mover outside of an immovable maker. A similar conception was adopted by Philo of Alexandria, the head and front of Judseo-Grecian thought. Among
the neo-Platonists, Plotinus turned Plato's Demiurgus, the world
maker or world-soul, into the third entity of his trinity, and made it movable and the producer of things movable ; he was followed by Porphyry and Iambi icus. Among the Italian revivalists Giordano Bruno reproduced the world-soul as at once interior and exterior, penetrating and vivifying the universe. There is a heroic kind of metaphor used by Saint-Martin, who was at one time much talked of as the Unknown Philosopher among the Illuminated mystics of the close of the eighteenth century, where he uses the web or weaving idea, and says that the history of nations
is a sort of living and moving fabric, through which irrefragable
and eternal justice is filtered without intermission.
From this it is an easy transition to the Earth-Spirit's chant in
Faust

" 'Tis thus at the roaring Loom of Time I ply," interprets Teufelsdrockh, "and weave for God the Garment thou seest Him by." Whatever may have been the original leading symbolism of the whorls, it had been lost for long ages before Gifford wrote, in the early part of this century,
Verse sweetens toil, however rude the sound. All at her work the village maiden sings ; Nor, while she turns the giddy wheel around, Revolves the sad vicissitudes of things.
That wheel is said, we know not with what inaccuracy, not to have been invented before the sixteenth century, but the Jenny that does our spinning now is far, far, more insensible than that village maiden.

ONE of the least satisfactory sections of this Inquiry, so far
as the writer is concerned, is the present, which deals with the Mountain in Cosmic Myth. At times the Mountain seems to be the Atlas Mountain supporting the heavens ; at others it is clearly the hollow heavens-vault itself, and we are inside, not outside, of it. Then these two conceptions get mixed, or else clouded and befogged, owing to a total or partial loss of the original myth. Then again there is the natural superiority and
effect of the mountains of reality upon the human intellect and sentiments ; and all these ingredients enter into the worship on, and
reverence for, and legends about, particular mountains ; so that the task of disentanglement is hopeless. I have done the best I could, after several rewritings ; and can only ask the willing reader to keep his attention roused, and in the detective frame, throughout.

WE must now try back a little, and take up the Pillar-Axis
idea again, but under the form of a mythical Mountain. Pausanias (v. xi, i8) made the being Atlas support both earth and heaven. Flammarion^ has reproduced from the Margarita
Philosophica an illustration in which the feet of Atlas rest on the lower, while his head touches the upper pole of the heavens. Herodotus (iv, 184) calls the round and slender mount Atlas the
Pillar of heaven, whose summit is out of sight. Pierre Saliat's
version is here transcribed for its fine old quaintness :
Encore plus outre, a dix journ^es de Ik, est une roche avec son ruisseau, habite aux environs, et joignant est une montagne nominee Atlas, ronde et menue mais haute a perte de vue, en sorte qu'il n'est possible d'en voir le cime, a cause qu'hiver et ete elle est couverte d'un brouillard. Ceux du pays disent que c'est le pilier du Ciel ; lesquels, ayant pris nom d'elle, sont nonimes Atlantes, Et dit-on qu'ils ne mangent jamais chose qui re9oive mort, et ne songent jamais.
Indra is Atlas also. " Indra, who has upheld earth and heaven and the firmament." Rig Veda, iii, 49. An important element in the Atlas myth, which helps to identify him with the Axis, is that 11 (Kronos) by the counsel of Taijt (Hermes) buried his brother Atlas (whose Phoenician name has not
been discovered) in the bowels of the Earth {eU ^ado<=; jr]<; efi^aXcov Kar6'x,Q)ae. Sanchon.). Hesiod makes Atlas, Pro-metheus, Epimetheus and Menoetius all sons of lapetos. Calypso (KaXv-ylro)) was a daughter of Atlas. The Samoan god Ti-iti-i pushed up the heavens and his feet made holes six feet deep in the rocks as he pushed.- Here we have the shoes of IphiKratos (p. 341) and those of Magnes (p. 142). Ru is another Polynesian Atlas.'^

this Shu into the rising Sun is difficult enough, but that has not
daunted the sun-worshippers (see Pierret's Diet., p. 511).
Anhur, J] J] was thought to be another form of Shu, but
he appears to be an adjunct god. While Shu upholds, Anhur (= heavens-upholder) holds a cord, and seems, said De Rouge, to take the measure of some space/ M. Pierret thinks he " symbolises one of the cosmogonic forces," and De Rouge adds that it is " very
probable that it is in fact celestial force that is characterised in
Anhur-Shu." (At the same time they make both of these littleknown gods " solar.") It seems to me that if Shu be indubitably an Atlas, that is an Axis-good, and if the fire-producing apparatus (p. 654) be borne in mind, Anhur would seem to be the power which twirls the axis-stick in the navel, or the wheel on the
axis with the rope, which he holds, in order to produce fire. He is
thus the bringer-round of the heavens, and the rope is that which
is seen in other myths at pp. 296, 603. This seems very simple,
and to hold well together. Shu and Tefnut made a duad ; and Anhur, Shu and Tefnut a triad. Now the lion-headed goddess Tefnut seems to be a parallel to Sekhet and an infernal fire-goddess, so that this also
bears out my suggested explanations. This interpretation seems to be also upheld by the words Shu,
Shuti [S%1I1 or P^n , the dual-feather which, like the two Mat
(p. 492) must refer to the two poles.
A parallel to Shu and Anhur may be detected in Trophonios and Agamedes (p. 855).
[Curtius brings the Greek word Atlas from the root tal to bear,
to sustain ; and thinks the initial a to be merel)' phonetic. It is
odd that the Goths mistook the name of Etel or Ethele the great King of the Huns for Attilas, which in their own tongue meant " little-father," and also the animal bear. In Norse the he-bear was Atli (little-old man) and the she-bear Alia (little-old-woman).
Thor was called Atli. Etel is said really to mean liberal, generous.

the supreme heavenly significance of bees, and the offering of honey to the supreme heaven-deities, and also elsewhere the supreme importance of Great Bear worship. It would be strange
indeed if all these points were all connected, and all dim glimmerings from the same long-vanished Northern Light of the
jDast.]
[It is a very strange fact that axel generally means shoulder in our early writers. Thus in Morris's Old English Homilies (circa
1 175) p. 245, we find, "he hit berth on his eaxlum," he bears it on
his shoulders; and in Madden's Layavwns Brut (circa 1200),
" on his exle" (i, 96). In Icelandic oxl is the shoulder-joint, and
oxull an axis. A similar identity exists in Swedish, Danish, German and Old High German ; and I believe in Gaelic. Professor Skeat, from whom these references are taken, is satisfied
with the old explanation that the shoulder-joint is the axis on which the arm turns, and I do not wish to press any other
(Dr. Murray offers none)—merely repeating that is a curiosity cf the subject that Atlas, who is here sought to be identified with the axel (our earlier word for axis), should in the myth bear the world
on his axels.]
There is, too, the Atlas of the Mishna, the angel Sandalfon, \^'ho, according to Rabbi Eliezer, standeth on earth, and reacheth with his head to the door of heaven. His place is behind the chariot,
that is to say north of Ursa Major (see § 13). Indra is often called the sustainer, the supporter of the world in the Rig Veda (ii, 29, 261). The Finnish Ukko upbears the firmament. The Subban Ijr, whose mother is the Living-Spirit, bears the seven worlds
on his back or on his head. His pedestal is of hard iron, or he is
the pedestal itself of the earth.The Egyptians conceived the earth, says Brugsch, as rising
towards the North, so that in its Northernmost point it reached the sky.'^ The ascent to the Norse Himinbiorg was by Mountains that

Meru.
THE Hindu mountain, Meru, the residence of the gods at the
pole, is a column which unites the earth and sky, the axis of
the world, the highest terrestrial spot, and the central point of the
visible heaven. It is of fabulous height, goes through the earth,
and protrudes on either side. There are two polestars, one at each end. North and South ; at the upper end are Indra, the gods, and the great rishis ; at the lower the demons have their abode.^ J. D. Paterson, in the Asiatic Researches had, so far back as 1808, already placed Meru at the North Pole, and Franc^ois Lenormant agreed with Renan that it reappears in the Greek myth of Meropis.''^ In Japanese Buddhism Meru occurs as Shumi or
Someiro—both equivalents of Su Meru—and is the centre of the Universe ; but this, of course, has travelled from India. The identity of Meru with the Parsi Mount Alborj has been pointed out by Meiners and Creuzer ; and, as Lenormant showed, the Zoroastrian Hara Berezaiti, Haraiti Barez or Bareza, is, like Meru, the pole and centre of the World, round which, in the Avesta, the stars, Moon, and Sun revolve, and upon which rests the abode of the gods. Up that bright mountain leads the path of the
blessed to heaven.
It will lead to greater clearness to give here an abstract of some of the statements as to Mount Meru, which are to be found in the Puranas. The earth is flat and bounded by a circular chain of mountains ; in the centre is an immense convexity, Mount Meru, the pillar or axis of the world which sustains and unites the
heavens, the earth, and the hells ; that is to say the three worlds. Meru is sometimes loosely called the North Pole. The four flanks of this holy mountain face the four cardinal points and are
of four different colours ; red on the N., yellow on the S., white on the E., and brown or black on the W. Four rivers spring from a single source under the foot of Vishnu at the Polar star (see p. "^^^-j), and traversing that heaven-sphere in which the moon moves, divide on the summit of Meru and thence issuing from the jaws of a cow, an elephant, a lion, and a horse, seek the four chief

regions of the world, in which grow four trees of hfe of four different species, all called by the generic name of kalpavriksha. The Buddhists admit but one tree of life, the jambu, from whose roots
the four rivers issue ; and the four animals also appear as the
ox or cow, the camel, the stag, and the horse. Besides the four divisions (which afterwards double into eight) there is a more general (and perhaps the primitive) division into Seven dwipas or worlds, which are grouped round Meru, forming seven concentric zones with' seven corresponding "climates."
Between these are seven seas or currents which isolate them ; that
of jambudwipa, or the earth, being a salt sea. Another variant is that a sea (of milk) turns seven times round Meru before giving
origin to the four rivers ; which seems to betray a later endeavour
to graft the four theory on to the seven. That the seven theory is the more ancient seems to be clear from the seven swargas of
heaven and the seven patalas of hell. The summit of Meru is a celestial Earth, swargabhumi, a circular plateau surrounded by hills
where, from sphere to sphere, and step to step, a celestial counter
part of the terrestrial worlds is reproduced.^ The seven gods or
chiefs of the seven celestial spheres are priests, solitaries, prophets, sacred chanters, in fact pure Brahmans ; and the seven patalas of hell have also, of course, their seven governors who are placed under Yama, the lord of night of the dead, of the hells, of the South. The seven celestial governors seem to multiply, or to be
reduplicated, either as rishis, septarshis (seven rishis), maharshis
(great rishis), menus or munis. The last seem clearly to be the (later) governors of the " seven planets " ; there is no doubt that the saptarshis are the seven of Ursa Major, and we are also told that the seven Menus inhabit the seven stars of the Chariot
(sacata), which seems clearly to identify them with the saptarshi.s.^ On the summit of Meru, at the North Pole, lives Indra with his female dual principle Indrani f and on the same golden mountain, as Kailasa, is the god Siva ; for Su-Meru, Maha-Meru, Kailasa, Kalaya, and Suralaya are all to be taken as one and the same heavenly peak ; and all these names can be applied equally well to the Himalaya, which to the geographer becomes a mere terrestrial mountain chain. In order to complete the survey of the Meru myths, we must now pass as slightly as may be over their phallic developments in

Sivaism. On the golden summit of Kailasa, then, where Siva dwells, is a platform whereon is a square table set with nine precious stones and in its centre the lotus or padma, bearing in its
calix the triangle, the origin and source of all things. From this
triangle issues the linga, symbol of the eternal god who has made the triangle his eternal dwelling. Again, when the (2 x 7 =) fourteen worlds were formed, with the Axis which traverses them, and Mount Kalaya underneath, then there appeared on the summit of this mountain, the triangle yoni and in the yoni the linga or
Siva-Linga. This linga or tree of life had three barks, the exterior bark being Brahma, the next Vishnu, and the inner Siva. When these three gods had become self-detached there remained nothing in the triangle but the naked stem, thenceforth under the guard of Siva. There, on the Himavat, another alias of the sacrosanct mountain, appeared then for the first time the ancient phallus of Siva which the god, according to another legend, divided into twelve lingas radiating light which fixed the gaze of gods and men. Then he transplanted them into the various parts of India where the gods and genii who guard the eight regions of the world paid them the pious homage with which they continue to this day to be adored.^ Of course we know, as Sir Monier Williams writes, that the most numerous of all temples to be now seen in India are those which enshrine the symbol of the linga and yoni combined. That conjunction emblematises the world-wide deification of the male and female principles in creation, the Chinese yin and yang : and under that form is Siva adored as the eternal reproductive
power in nature ; perpetually restoring and reproducing itself after dissolution, as the one great god, Maha-deva, and supreme lord,
isvara.^ This serves to show — as I have more than once had to
hint at elsewhere—that the Universe-axis and tree of life conceptions will be found conjoined with a phallic interpretation
almost universally. It is in such legends that we may find the exposition of the
flaying of Mapo-ua?, the satyr, the flute-player, who defied Apcllo.
Bargains were clenched at his statue in Rome, which shows him to have been a terminal, an Axis, god (see p. 388). Marsyas ought thus to be another alias of the Protean Mars (see p. 714). Reclus states the number of mountains called Olympus roughly

him —that Olympus was the upper Ouranos, the upper hemisphere
of the wide heavens, the heights of heaven ; that the celestial dome was, in fact, conceived as a heavenly mountain. Then we had the Assyrian Olympus, Aralu, in the extreme North,^ whose summit was the abode of the gods, while its base touched the place of the dead. The souls of the Siabba dead have to climb a great mountain to get to Olmi-Danhiiro, World of Light, their heaven.* The steep mountain up which the souls of the dead Blackfeet
Indians had to scramble, might also be mentioned.

Mo2intainP\ The Dual Moimtain. 891
The Dual Mountain.
T^HERE is a mount Kagu in the Japanese Ame—sky, or
heavens—from the forests on which the gods obtain stags'
shoulder-blades and rods for divination.^ The mountain and the heavens are either or both gourd-shaped, hisakata. There is another mount Kagu on earth. In archaic Japanese Kaga or Kage means light^ (it also means reflection and shadow), and thus Kagu should mean shining, which is just the applicable term for the heavens
vault mountain Kagu (see also p. 682). The fire-god's name Hi no Kaga-hiko is properly explained shining-prince of Fire.^ The earthly Mount Kagu is in the provinceofYamato, the ancient name
of Japan, still used by the Lu-Chu islanders, the centre Mountain
land of the stories of the Koj'iki, and " the land's, or world's, acme," kuni no ho, in the Koj'iki poems,* has doubtless a similar import. It is possible that this approachment completes the clue to the etymology of the word Yamato,^ which has been food for puzzlement, whether as mountain-gate, mountain-place, within-the mountains, or without-the-mountains : it seems really to be Yamatokoro, region of the mountains. The wondrous peak of Kuzhifuru (Wonder-Old ?) on which Ninigi descended from heaven,*^ is thus too
no longer difficult.
The first Japanese god of mountains was Great-Mountain, OhoYama, born of Izanagi and Izanami.' There were then produced the Metal-mountain Prince and Princess Kanayama no Hiko and Hime. Then after an interval there were born from the cut-off head of the Fire-god the Tree-Mountain god, Ma-saka Yama (the Ma^ saka being the True Saka (Cleyera) tree of heaven). Next

was an Odo Yama (the sense of Odo being unknown), an Oku (secret) "S'ama, a Kura (Dark) Yama (perhaps the mountain which is the lower hemisphere?), a shigi (Luxuriant) Mountain. Then Ha (Extreme ? or Feather ?) Yama, Hara (Plain) Yama (a reference doubtless to the plain, the expanse of the heavens) and To (gate ?
or Utter ?) Yama.^ All these seem to be alternative mythical
names for the heavens-vault mountain. In West's PaJilavi Texts (i, 22, 36) we also find a pair of Mountains, Taera, the centre of the universe, and Kakad-i-Daitik, the centre of the earth. The Avestan mountains Hukairya and Hera Barezaiti seem to have a similar correspondence. But there is a closer parallel to the two Japanese mounts Kagu"^ in the Chinese Kwenluns. The central, heavenly, Kwenlun holds Shang-Ti's
supernal palace, and the other his earthly paradise and his wife.'^
There is little doubt that in this division of the Mountain into two we have the same duality of thought and development which we saw on p. 235 as to the Pillar. Shang-Ti's wife gives an actual
point of contact between the two. A passage in the Choiv Ritual states that the Tai-p6 -^ j' , or
chief-diviner controlled the divining rules contained in three books, the Licn-sJian, the Kzvci-Tsaiig zvi^ the Kwei-cJiang. The first of these books was called Lien-shan j^ ^] , United-Mountains ; and this title was said to have come from its first mystical and divining
sixfold sign Kan —- ^ , which is made by putting the three-fold
sign — — which stands for "mountain," over itself;* that is, mountain on mountain, a sort of Pelion upon Ossa. This, which has always been a great puzzle, seems to be very
possibly a cryptic reference to the heavenly sacred central mountain being above the earthly one, as there has so often been occasion
to point out in this Inquiry. This Kan is now the 52nd hexagram in the extremely ancient Yi King, which, by the general consensus of all schools of Chinese and of all sinologues, is the most ancient monument of Chinese
shot of the Secrets of the Nihongi, which is approved by later native commentators, is that saka means " pass " of a mountain. (Mr. Chamberlain's Kojiki, p. t^t,.) But that saka's
character is [J^ in Hepburn's Dictionary, which also gives ;j^i^ for the saka tree. We
seem to be driven to the Japanese itself, unaided or unpuzzlcd by the Chinese characters ; and so I suggest the version of the tree which brings the heavens-mountain and universe-tree together. ' Kojiki, i, 7, 8. '^ V. pp. 126, 127, 129. ^ Chinese Recorder, iv, 95. ^ Wylics, Notes, 2.

literature ; and the book called theZz'M Sha7i must have been more
remotely ancient still. The view I here suggest about the pair of mountains seems to be supported by the title CJiozv Yi of another of these three divining-books ; where chow is usually held to mean the Chow dynasty alone. But M. P. L. F. Philastre points out in his version
of the Yi King^ that chow here meant " circular movement, revolution embracing the whole universe ; and it was also the name of the fief of which the feudatory ruler founded the Chow dynasty. This " revolution " I would suggest is that of the heavens round its axis, inclusive of that of the zodiac ; and Chozv Yi would thus mean the Revolving Changes. One might even be induced to theorise that this
was the true origin and real significance of the name of the Chow dynasty of the Sons-of-heaven. This interpretation, as regards the Chow Yi (and therefore as
regards the Choiv Li also) seems extremely well to fit the fact that the diagrams of the " changes " in this Changes-Book the Yi-Kijtg
are attributed to the rhumbs of the compass and also, radically, designate the yin and yang, the male and female principles into which the primeval central power divided, together with all their
combinations in different proportions. Furthermore, the titles of two out of these three divining-books,
Li'cn-Shan and Kzvei-Tsaug, are also names of Yen Ti and Hwang Ti, the immediate imperial successors of Tai Hao or Fuh-hi Shi,
the very first mythic ruler- ; that is, of course, the primeval power. The name of Tai Hao, the " Great Celestial " w^as also said to have been Feng, " wind " -; that is, as I should suggest, the Ether. With
him the mystic diagrams, the Yi, the Changes, commence ; and they were revealed to him by a supernatural dragon-horse which issued from the Yellow River, which is the Milky Way. From these diagrams, and from the movements of the heavenly bodies, he deciphered the system of written characters, invented the horary and cyclical notation, and regulated the seasons. He is therefore clearly a primeval heavenly central deity. The diagrams of Tai Hao were but eight, answering to the four cardinal and four half
cardinal points of the Universe. It was Yen Ti his successor who increased them to 64. Yen Ti, Fire Ruler, is obviously the Firegod, and he lived on the mountain Lieh or Lien ; whence one of his

If now the Chozv Yi, or Revolving Changes, could be connected with Tai Hao, we should have the triad of three books assigned to the triad of the three first mythic rulers of the Universe ; two of whom clearly " invented " the mystic diagrams of which those books
treat.

Holy Mountains Generally.
NO wonder then that Mountains generally are holy. The
Chinese have long considered mountains as formed of more subtle substances than the plain earth, ^ and modern investigations of the comparative density of the earth will scarcely gainsay them. Schopenhauer, whose insight is often as just as it is profound, says, in his detached remarks on the Beautiful in Nature, that the sight of a mountain-chain when suddenly come upon, throws us insensibly into a serious and even into a sublime frame of mind. This may be because m.ountains alone seem to brave the decay which soon sweeps away all else including our own ephemeral
selves. Not that all this offers itself distinctly in our consciousness
at the view of mountains, but that a vague feeling of it is at the bottom of our mental mood.- There is a story told of Wordsworth. Mr. Rawnsley asked an old servant of the poet's : " Did he ever tell you which mountain he was fondest of? " " He wasn't a man as would give a judgment again' ony mountain," was the reply ; 'I've heard great folks as came to The Mount say: 'Now, Mr. Wudsworth, we want to see t' finest mountain in t' country ' ; and he would say : ' Every mountain is finest.' "^ " Mountain scenery has always a saddening effect upon me," wrote the Scottish James Macdonell, Journalist (1890, p. 264) at Grasmere in 1872, aged 30. The following extract gives Eckermann's feelings* : " I remarked to Goethe that in me, born in the plains, the gloomy sublimity of Swiss mountain-masses produced an uncomfortable feeling ; and I by no means desired to explore such wild recesses." Mountains are nearer the heavens. Per the Cappadocians, said Maximus of Tyre\ a mountain is at the same time a god, a form of oath, and an idol. The Rig Veda speaks of" Him who is vast and self-sustained like a mountain, the radiant and formidable Indra." {Rig V. iii, 160.)

his conversations with Zoroaster took place.^ The first Avestan man and King was called Gar-shah, mountainkino- ; his son was Syamak, and one of the Avestan holy mountains

the mountains,^ and the Assyrian texts which have been deciphered afford many invocations addressed to a great variety
of mountains.
The first ruler of Korea (Chinese, Chosen ; Korean, Achim
Kohun) was Tan Kun, Oaktree-lord, who descended from Te Pek
San the o-reat white mountain, which we must presume to be
the same as Pek Tu San, the ever-white mountain, whence the
population came. The supernatural land consists of three lofty peaks Te Pek, Ha La, and Kun Gan, precious stone.^ The first person of the Taoist trinity dwells in the city on Pearl mountain, Kwen-lun* ; and the Excursus of Gesenius on the
" Gotterberg im Norden " demonstrated that Isaiah's Har Moed, tlie mount of the congregation in the North, belongs to the same cate"-ory.^ The Shu-King shows the Emperor Yao calling upon " the chief of the four mountains " (see p. 888) ; the Ainu of Yeso
call a volcano a god." Tacitus said that the Mons Coelius at Rome, one of the famous
Seven, where the church of St. John Lateran now is, was also called Mons Querquetulanus. The reasons given for these names by Tacitus are idle" ; one was doubtless the heavenly mountain,
the other the oak-bearing, that is the mountain that bore the
sacred tree. Elsewhere he remarks — I cannot lay hands on the reference—that mountains being the neighbours of the heavens, it was thought that the gods were there more within hearing of
mortals. Mount Taurus was called the Cardo'^ (see p. 432) that is the
axis or pole of the Earth.

Saturn, too, was then sacrificed-to with bared head, counter to the ritual for all other sacrifices: a custom which I think we must connect with that of the roofless Greek temples elsewhere mentioned (p. 492), as being a supreme testimony to the open-air heavens-god above all.

house between Manyangaand Stanley Pool (p. 154). Inside there was a circular mound of worked clay with patterns traced in the
clay by means of coloured beads and pebbles. On opposite sides of the mound stood two figures, unmistakably male and female, about
four feet high—and on stakes passing up through the roof were spitted outside some (European) plates and dishes, the stakes passing through holes made in their centres. Here we have clearly vestiges of the mythical mountain, of dual primeval deities,
and, in all probability, of the Universe-wheel and axis. In the sixth century Agathias (i, 18) reproached the Germans who were subjects of the Franks for adoring mountains, rivers and trees ; and in the seventh, St. Eloy, bishop of Noyon, and Pope St. Gregory made the same reproach to the French.^ A complete catalogue of holy mountains would certainly include many more than are to be found in the gazetteers. Ida (Asia Minor), Dindymos, Berecyntus and Cybelus itself were
sacred to Cybele (Ku/SeTi?/) the mother of the gods. Mount Kronos near Athens ; Mount Rhea near Lampsacus ; Atlas, Anazarbus, Gaurus, Libanus, Paneion, Rhodope, Niobe's Sipylus' Taurus, Athos. Where the hospice of the Great St. Bernard now stands, the Mont-Jou of Roman days, was a temple to Jupiter
Penninus, to whom an inscription (Jovi Poenino) was discovered by de Saussure," and whose worship on that spot seems to have
survived into our eleventh century. Mont Jou and Mont Joie are the names of many mountains and hillocks, natural and man-made. In an old MS. poem cited by Ducange {Mons Gaudii) and called Lusidaire, the way of making a Mont Joie is described :
Tant i ot [il y avait] pierres apportees C'une montjoie y fut fondee.
Montjoie-Saint-Denis was the name of a castle built on a hillock in the forest of Marly ; and it seems that we must interpret the name, as well as the French Kings' war-cry, as referring to the
Jou-hillock of St. Denis, a muddling up of the pagan god and the Christian saint to be met with in endless other instances.

laire Frangais-Provengal (1848) — Provengal, dijoous ; Bayonnais diyaous. Anyone who carefully considers " the best known, as well as
the best preserved, of the Bengal Buddhist topes," which is figured from a photograph in Fergusson's Indian Architecture (1876), p. 66 or the Sanchi or Manikyala examples (pp. 6% 81) must I think be disposed to agree that the artificial reproduction of the sacred mountain idea was the object in view in piling up these stupas.
In the Egyptian funereal MSS. several references to the heavens-mountains may be gleaned. In one (Louvre V. 12. 3148) there is mention of Son of God " prospering in the mountain."^
On the ostracon of Merer-hap (VI. 3. 6134) Hathor is called " Lady of the funereal mountain": and on another funereal MS.
(V. 20. 3157) the defunct is made to say " I am like the silver (nub het : white) which goes forth on the mountain of the East." This may refer to the stars which rise in the East, but Deveria said
it was the rising Sun. All heavenly bodies (appear to) rise in the
East. Anpu (Anubis) H ^ J has the title " chief of his
mountain," which is said to be " the funereal mountain of the West, the Lib}'an chain " though that does not look as if it were quite irrefragably settled.^ His obvious mountain ought to be the lower hemisphere of the sky ; and it may turn out that the whole structure which has been set up about the West in the Egyptian
inferno rests solely upon the single basis of the entrance to Amenti being in the West, where every heavenly object "goes under." This conception seems to dominate the following, for instance, from an Abydos stela (cast in Louvre) : " Turn [here apparently an alias of the Sun] couched in the mountain of life gives light to the dwellers in the lower hemisphere." Here again the mountain of life is said to be " the West,"^ but this seems to me to be a mere halting in limine. Again the goddess Merseker (silence-lover) is cryptically said to "animate, under the form of a cow, the mountain of the West in which the sun couches."* If the mountain be the lower hemisphere, then it is E. N. and S. just as much as W., and

the only apparent extra significance of W. would seem to be, as before stated, its being the quarter of the entrance. Mersker (said to be an alias of Hathor) is, however, a serpent^
hatted with the sphere and two feathers iji of Hathor, and she is
called "regent of the west," "front of the western sky." In that case she might be only a porch-goddess of the infernal regions, but then again there is an instance of their being called ta Mersker, land of Mersker, or of silence, simply. Amenti means hidden-part. " It is the west," says M. Pierret.- But the west is not hidden. " In the evening," says the Peremhru {Book of the Dead, xvj, " the sun turns his face towards Amenti." Even this does not reduce Amenti to the Western region. Surely it cannot be seriously meant that the Western Amenti is above our horizon. Amenti is

Therefore neither East nor West was of primary impoitance in fixing the points.

Add to this that Nut iTTi " safeguards thee in the funereal Moun

902 The Night of the Gods. {The
Mountain-Climbing.
GAUTAMA BUDDHA'S ascent of Dantalokagiri/ has
made pilgrimages up lofty mountains a symbol of the renunciation of worldly joys and comforts for hardship and privation. Huc^ mentions a most rugged and toilsome mountain near Lha Ssa which the Thibetans and Mongols ascend with great unction, for whoever reaches the summit attains ipso facto remission of all his sins. Such pilgrimages are highly meritorious nowadays among Japanese devotees. The Buddhist legend of the saint Shodo Shonin is obviously a medley of all the old mountain-myths,
and is therefore here abridged.^ After three years spent in prayer and meditation, he had a dream of a great mountain to the North. On awaking, he endeavoured
to make his way there, but deep snow—for it was midwinter seemed to oppose insurmountable difficulties. Vowing to sacrifice his life rather than abandon the enterprise, he persevered, and at
last reached a point from which he saw the object of his search. Ascending to the top of this Mountain, Kobu ga hara, he gave
himself up to austere self-discipline, but lived on delicious fruits
brought by a supernatural being. But from its summit he, after the lapse of many years, perceived among the mountains farther to the North four miraculous clouds
of diiTerent colours rising straight up into the sky (see p. 907), and he at once set off to reach them. He found his advance barred by a broad river which poured its torrents over huge rocks, and looked
utterly impassable. The saint fell upon his knees and prayed, when there appeared on the opposite bank a divine being of colossal size, with a string of skulls hung round his neck, and dressed in blue and black robes, who shouted to the saint that he would help him to pass the stream as he had once helped the Chinese pilgrim Hiouen Tsang [as Julien called him, the more correct pronunciation appearing to be Yuen Chang] across the river of flowing sand. With these words he flung across a pair of green and blue snakes, which he held in his right hand, and in an instant a long bridge

Mo2mtain.~\ Mountain-Climbing. 903
was seen to span the waters like a rainbow floating among the hills but when the saint crossed it and reached the Northern bank, the god and the snake-bridge suddenly vanished. The Vedic commentator Sayana said that Turviti, and Vayya, mentioned in more than one of the Saktas, coming to a broad river, which they were unable to cross, prayed to Indra, and were conveyed over by him/ and this flowing sand is found in the legends of Kw'en-Lun, where the Weak-water, Jo Shuei, which cannot
float even a feather, issues from a hollow rock, and flows into the Moving Sands.- Having thus attained the object of his
desires, Shodo Shonin built himself a hut, and practised religious
exercises. One night a man appeared to him in a vision, and told him that the hill which rose on the Nqrth was called the mount of the four gods, and was inhabited by the azure Dragon, the vermilion Bird, the white Tiger, and the sombre Warrior, who occupied the peaks at the cardinal points. [These are the four great constellations into which
the Chinese celestial sphere has been from all time divided. See also p. 907.] He consequently climbed the hill, and found he had arrived at the goal of all his journeys, for there were the four clouds rising up around him. He proceeded accordingly to build a shrine which he called the monastery of the four dragons. In the year "j^y of our era, he resolved to ascend the highest peak of the group, and after duly preparing himself by religious
exercises, set out upon this new enterprise ; but he came to a
great lake on the flank of the mountain, and in spite of his prayers found it impossible to proceed any farther, on account of
the deep snow, and the terrific thunder that pealed about the
mountain-top. But after fourteen years' incessant prayers and
penances For men may rise on stepping-stones Of their dead selves to liigher things
he renewed the attempt, and, after one more failure, at last reached
the summit, accompanied by some of his disciples. It seemed to him a region such as gods and other supernatural beings would
properly choose for their residence, and he therefoi-e erected a
Buddhist temple.'

The legend clearly takes this pilgrim to the North pole of myth,
where alone he could get to the centre of the four cardinal heavenly constellations which there lay out round about him. These four peaks too are typically found on the under-shcll of the Chinese world-tortoise. The Four Kaf or cardinal mountains that bound the Universe appear in the Persian tale of King Bahram Ghur and the fairy Husn Banu, where the lords of these Kaf give the King the famous cap, staff, and slipper of Solomon. In the Aladana Kdma-rdja Kadai, the magic bag, cup, cudgel, and sandals are given by the Old Sannyasi or Brahman Sage to his four disciples. There still survives in China an ancient custom of ascending hills to drink chrysanthemum-wine on the ninth day of the ninth month. This is called ting-kaou, scaling the heights ; and there is a constellation called T'ien-Kaou, celestial heights or observatories,
consisting of four stars in our Taurus. Prof Rhys's inquiries in the Isle of Man show that middle-aged people now living remember that when they were children their parents used to ascend the mountains very early on the first Sunday in August (O. S.)^ They call the first day of August Lhuanys, which may throw light on the corrupted " Lammas." The Chinese king, whom we have already seen baulked in his attempt to swarm up the slippery world-column, finally succeeded, with the help of some heavenly beings, in getting to Paradise by a rugged mountain-path. And the Alpine Club at all events would agree that the bent for mountain hermitages which the monks of Monte Cassino perpetuate
Bernardus valles, montes Benedictus amabat
is not quite so insane as the perching of the Stylitas of our fifth
century, who have claimed notice in the Pillar sections of this Inquiry.
And thus, too, the evil sense of the title Old Man of the Mountain will, for any one who has followed the arguments here advanced, be a climb down from a very high station indeed ; and not alone that, but we may be here casting some glimmer of light upon the mysterious reverence ^or friendship which the Templars showed him.

Mouiifaiii.'] ParSI DakJnuas. 905
Pars! Dakhmas.
THE Pars! hill-built dakhmas are an outcome of the original
Avestan command or usage of exposing dead bodies on the summits of mountains,' and that usage may have arisen in the belief that, as the path to heaven was up a mountain, they were thus putting the dead well on their way to paradise. Hue- says that in the desert, among the true nomadic Tartar
tribes, the funeral ceremony consists in conveying the dead to the tops of hills, or the bottoms of ravines, there to be devoured by the
birds and beasts of prey. He describes, too, the four methods of disposing of the dead in Thibet ; cremation, immersion in rivers
and lakes, exposure on mountain-tops, and—the most frequent and
most excellent—cutting up the corpse into pieces and feeding dogs
with it.^ In every Lamasery of Thibet a number of dogs is kept for this purpose ; and within them the wealthy Thibetan is buried ; the poor going to the common vagabond dogs, terrible multitudes of whom prowl, gaunt and famishing, about the streets of Lha-Ssa." This was known to Strabo, who wrote that in the capital of Bactria, (whence Zoroastrianism is thought to hail) they bred dogs called buriers, who ate-up all who fell into decay from old age or sickness. Hence were there no tombs visible in the suburbs, while the town itself was full of human bones. Cicero^ said : In Hyrcania ^\ehs pub/icos alit canes ; optimates doviesticos. Nobile autem genus canum illud scimus esse ; sed pro sua quisque facultate parat, a quibus lanietur : eamque optimam
illi-esse censent sepulturapi. Justin also said of the Parthians : sepultura vulgo aut avium aut canum laniatus est ; nuda demum ossa terra obruunt. Here, without the remotest: connection wi^h Parsiism, we have instances of the central sacredness of the dog and of the mountain. The Parsis keep one or more dogs in every dakhma to look at the corpse, and there can be little doubt that in the three-headed Greek Kerbcros we have an infernal (and once supernal) triad.

9o6 The Night of the Gods. [The
The Pahari tribes in the district of Garwal near Massuri in the Himalayas, wherever wood is too costly for cremation, still expose
their dead on hill-tops.^ Primitive Christian burial-places were
barren hills to the north of a place of habitation.^ In Peru, if the victim of human sacrifice remained resolute, constant, and even
savage during his torments, they—so soon as they had eaten
the flesh and inwards — dried the tendons and bones in the sun, and placing them on mountain-tops, held him for a god, and worshipped and sacrificed to him.^ The earthly Chinese Kwenlun (see p. 892), is marked on some maps as Kul-kun, and the marvellous still surrounds it. The men of the place have long hair and the bodies of dogs ; the women are human, but all male children are born dogs ; they go naked, and their speech is like barking ; they live in caves, and eat raw. Have we here a glimmering of the ancient Parsis and their dog-reverence, or of totemism and some dog-tribe? In any
case, it seems to be the same nation of which Ctesias wrote in the fourth century before our era.* This legend had in our 13th century percolated to the Tartars, and was brought back by the Minorite friar Joannes de Piano Carpini, the envoy of Innocent IV in 1246. He says the women of a certain country (quanda terre) had human forms, but the males were like unto dogs f and again " next unto the Samogetae are those people which are said to have dogs' faces, inhabiting upon the desert shores of the North Ocean." He has even a thiid version, in which these monsters of the Northern Ocean sea in all things resembled the shape of men, saving that their feet were like the feet of an ox, and they had indeed men's heads, but dogs' faces. They spake as it were two words like men, but at the third they
barked like dogs. [See further as to the Dogs at the Parsi Chinvadh Bridge

Mountain?^ The Mai-velions Mountain. 907
The Marvellous Mountain.
HTHE Mountain. We have now to enter on another division of the Mountain portion of the subject, in which the fabulous mountain is represented as being marvellously adorned and beautiful, and on that subject, and indeed as regards the mountain in mythology generally, the reader must be referred to Dr. Warren's remarkable book Paradise Foicnd} Here the connection with the marvellous Island myths, to be mentioned later, will appear in strong relief. The heavenly Meru, or Su Meru, is ruby-coloured on the East, golden on the West, lotus-hued on the South, and coral on the North ; it is a collection of manifold jewels, or a mountain of gold.- Here we may have an Auroraborealis myth, or an allusion to the four cardinal constellations
already met with (p. 903). These constellations too, in the forms of the Warrior, Dragon, Tiger, and Bird which typify them, adorned the four martial banners of Chinese armies ; and the banner of "the Pointer of the Northern Bushel," Ursa Major, was reared aloft in the centre, to excite the holy ardour of the troops, who thus appealed to the guidance of heaven. On the summit of Mount Meru, according to the Puranas, is the vast city and garden of Brahma ; and, according to the Rig Veda and its commentators, the paradise of Indra, and also the supreme station (paramam
padam) of Vishnu.'' In the Hindu zodiacs, as expounded by Sir William Jones, the third and central circle often represents the earth surrounded by the seven seas, and in the interior Mount Meru with the palaces of the three great gods who form the eternal unity which is at the culminating point of the whole sphere. Thus the Brahmans compare the zodiac to a dhustura or datura flower, which is shaped like a cone, an extinguisher, or a pyramid.-* Siva once came down to earth by a pillar of fire, says an Indian legend when he went back, as an everlasting symbol of his presence and

his protection of his worshippers, he turned this pillar into the vast world-mountain Meru, which towers heavenward invisible save to the eye of faith, far above the highest Himalayan summit. It is surmounted by three cones, on the greatest of which are three golden peaks, whereon repose the sacred triad. ^ The Trikakut or triple-humped peak of Himalaya is mentioned in the Black Yajur Veda.- The Chalda^o-Assyrian view was that the celestial and terrestrial paradise were united by the paradisaic mountain itself^ In the 68th Psalm, says M. J. Halevy,^ there are three separate mountains, Sinai ; Hermon, the Mount of Basan, at its Northern boundary ; and the Mount of Elohim (Sion ?). There are divine chariots, and the ascent and triumph of the divinity. One wellknown phrase he renders " Exalt him who rides on the Empyrean." The Ainu obviously still hear echoes from the world-mountain in their Poiya-umbe (Brave Man) legend, as reported by the Rev. Mr. Batchelor.^ " Here there was a very tall mountain, whose top extended even into the skies ; upon its summit was a beautiful
house, and above this circled a great house(.'*) of fog." The magic tent in Gallaud's Arabian Nights tale of Prince Ahmed and the Peri Banu seems to me also to represent the heavens-palace. The tent which was capable of sheltering many
armies, expanded illimitably, and may be a fairy-tale metaphor of
the celestial vault.
The gorgeous richness of Meru finds us prepared to learn that Kuvera, the Hindu god of wealth and hidden treasures, of
caverns and grottos, and of their sprites, also has his station in the North among the mountains which yield gold and precious stones.*^ Prithivi, the earth-goddess who sometimes replaces Kuvera as deity
of riches, is also assigned to the North. The holy little district of holy Puri in Orissa, which is called the Swarga-dwara or heaven-gate, is also symbolically the Blue Mountain ;^ and we find manifestly the same idea preserved among the Subbas or Sabaeans in their high northern mountain of turquoise (jade?), the reflection of which, when the sun shines on it, makes the sky blue.^ The 42nd Psalm, recited before the Mass, seems certainly to have

light of heaven, the truth of the central position (see p. 498) the holy Mountain and the heavens Tent. On the eve of the consecra
tion of a church, a tent is pitched near.^ The spear of Izanagi, which has here been elected as the type of one form of the world axis myth, was of some precious material of coral say some authorities ; of red jade say others, or of " a jewel," vaguely.^ Perhaps " precious stone " would be the safest rendering. The materials for the sacrosanct mirror and jewels for the Japanese sun-goddess's " christmas-tree " are taken from Ame no Kana-yama, the metal-Mountain of heaven.^ The Avestan mount Hukairya, the height of deep precipices, is the all
shining, the golden. (The Greek Pasiphae = All-shine, see p. ^66) On the Iranian Mount Hara Berezaiti is the garden of Ahura, as on Meru is that of Brahma.* The Assyrian Aralu is a mountain of gold. The stupendous terraced pyramid- temple of Cholula was a symbol of the sacred paradise-mountain of Aztec tradition,
which stood in the centre of the middle-country.^ Kw'en Lun is famous in fable and especially in Taoist my
thology. There the four great rivers, blue, white, red, and black,
early took their rise ; it is 10,000 // round and its walls are piled high
in nine-fold steps, rising to 11,000 //, 114 paces, two feet and six inches. It has twelve jewelled towers, all built of jadestones of the five colours. On the West there are the pearl-tree, the jadetree, the Suan-gem tree, and the tree of immortality ; on the East there are the sha-t'ang and the lang-kan ; on the South the kiangtree, and on the North the pi and the yao trees, which denote different forms of chrysopras or jade ; and doubtless all these trees are otherwise but one, the World-tree, the great K'iung tree of
jadestone, which is the tree of life. The Chinese recognise Kw'en
Lun's identity with Su-mi, their form of Su Meru. There are also

garden, in which the Buddha was bom, will not be out of place here Within it lay a lake as large as a sea, with rock-work of diamonds, crystal, and lapsis-lazuli. The paths were of Jambugold, which falls in dew from the Jambu-tree on mount Shumi, the Japanese corruption of Su Meru. Cranes standing at the water's
edge, and tortoises sunning their tails on the rocks, happily suggest the crowning blessing of long life ; and rare trees and strange plants grow round about ; the Painless-tree, Asoka, bearing countless gorgeous blossoms which exhale delightful odours. The peacock fans its burnished plumes, and the kariyobinga-bird (Sanskrit, kalavikka), with human face, utters its melodious note. [The ordinary form of the human soul in Egyptian funeral papyri is a bird with a human head. In the midst of the garden rises a magnificent palace of precious woods, adorned with the rarest gems. North of the city of Lha-Ssa, says the Abbe Hue, at the distance of about a mile, there rises a rugged conical hill, of but
slight elevation, which amid the plain resembles an islet rising from a lake. It is called Buddha-La, Buddha's, or the divine mountain, and on it the adorers of the Taleh-Lama have raised
the magnificent palace in which their living divinity resides in the
flesh.i

THERE is an ingenious speculation in M. Pierret's Diction

being arched in mimicry of the heavens-goddes Nut ^i^, who is
considered to bend protectively over the dead ; but the imitation,
if such there be, is more probably to be traced to the vaulted
heavens itself. The hieroglyphic determinant which applies to the heavens, evidences a similar conception and intention ^ ^

Isis was placed in the star Sothis (said to be Sirius). And on one of the coffins of Sotimes, the coffined prays : " O my mother,
heaven, that spreads thyself above me, grant that I may become like unto the constellations."
Pausanias, in giving (x, 5) the legends of the third temple of Apollo at Delphi, wrote that it is said to have been built of brass by Hephaistos, and that, as Pindar versified it, "suspended from its roof, there golden virgins sang." This is clearly a heavensmyth, as was also that of the second temple (which preceded the
third), and was raised by the Bees {J..e. the stars). The same idea is to be traced in the brazen bowl, also made by Hephaistos, shown at Patarae in the temple of Apollo. The chest or coffer made by Hephaistos, and taken by Eurupulos from Troy to Patrai belongs to the same class, as well as the necklace (Milky Way .'') made by the same fire-god and bestowed by Harmonia, which was in the temple of Adonai's and Aphrodite at Amathos in Cyprus
(Pans, ix, 41). Another account makes the coffer of Eurupulos hold a statue of Dionusus, made by Hephaistos, and presented by Zeus to Dardanes. It was adored at Patrai, or Patras (that is the Fatherland, the Earth)
as ai(TVfjivt]T7j'i, the Ruler or Dispenser of fate, the Just Governor, completes the allegory. The statue is the supreme heaven-god and the coffer, the heavens. Can Dardanos be a spear, a dart, dard, dardus, Axis-god ? The following Delphic legend (Paus. ix, 16) also clearly belongs to the same vast category. " Of all the offerings which the Lydian kings sent to Apollo, nothing at present remains but the iron base of the bowl of Haluattes. This was made by Glaukos (Blue) the Chian. The form of the base for the most part resembles that of a Tower, and rises from an acute bottom to a broad top." [This is
obscure, but] " Each of its sides is covered throughout, but is begirt with transverse zones of iron like the steps in a ladder. Straight
and ductile lamina of iron are bent in their extremities outwards,
and this was the seat of the bowl."
^ [The Sdht( was the spiritual body, which germinated from the corruptible body after the proper prayers had been recited and the prescribed ceremonies duly performed. E. A. W. B.]



Mountaiu?\ The Mountain as the Heavens-Vault. 913
The Mexican lofty arched mountain of the gods, Teo-Culhua
can {teoll, god ; coloa, to bend), that is the heavens, is also called
seven-caved, chicomoztoc {cliicomc, seven ; ostott, cave) because of the
caves where dwell the seven tribes, for the lord of the Chicomoztoc
paradise had seven sons. This lord is no other than the supreme
deity, Huitzilopochtli (left-humming bird), who also has four marvellous ministers.^ The mountain is called Calhuacan, that is, the bent peak, says Duran," because the summit is bent down towards the bottom (porque tiene la punta algo retuerta hacia abaxo) ; an explanation which at once recalls the familiar Egyptian figures of the heavens-goddess Nut bending down over
the earth. (See also p. 549 ante). But it would seem that the bending down must also include (perhaps indeed its most pregnant meaning even is) the under inverted hemisphere, the Egyptian
inverted precinct " (p. 664). However, the idol Cenn Cruaich after it was struck by St. Patrick (p. 272), was also called Cromm Cruaich, the Bent-one of the Mound f which leads one to imagine that this latter was an original name, and that St. Patrick was, later, forcibly haled into
the legend. This Mexican mountain is situated in a great lagoon, and here we may recognise the Indian and Iranian figurative universe-ocean. The whole of the happy and favoured country where this mountain is situated is known as Aztlan, that is to say, as it is rendered by Duran, Whiteness ; but as we are concerned with the heavens, either
by night or by day, Brightness is clearly the correct signification,
as I have elsewhere suggested (p. 804), also in the similar case of the White Wall, that is the Bright Firmament, of Memphis. The supreme gods Ouetzalcoatl (serpent-bird), and Tezcatiipoca (shining
mirror) also in their wanderings arrive with their followers at an impassable mountain which they go through, and not over. Here again we clearly have the heavens of the gods. Montezuma's legendary embassy to Tezcatiipoca went up the side of the mountain, and found that at starting they became mere youths ; half-way up they looked forty years of age ; and very soon afterwards became old men. The allegory here, though subtle, is
unmistakeable ; the ebbing of the life of man leading to death and

happiness in the celestial skies ; and it furnishes a pleasant variant to the North American Indian's mountain, up which the dead have to scramble. The extreme difficulty of the ascent of TeoCulhuacan receives local colour in the Mexican myths, for its upper portion is formed of sand so fine, so dense, so dry, so quick, that
no mortal man that lives by bread can tread it. First, the scaler
sinks to the knee, then to the waist, and finally is engulphed. Here we clearly have another version of the slippery pillar of the Chinese king. And the Mexican heaven-caves can be well-illustrated from
the Taoist legend of the Ts'ing ch'eng ^ j^ which they call the
fifth cave-heaven J^ -^l^ ^ a general place of assemblage for gods and genii. It has eight large caverns, corresponding with the
eight half-seasons, and seventy-two smaller, answering to the five
day periods of the year of 360 days which was in force in the Chow dynasty when the historical period commences {circ. B.C. 8oo).i
The Western Mongols call the polestar, the cardo of heavens ; the apex of the golden mountain, that is, of course, of the heavens
vault : apex montis aurei, nomine cardo cceli, stella polaris.^ I can here do no less than recall attention to the other instances of the heavens-vault mountain already given, and for the rest
request the reader—it can never be recommended too often —to consult the index. Such are Olympus as the heavenly vault (p. 890); the gourd-shaped Japanese Mount Kagu (p. 891); the many coloured Meru (p. 907) ; the magic tent of Prince Ahmed (p. 90S). On the subject of the Mountains generally, too, the reader cannot do better than turn to Dr. Warren's Paradise Found, which
will furnish many references besides those here given.

The Enchanted Island.
IT is scarce worth while to digress for the purpose, but the
marvellous Mountain might be connected with the enchanted Island myths through one fact which still remains to us. Oceanic islands are called sJian} mountains, by the Chinese, and some of them are enchanted. Such are the Eastern-ocean, sacred,
floating. Islands, the three fortunate Islands, P'eng-Lai, FangChang, and Ying-Chow, which can be traced back to at least the third century B.C. They are all inhabited by genii of lustrous form who live upon the gems of their shores, and drink the swiftinebriating sweet-wine jade-fountain of eternal life, which springs in Ying-Chow from a rock of jadestone" a thousand chang high ; the chang (but it is of little moment) being ten Chinese feet.'^ Peng-lai has been corrupted into the Sinica-Japanese Horai of
folk-lore and literature —of the Genji and Taketori Anecdotes, for example. Horai has never been beheld by mortal eye, and in search of it was prince Kuramochi sent in the tale of the Bamboo Splitter, in order that he might bring back a branch of its jewelled Tree to the fairy princess. There the Sennin or mountain-fairies,
who are otherwise the Vedic rishis, dwell in immortal youth and happiness. Miniature models of the mountain are appropriate presents to the newly married, and pictures of it hang in Buddhist temples.*
This is perhaps a link—a frail one it may be— between the heaven, the paradise-mountain, and the island-paradise which, appears in so many Western forms ; the chief of which, of course,,
is the lost Atlantis, the tale of which, according to Plato, came from Egypt. This is far from being a " safe " subject, and has been a good deal scouted ; but there can be no harm in remarking that its name at all events connects it with Atlas, which has already been treated (p. 884) ; and the fact of Poseidon's preparing it for his son need mean no more than that it rises out of the sea— out of the four seas, which we have met with round the mountain.

good century ago, placed it in the Palaio-Arctic ocean. Nothing is farther from the intention of the present writer than the encouragement of paradox ; Darwin's observations on Oceanic
Islands and Wallace's Island Life have scientifically demolished
any such theory as that the origin of all civilisation was this very Atlantis in the character of an old-fashioned continent now welldrowned in the midst of the Atlantic ; but it might be just giving the coup-de-grace to the Atlantis paradoxes, if it could once be well connected with the mythical world-Mountain. And could we in the same way dispose of the Western Eden and the transatlantic Elysium, it might prove another great relief to many very worthy folk. Not that we could, however, by any manner of means afford to part with the Voyages of Mailduinn from the county Clare to those islands where the ants were as big as hens, and were man
eaters to boot —a sort of forecast of Mr. Rider Haggard's screaming crabs ; where v;ere horses with the paws of dogs, and giants o'horseback who ran races on the crests of the waves ; where they found the Jumping Cat ; where all the black-sheep were whitewashed, and all the good sheep went wrong. Mailduinn discovered Rabelais's Isle Sonnante before Rabelais was thought of, and another island too, where the birds were the
souls of the Irish dead —a very ancient and wide-spread myth which we have met with (p. 910). The connection between the Magic Island and the mythical Mountain will appear m.ore striking upon a perusal of the two next
sections; but I must not omit to state here that the harvest-feasts in
honour of Kronos on the twelfth day after the summer solstice in Samos, at Athens, and in the rest of Attica, also commemorated the Golden Age of perpetual abundance and universal equality ;^ and it was under the dominion of Kronos that the Titans and other heroes led an existence of delights, when, the struggle over, Zeus, the son of Kronos, pardoned them, delivered them from their subterranean prison and their chains, and appointed them a life separate from that of mortals, but far from the immortals also, at the extremities of the earth. There do the demi-god heroes
inhabit, free from all care, the Western Isles of the Blest on the Ocean of deep Whirlpools; fortunate heroes, for whom a fecund soil
yields twin harvests of honied fruits.^ I must add here, too, that Titan, which is generally explained as meaning Spn-god, is more

archaically Fire-god, from the root tit/i, fire. This refers the Titans, as well as Kronos, to the central Cosmic fire of the Nave of
the Universe-wheel. But K. O. Muller, resuming the passages in the Iliad {v'm, 478
481 ; xiv, 203, 274, 278 ; xv, 225), wrote' that, far beneath where Earth and Ocean have their utmost bounds, where nor light nor breathing of fresh air may wend, surrounded by the deeps of
Tartaros, sit the Titanic or Infernal gods, lapetos, and Kronos.

Le Pays de Cocagne.
THE Marvellous Mountain and the Enchanted Island naturally
lead up to the Land of Cockaigne, a grotesque subject that has ceased to amuse. In Strabo's account of Mount Atlas, the Olive-trees are of
extraordinary excellence, and there are seven refreshing varieties of wine ; the grape-bunches are a cubit long, and the vine-stems so thick that it takes two men to clasp one. This is like the Talmud's land of Judah when the Jewish Messiah comes, and each grape will be an ass-load, wheat-straw will be as high as the datepalms, every grain of corn will be as big as a beef-kidney, and the flour will be shaken out of it ready-ground, as out of a bag, by a
helpful wind ; cakes too, and ready-made clothes—a touch of
second nature—will also be among the crops, and old tooth-snags will grow white again with drinking the abundance of milk.-^ After this, the new earth of the Norse millennium, where the fields merely yield a harvest without a sowing, is but poverty-stricken. In one of Mailduinn's Islands he suddenly came upon an uninhabited palace where the tables groaned under all kinds of good cheer, although a single apple was meat and drink for forty days.
These are the sort of tales that gave rise to the ancient artificial mount got up at Naples at public festivals, from which all sorts of things good to eat were scattered. There are endless references to
it in literature, of which a few will illustrate our subject, without by
any means taking us out of the line of the argument. In the
Fabliaux of the thirteenth century we find tha,t

Theophilo Folengo of Mantua, otherwise Merlinus Coccajus (Macaronensis;, in the famous Macaronic poem to which Rabelais owed so much, and which was first printed at Venice in 15 17, thus describes our Mountain :
Illic ad nebulas montagnfe culmen inalzant Quas smisurato si tu componis Olympo, CoUinam potius quam montem credis Olyinpum. Nee sint de petris facta scopulisque putato,
Verum de tenero duroque probavimus illas Formaio factas, et Sole calente colantes ; Ad fundum quarum sunt brodi flumina grass!, Undezzatque lacus niveo pro lacte biancus.
Omnia de fresco sunt littora facta botiro, Supra quae buliunt semper caldaria centum Plena casoncellis, macaronibus, atque foiadis.
And farther on, if we follow the anonymous and diverting French translator of 1606, wc hear of "certaines montagnes ou les habitans
lient les vignes avec des saucisses, ct oij les arbres partout portent
pour leur fruict des tourtes et tartes." A country where, as Le
Duchat said, all the meat is cooked to the hand, and the larks fall, as the saying goes, from the sky ready-roasted. Mr, Bob Fudge,
writing from Paris in 181 8, told his dream
of the land of Cockaigne, That Elysium of all that is friand and nice, Where for hail they have bonbons, and claret for rain, Aid the skaters in winter show off on creamrice 5 Where so ready all nature its cookery yields, Macaroni au Parmesan grows in the fields, Little birds fly about with the true pheasant taint, And the geese are all born with a liver complaint.
It is, in fact—and etymology agrees—the paradise of cooks, the fairyland of the admirable art and mystery of cookery and good eating, a sort of heavenly kitchen or gormandizing heaven, which siill holds its place in some theological books ; for a cathedral
prebendary not long since, in describing the bliss of the blessed, wrote " The whole future will be as a delicious feast. Creation will afford a magnificent banquet spread by the good God for his children, with amplest conceivable provision for the most capacious VOL. IL Z

and varied desires."^ Ages gone by lend respectability to this conception ; in the Rig Veda the first of men, Father Yama,
assembles the other fathers round him to enjoy convivial feasting under the dense foliage of trees in the middle of heaven^ ; and the origin of it all is doubtless to be sought in the sacrificial offerings and banquets which, once fire had been invented and applied, were probably the origin of all cookery.
In the dwelling of the great Mexican deity Quetzalcoatl he and his divine companions are miraculously wealthy not only in the noble metals and in precious jewels, but also in commodities of all sorts. Provisions never run short, and they live upon great
corncobs, each one of which is a big load for a man ; the smaller cobs they merely burn to heat their baths. Their calabashes are many armfuls round, they climb their leeks like a tree and their cotton grows ready dyed of all colours." Brobdingnag (or Brobdingrag, as Capt. Gulliver said he wrote the word for the misprinter) owes the pa}'s de Cocagne somewhat for imports. The Ethiopian Table of the Sun above Syene (mentioned by Herodotus in the fifth century B.C., by Pomponius Mela in the first century A.D., by Pausanias in the second, and by Solinus in the third) must be added to the geography of the pays de Cocagne. This "Table," according to Herodotus (iii, 17, 18, 23, 24), was a meadow which every morning was found covered with cooked joints of all sorts to a depth of four feet. The account is con
fusing, but he seems to say that the officials of the neighbouring town got the meat ready and spread during the night, while the natives believed that the earth produced the food. Pomponius
Mela, Pausanias (VI, xxvi), and Solinus represented the supply as supernatural. The Chinese tjn-ant Chow Sin, 1123 B.C., is recorded to have formed a lake of wine at his palace of Sha K'iu, and hung eatables to the trees* ; an extravagant trait of human nature repeated by those Irish gentry of the eighteenth century who used to make claret-cup in the wells. To the pays de Cocagne too perhaps belongs, as an outlying district, the children's " Tom Tiddler's ground," where they skip

The Cone.
THE conical or " peaked " tiara or head-dress is seen on the
Hittite sculptures, as frequently pointed out by Prof. Sayce.^ The accompanying outline is from a rock-carving at Boghaz-Keui.
It was the prerogative of gods and kings. The Babylonian Istar (Ashtoreth) of Carchemish wears nothing
else, being otherwise quite naked in a bas-relief. This cap or " pointed tiara " bore upward lines of ornament {ibid. 140). I annex another type from the hieroglyphics in relief brought from Jerabis to the British Museum.^ Sir C. W. Wilson says of the costume of the Kheta (Hittite) god in the rock-carving at Ivriz, or Ibreez, that
his "high-peaked {i.e. high-pointed) cap is still in use among some of the Kurdish tribes."^ Brugsch Bey says the Khetan warriors sculptured on the great Egyptian temple at Ibsambul have "high caps such as are worn at the present day by the Persians,"^ which gives us the origin of the familiar Parsi hat, adopted by them (as they say) from the Hindus. Prof. Sayce made the important and ingenious discovery that the sharply conical tall symbol for " king " in the Khetan glyphs " really
represents the royal head-dress."'^ And so significant an object can
never have had a merely accidental human origin ; it must, even
as a head-dress, as an ensign, of the high-priest and king, have had originally a direct connection with the deity he served and represented; and its use as a sacred (and afterwards as a warlike
and general) head-dress must have been highly symbolical. My
idea is that, just as the split mitre had its origin in the head and open mouth of the fish-skin of Dagon, so the conical headdress represents the conical Universe-mountain, the abode of the supreme heavens-god, the primeval type of the 01}'mpus of Jupiter,

for the soul of Mahomet pre-existed in a vase of light in that shape in the 'Alem i Ervah, the world of spirits. The Kubbeh or summit of the cap means " the summit of the sphere of the universe," that is God, the point of truth which allows the wearer to
see and know all things. The Nakshibendi dervishes teach that the heart is cone-shaped, and contains the whole reality or essence of man.^ The Persian dervish, whose patron is Ali, wears a conical red cap edged with fur. The central Kurdish mountaineers wear a high conical felt cap, with a red and black turban folded round it, and the Nestorian tribes wear a conical felt cap.- The Rev. W.
Wright, in his Empire of the Hittites (p. 5) speaks of " the sugarloaf-topped Dervishes" he saw at Hamah in 1872. See also what is said about the conical religious cap of the Sikh Akali (p. 680). It is worth remembering too that the Roman flamens wore a y conical head-dress which, with the little wool-wound rod which topped it, and from which the whole took its name, came to be called an apex ; and the term apex became extended so as even cmetaphorically to mean the priesthood.'' The cone was in Egypt a distinctive headgear of great personages in ceremonies. In the tomb of Khaemha a priest puts cones on the heads of the officials who are about to present themselves to King Amenophis III. The terra-cotta cones, called funereal and never found except
at Thebes, are still enigmas.'* Their shape is that of a sacred loaf of bread. The hieroglyph which shows a cone on the hand A fl
means tu or ti to give. So also does A . They are never more than
20 centimetres high, and 9 broad at the base. (Pierrct, Diet. 146.) I think we might regard the fez or tarbush of the East, now the badge of Moslem governmental service, as a still more truncated
form of the conical dervish's bonnet, which is exactly the tarbush
" produced." ""

The Trojan palladium bore a distaff in one hand (see " Weaving," p. 880) and it is not out of place to ask here whether the little wool-covered spike at the top of the conical cap of the
^ flamines and the Salii, was not a distaff too. In fact all the spikes
or poles on the heads of deities and their ministrants, ma}^ be, like the 7roXo9 of Aphrodite (p. 833) nothing but symbols of the Universeaxis, the. distaff par excellence round which the visible Universe is
spun into existence. (The interested reader is requested to dwell on this and to run it down in the Index.) Castor and Pollux were called the Plleati Fratres (Catullus xxxvii, 2) from their wearing of the plleus or plleum (= ttEXo?). ) It has been described as a bonnet of wool (recall the Golden
I
Fleece) in the form of half-an-egg, perfectly fitting the head. It
was worn in the Saturnalia and at feasts, festivals, and spectacles
(all originally sanctified) ; it was the cap of liberty put-on by freed
slaves.
(Would not the obscure connection between pilo to sprout hairs and pilo to shave be made less obscure if the shaving of the head, the tonsure, always accompanied the wearing of the plleus ?)
The Gothic sacrificers shaved their heads and wore a pileus-cap, while the rest of the nation went hairy, capillati. The Parthians wore it.^ Its night-cap shape would be very much in point if it
be, as one must lean to thinking, the cap of the heavens ; and the shaving would accord with the term " bald heavens " (p. 666). The physiological fact of certain children being born with a pileus, or caul, no doubt helped-on the holy faith in this divine heavenssymbol.^ The inscription Liberldi's, which accompanies the cap on
coins would originally have reference to the god Liber, and the I Phrygian falling cap may connect itself with the toppled-over 1 mountain (p. 913). Servius, quoting Suetonius, made pileus a
generic term — like our cap—and included in it three differing
priests'-caps : the very light apex, that is the pileus which bore the wool-wrapped rod called the apex (virga, lana circumdata et filo
colligata in yEn. ii, 683) ; the tutulus, {m.i.y with wool, which ranup in a point, and was worn by the P"lamen and his wife ; and the

galerus, made of the hide of victims. The Flamen Diahs alone wore a white galerus. All the Latin words in pil- seem sacred, and partake of the confusion which tends to envelop archaic divine terms ; so that in writing of them one cannot say with any confidence : Mea pila est. Here is the drawing of a coin of Thasos, representing the Dioskouroi with stars over
their conical bonnets. The inscription is said
to be %daiov. (Gesner, Mits. Haym. ii, 107.) (See the heading The Dioscures.) Also of a Lacedemonian coin with the conical (or beehive?) bonnets of the Dioskouroi ("cabinet de la Bibliotheque du roi "—given in Guig
niaut's Creuzer, plate 216). Here we must indubitably fit on the endless magic caps of the mystic tales which are now degraded to the folk and fairy category. Jack-the Giant Killer's cap of knowledge ; the magic cap of Solomon given in the Persian tale to King Bahram Ghur by the lord of one of the four Kaf Mountains of the four quarters of the Universe; the wishing-hat of Fortunatus; the hat of invisibility in the Norse tale of the Three Princesses of VVhiteland (the heavens) ; the Tarn-Hut or hat of darkness in the Nibelungcnlied and in the Niffiunga Saga; and the Nebel-Kappe or cloud-capof KingAlbcrich and the otherdwarfsof old German legend. The conical head-coverings of the dervishes, and the conical \
tops of the Round Towers (p. 264) may have to be bracketted with the solid cones found at Egyptian tombs, the perhaps GrecoBabylonian hollow funereal cones or " extinguishers," and the sacred cones and conical idols often represented on the stelai of Punic tombs. Similar but more primitive cones have been found in ancient Cypriot sepultures, and a similar small Assyrian idol has
been discovered.^ A piece of Cyprus terra-cotta antiquity in the Louvre Museum consists of three women (?) dancing in a ring
round a sort of column with a conical finial — doubtless the world
pillar—and there are also two similar examples in the calcareous local (Cypriot) stone.I scarcely like to venture the suggestion that some of these cones may be connected with the Eg)-ptian mountain Apento, of

incredible heiglit, the horn of the world ; but I know not with what else to connect all these conical objects besides the
mythical world-mountain. M. Maspero mentions the conical loaves of bread in ancient
Egypt, with a floury outside ; and it is well known that all over the world, cakes or loaves have at all times been made in the form of religious symbols, for offerings, and for consumption at sacrificial feasts.^ And there can be no doubt that in these loaves we have the origin of our sugar-loaves of the present day.If I am not very far wrong, the high origin of all these symbols
is identical with that of the famous conical black stone with rough
nesses and stripes, and of celestial descent,'' a beth-El like those in Syro-Phoenician and Arab beliefs, which was the arch-symbol of the great Syrian mountain-god Gibil, the god of the black stone whose worship answers exactly to the worship of " High Places" in the Old Testament* ; and which black stone was brought to Rome by Elagabalus ; was, after his death, returned to Emessa and was there honoured by Aurelian.^ The stone of Artemis at

Mountain^ The Cone.
The stone of Ashtoreth (Aphrodite) at Byblos is seen to be conical on an enlarged coin of that place struck under Macrinus given in Donaldson's ArcJiitcctiira Nuinisniatica, No. 30. Two
pedestal-pillars consecrated to Melkart at Malta by Abdosir and Osirsamar, and originally about four feet high (now in the Louvre) were conical. See the engraving of one (truncated by fracture ?) in Perrot and Chipiez.^ The stone found at Athienou in C}'prus by Ceccaldi is 65 centimetres high, and may have been a truncated
cone (Perrot and Chipiez, iii, 273). Tliere can be no doubt as to the shape of the stone about a metre high found in the Giganteja in the Island of Gozo, next Malta. The base is elliptical ; while
the fragm.ents of a similar stone found in the Hagiar Kim at Malta
show its base to have been circular {ibid. 299, 305). All these are of course Phoenician, but the strangest is perhaps the following design from a stela recently found at the site of the
Lilybitiuu.

In the latter case, the funereal cones of Thebes (apart from the
initial significance of their form) would be representations of durable loaves of bread offered to
the dead — a sort of " hard-tack," like the pretence
offerings so made in many lands. Note the conical cap of the (Kabiric ?) priest or worshipper. The candelabra (?) opposite him does not at present concern us, but the symbol next it does ; Carthage. and SO another is added very much resembling
it, from a Carthaginian stela in the Louvre. Perrot and Chipiez' see in these " the goddess represented by a rough naive copy of a conical stone, to which arms and a head have been added " ; but even with the best
intentions, and " making believe ever so much," it is hard to go that length. They
say the same thing of this other Carthage
example, except that it has " sidereal symbols." There is a fine old saying: " Tell that
to the Marines ; the sailors won't believe a
word of it." But I draw attention to the
identity of the three straight parts of this
last with the position of the great flat
stones of a dolmen seen in profile, and
also to the identity of the top straight piece and the circle, with the Egyptian Q

The " crescent " is less like one in a stela from Hadrumetum. This may be heavens and earth ?) Another curious damaged example, also from Carthage, is added. It is flanked by two sacred birds and exhibits the dot in the circle with which this Inquiry is much concerned
elsewhere. Is it here an omphalos .'' The figure of S symbol on an upright rod on the Lilybaium
stela is called by Perrot and Chipiez a caduccus. On many of the stelae of Hadrumetum this appears twice. If the emblem of a
Phoenician god, it may on the stelse indicate a priest's wand, like

similarity with the points of these rods.
In the Phcenician temple of Golgoi (now Athienou) in Cyprus, a cone of grey stone three feet high was found by Cesnola, which must have been the idol-stone of the goddess, and accords with
that of Astarte at Paphos described by Tacitus {Hist, ii, 2). The
similar stone found at Gozo is mentioned on p. 927. The conical stone of Astarte at Paphos is thus given, in the
cella of her temple, on a Cyprus coin of the reign of Augustus. (Miinter : Die Jiinnnlische
Gbttin zu Paphos, tab. iv, i.) Other presentations of this holy stone are given under the heading TJie Dokana, p. 254. The Hittite temple at Mabog had, according to the Greek writer we call Lucian, a cone-like column of great height at each side of the entrance. These are said to have been emblems of the
goddess of fertility.^ Lakshmi, the female principle, the consort of Siva is sometimes
represented erect wearing a conical mitre. In some Siamese statues of Buddha the skull rises in a conical form, and the tall, pointed, crown of the king is like this curious
rising cranium. Their temple spires, too, change in the top story from a square pyramid to a cone and then soar, for some forty
feet, to a point.^ Have we here the rationale of the pressing of the infant skull into inhuman shapes, as practised by some " savage " races ?

I suggest, be identified with the three cones and peaks in the Siva
legend at p. 908. Jagannath's sanctuary at Puri is surmounted by a lofty conical tower, and among the sculptures at Kanarak, in the
same holy district, there exist figures of men with high-pointed
caps seated cross-legged on lotus-flowers, engaged in meditation^

These earthly godfathers of Heaven's Lights, That give a name to every fixed star, Have no more profit of their shining Nights Than those that walk and wot not what they are. {Love's Labour's Lost., i, i, 88.)
THE modern comparative mythologist cannot afford to
neglect Astrology, which, unfortunately, wc have in general been too long accustomed to regard merely in one of its
aspects — its ridiculous side. No one, in these days of scientific astronomy, of minute and universal meteorological observation, of
Nature-study— that is, if he be sane and not utterly ignorant thinks of lending a minim's weight to star-influence or to a horo
scope ; but if we view astrology in its aboriginal, unfalien, form,
when it was the elaborate theology of a very real, absorbing, most ancient faith, there soon become apparent a vast number of facts and illustrations, which are of great intrinsic value in expounding worldwide myths, the clues to which seem to have been all but utterly lost even in the earliest times of Greek, Vedic, Avestan or Japanese literature. It is astrology that has preserved to us the symbolism
and significance of the names of the constellations, and in saying that



The Night of the Gods. [ The Number
it is perhaps the most ancient science in the world, one is giving a
o-rand patent of nobihty to modern scientific astronomy, which
developed out of sacred astrology, just as chemistry out of alchemy ; and mediaeval alchemy again, as is well known, was intimately wedded to, welded into, astrology.
St. Augustine's account of his addiction to astrology, and how
he was cured of it is well-known {Confessions, i, 177, 377) together with his story of the slave and his own friend Firminus, the patrician, both born at the same moment, and both having therefore an identical horoscope. Augustine's dilemma of the
twins scarcely holds water. Pierre de I'Arrivey the younger, was a celebrated mathe
matician, astronomer, astrologer, almanack-maker, and calculator
of horoscopes— as all astronomers were then bound to be— at
Troyes in the first half of the 17th century. Bayle mentions him (s.v. Hermant) and tells how he obtained his renown, and a great sale for his almanacks, by what the modern irreverent calls a fluke.
One of his predictions for a certain month was Latin perdu, and it
so chanced that the Latin funeral oration on Marshal Gassion was in that month forbidden by the Censor to be declaimed before the Sorbonne. Thus was Pierre de I'Arrivey's fortune swiftly and easily established. According to his own horoscope he was fated to die of a fishbone. He therefore never ate fish, and consequently did not die as his horoscope condemned him to do. Here is a
diverting dilemma for an astrological casuist.
A
parallel, and almost a contemporary, case to the Christian saint's might be found in the Chinese Choo Yung, who in his
vounger years was much addicted to divination, but, being at length
convinced of its folly, he, circa A.D. 470, wrote a short treatise to
expose its fallacy. (Wylie's Notes, 133.) When the new brooms She Hwang-ti and his minister Li-Sze, thwarted and disgusted by the precedent-books of the obstinate
old Chinese literati, ordered, in or about 213 B.C., the destruction of all extant Chinese books, works on astrology, divination, agricul
ture and medicine —all four then inextricably interblended—were
alone expressly spared.^ Perhaps it is to the .saving of this ancient literature that is now due whatever we know of the most ancient astrolo"-y extant ; but even if all such man-made books had been

swept from off the earth by the flames, their subject, astrognosy, was indestructible ; the great book of the heavens was always displayed above, and its lore still descends traditionally through
generations of tribes that never conned a human treatise. One might go farther, and say that even the old treatises on magic
conceal, for those who approach them in the spirit, not of a
dilettanti but of an "abstractor of quintessence"— to use one of
Rabelais's stock phrases — a mine of information upon antique " superstitions," our unthinking, contemptuous, term for the relics, the survivals, of lost faiths. ^ Thraetona, the inventor of Magic in Zoroastrianism, was also a physician, and evil magic was created
by Ahriman.
Magus est qui sidera novit, Qui sciat herbarum vires, cultumque deorum.
Such were the wise men of the East ; and there still survives here and there a " wise woman." It might be added that an efficient ransacking of the materials
for the history of the secret and mystic societies and associations of the past ought to be of the utmost use in the comparative study of mythologies, rituals and religions. Unfortunately most investiga
tors of these miaterials have been either of the omni-credulous
species, or mere caterers of " gapeseed." There are several Chinese books which would assuredly yield a rich harvest to the student. Would that I could inoculate some young, capable, and vigorous Chinese scholar with the desire to translate, or even as our neighbours say compel (compulser) them. Such are the Pien hwo pien \% ^ H which was written by
Siai Ying-fang about the middle of the fourteenth century upon
the superstitions of the period. These he set down under fifteen
heads : life and death, pestilence, spiritual powers, sacrifices, illicit
sacrifices, elfish monstrosities, witchcraft, divination, mourning
observances, choice of burial places, physiognomy, fortune-telling, positions, times and days, and strange doctrines. Another is the
Yen-tsing g" ffi ^ written by Lew Chung-yuh early in the present dynasty. It is a collection of notes on the meanings of Chinese
characters, researches as to the origins of customs, and kindred
topics. In these days, when the scientific investigation of such

subjects, as an aid to comparative studies, has attained to such
important proportions, it is quite possible that the Folklore Society (of which I have the honour to be a very useless member) might, upon just cause shown, see fit to encourage the labours here
suggested.
Then there is a whole class of books on the marvellous— such as the Po-wuh-chi f^ Jf^ J^ of the 3rd century ; the Sow-shin
Ki ^ jji^ |£ of the 4th century ; the Shuh-i Ki 2lt ^ ffi of
the 6th : the Suh-tse-heae Ki |^ # f-f fg, of the Liang dynasty ; the Yew-Kwai-Iuh of the 8th century ; the Po-i-chi, of the 9th ; and the Luh-i Ki H ^ fg by Tu Kwang-t'ing, a
Taoist priest of the loth century, which is now considered to be disposed of when it is complacently ticketted " a fabulous record."
If all the books that could be so labelled were shelved, a good many religions would have to go without their " sacred books of
the East." Yet another book, the K'in-ting tsien luh %% % ^ f^, compiled in accordance with an imperial order of 1750, gives in its last part the medals of various kinds used as charms. These exhibit strange devices, pictured or written, which are
supposed chiefly to draw their signification and potency from Taoist and Buddhist divine legends.^ It is much too late in the day to keep up the empty pooh-poohing of these sources of information as to the Night of the Gods, Professor R. K, Douglas has
with his usual kindness directed my attention also to books of the Slian-hai King ^ \% f^ category. This " Mountain and River
Classic " is certainly at least as old as the Chow dynasty, and
probably olden It concerns the charts graven on the -^ ^ Nine Vases or tripods of Yii. This Tai Yii -j^ ^, the Great Yii was a fabulous descendant of the divine Hwang-Ti. His miraculous conception took place on his mother seeing a falling-star and swallowing a divine pearl. In nine years he subdued the deluge,
that is made creation out of the waters, and divided his empire into
nine provinces (see p. 71 1). He engraved his achievements on a stone-tablet on one of the peaks of Mount Heng (in Hupeh, which connects him with Hcuen-T'ien Shang Ti, see p. 524). His nine provinces sent him tribute of metals (which gives us the Japanese metal-mountain of heaven (see p. 682), with which metal he made his Nine Vases or Tripods, bearing delineations of all the objects
of Nature, which gives us the Greek idea so familiar in their legends

of the various celestial symbols made by Hephaistos, including the
Kv^eKjr] of Cypselus. His object was by these figures to instruct his people as to gods and demons ;^ which is the deity revealing
himself in his creation. The substance of all things, a Chinese savant explains, has its image in the heavens, and its form on earth ; and the mutability
of human things is surely traced on high.^ This is remarkably in accordance with the reference given to the Avestan Commentary of Darmesteter (i. lix, p. 948 infra) which shows that in the Zoroastrian faith celestial things had their terrestrial counterparts. Frangois Lenormant thought it was the Chaldeans who perfected the genethliac art by attaching terrestrial things to things on high, and the heavens to the lower world ; seeing and showing in this mutual sympathy of the parts of the universe, the harmony which
unites them as by a sort of musical accord.^ And in fact if one
identifies his Earth with himself, with the Subject, it demands no great metaphysical stretch to view the heavens, that is the rest of
the universe, as objective in their relation to that Subject.
For the Chaldeans, astrology and religion were one, a sidereal pantheism, a sabeism.'* Gesenius was very strong on this,^ and one cannot understand how Guigniaut could maintain that astrology could never be the primitive element of any religion. It seems like swearing it's noon-day at midnight. Dr. Walk's Budge says*' the largest astrological work of the Bab}'lonians contained 70 tablets and was compiled by command of Sargon I, King of Agade, 3800 B.C. It was called '' the illumi
nation of Bel." Their observations were made in towers,
ziggurate (see p. 443). The Chaldeans were not greater astrognostics than the Aztecs, and at this moment no Hindu ever for an instant thinks of doubting
the divinity or the influence of the planets.'' Nothing of importance is ever done by a Hindu without consulting the stars ; there is still a family astrologer, just as we have our family doctor or
solicitor.
To this day the Kings of Buddhist Siam maintain a body of Brahmin astrologers or soothsayers, hon, to choose out days and

hours of good omen, and to superintend state ceremonies. These are genuine Brahmins, and not Buddhists, who worship in their own Brahman temple/ So late as 1587, professors of the Univer
sity of Cracow gave attention to astrology, and the town itself maintained a public astrologer. Ivan the Terrible, of Russia, when on his death-bed, had a consultation of witches who were brought
express from Lapland." But all this is, after all, a survival, a
caput mortuum, of the old universal living faith and worship ;
almost as much so as Dryden's half-forced belief in horoscopes.
Even when Charles the Wise of France founded a college in Paris in 1370 for the study of medicine and astrology, every sentiment of star-worship had for ages been wholly lost in Western Europe. Louis XI's belief in astrology and in his astrological impostors was but part of the innate superstition of his cunning, low-typed brain ;
and an Italian intriguer and female assassin like Catherine de
Medicis was well-fitted with her Cagliostro, the Florentine Cosmo
Ruggieri. She brought astrology into such fashion that all French dames then employed an astrologer whom they called their baron, and scarcely dared, any more than the mild Hindu, to do anything
without consulting him.^ But this was all a mere galvanizing of the dead, and any one of those mysterious gentry would now be
summarily dealt with in the nearest police-court.
In Mahommedan countries it is still, however, far different, and one of the subjects taught at this moment in the famous Garuin University at Fez (Fas) in Morocco deals with the talismanic numbers and the supputation thereby of the influence of angels, spirits, and stars ; the discovery of the names of the victor and the vanquished that are to be ; or the determination of the desired
object, and of him who seeks it. But it is very rare, nowadays, to
find a professor who fully possesses the principles of this science,
and who is also capable of teaching it/

mant- also showed from the Puranas how the divine Ganga, the source of all rivers, travels seven times round Mount Meru, the residence of the Gods, the central point of the visible Heaven, the axis of the World, the summit of which is at the North celestial Pole. These seven circuits of the heaven-river are made as it descends from the abode of the Seven Rishis or Sages, the seven
chief stars of the Great Bear. This is the simplest genealogy of the Seven Rishis.

Praj^patis (All-fathers).
[Schopenhauer's human Wille, a portion of the Ding an Sich, the Universal Wille (Brahma-Swayambhu) evolving the brain (or Manu-organ) is a reproduction of this.] The 7 Rishis or Saptarshis are given at pp. 888 and 973. As the Rishis who proceed-from are the great stars of Ursa-Major, Brahma, the proceeded-from, ought to be the Polar deity. The Rishis as stars are also called Rikshas
and Chitra (bright) sikhandinas. Sikhandin and Sikhandini were
children of Drupada. In the Zend Avestct we have the river of Ahura Mazda, from
which alone flow all the waters that spread all over the Seven Karshvares, or divisions of the Universe. This was a preparation
for the seven principal directions or cardinal points, and the seven winds of the Hindus. Their Maruts, storm-gods or spirits of the winds, were also seven, or seven times seven. This last conception can be pursued into Scandinavian Myth, where an infinite number is expressed as seven times seventy- seven, which is the number of
the celestial gates of Valhalla.'*

The Night of the Gods. [ The Niimbe}'
The sacredness and mystic significance of the number Seven
has, I believe, never been—and it would not seem that it can be
traced farther back than this Northern astral origin. It gives me much pleasure to find that Sir G. Birdwood's
Indian lore leads him to consider that " the seven asterisms of the Great Bear first gave to that number its immemorial holiness."^ The high honour always and everywhere paid to this grand constellation, which we call Ursa Major, is well shown in its ancient astrological Chinese title Ti Cheh,- the Chariot of the Supreme. Its more modern Chinese name is Peh-Tow, Northern Bushel, which compares with ours of The Dipper (which a Chinese
'bushel" resembles), •' as CJiariot does with our Waggon and Horses {cf. the Latin Septem-triones,* seven labour-oxen) and the AngloSaxon Churl's Wain (ceorles, now Charles's, ween). The Greeks,
of course, called it both Chariot and Bear, a^ia^a and dpKTo<; (as well as 'EXt/c?;, from its turning round the Pole). Whence, we need little doubt it, the Heliconian mountain and stream, and that
name of the muses. The adjectival title of Jupiter Elicius, by which he was implored to vouchsafe celestial signs, must, too, clearly come from 'EXt/c?;, and not from his presence being elicited
(!) as Ovid funnily said {Fasti, iii, 327), and as Clough repeated in
his notes to Plutarch's Niiina (v. also Smith, Diet. Aiit. 150). Thus, too, the Seven Heliades (see p. 617), the sons of the wheel-goddess Rhode, are indubitably the Seven of Ursa-Major. The Persians and the Turks still say "the Seven Stars " and the Indians Golden Sea. The name Bear seems to exist only in the European and Indian Spheres (Skt. Riksha). The Egyptians seem to have put a Dog there (the unfallen Typhon?) and the Hebrews a Boar (G. Schlegel : Uranog. Ctii., p. 684). The name Bear may be conjectured to have arisen in Northern climes, where it held the place of king of animals. The surviving Ainu worship of the bear, and the fact that the North- American Indians call the constellation the Bear mieht be adduced.

Some of the Eskimo call their good god Torngarsak a big bear. In the Kaleivala when the Finns have killed a bear they sing to him " The honey-footed Bear was born in lands between sun and moon, and he died not by men's hands but of his own will."^ The goddess Atacntsic, founder of the Algonkins, fell down through a hole in the heavens when she was hunting a bear, or by " another
account " she cut down a heaven-tree and fell with the fall thereof^

Ursa Minor.—The Arabic name Dub-al-asgar (Al-dubb-alasghar) means the lesser bear. Another-name, Alrucaba, belongs
properly to the polestar in the point of its tail. The two other tail-stars were called by the Greeks, according to Aratos, the
'Xppevrai, or dancers. The two stars in the forepart of the body,
^ (kochab) and 7, are called al-ferkathan (al-farkadein, the two calves). Theon, annotating Aratos, said the Lesser Bear was also called the Dog, whence Cynosure (Kvvo'i + ovpd) for the dog's tail, and so for the polar star, and then generally for any great /^oiut de
mire. Aratos also said that both Bears were called by the name afu,a^a,
a chariot. It seems admissible to theorise that arctos (unusually arctus) the Great Bear is connected with arx and the verb arceo. (See what is stated on these last words under "The Arcana.") Arcturus, A/)«:toO/3o?, was a name for the whole constellation Bootes as well
as for the principal, brilliant red, first magnitude, star of that con
stellation. It is said to be from apKTo<i and ovpa or ovpo<;, as being at the tail of, or the ward of, the Great Bear, and appearing to follow it. Furthermore, Arcturus seems to have been frequently
used for Arctus, 'Ap/cro?, the Great Bear itself, and has even been identified, with Arkas, son of Kallisto by Zeus who changed son and mother into the Great and Little Bears. Arktophulax, bearword, was another name for Bootes, and therefore it may be concluded for Arcturus, which would thus perliaps mean bear-follower and not bear-tail. Other accounts sa}' that Arkas (see " The Arcana ") was placed in the heavens as Arktophulax. One of the numerous Chinese triplets is that of the three regulators of time : the Sun, the Moon, and Ursa Major under its name of Peh-Tovv, the Northern Bushel,^ which of course changes
its (say) midnight position according to the seasons. Its principal
stars are the Ts'i Sing, the Seven Stars par excellence, each of
which, as in Arabic, has its separate name.- a (Dubhe) is called

of T'ien-chu (/3, 7, a3233, b3i62 and another) says the T'ien-yuenIcih-le o^ i6%2. Another small star in Ursa Minor was called the

The " pivot "-names for (3 and 7 of Ursa Minor would similarly take us back about 4,000 years. a (Dubhe) of Ursa Major dates us back 2,500 years and ^ in the same constellation (which was and will be) indubitably the nearest to the pole-path to about the same date as the mid-distance of the t'.vo stars of Draco. It is not easy to dispose of this evidence of the antiquity of Chinese astronomy. The methods of regulating by the Northern Bushel were described by Hu-Kwan-tse in the 4th century B.C. ; but the Record of Rites carries the matter much further back, sa}-ing that Ta Nao calculated the revolving motions of the Tow constellation in the 27th century B.C. The Sun, the Moon, and the Seven Stars of the Bushel appear again in the Chinese symbol-catalogues as Kiu Yao, the nine Lights of heaven. I hazard the surmise that t -.e following cryptic verse of the Rig Veda may also refer to
Ursa Major : " Of those that are born together, sages have called tl.e seventh the single-born ; for six are twins, and are moveable,

and born of the gods . . . and revolve for that which is

In the first of the "five reigns of antiquity," the primeval Yellow Emperor Hwang-Ti was miraculously born ; his mother
becoming pregnant on seeing a flash of lightning in the Northern
Bushel, that is the Great Bear.^ Exactly the same idea is found in the Rig Veda (iii, 204).
" The Seven Rishis were the protectors of this our [kingdom] when the son of Durgaha was in bonds. Performing worship, they obtained for [his wife] from the favour of Indra and Varuna
Trasadasyu, like Indra the slayer of foes, dwelling near the gods." The commentator explains that Durgaha's son Purukutsa being a
prisoner, his wife propitiated the Seven Rishis to obtain a son who might take his father's place ; in consec^uence of which Trasadasyu
was born. The celestial, astrological character of this " Emperor" Hwang
Ti indicate rather the status of a primitive Polar deity, as here expounded. The mountain, the heaven -river, the bear, and the
wheel, are all in his legend, for he was born near a river, dwelt near a mountain, and inherited the Bear (being also called Yew-Nai), which last the commentators, no doubt erroneously, interpret to mean " the Bear country." I think that this might perhaps be
understood as an instance of the Northern Bushel having been called the Bear by the early Chinese ; more especially as we find Hwang-Ti, who was its son, instructing Ta Nao to calculate the
revolving motions of the constellation.^ One of Hwang-Ti's names, Hien Yiian, is but feebly explained in the legends by making him the inventor of wheeled carts ; it doubtless refers to his being a wheel-god. Not alone so, but he is given the construction of astronomical instruments, the composition of a calendar, the making of
twelve musical bells for denoting the seasons (months)^ and finally

like the Japanese Izanagi —he built a palace called Ho-kung, a name which must refer to the universal heaven, which palace was the first royal abode, and a temple for the worship of Shang-Ti, the supreme god. Legends and fables beyond number have

Hwang-Ti for their centre.^ In the legends of two others of the " five reigns of antiquity," we find that Yao directed the brothers Hi and Ho—probably astral conceptions— to observe the planetary revolutions ; and that Yu's mother became pregnant by seeing a falling star.^ Such things serve to show how real the term " celestial empire " once was, bound up as it was (like " middle kingdom ") with a heaven-worship which has perhaps vegetated into the rank
growth still observable by us in modern popular Taoism. But there need be no hesitation in admitting the actual and
very vivacious survival of the worship of the Seven of Ursa Major, The Abbe Hue in his famous Travels'' tells much about the blue
button, seven-tail Chinese Mandarin Ly, pacificator of kingdoms

the Ta-Lao-ye, Ly Kouo-Ngan— who conducted him and the Abbe Gabet back from Thibet to China. Ly was of plebeian
origin and a native of the capital of the Sze-chuen province. He
believed neither in the Bonzes nor in the Lamas ... all his religion consisted in a fervent veneration for the Great Bear . . . He believed that even a toad might become a spirit and be deified if it made a point every night of worshipping the Great Bear. When Ly Kouo-Ngan came to his singular system of the
Great Bear, it was futile to reason with him. We contented ourselves with smiling at him and holding our tongues. " Ah ! " said he, " you laugh at me because I speak of the Seven Stars ; and,
indeed, as you do not believe in their influence, it is wrong in me
to speak to you of them." . . . Ly Kouo-Ngan possessed a fair judgment when he was not confused with this Great Bean
This was in 1846; and it sounds as if there was still a good
deal of solid, and stolid, faith left in poor old Seven-sable-tailed Ly. "As you are aware," writes me Prof G. Schlegel (21st April, 1888), "the Emperor of China worships to the present day the Seven Stars of the Northern Bushel (Great Bear) ; and by clause 161 of the Chinese Law private individuals are expressly for
bidden to pray to God (5^ T'ien) or to worship the Great Bear with the Seven Lamps representational of the Seven Stars of this constellation." That is, the Emperor alone is the mediator who prays for his people. The Mikado of Japan archaically assumed,
and now holds, a similar position. " Close at the back of Shan-hing (about 60 miles due W. of

Canton) lie seven isolated limestone peaks rising abruptly out of
the low green plain. These are called The Seven Stars, and were once a favourite resort for pious people who went to worship at the temples and caves. They are not much visited now. In one of the larger temples there are (I was told) several images of bronze,
seven feet in height. I regret that we were unable to inspect the
caves. "^ My learned friend Dr. W. G. Aston, who has written the excellent grammars of the Japanese written and spoken language, also informs me that he has found in a popular modern novel by the prolific Bakin an instance of the actual worship of the Northern
Bushel in Japan also. It occurs in a conjuring or divination scene
or ceremony for the discovery of a thief Bakin is a scholar,
deeply read in Chinese, and also in the folklore, history, and
traditions of Japan. He has little humour.On the 7th night of the 7th month is the Japanese festival of
Star-worship (Hoshi-Matsuri). Seven flowers are then arranged (three, two, and two) in three vases. The centre of the central
vase is reserved for the sakaki or Cleyera Japonica (see p. 891).
The stems are tied together vvith five-coloured silken cords of
prayer or negai no ito.^ Here we have clearly Ursa Major, the sacred triad, and the Chinese sacred number five, upon which a
book might be written. This festival of the 7th of the 7th is honoured in Korea as well
as in China and Japan.* An Egyptian funereal MS. which Deveria stated to be " foreign to the Ritual " (Louvre V, 45, 3244) makes the defunct "adore the children of the Thigh," that is the stars of Ursa Major.^ The MS. also speaks of " contemplating the sun who embraces Tatenen, passing over the abodes of Manun, attaining the basin of the lotus, and the sycamore which is in the middle of the sea." This MS. " foreign to the Ritual " would seem to belong to archaic heavens
worship. The tree in the centre of the Ocean is of course the Universe-tree, and the basin is also the same Ocean. "Manu"

Ptah. I know not what authority there may be for using the word "sun," and so making the sun embrace Ptah. De Rouge/ describing one of the three coffins of Sutimes, mentioned " right and left of the scarab, a ram-headed god whom the goddess Neith surrounds with her arms . . . the divine mother thus embraces the sun-god." Of course, this is mere speculation of de Rouge's ; but here we have the sun in two somewhat funny and incongruous positions : embracing Ptah, and embraced by Neith. The Khepesh if/^cz^ worn as an amulet by the ancient Egyptians must I think be clearly conceded to be derived from the Great
Bear and not from a leg-of-beef. M. Pierret agrees that Khepesh
is the name of the northern constellation in the funereal rituals
{Diet. 165, 571, 38). It is strange that the royal sword p as well
as the Great Northern Bear should be called Khepesh. I know not whether we are to claim for the worship of Ursa Major the consecration to the Bear of Artemis of the Attic virgins called apKTOL in the Athenian festivals called Brauronia;.- It is a
strange fact, too, that the number Seven should have also been
called Pallas ; in fact the words Pallas, palladium (which fell from
heaven), et hoc genus omne, require a thorough sifting-out from
this point of view.
Otfried Miiller identifies Callistowith Artemis Calliste, the most
beautiful, for Pausanias said there was a shrine of Artemis Calliste by the side of the tumulus-grave of Callisto'* ; and he explains the legends about Artemis Brauronia by saying the bear must have been sacred to the goddess. Mr. Andrew Lang acutely suggests that the bear was the goddess at an extremely remote period, or the goddess succeeded to an ancient worship of the animal.* At Brauron and Munychia of Attica the youthful priestesses were
called bears, apKroc, they danced like bears [apKreveiv), and otherwise played the bear, or performed the apKreia, wearing even
bearskins, no doubt of sacrificed animals, which is a universal masquerade — practised even in pre-Spanish Mexico with man
skins ; and at Munychium a fawn dressed up as a girl was
actually sacrificed to Artemis. Pausanias saw (vii, 18, 19) li\e

Laphria at Patras. Artemis may, after all, be apKr^ixi'^. Compare,
too, the odd word aptfreov, said to be from apx^^, with what is said
about other words in arch- (p. 396). Dionysos also changed himself into a bear in the Odyssey. An important plate showing the marriage of Krishna to a Bear may be consulted in Moor's Hindu PantJicon, plate 64.
I have cited a passage from the Tien Kzuan Shu, in which
the Great Bear is described as pivoting round the Pole like a
chariot in its course, and another text from the Rig Veda (i, 164, 2) which speaks of The Seven yoking the Chariot, and of an only courser with a sevenfold name, which are clear references to the still surviving name of our own " Waggon and Horses "
; and the
veneration of these stars as rishis was due to their close position
and apparent functions round the Polar deity. To this day two of
those stars are, roughly, our ''pointers'' for the Pole. The Rishis
appear in the Avesta as the seven Amesha-Spentas, who rule over
the seven Karshvares of the Universe {Z.A. i, 207) ; the undying and well-doing (i, Ix), who are all seven of one thought, of one speech, of one deed ; whose Father and Commander is the Maker, Ahura Mazda (ii, 199, 290). They are the all-ruling, the all-benefi
cent (ii, 15) ; the bright ones, whose looks perform their wish [i.e., star-force, astral power ; they " rain influence "] ; strong, lordly,
who are undecaying and holy (ii, 290). They are, further, the makers and governors, the shapers and overseers, the keepers and
preservers of the creations of Ahura (ii, 291). They showed Zoroaster the way to long glory in the world above (ii, 336). " Converse ye with the Amesha-Spentas," said Zoroaster to the young king
Vistaspa (ii, 339). In like manner we find in Assyria, Syria and Phoenicia the seven great gods of whom Maruduk or Mardiik was king.^ The stars of Ursa Major were also worshipped as the Haptoiringas in the Avesta— those stars that are seven in number, the Haptoiringas, made by Ahura Mazda, glorious and healing
{Z.A. ii, 9) ; the leaders of the stars in the North (ii, 97). In
1 Kevue des Etudes Juives, iii, 187, 192. It remains to be seen whether this refers to a period of star or of sun and planet worship. It would seem that Maruduk's position as the senior planetary God was a secondary phase {O^-ig. de PHist., i, 525 to 527).
Primitively Belos or Bel-Maruduk was the demiurgos [il>id., 566). He was the 7th Patriarch or God-protector of Babylon [iHd., 254. 255). The I 2th month was sacred to these seven great gods (Budge's Baby I. Life and Hist. 128).

Mr. West's Pahlavi Texts (iii, 92) we find that "every single constellation when it comes in at Alburj " (which may be here taken as the mountainous horizon) " holds to and begs protection
from Haptoiringa." With such texts we might compare " He that
maketh the seven stars " in Amos v, 8, and " He had in his right
hand seven stars" in Revelations i, 16. The Seven great powers, the Thesasu, of the Egyptian ritual,

It is idle to waste time in doubt as to the supreme significance
of the name, position, and functions of these Thesasu. Here we have the ideas of the heavens, of the Atlas (supporter and mountain), of encompassing, of Lord-and-Mastership, of might, and of
the Seven all together. In Babylon there were the Seven great gods, and an equal
number of great evil spirits — the familiar seven devils in fact. " Seven are they, Seven are they ; in the abyss of the deep. Seven are they ; in the brightness of the heavens Seven are they," says a tablet.^ Ninkigal, the Babylonian Hades, had Seven gates, and there were seven deadly winds. Seven times seven were the trans

gressions of the Babylonian penitent.^ Ea's weapon had seven rays. The twelfth Babylonian month called Addaru (February) was dedicated to the Seven great gods. (The god Adar had the
fourth month, Duzu (July), dedicated to him.)^ According to Solarljod's skald, the sons of Mimer-Nithi come
from the north in Mimer's domain, and are in all seven." Mimir was the word of the middle root of the world-tree. We may see the unlimited power of perpetual renascence with which this mythus is informed in the Seven Templars who, after Jacques de Molay, was burnt before Notre Dame, revived their
order on the Scottish island of Mull. I can trace no shadow of a proof that the Seven Krittikas, the spouses of the Seven Rishis of Ursa Major, are our Pleiades. To
talk of the Seven Pleiades is (on that supposition) to mention the non-existent ; there are not seven remarkable Pleiades for any naked-eyed observer of the heavens. Mangala, the second son of Siva (or Rudra) by Parvati, the mountain-goddess, or by Agni, or
by Ganga, the river-goddess, is the God of War, who corresponds to Mars, and who is therefore a supreme central god. He was put
to nurse with the (constellation of the) Seven Krittikas, conjectured to have been the Pleiades or the Lesser Bear,* and thus got the
further name of Karttikeya and his six heads, A fable which puts the polestar to nurse with the Little Bear is understandable. Not so one which sends him down the sky to our Pleiades. That the Seven of the Smaller Bear should furnish wives to the Seven of the
Larger is also mythically reasonable. That they should also have
been considered as Twins by the Romans (see p. 837) is an important fact falling easily into the same category of mutual correspondence. And in fact this would, in continuation, perhaps give us the true clue to the two sets of Manus which the diagram of the
Bear stars at p. 247 seems helpfully to illustrate. K. O. Miiller,'' citing Hesiod {Op. and D. 619) said the Pleiades
were doubtless the Ship-stars (from TrXeti/, ifkew, to sail), because they ruled the navigation-time of the year. But TTXeta? is thus much better explained as a name of Ursa Minor, or Major, by which the Phosnicians and Greeks always sailed (see p. 819). The name of our Pleiades would then most suitably come from TrXeo?,

Both these derivations have always been given for Pleias or the Pleiades. For all these reasons, I maintain the Seven Krittikas to be Ursa Minor.
The foregoing easily expounds for us the presence of seven
priests in the Avestan sacrifices (i, 64 ; ii, 332), and also the seven
/td/is or parts of the great Ahurian Gatha or hymn.^ For this, too,
there is a parallel in the seven priests in Joshua vi, 4, and in the Rzg" Veda (iii, ly), where " Agni, who has seven ministering priests, shines eternally." And it must have been all this that led the Indo
Iranians—the race whose belief eventually differentiated into the
Vedic and the Avestan worships— to their seven worlds, which in Persia became the seven Karshvare, one of which is our Earth, which again, pursuing the conception farther, has seven climes., The seven ParsI heavens and their seven-fold God have no other
origin ; for celestial things had their terrestrial counterparts.^ Hence too sprang the conception of the seven Immortals who will come to help the Saviour Sayoshant in the final world-struggle with the powers of darkness {Z.A. ii, 212, 71, 220).

Thebes.
THE Seven gates of Thebes were connected by Nonnus (lib. 5,
Dionys.) with the seven " planets "
; but their names seem to
contradict this : Electrae, Proetidae, Neitae, Crenaeae, Hypsistae, Ogygiae, and Omoloides. It is unsatisfying to be told that one
is dedicated " to the Sun, under the appellation of Electra, a surname of Ph^ethon." Pausanias (ix, 17) should rather be followed, who says it was named from Electra, the sister of Cadmus (which takes us at once to the 7 Kabeiroi and the primeval gods) ; the other gates he makes Proetae ; Neita or Neida ; " Krene, from a
fountain "
; " Hypsiste, from its proximity to the temple of Zeus
hypsistos," that is " the highest," whom I claim for the polar divinity. The gate 'Omolois he thought the most recently named, and that of Ogygia the most ancient. Neita recalls the Egyptian Neith, and it must not be forgotten that Ogygia was one of Seven daughters, and that Electra, daughter of Atlas, was one of the Seven Pleiades, one of the Danaides, and one of the Oceanides. Ogygia is also simply the feminine of Ogygios, which meant "very ancient," Ogygios, Ogyges or Ogygos (of the deluge) was also said to have founded Thebes ; and I think it may turn out that Ogen and Okeanos have a close connection with Ogygios, which, in connection with the foundation of Thebes may be an adjectival epithet for the " very ancient " Kadmos. The primeval Kadmos built and dwelt in Kadmeid the citadel and nucleus of
Thebes that is (drj^ai, the plural of Syj/Si]} Thomas Taylor, who
translated Pausanias (1794 and 1824) said on this passage that "as Cadmus is the deity of the sublunary region, the city Thebes must be an image of the body of the sublunary world." This, however, does not recognize what I venture to assert as one of the axioms of heavens-myths, that infernal powers are always fallen gods, and " sublunary " is mere residuum, rubbish. K. O. Miiller,^ who thought the worship of the Kabeiroi must be referred to Thebes as its metropolis, dwelt upon the fact that the worship of the Cabiric goddesses was interwoven with Thebaic mythology ; and
' We must not, however, lose sight of " upper " and " lower," ' new "' and " old " in the names and situations of so many double towns. - MyihoL, ch. vii.

that Euripides said the SicovvfMoi 6eal, that is these Cabiric goddesses, founded Thebes, that Zeus bestowed the city on Koprj (curiously enough, as Miiller does not note, the eye-pupil) at the ceremony of unveiling, and that Kadmos dwelt in the temple of Demeter Th'esmophoros (Law-bearer). I should go back to the unfallen Kadmos, the Adam Qadmon, and boldly make the @rjl3a(, the 7 heavens with their 7 gates. How easy then become the 7 chiefs (our seven Rishis) who rise against Thebes and the Epigonoi their descendants. It is only another version of the war in heaven ; and I should be inclined to look for a common origin
of the plural w^ord Si]/3ac and the plural divine term Oeol (see p. 823). The fact of a great number of towns being called Thebes does not trip up, but rather helps on, this argument ; and as to the Egyptian many-gated 0r;/3at, as the Greeks named it, which was said to have been the model of the Bceotian town, the hieroglyphics do not, says Pierret,^ explain the word, for the Egyptian name was
? ^ Uas. Its origin was lost in the night of time, even in the
classic dates known to us. It was immense, including the ruins that we now know as Karnak, Luxor, Kurnah, the Ramesseum, the Colossi, and the temples of Medinet-Abu, Der-el-Bahari and Derel-Medineh and a vastly greater extent of country. Its enclosure was so vast that Homer gave it the indefinite number of 100 gates, whence its later name of HecatomPylos. Ptolemy and Pliny called it AtocrlloXt? and DiosPolis Magna, which is quite on the line of these considerations ; and it looks very much as if the Greeks naturally applied their own archaic term, and called Great Uas the €)i]l3ai, the Atoo-IToXt?, the God-city the ^ect-dwelling of the Egyptians. There is one curious fact that must have its due value
in the chapter on Cones (p. 922). It is only at Thebes that the tcrra-cotta cones called " funereal " have ever been discovered, and ancient Thebes must have been more ancient even than Memphis, which succeeded it as the king's capital. In Strabo's time it was
already a mass of ruins and temples, with villages between, for a
space of 80 stadia. This indicates a vast antiquity for the cones. The Thebans " in ancient times," said Pausanias, sacrificed
labouring oxen (v. triones), to Apollon Polios," which is rendered " the Hoary "
; but with the " seven labour-oxen " of Ursa Major
in view, Polios may more properl}' come fiom 7r6\o<;, the Universe pole and axis, the heavens. It was an ox with a white disk on

each side, goes on Pausanias, which led Kadmos to the site of Thebes, where it laid down. Pausanias maintained that Kadmos was a Phoenician [Adam-Qadmon as we now catalogue him], and not an Egyptian (deity, he might have added). In fact, many more of the Theban legends are clearly of the same first, central,
universal, supernal, class. Take that^ which put the stronghold of Kadmos, the Kadmeia, in the Agora (seep. 155 supra) of the Tower of Thebes. Here we have at once the heavens-palace with the
Tower-axis ; and in this palace, naturally, " they show the ruins of the bed-chambers of Harmonia and Semcle " (the wife and daughter of Kadmos ; the latter the mother of Dionusos). But they say, wrote Pausanias elsewhere (ix, 16), that the tem
ple of DeMeter the Lawbearer [thesmophoros—^ecr/Ao?, the Law,
a rite, a divine decree, quite naturally = ^eo? (like deaK€\o<;), + fi,o<i (that is the Latin ;;u?s), and it thus means "custom of the gods"] at Thebes was once the house of Kadmos and his posterity. The temple here darkly meant must be the heavens or the Universe, and thus we get the full signification of the Kadmeia. " Here, too,
there is a statue of ProNomos the piper, who first invented pipes adapted to every kind of harmony, and was the first that played all
the different measures at once on one sole pipe."^ Order is HesLvensJirst /azv, and this confest, it follows that FirstLaw is the proper rendering of ProNomos, the harmoniser, while the sole pipe of universal harmony is in another view the axis on which that universe harmoniously revolved. A third sense need not be deduced here. Amphion, by the sound of his lyre charming
the walls of Thebes into existence, is clearly a variation upon the major myth that the Universe was definitively organised by Zeus with the aid of Harmonia. The companions of Kadmos were devoured by a dragon the offspring, like Harmonia, of the male and female principles (Ares
and Aphrodite) — all of which is central and cosmic. The fall of Kadmos, who then became a serpent, is all in the part of supreme
beings and their vicissitudes. The Thebans have a building, further wrote Pausanias (ix, 16),
which is called the divining tower of Teiresias, and near it there is a temple of Fortune {rv^yf). I think we might discern in Teiresias

Thebes, and the inventor of auspices, a central heavens-god of divination. His tower then becomes the heavens-pillar. The Hyantes vanquished and driven from Thebes by Kadmos and his associates (Paus. x, 35) cannot, one may suppose, be separated from Hyas, son of Atlas, and the Hyades, his sons or brothers. The Aones were also inhabitants of the heavenly city, and Herakles, who was born at Thebes, was the Aonius vir and Bacchus was the Aonian god. Athamas, who was son of Aiolos the wind-god, and espoused I no the daughter of Kadmos, was evidently, from the legendary strange sacrifice of his descendants, when they could be trapped (like Amgiad and Assad of the Arabian Nights), to Zeus Laphystios (the ravenous or ahungered), a most archaic personage. The custom existed, or at all events was popularly believed to exist, down to the time of the scholiast upon Apollonius Rhodius.^
I would beg of the reader to refer to what has been said at p. 395 about Arcadia ; and I shall only here add as to another portion of legendary Greece, that Homer {Iliad, xvi, 233) makes Achilles pray to Zeus of Dodona as Pelasgian Zeus. Pelasgian, says Mr. A. Lang, may be regarded as equivalent to " pre-historic
Greek."- I would stretch the term pre-historic to the utmost. Bel or Belus, the demiurgus, the principle of light and life, dwelt beyond the seven spheres of the Chaldean cosmology. Beyond was an eighth sphere, the fixed ; and beyond that the
dwelling of the Universe-soul, at once light, fire and ether, which animated the upper and divine world, the intermediate world which is our own earth, and the lower or infernal realms. This, which is consonant with other theories, is the view of Proclus and Cedrenus.^ It is worthy of remark that Olympiodorus, in his commentary
on Plato's Alcibiades, gives Seven categories of deities : ovpdvioi,
aidepioi, TTVpLOi, aepLOi, evvSpioi, ')(66viOi and viroTdpratoL — celestial,

For God has said : We have created the seven heavens in seven folds, and seven earths in the same form, all out of light. The pelenk is put on and off seven times, with each time a different formula {ibid. p. 145). The Hamzavi or Melamiyun have seven Makamat or degrees, to each of which is given an Asma, or name of Allah (p. 181). And the statutes of nearly all the Dervish orders enjoin the frequent repetition during the day, of these seven Esami Ilahi, or names of Allah, which are (i) La ilaha ill' Allah, There is no god but
Allah. (2) Ya (=3 O !) Allah. (3) Ya Hu, O Him ! (4) Ya Hakk, O Just! (5) Ya Hai, O Living! (6) Ya Khayyum, O Existent (7) Ya Kahhar, O Revenger ! These are connected with the seb'a sima, seven heavens [sima also means dancing], and the seven
divine lights, Anwar ilahi.

WITH all this we must closely connect the sprinkling of
blood and oil seven times in Leviticus (iv, 6; xiv, 16, 51). The Jewish high-priest flung blood of the victim seven times against the Veil which separated the Holy from the Holy-of-holies. Then he spattered the blood with his finger seven times towards the
propitiatory of the Ark of the covenant.^ The seven daily praises in Psalm cxix, 164; the seven altars built by Balak for Balaam, and the seven oxen and seven rams sacrificed and burnt thereon (Numb, xxiii), and also the seven bullocks, seven rams, seven lambs and seven he-goats immolated in 2 Chronicles xxix ; the
seven steps in the vision of Ezekiel (xl, 22) ; the seven eyes upon
one stone, in Zechariah iii — another link with stone-worship—with a number of less important passages in Old Testament. The number of the churches in Revelations, and the seven Spirits of God, or seven Angels which stand before God (also typified as seven eyes, seven horns, seven lamps, or seven golden candlesticks)
must be referred to a similar celestial star-origin. Seven sacred lamps, a perpetual flame, a nocturnal fire, burn in;

vowels which hid the ineffable name.* The Seven-branched candlestick seems to exhibit clearly the seven lights of heaven. In some cases the triad seems indicated by its tripod. The following sketches are taken from the Revue

The Tree of Seven branches on the Babylonian seal representing
" the temptation of Adam and Eve, and the tree of life (British Museum) bears an obvious resemblance to the
candlestick and its tripod ; though the objects hanging
at each side of the trunk are, it would seem, fruits. I have to express my best thanks to Dr. Wallis Budge for the use of this picture from his Babylonian Life and
History, p. 156. Sir George Birdwood's chapter on the Eastern art-patterns formed of the knop, or fruit, and flower of the " Hom," which he takes to be the date-palm deserves the investigator's attention.'
The engraving he gives of the date-palm-" hom " from Rawlnson resembles the seven-branched candlestick. His remarks and engravings of another " hom" or soma, a Sarcostemma,^ are also
very valuable. Some independent remarks of Prof. Robertson Smith's (not met
with until the foregoing was written) seem to support me. " It is very noteworthy that the details of the capitals of the brazen pillars [Jachin and Boaz] arc those of candlesticks or cressets. They

seem to have been built on the model of altar-candlesticks on Phoenician monuments." " In most of the Assyrian examples it is not easy to draw the line between the candelabrum and the sacred
tree." " The Hebrew pillar-altars had also associations with the
^
sacred tree, as appears from their adornment of pomegranates ; but
so had the golden candlestick."^ As I seek to identify ivee-tntnk, pillar, and candlex/'/r/t', with the Universe-axis, these passages are very satisfactory to me ; and I would just throw out the suggestion that the unconsuming "burning bush" is metaphorically like the candlestick, and represents the lights of the night-heavens on the branch-tips of the Universe-tree.
I am unable to give a seven-rayed Abraxas, but the following specimen of the gnostic amulet engraved gem with fourteen (2 x 7) rays is extracted from Montfaucon's Antiquite
cxpliqiice (iv, 363). A Roman piece of
sculpture follows which Montfaucon (i,
118) calls the youthful Apollo as the Sun. If it be the Sun, the solar symbolism had then drawn to itself and absorbed the significance of the Seven
rays. Ciampini, in his Vetera Moiiii
metita (part i), says: " Publ. Victor in Colossosolis, quern Zenodorous Neroni dicavit, de quo PHn. (cap. xxiv, lib.
7) septennis caput ejus radiis coruscasse tradit." I know of no other explanation of a seven-rayed Sun
which approaches in sufficiency that which 1 have here suggested. We even find the central Universe-wheel, as well as the seven rays, appropriated
to the Sun — if it be the Sun — in the following design from an Etruscan sculpture, given in Didron's Icouographie Clircticnne (fig. 3IJ. I cannot imagine how the serious student can satisfy himself that such a combination of imagery can ever have begun in Sun-worship pure and simple. And we can track the decadent

idea on into debased mediaeval Christian symbolism. This Lamb is also from Didron (fig. 88), who took it from a 13th century manuscript of the Apocalypse in the Arsenal library in Paris. Here the rays have become horns ; the seven stars, which are also eyes in the Apocalypse, have become (as to six of them) actual and impos
sible eyes, reminding of the "seven eyes upon one stone," p. 955, and they appear again (as jewel ?) on the roof of what may be supposed by its basilica windows to be a church. This is doubtless some indication of the seven churches. It would be difficult to find a more clumsy, materialistic instance of the degradation of a once supreme astrological imagery.
King figures a " Gnostic gem " of green jasper with what " may have been the figure of the Old Man, whose worship is so strongly
insisted on in the articles of accusation
brought against the Templars " ;^ and he gives another of " the Old Man, or Osiris," which is " a terminal figure," and clearly has the seven stars of Ursa Major in the field. I know not why it is said to be Osiris. The terminal figure connects the deity with rtah and the Axis. I add the Seven stars from another such
"gem"— a large bright loadstone—in order to
show, if I can, that the stars of Ursa Major are always mtended, although Mr. King calls them 'the seven planets" (p. 211). There is yet another, of porphyry, where Mr. King remarks
" the seven stars " (p. 223).

Upon this subject generally he makes the following comment (p. 62). " The Seven stars so common upon these gems probably have more than a mere allusion to the planets, and may denote the seven Amshaspands." Capt. Conder mentions the Seven black stones at Uruk which typified the seven chief gods, the mystic Kabirim, the Great Ones;^ and Moslem writers say there were round the pre-Mahometic shrine at Mecca, where the holy black stone still subsists, seven stones on which human sacrifices were offered. These may have been the very seven Arabian stones of Herodotus (iii, 8). Decharme^ published a cameo in which Dionysos is represented as a bull with the " three Graces " standing on his neck, and 7 stars
in the sky, which he decides to be the Pleiades. Such an inter
pretation carries no conviction with it.
In the SatapatJia Bnihmana^ the Krittikas or Pleiades (?) were the wives of the Bears, the Rikshas, and the Brahmanic Rishis were originally called the Rikshas. But the wives were separated from their husbands and rise in the East, whereas the bears rise in the North. This latter portion of the tale seems to me to have arisen in northern latitudes where the Great Bear never sets, while the Pleiades of course do. The Rishis thus remain in the supernfd
heavens while the Pleiades set into the infernal regions. The Seven sons that 1 1 (Kronos) had by Amma (Rhea), and _/ his seven daughters by Ashtharth (Astarte),^ would seem to be the Seven dual deities of Ursa Major, male and female. The -^ Babylonian Cannes or Annos was one of Seven. In the Rig Veda, Agni, undoubtedly a central deity, is "sevenrayed," which may here (ii, 80) mean seven-spoked. Indra is also "the seven-rayed, who let loose the seven rivers to flow" (ii, 238).
A deity standing on a lion, and surrounded by seven stars, is found on Assyrian seals.^ This heptarchal heavenly significance of the Number was mystically shown forth in the legendary Seven-ringed cup of the

Persian hero Jemshid which " Omar " Fitzgerald^ said was "typical of the Seven heavens, Seven planets, Seven seas, &c." He
did not go as far back as the Seven stars. Twashtri's goblet in the Rig Veda is of course Jemshid's cup. It would almost seem as if Browning's studies of the past had
initiated him into the exalted mysteries of this great constellation and its connection with the Polar :
But I had so near made out the sun, And counted your stars, the Seven and One.
It would require not a whole treatise alone, but a small library, to discriminate, catalogue, classify, comment upon and exhaust the myriad reappearances of the number Seven, whether in religions,
legends, the cabal, folk-lore, or every-day life. The task might even be safely pronounced impossible. I have even seen it stated'^ that the name of the world-famous engineer de Lesseps would seem to have been originally Les Septs ; the registers of the parliament of Bordeaux mentioning (15th April, 1523) a merchant of that town named Jean de Septs. All that has been attempted here is to assign an ultimate origin to the mystic position of the number, to wake once more, as it were, the famous Seven Sleepers of the Pole. [The reader is recommended, before going further, to glance
at " The Seven Kabeiroi," p. 812.]

The Seven Sleepers.
LA YARD in his Nineveh and Babylon (p. 206) says: "At the
^ entrance of one of the deep ravines, which runs into the Gebel Makloub, a clear spring gushes from a grotto in the hillside. This is the cave of the Seven Sleepers and their Dog, and the
Yezidis have made the spot a ziareh or place of pilgrimage . . .
There is scarcely a district without the original cave in which the
youths were concealed during their miraculous slumber ; " and he
states elsewhere (p. 94) that these same Yezidis still bury with the corpse's face to the North star. The Seven Sleepers are now to be presumed to have been the stars of Ursa Major, and their sleep must have been a day-sleep, from their setting to their rising, or from disappearance to reappearance. The dog I have elsewhere endeavoured to connect with the Pole.
The Longobardian chronicler Paulus Diaconus, who was born
circa 723, relates (i, 4) a Teutonic version of the legend, which he said " is on the lips of everybody." The cave in which the Seven have been sleeping no one knows how long is, he said, in the remotest western boundaries of Germany, under a high rock, near the sea-strand. They are in the deepest sleep and uninfluenced by time, not only as to their bodies but also as to their garments. When a man from curiosity tried to undress one of them, his arm at once withered, and no one has since dared to touch them. In their vicinity dwell the Skrid-Finns. There, too, where the boundhss Ocean extends, is found the unfathomably deep eddy which we traditionally call the navel of the sea. The word " Western " is
clearly a corrupt tradition for northern. "Traces of the legend reappear in Saxo Grammaticus, in Adam of Bremen, in Nonse and German popular belief, and in Vcluspa," says Rydberg's Teutonic
Mythology (1889, p. 484).



Seven.'] The Seven Chnrches. 96
The Seven Churches.
PETRIE^ in his famous Essay on Irish Architecture, mentions
the "groups of seven small churches, such as are usually found at celebrated religious establishments in Ireland" ; but he does not endeavour to account for them. I think I have here made out at all events a prima facie case for connecting them ultimately with the seven Rishis of Ursa Major, while the " round tower " that accompanies the churches represents the Earth-axis, and its summit the seat of the Polar deity, near by the seven bright,
all-ruling, all-beneficent ones. Rabbi Simeon (on Jer. vii) says that the image of Moloch outside Jerusalem had the head of an ox, and was hollow within ; and there were seven chapels raised, before which the idol was erected.- Probably the most ancient example of the " seven churches" now subsisting is that to be found in Malta near the village of Casat Crendi where the plan of the Hagiar Kim (stones of worship) present a series of seven ellipsoid chambers built next one another, like the Giganteja of Gozo (Gaulos), which is presumed to represent the Phoenician temples erected 400 B.C. to Sadambaal and Ashtoreth. The larger of these is 119 feet by
75, and a conical idol-stone was found there.^ Chaldea seems to have invented the zikkurat or tower in stages with a winding slope all round outside for stairs (see p. 443). The most famous of these is of course Nebuchadnezzar's Tower of the Seven Lights at Babylon. The zikkurat of Khorsabad is supposed to have also had seven stiges of different colours. The lowest was white, as proved by the French excavators ; the second, black ; the third, a reddish purple ; the next blue ; while fragments of enamelfaced bricks show that the 3 other colours were vermilion, silver
grey, and gold.* In Amos (viii, 14) there is an oath of Beersheba, and tl e sanctuary of Beersheba properly consisted of the Seven Wells which gave the place its name. It is notable that among the

Semites a special sanctity was attached to groups of seven wells.
Christian Syrians bewailed their diseases to the stars, or turned for
help to a solitary tree, or a fountain, or seven springs, or water of the sea. Among the Mandseans (Subbas) we read of mysteries performed at seven wells, and among the Arabs a place called Seven Wells is mentioned by Strabo. The name of the Asbamsan waters seems also to mean Seven waters (Syriac : shaba
maya). There were seven marvellous wells at Tiberias. The Hebrew verb "to swear" means literally "to come under the
influence of seven things," and the oath of purgation at seven
wells would have peculiar force.^
" The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand . . . the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches,
and the seven candlesticks are seven churches." (Rev. i, 20.) Herodotus (iii, 8) speaks of the Syrian Arabs letting blood in the
palms of the hands, and smearing seven stones with it. A victim's, a substitute's, a ransomer's blood was later ingeniously employed, and later still wine made from fruits, and even water, economically replaced the blood, while the seven stones of Herodotus were, as Professor W. Robertson Smith has pointed out,- sacred stones ; and were " B^etylia, Bethels, god-boxes," the holy stones pregnant
with divinity, treated of (p. 113). This second rapprochement between the religious practices of early pagan Arabia and ancient Ireland is noteworthy, and the two taken together are even striking. I am bound, too, to mention the seven-fold circuit made at Arabian shrines by the Edomite women at their unclean feasts round an
image of Beltis, or Aphrodite, on the summit of a Palestinian Mountain.^^ It should be noted also that in Catholic countries and
churches the fourteen " stations of the cross " consist of a circuitous devout exercise at seven "stations" forward and seven backward.
It may be that this pious Christian practice—chiefly performed
by women —ousted a prior religious pagan observance. The fourteen (2 X 7) pieces of the mutilated body of Osiris are doubtless a very archaic outcome of the mystical application of the heavenly number. In the pageant of the feast of the sacred bark of Osiris
described by Plutarch each morsel of the body was found at a fire
lighted on the banks of the Nile near Memphis.

A clear parallel to the mutilation of Osiris (As-Ra or Uasri) is to be found in the killing and disjointing of Medea's brother
Absyrtus i^K-^vpTo<i) by Medea and lason, and the scattering of
the limbs to delay his father Eetes ('Herr/?), the aetherial, in his
pursuit.
And if there were seven great Northern deities, seven Rishis, seven Amesha-Spentas, seven heavens^ [Prof Rhys quotes (from " Skein," ii, 199) the Welsh verse : " Seith seren yssyd. | O Seith
nawn dofyd. | Seon sywedyd. | A wyr eu defnyd— Seven Stars
are there | Of the seven gifts of the lord ; | Seon the philosopher,
|
He knows their nature.^ I have elsewhere tried to identify the Seven Maini with these stars], seven churches, and seven priests,
why not seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, seven sacraments, and —for the divine has always its diabolical counterpart in Eastern faiths seven devils and seven deadly sins, which last the dramatist Middleton, half jest, whole earnest, called " the seven Wise Masters of the World. "^ The book with that favourite mediaeval title had an Oriental origin, and was probably introduced into Europe during
the Crusades, as the Latin version of 11 84 would seem to indicate. The diabolical counterpart might be urged again in the Rabbinical Sheol, with its seven abodes, each of which has seven rivers of fire, seven rivers of hail, and seven of rankest poison. In each abode
there are also 7,000 caverns, each cavern has 7,000 clefts, each cleft has 7,000 scorpions, each scorpion has seven limbs, and each limb
1,000 barrels of gall (making 7,000 barrels to each scorpion).'*
A reflexion of all this is found in the Mexican land of Cibola, Seven-towns or Seven-realms, with its 70 burghs divided into seven provinces, their myth of the seven serpents, and their Chicomoztoc
or seven caverns.*

The Week.
'^T^HE extreme veneration in which the great Northern constel
I lation was once held must also be the ultimate source, the remotest origin now imaginable by us, for the succession of seven days which forms our week, and which is found all over the world, with one of the seven kept holy. Every seventh day of the Babylonians was a " day of rest for the heart. "^ Ahura Mazda, the supreme god of Zoroastrianism, was once, clearly, one of the seven Amesha-spentas. The first seven days of the Pars! month are each
sacred to, and are called after, one of these Spirits ; and the first, eighth, 15th and 23rd days of the month are sacred to Ahura Mazda, whom we have generally called Ormazd.^ This seems to me a very remarkable fact in support of my present contention. When Sun (and planet) worship had overcome the cult of the
Polar deity and the older sacred astrology, then the days took new names, like as they did in the French Revolutionary Calendar,
with its Primidi, Duodi, Tridi, and so forth.^ But it may perhaps turn out, on fuller investigation than the subject has yet had, that Sun-worship has had less influence upon the past of Zoroastrianism,
or ParsTism, than on that of the other great faiths. I might here
lean upon the fact that the planets, because of their erratic appai-ent motions, were looked upon as Ahrimanic* So also shooting or "worm" stars were evil, and were in fact i\\e pairikas or Peris, " nymphs of a fair but erring race," who were always going about
playing mischief with heroes, and seducing to idolatry.^ Abu'l Faradj has a legend that when the good Northern god drove out the bad one to the South, the latter began to create a world for himself He had already got far on in making a constellation in
^ Budge: Babyl. Life and Hist., 107, 153. - Dr. W. Geiger : Ci7)ilisatio)i of the Eastern Iranians, 1885, i, I46. ' Other illustrations might easily be given. Take for instance the Christian almanacks wifh their saints' days, and contrast them with the names of each day of the month in
the ParsI calendar (Dr. W. Geiger, ut supra), or—a still more striking parallel — with the 360-1- 5 minor divinities or abstractions that rule the days of the year among the Subliahs (or Sabeans) of the lower Euphrates (Siouffi : La Religion des Scubhas ; Imprimerie Nationale, i8?o, p. 38).

the Southern Sphere similar to Ursa Major (six stars in Sagittarius) when the angels succeeded in making peace between the rival deities. Tliere is a distinct Ahrimanic ring in this legend, and it serves to show the ancient supreme sanctity of the Great Bear. There was no seven-day period in Egypt, where all we hear of the Khepesh or Great Bear is to be found at p. 945. Their period
was a decade, like that of the French Revolutionitcs.

The SCibbas or Mandaites of the lower Euphrates have, like the Persians, a seven-day week which they call hafta. The chief day is called after one of their 360 supernal powers, Hevshabbo, who
seems to be a god-the- Father. The next four days are called his
second, third, &c., days ; but the fifth day is also sacred to HivelZivo, another of the 360 powers of the vague year, who seems to be a god-the-Son. The name of the sixth day is tlrufto, of which I can find no explanation ; and the seventh is called Shafto or

" The termination -da means dayl' says Major A. B. Ellis, from whom I quotc^ ; but he has been good enough, in answer to an inquiry of mine, to add that " the word eda or da is derived from
the verb da, to sleep. The week is called n'ehsum, "it is seven,"
and another is da-peii, " set of das or sleeps. Da is used to express
the period of twenty-four hours. The word used for day, in contra
distinction to night, is ehwia, sun." But the foregoing extract is made chiefly because of a strange
remark of Major Ellis's. He says : " A recent fable, seemingly
invented to account for existing facts, ascribes the length of the week amongst the Tshi-speaking tribes to the seven stars in the constellation of the Great Bear. This fable however is clearly of European design, and it is as inadequate to account for the week of
seven days as are other fables of similar character which are in
vogue amongst other peoples." Major Ellis kindly informs me that his reason for discrediting this " fable " is that he met with it in only one sea-coast town on the Gold Coast. "Hence I infer that it has been recently imported" [but whence?] "and has not yet had time to spread. Hence too I
conclude that it is of European origin " [but where is it found in Europe ?]. The only other mention of the number Seven that is traced in this book is the customary sacrifice of seven men and seven women,
fourteen victims in all, to the Ashanti chief god Tando (p. 32). The King, too, sits at Kumassi under a Kum-tree on the N. side of the market-place, whence the name of the town ; assi meaning

The Maini, Manus, and Rishis.
PROF. RHYS^ refers the Irish word for week sechtmain (Latin
scptimana) to the Secht Maini or Seven called Maine or
Mane. Tiioujh this week was of Seven by its name, still it seems to have been reckoned (as in Wales) by eight Jtigkts ; and there
were Eight, that is 7 plus i, Maini. These were 8. The AH- container, Maine cotageib Ule. Maine Mathremail (Motherlike). „ Athremail (fatherlike).
„ Morgor (very-dutiful).

,, Mo epert (greater than his name?) „ Milscothach (Honey-bloomed). „ Andoe (?) With this before us, I think we must be prepared to refer scptimana to the original conception of the Dii Manii, and of Mania the mother of the Lares. The souls of the justified dead becoming
manes would thus be—and with propriety— a secondary acceptation of the term, which may also have to be detected in uianco and our own word main, which is referred to the root niagJi, power-possess
ing. We should thus (see pp. 148-9) connect Mania and Maia with the Polcstar. The Irish Maini would thus, I suggest, have been
the Seven of Ursa Major. This supposition bears the test of the t/Z/onians dwelling in \Lniain ; for Ultonian is a word exactly reproducing the Chinese idea of Tai Ki, the Great Extreme or Ultimate, that is the Polar deity. The battles with the Ultonians are a War-in-heaven ; and the northern name Ulster is only one of the myriad instances of heavens-names being duplicated in terrestrial spots. Another test of the supposition is given by na Tri Finn-Emna, the Three Whites
of Emain, the three Ultonians, the three Welsh Gwens, which is simply the great Northern triad which so often occupies us throughout this Inquiry ; for Wh.ite and Bright are the same in Star-worship (see Index). Again, the HyMany thus fall into their places as the star-hosts of the heavens ; and their progenitor Maine M6r,= tiie

Great Maine, is Maine cotageib Ule, the All-container, the Lord of Sabaoth, the Polar deity. There need be no doubt that these Irish Maini must be equated with the Seven Indian Manus whose reigns are the Manwantaras,
endless periods of 4,320,000 years each. There seems to be no doubt either that the 7 (or 2x7) Manus, the 7 Rishis and the 7 Prajapatis, were originally a single sevenfold conception. The Seven Manus are Svvayambhu-z'c? (/>., son of Swayambhu = Self-existing= Brahma), five more (see Table) and Vaivaswata (=:Satya-vrata) the Manu of the present age. These Seven are even duplicated by other seven Manus whose names are obviously manufactured (see Table ; and see also what is said about
this duplication of the Manus and the Bears at p. 948). Another genealogy makes Swayambhuva the producer of the 7 Manus, but he is really the first of them, and thus answers to the Irish Maine Mor, as Prajapati would to Maine cotageib Ule. There are
also the 7 Krittikas wedded to the 7 Rishis. This gives us a triad
or a quintette of sevens, according as we look at it :
I. Seven Praji-patis (all fathers).
2. Seven Manus (Intelligences). Seven other Manus. "4. Seven Rishis wedded to 5. Seven Krittikas ; and all these must originally have been one Seven, springing from One. Manu being Thought, Mind, Intelligence, a comparison is particularly requested with what the Avesta says of the Seven Amesha-Spentas or Amshaspands, that they are all of one thought and one mind.

The Week {resumed).
THE current French conception of " huit jours," is not by any
means our week. In a careful calculation for a duel " trois semaines, c'est a dire vingt-quatre jours " after date, Dumas' wrote :
"nous sommcs le 29 du mois d'aout. Au 21 done du mois de septcmbre." In this year of grace 1890 we English would reckon three weeks from Friday, 29th of August, to be complete on Thurs
day, 18th of September ; and the rendezvous would be on Friday, 19th. In reckoning up weeks, our popular custom is : " Friday and Friday, eight ; and Friday, 15 ; and Friday, 22" (days) ; that is to say, one day more than thrice-seven, in order to bring-round the
same weekday. Dumas's trois semaines, however, would take him
to a Monday (the 22nd) ; which is neither three weeks, nor our
view of trois semaines, but 24 actual clear days. Englishmen about to have duels with Frenchmen, please note.
The " stars " which took up the running when Sun-worship was distancing the exhausted Polar-star worship, were, it is to be con
cluded, the Sun, Moon, and the five planets then observed Jupiter, Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Mercury, as the day-names of the ancient Egyptian, Buddhist, and Latin week at all events seem to show.
The modern Japanese innovated week calls the days after the
Sun, Moon, fire, water, wood, metal and earth ; which are simply the old five Chinese "elements," to which answer the planets Mars,
Mercury, Jupiter, Venus and Saturn, plus the Sun and Moon! Johannes Laurentius of Lydia^ says that the number Seven, as
well as his planet, was sacred to Saturn the god of time ; that is
Kronos, whom I have identified here with the central polar deity.
Lydus here occultly and unwittingly recognises what I advance, without offering any opposition.
Other peoples put differing names to their days certainly, but it is worthy of notice that the Icelandic Bible translates Hermes (Mercury) by Odin, and Zeus (Jupiter) by Thor in Acts xiv, \2^
which at once connects the names of our Wednesday and Thursday with those of the Latin dies Mercurii and dies Jovis. The subject

might be pursued indefinitely, and it might be shown as to Tuesday how the Scythian god of battles Tiv became Tiu to the North-Germans and Zio to those of the South, and thus how dies
Martis got to be translated Tiusdag and Ziesdag—in Alsace
Zischdi' (the German Dienstag (which is like the Latin Dies-^\\.Q.x) was formerly Ziestag ; in old Norse Tigsdagr and Tigrsdagr) ; and as to Friday how Freyia was the goddess of love, which identifies that day with the dies Veneris of the Romans, whose designations are still oddly kept up in our parliamentary papers.
It is obvious on the surface that the names of the Hindu days of the week had a far more remote significance than that of mere planet-names, to which purpose they must have been diverted at a comparatively late period. Such are Aditya, or Surya, Soma, Mangala, Buddha, Vrihaspati, Sukra, Usana and Sani,^ which last
has been conjectured to be the origin of the French word Samedi. It is impossible to make a comparative study of the texts of the Rig Veda which apply to Surya without perceiving that he can
never have been originally a Sun-god. Both Creuzer and Sir
M. Williams recognise the fact that he was Aditya and Mitra, like Varuna ; and Creuzer says he seems up to a certain point to be
confused with both Indra and Kuvera.'^ When we see him with four arms that hold the wheel, the blade, the lotus and the sceptre, in a car drawn by seven coursers, in the centre of the zodiac, that is
in the Polar North, the conclusion that he was a central supernal
deity seems to me to be irresistible. A similar observation, of course, applies to the Latin and
Teutonic names of several of the days. In fact to explain the daynames of the week as having no more remote origin than the corresponding names of certain " planets " is, in kind, as though one were to build some analogous argument upon the quite modern similar names of other planets, such as Uranus, given about 1781, Neptune (1846), and even the satellity of Mars: Phobos and Deimos (iS//).* And let us not forget that the planet Mars was of a surety sacred both to Hercules and to Mars,^ and that the god

The South.
'T^HE South. The subject of the North, it.s symboh'.sm, and its significance in myth, would be but half dealt with if the South were left out of sight. The nine days' fall of Hesiod's
brazen anvil from heaven to earth, from earth to Tartaros, gives us
a convenient illustration of the importance of the South-pole
legends as a corollary to those of the North. Plato's chasms^ had ways leading heavenward and helhvard. Homer's Tartaros is as far below Hades as earth is from heaven.- The Hindu Su Meru, the heaven-^Mountain, has its pendant the infernal, bad, fatal Ku Meru. The Chaldeans had a similar belief, and the twelve
southern of their twenty-four extra- zodiacal constellations had
dominion over the dead. Asmodeus fled to the South, the right hand, when exorcised by the angel ; Ahriman forced a passage through the earth and the wicked fell headforemost, so as to be upside-down in the Southern hell. The Avestan J\lt. Damavand, to which the fallen serpent-god Azhi Dahaka or Zohak was chained, is at the extreme South of Mazana or Mazandaran, the infernal regions.^ Abu'l Faradj said that in the combat between the good god and the bad, the good conquered, and drove the demon to the sides of the South, where he began to create a world and dominion for himself. He had already got as far as the

resemble in miniature the Northern Bushel, the Dipper, Ursa
Major—when the angels interfered and made peace between the two gods. In Hinduism Yamapura, the abode of Yama, is in the Southern quarter in the lower world, whence the wicked are driven
still further down to the hells. South is downwards, adharat.^ In the oldest hymns of the Rig Veda are deep abysses of inextricable darkness into which the wicked are plunged.- In the Assyrian conception the land of the dead extends under the foundations of
the earth, and beneath the abyss that receives all the waters of the
globe.^ Our own familiar phrase, " infernal regions," enwraps all
this. The Jewish Scheol, the hollow, the place dug out, the pit,
was dark and lifeless in the depths of the earth. All things in
Scheol, including its rephaim, its manes, are negative, opposite ;
just as " he who is entire death," Ahriman, was in every respect the counterpart of Ahura Mazda ; and the conception was also Chaldean and Phoenician. The Karens of Burmah still oddly illustrate the antipodean belief as to the dead. When a body is
taken to the grave, four pieces of bamboo are thrown —one to the West, saying " that is the East "
; another to the East, with the words " that is the West "
; a third is flung up, saying " that is the
foot of the Tree " ; and the fourth down, with " that is the top of the Tree."'* This reversal of the rliumbs in the Southern hemisphere
is an idea not ordinarily present in our minds. The Arcadians, too, smote the ground with rods while they called on " the folk below the Earth. "^ In the Mahabharata we meet with such a phrase as " before thou art carried away dead by the royal command of
Yama ; before the four quarters of the sky \<\\\\\ round,"*"' and in
the Surya Siddhanta (xii, 55) the stars revolve to the right for the
gods, and to the left for their enemies ; the inhabitants of hell see
the gods in heaven with their heads inverted.'' A Hindu's relatives walk five (?) times round the pile that holds his cremated ashes ; but they do so the reverse way to the usual perambulations'* ; that
is, they keep their left shoulder to the centre, and walk " right
shoulder forward," or " left wheel." This seems to be in accordance with all that is being- shown here as to the Underworld.

As the Egyptian earth at the North rose till it touched heaven, so at the farthest southern extremity of the earth was another Mountain of incredible height, Apento, or Tapento or ap
ta \j the horn of the world. ^ In the late Dr. Birch's Book of
the Dead, the Egyptian land of the gods of the South, of the dead, Amenti, is the "inverted precinct"; Tiele calls it the reversed world.^ The manuscripts of the Book of the Lower Hemisphere found in the Egyptian tombs are, said Deveria, almost all retro
grade, and certain illustrations depict the dead and a Mountain
upside-down,^ while the dead, attaining the second life, exultingly say in the ritual " I do not [any longer] walk upon my head." The Maori have a similar legend. In one Egyptian funeral papyrus Anubis says to the dead : " go out towards the lower heaven "
; and it represents the great serpent as " the lord of the lower and mysterious heaven."* The twelve constellations of the Chaldeans already noticed are found again in the division of this Egyptian funereal book into as many horary sections, and thus the dead cultivate twelve Elysian fields. These under-fields begin at the extremity of the Western region, which touches the absolute obscurity of the lower hemisphere ; for sunset was dying, day was life, and night was death.'^ (Ahriman's kingdom, too, is night and darkness.) This Egyptian underworld is clearly the abyss (Tiefe) under the Earth, which Brugsch called the hole of the Persea-tree.^
It is quite possible to regard Egyptian religion in this wise. They believed in the immortality of the divine element in Man,
indicated by the divine bird, the hawk, with a human head, 'i\
the ba. This belief and its symbol must clearly at first, by the
nature of the case, have referred to the upper air, the heavens
wherei.i the hawk soars. But the affections followed the dead (and his ba) more naturally, immediately and materially into the
tomb, into the underworld below the tomb ; and so the ^^ symbol
made its appearance in the world of Amenti, the lower, hidden, hemisphere. All the supernal gods followed, and peopled Amenti
as—when their functions are boldly regarded— as mere attendants

upon the ba. [Here we are leaving out of sight, for the moment,
both the ka I j and the Khou (another but a more terrestrial bird,
the ibis) ^^^ 1. It must be remembered that this underworld
of the supernal gods is by no means the torment-hell of the second
death of the doubly dead and damned, that lay lower, at the extreme bottom, the South pole. Out of this Amcnti, and with the furtherance of the hard working gods, took place the resurrection of the ba, whether to new bodily life or not. A necessary consequence of all this was the vast and intricate system (and want of system), which is to be observed in funereal
talismanic decoration. But for all that the ancient Cosmic gods were never forgotten ; on the contrary they ever held their mystic
sanctity, their supreme positions, and the ^ss? , the Q , the ^ ,
the :^ , the ^ , the ^^ (jackal), and others not alone held the
field at the summit of every monument, of every composition, but were worn universally as amulets. These were the oldest gods of Egypt, the gods of highest heaven and oldest Cosmos, and the newer gods'chicfly furnished the world of Amenti, to which however some of the most primeval also descended, for example Ptah and Anepu, Nut and Hathor. The Christian conception of hell is rather in the way in considering the Egyptian underworld. They had a hetl too ; and in the texts which expatiate on the lower hemisphere ® ^-^ an
important chapter is devoted to the punishments of the impious Decapitations, abysses of fire tended by lion-headed female executioners. The victims, the damned, are " dead for the second time, and will never more see those who live on earth, never " ; whereas all the other dead who died in Osiris looked forward to being born
again. (Pierret : Diet. 207.) That this hell was placed at the extreme South of the Uni
verse may, I think, be concluded from the fact that its goddess
was the lion-headed Sekhet, y , and that the expression suten
net 4\^ meant dominion over the North and the South— the
Indian Chakravartin or Universal Emperor. The other facts about Sekhet, that she was the "greatly beloved of Ptah," and that their son Nefcr-Tum was " lord of the East," require following up. They seem to mean that, North and South being
masculine and feminine, the female South, by reason of its fidelity



SoiUli?^ The South. 981
to the North, is called his best lover, and as they turn (or as upon them turns) the Universe, they have produced the East which con
stantly comes up or forth by their common propulsion of the revolving heavens.
The " devourt'j\y of hell " is seen in a funereal ritual of the
sixth century B.C. (which is a quite modern date) as a monstr^j-j manufactured out of the lion, the hippopotamus and the crocodile, couched at the feet of Osiris, ready to fall upon those who are
condemned to the everlasting second death. On a coffin of
Sutimes hell is divided into nine zones and lion-headed goddesses
are the furies of this Tartaros.^
I presume we must discern in the " pit " of the Rig Vec/a, the
regions below the earth, the pdtdla of the Puranas. The following are the Vedic passages I have in view : " Annihilate the might of
the malignant ; hurl them into the vile pit, the vast and vile pit "
(ii, 44). " Wherever the enemies have congregated, they have been slain and utterly destroyed ; they sleep in a deep pit (vailasthanam aseram)," (ii, 43).
The corresponding Japanese ideas are that there is a " region of Yomi or Yomo," of gloom, a word which is conjectured to contain
the same root as yoru, night ; but a Japanese literate has thrown out the suggestion, by no means to be despised, that Yomi may be connected with the Sanskrit Yama, in which case it would have come in, late, wuth Buddhism. Yami means total-darkness in
archaic Japanese. This region is also called the under, the root, the deepest region.^ Motowori, one of the modern commentators,
defines it as an underworld, the habitation of the dead, the land
whither, when they die, go all men, noble or mean, virtuous or wicked.'' " I wish to be gone," says one of the gods in the Kojiki,
" to my dead mother's land, to the nethermost of lands " (ne no
katasu-kuni) ;^ and the best modern Shinto native treatises, such
as Hatori's Sandaiko ( 1 79 1 ) and Hirata's Tama no Alihashira ( 1 8 1 3)
represent by diagrams heaven, earth, and Yomi as three circles or
globes of diminishing size, united by necks, as it were ; heaven, the largest, being uppermost, and Yomi, the smallest, being below the other two.-* These diagrams leave no doubt as to the theory of these revivalists of the Shinto mythology. The Japanese also call

Yomi the "Unseen Realm," which appears to be a mere plagiarism from the Unseen Darkness and Unseen Realm of the Chinese.^ The dwelling of the Scandinavian Hel, or Death, is sombre and gloomy, in dark Niflheim, the home of mist in the frozen underworld,^ and the Parsi abode of the condemned is opposite
paradise (and ought therefore to be at the South Pole). There is endless darkness, the dark horrid world made of darkness, the offspring of darkness" ; reminding us of the New Testament outer darkness, power of darkness, and blackness of darkness for ever.*
But both the Parsi and the Scandinavian hells, though infernal, are placed in the North, which is quite counter to the mass of evidence
here collected, and is besides inconsistent with itself In Norse mythology it is to the North of, although below, the earth ; while
the foggy Ni'flhel is still farther North, though still lower down.
These positions seem in themselves to be contradictory. The
foul-scented wind of the Parsi " burrow of the druj," of the demon of death, comes from the North ; the burrow lies in the North, in cold, like the frozen underworld of the Scandinavians. The only solution that can be offered to the contradiction in terms which these passages evince is that already suggested as to the
conversion of originally sacred, into cursed quarters, under the
influence of a complete change of faith. (On the subject of the South and the North Poles, Dr. Warren's Paradise Found contains a quantity of valuable matter.)

South.. Sisyphus and TaiitaliLS. 98,
Sisyphus and Tantalus.
IT is deserving of notice that if Sisyphus be considered as god
of the under hemisphere, some incidents in his myth explain themselves tout sen/. For instance : liis chaining of Death until she was dehvered by Ares at the prayer of Plouton. Hesiod put Death in Tartaros, Virgil before the gates of the hells ; Hercules also chained her up there with adamantine bonds. This chainingup of Death is continued in the legends of le Bonhomme Misere. Sisuphos according to Homer was a lover and promoter of peace, that is of the peace of the underworld, of the grave. He was also the wisest and most prudent of monarchs. Sisyphus is called by
Horace {Sat. ii, 3, 21) vafer, astute, adroit, skilful, intelligent; vafer
being an odd word requiring study. Cicero talks {Tjisc. 1, 41, 98) of Ulixi Sysiphique prudentia. There were the labores of Sisyphus
Sisyphus in terris quo non astutior alter
{Properttiis ii, 17, 7, and 20, 32) ; the brain, cervix, of Sisyphus
(Seneca : Here. CEt, 942) ; the Sisypheum mare. Corinth (see p. 667) was the Sisyphius portus (= gate of heaven?) (Statius, Theb. ii, 380). Sisyphus was the true father of Ulysses. Sisypheia vincla was the phrase for the union of Si-syphus and
Merope (Avienus, Arat. 597). And finally Antony's dwarf was surnamcd Sisyphus (Schol. on Horace, Sat. i, 3, 47) because of
his cunning. Here is a patent connection of Sisuphos with Kronos, whom we perpetually see as Wily in the course of this Liquiry. The poets were unanimous in putting Sisyphus into the hells, but as a con
demned offender—that is, according to the theories here urged, a fallen god. His condemned punishment too is to roll for ever a great rock to the summit of a mountain whence it falls back by its own weight, and he has to recommence without rest. Now this metaphorical way of describing the labour does admit of rest in the
intervals while the stone is falling ; therefore the figure of speech is
faulty. The true task is the perpetual rolling up (at the E.) of the
under-heavens, while the rolling down (at the W.) is equal and simultaneous, the under hemisphere remaining always intact.
Here the initial contlition of eternal unrest is fulfilled. Tl'.is
VOL. II. 2D



984 The Night of the Gods. [The
punishment was fitted to the crime of reveahng the secrets of
the gods, whence the fall of Sisuphos. Tantalos, whose punishment has some mechanical resemblance
to that of Sisuphos, also revealed the secrets of the gods, and was also cast down. The legends about him are endless and divergent if not conflicting. At all events he is connected with the sacred practice of sacrificial cannibalism which makes him a god of the highest rank. Lucian, in jest or earnest, makes him the stealer of
the dog of Zeus, also a supernal central animal. In his punishments the surface of the water in which he is plunged up to the mouth ever flows away (downwards?) from that orifice; or the tree-fruits he wants to gather are rapt upwards from his hands and off the tree into the clouds. But Euripides, Pindar, Plato and Cicero {Q. Tiisc. c. 16) bring the fate of Tantalos very near to that of Sisuphos ; putting him underneath a rock which is perpetually about to fall over upon his head. Mackensie's Travels (of 1789, 1792 and 1793) gave an account of the Tantalos myth as it existed among the Chippeway Indians, so far as the water and the fruits in
the next world are concerned.

TT may be questioned why Irish and far-Eastern (Japanese)
matters are more than once in the course of this Inquiry com

pillars (Glcndalough), in the earliest MSS., and on the Icathei binding of the celebrated Book of Armagh (pp. 253, 322, 328). He surmised that it " may possibly be symbolic of the Trinity."

Le Japoii Illustrc ({, 393), and shade it the reverse way in order the better to bring out its wonderful Hkeness to the Book of Armagh. The only thing observable, and it is important, being that the three commas or tadpoles
go the reverse way in Ireland to the Japanese fashion. Major A. P. di Cesnola^ found in Cyprus a gold rondlet pierced for use as a bead of a necklace on which
are " deeply engraved in intaglio three dolphin-like
figures." The three other objects between the triple symbol are called by Cesnola " antique oars,"
but to me they are (stone ?) spear-heads. This bead has been much discussed, and has naturally been compared to the three Legs o' Man and the ancient cognisance of Trinacria (Sicily) where the human grotesque face appears at the central junction of the three legs. The three-legged emblem of the Isle of Man may also be seen
in all its identity on the shield of the giant Enkelados fighting with " Athenaia " on a vase found at Volci (Rouen Museum.)^ This subject is pursued under the heading " Buddha's Footprint " (p. 620). There can be no doubt whatever that the mitsu-tomoye is the emblem of the Chinese triad consisting of Tai-Ki, the Great Supreme or Extreme, with the dual co-principles Yin (i^ and Yang f^- into which he sub-divided ; and Tai-Ki I seek throughout to identify
with the Polar deity. I am glad to find that the late Sir Harry Parkes " thought the figure was derived from the Chinese figure
standing for the origin of all things."^ I suppose that tomo-ye simply means friend-picture or guardian-emblem. The archaic vocabulary of Chamberlain and Ueda* gives for tomo the ancient meanings " stern of a boat, a party of people, a companion "
; and for ye (or yo) the signification " good." As to the notion of "friend" here it might be noted that Mitra means (or can mean) friend ; and in the Satapatha-Brdhuiana-' Mitra is actually made
to say: " Surely, I am everyone's friend (mitra)." In Ireland therefore the mitsu-tomoye may be looked upon as a companion emblem to the shamrock (see p. 6"}^, with an equally Eastern origin ;
and its Polar significance, as an emblem of the great central triad,

explains why it shares with the suastika (see p. 649) its talismanic
position for luck on Japanese roofs, and also why it is called a guardian-emblem. I take this drawing of the (single) tomoye from a valuable paper by Mr. T. R. H. McClatchie on Japanese Heraldry.^ It was pointed out in the Indo-CJiinese Gleaner for January, 182 1, that Tai-Ki :;^ 1^ the First Cause (Meadows renders it " the Absolute ") was represented by the Chinese by means of a circle or zero, and
that this one eternal principle divided and became a dual power or two powers yin and yang which are represented by the same circle " divided by a waving line across the centre. This figure is very commonly seen as a sort of sacred ornament on various occasions among the Chinese." The paper in the Gleaner^ went on very correctly to say that the
feminine yin represented the vis inertiae and the masculine yang the vis mobile in Nature. We thus have the (single) tomoye as the symbol of abstract sex in Nature. Yin and yang being thus separated their re-union very much resembles (and in fact is identical with) the union of heavens-god and earth-goddess in so many other mythologies. When yin and yang approach each other, says the Tao-teh king, they form a symbol thus figured,^ the male yang beingwhite, and the female yin black ; and the whole is Universal Law or Supreme Reason,^ Tao j^ ; which Tao (see Index) I maintain to be directly and radically the same as the Law, Dharma, of Buddhism ; that is to say the Universe itself, Schopenhauer's Welt. This is no new idea. The famous nth century poet Soo Tung p'o, in his elucidation of
the Tao-tih king, was predominated by the theory of the common origin of Buddhism and Taoism.* The Japanese god Daikoku

YANG ENTERING YIN also to contain some notion of the Yin-Yang
holds a hammer for incorporating the In and Y6, so as to produce
therefrom all things.^ A common art-motive with the Chinese school of Japanese painters is the three sages of Buddhism (Sakyamuni) Taoism (Lao-Tsze) and Confucianism considering the diagram of the Yin-Yang or InY6 here figured. The combination Feng or Feng-Hwang (feng being the male and hwang the female), which I mention elsewhere, seems When the two
juxtaposed elements combine it is the moving active yang that descends into and at the same time updraws the inert yin, as
shown in the accompanying figure.The Yang is positive, perfect and subtle, the pure air, the ether, light, heat, mind, the heavens, active force, motion, authority,
virility, the Emperor in the state, the father in the family; and can also be denoted in the mystic diagrams of Chinese philosophy
by a unified line . Yin is the very opposite of yang. Yin is
negative, imperfect, darkness, cold, gross, matter, the earth. All
that is feeble, passive, inert, inferior and subordinate, receptive ; the subject in the state, and the mother in the family, is Yin, which is
figured by a divided line We see this in Babylonia when Ea, the king of destiny, stability
and justice ; the originator of all creation, is the spirit of the Universe

In origin, says the writer of a book on Korea,^ the tomoye is not Japanese but Chinese. It always lies coiled within a circle. Sometimes it is alone, sometimes two share the circle, sometimes three. The last is the commonest number in Japan. In Korea there are always two, and they represent the male and female principles of Chinese philosophy : in
Korean the yang and yong. It is the national badge, and forms the centre of their national flag.
The " black " colour here is erroneous ; it should be blue. Mr. W. G. Aston, C.M.G., who has been Consul-General in Korea, informs m*e that the red and blue colouring is a modern idea ; the original (as may be seen
from the distinctives of the yin and yang above) being black and white. Mr. Aston has kindly sent me^ a coloured engraving of the Korean
flag, from which I take this sketch. The dual tomoye, which he adds is of course the yin and the yang, is there surrounded by those of the eight Chinese Ivwa (see p. 99, vol. i, and note) which appertain to the
cardinal points. It will be seen that
the direction of the tomoye in the four last outlines is counter to that of the Japanese, and is the same as the Irish. I can offer no reason for this.

first groundwork of the more elaborated philosophic theories about Tai Ki. In fact, Pan Ku is represented in Chinese popular
imagery as a naked savage, with a girdle of leaves, holding against
his navel, and as if rolling it between his hands, the round figure of all things.^ It is said in the Loo She (by Lo Mi or L6 Pe of the Sung dynasty, A.D. 960 to 11 26) that when the Great First Principle (Tai Ki) had given birth to the two Primary Forms (yin and yang) and these had produced the four secondary figures, the latter underwent transformations and evolutions, whence the natural objects depending from their respective influences came abundantly into being. The first who came forth to rule the world was named P'an Ku, and he was called the Un
developed and Unenlightened iijl |^ ^ Hwen-tun-shi. The early historians including Sze-Ma Ts'ien (B.C. 130?) did not mention P'an Ku, but the philosophers of the Sung dynasty accepted the legend. Among them Hu Jen-chung wrote that " P'an Ku came into being in the great Waste ; his beginning is unknown. He understood the ways of Heaven and Earth, and comprehended the permutations of the two Principles of Nature, and he became the chief and prince of the Three Powers, San Ts'ai, H ^- Hereupon development began from Chaos."
These three ts'ai are also called the three Ki ;j^ and the three
i ^. Another writer said (in the Fung choiv Kang Keen, vol. i) that Heaven was his father and Earth his mother, and that he was
therefore called Heaven's Son, T'ien tsze ^ ^. The dissolution of
his body at death gave the existing material universe ; the breath becoming winds and clouds, the voice thunder, the blood rivers, the
hair plants and trees, the parasites mankind, his left eye the Sun, and his right the Moon.^ In Japanese myth the purification of Izanagi and also the transformation of the dead body of Kagutsuchi when killed by Izanagi are parallel cosmogonies to P'an Ku ; but a Sun-goddess comes from Izanagi's left eye and a vaoon-god from
his right.^ In Norse mythology we find an equally striking parallel in the evolution of the Universe from the carcass of Ymir.* Now here is a Norse-Japanese riddle-mc riddle-me-ree for the

The Axis as a Bridge
THE Pillar conception assumes in Japanese myth another
odd phase which must now be considered. There was the
ukibasJii or " floating "-Bridge, which we have already met with (p. 31), and it does not, any more than the heavens-Boat, presuppose an actual River. It gave communication between heavens and earth in the age of the gods ;^ the Japanese commentator Hatori Nakatsune makes it the Axis connecting heavens (ame) and earth^ ; but it was reached (a farther complication) by lofty mounds or heaven-stairs called JiasJiidate. The Norse Bridge
from earth to heavens, the bifrost, bilrost, or Asbru, the " tremblingway," had a solid bridge-head at the northern and another at the
southern end, and could not change its position.^ The Broad-Boyne Bridge where stands, in the North, the Brugh
(brug or brud, Palace) of the Boyne, the home of the fairy divine Dagda,* is an identical myth ; but it seems only natural to conclude that the Japanese were helped to the idea of the "floating"
character, the airiness, of their celestial bridge by their own still primitive and daring hanging-bridges over torrents and chasms, formed of the minimum of a slight netting of bamboo cordage and

frail planking a foot wide. Some of these swing seventy yards long, and " strike an awe and terror on the aching sight." The
myriad-years-bridge, again, is a mere beam tied on at each end. The snakes we have seen flung across a river to form Shodo Shonin's
magic bridge belong to the same train of ideas. (See also what is
said about the Japanese rivers supra.) As a matter of fact the bridges of the past were perilous everywhere. One of the rules for the partially segregated lepers of mediaeval Europe was that they should pass no bridge or plank without putting on their gloves ;^ the inference being that they had
to hold on with their hands. The Japanese floating-bridge and the Norse trembling-way have their counterpart in the Cree Indians' slender and slippery tree laid across a rapid stream of muddy and foul-smelling water, and in the Algonkin fable of the oscillating log or snake-bridge by
which the dead crossed a river ; a great dog waiting for them at
the other end,- just as at the Parsi Chinvadh,^ probably the bridge of justness or of the judge," which widens to the length of nine
javelins for the just, and narrows to a thread for the Avicked. It is also likened to a beam with many unequal sides, turning up for the good its wider surfaces, and for the wicked its narrowest, each man
being well or ill-treated according to his works. ^ It is the Sirat bridge of Moslems, sharper than sword edge, finer than hair, which they probably borrowed from the Magians*^ ; and it is the Yorkshire " Brig o' dread, Na brader than a thread," which may come from the similar bridge of the Jews in the Midrash. Another bridge of
dread is the slender cord stretched from cliff to cliff across the
perilous glen in the Irish myths of Cuchulainn.' It is, too, the
plank of the Nivernais peasant,**
Pas pu longue, pas pu large Qu'un ch'veu de la sainte Viarge ;
and there is a folk-prayer, or charm, or mantra called Barbe-a-Dieu, those who know which can alone pass over the plank. A very rare rhymed Flemish pamphlet, published about 1600,
on the street cries of Brussels, mentions the pilgrims returning from

St. Iago Quand nous passions le pont qui tremble, Helas ! mon Uieu !'
This also seems to be d. Jack and the Beanstalk ; and this same
" Grande chanson " of the pilgrims is thus given on a broad-sheet
of 17 1 8. Quand nous fiimes au potit qui tremble, Bien etonnes De nous voir entre deux montagnes Si oppresses, D'ou'ir les ondes de la mer En grande tourmente ; Compagnon, nous faut cheminer Sans demeurance.
{fntir;nt'diaire, xxii, 619.) The sudden appearance of the two
mountains is strange enough (see p. 891). A parallel is the Giol bridge to Hel in the Eddas, and there is
the bridge of Happiness in the Rig Veda? The narrowness, sharpness, fineness, tenuity, and slipperiness of the Bridge may be
originally a recognition of the invisib.lity, the elusive abstract
nature of the " mathematical line,"' the earth-Axis. Mr. Consul F. S. A. Bourne mentions a place called T'ien-ch'iao,
which he translates natuj-ai-hvidgG, in South-Western China. Here a stream emerges from beneath limestone hills. Farther on he
names T'ien-sheng-ch'iao, which he also translates "natural bridge," a picturesque spot among limestone hills, from beneath which issues a stream from a subterranean channel. " From the names on the Chinese map, ' natural-cave,' ' natural-bridge,' and so on, the limestone formation," adds Mr. Bourne, " probably extends quite down to the Tonquin border." It is to be presumed that, in rendering T'ien here by the secondary meaning natural, Mr. Bourne only regards
the matter in a topographical sense ; and I trust I shall not be thought too much enamoured of my own theories if I point out that the literal translation 7/m7v;/-bridge is the true one. For here we have the river of heaven issuing from the heavenly rocks and also the heaven-caves or heavenly rock-dwellings of the Japanese Ame or heaven, which figure conspicuously in the Kojiki^ and

the NUiongi. I think too that I am fortified in my contention by the survival, as reported by Mr. Bourne, in the same neighbourhood of South-Western China, of a species of rock-worship. " At Yang-hn," he says, " I noticed for the first time a curious custom
that appears widely spread over Western China. Wherever there is an overhanging ledge of rock, the coolies brought bits of wood and twigs of trees io prop it up. Under some of these ledges there are hundreds of such diminutive supports. The only explanation I could get was that if they helped the rock it would help them in
return " (p. 9).
I must not omit to parallel the Japanese kago no watashi
by the Indian jula of ropes, where the cage is often replaced by a wooden triangle, a bent bamboo, or a mere coil of rope,
in which the passengers are drawn to and fro by an endless halyard.^ Another variety of the Indian perilous bridge consists of a pair of ropes connected at intervals by stepping-boards.
These the nimble and sure-footed goats refuse, and have to be carried across by the goatherds. Similar bridges are found in the
Peruvian Cordilleras, see an engraving in Marcoy's LAmeriqne du Sud, i, 357. To come nearer home: at Ballater there has been, time immemorial, a rope-bridge on which people are drawn across the Dee ; and until recent years an outlying crag in the Shetlands was reached by a similar machine called " the cradle of Noss." These frailest of flying bridges are in fact common all over Asia. Near the Chinese frontier of Tibet Hue- saw a bridge over the river Ya-Loung-Kiang which consisted merely of one thick rope of yak-hide tightly stretched from one bank to another. A sort of wooden stirrup was hung by a solid strap from a
moveable pulley on the rope. A shepherd put his feet on the stirrup and pulled himself backwards, hand over hand, along the rope. Such " bridges " are very common in Tibet across torrents and chasms. A graphic description of a difficult bridge is given by Mr.
Consul F. S. A. Bourne.^ It was over the Lung river near
YiJn-i Ts'un : " There was the river in violent flood rushing over a feeble

fabric composed of five bamboo poles placed alongside each other. The bridge was about 50 yards long, formed of about ten sections resting on piles. In the ordinary way, crossing it would be only such an act of foolhardy acrobatics as the traveller has to perform many times a day in this country of bamboo bridges, except for the unusual breadth of the stream. But this bridge had two features
peculiar to itself. The bamboos were lashed so far apart that one's whole weight had to be trusted to but one of them at a time, and
the sections of the bridge were unconnected and at differing levels, so that a succession of jumps had to be gone through in mid-stream. . . . But this is not the sort of thing to stop the Chinese, who
have the strongest nerves. By stationing men where the sections of the bridge met, they managed to get all across safely ; but the difficulty may be imagined from the fact that one man lost his head in the middle, and had to sit down and be rescued. While we were watching him, one of my coolies said : ' Any small-livered man must be afraid, for it is not a pleasant thing to be dead.' "^ Numa (pray consult the Index as to him) instituted the sacred
pontifices and was the first pontifex— which Plutarch drew either from potens, powerful, by a wrench which we cannot now admit, or from pons, which gives them the literal title of the word, that is bridge-makers. There is no doubt whatever that they kept and repaired the bridge or a bridge over the Tiber, and sacrificed on it. This sacred bridge, which I conclude to have
been the post or pile bridge. Pons Sublicius, was earliest of wood,
with wooden nails, and was therefore of a wholly pre-metallic age.^ We need little doubt that we have a similar sacred observance to the repairing of this bridge in the " penny-hedge " of nine stakes, nine strout-stowers and nine gedders annually planted (now on Ascension Eve) in the bed of the Esk at Whitby, when the malediction "Out on you! out on you! out on you! " is (or was in May, 1870) blown through a horn " of seventeen centuries ago" (?)"' The title of pontifex Maximus was not given up by the P^mperors until A.D. 382 when Gratianus abdicated it, and resumed the persecution of " the pagans."^
[There is one more not quite impossible origin of pontifex which was also written pontufex ; and that is from pontus, irovro^, the sea

(of course in the capacity of Universe-ocean) and fax, flame or heat. This would combine the Fire and Water which we have here so often seen joined in cosmogonies ; and would accord with Aphrodite pontia of Corinth, and with Pontos, the son of
Poseidon.] The etymology of the word pontifex is always discussed
without any reference to the leading fact of the institution in the 1 2th century of the religious order of the bridge-making Brothers. These " freres pontifcs " built the famous bridge over the Rhone at Avignon, of which four arches still stand, and another the Pont St. Esprit, which is still in use. The congregation spread into
several countries of the continent.^ It is impossible to quit the Bridge question without mentioning the authorities which have taken it for the Rainbow or the Milky Way. In Snorro Sturleson's Gylfa Giiming we have the passage : " The gods made a Bridge from earth to heaven which is called Bifrost (trembling-way). Thou must have seen it ; perhaps thou
callest it the bow in heaven. It has three colours, and is most solid, and fashioned with more art and skill than the other works ; and although it be solid, it will yet break when the mounted sens of Muspell (world-ruin) pass it. Their horses, too, swim the great rivers ; thus do they press forward." The latter portion of this passage is far from preserving a unity of idea, and indeed suggests confusion or incomplete knowledge on the part of so late a compiler as the Christian and hostile Bishop Snorro or Snorri, the son of Sturla (i 1 78-1 241) ; and it is admitted, besides, to have been an addition by the author to his original work. Snorri, like Xenophanes and Aristotle, only gives the rainbow three
colours : but elsewhere in the Norse mythology we have four rivers on fire, side by side. Again, two of these are of red fire, and two of boiling, steaming waters.^ Here there may be discerned a similarity to the River-myths, which we shall encounter later on, and a suggestion of the Northern geysers, and even of the Aurora Borealis. The likeness of these Norse conceptions to the four miraculous clouds of the Shodo Shonin legend must not be overlooked ; and there is in the same legend a comparison of the

green and blue snake-bridge to a rainbow among the hills. It ought to be added here that the Chinese philosophy looks upon the sunuTier solstice as the climax of the annual contest between the principles of heat and cold (fire and moisture), and upon the rainbow
as a product of that contest. The supposition of Professor Tiele and Mr. C. F. Keary that the Avestan Chinvadh bridge was the rainbow seems unsupported ; neither does Grill in Die Erzvdter (p. 191) prove the doublebarrelled assertion that the same bridge corresponds both to the rainbow and the Milky-Way. Nor, without adequate reason shown,
can Professor Justi be followed, who makes out Merezu, in the Vendidad, the greatest seat of battle in the good and bad creation, to be the Milky- Way, and at the same time an Iranian representation of the Eddie Bifrost.^ Such speculations only strike one as contradictory. Bergmann's suggestion that the Norse Breidablik (Broad-shiner), the dwelling of Baldur, was the Milky- Way deserves attention, though it is far from satisfying that its first and second halves should be called Andlang (drawn-out) and W'idblainn (blue-breadth.)^ It might be added that the Basutos call the Milky-Way the "way of the gods," and the Ojis, another African
nation, call it the " way of the spirits," by which souls go up to heaven. North American tribes have called it the " path of the
master of life," the " path of spirits," or the '* road of souls,"
whereon they travel to the land beyond the grave.^ Baiame, " the great master," a god of the black-fellows of the Darling River, welcomes the good dead to a paradise in the Milky
Way." On the other hand, the Milky- Way seems to be viewed as a band tying the Universe together in Proclus (on the Tiuuius of Plato)
where he cites the theologian Orpheus. Nux is instructing Zeus in
his business as to creation, and says :
" kvTap iTxr\v hi<T[iov rjpdrepov e'jn Trout ravvarji,

But when your power around the whole has spread a strong coercive

The Dogs at the Chinvadh Bridge.
UNDER the heading of " Parsi Dakhmas " are some remarks
on the usage of obtaining the consumption of corpses hy dogs. The mild variant of this which is in full practice at the present day requires that a dog shall be made to gaze thrice on the face of the dead Parsi before he is given to the vultures. The Parsis themselves say that the exact object and meaning of this truly extraordinary proceeding has not been properly ascertained ; but if we admit the theory that religious ritual is rooted in
mythology, this sag-did, as it is called, can certainly be illustrated to the fullest, if not explained.
In the Rig Veda the two brown or brindled four-eyed watchdogs of Yama (the son of Vivasvat, the first man, and therefore the foremost, the Fiirst, the King, of the dead) guard the ways to the realm of death (x, 14, 10, seq?)\ and the Avestan Yima, the son of Vivanghat, may almost be called Yama's twin brother. Parsi traditional legend makes white dogs with yellow ears watch at the Bridge which leads from this to the other world,^ and with
their barking drive away the fiend from the souls of the holy ones, lest he should drag them to hell. The conclusion is all but resist
less that in the Parsi sag-did we have the outcome of a perfect
faith in this myth, and a forestalling in this world, a making sure of the momentous offices of the mystical dog in the next. By reading the thirteenth and fifteenth fargards of the Vendidad, we may gain some faint conception of the extravagant attributions of sacredness to the dog in Zoroastrianism. Dogs had holy souls ; in the eye of the Mazdean law it was safer for a Persian to kill a man than to give bad food to a shepherd's dog. Five hundred stripes was the Magian penalty for killing a puppy, 600 for destroying a stray dog, and 800 for a shepherd's dog. The penalties against cannibalism and eating dog's-flesh were the same, but the dog was put first ; the house of the offender was dug out,
his life was torn out—so Darmesteter translated it— and his soul was unclean thenceforth for ever and ever. This has thrown doubt, in the purview of some scholars, on
much of the Zoroastrian religious penalties. But there is no

quite ordinary piece of human nature. Until very recently Christians tortured and burnt each other in crowds, for the very foutiest
little differences of mere theological theory, not enough " to hang
a dog upon." As a great deal of Zoroastrian myth was IndoIranian before it developed into its Iranian forms, much of it is
naturally to be found in Hinduism also ; dog-worship, for instance, is not uncommon. That dog-reverence was considerable in the Vedic periods may be gathered from the Rig Veda} Vamadeva says: "in extreme destitution I cooked the entrails of a dog
(shuna antrani pcchc)" and this circumstance is repeated in Manu
(x, 1 06).
Colebrooke^ gave a Vedic prayer by Vasishtha to the dog of Varuna's dwelling, that is of course a heavens-dog, in which is the petition : " Cause us to be united to a sojourn of happiness, full of delights and melody granted by thee. Preserve us." This is carrying dog-reverence to the very highest pitch. In Western
India it is now customary to feed dogs as a sacred duty on one
day in each month ; and in the religious Hindu's grace before meat is a prayer to the dogs of Yama,'' one of which is Syama (dark), the other Sabala (spotted).
In the Rig Veda the bitch Sarama is Indra's dog and messenger, and the mother of these two four-eyed watch-dogs, called after her Sarameyas. Sarama brought back the cows stolen by the Panis. In the Bhdgavata-piirana Sarama is a daughter of Daksha
(the Right, the creator, the first male, who has a blazing trident),
and is also the mother of wild animals. Among the eight bhaira
vas (= terrible) or inferior manifestations of Siva the third is Ruru a dog. In these bhairavas Siva often rides upon a dog, being therefore called Svvaswa, dog-horsed.
The Vendidad prescribes that the dog employed for the sag
did [sag = dog ; didan == to see] must be either yellow with four eyes, or white with yellow ears. The two extra " eyes " are
traditionally and doubtless correctly interpreted to mean (so far as the natural dog is concerned) two symmetrical spots near the natural eyes. But in practice at the present day a shepherd's dog, no matter how marked, suffices ; or a house-dog, or even an owncr

less dog ; but the animal must be four months old. The Godefroy
MS. (No. 194 in the Library of the Institut) of Charles IX's posthumous Livre du Roy Charles (ch. viii) lays it down that the true breed of French black hounds was then " quatr' oeillers " with red ; " that is to say, had red or ' fauve ' marks over the eyes, the legs being generally of the same colour." In fact they were black
and-tan, and were called four-eyed from the staring spots over the eyes. This, I venture to submit, places it beyond doubt that the "brown or brindled four-eyed watch-dogs of Yama" were simply black-and-tan hounds ; the four-eyed epithet, older doubtless than Mazdeism, having come with them to Europe from the East. There were dogs in Phoenician temples,^ and in other temples of antiquity. The Hindus and the Venetians consider dog's saliva medicinal, which is an astonishing thing, and there is the old French proverb " langue de chien sert de medecin." In Bohemia it is lucky to have newborn infants licked by dogs. In Armenia also,
and elsewhere in Asia and Europe this superstition obtains.^ A dog was killed in Mexico to serve as a guide to the dead, and the Chichimec race of Mexicans were called dogs." An Arabian tribe calls itself Band Kalb, sons of a dog : another Band Kilab, sons of
dogs.'* The Harranian Arabs sacrificed to the dog, and in some mysteries dogs were their brothers. Caleb means dog, and the Calibites in the Old Testament were such a dog-tribe. In Isaiah (Ixv, 4 ; Ixvi, 3, 17) dog-sacrifice was a heathen abomination. The dog was eaten sacrificially by the Carthaginians.^ The Assyrian huntsman (called Herakles) who is accompanied by a dog on the Cylinders is, says Prof Robertson Smith," Adar, the Sicilian Adranus, who had sacred-dogs.^ The Tyrian Herakles, that is Melcarth, was also accompanied by a dog. At Sparta, recorded Pausanias (iii, 14), "each band of youths sacrifices a whelp to Enyalian Ares. I do not however know of any other Greeks who sacrifice whelps except the Colophonians, who sacrifice a black whelp to Enodian Hecate." Both sacrifices were nocturnal. Hecate was accompanied by dogs, and loved to be
called the Dog in worship."* Dogs were sacrificed to her.

which a number of dogs were sacrificed ; and the Romans sacrificed dogs in August. Two sacrifices were offered up on the top of Pehon to Zeus Actaios, which must be connected with Actaion torn in pieces by his 50 dogs (compare the slaying of the 50 husbands of the Danaides), There were 50 dogdays.^ The connec
tion of all this with Siunvicr-Jicat, the dogstar Sirius and the dog
days is no explanation, although many accept it for such, but a
mere going round in a vicious circle. The Carians sacrificed dogs to Ares.^ The Athenians, contra,
from all antiquity took care that no dog should enter the acropolis ;
and Philochoros {frag. 146) recorded as a prodigy (ai]fxelov) that a dog got into the temple of (Athene) Polias, and the Pandrosion, and even to the altar of Zeus Herkeios.
A dog was sacrificed to the Lares, who are of limitless antiquity, and have been classed with the Cabires. The Lares were draped therefore in dog-skins.^ The dog was sacred to Hermes. A dog was kept at Rome in the temple of .^sculapius. There were dogs (doubtless a kind of St. Bernard's) at the temple of Vulcan, on Mount Etna, and they guarded Vulcan's fire-temple in Rome. Apollo was a dog for the daughter of Agenor (or Antenor), and their son was Telmissos. If this be Agenor (as seems likely, for Antenor, who had 19 sons, would not appear to have had any daughter), the mother of Telmissos was Europa herself, the sister of Kadmos, afterwards rapt away to Crete by bull-Zeus. Apollo was Lukeios at Argos, so was Zeus in Arkadia ; Artemis was Lukaia at Troizen, A wolf fights the bull in the legend of Danaos, and thus gave its origin to the temple of the Wolf-Apollo.* The earliest coins of Argos bore a wolf whose head was sometimes rayed."' Zeus was also KunaiTheus, the Dog-god in Arkadia.^' Argos, the dog of Aktaion and Odusseus, seems also to be a heavens-dog. The Kunosarges or dog-yard sacred to Herakles Kunades is connected by Pausanias with a legend of a white bitch. The Greeks according to Plutarch {Rom. Qncest. 51) made use of dogs in their purifications, and actually had a sort of bambino ceremony
called " carrying round the puppy."'' An inscription found in the

Y^vvo<iOvpa, Cynosura, cynosure, the name of the Little Bear, and also of the Polestar, must, as DogTaii, be connected with the celestial Northern Dog. The people of Throndhjem chose King Eystein's dog Sauer for their King. He was gifted by witchcraft with three men's wisdom. When he barked, he barked one word and spoke two ; which seems to indicate three mouths and thus three heads like Kerberos.
He dwelt in Indri Isle and his mansion is now called Saurshaug.^ In the lesser Swedish chronicle the dog is called Sverre. In a Danish chronicle- Adils makes his dog Rache King of Denmark. In Saxo (vii, 351) the Swede Gunnar makes his dog King of the Northmen. The mother or wife of the Eskimo good god Torngarsuk has a huge watch-dog in her haunt under the sea. The dog sleeps for one moment at a time^ ; clearly a variant of the wakefulness of Kerberos.
The heaven-dogs, ama-inu, of Japan, seem to me to be clearly comparable with other mythological dogs, which is not perhaps to be wondered at for natural dogs, nay natural men, wherever they occur, are clearly comparable each with other. The ama-inn are found in pairs guarding tem.ple entrances ; thus the dogs had to be passed to reach holy ground. They are at the foot of the Mikado's throne as leg-supporters of the golden chair. Legends
make these ten-gu (their Chinese alias, ^ ^) inhabit mountains
and unfrequented places, and the pictures give them a long nose, wings, and two claws only on each foot and hand. The warts or great bosses covered with spindles on pinus Thunbergii (Kuromatsu) are called nests of the heavens-dogs, tengu no su, by the
foresters.''

'®^sv it would almost seem as if he should be viewed as
the jackal-god himself Anpu (Anubis) than as that god's sacred animal. Ways-guide was also a name of Anpu, in the nome of Siout (Saout) especially ; and that one of the four Canopes (?),
" lords of the angles " of heaven ''"^J [p" who guards the heart of
the dead Duaumautef or Tiauw^r/z/ef :^''^v\ ^ (obviously con
nected with the goddess Maut ^V\0) is jackal-headed. The
classic name of Saout was Lycopolis, ?;Au/c:&)f iroki'^, which clearly shows that the "jackal" was then considered to be a wolf by the foreigner.
The two ap-uatu often replace the wings of the winged sphere in the always uppermost portion of monuments. The two Eyes of
heaven, the utchat, ^x^ also replaced the same wings, which
directly connects the 2 jackals with the 2 eyes. The Denderah
" zodiac," so miscalled, which is in reality a celestial chart, shows in the centre (which Biot no doubt rightly says is the North pole)
one divine jackal. " Two similar jackals serve to fix the N. and the
S. in certain monuments which it was desired to adjust to the points of the compass."' So that nothing can be much more likely
than that eyes, wings, and jackals have all reference to the two extremities of the Universe-axis.
Anpu is a god of the highest rank, son of Nephthys and Osiris [M. Pierret gives one instance which calls him " son of the Cow "
{i.e., of Isis) p. 49] ; he helped in the search for the pieces of Osiris;
but he is also a god of the dead, that is of the South, and is figured with the head of a black jackal, a supposed allusion to his position in the under hemisphere. But if there be anything in the facts I have just given as to the N. and the summit of the stelae, the old symbolism of the jackal would seem to have its supremacy aiid its origin in the North. The statuettes which give Anpu drawing the bow may have reference to an archaic supernal position ; for this magic bow must be regarded not as " the bow in the heavens," but as the bow which is the heavens.

says that Anepu seems to have preceded, d'avoir en le pas sur,
Osiris as a funereal god. M. E. de Rouge seemed in doubt about the reading matenon,
which he queried/ But he said distinctly that one celestial jackal
is qualified as the " guide of the North celestial ways," the other as
"guide of the Southern ways." {Notice, 71.) On the summit ot a (Louvre) stela, before the i8th dynasty, is the sphere between
the two eyes a7id the two (black) jackals {tlud. 90). On another stela of the iSth dynasty the summit is occupied by "the vase" with two lotus-flowers on an altar, flanked right and left by the 2 jackals (loi). Another stela (temp. Seti I) shows the divine triad of Osiris, Isis, and Horus in the summit accompanied by
"the jackal-god guardian of the Southern way" (114). A later stela shows below the winged sphere (or globe, as de Rouge here calls it) "two jackals towing the barque of the Sun" (120). I think it is obvious that these funereal (canine) jackals must
be connected with the Zoroastrian dogs of the dead, and with all other canine animals of the bridge or paths to the other world, The Anastasi papyrus iv (xiii, 3) mentions a " red dog-wolf,"
long-tailed, and roving at night ; and a dog of big size, a sort
of mastiff perhaps, was called au ^^ Q. M and auau
d^<S^=2k ^ff- a manifest parallel to our babies' bowwow. A
personage is often represented too, on funereal stela.-, accompanied by a dog which again is accompanied by its pet-name ; but these seem to be all different from the ap-heru animals. The sacred Zoroastrian dog was also a dog apart, the four-eyed dog. The word

be put with another word of his, given as jackal alone. |'f J M^

" The jackal, by a myth that cannot be called pious," writes
Mr. Lang,- " was said to have eaten his father Osiris." The most

'EetpLO'i the Dogstar, under the reign of PanDIon, Ikarios and Phanothea were a divine couple whose daughter was Erigone. To
Ikarios Dionusos, in return for hospitality made the gift of Wine, which shepherds finding drank to drunkenness, quarrelled with and
killed Ikarios, burying his corpse in the well Anugros, which they
then filled up with stones. The despairing Erigone became a
wanderer, searching everywhere with her bitch Maira'^ for her
father's body (a sort of Isis and Osiris myth). At last she finds
his grave at the foot of a tree in Humettos— (clearly the Universe
Tree with the Well at its roots), and hangs herself thereon. Dio
nusos or else Zeus assumes all these actors into the heavens Ikarios as Bootes or Arktouros ; Erigone as Virgo, and the bitch Maira as
the (dogstar) Seirios.^ Nota bene that there is absolutely nothing whatever in this
myth to connect a dog with this " dogstar," or to justify the trans
formation. It may be, for all we can now tell, pure and simple downright lying on the part of some inventive expounder of the
constellation-names. Maira (daughter of Proitos and Anteia) was also the virgin huntress-companion of Artemis,* but killed by her with an arrow because she refused the chase, when gravid by

Zeus with Lokros. The Proitides, daughters of Proitos, by yet another legend went mad and beheved themselves cows. It was in Erigone's honour that the swinging games of the Aiora
or Eora were practised (see " The Tree ") ; while the Askolia game

in which a man tries to preserve equilibrium standing on a full
wine-skin —was invented by Ikarios, who was also one of the firstvineplanters, and Erigone was also said to be the Vine, climbing and hanging on the trees. Though of the Roman and Ptolemaic periods, the Denderah " zodiac " (celestial chart), must have perpetuated many more ancient things. Among these one would suppose to be the repre
sentation of the Egyptian Sept I A ^ (Sothis, Sirius), as the
cow-Isis lying-down in a boat. " The soul of Osiris dwelt in
the personage who stalks on before Sept, holding the 1 uas sceptre
and wearing the crown of the South."^ The Decree of Canopus
calls Sept " the star of Isis." There is nothing about a dog here.
Sept A ^ is a human-headed god in the Peremhni (Book of the
Dead).2 The acceptation of the word Sept (which has many meanings),
must here be, I suggest, " to protect, to be a Providence," as in
Sept-taui A " Providence of the double-land," that is of the
land of the N. and S., of the Earth —a title of Amasis." As " triangle," Sept too ought perhaps to have some connection with the pyramid. Hyginus* gave a long tale about the constellation Canis ; which was the dog set by Zeus to guard Europa. It afterwards came to Minos ; and this, said Hyginus, was the dog (Lailaps, whirlwind)
which Prokris in childbirth accepted as a wholesome and luck
working gift [which recalls the Parsi sagdid]. Another reason was
that Prokris was studious of the chase, and that no wild animal
could outrun Lailaps. After Prokris was fatally wounded by Kephalos, the dog came to him, and he took it with him to Thebes, where a wild fox, which no other dog could overtake,' was devas

The Heavens-Boat.
[No mor^ than the Bridge does the heavens-Boat presuppose an actual
mythic Ri\cr.]
THERE is another at first sight puzzhng point about the
Japanese bridge which must not be slurred over. When Ninigi carne down from heaven he " set off floating shut up in the
floating-bridge of heaven,"^ as the very difficult passage has been interpreted by the native commentator Hirata. His predecessor Motowori confessed he could make nothing of it, but Hirata compares the Bridge itself to "some kind of huge boat in which the gods went backwards and forwards " between heaven and earth.- The Bird-boat of heaven, Amc no Toribune, was a deity begotten by Izanagi and Izanami ; and this Kami is also called the Rock-Camphortree-boat of the Bird Tori no Iha-Kusa-bune no Kami." He afterwards descends to Earth. " A passage in the NiJiongi quoted in the Sanzai-^zwyfi says the two Kami Izanagi and Izanami begat Kayu. This god even when three years old could not stand on his legs ; they therefore embarked him in the heavenly Boat of adamantine camphor wood, and turned him adrift to the Winds."^ (This Kayu is the abortion Hirugo of the Kojiki (i, 4, and 7), and has erroneously been confused with the Japano-Buddhic Ebisu.) In modern folklore the Takara-bune (treasure-ship) sails into port every New-year's eve with " the treasures " (takara-mono) on
board. These comprise a lucky-coat, the worldwide hat of invisi
bility, an inexhaustible purse, a precious jewel, a sacred key, a hammer, and other properties. The passengers in the good ship
are the Seven Fortune-gods, the Shichi Fukujin. It is also worth noting that the generic term, maru, which terminates the names of merchant ships, means simply " round "
;
as in Sagami Maru, Koryo Maru and so on (Kan is similarly used for warships, but is a Chinese loan-word ; Maru is pure Japanese). One name for the bridge is taken to have been the boat of the heavens-rock (ama-noTha bunc or Iwa fune), and this name

seems to find a striking sort of parallel in the log of the good ship
Argo, which issued forth between the Kuanean rocks. But I fancyit must turn out that this Japanese Boat was a separate myth, which has got muddled-up with the Bridge myth. Although, indeed, one might try and explain the " boat in which the gods went backwards and forwards between heaven and earth," from everyday Japanese life, for it might quite prosaically seem to
suggest the ordinary kago no ivatasJii bridge, which is thus
described in Murray's Handbook of Japan, by Messrs. Satow and Hawes
" Four stout hempen ropes are secured to each bank of the river. Suspended to these ropes is a rude sort of kago, cage or cradle, consisting merely of a wicker-work circular bottom, above which are bent and firmly attached crosswise a couple of hoops made of tough branches. The suspension of the cradle is simplicity itself ; the four bridge-ropes passing through the cross
hoops." The passenger gets into, is " shut up " in fact, in this cradle or cage, and pulls or jerks himself across by handling the ropes, and the dangerous exercise seems to require about as much practice as snow-shoeing. There is an engraving of one in Humbert's Le
Japon Illustrc ({, 91), which is even frailer than that here described ; and oddly enough he calls it a sort of " bac aerien " or airy ferryboat. Here we would have the floating-bridge and the boat in
one ; in fact neither is complete without the other, and it seems
natural that a native mind like Hirata's should have furnished the
interpretation which he gave.
Of course another, and not incompatible, line of illustration of the Boat idea will occur to everyone in the boat of Charon, and the Egyptian bark of Ra, which navigates heaven, or floats on the back of Nut.i We must not forget the sacred barque of Osiris mentioned on the Stele of Ptahmes.- The dead also became mariners of the divine bark of Horus in the underworld f and there is a
Chinese constellation in the Milky Way and in our Perseus,
t'ien-chuen, the heaven-ship.

The Bridge too is at times replaced by a boat in the Rig Veda ;
and there is another and quite naturalistic constellation in the
Chinese sphere, Wang-liang, or King's-bridge (in our Cassiopeia),
explained as the bridge which spans the moat of the Ruler's castle,
and which kings or chiefs crossed when paying homage^ ; this moat
was crossed also by a boat. The connection with the other world by means of a boat is in fact world-wide. The Greeks put an obolus in the mouth of the
corpse, and looked on it as ferriage, vavXov, for Charon. Similarly
the Chinese place a silver bit in the mouth of the dead to pay the toll to heaven. As the Hindus recognise a river (Vaitarani) in the
way to another sphere, and it has to be crossed with great difficulty, it is possible, writes Mr. Rajendralala Mitra^ that the original idea
of placing gold in the dead hand, as is done to this day, was
ferriage. Manu's ship was towed in the deluge (of the primeval universewaters) by Vishnu as the fish with a most stupendous horn (axis ?) to which the ship was made-fast with the great sea-serpent used as a hawser. (The ship is here the Earth, says the Bhagavata-purdna (') 3. 15)) ^"<^ the Manu was Vaivaswata, the seventh Manu.) The golden junk or ship is in Siam, one of the emblems on the
famous symbol-repertory called the footprint of Buddha. In the
Life of Buddha we are told of the lustrous vessel of the true Law, by which he enables men to cross the ocean of transmigrating
existence, and reach the other shore, that is to say attain nirvana.^ There is a favourite dharani which no doubt has reference to
this—Gata, gata ; Paragata ; Parasangata ; Bodhisatwa ; which is
rendered " gone, gone, gone-across (or burnt out), gone across for
ever, Bodhisawva."'* We shall not be far wrong in connecting the
symbol and the dharani, which, as my friend (if I may call him so) the Japanese Buddhist priest, Mr. Nanjio Bunyu informed me some years ago, reappears in Japan as : Giyate, giyate, haragiyate, hara so giyate, Bojisobaka. The ten transcendent Buddhist virtues are called paramita, which Burnouf derived from param, " to
the other shore," and ita, " the act of being gone "
; the other shore
being nirvana. This golden junk seems a near parallel to the
heavenly rock-boat ; and I shall just mention a sentence which

occurs twice in the Rig Veda, and reminds one strangely of the dharani : " Through your aid, Aswins, we cross over this Hmit of
darkness."^ This refers, doubtless, to the Universe-myth of Bhujyu, son of Tugrci, in which the Aswins "constructed a pleasant, substantial,
winged plava " (raft or float), or else " cliatnsro ndvah, four boats,"
launched according to Roth, into mid-heaven (samudra, i.e. antariksha), and " made a path across the great waters " and " brought safe to shore " the supplicating son of Tugra, who, " cast
headlong into the waters and plunged in inextricable darkness," was clinging for support to the Tree stationed in the midst of the ocean. " What was that Tree ? " asks the hymn,^ and gives no reply. It was clearly the World-Tree, and the legend is an archaic salvation-myth. Elsewhere there is also a strange prayer to Agni
to "bestow a boat ever fitted with oars and feet (Navam nityari-.
tram padvatim) ... to bear mankind across to felicity."'"
This boat the commentators—and perhaps they are not very far
wrong—explain to be sacrifice, the oars being the priests, and the feet the prayers and offerings. The bahish-pavamana (outside
purifying) chant is called in the Satapatha-brdJuiiana'' " truly a ship
bound heavenwards ; the priests are its spars and oars, the means
of reaching the heavenly world." I have come to feel little doubt that the "vehicles" and ''crossing over" of Buddhism, which are thus to be traced to the
Vedas, give us the self-same idea as the boat. One prayer is : N "May the Ancient and most mighty Indra, who is a sure con
' veyance, bear us over all difficulties" {Rig V., iii, 428). Agni is called "the conveyance" (iii, 36), and the commentators add "by
which mortals cross over sin," a gloss which lacks clarity. Again
(iii, 148) "yoking the straight-going steeds, the sage Kutsa was
enabled to cross over calamity." And we have the actual parallel of the boat used in iii, 241, where Agni is addressed in the words :
" thou conveyest us, Jatavedas, across all intolerable evils, as over a river by a boat" ; and again (iii, 271), " May Agni enable us to
pass over all our enemies (?) as [a river, says the commentator]
with a boat." The same mystery recurs at p. 425: "When thou, Indra, the hero, hadst crossed, having traversed the ocean, thou hast enabled

to cross (aparayat)." The great Babylonian god Ea had a ship " unparalleled by Fate " (?) in which he traversed the Ocean to help his son Marduk when fighting Tiamat. In it £a also saved Sisithrus from the flood^ ; and it is clear that we must identify it with the boat of
Bhujyu in the Vedas. Ur-Ea (Lion of lia), the boatman of Xisuthrus, conveyed
Izdubar across the sea of the waters of Death, according to the
tenth Gilgamish Assyrian tablet (700 B.C.), as translated by Prof.
Sayce.^ Sanchoniathon said the eight Kabirim invented navigation ;
and the seafaring Phoenicians figured to themselves that the stars
made their voyages over the celestial ocean in boats.^ The name
of the boat KepKQvpo<i or KepKovpo<^, like that of the Island Corcyra
(Kop/cvpa) which it resembles, may have a reference to this rotating
motion. Mr. E. R. Wharton says KepKovpo'i is Cypriote not
Corfiote. One would even be inclined to see this heavens-boat resting
on the Cosmic mountain, after the settlement of the Cosmic
Ocean, in the ark resting after the deluge on " lofty Ararat, which looms amid the Caucasian and Anatolian Alps in majestic
isolation."* A white-ink papyrus in the Louvre-^ shows the defunct sailing
on the heavens-waters. Another MS. shows the mummy in a boat which is on a sledge drawn (presumably towards water) by
four oxen. One of the three coffins of the librarian Sutimes exhibits him navigating the heavens-space. On a fragment of a grey granite Egyptian " calendar " in the Louvre are the t,6 decads of the year of 360 days, each as a man-headed hawk in a boat.*^ The symbolism is incongruous when one comes to think over it, for what does a hawk want

vvith a boat ; but it is valuable as showing how inseparably the boat had then (whenever it was) got to be connected with motion
in or of the heavens or heavenly bodies and periods. The sacred boats and arks of the Egyptian gods were taken
outside the temples on their feast-days in processions.^ Maspero^
says the bari was the model of these sacred barks. " The ark of the Covenant itself," says M. Babelon,^ " resembled
those naoi or bari which we see carried by Egyptian priests upon
their shoulders."

agree in the identification of the good ship Argo (see Index) with
the heavens-boat.

Azis Myt/is.~\ The Ladder. 1015
The Ladder.
AFTER the descent by Bridge and stairs of the Japanese
Ninigi already mentioned, the hasJiidate fell down flat ; and one tradition says they became sandspits forming a series
of natural breakwaters on several points of the Japanese coast.^ One is shown which is said to measure 22,290 feet. That accomplished Japanese scholar Mr. E. M. Satow (from whose invaluable Essays in the Transactions of the Asiatic Society of Japan I frequently have occasion to quote) views the representation of one
of the Jiashidate as a pillar of solid earth to be a modern in
vention^ ; but, as I trust the array of facts in this Inquiry may show, this pillar idea is worldwide and undoubtedly primeval ; although in Japan it may be a graft on the Spear-Axis myth. Hashi meant ladder and bridge in archaic Japanese, and hashira a pillar is a word of the same family, where -ra may simply be a vague plural.'^ Hashitate is standing-ladder. The
use of the term as a "pillow-word " in the Kojiki (iii, 127)^ for a mountain called Dark-Ladder, Kurahashi (? the night-heavens), seems to be very significant, although the true sense has escaped all the commentators. 1. Hashitate no | Kurahashi-yama wo Sagashimi to | Iha kakikanete
Waga te torasu mo. 2. Hashitate no | Kurahashi-yama ha Sagashi kedo | Imo to noboreba Sagasliiku mo arazu. [Powerless to scale the Rocks, because of the steepness of the vertical-laddered Dark-Ladder mountain, She deigns to take my hand. Steep though Kurahashi be, steep it is not when I climb it with my Sister.] The sister here is the goddess Medori, which simply means Hen-bird. She is therefore the consort of the
heavens-bird and this confirms the above interpretation of Kurahashi-yama. Her consort is the Ouick-Falcon-lord, Hayabusawake, and his elder brother is the Great-Wren (a curious con

in the very highest celestial circles. Medori also weaves at her loom— a divine Veil for the highsoaring Falcon-lord (taka-yuku ya | Hayabusa-wake no | mi osuhigane). Here is a further point of contact with the sublime and universal Weaving-myths already treated of/ The signification stairs or ladder at once connects these hashidate with Jacob's Ladder, which stood up from the Earth ; its head touched the heavens, the messengers of Jehovah (Yahveh) ascending and descending on it, while Yahveh stood above it,^ and spake.
A^ace called The Ladder " of Tyrus unto the borders of Egypt "
is mentioned in i Maccabees xi, 59. The Ladder was a mountain near Ptolemais, mentioned by Josephus.^ It is now sufficiently clear that this going up and down the ladder is a figure of metemp
sychosis, like the ladder in the cave of Mithra which extended
through the Seven planetary spheres.*
In the Orphic verses souls come from the Moon and return there as manes.^ In the Egyptian " Book of Breathings" the corporeal germs issue from Orion (?) in the bosom of Nut.*^ In Fergusson's Naga sculptures' an upper and a lower tree are joined by a kind of ladder or steps, which give us the World-tree and ladder conjoined. On one of the sacred symbolic " Hittite stones at Eyuk a man is represented climbing a ladder. '^
I have conjectured elsewhere that it will some day be made clear that the identification of Mithra with the sun is but comparatively modern. Celsus^ described among the secret symbols
of the higher Mithraic doctrine, the ladder just referred to, as having seven gates, and overhead an eighth gate ; the mysteries had seven degrees. Those admitted to the first—that is the vast mass of
worshippers ; " the soldiers "
; a sort of Salvation Army—received
a wreath or crown, and said " Mithra is my crown.'"" This crown

is nothing but the endless circle of Time, and is connected with the Universe-wheel, and not with the sun. In the Persic degree and mysteries no offering was made to Mithra but honey, which / must have indicated the Bees or stars of heaven. In the leontic degree the initiated wore a vestment covered with figures of all
sorts of animals, which seems to refer to the Veil or vesture of the Universe, with which I deal elsewhere.
This ladder and its eight doors of different metals are a parallel
to Plato's luminous pillar of the heavens, surrounded by eight
spheres of diverse colours,^ and offer us nothing but the Universe
axis. Creuzer went so far (i, 360) as to theorise that it is probable that in the upward progress through these seven degrees the conception of Mithra was gradually unfolded to the initiated, until he was identified with the Eternal, with Zervan Akerane, which would just chime in with my arguments.
There is in IpJiigeneia in Tauris a " Brauronian sacred stair " which climbs or mounts up. This must be our ladder or stairs which is near by the Bear. On the Aventine hill was shown the subterranean stone stairs called the Ladder of Cacus."
The " knife-ladder " now used by Taoist exorcists or priestjugglers in China is a clear combination of the Bridge and Ladder ideas. It is formed by two uprights of bamboo in which knives or
swords are inserted, edge-uppermost, as rungs. The " knife-bridge "
is a similar horizontal ladder.'^ We see the heavens-ladder idea cropping up again in the middle-ages collection of edifying anecdotes called the Scala Ccli
by Friar Johannes (Gobii) Junior of the order of Preachers, about the middle of the 14th century. After the Gcsta RomanoniiN, it
is the most interesting of all the mediaeval story-books. The chapel outside Rome on the road to Ostia which is called the Scala Cceli got its name from St. Bernard's vision of the souls for whom he was saying mass ascending to heaven by a ladder.^ The Ladder idea still subsists (and for an obvious reason) in the
French term for places of em- and disem-barkation — " les echelles du Levant, les echelles de I'extreme Orient." The once-famous

name of Scaliger, whom Henri Quatre insisted upon calling M. de Lescalle, hides a ladder, and the La Scala opera-house gives us (when it is not in ruins) a music more audible than that of the
spheres. The idea of a Ladder may not have primarily arisen from its
affording access alone ; but also from its removeability. When heavens and earth were joined (as myths universally agree they
were), the " ladder " was there. Now they are separate, now that
aiccess is impossible, the (Japanese) ladder has been taken, or has
fallen, down.



PFAor/s.l Whorls. 1019
CHAPTER XII.
Whorls.
I
HAVE already (p. 649) compared the ancient symbols on the Trojan whorls to the rtiodern formulae on the Buddhist praise-machines ; but there is perhaps a closer parallel. The markings on many of the whorls bear an almost unmistakable resemblance to written characters. It would be strange indeed if these too, should they be ever fully deciphered, turn out to be
similar ascriptions of praise to the supreme heavens-deity. It is also possible that some of them may be astronomical signs. Apart from this class of whorls bearing what are apparently
archaic, rude, ill-formed, characters of writing, there remain several other marks which seem to me to be symbols attaching to the heavens-worship which this treatise aims at elaborating. I fancy that the World-tree, the Mountain and the heaven-River, already so fully dealt with here (see Index) can also be traced on the whorls
The illustrations on the opposite page, among others, seem to me to have reference to the world-tree. Dr. Schliemann has already

pointed out these trees {Ilios, pp. 367, 383, 413), but I have not
before found them claimed for the World-tree. The last illustration

I shall give of the Tree is the curious object No. 1809. It is twice
the size here represented, and is of lustrous-yellow baked clay. It is quite flat on the underside, and the upright square handle has the
wheel (similar to No. 1997, p. 646) and the tree. It somewhat resembles the stones used in curling, and the cavity at one side is like the well of a gravy-dish. If it did not belong to some game
or other, I would suggest that, like a few items of the extensive



PV/ior/s.] IVhor/s. I02I
"plant" of minute brass utensils which the Hindus employ in their
private devotions, it may have been used for libations, or other offer
ings, in the prehistoric cult to which the emblems incised upon it
refer us. Little vessels not so very unlike it are still used in Catholic
countries for domestic " holy water." Dr. Schliemann presumes the hollow was to put the hand in, and that the " instrument may have served for polishing the newly made and still unbaked pottery." The whorls which may be conjectured to show the Mountain in their markings divide into two distinct categories as to each of
1905
Ail
1939- iqi2.
1408.
which I freely confess myself equally diffident. The first are those
which offer the mark jJJ. The full whorl 1905 has already been given at p. 653 ; and 1408 is not a whorl but a watch-shaped amulet twice the size here shown, with two holes for suspension, it
may be, round the neck. My reasons for taking this as a sign for
the Mountain are the two following. It is clearly like the Chinese
character for Mountain, Shan, ( I | , which is also employed (p. 915) for ocean islands ; the Three Isles of the Genii, for instance, being
called either san shan or san t'ao. Mr. Flinders Petrie in his
Seasoji in E^j'p^ (1S88), p. 22, gives the following hieroglyphic from a beautiful sculpture in Bath Museum, where Ramcsu II is accom
panicd by his /ca. I | • Mr. Petrie says this must mean the dark
opening of a rock tomb " beneath the mountains, whose sign is on it." I would, of course, add that the mountain represented is the heavenly mountain. To this I will add the badge of a former Japanese daimio, Aoki Gengoro, in which wc have the tiiplc



I02 2 The Night of the Gods. {^IVhorls.
peaked mountain issuing, as some say, from the clouds, but, as I
would suggest, in combination with the heaven-river.^ As to my
next point I am sensible of another difficulty. Dr. Schliemann
says in Ilios (pp. 350, 602) that the sign \\\ occurs over the openings of three hut-urns found under ancient lava at Marino near Albano ; and this would seem to me to be a similar sepulchral case to that pointed out by Mr. Flinders Petrie ; and Dr. Schliemann
says it occurs also among the devices on the flagstones in the
interior of the tomb of 011am Fodhia {Ilios, p. 350). Loftus, in his Travels in Chaldea (1857), says that "scratched upon the edge
of one object" found at Warka were the characters </ l*^*^! I I. " which approach nearer to the Himyaric than any with which I
am acquainted " (p. 226). But when, four years later than Ilios, Dr. Schliemann again
mentions in Troja (1884) the sign jJJ it is inverted and slightly
altered, as TTT and the signs on the hut-urns (which I have not
seen) found at Marino, as above, and i;i tombs near Corneto,
are given as STTtTP • I11 this latter, as a Hittite glyph, some
scholars have, says Prof Sayce, seen a chair—a tripod, a three
legged stool in fact. Of course, if the sign is to be looked at in
this way—and the amulet (if it be one) No. 1408, when suspended,
would tell in that direction—the Mountain theory must be dropped ; and in that case another class of similar marks, with m.ore than three
upright strokes, claim attention. I here give the majority of them.
One with four uprights is already seen on 19 12, and it will be
observed that 1906 alone gives the object reversed. It would
also appear {Troja, p. 1 26) that the Italian hut-urns give a quadruped
Ti-aits. As. Sec. Japan, v, 14 (1S76).



WAor/s.~\ Whorls. 1023
as well as a tripod symbol, thus : Sjjjjj^ • ^^ ^"^^ t)e the
CDrrect position, all such signs may represent primitive altars formed
of upright and horizontal great flat stones. There are also a large number of other whorls which bear a more complicated symbol, mentioned by Dr. Schliemann as " burning altars," or " altars with
flames" {Ilios, pp. 417, 418, etc.), but these would lead me too far
afield.
I now proceed to the other distinct category of Mountain
whorls. In these I would propose to see a representation of Mount Chakrawan, the wall of the world, the crystal annular mountain, or rather mountain-range, which encircles the system, and which must also be identified with the Iranian AlbordJ
(p. 887). Whorls 1902 —of which two other views have been

may perhaps also be included, and there are a very large number resembling 1906, 1907 and 1908, above, which I should be inclined to add to the foregoing. There is yet another series of whorls in which I detect the conical
Mountain already treated of (pp. 922, 925). Such are 18 19 and 1897, herewith, and also 1873, already given under the head of "The Suastika" (p. 649). The whorl 1920 may give us both the rounded mountain and a peaked chain.

might even rush to the conclusion that the two animals nearest the
centre might be representatives, not necessarily ursine, of the Great and Little Bears. On the other hand, it does not seem impossible that in 1840 we have a representation of some such cosmical myth as the Hindu eight oceans surrounding the central chakra. The seven annular mountain ranges surrounding /<J^^^^^^S\ '^46Mount Meru form one of the emblems of the Siamese Buddha's footprint, and the seven annular belts of ocean between them form another ; but
there is an eighth, the great, ocean outside ; the whole system being bounded by the crystal range of Chakravvan.i There need be little doubt, I think, that 1846 gives
us thrice the triple fleur-de-lis emblem of the triad of central
deities (see p. 62).
The mention of constellation signs on whorl 1879 leads directly to what seem without any manner of doubt to be astronomical signs on the terra-cotta balls which, it seems hard to deny, represent the heavenly sphere, and foreran our modern " celestial globes "
;
not as what we now call scientific but rather as sacred astrological
symbols, it may be even as heavens-idols. The first of these which I present is the ball numbered 1986 in
Ilios ; of which there are three views. Dr. Julius Schmidt, Director
of the Athens Observatory, who shows an extreme caution in his remarks, says :
"We recognise on the ball 1986 the equator by two parallel
' Alabaster's JV/uxl of i/ic Law, 293, 306.



I026 The Night of the Gods. [ Whorls.
circles, the two arctic circles, and in the arc which stands obliquely
to the equator, the ecliptic . . . If the balls were of the year
1500 B.C. it might be said that at that time there may have lived in
Japan, China, Babylon, and Egypt students who knew how to infer from the phenomena of the heavens the most important circles ;
but such knowledge could at that time scarcely have passed over
to the Greeks, or even to Troy" {Troja, p. 129). The fact of the finding of the ball in the ruins of the " second
city" at Hissarlik, and the other fact that this city belonged to a
far back pre-historical time being admitted, I am not in any way concerned here to debate the
question of the local standard
of astronomical knowledge.
The next illustration is the top
of a millstone-shaped whorl. No. 1956, on which one may perhaps see very rude repre
sentations "on the flat" of such balls as 1986. The only other suppositions that occur to me are that they may be separate
constellations, or else that they 1556. maybe meant for the cakes used
in sacrificial banquets to the heavens deity ; the symbolic marking
of such cakes being a matter of notoriety everywhere. The
next ball to be mentioned is 245 of Ilios, with which Dr.

Schmidt declines to deal {Troja, p. 129). On the supposition that the ball is meant to represent the Universe, the seven upper zones



Whorls.'] Whorls. 1027
may be the seven heavens, and the lower the seven hells ; the zone
with dots may (or may not) stand for the starry sphere, and the central belt with its mixed suastikas on which I have already dwelt may be intended for the central habitable earth. As the matterof-fact Horatio says to the dreamy Hamlet, perhaps " 'twere to consider too curiously to consider so." No. 309 is the top of a vasecover from Ilios, and here again I think we may admit that there are reminiscences of zones and constella
tions, with perhaps a pair of rivers ; for
I incline to the heaven-river rather than
the lightning theory of all these zig-zags. In the whorl No. 1954 we have also
astrological signs, and perhaps, as before pointed out, heavenly mountains. No.
1969, rude as it is, must in all probability be placed in the same list, and there are
a variety of others, with which I must not now overburden this already too lengthy section of my book ; referring students to Dr. Schliemann's own seductive though
weighty pages. I shall wind up with the important ball or sphere
1999 which exhibits the suastika, the world-tree and a host of
constellations. The ball is represented whole and also in the detail
of its eight right spherical triangles. " It appears very probable,"
wrote Dr. Schliemann {Troja, p. 128), "that the primitive artist intended to represent on these, as well as on numerous similar
terra-cotta balls found by me at Hissarlik, the starry heavens."
I trust that under the headings. Wheel, Buddha's Footprint, Suastika, and Whorls, I have now presented such a considerable
body of facts of similar tendency as to justify me in ascribing, with some probability, to the decoration of many of Dr. Schliemann's Hissarlik antiquities an origin consonant with an extremely remote
worship of the heavens, the starry spheres, their revolution, and their god and gods. The symbolism of a few of the objects may speak to some, of a contemporaneous, or a long prior science of astronom}\ which was well advanced. An incredibly ancient and accurate system of celestial lore may have vanished, just as the Trojan art of soldering gold to gold without silver or borax is lost {Troja,
p. 109) ; but for my part I am content to attribute much of all this



I028 The Night of the Gods. [ Whorls.
inexact symbolism to popular faith, to a supremely engrossing belief in sacred astrology and in the equally venerated cosmo
gonies of a —then as now— mysterious and perhaps too attractive
past.



Ragy.'\ Rao-s. 1029
APPENDIX.
Rags.
IN the Abbe Des Godins' work on Thibet is mentioned a
Lamaist practice of hanging up rags as an offering. Heaps of stones called dobongs are piled up along the roads and surmounted by a faggot of branches hung with scraps of stuff. Mr. W. G. Aston, who has drawn my attention to this passage, adds that similar heaps of stones are found in Corea (where he was Consul-General), but the rags there are attached to some bush overhanging the road. Old sacred trees with heaps of stones round them are very common along Korean roads. To its branches hang rags. " The spot is called Son Wang Don or the home of
the King of the fairies."^ A similar record is met with in the Abbe Hue's well-known
Travels^ ; where he mentions the obos or " Buddhic monuments " consisting of piled-up stones surmounted by dried branches of
trees from which hang strips of cloth, flags, and bones, covered with Thibetan and Mongol sentences. The sentences are no
doubt Buddhist sacred formulas, but we may decline to admit that the heaps of stones were originally Buddhistic. These monuments are sometimes of some magnitude, for Hue mentions his dining on a pipe of tobacco in the shade of a large stone Obo. Elsewhere (i, 25) Hue gives us probably the true origin of the Obos when
he says the Tartars resort to them to worship the Spirit of the Mountain ; and they reminded him of the loca cxcclsa denounced
by the Jewish prophets. Chardin was one of the first to draw attention to such trees.
At Shiraz he saw an old tree to the branches of which were hung chaplets amulets, and pieces of garments. Lighted tapers were

fixed to it, and incense burned, for the sick. He said there were such trees everywhere in Persia, and they were also stuck full of
nails for holding clothing and other tokens.^ Pococke saw at Derb-cl-Hammcrf?) between Suez and Cairo a sacred tree covered with rags by the Mecca pilgrims.^ Virgil makes the Trojan
sailors hang garments to the sacred olive-tree of the Laurentincs. The passage in Horace is almost two well-known to need quoting.
Me tabula sacer Votiva paries indicat uvida Suspendisse potenti Vestimenta maris deo. {Odes, i, 5.)
Pliny (xvi, 44) mentions the Roman tree on which, time
immemorial, the vestal virgins hung their tresses, when shorn at their consecration. This is a notion which reminds one somewhat of the gohei paper-strips of the Japanese. And we can scarcely
separate from the clothes-offerings those of weapons which
Theophrastus (according to Pliny, xvi, 39) said had been hung so long to a wild olive-tree on the market-place of Megara that the bark had grown round them. There is sometimes to be seen in the Egyptian desert the trunk
of an old tree, or a pole secured in a heap of stones, and ornamented with old rags, each pilgrim who passes adding a rag to it. The Shilluks of the White Nile ornament with pieces of cloth and glass
pearls the tree consecrated to the father of their race, Nickam.
Dwarf, stunted trees are found farther West in Northern Africa,
where they are called Marabout trees, and to them the afflicted
transfer, as to a sort of scape-goat, their diseases and complaints by
attaching a rag of their garments. A very remarkable tree is a tamarisk called the mother of rags, Um-esh-sharamat near Suez. Dr. Schliemann saw a plane-tree, overshadowing a hot marsh-bath at Lugia Hammam in the Troad, covered with rags of clothing.
{Troja, p. 325-) The custom of placing ex-voto offerings, generally pieces torn
from the garments, on or near the tomb of a holy person, prevails throughout the East. Frequently the branches of a neighbouring tree, and the iron grating of the windows of the resting-place of a saint, are completely covered with such relics. . . . Saints abound among the Kurds . . . the burial ground near the fountain of Akra was made gay by the many-coloured shreds

and remnants of old garments which fluttered like streamers from
the tall headstones.* Throughout Constantinople, on the windows of the tombs of saints, pieces of rags are tied, and called nezr, vows.^ Rag-offerings
of shreds from raiment still hang on the sacred trees, and the
tombs of Moslem saints in Syria'^ ; and I may add, as to the tombs,
in Cyprus. It is well known that the Irish peasants, especially the women, to this day cover the trees and bushes at sacred spots
particularly near a iobar or holy well with shreds and scraps, and
all sorts of miscellaneous nothings. And this is a further con
nection of Irish devotional practices in pilgrimages with those of
Eastern countries, which the reader is requested to add on to the
ailithre at p. 272 and the pillar-stone worship at p. 275.
In Mr. E. M. Satovv's article in the Westminster Review iox July, 1878,* it is pointed out that at the great yearly Shinto "sweepingfestival of purification, the Ohobarai, the clothing of the penitent
was destroyed. At the half-yearly similar festival, the Mikado was measured for clothes which were at first thrown into running water
but eventually appropriated by the servitors. It is also found that iron (wire ?) figures were dressed-up and thrown-into rivers ; and this doubtless had a common origin with the easier custom.
In A.D. 810, horses, swords, bows and arrows, food, peltry, utensils,
thread, and other things were offered in expiation. These were
similar to the ordinary offerings, made in propitiation of the gods. When the officiating priest at the Ohobarai had arranged the offerings, he turned round to the people and waved a sort of broom made of grass, to symbolise the sweeping-away of the offences. The harai was performed on the 3rd of March (says one authority)
which would connect it with that annual rite so feared by book
worms, the English " spring-cleaning." Painting London shops in
holy week, and wearing new clothes at Easter in the Greek church, or at JF/^/Vt'-Sunday with us, are observances of the same character.
This connection with the spring-cleaning is far from being matter for mere mirth, and it must be added that Saturday is called washing-day in Norse, Danish, and Swedish (laugar-dagr, lovcrdag,

lordag) because it was that of the weekly washing or purifying of the house in honour of the heavens-god of waters, Niordr.^ The Japanese Ohobarai thus, too, resembles the Jewish
taschlikh, casting offences into the water, which was practised also
by the Christians of Petrarch's time at Cologne.- The Peruvian
citua-raymi purification-feast also fell in the Spring (September).
P^ebruary was the purification month with the Romans—the
purification of the B.V. Mary still falls on the second of the
month. Dionysius of Halicarnassus is the authority for the abolition by Hercules of human sacrifices to Saturn ; for them he substituted
the casting of 24 (12 x 2) zodiacal men of men of straw into the
Tiber instead of the 24 old men of flesh and blood (such as it was) tied hand and foot, who had been theretofore drowned in its
yellow flood. These straw, or rather rush, dummies were committed to the waters by the Vestals in presence of the pontiffs and
magistrates shortly after the spring equinox, or rather at the ides
of May, from the sacred Sublicius bridge, that is the bridge of
sublicae, posts or piles, attributed to Ancus Martius, that is the
ancus or servant of Mars (a parallel to the Arabic Abd-AUah, etc.), who was grandson of Numa (see p. 719) and fourth king-god of Rome. These lay-figures were called scirpea [that is, of reeds or
rushes] imago (Ovid : Fast, v, 659) or scirpea simulacra.
Turn quoque priscorum virgo simulacra virorum Mittere roboreo scirpea ponte solent. {Ibid., v, 621.)
These figures were also called Argei, a word which has been fully dealt with at p. 807. [It is well worth while to repeat here again that the reed or rush, ashi, plays a primary part in Japanese Cosmogony. It was the first form in which life appeared ; was deified as the mikoto Kuni-toko-tachi (country-place-stand) ; and gave
its name to Japan, the central land of the Reed-expanse— Ashi-hara no naka tsu Kuni. I believe the reed to be a symbol of the axis, and the Reed-expanse to be the heavens-universe around it.] There is a similar custom to the Roman one in Burgundy to this day at the Spring carnival ; but the straw counterfeits are set on fire before they are thrown in. Thereupon M. Eugene Beau
vois^ has suggested that carnis levamen, relief of the flesh —the
derivation of carnival which he recognises— referred in fact to this

supreme relief from sacrificial death. But, not to be too tender with the human nature of Romans or Burgundians, one cannot
help a sly belief that the carni-v-al was originality a " No. i " canni
balistic orgie, a carni-vorous/^j//-pot feast of the highest kind ; and that the ending of the word is simply and solely linguistic, as in festi-v-al This would be bringing closer together the two debateable words carnival and cannibal (of which the latest theories are
stated at their best in Littr6 and Skeat). The pilae or woollen figures of men which were offered to the
Lares in the annual feast of the compitalia, at the " ambulation "
(Cicero, Att, ii, 3) of the compiti or cross-roads, were said by
Macrobius to have replaced the actual sacrifice of little children.
But that they also replaced men and women is clearly seen from Paulus Grammaticus (ex Fast, p. 239, ed. Miiller) who calls them
" pilae et effigies viriles et muliebris ex lana " . . . ut [Lares]
vivis parcerent et essent his pilis et simulacris contenti. Were these figures implied or impaled ? They were hung-up at the cross-roads, a spot which must be taken as representative of the centre of the wheel from which the spokes or roads radiate. And the hieroglyphic determinant for " a town or inhabited place " ^ @ must now clearly, I think, be taken as " the cross-roads " ; which
would give us the typical terrestrial city as a representative of the
central heavens-city. This of course gives us another connection with the Suastika. The beating of children at perambulations
may also be a survival of the sacrifices of Macrobius. The Gauls seem even to have burnt human victims at the summer solstice in wicker cages of human form ; and the custom of burning cats and other things in baskets on St. John's Day succeeded to this.- In China, straw dolls or wooden figures to
represent deceased ancestors, preceded the present wooden tablets
(Shin Chu)'^ in which the ancestral spirits actually reside.
I would suggest, therefore, that the drowning of clothes or of a
clothed figure in Japan, represents an older and forgotten custom
of drowning human expiators ; and that we have a clear parallel to the human sacrifices at Japanese graves, called '* following the
dead," when a row of live retainers was planted round the burial
mound. This too was succeeded by clay figures of men, of horses,
and of various other things.''

In the Li-Ki figures of straw and wood, and carriages made of clay, were buried ; and Confucius approved of the straw, but condemned the wood, lest it might lead back to burying live men ; and
a proposal to revert to this custom is recorded in the Li-Ki as not having been adopted ;^ from which record we may conclude that the practice had then died or was dying out. Living slaves were buried with deceased Fijian chiefs, which in
their case was a dead loss of good " long pig " (a straight translation of the Fijian puaka balava ; pork being puaka dina or real). The Vaishnavas, that is Vishnu-worshippers, of Kalna in the
Burdwan district still offer effigies of buffaloes in their Durga-pujah.
Old families of the sect of the Vamacharis still sacrifice ^.t the Durga and Kali pujahs a foot-long effigy of a man made of dried milk
(khira). In the Eastern districts of Bengal this is frequent ; and
the image is actually stabbed and hacked to pieces secretly at mid
night by all the grown-up members of the family. It is called
satrubali or enemy-sacrifice."
The Gohei. As to these puzzling Japanese emblems, it has already been seen that peltry and thread were among the expiatory
purification offerings. These may have represented the clothing, which itself had represented the victim. But as these are found
with a great variety of other offerings, which can in no way be connected with clothing, considerable caution is required in drawing
any general conclusion. Mr. E. M. Satow says distinctly that the gohei or strips of white paper seen on wands in Shinto temples descend from the offerings of cloth fastened to a branch of the
sacred tree (Ma saka-ki) the cleyera, in ancient times f adding that the cloth was made of hemp, of wistaria, of paper-mulberry bark, and of silk. Mr. B, H. Chamberlain* says the early Japanese made off"erings of blue hempen cloth and of white paper-mulberry
bark-cloth, which have degenerated into strips of paper.
Mr. Aston suggests^ that the offerings of rags, like the Japanese
paper slips called gohei, are survivals of offerings of garments or cloth to some anthropomorphic deity. He thinks the evidence
about the gohei representing cloth is quite conclusive" ; and he

adds that the shaven sticks of the Ainu of Yeso are also found in the northern part of Japan proper.
In the Yeiigis/iiki {lOth century) is mentioned the provision of many hundreds of pieces of cloth, of catties of hemp, and of sheets
oi paper (whence we may at all events establish the antiquity of paper in Japan) with thin silk of the five colours.^ Skins and pieces of silk are mentioned as archaic Chinese offerings in the Li-Ki. At Fukugawa in Japan, small bundles of straw are bought by Buddhist pilgrims and worshippers at the temple-gate. They dip these wisps in water, and with them brush the image of Shogio Booatsu. The straw bundles are then hung up as offerings.^ The fibres of the paper-mulberry were hung up in the Mikado's hall and kitchen at the Luck-wishing of the palace (oho to no hogahi).^
A force de chercher toujours on trouve quelquefois. There is at the supremely sacred shrine of Ise "a tree called Soyogi, supposed to be hallowed by the presence of the two gods." Soyogi ought to
be here for Soyoki, that is Soyo-tree. But Soyogi ^ means to
flutter in the wind, Soyo ^ means gently, and So was an archaic word for gentl}^ Can the gohei paper-strips on the long wand
have ever represented the fluttering leaves of a tree, and not offerings attached thereon ? Another idea altogether is not without its recommendations. The Maratha god Bhairava (who is equated with Shiva) is surrounded in the sacred pictures by " attendants bearing the chamara or chauri, a kind of wisp made of ivory shavings, or sandalwood shavings, or yak's tails ; and used as a symbol of royalty and
divinity all over India.^ " The horse-tail or fly-flapper of the
Turkish pasha is doubtless a similar object. Can the gohei be a separate and unvulgarised survival of the same symbolism ? And, if so, what does that symbolism mean ? In that case we should be driven to the theory of its being a survival of horse-god worship, of a period when the centaurs were gods of the archaic Greek, when the aswamcdha or horse-sacrifice was the acme of supremest ritual
in India, and when the now m\'stcrious flaying of a pie-bald horse backwards in legendary Japan was explicable. Sacred white
