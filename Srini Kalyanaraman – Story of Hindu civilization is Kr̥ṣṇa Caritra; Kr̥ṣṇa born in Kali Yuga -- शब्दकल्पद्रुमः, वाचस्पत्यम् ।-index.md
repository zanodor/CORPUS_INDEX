https://www.britannica.com/topic/Krishna-Hindu-deity Abstract The movement against colonial supremacy in India, from the days of its origin, emphasized self-determination. The earliest of the Indian nationalist leaders—the intelligentsia of colonial India—had to assert an „original‟ identity while reacting against colonialism. Assertion of the Self was the only way to counter the intellectual, cultural and political threat posed by colonialism. This new Self had to be powerful, confident, assertive, grand and greater than the colonizer. Emphasizing the belief of a glorious and ancient „Indian‟ civilization was one of the ways in which this challenge was met. The idea of an ancient and once glorious India brought a symbolic value of resilience with it. A primordial Indian civilization became an irresistible fantasy for the early Indian nationalists. They believed that the Indian nation is a given and therefore their nationality is predestined. However, this India that was imagined (at least to an extent) but believed to have been rediscovered was unmistakably a Hindu civilization.

It is not possible to date the events in the life of Śrī K ̥rṣṇa between 3102 and 3067 BCE since MBh text does not provide precise astronomical skymaps of events related to Śrī K ̥rṣṇa. However, some key dates are indicated:
Śrī K ̥rṣṇa war born in 3112 BCE.
The MBh war after 13 years of exile of Pāṇḍava occurs in 3067 BCE when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa and Arjuna are both 45 years of age. This means hat the exile started in 3080 BCE (3067 + 13).

Śrī K ̥rṣṇa slays Kamsa in 3102 BCE when Śrī K ̥rṣṇa was a kiśora, youth of 11 years' age. This defining moment of the avatāra matches with the planetary skymap which becomes the start date of Kali yuga.
Bhima overpowered Jarasandha, the ruler of Magadha, after a long duel and almost took Jarasandha to death but Bhima was unable to kill Jarasandha. When Bhima looked at Krishna

for guidance, Krishna picked a twig and dissected it into two halves, and threw the parts in opposite directions. Bhima complied with his instructions and dissected the body of Jarasandha.
