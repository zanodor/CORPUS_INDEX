sēṇa, کار کنده kār-kunda are Indus Script hypertexts,signify āhan gar, b'lacksmith', maker of asaṇi, vajrāśani thunderbolt weapon, manager of kiln. The pair of eagle-heads signify dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting'. Thus,metal casting blacksmith. The winged tiger: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron' kolhe 'smelter' PLUS kambha 'wing' rebus: kammata 'mint'. baḍhia 'a castrated boar, a hog'(Santali) বরাহ barāha 'boar' Rebus: baḍhi 'worker in wood and iron' (Santali) bāṛaï 'carpenter' (Bengali) bari 'merchant' barea 'merchant' (Santali) vāḍhī, 'one who helps a merchant. Thus, the hypertexts on the silver gold foil shaft-hole axe constitute metalwork catalogues.
Shaft-hole axhead with a double-headed eagle ligatured to a human body, boar,and winged tiger, late 3rd–early 2nd millennium BCE Central Asia
(Bactria-Margiana) Silver, gold foil; 5 7/8 in. (15 cm) “Western Central Asia, now known as Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and northern Afghanistan, has yielded objects attesting to a highly developed civilization in the late third and early second millennium B.C. Artifacts from the region indicate that there were contacts with Iran to the southwest. Tools and weapons, especially axes, comprise a large portion of the metal objects from this region. This shaft-hole axhead is a masterpiece of three-dimensional and relief sculpture. Expertly cast in silver and gilded with gold foil, it depicts a bird-headed hero grappling with a wild boar and a winged dragon. The idea of the heroic bird-headed creature probably came from western Iran, where it is first documented on a cylinder seal impression. The hero's muscular body is human except for the bird talons that replace the hands and feet. He is represented twice, once on each side of the ax, and consequently appears to have two heads. On one side, he grasps the boar by the belly and on the other, by the tusks. The posture of the boar is contorted so that its bristly back forms the shape of the blade. With his other talon, the bird-headed hero grasps the winged dragon by the neck. The dragon, probably originating in Mesopotamia or Iran, is represented with folded wings, a feline body, and the talons of a bird of prey.”

This note suggests that the place names in India of Dharwad and Ib are related to nearby iron ore regions and lived in by iron workers. The names are derived from two etyma streams: 1 dhāū, dhāv m.f. ʻa partic. soft red stoneʼ.
This suggestion is premised on a Marathi gloss (Prakritam, Meluhha pronunciation) cognate with dhātu: dhāū, dhāv m.f. ʻa partic. soft red stoneʼ (Marathi) dhāˊtu n. ʻ substance ʼ RV., m. ʻ element ʼ MBh., ʻ metal, mineral, ore (esp. of a red colour) ʼ Mn., ʻ ashes of the dead ʼ lex., ʻ *strand of rope ʼ (cf. tridhāˊtu -- ʻ threefold ʼ RV., ayugdhātu -- ʻ having an uneven number of strands ʼ KātyŚr.). [√dhā]Pa. dhātu -- m. ʻ element, ashes of the dead, relic ʼ; KharI. dhatu ʻ relic ʼ; Pk. dhāu -- m. ʻ metal, red chalk ʼ; N. dhāu ʻ ore (esp. of copper) ʼ; Or. ḍhāu ʻ red chalk, red ochre ʼ (whence ḍhāuā ʻ reddish ʼ; M. dhāū, dhāv m.f. ʻ a partic. soft red stone ʼ (whence dhā̆ vaḍ m. ʻ a caste of iron -smelters ʼ, dhāvḍī ʻ composed of or relating to iron ʼ); -- Si. dā ʻ relic ʼ; -- S. dhāī f. ʻ wisp of fibres added from time to time to a rope that is being twisted ʼ, L. dhāī ̃ f.(CDIAL 6773) whence dhā̆ vaḍ m. ʻa caste of iron -- smeltersʼ, dhāvḍī ʻ composed of or relating to iron ʼ); dhātu n. ʻ substance ʼ RV., m. ʻ element ʼ 2. ib 'iron' kara +iba, karba 'iron'. For example, the place name Dharwad is relatable to dhāvaḍ 'iron-smelters'. Archaeological explorations near Dharwad and Ib may indicate evidences for iron smelting.
This etymon indicates the possible reading of the tall flagpost carried by kneeling persons with six locks of hair: baTa 'six' Rebus: bhaTa 'furnace'. Associated with nAga 'serpent' Rebus: nAga 'lead'

Location of Lagash. At the time of Hammurabi, Lagash was located near the shoreline of the gulf. Indus Script unravels announcement of metals caravensarai, evidence of 11 ft. tall copper plated flagpost from Girsu (Telloh), Ancient Near East http://tinyurl.com/oflxfcq



9
Girsu (Tlloh) archaeological find. 11 ft. tall copper plated flagpost. This may relate to a period when
Girsu (ca. 2900-2335 BCE) was the capital of Lagash at the time of Gudea.
Such a flagpost is seen on a Gudea cup, held by Mus-hussu (dragon):
It was constructed of a tubular wooden core with copper plate around that and bitumen acting as a sealant and adhesive, they seen to have laid the upper length alongside the lower to include all in frame, but also lain what looks like a metallic strip alongside which would seemingly have been related, there may also be copper cable emerging from the base.
So it was a fantastic discovery and i don't know where they've hidden it since, but anyway it sort of begs the question what was it for, like i mentioned i think it would have stood alongside the Abzu shrine because that's were i've seen examples.
The one who holds it i think is Lahmu the gatekeeper of the Abzu who being associated with that threshold was understood as the muddy one, the intermediate state between liquid and solid, it has then associations with water.



10
Because of it's association with passageway through the Abzu it might have been understood as in some way conducive to facilitating such transition, if any practical usage could have been made of it.
Other examples of it's usage can be intriguing such as here were the half serpent Deity Istaran touches the tip of his serpentine tail against the semi circular appendage, that suggests some form of magical power associated with it;



11
Here a very curious example of a shrine probably seen representing the Southerly gateway into the Heavens with the arc across the horizons perhaps representing the transit of Venus represented by the floret
So there we are they discovered the magical standard of the God Lahmu that facilitated entrance into the Abzu and then mislaid it somewhere or turned it in for scrap, weird... http://www.abovetopsecret.com/forum/thread1079637/pg1



12
On this cylinder seal, the flagposts with rings are shown together with hieroglyphs of: a person carrying an antelope (like the hioeroglyph shown on Shu-ilishu Meluhha translator cylinder seal), overflowing water, fishes, crucible, mountain range, sun (Source: http://enenuru.net/html/gal/urukprocexpl.htm)



13
The context of metalwork is seen from the 'scarf' hieroglyph: dhatu 'scarf' Rebus: dhatu 'mineral'.
The context of a smithy/forge is seen from the 'ring' hieroglyph: koṭiyum [koṭ, koṭī neck] a wooden circle put round the neck of an animal (Gujarati) Rebus: ācāri koṭṭya = forge, kammārasāle (Tulu)
Two types of flagposts are seen in some Ancient Near East artifacts in the context of metalwork: 1. reedpost with scarf; and 2. reedpost with ring.
Hieroglyph: Ta. eruvai European bamboo reed; a species of Cyperus; straight sedge tuber. Ma. eruva a kind of grass.(DEDR 819) Rebus: Ta. eruvai blood, (?) copper. Ka. ere a dark-red or dark-brown colour, a dark or dusky colour (DEDR 817)
The reedpost with scarf occurs in a pair: dula 'pair' Rebus: dul 'cast metal' and denotes the warehouse which receives ingots of cast metal.
The reedpost with ring occurs on a jasper cylinder seal with four holders of four reedposts. The holders have six locks of hair as semantic determinatives. Hieroglyph:
पेंडें [ pēṇḍēṃ ] n (पेड) A loop or ring.Rebus: पेठ or पेंठ (p. 527) [ pēṭha or pēṇṭha ] f ( H) A
manufacturing or trading town, an emporium, a mart: also a markettown. pēṭhpēṭaka 'caravanserai'. The hieroglyph multiplexed signify a caravensarai from a trading emporium or trading town of copper, metal implements and products from smithy/forge.
Hieroglyph: bata 'six' Rebus: bhata 'furnace'.
Hieroglyph: मेढा (p. 665) [ mēḍhā ] A twist or tangle arising in thread or cord, a curl or
snarl.(Marathi. Molesworth)Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meḍ 'iron' (Mu.Ho.). Thus the hieroglyph
multiplex signifies iron furnace. मेधा = yajña, धन (नैघण् टु क , commented on by यास्क . ii ,
10.)
On the jasper cylinder seal the four reedpost holders (with six hair curls) are signified by semantic determinatives of four hieroglyphs: 1. crucible PLUS storage pot of ingots, 2. sun, 3. narrow-necked pot with overflowing water, 4. fish
A hooded snake is on the edge of the composition. (The dark red color of jasper reinforces the semantics: eruvai 'dark red, copper' Hieroglyph: eruvai 'reed'; see four reedposts held.
1. Hieroglyph: OP. koṭhārī f. ʻ crucible ʼ(CDIAL 3546) Rebus: koṭhār 'treasury, warehouse' 2. Hieroglyph: arka 'sun' (Kannada) Rebus: arka, eraka 'copper' 3. Hieroglyph: overflowing pot: lokhaNDa 'overflowing pot' Rebus: lokhANDa 'metalware, pots and pans of metal, metal implements'



14
4. Hieroglyph: aya 'fish' Rebus: aya 'iron' ayas 'metal' (Rigveda)
Thus, the four holders of four reedposts with attached ring display metalwork of a smithy/forge announcing metal imlements, iron, copper and iron.
On many hierolyph multiplexes, water-buffalo (rãgo) is associated with kANDa 'overflowing water'. The rebus renderings are: rāṅgā khaNDA 'zinc alloy implements'. The semantics of khaNDa 'implements' is attested in Santali: me~r.he~t khaNDa 'iron implements'.
Santali glosses
A lexicon suggests the semantics of Panini's compound अयस ्--काण्ड [p= 85,1] m. n. " a
quantity of iron " or " excellent iron " , (g. कस्का *दद q.v.)( Pa1n2. 8-3 , 48)(Monier
Williams).
From the example of a compound gloss in Santali, I suggest that the suffix -kANDa in Samskritam should have referred to 'implements'. Indus Script hieroglyphs as hypertext components to signify kANDa 'implements' are: kANTa, 'overflowing water' kANDa, 'arrow' gaNDa, 'four short circumscript strokes'.
See: http://bharatkalyan97.blogspot.in/2015/08/ancient-near-east-cylinder-seal.html A few Ancient Near East cylinder seals of Metropolitan Museum are presented in this note identifying Indus Script hieroglyphs used on the artefacts.

Red jasper H. 1 1/8 in. (2.8 cm), Diam. 5/8 in. (1.6 cm) cylinder Seal with four hieroglyphs and four kneeling persons (with six curls on their hair) holding flagposts, c. 2220-2159 B.C.E., Akkadian (Metropolitan Museum of Art) Cylinder Seal (with modern impression). The four hieroglyphs are: from l. to r. 1. crucible PLUS storage pot of ingots, 2. sun, 3. narrow-necked pot with overflowing water, 4. fish A hooded snake is on the edge of the composition. (The dark red color of jasper reinforces the semantics: eruvai 'dark red, copper' Hieroglyph: eruvai 'reed'; see four reedposts held.
The four posts held on this jasper cylinder seal compares with similar posts shown on
some other cylinder seals. They may signify: पेंढें ‘rings’ Rebus: पेढी ‘shop’.
The leftmost hieroglyph shows ingots in a conical-bottom storage jar (similar to the jar shown on Warka vase (See Annex: Warka vase), delivering the ingots to the temple of Inanna). Third from left, the overflowing pot is similar to the hieroglyph shown on Gudea statues. Fourth from left, the fish hieroglyph is similar to the one shown on a Susa pot containing metal tools and weapons. (See Susa pot hieroglyphs of bird and fish: Louvre Museum) Hieroglyph: meṇḍā ʻlump, clotʼ (Oriya) On mED 'copper' in Eurasian languages see Annex A: Warka vase).

On mED 'copper' in Eurasian languages:
Wilhelm von Hevesy wrote about the Finno-Ugric-Munda kinship, like "Munda-MagyarMaori, an Indian link between the antipodes new tracks of Hungarian origins" and "Finnisch-Ugrisches aus Indien". (DRIEM, George van: Languages of the Himalayas: an ethnolinguistic handbook. 1997. p.161-162.) Sumerian-Ural-Altaic language affinities have been noted. Given the presence of Meluhha settlements in Sumer, some Meluhha glosses might have been adapted in these languages. One etyma cluster refers to 'iron' exemplified by meD (Ho.). The alternative suggestion for the origin of the gloss med 'copper' in Uralic languages may be explained by the word meD (Ho.) of Munda family of Meluhha language stream: Sa. <i>mE~R~hE~'d</i> `iron'. ! <i>mE~RhE~d</i>(M).
Ma. <i>mErhE'd</i> `iron'.

There is a possibility that the hieroglyph was intended to convey the message of an alloying metal like lead or tin or zinc which had revolutionized the bronze age with tinbronzes, zinc-copper brass and other alloys to substitute for arsenical copper to make hard weapons and tools. It is instructive that zinc was called tuthunāg which might have referred to the sublimate of zinc and calamine collected in the furnaces in Zawar.

Stone-smithy guild on a Meluhha standard
Harappa Tablet. Pict-91 (Mahadevan) m0490At m0490B Mohenjodaro Tablet showing Meluhha combined standard of three standards carried in a procession, comparable to Tablet m0491. m0491 Tablet. Line drawing (right). This tablet showing



25
three hieroglyphs may be called the Meluhha standard.Combined reading for the joined or ligatured glyphs
Rebus reading is: dhatu kõdā sangaḍa ‘mineral, turner, stone-smithy guild’.
Dawn of the bronze age is best exemplified by this Mohenjo-daro tablet which shows a procession of three hieroglyphs carried on the shoulders of three persons. The hieroglyphs are: 1. Scarf carried on a pole (dhatu Rebus: mineral ore); 2. A young bull carried on a stand kõdā Rebus: turner; 3. Portable standard device (Top part: lathegimlet; Bottom part: portable furnace sãgāḍ Rebus: stonecutter sangatarāśū ). sanghāḍo (Gujarati) cutting stone, gilding (Gujarati); sangsāru karaṇu = to stone (Sindhi) sanghāḍiyo, a worker on a lathe (Gujarati)
The procession is a celebration of the graduation of a stone-cutter as a metal-turner in a smithy/forge. A sangatarāśū ‘stone-cutter’ or lapidary of neolithic/chalolithic age had graduated into a metal turner’s workshop (koḍ), working with metallic minerals (dhatu) of the bronze age.
Three professions are described by the three hieroglyphs: scarf, young bull, standard device dhatu kõdāsãgāḍī Rebus words denote: ‘ mineral worker; metals turner-joiner (forge); worker on a lathe’ – associates (guild).
On this tablet, the standard on the very front is not clear.
It is surmised that this standard carried on the procession may be comparable to the standard shown on Tikulti-Ninurta I altar discovered in the Ashur temple.
This fourth standrd could be compared with this hieroglyph
of the Tikulti-Ninurta altar:



26
A spoked wheel is shown atop on the standard and the hieroglyph is also reinforced by depicting the hieroglyph on the top of the standard-bearer's head. This Meluhha hieroglyph is read rebus: eraka'knave of wheel' Rebus: 'moltencast copper'; āra 'spokes' Rebus: āra 'brass'.
Thus, the fourth profession is depicted as the smith working with metal alloys.
Thus, together the four professions depicted on the Mohenjodarostandard showing four
hieroglyphs in procession are read rebus:
Hieroglyph: dhatu 'scarf' Rebus: dhatu 'mineral'
Hieroglyph: kõdā 'young bull calf' Rebus: kõdā 'turner-joiner' (forge), worker on a lathe
Hieroglyph: sãgāḍī 'lathe (gimlet), portable furnace' Rebus: sãgāḍī 'metalsmith associates (guild)'
Hieroglyph eraka āra 'knave of wheel', 'spokes of wheel' Rebus: eraka āra 'copper alloy brass'
Thus Rebus readings of the four hieroglyphs denote: ‘ mineral worker; metals turnerjoiner (forge); worker on a lathe’ – associates (guild), copper alloy brass.
dhatu kõdā sãgāḍī eraka āra

Altar, offered by Tikulti-Ninurta I, 1243-1208 BC, in prayer before two deities carrying wooden standards, Assyria, Bronze AgeSource: http://www.dijitalimaj.com/alamyDetail.aspx?img=%7BA5C441A3-C178489B-8989-887807B57344%7D
[quote]Description: Although the cult pedestal of the Middle Assyrian king Tikulti-Ninurta mentions in its short inscription that it is dedicated to the god Nuska, the relief on the front that depicts the king in a rare kind of narrative, standing and kneeling in front of the very same pedestal was frequently discussed by art-historians. More strikingly on top of the depicted pedestal there is not the lamp, the usual divine symbol for the god Nuska, but most likely the representation of a tablet and a stylus, symbols for the god Nabû. (Klaus Wagensonner, University of Oxford)[unquote] http://cdli.ox.ac.uk/wiki/doku.php?id=pedestal_tukulti_ninurta
The hieroglyphs on the fire-altar confirm the link to metallurgy with the use of 'spokedwheel' banner carried on one side of the altar and the 'safflower' hieroglyph flanking the altar worshipped by Tikulti-Ninurta. It is rebus, as Sigmund Freud noted in reference to

Thus, the the two reed posts with a scarf as a flag signify: copper metal castings.
The same rebus readings as on the Warka vase are signified on the following Sumerian seal impression, relatedto the hieroglyphs of: goat, ram, fire-altar, a pair of reed posts with scarves, storage pots and ingots.

Two T symbols shown below the hieroglyphs of markhor and tiger on Warka vase. Ingot type 1: miṇḍāl 'markhor' (Tōrwālī) meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meD 'iron' (Santali.Mu.Ho.) med 'copper' (Slavic) Ingot type 2: kola 'tiger' rebus: kol 'working in iron'. Thus, 'cast iron ingots'
The T symbol on the vase also shows possibly fire on the altars superimposed by buningots. I suggest that the T hieroglyph reads: kand ‘fire-altar’ (Santali)
This narrative on the vase shows: 1..ram; 2. two storage vessels with ingots; 3. face of one-horned bull. The readings are: 1. meḍho a ram, a sheep (Gujarati)(CDIAL 10120) Rebus: mẽṛhẽt, meD 'iron' (Santali.Mu.Ho.); 2. dula 'pair' rebus: dul 'metal casting' PLUS kuṇḍa'pot' rebus: kuṇḍa 'firealtar' 3. mũh 'face' rebus: mũh 'ingot'
Rahman-dheri seal. Obverse: Two scorpions. Two holes. One T glyph. One frog in the middle. Reverse: two rams.
1. mūxā ‘frog’. Rebus: mũh ‘(copper) ingot’ (Santali)
2. bicha ‘scorpion’ (Assamese) Rebus: bica ‘stone ore’ (Mu.)

Indian ores are the richest in the world in iron content. Ib is the name of a railway station between Nagpur and Howrah. British set up the railway line to loot the ore wealth from Rourkela region. Ib is the source for 'nib' the writing instrument used by Gaṇeśa. Ib in

Santali means 'iron'. An expanded form is karibha 'elephant' karba 'iron' (Tulu.Kannada) I guess Dharwar itself is cognate dhā̄̆ vaḍ 'smelter'. Events of Ramayana are dated to 6th millennium BCE.Dharwars are also called gneiss rocks with relatively high presence of mafic minerals (those containing more magnesium and iron).
I agree with Jayasree Saranathan that Iron ore mines in Western Ghats find mention in Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa. So, it is wrong to say that iron was unknown to India before the
coming of invading/migrating Aryans. Rāmāyaṇa events are dated to ca. 6th millennium BCE. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCmRi3EHgEI

Excerpts from Jayasree's blogpost:
[Quote]Earlier Rama had met Agastya in the 11th year of his exile at his hermitage near Panchavati. On the 14th year we get to hear Sugreeva saying that Agastya is sitting on top of “Ayo mukha” Parvata from where one can go and see Kaveri in a receptacle. The parvata under reference is Western Ghats. Ayo Mukha refers to the iron ores found in the visages of the mountain. In the words of Sugreeva:
अयोमुखः च गंतव्यः पर्वतो धातु मण्डितः |(Valmiki Ramayana 4-41-13).
(The mountain having iron ore mines in the shape of mouths is reachable)



42
Sugreeva first refers to the iron-ore mouthed Malaya and then says that one can go to the receptacle of Kaveri from there. Agastya can be seen there, sitting on top of the
mountain. (क्ष्द्रयथ आदित्य संकाशम ् अगस्त त् यम ् ऋषि सत्त मम ्). (Valmiki Ramayana 4-41-16)

Dharwad is the district headquarters of Dharwad district in the state of Karnataka, India. It was merged with the city of Hubli in 1961 to form the twin cities of Hubli-Dharwad. It covers an area of 200.23 km2 and is located 425 km northwest of Bengaluru, onNH 4, between Bengaluru and Pune...The word "Dharwad" means a place of rest in a long travel or a small habitation. For centuries, Dharwad acted as a gateway between the Malenaadu (western mountains) and the Bayalu seeme (plains) and it became a resting place for travellers. Inscriptions found near Durga Devi temple in Narendra (a nearby village) and RLS High School date back to the 12th century and have references to Dharwad. This makes Dharwad at least 900 years old. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharwad The place is located in the region of hematite (iron ore) -- e.g. Sandur taluk.
dhAtu is a gloss which signifies metal, mineral, ore. It is likely that in early Bronze Age, the mineral specifically referred to is iron ore or meteoric iron as naturally occurring native, unsmelted metal called aduru, ayas. A gloss dhāvaḍ has the meaning: iron smelters. This gloss derived rom dhAtu can be explained in an archaeometallurgical
context with evidences from Indus Script Corpora.

The station derives its name from Ib River flowing nearby. Ib railway station came up with the opening of the Nagpur-Asansol main line of Bengal Nagpur Railway in 1891. It became a station on the crosscountry Howrah-Nagpur-Mumbai line in 1900 In 1900, when Bengal Nagpur Railway was building a bridge across the Ib River, coal was accidentally discovered in what later became Ib Valley Coalfield. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ib_railway_station

“The ancient site at Purola is located on the left bank of river Kamal in District Uttarkashi. The excavation carried out by Hemwati Nandan Bahuguna University, Srinagar Garhwal. The site yielded the remains of Painted Grey Ware (PGW) from the earliest level along with other associated materials include terracotta figurines, beads, potter-stamp and the dental and femur portions of domesticated horse (Equas Cabalus Linn). The most important finding from the site is a brick alter identified as Syena chiti by the excavator. The structure is in the shape of a flying eagle Garuda, head facing east with outstretched wings having a square chamber in the middle yielded the remains of pottery assignable to circa first century B.C. to second century AD along with copper coin of Kuninda , bone pieces and a thin gold leaf impressed with a human figure identified as Agni.” http://www.asidehraduncircle.in/excavation.html The first layer of a Vakrapaksa‐syena altar. The wings are made from 60 bricks of type “a,” and the body, head and tail from 50 type “b,” 6 of type “c” and 24 type “d” bricks. Each subsequent layer was laid out using different patterns of bricks with the total
number of bricks equaling 200. “Sênmurw (Pahlavi), SînaMrû (Pâzand), a fabulous, mythical bird. The name derives from Avestan mərəγô saênô ‘the bird Saêna’, originally a raptor, either eagle or falcon, as can be deduced from the



52
etymologically identical Sanskrit śyena.” Senmurv on the tomb of Abbess Theodote, Pavia early 8th c. “Griffin-like .Simurgh (Persian: سیمرغ ), also spelled simorgh, simurg, simoorg or simourv, also known as Angha (Persian: عنقا ), is the modern Persian name for a fabulous, benevolent, mythical flying
creature. The figure can be found in all periods of Greater Iranian art and literature, and is evident also in the iconography of medieval Armenia, the Byzantine empire , and other regions that were within the sphere of Persian cultural influence. Through cultural assimilation the Simurgh was introduced to the Arabic-speaking world, where the concept was conflated with other Arabic mythical birds such as the Ghoghnus, a bird having some mythical relation with the date palm, and further developed as the Rukh (the origin of the English word “Roc”).”http://www.flickr.com/photos/27305838@N04/4830444236/ See: http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/simorg See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simurgh
Sassanid silk twill textile of a simurgh in a beaded surround, 6-7th c. CE “The simurgh was considered to purify the land and waters and hence bestow fertility. The creature represented the union between the earth and the sky, serving as mediator and messenger between the two. The simurgh roosted in Gaokerena, the Hōm
(Avestan: Haoma) Tree of Life, which stands in the middle of the world sea Vourukhasa. The plant is potent medicine, is called all-healing, and the seeds of all plants are



53
deposited on it. When the simurgh took flight, the leaves of the tree of life shook making all the seeds of every plant to fall out. These seeds floated around the world on the winds of Vayu-Vata and the rains of Tishtrya, in cosmology taking root to become every type of plant that ever lived, and curing all the illnesses of mankind. The relationship between the simurgh and Hōm is extremely close. Like the simurgh, Hōm is
represented as a bird, a messenger and as the essence of purity that can heal any illness or wound. Hōm – appointed as the first priest – is the essence of divinity, a
property it shares with the simurgh. The Hōm is in addition the vehicle of farr(ah) (MP: khwarrah, Avestan: khvarenah, kavaēm kharēno) “[divine] glory” or “fortune”. Farrah in turn represents the divine mandate that was the foundation of a king’s authority.”
Archaeology in the landscapes of ancient Sogd has furnished us with a great amount of works of art, mainly from the early Middle Ages. Of highest value are the wall paintings from a palace hall (object 23, room 1) of the Sogdian ruler Varxuman at Samarqand (Afrasiab site)...
The western wall is the most important one in room 23/1 due to its position opposite the entrance. This feature seems to be common in Sogdian architectural layouts both of private main halls and palace throne rooms. Who is figure no. 4 of the western wall? (page II) The following proposal for an identification of figure 4 is certainly only an attempt. As we have seen, group A2 of delegates seems to belong to nations of the west. A second hint comes from the clothes of figure 4. The delicate ornamentation depicts fabulous beasts known as “Senmurvs”. Look below:
Left: The Senmurvs are set into an overall pattern of curved rhomboids.



54
Right: Close-up of the garment of figure 4 Originally more than hundred human figures must have been depicted on the walls of our room. Many of these persons are dressed with richly ornamented and multicoloured clothes. But it seems noteworthy that the Senmurv is, in contrary to other patterns, only to meet with figure 4 on the western wall. The reason for that must be the symbolic nature of the Senmurv. Speaking of this creature we concentrate only on the “dog-peackock” as depicted on the Afrasiab
murals. Doubtless it originates from Iranian symbolism. The most spectacular examples can be seen on the late Sasanian rock reliefs of Taq-e Bustan (Iran):



55
Left: Senmurvs as pattern on the caftan of a Sasanian king, Taq-e Bustan, Great Ivan, left wall.
Right: Senmurv in medaillon on the clothes of the heavy-armoured rider, Taq-e Bustan, Geat Ivan.



56
Comparing these images with the Senmurvs from Afrasiab we notice a striking similarity.
Apparently the Senmurv in Sasanian iconography was a symbol with intimate connection to kingship. Images concentrate on representations of royal persons and on royal silverware. Only in post-Sasanian times, when dynastic restrictions were lost, the Senmurv spread wide as a merely ornamental motif on Near and Middle Eastern textiles, metalwork, and so on. Concerning the Afrasiab murals we have a general date within the limits of the Sasanian dynasty (i.e., before 652), as we have tried to explain on another page.
Therefore, if the Senmurv (i.e., the “dog-peacock”!) was a Sasanian royal emblem, his appearance on the Afrasiab murals should point to the same symbolic value. In other words: The “owner” of the symbol should represent a Sasanian king. http://www.orientarch.uni-halle.de/ca/afras/text/w4b.htm

attack on part of the underside. Condition of gilding suggests that this is re-gilding. Dimensions : Diameter: 18.8 centimetres (rim)Diameter: 6.8 centimetres (interior, footring)Diameter: 7.3 centimetres (exterior, foot-ring)Height: 3.8 centimetres
Volume: 450 millilitresWeight: 541.5 grammes.
Hammered gilt silver plate with a low circular foot ring measuring 7.3 cm. across at the base; centering mark and extensive traces of old corrosion attack on the underside; single line engraved around the outside of the rim, with a second engraved line defining the interior. The plate was made by hammering, and decorated through a combination of chasing and punching, with thick gilding over the background. Early published references to the raised portion being embossed separately and added with solder are incorrect, and only the foot ring is soldered on. XRF analysis indicates that the body has a composition of 92% silver, 6.9% copper and 0.45% gold, and the foot has a slightly different composition of 93.4% silver, 5.4% copper and 0.5% gold. The decoration is limited to the interior and shows a composite animal with a dog’s head, short erect mane, vertical tufted ears and lion’s paws, facing left with a foliate spray dangling from its open mouth like a lolling tongue; a ruff-like circle of hair or fur frames its face; the neck, muscular shoulders and lower tail feathers are punched with an imbricated or overlapping wave design resembling feathers or scales; the breast is enriched with a foliated motif; a pair of wings with forward curling tips rise vertically from behind the shoulders, with a broad rounded peacock-like tail behind decorated with a bold foliate scroll and conventionally rendered by punching; below the tail, a second branch of foliage projects into the field. The foliate border is composed of overlapping leaves, on which are punched three divergent stems surmounted by berries in groups of three.
This plate is said to have been obtained in India prior to 1922 when it was purchased in London by the National Art Collections Fund on behalf of the British Museum. It is usually attributed to the 7th, 8th or early 9th century, thus is post-Sasanian, Umayyad or early Abbasid in political terms. Initially described as a hippocamp, peacock-dragon or peacock-griffin, most scholars follow Trever’s (1938) identification of this as a senmurw (New Persian simurgh), or Avestan Saena bird (cf. also Schmidt 1980). The iconographic features of a senmurw include the head of a snarling dog, the paws of a lion and the tail of a peacock, with the addition of the plant motifs on the tail or hanging out of the mouth being allusions to its role in regenerating plants. This bird is described in Pahlavi literature as nesting “on the tree without evil and of many seeds” (Menog-i Xrad 61.37-42), and scattering them in the rainy season to encourage future growth
(Bundahišn XVI.4). For this reason it was believed to bestow khwarnah (glory and good fortune), and particularly that of the Kayanids, the legendary ancestors of the Sasanians. This motif is first attested in a datable Sasanian context on the rock-cut grotto of Khusrau II (r. 591-628) at Taq-i Bustan, when it appears within embroidered roundels decorating the royal gown. The same motif recurs within a repeating pattern of conjoined pearl roundels depicted on silks from the reliquary of St Lupus and a tomb at Mochtchevaja Balka in the north Caucasus, a press-moulded glass inlay and vessel appliqué in the Corning Museum of Glass, metalwork, Sogdian murals, and the late Umayyad palace façade at Mshatta (e.g. Harper et al. 1978: 136, no. 60; Trever & Lukonin 1987: 115, pl. 73, no. 26; Overlaet ed. 1993: 270, 275-77, nos 119, 127-28). However, there are significant differences of detail between all of these, and a little



60
caution is necessary before making definite attributions of iconography, date or provenance. Many of the features are also repeated on the depiction of a horned quadruped depicted on a 7th century plate in the Hermitage (Trever & Lukonin 1987: 117-18, pl. 106, no. 36); most recently, Jens Kröger has reiterated the possibility of an early Abbasid date for the present plate, and observed that the distinctive decoration on the tail resembles the split palmette motifs on early Abbasid and Fatimid rock crystal.

Sulfide deposits frequently are a mix of different metal sulfides, such as copper, zinc, silver, lead, arsenic and other metals. (Sphalerite (ZnS2), for example, is not uncommon in copper sulfide deposits, and the metal smelted would be brass, which is both harder

and more durable than bronze.)The metals could theoretically be separated out, but the alloys resulting were typically much stronger than the metals individually.

The



73
inscriptional evidence discovered at this site which is on the crossroads of ancient bronze age civilizations attests to the possibility of Meluhha settlements in Shahdad, Tepe Yahya and other Elam/Susa region sites. The evolution of bronze age necessitated a writing system -- the answer was provided by Indus writing using hieroglyphs and rebus method of rendering Meluhha (mleccha) words of Indian sprachbund.
Shown are the glyphs of 1. zebu and 2. tigers which are also glyphs on Indus writing which I decode as related respectively to 1. blacksmithy on unsmelted metal (Adar Dhangar, zebu) 2. working with alloys (kol, tiger) !!! The tree is a smelter furnace (kuTi). The endless-knot motif is iron (meD, knot, iron).
The accounting system had advanced beyond bullae-tokens to a writing system to prepare stone-, metal-ware catalogs on thousands of inscriptions using mleccha language for Indus writing.

Emblem of Karnataka
Flag of Ghaznavid Empire 975 - 1187CE A
Napoleonic Eagle of the First Empire (Aigle Premier Empire Modèle 1804) A finelymade Eagle of 1804 Pattern, of cast bronze, chased and gilded, the head horizontal, with elongated half-open beak with tongue clearly visible in the lower part, the wings spread wide at the tips. The bird formed in two pieces : the front and back (including the left talon) fitted and soldered together, with separately-formed right talon. A thunderbolt attached at a slight angle, without lightning-flashes. Eagle and Thunderbolt mounted on a plinth of rectangular shape, the front and back each with four mounting-holes for Regimental number (numerals now missing, but probably originally 23, 27 or 29, although this is not certain). The underside of the plinth fitted with a plate and incorporating a cylindrical metal socket to receive a wooden staff (the socket now cut off flush with the base of the plinth). The Eagle stamped DLVI underneath the left talon, and with letter A under the right talon ; the underside of the Thunderbolt stamped DLVI followed by the letter A, the top of the plinth and the upper side of its baseplate both similarly stamped ; the shortened socket stamped A (the remainder of the DLVI mark not visible). Weight Overall weight : 1.8 kg Eagle : 1.3 kg Thunderbolt : 0.1 kg Plinth

Figs. 16, 17 It eagle emblem of the Romans sprouted a second
head and neck, becoming a double-headed eagle when the state/empire was divided by Hadrian into the western and eastern states. The eastern entity evolved to become know as the Byzantine empire, which maintained the double eagle motif until passing it on to the Eastern Orthodox church and the ruling dynasties that followed that church. In the double eagle emblem, while the birds shared their entire bodies all the way to the base of the neck, the faces look outward and away from each other as do the lions on the Median emblem (Figs 16-17). http://www.kurdistanica.com/?q=book/export/html/1

Annex: Warka Vase



82
Top register of Warka vase has a narrative. A couple is identified: a man is holding the face of a bull with his left hand and faces a palm-tree glyph. The accompanying woman is identified by a reed with scarf hanging from atop. The man and woman are standing on stools (or, frames of buildings). The next register below the couple shows an antelope.
The narrative reds: tagara 'antelope' Rebus damgar 'merchant', ḍaṅgara ʻcattle ʼrebus: ḍhangar ‘blacksmith’ (Hindi) dealing with tam(b)ra 'copper'eruvai dhatu 'copper mineral' stone,
Thus, merchant/blacksmith dealing with copper mineral stone and copper (metal) are

Palm-tree hieroglyph:
tamar, ‘palm tree, date palm’ the rebus reading would be: tam(b)ra, ‘copper’ (Pkt.)
Reed+scarf hieroglyph: eruvai dhatu 'copper mineral'.
eruvai European bamboo reed (Tamil) straight sedge tuber. Ma. eruva a kind of grass. (DEDR 819). Rebus 1: eruvai ‘copper’. dhaṭu ‘scarf’ (WPah.). Rebus: dhatu ‘mineral’ (Santali).
The frames of buildings used in the glyphic composition are hieroglyphs: sãgāḍā m. ʻ frame of a building ʼ (M.)(CDIAL 12859) Rebus 1: jangaḍiyo ‘military guards who accompanies treasure into the treasury’’ (G.) Rebus 2: sanghāḍo (G.) cutting stone, gilding (G.); san:gatarāśū = stone cutter; san:gatarāśi = stone-cutting; san:gsāru karan.u = to stone (S.) san:ghāḍiyo, a worker on a lathe (G.)
tagara ‘ram’ (Ta.) Rebus: tamkāru, damgar ‘merchant’ (Akk.)
The palm-tree hieroglyph on Warka vase compares with the palm-tree glyph of goat-fish ligatured hieroglyph on a ritual basin of Susa:

Vākyapadīya of Mohenjo-daro seal m1792
I submit that this seal is an emphatic evidence – a veritable Rosetta Stone -- for the lingua franca of the Bronze Age Meluhha writing system. All the words used in hypertext expressions of the Script corpora are Meluhha spoken forms, Vākyapadīya of a linguistic area, Bhāratīya sprachbund (language union) from ca. 5th millennium BCE Tin-Bronze Revolution. Further researches are needed to outline the formation and evolution of Bhāratīya language kaleidoscope.

The series of processions on a number of registers of the Warka Vase are metalwork proclamations by Meluhha artisans as the metal ingots get ddelivered to the storehouse or smithy/forge: kole.l 'smithy, forge' Rebus: kole.l 'temple' (Kota).
tamar, ‘palm tree, date palm’ the rebus reading would be: tam(b)ra, ‘copper’ (Pkt.)
Tin and iron ingots delivered to the temple with ligatured ‘reed-scarf’ standard:
tagara 'antelope' Rebus: tagara 'tin' + kola 'tiger' Rebus: kol 'iron'.
Scarf is a ligature hieroglyph on Ishtar's (aka Inanna's?) pair of reeds (gi[reed]) of Warka vase. Warka was known as Uruk to the ancient Sumerians. The reeds are also described as two looped temple poles or "asherah," symbolising entrance to a temple.
kole.l was a temple, the same lexeme was used for a smithy (Kota language). A cognate was kwala.l in Toda language. The mudhif shown on other artifacts of Sumer has the reed atop the roof. The mudhif is comparable to a Toda mund. I suggest that Toda mund is a cognate of mudhif.
The vase was discovered as a collection of fragments by German Assyriologists in their sixth excavation season at Uruk in 1933/1934. The find was recorded as find number W14873 in the expedition's field book under an entry dated 2 January 1934, which
read "Großes Gefäß aus Alabaster, ca. 96 cm hoch mit Flachrelief" ("large container of



95
alabaster, circa 96 cm high with flat-reliefs"). The vase, which showed signs of being repaired in antiquity, stood 3 feet, 1⁄4 inches (1 m) tall. The vase has three registers – or tiers – of carving.

Uruk trough. The carving on the side shows a procession of sheep (a goat and a ram) approaching a reed hut (of a type still found in southern Iraq) and two lambs emerging. The mudhif (Toda mund) is shown symbolised by a a prif of reeds with a hanging scarf atop either side of the roof.
Six circles decorated on the reed post are semantic determinants of hieroglyph: bhaṭa ‘six’. Rebus: bhaṭa ‘furnace’.
The association of the reed (with a curved loop) and a scarf hanging from the pole is thus emphatically associated with a temple, a mudhif (Toda mund) . The procession of quadrupeds emerging out of the mudhif are seen to represent pasara 'cattle' rebus: pasra 'smithy, forge'.

Meteoric iron is the only naturally occurring native metal of the element iron on the Earth's surface
Many examples of iron working from the Bronze Age have been confirmed to be meteoritic in origin.



106
• In ancient Egypt an iron metal bead was found in a graveyard near Gerzeh that contained 7.5% Ni. Dated to around 3200 BC, Geochemical analysis of the Gerzeh iron beads, based on the ratio of nickel to iron and cobalt, confirms that the iron was meteoritic in origin. • Dated to around 2500 BC, an iron dagger from Alaca Höyük in Turkey was confirmed to be meteoritic in origin through geochemical analysis. • Dated to around 2300 BC, an iron pendant from Umm el-Marra in Syria was confirmed to be meteoritic in origin through geochemical analysis. • Dated to around 1400 BC, an iron axe from Ugarit in Syria was found to be meteoritic in origin. • Dated to around 1400 BC, several iron axes from the Shang Dynasty in China were also confirmed to be meteoritic in origin. • Dated to around 1350 BC, an iron dagger, bracelet and headrest from the tomb of Tutankhamun were confirmed to be meteoritic in origin.[9] The Tutankhamun dagger consists of similar proportions of metals (iron, nickel and cobalt) to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower.
