The E-ninnu, a temple build by Gudea
and some other artefacts
A lot of impressive artefacts are known from Gudea, who was the ruler of the state of Lagash from ca. 2144 until ca. -2124 BC, and in this essay we will try to find out the meaning of some of them.
Number 1
This is a sculpture of the head of Gudea.
Gudea (Sumerian: 𒅗𒌤𒀀, Gu3-de2-a) was a ruler (ensi) of the state of Lagash in Southern Mesopotamia who ruled c. 2144–2124 BC. He probably did not come from the city, but had married Ninalla, daughter of the ruler Ur-Baba (2164–2144 BC) of Lagash, thus gaining entrance to the royal house of Lagash. He was succeeded by his son Ur-Ningirsu. Gudea ruled at a time when the center of Sumer was ruled by the Gutian dynasty, and when Ishtup-Ilum ruled to the north in Mari. Under Gudea, Lagash had a golden age, and seemed to enjoy a high level of independence from the Gutians.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea
He claimed to have conquered Elam and Anshan, but his inscriptions emphasize the building of irrigation channels and temples:
Gudea claimed to have conquered Elam and Anshan, but his inscriptions emphasize the building of irrigation channels and temples, and the creation of precious gifts to the gods. Materials for his buildings and statues were brought from all parts of western Asia: cedar wood from the Amanus mountains, quarried stones from Lebanon, copper from northern Arabia, gold and precious stones from the desert between Canaan and Egypt, diorite from Magan (Oman), and timber from Dilmun (Bahrain).
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea
And ‘Gudea was one of the first rulers to claim divinity for himself, or have it claimed for him after his death’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea



Number 2
It appears that Gudea was a great builder: inscriptions mention temples built by him in Ur, Nippur, Adab, Uruk and Bad-Tibira.
Inscriptions mention temples built by Gudea in Ur, Nippur, Adab, Uruk and BadTibira. This indicates the growing influence of Gudea in Sumer. His predecessor, Urbaba, had already made his daughter Enanepada high priestess of Nanna at Ur, which indicates a great deal of political power as well. The 20 years of his reign are all known by name; the main military exploit seems to have occurred in his Year 6, called the ‘Year when Anshan was smitten with weapons’.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gudea
Number 3
A plan of a house is carved in this statue, because once Gudea had a dream and someone who was as enormous as the heaven, spoke about the building of his house:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple In the dream there was someone who was as enormous as the heaven, who was as enormous as the earth. His head was like that of a god, his wings were like those of the Anzud bird, his lower body was like a flood storm. Lions were lying at his right and his left. He spoke to me about building his house, but I could not understand what he exactly meant, then daylight rose for me on the horizon.



Gudea is unsure about this dream and before he is going to build this house for Ninĝirsu, he wants an ominous sign:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
He rose to his master in public and prayed to him; he went to him in the Ubšu-unkena and saluted him: ‘My master Ninĝirsu, lord who has turned back the fierce waters, true lord, semen ejaculated by the Great Mountain, noble young hero who has no opponent! Ninĝirsu, I am going to build up your house for you, but I lack an
ominous sign. Warrior, you asked for perfection, but, son of Enlil, Lord Ninĝirsu, you did not let me know your will as to how to achieve it.’
And then Ninĝirsu tells this sign for building his house, he tells the pure stars of heaven indicating his regulations:
Afterwards, Ninĝirsu stepped up to the head of the sleeper, briefly touching him: ‘You who are going to build it for me, you who are going to build it for me, ruler, you who are going to build my house for me, Gudea, let me tell you the ominous sign for building my house, let me tell you the pure stars of heaven indicating my regulations (?).’
‘As if at the roaring of the Anzud bird, the heavens tremble at my house, the E-ninnu founded by An, the powers of which are the greatest, surpassing all other powers.
And he points at the constellation ‘the Anzu bird’, which we know as ‘Pegasus’:
mul dim.dugudmusen mul anse.kur.ra The Anzu-bird The Horse
Mesopotamian Star Lists and Star Names in the First Millennium BCE by Gary D. Thompson
« Among the early examples of celestial divination one can point to the cylinders of King Gudea, who needed an auspicious sign (gishkim) from his divine master Ningirsu, confirming his consent for building a new temple in Lagash. This evidence from the twenty-second century B.C. is the earliest that clearly attests to the idea of signs in haven and that omens conveyed divine decisions (Rocheberg 2006). Subsequently, consulting the will of the gods is a wellattested practice in ancient Mesopotamia, accompanying every significant political or private action or undertaking”



In his description of this ominous sign he frequently uses the word ‘great’ and once he uses the word ‘bigger’. The good thing is that Mouhib Fouad found the resemblance between the plan of the house and the cuneiform sign 'mah', which means ‘great’.
Plan house Mah sign Here we can clearly see this similarity.
It’s a great house rising in abundance and it’s front is a great mountain:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
The house! It is founded by An on refined silver, it is painted with kohl, and comes out as the moonlight with heavenly splendour. The house! Its front is a great mountain firmly grounded, its inside resounds with incantations and harmonious hymns, its exterior is the sky, a great house rising in abundance, its outer assembly hall is the Anuna gods' place of rendering judgments, from its ...... words of prayer can be heard, its food supply is the abundance of the gods, its standards erected around the house are the Anzud bird spreading its wings over the bright mountain.
Here is the development of the ‘mah’ sign throughout the ages:
mah [GREAT] (3271x: ED IIIb, Old Akkadian, Lagash II, Ur III, Early Old Babylonian, Old Babylonian, unknown) wr. mah; mah2 ’(to be) great’ Akk. kabtu; mādu; rabû; şīru
[1] mah
http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html
The house indeed is great:
The house reaches up to heaven like a huge mountain and its fearsomeness and
awesome radiance have settled upon the land.AN and Enlil have determined the fate of LAGASH; Nin-jirsu ́s authority has become known to all the countries; E-ninnu
has grown so high as to fill the space between the heaven and the earth. NINGIRSU be praised!



Ningirsu ; a Sumerian vegetation and warrior god Lord of Girsu, a city in the district of Lagash.
He was later equated with Ninurta
Number 13
Ningirsu was the god for whom Gudea, ruler of Lagas, rebuilt the great temple E-ninnu, 'House of the Fifty [me] celebrated in a lengthy Sumerian hymn. In the hymn, Gudea dreams that Ningirsu appears before him commanding the rebuilding: instead of appearing in human form, the god appears as the lionheaded Imdugud (Anzu) bird . Since in the older versions of the Akkadian 'Anzû' poem, it is Ningirsu who defeats the Anzu when the bird has stolen from Enlil the tablet of destinies (while the later versions have Ninurta as the divine avenger), it is possible to see how what must originally have been a victim — a 'trophy' — of the god later became so closely identified with him as to be able to stand as a symbol for the divine presence.
Also alluded to in Gudea's hymn is the myth of the Slain Heroes, a group of bizarre minor deities — some anthropomorphic, some monstrous and some inanimate — conquered by Ningirsu (or in other versions, Ninurta). In general Ningirsu was, on the one hand, a warrior god, as the above exploits suggest; on the other hand, he was associated with the fruitfulness of cultivation and vegetation, with the regulation of canals essential for irrigation and with fecundity. On kudurrus of the Kassite Period, the plough is named as his symbol. 121 As Girsu became less important (being absorbed into the empire of the Third Dynasty of Ur), less is heard of Ningirsu, and his myths were attributed to Ninurta.



Mesopotamian temples open to the society
Number 5
Mesopotamian temples fulfilled public service functions which in our societies are provided by state bodies, or delegated to private companies under the control of public power. For example, the temples dedicated to Gula were real treatment centers. The temples of the divinities of Scripture; Nisaba / Nabu allow to see forms of institutions, archives or libraries.
However; each temple was indeed conceived as the abode of a god; the name of the sanctuary had to do with the quality of the god but not with the city where he was; E-MAH was the name of the people of the mother goddess NINMAH The temple dedicated to NANNA-SIN in UR; named DUBLAMAH (dub-la2mah) was a place where oaths had to be taken in particular connection with justice; "The Dublamah, wonder of the land, the place of judgment of NANNA, her net from which no enemy of Amar-Sin can escape; For NANNA, Amar-Sin builds this temple
In Sumerian times, city governors (ENSIK / ENSIGAL) also played the role of senior temple priests. He was a sort of representative of the divinity from whom he took away all his authority.



Number 6
The temple was essentially the home of the deity, but also a ceremonial center, a treasury, a town hall and a commercial or cultural center. It is likely to imagine a similarity with Christian monasteries or more; the Moroccan zaouia, whose center is a mausoleum where an MAH would be buried; a great man This similarity between Mesopotamian temples and North African Zaouia is very interesting to explore. Thus the Mesopotamian temples housed the activities related to the functional speciality of each deity.
The exact name of the Sumerian temple is not obvious; e2-gal? e2? esh3 / ab? or MAH as is the case with the temple; Eninnu dedicated to NINGIRSU? MAH as a cuneiform sign offers a near perfect picture of the temple of Gudea in Lagash Could this be the form he would have dreamed of and therefore the one inspired by his personal god? The name given to the Eninnu temple, could mean; remains of the great number (e2-ninnu) because 50 had as a verbal value; large number! I am tempted to suggest an appellation inspired by the temple of Gula in Isin; EGALMAH for any Sumerian temple



Number 7
Stone basins were set up in the house and according to the inscription this beautiful basin is the gift of Gudea to the temple of Ningirsu:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
The seven stones surrounding the house are there to take counsel with its owner. Its chapel for funerary offerings is as pure as the clean abzu. The stone basins set up in the house are like the holy room of the lustration priest where water never ceases to flow.
They may have been used to perform the hand-washing rites, which was apparently important as it was mentioned several times;
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
With his divine duties, namely to keep the house clean; to let hands always be washed; to serve water to the lord with holy hands; to pour beer into bowls; to pour wine into jars; to make emmer beer in the brewery, the house of pure strength, fizz like the water of the Papsir canal; to make certain that faultless cattle and goats, grain-fed sheep, fresh bread and hind's milk are available day and night; to wake from sleep the noble one, Enlil's beloved son, the warrior Ninĝirsu, by offering (?) food and drink, Gudea introduced Šul-šaga, the lord of the pure hand-washings (šu-luḫ), the firstborn son of E-ninnu, to Ninĝirsu.
It is even that important that the ritually unclean ones could sleep only at the border of his city;
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple He had debts remitted and made all hands clear. When his master entered the house, for seven days the slave woman was allowed to became equal to her mistress and the slave was allowed to walk side by side with his master. But the ritually unclean ones could sleep only at the border of his city. He silenced the evil-speaking tongue and locked up evil.



Number 8
On the sides of the basin there is a bas relief sculpture with seven winged goddesses and seven maidens holding round-based vessels from which water overflows and there is a river flowing below.
This relief may show what happened when Ninĝirsu entered the house and Bau entered her quarters, because when they did the Tigris was at high water, there was abundance for the land of Lagaš. Bowls were set up in the open air and were filled with wine. In the house the purification had been completed and wine was poured from big jars:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
Warrior Ninĝirsu entered the house, the owner of the house had arrived. He was an eagle raising its eyes toward a wild bull. The warrior's entering his house was a storm roaring into battle. Ninĝirsu entered his house and it became the shrine of the abzu when there is a festival. The owner came out of his house and he was Utu rising over the land of Lagaš. Bau's going to her E-mi quarters was a true woman's taking her house in hand. Her entering her bedroom was the Tigris at high water. When she sat down beside her ......, she was the lady, the daughter of holy An, a green garden bearing fruit. The daylight came out, the fate had been decided. Bau entered her E-mi quarters,
and there was abundance for the land of Lagaš. The day dawned. Utu of Lagaš lifted his head over the Land. The house received fattened oxen and sheep. Bowls were set up in the open air and were filled with wine. The Anuna gods of the land of Lagaš gathered around Lord Ninĝirsu. In the house the purification had been completed, the oracular pronouncements had been taken care of. Wine was poured from big jars while ...... was heaped up in the E-ninnu. Nindub caused the sanctuary to be filled with clatter and noise (?) and with fresh bread and hind's milk available day and night; he woke from sleep the noble one, the beloved son of Enlil, the warrior Ninĝirsu. Ninĝirsu raised his head with all the great powers, and ...... rituals, ...... for (?) the sanctuary E-ninnu.



Number 9
And when Mother Bau was resting comfortably with Lord Ninĝirsu, pure bowls standing in the great dining hall were troughs in various sizes that never lack water, and the goblets beside them were the Tigris and Euphrates continually carrying abundance:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple Mother Bau was resting comfortably with Lord Ninĝirsu.
Large bronze plates (?) offered all sorts of food (?). In the good house ...... were cooked in shining bronze vessels (?). Its pure bowls standing in the great dining hall were troughs in various sizes that never lack water, and the goblets beside them were the Tigris and Euphrates continually carrying abundance.



Number 10
The seven winged goddesses on top may represent the seven daughters of Lord Ninĝirsu and his wife Bau. They are a septuplets (each of seven children born at one birth) and they create plenty for the myriads.
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
Zazaru, Iškur-pa-e, Ur-agrunta-ea, Ḫe-Ĝir-nuna, Ḫe-šaga, Zurĝu and Zarĝu, who are Bau's septuplets, the offspring of Lord Ninĝirsu, his beloved lukur maidens, who create plenty for the myriads, stepped forward to Lord Ninĝirsu with friendly entreaties on behalf of Gudea.
The maiden below may represent the slave women of these seven daughters. With their crowns they look like them, because when Ninĝirsu entered the house, for seven days the seven slave women were allowed to became equal to their mistresses:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
He had everything function as it should in his city. Gudea had built the E-ninnu, made its powers perfect. He brought butter and cream into its dairy and provided its ...... with bread (?). He had debts remitted and made all hands clear. When his master
entered the house, for seven days the slave woman was allowed to became equal to her mistress and the slave was allowed to walk side by side with his master. But the ritually unclean ones could sleep only at the border of his city. He silenced the evilspeaking tongue and locked up evil.
So the basin records that for seven days the seven slave women were allowed to become like their mistresses, the seven daughters who create plenty, when their parents Ninĝirsu and Bauhey entered the house.



Number 11
o The seven slave women of course look like this Egypt Crater goddess depicted on the Dendera Zodiac. o As we saw before Ninĝišzida is the deity of Hydra. o Ninĝirsu is called a rampant lion, so he is situated in Leo:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
39-51. ‘Warrior, rampant lion, who has no opponent! Ninĝirsu, important in the abzu, respected in Nibru!
o Bau, the dog goddess, is the deity of Canis Minor o And Nanše is the daughter of Eridug. This city was a star in ‘False Cross’, a group of stars in Argo Navis:
20
The Great God Ea (GU.LA d.Ea) the Star of Eridu (NUN.(KI)), d.Ea
{Leo. GU.LA (not to be confused with GULA across the way) here is Leo whence UR.GU.LA, Regulus’ and NUN.KI is the False Cross in Argo Navis (Vela and Carina).}(Rēgulus is Latin for 'prince' or 'little king'.)
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
So, the protagonists of the script ‘The building of Ninĝirsu's temple’ can be found in the starry sky.



Number 12
As an introduction to another artefact I start with this broken clay tablet on which three constellations are depicted: Cancer symbolized by a star and Leo walking on Hydra. This is one of the 12 clay tablets made during the last few centuries BC in Uruk, showing representations of the 12 zodiacal signs. Unfortunately only 3 of them survived.
Number 12
Here is a drawing of the above tablet and now we can easily see that Hydra, called: ‘The Snake’ in ancient Mesopotamia, is portrayed as a winged dragon with a snake body:
8 The Snake (MUSH), d.NIN.GISH.ZI.DA, lord of the underworld [Hydra]
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Ninĝišzida was the god of this constellation which is an important fact to us as he is also the divine father of Gudea:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
Gudea, nobody ...... what you say. You are ...... a man known to An. You are a true ruler, for whom the house has determined a good fate. Gudea, son of Ninĝišzida, you will enjoy a long life!’



Number 14
With this knowledge we will examine this libation vase. The four sides show two snakes and two dragons and between these mythical animals is also this text:
‘To the god Ninĝišzida, his god, Gudea, Ensi (governor) of Lagash, for the prolongation of his life, has dedicated this’
So this vase is dedicated to Ninĝišzida, and the question is: who of these four animals represents this god, one of the snakes, one of the dragons, or all four at the same time? The point is that in the next part of a balbale to him Ninĝišzida is a dragon and he has the mouth of a poisonous snake:
A balbale to Ninĝišzida
Hero, falcon preying on the gods, my king -- dignified, with sparkling eyes, fully equipped with arrows and quiver, impetuous leopard, murderous, howling muchuc, dragon snarling (?) in the lagoon, raging storm covering all people! Lofty-headed prince, resting in the midst of the mountains, ...... smashing heads! Lord, your mouth is that of a poisonous snake, Lord Ninĝišzida, ......! Ninĝišzida, your mouth is that of a pure magician, Lord Ninĝišzida, ......!



Number 14
So, Ninĝišzida is the god of Hydra and this constellation has the body of a snake. We also read that Ninĝišzida has a mouth of a poisonous snake and therefore it is plausible that he could be figured here as a snake. But on cylinder seals gods and their wives usually were depicted equally, so when in Leo a god became a lion then his wife became a lioness, when in Taurus a god became a bull and then his wife became a cow. So in Hydra Ninĝišzida and his wife both became a snake or a dragon.
When the sun passed through Hydra about 4,200 years ago, then the gods of this constellation became active, which among others meant that Ninĝišzida united with his wife. This act was symbolized by the two copulating snakes and during this act Gudea was conceived, which of course meant that the two gods gave him life.
Conceived in Hydra, Gudea was born in Taurus about nine months later. And that is why his divine mother is called Ninsumun, which means: ‘Lady Wild Cow’ and that this text states that he is a child born by the true cow.
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
Your god, Lord Ninĝišzida, is the grandson of An; your divine mother is Ninsumun, the bearing mother of good offspring, who loves her offspring; you are a child born by the true cow. You are a true youth made to rise over the land of Lagaš by Ninĝirsu; your name is established from below to above. Gudea, nobody ...... what you say. You are ...... a man known to An. You are a true ruler, for whom the house has determined a good fate. Gudea, son of Ninĝišzida, you will enjoy a long life!’



Number 14
Nevertheless, in the balbale to him Ninĝišzida is also called a dragon and he is the god of Hydra, which is figured as half a dragon and thus it is evident that he can be figured as a dragon too. Again, since gods and their spouses can be depicted alike the wife of Ninĝišzida is also figured as a dragon. As dragons, they both hold a ball and rod sceptre that resembles an Egyptian ‘shen ring’:
Number 15
This ring represented ‘eternal protection’:
In Ancient Egypt a shen ring was a circle with a line tangent to it, represented in hieroglyphs as a stylised loop of a rope. The word shen itself means, in ancient Egyptian, encircle, while the shen ring represented eternal protection.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shen_ring



Number 16
In this cylinder seal, a throne deity gives this so-called ‘shen ring’ to the owner of the seal facing him. This act may symbolize that this deity gives him ‘eternal protection’. According to the following text Gudea wants protection too:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
May the favourable, right-hand palm of your lofty hands, my lady Ĝatumdug, lend me protection! I am going to the city, may my sign be favourable!
Number 17
Ninsumun Gudea Ninĝišzida Ninĝirsu
And this drawing of his cylinder seal shows that he that he does indeed receive this protection: as a guard his mother Ninsumun (with horns) follows him and his protecting father Ninĝišzida goes before him:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
The true shepherd Gudea is wise, and able too to realise things. His friendly guardian went before him and his friendly protecting genius followed him.

https://www.academia.edu/6841546/The_seal_of_Gudea_ruler_of_Lagash_related_to_the_myth_of_the _building_of_Nin%C4%9Dirsus_temple



Number 14
So on the previous drawing of his cylinder seal both his parents give protection to Gudea and on the vase they are figured as dragons holding a ‘shen ring’ which symbolizes that they indeed protect him.
And thus, as snakes Ninĝišzida and Ninsumun conceived Gudea and gave him life. In the text Gudea asked his father for the prolongation of his life:
‘To the god Ninĝišzida, his god, Gudea, Ensi (governor) of Lagash, for the prolongation of his life, has dedicated this’
And as dragons holding a ‘shen ring’ his divine parents protected him.
And thus the meaning of the inscription and the meanings of the mythical animals nicely fitted together.

(Neo-Sumerian/Ur III period), from Girsu (modern Telloh, Iraq), diorite, 93 x 41 x 61 cm (Musée du Louvre, Paris) A royal votive inscription: Gudea has left us the longest known inscriptions in Sumerian, exalting his piety towards the gods according to an ideal that is very different from the Akkadian militarism that had preceded him. The inscription is here divided into 368 compartments arranged in nine columns. It begins on the back and then extends round the sides, covering the entire seat and lower part of Gudea's robe. The text begins with a list of regular offerings made to the statue of Gudea, as for a cult figure. In fact, it is a ‘living statue,’ intended to replace the prince before his god for eternity and to transmit his messages, in particular the fact that the Eninnu was built according to divine rules and social laws. Gudea's titles, given after the list of offerings, reveal that all the gods of the pantheon of Lagash have conferred the principality on him, together with the qualities needed to shoulder this responsibility. The account of the construction of the Eninnu lists the foreign countries that supplied the materials, thus revealing the power of Lagash: cedars from Amanus, stones from northern Syria, and booty captured in Elam. Carved according to the rites, the statue is made of diorite, a stone regarded as a noble material, more durable than others, because it is harder to destroy. The statue is given a name and the right to speak, as well as a place on the esplanade of the temple of Ningirsu, under the god's eye. The inscription ends with a long curse on anyone who might try to desecrate it. Later princes took heed of these words, since the kings of the empire of Ur III honoured the memory of Gudea with libations and offerings, as instructed on the statue.

For Ningirsu, strong hero of Enlil, Gudea, he of lasting fame, ruler of Lagash, the shepherd chosen by the heart of Ningirsu, regarded favorably by Nanše, given might

He set up the brick mold, and chose the (first) brick by kid-omen. The sexually impure persons who inspire fear, the [...] man, he with a shrivelled(?) penis, and the woman who had been in labour(?), he sent out of the city. Women did not carry the earth baskets for it, (only) the chief warriors did the building for him. The temple of Ningirsu like (the city) Eridu in a clean place he built. There was no beating with whips nor beating with leather straps. No mother hit her child with anything. The military governors, overseers, foremen, those who performed worker levies, while stationed at the work (as light as) wool under the carding comb was the disciplining he put into their hands. No pickax was used in the cemetery of the city, no corpse was buried. The lamentation singer did not play the harp or bring forth laments, The wailing women did not perform wailing. Within the territory of Lagash, a person having a lawsuit to the place of oath-taking did not make another person go, and a creditor did not enter another person's house. For Ningirsu, his master, he (Gudea) made a fitting thing come forth resplendently, (namely) his temple Eninnu with a white thunderbird he built for him and restored for him. In the center of it his beloved high terrace, with aromatic cedar, he built for him. When the temple of Ningirsu he built, Ningirsu, his master who loved him, from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea opened up the roads for him. From the Amanus, the mountain range of cedar, cedars whose length was sixty cubits, Cedars whose length was fifty cubits, and boxwood whose length was twenty-five cubits, he made into planks and brought them down from their mountains. Levels the Multitudes, his storm of battle, he constructed for him, and Slaughters the Multitudes, his copper seven-faced peg, he constructed for him. His copper peg of a side-ax he constructed for him, and his copper peg of an allul-ax he constructed for him. Those cedars into big doors he fashioned, decorated them with sacred flowers, and into the Eninnu he had them brought for him. In his lofty temple where cold water would be poured, he (also) set them as roofbeams for him. From the city of Ursu and the mountain range of Ebla juniper, big firs, and plane trees, mountain trees, he made into planks, and in the Eninnu he set them as roof-beams for him. From Umanum, the mountain range of Menua, and from Busala, the mountain range of the Martu, big stones he brought down. Into steles he fashioned them, and in the courtyard of the Eninnu he erected them for him. From Tidanum, the mountain range of the Martu, alabaster in blocks he brought in, and into destroying lions he fashioned them, and as gate bolts he mounted them in the temple.



In Abullat, the mountain range of Kimaš, he mined copper, and into the Mace Which the World Quarters Cannot Bear he fashioned it for him. From the land of Meluhha he brought down ebony, and erected(?) it for him. A block of nir-stone he brought down, and into a mace with three lion heads he fashioned it for him. Gold in its ore from the mountain range of Hahum he brought down, and onto the mace with three lion heads he overlaid it for him. Gold in its ore from the land of Meluhha he brought down, and into a quiver he fashioned it for him. Zebus he brought down. From Gubin the land of oak(?) trees, oak(?) he brought down, and into the bird (named) Levels the Multitudes he fashioned it. From Madga, the mountain range of the ordeal river, a myriad of talents of bitumen he brought down, and in the platform of the Eninnu he used it for construction. Ha'um-clay be brought down. From the mountain range of Barme many stones into big boats he loaded, and he placed them around the base of the Eninnu. The cities of Anšan and Elam with weapons he smote, and the booty from them to Ningirsu into the Eninnu he had brought in. Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, when the Eninnu he had built for Ningirsu, he made it as a (lasting) treasure. A temple fashioned like this not a single ruler for Ningirsu had ever built. But he (Gudea) did indeed build it. He inscribed (his) name, and made (this) fitting thing come forth resplendently. To the commands of Ningirsu he set forth a faithful hand. From the land of Magan he brought down diorite and into (this) stone figure he formed it. For my master his temple I built, (so) life is my reward, (was how) he named it for him, and into the Eninnu he had it brought to him. Gudea to the statue gives (these) words: Statue, to my master do say thus: When the Eninnu, his beloved temple, I built for him, I had debts remitted and I washed all hands. For seven days no barley was ground. The slave woman was made equal with her mistress, and by the slave his master stood side by side. In my city the sexually impure with respect to him (Ningirsu) I made to go out to sleep at the edge of it. Evil to its house I made go back. To the laws of Nanše and Ningirsu I attended. An orphan I did not let be put under the control of a rich person. and a widow I did not let be put under the control of a powerful person. For an estate not having a son, a daughter of it its heir I made become. The stone statue he made receptive to messages. This statue is neither of silver, nor is it of lapis lazuli. It is neither of copper nor of tin, nor is it of bronze. No one must put it to any other use, and so it is (made only of) diorite. Let it stand at the place of libations. By an act of force let no one destroy it. O statue, before you is (standing a statue) of Ningirsu!



The statue of Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, the man by whom the Eninnu of Ningirsu was built-any person who from the Eninnu shall remove it, or its inscription shall erase from it, or any person who shall destroy it; at the beginning of a good year, a (future) person whom, as did my god, his (own) god Ningirsu, my master, has called to from among all the people, who (then) my judgments shall overturn, my gifts would revoke, and from my collected songs having displaced my name shall set his own name on them; who in the courtyard of Ningirsu my master shall abandon its established shrines, without having kept before his eyes that since days of old, since the seed (first) emerged, when a ruler of Lagash, the Eninnu for Ningirsu my master had built-being a person who had made a fitting thing come forth resplendently-his words no one shall ever alter, nor ever overturn his judgments. Therefore regarding Gudea, the ruler of Lagash, anyone who shall alter his word, or shall overturn his judgments, may An, Enlil, Ninhursaga, Enki, he of the righteous utterance, Suen, whose name no one can explain, Ningirsu, the king of weaponry, Nanše, the mistress of the boundary marker, Nindara, the king and warrior, the mother of Lagash the holy Gatumdu [House (that) brings goodness], Baba, the lady, the eldest daughter of An, Inanna, the lady of battle, Utu, the king of greenery, Hendursag, the herald of the nation, Igalima and Šulšagana, Ninmar, the eldest daughter of Nanše, Dumuzi' abzu, the mistress of Kinunir, and my (personal) god Ningešzida, may they all change his fate. Like an ox may he be slaughtered in his noonday (prime). Like an aurochs may he be seized by his fierce horns. May his throne which people had set up for him be made to sit out in the dust. If to erasing this inscription he should set his mind, let his own name in the house of his god from the tablets be removed. May his own god not look upon the settled(?) people. May he hold back the rain in the sky and hold back the waters upon the earth. May years of dearth stretch out for him, and may there be famine during his reign. That person, like a man who does evil to a righteous person, may that one’s end produce a shutting(?) in heaven, and may it not be released. Of the most forceful of all the gods, of lord Ningirsu, may his greatness be known by the nation.
