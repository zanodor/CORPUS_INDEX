The great Mother Goddess
THE GREAT MOTHER GODDESS
When studying Comparative Mythology and especially the
numerous cultural Stories of Creation, the best of these stories of
course included the female importance as being equal to the male
archetype.
Without both gender and their qualities, no creation can take part
and this also goes for the basically powers of creation, where the
female and male creation can be compared to the two poles in
electromagnetism which forms everything and give motions to
everything.
IMO the global Stories of Creation all deal with the creation of our
Milky Way galaxy and NOT with the entire Universe. The very best
of these stories also describes the very principles of creation,
which also take part in the formation of the Milky Way, as for
instants the Egyptian Ogdoad – Link:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogdoad#In_Egyptian_mythology
The Greek goddess Aphrodite and the Roman goddess Venus is
equal to the Egyptian goddess Hathor, who specifically is
mentioned as being connected to the Milky Way. Hathor is also
closely connected to Ra, the strong central light in the Milky Way
and thus, Ra don ́t represent the Sun. Link:

The equal Greek, Roman and Egyptian goddess connection the



Milky Way derives from the image of the Milky Way contours on
the southern hemisphere - Read here on my personal Mytho
Cosmological website.
Goddess Venus was born from the "foam of the sea", it is told.
The Milky Way contours is mythically mentioned as "the celestial
river". Looking at the Milky Way shape on the southern
hemisphere, this very easily can be imagined as a celestial
woman.
If agreeing in this celestial imagery of a woman, the galactic
center is located in the imagined location of her womb, thus
giving rise to the mythical term, the "Cosmic Womb" from where
everything in our galaxy is formed, which again logically gives rise
to the mythical term, The Mother Goddess.
Another mythical term regards "the Underworld Goddess", which
is logical since she is located on the southern hemisphere, "under
the northern and most known hemisphere".
THE SOUTHERN MILKY WAY CONTOURS.



Indigenous people all over the World saw the southern Milky Way
contours as a great female figure in the sky. The star atlas picture
above shows the figure of the southern Milky Way contours
inserted with the celestial south pole and an animated spiral
representing the centre of our galaxy.



Picture 1 and 2 are rock carvings from Sweden, Bohuslen County.
Picture 3 are a star map picture of the southern Milky Way typical
contours. Picture 4 showing a part of a kettle are from Denmark,
Gundestrup locality. Notice the ring or circle markings which
indicate the circumpolar centre on the night sky in the three last
pictures.
Australian Rock Painting of the Great White Milky Way Goddess.



Milky Way Goddess, Gangavati, India
As shoved on the top of this side, the white Milky Way figure or
contours can be seen, sculptured and pictured in different
directions. The Egyptians, amongst others, shoved the figure as
the Great Female Goddess in the night sky as seen in picture 2
above beside the star map picture and in picture 1, 2, and 3 below.
The wheel figure are concordant with the circle right underneath
the face of The Great Mother Goddess on the Egyptian picture
shoving the southern celestial circum polar centre. I have myself



made a red/blue swirl marking as well as the 4 spoke wheel on the
star map figure. This swirl represent the centre in our Galaxy in
the direction of the star constellation of Sagittarius.
On the Egyptian picture there are another circled mark placed in
the spot for the female womb symbolizing the Great Goddess
giving birth to all matter which are shoved in the Egyptian picture
as stars radiating out from the womb of the heavenly mother. It is
of course from this idea and understanding the expression "The
Great Mother Goddess" has come from.
(Lyrics from Lisa Thiel: http://www.youtube.com/watch?
v=wKyNIY9oMnw )
Bhimbetaka, India
In the Norse or Scandinavian Mythology we have a similar
explanation of the Creation: In the north there was cold and dark.
In the south there was warm and light and from here came sparks
that created the World.



In my opinion have our ancestors all over the World got some
similar information's about cosmological conditions which modern
astrophysics have rediscovered in the modern time with
technological instruments. But how was that possible for our
ancestors on the north hemisphere to recognize the southern
heaven an the Milky Way figure and its cosmological knowledge?
The answer is: By spiritual journeys of wise men and woman and
trough intuitive knowledge! I know this from some visions and
dreams of my own. And there are more astonishingly knowledge
from our ancestors to come in the following content.
The specific interpretation of the southern Milky Way figure are
that it is female in its quality. Just because it is from here in the
centre of our Galaxy, in the star constellation of Sagittarius, that
all matter in the Galaxy have been radiated in 4 beams, arms or
floods and later on have taken more and more form.
WOMAN AND ANIMAL.
Just as in the case with the northern Milky Way contours and
figures there also are a mixed symbolizing with the southern Milky
Way contours or figures. Many cultures have seen the contours as
a cow known as The Heavenly Cow, maybe also because of the
similarity with the white colour of milk as well as a symbol of a
nourishing animal.



From the Norse Mythology we also have the Big Heavenly Cow,
Audhumbla, licking the giant Ymer out of the rocks forming the
northern Milky Way figure as seen below and compared with the
Egypt picture shoving the similar motif.



Dragons are legendary creatures, typically with serpentine or
otherwise reptilian traits, that feature in the myths of many
cultures. This is very understandably since the origin comes from
the large southern Milky Way contours.



Other animal symbols for the southern Milky Way figure could be
Elephant, Kangaroo, Whale, Turtle, Lizard, Serpent and even as a
Mermaid. All these animals are told of in the Creation Myths.
The Underworld Woman and Goddess
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld
"The underworld or netherworld is thought to be deep



underground or beneath the surface of the world in most
religions and mythologies. Typically it is a place where the
souls of the departed go, an afterlife or a realm of the dead.
Chthonic is the technical adjective for things of the
underworld".
Comment: The Mythological underworld is the “world under
the horizon” but located up in the night Sky as the “center of
our Milky Way on the southern hemisphere where the Milky
Way contours resembles a “great woman in the night Sky”
where her womb is located in the galactic center, thus “she”
is a “former and giver of all life” in our Milky Way.
Comment: The center of our Milky Way is of course very
important in all Myths of Creation and our Solar System is also
created from this center i.e. "the Garden of Eden" which also is
described in many other ancient cultures.

THE MYTHO-COSMOLOGICAL INTERPRETATION OF GAIA
When reading of the mythical Gaia, several contradictions and
illogical explanations occur. It seems that the story scholarly is
interpreted without connection to the full mytho-cosmological
context.
The very basics of creation/formation.



The vast mythical void = Space
Filled with “fluctuating foam” = the Aether, in which everything is
created and connected.
The four elements of water, air, fire and soil in their latent stages.
The complementary qualities of the four elements.
Attraction and repulsion. (Mythological female and male
symbolism)
Hotness and coldness.
The formative action started (and restarted eternally) by light
(electric currents) and sound.
Via these elements and their formative qualities, everything is
created, dissolved and eternally recreated. This whole
mythological scenario shall of course be seen, interpreted and
connected to everything humans can observe with their physical
eyes as well as with their spiritual skills, as it is the case with many
individuals and prophets when they have their visions and
meeting with the divine creative forces.
In the many cultural Stories of Creation, the Earth and the Solar
System is not the first to be formatted. The Solar System is an
integrated part of the Milky Way rotation and thus also an
integrated part of the galactic formation. When the primeval



elements are set in motion, an attractive (electromagnetic) force
draws all elements “flowing as plasmatic rivers” towards the
galactic center, where gases and particles are sorted out and
particles are lumped together, thus creating the “first firm soil”
which later on become planets in all kinds, whereas the
assembled gases become stars in all kinds. The stars and planets
all leaves the galactic center and slowly floats out in the galactic
arms, mythologically mentioned as “rivers”. (The biblical Repulsion
from the central “Garden of Eden”)
Here we have the full mytho-cosmological description of how
everything in our local Milky Way is created/formatted. So, how do
the mythical Gaia fits into this explanation?
Excerpt from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_%28mythology%29
In Greek mythology, Gaia (/ˈɡeɪ.ə/ or /ˈɡaɪ.ə/; from Ancient Greek
Γαῖα, a poetical form of Gē Γῆ, "land" or "earth"also Gaea, or Ge)
was the personification of the Earth, one of the Greek primordial
deities. Gaia was the great mother of all: the primal Greek Mother
Goddess; creator and giver of birth to the Earth and all the
Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans, and the Giants were born
to her. The gods reigning over their classical pantheon were born
from her union with Uranus (the sky), while the sea-gods were
born from her union with Pontus (the sea). Her equivalent in the
Roman pantheon was Terra.
Remarks:



Gaia represents the female attractive and formgiving qualities.
Gaia “is the creator and giver of birth to the Earth and everything
else the Universe; the heavenly gods, the Titans”, i.e. to
everything observable in the Milky Way galaxy which was the
ancient known part of the Universe.
As mentioned above, the formation of stars and planets in our
Milky Way, takes off from within the center and spreads out from
there as large and gigantic heavenly rivers which are given names
as Titans and Giants and the huge primeval female and male
deities flying around in the night Sky. As a giver and former of
these heavenly structures, subsequently and logically the Gaia
deity represents the Galactic Mother and not the Earth.
The scholarly misinterpretations of Gaia derives from taking the
mythical creation telling of the element of “soil” as being the Earth
and the misinterpretations of course also derives from the
scholarly lack of cosmological connection to the overall formation
in our Milky Way galaxy.

Dear Den Poitras,
Thanks a lot for this excellent article!
In my opinion nothing really can act parthenogenetically in itself,
there are always some external as well as internal creative forces
at play. But on the larger picture everything in the Universe acts
parthenogenetically when understanding the Creation as an
overall self sustaining an eternal motion of creation, dissolution



and recreation.
You wrote: "It is said that Buddha's mother conceived her son
when in a state of blissful meditation under a banyan tree. Mary
conceived Jesus in more or less the same way".
AD: The "Virgin Mother conception" is a global term in many
cultural Stories of Creation and the telling doesn ́t make much
sense unless connecting the telling to the global cosmological
Stories of Creation - and even this doesn ́t make much sense if
lacking the cosmological idea of what these stories shall be
connected to.
We all live in the same Earth; in the same Solar System; in the
same galaxy and in the same part of the Universe. In ancient
times, the "local universe" just included our Milky Way galaxy and
this overall picture makes the very basics in all Stories of Creation
with a very similar cultural/mythical/religious telling of how the
elements were/are in a latent state "before anything firm is
created" and how light and sound started of the motion and
interaction between the elements, creating everything in our Milky
Way galaxy.
Links: Global of Virgin Goddesses
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Virgin_goddesses and
Mother Goddess - http://www.native
science.net/MilkyWay.MotherGoddess.htm
Ancient cultures pictured their primary creator deities in the mind
of humans i.e. in a way that best symbolized and described what
they observed in the day- and nighttime Sky. The Stories of
Creation tell of "a mound" that appeared when the elements



interacted. On this Primeval Mound a tremendous light appeared
and from here everything else were/are created in our galaxy. This
light represent the luminous center in the Milky Way galaxy and if
observing the MW-Contours around the Earth in nighttime on a
clear night and in a favorable season, one can easily imagine a
huge Serpent around the Earth, and thus we have the telling of "a
snake in the Garden of Eden". Link: Creation Myths
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_creation_myths
If dividing the Earth hemispheres in 2, the northern hemisphere
MW-contours easily can be imagined as a huge man (The Great
God) seemingly revolving around the celestial pole area. On the
southern hemisphere where the galactic center is located in the
direction of the Sagittarius constellation, a similar huge humanlike
figure can be imagined, representing the Great Goddess, and if
focusing on "her lower body", the galactic center located very
precisely where the Mother Goddess ́s womb is located, thus
giving origin to the mythical term of "The Cosmic Womb". Links:
http://www.native-science.net/MilkyWay.GreatestGod.htm and
Mother Goddess - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mother_goddess
So, coming around from the very telling of the Virgin Birth theme
over the parthenogenetically perception and creation, to the
connection of the Stories of Creation connected to the Milky Way
galaxy and its formative creation, symbolized as a celestial woman
on the southern hemisphere, from which "cosmic womb",
everything in our galaxy is conceived, formed and born.
Thus "she" gives birth to everything in the galaxy without having
sexual intercourse with a man", and through this telling, the
ancient cultures got a very precise physical and spiritual (via
visions) description of the creation on and above the Earth, all in
the image of themselves and their surroundings.



In generally, visit my Mytho-Cosmological site
http://www.native-science.net/index.html and read my Mytho
Cosmological Papers with a modernized mythological telling can
be read here: http://vixra.org/author/ivar_nielsen
Sam, as you noted in your article: " Don't worry, I've no ax to grind
against men, no book to sell, as yet, and no religion to promote or
put down".
AD: This goes very much for me too. My only agenda is to re
launch an old knowledge which is almost forgotten and that ́s a
pity because it, as you stated with your fine sentence: "One of my
core beliefs is we are connected by a tribal system of belief that
represents Humans in our most authentic state" - and therefore
we shall be unified (and not divided) in these global and similar
Stories of Creation.
Best Wishes and thanks!

The Great Mother Goddess and The Underworld = Southern Earth
Hemisphere
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld
In the study of mythology and religion, the underworld is a
generic term approximately equivalent to the lay term afterlife,
referring to any place to which newly dead souls go. In most
cultures the term refers to a neutral or dystopic realm of the
afterlife, instead of a heavenly or paradisiac one. Sometimes the
underworld is identified as "Hell" because Hell is thought to be
under the Earth.



Nun, the Great Mother Water Goddess, residing at the Primordial
Mound = Hill (= Hell) in the Milky Way River Center (Sagittarius
Constellation) in the southern Earth hemisphere.

Earth diver Myth
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creation_myth#Earth-diver
The earth-diver is a common character in various traditional
creation myths. In these stories a supreme being usually sends an
animal into the primal waters to find bits of sand or mud with
which to build habitable land. Some scholars interpret these
myths psychologically while others interpret them
cosmogonically. In both cases emphasis is placed on beginnings
emanating from the depths. Earth-diver myths are common in
Native American folklore but can be found among the Chukchi
and Yukaghir, the Tatars and many Finno-Ugrian traditions. The
pattern of distribution of these stories suggest they have a
common origin in the eastern Asiatic coastal region, spreading as
peoples migrated west into Siberia and east to the North
American continent.
Characteristic of many Native American myths, earth-diver
creation stories begin as beings and potential forms linger asleep
or suspended in the primordial realm. The earth-diver is among
the first of them to awaken and lay the necessary groundwork by
building suitable lands where the coming creation will be able to
live. In many cases, these stories will describe a series of failed
attempts to make land before the solution is found.
These myths all deals with the telling of the Creation which is



connected to the Milky Way Centre on the southern
("underworld") hemisphere and the Great Mother deity.
Emergence
In emergence myths humanity emerges from another world into
the one they currently inhabit. The previous world is often
considered the womb of the earth mother, (NOT EARTH
MOTHER - BUT MILKY WAY GREAT MOTHER! IVAR) and the
process of emergence is likened to the act of giving birth. The
role of midwife is usually played by a female deity, like the spider
woman of Native American mythology. Male characters rarely
figure into these stories, and scholars often consider them in
counterpoint to male oriented creation myths, like those of the ex
nihilo variety. (OF COURSE MALE CHARACTERS DOES NOT
FIGURE HERE!)
Emergence myths commonly describe the creation of people
and/or supernatural beings as a staged ascent or metamorphosis
from nascent forms through a series of subterranean worlds to
arrive at their current place and form. Often the passage from one
world or stage to the next is impelled by inner forces, a process of
germination or gestation from earlier, embryonic forms. The genre
is most commonly found in Native American cultures where the
myths frequently link the final emergence of people from a hole
opening to the underworld to stories about their subsequent
migrations and eventual settlement in their current homelands.

What Became of God the Mother?
Elaine H.Pagels (1)
http://holyspirit
shekinah.org/_/what_became_of_god_the_mother-1.htm
Unlike many of his contemporaries among the deities of the



ancient Near East, the God of Israel shares his power with no
female divinity, nor is he the divine Husband or Lover of any.(l) He
scarcely can be characterized in any but masculine epithets: King,
Lord, Master, Judge, and Father.



Conflicting Images of God in Early Christianity
Elaine H.Pagels.
Unlike many of his contemporaries among the deities of the
ancient Near East, the God of Israel shares his power with no
female divinity, nor is he the divine Husband or Lover of any.(l) He
scarcely can be characterized in any but masculine epithets: King,
Lord, Master, Judge, and Father.(2) Indeed, the absence of
feminine symbolism of God marks Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
in striking contrast to the world's other religious traditions,
whether in Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, and Rome or Africa,
Polynesia, India, and North America. Jewish, Christian, and Islamic
theologians, however, are quick to point out that God is not to be
considered in sexual terms at all. Yet the actual language they use
daily in worship and prayer conveys a different message and gives
the distinct impression that God is thought of in exclusively
masculine terms. And while it is true that Catholics revere Mary as
the mother of Jesus, she cannot be identified as divine in her own
right: if she is "mother of God," she is not "God the Mother" on an
equal footing with God the Father.
Christianity, of course, added the trinitarian terms to the Jewish
description of God. And yet of the three divine "Persons," two
the Father and Son—are described in masculine terms, and the
third—the Spirit—suggests the sexlessness of the Greek neuter
term pneuma. This is not merely a subjective impression.
Whoever investigates the early development of Christianity—the
field called "patristics," that is, study of "the fathers of the
church"—may not be surprised by the passage that concludes
the recently discovered, secret Gospel of Thomas: "Simon Peter
said to them [the disciples], `Let Mary be excluded from among
us, for she is a woman, and not worthy of Life.' Jesus said,



`Behold I will take Mary, and make her a male, so that she may
become a living spirit, resembling you males. For I tell you truly,
that every female who makes herself male will enter the Kingdom
of Heaven.'"(3) Strange as it sounds, this only states explicitly
what religious rhetoric often assumes: that the men form the
legitimate body of the community, while women will be allowed to
participate only insofar as their own identity is denied and
assimilated to that of the men.
Further exploration of the texts which include this Gospel
written on papyrus, hidden in large clay jars nearly 1,600 years
ago—has identified them as Jewish and Christian gnostic works
which were attacked and condemned as "heretical" as early as
A.D. 100—150. What distinguishes these "heterodox" texts from
those that are called "orthodox" is at least partially clear: they
abound in feminine symbolism that is applied, in particular, to
God. Although one might expect, then, that they would recall the
archaic pagan traditions of the Mother Goddess, their language is
to the contrary specifically Christian, unmistakably related to a
Jewish heritage. Thus we can see that certain gnostic Christians
diverged even more radically from the Jewish tradition than the
early Christians who described God as the "three Persons" or the
Trinity. For, instead of a monistic and masculine God, certain of
these texts describe God as a dyadic being, who consists of both
masculine and feminine elements. One such group of texts, for
example, claims to have received a secret tradition from Jesus
through James, and significantly, through Mary Magdalene.(4)
Members of this group offer prayer to both the divine Father and
Mother: "From Thee, Father, and through Thee, Mother, the two
immortal names, Parents of the divine being, and thou, dweller in
heaven, mankind of the mighty name."(5) Other texts indicate that
their authors had pondered the nature of the beings to whom a



single, masculine God proposed, "Let us make mankind in our
image, after our likeness" (Gen. 1Ç26). Since the Genesis account
goes on to say that mankind was created "male and female"
(1Ç27), some concluded, apparently, that the God in whose image
we are created likewise must be both masculine and feminine
both Father and Mother.
The characterization of the divine Mother in these sources is not
simple since the texts themselves are extraordinarily diverse.
Nevertheless, three primary characterizations merge. First, a
certain poet and teacher, Valentinus, begins with the premise that
God is essentially indescribable. And yet he suggests that the
divine can be imagined as a Dyad consisting of two elements: one
he calls the Ineffable, the Source, the Primal Father; the other, the
Silence, the Mother of all things.(6) Although we might question
Valentinus's reasoning that Silence is the appropriate complement
of what is Ineffable, his equation of the former with the feminine
and the latter with the masculine may be traced to the
grammatical gender of the Greek words. Followers of Valentinus
invoke this feminine power, whom they also call "Grace" (in Greek,
the feminine term charis), in their own private celebration of the
Christian eucharist: they call her "divine, eternal Grace, She who
is before all things."(7) At other times they pray to her for
protection as the Mother, "Thou enthroned with God, eternal,
mystical Silence."(8) Marcus, a disciple of Valentinus, contends
that "when Moses began his account of creation, he mentioned
the Mother of all things at the very beginning, when he said, `In
the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,' "(9) for
the word beginning (in Greek, the feminine arche) refers to the
divine Mother, the source of the cosmic elements. When they
describe God in this way, different gnostic writers have different
interpretations. Some maintain that the divine is to be considered



masculo-feminine—the "great male-female power." Others insist
that the terms are meant only as metaphors—for, in reality, the
divine is neither masculine nor feminine. A third group suggests
that one can describe the Source of all things in either masculine
or feminine terms, depending on which aspect one intends to
stress.(10) Proponents of these diverse views agree, however,
that the divine is to be understood as consisting of a harmonious,
dynamic relationship of opposites—a concept that may be akin to
the eastern view of yin and yang but remains antithetical to
orthodox Judaism and Christianity.
A second characterization of the divine Mother describes her as
Holy Spirit. One source, the Secret Book of John, for example,
relates how John, the brother of James, went out after the
crucifixion with "great grief," and had a mystical vision of the
Trinity: "As I was grieving . . . the heavens were opened, and the
whole creation shone with an unearthly light, and the universe
was shaken. I was afraid . . . and behold . . . a unity in three forms
appeared to me, and I marvelled: how can a unity have three
forms?" To John's question, the vision answers: "It said to me,
`John, John, why do you doubt, or why do you fear? . . . I am the
One who is with you always: I am the Father; I am the Mother; I am
the Son.'(11) John's interpretation of the Trinity—as Father,
Mother, and Son—may not at first seem shocking but is perhaps
the more natural and spontaneous interpretation. Where the
Greek terminology for the Trinity, which includes the neuter term
for the spirit (pneuma), virtually requires that the third "Person" of
the Trinity be asexual, the author of the Secret Book looks to the
Hebrew term for spirit, ruah—a feminine word. He thus concludes,
logically enough, that the feminine "Person" conjoined with Father
and Son must be the Mother! Indeed, the text goes on to describe
the Spirit as Mother: "the image of the invisible virginal perfect



spirit.... She became the mother of the all, for she existed before
them all, the mother-father [matropater]."(l2) This same author,
therefore, alters Genesis 1Ç2 ("the Spirit of God moved upon the
face of the deep") to say, "the Mother then was moved."(13) The
secret Gospel to the Hebrews likewise has Jesus speak of "my
Mother, the Spirit."(l4) And in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus
contrasts his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, with his divine
Father—the Father of Truth—and his divine Mother, the Holy
Spirit. The author interprets a puzzling saying of Jesus in the New
Testament ("whoever does not hate his father and mother is not
worthy of me") by adding: "Whoever does not love his father and
his mother in my way cannot be my disciple; for my [earthly]
mother gave me death but my true Mother gave me the Life."(15)
Another secret gnostic gospel, the Gospel of Phillip, declares that
whoever becomes a Christian "gains both a father and a mother."
(l6) The author refers explicitly to the feminine Hebrew term to
describe the Spirit as "Mother of many."(17)
If these sources suggest that the Spirit constitutes the maternal
element of the Trinity, the Gospel of Phillip makes an equally
radical suggestion concerning the doctrine that later developed
as the virgin birth. Here again the Spirit is praised as both Mother
and Virgin, the counterpart—and consort—of the Heavenly
Father: "If I may utter a mystery, the Father of the all united with
the Virgin who came down" (l8)—that is,.with the Holy Spirit. Yet
because this process is to be understood symbolically, and not
literally, the Spirit remains a virgin! The author explains that "for
this reason, Christ was `born of a virgin'"—that is, of the Spirit, his
divine Mother. But the author ridicules those "literal-minded"
Christians who mistakenly refer the virgin birth to Mary, Jesus'
earthly mother, as if she conceived apart from Joseph: "Such
persons do not know what they are saying; for when did a female



ever impregnate a female?"(19) Instead, he argues, virgin birth
refers to the mysterious union of the two divine powers, the
Father of the All with the Holy Spirit.
Besides the eternal, mystical Silence, and besides the Holy Spirit,
certain gnostics suggest a third characterization of the divine
Mother as Wisdom. Here again the Greek feminine term for
wisdom, sophia, like the term for spirit, ruah, translates a Hebrew
feminine term, hokhmah. Early interpreters had pondered the
meaning of certain biblical passages, for example, Proverbs: "God
made the world in Wisdom." And they wondered if Wisdom could
be the feminine power in which God's creation is "conceived"? In
such passages, at any rate, Wisdom bears two connotations: first,
she bestows the Spirit that makes mankind wise; second, she is a
creative power. One gnostic source calls her the "first universal
creator";(20) another says that God the Father was speaking to
her when he proposed to "make mankind in our image."(21) The
Great Announcement, a mystical writing, explains the Genesis
account in the following terms: "One Power that is above and
below, self-generating, self-discovering, its own mother; its own
father; its own sister; its own son: Father, Mother, unity, Root of all
things."(22) The same author explains the mystical meaning of the
Garden of Eden as a symbol of the womb: "Scripture teaches us
that this is what is meant when Isaiah says, `I am he that formed
thee in thy mother's womb' [Isaiah 44Ç2]. The Garden of Eden,
then, is Moses' symbolic term for the womb, and Eden the
placenta, and the river which comes out of Eden the navel, which
nourishes the fetus."(23) This teacher claims that the Exodus,
consequently, symbolizes the exodus from the womb, "and the
crossing of the Red Sea, they say, refers to the blood." Evidence
for this view, he adds, comes directly from "the cry of the
newborn," a spontaneous cry of praise for "the glory of the primal



being, in which all the powers above are in harmonious embrace."
(24)
The introduction of such symbolism in gnostic texts clearly bears
implications for the understanding of human nature. The Great
Announcement, for example, having described the Source as a
masculo- feminine being, a "bisexual Power," goes on to say that
"what came into being from that Power, that is, humanity, being
one, is found to be two: a male-female being that bears the
female within it."(25) This refers to the story of Eve's "birth" out of
Adam's side (so that Adam, being one, is "discovered to be two,"
an androgyne who "bears the female within him"). Yet this
reference to the creation story of Genesis 2—an account which
inverts the biological birth process, and so effectively denies the
creative function of the female—proves to be unusual in gnostic
sources. More often, such sources refer instead to the first
creation account in Genesis 1Ç26-27. ("And God said, let us make
mankind in Our image, after Our image and likeness . . . in the
image of God he created him: male and female he created them").
Rabbis in Talmudic times knew a Greek version of the passage,
one that suggested to Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman that "when the
Holy One . . . first created mankind, he created him with two
faces, two sets of genitals, four arms, and legs, back to back:
Then he split Adam in two, and made two backs, one on each
side."(26) Some Jewish teachers (perhaps influenced by the story
in Plato's Symposium) had suggested that Genesis 1Ç26-27
narrates an androgynous creation—an idea that gnostics adopted
and developed. Marcus (whose prayer to the Mother is given
above) not only concludes from this account that God is dyadic
("Let us make mankind") but also that "mankind, which was
formed according to the image and likeness of God [Father and
Mother] was masculo-feminine."(27) And his contemporary,



Theodotus, explains: "the saying that Adam was created `male
and female' means that the male and female elements together
constitute the finest production of the Mother, Wisdom."(28) We
can see, then, that the gnostic sources which describe God in
both masculine and feminine terms often give a similar description
of human nature as a dyadic entity, consisting of two equal male
and female components.
All the texts cited above—secret "gospels," revelations, mystical
teachings—are among those rejected from the select list of
twenty-six that comprise the "New Testament" collection As
these and other writings were sorted and judged by various
Christian communities, every one of these texts which gnostic
groups revered and shared was rejected from the canonical
collection as "heterodox" by those who called themselves
"orthodox" (literally, straight-thinking) Christians. By the time this
process was concluded, probably as late as the year A.D. 200,
virtually all the feminine imagery for God (along with any
suggestion of an androgynous human creation) had disappeared
from "orthodox" Christian tradition.
What is the reason for this wholesale rejection ? The gnostics
themselves asked this question of their "orthodox" attackers and
pondered it among themselves. Some concluded that the God of
Israel himself initiated the polemics against gnostic teaching
which his followers carried out in his name. They argued that he
was a derivative, merely instrumental power, whom the divine
Mother had created to administer the universe, but who remained
ignorant of the power of Wisdom, his own Mother: "They say that
the creator believed that he created everything by himself, but
that, in reality, he had made them because his Mother, Wisdom,
infused him with energy, and had given him her ideas. But he was



unaware that the ideas he used came from her: he was even
ignorant of his own Mother."(29) Followers of Valentinus
suggested that the Mother herself encouraged the God of Israel
to think that he was acting autonomously in creating the world;
but, as one teacher adds, "It was because he was foolish and
ignorant of his Mother that he said, `I am God; there is none
beside me.' "(30) Others attribute to him the more sinister motive
of jealousy, among them the Secret Book of John: "He said, `I am
a jealous God, and you shall have no other God before me,'
already indicating that another god does exist. For if there were
no other god, of whom would he be jealous? Then the Mother
began to be distressed."(31) A third gnostic teacher describes the
Lord's shock, terror, and anxiety "when he discovered that he was
not the God of the universe." Gradually his shock and fear gave
way to wonder, and finally he came to welcome the teaching of
Wisdom. The gnostic teacher concluded: "This is the meaning of
the saying, `The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.' "

What Became of God the Mother?

Further research might disclose how social and cultural forces
converged to suppress feminine symbolism—and women's
participation— from western Christian tradition. Given such
research, the history of Christianity never could be told in the
same way again.



Conflicting Images of God in Early Christianity
Elaine H.Pagels.
All of these are, of course, mythical explanations. To look for the



actual, historical reasons why these gnostic writings were
suppressed is an extremely difficult proposition, for it raises the
much larger question of how (i.e., by what means and what
criteria) certain ideas, including those expressed in the texts cited
above, came to be classified as heretical and others as orthodox
by the beginning of the third century. Although the research is still
in its early stages, and this question is far from being solved, we
may find one clue if we ask whether these secret groups derived
any practical, social consequences from their conception of God
—and of mankind—that included the feminine element? Here
again the answer is yes and can be found in the orthodox texts
themselves. Irenaeus, an orthodox bishop, for example, notes
with dismay that women in particular are attracted to heretical
groups—especially to Marcus's circle, in which prayers are
offered to the Mother in her aspects as Silence, Grace, and
Wisdom; women priests serve the eucharist together with men;
and women also speak as prophets, uttering to the whole
community what "the Spirit" reveals to them.(33) Professing
himself to be at a loss to understand the attraction that Marcus's
group holds, he offers only one explanation: that Marcus himself
is a diabolically successful seducer, a magician who compounds
special aphrodisiacs to "deceive, victimize, and defile" these
"many foolish women!" Whether his accusation has any factual
basis is difficult, probably impossible, to ascertain. Nevertheless,
the historian notes that accusations of sexual license are a stock
in-trade of polemical arguments.(34) The bishop refuses to admit
the possibility that the group might attract Christians—especially
women—for sound and comprehensible reasons. While
expressing his own moral outrage, Tertullian, another "father of
the church," reveals his fundamental desire to keep women out of
religion: "These heretical women—how audacious they are! They
have no modesty: they are bold enough to teach, to engage in



argument, to enact exorcisms, to undertake cures, and, it may be,
even to baptize!"(35) Tertullian directs yet another attack against
"that viper"—a woman teacher who led a congregation in North
Africa.(36) Marcion had, in fact, scandalized his "orthodox"
contemporaries by appointing women on an equal basis with men
as priests and bishops among his congregations.(37) The teacher
Marcillina also traveled to Rome to represent the Carpocratian
group, an esoteric circle that claimed to have received secret
teaching from Mary, Salome, and Martha.(38) And among the
Montanists, a radical prophetic circle, the prophet Philumene was
reputed to have hired a male secretary to transcribe her inspired
oracles.(39)
Other secret texts, such as the Gospel of Mary Magdalene and
the Wisdom of Faith, suggest that the activity of such women
leaders challenged and therefore was challenged by the orthodox
communities who regarded Peter as their spokesman. The Gospel
of Mary relates that Mary tried to encourage the disciples after
the crucifixion and to tell them what the Lord had told her
privately. Peter, furious at the suggestion, asks, "Did he then talk
secretly with a woman, instead of to us? Are we to go and learn
from her now? Did he love her more than us?" Distressed at his
rage, Mary then asks Peter: "What do you think? Do you think I
made this up in my heart? Do you think I am lying about the
Lord?" Levi breaks in at this point to mediate the dispute: "Peter,
you are always irascible. You object to the woman as our enemies
do. Surely the Lord knew her very well, and indeed, he loved her
more than us." Then he and the others invite Mary to teach them
what she knows.(40) Another argument between Peter and Mary
occurs in Wisdom of Faith. Peter complains that Mary is
dominating the conversation, even to the point of displacing the
rightful priority of Peter himself and his brethren; he urges Jesus



to silence her—and is quickly rebuked. Later, however, Mary
admits to Jesus that she hardly dares to speak freely with him,
because "Peter makes me hesitate: I am afraid of him, because he
hates the female race." Jesus replies that whoever receives
inspiration from the Spirit is divinely ordained to speak, whether
man or woman.(41)
As these texts suggest, then, women were considered equal to
men, they were revered as prophets, and they acted as teachers,
traveling evangelists, healers, priests, and even bishops. In some
of these groups, they played leading roles and were excluded
from them in the orthodox churches, at least by A.D. 150-200. Is it
possible, then, that the recognition of the feminine element in God
and the recognition of mankind as a male and female entity bore
within it the explosive social possibility of women acting on an
equal basis with men in positions of authority and leadership? If
this were true, it might lead to the conclusion that these gnostic
groups, together with their conception of God and human nature,
were suppressed only because of their positive attitude toward
women. But such a conclusion would be a mistake—a hasty and
simplistic reading of the evidence. In the first place, orthodox
Christian doctrine is far from wholly negative in its attitude toward
women. Second, many other elements of the gnostic sources
diverge in fundamental ways from what came to be accepted as
orthodox Christian teaching. To examine this process in detail
would require a much more extensive discussion than is possible
here. Nevertheless, the evidence does indicate that two very
different patterns of sexual attitudes emerged in orthodox and
gnostic circles. In simplest form, gnostic theologians correlate
their description of God in both masculine and feminine terms
with a complementary description of human nature. Most often
they refer to the creation account of Genesis 1, which suggests an



equal (or even androgynous) creation of mankind. This
conception carries the principle of equality between men and
women into the practical social and political structures of gnostic
communities. The orthodox pattern is strikingly different: it
describes God in exclusively masculine terms and often uses
Genesis 2 to describe how Eve was created from Adam and for his
fulfillment. Like the gnostic view, the orthodox also translates into
sociological practice: by the late second century, orthodox
Christians came to accept the domination of men over women as
the proper, God-given order—not only for the human race, but
also for the Christian churches. This correlation between
theology, anthropology, and sociology is not lost on the apostle
Paul. In his letter to the disorderly Corinthian community, he
reminds them of a divinely ordained chain of authority: As God
has authority over Christ, so the man has authority over the
woman, argues Paul, citing Genesis 2: "The man is the image and
glory of God, but the woman is the glory of man. For man is not
from woman, but woman from man; and besides, the man was not
created for the woman's sake, but the woman for the sake of the
man."(42) Here the three elements of the orthodox pattern are
welded into one simple argument: the description of God
corresponds to a description of human nature which authorizes
the social pattern of male domination.
A striking exception to this orthodox pattern occurs in the writings
of one revered "father of the church," Clement of Alexandria.
Clement identifies himself as orthodox, although he knows
members of gnostic groups and their writings well; some scholars
suggest that he was himself a gnostic initiate. Yet his own works
demonstrate how all three elements of what we have called the
"gnostic pattern" could be worked into fully "orthodox" teaching.
First, Clement characterizes God not only in masculine but also in



feminine terms: "The Word is everything to the child, both father
and mother, teacher and nurse.... The nutriment is the milk of the
father. . . and the Word alone supplies us children with the milk of
love, and only those who suck at this breast are truly happy.... For
this reason seeking is called sucking; to those infants who seek
the Word, the Father's loving breasts supply milk.(43) Second, in
describing human nature, he insists that "men and women share
equally in perfection, and are to receive the same instruction and
discipline. For the name `humanity' is common to both men and
women; and for us `in Christ there is neither male nor female.'"
(44) Even in considering the active participation of women with
men in the Christian community Clement offers a list—unique in
orthodox tradition—of women whose achievements he admires.
They range from ancient examples, like Judith, the assassin who
destroyed Israel's enemy, to Queen Esther, who rescued her
people from genocide, as well as others who took radical political
stands. He speaks of Arignole the historian, of Themisto the
Epicurean philosopher, and of many other women philosophers,
including two who studied with Plato and one trained by Socrates.
Indeed, he cannot contain his praise: "What shall I say? Did not
Theano the Pythagoran make such progress in philosophy that
when a man, staring at her, said, `Your arm is beautiful,' she
replied, `Yes, but it is not on public display.'"(45) Clement
concludes his list with famous women poets and painters.
If the work of Clement, who taught in Egypt before the lines of
orthodoxy and heresy were rigidly drawn (ca. A.D. 160-80)
demonstrates how gnostic principles could be incorporated even
into orthodox Christian teaching, the majority of communities in
the western empire headed by Rome did not follow his example.
By the year A.D. 200, Roman Christians endorsed as "canonical"
the pseudo-Pauline letter to Timothy, which interpreted Paul's



views: "Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness. I do
not allow any woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man;
she is to remain silent, for [note Gen. 2!] Adam was formed first,
then Eve and furthermore, Adam was not deceived, but the
woman was utterly seduced and came into sin."(45) How are we
to account for this irreversible development? The question
deserves investigation which this discussion can only initiate. For
example, one would need to examine how (and for what reasons)
the zealously patriarchal traditions of Israel were adopted by the
Roman (and other) Christian communities. Further research might
disclose how social and cultural forces converged to suppress
feminine symbolism—and women's participation— from western
Christian tradition. Given such research, the history of Christianity
never could be told in the same way again.

Elaine H. Pagels received her Ph. D. from Harvard University and
now teaches at Barnard College, Columbia University. She is
author of The Johannine Gospel in Gnostic Exegesis and The
Gnostic Paul. Her articles have appeared in Harvard Theological
Review, Journal for Biblical Literature, and Journal of the

Unlike many of his contemporaries among the deities of the
ancient Near East, the God of Israel shares his power with no
female divinity, nor is he the divine Husband or Lover of any.(l) He
scarcely can be characterized in any but masculine epithets: King,
Lord, Master, Judge, and Father.(2) Indeed, the absence of
feminine symbolism of God marks Judaism, Christianity, and Islam
in striking contrast to the worldʼs other religious traditions,
whether in Egypt, Babylonia, Greece, and Rome or Africa,
Polynesia, India, and North America. Jewish, Christian, and Islamic
theologians, however, are quick to point out that God is not to be
considered in sexual terms at all. Yet the actual language they use
daily in worship and prayer conveys a different message and gives
the distinct impression that God is thought of in exclusively
masculine terms. And while it is true that Catholics revere Mary as
the mother of Jesus, she cannot be identified as divine in her own
right: if she is “mother of God,” she is not “God the Mother” on an
equal footing with God the Father.
Christianity, of course, added the trinitarian terms to the Jewish
description of God. And yet of the three divine “Persons,” two
the Father and Son—are described in masculine terms, and the
third—the Spirit—suggests the sexlessness of the Greek neuter
term pneuma. This is not merely a subjective impression.
Whoever investigates the early development of Christianity—the
field called “patristics,” that is, study of “the fathers of the
church”—may not be surprised by the passage that concludes
the recently discovered, secret Gospel of Thomas: “Simon Peter
said to them [the disciples], ‘Let Mary be excluded from among
us, for she is a woman, and not worthy of Life.ʼ Jesus said, ‘Behold



I will take Mary, and make her a male, so that she may become a
living spirit, resembling you males. For I tell you truly, that every
female who makes herself male will enter the Kingdom of
Heaven.ʼ”(3) Strange as it sounds, this only states explicitly what
religious rhetoric often assumes: that the men form the legitimate
body of the community, while women will be allowed to participate
only insofar as their own identity is denied and assimilated to that
of the men.
Further exploration of the texts which include this Gospel—written
on papyrus, hidden in large clay jars nearly 1,600 years ago—has
identified them as Jewish and Christian gnostic works which were
attacked and condemned as “heretical” as early as A.D. 100
150. What distinguishes these “heterodox” texts from those that
are called “orthodox” is at least partially clear: they abound in
feminine symbolism that is applied, in particular, to God. Although
one might expect, then, that they would recall the archaic pagan
traditions of the Mother Goddess, their language is to the contrary
specifically Christian, unmistakably related to a Jewish heritage.
Thus we can see that certain gnostic Christians diverged even
more radically from the Jewish tradition than the early Christians
who described God as the “three Persons” or the Trinity. For,
instead of a monistic and masculine God, certain of these texts
describe God as a dyadic being, who consists of both masculine
and feminine elements. One such group of texts, for example,
claims to have received a secret tradition from Jesus through
James, and significantly, through Mary Magdalene.(4) Members
of this group offer prayer to both the divine Father and Mother:
“From Thee, Father, and through Thee, Mother, the two immortal
names, Parents of the divine being, and thou, dweller in heaven,
mankind of the mighty name.”(5) Other texts indicate that their
authors had pondered the nature of the beings to whom a single,



masculine God proposed, “Let us make mankind in our image,
after our likeness” (Gen. 1Ç26). Since the Genesis account goes on
to say that mankind was created “male and female” (1Ç27), some
concluded, apparently, that the God in whose image we are
created likewise must be both masculine and feminine—both
Father and Mother.
The characterization of the divine Mother in these sources is not
simple since the texts themselves are extraordinarily diverse.
Nevertheless, three primary characterizations merge. First, a
certain poet and teacher, Valentinus, begins with the premise that
God is essentially indescribable. And yet he suggests that the
divine can be imagined as a Dyad consisting of two elements: one
he calls the Ineffable, the Source, the Primal Father; the other, the
Silence, the Mother of all things.(6) Although we might question
Valentinusʼs reasoning that Silence is the appropriate complement
of what is Ineffable, his equation of the former with the feminine
and the latter with the masculine may be traced to the
grammatical gender of the Greek words. Followers of Valentinus
invoke this feminine power, whom they also call “Grace” (in Greek,
the feminine term charis), in their own private celebration of the
Christian eucharist: they call her “divine, eternal Grace, She who
is before all things.”(7) At other times they pray to her for
protection as the Mother, “Thou enthroned with God, eternal,
mystical Silence.”(8) Marcus, a disciple of Valentinus, contends
that “when Moses began his account of creation, he mentioned
the Mother of all things at the very beginning, when he said, ‘In
the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth,ʼ ”(9) for
the word beginning (in Greek, the feminine arche) refers to the
divine Mother, the source of the cosmic elements. When they
describe God in this way, different gnostic writers have different
interpretations. Some maintain that the divine is to be considered



masculo-feminine—the “great male-female power.” Others insist
that the terms are meant only as metaphors—for, in reality, the
divine is neither masculine nor feminine. A third group suggests
that one can describe the Source of all things in either masculine
or feminine terms, depending on which aspect one intends to
stress.(10) Proponents of these diverse views agree, however,
that the divine is to be understood as consisting of a harmonious,
dynamic relationship of opposites—a concept that may be akin to
the eastern view of yin and yang but remains antithetical to
orthodox Judaism and Christianity.
A second characterization of the divine Mother describes her as
Holy Spirit. One source, the Secret Book of John, for example,
relates how John, the brother of James, went out after the
crucifixion with “great grief,” and had a mystical vision of the
Trinity: “As I was grieving . . . the heavens were opened, and the
whole creation shone with an unearthly light, and the universe
was shaken. I was afraid . . . and behold . . . a unity in three forms
appeared to me, and I marvelled: how can a unity have three
forms?” To Johnʼs question, the vision answers: “It said to me,
‘John, John, why do you doubt, or why do you fear? . . . I am the
One who is with you always: I am the Father; I am the Mother; I am
the Son.ʼ(11) Johnʼs interpretation of the Trinity—as Father,
Mother, and Son—may not at first seem shocking but is perhaps
the more natural and spontaneous interpretation. Where the
Greek terminology for the Trinity, which includes the neuter term
for the spirit (pneuma), virtually requires that the third "Person" of
the Trinity be asexual, the author of the Secret Book looks to the
Hebrew term for spirit, ruah—a feminine word. He thus concludes,
logically enough, that the feminine “Person” conjoined with Father
and Son must be the Mother! Indeed, the text goes on to describe
the Spirit as Mother: “the image of the invisible virginal perfect



spirit.... She became the mother of the all, for she existed before
them all, the mother-father [matropater]."(l2) This same author,
therefore, alters Genesis 1Ç2 ("the Spirit of God moved upon the
face of the deep") to say, “the Mother then was moved.”(13) The
secret Gospel to the Hebrews likewise has Jesus speak of “my
Mother, the Spirit."(l4) And in the Gospel of Thomas, Jesus
contrasts his earthly parents, Mary and Joseph, with his divine
Father—the Father of Truth—and his divine Mother, the Holy
Spirit. The author interprets a puzzling saying of Jesus in the New
Testament ("whoever does not hate his father and mother is not
worthy of me") by adding: “Whoever does not love his father and
his mother in my way cannot be my disciple; for my [earthly]
mother gave me death but my true Mother gave me the Life.”(15)
Another secret gnostic gospel, the Gospel of Phillip, declares that
whoever becomes a Christian “gains both a father and a mother."
(l6) The author refers explicitly to the feminine Hebrew term to
describe the Spirit as "Mother of many.”(17)
If these sources suggest that the Spirit constitutes the maternal
element of the Trinity, the Gospel of Phillip makes an equally
radical suggestion concerning the doctrine that later developed
as the virgin birth. Here again the Spirit is praised as both Mother
and Virgin, the counterpart—and consort—of the Heavenly
Father: “If I may utter a mystery, the Father of the all united with
the Virgin who came down" (l8)—that is,.with the Holy Spirit. Yet
because this process is to be understood symbolically, and not
literally, the Spirit remains a virgin! The author explains that "for
this reason, Christ was ‘born of a virginʼ"—that is, of the Spirit, his
divine Mother. But the author ridicules those “literal-minded”
Christians who mistakenly refer the virgin birth to Mary, Jesusʼ
earthly mother, as if she conceived apart from Joseph: “Such
persons do not know what they are saying; for when did a female



ever impregnate a female?”(19) Instead, he argues, virgin birth
refers to the mysterious union of the two divine powers, the
Father of the All with the Holy Spirit.
Besides the eternal, mystical Silence, and besides the Holy Spirit,
certain gnostics suggest a third characterization of the divine
Mother as Wisdom. Here again the Greek feminine term for
wisdom, sophia, like the term for spirit, ruah, translates a Hebrew
feminine term, hokhmah. Early interpreters had pondered the
meaning of certain biblical passages, for example, Proverbs: “God
made the world in Wisdom.” And they wondered if Wisdom could
be the feminine power in which Godʼs creation is “conceived”? In
such passages, at any rate, Wisdom bears two connotations: first,
she bestows the Spirit that makes mankind wise; second, she is a
creative power. One gnostic source calls her the “first universal
creator”;(20) another says that God the Father was speaking to
her when he proposed to “make mankind in our image."(21) The
Great Announcement, a mystical writing, explains the Genesis
account in the following terms: "One Power that is above and
below, self-generating, self-discovering, its own mother; its own
father; its own sister; its own son: Father, Mother, unity, Root of all
things."(22) The same author explains the mystical meaning of the
Garden of Eden as a symbol of the womb: “Scripture teaches us
that this is what is meant when Isaiah says, ‘I am he that formed
thee in thy motherʼs wombʼ [Isaiah 44Ç2]. The Garden of Eden,
then, is Mosesʼ symbolic term for the womb, and Eden the
placenta, and the river which comes out of Eden the navel, which
nourishes the fetus.”(23) This teacher claims that the Exodus,
consequently, symbolizes the exodus from the womb, “and the
crossing of the Red Sea, they say, refers to the blood.” Evidence
for this view, he adds, comes directly from “the cry of the
newborn,” a spontaneous cry of praise for “the glory of the primal



being, in which all the powers above are in harmonious
embrace.”(24)
The introduction of such symbolism in gnostic texts clearly bears
implications for the understanding of human nature. The Great
Announcement, for example, having described the Source as a
masculo-feminine being, a “bisexual Power,” goes on to say that
“what came into being from that Power, that is, humanity, being
one, is found to be two: a male-female being that bears the
female within it.”(25) This refers to the story of Eveʼs “birth” out of
Adamʼs side (so that Adam, being one, is “discovered to be two,”
an androgyne who “bears the female within him”). Yet this
reference to the creation story of Genesis 2—an account which
inverts the biological birth process, and so effectively denies the
creative function of the female—proves to be unusual in gnostic
sources. More often, such sources refer instead to the first
creation account in Genesis 1Ç26-27. (“And God said, let us make
mankind in Our image, after Our image and likeness . . . in the
image of God he created him: male and female he created them”).
Rabbis in Talmudic times knew a Greek version of the passage,
one that suggested to Rabbi Samuel bar Nahman that “when the
Holy One . . . first created mankind, he created him with two
faces, two sets of genitals, four arms, and legs, back to back:
Then he split Adam in two, and made two backs, one on each
side.”(26) Some Jewish teachers (perhaps influenced by the story
in Platoʼs Symposium) had suggested that Genesis 1Ç26-27
narrates an androgynous creation—an idea that gnostics adopted
and developed. Marcus (whose prayer to the Mother is given
above) not only concludes from this account that God is dyadic
(“Let us make mankind”) but also that “mankind, which was
formed according to the image and likeness of God [Father and
Mother] was masculo-feminine.”(27) And his contemporary,



Theodotus, explains: “the saying that Adam was created ‘male
and femaleʼ means that the male and female elements together
constitute the finest production of the Mother, Wisdom.”(28) We
can see, then, that the gnostic sources which describe God in
both masculine and feminine terms often give a similar description
of human nature as a dyadic entity, consisting of two equal male
and female components.
All the texts cited above—secret “gospels,” revelations, mystical
teachings—are among those rejected from the select list of
twenty-six that comprise the “New Testament” collection As
these and other writings were sorted and judged by various
Christian communities, every one of these texts which gnostic
groups revered and shared was rejected from the canonical
collection as “heterodox” by those who called themselves
“orthodox” (literally, straight-thinking) Christians. By the time this
process was concluded, probably as late as the year A.D. 200,
virtually all the feminine imagery for God (along with any
suggestion of an androgynous human creation) had disappeared
from “orthodox” Christian tradition.
What is the reason for this wholesale rejection ? The gnostics
themselves asked this question of their “orthodox” attackers and
pondered it among themselves. Some concluded that the God of
Israel himself initiated the polemics against gnostic teaching
which his followers carried out in his name. They argued that he
was a derivative, merely instrumental power, whom the divine
Mother had created to administer the universe, but who remained
ignorant of the power of Wisdom, his own Mother: “They say that
the creator believed that he created everything by himself, but
that, in reality, he had made them because his Mother, Wisdom,
infused him with energy, and had given him her ideas. But he was
unaware that the ideas he used came from her: he was even



ignorant of his own Mother.”(29) Followers of Valentinus
suggested that the Mother herself encouraged the God of Israel
to think that he was acting autonomously in creating the world;
but, as one teacher adds, “It was because he was foolish and
ignorant of his Mother that he said, ‘I am God; there is none
beside me.ʼ ”(30) Others attribute to him the more sinister motive
of jealousy, among them the Secret Book of John: “He said, ‘I am
a jealous God, and you shall have no other God before me,ʼ
already indicating that another god does exist. For if there were
no other god, of whom would he be jealous? Then the Mother
began to be distressed.”(31) A third gnostic teacher describes the
Lordʼs shock, terror, and anxiety “when he discovered that he was
not the God of the universe.” Gradually his shock and fear gave
way to wonder, and finally he came to welcome the teaching of
Wisdom. The gnostic teacher concluded: “This is the meaning of
the saying, ‘The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom.ʼ ”(32)
All of these are, of course, mythical explanations. To look for the
actual, historical reasons why these gnostic writings were
suppressed is an extremely difficult proposition, for it raises the
much larger question of how (i.e., by what means and what
criteria) certain ideas, including those expressed in the texts cited
above, came to be classified as heretical and others as orthodox
by the beginning of the third century. Although the research is still
in its early stages, and this question is far from being solved, we
may find one clue if we ask whether these secret groups derived
any practical, social consequences from their conception of God
—and of mankind—that included the feminine element? Here
again the answer is yes and can be found in the orthodox texts
themselves. Irenaeus, an orthodox bishop, for example, notes
with dismay that women in particular are attracted to heretical
groups—especially to Marcusʼs circle, in which prayers are offered



to the Mother in her aspects as Silence, Grace, and Wisdom;
women priests serve the eucharist together with men; and women
also speak as prophets, uttering to the whole community what
“the Spirit” reveals to them.(33) Professing himself to be at a loss
to understand the attraction that Marcusʼs group holds, he offers
only one explanation: that Marcus himself is a diabolically
successful seducer, a magician who compounds special
aphrodisiacs to “deceive, victimize, and defile” these “many
foolish women!” Whether his accusation has any factual basis is
difficult, probably impossible, to ascertain. Nevertheless, the
historian notes that accusations of sexual license are a stock-in
trade of polemical arguments.(34) The bishop refuses to admit
the possibility that the group might attract Christians—especially
women—for sound and comprehensible reasons. While
expressing his own moral outrage, Tertullian, another “father of
the church,” reveals his fundamental desire to keep women out of
religion: “These heretical women—how audacious they are! They
have no modesty: they are bold enough to teach, to engage in
argument, to enact exorcisms, to undertake cures, and, it may be,
even to baptize!”(35) Tertullian directs yet another attack against
“that viper”—a woman teacher who led a congregation in North
Africa.(36) Marcion had, in fact, scandalized his “orthodox”
contemporaries by appointing women on an equal basis with men
as priests and bishops among his congregations.(37) The teacher
Marcillina also traveled to Rome to represent the Carpocratian
group, an esoteric circle that claimed to have received secret
teaching from Mary, Salome, and Martha.(38) And among the
Montanists, a radical prophetic circle, the prophet Philumene was
reputed to have hired a male secretary to transcribe her inspired
oracles.(39)
Other secret texts, such as the Gospel of Mary Magdalene and



the Wisdom of Faith, suggest that the activity of such women
leaders challenged and therefore was challenged by the orthodox
communities who regarded Peter as their spokesman. The Gospel
of Mary relates that Mary tried to encourage the disciples after
the crucifixion and to tell them what the Lord had told her
privately. Peter, furious at the suggestion, asks, “Did he then talk
secretly with a woman, instead of to us? Are we to go and learn
from her now? Did he love her more than us?” Distressed at his
rage, Mary then asks Peter: “What do you think? Do you think I
made this up in my heart? Do you think I am lying about the
Lord?” Levi breaks in at this point to mediate the dispute: “Peter,
you are always irascible. You object to the woman as our enemies
do. Surely the Lord knew her very well, and indeed, he loved her
more than us.” Then he and the others invite Mary to teach them
what she knows.(40) Another argument between Peter and Mary
occurs in Wisdom of Faith. Peter complains that Mary is
dominating the conversation, even to the point of displacing the
rightful priority of Peter himself and his brethren; he urges Jesus
to silence her—and is quickly rebuked. Later, however, Mary
admits to Jesus that she hardly dares to speak freely with him,
because “Peter makes me hesitate: I am afraid of him, because he
hates the female race.” Jesus replies that whoever receives
inspiration from the Spirit is divinely ordained to speak, whether
man or woman.(41)
As these texts suggest, then, women were considered equal to
men, they were revered as prophets, and they acted as teachers,
traveling evangelists, healers, priests, and even bishops. In some
of these groups, they played leading roles and were excluded
from them in the orthodox churches, at least by A.D. 150-200. Is it
possible, then, that the recognition of the feminine element in God
and the recognition of mankind as a male and female entity bore



within it the explosive social possibility of women acting on an
equal basis with men in positions of authority and leadership? If
this were true, it might lead to the conclusion that these gnostic
groups, together with their conception of God and human nature,
were suppressed only because of their positive attitude toward
women. But such a conclusion would be a mistake—a hasty and
simplistic reading of the evidence. In the first place, orthodox
Christian doctrine is far from wholly negative in its attitude toward
women. Second, many other elements of the gnostic sources
diverge in fundamental ways from what came to be accepted as
orthodox Christian teaching. To examine this process in detail
would require a much more extensive discussion than is possible
here. Nevertheless, the evidence does indicate that two very
different patterns of sexual attitudes emerged in orthodox and
gnostic circles. In simplest form, gnostic theologians correlate
their description of God in both masculine and feminine terms
with a complementary description of human nature. Most often
they refer to the creation account of Genesis 1, which suggests an
equal (or even androgynous) creation of mankind. This
conception carries the principle of equality between men and
women into the practical social and political structures of gnostic
communities. The orthodox pattern is strikingly different: it
describes God in exclusively masculine terms and often uses
Genesis 2 to describe how Eve was created from Adam and for his
fulfillment. Like the gnostic view, the orthodox also translates into
sociological practice: by the late second century, orthodox
Christians came to accept the domination of men over women as
the proper, God-given order—not only for the human race, but
also for the Christian churches. This correlation between
theology, anthropology, and sociology is not lost on the apostle
Paul. In his letter to the disorderly Corinthian community, he
reminds them of a divinely ordained chain of authority: As God



has authority over Christ, so the man has authority over the
woman, argues Paul, citing Genesis 2: “The man is the image and
glory of God, but the woman is the glory of man. For man is not
from woman, but woman from man; and besides, the man was not
created for the womanʼs sake, but the woman for the sake of the
man.”(42) Here the three elements of the orthodox pattern are
welded into one simple argument: the description of God
corresponds to a description of human nature which authorizes
the social pattern of male domination.
A striking exception to this orthodox pattern occurs in the writings
of one revered “father of the church,” Clement of Alexandria.
Clement identifies himself as orthodox, although he knows
members of gnostic groups and their writings well; some scholars
suggest that he was himself a gnostic initiate. Yet his own works
demonstrate how all three elements of what we have called the
“gnostic pattern” could be worked into fully “orthodox” teaching.
First, Clement characterizes God not only in masculine but also in
feminine terms: “The Word is everything to the child, both father
and mother, teacher and nurse.... The nutriment is the milk of the
father. . . and the Word alone supplies us children with the milk of
love, and only those who suck at this breast are truly happy.... For
this reason seeking is called sucking; to those infants who seek
the Word, the Fatherʼs loving breasts supply milk.(43) Second, in
describing human nature, he insists that “men and women share
equally in perfection, and are to receive the same instruction and
discipline. For the name ‘humanityʼ is common to both men and
women; and for us ‘in Christ there is neither male nor
female.ʼ”(44) Even in considering the active participation of
women with men in the Christian community Clement offers a list
—unique in orthodox tradition—of women whose achievements
he admires. They range from ancient examples, like Judith, the



assassin who destroyed Israelʼs enemy, to Queen Esther, who
rescued her people from genocide, as well as others who took
radical political stands. He speaks of Arignole the historian, of
Themisto the Epicurean philosopher, and of many other women
philosophers, including two who studied with Plato and one
trained by Socrates. Indeed, he cannot contain his praise: “What
shall I say? Did not Theano the Pythagoran make such progress in
philosophy that when a man, staring at her, said, ‘Your arm is
beautiful,ʼ she replied, ‘Yes, but it is not on public display.ʼ”(45)
Clement concludes his list with famous women poets and
painters.
If the work of Clement, who taught in Egypt before the lines of
orthodoxy and heresy were rigidly drawn (ca. A.D. 160-80)
demonstrates how gnostic principles could be incorporated even
into orthodox Christian teaching, the majority of communities in
the western empire headed by Rome did not follow his example.
By the year A.D. 200, Roman Christians endorsed as “canonical”
the pseudo-Pauline letter to Timothy, which interpreted Paulʼs
views: “Let a woman learn in silence with full submissiveness. I do
not allow any woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man;
she is to remain silent, for [note Gen. 2!] Adam was formed first,
then Eve and furthermore, Adam was not deceived, but the
woman was utterly seduced and came into sin.”(45) How are we
to account for this irreversible development? The question
deserves investigation which this discussion can only initiate. For
example, one would need to examine how (and for what reasons)
the zealously patriarchal traditions of Israel were adopted by the
Roman (and other) Christian communities. Further research might
disclose how social and cultural forces converged to suppress
feminine symbolism—and womenʼs participation—from western
Christian tradition. Given such research, the history of Christianity



never could be told in the same way again.
