The Great Stag, A Sumerian Divinity and its Affiliation
by Bobula Ida, Ph.D.
One of the elements of human culture which migrated from Western
Asia into the Western World seems to be the concept of a benevolent,
divine father who created mankind out of clay and who cares for the
welfare of the Earth.
The Mesopotamian divinity, who in contrast with most other male
gods of the early Pantheon, was considered benevolent, was the
water-god Enki. It seems that his cult was so deep-rooted that it
survived the fall of Babylonia and was inherited by many younger
nations, who brought it to Europe, where traditions which have come
down to modern times seem to be the still-living fragments of this
ancient cult.
Enki came to be known later as Ea.1 Ea's name was written with four
strokes of the stylus; it seems that his holy number was four times ten:
forty.2 It may be inferred from one of the texts that he was considered
-at least in one period- the fourth in rank of the "Great Gods".3 He was
supposed to be the child of Enlil4 and the goddess Nammu, the
primeval sea.5
Enki was one of the first divinities of the Sumerian Pantheon to be
identified by archaeologists, more than 50 years ago6, as the water
god, whose regular attribute was the spouting, overflowing vase and
two streams with fish.
The figure of Enki appears on many cylinder seals and other
monuments.7 Seldom standing—more often seated on his throne—he



wears the horned, high hat of the great gods8, and often holds the rod
and the ring, symbols of divine power, which in Sumerian art
distinguish gods from mortals, but which are not special attributes of
any one god.9 His special attribute is a horned animal, usually the ibex
or mountain goat, which is often depicted together with the fish. On a
few seals a third animal appears in Enki's presence: a bird which
seems to be the eagle. Later the fish and the horned animal are
contracted into one single monster: the well-known fish-ram symbol
of Ea, which has long been recognized as a sign of the Zodiac.10
Many authors have asked: why is the name of the water-god Enki,
which means "Lord of the Land"? Frankfort answers: in the marshes of
Southern Mesopotamia land and water are so intimately mixed that
they seem to be essentially the same!"11 We cannot agree: land and
water must have been contrasted even in the primitive Mesopotamian
mind. But Ki did not mean "land" only, it meant "earth", too; and we
may presume that Enki was supposed to be the Lord of Earth. The
three animals which we see around Enki—the fish, the bird and the
horned goat-may well symbolize the totality of the animal world—all
that flies, swims or runs. Water is essential to the life of all of them.
The transparent symbolism of Sumerian creation myths makes it clear
that Father Enki was regarded as creator and special father of the
plants, too, who are mothered by many goddesses.12 Finally the
goddesses inspired Enki to create man, which he did -fashioning men
from clay, to be the servants of the gods.13 Being thus responsible for
the existence of man, Enki was naturally supposed to take far more
interest in his creatures than any other god. Enki organized the
peoples and decreed fates for them.14 He taught man agriculture,
cattle-breeding and industry. He gave to mankind "bread to eat". He
wrote all the fundamental laws of civilization on clay tablets. These
were kept in Enki temple at Eridu. He was the god of wisdom, healing
and every other kind of magic. In danger he was the helper. He saved



humanity from the deluge by secretly instructing Ut-Napistim, the
Sumerian Noah, to build an ark in which he survived.
This myth, so reminiscent of the Biblical story, has led some earlier
authors to believe that the strongly delineated square in which Ea's
figure sometimes appears is the Ark15. Lately it is believed rather that
this square symbolizes Ea's home in the watery depths.16
It is possible that the square connected with Ea-the square which
surrounds him or on which he sits-is the symbol of the World, which
in the Sumerian mind was something four-cornered.17 The square is
sometimes marked with a cross, a sign which is related to the number
40.
The most frequent divine companion of Ea is his Janus-faced
messenger, whose name has been read as Usmu or Isimud. He is the
man sent by the god on various errands.18 Another form of Ea's
servant is that of the fish-man. Often we see one or two gigantic
doorkeepers19 by the throne of Ea20 ; these are called the twins.21
Enki-Ea had many names22, one of them was Dara-Mah "The Great
Stag"23. On this quality of Ea we may read numerous comments.24
This name of Ea was probably of astrological origin, connected with
his benevolent activities as helper of the Sun, his nephew, whom he
liberates daily from his mountain grave.
It seems that the Zodiac was the subject of early speculations by
Sumerian -maybe pre-Sumerian-astrologers. In the early art of the
Near East we find everywhere horned animals -stags, deer, goats,
ibexes -who wear between their horns the sun-disc or a symbol of it,
which may be a square, a cross or a sun-bird: the eagle.25 The
examples are well known, beginning with the pottery of Susa I.
Sometimes, instead of two horns, there are two animals flanking the
Sun symbol.26 If we ask, why is this motive so widespread, we may



suppose: because it was a message of joy and happiness. When the
Sun appears between the horns of the heavenly stag -ie. at the winter
solstice-winter is passing, the sun regains its former strength, the days
are getting longer, a new cycle, a new year begins. A disc or a bird
between horns must have stood for the Great Stag, bringing back the
Sun between its horns.27
The rout of winter darkness and the retrieving of the Sun must have
meant the greatest possible service to a more or less primitive human
society. No wonder that the cult of the benefactor persisted so long.
Helping humanity is traditional in Ea's family. His son, Dumuzig
later known as Tammuz and much later as Adonis—is the shepherd
god who dies with the dying vegetation, but comes back to life, too,
like the plants. The epithet of this god is SABA (staff holder, shepherd
prince), which recalls the name Csaba of the young prince of
Hungarian legends, the immortal hero who always returns to help his
people. His plant has the power to heal all wounds, too, probably
being related to the evergreen Tree of Life, which is the symbol of
Tammuz. [The source of the Hungarian name of Spring, Tavasz.m/v
common in Hungarian.—Fred]
Two Hungarian chronicles preserved a name taken from the ancient
pagan religion: that of the god DAMACSEC. This corresponds
obviously to DUMUZIG. After the conversion of the Hungarians to
Christianity, most of the legends which made up the Magian religion
of the forefathers, were discarded. Yet, the Csaba story survived. The
figure of csaba was smuggled over, from mythology to history, by
medieval chronicle writers, who rationalized the concept: "son of the
great Ruler" and wrote that Csaba was son of Attila, king of the Huns.
We are informed by those chronicles that the real Huns rallied around
Csaba, who saved a small group when most of them were killed, led
them to safety and bid them to prepare for reconquering Panonnia.



Arpad, the historical figure of the Hungarian conquest in the ninth
century A.D., is said to be a descendant of legendary Csaba. [Who
married a Chorezmian woman in Scythia.]
It is well possible that in contrast with his father, Dar- Mah, the Great
Stag, Saba was once thought of as the Little Stag or goat which would
sound as Dar-Ge. This could account for later divine names in the
Near East, like Tarku, Targitaos [ancestor of the Scythians], etc;
ultimately for the names TURK and TURAN, this later being the land
covered by the Norther Sky, the sky of Carpricorn as opposed to IRAN,
covered by the Southern Sky (UR-AN), the sky of Leo. On the seal of
the Kassites -a people of speech and race which is little known but of
whom Moortgart remarks that they had many graphic ideas and
symbols in common with the early Sumerians—we often see a divinity
who may be Ea, or rather Marduk, the son of Ea. On these seals the
Kassite cross appears frequently.28 We see also in the art of the
mountain peoples, neighbors of Mesopotamia, horned animals
defending the Tree of Life.
Sumerian thought deeply influenced Greek thought. We may wonder
like the British editor of Lenormant-whether the cult of EA had not
something to do with the idea of Thales, that the first cause of all
things was water? May not EA have influenced the use of the word EU
"good"? [Hungarian YO] Had father Ea something to do with the
concept of a later EU-piter? [The Japhet of the Bible?]
On the peripheries, far away in space and time, a snake cult, or a tree
cult seems indicative of some cult of Ea and his family.29 But the
staunchest survivor seems to be the stag cult.
Indeed, the Celtic divinity Cernunnos, so ably described by Phyllis
Pray Bober, may well be one of Ea's late manifestations.30 He is a god
of waters, like Ea, wearing horns and a torque (the ring, left over after



disappearance of the rod) like Sumerian divinities, and accompanied
by a horned serpent, which is probably a variant of Ea's horned fish.
(The water streams of Ea, if they are carelessly drawn, may easily be
mistaken for snakes.)
The Celts, however, were certainly not the last carriers of
Mesopotamian traditions towards the West. At the time of Rome's
decline, among the Eastern cults which invaded the empire must have
been the cult of the divine stag, and his father, the divine bull (Enlil).
Early Christianity found entrenched in Rome the Babylonian custom
of celebrating New Year or winter solstice, with green wreathes, food
and drink, song and dance, exchange of gifts, and people enacting the
heavenly drama in masks of stags and bulls. The custom remained
popular all over Europe. We have a series of documents from the
fourth to the ninth centuries in which Church authorities of many
countries forbid the people to have anything to do with these pagan
practices.31
Condemned and vehemently denounced over many centuries, the
originally benevolent stag divinity became in people's minds the devil,
with horns and cloven hoofs. This is why a diabolical stag, which leads
its followers to destruction, appears in later European folklore. Such is
the Finnish stag of Hiisi.32 [Hungarian IZ]
In a former study33 I tried to explain how the Hungarians of the ninth
century could bring with them a wealth of Babylonian traditions and
the staunchly conserved hieratic language of the Magians. [Magy-ari]
It seems that they also brought along the cult of the benevolent stag
divinity. The chronicles state that the Hungarians in their westward
migration were guided by a white stag. According to the sense of the
somewhat cryptic national traditions, the great mother of the
Hungarians conceived the conquering duke in a hieros gamos with the
divine eagle -(the eagle of Ea, the eagle of Lagash?). Her name is



Emese. The corresponding Sumerian word Emes, according to Diemel,
is "priestess of Ea".34 She dreams about the future: a mighty river
issuing from her womb covers distant lands...35 Such a hieros gamos
seems to be illustrated on a gold vessel said to be of Bulgaro-Turkish
origin. We even find traces of the name Dara-mah.36 [A similar myth
is also found in the Mede myth about the coming of a new dynasty]
The divinity to whom these signs point, was, it seems, regularly
celebrated at the feast of Kar csony -the Hungarian word today for
Christmas—of unexplained etymology. It seems to conserve in its first
syllable the Sumerian GAR "turning" or "originating". [Karacsony from
the Scythian name of January or Karasanay. It also can mean Kara
acsony/aszony= Great Queen, Fred]
About 50 years ago a special ethnographic survey revealed in Hungary
179 villages which observed the tradition of "Reg"36 or "Reg"l,s"—the
pagan or semi-pagan celebration of the New Year. [in song format,
"Rig" means talk in Sumerian.] Gy. Sebesty,n collected and published
in one volume all the variants of the "Reg" ceremonies and songs; in a
second volume he wrote a study on the probable origins and the
European analogues of the custom37.
The essence of this custom is that on Christmas or New Year's night38
a group of singers go from house to house in the village, dressed in
queer costumes or animal skins, often with blackened faces. They
carry special instruments, drums, sticks with chains and other noise
makers, with which to rattle at the end of every verse they sing. They
ask for permission to enter, and if admitted, they proceed to sing their
song, which announces that God has descended upon the house,
angels bringing a table covered with food and drink amid a great
light: now is the time to feast! Most of the songs speak of a miraculous
young stag, which comes through the clouds, from heaven, and brings
the sun between its bright horns. In the song a lake appears full of



fish, in the lake a round island rises40, the miraculous stag descends
upon it and feeds on the young reeds. In some variants, the stag
speaks; he asks King Saint Stephen (the energetic uprooter of pagan
traditions) not to hunt him, for he is not a wild animal, not a devil he
is the Lord God's messenger! After this, the most important part of the
song is a series of blessings, which are all wishes for the prosperity
and fertility of the family, their crops, their animals.
In many places the singers arrange marriages; they mention together
a girl and a boy who should get married. The young people take this
seriously, it is the voice of public opinion. Every verse is followed by
rattling, dancing and various forms of the following refrain: EJ REU
REJTEM! This refrain, which has no meaning in Modern Hungarians,
has been repeatedly analyzed for half a century and many suggestions
have been offered to explain it, none of the satisfactory.41 The refrain
may perhaps be a magic formula: Ea's incantation. At the end of song,
the singers levy a toll on the house; they ask for half of the cash the
master of the house has, while from the mistress they ask a bountiful
gift of foodstuffs.42 In fact they are satisfied with a much smaller gift,
but the song may preserve the memory of ancient priestly demands.
Today the group of the "reg"s" singers is usually a gang of young boys
who keep up the old tradition for the sake of the gifts which may be
collected.43 But the name "regos" points to an order of professionals
which must once have performed the ceremony.
The "reg"s" name of the old royal entertainers is fully documented.43
May we add that, while 179 villages have conserved the old custom
under its own special name, there are many more places where
variants of the ceremony exist under different names: for example, the
"turkaj r s"45 or "sz zgulyafordit s"46.
[both names refer to bulls, cattle, the symbol of the great stag]
Sebestyen [incorrectly] brings up many analogies in the solstice feasts



of Poland, Rumania, and the Southern Slavic countries. While he
recognizes expressly that the center of the territory where the custom
still lives is Hungary, Sebestyen believes that the Hungarians inherited
it from Rome, in a complicated way, through hypothetical Avar
Slovene Szekely-Hungarians. This explanation is scarcely acceptable.
According to what we know of the Roman and the Western
ceremonies, these were but faint echoes, a masquerading carnival
with the masks of the Zodiac animals. The Hungarian ceremony was a
serious religious rite—organic fertility magic—called by its true
Mesopotamian name, which survived in Hungary only. It was a more
complete and stronger variant which arrived in Europe at a time when
the Western practice was dying. It did not come through Rome, but
straight from the East, as the last conscious ritual in honor of the
beneficent Great Stag god. Christian clerics made constant war against
the pagan tradition and called it "the feast of the devil"47—in Hungary,
as elsewhere. Thus the ancient "Lord of the Deep" (the creator of man)
gradually became the Lord of Hell.
Stags and birds remained popular subjects of art. But the Sumerian
DARAMAH name of Enki survived only in the queer devil-names48
DOROMO, DURUMO, DROMO, used all over Hungary to denote the
Prince of Darkness49.
Such was the end of the great and ancient bringer of light. In the
decorative arts, the symbols of Ea live on independently. The stags
who guard the Tree of Life reappear, but people have forgotten their
meaning. The divine face goes into hiding, behind a camouflage of
flowers. Only the keen glance discerns in Hungarian ornaments the
round eyes, the eyebrows, the horns of the horned divinity. If you ask
the Hungarian peasant woman what she embroidered on her
pillowcase, she will answer: tulips. But look and you will see the
ancient message of resurrection, the horns of the Great Stag and
between them the disc of the victorious Sun.

12. In one of the still not clear myths of creation we are told that after
a rather complicated process of impregnating a series of divine ladies,
Enki became the father of a variety of plants and trees. But being
curious, he ate those plants, which reminds one of the later Saturn
story. The goddess of birth cursed Enki for this and he almost died of
the curse, but then the great lady had pity on him and began to bear
again. That much is clear, that Father Enki, the personified Water, is
the father of plants, too. Kramer, op. cit. p. 57. [In a desert of
Messopotamia, plants are very dependant on irrigation indeed.]

17. "Four corners of the world" are often mentioned. We may have
inherited this concept in the four cardinal points of our compass,
which are arbitrary. In connection with Ea's throne, mostly square and
bearing the signs of the cross we may recall that four strokes of the
stylus made a sign which Delitzsch reads as NIG, "something,
anything, treasure, possession", connecting it with the identical
written GAR, "to be, to become" (Op. Cit. pp. 80 and 200). Fossey
gives to this sign the meanings: "four; to bring; to place". (Syllabaire
Cuneiforme, Paris, 1901, no. 509). Diemel reads it as NINDA and
interprets it as having the meanings "four" and "bread box" (N. 597).
The same sign is explained by J. Dineley Prince as having evolved
from a square, with the meaning "building". Prince believes that the
sign has two pronunciations: GAR and NGA (p. 110). The same
author explains an almost identical sign as "surround, totality, collect"
pronounced GAAR, but the name of the sign is NINDA. He explains
also the word NIGI as dwelling. The sign list of Stephen Langdon gives



a square as the early sign for "totality, universe". (p. 294). R. Jestin
translates NIG as possession, treasury, luck everything: "toute chose".
(Le verbe Sumerien, Paris, 1943, p. 395). His words for GAR:
"introniser, tetablir". We may add to these data for consideration that
in Hungarian for is NEGY, totality is MINDEN and the great feast of
Ea, the winter solstice-today Christmas-is called (GAR-A-SU-MU)
Karacsony. These data belong to the already copious literature on the
"four corners". /common in most ancient cultures/
18. Many years ago Lenormant believed that the fish-man Oannes
mentioned by Berossus or the Euahannes of Hyginus are identical
with Enki-Ea. (Freacois Lenormant: Chaldean Magic and Sorcery, p.
203). This view is still held by Charles Virolleaud (Legendes de
Babylone, Paris, 1949, p. 17). We must rather believe that the two
faced messenger and doorkeeper, the door incarnate (Iauna) is the
famous Oannes or later Janus, the divinity of entrance and beginning.
January begins the year, fight after the feast of the winter solstice
janus, the messenger of the water-god may be the prototype of the
later Joannes, who christened with water before the God-man. The
leader of the last pagan resistance in Hungary was called Janus, also.
/IA is also the Hungarian root word for river/
19.These reminded L. Heuzey of the later myth about the columns of
Hercules. Le. Sceau de Goudea, p. `33.
20.E. Douglas Van Buren: Symbols of the Gods, p. 46.
21. Talim meaning "twins or companions". Frankfort, op. cit. p. 60.
These twins may well be the heavenly Gemini, or the first Cherub
angeles. KUR in Sumerian means "guarding" /becoming Cher- ub/
(Diemel, S. A., p. 147: Bewachung).
22. Lenormant's reading of the name was HEA. On the names of Enki
Ea see Deimel: Akkadisch Sumerisches Glossar, p. 91. Among them



are: Dingir Magur "the god boat", NUDIMMUD "creator", DINGIR KAR
RA-E and MUL GULA. In Sumerian times Enki, in Accadian times Ea
was the generally used name. It may be supposed that these names
were somehow related with the Sumerian root A. meaning both water
and father, or generation. Deimel, when treating this root, mention its
resemblance to Indoeur. AHWA "water". (Sum. Akk. Gl. p. 1) A.
Falkenstein writes: " ..vielwehr kommt der Zeichen E in der alteren
Zeit der Lautwert A zu..." (Die Sprache Gudeas. Roma. 1949, p. 25).
These suggest one more addition to the innumerable attempts to
explain the holy name JAHVE. Did not a very early common culture of
many peoples possess the concept of a god-water or god father, the
Creator?
23. DARA, DAR, TAR were in Sumerian generic names of the swift
cervidae, ibex, mountain goat, deer, stag, perhaps mouflon. [a generic
name in many language families for horned animals.]
24. "The ibex or ture (Capra Caucasica)... was also perhaps AYALUM
in Babylonian, Hebrew AYAL... The Assyrian TURAKHU is translated
Steinboch by Delitzsh. It is one of the names of Ea.. and forms part of
four other names of Ea". Ward: Cylinder Seals, p. 416.

29. Ea was a divinity of the subterranean waters. Vladimir Georgiev,
the Bulgarian decipherer of Minoan inscriptions, tells us that YA was
the Minoan syllable expressed with what we call the Delta letter, and
which corresponds to Latin ianus, underground passage. (Inscriptions
Minoennes Quasi Bilingues Annuaire de l'Universite de Sofia. 1950, p.
21). The wise animal inhabiting the wet underground passages is the
snake. And we are told: the mysterious prehistoric stone buildings of
Western Europe occur invariably at spots where underground water
currents are meeting (Charles Diot: Les Sourciers et les Monuments
Megalithiques. Boug, 1935). Lenormant stated "that the serpent was
one of the principal attributes and one of the forms of Hea".
(Chaldean Magic, p. 232). The snake of Ea seems to be somehow
related to Marduk's dragon. The dragon in Hungarian folklore is often
called SARKANY-KIGYO "dragon-snake".[which by the way is also
often assosciated with rain, storms, and fertility!!]

35. Ea's name may be hidden in the archaic Hungarian word for river:



JO (pronounced YO). The idea of "good" is expressed in Hungarian by
the word JO also. A royal edict of the XI-th century forbade
Hungarians to celebrate at rivers, fountains and trees. But a belief in
the fertility magic of water survived until modern times (East). [the
Hungarian Easter custom of dunking of maidens.]

Constantinople-his name was Termatzous. (M. H. K. p. 128).
37. The Hungarian word REG corresponds to Sumerian RIG, "to
speak, recite". (Deimel, S.A., p. 191 Sprechen), also to Accadian
RAGAHU (Deimel A. S., p. 395 schreien, rufen, beanspruchen); maybe
to Sanscrit rk*, too-see Rig Veda.

separated.
40. The house of Ea, the "mountain of Ea" emerged from the waters,
too. (Falkenstein, op. cit. p. 25).
41. The first word: EJ or HEJ-an exclamation-contains perhaps the
name EA or HEA. The second means: recitation. The third word:
REJTEM may be related to Sumerian RI "to protect"-UH "magic"
Accadian RUGHTU "magic". The refrain meaning: "EAs recitation:
protective magic".
42. In some variants the foods are enumerated: a large ox to roast,
hazelnuts for stuffing and Perec cakes to hand on the horns of the ox.
The perec is around hard cake, which has a hole like a doughnut and
recalls the torques of Cernunnos. (pretzel)

46. The word means "turning the virgin cattle". A group of men go
from house to house on New Year's night and make a noise with
whips, horns and bells under the windows. This custom of several
Hungarian villages in county Zempl,n is described in Ethnographia,
Budapest, 1926, p. 89. We may read there about the custom of
Hajduszoboszlo county Hajdu: lighting fires and sounding cowbells at
New Years night.

remark, "etymology unknown". (Gombocz Melich, Budapest, 1930, p.

49. B. Homan: a Hungarian scholar of German origin, contended that
the stag of the Hungarian origin-myths was a loan from German



traditions. (A Magyar Hunhagyom ny ,s Hn -Monda. Budapest, 1932,
p. 64-65). Berze-Nagy refuses to believe Sebesty,ns good guess too,
that the Hungarian stag is connected with the Capricorn of the Zodiac
he tries to prove that the Hungarian stag was female, could not have
horns, and came from Eastern folklore and is of eschatologic
character; it originated in the IX -the century A. D. We believe we have
shown that Berze is right about the Eastern direction, but the stag is
much older than a mere 1000 years. Being miraculous, it could well
be female and have horns. We have pictures of such animals (e.g.
Scythian art).



Bobula Ida : A Nagy Szarvas
Az emberi kultúrának egyik eleme, amely kivándorolt Nyugat
Ázsiából a nyugati világba, úgy tűnik a jóindulatú, isteni atya
fogalma, aki létrehozta az emberiséget "agyagból" és aki törődik a
Föld jólétével.
A mezopotámiai istenség, akit, ellentétben a korai panteon legtöbb
más férfi istenével, jóindulatúnak tartottak, a Víz Istene, Enki volt.
Úgy tűnik, a kultusza olyan mélyen gyökerezik, hogy túlélte Babilon
bukását és sok fiatal nemzet örökítette át, akik behozták Európába,
ahol a modern időkig nyúló tradíciók a még mindig élő töredékei
ennek az ősi kultusznak.
Enkit később Ea néven ismerhetjük. /1. Ea neve négy
rovással/vonással volt írva, úgy tűnik az ő szent száma a négyszer
tíz, azaz negyven volt./ 2. Kikövetkeztethető az egyik szövegből,
hogy őt tekintették - legalábbis egy időszakban - a rangsorban a
negyediknek a Nagy Istenek között. / 3. Feltehető volt, hogy ő Enlil
és
/4. Nammu istennő fia, az "ősi tenger". (Ez helytelen, Enlil Enki
testvére - megj. a ford.)
5. Enki volt az egyik a sumér panteon első istenségei közül, akit az
archeológusok azonosítottak, több mint 50 éve, /6. mint a Vizek
Istenét, akinek a rendszeres jellemzői voltak a kilövellő, túlcsorduló
váza és két patak halakkal. Enki figurája feltűnik sok
hengerpecséten és más műemléken. /7. Ritkán állva - gyakrabban a
trónján ülve - viseli a Nagy Istenek magas, szarvazott fejfedőjét.
/8 És gyakran tart a kezében egy jogart és egy gyűrűt, mint az isteni
erő szimbólumait, amely a sumér művészetben megkülönbözteti az
isteneket a halandóktól, de amely nem egy speciális jellemzője
valamely istennek. /9. Az Ő speciális jellemzője egy szarvas állat,



általában az ibex (kőszáli kecske) vagy hegyi kecske, amellyel
gyakran ábrázolták együtt a halat. Néhány pecséten egy harmadik
állat tűnik fel Enki jelenlétében, egy madár, amely úgy tűnik, hogy
sas.
Később a hal és a kecske összevonódott egy lénnyé: a jól ismert
hal-farkú kecskefejű szimbólum, a Capricorn, Ea szimbóluma,
amelyet már régóta a Zodiákus Bak jegyeként ismernek./10.
Sok író kérdezte már: a Vizek Istenének neve miért Enki, amikor az
azt jelenti, hogy a "Földek Ura"?
Frankfort így válaszolt: Dél-Mezopotámia mocsárjaiban a föld és a
víz annyira alaposan összekeveredett, hogy lényegében ugyanannak
tűnnek./11. Nem tudunk egyetérteni: a föld és a víz ellentétben
kellett, hogy álljanak a primitív mezopotámiai gondolkodásmódban.
De a "Ki" nem csak földet jelentett, hanem magát a bolygót, a Földet
is, így feltételezhetjük, hogy Enki volt a Föld Ura.
A három állat, amit Enki körül láthatunk - a hal, a madár és a kecske
- jól szimbolizálhatja az állatvilág egészét - mindent, ami repül, úszik
vagy fut. A víz pedig alapvető szimbóluma az életnek.
A sumér teremtéstörténetek nyílt szimbolikája világossá teszi, hogy
Enki Atyát tekintették a teremtőnek és a
növények különleges apjának is, amiket sok istennő gondozott./ 12.
Végül az istennők ösztönözték Enkit, hogy teremtsen embert, amit
meg is tett - embert formált "agyagból", hogy szolgálják az
isteneket. /13.
(Ez nem egészen így volt valójában, de erről majd később - megj. a
ford.)
Így, az ember létezésért felelős lévén, Enkiről természetesen
feltételezték, hogy sokkal több érdeklődést mutat a teremtményei
iránt, mint más isten. Enki szervezte, alakította az embereket és
sorsokat rendelt nekik.
/14 Megtanította az embereket a földművelésre, állattenyésztésre. Ő



adott az emberiségnek "kenyeret".
Ő írta a civilizáció összes alapvető törvényét agyagtáblákra.
Ezeket Enki templomában tartották Eriduban. Ő volt a bölcsesség, a
gyógyítás és minden mágia istene. Veszélyben Ő volt mindig a
segítő. Megmentette az emberiséget az özönvíztől azáltal, hogy
titokban utasította Ut-Napistimet (belőle hozták létre a zsidó Noé
karaktert), hogy építsen egy bárkát, amelyben túlélhette.
Ez a történet, annyira emlékeztet a bibliai történetre, arra késztetett
néhány korai írót, hogy azt higgyék,
hogy az erősen körülrajzolt négyzet, amelyben Ea alakja néha
feltűnik, az maga a bárka./15. Később úgy vélték, ez a négyzet
szimbolizálja Ea otthonát a vizek mélységében./16.
Lehetséges, hogy a négyzet, amely körülveszi Ea-t, vagy amelyen ő
ül, a világ szimbóluma, amely a sumér
gondolkodásban négyszögletű volt./17.
A négyzet néha egyenlőszárú kereszttel van jelölve, ez egy olyan jel,
ami a 40-es számhoz kapcsolódik.
Gyakran látunk egy vagy két gigantikus kapuőrzőt is /19 Ea trónjánál
/, őket ikreknek hívták.
Enkit sok néven ismerhettük/22 egyik volt a Dara-Mah, "A Nagy
Szarvas"/23.
Enki ezen minőségéről számos magyarázatot olvashatunk./24. Ez a
név valószínűleg asztrológiai eredetű,
ami kapcsolódik az ő jóindulatú tevékenységeihez, mint a "segítője a
Napnak", az unokaöccsének, akit felszabadít naponta a hegyi
sírjából.



Úgy tűnik, a Zodiákus volt a témája a sumér
korai elméleteknek - talán pre-sumér
asztrológusoknak.
A Közel-Kelet korai művészetében mindenhol
szarvas állatokat találunk - őzet, szarvast,
kecskét - akik a szarvaik között hordják a
Napkorongot vagy a szimbólumát, ami lehet
egy négyzet, vagy egyenlőszárú kereszt
vagy épp egy nap-madár, mint a sas./25.
Amikor a Nap feltűnik a mennyei szarvas szarvai között - téli
napforduló - a tél elmúlik, a Nap visszanyeri
korábbi erejét, a nappalok egyre hosszabbak, egy új ciklus, új év
kezdődik. A korongnak vagy a madárnak a szarvak közt a Nagy
Szarvast kellet jelképeznie aki visszahozza a Napot a szarvai
között./27.
A téli sötétség megsemmisítése és a Nap visszaszerzése kellett,
hogy jelentse a lehető legnagyobb szolgálatot egy többé-kevésbé
primitív emberi társadalomnak. Nem csoda, hogy a jótevő kultusza
fennmaradt ilyen sokáig.
Az emberiség segítése hagyományos volt Ea családjában. A fia,
Dumuzi - később, mint Tammuz ismerhetjük, majd még később,
mint Adonis-t - volt a "pásztor-isten" aki meghalt, de visszatért
az életbe, épp úgy, mint a növények.
Ennek az istennek a jelzője SABA volt (pásztor-herceg), amely
emlékeztet a Csaba névre, aki a magyar
legendák hercege, a halhatatlan hős, aki mindig visszatért, hogy
segítsen az emberein. Az ő növényének nagy
ereje volt, minden sebet begyógyított, valószínű kapcsolódhat az



örökzöld Életfához is, ami Tammuz szimbóluma.
Két magyar krónika is megőrzött egy nevet, amit az ősi pogány
vallásból vettek: DAMACSEK isten nevét. Ez egyértelműen megfelel
DUMUZI névnek. Miután a magyarokat áttérítették a
kereszténységre, a legtöbb legendát, amely összegyűjtötte az
ősapák Magi vallását, kiselejtezték. Mégis, Csaba története túlélte.
Csaba figuráját átcsempészték a mitológiából a történelembe,
középkori krónikás írók, racionalizálták a
fogalmat: "a nagy uralkodó fia" és azt írták, hogy Csaba Atilla, a
hunok királyának fia volt.
Mi azokból a krónikákból úgy tudjuk, hogy az igazi hunok Csaba
köré gyűltek, aki megmentett egy kis csoportot, amikor majdnem
mindnyájukat megölték, és biztonságosan elvezette őket és
megkísérelte felkészíteni őket Pannónia visszahódítására. Árpádról,
a magyar honfoglalás történelmi figurájáról a 9. században, úgy
tartják, hogy a legendás Csaba leszármazottja.
Az is lehetséges, hogy ellentétben az apjával, Dar-Mah-val, a Nagy
Szarvassal, Sabara gondoltak úgy, mint
a Kis Szarvas vagy kecske, amely úgy hangozhatott, mint a "Dar
Ge". Ez megmagyarázhatná a későbbi istenneveket a Közel-Keleten,
mint a Tarku, Targitaos (aki a szkíták őse) és végső soron a TURK
illetve a TURAN neveket is, ez lett később a föld, amit az Északi
Égbolt borít, A Bak ege, szemben IRAN-nal, amit a déli ég borít (UR
AN), az Oroszlán ege. A kassziták egyik pecsétjén - egy kevéssé
ismert nép, de sok grafikus ötletük és szimbólumuk közös a korai
sumérokkal - gyakran láthatunk egy istenséget, aki lehet Ea, vagy
talán valószínűbb, hogy Marduk, Ea fia. Ezeken a pecséteken a
kasszita kereszt jelenik meg gyakran./28. Szintén láthatjuk a hegyi
népek művészetében, Mezopotámia szomszédságában, szarvas
állatokat, akik az Életfát védik.



A sumér gondolkodás mélyen hatott a görög gondolkodásra. Vajon
EA kultuszának lehetett-e valamilyen köze Thales ideájához, ahhoz,
hogy minden dolog első oka a víz. Nem lehet, hogy EA neve hatott
az EU szó használatára, ami azt jelenti, hogy "jó" ? Lehet, hogy EA
nak van valami köze a későbbi EU-piter fogalmához?
Távol a térben és az időben, egy kígyó kultusz vagy egy fa kultusz
jelzője EA és a családja néhány kultuszának. /29 De a
legrendíthetetlenebb túlélő úgy tűnik a szarvas-kultusz.
Sőt, a kelta istenség, Cernunnos, akit Phyllis Pray Bober ügyesen
körülírt, egyike lehet Ea (Enki) későbbi
manifesztációinak./30. Ő a vizek istene, mint Ea, szarvakat és
nyakéket visel, mint a sumér istenek,
illetve egy szarvas-kígyó kíséretében látható, amely valószínűleg Ea
szarvas halának egy variánsa.
( Ea patakjai, ha hanyagul rajzolják, könnyen összetéveszthetőek
kígyókkal).
Azonban a kelták bizonyára nem az utolsó hordozói a mezopotámiai
tradícióknak Nyugat felé...
Róma hanyatlásának idejében, a keleti kultuszok között, amik
betörtek a birodalomba, ott kellett hogy legyen az isteni szarvas
kultusza, illetve az isteni bika kultusza. A korai kereszténység
Rómában mélyen gyökerezettnek találta az Újév illetve a téli
napforduló ünneplésének babilóniai szokását, ahol zöld füzérekkel,
étellel, itallal, zenével, tánccal, ajándékokkal ünnepeltek és szarvas
illetve bika álarcokban játszották el a mennyei drámát.
A szokás egész Európában népszerű maradt. Egy sor
dokumentumunk van a negyedik századtól a kilencedik századig,



melyekben az egyházi hatóságok sok országban megtiltották az
embereknek, hogy bármi közük legyen ezekhez a pogány
gyakorlatokhoz./31.
Vehemensen elítélték az évszázadok alatt, az eredetileg jóságos
szarvas istenség ördöggé változott az emberek elméjében,
szarvakkal és hasított patákkal. Ezért tűnt fel a diabolikus szarvas
lény, aki a követőit pusztulásba viszi, később az európai folklórban.
Ilyen a finn szarvasa Hiisi-nek./32. (Magyarul IZ -> IZ-ten !!!)
Egy korábbi tanulmányban/33 próbáltam elmagyarázni, hogy a
kilencedik században a magyarok hogyan tudták magukkal hozni a
babilóniai tradíciók bőségét és a rendületlenül megőrzött hieratikus
nyelvét a Magiknak (Magians -> Magy-ari)
Úgy tűnik, hogy szintén magukkal hozták a jóságos szarvas
istenség kultuszát is. A krónikák állítják, hogy a magyarok nyugatra
vándorlását egy fehér szarvas vezette.
Valamiféle rejtélyes nemzeti tradíciók értelme szerint, a magyarok
Nagy Anyja megtermékenyül a Szent Nászban az isteni sastól (Ea
sasa). Az ő neve Emese. A megfelelő sumér szó Emes, Deimel
szerint, Emese Ea papnője./34. Álmodik a jövőről: egy hatalmas
folyóról, ami méhéből ered, és amely idegen földön terebélyesedik
ki.../35 Ilyen Szent Nász van illusztrálva egy bulgár-török eredetű
arany edényen is. Még a Dara-Mah név nyomait is megtaláljuk./36
(Hasonló mítosz szintén található a médeknél is az új dinasztia
eljöveteléről.)
Az istenséget, akire ezek a jelek mutatnak, úgy tűnik rendszeresen
ünnepelték Karácsony ünnepén.
(Valójában téli napforduló!) Etimológiája tisztázatlan. Úgy tűnik
megőrződött az első szótagjában a sumér
GAR, ami azt jelenti "forduló".(Karacsony eredeztethető még a



január hónap szkíta nevéből.)
Körülbelül 50 évvel ezelőtt egy speciális etnográfiai felmérés
felfedte Magyarország 179 falujában,
amelyek megtartották a "Reg" /37 illetve a "Regös" hagyományát.
(pogány ünnepe az Újévnek,
dal formában a "Rig" azt jelenti, "beszéd" a sumérban.) Sebestyén
Gy. összegyűjtötte és nyilvánosságra
hozta egy kötetben minden változatát a "Reg" (regös)
szertartásoknak és daloknak; egy második kötetben írt egy
tanulmányt a szokás valószínű eredetéről és az európai
analógiáiról./38. A lényege ennek a szokásnak,
hogy Karácsony illetve Újév estéjén/39 éneklő emberek csoportja
megy házról házra a faluban, furcsa jelmezekbe vagy állatbőrbe
öltözve, gyakran feketére festett arccal. Dobokat, pálcákat láncokkal
illetve más speciális hangszereket vittek magukkal, amit
megcsörgettek minden vers végén, amit énekeltek.
Engedélyt kértek, hogy beléphessenek a házakba, és ha
beengedték őket, folytatták a dalaikat, amellyel
tudtul adták, hogy Isten leszállt a házra, ételekkel és italokkal terített
asztalt hozott nagy fény közepette:
itt az idő az ünneplésre! A legtöbb dal egy csodálatos, fiatal
szarvasról szólt, aki a felhőkből érkezik és a
fényes szarvai között hordozza a Napot. Egy dalban feltűnik egy tó,
ami tele van halakkal és a tó közepén egy kerek sziget emelkedik ki
/40, a csodás szarvas leszáll rá. Néhány változatban, a szarvas
beszél; megkéri Szent István királyt (a pogány hagyományok irtóját),
hogy ne vadássza le, mert ő nem egy vadállat, nem egy
ördög, hanem az Úristen (Jóisten) hírnöke!
Ezután, a legfontosabb része a dalnak egy sor áldás, amik
kívánságok a család jólétéért, termékenységéért,



növényeikért, állataikért. Sok helyen az éneklők előkészítik a
házasságokat; egy fiút és egy lány emlegetnek
együtt, akiknek össze kellene házasodni. A fiatalok ezt komolyan
vették. Minden versszakot tánc, csörgetés és a következő refrén
változatai követték: EJ REU REJTEM! Ez a refrén, amelynek nincs
jelentése a modern magyarok számára, fél évszázadon át többször
is elemezve volt, sok feltételezést ajánlottak fel magyarázatként rá,
egyik
sem volt kielégítő./41 A refrén talán egy mágikus formula: Ea
varázsigéje. A dal végén, az énekesek úgymond díjat vetnek ki,
elkérik a ház vagyonának a felét a ház gazdájától, míg az úrnőtől
bőséges étel-ajándékokat
kérnek./42 Valójában megelégednek kisebb ajándékokkal, de a dal
megőrizte az ősi papi követeléseket.
Ma a regös csoportok általában fiatal fiúk csapata, akik fenntartják
ezt a régi hagyományt a begyűjthető
ajándékok kedvéért./43
De a regös név olyan professzionálisokra is mutat, akik egyszer már
végezték a ceremóniát.
Sebestyén Gy. (helytelenül) hoz fel számos analógiát
Lengyelország, Románia, illetve a dél-szláv országok
napforduló ünnepeiben. Miközben kifejezetten felismeri, hogy a
központja a területnek, ahol ez a szokás még mindig él,
Magyarország, Sebestyén azt hiszi, hogy a magyarok ezt Rómából
örökölték, bonyolult módon,
feltételezett Avar-Szlovén Székely-Magyarokon át. Ez a magyarázat
aligha elfogadható. az alapján, amit
tudunk a római és a nyugati szertartásokról, ezek csak halvány
visszhangok voltak, maskarádés karneválok
a Zodiákus állatainak maszkjaiban. A magyar szertartás komoly
vallási rítus volt - organikus termékenységi



mágia - és az igazi mezopotámiai nevén nevezték, amely csak
Magyarországon maradt meg. Ez jóval teljesebb és erősebb változat
volt, amely megérkezett Európába abban az időben, amikor a
nyugati praktikák haldokoltak.
Nem Rómán keresztül jött, hanem egyenesen Keletről, mint a
legutolsó tudatos rituálé a jóságos Nagy Szarvas tiszteletére.
Keresztény papok folyamatos háborút indítottak a pogány
hagyományok ellen és az "ördög fesztiváljának" nevezték
Magyarországon és máshol is./47 Az ősi igaz teremtője az
emberiségnek fokozatosan átváltozott a "pokol urává" az emberek
elméjében.
Szarvasok és madarak népszerű témái maradtak a művészetnek. De
a sumér DARAMAH, Enki neve csak a furcsa ördög-nevekben élt
tovább/48 DOROMO, DUROMO, DROMO, mindenütt elkezdték
használni Magyarországon is a "Sötétség Hercegének" jelölésére.
Ilyen vége lett a nagyszerű és ősi Fényhozónak. A dekoratív
művészetekben azonban Ea szimbólumai örökké élnek. A szarvasok,
akik őrzik az Életfát újra feltűnnek, de az emberek elfelejtették a
jelentésüket.
Az isteni arc elrejtőzik, a virágok álcája mögött. Csak az éles szemek
veszik észre a magyar ornamentumokban a kerek szemeit, a
szemöldökét, és a szarvait a szarvas istennek. Ha megkérdezel egy
magyar parasztasszonyt mit hímzett a párnahuzatára, azt fogja
válaszolni: tulipánokat. De nézd meg jól és látni fogod a feltámadás
ősi üzenetét, a Nagy Szarvas szarvait és köztük a győztes Nap
korongját.
1. F.Lenormant szerint Ea neve "lakóházat" jelent. De a sumér
elmében az "építeni" a teremtéshez kapcsolódott, azt jelentette
"generálni", "létrehozni".



F.Delitzsh Sumerisches Glossar-jában Ea neve szintén jelent "folyót"
a sumérban, mint a finnugor YU,YO és folyó -> FŐ-LYO -> fő folyó
illetve FŐ JÓ, a legfőbb jó, a "JÓisten".

17. "A világ négy sarka" gyakran van említve. Örökölhettük ezt a
koncepciót az iránytű négy égtájaiban,
amely önkényes. Kapcsolatban van Ea trónjával, sokszor egy
négyzet veszi körül és az egyenlőszárú kereszt
jelét viseli, emlékezhetünk a négy vonásra, amit Delitzsch úgy
olvasott, hogy NIG, ami annyit tesz, hogy
"kincs", "birtok", ezt összekapcsolva az azonos írású GAR szóval ami
azt jelenti "lenni" "vmivé válni" . Fossey a következő jelentéseket
adja ennek a jelnek: "négy; hozni; helyezni". Diemel úgy olvassa,
mint NINDA és úgy interpretálja, mint ami azt jelenti "négy" illetve
"kenyér doboz". Ugyanezt a jelet magyarázza J.Dineley Prince,
szerinte egy négyszögből, négyzetből evolválódott, és azt jelenti
"épület". Prince úgy hiszi, hogy a jelnek két kiejtése van: GAR és
NGA. Elmagyarázza, hogy egy majdnem azonos jel pedig azt jelenti:
"körbevesz; teljesség" és GAAR-nak kell ejteni, de a jel neve NINDA.
A NIG szót "lakhelynek" fordítja. R.Jestin pedig így fordítja a NIG-et :
"birtoklás" "szerencse mindenben". (LeVerbe Sumerien, Paris,
1943.). Az ő szavai a GAR szóra: "bevezetés" , "beiktatás". Hozzá
kell tennünk ezekhez az adatokhoz a NÉGY és a MINDEN magyar
szavainkat, valamint a nevét Ea nagy ünnepének, amely téli
napforduló, (ma Karácsony) és amely a GAR-A-SU-MU sumer
szóból ered. Ez az adat a már bőséges szakirodalomhoz tartozik az
ún "négy sarokról".
18. Sok évvel ezelőtt Lenormant úgy hitte, hogy a "hal-ember"



Oannes azonos Enkivel.
(Lenormant: Chaldean Magic and Sorcery) Charles Virolleaud
szintén így véli. (Legends de Babylone, Paris 1949.)
Nekünk inkább azt kell hinnünk, hogy a két-arcú hírvivő és kapuőrző
a híres Oannes vagyis inkább Janus a
kezdetek istene. Január hónap kezdi az évet, a téli napforduló
ünnepe után, Janus a hírvivője a Vizek istenének lehetett a
prototípusa a későbbi Joannes-nek, aki vízzel keresztelt az Isten
ember előtt. Magyarországon a legutolsó pogány ellenállásnak a
vezetőjét is Janus-nak hívták. (IA szintén egy magyar gyökérszó a
folyó szavunkra)

21. Talim jelentheti az ikreket vagy társakat. Frankfort, op. cit. p. 60.
Ezek az "ikrek" lehettek a
mennyei Ikrek. KUR szó a sumerban "őrző"-t jelent. /KUR - Ker Ub/
(Diemel, S. A., p. 147: Bewachung).
22. Lenormant HEA-nak olvasta a nevet. Enki-Ea neveiért nézzük
meg Deimel: Akkád Sumér glosszárjait.
Köztük van: Dingir Magur az "isteni kecske", NUDIMMUD azaz
"teremtő", DINGIR KAR-RA-E és MUL GULA. A sumér időkben Enki,
az akkád időkben pedig Ea volt az általában használt neve. Az
összes korai kultúra birtokolta valamilyen formában a Vizek Istene
illetve az Istenatya, Teremtő koncepciókat.
23. DARA, DAR, TAR szógyökerek benn voltak a szarvasfélék,



kőszáli kecske, hegyi kecske, őz, szarvas, muflon sumér neveiben
mind. Valójában általános kifejezés sok nyelvben a szarvas állatokra.
24. Az ibex, azaz kőszáli kecske másik neve talán AYALUM a
babiloniban, még a héberben is megőrződött mint AYAL...Az asszír
TURAKHU -t pedig Steinboch"-nak fordította Delitzsch. Ez az egyik
neve Ea-nak.
25. Egy korai termékenység isten, akit imádtak, különböző jelzőkkel

27. Több anyag illusztrálja a kapcsolatot művészet és asztrológia
közt, ezt mutatja be Prof. Willy Hartner
egy tanulmányában: Early Traces of the Zodiac in the Near East.

29. Ea volt a mély, földalatti vizek istene. Vladimir Gergiev, a bulgár
megfejtője a Mínoszi feliratoknak,
elmondja nekünk, hogy a "YA" volt a mínoszi szótag, amivel
kifejezték azt, amit mi Delta betűnek neveznénk, és ami megfelel a
latin IANUS-nak. (Inscriptions Minoennes Quasi Bilingues Annuaire
de l'Universite de Sofia. 1950, p. 21). A bölcs állat, ami a nedves
földalatti járatokban él, a kígyó. És ahogy már elmondták nekünk:
Nyugat-Európa rejtélyes prehisztorikus kőépítményei változatlanul
mindig azokon a helyeke találhatóak, ahol földalatti vízáramok



találkoznak. (Charles Diot: Les Sourciers et les Monuments
Megalithiques. Boug, 1935).
Lenormant állította, hogy a kígyó volt az egyik legfontosabb
princípiuma illetve egyik formája HEA-nak.
(Chaldean Magic, p. 232). Ea kígyója úgy tűnik valahogy kötődik
Marduk sárkányához. A sárkány a magyar folklórban gyakran
SARKANY-KÍGYÓ, "dragon-snake", amit szintén gyakran társítottak
az esővel, viharral és a termékenységgel is. (Valójában a kundalíni
energiát jelenti - a ford.)

35. Ea neve el van rejtve az archaikus magyar "folyó" szavunkban:
LYO - JO.
A 11. században megtiltották a magyaroknak, hogy ünnepeljenek
folyóknál, patakoknál és fáknál.
De a hit a víz termékenységi mágiájában megmaradt a modern
időkig. Lásd: Húsvéti locsolkodás.
36. Konstantinos Porphyrogenetos, bizánci uralkodó és író,
elbeszéli, hogy a 10.században egy fiatal magyar
herceg meglátogatta Konstantinápolyt, Termatzous-nak hívták.
37. A magyar REG szó megfelel a sumér RIG szónak, ami azt jelenti,
hogy "beszélni, elmondani". (Deimel, S.A. p.191. Sprechen), szintén



megfelel az akkád RAGAHU szónak, (valamint lásd: szanszkrit RIg
Veda).

39.A középkori évszázadokban az év december 25-én kezdődött,
csak a 15.század végén lett a karácsony
és az Újév külön választva.
Ea háza, Ea "hegye" is a vizekből emelkedett ki. (Falkenstein, op.p.
25.)
Az első szó: EJ vagy HEJ, ami egy felkiáltás, valójában EA vagy HEA
nevét tartalmazza. A második szó
REGÖ vagy REU azt jelenti: elmondani. A harmadik szó REJTEM,
pedig a sumér RI szóhoz tartozik, ami azt jelenti, "védeni" - az UH
pedig "mágia" - akkádul RUGHTU. A refrén jelentése: "Ea szavalata:
védelmező mágia."

Etnográfiai publikációkban sokféle variációját
találhatjuk meg van ennek a szokásnak.
