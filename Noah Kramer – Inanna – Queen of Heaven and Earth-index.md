INANNA'S FAMILY TREE
The stories in this cycle express an amalgamation of Sumerian and Akkadian
religious and political beliefs that go back at least a thousand years before
Sumer was a unified political entity. During the third millennium B.C., there
were periodic attempts to unify the various city-states in Sumer and Akkad; and
with the increasing political centralization came a concurrent movement to
bring together the many local gods and goddesses into one pantheon.
In the Cycle of Inanna, we encounter aspects of the earlier Sumerian Dumuzi as well as the later more politicized Akkadian Dumuzi. The Sumerian
Dumuzi, who comes from the agricultural, more traditional area of southern
Sumer, Eridu, which emphasized order (the me), is characterized as the force
in the grain and as the priestly lover and attendant of the Fertility Goddess, Inanna. The Akkadian Dumuzi, coming from the northern nomadic peoples
who emphasized the arbitrary will and power of the gods, is characterized as
the shepherd, the astral heavenly bull, and the king who has "godlike" powers.
Inanna, too, by her epithet Queen of Heaven and Earth, subsumed the many
local cults to the goddess and combined the earlier, more peaceful Fertility
Goddess with the attributes of the more directing and directive Goddess of
Love. Although in other legends and stories the Sumerian divinities and heroes
may have different relationships to each other, for the purpose of clarification
the family tree on the following page indicates the relationships of the divini
ties to each other within the context of these stories.

PREFACE
by Samuel Noah Kramer
This book is a graphic example of an effective cooperation between two
specialists working in contrasting, yet complementary, areas of humanistic
research: a folklorist who has collected and recorded the tales, legends, and
songs of modern contemporary societies, and a cuneiformist who has devoted
his entire scholarly career to the restoration and translation of the written tales,
legends, and songs of the ancient Sumerians.
The Sumerian tales, legends, and songs are part of a vast literature in
scribed on clay tablets and fragments scattered throughout museums the
world over. Their contents, which date back to 2000 B.C., are now in the
process of being deciphered, translated, and interpreted by a small interna
tional group of dedicated scholars; gradually, they are becoming available in
one form or another to the world at large. Inscribed on these tablets and
fragments, numbering some five to six thousand in all, are hundreds of com
positions—myths, epic tales, hymns, psalms, love songs, laments, essays, dis
putations, proverbs, fables—that constitute a treasure house of comparative
source material for the historian of literature and religion, for the biblical
and classical scholar, and (as this book demonstrates) for the folklorist and
cultural anthropologist.
The main goal of the selection presented here is to provide the reader
with an authentic portrait of Sumer's most beloved and revered deity, the
goddess Inanna. To compile this collection, I first combed the extant Sumerian
literary documents, which I had deciphered and translated over the decades,
for the relevant compositions on Inanna. Then, with the help of the most
recent contributions by fellow Sumerologists, I brought the translations up to
date. Finally, I turned the stories over to Diane Wolkstein, who proceeded to
arrange, combine, and mold their raw contents in a way that would make them
alive and meaningful to modern readers.
As a gifted storyteller and professional folklorist, Diane Wolkstein per
formed her delicate task with originality, ingenuity, and sensitivity. She elimi
nated cluttering repetitions, added explanatory words and lines when advisa
xiii



ble, restored a broken passage when possible, and skillfully wove the texts of
numerous related poems into a unifying whole. Diane Wolkstein has suc
ceeded in re-creating a significant group of rather esoteric tales and songs, long
erased from the memory of man, in a form that is at once imaginative and
evocative, attractive and engaging.

INTRODUCTION
by Diane Wolkstein
Inanna was a birthday gift—and more. In the spring of 1979 I had been asked
by Priscilla Moulton to present a program at Simmons College in Boston the
following November. As the date fell on the week of my birthday and the
program was open to my choosing, I decided that this must be the occasion
I had been waiting for.
I had for years wanted to tell the story of the Moon Goddess, Diana. Not
only am I her namesake, but in her cyclical aspect, the Moon Goddess is an
identifying symbol for women. And all of us, both women and men, have long
needed a "grand" story of a woman—as inspiration, guide, and model—for
ourselves as well as for our children.
To my surprise, four months of research on the moon goddesses of the world turned up only scattered bits. The most complete tale of the goddess
is that of Demeter; but the story revolves around the mother-daughter aspect
of the goddess, and I wanted to tell a story of the goddess in all her aspects.
Where was she to be found?
To look at the statues of the goddess in museums and to read of her impact
in books of mythology and religion was only a beginning. As a storyteller, in
order to truly know her, I had to hear her speak. I had to find the goddess
in relationship with others. In order to know her, I had to find her text.
I went through the world's anthologies in search of the names of moon
goddesses: Ishtar, Mari, Diana, Isis, Hecate, Pasiphae, Selene, Brigit, Cybele,
the Shekinah, Lilith, Persephone, Inanna ... I sought her by name, and at last I found mention of her and her stories in Samuel Noah Kramer's most recent
book, From the Poetry of Sumer. In this book, Kramer describes the goddess of
the first civilization from which we have texts: "Female deities were wor
shipped and adored all through Sumerian history. . . . but the goddess who
outweighed, overshadowed, and outlasted them all was a deity known to the Sumerians by the name of Inanna, 'Queen of Heaven,' and to the Semites who
lived in Sumer by the name of Ishtar. Inanna played a greater role in myth,
epic, and hymn than any other deity, male or female." 1
Samuel Noah Kramer, From the Poetry of Sumer, Berkeley: University of Berkeley Press, 1979, p. 71.

In Kramer's The Sacred Marriage Rite, 2 I found the various love poems of
the young earthy Inanna and the story of the mature Inanna's descent into the
underworld. I read Inanna's descent again and again. I was drawn to the story
of the woman who gave up, at seven successive gates, all she had accomplished
in life until she was stripped naked, with nothing remaining but her will to be
reborn. Although fragmented, the story of Inanna as I began to perceive it fol
lowed the same pattern as the archetypal Moon Goddess: the young woman who is courted; the ripe woman who enjoys her feminine powers and gener
ously offers her bounty; and the mature woman who meets death in the
underworld. In The White Goddess, Robert Graves conjectures on the heavenly
aspect of the Triple Goddess, "As the Sky Goddess, she was the moon ... as
the New Moon or Spring she was girl; as the Full Moon or Summer she was woman; as the Old Moon or Winter she was hag. . .
." 3
In Sumerian, Inanna's name means literally "Queen of Heaven," and she
was called both the First Daughter of the Moon and the Morning and Evening
Star (the planet Venus). In addition, in Sumerian mythology, she was known
as the Queen of Heaven and Earth and was responsible for the growth of plants
and animals and fertility in humankind. Then, because of her journey to the
underworld, she took on the powers and mysteries of death and rebirth,
emerging not only as a sky or moon goddess, but as the goddess who rules
over the sky, the earth, and the underworld. Here was the goddess in all her
aspects; here was my story.
But as I prepared the story for presentation, piecing together the different
sections, there were many gaps and question marks in the text, often at the most crucial moments, and I wondered what many of the words meant
literally. My friend Susan Bergholz, long a Sumerianophile, suggested I
telephone the source: Samuel Noah Kramer, who had deciphered the
text.
"So you love Inanna?" Kramer said, answering the telephone himself. "Well, then come and see me." He was giving a Jayne Lecture on Inanna in
two days' time at the Philosophical Society in Philadelphia and why didn't I come then?
I arrived eager and full of questions:
"In the first line of The Descent of Inanna,' 'From the Great Above she
set her mind to the Great Below,' what exactly does 'mind' mean?" "Ear," Kramer said. "Ear?"
'Samuel Noah Kramer, The Sacred Marriage Rite, Bloomington, Indiana: University of In
diana Press, 1969.
'Robert Graves, The White Goddess, New York: Farrar, Straus, and Giroux, p. 386.

"Yes, the word for ear and wisdom in Sumerian are the same. But mind is what is meant."
"But—I could say 'ear'?"
"Well, you could."
"Is it opened her ear or set her ear?"
"Set. Set her ear, like a donkey that sets its ear at a particular sound."
As Kramer spoke, a shiver ran through me. When taken literally, the text
itself announces the story's direction: From the Great Above the goddess
opened (set) her ear, her receptor for wisdom, to the Great Below.
While these thoughts were darting about in my mind, Kramer looked at
the shaping I had done of his texts and said that he thought if I could find
a publisher there might be a possibility for our collaborating on a joint publi
cation. I had read the story of "Inanna and the Huluppu-Tree," and asked
Kramer if there were other stories about Inanna that were intact. He men
tioned "Inanna and Enki: The Transfer of the Arts of Civilization from Eridu
to Erech," but said it had not yet been completely translated into English.
In November of 1979 I told "The Courtship" and "The Descent of
Inanna" at Simmons College to an astonished and awestruck audience. When I told Kramer about it, he insisted that the people were responding to me, but
I assured him it was the Inanna who had captivated him for fifty years who was
now captivating them as well. By February, 1980, we had an eager and
supportive publisher. In March, Kramer sent me a translation of "The Me.
Then, a month later when Kramer showed me Reisman's scholarly translations
of the hymns, I suddenly understood that with the rebirth of the goddess into
the sky, the texts formed one story: the life story of the goddess, from her
adolescence to her completed womanhood and "godship."
In beginning the work of trying to find the appropriate written form for the
stories of Inanna, I tried prose, the form I knew best from storytelling. But
I found myself continually returning to verse. After six months of experiment
ing with different forms for "The Huluppu-Tree" it seemed there was some
invisible, irreducible essence buried in each Sumerian line. Only by keeping
the actual Sumerian verse line could I hope to express the mystery and power
that lay within it.
For over two years I worked on the texts Kramer gave me. On my visits to Kramer, I asked him: What did this word mean? This sentence? Could he
express it in different English words? What did it mean literally in Sumerian? Sometimes he could answer my questions. Other times he'd throw up his
hands and say: "No matter how many times you ask me the same question,
I still don't know."

With Kramer's consent, I turned to the writing „fn, , ,
alternative ideas and words. I consulted the ZZo^K ^ fo<
for further poss.bihties on p U22ling secuons. I

expert and encouraging guidance both in finding and in selecting the appropr
ate works of art. Together we spent many wonderful hours discussing Z
choosing the cylinder seals and terracotta sculptures that seemed best to express
the stones' moods and meanings.
After the first nine months of reading everything I could find on Sumerian
literature, culture, and history, speaking with Kramer, and working and re
working each line, I decided I had to bring the story once again to an audience. I
arranged to tell the Cycle of Inanna at Robert Bly's Mother Goddess Confer
ence in Maine in June, 1980. But the thought of telling the stories to other
people propelled me to rework the text again. In fact, each time I have told
Inanna I have reworked the text as I realized that expressions such as "days of
yore" or "I, the Maid" would immediately deaden the receptivity of the audience.
Further changes came to the manuscript from the telling. Audiences had
difficulty keeping more than one foreign name in their minds and at the same
time following the flow of the story. For this reason I decided to use English
epithets to accompany the names of the characters as they appear. I also tried
to minimize the use of Sumerian place names and epithets. Still, I kept such
Sumerian words as kur, me, sukkal, and abzu, for they are metaphysical con
cepts that seem to me intrinsic to Sumerian thought; and in time, I hope, they
may come to enrich our English thought and language.
My aim has been to keep as close as possible to the power, wonder, and
mystery embedded in the Sumerian texts, and simultaneously to render the
stories both accessible and compelling. For the latter reason, I have eliminated
much of the repetition. For the former reason, I have retained as much of the
repetition and Sumerian grammatical structure as the flow of the story would
allow (for example, the three-part progressing parallelism, as in he—father
Enki). Whenever there is a break in the text, I use ellipses. When a certain
section seems to demand clarification, often because there is a break at a cruci^
point, parentheses have been used to indicate that these are my own w

of Wisdom," she achieves her queenship. In "The Courtship of Inanna and
Dumuzi," she chooses the shepherd Dumuzi to be her lover, her husband, and
the King of Sumer. In "The Descent of Inanna," Inanna leaves for the underworld and is allowed to return from the Great Below only on the condition
that she choose a substitute. In the last section of the cycle, the "Seven Hymns
to Inanna," Inanna is greeted and loved in her many aspects.
The world's first love story, two thousand years older than the Bible
tender, erotic, shocking, and compassionate—is more than momentary enter
tainment. It is a sacred story that has the intention of bringing its audience to
a new spiritual place. With Inanna, we enter the place of exploration: the place
where not all energies have been tamed or ordered. Inanna's scribe, Samuel Noah Kramer, gave me her words. I have sung
them as best as I can. Now, we pass them on to you.

INANNA'S
STORIES AND HYMNS






THE HULUPPU- TREE



In the first days, in the very first days,
In the first nights, in the very first nights,
In the first years, in the very first years,
In the first days when everything needed was brought into being,
In the first days when everything needed was properly nourished,
When bread was baked in the shrines of the land,
And bread was tasted in the homes of the land,
When heaven had moved away from earth,
And earth had separated from heaven,
And the name of man was fixed;
When the Sky God, An, had carried off the heavens,
And the Air God, Enlil, had carried off the earth,
When the Queen of the Great Below, Ereshkigal, was given
the underworld for her domain,
He set sail; the Father set sail,
Enki, the God of Wisdom, set sail for the underworld.
Small windstones were tossed up against him;
Large hailstones were hurled up against him;
Like onmshing turtles,
They charged the keel of Enki's boat.
The waters of the sea devoured the bow of his boat like wolves;
The waters of the sea struck the stern of his boat like lions.
4



At that time, a tree, a single tree, a buluppu- tree
Was planted by the banks of the Euphrates.
The tree was nurtured by the waters of the Euphrates.
The whirling South Wind arose, pulling at its roots
And ripping at its branches
Until the waters of the Euphrates carried it away.
A woman who walked in fear of the word of the Sky God, An,
Who walked in fear of the word of the Air God, Enlil,
Plucked the tree from the river and spoke:
"I shall bring this tree to Uruk.
I shall plant this tree in my holy garden."
Inanna cared for the tree with her hand.
She settled the earth around the tree with her foot.
She wondered:
4 How long will it be until I have a shining throne to sit upon?
How long will it be until I have a shining bed to lie upon?"
The years passed; five years, then ten years.
The tree grew thick,
But its bark did not split.
5



Then a serpent who could not be charmed
Made its nest in the roots of the huluppu-tree.
The Anzu-bird set his young in the branches of the tree.
And the dark maid Lilith built her home in the trunk.
The young woman who loved to laugh wept.
How Inanna wept!
(Yet they would not leave her tree.)
As the birds began to sing at the coming of the dawn,
The Sun God, Utu, left his royal bedchamber.
Inanna called to her brother Utu, saying:
"O Utu, in the days when the fates were decreed,
When abundance overflowed in the land,
When the Sky God took the heavens and the Air God the earth,
When Ereshkigal was given the Great Below for her domain,
The God of Wisdom, Father Enki, set sail for the underworld,
And the underworld rose up and attacked him. . •
6



At that time, a tree, a single tree, a huluppu- tree
Was planted by the banks of the Euphrates.
The South Wind pulled at its roots and ripped at its branches
Until the waters of the Euphrates carried it away.
I plucked the tree from the river;
I brought it to my holy garden.
I tended the tree, waiting for my shining throne and bed.
Then a serpent who could not be charmed
Made its nest in the roots of the tree,
The Anzu-bird set his young in the branches of the tree,
And the dark maid Lilith built her home in the trunk.
I wept.
How I wept!
(Yet they would not leave my tree.)"
Utu, the valiant warrior, Utu,
Would not help his sister, Inanna.
As the birds began to sing at the coming of the second dawn,
Inanna called to her brother Gilgamesh, saying:
"O Gilgamesh, in the days when the fates were decreed,
When abundance overflowed in Sumer,
When the Sky God had taken the heavens and the Air God
the earth,
7



When Ereshkigal was given the Great Below for her domain,
The God of Wisdom, Father Enki, set sail for the underworld,
And the underworld rose up and attacked him.
At that time, a tree, a single tree, a buluppu- tree
Was planted by the banks of the Euphrates.
The South Wind pulled at its roots and ripped at its branches
Until the waters of the Euphrates carried it away.
I plucked the tree from the river;
I brought it to my holy garden.
I tended the tree, waiting for my shining throne and bed.
Then a serpent who could not be charmed
Made its nest in the roots of the tree,
The Anzu-bird set his young in the branches of the tree,
And the dark maid Lilith built her home in the trunk.
I wept.
How I wept!
(Yet they would not leave my tree.)"
Gilgamesh the valiant warrior, Gilgamesh,
The hero of Uruk, stood by Inanna.
8



Gilgamesh fastened his armor of fifty minas around his chest.
The fifty minas weighed as little to him as fifty feathers.
He lifted his bronze ax, the ax of the road,
Weighing seven talents and seven minas, to his shoulder.
He entered Inanna's holy garden.
Gilgamesh struck the serpent who could not be charmed.
The Anzu-bird flew with his young to the mountains;
And Lilith smashed her home and fled to the wild, uninhabited places.
Gilgamesh then loosened the roots of the huluppu- tree;
And the sons of the city, who accompanied him, cut off the branches.
From the trunk of the tree he carved a throne for his holy sister.
From the trunk of the tree Gilgamesh carved a bed for Inanna.
From the roots of the tree she fashioned a pukku for her brother.
From the crown of the tree Inanna fashioned a mikku for Gilgamesh,
the hero of Uruk.

INANNA AND THE GOD OF WISDOM



Inanna placed the shugurra, the crown of the steppe, on her head.
She went to the sheepfold, to the shepherd.
She leaned back against the apple tree.
When she leaned against the apple tree, her vulva was wondrous to
behold.
Rejoicing at her wondrous vulva, the young woman Inanna applauded
herself.
She said:
"I, the Queen of Heaven, shall visit the God of Wisdom.
I shall go to the Abzu, the sacred place in Eridu.
I shall honor Enki, the God of Wisdom, in Eridu.
I shall utter a prayer to Enki at the deep sweet waters."
Inanna set out by herself.
When she was within a short distance of the Abzu,
He whose ears are wide open,
He who knows the me, the holy laws of heaven and earth,
He who knows the heart of the gods,
Enki, the God of Wisdom, who knows all things,
Called to his servant, Isimud:
"Come, my sukkal,
The young woman is about to enter the Abzu.
12



When Inanna enters the holy shrine
Give her butter cake to eat.
Pour cold water to refresh her heart.
Offer her beer before the statue of the lion.
Treat her like an equal.
Greet Inanna at the holy table, the table of heaven."
Isimud heeded Enki's words.
When Inanna entered the Abzu,
He gave her butter cake to eat.
He poured cold water for her to drink.
He offered her beer before the statue of the lion.
He treated her respectfully.
He greeted Inanna at the holy table, the table of heaven.
13



Enki and Inanna drank beer together.
They drank more beer together.
They drank more and more beer together.
With their bronze vessels filled to overflowing,
With the vessels of Urash, Mother of the Earth,
They toasted each other; they challenged each other.
Enki, swaying with drink, toasted Inanna:
"In the name of my power! In the name of my holy shrine!
To my daughter Inanna I shall give
The high priesthood! Godship!
The noble, enduring crown! The throne of kingship!"
Inanna replied:
"I take them!"
To my daughter Inanna I shall give
14



Truth!
Descent into the underworld! Ascent from the underworld!
The art of lovemaking! The kissing of the phallus!"
Inanna replied:
"I take them!"
Enki raised his cup and toasted Inanna a third time:
"In the name of my power! In the name of my holy shrine!
To my daughter Inanna I shall give
The holy priestess of heaven!
The setting up of lamentations! The rejoicing of the heart!
The giving of judgments! The making of decisions!"
Inanna replied:
"I take them!"
(Fourteen times Enki raised his cup to Inanna.
Fourteen times he offered his daughter five me, six me, seven me.
Fourteen times Inanna accepted the holy me. )
15



Then Inanna, standing before her father,
Acknowledged the me Enki had given to her:
"My father has given me the me:
He gave me the high priesthood.
He gave me godship.
He gave me the noble, enduring crown.
He gave me the throne of kingship.
He gave me the noble sceptre.
He gave me the staff.

He gave me the making of decisions."
18



(Still reeling with drink) Enki spoke to his servant Isimud:
14 My sukkal, Isimud
The young woman—is about to leave—for Uruk.
It is my wish that she reach her city—safely."
Inanna gathered all the me.
The me were placed on the Boat of Heaven.
The Boat of Heaven, with the holy me, was pushed off from the quay.
When the beer had gone out from the one who had drunk beer,
When the beer had gone out from Father Enki,
When the beer had gone out from the great God of Wisdom,
Enki looked about the Abzu.
The eyes of the King of the Abzu searched Eridu.
King Enki looked about Eridu and called to his servant Isimud, saying:
"My sukkal, Isimud
"My king, Enki, I stand to serve you."
"The high priesthood? Godship?
The noble enduring crown?
Where are they?"
"My king has given them to his daughter."
"The art of the hero? The art of power?
Treachery? Deceit?
Where are they?"
19



"My king has given them to his daughter."
"The perceptive ear? The power of attention?
The making of decisions?
Where are they?"
"My king has given them to his daughter."
(Fourteen times Enki questioned his servant Isimud;
Fourteen times Isimud answered, saying:
"My king has given them to his daughter.
My king has given all the me to his daughter Inanna.")
Then Enki spoke, saying:
"Isimud, the Boat of Heaven, with the holy me
Where is it now?"
"The Boat of Heaven is (one quay away from Eridu)."
"Go! Take the enkum- creatures
Let them bring the Boat of Heaven back to Eridu!"
Isimud spoke to Inanna:
"My queen, your father has sent me to you.
Your father's words are words of state.
They may not be disobeyed."
Inanna answered:
"What has my father said?
What has Enki added?
What are his words of state that may not be disobeyed?
20



Isimud spoke:
"My king has said:
'Let Inanna proceed to Uruk;
Bring the Boat of Heaven with the holy me back to Eridu.'
Inanna cried:
"My father has changed his word to me!
He has violated his pledge—broken his promise!
Deceitfully my father spoke to me!
Deceitfully he cried:
'In the name of my power! In the name of my holy shrine!'
Deceitfully he sent you to me!"
Scarcely had Inanna spoken these words
When the wild-haired enkum- creatures seized the Boat of Heaven.
Inanna called to her servant Ninshubur, saying:
"Come, Ninshubur, once you were Queen of the East;
Now you are the faithful servant of the holy shrine of Uruk.
Water has not touched your hand,
Water has not touched your foot.
My sukkal who gives me wise advice,
My warrior who fights by my side,
Save the Boat of Heaven with the holy me!"
21



(Ninshubur sliced the air with her hand.
She uttered an earth-shattering cry.)
The enkum- creatures were sent hurtling back to Eridu.
Then Enki called to his servant Isimud a second time, saying:
"My sukkal, Isimud
"My king, Enki, I stand to serve you."
"Where is the Boat of Heaven now?"
"It is (two quays away from Eridu)."
"Go! Take the fifty uru- giants,
Let them carry off the Boat of Heaven."
The fifty flying uru -giants seized the Boat of Heaven.
But Ninshubur rescued the boat for Inanna.
Enki called to his servant Isimud a third time, saying:
"My sukkal, Isimud
"My king, Enki, I stand to serve you."
"Where is the Boat of Heaven now?"
22



"It has just arrived at Dulma."
"Quickly! Take the fifty lahama- monsters,
Let them carry off the Boat of Heaven."
The fifty lahama- sea. monsters seized the Boat of Heaven.
But Ninshubur rescued the boat for Inanna.
A fourth time Enki sent the sound-piercing kugalgal.
A fifth time Enki sent the enumiti.
But each time Ninshubur rescued the boat for Inanna.
Enki called to his servant Isimud a sixth time, saying:
"My sukkal. Isimud
"My king, Enki, I stand to serve you."
"Where is the Boat of Heaven now?"
"It is about to enter Uruk."
"Quickly! Take the watchmen of the Iturungal Canal,
Let them carry off the Boat of Heaven."
23



Isimud and the watchmen of the Iturungal Canal seized
the Boat of Heaven,
But Ninshubur rescued the boat for Inanna.
Then Ninshubur spoke to Inanna:
"My queen, when the Boat of Heaven
Enters the Nigulla Gate of Uruk,
Let high water flow in our city;
Let the deep-going boats sail swiftly through our canals."
Inanna answered Ninshubur:
"On the day the Boat of Heaven
Enters the Nigulla Gate of Uruk,
Let high water sweep over the streets;
Let high water flow over the paths.
Let the old men give counsel;
Let the old women offer heart-soothing.
Let the young men show the might of their weapons;
Let the little children laugh and sing.
Let all of Uruk be festive!
Let the high priest greet the Boat of Heaven with song.
Let him utter great prayers.
Let the king slaughter oxen and sheep.
Let him pour beer out of the cup.
Let the drum and tambourine resound.
Let the sweet tigi- music be played.
Let all the lands proclaim my noble name.
Let my people sing my praises."
24



And so it was,
On the day the Boat of Heaven entered the Nigulla Gate of Uruk,
High water swept over the streets;
High water flowed over the paths.
The Boat of Heaven docked at the holy shrine of Uruk;
The Boat of Heaven docked at the holy house of Inanna.
Then Enki called to his servant Isimud a seventh time, saying:
"My sukkal, Isimud
"My king, Enki, I stand to serve you."
"Where is the Boat of Heaven now?"
"The Boat of Heaven is at the White Quay."
"Go! She has aroused wonder there.
The queen has aroused wonder at the White Quay.
Inanna has aroused wonder at the White Quay for
the Boat of Heaven."
25



The holy me were being unloaded.
As the me which Inanna had received from Enki were unloaded,
They were announced and presented to the people of Sumer.
Then more me appeared—more me than Enki had given Inanna.
And these, too, were announced,
And these, too, were presented to the people of Uruk:
"Inanna brought the me:
She brought the placing of the garment on the ground.
She brought allure.
She brought the art of women.
She brought the perfect execution of the me.
She brought the tigi- and lilts- drums.
She brought the ub-, the meze-, and the ^-tambourines.
Inanna spoke, saying:
"Where the Boat of Heaven has docked,
That place shall be called The White Quay.
Where the holy me have been presented,
That place I shall name The Lapis Lazuli Quay."
26



Then Enki spoke to Inanna, saying:
"In the name of my power! In the name of my holy shrine!
Let the me you have taken with you remain in the holy shrine
of your city.
Let the high priest spend his days at the holy shrine in song.
Let the citizens of your city prosper,
Let the children of Uruk rejoice.
The people of Uruk are allies of the people of Eridu.
Let the city of Uruk be restored to its great place."
27






THE COURTSHIP OF INANNA
AND DUMUZI



The brother spoke to his younger sister.
The Sun God, Utu, spoke to Inanna, saying:
"Young Lady, the flax in its fullness is lovely.
Inanna, the grain is glistening in the furrow.
I will hoe it for you. I will bring it to you.
A piece of linen, big or small, is always needed.
Inanna, I will bring it to you."
"Brother, after you've brought me the flax,
Who will comb it for me?"
"Sister, I will bring it to you combed."
30



"Utu, after you've brought it to me combed,
Who will spin it for me?"
"Inanna, I will bring it to you spun."
"Brother, after you've brought the flax to me spun,
Who will braid it for me?"
"Sister, I will bring it to you braided."
"Utu, after you've brought it to me braided,
Who will warp it for me?"
"Inanna, I will bring it to you warped."
"Brother, after you've brought the flax to me warped,
Who will weave it for me?"
"Sister, I will bring it to you woven."
"Utu, after you've brought it to me woven,
Who will bleach it for me?"
"Inanna, I will bring it to you bleached."
"Brother, after you've brought my bridal sheet to me,
Who will go to bed with me?
Utu, who will go to bed with me?"
"Sister, your bridegroom will go to bed with you.
He who was born from a fertile womb,
He who was conceived on the sacred marriage throne,
Dumuzi, the shepherd! He will go to bed with you."
31



Inanna spoke:
"No, brother!
The man of my heart works the hoe.
The farmer! He is the man of my heart!
He gathers the grain into great heaps.
He brings the grain regularly into my storehouses.
Utu spoke:
"Sister, marry the shepherd.
Why are you unwilling?
32



His cream is good; his milk is good.
Whatever he touches shines brightly.
Inanna, marry Dumuzi.
You who adorn yourself with the agate necklace of fertility,
Why are you unwilling?
Dumuzi will share his rich cream with you.
You who are meant to be the king's protector,
Why are you unwilling?"
Inanna spoke:
"The shepherd! I will not marry the shepherd!
His clothes are coarse; his wool is rough.
I will marry the farmer.
The farmer grows flax for my clothes.
The farmer grows barley for my table."
Dumuzi spoke:
"Why do you speak about the farmer?
Why do you speak about him?
If he gives you black flour,
I will give you black wool.
If he gives you white flour,
I will give you white wool.
If he gives you beer,
I will give you sweet milk.
If he gives you bread,
I will give you honey cheese.
33



I will give the farmer my leftover cream.
I will give the farmer my leftover milk.
Why do you speak about the farmer?
What does he have more than I do?"
Inanna spoke:
"Shepherd, without my mother, Ningal, you'd be driven away,
Without my grandmother, Ningikuga, you'd be driven into the
steppes,
Without my father, Nanna, you'd have no roof,
Without my brother, Utu
Dumuzi spoke:
"Inanna, do not start a quarrel.
My father, Enki, is as good as your father, Nanna.
My mother, Sirtur, is as good as your mother, Ningal.
My sister, Geshtinanna, is as good as yours.
Queen of the palace, let us talk it over.
Inanna, let us sit and speak together.
I am as good as Utu.
Enki is as good as Nanna.
Sirtur is as good as Ningal.
Queen of the palace, let us talk it over."
The word they had spoken
Was a word of desire.
From the starting of the quarrel
Came the lovers' desire.
34



The shepherd went to the royal house with cream.
Dumuzi went to the royal house with milk.
Before the door, he called out:
"Open the house, My Lady, open the house!"
Inanna ran to Ningal, the mother who bore her.
Ningal counseled her daughter, saying:
"My child, the young man will be your father.
My daughter, the young man will be your mother.
He will treat you like a father.
He will care for you like a mother.
Open the house, My Lady, open the house!"
Inanna, at her mother's command,
Bathed and anointed herself with scented oil.
She covered her body with the royal white robe.
She readied her dowry.
She arranged her precious lapis beads around her neck.
She took her seal in her hand.
Dumuzi waited expectantly.
35



Inanna opened the door for him.
Inside the house she shone before him
Like the light of the moon.
Dumuzi looked at her joyously.
He pressed his neck close against hers.
He kissed her.
Inanna spoke:
"What I tell you
Let the singer weave into song.
What I tell you,
Let it flow from ear to mouth,
Let it pass from old to young:
36



My vulva, the horn,
The Boat of Heaven,
Is full of eagerness like the young moon.
My untilled land lies fallow.
As for me, Inanna,
Who will plow my vulva?
Who will plow my high field?
Who will plow my wet ground?
As for me, the young woman,
Who will plow my vulva?
Who will station the ox there?
Who will plow my vulva?"
Dumuzi replied:
"Great Lady, the king will plow your vulva.
I, Dumuzi the King, will plow your vulva."
Inanna:
"Then plow my vulva, man of my heart!
Plow my vulva!"
At the king's lap stood the rising cedar.
Plants grew high by their side.
Grains grew high by their side.
Gardens flourished luxuriantly.
37



Inanna sang:
"He has sprouted; he has burgeoned;
He is lettuce planted by the water.
He is the one my womb loves best.
My well-stocked garden of the plain,
My barley growing high in its furrow,
My apple tree which bears fruit up to its crown,
He is lettuce planted by the water.
My honey-man, my honey-man sweetens me always.
My lord, the honey-man of the gods,
He is the one my womb loves best.
His hand is honey, his foot is honey,
He sweetens me always.
My eager impetuous caresser of the navel,
My caresser of the soft thighs,
He is the one my womb loves best,
He is lettuce planted by the water."
38



Dumuzi sang:
44 0 Lady, your breast is your field.
Inanna, your breast is your field.
Your broad field pours out plants.
Your broad field pours out grain.
Water flows from on high for your servant.
Bread flows from on high for your servant.
Pour it out for me, Inanna.
I will drink all you offer."
"Make your milk sweet and thick, my bridegroom.
My shepherd, I will drink your fresh milk.
Wild bull, Dumuzi, make your milk sweet and thick.
I will drink your fresh milk.
Let the milk of the goat flow in my sheepfold.
Fill my holy churn with honey cheese.
Lord Dumuzi, I will drink your fresh milk.
My husband, I will guard my sheepfold for you.
I will watch over your house of life, the storehouse,
The shining quivering place which delights Sumer
The house which decides the fates of the land,
The house which gives the breath of life to the people.
I, the queen of the palace, will watch over your house."
Inanna sang:
39



Dumuzi spoke:
"My sister, I would go with you to my garden.
Inanna, I would go with you to my garden.
I would go with you to my orchard.
I would go with you to my apple tree.
There I would plant the sweet, honey-covered seed."
Inanna spoke:
"He brought me into his garden.
My brother, Dumuzi, brought me into his garden.
I strolled with him among the standing trees,
I stood with him among the fallen trees,
By an apple tree I knelt as is proper.
Before my brother coming in song,
Who rose to me out of the poplar leaves,
Who came to me in the midday heat,
Before my lord Dumuzi,
I poured out plants from my womb.
I placed plants before him,
I poured out plants before him.
I placed grain before him,
I poured out grain before him.
I poured out grain from my womb."
40



Inanna sang:
"Last night as I, the queen, was shining bright,
Last night as I, the Queen of Heaven, was shining bright,
As I was shining bright and dancing,
Singing praises at the coming of the night
He met me—he met me!
My lord Dumuzi met me.
He put his hand into my hand.
He pressed his neck close against mine.
My high priest is ready for the holy loins.
My lord Dumuzi is ready for the holy loins.
The plants and herbs in his field are ripe.
O Dumuzi! Your fullness is my delight!"
41



She called for it, she called for it, she called for the bed!
She called for the bed that rejoices the heart.
She called for the bed that sweetens the loins.
She called for the bed of kingship.
She called for the bed of queenship.
Inanna called for the bed:
"Let the bed that rejoices the heart be prepared!
Let the bed that sweetens the loins be prepared!
Let the bed of kingship be prepared!
Let the bed of queenship be prepared!
Let the royal bed be prepared!"
Inanna spread the bridal sheet across the bed.
She called to the king:
"The bed is ready!"
She called to her bridegroom:
"The bed is waiting!"
42



He put his hand in her hand.
He put his hand to her heart.
Sweet is the sleep of hand-to-hand.
Sweeter still the sleep of heart-to-heart.
43



Inanna spoke:
"I bathed for the wild bull,
I bathed for the shepherd Dumuzi,
I perfumed my sides with ointment,
I coated my mouth with sweet-smelling amber,
I painted my eyes with kohl.
He shaped my loins with his fair hands,
The shepherd Dumuzi filled my lap with cream and milk,
He stroked my pubic hair,
He watered my womb.
He laid his hands on my holy vulva,
He smoothed my black boat with cream,
He quickened my narrow boat with milk,
He caressed me on the bed.
Now I will caress my high priest on the bed,
I will caress the faithful shepherd Dumuzi,
I will caress his loins, the shepherdship of the land,
I will decree a sweet fate for him."
The Queen of Heaven,
The heroic woman, greater than her mother,
Who was presented the me by Enki,
Inanna, the First Daughter of the Moon,
Decreed the fate of Dumuzi:
44



"In battle I am your leader,
In combat I am your armor-bearer,
In the assembly I am your advocate,
On the campaign I am your inspiration.
You, the chosen shepherd of the holy shrine,
You, the king, the faithful provider of Uruk,
You, the light of An's great shrine,
In all ways you are fit:
To hold your head high on the lofty dais,
To sit on the lapis lazuli throne,
To cover your head with the holy crown,
To wear long clothes on your body,
To bind yourself with the garments of kingship,
To carry the mace and sword,
To guide straight the long bow and arrow,
To fasten the throw-stick and sling at your side,
To race on the road with the holy sceptre in your hand,
And the holy sandals on your feet,
To prance on the holy breast like a lapis lazuli calf.
You, the sprinter, the chosen shepherd,
In all ways you are fit.
May your heart enjoy long days.
That which An has determined for you—may it not be altered
That which Enlil has granted—may it not be changed.
You are the favorite of Ningal.
Inanna holds you dear."
45



Ninshubur, the faithful servant of the holy shrine of Uruk,
Led Dumuzi to the sweet thighs of Inanna and spoke:
"My queen, here is the choice of your heart,
The king, your beloved bridegroom.
May he spend long days in the sweetness of your holy loins.
Give him a favorable and glorious reign.
Grant him the king's throne, firm in its foundations.
Grant him the shepherd's staff of judgment.
Grant him the enduring crown with the radiant and noble
diadem.
From where the sun rises to where the sun sets,
From south to north,
From the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea,
From the land of the huluppu- tree to the land of the cedar,
Let his shepherd's staff protect all of Sumer and Akkad.
As the farmer, let him make the fields fertile,
As the shepherd, let him make the sheepfolds multiply,
Under his reign let there be vegetation,
Under his reign let there be rich grain.
In the marshland may the fish and birds chatter,
In the canebrake may the young and old reeds grow high,
In the steppe may the masbgur- trees grow high,
In the forests may the deer and wild goats multiply,
In the orchards may there be honey and wine,
46



In the gardens may the lettuce and cress grow high,
In the palace may there be long life.
May there be floodwater in the Tigris and Euphrates,
May the plants grow high on their banks and fill the meadows,
May the Lady of Vegetation pile the grain in heaps and mounds.
O my Queen of Heaven and Earth,
Queen of all the universe,
May he enjoy long days in the sweetness of your holy loins."
The king went with lifted head to the holy loins.
He went with lifted head to the loins of Inanna.
He went to the queen with lifted head.
He opened wide his arms to the holy priestess of heaven.
47



Inanna spoke:
"My beloved, the delight of my eyes, met me.
We rejoiced together.
He took his pleasure of me.
He brought me into his house.
He laid me down on the fragrant honey-bed.
My sweet love, lying by my heart,
Tongue-playing, one by one,
My fair Dumuzi did so fifty times.
Now, my sweet love is sated.
Now he says:
'Set me free, my sister, set me free.
You will be a little daughter to my father.
Come, my beloved sister, I would go to the palace.
Set me free . .
"
48



Inanna spoke:
"My blossom-bearer, your allure was sweet.
My blossom-bearer in the apple orchard,
My bearer of fruit in the apple orchard,
Dumuzi-rf&ZM, your allure was sweet.
My fearless one,
My holy statue,
My statue outfitted with sword and lapis lazuli diadem,
How sweet was your allure. ..."
49






THE DESCENT OF INANNA



FROM THE GREAT ABOVE
TO THE GREAT BELOW
From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below.
From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below.
From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.
My Lady abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld.
Inanna abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld.
She abandoned her office of holy priestess to descend to the underwi
In Uruk she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
In Badtibira she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
In Zabalam she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
In Adab she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
In Nippur she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
In Kish she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
In Akkad she abandoned her temple to descend to the underwotld
52



She gathered together the seven me.
She took them into her hands.
With the me in her possession, she prepared herself:
She placed the shugurra, the crown of the steppe, on her head.
She arranged the dark locks of hair across her forehead.
She tied the small lapis beads around her neck,
Let the double strand of beads fall to her breast,
And wrapped the royal robe around her body.
She daubed her eyes with ointment called "Let him come,
Let him come,"
Bound the breastplate called "Come, man, come!" around her chest,
Slipped the gold ring over her wrist,
And took the lapis measuring rod and line in her hand.
Inanna set out for the underworld.
Ninshubur, her faithful servant, went with her.
Inanna spoke to her, saying:
"Ninshubur, my constant support,
My sukkal who gives me wise advice,
My warrior who rights by my side,
I am descending to the kur, to the underworld.
If I do not return,
Set up a lament for me by the ruins.
Beat the drum for me in the assembly places.
Circle the houses of the gods.
Tear at your eyes, at your mouth, at your thighs.
Dress yourself in a single garment like a beggar.
Go to Nippur, to the temple of Enlil.
53



When you enter his holy shrine, cry out:
'O Father Enlil, do not let your daughter
Be put to death in the underworld.
Do not let your bright silver
Be covered with the dust of the underworld.
Do not let your precious lapis
Be broken into stone for the stoneworker.
Do not let your fragrant boxwood
Be cut into wood for the woodworker.
Do not let the holy priestess of heaven
Be put to death in the underworld.'
If Enlil will not help you,
Go to Ur, to the temple of Nanna.
Weep before Father Nanna.
If Nanna will not help you,
Go to Eridu, to the temple of Enki.
Weep before Father Enki.
Father Enki, the God of Wisdom, knows the food of life,
He knows the water of life;
He knows the secrets.
Surely he will not let me die."
Inanna continued on her way to the underworld.
Then she stopped and said:
"Go now, Ninshubur
Do not forget the words I have commanded you."
When Inanna arrived at the outer gates of the underworld, She knocked loudly.
54



She cried out in a fierce voice:
"Open the door, gatekeeper!
Open the door, Neti!
I alone would enter!"
Neti, the chief gatekeeper of the kur, asked:
"Who are you?"
She answered:
"I am Inanna, Queen of Heaven,
On my way to the East."
Neti said:
"If you are truly Inanna, Queen of Heaven,
On your way to the East,
Why has your heart led you on the road
From which no traveler returns?"
Inanna answered:
"Because ... of my older sister, Ereshkigal,
Her husband, Gugalanna, the Bull of Heaven, has died.
I have come to witness the funeral rites.
Let the beer of his funeral rites be poured into the cup.
Let it be done."
Neti spoke:
"Stay here, Inanna, I will speak to my queen.
I will give her your message."
55



Neti, the chief gatekeeper of the kur,
Entered the palace of Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld
and said:
"My queen, a maid
As tall as heaven,
As wide as the earth,
As strong as the foundations of the city wall,
Waits outside the palace gates.
She has gathered together the seven me.
She has taken them into her hands.
With the me in her possession, she has prepared herself:
On her head she wears the shugurra, the crown of the steppe.
Across her forehead her dark locks of hair are carefully
arranged.
Around her neck she wears the small lapis beads.
At her breast she wears the double strand of beads.
Her body is wrapped with the royal robe.
Her eyes are daubed with the ointment called, 'Let him come,
let him come.'
Around her chest she wears the breastplate called 'Come, man,
come!'
On her wrist she wears the gold ring.
In her hand she carries the lapis measuring rod and line.
When Ereshkigal heard this,
She slapped her thigh and bit her lip.
She took the matter into her heart and dwelt on it.
Then she spoke:
56



"Come, Neti, my chief gatekeeper of the kur,
Heed my words:
Bolt the seven gates of the underworld.
Then, one by one, open each gate a crack.
Let Inanna enter.
As she enters, remove her royal garments.
Let the holy priestess of heaven enter bowed low."
Neti heeded the words of his queen.
He bolted the seven gates of the underworld.
Then he opened the outer gate.
He said to the maid:
"Come, Inanna, enter."
When she entered the first gate,
From her head, the shugurra, the crown of the steppe, was removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
57



She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
When she entered the second gate,
From her neck the small lapis beads were removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
When she entered the third gate,
From her breast the double strand of beads was removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
When she entered the fourth gate,
From her chest the breastplate called "Come, man, come!"
was removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
58



She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
When she entered the fifth gate,
From her wrist the gold ring was removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
When she entered the sixth gate,
From her hand the lapis measuring rod and line was removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
When she entered the seventh gate,
From her body the royal robe was removed.
Inanna asked:
"What is this?"
59



She was told:
"Quiet, Inanna, the ways of the underworld are perfect.
They may not be questioned."
Naked and bowed low, Inanna entered the throne room.
Ereshkigal rose from her throne.
Inanna started toward the throne.
The Annuna, the judges of the underworld, surrounded her.
They passed judgment against her.
Then Ereshkigal fastened on Inanna the eye of death.
She spoke against her the word of wrath.
She uttered against her the cry of guilt.
She struck her.
Inanna was turned into a corpse,
A piece of rotting meat,
And was hung from a hook on the wall.
60



When, after three days and three nights, Inanna had not returned,
Ninshubur set up a lament for her by the ruins.
She beat the drum for her in the assembly places.
She circled the houses of the gods.
She tore at her eyes; she tore at her mouth; she tore at her thighs.
She dressed herself in a single garment like a beggar.
Alone, she set out for Nippur and the temple of Enlil.
When she entered the holy shrine,
She cried out:
"O Father Enlil, do not let your daughter
Be put to death in the underworld.
Do not let your bright silver
Be covered with the dust of the underworld.
Do not let your precious lapis
Be broken into stone for the stoneworker.
Do not let your fragrant boxwood
Be cut into wood for the woodworker.
Do not let the holy priestess of heaven
Be put to death in the underworld."
Father Enlil answered angrily:
"My daughter craved the Great Above.
Inanna craved the Great Below.
She who receives the me of the underworld does not return.
She who goes to the Dark City stays there."
Father Enlil would not help.
61



Ninshubur went to Ur and the temple of Nanna.
When she entered the holy shrine,
She cried out:
"O Father Nanna, do not let your daughter
Be put to death in the underworld.
Do not let your bright silver
Be covered with the dust of the underworld.
Do not let your precious lapis
Be broken into stone for the stoneworker.
Do not let your fragrant boxwood
Be cut into wood for the woodworker.
Do not let the holy priestess of heaven.
Be put to death in the underworld."
Father Nanna answered angrily:
"My daughter craved the Great Above.
Inanna craved the Great Below.
She who receives the me of the underworld does not return.
She who goes to the Dark City stays there.
Father Nanna would not help.
Ninshubur went to Eridu and the temple of Enki.
When she entered the holy shrine,
She cried out:
"O Father Enki, do not let your daughter
Be put to death in the underworld.
Do not let your bright silver
Be covered with the dust of the underworld.
62



Do not let your precious lapis
Be broken into stone for the stoneworker.
Do not let your fragrant boxwood
Be cut into wood for the woodworker.
Do not let the holy priestess of heaven
Be put to death in the underworld."
Father Enki said:
"What has happened?
What has my daughter done?
Inanna! Queen of All the Lands! Holy Priestess of
What has happened?
I am troubled. I am grieved."
63



From under his fingernail Father Enki brought forth dirt.
He fashioned the dirt into a kurgarra, a creature neither male nor
female.
From under the fingernail of his other hand he brought forth dirt.
He fashioned the dirt into a galatur, a creature neither male nor female.
He gave the food of life to the kurgarra.
He gave the water of life to the galatur.
Enki spoke to the kurgarra and galatur, saying:
"Go to the underworld,
Enter the door like flies.
Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld, is moaning
With the cries of a woman about to give birth.
No linen is spread over her body.
Her breasts are uncovered.
Her hair swirls about her head like leeks.
When she cries, 'Oh! Oh! My inside!'
Cry also, 'Oh! Oh! Your inside!'
When she cries, 'Oh! Oh! My outside!'
Cry also, 'Oh! Oh! Your outside!'
The queen will be pleased.
She will offer you a gift.
Ask her only for the corpse that hangs from the hook on
the wall.
One of you will sprinkle the food of life on it.
The other will sprinkle the water of life.
Inanna will arise."
The kurgarra and the galatur heeded Enki's words.
They set out for the underworld.
Like flies, they slipped through the cracks of the gates.
They entered the throne room of the Queen of the Underworld.
64



No linen was spread over her body.
Her breasts were uncovered.
Her hair swirled around her head like leeks.
Ereshkigal was moaning:
"Oh! Oh! My inside!"
They moaned:
"Oh! Oh! Your inside!"
She moaned:
"Ohhhh! Oh! My outside!"
They moaned:
"Ohhhh! Oh! Your outside!"
She groaned:
"Oh! Oh! My belly!"
They groaned:
"Oh! Oh! Your belly!"
She groaned:
"Oh! Ohhhh! My back!!"
They groaned:
"Oh! Ohhhh! Your back!!"
65



She sighed:
44 Ah! Ah! My heart!"
They sighed:
44 Ah! Ah! Your heart!"
She sighed:
44 Ah! Ahhhh! My liver!"
They sighed:
44 Ah! Ahhhh! Your liver!"
Ereshkigal stopped.
She looked at them.
She asked:
"Who are you,
Moaning—groaning—sighing with me?
If you are gods, I will bless you.
If you are mortals, I will give you a gift.
I will give you the water-gift, the river in its fullness."
The kurgarra and galatur answered:
"We do not wish it."
Ereshkigal said:
44
I will give you the grain-gift, the fields in harvest.
The kurgarra and galatur said:
"We do not wish it."
66



Ereshkigal said:
"Speak then! What do you wish?"
They answered:
4 4 We wish only the corpse that hangs from the hook on the
wall."
Ereshkigal said:
"The corpse belongs to Inanna."
They said:
"Whether it belongs to our queen,
Whether it belongs to our king,
That is what we wish."
The corpse was given to them.
The kurgarra sprinkled the food of life on the corpse.
The galatur sprinkled the water of life on the corpse.
Inanna arose. . . .
67



Inanna was about to ascend from the underworld
When the Annuna, the judges of the underworld, seized her.
They said:
"No one ascends from the underworld unmarked.
If Inanna wishes to return from the underworld,
She must provide someone in her place."
As Inanna ascended from the underworld,
The galla, the demons of the underworld, clung to her side.
The galla were demons who know no food, who know no drink,
Who eat no offerings, who drink no libations,
Who accept no gifts.
They enjoy no lovemaking.
They have no sweet children to kiss.
They tear the wife from the husband's arms,
They tear the child from the father's knees,
They steal the bride from her marriage home.
The demons clung to Inanna.
The small galla who accompanied Inanna
Were like reeds the size of low picket fences.
The large galla who accompanied Inanna
Were like reeds the size of high picket fences.
The one who walked in front of Inanna was not a minister,
Yet he carried a sceptre.
The one who walked behind her was not a warrior,
Yet he carried a mace.
Ninshubur, dressed in a soiled sackcloth,
68



Waited outside the palace gates.
When she saw Inanna
Surrounded by the galla,
She threw herself in the dust at Inanna's feet.
The galla said:
"Walk on, Inanna,
We will take Ninshubur in your place."
Inanna cried:
"No! Ninshubur is my constant support.
She is my sukkal who gives me wise advice.
She is my warrior who fights by my side.
She did not forget my words.
She set up a lament for me by the ruins.
She beat the drum for me at the assembly places.
She circled the houses of the gods.
She tore at her eyes, at her mouth, at her thighs.
She dressed herself in a single garment like a beggar.
Alone, she set out for Nippur and the temple of Enlil.
She went to Ur and the temple of Nanna.
She went to Eridu and the temple of Enki.
Because of her, my life was saved.
I will never give Ninshubur to you."
The galla said:
"Walk on, Inanna,
We will accompany you to Umma."
69



In Umma, at the holy shrine,
Shara, the son of Inanna, was dressed in a soiled sackcloth
When he saw Inanna
Surrounded by the galla.
He threw himself in the dust at her feet.
The galla said:
"Walk on to your city, Inanna,
We will take Shara in your place.
Inanna cried:
No! Not Shara!
He is my son who >:r-i:s r.vrr^s :o me.
He is my son who cuti rr.y nails and smooths my hair.
I w411 never give Shara :c you.
The gjlU said:
"Walk on. Inanna.

In Badtibira, at the holy shnne.
Lulah the son of Inanna. was iressec :r. i souec sucsdoth.

He threw himself in the du>: u: he: fee:.
The said:
'Walk on to your city. I-.iar.r.a.
We will rake l uUl tn \ou: ?..•;;



Inanna cried:
"Not Lulal! He is my son.
He is a leader among men.
He is my right arm. He is my left arm.
I will never give Lulal to you."
The galla said:
"Walk on to your city, Inanna.
We will go with you to the big apple tree in Uruk."
In Uruk, by the big apple tree,
Dumuzi, the husband of Inanna, was dressed in his shining me- garments.
He sat on his magnificent throne; (he did not move).
The galla seized him by his thighs.
They poured milk out of his seven churns.
They broke the reed pipe which the shepherd was playing.
Inanna fastened on Dumuzi the eye of death.
She spoke against him the word of wrath.
She uttered against him the cry of guilt:
"Take him! Take Dumuzi away!"
The galla, who know no food, who know no drink,
Who eat no offerings, who drink no libations,
Who accept no gifts, seized Dumuzi.
They made him stand up; they made him sit down.
They beat the husband of Inanna.
They gashed him with axes.
71



Dumuzi let out a wail.
He raised his hands to heaven to Utu, the God of Justice,
and beseeched him:
"O Utu, you are my brother-in-law,
I am the husband of your sister.
I brought cream to your mother's house,
I brought milk to Ningal's house.
I am the one who carried food to the holy shrine.
I am the one who brought wedding gifts to Uruk.
I am the one who danced on the holy knees, the knees
Inanna.
Utu, you who are a just god, a merciful god,
Change my hands into the hands of a snake.
Change my feet into the feet of a snake.
Let me escape from my demons;
Do not let them hold me."
72



The merciful Utu accepted Dumuzi's tears.
He changed the hands of Dumuzi into snake hands.
He changed the feet of Dumuzi into snake feet.
Dumuzi escaped from his demons.
They could not hold him. . . .
73



THE DREAM OF DUMUZI
His heart was filled with tears.
The shepherd's heart was filled with tears.
Dumuzi's heart was filled with tears.
Dumuzi stumbled across the steppe, weeping:
"O steppe, set up a wail for me!
O crabs in the river, mourn for me!
O frogs in the river, call for me!
O my mother, Sirtur, weep for me!
If she does not find the five breads,
If she does not find the ten breads,
If she does not know the day I am dead,
You, O steppe, tell her, tell my mother.
On the steppe, my mother will shed tears for me.
On the steppe, my little sister will mourn for me.
74



He lay down to rest.
The shepherd lay down to rest.
Dumuzi lay down to rest.
As he lay among the buds and rushes,
He dreamed a dream.
He awoke from his dream.
He trembled from his vision.
He rubbed his eyes, terrified.
Dumuzi called out:
"Bring . . . bring her . . . bring my sister.
Bring my Geshtinanna, my little sister,
My tablet-knowing scribe,
My singer who knows many songs,
My sister who knows the meaning of words,
My wise woman who knows the meaning of dreams.
I must speak to her.
I must tell her my dream."
Dumuzi spoke to Geshtinanna, saying:
"A dream! My sister, listen to my dream:
Rushes rise all about me; rushes grow thick about me.
A single growing reed trembles for me.
From a double-growing reed, first one, then the other,
is removed.
In a wooded grove, the terror of tall trees rises about me.
Water is poured over my holy hearth.
The bottom of my churn drops away.
My drinking cup falls from its peg.
My shepherd's crook has disappeared.
75



An eagle seizes a lamb from the sheepfold.
A falcon catches a sparrow on the reed fence.
My sister, your goats drag their lapis beards in the dust.
Your sheep scratch the earth with bent feet.
The churn lies silent; no milk is poured.
The cup lies shattered; Dumuzi is no more.
The sheepfold is given to the winds."
Geshtinanna spoke:
"My brother, do not tell me your dream.
Dumuzi, do not tell me such a dream.
The rushes which rise all about you,
The rushes which grow thick about you,
Are your demons, who will pursue and attack you.
The single growing reed which trembles for you
Is our mother; she will mourn for you.
The double-growing reed, from which one, then the other, is
removed, Dumuzi,
Is you and I; first one, then the other, will be taken away.
In the wooded grove, the terror of tall trees which rises about
you
Is the galla; they will descend on you in the sheepfold.
When the fire is put out on your holy hearth,
The sheepfold will become a house of desolation.
When the bottom of your churn drops away,
You will be held by the galla.
When your drinking cup falls from its peg,
76



You will fall to the earth, onto your mother's knees.
When your shepherd's crook disappears,
The galla will cause everything to wither.
The eagle who seizes a lamb in the sheepfold
Is the galla who will scratch your cheeks.
The falcon who catches a sparrow in the reed fence
Is the galla who will climb the fence to take you away.
Dumuzi, my goats drag their lapis beards in the dust.
My hair will swirl around in heaven for you.
My sheep scratch the earth with bent feet.
O Dumuzi, I will tear at my cheeks in grief for you.
The churn lies silent; no milk is poured.
The cup lies shattered; Dumuzi is no more.
The sheepfold is given to the winds
Scarcely had she spoken these words
When Dumuzi cried out:
"My sister! Quickly, go up the hill!
Do not go with slow noble steps.
Sister, run!
The galla, hated and feared by men,
Are coming on the boats.
They carry wood to bind the hands;
They carry wood to bind the neck.
Sister, run!"
Geshtinanna went up the hill.
Dumuzi's friend went with her.
77



Dumuzi cried:
"Do you see them?"
The friend cried:
"They are coming;
The large galla who carry wood to bind the neck,
They are coming for you."
Geshtinanna cried:
"Quickly, brother!
Hide your head in the grass.
Your demons are coming for you."
Dumuzi said:
"My sister, tell no one my hiding place.
My friend, tell no one my hiding place.
I will hide in the grass.
I will hide among the small plants.
I will hide among the large plants.
I will hide in the ditches of Arali."
Geshtinanna and Dumuzi 's friend answered:
"Dumuzi, if we tell your hiding place,
Let your dogs devour us,
Your black dogs of shepherdship,
Your royal dogs of kingship,
Let your dogs devour us!"
The small galla spoke to the large galla:
"You galla, who have no mother, or father,
No sister, brother, wife, or child,
78



You who flutter over heaven and earth like wardens,
Who cling to a man's side,
Who show no favor,
Who know not good from evil,
Tell us,
Who has ever seen the soul of a frightened man
Living in peace?
Let us not look for Dumuzi in the home of his friend.
Let us not look for Dumuzi in the home of his brother-in-law.
Let us look for Dumuzi in the home of his sister, Geshtinanna."
The galla clapped their hands gleefully.
They went searching for Dumuzi.
They came to the home of Geshtinanna. They cried out:
"Show us where your brother is!"
Geshtinanna would not speak.
They offered her the water-gift.
She refused it.
They offered her the grain-gift.
She refused it.
Heaven was brought close.
Earth was brought close.
Geshtinanna would not speak.
They tore her clothes.
They poured pitch into her vulva.
Geshtinanna would not speak.
79



The small galla said to the large galla:
4 'Who since the beginning of time
Has ever known a sister to reveal a brother's hiding place?
Come, let us look for Dumuzi in the home of his friend."
The galla went to Dumuzi's friend.
They offered him the water-gift.
He accepted it.
They offered him the grain-gift.
He accepted it.
He said:
"Dumuzi hid in the grass,
But I do not know the place."
The galla searched for Dumuzi in the grass.
They did not find him.
The friend said:
"Dumuzi hid among the small plants,
But I do not know the place."
The galla searched for Dumuzi among the small plants.
They did not find him.
The friend said:
"Dumuzi hid among the large plants,
But I do not know the place."
The galla searched for Dumuzi among the large plants.
They did not find him.
The friend said:
"Dumuzi hid in the ditches of Arali.
Dumuzi fell down in the ditches of Arali."
80



In the ditches of Arali, the galla caught Dumuzi.
Dumuzi turned pale and wept.
He cried out:
"My sister saved my life.
My friend caused my death.
If my sister's child wanders in the street,
Let the child be protected—let the child be blessed.
If my friend's child wanders in the street,
Let the child be lost—let the child be cursed."
The galla surrounded Dumuzi.
They bound his hands; they bound his neck.
They beat the husband of Inanna.
Dumuzi raised his arms to heaven, to Utu, the God of Justice,
and cried out:
"O Utu, you are my brother-in-law,
I am the husband of your sister.
I am the one who carried food to the holy shrine.
I am the one who brought wedding gifts to Uruk.
I kissed the holy lips,
I danced on the holy knees, the knees of Inanna.
Change my hands into the hands of a gazelle.
Change my feet into the feet of a gazelle.
Let me escape from my demons.
Let me flee to Kubiresh!"
The merciful Utu accepted Dumuzi's tears.
He changed his hands into the hands of a gazelle.
He changed his feet into the feet of a gazelle.
Dumuzi escaped from his demons.
He fled to Kubiresh.
81



The galla said:
"Let us go to Kubiresh!"
The galla arrived in Kubiresh.
Dumuzi escaped from his demons.
He fled to Old Belili.
The galla said:
"Let us go to Old Belili!"
Dumuzi entered the house of Old Belili. He said to her
"Old woman. I am not a mere mortal.
I am the husband of the goddess Inanna.
Pour water for me to drink.
Sprinkle flour for me to eat."
82



After the old woman poured water
And sprinkled flour for Dumuzi,
She left the house.
When the galla saw her leave, they entered the house.
Dumuzi escaped from his demons.
He fled to the sheepfold of his sister, Geshtinanna.
When Geshtinanna found Dumuzi in the sheepfold, she wept.
She brought her mouth close to heaven.
She brought her mouth close to earth.
Her grief covered the horizon like a garment.
She tore at her eyes.
She tore at her mouth.
She tore at her thighs.
The galla climbed the reed fence.
The first galla struck Dumuzi on the cheek with a piercing nail,
The second galla struck Dumuzi on the other cheek with the shepherd's
crook,
The third galla smashed the bottom of the churn,
The fourth galla threw the drinking cup down from its peg,
The fifth galla shattered the churn,
The sixth galla shattered the cup,
The seventh galla cried:
"Rise, Dumuzi!
Husband of Inanna, son of Sirtur, brother of Geshtinanna!
Rise from your false sleep!
Your ewes are seized! Your lambs are seized!
Your goats are seized! Your kids are seized!
83



Take off your holy crown from your head!
Take off your me- garment from your body!
Let your royal sceptre fall to the ground!
Take off your holy sandals from your feet!
Naked, you go with us!"
The galla seized Dumuzi.
They surrounded him.
They bound his hands. They bound his neck.
The churn was silent. No milk was poured.
The cup was shattered. Dumuzi was no more.
The sheepfold was given to the winds.
84



THE RETURN
A lament was raised in the city:
"My Lady weeps bitterly for her young husband.
Inanna weeps bitterly for her young husband.
Woe for her husband! Woe for her young love!
Woe for her house! Woe for her city!
Dumuzi was taken captive in Uruk.
He will no longer bathe in Eridu.
He will no longer soap himself at the holy shrine.
He will no longer treat the mother of Inanna as his mother.
He will no longer perform his sweet task
Among the maidens of the city.
He will no longer compete with the young men of the city.
He will no longer raise his sword higher than the kurgarra
priests.
Great is the grief of those who mourn for Dumuzi."
85



Inanna wept for Dumuzi:
"Gone is my husband, my sweet husband.
Gone is my love, my sweet love.
My beloved has been taken from the city.
O, you flies of the steppe,
My beloved bridegroom has been taken from me
Before I could wrap him with a proper shroud.
The wild bull lives no more.
The shepherd, the wild bull lives no more.
Dumuzi, the wild bull, lives no more.
I ask the hills and valleys:
'Where is my husband?'
I say to them:
'I can no longer bring him food.
I can no longer serve him drink.'
The jackal lies down in his bed.
The raven dwells in his sheepfold.
You ask me about his reed pipe?
The wind must play it for him.
You ask me about his sweet songs?
The wind must sing them for him."
Sirtur, the mother of Dumuzi, wept for her son:
"My heart plays the reed pipe of mourning.
Once my boy wandered so freely on the steppe,
Now he is captive.
Once Dumuzi wandered so freely on the steppe,
Now he is bound.
86



The ewe gives up her lamb.
The goat gives up her kid.
My heart plays the reed pipe of mourning.
0 treacherous steppe!
In the place where he once said
'My mother will ask for me,'
Now he cannot move his hands.
He cannot move his feet.
My heart plays the reed pipe of mourning.
1 would go to him,
I would see my child."
The mother walked to the desolate place.
Sirtur walked to where Dumuzi lay.
She looked at the slain wild bull.
She looked into his face. She said:
"My child, the face is yours.
The spirit has fled."
There is mourning in the house.
There is grief in the inner chambers.
The sister wandered about the city, weeping for her brother.
Geshtinanna wandered about the city, weeping for Dumuzi:
"O my brother! Who is your sister?
I am your sister.
0 Dumuzi! Who is your mother?
1 am your mother.
87



The day that dawns for you will also dawn for me.
The day that you will see I will also see.
I would find my brother! I would comfort him!
I would share his fate!"
When she saw the sister's grief,
When Inanna saw the grief of Geshtinanna,
She spoke to her gently:
"Your brother's house is no more.
Dumuzi has been carried away by the galla.
I would take you to him,
But I do not know the place."
Then a fly appeared.
The holy fly circled the air above Inanna's head and spoke:
"If I tell you where Dumuzi is,
What will you give me?"
Inanna said:
"If you tell me,
I will let you frequent the beer-houses and taverns.
I will let you dwell among the talk of the wise ones.
I will let you dwell among the songs of the minstrels.
The fly spoke:
"Lift your eyes to the edges of the steppe,
Lift your eyes to Arali.
88



There you will find Geshtinanna's brother,
There you will find the shepherd Dumuzi."
Inanna and Geshtinanna went to the edges of the steppe.
They found Dumuzi weeping.
Inanna took Dumuzi by the hand and said:
"You will go to the underworld
Half the year.
Your sister, since she has asked,
Will go the other half.
On the day you are called,
That day you will be taken.
On the day Geshtinanna is called,
That day you will be set free."
Inanna placed Dumuzi in the hands of the eternal.
Holy Ereshkigal! Great is your renown!
Holy Ereshkigal! I sing your praises!
89

They carry the sword and double-edged ax.
The ascending kurgarra priests raise their swords before you.
The priest, who covers his sword with blood, sprinkles blood,
He sprinkles blood over the throne of the court chamber.
The f/gj-drum, the jew- drum, and the ala- tambourine resound!
In the heavens the Holy One appears alone.
My Lady looks in sweet wonder from heaven.
She looks in sweet wonder on all the lands
And on the people of Sumer as numerous as sheep.

THE JOY OF SUMER
The Sacred Marriage Rite
The people of Sumer assemble in the palace,
The house which guides the land.
The king builds a throne for the queen of the palace.
He sits beside her on the throne.
In order to care for the life of all the lands,
The exact first day of the month is closely examined,
And on the day of the disappearance of the moon,
On the day of the sleeping of the moon,
The me are perfectly carried out
So that the New Year's Day, the day of rites,
May be properly determined,
And a sleeping place be set up for Inanna.

He lies down beside her on the bed.
Tenderly he caresses her, murmuring words of love:
"O my holy jewel! O my wondrous Inanna!"
After he enters her holy vulva, causing the queen to rejoice,
After he enters her holy vulva, causing Inanna to rejoice,
Inanna holds him to her and murmurs:
"O Dumuzi, you are truly my love."
108



The king bids the people enter the great hall.
The people bring food offerings and bowls.
They burn juniper resin, perform laving rites,
And pile up sweet-smelling incense.

COMMENTARIES






SUMERIAN HISTORY, CULTURE AND LITERATURE
by Samuel Noah Kramer
History
Sumer, the land inhabited by the ancient Sumerians, is situated in the
southern half of modern Iraq, in the alluvial valleys of the Tigris and Euphrates
rivers, roughly between modern Baghdad and the Persian Gulf, an area of
approximately 10,000 square miles. Its climate is hot and dry, its soil is wind
swept, it has no minerals and very little stone and timber—an unpromising
land seemingly doomed to poverty and desolation. But the Sumerians were
a gifted, energetic, innovative people, technologically inventive and ideologi
cally resourceful, and with the help of irrigation and a relatively pragmatic
view of life and its mysteries, they turned this deprived land into a veritable
Garden of Eden.
It was in Sumer that the first great urban centers came into being, and it
was in these cities that the cuneiform system of writing was developed through
the centuries, to spread all over the ancient Near East—witness most recently
the cuneiform tablets discovered at far-away Ebla in northwest Syria. Sumerian
ideas, techniques, and achievements in the areas of religion, education, litera
ture, and law left a deep impression on their neighbors, and to some extent
even on the culture of modern Western man. In more than one respect, Sumer
may justifiably be designated the "cradle of civilization."
Sumer—or rather, the land that came to be known as Sumer in about
3000 B.C.—was first settled during the fifth millennium B.C., by a people
speaking an unknown language that has left its traces in the names of places
and occupations. Archaeologists now generally designate this people as
Ubaidians, a name derived from Ubaid, an ancient tell, or mound, not far from
the city of Ur, where the first archaeological remains of the people were
uncovered. It was the Ubaidians who established the village settlements that
gradually developed into Sumer's great urban centers: Ur, Eridu, Adab, Isin,
Larsa, Kullab-Uruk, Lagash, Nippur, Kish. The Ubaidians were responsible
for Sumer's earliest cultural advances: they were its first farmers, cattle-raisers,
115



fishermen, weavers, leather workers, woodworkers, smiths, potters, and ma
sons. But the Ubaidians did not long remain the sole and dominant group in
the land. As their settlements prospered and flourished, they were infiltrated
and invaded by Semitic nomads from the Syrian and Arabian desert lands, and
it was these Semites who became the politically dominant group. For according
to later Sumerian tradition, the first dynasty that reigned in Sumer following
the legendary Flood was that of the city of Kish in the north, many of whose
rulers bore Semitic names.
The Sumerians, on the other hand, did not arrive in the land until the
second half of the fourth millennium B.C. The location of their original home
is unknown, but since the Sumerian language is an agglutinative tongue like
that of the Turkic peoples, it seems likely that it may have been somewhere
in south-central Asia. There is also some evidence that on their way to southern
Mesopotamia they may have settled for a time in western Iran. No matter
where the Sumerians came from, and whatever type of culture they brought
with them, this much is certain: their arrival led to an extraordinary ethnic and
cultural fusion with the native population that brought about a major creative
spurt for the history of civilization.
In the course of the centuries that followed, Sumer reached new heights
of political power and economic wealth, and witnessed some of its most
significant achievements in the arts and crafts, in monumental architecture, in
religious and ethical thought, in oral myth, epic, and hymn. The Sumerian
language became the prevailing tongue of the land; the cuneiform system of
writing gradually developed into an effective tool of communication; and the
first steps were taken for the introduction of a formal system of education.
Sumerian political history is dominated by the institution of kingship.
Originally, political power lay in the hands of the free citizens and a city
governor known as the ensi, who was no more than a peer among peers. In
cases of decisions vital to the community, these free citizens met together in
a bicameral assembly consisting of an upper house of "elders" and a lower
house of younger fighting men. As the struggle between the various Sumerian
city-states grew more violent and bitter, and as the pressures from the barbaric
peoples to the east and west intensified, military leadership became an urgent
need, and the king—or as he is known in Sumerian, the lugal, "big man
came to the fore. At first the king was probably selected and appointed by the
assembly at critical moments for specific military tasks. But gradually kingship
with all its privileges and prerogatives became a hereditary institution. The
king established a regular army with the chariot as the main offensive weapon,
and a heavily armed infantry that attacked in phalanx formation. Sumer s
victories and conquests were due largely to its superiority in military weapons,
tactics, organization, and leadership.
116



The first ruler of Sumer whose deeds are recorded, if only in the briefest
kind of statement, is a King of Kish by the name of Etana, who probably
reigned at the very beginning of the third millennium B.C. In the Sumerian
"Kinglist"—a document written centuries later—he is described as the "man
who brought stability to all the lands," and it may thus be inferred that he held
sway not only over Sumer but also over Sumer's neighbors.
In the course of time the power of Kish waned, and it went down to defeat
at the hands of Uruk, a city in central Sumer. Some of the rulers of the Uruk
dynasty, men like Enmerkar, Lugalbanda, Gilgamesh, and perhaps Dumuzi,
performed such prodigious deeds of bravery and conquest that they inspired
the Sumerian bards to compose epic lays characteristic of what is commonly
known as a heroic age, such as that of the Greeks and Teutons much later. But
despite these feats of bravery and heroism, the Uruk dynasty, too, came to a
disastrous end: it was vanquished by Mesannepadda, an ambitious and power
hungry ruler of Ur, a city in southern Sumer that in biblical times came to be
known as Ur of the Chaldees.
The bitter tri-partisan struggle for domination between Kish, Uruk, and
Ur so weakened Sumer and so impaired its military might that for a considera
ble period of time it came under foreign rule. Finally, soon after the beginning
of the second half of the third millennium (about 2350 B.C.), a city in south
eastern Sumer by the name of Lagash, which had played no significant political
role in earlier days, emerged as the dominant power in the land. The Lagash
dynasty lasted less than a century, and is memorable not so much for its
political and military achievements as for its archivists and men of letters, who
produced the first significant contemporary historical and sociological docu
ments in man's recorded history.
In the centuries that followed, Sumer suffered two humiliating defeats.
The first was at the hands of a Semitic ruler by the name of Sargon, who
conquered not only Sumer but most of western Asia. He established his capital
in Agade (biblical Akkad), a city not far from Kish, and Sumer gradually became known by the hyphenated name Sumer-Akkad. Moreover, during the
reign of the Akkad dynasty, the Semitic tongue now generally designated as
Akkadian began to rival Sumerian as the living language of the land. Sargon's grandson Naram-Sin, for some unknown reason, attacked Nip
pur, Sumer's most holy city, and desecrated and plundered its most sacred
shrine. This sacrilegious act, according to the later Sumerian mythographers,
led to Sumer's second catastrophic disaster: it was overrun and desolated by
the Gutians, a barbarous people inhabiting the mountains of western Iran.
Communication by land or sea became impossible throughout Sumer and
famine ravaged the country and its people. Toward the very end of this disastrous, humiliating period in Sumerian
117



history, the city of Lagash once again came to the fore as a political force,
especially under the rule of an extraordinary and pious emi named Gudea. A
considerable number of inscribed statues of this ruler, originally set up in the
temples of Lagash and unearthed by French excavators, have made Gudea's
the Sumerian face best known to the modern world. The source and extent
of his political power are as yet unknown, but his inscriptions indicate that he
had trade contacts in virtually all the known world of the time. He obtained
gold from Anatolia and Egypt, silver from the Taurus, cedars from the
Amanus, copper from the Zagros ranges, diorite from Ethiopia, and timber
from the as yet unidentified land of Dilmun.
Not long after Gudea's reign, Sumer freed itself from the Gutian yoke,
and a king by the name of Ur-Nammu founded a dynasty at the city of Ur,
the so-called Third Dynasty of Ur (approximately 2050-1950 B.C.), that gave
promise of an impressive renaissance. Ur-Nammu was not only a capable and
energetic military leader but also an outstanding social reformer and lawgiver.
He promulgated the first law code in recorded history, a document whose
preamble boasts that he, Ur-Nammu, removed the "chiselers" and grafters
from the land, established and regulated honest weights and measures, and saw
to it "that the orphan did not fall a prey to the wealthy, that the widow did
not fall a prey to the powerful, that the man of one shekel did not fall a prey
to the man of one mina [sixty shekels]."
Ur-Nammu was followed on the throne by his son Shulgi, who turned out
to be one of the most distinguished and illustrious kings of ancient times. He
was an outstanding military leader, a punctilious administrator, an energetic
builder, and a lavish patron of the arts, particularly of literature and music
he claims to have established major Sumerian schools at Nippur and at Ur. The
Sumerian poets and men of letters outdid themselves in composing hymns of
exaltation and glorification in his honor, and these portray him as a combina
tion of sage, soldier, sportsman, diviner, diplomat, patron of learning; a happy,
optimistic king, who provided all good things for the land and its people.
Shulgi reigned for close to half a century. He was followed on the throne
by his two sons, who ruled nine years each, and barely managed to keep the
nation united and independent. When Shulgi's grandson, the pious and trust
ing Ibbi-Sin, came to the throne, he found himself under attack by Elamites
and nomadic Amorites from the west, and betrayed by his own governors and
generals. Finally, in the twenty-fifth year of his reign, the Elamites attacked and
destroyed Ur, carrying off its king into captivity. The catastrophe made an
indelible impression on the poets of Sumer, who over the years composed a
whole series of mournful laments bemoaning the bitter, cruel fate that befell
their land and its people.
In the centuries that followed the fall of Ur there was again a bitter
118



three-cornered struggle for dominance in the land, this time between the cities
of Isin, Larsa, and Babylon. Finally, in about 1750 B.C., Hammurabi, King of
Babylon, defeated Rin-Sin, King of Larsa, and emerged as the sole ruler of
Sumer-Akkad. This date may be said to mark the end of ancient Sumer and
the beginning of Babylonia. By this time the Sumerian people, that is, the
people who spoke the Sumerian language, were virtually extinct, and the
Semites were in full control. The kings were all Semites, and the spoken
language was now the Semitic Akkadian. The culture as a whole, however,
remained predominantly Sumerian in form and content, and the schools and
academies of the land continued to use the Sumerian language and literature
as the basis of their curriculum throughout the millennium.
Culture
Sumerian society was essentially urban in character, though it rested on
an agricultural rather than an industrial base. In the third millennium B.C.
Sumer consisted of a dozen or so city-states, each comprising a large and
usually walled city surrounded by villages and hamlets. According to Sumerian
religious belief, the city belonged to its ruling deity, so the outstanding feature
of each city was the main temple. This largest and tallest building was situated
on a high terrace, which gradually developed into a massive stage tower, or
zi^gurat, Sumer's most memorable contribution to religious architecture. The
temple consisted of a rectangular central shrine, or cella, surrounded on its
long sides by a number of rooms utilized by the priests and priestesses. In the
cella was a niche for the deity's statue, fronted by an altar or offering table
made of brick.
The temple was constructed of unattractive mud bricks, so the Sumerian
architects livened up the walls by adding regularly placed buttresses and
recesses. They also introduced the mud-brick column and half-column, which
they decorated with colored patterns of zigzags, lozenges, and triangles by
inserting thousands of painted clay cones into the mud plaster. Sometimes the
inner walls of the shrine were painted with frescoes of human and animal
figures, as well as a varied assortment of geometric motifs.
Although, in theory, the whole city belonged to the main god, in practice,
the temple corporation owned only some of the land, which it rented out to
sharecroppers. The remainder of the land was the private property of individ
ual citizens: farmers and cattle-breeders, boatmen and fishermen, merchants
and scribes, doctors and architects, masons and carpenters, smiths, jewelers,
and potters. At the very top of the social hierarchy were the nobles: the palace
courtiers and temple administrators, whose families owned large estates
119



tended by clients and slaves. But even some of the poorer citizens managed
to own farms and gardens, houses and cattle. Riches and poverty, success and
failure were, at least to some extent, the result of private enterprise and
individual drive. The more capable and industrious of the farmers, artisans,
and craftsmen sold their products in the town market, receiving payment
either in kind or in "money," which consisted usually of a disk or ring of silver
of standard weight. Traveling merchants carried on a thriving trade from city
to city, as well as with surrounding countries, both overland and by sea, and
many of these tradesmen were private individuals rather than palace or temple
representatives.
The economic and social life of Sumer was characterized by the all
pervading concepts of law and justice. Significant economic and legal reforms
were introduced as early as the twenty-fourth century B.C. by the Lagash ruler
Urukagina. Law codes were promulgated as early as the twenty-first century,
and one of these, the Ur-Nammu law code, has been recovered in part.
Sumerian legal documents have been excavated in large numbers: contracts,
deeds, wills, promissory notes, receipts, and actual court decisions that became
legal precedents. In theory, it was the king who was responsible for the
administration of law and justice; in practice, the city governor or his repre
sentative, the mashkim, attended to the administrative and legal details. Court
cases were usually heard by tribunals of three or four judges. Suits could be
brought either by private parties or by the government. Evidence was taken
in the form of statements from witnesses and experts, or was obtained from
written documents. Oath-taking played a considerable role in court procedure.
Slavery was a recognized institution of Sumerian society. The temples,
palaces, and rich estates owned slaves and exploited them for their own ben
efit. Many slaves were prisoners of war; these were not necessarily foreigners,
but could be Sumerians, from a defeated neighboring city. Slaves were also
recruited in other ways: freemen might be reduced to slavery as punishment
for certain offenses; parents could sell their children as slaves in time of need;
or a man might turn over his entire family to creditors in payment of a debt,
but for no longer than three years.
The slave was the property of his master. He could be branded and
flogged, and was severely punished if he attempted to escape. He did have
certain legal rights, however: he could engage in business, borrow money, and
buy his freedom. If a slave, male or female, married a free person, the children
were free. The sale price of slaves varied with the market and the quality of
the individual for sale. The average price for a grown man was ten shekels,
which at times was less than the price of an ass.
The basic unit of Sumerian society was the family. Marriage was arranged
by the parents. The betrothal was legally recognized as soon as the groom
120



presented a gift to the bride's father, although it was often made binding with
a contract inscribed on a tablet. While marriage was thus reduced to a practical
arrangement, surreptitious premarital lovemaking was by no means unknown.
The woman in Sumer had certain important legal rights: she could hold
property, engage in business, and qualify as a witness. But the husband could
divorce her on relatively light grounds; and if she had borne him no children,
he could take a second wife. Children were under the absolute authority of
their parents, who could disinherit them or even sell them into slavery. But
usually children were loved and cherished; and at the parents' death, they
inherited all property. Adopted children were not uncommon, and these too
were treated with care and consideration—they were a kind of insurance for
old age. It is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of exactness the size
of the population of the Sumerian cities. The number probably varied between
10,000 and 50,000. We know that, except for a few broad boulevards and
public squares, the streets were narrow, winding, quite irregular, with high
blank house-walls on either side. They were unpaved and undrained, and all
traffic was either by foot or donkey. The average Sumerian home was a small
one-story mud-brick structure consisting of several rooms grouped around an
open court. The well-to-do Sumerian, on the other hand, probably lived in a
two-story house of about a dozen rooms, built of brick and plastered and
whitewashed both inside and out. The ground floor consisted of a reception
room, kitchen, lavatory, servants' quarters, and sometimes even a private
chapel. For furniture there were low tables, high-backed chairs, and wooden
framed beds. Household vessels were made of clay, stone, copper, and bronze;
baskets and chests were of reed and wood. Floors and walls were adorned with
reed mats, skin rugs, and woolen hangings.
The family mausoleum was often located below the house, though in early
times there were special cemeteries for the dead outside the city. The Sumeri
ans believed that the souls of the dead traveled to the underworld, and that
life continued there in some way as on earth; they therefore buried with the
dead their pots, tools, weapons, and jewels. Some of the earlier kings even had
their courtiers, servants, and attendants buried with them, as well as their
chariots with the onagers still yoked to them. It is largely from the rich tomb
finds that the modern archaeologist has learned so much about the material
culture of the ancient Sumerians.
In the field of art, the Sumerians were noted for their sculpture, which
in early times (approximately 2600 B.C.) was abstract and impressionistic. The
temple statues of those days show profound emotional and spiritual intensity,
but little skill in modeling. The later sculptors were technically superior, yet
tneir images lacked the original inspiration and vigor. Sumerian craftsmen also
121



manifested considerable skill in carving figures on stelae and plaques, vases
and bowls. It is from Sumerian sculpture and carving that we learn a good deal about
the physical appearance of the Sumerians and their dress. The men were either
clean-shaven or had heavy beards and long hair parted in the middle. They
wore a kind of flounced skin covered sometimes by a long cloak of felt. In later
days, the "chiton" or long shirt took the place of the flounced skin; covering
this shin was a large fringed shawl, which was carried over the left shoulder,
leaving the right arm free. Women wore long dresses that resembled tufted
shawls and covered them from head to foot, leaving only the right shoulder
bare. Their hair was usually parted in the middle and braided into a heavy
"pigtail," which was wound around the head. On important occasions elabo
rate headdresses were worn, consisting of ribbons, beads, and pendants.
One of the most original art contributions of the Sumerians was the
cylinder seal, a small cylindrically shaped stone engraved with a design that
became clear and meaningful when rolled over a clay tablet or the clay sealing
of a container. The earliest cylinder seals are carefully carved gems incised
with such scenes as the king on the battlefield, the shepherd defending his
catde from wild beasts, rows of animals, or hybrid creatures and monsters.
Many of the later seals depicted imaginative mythological scenes, though it is
often difficult to penetrate their meaning. Finally, one particular design be
came predominant: the "presentation" scene, in which a worshipper is being
presented to a deity or a deified king. The cylinder seal became a Sumerian
trademark that penetrated Anatolia, Egypt, Cyprus, and Greece.
Music, both instrumental and vocal, played a great role in Sumerian life,
and some of the musicians became important figures in temple and court.
Beautifully constructed harps and lyres have been excavated in the royal tombs
of Ur. Percussion instruments such as the drum and tambourine were quite
common, as were pipes of both reed and metal. Poetry and song flourished
in the Sumerian schools. Although virtually all the recovered texts are hymns
to gods and kings, there is little doubt that music, song, and dance were a
major source of entertainment both at home and in the marketplace.
Sumerian religious faith and practice were based on a cosmology and
theology evolved by their thinkers and sages in the early third millennium B.C.
that became the basic creed and dogma of the entire Near East. The Sumerians
believed that sea and water surrounded the universe on all sides; they there
fore concluded that a primeval sea had existed from the beginning of time, and
was a kind of "first cause" and "prime mover." In this primeval sea the
universe was engendered, consisting of a vaulted heaven superimposed over
a flat earth and united with it. In between, separating heaven from earth, was
the moving, expanding atmosphere. Out of this airy atmosphere were tash
122



ioned the luminous bodies: the moon, the sun, the planets, and the stars.
Following the separation of heaven and earth and the creation of the astral
bodies, animal and human life came into existence.
This universe, so the Sumerians believed, was under the watchful charge
of a pantheon, consisting of a large group of living beings. Human in form
but superhuman in nature and powers, these beings, although invisible to
mortal eyes, guided and controlled the cosmos in accordance with well-laid
plans and duly prescribed laws. There were gods in charge of heaven, earth,
air, and water; of the sun, the moon, and the planets; of wind, storm, and
tempest; of the rivers, the mountains, and the steppes; of cities and states; of
fields and farms; of the pickax, the brickmold, and the plow.
The leading deities of this pantheon were the four creating gods control
ling the four major components of the universe: the Sky God An; the Earth
Goddess Ki, whose name was changed in the course of time to Ninhursag,
Queen of the Mountain; the Air God Enlil, who gradually became the leader
of the pantheon; and the Water God Enki, who also came to be designated
the God of Wisdom. Among the other more important deities were the Moon
God Nanna; his son, the Sun God Utu; and his daughter Inanna, the Goddess
of the Morning and Evening Star, known to the Semites as Ishtar. There was
also a group of sky gods known as Anunna, some of whom seem to have fallen
from grace and to have been carried off to the underworld.
The power of creation of the four leading deities, according to the
Sumerian theologians, consisted primarily of the divine word. All the creator
had to do was to make his or her plans, utter the word, and pronounce the
name. Moreover, to keep the cosmic entities and cultural phenomena operat
ing continuously and harmoniously without conflict and confusion, they de
vised the me— that set of universal and immutable rules and limits which had
to be observed by god and man alike.
As for man, the Sumerians tended to take a tragic view of his fate and
destiny. They were convinced that man was fashioned from clay and created
for one purpose only: to serve the gods by supplying them with food, drink,
and shelter so that they might have leisure for their divine activities. Life,
according to the sages, was beset with uncertainty and haunted by insecurity.
No one could know the destiny decreed for him by the unpredictable gods.
When a person died, the spirit descended to the dark, dreary nether world,
where "life" was but a dismal reflection of earthly existence.
The Sumerians, according to their own records, cherished goodness and
truth, law and order, freedom and justice, mercy and compassion—and ab
horred their opposites. The gods, too, preferred the ethical and the moral to
the unethical and the immoral. Unfortunately, in their inscrutable fashion,
they had created sin, evil, suffering, and misfortune, and there was little that
123



could be done about it. The proper course for a Sumerian Job to pursue was
not to complain and argue, but to plead, lament, and wail, tearfully confessing
his sins and failings. And since the great gods were far away in the distant sky
and might have more important matters to attend to, the Sumerian theologians
evolved the notion that each individual, or at least each head of a family, had
a special personal god, a kind of good angel, who would hear his prayer and
through whom he would find his salvation.
While private devotion and personal piety were important, it was the
public rites and rituals that played the dominant role in Sumerian religion. The
center of the cult was naturally the temple, with its priests and priestesses, its
musicians and singers, its castrates and hierodules. Here sacrifices were offered
daily to the gods: vegetable and animal foods, and libations of water, beer, and
wine. In addition, there were the New Moon Feast and other less known
monthly celebrations. Most important was the prolonged New Year celebra
tion, culminating in the sacred marriage rite: the marriage ceremony of the
reigning monarch to Inanna, the Goddess of Love and Procreation, which was
believed to ensure the fertility of the soil and the fecundity of the womb.
This royal holy marriage ceremony was but one of a number of more
mystical Sumerian cult practices revolving about the notion of a "dying god"
and his resurrection, which served to explain, at least to some extent, two
disturbing theological inconsistencies. The first concerned the bitter and in
controvertible fact that all vegetable and animal life languished to the point
of death in the hot, parched summer months. This led the theologians to
conclude that the god in charge had "died," that he had been carried off to
the underworld, where he remained during the hot summer months, and that
he did not return to the earth until the autumnal equinox, the time of the
Sumerian New Year, when his sexual reunion with his wife made fields and
farms, steppes and meadows, bloom and blossom once again. The second
inconsistency revolved about the death of the king who had come to be deified
and therefore immortal. This was resolved by identifying the king with the
Vegetation God, whose annual death, resurrection, and reunion with his
spouse were accepted doctrine. Every New Year, therefore, the Sumerians
celebrated with pomp and ceremony, with music and song, the sacred mar
riage between the king as the risen god and the goddess who was his wife.
The origin and evolution of this remarkable fusion of myth and ritual, of
cult and credo, are obscure. There were quite a number of "dying gods" in ancient Sumer; but the best known is Dumuzi, the biblical Tammuz, whom the
women of Jerusalem were still mourning in the days of the prophet Ezekiel.
Originally, the god Dumuzi was a mortal Sumerian ruler, whose life and death
had made a profound impression on the Sumerian thinkers and mythogra
phers. His wife was the ambitious, aggressive Goddess of Love, Inanna, who
124



according to the Sumerian theologians and mythographers had her insensitive,
ungrateful spouse carried off to the underworld but then repented and decided
that he could arise and return to earth every half year. It was this annual
marriage of the king as the resurrected Dumuzi, to the goddess Inanna, that was commemorated and celebrated every New Year in the hieros gamos ritual.
Literature
Probably the most important Sumerian contribution to civilization was
the invention and development of the cuneiform, or wedge-shaped, system of
writing, which was borrowed first by the Akkadians and then by most, if not
all, the surrounding peoples. The script began as a series of pictographic signs,
devised by temple priests and administrators for the purpose of keeping ac
count of the temples' resources and economic activities. In the course of the
centuries, the Sumerian scribes and teachers so modified, molded, and conven
tionalized the script that it altogether lost its pictographic character, becoming
a purely phonetic system of writing in which each sign stood for one or more
syllables.
Clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform by means of a reed stylus have been
excavated by the tens of thousands in the ancient buried cities of Sumer, and
are now located in museums the world over. The vast majority are economic,
legal, and administrative documents. But some five to six thousand tablets and
fragments are inscribed with Sumerian literary works current in the early
second millennium B.C. These reveal the religious beliefs, ethical ideals, and
spiritual aspirations of the Sumerians, and to some extent of the ancient world
as a whole.
Many of the Sumerian literary tablets and fragments were excavated
toward the end of the last century; but they remained largely unpublished and
unavailable to the scholarly world, and it was thus impossible to evaluate the
nature and scope of their contents. In the course of the past fifty years virtually
all the extant Sumerian literary pieces have been published or are in the
process of being published, and quite a number of cuneiformists, young and
old, have devoted much time and labor to their translation and interpretation.
As a result, it is now evident that Sumerian literature comprises some twenty
myths, nine epic tales, more than two hundred hymns of diverse types and
genres, a considerable number of laments and dirges, several legendary his
toriographic documents, and a large, diversified group of "wisdom" texts,
including essays, disputations, proverbs, precepts, and fables.
This vast literature, consisting of more than thirty thousand lines of text,
mostly in poetic form, constitutes the oldest written literature of significant
125



quantity and variety so far uncovered, and its recovery and restoration repre
sent one of the major contributions of our century to the humanities. Not only
is the material of immense value for its own sake, as the creative product of
the Sumerian imagination, but it is also proving to be a rich treasure of prime
sources for the historian of literature and religion, the biblical and classical
scholar, the anthropologist and sociologist. Moreover, there is reasonable
hope that this ancient treasure will be enlarged and enriched in future days.
The literary compositions uncovered to date are but a fraction of those that
existed in Sumer. Many a text is still lying buried in the tells of southern Iraq,
awaiting the lucky spade of the future excavator.
Sumer, its rise and fall, provides the historian with the most ancient
example of the poignant irony inherent in man's fate. As the Sumerian literary
documents make amply manifest, it was the competitive drive for superiority
and preeminence, for victory, prestige, and glory, that provided the psycho
logical motivation sparking the material and cultural advances for which thei
Sumerians are justifiably noted: large-scale irrigation, technological invention,,
monumental architecture, writing, education, and literature. Sad to say, this I
very passion for competition and success carried within it the seed of destruc-;
tion and decay.
In the course of the centuries, Sumer became a "sick society" with deplor
able failings and distressing shortcomings: it yearned for peace and was con
stantly at war; it professed such ideals as justice, equity, and compassion, but]
abounded in injustice, inequality, and oppression; materialistic and short-,
sighted, it unbalanced the ecology essential to its economy; it was afflicted by,
a generation gap between parents and children, and between teachers and
students. And so Sumer came to a cruel, tragic end, as one melancholy
Sumerian bard bitterly laments: Law and order ceased to exist; cities, houses,
stalls, and sheepfolds were destroyed; rivers and canals flowed with bitter
waters; fields and steppes grew nothing but weeds and "wailing plants." The
mother cared not for her children, nor the father for his spouse, and nurse
maids chanted no lullabies at the crib. No one trod the highways and the roads;
the cities were ravaged and their people were killed by the mace or died of
famine. Finally, over the land fell a calamity "undescribable and unknown to man."

THE DISCOVERY AND
DECIPHERMENT OF
"THE DESCENT OF INANNA"
by Samuel Noah Kramer
'The Descent of Inanna"—a myth in whose recovery and restoration I
played a key role—consists of more than four hundred lines of text in almost
perfect condition that were pieced together from thirty tablets and fragments
as a result of contributions by numerous scholars, dead and alive, young and
old. The process of scholarly cooperation that began more than a century ago
is only now bearing fruit.
The majority of the tablets and fragments on which "The Descent" was
inscribed by the ancient mythographers sometime around 1750 B.C. lay buried
and forgotten for close to four thousand years in the ruins of Nippur, Sumer's
spiritual and cultural center. There they were discovered and excavated in the
course of four grueling campaigns conducted by a University of Pennsylvania
expedition between the years 1889 and 1900, the first American institution
to excavate in the Near East.
But the excavation of the tablets and fragments was only the initial step
in the process of recovering "The Descent." Once excavated, they had to be
read—at least in a tentative, preliminary way—by some cuneiformist, and
identified as belonging to the myth. After identification, the various texts
inscribed on the individual pieces, which often duplicate and overlap each
other, had to be pieced together and dovetailed into a connected text that was
uniform and consistent. Then, finally, came the difficult and at times heart
breaking task of translation and interpretation.
Moreover, in the case of the Nippur tablets there was an added and rather
burdensome complication: upon excavation, these tablets were divided be
tween two museums thousands of miles apart. Not infrequently the breaks and
gaps on the tablets of one of the museums could not be filled and restored
without the relevant pieces in the other. Which brings us to the rather unusual
and felicitous "tale of two museums": the long-lasting, uninterrupted scholarly
cooperation between the Istanbul Museum of the Ancient Orient by the

piecing together the tablets and fragments utilized in the reconstruction and decip er ment of "The Descent."

Bosphorus and the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania by
the Schuylkill. In the years 1889-1900 when the Nippur excavations took place, modern
Iraq, whose southern half corresponds to ancient Sumer, was part of the
Turkish empire. All the archaeological finds at Nippur—it was agreed be
tween the American excavators and the Turkish officials—were to be divided
into approximately equal halves, one half going to Istanbul, which was then
the capital of the Turkish empire, while the other half became the property
of the University of Pennsylvania, which had sponsored the expedition. At the
time of the excavations, therefore, the thousands of clay tablets emerging from
the ground, no matter what their condition (and the majority were quite
fragmentary) were boxed, crated, and transported either to Philadelphia,
where they were placed in the newly founded University Museum, or to
Istanbul, where they were housed in the newly established Museum of the
Ancient Orient.
It was only in later years that scholars began to study and identify the
contents of these boxes, and it was not until 1914 that the first five pieces,
inscribed with "The Descent of Inanna," were published. Two of these were
in Istanbul. They were copied by Stephen Langdon, an enthusiastic, energetic,
but rather careless scholar, and published in his book Historical and Religious
Texts from the Temple Library of Nippur. The other three were in Philadelphia;
they were superbly autographed by Arno Poebel and published in his Historical
and Grammatical Texts.
But although five pieces inscribed with portions of "The Descent" were
now available, their contents remained quite obscure and unintelligible, due
primarily to the fragmentary nature of the tablets and the numerous breaks in
text. Moreover, each of these pieces contained only a small part of the myth
and it was impossible to make reasonably trustworthy connected sense of their
contents. It was not until 1937, almost a quarter of a century after their
publication, that the first half of "The Descent" could be reconstructed—at
least partially. And although I prepared and published the relevant study in
the French journal Revue d'assyriologie et d'archeologie orientale under the title
"Inanna's Descent to the Nether World: The Sumerian Version of Ishtar's
Descent," much of the credit belongs to Edward Chiera, one of the leading
cuneiformists of his day.
Chiera during most of the 1920s was a member of the Oriental Depart
ment of the University of Pennsylvania; he dedicated much of his time and
labor to studying, identifying and copying the Nippur literary documents. In
!923, he traveled as Crozer Fellow to Istanbul, where he copied fifty of the documents in the Museum of the Ancient Orient. These were published the
very next year in his book Sumerian Religious Texts. Upon his return to Philadel
129



phia, he spent the next three years copying close to three hundred Sumerian
literary pieces from the Nippur collection of the University Museum. Before
he could prepare them for actual printing and publication, however, he was
invited by the eminent Egyptologist and historian Henry Breasted, then direc
tor of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, to become editor-in
chief of its invaluable Assyrian Dictionary project.
In 1927, Chiera left Philadelphia for his new post in Chicago, carrying
with him his precious copies, which the Oriental Institute undertook to publish
in two volumes whenever he had prepared the introductions and plate ar
rangements. Unfortunately, he died suddenly and unexpectedly before he was
able to complete the work. His copies, together with the relevant notes and
comments, now orphaned and stranded, were turned over to me to edit for
publication. 1
Chiera's copies of the Nippur literary tablets in the University Museum
included three that belonged to "Inanna's Descent" and helped to fill a good
many of the gaps and breaks in its first hundred lines. But more important still,
while studying and identifying the Nippur literary tablets in the University
Museum, Chiera found a large fragment consisting of the lower half of a
four-column tablet whose upper half had been first copied and published by
Stephen Langdon in 1914. Evidently the tablet had been broken in two, either
in ancient times or during the excavations, and the upper part had come to
Istanbul while the lower part found its way to Philadelphia. It was Chiera's
long-distance joining of this four-column tablet (two on the obverse and two
on the reverse) that made it possible for me to place all the other published
pieces in their proper order, and so reconstruct the text of close to three
hundred lines, even though many of these were still full of crucial breaks and
gaps.
The second significant publication of "The Descent" appeared in 1942,
in the Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. 2 In the years 1937-39,
after leaving the Oriental Institute, I traveled to Istanbul as a Guggenheim
Fellow and copied more than 150 tablets and fragments from the Nippur
*I had come to the Oriental Institute in 1932 as a research assistant on the Assyrian Dictionary project. There I met Arno Poebel, who by that time had become one of the world's leading
Sumerologists—his Sumerian grammar, Grundziige der Sumeriscben Gramma tik. which appeared in 1923, was gradually being recognized as a fundamental contribution to Sumerian research.
During my stay at the Oriental Institute I sat at his feet and drank in his words, and so came to
be known as a promising young Sumerologist capable of preparing Chiera's posthumous volumes for publication. It was in the course of trying to understand the contents of Chiera's copies of the
Nippur literary texts, which were published in 1934 by the Oriental Institute in two volumes
entitled Sumerian Epics and Myths and Sumerian Texts of Varied Content, that I became "hooked
on Sumerian literature. I have since traveled from museum to museum year after year for the past
forty years, seeing to it that the thousands of Sumerian literary tablets and fragments were made available to the scholarly world in one form or another.

collection of the Museum of the Ancient Orient, among which were three that
belonged to "Inanna's Descent." On my return to Philadelphia, I became a
research associate in the Mesopotamian Section of the University Museum,
and with the help of a number of grants from the American Philosophical
Society began to study and catalogue all the literary tablets of its Nippur
collection. In the course of this work, I identified and copied two more tablets
belonging to "The Descent." This enabled me to prepare a revised version
of approximately the first two thirds of the myth, ending with the passage
depicting the goddess's ascending from the nether world accompanied by the
bogies and harpies who had their home there. As I noted in that study: "Here
all the extant source materials for 'Inanna's Descent to the Nether World'
unfortunately break off. But this is not the end of the myth. It is not too much
to hope that some day in the not too distant future, the pieces on which the
conclusion of the story is inscribed will be discovered and deciphered."
The hope was at least partially realized in my next major publication,
which appeared in the 1951 Journal of Cuneiform Studies ,
3 entitled "Inanna's
Descent to the Nether World: Continued and Revised." This study brought
to light two new pieces inscribed with portions of the myth. One was a small
fragment from the Nippur Collection of the Museum of the Ancient Orient,
which I had copied in 1946 when I traveled to Istanbul as the annual professor
of the American Schools of Oriental Studies. The other, far more important
piece was an excellently preserved tablet in the Yale Babylonian Collection,
inscribed with ninety-two lines of text, the last thirty of which contained an
entirely new passage that carried on the story from where it had broken off
in the previously known texts.
This Yale tablet had been bought decades earlier from an antique dealer,
and its provenance is therefore unknown; but it may well have been Nippur.
It was identified by me as belonging to "Inanna's Descent" while I was helping
to catalogue the Sumerian literary tablets in the Yale Babylonian Collection.
The new material in this tablet brought the story of the myth to the point
where Inanna handed over her insensitive husband Dumuzi to the galla of the
underworld—a tragic decision that caused Dumuzi to turn pale and plead with
the Sun God Utu to transform him into a snake so that he might escape the
demons. There the text broke off, leaving us ignorant of Utu's response and
of Dumuzi's ultimate fate. The missing denouement of the plot was recovered in part with "Cunei
form Studies and the History of Literature," which appeared in 1963 in the
Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society. 4 The tablets that came to the

rescue this time were not those excavated at Nippur but at Ur, the biblical Ur
of the Chaldees. Here Leonard Woolley had conducted a joint British Mu
seum-University Museum expedition between the years 1923 and 1933, and
among the thousands of tablets he excavated were four that belonged to
"Inanna's Descent." They were copied in turn by the late Cyril Gadd and
published in the sixth volume of Ur Excavation Texts (written joindy by Gadd
and myself).
One of these Ur tablets consisted of a telescopic version of "Inanna's
Descent" that provided us with Utu's favorable response to Dumuzi's plea: he
transformed Dumuzi into a snake and thus enabled him to escape the demons.
Of the other three tablets, two duplicated material already known but added
some significant variants.
The third—the upper part of an unusually wide tablet—proved to be of
the utmost importance. The obverse duplicated material long known; but the
reverse provided the hitherto missing end of the myth. It began with Inanna's
blessing of a fly that seemed to have informed her of Dumuzi 's whereabouts
after his escape from the galla, and concluded with her decree that Dumuzi
must stay in the underworld only half the year and that his sister Geshtinanna
would take his place for the other half. Still missing were approximately twenty
lines of text depicting the events that took place between Dumuzi's escape
from the demons and Inanna's Solomon-like verdict.
The publication of my 1963 study in the Proceedings of the American Philo
sophical Society marked the fourth major revision of "Inanna's Descent," whose
text had been recovered and reconstructed gradually over a period of fifty
years. It was high time that a new, complete variorum edition of the myth be
compiled, together with a translation and interpretation that would include the
relevant contributions of such eminent cuneiformists as Thorkild Jacobsen,
Adam Falkenstein, and Benno Landsberger. This very useful task was per
formed ably and competendy in 1974 by William R. Sladek in his "Disserta
tion submitted to the Johns Hopkins University in conformity with the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy," prepared under the
expert guidance of his teacher, Jerrold S. Cooper, and of Ake Sjoberg, my
successor as curator of the Tablet Collection at the University Museum.
Which brings us to the Jayne Lecture delivered by me in 1979 at the
November meeting of the American Philosophical Society. 5 The lecture is endtled "Sumerian Literature and the British Museum: The Promise of the
Future," and a large part of it is devoted to the Ur tablet whose upper third
had been copied by Cyril Gadd and published in the sixth volume of the I r
Excavation Texts. The obverse of this fragment duplicated material already

134



known, but its reverse, as we have seen, provided us with the very end of the
myth: it related that Inanna, moved by Dumuzi's tears, had decided to allow
him to leave the underworld every half year, and to have his place taken by
his loving, self-sacrificing sister Geshtinanna. All that was missing, therefore,
was the approximately twenty-line passage immediately before this, depicting
the events that befell Dumuzi after he had eluded the galla with Utu's help.
It seemed not unreasonable to hope that, once the lower two thirds of the
tablet were located, this missing passage would be recovered, and the text of
"The Descent" would be virtually complete.
Sad to say, it did not turn out that way. Several years ago, the missing part
of the Ur tablet was found in one of the cupboards of the British Museum,
and joined to the part copied by Gadd. But as the photographs of the now
almost complete tablet show, only the obverse of the new piece is fairly well
preserved, and its text duplicates the lines of the myth already known from
other sources. The reverse, which contained the missing passage, is very
poorly preserved, and is of no help in restoring the text of approximately
twenty lines. It may be surmised, of course, that these lines depicted such
events as the final seizure of Dumuzi by the galla; the bitter lamentation of his
despairing sister, Geshtinanna; and the appearance on the scene of the clever,
knowing fly who informed the goddesses of Dumuzi's whereabouts. But none
of this is certain, and our knowledge of what actually took place must await
the future discovery of some duplicating tablet.

INTERPRETATIONS OF
INANNA'S STORIES AND HYMNS
by Diane Wolkstein
Introduction
In the first three lines of "The Huluppu-Tree" we meet the predominant
stylistic feature of the Cycle of Inanna: repetition. Words are repeated, sen
tence structure is repeated; and by this slow, studied, almost hypnotic repeti
tion we are transported into another realm— the timeless realm of the gods,
the soul, and the origins of life.
All the Sumerian tales in this collection are connected to a religious
foundation about which, except for the stories and hymns, we unfortunately
have very little factual information. Nevertheless, we need to approach these
stories as sacred narratives, spiritual explorations of the place of the gods and
the human psyche in the universe. In all the stories there is a focusing on such
spiritual concepts as rule, destiny, and the me (the sacred culture of Sumer).
Much like the sculpture of the time, the Sumerian stories have a stark, raw,
wide-eyed quality, as if the poet were attempting to pierce through conven
tions into the very essences of life in order to see "what is," to understand what
it is all made of, how, and why.
Unfortunately, the Sumerian priest no longer exists to explain ambiguous
terminology or explicate ritual and symbols. In addition, we do not even know
at what period the stories were created; they could have been created any time
between 1900 B.C. and 3500, or even further back. Yet despite, or most likely
because of their sacred roots, the stories continue to have a compelling hold
on us. When I have told them, the responses from the audience have been
striking: "I felt as I did the first time I stepped into the cathedral at Chartres,"
or, "It was like going behind a mirror." And in the telling—especially in the
moments of repetition such as the second or third time Inanna's story is told in "The Huluppu-Tree" or during the seven disrobings in "The Descent of
Inanna"—I, too, have felt the strange opening-up quality of these stories, as
if I were falling out of the storyteller-audience framework into a deeper, more
eternal soul-place.
These commentaries have been written in response to the many questions
of listeners: "Who is the /4wzw-bird?" "Why did Inanna go to the under
136



world?" "Why did she sentence her husband to death?" My thoughts are in
n0 way definitive, but rather responses to working with the material. I had to
speak back. I did so, first by trying to take into consideration the Sumerian
context for the symbols, both in their literary and cultural aspects, and then
by relying on hunch, speculation, and a storyteller's intuition.
The Huluppu- Tree
In the first days, in the very first days,
In the first nights, in the very first nights,
In the first years, in the very first years . . .
"The Huluppu-Tree" is one of the world's first recorded tales of gene
sis. Such a claim however, ought not to lead us to consider first to mean
"primitive" or unformed. The art and thinking of the Sumerians and Ak
kadians had an enormous breadth, sophistication, and variety in its represen
tation of the universe. The Sumerian sculptor, who wished to exalt in the
very tangible delights of love, could realistically portray a woman and man
embracing (See Lovers Embracing on the Bed, page 43). The Sumerian artist,
who was searching to represent the frightening, impenetrable, and imprison
ing aspects of the snake, could choose to draw his subject in a decorative,
schematic manner (see Snake with Interlacing Coil, page 7). Similarly, the
Sumerian poet, who was investigating in "the Huluppu -Tree'" the moment of
beginnings, 1 was able to create a structure which would evoke the nature of
growth.
In order to penetrate the closely woven fabric of the Sumerian poet, I
have approached the story from three viewpoints: that of the story's poetics,
its character development, and its thematic material.
In Sumerian there is no rhyme. However, the intricate patterns of similar
and alternating sounds of vowels and consonants and the similar and alternat
ing verb and noun endings give the language a musical resonance. 2 Unfortu
nately, the richness of the sound play in Sumerian is not available to the
non-Sumerian reader; nevertheless, we can begin to unlock this mysterious
'See Mircea Eliade's Myth and Reality (Harper&Row, 1963), for a discussion of "first times"
and "beginnings."

tale by examining it from another aspect of poetics. As Adele Berlin has
explained: "The different ordering of parallel clauses within a multi-clause
stanza produces many patterns ... it is here . . . that the modern reader will
find the beauty and intricacy of Sumerian poetry." 3
The story begins with a progressive three-part parallelism:
In the first days, in the very first days,
In the first nights, in the very first nights,
In the first years, in the very first years . . .
The repetition of "days" is then picked up in the fourth and fifth lines, linking
them to the previous lines, yet presenting new material in a new, balancing
parallelism. This balancing parallelism has the same subject:
In the first days when everything needed was brought into being,
In the first days when everything needed was properly nourished . . .
The same subject-balancing parallelism is continued in the sixth and sev
enth lines:
When bread was baked in the shrines of the land, And bread was tasted in the homes of the land . . .
When, in the eighth and ninth lines, the balancing parallelism switches from
the subject to the verb,
When heaven had moved away from earth When earth had separated from heaven . . .
we have the reassuring sense of the growth of one thing into the other. We
understand the natural order of things: one thing follows another, one thing
flows out of another, until a third line is added to the balancing parallelism that
contradicts the previous couplet both in subject and verb:
And the name of man was fixed.
Previously, the story of creation had been a developing natural process:
existence was set into time (lines 1-3); life's vital aspects were brought forth
and nourished (lines 4-7); the oneness of the world was divided (lines 8-9).
But with the tenth line, And the name of man was fixed, consciousness—artifice,
effort, intention—begins.
With the act of naming that which is in flux, what is in movement becomes
shaped and what is inside becomes manifest. To give a name is to bring into
existence and recognition. In Indian mythology, Brahma created apparitions
5 Adele Berlin, Enmerkar and Ensuhkesdanna. Philadelphia: The University Museum, 19 7 9, p. 15.
138



from his unconscious; then the world guardian, Daksha, gave the apparitions
names so that they might be known and their functions assigned to them. In
Sumerian mu-lugal means "man's name" and also "life-giving properties." To
give a name to something is to bring it into a second (and conscious) existence.
The sentence, And the name of man was fixed, which occurs as the disruptive
third part of a parallelism (consciousness always being a jarring and disturbing
event), is also the tenth line in the larger story of creation and represents a
new order: the conscious order of creation.
Lines 1 1 and 12 take up the previous repetitive verb-balancing parallelism
of lines 8 and 9, suggesting a restoration of the process of creation. And now
since man has been named, the gods, too, are named:
When ... An had carried off the heavens,
And . . . Enlil had carried off the earth . . .
However, the third line of the parallelism, with its new subject and contrasting
verb, once again arrests the action of the story and throws the spotlight onto
the meaning of the thirteenth line:
When . . . Ereshkigal, was given the underworld for her domain
As in so many world mythologies, 13 is the number of death. It is the
unlucky, fateful number. In lines 1 1 and 12, the two male gods, An and Enlil,
actively take over their realms; but in line 13, the female goddess, Ereshkigal,
receives her domain and her fate. And that which is assigned to Ereshkigal,
the House of Death, of Darkness, of Decay, of Dust, is the same realm that
awaits all of humankind. The flow of creation is brought to a halt, for though
man's name has been "fixed," what purpose is there in life and awareness if
it is all to be undone in the House of Decay? Who will attempt to understand
death and thus to find meaning in life?
The answer to the question raised in the first section is given as the Wise
One, Father Enki, the God of Wisdom, enters the story at the beginning of
the second section. The progressive three-part parallelism is repeated; but this
time, the action is accomplished in two rather than three lines:
He set sail; the Father set sail,
Enki, the God of Wisdom, set sail for the underworld.
The father who journeys to the underworld can be appreciated in two
ways: metaphysically, as the "God of Wisdom," and sexually, as the God of
the Waters (water also means "semen" in Sumerian). As God of Wisdom, Enki takes up humanity's quest to confront the Unknown. Like other shamanic
figures who voyage to the underworld, Enki is assaulted by stones and animal
spirits. He is battered and bruised by the underworld, which is possessive of
139



its realm; but he does not turn back. The battle between conscious and uncon
scious forces rages. As God of the Waters, Enki sets sail into the underworld
penetrating Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld, who reacts by storm
ing, throwing up stones, devouring, and roaring.
The suspense of the struggle between male and female, conscious and
unconscious, is achieved grammatically by setting up one balancing parallelism
after another. The entire second section is made up of parallel couplets.
Whereas in the first section the balancing parallelism flows from subject to
verb, here there is no varying of the balancing-subject parallelism, nor is there
a movement into a three-part contrary or synthetic parallelism. The repetition
of parallelisms stresses the confrontation: the two powers are equal. No resolu
tion occurs until the third section, where the answer is given in the form of
a synthesis. From the encounter between the God of Wisdom and the Queen
of the Underworld, a tree comes into existence.
The third section repeats the progressive three-part parallelism of the first
and second sections, but now as time is speeded up, the parallelism is con
tracted into the space of one line:
At that time, a tree, a single tree, a huluppu- tree . . .
When the third section begins, we have come through time, encountered the
gods, and have arrived, with the planting of the seed, on earth. Soon Inanna
enters and the plot can begin.
The dynamic contrapuntal rhythms of the structure continue throughout
the story, creating a pulsating web of time. Each section both echoes and
responds to the previous section. Only at the end of the first part of "The
Huluppu-Tree," when there is a resolution to Inanna's dilemma, do the vary
ing two- and three-pan parallelisms give way to a new, four-part parallelism:
From the trunk of the tree he carved a throne for his holy sister. From the trunk of the tree Gilgamesh carved a bed for Inanna.
From the roots of the tree she fashioned a pukku for her brother. From the crown of the tree Inanna fashioned a mikku for Gilgamesh, the hero of Uruk.
The exchange between male and female, between the goddess, Inanna,
and the mortal, Gilgamesh, causes a resolution and a respite to the previous
regular/irregular pace of the story. Moreover, the number four, connected to
the four directions, the square, gives a sense of grounding and completion.
A second approach to the understanding of The Hm //</>/>//- Tree'* is through
its characters. Enki and Ereshkigal battle in the prelude; the plot begins with
the buluppu-iree and Inanna.
The buluppu- tree sprouts by the Euphrates River, but soon it is struck b\
140



the South Wind and forced into the waters. If it had not been for Inanna, the
tree in its untended state of nature might have perished. Inanna rescues the
tree from the waters and brings it to a place of cultivation.
Only after Inanna has cared for the tree for a period of time in the
enclosure of her garden do her wishes connected with it emerge. Just as in the
first section,
In the first days when everything needed was brought into being, In the first days when everything needed was properly nourished,
life must be properly nourished and cared for before it can take root and begin
to be differentiated. From the growing tree Inanna wishes to have a shining
throne and a bed.
However, in conflict with these wishes, the first fact we are told about
Inanna is that she fears the "word" of An and Enlil. An, the Sky God, and Enlil,
the Air God, are Sumer's lawgivers and ordainers who direct the fates of those
in heaven and on earth. As Jacobsen has noted, "A command of An and Enlil is not known ever to be changed." 4 The "word" or fate awaiting the young
woman Inanna is that which she wishes and also that which she fears: her throne and bed, her queenship and womanhood.
Inanna's sexual fears and wishes, which are those of all adolescents, are
further amplified in the history of the relations of the gods in Inanna's family
tree. (See Inanna's Family Tree, pp. x-xi.)On her mother's side there was a
sense of warmth and relatedness; on her father's side, a more forced, con
trolled and controlling sense of relationship. Inanna's great-grandfather An,
the Sky God, had mated with her great-grandmother Ki (or Urash), the Earth
Goddess. Ki had given birth to trees, reeds, vegetation, and Enlil. The imperi
ous Enlil had raped the young woman Ninlil (forcing open her too small
vagina) and Nanna, the Moon God, Inanna's father, was born. Through the
goddess Nammu, of the Watery Deep, An had also fathered Enki, the God
of Flowing Water and Wisdom. Enki had mated with Ningikuga, the Reed
Goddess, and Inanna's mother, Ningal, was born. Nanna fell in love with
Ningal and she with him. It was from this joyful impetuous union that Inanna,
the Morning and Evening Star, and Utu, the Sun God, were born. Inanna is
thus descended from a grandmother who was raped and a grandmother and
mother who were loved. But now Inanna, who was born of divine parents, has descended to earth
and waits as a "young woman" for her throne and bed. Inanna waits; but her
tree does not come into the fruition she wishes. Instead it becomes the habitat
of Inanna's unacknowledged, unexpressed fears and desires.
The snake, because it sloughs off its own skin, has long been connected

with rebirth. In the Akkadian The Epic ofGilgamesb, contemporary to the Cycle
of Inanna, the snake steals the "flower of rebirth" from the unmindful Gil
gamesh. Both because of its regenerative aspect and its phallic likeness, the
appearance of the snake suggests rebirth and sexuality. Moreover, the text
states that the snake "could not be charmed." Inanna will not be able to
appease, tame, or disregard it. The snake is immune to the laws of the land. The Anzubird was known to the Sumerians from the story of "Ninurta
Turtle," 5 in which the Anzu bird unsuccessfully attempts to steal the me, the
attributes of civilization and knowledge, from Enki, the God of Wisdom. The
mature Anzu bird, depicted in Sumerian art with the great wings of an eagle
and the face of a lion (see page 8), craves power and knowledge.
Lilith does not appear in any other Sumerian texts. To understand her
nature, we need to consider various later texts. In Hebrew legend, she was the
first bride of Adam; but insisting on her own equality, she refused to copulate
with him, for she did not want to be underneath him. She fled from Adam and
remained forever outside human relationship or regulation, possessed by an
avid, insatiable sexuality. She was cursed by the daily death of a hundred of
her demon children, for which she takes continual revenge by stealing, injur
ing, or killing human infants. 6 In Zoharic texts, she has dominion over all
instinctual, natural beings, over "every living creature that creepeth." Lilith
forms with the An zu- bird and the snake a triad of sexual, lawless creatures who
live outside the bounds of the Sumerian community and seek power only for
themselves. These are Inanna's unexpressed fears and desires, which have now been "named."
Inanna had wanted a throne and bed. She had wanted the end result
her rule and womanhood. Yet the snake, the bird, and Lilith are essential to
Inanna's achieving her wishes, for they give her fears an external form so that
she can begin to see them. The three creatures embody the primitive, grasping,
human aspects Inanna must recognize and let go of if she is to be deserving
of the gifts of "the throne" and "the bed."
Inanna dissolves into tears at the realization of her own dark solipsistic
cravings:
The young woman who loved to laugh wept. How Inanna wept!
But weeping has little effect on the creatures who will not be tamed.
After intense and repetitive weeping, Inanna's own resistances weaken,
and she is prepared to move to another state of awareness. At dawn, with the

renewal of light and consciousness, she asks for help, not from her father or
mother, but from her own peer group. Her divine brother, Utu, the Sun God,
refuses her. Her earthly brother, Gilgamesh 7 the hero of Uruk, who functions
in this story as the son of Enki, the God of Wisdom—responds to Inanna's
plea. 8 Gilgamesh enters Inanna's garden and by using the bronze ax, a cutting
weapon of civilization, he defeats the untamable snake. With the death of the
snake, Inanna becomes joined to Gilgamesh, who has entered her garden and
released her from her fears. The bond which is formed between the solitary
Inanna and the hero-king of Uruk also extends to those who have aided the
king, the people of Sumer. As a sign of their new relationship, Gilgamesh and
Inanna exchange gifts.
Inanna gives Gilgamesh a pukku and a mikku. 9 We read in the second part
of "The Huluppu-Tree" (not published here) 10 that Gilgamesh loses his gifts.
He does not yet have sufficient consciousness to use them wisely. His vain
glorious use of the pukku brings bitterness, lamentation, and tears to the
mothers, sisters, and young maidens of Uruk, so that the wet earth opens and
the pukku and mikku are lost in the underworld. In "The Huluppu-Tree" Gilgamesh is the brazen young hero, full of his
manliness and the signs of his physical strength—his heavy ax, which weighs
450 pounds, and his great armor, which weighs 60 pounds. But he also acts
in the role of a hero-king. He defeats lawless nature (Lilith and the beasts) by
performing the same civilizing tasks as King Gilgamesh performs, when (in
The Epic of Gilgamesh ) he enters Ishtar's cedar forest, kills the monster Hum
baba and then fells the trees. Although Gilgamesh has not come into his full development in "The
Huluppu-Tree," he is nevertheless Inanna's initiator, for he brings courage,
decisiveness, and strength to Inanna in her moment of weakness. With her
consent, he rids the young woman of her "creatures of the wilderness."
Inanna brought the huluppu- tree from its free-floating state in the wilder
ness into the enclosure of her garden. But without the will of the hero-king
Gilgamesh, the tree can not bear "the fruit" Inanna wishes for. In order to
7 Gilgamesh was said to be two-thirds god and one-third human. In the stories he is mortal and acts in a human manner. From the Family Tree it can be seen that he is of the same generation as Inanna, suggesting a brother-sister kinship relationship.
8Gilgamesh was considered an avatar of Dumuzi, the son of Enki. As one who is linked to Enki, Gilgamesh, in the second part of the story, parallels Enki's role in the first part of the story,
by coming to the rescue of the conscious part of Inanna against the forces of the snake or the underworld.
9Sumerologists have not yerbeen able to translate the meaning of either pukku or mikku. One
Possible explanation is that they are emblems of kingship such as a rod or ring. See page
9 in text for illustration. . u .

produce a throne and bed, a green tree must be changed into a hewn tree. 11
Inanna, Gilgamesh, and the tree are all in their formative stages. Because of
its lawless, uncivilizable occupants, the tree—changed from benign to malevo
lent—must therefore be destroyed. It is with the conscious consent of Inanna
and Gilgamesh that the tree is uprooted a third time. It is then brought by
Gilgamesh and his companions from the garden into the city and civilization,
where it bears "reciprocal gifts" for all of Sumer.
Both Inanna and Gilgamesh are enriched by the death and transformation
of the tree. Inanna is now prepared to be a woman, and Gilgamesh has proven
his manliness. Although they do not become united, Gilgamesh, by entering
Inanna's garden is drawn closer to his feminine side. Inanna, provided with
a shining bed, awaits her consort; and prepared with a throne, she is ready to
act on her own.
A third approach to the story is through the major themes. The huluppu -tree,
created at the beginning of the story, reflects the reality and struggle of the
gods as well as Inanna's own psychic reality. The tree embodies the dual forces
of the universe: Enki and Ereshkigal, consciousness and unconsciousness, light
and darkness, male and female, and the power of life and the power of death.
The Sumerian pictograph for plant displays the complexity of the
synthesis wonderfully. The two sets of four lines cross each other at right
angles, forming a mesh, which is a third new entity, yet maintains the equal
identities of the opposing forces.
The image of the tree as the synthesis of these numinous powers is also
effectively seen in outer reality, for the tree grows from the darkness and
underworld into the light and consciousness. It is anchored in the underworld
and grows toward the heavens. The tree is a part of the three kingdoms: the
underworld of Ereshkigal, the earth of Enlil, and the heavens of An. The
wonder of the tree continues to exist today, for although we still cannot explain
the mystery of the first seed, we can take the seed in our hand and say, here
is the beginning of life. It will emerge from the underworld, strive toward the
heavens, and die back into the underworld, from which one of its descendants will emerge.
The Hebrew story of creation parallels the Sumerian account of "The
Huluppu-Tiee" in many ways. In Genesis, on the first day God created time,
on the second day the heavens, and on the third day the earth, "which brought
forth grass, the herb-yielding seed, and the fruit-tree-yielding fruit after his
Il See David Bynum's The Daemon in the Wood (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 19^ for a discussion of the life-giving/life-withdrawing aspects of the green tree and the reciprocal, cultural aspects of the dry or hewn tree.
144



kind, whose seed is in itself." For both cultures the tree represents the first
living thing on earth. The tree also provides for both cultures a configuration of the forces of
life and death and consciousness and lack of knowledge. It may be that the
powers of the biblical trees in the center of the Garden of Eden, the Tree of
Life and the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, are based on the joined
powers of the Sumerian huluppu- tree. In any case, the biblical Tree of Knowl
edge contains great powers, for God warns Adam not to eat of its fruit or he
will die. When Adam and Eve both disobey ("The woman saw that the tree
[was] desired to make one wise"), they discover their own nakedness and
sexuality and lose their opportunity for immortality. Yet they gain a knowl
edge of good and evil. They are then expelled from the Garden of Eden. But
they do not go completely unprepared, for they go with their newly acquired
consciousness. Contact with the tree, which has within itself its own means of
regeneration, gives the partakers a chance also to be reborn, if not physically,
then in stages of understanding.
When Inanna plants the huluppu- tree in her garden, she brings the forces
of Ereshkigal and Enki into her protected retreat. The living tree, which
mirrors the larger world as well as Inanna's interior world, is inhabited by
creatures who each strive toward rebirth alone. Yet for Inanna, at this mo
ment, rebirth by herself is not possible. Just as Eve shared the fruit of the Tree
of Knowledge with Adam and "the eyes of both were opened," the young
Inanna, also, appeals to her brothers—first Utu, then Gilgamesh.
By the time Gilgamesh enters Inanna's garden, both Inanna and we are
ready for Inanna's awakening. We have lived through the story of the creating
and the undoing of the universe three times (once in the outer world, with
the presence of Ereshkigal, and twice in Inanna's inner world, with the pres
ence of the frightening creatures). The balancing parallelisms have led again
and again to the changing third. Stasis and anti-stasis have prepared us for the
end of Inanna's maidenhood. With the cutting ax of civilization, Gilgamesh
pierces the feared snake, the beast that would go forever around and around
upon itself, and Inanna's projected fears disappear. The tree, freed of Inanna's
demons, is brought into the city.
The tree, which was born from the confrontation of life's opposing forces,
is now shared between Inanna and Gilgamesh; woman and man, goddess and mortal. Contact with the tree brings Sumerian man and woman to a closer
understanding of life's forces: the world's creation and its human echo,
woman's sexuality and her emerging consciousness. The sons of the city who
help Gilgamesh are benefactors as well, for it is from the wood of the huluppu
tree that the throne and bed of their goddess is fashioned. When Inanna begins
145



her rule, she will be sitting on the throne of the buluppu- tree, and her under
standing of life and death, consciousness and lack of consciousness, will be
increased accordingly. Likewise, when she holds a man in her arms, the bed
will murmur to them both the secrets of life and death, light and darlcness.
Inanna and the God of Wisdom
Inanna placed the shugurra, the crown of the steppe, on her head.
When Inanna places the crown of the steppe on her head, she assumes
her role as Queen of the Land. 12 As Queen of the Land of Sumer, Inanna is
responsible to and receives her power from the resources and fertility of the
land. With the shugurra on her head, Inanna goes to the sheepfold, which is
the center of nature in Sumer. Leaning against a fruit tree, she rejoices in her
own natural powers—her wondrous vulva. In Sumerian, the word for sheep
fold, womb, vulva, loins, and lap is the same. The images presented in the first
few lines—shepherd, sheepfold, apple tree, young woman, and vulva—are all
related to fertility. Gone is the brooding, fearful adolescent girl of "The
Huluppu-Tree." Inanna has received her throne and crown. The story of
"Inanna and the God of Wisdom" begins with Inanna delighting in her
womanhood and wishing to test its powers.
Inanna decides to go on a journey. Often in heroic stories, before the hero
sets out on a journey, he takes up and brandishes his sword or manly weapon.
In "The Huluppu-Tree" before the young Gilgamesh ventures into Inanna's
garden, he demonstrates his extraordinary virility by raising a bronze ax
weighing 450 pounds. Likewise, the young Inanna, about to set out on a
journey, exults, in an amazingly straightforward way, in her feminine powers

her wondrous vulva.
Inanna sets out to visit Enki, the God of Wisdom, who is also the God
of the Waters. In "The Huluppu-Ttee" after the new world is divided, Enki
appears, but he is not assigned a fixed domain. Yet without the presence on
earth of Enki, the God of the Waters, no life is possible. With his presence,
water, which permeates and fertilizes the land, gives the earth the power of
life and creativity. This in part accounts for the dual aspect of Enki's powers,
for as well as being God of the Waters, he also has many powers over the earth (in Sumerian, "Enki" means literally God of the Earth). Enki's iconographic
12 In the Sumerian section of the Philadelphia University Museum an exquisite queen's crown,
excavated from Ur and dated to around 2500 B.C., is on display. Unlike most European queens
crowns, which are made of solid gold embedded with precious gems, this Sumerian queen s crown

plants, and tiny animals of many different kinds.
146



emblem, the goat-fish, further indicates his earth-water aspect: the goat goes
to the highest point of all earth animals and the fish to the lowest depths.
The fertilizing, free-flowing, purifying, calming, and raging characteris
tics of waters are personified in the many roles Enki plays in Sumerian stories.
He is the Creator of Humankind ("Enki and Ninmah"), the Fertilizer of the Land, and Organizer of his Creations ("Enki and the World Order"). He is
a Magician and a Master of Ritual and Incantation. Rather than an upholder
of the laws of the gods, he is a Mediator between Men (the debate literature)
and a Mediator before the Gods on the part of the Mortals ("Atrahasis").
Always following his own feelings and instincts, Enki is the Great Shaman
("The Descent of Inanna" and "The Huluppu-Tree"). Enki's sacred shrine,
the Abzu, is built above the regions of the underworld. His city, Eridu, is
located near where the fresh and salt waters meet, where the Tigris and
Euphrates rivers and the Persian Gulf converge.
When we consider the myriad aspects of the God of Wisdom, Inanna's
decision to journey to Eridu can be understood as a wish to be "fertilized" by
the sexual as well as the magical, spiritual, and cultural powers of life—both
for herself and for her queendom. With youthful audacity, she boasts that she
will bless Enki, the God of Wisdom. But Enki refers to Inanna as "the young
woman," and bids his servant Isimud treat Inanna "as if she were an equal.
Each deity supposes superiority over the other.
As soon as Enki and Inanna begin to drink, Enki the overconfident,
over-effusive host offers the treasures of his kingdom to his guest. She accepts.
Enki is full of generosity; Inanna is full of intention. Gaiety surrounds them.
Enki donates and Inanna takes. After Inanna itemizes the me she has been
given, they are placed on the Boat of Heaven. Inanna's Boat of Heaven (which
Inanna in "The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi" compares to her wondrous
vulva) is of sufficient amplitude to hold all the me.
The ordering of the me offers some indication of what the Sumerians
or the Sumerian priesthood who had possession of the me— valued. The first
eight groupings center on the priesthood and the rituals involved in serving
the gods, the king, and the temple. Since the me are referred to as the "holy
me" it can be inferred that the "attributes of civilization" were derived from
and inspired by the gods and made available to the people through the institu
tion of the temple and its servants. The last six groupings, beginning with "the
art of the hero," are related to humanity's concerns: political power, the secure
dwelling place, crafts, husbandry, emotions, the family, counseling, and deci
sion. 13
13 By the end of the story, the me have been announced four times. Since there are about one
hundred me, this method of listing the me four times within a story may have been an early
Sumerian pedagogical technique for learning one's "me" in an enjoyable manner. One child who
147



There is a wonderful irony in the last of Enki's gifts to Inanna. When
Inanna sets out for Eridu, she is eager for adventure, eager to test her powers,
eager to be fertilized. During the drinking bout, she happily accepts each gift.
But at the moment she receives from Enki the last gift, "the making of
decisions," Inanna's eagerness turns from bravado to true decision. Inanna
decides she wants to keep the me; and so she hastily and prudently departs.
Although most of the me stress the power and importance of the priesthood
and servitude, without "the making of decisions" the other me are meaning
less. Without the individual's decision there can be no kingship, leather
making, princess/priestess, counseling. It is the will—the strength and ability
to make decisions—that houses the divine attributes. It is the will that per
ceives, believes, and takes action.
Adding further irony to the story, the great God of Wisdom loses his own
sense of form and control through drunken frivolity. Enki, the protector of
Sumer's most spiritualized treasure, the me, symbol of the ultimate form of
things, loses his will. To understand this dual aspect of Enki—his highly
differentiated standards of culture as well as his carousing, companionable
frivolity—is to have a fuller view of "wisdom." As God of Wisdom, Enki knows that the powers of knowledge need to
be shared; as King of Eridu, he knows that the best rule is the self-sufficiency
of his citizens; as Father, he knows that the best way to raise his children is by
encouraging initiative and independence. Like the first drop of water, which
generously offers a place to the second drop, Enki, in his state of drunkenness,
freely shares his own powers.
Perhaps the vessel of Urash from which Enki drinks partially influences
his generous state of mind. Urash, the primordial Mother of the Earth, does
not hold back. In giving birth, Urash gives away everything; all that a plant
or tree needs is given in the birthing. No power is withheld. But surely the
beer within the vessel also contributes to Enki's fluid state. Immediate con
cerns, cares, and boundaries vanish. Enki's ego melts. The God of Wisdom
gives to the young Queen of Uruk all the necessary knowledge for the ruling
of her kingdom. Yet as soon as the drink wears off and his consciousness
returns, so do Enki's possessive, jealous, and controlling aspects. Enki—god,
king, father, and magician—wants his riches for himself.
Now the other side of the God of Wisdom, the dark shaman who with
holds rather than gives birth, emerges, and Enki summons his occult powers.
Of the six creatures who guard the treasures of Eridu, we have fragmentary
heard the story of the me told me he imagined that the mi were loaded onto the boat in inflatable
plastic containers of different shapes and sizes. They were stored in these containers; then, when
a certain me was needed, the container was squeezed slightly to let out a little tear, kindness, or courage.
148



information on only two: the enkum and the lahamas} 4 The enkum are protec
tive spirits created by Enki and placed under the floors and foundations of
Eridu. They are part-human, part-animal, and have hair that hangs loosely
behind them. The lahamas are dragon-like stone statues who guard the door
ways of Eridu and act as messengers for Enki. Throughout world mythology,
wherever there is a great treasure there are also dragons, monsters, and
demons to guard that treasure. The mysteries or spiritual treasures offer abun
dance and riches, but only to those capable of both winning and protecting
them. Enki, who has lost his treasures, sends his servant Isimud with the enkum
creatures to rescue the me of Eridu.
When Isimud requests that Inanna return the treasures she has been
given, she is indignant. She rages against her father. She no longer sees him
as the supportive, generous father, but as the one who withholds, insisting on
his own rights and desires. In her childish eyes, her father is a tyrant, a fraud,
a monstrous liar. However, when Enki's henchmen seize the Boat of Heaven,
Inanna drops her attitude of deceived, dependent, naive child. She recognizes
the reality of her father's dual nature and takes action.
By summoning her own sukkal, Ninshubur, Inanna defends the treasures
she wishes to bring to her city. Although a sukkal is a servant who may act in
many different capacities—as vizier, minister, chancellor, messenger, general,
or warrior—a sukkal who carries out orders often has powers superior to his
or her master. Inanna's sukkal Ninshubur, often referred to as the servant of
the holy shrine of Uruk, seems to represent the inner spiritual resources of
Inanna, which are intended for the greater good of Sumer. (In other Sumerian
literature Ninshubur acts as the sukkal of the Sky God, An—the creator and
the oldest of the gods—and as his sukkal, she would have access to his heav
enly, numinous powers.)
Because the text is not decipherable at this point, we do not know exactly
how Ninshubur defeats Enki's monsters. There is a clue, however, in Inanna's
cryptic lines to Ninshubur:
Water has not touched your hand, Water has not touched your foot.
Enki's powers are in the waters, and if water (or semen) has never touched
Ninshubur, Enki can have no hold over her. Also, if water has never touched
Ninshubur, she is probably pure spirit, and since she comes from the East
(Ninshubur means Queen of the East), her powers, possibly connected to the
sun, are able to quench those of Enki's—the water. The Queen of the East

of Near Eastern Languages, University of Chicago, 1975, pp. 108-10. See this dissertation for further information on Enki.

aspect of Ninshubur is related to the cosmological Morning Star aspect of
Inanna. It is Inanna's heavenly power that defeats the crafty, protean, eanhy
Enki. l >
As Ninshubur overpowers each of Enki's magic creatures, the Boat of
Heaven nears Uruk. There is insufficient information available to us to differ
entiate among the six Eridu creatures. Most likely, there is some son of
progression of power. The creatures become larger, more powerful, or more
treacherous. By defeating Enki's magic creatures, Inanna acquires their corre
sponding shaman ic powers. When she returns to Uruk, she enters as the
heroic, shamanic queen. A hero wrests the treasure from the adversary; a
shaman uses higher powers to protect the well-being of the community; and
a queen, mother of her country, offers her people that which will nourish them
both physically and spiritually.
Indeed, when Inanna returns to Uruk, she is acclaimed—and even more
than she had expected. As the me are unloaded and presented to the people
of Uruk, they are announced for the fourth time. Then, suddenly, more me
appear than Enki had given. These me center on feminine attributes. At the
beginning of the story, Inanna flaunted her raw feminine vitality—her won
drous vulva. En route and in battle her powers were tested, and, joining forces
with more spiritual resources, Inanna emerged a fuller woman. She passed
from vulva to provider, from hero to queen. Thus she was rewarded by the
great Earth Shaman, Father Enki, with the "art of the woman." And this, too,
she offers to the people of Uruk.
The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi
The brother spoke to his younger sister. The Sun God, Utu, spoke to Inanna, saying:
"Young Lady, the flax in its fullness is lovely.
Inanna, the grain is glistening in the furrow.'
It is spring when the love of the goddess Inanna and the mortal shepherd
Dumuzi begins. The wheat is ripe, the lettuce is sprouting, the gardens are in
bloom, water is flowing, and fresh milk is abundant. The growing, blooming
aspect connects lovers and the spring earth.
In the story of "The Huluppu-Tree" the young woman Inanna was given
a throne and bed. In the story of "Inanna and the God of Wisdom," Inanna,
n In the famous Chinese epic of Monkey, a similar confrontation and victory' take place. The
earthy, crafty magician Monkey (Enki) challenges the Great Buddha (An) but is defeated, ait he hops into Buddha's hand, by experiencing the limitlessness of the heavens.
150



the Queen of the Land, earned her throne. Yet as "The Courtship" poems
begin, the bed of the "Young Lady" is still empty.
The Sun God, Utu, who oversees and affects the growing earth, ap
proaches Inanna and compares her sexual ripeness to the ripeness of the
growing grain. By his sexually arousing dialogue with his sister, Utu takes on
momentarily the role of sexual initiator, a role he refused in "The Huluppu
Tree," for it would have led to too close a bond between brother and sister
and not have permitted the destined bond between goddess and mortal. Since
Gilgamesh, the hero of Uruk, and Dumuzi were both listed as historical kings
of Uruk (who ruled in approximately 2500-2275 B.C. and shared the same
mother Sirtur/Ninsun), 16 they can be considered avatars or incarnations of
each other. Utu incites Inanna in order to prepare her for her destiny: her
marriage bed with the shepherd Dumuzi. Hence, the bond that was formed between Gilgamesh and Inanna in "The Huluppu-Tree" is to be consummated
in "The Courtship."
But Inanna refuses. Perhaps she wishes to choose her own consort. Per
haps Inanna, who has her own garden, finds the farmer more familiar and
appealing than the coarser, rougher figure of the shepherd. Dumuzi, in turn,
refuses to be overlooked and offers to match his rival's gifts. Inanna protests,
but Dumuzi persists, reassuring her, by comparing their families, that she and
he are not so different. Yet it is only when Dumuzi fortuitously equates himself
with Inanna's beloved brother Utu that he is able to spark her desire for him.
When Dumuzi actually arrives at Inanna's house bearing the gifts he had
promised, Inanna runs to her mother. Surely, Ningal, "the mother who bore
her," would know about love and loving. Ningal reassures Inanna by explain
ing that the young man will be both mother and father to her. She needn't be
afraid of leaving her home, for she will find another where she will also be
nourished and protected. "Open the house," Ningal advises her daughter.
While Dumuzi waits, Inanna purifies and adorns herself in the hope of being
admired and loved. When she opens the door of her house to Dumuzi, her
outer allure delights him and his delight in her, in turn, arouses her passion.
To press one's neck close to another, to put one's hand in another's, and to
embrace are all Sumerian expressions for making love.
From this moment, the lovers enter their own world. Realizing her for
mer barren state, Inanna urges the man of her heart to fertilize her—all of her.
Her readiness and eagerness incite his energies, and Dumuzi blossoms. In the
next several love songs, as in all deeply shared and open sexual passion, there
16 This information is found in the historical document of the Sumerian Kinglist, which states
that Dumuzi's reign of 100 years was followed by Gilgamesh's reign of 1 26 years. Before Dumuzi,
Lugalbanda reigned over Uruk, and before him, Enmerkar built Uruk and ruled over it for 420 years.

is a mingling and intermingling of male and female energies: Inanna drinks
Dumuzi's milk; he drinks hers. They dance and meet. Dumuzi offers his
ripened fruit to Inanna; Inanna pours out her ripened fruit to Dumuzi. The
doors to each other's houses are wide open. They call each other brother and
sister, terms of affection and kinship in ancient love songs. As soul-mates, they
wander together in the spring garden of life.
In the final series of love songs, Inanna calls for the royal bed her family
had wished her to prepare; she sums up the love shared between herself and
Dumuzi; and then commits herself to serving her king and husband in every
possible way. Ninshubur restates Inanna's pledge in a more public manner:
Inanna, Queen of Heaven and Earth, will serve her husband, who will be the
king and servant of all Sumer and Akkad. The marriage is consummated
officially and followed, almost immediately, by Dumuzi's withdrawal to kingly
matters, and Inanna's bereaved memories of a lover, a brother, who was once
so sweet.
The love of Inanna and Dumuzi divides into three sections. In the first section,
the young woman, Inanna, still belongs to her family. Her brother guides her;
her father and grandfather advise her; her mother counsels her. She is physi
cally ready for the sexual act (the flax is in its fullness), yet she still needs time
to be emotionally and psychologically prepared. The back-and-forth, pulling
and tugging verbal battles so much a part of young love give the young woman
and man time to try each other out and become familiar before setting sail into
unknown territory.
In the second section, the lovers embark. The world of the senses so
explodes about them—drinking, eating, churning, dancing, singing, tasting,
smelling—that they are oblivious of everything but each other. They feed on
and are nourished by one another's vital juices. The words of Inanna's mother,
Ningal, are prophetic:
"... the young man will be your father. . . . the young man will be your mother."
In taking all their nourishment from each other, each becomes in turn parent
and child, feeder and fed. Dumuzi plants the seed that nourishes Inanna;
Inanna gives to Dumuzi the impulse that enables him to sprout. Yet they are
more than parent and child; they are also brother and sister, equals, capable
of articulating and expressing the riches that love induces. Dumuzi rejoices:
O Lady, your breast is your field . . .
Your broad field pours out plants.
Your broad field pours out grain . . .
152



Pour it out for me, Inanna.
I will drink all you offer.
Inanna sings:
My honey-man, my honey-man sweetens me always. My lord, the honey-man of the gods;
He is the one my womb loves best.
His hand is honey; his foot is honey;
He sweetens me always.
The "always" ends. Whether by external or internal interference, unending,
uninterrupted mutual bliss is not an earthly possibility. Change is the human
condition. In this instance, it is the woman Inanna who by calling for the royal
marriage bed brings the family and social world into her exclusive relationship
with Dumuzi, thus ending "the honey-moon."
The third section reflects upon and poignantly echoes the first and second
sections. The marriage bed that Inanna calls for is the very one her brother,
Utu, first advised her to prepare. But now Inanna takes on the voice of the
woman. She proclaims what she will be. What once flowed so freely and
naturally between man and woman is "declared" and "determined." And
then, by accepting the mandates of Ninshubur, the servant of the holy shrine
of Uruk—that she will give her husband the strength to provide leadership,
guidance, and fertility to others—Inanna implicitly sanctions her lover being
turned into father.
As Dumuzi takes on the prescribed role of father and king, he asks Inanna
to set him free; for he cannot be her exclusive paramour, making love to her
"fifty times," and also serve in the manifold ways demanded of him as King
of Sumer. He who once in awe and eagerness cried, "Great Lady ... I, Dumuzi
the King, will plow your vulva," now relegates the Priestess of Heaven and
Earth to the role of "little daughter." He who once sought to be close to
Inanna, "My sister, I would go with you to my garden," now seeks to separate
himself from her:
"Set me free, my sister, set me free.
You will be a little daughter to my father. Come, my beloved sister, I would go to the palace.
Set me free."
"The Courtship" has come fullxircle. Although the shepherd has become king
and Inanna has found a consort for her royal marriage bed, the intimacy and
passion of their "summery" love is gone. The two are together, yet separate.
153



These Sumenan love songs between the sneptierd-iang MM In
in Sumetiw times «o a ritual Sumerologists call the sacred marriage rite. In this
ritual, the king of a Sumerian city (usually given the epithet "Dumuzi ")
symboliolBj weds the goddess Inanna, who is represented by the high pri
ess of her city. If the goddess is pleased with her suitor and his gifts, 1 ' she
ise to him. The sacred marriage bed is prepared, and there, at
the proper time (see "The Joy of Sumer" hymr. md commentary), the
mairiage between king and goddess takes place to the accompaniment ot
merriment and such songs as those in "The Courtship.'
A detailed description of both Inannas powers and the sacred marriage
it given in the story of Enmerkjr and Ensuhkisdan'u. In this story, two
kings of Sumer each claim to be first in Inanna s affections. The King ot Aratta
boasts:

favor. The man who wed such a goddess would gain fertility for himself, the
farmer who wed Inanna would gain fertility for his plants; and the shepherd
who wed Inanna would gain fertility for his land and people. Inanna, the Love
Goddess, was "the force that through the green fuse drives the flower." 20 In the love songs, the Sumerian farmer and shepherd compete for the
affections of the Love Goddess. The Sumerian pantheon, or "family" protec
tive of Sumer's interests, prefers the shepherd to be the one to share Inanna's
marriage bed. The preference may be the result of one or several reasons: As
shepherd, Dumuzi can take care of and provide for his flocks, thus proving that
he can take on the leadership of the land. 21 As Dumuzi-abzu (abzu means "the deep"), the son of Enki, the God of Wisdom, Dumuzi would bring to the city of Uruk, which was previously ruled by the Sky God, An, the deep wisdom
of Enki. And as a leader from the southern regions of Mesopotamia, Dumuzi
would bring to northern Sumer an alliance with the more religious (and sometimes wealthier) states of southern Sumer.
The marriage of the goddess Inanna to the king was of essential impor
tance to the people of Sumer. It was by this religious ritual that Inanna, Queen
of Heaven, would take the earth-king into the "sweetness of her holy loins,"
and by her cosmic powers ensure the king's powers of leadership and fertility.
Yet Inanna, the Goddess of Love, does not offer her favors freely. Not
only must she be properly approached with sweet words and gifts, but she must
be properly and amply loved. A lion of a man is demanded: a king who is equal
to Inanna in ferocity, rage, greed, power, and passion for life. And then, as
the two "bed-lions"—the wg-lion and the pirig- lion—chase each other from
back to front, from front to back around the bed, goddess and mortal, woman
and man "chase" each other until the two become one. At that moment, at
least in ritual, the bounties of heaven are assured on earth for the kingdom
of Sumer—its people, its flocks, and its "holy plants."
The Descent of Inanna
FROM THE GREAT ABOVE TO THE GREAT BELOW
From the Great Above she opened her ear to the Great Below. From the Great Above the goddess opened her ear to the Great Below. From the Great Above Inanna opened her ear to the Great Below.
20 Dylan Thomas, The Collected Poems of Dylan Thomas. New York: New Directions, 1957, p. 10.
2, Of all ancient professions, none was more demanding than shepherding or husbandry; care and protection of animals was a twenty-four-hour-a-day occupation.
155



The path of the descent has "impelled" the mystic since the beginning of
recorded human experience. In many traditional societies, initiatory tribal rites
are often characterized by a symbolic descent into and ascent from the labyrin
thian Earth Mother. These rituals give women and men the experience of
being reborn on a spiritual plane. According to Mircea Eliade, traditional
rituals of the descent tend to follow a universal pattern: (1) separation from
the family; (2) regression to a pre-natal state, the cosmic night; (3) death,
dismemberment, suffering; (4) rebirth; and (5) killing of another. 22 In other
traditional societies, only certain people are "called" to travel to the under
world, for the path to the Great Below is treacherous and often there is no
return. Those who do return, such as Enki, the God of Wisdom, become
known as shamans and Great Magicians. They carry within them the knowl
edge of rebirth and often return bringing to their cultures a new world view.
Sometimes there is a specific cause that starts, or seems to start, the
descent: dissatisfaction, dissolution, separation from loved ones. In modern
times, Tolstoy, at the age of fifty, in good health, happily married and happily
employed, wrote that there did not seem to be an apparent cause, only a "call":
I felt that something had broken within me on which my life had always rested, and that I had nothing left to hold on to, and that morally my life had stopped. An invincible force impelled me to get rid of my existence in one way or another. It cannot be said exactly that I wished to kill myself, for the force which drew me away from life was fuller, more powerful, more general than any mere desire. It was a force like my old aspiration to live, only it impelled me in the opposite direction. . . , 23
Inanna is Queen of Heaven and Earth, but she does not know the under
world. Until her ear opens to the Great Below, her understanding is necessar
ily limited. In Sumerian, the word for ear and wisdom is the same. The ear,
which is located mostly internally and is coiled like a spiral or labyrinth, takes
in sounds and begins to transform the imperceptible into meaning. It is said
of Enki, the God of Wisdom and the King of the Watery Deep, who lives
directly above the underworld, that his ears are "wide open" and that "he
knows all things." In order to fully appreciate or "know" what is said or
meant, a great understanding is needed—an understanding of all things. It is
the Great Below, and the knowledge of death and rebirth, life and stasis, that
will make of Inanna an "Honored Counselor" and a guide to the land.
The moment Inanna opens her ear to the Great Below, her journey
begins. Yet although her journey begins at once, the way to the underworld
is slow and laborious. To enter the spiritual realm of the underworld, Inanna
must give up her earthly powers. One by one, Inanna abandons her glory, both

in heaven and on earth. She abandons her seven cities and temples; she abandons her worldly strongholds:
My Lady abandoned heaven and earth to descend to the underworld
•••
She abandoned her office of Holy Priestess of Heaven to descend to the underworld.
In Uruk she abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld.
To prepare for her journey, Inanna gathers together the seven me. Just
as a hero takes certain talismanic weapons to ensure his success, Inanna takes
the seven me, transformed into such feminine allure as a crown, jewelry, and
a gown, to serve as her protections. In case she should not return from the
underworld, Inanna instructs Ninshubur in what way to remind her "fathers"
of their daughter. Since Ninshubur is to enter the shrines of the gods, where
their cultic images reside, Inanna's metanymic description of herself as silver,
stone, and wood may refer to the materials the craftsworkers used to form the
cultic statue of Inanna which, according to Sumerian belief, harbored the
goddess herself. Silver, stone, and wood are also primary elements represent
ing the three worlds: the light of heaven, the permanence of earth, and the
impermanence and decay of the underworld.
At the gate of the underworld, Inanna is asked why she has come. Her
first answer, "Because of my older sister, Ereshkigal," probably the true
spontaneous response, expresses the compelling, not yet understandable pull
of the Great Below for Inanna. Her second, more formal, ceremonial reply
refers to her desire "to witness" the funeral of Gugalanna. 24 In many ways the
Bull of Heaven's impetuous, forceful, procreative character resembles
Inanna's. Certainly, the ever-curious Inanna would prefer "to witness" an
other's funeral—to gain power of and knowledge over death by proxy—rather
than to experience death herself. But to enter the underworld is to see Ereshki
gal, and to see the Queen of the Underworld can bring Inanna the possibility
of being witness to only one funeral, her own.
Ereshkigal, the Queen of the Underworld, lives in a dry and dark realm.
The kur, which in Sumerian also means "mountain" and "enemy territory,"
is the Great Unknown. Ereshkigal did not choose such a place to rule; but in
"The Huluppu-Tree" we are told she "was given the underworld for her
24 An astronomical interpretation of "the funeral of Gugalanna" (the Bull of Heaven or the
planet Taurus) is suggested by the planet Taurus's yearly passage for 6 weeks below the Sumerian
horizon beginning the middle of January. The re-emergence of the planet Taurus into the sky in
March also corresponds to the Sumerian agricultural cycle and the yearly emergence of Dumuzi
(who is often referred to as the bull) from the underworld in the early spring. See Willy Manner,
"The Earliest History of the Constellations in the Near East and the Motif of the Lion-Bull Combat," in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, 12, pp. 1-16, 1965.
157



domain." In the underworld, she eats clay and drinks dirty water. She has no
compassion for the relationships of others, husband and wife or parent and
child. 25 Her one great craving is for her own sexual satisfaction. In the later
Neo-Assyrian story of "Nergal and Ereshkigal," we learn that when Nergal
enters the kur, Ereshkigal copulates with him for six days and six nights; yet
when he departs on the seventh day, she still has not had enough.
Like Lilith's, Ereshkigal's sexuality is compulsive, insatiable, and without
relationship or offspring. She herself bemoans her plight when she begs the
gods of heaven to send Nergal back to her:
Since I, thy daughter, was young, I have not known the play of maidens, I have not known the frolic of young girls. (That god whom) thou didst send and who had intercourse with me, Let him lie with me. 26
This underground goddess, whose realm is dry and dark, whose husband
Gugalanna is dead, who has no protective or caring mother, father, or brother
(that we know of), who wears no clothes, and whose childhood is lost, can be
considered the prototype of a witch—unloving, unloved, abandoned, instinc
tual, and full of rage, greed, and desperate loneliness.
In many ways, Ereshkigal is the other, neglected side of Inanna. There
fore, when she hears of the appearance at her gates of the "all-white" fertile,
bedecked Goddess of Love, she is enraged, for Inanna's light, glory, and
perpetual movement have, to some extent, been achieved at her expense.
Ereshkigal commands Neti to divest the bright goddess of all she has accom
plished so that the effervescent force of the universe, the ever-rising planet of
the East, may experience what it is to be rejected— incapable of movement or
relationship—and rendered prima materia.
Neti opens the gates of the underworld to Inanna. The descent, which
Inanna began on earth by abandoning her seven cities and seven temples, is
continued and paralleled in the underworld. At each of the seven gates (seven
in Akkadian means "wholeness") Inanna is forced to give up another one of
her earthly attributes. Inanna protests, yet she determinedly and heroically
surrenders her roles as queen, holy priestess, and woman. Her royal power,
her priestly office, her sexual powers, which had helped her in her journey and
encounter with her father, Enki, are of no avail in the underworld. In fact, all
that Inanna had achieved on earth weighs against her when she meets the
woman at whose expense Inanna's glories had been attained. The all-seeing

158



judges of the underworld perceive Inanna's hidden, split-off parts and con
demn her. Ereshkigal cries out "Guilty." And Inanna, like Gugalanna before
her, is killed and becomes a part of the underworld.
The fate Inanna has chosen is the same that awaited every mortal
Sumerian. However, from archaeological evidence and literary texts, it does
not seem that the Sumerians believed death was the end. For them, death
marked the separation of the body from the spirit. The body was buried in the
ground; the spirit moved on to a different realm in the kur. Both at the royal
cemeteries (Ur, Nippur, and Kish) and at smaller private cemeteries that have
been excavated, vessels of stone and cups of lead with remnants of food and
drink have been found in the hands of, or next to, the bodies of the dead. 27
In The Epic of Gilgamesh, Enkidu describes the vision he has had of the kur:
. . . the house where none leave who have entered it. . . . Where dust is their fare and clay their food.
They are clothed like birds, with wings for garments,
And see no light, residing in darkness. In the House of Dust, which I entered, I looked at (rulers), their crowns put away; I (saw princes) those (born to) the crown, Who had ruled the land from the days of yore. (These doubl)es of Anu and Enlil were serving meat roasts. . . , 28
From Enkidu 's account we learn that the Sumerians believed that although no
one returns from the underworld, death is not completely final. The body
disintegrates, yet the transformed spirit is still recognizable. Rulers and princes
become servants. Inanna, the mighty Queen of Heaven and Earth, is no longer
the commanding queen; she is now at the mercy of her servant. Ninshubur,
her spiritual self, must save her. Inanna can do no more.
When after three days Inanna does not return, 29 Ninshubur follows
Inanna's advice and pleads before the fathers. Enlil, Inanna's father's father,
the authority and director of the rational world, wants nothing to do with
Inanna in the kur. Nanna, Inanna's father and the good son of Enlil, also has
no appreciation or understanding of why Inanna might have gone on such a
journey. Both Enlil and Nanna are angry that Inanna should pursue a direction
that is different from theirs. But Enki, Inanna's mother's father and the God

29The three-day period may be connected to the moon s disappearance from view for three
days each month. This relates to Inanna's aspect as First Daughter of the Moon. (We do not have
sufficient information at present to correlate Inanna's Venus aspect— Lady of the Morning and
Lady of the Evening—with astronomical fact.)
159



of Wisdom, has compassion for his daughter who is in difficulty. Not only does the God of Wisdom value the journey she has set out upon, but he does not
forget his daughter's significance. Inanna is Queen of Heaven and Earth; her
existence is vital to all the lands.
As God of Wisdom, Enki has powers to create and to facilitate. He knows
the nature of the feminine kur, and of its rule by the jealous, anguished
Ereshkigal, who at this moment is moaning "with the cries of a woman about
to give birth." He creates from the dirt of his fingernails the kurgarra and
galatur— instinctual, asexual creatures who will not disturb the necessary infer
tility rules of the kur. He endows the creatures with the artistic and empathetic
talent of being professional mourners, capable of mirroring the lonely queen's
emotions.
At the same time that Ereshkigal is moaning both for her "inside" and
her "outside," Inanna is dying. Ereshkigal had willed Inanna's death; yet she
can scarcely bear it, for Inanna is the other side of herself. The interplay
between Inanna and Ereshkigal is complex and dynamic. Although Inanna had
seemed to descend without cause to the kur, it might now be understood that
Ereshkigal, or the dark side of Inanna, had gone into labor and needed to be
reborn. It was this labor or "call" that Inanna had heard from the Great Above.
Ereshkigal, the neglected side of Inanna, has certain qualities that are
similar to Lilith's. Both are connected to the nighttime aspects of the feminine

the powerful, raging sexuality and the deep wounds accumulated from life's
rejections—which seek solace in physical union only. Lilith usually flees from
rejections; Ereshkigal withdraws "underground." In "The Huluppu-Tree,"
when Lilith could not have her own way, she resentfully and destructively
smashed her own home. The powerful Lilith of Inanna's adolescent days had
to be sent away so Inanna's life-exploring talents could be developed. But now
that Inanna has become queen of her city, wife to her beloved, mother to her
children, she is more able to face what she has neglected and feared: the
instinctual, wounded, frightened parts of herself. She now hears, and is capable
of responding to, the labor call of Ereshkigal in the Great Below.
When Ereshkigal moans, the kurgarra and galatur moan with her. The
anguish she feels in the deep underworld is appeased by the echo of their
concern. Ereshkigal is so touched by the attention they offer to her in her pain
that she extends herself and offers, in turn, gifts of fertility and growth. But
the creatures, following Enki's instructions, refuse these gifts and ask her
instead for what she wishes to give and yet for that which is most difficult for
her to give. They ask her to release part of her personal anguish, her despair
and anger, which is embodied in the glorious Goddess of Love. Yet by having
permitted herself to be comforted and to experience the pleasure of the
rapport with the other, Ereshkigal has already released part of her pain. Her
160



agreement to release her nemesis, Inanna, is only the confirmation of the
spiritual movement that the God of Wisdom and Healing, Enki, had understood and had most ingeniously brought about. 30
The triad—Ninshubur, Inanna's spiritual self; Enki, the God of Wisdom
and Healing; and the compassionate, instinctual kurgarra and galatur— is suc
cessful.
Once reborn, Inanna wishes immediately to leave. However, in the
Sumerian underworld, while a record of each arrival is kept, no one had ever
before been allowed to depart. But Inanna's case is different. She has been
reborn in the underworld. Therefore new rules must be introduced. With the
proclamation of the gods of the underworld:
No one ascends from the underworld unmarked. If Inanna wishes to return, She must provide someone in her place . . .
the rules of the underworld are both stretched and maintained. Inanna may
leave, but she is responsible for finding someone to replace her.
A pan of Inanna must return. A passageway has been created from the
Great Above, the conscious, to the Great Below, the unconscious, and it must
be kept open. Inanna must not forget her neglected, abandoned older "sister"
—that part of herself that is Ereshkigal.
Inanna leaves the underworld, accompanied by the galla. In their uncom
promising aspect of refusing all gifts, the galla, or demons of the underworld,
are the living representations of the kur: death accepts no deals, physical,
emotional, or familial. Moreover, the galla have the additional, riveting aspect
of belonging to the one for whom they are intended.
Meanwhile, Inanna's servant and two sons, 31 who care deeply about her,
have abandoned the routine of their daily lives. Ninshubur waits by the gate
of the underworld for Inanna. Shara and Lulal, Inanna's sons, wait for their
mother in their temples, most likely praying. All three have taken off their
customary clothes and put on sackcloth, the garment of mourning.
Yet the King of Sumer goes on with life as if nothing had happened, as
if the Queen of Heaven and Earth had not disappeared, as if his own wife were
safe and secure. Near the apple tree where he and Inanna had once made love,
Dumuzi, dressed in the noble me- garments his wife had given him, seated on
}0See Sylvia Perrea's Descent to the Goddess (New York: Inner City Books, 1981 ) for a further exploration of the healing aspects of "The Descent of Inanna."
}1 Our only information about Inanna's two sons, according to Samuel Noah Kramer, comes
from two sources. In "Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta," Shara proclaims: "I am a wild beast
... a warrior ... a noble lord ... the son of Inanna and the god of the king." In a composition
that seems to be a lamentation, Inanna gives birth to Lulal, the water scorpion, the water snake, whose cry is the cry of the Flood.
161



the royal throne, which his wife, Inanna, had also presented to him, clings to
his new role of kingship and refuses to acknowledge the ties of feeling and love
that once bound him to his wife. When Inanna's inner ear opened and she departed from Uruk, she was
in midlife, married, with two children. Through her instructions to Nin
shubur, Inanna made careful provisions so that she would return. However,
during her absence Dumuzi had been following a completely different jour
ney. Inanna had turned from earthly passion and achievement to the Un
known; Dumuzi had turned from earthly passion to earthly achievement. Once
shepherd, now king, kingship has become his path. He has grown so attached
to and identified with his high position that he neither weeps for his "lost" wife
nor runs to greet her when she returns, as do her sons and Ninshubur. The impasse between Inanna and Dumuzi at this moment is reflected in
their physical positions. The Queen of Heaven, tormented by underworld
demons, stands below her husband. Dumuzi is raised above the earth and
maintains his high seat and glorious, shining garments. To understand this
crucial and brutal encounter, it is worth hypothesizing on both of their
thoughts:
Dumuzi: I ruled the kingdom, kept order while she adventured into
chaos. Now she wants to reclaim her authority on earth. Her unsettling jour
ney and demons bring turmoil into the kingdom. They are her concern, not
mine. I must continue to carry out my all-consuming task of governing the
people and state of Sumer.
Inanna: I placed him on the throne, gave him his position. I loved him
and he left me to attend to affairs of state. While I went to deal with matters
affecting my deepest soul, he used my powers to make himself more important.
Once I was his whole world; now he refuses to descend from his throne to help me.
Whatever may have been the specific personal grievances between hus
band and wife that allow us to identify with the story, the greater issue is
already determined. Someone must go to the underworld to replace Inanna.
And the husband of Inanna is the perfect substitute, for he is also the King of Sumer.
The Sumerians extolled the king who was wise and compassionate as well
as powerful. They extolled the king who cared for the weak, the poor, the
wronged, the widowed. 32 It was Inanna's visit to the underworld that opened
the Queen of Heaven's vision to her own vulnerability. If Dumuzi is to be a
32The plaque of Ur-Nammu (see page 9 for illustration) states that the king was responsible for ensuring that the orphan did not fail a prey to the wealthy, that the widow did not fall a prey to the powerful, that the man of one shekel did not fall a prey to the man of one mina [sixty
shekels]"—Kramer's essay, page 118.
162



truly "great" king in the ways extolled by the poets of Sumer, he too must
journey to the feared place, to the Great Unknown. He, too, must meet
Ereshkigal. Inanna's curse topples Dumuzi from his fixed position and forces
him to face the dark, demanding aspects of his wife, as well as the uncontrolla
ble, inexplicable, irrational mystery of death and the kingdom of Ereshkigal.
Filled with terror, Dumuzi resists the galla who seize him. Yet as Inanna's
husband, as well as Dumuzi-a bzu, the son of the God of Wisdom, he has the
inner capacity to undergo such a journey. Just as Inanna needed time to
descend, abandoning one city and temple after another, Dumuzi, too, in
fleeing from Uruk to Kubiresh to Old Belili, prepares himself to leave the
earth for his own journey of transformation.
THE DREAM OF DUMUZI
His heart was filled with tears. The shepherd's heart was filled with tears. Dumuzi 's heart was filled with tears.
As "The Dream of Dumuzi" begins, the heart of the shepherd-king is
filled with tears. The ruling king who once sat so proudly on his noble throne,
permitting himself little compassion toward others, now is overwhelmed by
his own feelings and vulnerability.
He leaves the city to return to his boyhood home of the steppes. There
he calls on the familiar natural forces—plants and animals—to comfort him.
He calls to his mother and sister; he has lost his strength and vitality and can
no longer provide for them. Alone, without power, comfort, or direction, he
turns inward and dreams.
Nightly dreams are usually of a daily, mundane character. Once a year,
or perhaps only once in a lifetime, we dream a "Great Dream." We sense its
overwhelming importance. The Great Dream speaks of more than the here
and now; its images are riveting. It will not give us peace until we begin to
understand it.
In ancient literature, Great Dreams often emerge at moments of intense
confusion or turmoil; and the one who can interpret the dream and find
direction for the dreamer then becomes invaluable to the dreamer. At the end
of The Odyssey, Penelope speaks of the dreams from the Gate of Ivory that are
illusions, and the dreams from the Gate of Horn that, when understood,
accurately describe the future. The constant Penelope tells her dream to the
disguised wanderer Odysseus. He not only interprets it but helps to bring it
to pass. In the Bible, the powerful Egyptian Pharaoh frees the lowly Hebrew
slave, Joseph, from prison so that Pharaoh can profit from Joseph's wisdom.
Once Joseph interprets Pharaoh's dream, the fate of the two—ruler and slave,
163



Egyptian and Hebrew—becomes linked. It often takes a person of opposite
character from the dreamer to interpret the dream, for the dream speaks of
the inner life that lies hidden away from its dreamer.
Until now, all that Dumuzi had needed to rule his kingdom—sceptre,
crown, measuring rod and line, fields, meadows, and forests—had been given
to him. Understanding, compassion, devotion belonged to others. But now,
it is these very qualities that Dumuzi needs. Therefore, he turns to the femi
nine wisdom of his younger sister. The compassionate Geshtinanna explains
his dream image by image. The message of the dream is devastating: for
Dumuzi there is no escape from the forces that will carry him to his death. Yet,
buried within the dream, there is a small detail portending life and hope.
Dumuzi's dream divides into five sections. In the first section, the larger
natural world, symbolized by the rushes, reeds, and trees, turns against him.
In the second section, the tools of Dumuzi's profession and manhood—his
hearth, churn, drinking cup, and shepherd's crook—are taken away and de
stroyed. In the third section, Dumuzi's life instinct—the lamb and the sparrow

has been crushed. Dumuzi is no longer welcome on earth. He has lost his
livelihood. His feet cannot move, nor can his spirit (in the form of the spar
row) ascend. All that is left to him is the mourning and grief of his sister. Just
as Ninshubur, at Inanna 's request, wept for Inanna and saved her life, so it is
Geshtinanna who is to take up Dumuzi's spirit and not let it die.
In the fourth section, the memory of Dumuzi is safeguarded in the immor
tal aspect of Geshtinanna's animals. The one detail portending hope for
Dumuzi is the lapis beards of Geshtinanna's goats. Just as the grief of the
animals for their lost shepherd is to be permanent, so too the sister's grief is
to go beyond the momentary; Geshtinanna, in her enduring vigil, will save Dumuzi's life.
In the fifth section, shepherd and man are destroyed, returning Dumuzi's
kingdom to the primordial forces. Although the kings of Sumer continuously
battle to conquer the wilderness and secure their cities and sheepfolds from
flood, famine, and enemies, the devastating power of "the winds" is ever
present, ever-threatening. (In Sumerian, the word for wind, Hi also means
"ghost" and "demon.")
Despite Geshtinanna's realization of the inescapable devastating power of
the demons, when the galla appear, she urges Dumuzi to hide. The galla
search for Dumuzi. For material profit, Dumuzi's friend betrays him. Dumuzi
then curses his friend's child. However, it was not so long ago that Dumuzi
had considered the me- garment and his high throne more valuable than his ties
to his wife. It is the compassionate Geshtinanna who puts an end to the
perpetuation of rejections and curses, pain and anger. Dumuzi turns to his
sister, and she bravely and adamantly befriends him.
164



The galla continue to pursue Dumuzi. Dumuzi appeals to Utu, and pleads
his case by reminding Utu of their shared family ties:
0 Utu, you are my brother-in-law, 1 am the husband of your sister.
Utu, the God ofJustice, remembers the shepherd, whom he had first suggested
that his sister marry. He enables Dumuzi to assume the forms of the slow
lowly snake and the swift high-climbing mountain gazelle. By taking on the
skin of different animals, Dumuzi is given the opportunity to experience the
varying forms of his earthly kingdom. But the galla, who belong to Dumuzi,
discover him in each disguise.
Resigned, Dumuzi returns for the last time to the sheepfold and his sister.
The sheepfold or "womb" is the Great Earth Mother, who gives birth and
takes back the dead. Much as Inanna had been forced to do when entering the
underworld, Dumuzi, too, is divested of his kingship, his shepherdship, his
achievements, and his virility. The most imperceptible of things, Dumuzi 's
dream, has now come to pass.
THE RETURN
"You will go to the underworld Half the year.
Your sister, since she has asked, Will go the other half. On the day you are called, That day you will be taken. On the day Geshtinanna is called,
That day you will be set free."
Inanna, Sirtur, and Geshtinanna weep for the departed Dumuzi. They
weep for their husband, son, and brother. The depth of Geshtinanna's grief
leads her to offer her life to share her brother's death. Her offer is of such
magnitude that the mind can scarcely grasp its meaning. The instinct to live,
to survive, becomes secondary. Love transcends life.
After losing her bridegroom through her uncontrollable willfulness,
Inanna realizes she has lost the "sweetness" of life. In "The Huluppu-Tree,"
the young Inanna wept because she could not get her way. In "Inanna and the
God of Wisdom" and "The Courtship," she was able to channel her resources
to achieve her desires. But now, having returned from the underworld
charged with her own dark, ruthless powers, the widowed Inanna grieves
because she has pushed her way through and destroyed the bridegroom and
husband she loves.
165



When the bereft and humbled Inanna meets Dumuzi's sister, Gesh
tinanna's words pierce her heart:
"I would find my brother! I would comfort him!
I would share his fate!"
Once Inanna was also Dumuzi's "sister." They nourished and comforted each
other; they delighted in each other; they shared each other's days and nights.
When Inanna and Geshtinanna meet on the streets of Uruk, the two sides of
the feminine—passion and compassion, willfulness and feeling—meet. But
mourning and suffering have subdued Inanna's raging passion; and Gesh
tinanna's words awaken her nurturing, compassionate side.
Throughout the Cycle of Inanna there has been an intense relationship
between the heavenly sister and brother, Inanna and Utu, as well as between
the earthly sister and brother, Geshtinanna and Dumuzi. Both brothers acted
as sexual initiators and protectors for their sisters; 33 both sisters relied upon
and supported their brothers. In heaven, the sky gods, Utu and Inanna, com
plement each other; Utu, the Sun God, rules the sky by day, Inanna, the
Morning Star and Evening Star (known to us as the planet Venus), rules the
sky at dawn and twilight. On earth, Dumuzi and Geshtinanna share the yearly
planting cycle.
The sister-brother couples are first drawn together in "The Huluppu
Tree" when Inanna asks the earth hero, Gilgamesh, to help her. Later, in "The
Courtship," it is Utu who suggests Dumuzi as a fitting consort for his heavenly
sister. Surprisingly, it is the sky gods Inanna and Utu who initiate the relation
ship with their earthly counterparts.
After the marriage of Inanna and Dumuzi, there is a reversal of roles. The
immortal Queen of Heaven descends into the earth and dies; while the mortal
Dumuzi ascends his throne, striving, much like a sky deity, for greater power
and glory. This reversal is then turned about when Inanna condemns Dumuzi
to enter the underworld. Because of this reversal, the humbled earthly brother
and sister seek help from the sky deities. Dumuzi appeals to Utu to save him
from the demons and Geshtinanna appeals to Inanna to find her brother. The
cross-tie of marriage between Inanna and Dumuzi provides the link that opens
up new relationships between brother and brother and sister and sister.
Geshtinanna's transcendent words of compassion stir Inanna from her
state of isolation and self-pity. Just as her older widowed sister, Ereshkigal, had
been moved by the compassionate words of her healers; so, too, the widowed
Inanna is touched by the warmth of her earthly sister. And she, too, grants her
healer a boon: she releases Dumuzi from her angry curse and allows Gesh
33 In The Sacred Marriage Rite, Kramer includes a poem in which Dumuzi initiates his sister in the sheepfold, p. 103.
166



tinanna to share his fate. The favors are returned from the sky deities to their
earthly sister and brother.
In her youth, Inanna's contact with her earthly brother, Gilgamesh, pro
pelled her into life, activity, and achievement. Later, her journey to the under
world connected her with the buried, rejected pans of herself. Now it is the
presence of her earthly sister, Geshtinanna, that completes Inanna's journey
on earth. Through Geshtinanna, Inanna is reconnected to Dumuzi, to an other,
and so to all of life.
The two "sisters" are led by the "holy" fly to the lost brother. The
bloodless fly, that part of nature so seemingly without import or substance, is
yet alive and, like all of life, craves a fate and meaning. It demands a boon from
Inanna. In response, Inanna draws into her story those who also seek meaning:
the people of Sumer. Inanna grants the fly permanent residence in the taverns
and access to the culture of Sumer, which, most likely, flows with the beer and
wine. As a result of Inanna's boon, the high talk of the wise ones is to be
accompanied by the tiny buzzing of the lowliest of living creatures—a constant
remainder that it was the lowliest of creatures who, by its connection to the
realms of death, was able to reunite their king and goddess.
At Arali, a stopping place on the way to the Great Below, Inanna takes Dumuzi's hand and blesses Dumuzi and Geshtinanna with both eternal life and
death. The loving sister is given her request: she will comfort her brother and
share his fate. But she will not be able to unite with her brother on earth.
Dumuzi is to remain Inanna's husband. The once seemingly surprising and yet
vital relationship between sky goddess and earthly hero can now be more fully
understood. The union of opposite realms—that of the fixed, willful, judgmen
tal aspects of the sky deities with the ever-changing, emotional aspects of earthly
mortals—brings about greater personal integration for individuals as well as
greater prosperity and fertility for the gods and the community of Sumer.
Half the year the goddess Inanna and the king Dumuzi will be united;
and half the year they will be separated. For half the year, Dumuzi will actively
rule over Sumer. He will join Inanna on the sacred marriage bed, a ritual all
Sumer will join in celebrating (see Hymn Seven). The milk will flow in the
sheepfold, the wheat will ripen, the apple trees will blossom. But then, as the
seasons change and the harvest passes, Dumuzi will enter a period of inactivity,
quietude, and meditation. He will surrender his worldly powers, constructs,
and conventions. He will become a part of the stasis—of that which ineluctably
"is." He will return to Ereshkigal.
The force that through the green fuse drives the flower Drives my green age; that blasts the roots of trees
Is my destroyer. 34
}4 Dylan Thomas, op. cit.. p. 10.
167



The choice of a period of six months as the time of separation is probably
related to the concomitant agricultural cycle, in which Geshtinanna, "root
stock of the grapevine," 35 reigns over the wine whose grapes and figs are
harvested from the Sumerian earth each autumn: while Dumuzi, in his aspect
of Damu, the power in the growing grain, reigns over the beer, whose barley
grows in the earth the other six months of the year, to be harvested in the
spring.
Paradoxically, although Dumuzi seems to be separated from Inanna six
months of the year, he is actually wed to her all year, for in the winter as he
rests with Ereshkigal, he is staying with the dark, instinctual side of Inanna.
Since Dumuzi is married to the composite goddess Inanna-Ereshkigal, he is to
experience all of the woman. Not only is he to "know" the love goddess, he
is to "know" the Goddess of Death as well. To live with the light side of the
goddess half the year and the dark side the other half would seem to require
superhuman powers; and indeed, when the king Dumuzi weds Inanna, the title
of deity is affixed to his name. With Inanna's proclamation, Dumuzi's marriage
takes on a sacrificial nature. But as the spiritual king of his people, this is
justified. Dumuzi, King of Sumer, is to live in a perpetual state of initiation.
The spiritual awakening of man, according to Inanna's proclamation, is to be
required of the king.
At this moment at the end of the story, when Inanna acts as divine
ordainer, she shifts from active participant in her life story to constellated
divinity. She who opened up for the first time the passage between the con
scious and the unconscious now retreats, giving over the task to the more
human participators, Dumuzi and Geshtinanna. They are now responsible for
keeping open the passage from the Great Above to the Great Below.
Inanna's journey to the underworld has brought a new world order to
Sumer. The ramifications of her proclamation are manifold. By giving Dumuzi
eternal life half the year, Inanna changes the cosmic pattern. Love, which
parallels the normal course of the human life cycle—budding, blooming, and
dying—is henceforth guaranteed, by being linked to the seasons, an annual
renewal. The king who enters the underworld once a year will emerge every
six months renewed in feminine wisdom and inner strength to take over the
leadership and vitality of the nation. Moreover, by alternating the descent
between sister and brother, feminine and masculine, the women and men of
Sumer (at least in ritual) share in the necessary journey into and out of the mountain.
Inanna's establishing of the annual ritual of descent and ascent offers a
model of parity to the female-male relationship. Acknowledging the duality
of life dying into death and death leading into life gives the participants in the
3,Jacobsen, Treasures of Darkness , pp. 62-3.
168



ritual the opportunity of annually renewing their relationships to the cosmos, to each other, and to their goddess.
But none must forget that the wisdom of Inanna's decree and its manifold
ramifications have been attained for all of Sumer by Inanna's response to,
journey toward, and encounter with the fierce, forbidding, and terrifying
queen, Ereshkigal—Inanna's other self. "For whoever has not known himself
has known nothing, but whoever has known himself has simultaneously achieved knowledge about the depths of all things." 36
Holy Ereshkigal! Great is your renown!
Holy Ereshkigal! I sing your praises!
Seven Hymns to Inanna
In the beginning of time, the universe was divided into three realms:
heaven, earth, and the underworld. Inanna's journey through these realms as
related in "The Descent" describes a soul's ripenings. When she returns from
her journeys below to her place of origin in heaven, she is a completed soul
and, as such, Inanna comes into her divinity.
The hymns to Inanna acknowledge her myriad achievements and aspects.
She is radiant, thundering, destructive, defiant, judgmental, kind, generous,
peaceful, healing, erotic, decisive, discerning, wise, transcendent, loving, fer
tile, joyous, and ever youthful. Parts of Inanna's characteristics can be seen to
have emerged from her encounters with the bold, decisive hero Gilgamesh,
the wise, form-making Enki, the fertile, erotic, eager young shepherd Dumuzi,
the powerful, authoritative King Dumuzi, the just, all-seeing Utu, as well as
with the "fixed," judgmental Ereshkigal and the generous, compassionate
Geshtinanna. But the fullness of Inanna's being goes beyond these separate
aspects. Inanna is the Goddess of Love. Formed from all of life, the Goddess
of Love gives forth desire that generates the energy of the universe.
The seven hymns, known as the Iddin-Dagan Hymns, included in this
cycle are attempts by the Sumerian temple poet to reveal Inanna's glory and
to come close to, as well as to attract, the Goddess of Love, so that she will
descend once again from heaven to earth. The first six hymns may have been
recited on varying occasions. W. W. Hallo writes that the hymns to Sumerian
deities and kings may have been created for dedications of new temples or
statues or at festivals involving public processions of statues. 37 The seventh

169



hymn clearly was recited in celebration of King Iddin-Dagan's divine union
with the goddess Inanna. Although the names of specific instruments do not
introduce the different hymns in this composition, string instruments and
drums such as are noted in the third and seventh hymns often accompany the
recitation. It seems likely that the antiphon or refrain that occurs in the last
four hymns of this composition would have been accompanied by one or
several instruments.
/. THE HOLY PRIESTESS OF HEAVEN The first hymn to Inanna is a greeting. Her radiance and light are wel
comed from afar. As the daughter of the Moon God, Nanna, she belongs to
the sky deities, who are worshipped for their awesome power, consciousness,
majesty, and transcendence.
2. LOUD THUNDERING STORM By means of a monthly ritual, the second hymn to Inanna changes the
perspective of the worshipper from that of a distant bystander to that of a
"captured" participant.
In the first twelve lines, all that is mysterious, awesome, and beyond
human control or knowledge—both in the external world of the raging storm
and in the internal world of the emotions of the heart—is likened to the
persona of Inanna.
Unfortunately, the fifty lines that connect the passionate, destructive,
troubled Inanna to the composed, magnanimous, and all-knowing Inanna are
not decipherable. When the text begins again fifty lines later, "the crescent
moon reaches its fullness." The implicit comparison between the wild, terrify
ing Inanna and the dark of the moon suggests that they were both accepted
and viewed by the Sumerians as mysterious, awesome, and uncontrollable
parts of life. Yet both in heaven and on earth, dark and frightening moments
are followed by calm and order: the moon in the heavens grows, lessens,
disappears, but then takes its form on the seventh day of each month; the
earthly woman, who often experiences a disequilibrium at the start of her
menstrual period, finishes the disorder of her cycle on the seventh day of the
month. By joining the menstrual cycle to the moon's cycle in a monthly ritual,
the wild, frightening, and disorderly parts of life are subsumed into a predicta
ble and reassuring order.
Thus the moment each month when the crescent moon took its shape was a time of great import for Sumer, for it symbolized the time when the raging
Inanna purified herself and assumed her role as divine woman, wife to Dumuzi,
the King of Sumer, and guide to her people. It meant that the inchoate time
of chaos and instinct had ended, and that form was to be reestablished.
170



Once Inanna takes up the me, the holy form of things, she assumes her
destined role, and her spiritual force moves from the wild and unpredictable
"heart" to the all-knowing and all-seeing "eye." So, too, the animals, people,
and gods who are governed by their uncontrollable instincts go before their
queen in order to discover their own form and destiny. What they discover
is the experience of being linked to the "eye" or inner light of their goddess.
The incredible energy of the storming goddess, now brought into the social
order, emanates with such luminosity and intensity that the people are cap
tured and lifted into a state of "greater light." This spiritual impulse is given
grounding in the many forms of expression (from specific vocations to such
abstract pursuits as "truth" or "the art of kindness") offered in the holy me.
3. THE HOLY ONE The third hymn releases the worshipper from a state of "captivity" to a
more equitable relationship with the goddess. With a devotional ceremony or
parade, the people of Sumer honor their goddess. They praise her with music
and dress; by initiatory sacrifice, they both release and rejoin themselves to her
"light."
In the parade, the women and men wear androgynous clothing, symbolic
of the Goddess of Love, who exists as the opposite sex in each person. By
adorning one side of themselves with the clothing of the opposite sex, both
women and men "create" themselves in the image of their goddess. The
various activities— both sexes eagerly entering the moving circle of the jump
ropes, the men singers carrying the feminine hoop, and the cultic group of
female priests, carrying the masculine double-edged ax and sword—all exem
plify the desire of experiencing the fullness of the self.
As the colorful procession nears Inanna, who most likely is seated in the
form of the high priestess at the top of the temple steps, one priest destroys
the wholeness of life by offering blood before the holy priestess. One can
imagine that as the blood is given the pulsating beat of the music suddenly
stops in anticipation. But it begins again almost immediately with the tinkling
tambourine. The ecstatic sacrifice, expressing the offer of the population to
give their life to their goddess, who gives them life, has been accepted.
This seemingly miraculous appearance of Inanna in her heavenly aspect
is most likely timed to the appearance of the Evening Star in the darkness.
Inanna's heavenly manifestation, akin to the rainbow in the sky after a storm, marks the goddess's promise to Sumer to guide and watch over her people as
a divine shepherdess would watch over her sheep. From this moment of
exchange between mortal and goddess, the refrain—"My Lady looks in sweet
wonder from heaven"—begins and continues throughout the hymns in this
cycle. The refrain heralds the bond forged between the goddess and her
171



people, which by the act of sacrifice and its acceptance has become a physical
blood tie as well as an abstract visual one.
4. THE LADY OF THE EVENING
5 THE Li DY OF THE MORNING
6. THE LADY WHO ASCENDS INTO THE HLiVENS The next three hymns celebrate the daily relationship between the Queen
of Heaven and her followers. In Hymns Four and Five, Inanna, the Lady of
the Evening and the Lady of the Morning, is a manifestation of a stable,
dependable cosmic order that divides, organizes, and guides life's activities.
Twice daily Inanna gives to her followers what is appropriate.
At twilight, the Lady of the Evening's radiant light guides the people and
creatures of Sumer to their place of rest and love. The westerly sunset images
of Hymn Four center on the feminine Inanna: night, animals, gardens, reeds,
food, rest, lovemaking. At dawn, the Lady of the Morning's clarity of light
reveals and settles the proper judgments in society, so that the people of Sumer
can direct their energies toward their day's work. The sunrise images of Hymn
Five are grouped around the masculine Inanna: dawn, judgment, thought,
action, abstractions. Together, Hymns Four and Five create a dependable
order, a personalized deity, composed of clearly feminine and masculine char
acteristics.
Another side of Inanna is the Lady Who Ascends into the Heavens. The
Inanna of Hymn Six is feared by her people. This Inanna belongs to the
emerging-dissolving epiphany of existence, the awesome miracle of rebirth,
for she appears when the sky is empty and dark. In the moment of terror
between day and night, when there is nothing, when all seems lost and void,
then Inanna, the first one to brave the empty skies, appears.
In return for Inanna's different manifestations of light, the people offer
her appropriate gifts. For her guidance by day and night, they kneel before
her, singing her praise and offering her cooked food. For her miraculous
presence, they bring Inanna the scent of life— incense—as well as the signs of
divine life—every kind of raw and cooked food.
The people who parade before the three Inannas sing her praises, for they
yearn to fulfill their own feminine and masculine natures, as well as to come
close to the Goddess of Love, the transcendent force of life, which permeates
all of existence. And Inanna, confirming her continuing relationship with the
people of Sumer, partakes of their gifts and appears to them morning and
evening on the horizon, the meeting place of heaven and earth:
My Lady looks in sweet wonder from heaven. The people of Sumer parade before the holy Inanna.
172



Inanna, the Lady Who Ascends into the Heavens, is radiant.
I sing your praises, holy Inanna. The Lady Who Ascends into the Heavens is radiant on the horizon.
7. THE JOY OF SUMER
Hymn Seven is the culmination of the seasonal, monthly, and daily ties
created between Inanna and Sumer. In Hymn One, Inanna, solitary and sepa
rate, is greeted from a great distance. In Hymn Two, the people of Sumer are
raised into a relationship with their goddess, a relationship which, in Hymn
Three, is formed by their act of sacrifice and its acceptance. By Hymns Four,
Five, and Six, Inanna is in constant relationship with her people. And in Hymn
Seven, she descends from heaven to enter into direct union with the people
of Sumer through their earthly king, Dumuzi.
Inanna's descent is needed to set in motion the annual cycle of life on
earth. According to the me, which dictate the order and form of things, a New
Year's Day is ordained that marks the earth's awakening to new life. All year
the people have brought their goddess tribute in the form of plants and
animals, her creations. But now, when the earth is ready to be seeded, to bring
forth plants which will give the people the holy power of life, and when the
new moon has just been reborn, the divine spark is needed once again. The
mystery of human life, connected to the mystery of natural life, dwells with
the Goddess of Love. It is she who brings fertility to all things. The sacred bed,
strewn with her holy plants and designed with her symbol of the lion, is thus
carefully prepared to entice the Queen of Heaven to earth.
After making love, both Inanna and Dumuzi shine with inner joy.
Inanna's cosmic light, which shines from the heavens all year, this day appears
on earth. The king invites the people to join in their happiness. The king,
queen, musicians, and people celebrate with feasting and singing. The magic
moment is upon them: male and female, heaven and earth, mortal and divine
have united and a new year has begun. The spirit of love has descended and
is reborn on earth. The king acknowledges the source of the people's and the
gods' delight:
Mighty, majestic, radiant, and ever youthful To you, Inanna, I sing!

ANNOTATIONS OF THE ART
by Elizabeth Williams-Forte
Inanna's City: Uruk
Inanna's city, Uruk—modern Warka—lies 150 miles (250 km.) southeast
of Baghdad and 12 miles (20 km.) from the Euphrates, a branch of which
skirted the ancient city known in the Bible as Erech. Systematic excavations
have been conducted at Uruk for over fifty years by a German archaeological
expedition and have uncovered levels of occupation dating from the fourth
through the first millennium B.C. By far the most important for our knowledge
of the goddess Inanna and of ancient Sumerian civilization, however, are the
levels dating to c. 3500-2900 B.C. These levels (VI— III ) provide evidence of
the earliest known urban civilization, characterized by the first truly monumen
tal temple architecture and art and by the first writing.
A complex, class-stratified society must have administered the building of
these architectural complexes and imported the materials, such as stone and
metal, that were not available locally but were transformed by specialized
craftsmen into cult statues and vessels, tools and weapons. Although the pro
cesses that led to the transition to urban life in Mesopotamia are believed to
have begun several centuries prior to the so-called Uruk period, the appear
ance of the hallmarks of civilization at Uruk is sudden and evokes the story
of the me that Inanna took from Enki and Eridu to bring back to her people
in Uruk.
The sacred place of Inanna, the Queen of Heaven, is called Eanna, the
"House of Heaven," and is the oldest preserved temple on the site of Uruk.
In level V-IVb at Uruk appears a complex of enormous temples that exhibit
the characteristic features of all later Mesopotamian temple architecture: mud
brick construction with elaborate niche decoration, a three-part plan composed
of two aisles flanking a nave, and at the end of the nave, the "Holy of Holies."
The largest of these temples, over 30 by 80 meters in size, possesses a lime
stone base—an unusual and lavish feature in a region where mud bricks are
174



the common building material and stone is rare.
A smaller shrine of mud brick lies at a right angle to and across a court
from the "Limestone Temple." Covering the mud-brick walls of the court is
a distinctive mosaic-like decoration formed of individual baked clay cones. The
heads of the clay cones are dipped in red, black, and yellowish-white paint,
then thrust into the mud substructure of the wall to create textile-like geomet
ric patterns. Above the court and adjacent to the temples stands a hall com
posed of two rows of the earliest examples of free-standing columns, each over
2 meters in diameter and also decorated with the colorful clay cones.
Within these temple complexes and the successive temples built on the
same holy ground over a period of several centuries were found the first
cylinder seals and clay tablets bearing the first writing, characteristic features
of Mesopotamian civilization until the first millennium B.C. Cylinder seals
small tubes of stone with designs carved upon their cylindrical surface—were
rolled in wet clay used to seal storage jars and to make clay tablets. Numerous
cylinder seal impressions on pieces of clay used to seal vessels were found in
the Limestone Temple and nearby buildings. Two methods were employed to
secure these vessels: wet clay was either packed into the mouth of the vessel
or it was pressed over a knotted string used to secure a piece of cloth or leather
that covered the jar. The cylinder seal was then handrolled in several direc
tions over the clay to form unbroken friezelike designs that served with the
clay plug to secure the jar's contents.
In a slightly later level at Uruk were found clay tablets bearing seal
impressions, numerals, and then the first writing, pictographic in form. These
very first written documents were tallies and records of the administration of
the temple, which served as the center of Sumerian economic, industrial, and
religious life. Writing probably developed as a means to keep track of the
economic activities of the temple, providing documents of the number of
sheep, the amount of barley, and the like that were brought to the temple by
the farmers and shepherds, then redistributed to them and the remainder of
the populace of Uruk by the temple managers.
Cylinder seals also may have served an economic function. For the surface
designs of the cylinder seals produced complex non-duplicatable impressions
on the clay jar sealings and tablets, showing animals, mythological creatures,
and ritual scenes involved with the cult of Inanna. The seal-impressed clay thus
provided the temple officials with a sure means of determining if temple goods
had been tampered with, and may also have served to identify the vessels'
contents or owners. The impression of a seal on a table probably legitimized
the transaction recorded there either in numerals or pictographic script by the
temple official who witnessed the transaction in the name of the goddess.
Indeed, if only indirectly, the symbols of Inanna must have alluded to the
175



goddess as the ultimate source of all the goods and thus of the economic
activities of the temple, and must also have provided a potent apotropaic,
protective function for both the tablets and temple goods on which they
appeared.
The ritual significance of the seals is evidenced by the scenes engraved
upon them, showing Inanna's gatepost and rosette symbols and perhaps Inanna
herself in human form (page 27), her temple, and her sacred flocks and herds
(page v). Other impressions depict the "man in the net skirt," probably the
en or lord of Uruk (page 85). This figure's responsibilities as the priest who
assumes the role of the goddess's consort and as the king who becomes the
temporary war leader are portrayed: he performs sacred rites before Inanna's
temple (page 106) and views prisoners or slaves bound hand and foot before
him. Vases and sculpture in relief and in the round found at Uruk were
probably also central to the cult of the goddess. The vases embellished with
relief sculpture and stone inlay in rosette form must have been for use in the
temple.
The most important vessel, known as the "Warka Vase," was carved with
three registers of relief, the top showing Inanna in human form, or perhaps
her priestess, before her temple receiving offerings brought by the en of Uruk
(page 104). The riches of the land are brought to the goddess on this vessel,
just as they may have been deposited before her image in the sanctuary of her
temple. Fragmentary remains of enormous cult images of the goddess may
have been found at Uruk in the form of two stone sculptures of female faces.
These imposing visages, one of alabaster, the other of gypsum, may have been
joined to bodies of some perishable material like wood and embellished with
precious metals and fine garments.
Thus the inhabitants of ancient Uruk provided their patron goddess,
Inanna, whom they envisioned in human form, with all the necessities of their
own lives but on a grander scale. For her they built a "House of Heaven"
enriched by bright colors, adorned with sculpture, and laden with vessels filled
with produce recorded in detail by the temple scribes— in gratitude for the
gifts of civilization, the me. which Inanna had brought to them from Eridu and
which the excavations have revealed within her sacred city, Uruk.
I would like to thank Dominique Collon of the British Museum and
Franoois Tallon of the Louvre for their help in expediting the photographs of
the illustrations.
With only a few exceptions, the ancient artifacts chosen to illustrate the
stories and hymns of Inanna derive from the region and general era in which
these myths originate—that is, ancient Mesopotamia during the late fourth
through early second millennium B.C. Certain photographs show only a detail
176



or a motif excerpted from a larger work of an in order to more clearly
elucidate the relationship between image and text. The use of such details is
noted in the documentary information that precedes each commentary. Spe
cific details regarding place and date of origin, dimensions, and other informa
tion have been included in the art commentaries when available. Full biblio

ii Inanna with Date Palm
Fragment of a relief vessel inscribed to Entemena of Lagash. Mesopo
tamia. Early Dynastic period, c. 2400 B.C. Basalt. Berlin, Staatliche
Museen
An enthroned goddess gazes benignly out at the viewer from this
fragment of relief from a vessel inscribed to King Entemena of La
gash. On her head is a horned crown flanked by feathers. On top of
the crown is a small frontal face. Heavy masses of hair fall around the
goddess's face and over her shoulders, ending in spiral curls. She
grasps a date cluster, and stalks surmounted by blossom-like forms
grow from her shoulders. These attributes suggest that she is a vegeta
tion goddess.
Her frontal visage and the dates she holds might suggest that she
is Inanna as the goddess of the date storehouse, her original title and
significance according to Thorkild Jacobsen. If so, perhaps the blos
soms are the rosettes of Inanna, and the small face, bird feathers, and
talons on her crown those of Anzu, the lion-headed thunder-bird that
Jacobsen maintains is also her emblem. The Anzu-bird that made its
home in the summit of the huiuppu- tree to Inanna's dismay, and that
coveted the me eventually won by Inanna, may appear here as the tamed opponent now an embellishment of her holy crown.

Lambs issue from either side of a sheepfold bearing the doorpost
symbols of Inanna, marking these sheep as the property of the god
177



dess and her temple. The sheep that crawl from Inanna's sheepfold
(a pictographic sign that also represents the vulva) are always young
animals and thus may be symbolically "born" from the womb of this
goddess of fertility.
The Hullupu -Tree
3 Woman, Goddtss, and Date Palm
Cylinder seal (impression). Mesopotamia. Akkad period, c. 23302150 B.C. Green schist. London, The British Museum, BM 892360
A date palm is flanked by two seated figures wearing long gar
ments. To the left appears a female figure, with her hair held up by
a headband. Her mirror image, the figure opposite her, is identified
as a deity by its horned crown. Each figure gestures (with upturned
palm) toward the tree between them. From beneath the throne of the
divine being writhes an upright serpent.
Although the huluppu- tree may have been a willow, the most
frequently represented tree in Mesopotamian art is the date palm. The
date palm was an important economic source for the ancient
Mesopotamians. Its fruit is of great nutritional value and can be
preserved and stored; its leaves, fiber, and timber provide numerous
by-products; and it survives easily in the salty soil and water of
Mesopotamia. These factors, together with the fact that the date palm
requires the services of a horticulturalist in pollination if a substantial
crop of dates is to be harvested, must explain its frequent appearance
in Mesopotamian texts and art.
Inanna herself, according to Thorkild Jacobsen, is called "Lady
of the Date Clusters" and represents the numen of the communal
storehouse for the dates. Her spouse, Dumuzi, called Amaushum
galanna, "The one great source of the date clusters," is personified
in the enormous bud that the date palm sprouts each year—the source
of the leaves, flowers, and fruit. In Sumerian art, the date palm stands
before deities and is the focus of libations and, perhaps, symbolic
ritual fertilizations (see page 9).

Parrot, Sumer, pi. 169.

On this vessel fragment a kneeling male figure and a horned
animal flank a hatched panel that probably represents the trunk of a
palm tree. At the base of the tree, which seems to separate the cul
tivated garden from the wilderness, appear two saplings. The sapling
to the right is possibly being planted by the male figure. The animal
seems to prepare to trample or perhaps graze upon the second sprout.
In the field around the animal to the right appear other perhaps
herbivorous creatures. To the left an undulating serpent rises as if to
strike at the underbelly of the kneeling man. Framing this scene is a
wavy band and a guilloche, which may symbolize the water that
nurtures the vegetal and animal life that appears above.
Such vessels formed of easily carvable stone, such as steatite or
chlorite, are found at third millennium B.C. sites stretching from
eastern Iran to the Gulf and throughout Mesopotamia to the north
Syrian site of Mari, where this fragment was found.
Lilitb
Clay plaque. Mesopotamia. Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period, c.
2000-1600 B.C. Baked clay. Paris, Louvre, AO 6501
A nude, winged, bird-footed goddess wears a crown composed
of multiple horns. Her gaze directly engages the attention of the
viewer as she stands frontally, with both hands uplifted, palms facing
outward. Beneath her taloned feet appear two horned animals back
to back.
A demonic composite being, part-bird, part-human, is repre
sented on this clay plaque. Her delicately modeled nude body is
juxtaposed with powerfully clawed bird feet and wings that fall be
hind her like an open veil. She has been identified as the dark maid
Lilith, called "screech owl" in a biblical passage (Isaiah XXIV: 14).
Like that nocturnal bird, Lilith makes her home in the trunk of a tree,
the buluppu- tree of Inanna.
Snake with Interlacing Coil
Cylinder seal. Ur, Mesopotamia. The Royal Cemetery, Early Dynastic
Period, c. 2600-2500 B.C. Lapis lazuli. Iraq Museum. Photograph courtesy of the British Museum, Ul 9080.
The majority of the pictorial surface is covered with the inter
lined coils of a serpent, forming a lattice pattern. To the right its tail
179



appears below the coils and its head above, with a bird perched upon
it.
Two snakes intertwined rather than one are shown on earlier
representations of this motif. Snakes twist themselves together in this
fashion when mating, suggesting this symbol's association with fertil
ity.
The close relationship between snakes and tree roots has been
pointed out by Thorkild Jacobsen, especially in connection with the
chthonic god Ningishzida, "Lord of the Good Tree," whose symbol
is the serpent. The underground source of the tree's life, its roots,
become the writhing serpent emblem of the anthropomorphic god.
On this seal, the entwined serpent perhaps represents the subterra
nean sphere in which the tree's winding roots exist and to which the
snake returns to hibernate, just as the snake made its home in the roots
of the huluppu- tree.

Enthroned Goddess, God. and Date Palms
Stele of Ur-Nammu. Ur, Mesopotamia. (Two details from stele are
set facing each other.) Third Dynasty of Ur, c. 2050-1950 B.C. Lime
stone. Philadelphia, the University Museum, University of Pennsyl
vania Photograph taken from Andre Parrot, Sumer, pis. 282-283.
King Ur-Nammu, identified by the inscription on this stele,
pours a libation over a date palm planted in a vessel placed before a
goddess on the left, and repeats the libation before a god on the right
of this relief. Each deity wears the multiple-horned miter and flounced
robe characteristic of divinity and sits upon a throne in the form of
a temple. The goddess gestures toward the king with upraised hand,
while the god extends the "rod and ring" toward the libating figure.
King Ur-Nammu, the founder of a dynasty that initiated a revival
of traditional Sumerian culture in southern Mesopotamia, is shown on
this relief (one of five, each 3 meters high), performing his pious
180



duties to the god and goddess of Ur: Nanna, the Moon God, and his
spouse, Ningal. The king's role as "gardener" responsible for nurtur
ing vegetation by his union with the goddess may be symbolized by
this action.
The rod and ring extended to Ur-Nammu by the god have been
interpreted as a measuring rod and line, to be used in laying out the
plan of Nanna's temple, for the building of the Moon God's shrine
is portrayed on another register of this relief. These implements may
also be emblems of kingship, like the pukku and the mikku fashioned
by Inanna for Gilgamesh.
Inanna and the God of Wisdom
11 Flowing Vases
Fragment of relief. Tello (Girsu), Mesopotamia. Gudea period, c.
2144-2124 B.C. Limestone, h. 15.5 cm.; w. 11. 7 cm. Paris, Louvre. Photograph taken from Andre Parrot, Sumer, pi. 243.
On this fragment of relief "flowing vases" appear. Two streams
of water gush from each vase to intermingle with those issuing from
its neighbor. The flowing vase is the symbol of Enki and also of
abundance, like the cornucopia. The two streams may represent the
two major rivers of Mesopotamia, the Euphrates and the Tigris. A
Sumerian text discussed by Samuel Noah Kramer relates that the
Tigris was formed by the semen of Enki.
13 Enki in the Abzu receiving Isimud
Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Akkad period, c. 2330-2150 B.C. Black serpentine. 30 X 19 cm. New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, Cor
pus 202
The god Enki holds his emblem, the vase from which flow two
streams of water. The corners of his sacred chamber are embellished
by spiraling volutes, perhaps evoking the watery nature of the Abzu where Enki made his home. Before the God of Wisdom stands his
minister, Isimud, whose two faces look in opposite directions. The
doorposts grasped by two nude heroes frame the scene and designate
the entrance to the Abzu. As an acolyte of the Water God, Enki, the
nude hero frequently holds a flowing vase or, as here, a doorpost. The
association of the doorpost with Enki may allude to his role as the
patron of foundations.

14, 15 Banquet Cylinder seal (upper and lower impression). Ur, Mesopotamia. The
Royal Cemetery, c. 2500 B.C. Lapis lazuli. 48 X 25 mm. London, The British Museum, U 10939
Lifting their cups to each other, a ritually bald male figure sits
opposite a female figure. Servants stand before and behind the enth
roned banqueters, whose importance is indicated by their size.
As related in this text, journeys of the gods to holy cities to visit
relatives or patrons frequently culminated in banquets. Whether the
banquets represented here depict such a divine symposium is difficult
to determine because none of the participants wear the emblem of
divinity, the horned crown. However, this seal was inscribed to a
Queen of Ur, Pu-abi (Shubad), within whose grave it was found.
Thus the banquet shown here may depict some type of annual festival
in which the queen or a priestess participated, perhaps in the guise
of a goddess.

B.C. Steatite, h. 16 mm.; d. 7 mm. Brooklyn, New York, The Brook
lyn Museum, L 71.21.10
A flat-bottomed boat with inward-curving prow and stern floats
upon zigzag lines, probably symbolic of flowing water. The round
form with netlike markings that surmounts the boat may be a canopy
or hut for either passengers or storage. Reeds indicative of the marsh
like environment along the rivers in southern Mesopotamia flank the
boat.
21 Seven-Headed Monster

Akkad period, c. 2350-2150 B.C. Gray stone. 3.2 X 2.2 cm. Iraq Museum.
Seven snake heads with forked tongues characterize this dragon

This demonic hybrid creature is formed of human, leonine, and
serpentine characteristics. It has a frontal masklike face and human
torso. The lower body is composed of two lions whose tails have
serpent heads that bite at the creature's head and are grasped by its
human arms.
23 Running Monster

A kneeling composite creature, with one leg uplifted as if run
ning, is shown on this seal. Its spiky arms terminate in lion heads,
while its head is formed of a single large eye surmounted by two
hornlike projections.
25 Reed Boat Approaches City Shrine

A reed boat is directed, punted, and paddled to a temple by three
bald, ritually nude male figures. On the shore, a shrine facade stands
between two pillars composed of reed bundles topped by three pairs
of rings. These "ring-bundles" may be the emblem of a male god, perhaps Dumuzi, based on their appearance elsewhere on cattle byres
(another symbol of that deity), just as the doorpost with streamer
emblem of Inanna appears above sheepfolds.

Gifts associated with the goddess and with the figure in the net
skirt, probably her consort, appear in the hands of offering bearers to
the right. The first carries a long, beaded belt or necklace; the second
has hands clasped in prayer; and the third carries the long belt worn
by the net-skirted figure in other scenes.
27 City Shrine Surrounded by Signs of Inanna: The Rosettes, her Face, and Her Gate

The surface of the seal is divided horizontally by an arched line.
Beneath it appears a temple, flanked by two gateposts. Evenly spaced
above the temple in the upper register are two eight-petaled rosettes,
the flower or star symbol of the goddess Inanna. Above the arch,
where its two ends meet in a V-shaped, chinlike form, is a face. The
face is dominated by an enormous pair of oval eyes above a round
nose and oval mouth. Similar enormous oval eyes in association with
rosettes appear on a vessel excavated at Uruk in the sacred precinct
of Inanna—Eanna, the House of Heaven.
The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi
29 Man and Woman
Clay plaque. Diqdiqqah near Ur (U 17604), Mesopotamia. Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period, c. 2000-1600 B.C. Baked clay. London, The British Museum, BM 123230
A god and goddess stand facing frontally with arms around each
other's waist. Each wears a horned crown, the emblem of divinity, and
a flounced robe that leaves one shoulder bare. Their faces are care
fully modeled and their expressions dignified. The goddess's hair is
held up in a chignon, while the god's falls into heavy curls alongside
his long beard.
Between two trees growing from mountain-like forms appear
two horned animals, one above the other in the field. The animal on
top rests, with its legs tucked beneath its body; below, the second
creature appears to kneel, perhaps to drink from a brook indicated by
the slightly undulating line beneath its snout.

This fragmentary terracotta plaque shows three standards sur
mounted by orbs, the upper parts of which are missing, with a central
drilling. Such orb standards are often interpreted as solar emblems,
symbolic of the Sun God, Utu. Between the standards appear two
long-necked birds before two stalks of vegetation.

Inanna stands in full regalia on this terracotta plaque. Her
crown is adorned with multiple horns of divinity, her body with the
divine garment of flounced material. Around her neck she wears
multiple-beaded necklaces. In her outstretched hand she holds the emblem composed of a mace flanked by heads of lions, her sacred
animal. Baked clay plaques like this were made from molds and were
thus infinitely reproducible. Such plaques bearing images of deities
may have been private devotional images, for they have been found
in the excavation of private houses at Mesopotamian sites.

Undulating lines suggestive of water or vegetation cross the
seal's surface diagonally. From each side of these diagonal motifs
sprout small, branchlike lines. Near them are randomly placed oval
forms.
40 Goddess and Tree Spirit
Cylinder seal (detail of impression). Tello (Girsu), Mesopotamia.
Akkad period, c. 2330-2150 B.C. Serpentine, h. 3.5 cm.; d. 2.2 cm.
Paris, Louvre.
Beneath a tree is sheltered a kneeling goddess with her arms
outstretched to receive a god whose upper body emerges from the
base of the tree. Both deities wear miters with multiple horns indica
tive of their high rank, and the god extends a mace, an emblem of
gods and kings, to the goddess.
The deities on this seal are probably embodiments of natural
forces. The falling tree with its crown touching the ground may be
dying from the heat of the sun. The god rising from the trunk of the
dying tree would then symbolize the rebirth of vegetation, as sug
gested by Pierre Amiet.
On this seal, the poses and gestures of the anthropomorphic gods
are strikingly similar to Inanna and Dumuzi's actions in this passage
of "The Courtship": the goddess kneels with arms outstretched to
receive the god, who rises like a sprout from the tree before her. In
"The Courtship," Dumuzi rises up from fallen leaves to consummate
his marriage with the goddess, thus producing new vegetation that
pours forth from Inanna's womb. The dying of the tree in the fall and
its rebirth in the spring seem to be enacted here—just as in "The
Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi"—by divine beings whose love for
each other perpetuates fertility in the world and ensures the seasonal
cycle.
41 Star-Shaped Rosettes
Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Jemdet Nasr period, c. 3000 B.C. Chal
cedony, h. 4.2 cm.; d. 1.5 cm. Berlin, Staatliche Museen, VA 2031
A dense pattern of geometric forms covers the field of this seal.
Enormous four-pointed rosette-like stars dominate the design. Sur
186



rounding them are "Maltese crosses" and circles with central drill
ings.
This four-pointed star may be associated with Inanna, for it is
similar to the eight-pointed rosette-star that appears as her emblem.
That Inanna already in the earliest periods was considered the god
dess of the planet Venus is confirmed by an inscribed clay tablet from
Uruk, level Illb. On the tablet appear the pictographs for "festival,"
"star," "Inanna," "day," and "to set." Adam Falkenstein interprets
these signs to mean the festival on the day on which the star of Inanna
sets.
The remaining motifs may also have had a religious or protective
significance for the owner of the seal.
Lovers Embracing on Bed
Clay plaque. Mesopotamia. Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period, c.
2000-1600 B.C. Baked clay. Basel, Erlenmeyer Collection.
Short, horizontal strokes score the edge of a bed upon which lie
embracing male and female figures. The bearded man cups his part
ner's head in the palm of one hand and rests his other hand upon her
waist. The long-haired woman, her neck adorned by multiple neck
laces, encircles her companion's waist with one arm, offers him her
breast with the other, and places her foot upon his.
Such scenes are considered representations of the cult of the
sacred marriage, which took place annually in each Mesopotamian
city. The union of the city's patron god or goddess and their divine
consort ensured the prosperity of all living things in the coming year.
The actual participants in the ritual were the king of the city and the
high priestess of the temple. It is they who may be portrayed on this
small clay model of a bed.
The purpose of small clay plaques such as this is not certain. The
religious scenes they bear may have served an amuletic purpose for
the owner, providing specific magical benefits such as the protection
or blessing of certain divine beings.
Numerous lead plaques of couples making love, as well as lead
and clay plaques of scorpions, were found deposited in the vicinity of
a late second millennium B.C. temple to Inanna/Ishtar at Ashur in
northern Mesopotamia. It has been suggested that such plaques were
brought by worshippers as offerings to the temple and in some cases
taken away as tokens of worship offered there.

44-45 Inanna's Gateposts
Detail of the upper register of the "Warka Vase." Uruk (level III),
c. 3100-2900 B.C. Alabaster, h. 3 ft. Iraq Museum. Photograph cour
tesy of Hirmer Verlag, Munich.
These polelike objects are the gatepost emblems of Inanna and
appear as her symbol in both the art and the earliest pictographic
script from her city, Uruk. They most frequently appear as a pair and
are thought to designate the entrance to her temple. These emblems
are probably composed of a bundle of reeds tied with bands. Some
houses in modern Iraq are still constructed of such reed bundles. On
the basis of the ring and streamer at its summit, this emblem's ar
chitectural function has been suggested to be that of a doorpost. A
pole passing through the rings would support a mat that was lowered
to close the door, and raised and secured (perhaps by the streamer)
to allow worshippers to enter the temple.
The role of the doorpost as a kind of "sentry" guarding the
vulnerable entrance to the temple rendered it an important apo
tropaic, protective emblem in later art. Certainly, this tall emblem
with its long streamer surmounted by a round ring is evocative of the
female form, and is perhaps a sort of "totem" of the goddess Inanna,
as suggested by Adam Falkenstein.
49 Votive Statue of King
Statue of King Lamgi-Mari. Mari, North Syria. Early Dynastic period,
c. 2500 B.C. White stone, h. 27.2 cm. Aleppo Museum. Photograph
taken from W. Orthmann, ed., Der Alte Orient, pi. 30.
Lamgi-Mari, King of Mari, stands facing us with one bare foot
slightly advanced. Both hands are held at waist level, one grasping the
wrist of the other. His hair is worn parted and gathered in an elabo
rate chignon, the characteristic hairstyle of kings in the late Early
Dynastic period (c. 2600-2400 B.C.) in Mesopotamia. The priest
kings of the religious hierarchy that controlled the city-state in the late
fourth millennium B.C. gradually evolved into the kings of the third
millennium B.C., who lived in palaces, served as war leaders, and
assumed some priestly responsibilities.
This statue of King Lamgi-Mari bears a dedicatory inscription on
the shoulder not covered by the elaborate flounced robe. The inscrip
tion states that this is a votive statue, dedicated to Inanna/Ishtar,
within whose temple at Mari the statue was found. Votive statues like
188



this were surrogates for their owners, placed in the temple to offer
continuous prayers to the deity.
The Descent of Inanna From the Great Above to the Great Below
51 Goddess from the Other World
Cylinder seal. Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period, Mesopotamia, c. 2000-1600 B.C. Hematite.
An enormous winged bird-footed goddess stands frontally with
hands clasped. A double register scene appears alongside her. In the
upper register a nude goddess and a bearded deity receive homage
from human worshippers. A row of composite beings appear in the
lower register. A fly, a hedgehog (?), and a human head appear above
these creatures in the field.
This goddess with bird features has been identified with Lilith
(see page 6). She may represent the chthonic aspect of Inanna/Ishtar
derived from her association with the demonic and frequently bird
like creatures and gods that inhabit the underworld. Here, the god
dess's horned head appears alongside deities and their human wor
shippers while her bird-feet appear beside demonic creatures. The
hierarchical arrangement of this scene may signify her dual nature,
partially of "heaven and earth" and partially of the underworld.

During the period of Akkadian control of Mesopotamia (c. 2334-2154 B.C.), the early Sumerian "Lady of Heaven" and fertility
goddess Inanna merged with the Semitic Ishtar, a warrior goddess.
The goddess Inanna/Ishtar appears on this Akkadian seal, seated on
a throne decorated with two crossed lions. Weapons, including a
scimitar and a mace, rise from her shoulders as she gestures to two
worshippers and looks full-face at the viewer. Her flounced garment
covers only one shoulder, and her long hair falls in curls down to her
elbows. To the left of Inanna/Ishtar stands an attendant goddess
wearing a single-horned miter. To her right a female figure gestures
in worship and pours a libation into a vessel.

5 5 Door to the Underworld Clay plaque. Mesopotamia. Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period, 2000
1600 B.C. Baked clay. h. 6 X 5 cm. Paris, Louvre AO 9007
An open door leads into the interior of a rectangular terracotta
box that probably represents a shrine. Inside sits a bird-beaked figure,
wearing the long flounced robe characteristic of divinities.
57 Goddess in Underworld
Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Akkad period, c. 2330-2150 B.C.
Hematite, h. 3.5 cm.; d. 2.2 cm. Paris, The Louvre, AO 2485
Flanked by two forms shaped like mountains, perhaps symbolic
of the kur (the underworld), stands a frontal-facing goddess. Undulat
ing rays or flames rise from her shoulders and may indicate either her
solar or infernal nature. A ring—possibly similar to the ring that was
taken from Inanna when she entered the fifth gate of the underworld

is held in her hand.
To the right, within one mountain, a deity with rays or flames
rising from his shoulders grasps the tail of a bull-man. To the left, a
deity with a scourge stands grasping the horn of another deity who
collapses within another flaming mountain. A small figure kneels
beside the mountain to the left.

Many Mesopotamian prayers had to be spoken out loud and accompanied by specific gestures. According to Leo Oppenheim, the
190



best attested of these prayers is the type named hi- Ha, or "uplifted
hands."
On this seal, a goddess stands with an uplifted hand, perhaps
performing a similar prayer-like ritual. Uplifted hands are characteris
tic of goddesses in Mesopotamian art, especially during the Neo
Sumerian and Old Babylonian period, c. 2100-1600 B.C. Such god
desses have been identified as lama, female protective beings that Oppenheim calls "angels." These goddesses served as supplicants on
behalf of human worshippers, offering prayers for their well-being.
Goddess Pleading Before Enki
Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Akkad period, c. 2330-2150 B.C. Mar
ble, h. 3.6 cm.; d. 2.6 cm. Paris, The Louvre
A supplicating goddess of lower rank, indicated by her single
horned miter, approaches the enthroned Enki flanked by his two
faced minister Isimud and his acolyte, the nude hero. With her arm
uplifted and her hand held before her mouth, she appears as a suppli
cant to Enki.
Attacking Demons

A kneeling figure with upraised arm is attacked by demonic
creatures with leonine heads and bird feet, and by a male figure with
multiple mace and scimitar.
The exact nature of the demonic figures is difficult to determine,
but the association of birdlike beings with the nether world is com
mon in the Near East and the Aegean. The galla are described as
those "who flutter over heaven and earth" in "Dumuzi's Dream"
(see page 79), suggesting their birdlike nature. And as Henri Frank
fort has shown, soul-birds in Egypt and harpies and sirens in the
Aegean area all objectified certain aspects of terror inspired by death.
The frightening, bird-clawed monsters with gaping mouths may rep
resent similar underworld beings threatening the small cringing man
with death.

Magnesite. h. 5.3 cm.; d. 4.8 cm. Oxford, Ashmolean Museum, 1964,
744
In the lower field of this seal appear three reed cattle byres. Each
byre is surmounted by three reed pillars topped by rings, a motif that
has been suggested as symbolizing a male god, perhaps Dumuzi.
Within the huts calves or vessels appear alternately; from the sides
come calves that drink out of a vessel between them. Above each pair
of animals another small calf appears. A herd of enormous cattle
moves in the upper field.

A stag leaps with upflung leg through a wooded, mountainous
region, indicated by the twisted trees and scale pattern representing
the mountain from which it grows. A small bird is perched on a
thistle-like plant beneath the tree.
The Return
85 King Feeding Rosette Flowers to Sheep

VA 10537
A bearded male figure wears a round cap and a skirt with netlike
pattern. This man appears on many artifacts excavated at Inanna's city,
Uruk, and may represent the en, or priest-king, of that city, who
assumes the role of divine consort of Inanna in the sacred marriage
ceremony. Clasped to his chest are two curving branches ending in
rosette-flowers. These rosette symbols of Inanna are nibbled by
192



maned sheep, literally portraying the nourishment of the flocks en
sured by the union of the goddess and her consort. The emblems of
Inanna that flank the scene suggest that it is taking place within the sacred precinct of her temple.
89 Dying Man
Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Neo-Assyrian period, ninth century B.C.
Serpentine. 42 X 19 mm. Toronto, Canada, Lands of the Bible Archaeology Foundation, Royal Ontario Museum
A sick or dying man lies beneath a reed hut. Attendant figures,
perhaps exorcist priests, lean above him and kneel at the head of his
bed. Sacred dogs of Gula, the Goddess of Healing, leap about the
exterior of the hut.

An enormous four-lobed, starlike rosette dominates the pictorial
field on this seal. It is surrounded by smaller rosette-stars, dotted
circles, and triangles.

Inanna/Ishtar in full regalia stands triumphantly with one foot
upon the back of her roaring lion. Her head is crowned by a headdress of multiple horns. Weapons issue from her shoulders, while enormous wings appear from behind her back, suggesting both her
martial and supernatural nature. In the sky beside her appears her
eight-pointed star, emblematic of her manifestation as the Venus star.
Another goddess wears a single-horned miter, denoting her lower
rank, and gestures in worship to the Queen of Heaven and Earth.

2. Loud Thundering Storm
94 Rain Goddess
Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Akkad period, c. 2334-2154 B.C. Shell. 33.5 X 19.5 mm. New York, Pierpont Morgan Library, Corpus 220
Inanna/Ishtar may appear on this seal in her manifestation as Rain or Thunderstorm Goddess, as suggested by Elizabeth Douglas
Van Buren. Nude except for her horned crown, she stands between
the wings of a lion-bird or griffin, probably a manifestation of the
embodiment of the thunder-bird, Anzu. Streams of rain are held by
the goddess and vomited by the lion-bird as it draws the chariot of
the Weather God, who snaps his lightning whip. The clatter of the
wooden wheels may be accompanied by the roar of the lion-bird as
thunder. This scene gives mythopoeic form to the visual phenomena
of rain, lightning, and thunder—its aural accompaniment in nature.
96 Woman and Man; Crescent, Star, and Bird
Clay plaque. Diqdiqqah, near Ur., Mesopotamia. Neo-Sumerian period (Ur III), c. 2000 B.C. Baked clay. London, The British Museum, BM 127473 (U 18496)
This baked clay plaque, found in a grave in the Diqdiqqah ceme
tery near Ur, shows a man and a woman facing each other. The
woman reaches out to rest her hand on the man's shoulder, while he
places his hand on her waist. Each wears a full, rounded coiffure and
elaborate garment. The female figure has multiple necklaces and a
flounced garment. The long beard of the male—rendered by a series
of short incisions in the clay—reaches to the border of his garment,
which crosses his body diagonally, freeing one shoulder. Below the
couple's arms is a bird; above, a moon crescent surmounted by a star.
96 Eye

An abstract design formed of parallel curving lines creates an
eyelike effect on the surface of this cylinder seal.

In this seal's upper-left register, a deity, perhaps Inanna/Ishtar,
stands upon a lion and gestures in greeting to two worshippers. The
first worshipper gestures toward the goddess; the second figure, per
haps nude, clasps its hands before its chest. Behind the goddess ap
pears another deity, wearing a multiple-horned miter and holding a
mace across its shoulder. A bare-headed figure with clasped hands
stands to the right. In the lower register appears a procession of five
worshippers identical to this bare-headed figure.

The goddess Inanna/Ishtar stands upon a dais formed of two of
her lions, back to back. She gazes serenely out at the viewer, wearing
her flounced robe and multiple-horned miter. A weapon composed
of a mace flanked by two curved blades surmounted by decorative
lion-head finials is held in her outstretched right hand. An anonymous
goddess raises her hands in supplication to the magnificent Inanna.
101 Lovers with Tambourine and Lyre
Clay plaque showing erotic scene. Larsa, Mesopotamia. Isin-Larsa
Old Babylonian period, c. 2000-1600 B.C. Beige clay. 8.0 X 6.5 cm.
Paris, Louvre, AO 16924, Barrelet 591
A couple stand back to back, either acrobatically dancing, mak
ing love, or possibly both. The male figure turns to look at his partner
while playing a lyre held to his chest. As she looks back at her
195



companion, the woman shakes a tambourine, her long hair cascading
behind her upraised arm.
Erotic content is evident in all aspects of this scene: in the sexual
posturing of the nude male and long-haired female, in their dancelike
movements, and in their musical instruments. As noted by Ann Draff
korn Kilmer, allusions to the tautness of the strings of instruments
such as lyres are found in Sumerian and Akkadian love charms to
ensure potency. Tambourines are usually held by nude female figures and, in one
instance, on a cylinder seal from Mari, by the goddess Ishtar/Inanna.
Accordingly, the instrument is associated with sexual love, with se
duction, and perhaps with the cult of the goddess. Thus the two
figures seen here are not secular performers, but provide joyful music
and erotic dancing as an accompaniment to and celebration of a cult
ritual, perhaps the sacred marriage.
5. Lady of the Morning
102 lnanna with Date Palm and Anzu-bird Cylinder seal. Mesopotamia. Neo-Sumerian period, c. 2112-2004 B.C. Steatite. 27 X 14 mm. Toronto, Canada, Lands of the Bible Archaeology Foundation, The Royal Ontario Museum
On this seal, lnanna raises her hand in greeting to the worship
pers who approach her while she looks "in sweet wonder from
heaven" directly out at the viewer. Above her hand is an eagle,
perhaps the lion-headed Anzu. Before her in the field is a date palm
within a vessel, the focus of ritual libations before the goddess in
other scenes. Beneath her feet lies her lion. An elaborate throne
supports her. Empowered by her date palm and the Anzu-b'wd,
lnanna is better able to rule and judge wisely for her people.
Human worshippers frequently petition deities in scenes and
inscriptions on seals; the seal in effect becomes a permanent prayer
to the deity. Here a bald, bare-footed worshipper is held by the wrist
and led by a suppliant goddess before the awesome Inanna/Ishtar.
The seal's inscription states that it belongs to Lu-igallim, who is
the lumah-priest of Ninibgal, "Lady of the Big House," probably
another name for lnanna. Perhaps it is Lu-igallim who is led by the
goddess into Inanna's presence here.

104 Bringing Gifts to Inanna
Alabaster vase. Uruk (level III), c. 3100-2900 B.C. h. 3 ft. Iraq
Museum. Photograph courtesy of Hirmer Verlag, Munich.
The upper register of this enormous pedestal vase probably
shows the goddess Inanna before the twin-doorpost entrance to her
temple. A ritually nude figure, perhaps a priest, presents her with a
vessel filled with the fruits of the land. Behind the priest stands
another figure (partially obliterated by damage to the vessel), wearing
the long skirt and elaborate belt of the en who assumes the role of
groom in the sacred marriage with Inanna. The ceremony may be
portrayed here.
(An ancient repair with copper rivets is visible above the head
of the goddess, indicating that the vase was treasured in antiquity.)
106 Inanna Receiving Offering
Cylinder seal. Late Uruk-Jemdet Nasr period, 3200-3000 B.C.
Magnesite. 4.7 X 4.2 cm. Dresden, Staatliche Kunstsammlungen
Although unprovenanced, this cylinder seal bears a scene that is
closely related to the one depicted in the upper register of the "Warka
Vase" excavated at Uruk. The "figure in the net skirt," perhaps the
en or priest-king of the city of Uruk, brings offerings to Inanna's
temple, symbolized by her two gatepost emblems. The long-horned
animal that the priest-king carries is in fact a vessel, with a spout on
its back perhaps formed of precious metal. Behind him, a second
long-haired assistant figure wearing a short net skirt offers a spouted
vessel, perhaps filled with beer. Before Inanna's temple enormous
vessels are filled with the produce of the land, the fruit and grains of
the farmer, flanked by the meat offerings of the shepherd. The bounty
of the land of Sumer is here presented to the goddess Inanna.

BM 116506
This clay model of a bed clearly shows the pattern of the basketry
"mattress" that was lashed to the wooden frame. Actual beds of this
type were found in a cemetery at the site of Mari. Such beds were
probably used by individuals of high social status, for the majority of
the people of ancient Mesopotamia slept on mats on the floor. Other
terracotta beds supporting intertwined couples suggest that such beds
were used for ritual purposes, as in the enactment of the sacred
marriage.
108 Loiffj Embracing
Clay plaque. Mesopotamia. Isin-Larsa-Old Babylonian period, c. 2000-1600 B.C. Baked clay. London, The British Museum, BM 113181
This damaged terracotta bed holds roundly modeled male and
female figures. As they kiss, each wraps one hand about the partner's
neck and the other around the waist, in gestures evocative of deep
human emotion. The scene's ritual rather than secular nature is sug
gested by the baldness of the male figure. Similar shaven heads are
believed to characterize priestly or royal figures.
109 Musician with Upright Harp
109 Musician u ith Horizontal Harp
Musicians with upright and horizontal harps. Mesopotamia. Ur III
Isin-Larsa period, c. 2100-1800 B.C. Baked clay plaques. 12 X 7 cm.;
7.3 X 8.5 cm, respectively. Paris, Louvre, AO 12453 and AO 12454,
respectively. Barrelet 775, 776
Seated on stools, two male figures play harps. The first holds a
vertical harp against his shoulder; the second cradles a horizontal harp
against his chest and plucks it with a plectrum.
Of the three categories of Sumero-Babylonian instruments
percussion, wind, and strings—the strings are traditionally associated
with potency and with the cult that is played before the goddess
Inanna and the king in this hymn. Here the harp's sound is said "to
drown out the southern storm," providing us with some idea ot the
loudness of the music it produced. Other texts liken the sound ot a
198



stringed instrument, perhaps a lyre, to the thunder of the Storm God,
Adad. Bulls—the animal symbol of storm and fertility gods like Adad
—actually form the soundbox of lyres excavated at the Royal Ceme
tery at Ur. The bull thus seemingly emits the thunderous sound of this stringed instrument.
The sacred nature of these musical instruments is suggested by
texts which relate that offerings were brought to lyres as to statues of
the gods. Accordingly, to play such holy instruments, musicians had
first to purify their fingers, perhaps by washing.
In Sumerian music, a development can be traced from a five-note
(pentatonic) to a later eight-note (heptatonic) scale, as pointed out by Marcelle Duchesne Guillemin.

Fully clothed male and female figures lie gazing intently at each
other on a bed; the scored edge of the bed is visible behind the woman. Each wears a padded diadem that may be specifically priestly
headgear, according to Madeline Noveck. Their hair has been elabo
rately coiffed into chignons, and in the case of the male figure into
a long spiral curl. Each holds one hand at waist level and the other
encircling the partner's waist. Both wear garments that wrap
obliquely about the body. Multiple necklaces and bracelets adorn the woman.

SOURCES FOR INANNA'S
STORIES AND HYMNS
Many Sumerologists contributed to the deciphering of Sumerian grammar and
vocabulary. The following notes acknowledge the specific sources used by the
authors to create this book.
The Huluppu-Tree
Translations of "The Huluppu-Tree" which is part of the epic tale "Gil
gamesh, Enkidu, and the Nether World," can be found in S. N. Kramer's The
Sumerians: Their History, Culture, and Character (University of Chicago Press,
1963), pp. 197-205, and in Aaron Shaffer's doctoral dissertation presented to
the Oriental Department of the University of Pennsylvania (1963), entitled
"Sumerian Sources of Tablet XII of the Epic of Gilgamesh."
Inanna and the God of Wisdom
"Inanna and the World Order" has been edited by Gertrud Farber
Flugge, under the title "Der Mythos 'Inanna und Enki' mit besonderer Be
riicksichtigung der liste der me" (Biblical Institute Press, Rome, 1973). A
sketch of its contents, together with translations of several key passages, was
first published in Samuel Noah Kramer's Sumerian Mythology (3rd ed., Univer
sity of Pennsylvania Press, 1972), pp. 64-8.
The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi
Translations of most of the poems relating to the Inanna-Dumuzi courtship can
be found in S. N. Kramer's contribution to the 3rd edition of Ancient Near
Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (James Pritchard, ed., Princeton
201



University Press, 1969), pp. 41, 496, 637-45; in his "Cuneiform Studies and
the History of Literature" (Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, vol.
107, 1963); and in The Sacred Marriage Rite (University of Indiana Press,
1969), pp. 49-106, and From the Poetry ofSumer (University of Berkeley Press 1979), pp. 71-98).
The translation of the phrase "the agate necklace of fertility" was offered
to Diane Wolkstein by Miguel Civil of the University of Chicago.
The Descent of Inanna From the Great Above to the Great Below
Translations of "The Descent of Inanna" can be found in S. N. Kramer's "Inanna's Descent to the Nether World: Continued and Revised" (Journal of
Cuneiform Studies, vol. 5, 1951, pp. 1-17), The Sacred Marriage Rite, pp. 107
33, and the article in a forthcoming volume of the Proceedings of the American
Philosophical Society entitled "Sumerian Literature and the British Museum"; in
William B. Sladek's doctoral dissertation presented to the Department of Near
Eastern Studies of the Johns Hopkins University (1974), entitled "Inanna's Descent to the Nether World"; and in Thorkild Jacobsen's The Treasures of Darkness (Yale University Press, 1978), pp. 53-63.
The Dream of Dumuzi
A translation of "Dumuzi's Dream" can be found in Bendt Alster's mono
graph Dumuzi's Dream from Mesopotamia, I (Copenhagen, 1974), which is
based in large part on contributions by Adam Falkenstein, Thorkild Jacobsen,
J.J. Van Dijk, and S. N. Kramer. "Dumuzi and Geshtinanna" can be found
in Sladek's dissertation.
New translations to be found in "The Descent of Inanna" were gener
ously offered to Diane Wolkstein by Miguel Civil of the University of Chicago.
They are "the double strand of beads," "Let the beer of his funeral rite be
poured into the cup," "A maid, as tall as heaven . . . waits outside the palace
gates," "the small galla . . . the size of low picket fences," "a single growing
reed trembles for me," "The bottom of my churn drops away," and "The
churn lies silent."
The Return
The text of "The Return" is a compilation of several Sumerian lamentations.
"The Lady Weeps Bitterly" can be found in S. N. Kramer's Sacred Marriage
Rite on p. 128 and in Jacobsen's The Treasures of Darkness on page 50. Transla
tions of "The Wild Bull Lives No More," "My Heart Plays the Reed Pipe of
202



Mourning," and "O My Brother! Who Is Your Sister," can be found in The
Treasures of Darkness, pp. 50, 53-4, 54-5, and 66, respectively.
Seven Hymns to Inanna
Translations of the hymns can be found in David Reisman's doctoral disserta
tion presented to the Oriental Department of the University of Pennsylvania
(1969), entitled "The Sumerian Royal Hymns." The first part of "Loud
Thundering Storm" is taken from "Queen of the Earth Gods," in S. N.
Kramer's From the Poetry of Sumer, p. 89; the second part is taken from Reis
man's dissertation.

NOTES ON THE
TEXTUAL EDITING
The following is an account of the specific changes that depart from literal
Sumerian texts. These notes are especially intended for the Sumerologist,
folklorist, storyteller, and dramatist. The Cycle of Inanna is meant not only to
be read silently but "loudly" and performed as theatre, ritual, or opera. As
live performances, repetitions are not necessarily tedious; they can be glorious.
The Huluppu-Tree
When Inanna speaks to Utu and Gilgamesh, she condenses the first section of
the Sumerian text of 1 3 lines into 5 lines as has been done. However, begin
ning from line 14 of the first section, "He set sail; the Father set sail," Inanna
retells the story both times line by line in the Sumerian text (referring to
herself in the third person) until the line, "How Inanna wept!" Wolkstein has
condensed Inanna's two retellings to Utu and Gilgamesh from 33 or so lines
into 19 lines to quicken the dramatic flow of the reading.
Inanna and the God of Wisdom
The entire list of me is recited four times in the original Sumerian story (the
complete list, in fourteen groupings, appears on pp. 16-18). The four listings
in this text have been modified in the following ways:
The first time the me are recited (pp. 14-15), the offerings have been
reduced from fourteen groupings to three. Enki's first offering to Inanna
corresponds to the first grouping of the complete list of me. Enki's second and
third offerings have been selected to relate to Inanna's life story.
The second time the me are recited (pp. 16-18), the text follows the
complete list as given in the Sumerian. The third time the me are recited (pp. 19-20), the groups have again been
reduced to three. The first offering corresponds to the first grouping of the
205



complete list of me. The second and third offerings were chosen to relate to the drama taking place between Enki and Inanna.
The fourth time the me are recited (p. 26), the original Sumerian consists
of all the previously given me as well as the new me. In this text, only the new
me are given.
The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi
To form the section here called "The Courtship of Inanna and Dumuzi,"
Diane Wolkstein selected among the different love songs scattered in mu
seums throughout the world. Samuel Noah Kramer deciphered them, and
Wolkstein then retranslated and ordered them so that the story would lead
from the personal romance of the young lovers to the more public ritual of
the king and queen in the sacred marriage rite. The rosettes indicate breaks
between the different pieces of the courtship texts.
The Descent of Inanna
Several compositions are combined to form "The Descent of Inanna." The
first section, "From the Great Above to the Great Below," follows the
Sumerian text until there is a break on line 381 of twenty lines that are not
yet completely decipherable. Here our first section ends at the break in the
text.
"The Dream of Dumuzi" is composed of Alster's "Dumuzi's Dream" and sections from the more fragmentary "Dumuzi and Geshtinanna" story. "The Return" is composed of several mourning songs and then, with the
appearance of Geshtinanna, of Kramer's tentative translation of the last fifteen
lines of "From the Great Above to the Great Below."
From the Great Above to the Great Below
In the Sumerian text, Inanna repeats three times to Ninshubur the plea she
wishes her to deliver to Enlil, Nanna, and Enki. The exact speech is given on
p. 54 , after which "Weep before Nanna" . . . "Weep before Enki" is used
rather than repeating the entire plea.
To prolong the comic relief on pp. 65-66, Sladek's translation of "belly
back" and Jacobsen's translation "heart-liver" have been added to Kramer's
translation of "inside-outside."
206



The Dream of Dumuzi
On p. 78, after the speech "Let your dogs devour us," there occurs a section
of about fifteen lines that is not clearly understandable. At this point a section
from "Dumuzi and Geshtinanna" has been substituted. Wolkstein returns to
the text of "The Dream of Dumuzi" with the line: "The galla went to
Dumuzi's friend" on p. 80.
On p. 83, after Geshtinanna's grief "covered the horizon," five galla
enter the sheepfold, and Dumuzi and the sheepfold are destroyed. The seven
galla section from "Dumuzi and Geshtinanna" is substituted. Wolkstein then
concludes with the last three lines from "The Dream of Dumuzi."
The Return
The lamentations have been edited to accord with the epithets and place names
already used in the text.
Seven Hymns to Inanna
The Seven Hymns to Inanna follow Reisman's translations of Iddin-Dagan's
Hymns to Inanna. To the second hymn has been added parts of the IshmeDagan Hymn to Inanna from the same period, 1900 B.C. Since the two hymns
have the similar contents of the monthly worship of Inanna by the gods and
people of Sumer, it seemed important to add Inanna's raging, stormy aspects
in order to form the full view that the Sumerian poets present of their passion
ate, fructifying, yet terrifying and unfathomable Goddess of Love.

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
I wish to thank my friends and family who stood by me during the three
years I was living 5,000 years ago in the service of the Goddess.
My first thanks go to Benjamin Zucker. Our mutual interest in ancient
history led us fifteen years ago to read the incredible Sumerian text of "The
Lamentations of Ur" and to become admirers of Samuel Noah Kramer. Since
then I often spoke to him about the absence of the great heroine in ancient
history; to this, he always responded: "You must find her and write about her
yourself."
Samuel Noah Kramer's patient and searching scholarship served as a model for me in my construction of the text.
Erlo Van Waveren and Charles Mee were the first of my friends to
recognize the importance of the Inanna text. My discussions with each of them
clarified many sections of the text and led me to the writing of the commentar
ies.
My very special thanks to Jinx Roosevelt who assiduously, wisely, and
lovingly read and re-read, edited and re-edited the numerous versions of text
and commentary. She would smile each time I would show her another "last" version of the commentaries.
Elizabeth Williams-Forte was an invaluable help. She listened to my many
queries on the problematic aspects of Sumerian culture and always provided
just the right article or book.
The questions and suggestions of other friends greatly enriched the book.
My thanks to Peter and Lorraine Ackerman, Doris Alberecht of the Jung
Library, Olivier Bernier, Robert Bly, Ira Friedlander, Brooke GofTstein,
Philip and Phylis Morrison, David Outerbridge, Corethia Quails, and Gary
Wolkstein.
No one could ask for a more supportive and wonderful editor than Hugh
Van Dusen at Harper & Row. I am also especially grateful to the care and
diligence ofJanet Goldstein in the editorial department and Coral Tysliava of
the copyediting department at Harper & Row. Miguel Civil at the University of Chicago gave most generously of his
time by reading the text and commentaries and offering the latest Sumerian
scholarship for the text.
Whenever I came to an impasse in the text or commentaries, my daughter,
Rachel Cloudstone Zucker, would say, 'Just say what you mean." I'm still
trying.

LITERATURE/MYTHOLOGY/WOMEN'S STUDIES
With the publication of this book, we have for the first time in any
modern literary form one of the most vital of ancient myths— that of
Inanna (known to the Semites as Ishtar), the world's first goddess of
recorded history and the beloved deity of the ancient Sumerians. In this
groundbreaking work, Samuel Noah Kramer, the preeminent living
expert on Sumer, and Diane Wolkstein, a gifted storyteller and folklorist, have retranslated, ordered, and combined the fragmented cuneiform tablets comprising the Cycle of Inanna to create an authentic portrait of the goddess from her adolescence to her completed womanhood and
"godship." Illustrated with visual artifacts of the period, the images guide the reader through Inanna's realm on a journey parallel to the one evoked by the text. And the carefully wrought commentaries at once explicate and amplify the power, wonder, and mystery embedded in
these ancient tales. Tender, erotic, and compassionate, Inanna is a
compelling myth that is timely in its rediscovery.
"This is an admirable translation, a great masterpiece of universal
literature/' —Mircea Eliade
"A splendid mutual accomplishment and a great gift to mythology....
Inanna is a book to be cherished/7—P. L. Travers
"In the myth of Inanna, Wolkstein and Kramer give us back the totality of
woman, the ruler-wife-lover-redeemer, whom all worshiped and from whom all life flowed. It is a thrilling rediscovery/'— Olivier Bernier
"Wolkstein has been able to convey in English the rich metaphor, the
erotic fullness, and the ritual pacing of these ancient stories. . . .Taken
together with the illustrations, historical discussions, and textual commentaries, this book is worth a tower of scholarly tomes. . . .Such a
feat is remarkable and rare."—Barre Toelken, Director of Folklore and
Ethnic Studies, University of Oregon.
"I felt shivers of recognition reading these ancient lines that proclaim
Inanna's discovery of her prowess. . . .Kramer and Wolkstein make us
love their awesome goddess whose stormy complexities have been
concealed in cuneiform tables for thousands of years."-Nor Hall
"By the date of this most ancient of epics, their unknown authors already
held the power to speak with high art both of the grand patterns of nature
and of the human condition.' -Phylis and Philip Morrison
