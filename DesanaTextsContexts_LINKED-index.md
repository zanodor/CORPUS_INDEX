SpJnish or Portuguese, ;J fact which seriously diminished their analytic value (Amorim, 1928, pp, 427 430; Reichel-Dolinatoff. 1968, pp, 17 25; Umusin, 1980) Shamans arc the intcliectu,Jis of their societics and, in the Vaupcs territory, were much In;Jligned by missionaries Jnd Bible trJnslJtors, They lived in relative isolation or incognit(), but oncc I had established contact with them I was well received and they readily offered, not only to dictate tcxtual matcrials into my tape recorder, but also to COlllment freely on them and discuss with me whatever te.\tual episode I might wish to clarify for myself. It was this last point that intel'es ted me most. Obviously, it was not sulTicient to record a te xt, transl;Jte it, and then attempt to analyse it back home, without having the possibility to ask questions, I\s I con ceived my task, whJt was most needed was J detailed discussion of e;Jch text, ill the field and within the context of a functioning society; what I hoped t:l Jcilieve was J discussion of etymological and senwntic points, of mctaphors, analogies. and mental images; or men, animals and plants tllat were thc protagonists and props of thcse myths and tales. And in these discussions had to takc pal'l other knowledgeable people , other ciders, and men of intellect , and not only the narrator. It was with thcse objectives in mind that I began my work of recording, translating, and co mmenting, During the last dceades the study of aboriginal myths has entered a new and. intellectually, highly challenging phase. Claude Levi-Strauss and a growing group of scholars innuenced by him have greatly advanced anthropological thinking by their acute analyses of native mythologies and their symbolic structures, and it may well be said that this develop ment, oriented by this brilliant mind, has come to constitute the climax of twentieth-century ethnology. Levi-Strauss and his followers in structur alism have opcned new avcnues in intcrpretation, avenues which, although marked by only few clearly legible guide-posts, can carry the reader into such a wondrous and wcll-ordered landscape that he cannot but continuously cxpress his admiration before so ingenious an al'lifice. And sometimes it becomes difficult to decide which to admire more; the vision of this great and seductive master, or thc complexity of the inner world of thc Indians, that provides the screen on which scene after scene ex presses man's struggle for adaptation to his environmcnt. and to his own biological and psychological self. Much of Levi-Strauss's mythological materials had been collecJed among the Inciians of the South American tropics and wilcn, in the sixties, I turned my attention to the equatorial rain forest tribes of the Vaupes

territory, I was able to obtain a number of myths or , at least. of myth motifs, that were very similar to those analysed by Levi-Strauss. In going over these parallels I was struck b.y certain differences of interpretation. In my work on the Vaupes tribes I was approaching the field of myth in a much more limited manner than the wide sweep of structuralism would have recommended. I had always been more interested in ethnographic minutiae and in myth content rather than in form, and ill this manner my research. had taken me in a very different direction from that of the structuralists. Levi-Strauss's work was not concerned so much with empirical reality than with dimensions of thought that seemed to lie quite outside of the sensorial experience, but wllich I believecJ to underlie myth and ritual. In my approach I was not conce.rned with structure and comparisons, not even with coincidences of content but , quite simply, with the Incpans' formulation of a world view, and with their particular way of adaptation and survival. In other words, in my Desana studies I went back to things. I worked not only with people, but I concerned my self with their natural environment; by this I cJo not only mean that I tried to study their 'ecological adaptation , but t[wt I attempted to under stand the native point of view of what man's relationships were to nature , in terms of mental altitudes. In order to grasp the content of myths and tales, I have tried to combine several aspects. First of all, I decided to work through the native language; second, I have only used texts which I personally have recorded and which carryall the authority of the n~tive speaker's diction and con viction; and, third, [ elicited from Illy info/mants an analysis as detailed as possible, together with a full discussion of the ethnographic details in which each text was imbedded. I am fully aware of the dangers inherent in native exegesis, but I believe that it does contribute a perspective whicll is very valuable, and which is missing in most publications on South American Indians. Mytlls and tales Ilad to be studied witllin their full context, and had to be interpreted with the active assistance of the Indians. I was less interested in wllat the myths expressed in structuralist terms, than in what they meant to the narrator and his audience. The range of ideas expressed in Desana origin myths and tales shows several divisions which, although not always clearly delilll ited , can serve as a general outline to this Introduction. A first division refers to the Creation of Man. It is understood that this act of creation was ac complished by the Sun Father, a divine being whose representative , called panlllri rnahsi!', the Progenitor, visited this eurth and travelled on its rivers in search of a spot where to establish mankind. Nowhere the creation of



III trouue tio/l II
the earth it se lf is mentioned; it simply exists and the Progenitor's first task was to find the exact spot where his staff, described as a stick rattle (yeegi:) would stand upright, without casting ,a shadow, It is abundantly made clear by the narrators and commentators that this staff has a phallic connotat ion ; that the "ce nter " where the staff mu st stand upright has a female connotation , and that the precise geograpllical spot where the two principles must Illeet, is located on the Equator. Sillce it is taken for gra llted that the Progenitor, that is to say , th e SUIl, travelled from East to West, either ascending the Rio Negro. or reach ing its banks from a point lying toward the East. perhaps in the region of the Rio l3ranco. the spot chosen for Man's conception was a lake. a lagoon situated near a point where the equatorial line crosses the Rio Negro. Although there exist many river lakes in that general region. none of theIll is pointed out by the Desana as being the original one; it rather seeIllS that this lake is not geographically identifiable, but is a mythological ab st raction. an abstract wOIllb. This place is variously called ahpi/(on dia, "milk-lake" or "milk-river;" or 1Ili:i! dia, "Ulnad-lake," lItllari (LG) being the naIlle of a forest tree tlwl. bears a sweet-tasting fruit (Poraqueiba paraensis). In shaIllanic iIllagery it is described as a circular body of water, sOllletimes a whirlpool or enormous vortex, saturated with life-giving force s. After a long journey during which the Progenitor's staff failed to stand upright. pal/lllrf mahsi! finally arrived at the lake or whirlpool where no shadow was cast. The staff stood in the "center" and now drops of semen fell down from it into the lak e. We must take into account here that. in shamanic ideology, womb and brain arc two closely related organs which imply related physiological and cognitive proc esses . Both organs are iIllagined as hollow, with a lobulate interior. a 's yncone.' The germ of life or of thought travels through a se ries of ventricles wherein they are transformed by successive stages until they reach maturity, ripeness. So in these Illyths we find long descriptions of the slow development of life. not only of physical exi stence, but also of awareness, Inside the primordial womb the embryo is described as growing and moving, of taking in nourishment, of pushing and turning, This process is descr ibed in eIllbryological terms or in terms of plant growth. SOIlletimes the account seems to allude to a seed crystal suspended in a saturated solution. And aniong all these images we' also find one of brain functions, of increa si ng aWllreness of - shall we. say personality formation. At the end of thi s gestation period birth takes place. The process of Man 's Em ergence and subseq uent spr'ead consti tutes another group of origin myths. The precise spot where this birth

together some mi scelaneou s texts of imprecise attribution. It is remarkable that Oesana mythology should contain no elabor ation whatsoever of divine powers, of supernatural spirit beings, or of any personification identifiable with the image of a culture hero . Oesana mythology also seems to lack tales of Death <lnd the L<lnd of the Dead. The emphasis, in turn, is on procreation and social co ntinuity, and this preoccupation is described in the context of river travel, of uterine development, and of neurologica l allusions. The drive upriver is the great metaphor that includes insemination and growth, paralleled by man 's quest for women, food, and land. The toils and disillu sionment s of this quest <lre seen mainly as the consequence of women's moral jrresponsa bili ty. They are described as strange women, coming from other tribes. They have no magical powers, nor are they inventive , industrious, or good mothers. They simply are evil, adulterous, utterly disloyal. It is this misogynous attitud e which appears over and over in many episodes that describe a man's striving frustrated by female faithlessness. This, then , is a mythology without gods or heroes; a mythology of here and now, of the struggle for survival in a strange land. And there is but little time -depth. It deals, in all essence, with the progress of a small group of men ,of "brothers," who , after many hardships prevail and find their own cultural identity. But they ac hieve this without bravery , without heroic deeds, they <lre raiders and rogues who abduct women, and who only eventually come to establish peaceful relationships with other groups more numerous and better organised than the newcomers. The Vaupes territory is a refuge area, a marginal region into which, for centuries and perhaps for millennia, Am<lzonian and other tribes have penetrated for a variety of reasons. The outstanding geographical feature nf this area and its river systems are the many falls and rapids which con stitute formidable obstacles to navigation. Ascending the Rio Negro from the Amazon , a point is reached where the falls begin; this is approximately at the equatorial line. At Ipanore, Sao Gabriel and Yavarete, the latter <llready at the confluence of the Vaupcs river and the Papuri, there exist large and dangerous f<llls and rapids, and above Yavarete , on the middle course of the Vaupes, follow at least sixty waterfalls and rapids. Other falls continue above Mitu, up to the great falls of Yurupari which mark the lower limit of the headwater region. And the same is true of all other rivers . The Papur!, Tiquic , Pira-parana, Apaporisand others have dangerous falls. In other words, beyond lpanore the traveller proceding from the Amazon enters into an entirely different country characterised by rocky outcrops and narrows which make for turbulent and dangerous waters.



14 Introduction
.An y human group that ha s penetrated ab ove a clwin of rapids, can be sa id to have achieve d a measure of sccurity, of iso !<Jtiun. of protection from othcr groups that might ~e roaming on the calmer wat ers down streams. While tllC water-falls of the rivers form phy sica l limits. they also come to constitute cultural and social boundaries. l3y isolating certain fall s one may divide any river into seclions, generally into a tripartite scheme of an "upper, middle, and lower" course. Myth and tradition will sa nction practical experience by attributing to certain landillark s on the river th e character of boundary point s. The Des<IIHI usu ally think of rivers as thus divided into three sections. and this division is important in social organi sation because each sec tion implies different ecol ogical conditions and different conditions for human contacts. The lower stretches of a river have alluvial soils propitious for 110rticuiture and offer contact with other groups; the middle course offers good fishing grounds. while the head waters offer plentyful huntin g and ga thering , togeth er with the security of isolation. In order to interpret the body of oral traditions it becomes neces sary to take into account ali these geographical and ecological factors because, in part, they tend to shape these traditions. and provide a vocabulary and a wide range of metaphor s based upon practical experience in these particular physical surroundings. Another important consideration in evaluating this mythological material is this: with the exception of the Creation of Man, a tale that is couched in a shamanistic language replete with complex metaphors. all other myth s and tales develop in an earthly, natural environment. and the actors are people WllO beh,lve according to human lllotiv,ltions and goals. Sometimes the hallucinatory experience provides an otherwordly back drop, and tile frcquent themes of transformation or othcr proccsscs that defy our physical laws ollcr une .xpectcd route s. but in general terms, all action dcvelops in a dimension of physical. everyday reality. In this manner. the myths appear rather as historical accounts, as descriptions of the toils and dangers of river travel. of the fear to penetrate into the strange lands of "olher people", and of thc search for women. food . and a spo t to se ttle down. From all we have learned so far ubout Desu lla ori gi ns, it seems thut they ure newcomers to the Vaupe s territory. Their own histori cal accounts contain but ' Iittle time-depth: the "emcrgence" at Ipanorc is not spoken of as a thing of the remote past. but as an event that happened only a few gcnei'atiolls ago . And this muy well be the truth. The l)c sa na ure far from

16 Introductio/l
There are certain basic facts in the physical. natural conditions of the Vaupcs territory which characterise it. and tend to stimulate and shape human imagination and i~tellectu<J1 comprehension, The w<Jtcrralls are one of them, Many of these falls offer"the awe-inspiring sight of foam ing thundering masses of w<Jter rushing over and between enormous black boulders. A mist c<Jn be seen rising over the falls . and in the spray one sometimcs might perceive a rainbow effect of striking proportions, To this we must add the wiLlc range of acoustic effects: from a dist<Jnce it is a 11lInlilling. droning sound. rising-and railing with the air currcnts which move over the river and the rorest; on approaching. the deafening noise of the rushing w<Jters will engulf the beholder. At the I'oot of the major f<JlIs lic deep <Jnd dark pools: patches of fO<Jm Iloat on the surfacc. and from their depths bubbles are welling up with gurgling noises, Or there Illay be whirlpools into whose depths leaves and branches and other flotsam will disppear with a sucking noise, only to be regurgitated after a while and continue to turn and spir,i/ down again, A waterfall is thus an extraordinary sight in the otherwise nlOnotonous forest environillent. It also will form its own microenvironment in that. duc 10 the spr<Jy. the rising hUlllidity. <Jnd thc cooler tcmper<Jture. there will be specific aquatic and forest plants. specific fishes. <Jnd specific land animals which prefer this kind of environment. Lichens <JIHI illosses. mushrooms. water spillers and insects. they all will form a unique combination . not I'ound in other circul1lstances , These are the physical facts; next comes man's relationship to thelll, First of <JII. these arc danger spots: thew is Iwrdly a m<ljor fall in thc Vaupcs territory wllCre no fatal or ncar-fatal accident has happened within the living meillory of Illany people, So there is good reason to sup pose that the spirits of drowned people Illight roam at these spots, The traveller will be apprehensive when <lppro<lching a fall: he and his companions will have to cvaluate a number of f<lctors beforc t<lking a de cision, either to shoot the rapids, or to unload <lnd then PUSll or Iwlf C<lrry tile canoe through side ch<lnnels or over portages. und then reload it on the other end of the danger zone. And rapids will change continuously. Rain fall of a side stream, the accumulation of fallen trees and branches forming a temporary dam,or even the displacement of a few large stones under the on rush of the waters might change a current, obstruct a previously used chan nel, or open another. A slight difference in water level might make the dif ference betwccn a s<lfe paSS<lgc <lnd disastcr, All thesc changes in water level. of curren ts <lnd obst ruct ions, produce 1heir characterist ic sounds which imlic<lte to the tr<lined ellr the particul<lr conditons of the passage,

in which certain plants and animal species combine in forming a strictly bounded little community. But apart from the geo\1Jgical and biological uniqueness of these isolated peaks, there are other factors which call the attention. Many of these spots are ancient archaeological sites. In the cavcs. rock shelters, and crevisses abound the bones of game animals butchered and consumed by ancient hunters. These accumulations of faunal remains , mainly of mammals , have led to the idea that the hills and peaks are the supernatural abodes of game animals spirits where untold numbers of deer , peccary . rodents and others lead a ghostly existence under the care of the Master of Animals. This "master," imagined in animal disguise, or as a dwarfish man-like being that might appear suddenly to the hunter who has ventured too far into the depths of the interfluvial forests , is a supernatural game keeper who watches over his charges, so the hunters will not diminish the flocks and decimate the different species. On the walls of some caves and shelters one can observe pictographs painted with dark-red pigments. They represent game animals, jaguars, fish and turtles, interspersed with abstract geometrical designs. Some of these pictographs date from ancient times and form palimpsests in which one can recogn ise a chronological superposition. I3u t ot hers are more recent; in fact , shamans will occasionally visit tllese sites and retrace the signs, or paint new ones, in order to propitiate the Master of Animals. Sometimes an archaeological object has been found by the Indians who, on a hunting excursion, have come upon one of these sites. These objects were stone celts , necklace beads of stone or, perhaps, an artifact of carved bone , such as a flute or a snuffing tubc . Such finds have pro vided the basis for the common belief that the spirit game animals will sometimes emerge from their lairs inside the hills, and will take part in tumultuous dances during which they might lose one of these objects. Moreover , since in the damp shadowy crevasses grow aromatic herbs, the pungent smell of which can be perceived in passing, it is believed that the air will be saturated with these exciting odors, after one of these wild dances has taken place. All these combined factors have helped to shape a certain image in which these isolated hills have become the dwelling places of forest monsters and game animal spirits. Since all these creatures are likely to do some magical harm to the hunters, in revenge for persecutions suffered at their hands, these spots are generally avoided by people . The conse quence of this has been the formation of veritable game reserves, a fact

whi(h, in turn, tends to reaffirm the initial idea of a supernatural gathering "'" 2 ~~-.j/ place. There exists a close ideologi(al relationship between the f<llis and pools on the one hand, and the isolated hills, on the other. They comple ment e,l(;h other by harboring aquatic and land anil1lals, and both are il1lagined as enormous longhouses inhabited by innumerable animals which live in them "just like people."ln fact, the se places are designated as "water houses" and "hill hou ses." But what is more, while the deep pools are seen as cosillic wombs, as pulsating female organs inside whi<.:h a continous process of conception, gestation and birth is going on, th e hills are imagined to be skulls, human brains insid e which a similar creative process is developing . Nature in the Vaupes Ilas provided a third element that combines th e pools in the river and the hill s in the forest, and links both to human existence. This third clement consists of hallucinogenic plants. In no other rcgion of the Colombian tropics is there such a variety and ab undancc of plants from which narcoti<.: drugs can be prepared , be it in the form of beverages and potions, or in the form of snuff, toba<.:<.:o smoke , or orally inge stcd matt er. Shamans in their trance will visit the hills and pools: they will dive into the waters or cnter into the rocky chambers, and there will converse with the Masters of Fish, the Masters of Game, the jaguar monstcrs and spirit scrpents , asking th em to provide food for men, to foment nature's fertilit y, and thus to guaran tee social survival. Among all Tukanoan peoples the usc of such powerful psycho tropic plants as Ballisteriopsis is a co llective ritual occasion. During tlleir trance statcs thc mcn sce tllCm se lves returning to the mythica l Time of Creation: th ey see theillselves travelling inside the anaconda canoe, visiting falls and pools , hills and caves , all the sacred landmarks of Time and Space. They will relive the Creation of Man in the turbul en t womb of the Lake of Milk ; they will die and be reborn ' at Ipanore , and over the din and confu sion of dance and song they will hear the Sun Father's stick rattle, on 11is search for the <.:cnter, for the pre<.:ise spo t wh ere mankind would at last find its dwelling place. In their night they wi ll leave behind the sub lunary sp here and penetrate beyond the Milky WaY"into other land scClpes and time dimensions_ The importance of hallucinatory drugs is ?II-pervading in De sana society and in shaIllanistic ideology. The drug ex perience is not only a personal quest for transcendcncy. but .it is a dimen sion of existence which isjllst as valid as that of our so:ca lled everyday reality. It is against thi s background of multiple dimensions and nlll It ivo'ca I images, th at we'must read, and try to und erst and, the texts that foll ow. l3ogota. 198 1.

22 Introduction
Payatege spoke in a low vo ice , his rambling performance being mono tonous. His sentences often were garbled and individual words became hardly audible or comprehensible, but on other occas ions he took interest in the session and spoke clearly and with emphasis. In the days following a recording session, a very rough transcription was made of the tape and, with the help of Spanish-speaking Desana, a preliminary and tentative translation was written down. Individual epi sodes were isolated, discrete motifs were listed, and a brief vocabulary of ambiguous terills was prepared. ThiS material provided the basis, not only for a more detailed translation, but also for the discussion of meaning. Shamanistic Desana is a powerful language , full of analogues. striking metaphors and vivid images. It took countle ss replays of the tapes before an approximate transcription on paper beca me possible. This was. probably, the most difficult task in the mec hanical preparation of th e texts; now , once on paper , detailed translation and discussion co uld begin. The reading and repla yi ng of a given tex t was now accompanied by questions on vocabulary and gramm ar and, of co urse. on the innumer abl e sema ntic problems and ethnographic details which arose in the course of the discussion. The narrato rs and others had agreed to co mment in detail on each te xt. and this work was accomplished during subsequent sessions in which a small, but knowledgable group of men took part. All te xt were reviewed and discussed more than once. Circumstances some times interrupted this work, but over the years, and on Illany different occasions, it became possible to accumulate a voluminous and coherent body of notes, explanatory glosses, and interpretative co mm entaries. on practically all recordings, together with a glossing of selected terms. The depths and details of the commentaries are uneven; some go into a great many details while others are superficial. This is due to th e fact that they were elicited and recorded under very different working condi tion s; some tim es people were tired, bored, or otherwise unwilling to discuss th ese matters.. I usually elicited etymologies of ce rtain words, and often enough th e commentators quite spontaneously offered their interpretations.
I/n many cases these etymologies point to intere sting hi storica l relationships between words, but in ot her cases th ey ma y be erroneou s, or the concep tual linkages between words ma y be doubtful. In the course of time I myse lf had become fairl y proficient in Desa na, and thus was able to make translations on my own. at least as far as lit era l meanings were con cer ned. After 1970, my work on the tex ts was continued mainly in \3ogota; all translation s and commentaries were minutely (hecked, a task in which my Desana informant , Antonio Guzman, was instrumental.



23
The Texts
Detailed criticism and coml1lentaries were also provided by the Desana speaking Tukano shal1lan Manuel Sierra, with whom I was able to work for sOl1le time. All in all, over the decade of the seventies, I spent. intermit tently, several thousand hours in discussion of the texts. Over all these years I kept in touch with otiler Tukanoans, and with the course of general developl1lent in the Vaupes area. I alll not a linguist; in my transcriptions of Desana texts I am using a very simplified phonetic notation I developed in Illy field notes, and which was suggested to me by Guzman. Stress and vowel length have not been indicated, and my spelling of Desana is dictated by ear. Although the so-called Sumlller Institute of Linguistics has been active in the Vaupes area for many years, no Desana grammar or dictionary have been pub lished yet, to illY knowledge, and so I had only some very limited linguistic sources to work with, at the start (e.g. BrUZZi, 1961, 1962). My phonetic notation is as follows: a as in art ij as in schon (German) e as in tale ii as in fiillen (Gerlllan) (:' as in que (French) y as in yet i as in l1lachine h as in rojo (Spanish) o as in world A glottal stop is indicated thus: sa 'a. Nasalization is indicated in brackets thus: too (nasal.). In the running texts I have omitted diacritical markings but I have used them occasionally in the sections dedicated to Notes and Commentaries, whenever I found it desirable to do so. Desana is a tonal language and this phenomenon is referred to occasionally in that section. The meaning of certain words will change according to pitch. An interesting observation is that nasalization sometimes seems to indicate an abstract meaning of the word in question. For example, pariri means "to break open, to emerge," as used when speaking of a ripe fruit or a pod that contains seeds; however, when nasalized, the word means "to open a field of action." Or, oreri means "to be born," while when nasalized, it means "to form a whirlpool," a symplic image of a birth giving funnel shape. Abstraction is also suggested by the repeated use of i! sounds., as, for example, in changes from u to (:', as in u/1liri, "to smoke," eiLiiri, "to transform." I have never mastered the peculiarities of tone and pitch, but having worked on these texts for so many years, I have acquired a good general knowledge of the language. There are many regional dif ferences in pronunciation which can also be observed even in the speech of people who were born in the same area, but who learned a myth or tale from a narrator who was born and raised somewhere else . .

The Informants
,;
Tile fifty texts contained in the present volume were dictated by four Desana shamans: 8egeyeri , TonJme, Miri, and Payatege . I have al ready mentioned some aspects of their particular performances while reciting a text, ancl shall add here a brief description of each narrator. 13egeycri was in his late fifties , an advanced age, by rain forest standards. A tall , proud man, he occupicc.i a higilly respected position among all neighboring Indians. He spoke good Spanish and some Portuguese, ami was an active rubber gatherer. Most people in Mitu , where he was fairly well known, thought of him as a hard worker and a good family man. l3egeyeri was a Iligh-ranking kunni, a man of priestly status, a fact that was not generally known aJl10ng the local mestizo population. He had an extraorc.iinary knowledge of oral traditions, but occasionally was somewhat secretive about ritual, and was not always in clined to speak to me about these matters. The mythical narratives, how ever, he told with gusto. He had a loud, booming voice and whenever he spoke, in tile presence of his people, his manner expressed authority and organised knowledge. When he talked before an auc.iiencc, even of only a few people, he would behave as if he were addressing a large crowd. He would callout ritual greetings, gesturc and turn. slap his tights and profess his pleasure at having so attentive an audicnce. But sometimes, in a most impressive manner, this initial euphoria would turn into sadness anc.i gruffy dispair. After having spoken for a while quite animatedly he would look around him and , as if noticing for tile first time that Ile WaS in tile presence of only a handful of people sitting huddled around a fire under a draughty shelter. he would slow down anti speak in a Jl10urnful voice. He then would remcmbcr old times; not the boastful violent tribal past , but the brotherhood of local gatherings, the closeness of kinship ties, the joy and excitement of hunting and dancing. And he would end by saying that all this would soon be gone; that all this was being destroyed by missionaries and rubber gatherers , by greed ancl politics, and that the young Indian generation was growing lip in obstinate defiance to the tradition of their ciders, and was thus condel11ning itself to become the ignorant and sub missive servants of whoever wielded power in the Vaupes. Begeyeri died in 1975, after having spent his last years in isolation. in a remote region . Tor,ime was older still, perhaps in his early sixties, when we first met. A small insignit'icant man with a timic.i smile and slow movements, he passed all110st unnoticed in the surroundings of MitLI. He cal11e original

Iy from the lower Papmi river where he had personally witnessed the burning of the most sacred objects of his people, by the Dutch Catholic Missionaries of Montfort. He h,ld practically no contacts with the national culture and spoke no Spanish at all. He, too, was a klllllU, and most people attributed to him a somewhat higher standing than to Begeyeri. In his everyday life Torame waS very retiring. He was a passionate angler ancl would spend Illuch time on the river, paddling his small canoe under the overhanging vegetation, avoiding the company of others~ but at home he would enjoy conversation with a few friends and, surrounded by his womenfolk, children and gr<Jntkhildren he would readily recite myths and spells, or sing fish for hours on end. For several years now he and his family have moved away, and live in isolation. Miri was in his early forties, a competent shaman, although not an outstanding one. As a young man he had become a practicing Catholic , but a number of unfortunate circllmstances had made him abandon this creed. Dreams and visions had made him return to his traditional beliefs. ,Ind he had become Illore and more concerned with the casting of spells, the curing of illness, and some minor aspects of hunting and fishing magic. He IHid ditliculties in his personal circumstances: Ile had made enemies, he was ambitious but disorganised in his work , and there was always some one ill in his family. All these contrary circumstances he attributed to his marriage: in his youth and under the pressure of his early mission education he Ilad married an Indian women from a tribe with whom the Desana were not allowed to intermarry. Although he never disavowed her , she became the scapegoat for all his frustrations , and so he had be come u bitter and quarrelsome man. He wus a good story teller, fond of unecdotes and of telling ribuld tules of Missionaries cast by him in the role of rain forest Boccuccios. In his discussion and cOillmenturies he wus rupid , to the point, but very dogmatic. Payutcge wus an old man who' died SllOrtly after I had finished my recordings of him. He hac! once been a well-known shaman, but now he had become forgetful and tired. He felt uneasy with people he did not know well ; his Illemory wus faulty and sometillles he was rambling and confused. He was a dwarfish little Illan who had outlived his family and friends, and now stayed with some lndifferent relatives, but sometimes .he would disappear for months and roam alone in the forest or on the river. He spoke no Spanish. He was glad to get over our record ing sessions, und I only saw him enjoying himself when he could sit with Tonlme and sing fish until duwn.

Narciso M~ltus Torres was most helpful and umlerst,IIHJing, and Ill.lny local settlers and rubber gatherers provided hospitality and advicc, In 130gota, I owc my gratitude to many friends with whom, at one time or another, I have discusscd my Vaupes research, My wife's intellectual contribution is unquestionable, Drs, I-'rancisco Covos , psychi atrist, Federico Medem, LOologist, Jose de Recasens, anthropologisr. and many others, Ilave contribtltcd to the formulation of problems and the elucidation of m,lny questions at issuc, I hopc that their participation in tllC Des~lna universe 11I~ly h~lve enriched their experience, To all of thelll I offer my heartfelt thanks, lowe a vcry special debt ot' gr<ltitude to Illy Desana informant Antonio GUllllan, In tile field, he was prescnt during most tape-recording sessions, ,Ind participated actively in the discussion of textual materials, His mastery 01' several Tukanoan languages, togetller wit II his fluency in Sp~lnish, were instrumcntal in the correct transcription and translation of the texts: in fact, the initial Spanisll translations of all fifty texts contained in this volume were nwde in collaboration with him, and then were cor rected ~Ind critically uiscussed by him, a task no o,ther person could have accomplished with more deuication and a higher sense of responsibility than this extraordinary assist:lni. In the course of this collaboration, Antonio Gll/man has rendered a great service to anthropology and, what is perhaps more, he has made it possible to preserve, in written form, a truly fundamental aspect of the traditions of his own people, The only way in whicll I can retribute, is by publishing these traditions in their origin<ll language,

down" to the river, and "up" to the longlllluse which stands on high ground. Tile idea of "puslling (In" is CllllVCvc(1 hy till' vcrb tllllll1e'riri, derived from tULlri, "to push,;; and miiriri, "to move up, to advance by stages." Some related terms are significant: while IIlcriri means "to ascend" (a river. a tree, a slope), the strongly nasalised term lIll/riri, means "to cook. to boil." implying a process of transformation. In fact, while the embryo is being "boiled" in the womb in order to become "ripe," the ascent of tile river implies a slow process of transformation. i3ut tlluri not only means "to push on;" it ,liso implies the meaning of "to guide. to invite to follow," Tilus. ai tULI bllarii means "lIe guided them uown toward the landing." The expression tULlIJa comcs to mean literally, "pushing on they floated ," but must be glossed as "he led them to float." that is. "to navigate." Simliariy, the verb IIl1illilri, "to float," refers to the image of an embryo "floating" on the river. In view of this double imagery I have translated the respective passages as "going down" or "going up" when what is meant is to go down to the river and up to the longhouse; when speaking of actual navigation, IlOwever. I Ilave translateu the text as "ascending" or "descending" the river. After this sUlllmary introduction I shall proced to comment on a number of specific linguistic or ethnographic points. in the oruer in which tlley appear in the course of tile migin<ll text.

6. kuiru viire, lit., "eye-house-in." The commentators explained that by this term reference was made to a wholly abstract sensorium located in the left cerebral hemisphere, which activates a visual sensorium in the right hemisphere. It was added that a graphic re presentation, related to a neurally inbuilt phosphene. might be a circle or a hexagon. 7. simpora; here glossed as "soul." The term is said to be derived from si'uri (nasal.), "to illuminate," pora (nasal.), "sons," or, in a transferred sense, "names . sprouts, descendants."

i9. meregoara l1'yoro J!iire, lit., "guatllo bone-spur-house in." The guamo tree (/ilga sp.) is called mere; its trunks are often hollow and are compared to tubular "bones" (goari); the term meregoara is the name of a certain ant that lives in the hollow of these trees; l1yoro is a spur, a piece of land that projects into the river like a peninsula, consisting of alluvial soil covered with vegetation. 20. oellyac/ora, from oeri, "to grate" (in order to obtain starch), I1vedri, "to take." dodri, "to sit."

The following Notes and Com1l1entaries refer to Text No.2. I. miriapota l'i is the "initiation house" and. in a wider sense. the hOllse of birth. of transformation, hallucination. orgasm. iri kc;'o lIIe;'cia, lit.. "that-oluster-uead, emplwsis;" IIlcra means here "old ones. ancient ones. dead ones." /\11 tlHough this te.xt Illention is maue of how the first Desana invade and settle the Vaupcs River and how. at each newly founded settlement. they "drank their beverages." The text says, literaHy. (/eitk6 irit', "water-urinking," but dellke) also means "beverages" and in this specific context arc meant narcotic potions based on Ballisteriofi.~is. The consumption of this hallucinogenic urink consti tutes an important ritual of taking posse ss ion of the hlnu, of estab lishing peaceful contact with other tribes (Ind. above all. of estab lishing the exchange of women. In tllis section tile text says quite clearly that "they urank their beverages" ... korere igc'palllu l'irib/(, lit. . "before-he-foaJ11ing-came out." that is "before he ejaculated. before he began to procreate and propagate his people ;" as one com l11entator expressed it 3. ,l'u//lIge·/Jora. lit.. "one-only·so ns,'· meaning . a male descent line. 4. miriapora, [it., "drownin!!-sons," sometimes referred to as "the visionary people." What is meant here arc the adolescent initiates who undergo the Furl/pari ritual. The term is derived from lIIiriri, "to drown," and ponj, "sons." The imagery is this: The initiate enters into the cosmic womb where he subJ11erges himself anu becomes "diluted"; this is meant by miriri. The term porti, "sons," also means "flames. light," in the sense of "sprouts. seedlings." The' concert of " to drown" is here compared to a process of c01l1bustion in which the initi<Jte becomes purified and is reborn. Tile text s<lyS: igci neogora bolJlw lIe:f!;agi:, lit., "he-in tile bcginning· l11et-beginning." probably <I reference to the encounter described l11uch "ltCI' , in section 20 I. 5.

the child was born at dil/siporopc"ri:: that is, "in the door." This last intcrprctation is acccptabic if we take into account that doors arc important points of transition and transformation, and that the door of a longhousc symholiscs a vagina. Hut this is an inversion; the newhorn is hrought into the longhouse-womh , instead of bCing born frolll it.

The conllllcntators said that shc was carrying thc child ill both arms. 9. According to thc commcntators, what happcncd at this instance was that all occupants of thc longhouse began to havc visions. These visions are described hcre in terms of pllOsphcncs. Wilat is callcd herc tem/Ill go/wri (k(;'ri) clclika, lil., "bilsket-figures (havc)-piccc," refcrs to an openwork lattice techniquc in whicll three elemcnts are intcrwov(!n in such a fashion as to form a pattern of fail'ly large hexagonal opcnings. These grid pattcrns are well-known ph()sphencs (Reichcl-l)olillatoff, 1978 , p. 45; Sicgcl and West. Figs. 6,7, II, 13, 14). Thc baskct callcd t('Yel1ll1 (the correct shamanic pronunciation would rather be li.irelllLi, strongly nnsalised) is approximately bottle shaped and is a womb-container in which women keep personal ornaments, such as necklaces, body paint, or other small belongings.

der'~ and "soft" connotations of this term. The etymology is ob scure; it can refer to magically pathogenic splinters, or to bar-shaped ear pendants, both object-> having a phallic or, at least , male gen erative connotation. The narrator added that this highly abbreviated te xt forms the basis of a ritual for newborn children, during which the shaman "puts into them their soul" (saara simpora).
24. nihigagare, 'to the infant;' this is another shamanic term of complex meaning. The verb nihiri means 'to solicit, to implore, to beg,' and, in another sense; 'to screech.' The commentators mentioned the image of a bird's nest full of shrieking Oedglings. Another meaning of nihiri is ' to gestate' and refers precisely to the nourishment and growth of an embryo; nihipo mean s 'state of gestation,' nihipo sillri, 'to impregnate.'
28. mi:"ii, the tree and fruit of urnari (LG) (Poraqueiba paraellSis.)

The mee waterfalls lie upriver from Ipanore. One commentator said: "Here they prepared /ife in the f orm of umari fruits," and pointed out that umari symbolised the womenfolk of the Tapir People. It was near the umari falls where the De sa na first met the Arawakans and abducted their women.

being located at the bottom of a lake or a ueep pool in the river. (See also, Reichel·Dolmatoff, 1975, pp. 134-136). Some commentators saidlthat the Yaje Child was born in the forest, while others said that birth took place in the front yaru of the maloca. 3. The copper ear·penuants have a very sharp clltting edge. 4. gl.lruny a (D). a shrub from which a red pigment is prepared (big· /Ionia c/lica); the vernacular LG name is cara)luni.

Inthe present case the actiOil refers not only to applying red body paint , but also to cleansing the infant and to 'casting' his body.

Occasionally the term can be ap· plied to almost any zigzag or ondulating design motif..and even to the pattern resulting from interweaving two palm leaves ror a wall panel. In the present context the term was said to stanu for crenellated lines of a luminous red color. The commentators ex· plained that the umbilic coru was the first yaje vine of Creation, and that certain sections of it prouuced differcnt llallucinations, 8, Here reference is made to another section of the umbilic cord, This one producing yellow·colored visions.

' Tile essential meaning of the term is to be found in two strong emotional experiences which. in the Desana mind. are identical: se xual orgasm and urug·induced hallucinations (See also Reichel·Dolmatoff 1971. 1975 passilll: CI'. lIliria·pora. In the present context. both. interpretations are applied: as we shall see. the crowd gatllerct.! inside tile maloca engages in sexual activities while. at the sight of the YajC Woman. the participants of the gathering arc overwhelmed by hallucinatory visions.

13. According to the Indians each tribe is tile 'owner' of one or more kinds of yaje. These categories are, of course. not based on Linnean systematics, but on aboriginal classifications in whicll distinct classes are established, not frOIll morphological characteristics, but according to the chemical effect the plant (or part thereof) has upon the human nervous system. The gathering in the·,womb-like 'water house' was an all-important event during which all Tukanoan peoples received their particular narcotic vine. 17. Thc cent.er of a maloca is considered to he the most sacred spot. It was said that, on this occasion, an oblong box (komorv), con taining ritual adornmcnt (buva) was standing in the center. On the symbolism of this box and its contents. see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971 , passim; 1975, p. ISS, el passim.
18. This episode represents a key situation in the traditional origins of Desana culture. The cOlllmentaries explain that the appearance of Yaje Woman heralded the introduction of the law of exogamy. Under the innuence of the drug and of sexual desires people had been committing incest. but now exogamy was to be the law. However, in this scene, "they did not understand." 19. Tile different monkeys or other animals which are quoted here as 'eating their tails,' are not animals in the zoological sense but are categories of 'other people.' The commentators explained that the expression 'to eat their tails ' (porent bari) meant that they 'ate their own flesh ,' in other words, that they were committing incest. This point was stated quite explicitely. bayapia; an unidentified narcotic plant (See Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1975.pp.134, 151, 152. 244 n4). 30. pesibirillvora, 'they did not understand;' from pes (ri, 'to understand and act rationally,' biri, negation. The narrator himself explained that the question "Who is Ihe father of this child?" alluded to the prevailing situation of promiscuity and incest, a state of chaos in which paternity was uncertain and "people ate their own nesh." But those present "did not understand" this message. "They all had losl their senses," the commentators said: "Onlv olle of them kept a clear head and it was he (our ancestor) who established the law of exogamF.

and explained that the root vallo (nasal.) is related to moho, mohori, 'to arm oneself, to impregnate oneself.' The expression was thus translated as 'value-impre~nated' and this was rephrased as: 'to receive a value , a code, a conviction , by way of a spiritual ex perience. ' vinuifga, from viuri, 'to select in order to point out a specific value, to feel attracted and motivated by a vision, to be illuminated.' When I suggested to translate the term as 'to be inspired,' a com mentator said: "No, inspiration is something; vinuega is not." In addition, it was mentioned that, if pronounced vi 'uri, the verb acquired the meaning of 'to obstruct, to hinder,' and this was elaborated in two additional statements, in these words: "viunege' means to arm oneself with what one sees in a narcotic trance. " and, "It means to obstruct the way of those wllo might try to destroy one's proper being." In summary, the expression was trans lated as, 'to gather courage, to acquire defenses.' [t should be added here that the second part of the term is derived from negari, 'to begin.' 2. ehta boho, 'rock crystal,' lit., 'stone-condensed.' Rock crystals are shamanic power objects that contain 'color energies' in their spectrum. Their crystaline transparency has seminal connotations. Their hexagonal shape is an organizational model and the six faces are 'limits' taburi; plural, tabu). For the symbolism of these crystals, see Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1978, 1979. nahsi, 'c rab.' The act that crabs turn a reddish color when being cooked , that is, when being made 'edible' by a transformational pro cess, provides an important metaphor in Desana theories of trans formation, color energies, and compatibility (see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1978, 1979). The expression nahsike tuu, IiI., 'crab-armored,' frum tUllri, 'to temper ,' refers to this transformation. 3. nyee, 'thing, object, element, factor, component.' dihpuru, 'vital pricipal.' abe yeru, 'sun-penis;' the suffix -sa means 'also, equally.' The Desana designate stalagmites and stalagtites as 'sun's penis,' and small particles are scraped off to be mixed with narcotic snuff. Like rock crystal, they are said to contain 'color energies.' (For details, see Reichel-Dolmatoff,1975). 4. duliplge', 'because.'

wou Id be gamu. diiro mahse', lit., 'blood-person;' what is meant here are the first ancestors, the diroa-rnahsd. duhari, 'to inherit,' duhariri, 'to bequeath , to return.' What is meant here is that the Sun Father bequeathed to both , male and female ancestors, the color energies contained in the rock crystal, which are paralleled by the luminous hallucinations of a narcotic trance. 6. pamuri, 'to germinate, procreate, froth, bubble.' buya, 'adornments,' generally referring to feather-crowns of dif ferent colors and, therefore, different fertility associations.

When speaking here of the earpendants it was said: "They are life, they are like the umbilic cord; they are a channel through which comes nourishment. "
7. iimeko mahsii; here, the 'white sun,' the energising sun, a synonym for the first Desana progenitor. pamuri mahse', 'progenitor·person.' doberi mahs(i, 'gestator-person.' These three personifications appear in many texts. The first , e'meko, represents the transformative energy of the sun and is imagined as 'w hiteness;' the second, pamuri, being of a yellow color, procreates on this earth, leading the Snake Canoe upriver, in the original settle ment; the third, doberi, is in charge of fetal development and is red. The expression ii emiire doyabimehe, translated here as ' that in comparable day ,' was explained thus: "The two colors have no value apart from man. They have no significance by thel1}selves. Onlv when they combine with the whiteness of the sun, in order to form a human being, they fulfill themselves." The tenil 'incom· parable' expresses the idea that man , seen as a produtt of these three energies, is not inferior to them,. but becomes 'exalted,' that is, he becomes more than the mere sum of his original components. The mere combination of male and female elements is meaningless without the transformative energy of the sun. The term doyabimehe was said to be derived from de:vari, 'to have in excess, in advantage, not to be inferior;' the particle bi signifies negation, while mehe refers to a personal quality .

This image, however, turns into that of a womb 'eager to be impregnated.' yinegarii, 'it began' from yiri, to do, to act,' ne'ngari, 'to begin.' 2. page mage', lit., 'father·son;' this expression is often used with the meaning of 'younger brother,' or 'younger son.' umus z', from umu, oropendola bird (lcteridae); the suffix -si indio cates the human essence of the shamanic bird; the term is related to rime', 'day, man,' einekori mahsa, 'Day People,' the first Desana.

dihpatabupi', IiI., 'headwater·tabu·in;' the meaning is that the head· waters of the Tiqllie constituted a tribal territory belonging to other Indians. goege', 'returning;' from goeri, 'to return, to go back.' Jiahpi, 'four.'
ke"rine, from ke' (plural, ki!"ri), a male particle relative to time and gender. dedinegahaM, 'he went away, disappeared;' from dediri, 'to leave, to perish, to disappear;' negahari, 'to begin.'

In one sense the meaning of the story is the discovery of sex. paari, 'to hit, to shake, to manipulate;' on ritual occasions the stick rattle is shaken so that it vibrates and the dry seeds, contained in a a hollow chamber of the staff, produce a rattling sound. This is called 'to plant, to procreate ,' the implicit meaning being an act of fertilization. 5. miroa, 'inclined , oblique;' from miroari, 'to lean over, to bend , to collapse.' dihake, 'to glide down, flow down , drip;' the image is that of drops of semen flowing from the stick rattle. 6. ifrene pere; 'three days later.' gahpi Idri nilzi, lit., 'yaje-had-infant;' the word nihi stands here for 'tender sprou t.

12. gahpimee, 'Yaje-Person.' niaro mera deyoanyumii, Jit., 'vision-with-he appeared visibly;' from niaro, 'trance state,' deyoriri, 'to manifest oneself, to become visible.' The suffix -mii signifies that he appeared in human form. 13.. bayarisibu, 'while he was singing.' The commentators emphasized that he was singing to the Yaje Child even before it had been born. kuusiri, 'complementary person;' from kuru, 'group, sib;' siri, from serid (nasaL), 'to solicit.' The term means: " the group one looks for." mahsepe', 'personage;' yahage', from yahriri, 'to steal.' The com mentators mentioned several alternative, but interrelated, inter pretations of this act. First, the cutting of the umbHic cord was said to represent participation of the group, in a vital power personi fied by the Yaje Child; second, the 4mbiJic cord symbolizes the yaje vine, and certain species of Banisteriopsis have knotty vines; third, the umbilic cord is a 'bubble-string' (se'meda), and by cutting off a knotty segment, each man or group acquires a seed. The term seme refers to a leguminous pod (Eperna purpurea), a term rela te to sumu, 'bubbles,' da, 'string. ' This can be an uterine symbol or, as some said, 'a chain of seeds,' In a forth interpretation, it was susg gested that a part of this 'bubble-string' (or seed-containing penis) became a clitoris and tilat, in this manner, women acquired a penis like organ for sexual gratification, An additional comment was this: "The earpendant is yellow and the bubbles of the umbilic cord are white,' alluding thus to the fertility symbolism of these colors, ohokariro, 'life, vitality, vitaL' nyahpa mahi mera, 'earpendant-bar-with.' siitamemuhuu, 'cutting;' from sitriri, 'to Cllt with force something complete; muhuri, 'to cut from here to there, to cut in one di rection,' IS, siisibugere, 'in those times;' from sit' (nasaL), 'this,' (plural, sill; sibu, 'period, time past;' siburi, 'the times ,' 16, gereri, 'to divide, to distribute.'

1. The scene is this: A few visitors have arrived at the house of an old shaman of high renown and have asked him to tell them of tribal origins. The old man quotes a brief fragment out of a much larger myth, in which intrauterine development and social origins are encapsulated. The manner of the old man's presentation is that of addressing a large audience at an important ritual. When he says "Where is there a place to talk?" he suddenly becomes aware of the circumstances and expresses his discontent with the environment in which this document was recorded: a dirty, mission-type one-family house of the poorest quality . The following comments were made by several informants. imupeori, 'to respect, to pay res'pects to someone;' from imuri, 'to demonstrate,' peori, 'to establish, to agree upon, to manifest, to put on record'. iridorege, 'to have invited to drink,' from iriri, 'to drink,' doreri, 'to order, to invite, to summon.'

I. First origins arc ,represented as an act of physical hirth. The 'river
or milk' (a/I/)ikoll dia) or 'lake of milk' (dilltam) is a primordial womb. 1 The first Desana is usually referred to as iimiiko malisii, 'Sun-Person.' or 'Day Person.' When speaking of the first mythical Desana settlers of the Vaupes territory, the name is pluralised as iimekori malisa,

'Sun-People,' half-divine beings who are said to be the true male ancestors. 4. The expression emeko dim mahse, lit.. 'sun-Ilesh-person,' refers to the male descent line: the father transmits 'flesh' (dii) while the mother transmits 'blood' (di/'). The form difO expresses an abstract quality and the meaning is that , at that particular time, only the male element was present. 5. viha, from vihari. The following comments were offered: "l'illari means To drag out something frolll nothingness amI to put it into a cellter. When YO li approach a wasps' nest and tliev all ('''Ielge, tlwt to is vihari. It refers to the act of coming out in panic fear, as if at a surprise attack." The first part of this statement seems to cor respond to the meaning of the present text. 6. ye"'(e, 'tree, wood, staff, stick.' The 'sun'sstafr is the phallic stick rattle which penetrated into the primeval womb. 9. It was added at this point that subsequently more male children were born. 10. 'To sit' has the multiple meanings of 'to re st on a seat. to settle. to settle clonw, to discuss at a meeting (at a 'sitting'), to meditate.' Ii. The term buva means, literally, 'adornments,' but can also stand for 'personal qualitites,' mainly in relation to male fertility and fe male fecundity. It was pointed OLlt that the term boga, 'energy,' was related to b/l)'a, and that it referred to the vital 'color energies' which. originally emanated from the Slln and energised the entire universe. The colors of ritual feather ornaments are always matched to the particular significance of hues , intensities, and values of the color prism (See Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1978). 2i. The commentators explained that by 'fruits (iit. , 'bits') of the tree,' sexual procreation was meant, the 'tree' being a phallic metaphor. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the 'giving of fruits' referred to the ritual exchange of women and of palm fruits. The essential fertility meaning is the same in all cases. 25 . )Jera, 'starch:' manioc starch symbolises female fecundity . 26. A ' field' or the act of 'clearing a field' symbolises women and pro creation . Horticultural activities are always seen as equivalent to sexual act ivit ies. 28. sil1),ahari, 'to rejoice.' However, the expression sinyaluiri boga nyomero, lit. , 'rejoice-energy-movemen t,' translates sinya/iari as 'breathing.' This refers to a rhythmic breathing patterns that ac companies contentment or meditation. The expression ' let LIS re joice,' can also be translated as 'let us breathe calmly.'

I. For a discussion of the concept of 'Bone Person,' see Text No. 4 n 6.
The term 'double house' refers here to a mythical maloca where two exogamic groups are meeting for an exchange of women. In some contexts the expression 'double house' refers to the two cerebral hemi spheres of the hum,1I1 brain. Since it is believed that the left hemisphere harbors the unconscious while the right one harbors the conscious. the concept of a 'double house' expresses a dreamlike state or a process of passing from unconscious behavior to conscious behaVior. In this text , the basic image is that of a house or a local descent group into which a stranger (<1 Desana) is accepted as a son in-law, but the image of a brain and brain functions is also present. 9. gllamo tree (lnga sp.): the Desana term is mere:guamo is vernacular. 13. kurll kuru, onomatopoetic description of the gurgling sound of a vessel being filled with water. by dipping it into the river. This particular sound has strong emotional associations, of young women bathing at a landing place , of food and drink being prepared and. in general, of homely female activities. The sound carries far over the water. 14.. imikeya. a reed mat or. rather , a fishing screen that can be rolled up. See also 23. The polished copper earpendants symbolically represent the testes. 26. pesibirisibu. lit., 'thinking-not-when he was.' 28. The motif of believing that poisonous blowgun darts are stinging insects, also occurs in stories in which evil bush spirits are being shot at by a hunter. 37. The Desana and their neighbors are virilocal and a man is most unlikely to live under the same roof wit h his mother-in-law. Bu t this myth refers to the early period when Desana invaders lived in the housholds of their Arawakan or other wife-givers. and worked for them in their fields . Another unusual point is this: In traditional malocas it is not the custom to string up one's hammock above that

of another person, but rather on the same level. 40. Tile commentators explained that Bone Person was now disguising himself into an ugly old man covered with festering sores, in order to test his wife. 46. kore, a large woodpecker. Of this bird , a myth fragment says: " The woodpecker , by its color and appearance, signifies the vagina and is called by the same name: kore. It was a mischievous character. He did not cOllle in the canoe with the First People but had already been created by the Sun. He conversed and drank beer and had many women. Once he made a bet with Duck, to see who could walk best in the forest. Woodpecker won. Formerly, his red crest had belonged to Duck, but now Wood becker had won it. Now Wood pecker is the penis and Duck is the vagina. He also bet to see who ~()uld climb up in the trees the longer. Duck lost because he (she) couldn't get any food." (See Reichel-Domatoff, 1971:265-266). The present text says that the Woodpecker People were " his [Bone Person's] men or companions, not his kinsmen; they were his Arawankan hosts, in the sense that they had been created before the Desana , that is, they were established in the Vaupes territory before the arrival of the Desana . tooo is an onomatopoetic expression describing the slow falling down of a tree or a rock, while gleee imitates the crashing sound of tile impact of branches upon the ground. 48. See n 23. The hiding of earpendants corresponds to the women's hiding of the yurupari mouthpiece . 52. The 'felling of trees' symbolises coitus or, occasionally, masturbation (detumescence) while the 'clearing of a field' refers to impregnation . The en tire episo de is one of sexual activity . 54. The red fruits of the patabti palm (Jessenia) have fertility associa tions. 58. The sharing of food with the mother-in-law stands for the man's sharing with her his sexual favors. 69. The commentators explained that now Bone Person transformed himself into an old woman [his mother-in-law]. 76. val-Iti, a bush spirit.
81. The words to the effe ct that he will keep or bury the earpendants under his hammock , alludes to his relationship with his mother-in law. 83. Part of this sentence is garbled and the translation is somewhat dubious.

93. mirinya carunt, place name; the word caruru (LG) is the name of certain algae from which the Indians prepare a salty condiment; for this reason, there are many places known by that name. 105. The motif of the 'unknown guest' occurs also in other texts. 113. The 'tail of the snake' is the clitoris. 116. Here follows a visionary scene: the participants in the ritual are under the influence of drugs and Bone Person is about to leave and
return to another dimension. His last words, about tlle intidelity or women have, according to the commentators. the character of general admonitions. 133. The expression 'to gather shrimp' has the connotation of uterine gestation. According to the Indians. shrimps look like human embryos. and the fact that shrimps turn red when being cooked demonstratcs an important transformational principle in terms of 'ripcness' and 'edibility' (Reichel-Domatoff 1978). The words "she was already a river Snake Woman" mean that she was bearing the child of a Snake Man. At this point. several commentators said that the Snake Man and his people were the ancestors of the modern Pira-Tapuya. In fact , the selfname of this exogamic group is pinu pura, 'snake-sons.' that is, Sons of the Anaconda. In Pira-Tapuya. the Desana I' turns into nand sincepira means 'fish' in LG. the term 'pira-tapuya' 11as mistakenly been translated as 'Fish People,' instead of 'Anaconda People.'
134. valzsti, the fruit of the rubber tree (Hcvea pallcijlora var. coriacea)). Because of the mucilageous flesh of this tripartite fruit. and also because of the milky sap of the tree , va/1St1 has a marked seminal connotation. The term l'a/lSLl also means 'rod' and. by association, is a synonym for phallus. Sometimes the concept of valzsu as a rubber tree becomes confused with that of a large Ficus tree the fruits of which form a hollow syconiul11, with uterine connotations. 147. The myth motif of the precocious child of doubtful paternity is also found among the Indians of the Gran Chaco (rv](~lraux 1946: 97 -98). 156. This part of the text is garblcd and seems to have been condensed by the narrator. The image of the 'snake falling on top of the roof was said to allude to the woman's adultery with the Snake Man. The 'break' tllis impact made upon the roof may allude to a structural difference between house types.

Text No. 14 Notes and Commentaries
I. This text begins with the well-known episode of 'Man Alone,' abandoned on top of a tree, which has been analysed in great detail by Claude levi-Strauss.
tnihi (Euterpe oleracea Mart.), uasai, assai (LG). The fruits of this tall palm tree symbolise, by their clusters, a kingroup. One in formant said: "A bunch of mihi fruits is the best expression of fertility." The younger brother's 'search for a cluster of palm fruits' symbolises his endeavor to establish contact with potential wife givers. 2. Forked poles, in fact, all forked objects or shapes have, according to context, the connotation of a crotch and of sexual activity. 5. Cf. n 2. Since it is common that several married brothers live in the same longhouse, adulterous relations are a frequent topic of gossip and seem to be fairly common. Younger brothers usually accuse their older brothers; in fact, among most Tukanoans, relationships between brothers are very tense. 6. In myth, the Sun Father adopts occasionally the shape of an oro pendola bird. These birds (Icteridae) are called umu or umusl and are of symbolic importance. Their purse-shaped nests are com pared to testicles or to womb-like structures, and their colonies are said to be models of community life. Because of their yellow feathers they are associated with the fertilising and energising power of the personified Sun (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971:101-102, 179,196-197; 175:155). 10. The expression 'to go to fetch water' has sexual overtones. 18. in this myth, adultery and fratricide are said to be the original sins because of which Death became instituted. In other myths it is rather incest that was the primordinai sin. 22. kaya, an unidentified bird ; perhaps from gai, a small green parrot. 28. This mushroom is of a whitish and/or purplish color and is often referred to as abe yeeru, 'sun-penis.' Its name , dihtibege, is derived from dihti, 'boneless, flexible,' and bege, a terms with the following alternative meanings: 'ancestor, old man, little oldster, odd creature, something ugly and disgusting, ulcerated.' The epithet yeeri bege is applied to a man who is said to be sexually very active. of a very knowledgable person one might say that he is sii bege, 'that (wise) oldster.' By the term begege one can refer to any animal, regardless

~9. vii kasenero, the House Wren (Troglodytes aedos). The Desana name means 'house·belonging to' or 'house-little-piece-of.' This bird nests under the ridgepole and, during the day , perches on the roof. According to the Desana it sings: senene-senene. 31. The concept that illness and death are caused by pathogenic splinters or thorns that are introduced into the organism by magical means, is fundamental to Tukanoan disease theory and shamanic practices. 34. The Me)'u Falls form an important landmark in mythical geography They are located on the lower Pira-parana, near the equatorial line
which marks cil/e dehko. 'day-center.' The large boulders at these falls, and the nearby Rock of Nyi. show many ancient petroglyphs that are interpreted by the Indians as commemorating specific episodes of the origin myths (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975: 140 - 142). The 'coffins' of tile present text are two ablong boulders. 35. !tapliCLI (LG), place name in the region of the Macu-parana. an affluent of the lower Papuri river. The Desana call the spot elitaFabll, from elitu, 'stone,' ),abll. ·deformed.· In the same region are the Waillal1lbi Falls, another important landmark and another group of petroglyphs said to be related to the origin myths (Reichel Dolmatoff 1971 :5. ~8 , 30. 3~, 36, 70,169.189.247 : 1975'137, 245n 12). 36. I have translated the verb oreri as ·to weep , to cry, to mourn. ' The Sun Father's (or other Creator beings') travells over the Vaupes territory symbolise , according to the commentators, the spread of the First People . The verb orer; also means 'to spring forth. to give birth, to froth, to germinate. to ejaculate.' In fact, the different way stations on the Sun Father's path are said the consecutive spots where the First People established themselves, cleared fields, and built houses. It was there where they established contact with the already established tribes. 37. The shamanic stick rattle is called yeege, a name related to a cluster of terms which inclued yee, 'shaman. jaguar.' yeeri. 'to copulate,' yeeru, 'penis. phallus,' etc. The stick rattle consists of a long (ca. ~.30 mets.). thin, lance-shaped staff of black or reddish hardwood, the upper end of which has a small oblong chamber containing a few dry seeds which produce a rattling sound when the somewhat elastic stick is shaken in a ritually prescribed manner. It is a phallic object and is used on many ritual occasions. On his mythical travels , the Sun Father pushed his stick rattle here and there into the ground

in order to 'find the center' where the stick would stand upright. The search of this precise spot is an important myth motif and refers to a spot on the equatorial line where the Sun Father's staff, that is, tile sun's ray s, would be vertical. Once this spot has been located the first Man climbed down on it from the sky. In other versions the staff is abe yeeru, the Sun's penis, and from it dripped the Sun's semen onto the earth. The shamanic stick rattle is thus an axis mUl1di that connects the earthly and heavenly spheres (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975 , passim). The place name mentioned in the present text isguiru; Cf. infra. 38. The name guitereboa is derived fr om guiru, 'fear, rright, panic,' tere, a grid pattern or zigzag pattern , ror example in basketry, mats, house walls of interwooven palm leaves, painted bark cloth, body paint , etc. The term is used to describe the colorrul designs that are said to have adorned the Anaconda Canoe in which the First Men t raveled on the Vau pes. However, tae aIso stands ror certain luminolls patterns perceived under the influence or narcotic drugs and which are technically known under the name or phosphenes (See Reichel-Dolmatorr 1978). Some missionised Indians who were present , said that the celestial visions of a Christian mystic would be called tere. The root boa can rerer to a ' local environment,' a specific dimension or existence, or it can rerer to putreraction and decay (boari, 'to rot.') The combination or these three concept: fear/ hallucination /pu treraction , constitutes a fitting name ror a cemetery. 4::. The term emekciri mahsa, 'Day People' or Sun People, is often mentioned in myth and ritual, sometimes in complementary oppo sition to l1)'amikeri mahsa or nyamiri mahsa, 'Night People' (See Reichel-DolmatotT 1980). The 'Sky House' is the House of Thunder' mentioned in Text No. 43. Several wild-growing fruits that ·have a mucilaginous flesh. such as Star Apple Cltrvsophyllum cailllito L.), called kare (D), gllallla (Inga sp.), called mee, and vahsu (Hfvea sp.) have marked seminal connotations (Patifi'o 1963: L pp. 235 ·- 240, 385-386; Reichel Dolmatoff 1976: 175 : 197 1 passim; 1975 passim). 44. ahpikol1 dia, 'River of Milk ,' ari underwordly region , a primeval womb, the main axis of the Desana Paradise (1971 :46,64; 1975: 95; 1976:172-173 , 187,200). 46. pamuri vii, 'germination-house' (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971 :25ff; 1975:84,110,143, 146,178, 191); also called 'House of the Waters' (dia vii) (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975: 146 ff).

Text No. 15 - Notes and Commentaries
This version of the foregoing myth (Text No. 14) was dictated by the same informant, several months after he had related the first version. The fol lowing notes refer to some points that where not discussed when com menting upon the first version. 6. The 'center' refers to the sun's position at one of the equinoxial dates. 19. The Tukanoan Indians keep their ritual ornaments, such as feather crowns, neckla ces, painted barkcloth aprons , etc., in large oblong bo xes made of pla.ited leaves and ca nes. These bo xes are ca lled komoro (D) and have uterine associat ions. Ropes of monkey hair are an important part of ritual attire (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975: 148--149; 1976: 175). 28. A very strong jungle vin e, botanica lly unidentified, is said to have been used by certain ce lestial beings to descend to earth. In another image human beings ascend to Heaven on a vine, that is, by means of a hallucinogenic potion prepared from the Banisteriopsis vine. 57 . sai fish (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1976: 182 ). 80. In former times many Tukanoan tribes used earpendants of ham mered copper, shaped like short tubes split in half; more recently I have seen them made of brass sllOtgun shells cut lengthwise. It is said that if someone's pendants turn inward , the co ncave part turn ing toward the face instead of outside, this is a sure sign of the we~rer's approaching death (See also, Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975:
n, 79, 83,135,153; 1981 inpre ss. ) 8~. Reference is made here to a channel. a hollow , in a bou Ider. The verb varari has the foll owing alternative meanings , depending upon the conte xt: ' to mold , to rub , to polish, to perfect , to finish , to copUlate.' The jumping and ' licking ' of the many little fish that pass through this water-worn hollowed -out part of the boulders, is likened by the Indians to sexual activity. 85. Rock of Starch; this name refer s to a dark mineral formation in which appear whitish veins and spots of qu artzit e, associated with the mythical preparation of manioc starch or with a now of manioc gruel (See Reiehel-Dolmatoff 1975: 101). 9 2. boo fire; this expression remained unexplained. It might be re lated to booru, 'tapioca,' another element to which se minal or

fecundity energies are attributed: boo yee, 'boo-copulate,' a magic quartz crystal belonging to boo mahse, Starch Person (See Te xt No. 37). According to several informants the term boo indicates " the abundance of starch", that is, of female fecundity. 95. Swallow-tailed kite (Elanoides forficatus). 96. vahpiru (lake), unexplained; vahpi, 'four;' the suffix -ru was said to express the quality of something. tubular, "like a blowung, a penis, or a holJow cane,' in the words of one informant. 110. Night tree, duhpianIU tree; unexplained . Unfortunately, during this session but few other people were present and subsequent dis cussion did not provide any further comments on this and other questions.

This fragment is part of a conversation with shaman Payatege who spontaneaously referred back to the episode mentioned in Text No . 12. The following are a few comments that are made during this discussion. I. betari, 'lazy, inactive." See Text 4 n6. 3. tuari, 'to lean on something.' 3. deyori , 'to show, to exhibit.' piari, 'to go ou 1.'
8. bibubohsagora; from biburi, 'to safekeep,' bohsari, 'to protect.' emari, 'to take away.' 11. suari, 'to penetrate' [into the forest], also a metaphor for coitus. inyayiri, 'to laugh, to mock;' from inyari, 'to look,' and y iri, ' 'to do.' The commentators explained that, in shamanic language, the ex pression inyayeeri meant 'to see-to copulate,' meaning, 'to satisfy a desire .'
13. panigikuriyuhpe, from paari, 'to fell,' nigiri, 'to stand upright.' The expression 'to clear a field' is a metaphor for coitus. It was sug gested that the 'lazy,' that is, impotent husband, had regained his virility .

Having killed him he exclaimed : "Scoundrel , thus you perish for your misdeed" and , throwing him aside, he went forward , while she went away. 5. After he had thrown him aside and after she had gone , he wrapped the body into a mat and pushed it into a thicket. 6. When he had thus got rid of him, all the birds began to talk among themselves, about what had happened , "What will be the end of the Day People , of the Sun himself, if they go on like this ') What will happen one of these days and how will it end if they act like this')" 8. The Sun , his father, heard what [the bird s] were saying and said: " They are mad doing this;" he searched around and heard the House Wren saying: " Why do you search if you are that close to him?" This is how he found him and he exclaimed: "This is my son." and, seeing that they had cut off his penis, he put in its place a mushroom. 9. The [Sun Father] carried him out and when he passed a too plant the bird sang: "A spirit is coming'sio sio."



The First Death 229
10. "This is a bad omen for me," said the [dying] on; "All right, that's nothing; everything will be all right." lsaid his father]; but when he dragged him out he got entangled and fell. II. When he stumbled he let him fall, and so he died. 12. This was the origin of Death among us. 13. This is how the long agony began and this is the origin of the present ritual for the dying. 14. He had died indeed. 15. After this event, Day Person went to search for the central spot of the day, in order to bury him. 16. In his quest he thrust the stick rattle [into the ground], but it stood inclined. 17. After this, and still not having found [the spot] because of them, he traveled upriver with his staff. 18. Thus he went upriver and during his ascent, twice his earpendants turned around. 19. "Why does this happen to you?" he heard [a voice] saying: "Do you, the father of the rays of the sun, want to act like your son?" He wondered: "Will this happen to me?" Pushing open the earpendants he took courage and began to reflect: "Is this going to happen to me?" And so he went upriver. 20. Pushing upriver, he measured with his stick rattle in search of the center of the day. 21. Arriving at the headwaters of the river he turned around to descend once more and away from the river, at the House of Terror, where they [the dead] are, the stick rattle stood upright in the center. 22. In this center, at the central spot where he had thrust the stick rattle, he buried the bundle.
23. And there all people found [a place1for their burials. 24. This is what the old people said had happened in the beginning. 25. Here it ends.

I . It was said that by abe, the personified sun was meant, the son of the Sun Father. As in other mythological episodes the landing place provides a circumscribed erotic context. marapo, 'wife, spouse,' female form of marape' "husband.' The term was said to be derived from marari (nasaL), a word that refers to small, luminous red dots perceived during drug-induced hallucina

tions. The appearance of these dots is said to accompany sexual arousal. ohkavereita, ' kinsman, kinswoman;' from ohko, 'seed,' ohkdri, to make waterproof a gourd vessel,' a metaphor for impregnating a woman. The term ohkalJereita was interpreted as "part of the same seed, part of the same flavor." 2. yuunyumi, from yuuri, 'to lie in ambush , to spy .on someone.' The narrator interrupted here and said that, since the adulterous woman was the wife of the Sun Father, the episode refers to mother/son incest.
3. oyarare, from oyari, 'to lay down.' purinyumi, from puriri, 'to blow.'
4. mebege, 'scoundrel, rogue ;' from me, 'you,' bege, 'old one.' pesibiraya, from pesiri, 'to understand,' biri, 'negation;' lit. 'for your ignorance, your misbehavior.' koamaha, from koari, 'to push away, to throw aside,' related to goari, 'to sweep, to wipe off.' 5. ige sirike, 'the dead, the corpse;' from siriri, 'to die.' imikeyaru, a mat. The narrator explained that a mat of canes was meant, a sort of fishing screen. This is symbolically a very important artifact the etymology of which he explained thus: imika are very small fish, while fmika is smoke or clouds. In both cases a floating mass of very small particles comparable to human semen or to pollen, are referred to . The element keya signifies a grill , a smoking platform. The term imikeyaru thus refers to an artifact used to per form a transformation. The associations are: fish being smoked, a seminal substance being sifted , an object being enveloped in order to make it pass from one state into another (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1979 :282-283). simuhLi, 'to put up, to put away;' from siuri (nasaL), 'to push, to ex tend ,' muhuri, 'to raise, lift up.' peoka yuhpe, from peari, 'to leave on top of something.' It is un derstood here that he put the bundle on top of some branches and that the person was still alive , though dying. 6. mirimage pora; the narrator said that this expression was derived from miriri, to drown,' pora, 'sons,' and that it referred to miria pora, 'saturation-sons,' or 'drowning-ones.' There were the male initiates at a yuruparf ritual , but the expression also alluded to sexual arousal and orgasm. He added that during the ritual a number of birds are called upon, such as a small pigeon (buha), kingfisher

(sara), and tinamou (nyairo). All these birds have phallic or fertility connotations and are , collectively, called pora, 'sons,' or, rather, 'species.' The commentaries run: "At tha t time [of the yurupari ritual] the initiates are almost drowned by sexual desires. Shamans must channel these drives and this was what yurupari is all about. Here the birds symbolise sexual mores." Another commentator offered an additional interpretation by saying: " The birds talked among themselves and said: 'How can it be that humans behave like animals? How can they destroy themselves, they being the sons of the energy of the sun? They are destroying the circuit." This refers to the important cultural tenet of the Desana , that animals have no incest" rules and therefore, do not take part in the cosmic energy circuit of the sun, that is, that only Man is trans cendental.

This section was translated as: "How shall they prosper?" but the etymology is doubtful. 8. goroverata, ' they are mad ;' from goroverl!ri, 'to become deranged , to be mad ;' from gorori, 'places,' vereri, 'to break away, to become deviant. ' dihtibege; the name of the mushroom was analysed thus: dihti, 'thick, deformed, swollen' (phallus), bege, 'old one.' 9. It was commented that, when the bird noticed that the body was still alive, it referred to it as a 'spirit.' 10. yere nyepuriro arikami, lit., 'to me-bad very-it speaks.' tarapiarike, from tarari, 'to drag,' piari, 'to emerge.'

13. siribukliri, 'dying,' lit. , 'dead-almost;' sirikeomaa, from siriri, 'dead , to die,' ke6ri, 'image, symbol;' this expression refers to a comatose state; the dying man is an 'image of death.' verenigiburi. 'ritual words;' from verenigiri, 'to speak rituaJly ,' bu, 'topic, theme, message' (plural, buri). 14. The emphasis is upon the first dead. 15. ohogoro, lit.. 'seed-place.'

16. negahakayoro, to thrust;' from niigahari, 'to plant, to stick into.' dihpake, 'inclined , bent , oblique, askew .' 17. game dahirore, 'because of them;' lit., 'together (mutual)-done they,' or 'because of what they had done together,' that is , the incest. 18. nyahpa mahi, from nyahpa, 'copper,' mahi, 'bar, strip of metal or wood.' The term nyahpa is said to be related to the verb yabari, 'to tlash, to shine.' mobiatua, from mobiari, 'to turn toward the face.' When a person is dying or when his vital and sexual powers decline, it is said that "his earpendants are turning." The image is that of two concave retlectors turning inward. The symbolism of this was explained as " two pendants, the testes" lacking virility. Others said that "the Sun's earpendants turn twice a year ," in June and December, that is, on the solstices. 19. When asked whose voice he heard, the commentators replied im mediately: "His wife's" (emekori mahso, 'Day Person-woman.) abe dari, 'sun-threads,' the rays of the sun, the sun's fertilizing energy. What follows here describes, according to the commentators, llOW the Sun's wife "pushed open " (simpanugu ) the earpendants. The term also means 'to put straight , to bend into shape;" in other words , she "straightened them out so that they would shine once more," that is, he restituted the Sun Father's lost, or rehnquished, sexual potency. yuaparinegaa, 'he reflected, he thought ;' from yuarii, 'to lift up one's head,' pariri, 'to get up, to become erect.' This image is called 'to reflect,' but it can also refer to sexual arousal. 20. omage ige keo kuriyuhpe, lit., 'searching-he measured-while he went;' from keori, 'to measure, to test , to ' sound out;' this action refers to both , the quest for the 'central spot ,' and to coitus. 2 1. maharogere, 'away' or 'apart' [from the river]; that is, inland, in the intertluvial forest. guitere vii, 'terror-house,' the 'house of fear;' this is a shamanic term for 'cementary, burial ground.' 22. pore, 'bundle, parcel;' here, the corpse is meant.

I. nihikoege; this term is commonly employed to designate the Maku Indians and is equivalent to 'servants.' The etymology was explained thus: nihiri, 'to implore, to beg, to solicit,' koari, 'to carry' (a child), -ge, male suffix. If strongly nasalised, nihiri means 'to give to eat, to mutually care for another, to collaborate.' The term also implies readiness or eagerness to be impregnated and, during certain days of the month, a woman's womb is said to 'implore.' However, there is a double meaning to the expression nihikoege: on the one hand, the Desana often keep Maku women as child nurses; on the other hand, the verb koari can mean 'to bear a child,' when linked to the

This text was chantee! in the stereotyped ritual intonation. As can be seen from the original wording, there is a great deal of repetition and changes in the emphasis on certain words. The text begins with a formal greeting to the assembly. 2. anza, from amari, 'to search;' here the long and difficult quest is spoken of, in search of friendly relationships with other tribes, and of ritual exchange of marriagable women. vererare, from vereri, 'to speak, to converse, to entertain a ritual dialogue with a complementary grou .' vera koa, 'starch-groud;' a gourd vessel containing starch is a com mon symbol for a woman of childbearing age. muru, 'tobacco;' was is meant here are the large cigars which are ritually smoked during these exchange gatherings. Cigars are, in all essence, phallic elements, but a female connotation is added by the spiralling, funnel-shaped cover leaf, which, because of its cone shape, symbolizes the vulva. puribiarari, from puriri, 'to blow,' birari, 'to play' (music.) miriapora, the male initiates. yuhu yebaga l11eheta, lit., 'one single-earth-not being;' or 'one same-earth-not being.' The meaning is that the Desana were for eigners, invaders. 3. emeko; this expression refers to the male element, the Desana. pirisadobokanihara; from piriri, 'to let be,' saari, 'to introduce, to put inside, to perceive;' the expression pirisaari, if used aone ,

means 'to .perceive an abstract idea. to inquire into. to go on a quest:' JoMri. 'to found, to leave established , to establish a way of life.' The expression kani/l(ira has the following alternative meanings: a) the literal translation is 'they did;' b) ' they impregnated;' c) 'they received an inspiration, they had an intuition.' 4. Jere viian' is here the name of younger brother. The name was ex plained as being derived from dereri, a verb used to describe the small luminous rhomb-shaped grid patterns of phosphenes perceived during a narcotic trance. Since rhomboid shapes are associated with the vagina, the element Jere has a female connotation. The term veari was said to refer to another drug-induced phosphene, described as tiny sharp spikes set in a grid pattern, similar to the grain of a nail-file OJ of pumice stones. Be cause of sexual associations, such as 'rubbing, rasping,' the element )leari is said to have a male conno tation. The name consists. therefore , of a conjunction of concepts. (See also. Reichel-Dolmatoff 197" C'f Index p. 289.) arigea, lit._ 'saying-he;' from driri, ' to speak.' However, when nasal ising the word and pronoucning it ariri, it comes to mean 'to have the intention.'

This expression refers to the hallucinatory perception of a multitude of swirl in!, red dots, an image that is associated with insemination and embryonic growth stages (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1978).

It expands but does not allow its starting-point to be pierced. This is the essence of authority, of wisdom, of divine innuence." Further discussion clarified that what was meant here was that tribal and sib origins are not conceived as arbitrary, unrestrained events in the dark past, but that they can be traced to certain ethnohistorical events, to specific 'central' facts. , 5. turdme; the last syllable is nasalised.

An alternative derivation could be from payari, 'smooth, careful.' Both deriva tions are uncertain. suri mahse, lit. 'cloth-person.' ThecommentatoIs said that this was the correct tran~lation but that it became modified as soon as one pronounced it sUllri, a verb that means 'to mix, to change sl1ape, to change one's aspect.' This verb is used when referring to children born of a forbidden union . paari ma/tse baYlirure, lit. 'beante-person-singer;' from paari, 'to beat.' However, the commentators observed, if the verb is pro nounced pa'ari, it means 'to creep, to clamber.' The image referred to is that of a specific body posture assumed during ritual singing and which is greatly admired by the audience. The singer 'crouches and creeps, lowering his head .'

This text enumerates several sib progenitors of the Desana, quoting their names or, rather, nicknames, and adding a few explanatory words.

The term was said to be related to ohkiri, a word referring to a mat-weaving technique in which one set of paralJel elements is interwoven 'by jumps', that is, alternatingly , with a flexible perpendicular body of another set of elements. The corrimentators said that the ancestor "spoke in jumps." 25. seme peyanl, a slightly fermented and sour-tasting beverage made from the fruits of the seme tree (£perna purpurea).

I. see (or see, see pim); 'gestation-snake.' This is the anaconda inside which the First People traveled upriver. The name was said to be derived from seeri, 'to gestate, to nourish a fetus." One commentary says: "The stick rattle contains pebbles [in its hollow chamber]. This is seeri. We emerged from the Anaconda-Canoe and so the snake wa s our womb. Therefore we must always remember our origins. The pebble in the stick rattle is an embryo in the womb. The shaman shakes the stick rattle , so we will remember what happened ." In other commentarjes the pebbles are compared rather with semen. miuri, 'to flood, to overflow .' It was said that the anaconda caused the waters to rise in order to swim with ease over the rapids.

3. tuadobo, from tuadobori, 'to obstruct, to dam.' 6. goame, ' Bone Person' is here personified as Tinamou. a game bird of the Family Tinamidae. 7. vai bege, lit. , 'beast-old,' a term that is occasionally used to desig nate ancestral beings (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 198 1). 8. ehta boho koa som, 'rock crystal gourd vessel,' a shamanic term for womb. 13. For the Desana, the symbolic importance of tinamou is connected with the following characteristics of this bird: its protective coloring during the breeding season makes it almost invisible to its natural enemies; its yellowish colors have a seminal connotation; its shiny brilliant eggs are of striking hues of blue or red and symbolise the fundamental 'color energies.' The tinamou's call, described by the Indians as a long-drawn cadenced yai-rororororo, is said to be a rallying signal; as a matter of fact , tinamous are easily attracted by a hunter imitating their call. The fact that only the male bird leaves the nest , followed by a line of chicks, makes it a model of patrilineal descent, in the eyes of the Indians. Some additional associations are these: the blackish spots on the wings and the feathers of the back, were caused by flying sparks during the World Conflagration, when the bird tried to protect its eggs. The spots imitate a jaguar's pelt marks and thus the tinamou is a shamanic bird. Its very name, yairo, is related to yai (T) , yee (0). -jaguar, shaman,' and the suffix -ro indicates an abstract supernatural quality. 16. yuhke mahsd, lit. 'tree-people,' negiiri mahsd, ' forest-people.' By these designations the Maku Indians are referred to, at the time when the first Desana invaders appeared in the Vaupes territory. 18. pia biraka murinyora, 'they came out to do harm.' The verb biari also means 't o play ,' but in this case the meaning is that of sexual and magical aggression by disease-causing agents.

' 8. veanyora, from veari, 'to abduce to carry off,' 13. The expression 'they too knew' refers to certain animals that were saved by finding refuge in the canoe. 14 . mirinyora, from mirf, 'to drown.'
15. keorire, from keori jto measure , to reckon , to calculate.' j 6. abe can mean 'sun, moon, month;' in the present context the time span was said to be one month. 17. ),uhkc, 'tree,' here , 'vegetation.' 26. Tinamou found protection in a growth of bunch-grass. This episode, the survival of Tinarnou, was elaborated in the following manner: In the beginning of time, after first fertilizing the world with the flood. the Sun went on to 'cook the world,' that is. Sun was gestat ing and transforming it. Tinamou was a phallic bird and hid in the vagina of the Daughter of the Sun, represented on earth bya gourd vessel. After the World Conflagration. the bird emerged alive and sang: nyairororororo, an expression wich wus glossed as either: "I am cooked," "I am done," or "I am saved." The reason why Tinamou was the only surviver of the World Fire lies in the fact that th.is bird lays brilliant-shelled eggs of many different colors and thus became the savior of 'color energies' in which all life is based (See Reichel-Dolmatoff 1978). 29. It is remarkable that the narrator, in order to say 'earth .' uses the term nihku, instead of yeba. While yeba means 'soil, earth, home stead.' the term nihku has the more abstract meaning of 'land, country,' as, for example, in the expression: mari nihku, 'our country,' that is, the Vaupes territory. Although. at first, the story of see appears to be based on that of Noah 's Ark, the native elements are undeniable.

I. Sun wanted to copulate with his daughter [while] she was menstru ating ; the Creator warned him and said: " You must not do this;" for this reason, after death, Moon gathers the bones, with the brilliance of her garment. 2. When another man noticed this , he hid the garment and covered it with a vessel. / The garment ? / Yes. 3. Coming out [Moon] looked for it [but] did not find it. 4. "What happened to me that I lost my garment? What happened to my light ?" she said and looked upward. 5. It was dark . / It was dark? / Yes. 6. What he [the man] had covered, was shining a little bit. 7. "Something is shining there," she [Moon] said and uncovering it , she found the garmenL 8. Taking the garment she put it on and went up to the sky.

Text No. 24 - Notes and Commentaries
I. igo berego, lit., 'she-fasting.' The verb bereri menas 'to fast, to abo stain , to undergo the ritual of first menstruation.' It is this last meaning our text refers to; the moon is surrounded by a halo which is compared to the enclosure inside which a girl sits during her puberty ritual. tuadeage, from tuyiIri, 'to join, to approach, to get together, to copulate,' deari, 'to desire.' mahsudige, lit., 'created-he who,' that is, the invisible Sun Father, principle of cosmic energy. sirido, from siriri (nasal.), 'to die.' Here the text says: igo sirido pere, 'after her death ' will the moon eat the bones,' an expression which was glossed as: "while she is in the enclosure." This expres sion, in turn, means, " while she is dying (or dead)" and refers to the idea that the puberty ritual represents the death and subsequent rebirth of the girl. To this, the following commentary was added: "During menstruation she sheds blood and is not fertil. Afterwards she eats yellow bones." At this point the commentators said that the phenomenon of a lunar eclipse gives rise to the image of Sun copulating with Moon . In punishment of this incest (Sun being Moon's father) Moon descends to devour the bones of dead people who have commit ted incest. The yellow color of the full moon is attributed to this food, but also symbolises fertility. The 'eating of bones' is another metaphor for coitus, if we remember the phallic connotation of 'bone.' tn some images it is Moon herself who takes off her brilliant garment or feather-crown and hides it , in order to . dig up the bones in total darkness (the three nights of the dark of the moon); in other images someone steals the garment and hides it. Referring to the ' brilliant garment,' one commentator said: " The garment of Moon enfolds the bones of the incestuous woman who is dead, because she is inside the enclosure ."

2. soropa, lit. , 'vessel-plate.' What is referred to here is a large clay vessel , approximately shaped like an inverted cone, of the type used for bee r. beari, 'to cover, to hide. '
4. emarogere, from emaro, 'high up,' gere, 'in.'
6. The image of a bit of light escaping from under the vessel, matches that of a near total eclipse. 7. pagugarige, from pagllri (nasal.) , 'to uncover , to open up.' 8. omaa, from omari, 'to pu t on , the carryover the shou Iders.' emesige, from emese (nasal.), 'sky, space, celestial vault.'
9. boyomediyuhpe, from boyori, 'to shine, to illuminate ,' medihuri, 'to cast a line , to shine downwards .' 12. mahsurare, from mahsuri, 'to create, to transform :' The text says: ige mahsurare, lit., 'his-created of,' meaning, 'of his creation.' sirn)gupeora; this expression was said to be derived from sinyuri (nasaL), ' to copulate,' which is a very vulgar term in everyday language, but not so in shamanic language. The commentators said that the invisible Sun Father cohabited with the Universe and thus 'left his mark ' upon man and the stars. The term si(n)gupeora was said to imply concepts such as 'power, faculty, thought, relation ship: but these meanings were not further elucidated. Other com men taries interpreted the 'mark' in the following manner: Moon pushed Sun away with her blood-stained hand and thus 'marked his face, but Sun transferred these spots to Moon 's face, as a warning. 13 . dihparu; this noun means 'essence, unit , entity, something formed of variou s components.' My translation of neka dihpanl, as 'a mul titude of stars' is admittedly weak. The word is derived from dihpa, 'headwaters, place of birth.' In some contexts, stars have a seminal meaning; for example, dew drops are called 'the saliva of stars,' it being understood that saliva is an equivalent to semen. It seems that this text is badly garbled and that the narrator has combined in it, bits and pieces of other myths and tales.

The action develops at Yavarete, near the spot where the Papuri river joins the Vaupes. TraditionaJJy , this is Maku territory and this myth describes the first contacts the Desana invaders made with groups already settled in this region.



264 Text No. 25 - Notes and Commentaries
I. Old komekateame was said to be one of the first raiders who, in his time, established contact with a Maku group called Gourd Ja· guar People, who inhabited the lower course of the Papuri. He married a Gourd Jaguar woman and so her people are his penyara or brothers-in-law. Etymologically, this name was analysed thus by the commentators: kome, 'metal, a metalic color, a shiny bluish green;' kaa, 'fence, limit,' tuame, 'he or that which approaches;' that is, 'he who seems to have a metalic color,' as one commentator put it. What is meant here is the common botfly . This insect is attracted by foul odors and is, therefore, related to the vultures. The commentators pointed out that rotten fish turn a metalic color and, as we shall see, komekateame is related to Fish Women. The botfly is said to be a very stupid animal which sometimes will sting a Jiving being, believing it to be dead, but "will flee as soon as it sees fresh blood."
2. komekateame's grandsons are Diroa-mahsa; they are young men trying to find mates. 4. Relationships between the Gourd Jaguar People and komekateame are still uneasy and the old man fears that his grandsons's rash behavior might further upset it. 7. The two young men are quite aware of the tensions but are eager to go, above all in order to meet the women . . vahagera, 'enemies;' the expression is derived from valia, 'value, price,' and gera (nasaL), and this from gurari (nasaL), ' to extract something valuable, to take out, to grasp.' The 'valuable' element are the women. 8. Dance ornaments symbolise courtship and fertility. The youths are preparing themselves for an expedition of courtship or abduction of women. 9. The old man wanted to go alone and intentionally placed the baskets in such a way as to leave no space for other passengers. sablara, from saari (nasal.), 'to embark, ' biari, 'to fill.' aituriamepeo, from airi, 'to take, grasp,' turiari, 'to put one on top of another, to organise in layers,' peori, 'to leave there, let stay.' The noun turi means 'section, dimension, class, category, side,' and what is implied here is that the old man had a boat full of different categories of women, as exchange gifts. In other words, he is the 'owner of women' while the two youths have no mates nor exchangeable sisters.

10. From here to section 24 an important interlude is described. The boys go fishing; they catch a spirit snake, hack it into sections and thus 'create' a large number of fish. Symbolically they create women who are now transformed and made 'edible' by smoking them on a roast. These palatable Fish Women constitute the gift the two youth intend to exchange for Gourd Jaguar Women. The supernatural oro pendola-snake is here identified with 8 male shamic being and its being cut into pieces parallels shamanic dismemberment as a first step to transformation. The symbolic connection includes the mythical Snake Canoe which also was divided into sections, each one occupied by a different sib. Since the basketry trays, with their interwoven designs, also symbolise female elements, the oropendola snake and the old man 's loaded canoe parallel the story of the first settlement. Although all this was not explained in these precise words, the basic symbolic connections were stated in a quite unmis takable manner. Catfish Creek; the Desana name is meganya; in LG it is called nyandya (Platystoma sp.). The bifurcation of a river is usually com pared to a crotch and is thus a spot of procreation-transformation. II. umupiru, from umll, 'oropendola' (lcteridae), and piru, a generic word for 'snake.' The oropendola is a shamanic bird . 12. siviririri, 'to come out of a place' (a house, a cave). kamotari, 'to stop something;' from kamuri, 'to dominate, to subject,' and tari, 'to cut off, to impede.'
12. pataduriasakanyora, from patari, 'to cut,' turi, 'sections,' saari (nasal.), 'to embark.' 16. maha, 'macaw.'
vaipe, 'catfish,' a generiC term. sU/ubi or surubim; this is LG for another species of catfish; the proper Desana name for this fish is kaviria.

boreka (Leporinus copelandi). uhu (Doras dorsalis).

20. karisiari (nasaL), 'to eviscerate, to gut;' related to gariri, 'to toast'(?) 22. yibeokayora, from yiri, 'to make,' beori, 'to improvise, to throw something together. ' 24. siyuri, 'to smoke;' from siruri, 'to dry;' related to searl, 'to sift,' siliLri, 'sieves.' On the transformative symbolism of smoking fish or game, see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1978:282-283. 25. The 'day of preparation ' is a standard expression phrased as 'the day of pulling out manioc tubers;' duarinere, from duari, 'to pull out,' and ni::"re: 'day-on. ' 26. Yavarete, a site on the lower Vaupes river, near the mouth of the Papuri. The name is taken from LG and means 'true jaguar. ' 27. The hill called La Aduana , the 'Custom House ,' is located on the Colombian side of the Vaupes river , just north of the mouth of the Papuri river. In front of it, on the Brazilian side, is the Salesian Mission . The falls and rapids of Yavarete are greatly feared. Deeply incised rock engravings are found on many boulders and are said to commeITIDrate mythological events. It is, however, very doubtful that these or other petroglyphs of the Vaupes territory should be of Tukanoan origin; it seems much more probable that they were made by the Arawakans. The representation of people wearing cone shaped body masks quite definitely points to an Arawakan tradition. 28. The second day of ritual preparations is costumarily dedicated to the preparation of beer. 29. The painted decoration on the stamping tubes divides them into sections that correspond to the ranked sib ancestors who traveled in the mythical Snake Canoe. deaburi, from deari, 'to stomp on the ground,' buri, 'things, objects.' Alternative designations are ohoyilhke, 'sapling-tree' or deari yuhke, 'stomping-tree (wood).' A common name for these stomping tubes is borepu, 'white-leaf,' a name alluding to the raw material from which these staffs are made and which is Cecropia wood; the underside of Cecropia leaves are of a whitish color. 30. peraga (first syllable nasalised); from pera, 'two,' -ga, diminutive. 31. inyamiukanyora: from inyarf, 'to look , consider, conceptualise,' mufri, ro err, to miss, undervalue , underestimate. ' koayeeape·, lit., 'gourd vessel-jaguar-person ' . This is the tribal name of the hosts. The symbolic associations were explained in the follow ing manner. The term koa means bottle gourd or gourd vessel and can refer to a tree (Creseentia eu/ere, Lagenariaj or to a curcurbit. In shamanic language a gourd or gourd vessel symbolises a womb , or

can stand for a certain category of women and for their fecundity potential. The shamanic expression nome koa, 'woman-gourd' was glossed as 'woman-sustenance' and refers to the nutritional status of a woman, and to the particular stage of reproductive development, such as puberty, menstruation, pregnancy, etc. In most cases, koa stands for 'fertile womb,' for a 'container' inside which a trans formation is taking part, very much in the sense of the alchemist's alembic or retort which, be it said here, was designated as a 'cucur bit .' The element yee, as [ have pointed out before, can stand for shaman or for jaguar, and is related to the verb yeeri, 'to copulate.' In the present context , the tribal name koayeea, simply means 'female-copula tors. ' 32. pagc'semarape, 'progenitors, ancestors;' since old kOfrJekateame was married to a Jaguar Woman, the diroa mahsa boys are related to their present hosts ; these, however, pay scant attention to this fact. 33 . vagubirinyora, from vag/Hi (nasal.), 'to be able, to obtain achieve;' biri negation. 34 . saari (nasal.), 'to mi x a liquid.' The women were preparing black body paint from the juice of the Genipa plant.
me'gahkuuri,' from beori (meori), to throw down ,': ahkuuri, from gahki, 'monkey ,' a synonym for penis, and kuuri, 'to introduce , to insert.' The metaphor 'to set loose a monkey,' means 'to cohabit.' 35. deyoamanyora, from deyoari, 'to appear, to become visible, ' piari, 'to come out , present oneself.' From here on this manifestation is referred to several times. Although initially there were only two diroa mahsa youths, now there appear more and more of them , but his happens in an unexplained way. 37 . ornaanyora, froIll omari (nasal.), 'to run , grow , multiply , combine.' The verb is often used to describe the sudden, explosive appear ance and spreading of hallucinatory images. 38 . opaa arike, lit., 'like now,' that is, 'under normal circumstances.' 39. yuhuka, a file ; from yuhu, 'one,' ka, 'file , row, fence.' 40. ii noho puugere, 'in a corner;' from ii noho, 'this-like,' puu, 'corner,' from pUllri, 'to inject, plant, cohabit.' The expression refers to 'doing something in a corner.'
inyagororikanyora; from inyari, 'to look,' gororiri, 'to go mad, become enchanted , have visions.' This again alludes to the diroa mahsa having intercourse with the women.
4 I. moaborebu, 'Trumpeter bird' (Psophia crepitans.)
42. nyamiga, 'at dawn ;' nyami, 'night,' nyamika, 'at nightfall.'

53. kumuriseorata, from kumuriseori; gumuri, 'house beams,' neori, 'to become indigested,' an expression used to refer to a marriage between incompa tib~e partners. Since horizontal house beams are interpreted as divixling Jines (tabLiri) between exogamous groups, the verb kumuriseori was glossed by the informants as 'to distort the organization of other people.' The commentators said that the diroa mahsa were beginning to impress and even 'conquer' their hosts. 54. This expression too has a strong sexual connotation. 55. nehke, 'to each other;' iri nehke, 'these couples, these correspon den ts.' siamakanyora, 'they paired off;' from siari, 'to insert oneself.' In a row of male dancers the women approach from behind and, ducking under their joined arms, take their places between the men , that is, 'they insert themselves.' 56. kurisiri, from kuriri (nasaL), 'to bite;' siriri, 'to tear to pieces, to scatter, to stop (e.g., fish at a weir or a fishing screen),.

The verb is related to goro, 'place of origin, of multi· plication ;' goreri, ' to model' (e.g. traits): goredri, 'to be modeled.' Others said that the youth had become angry because they had overheard the orders given by the girl's parents and felt threatened. 67. ya'apeodeara, from yaari, 'to open the mouth,' peari, 'to bite, to grasp with the teeth.'

This is called the 'song of erection.' 73. They multiplied . .
74. aisiripurumuhuke; from aisiriri, 'to grasp and disperse,' puru, a particle indicating rapid action; muhuke, 'do quickly.' What the parents said was: "Get impregnated quickly." 76. guanyora, from guari, 'to become angry.' 77. veha, 'sleep;' kamubeo, from kamuri, ' to lull to sleep .' pari, 'to beat, hit, make an impact.' The image is that of depriving someone of his power attributes. The earpendants are the testicles and , according to the commentators, they "contain colors: yellow, red, greenish." These are the 'color energies' I have mentioned be· fore. Thunder is an abstract male concept, a possessor of virility; he is esentially a father, or father·in·law, image. 79. siribirinyora, from siriri, 'to die,' biri, negation . The commentators explained that the men could not satisfy and impregnate the women.

I. A man who has had an erotic dream, should not go hunting, fishing, or ga thering. 2. The act of climbing up a tree usually symbolises copulation. How ever, in some contex ts it refers, more specifically , to sexual initiation. Miriti palms are often associated with the women of Arawakan tribes and the commenta tors ex plained that the man was in a sta te of sexual arousal and cohabited with a 'miriti woman.' 3. pea is described here as a Snake Person , identified with the anaconda as 'Mother of Fish'. In the present case , the name was derived from peari, 'to rub,' a synonym for copulation. It was given to understand that pea was an 'owner of women.' Vea's lake is now called Laguna de Santa Lucia , and is located near Jgarape Turi. 4. The commenta tors said tha t the man was not dropping whole leaves, but little figures he cut out or plaited from leaves. such as pubic triangles , cone-shaped vulvae, or phallic birds. By this the man de monstrated his interest in the daughters of Snake Person. 10. At this point , the topic of the potential son.'s-in-law tasks is intro duced. To 'make string' from palm fibers is a metaphor for male sexual activity or, at least , for virility ; yellowish fiber threads are compared to seminal emission. II. The old woman sexually initiates the youth. The act of 'sweeping' is a metaphor for coitus. She 'comes down sweeping,' that is, she moves toward the man who enters the maloca which is 'the womb of the sib,' clearly an invitation to sex. 13. gorasome, 'he won't be able,' is a term that can be used to express doubts about a man's virility, or his strength to 'fell a tree,' When Vea solicits yellow threads, he solicits proof of the young man's virility. 15. The grandmother, like many older women, is resentful because she is being starved, both in terms of food and of sex. Now she decides to take advantage by protecting the stranger. 16. Her order for preparing 'snu ff parallels a sexual experience, because 'sneezing' stands for ejaculation. The term para is highly significant ' in this context because it has at least three alternative meanings: a) a skein of fibers, b) a sprout from a seedling, c) an incipient flame, d) a son, a descendant. The term urisuanugugake, 'sniff them up your nose,' is derived from urisuari, 'to sniff;' sudri means 'to press into, to encase something,' and refers to impregnation (by snuff or



Marriage to a Tapir Woman 277
by semen). The commentators interpreted the entire episode in sex ual terms . 25. The second task, that of firing a field, has a similar interpretation. As has been pointed out before, the expression 'to clear a field' or 'to burn a field' is a metaphor for intercourse, that is, for the prepa ration of an act of insemination. Characteristically, the text does not use the common term poe, for 'field , garden,' but uses dirive, a term that refers quite specifically to a 'new field,' a newly established clearing. The commentators remarked that both, women and fields, were 'traps' to insu re fertility. "One sets a trap when clearing a field," it was said. The man's doubt about being able to 'fire the field ' reflects his doubt about being able to impregnate the woman; but once more the old woman helps him . The two snakes he was made to drag over the field symbolise the yearly variation of the Milky Way which is imagined as two snakes which intertwine and mate at the equinoxes. These are the times when fields are dry and can be fired. This interpretation was given on another occasion, when astronorilical questions were being discussed. mahiari, 'to drag around, to walk in circles, to turn around some thing,' an expression that is commonly used when young men describe their trysts and talk of ' walking around the women', nome mahiriri.
31. The expression ehatuabirinvora means. literally, 'they did not fit, they did not go into.' 35. The expression varo timuma sua vayoro means 'well polished-en cased;' from timtiri, 'to run, to polish, to copulate.' 37 . The commentators explained that vea was now satisfied and wanted to establish a formal exchange relationship with the man's kin. He made the water level rise so he might pass over the turbulent rapids, an attitude said to indicate his "dominion over all Snake Women." 46. efrtayabu is the Desana name of the ltapucu (LG) Falls, on the Macl! parana, a northern affluent of the lower Papuri. At this spot vea entrusted the Desana man with a box, the same kind of oblong 'treasue box' as has been described in other texts.{@f. Text No. 42, 43). In this bo x are contained the 'gifts' vea has to offer, that is, women. These , however. are represented as devouring fe males who, according to the commentators, had vaginae dentatae. The 'objects' or 'tools' contained in the box were described as 'live saws, live blades; all red,' and terrified the Desana who had opened the box to see why it was so heavy.

53. The utensils or, rather, the women, cal! out, while the man takes to nigh t. 54. vea's people follow his tracks, designated here as da, ' thread,' (plural, ddri), a term that also refers to concepts such as 'life line, energy transmission , luminous trace.' 57. To escape from his persecutors the Desana now offers them women of other groups: Deer Women and Armadillo Women. 61. The tearing off of the armadillo's tail was explained by the com mentators as an act of participation, the ' tail' being the clitoris, and it was pointed out that deer also had a tail. The expression meviu kanyora, from meviuri, 'to tear ou t,' refers directly to this concept of participating. Ve·a now desists from his pursuit and the Desana man escapes and retu rns to his home. 66. However, his search for women is not over yet. In this scene, ac companied by a kinsman, he goes to gather latex used for cleansing and depilating the body , but also, symbolising semen. Mineral licks of tapir or deer are highly emotional spots where the killing of game beoomes associated in the hunter's mind , with the abduction and rape of Tapir and Deer Women, that is , the women of the Arawakans. (See Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1980). 67. The next scene, that of women coming down to the river to fetch water, provides another image of strong emotional impact; it is an erotic proposition and the women know that they are being watched. 69. poresu; their scent, their odor was described here as a combination of the estrous smell of game animals, and the strictly 'human' odor of ripe pineapples. 72. This image describes the sex act. 73. The man's 'hairiness' indicates his acceptance or, more than that, his incorporation into the Tapir People . 74. ige siridigupe irare siu, lit. , 'him-dead-they-called;' he had been given up for dead. 75. Here the emphasis is on the fact that the other Desana procreated with his own womenfolk (ira nome bahsira), that is, he committed incest. The dire consequences are described in the following. 77. The term vaya means 'ditch, grove,' and is a synonym for vagina which occurs frequently in shamanic songs.

To the Desana most bifurcated objects such as the fork of a tree , a ritual cigar holder, a shaman's bench, a V-shaped snuffing tube, etc ., are associated with a crotch, the fork of the human body, especially the female body. Diving and swimJning often have sexual conno· tations in Desana symbolism, apart from being connected with initiatory imagery . The entire scene on the lake is one of initiation and the kite is instrumental in it. 101. The symbolism of the huge aquatiC snakes was not elaborated in this conversation. Judging from other contexts and commentaries, and from what [ was given to understand here, they represent a female and essentially dangerous, prinCiple related to the maternal image . 102 . Arrows are phallic symbols among the Desana and, although this was

1. Freshwater dolphins (/nia geoffrensisj were fairly frequent in the Vaupes territory in former times, but have almost disappeared by now. In the present text there is some confusion because at first, Dolphin People are mentioned, and later on (Section 19), Fish People are referred to . Circu mstancesmade it impossible to elicit detailed commentaries on this text. Much of the story is self-explan atory, The origin of this tale seems to lie in the region of the lower Vaupes river, in Brazil, where the narrator had spent some time.

Text No. 30 - Notes and Commentaries
1. abe means both 'sun' or 'moon.' In the present context the moon is meant and some commentators alluded to a female element. sira, from siri (nasal.), to fish with a funnel-shaped net put into an opening in a fishing screen that crosses a stream. The verb is related to siriri, which has two alternative meanings: 'to fence in,' and 'to Ooat on the surface.' 2. sipeyaro, from sir( (nasaL), Cf above, n I, and peyari, 'to be moun ted on top of a platform.' It was explained that one of the fisher men , the younger brother, was sitting on a kind of scaffold made of wooden poles that projected out of the riverbank. In another version of this text the fisherman in question suffered from running sores and drops of secretion fell into the water and attracted a large number of fish. Although this image was not mentioned here, all speakers and listeners had it in mind. When discussing the act of fish ing, it was pointed out that the term peyari could also be interpreted as pe yari, 'two creeks,' and refer to a bifurcation of a stream. The narrator himself added to this: "Two forces are in action: the force of the man and the force of the creek, that is, the force of the fish." At this point all other questions were referred to the further course of the narrative. vaipe, ca tfish, in general. miupu, an unidentified fish. vaisipanl; in the Spanish vernacular this fish is sometimes designated as guabina, a name that is used rather indiscriminately for several quite different species. yuandoaro; an unidentified fish called payara, in the local Spanish vernacular. ehatuabero; I have glossed this expression as 'countless;' it is derived from ehatuari, 'to fit into,' and bero, negation. The idea is: "there was no room for more ." vahsu; this is the common name for a certain rubber tree (Hevea pauciflora var. coriacea) and has strong seminal connotations. The fruit is tripartite and is compared to the male element - the testicles - of a phratry, in this case, the men of the Desana, Pira Tapuya, and Tukano proper. In the present context, vahsu means 'package, container.' It is related to vasari (vahsari), 'to pour a liquid into a container.' The image was explained as fish swimming in very dense schools.



320 Tex t No. 30 - Notes alld COll1l11ental'ies
vabirillyora: this term refers to the manner in which fish move; it is derived from !'ari, 'to come.' birriri, 'to play, to wallow, to tumble,' and the commentators explained that the fisll beilavcd as if they were running to their spawning beds. Thc fish were described as sexually excitcd and it was pointcd out tilat. after all, fish were women and the fishermcn were 011 search for suitablc spouses. 4. Hcre it was added tilat the two men were unmarrieu brothers. 5. sere. from sereri (nasal.), 'to ask for something, to solicit.' It was given to understand tllat the younger brother should not ask for a woman. 6. Moon Person was paudling a canoe and now approached tile fishing screen. From some remarks it appeared that M(}on Person came in animal shape. 8. Since the screen stretched across thc creek. Moon Person's canoe was 'unable to pass. !'aburi, from )lari, 'to go.' buri, 'for,' that is, 'for me to pass.' ve/II?, 'openin g.' 9. nyl/rtiri, 'fresh.' Ilere in the sense of 'freshly smoked. ' The term means also 'appetising' and a pretty girl's cheeks may be compared to smoked game or smoked fish. a high compliment in I)esana amatory talk. The comillentators emphasised the fresh and appetising quality of Moon Person's fish. that is, of his womenfolk. Further dis cussion of the term 11.1'urari revealed that a very similar word. nyoari, was a Pira-Tapuya term for ' to copulate.' The comlllcntators now said that by 'Moon 's wOlllen.' were meant Pira-Tapuya women. elltabo/IO !'ai, lit., 'rock crystal fisll.' small, silvery fishes with marked fertility associations. They arc rather rare and are found only at the bottom of deep pools. 10. The emphasis on odors is characteristic in accounts of the meeting betwecll two exogamic groups. People are said to recognise cach other and their rcspective compatibility, by smell. poresllme. from poresuri. 'rlantant-smell.' I I. I'esare, lit .. 'me-tao-for.'

or women- ; kuriri (nasaL), 'to bite.' The commentators who dis cussed these etymologies explained that this expression meant: "He ate (cohabited with) the fish (women) who were lying in ambush for him , in order to do him harm." In other word s, Moon Person had tricked the younger brother into taking a woman who would harm him. vahti (wahti); this word is widely used to refer to harmless forest spirits of the kobold type , but can also be used as a scornful epithet , in the sense of 'poor devil , fool. ' 16 . Moon Person is referred to here as mahsegape, lie!., ' person-little he.' The supernatural 'owners' or ' masters' of fish are sometimes imagined as being of very small size. From further remarks it ap peared that Moon Person was the fish otter (Pteronura brasiliensis). In fa ct, these otters are somewhat 'moonfaced.' ai tl/uke, from airi, 'to take ,' tuuri, to gather up, to fold up.' The two brothers were gathering up the screen and so Moon Person was able to escape. 17. The sound of vageee was described as fearsome, as of "a door opening." Otters are known to make loud humming noises when dist urbed . 18. amririsibu, 'a short while afterwards;' from am eronga, 'a little bit ,' sibu, particle indicating the passage of time. 20 . muhusuru, little finger ;' from moho to, 'hand,' suru, 'finger.' The commentators said that the little finger of the right hand was meant. kamaharu, 'palm,' from ka, 'fence,' any objects con sisting of several paraliel units ; maharu, ' belonging to.' tarimanyaha; from tariri, ' to tear out, to separate itself, to break off;' manyahari, 'to fall into the water, to submerge.' Thi s expres sion, however, can also have an erotic meaning, as in nom e manya luiri, lit., 'woman-enter -into.' 22. nee, 'never.'
pesibirabe, from pesiri, ' to understand, to think ,' bira, from biri, negation . 24. dihpu vahata; I have glossed this term as 'fault;' it is derived from dihpuru, 'head ,' vaha, 'value' (here , ' moral value'). The expression was translated by the commentators as: " ... because of the little value of your head."
27. diha, from dihari, 'to fall off.'

When discussing the stem -efJ, -uh, a commentator said: "It means that something passes from a natural state to a state that is not natura!." saayuri, 'he caused to be ;' the verb saari, means 'to introduce an essence, to leave something inside, to feed someone.' 70. teayu, from tear/, .'to tear out, to pull down.' 71. bohesayuri, lit., 'splitting them he introduced ... ;' from boheri, 'to split open,' saari, 'to feed someone' (See above, n 68). u//Uyuhpe, lit., 'he burned,' from uhuri, 'to cauterise, to burn, to sear, to smoke , to become raw from an acid.'

' In some contexts, tongue and penis are eqUivalent. bateri, 'eating many;' from bari, 'to eat,' tarin', 'to swallow, to pass.' The expression batari implies the idea of 'gorging oneself.'

'to sound , to make a nOise, to croak' (birds , domestic fowl, monkeys). The term is closely related to vihsiri, a verb which has the following alternative, but interrelated , meanings: 'to distort something, to. act iva te something, to err, to lose onelself, to pollute.' The underlying concept is that sounds (natural sounds or man-made sounds, including music) influence moods and can be consciously used to produce specific moods in other people and thus trigger specific actions and reactions. The concept of 'pollution' refers to sounds which are 'discordances', a concept which is related to the compatibility of marriage partners. 83. tuaoremabua. from teari, 'to tear out , to separate itself.

I have glossed the expression vayoro pare, ratller colloquially, as 'that was that.' It is at this point where the narrator finishes the story of the man who fell apart. What follows are some additional comments elicited by the listeners. 95. The narratOr himself now explained that the story refers to the first establishment of exogamic rules, and to the need for obedience, the "falling apart" of the younger brother being the expression of the dissociating consequences of disobedience. The expression kalila "cliC Jiltpurll was translated by my informants as meaning, literally, 'harpy eagly-dead-head.' It was said to be a place name, that of a rocky hill situated at the headwaters of a river. This was a mat ter-of-fact statement and one might have left it at that. but some

stray comments led to a lengthy discussion of this name and, with it, to a rather complex imagery. In order to unravel the multirefe rential meaning of the exp ression kama vehe dilzpuru, it must be analysed word by word. Some initi al etymological comparisons offered by the commentators were these: On the simplest level of interpretation, the word kama (sometimes pronounced gama), was said to be derived from gaa, 'Harpy eagly,' a bird with well-known solar, seminal, and shamanic associations. But, the commentators sa id , on another level, the word could also be related to ka (or kaa, gaa), meaning a fence, an enclosure. Since lila (or maa) means 'way, trail , path,' ka-rna would come to mean 'fence-trail,' an ex pression which was explained as the six 'trails' or 'lines' encompass ing a hexagonal tabu territory. The concept of 'trails' or 'lines' was said to refer to specific rules , and in this manner the six 'trails' were said to represent a coherent set of marriage rules. In addition to this it was mentioned that the term kama might be related to garna, meaning, 'mutually, reciprocally,' an expression with erotic over tones said to be related to the Uanano word kamaa, 'to love .' The commentators did not see any contradictions or inconsistencies in these etymologies, since all of them could be made to refer to the underlying concept of a tab~i territory and a system of marriage rules. The term vehe, all commentators agreed, is related to veheri, a verb which has the following alternative meanings: 'to fish, to kill, to copulate, to inseminate. ' To this it was added taht vehriri was related to villiri, a verb with the alternative meanings of: 'to absorb , to sniff. to smell, to becom e inseminated or contaminated, to establish illicit relationships with a woman. Tile third element. dihpuru, on the simplest level of translation, means 'head,' but can also mean 'law' or 'a uthority.' Ne xt to this , a phallic connotation was mentioned. Let me summarise then; tile expression kama vehe dilipuru was inter preted by my commentators, on three levels: I) harpy-eagle 's head, 2) boundary-trail-norm, 3) exogamic unit-communication -Iaw.' This cluster of metaphors is so important in Desana ideology that it is expressed in a number of material objects, with the explicit pur pose of constantly reminding people of the rules of exogamy. For example, kama velie dihpunI, here translated literally as 'Dead Eagle's Head,' is the name of a hexagonal fire-fan, of a Cat's Cradle figure, and of a childrens' game scratched in the sand. When making

The Man Who Fell Apart
a fish-net one begins with three parallel strings which then are knott ed together to form three triangles called kama vehe dihpuru, and the individual threads that enclose each triangle are designated as daMri dari, 'tabu-lines.' The corners of these triangles are then tied to a flat wooden cross-piece which forms the baseline for the body of the net, and is called vehe dige, 'to fish-thing male.' The other extreme of the net , called tia/-i-da, 'finishing-thread: again consists of three triangles called kama vehe dillpunt. Another example is this: In a traditional Desana maloca the three most important ritual objects associated with transformation, are the shaman's stick rattle (yeege) , the large box of plaited leaves that contains the feather ornaments, crystals, and other paraphernalia, and the painted clay vessel (gahpi sora) in which the hallucinogenic potion made of Banisleriopsis vines are being prepared. These three objects must be displayed on certain occasions on a framework of three sticks placed between the two main posts on the left side of the maloca. This ritual display is called kama vehe dihpunt and. in this case, the meaning is emphatically that of 'exogamic unit-com Illllnication-Iaw.' the three objects hang frolll a horizontal pole designated as kama vehe peyari gulllll, lit., 'exogamic unit-to raise ridge pole.' It might be added here that the three-pronged lower end of the phallic stick rattle is also called kama velie dihpunl, and symbolises the male components of the three exogamous units. Finally , the same term , kama vehe dihpuru, is used to designate a hexagonal outline crossed by three axes. The shamanic interpre tation is as follows: The three triangles lying above horizontal axis represent .1) A mythical elder brother, one of the first Desana inva ders; 2) his younger brother , and 3) their sister. These three are called mariya mahsiz. 'our people.' The three triangles lying below the hori zontal axis represent the three tribal groups that were already established in the Vaupes territory before the arrival of the Desana: The Arawakans (A). the Uanano (U), and the Maku Indians (M). According to the informants, the Desana established the following formal relationships: elder brother married a Uanano woman, younger brother married an Arawakan woman, and the Desana girl married a Maku and went to join his tabu. In this manner the six triangles began to represent the present-day tripartite grouping of (male and female) Desana, Pira-Tapuya, and Tukano proper, the last two of whom are said to be the descendants of Maku and Ara

wakans respectively. I should add here that this version is not the only one and that there exist many different interpretatIOns. 95. The key phrase is: "They exist because of this system." With this statement the narrator emphasised the fundamental character of the rules laid down in this myth. 96. boari, 'to rot, to make rot;' the idea is that the co nsumption of these fish (women) make the consumer fot away. that is, make him "fall apart." 87. nyedll, 'evil ;' from l1yeri, adj. 'evil,' here interpreted as contaminated, polluted. ' 98. As I have mentioned already, the remnants of the Guiana Shield rise over the nat rain forest landscape and constitute conspicuous landmarks. These rocky hills or buttes are avoided because they are said to be the abodes of the Master of Game Animals who dwells inside them, in the midst of innumerable animals which are his war dens. On the other hand , these hills can be aligned from a central observation point established by shamanic tradition , becoming the pivot of a hexagonal tabLi (See Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1979). It is also a fact that these bu ttes have many overhanging cliffs. deep caves, and many dark crevices, and the narrator's description of large amounts of animal bones leaves no dou tbt that these are prehistoric sites with large midden accumulation of faunistic remains. It is quite possible that this fact gave origin to the idea of spirit abodes and otherworldly gathering places of animal spirits presided over by a Maste r of Ga me. 100. poyarasibu, from poytiri, 'to form, to give origin to, to develop;' sibu, particle indicating the passage of time.

Marriage to a Vulture Woman 345
Text No. 32 - Notes and Commentaries
The present text is very similar to tex t No. 28, as a matter of fact, only the beginning and the end differ substantially while the main body of the tale is the same, with only minor variations. Again, this is the story of a mythical progenitor, a Sun Person, who abducts a woman from an other tribe and then suffers all kinds of insults at the hands of her kins men. On another level, the text describes an initiatory experience.
5. The commentators explained once again that , in the beginning, the invaders were only men, Sun People (emik6ri mahsa) who, individually or in organised raids, abducted women from tribes they found already established in the Vaupes area. 8. The ruse of feigning death in order to attract vulture women appears in Mesoamerican mythology. II. veavea; these are important shamanic birds which appear in a variety of contexts such as myths, spells, and rituals of transformation. In the present text they are described as carrionfeeding vultures, although their women are said to be 'white' (see n34-35). In other texts they are described as grey herons, and occasionally they are identified with swallow-tailed kites . In all cases, it appears that they are instruments of transformation, be it in terms of stages of physical development, or of stages of psychological awareness. 40. The theme of preparing the visit to the inlaws is the same as in Text No. 27, but the latter's food requirements are different. The Vulture People ea t smoked minnows, a kind of very small fish called imika, and maggots. These imika fish have a seminal connot ation because of their tiny size and large numbers, the same as maggots which are sometimes compared to semen or to an embry onic stage of organic growth. ltis no coincidence that the maggots were obtained from the carcass of an anteater, a phallic animal (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971: 101). In other words, the food taken along as a gift for the complementary group, represents a tainted seminal principle. 44. While in Text No . 27 the couple visited a subaquatic dimension, this is not the case here; the man is asked to 'close his eyes,' in order to enter into the domain of his inlaws. In discussing this transition, the similarity to hallucinatory experiences was mentioned. 54 . Most fishing with poison is done during the dry season when fish are concentrated in pools. The most common fish poison of the

80. They are saying this to overcome his suspicion. 94. These words suggest quite clearly the transforillative character of the 'burning' episode. 102. Compare this scene to the burning of Bisz'u (See Text No. 50), 124. In the present text the bird is called emesc viiro, lit.. 'day' or 'sun big house,' and, in a wider sense, 'celestial vault.' 130. It is not quite clear who kills the first snake. lSI. 80th, vultues and large nquatic snakes are interpreted by the Desana as devouring monsters.

I. The name veeri mahso was glossed as 'ec ho-woman.' This expres sion refers to the complementarity of two exogamous groups, their re spective women being the 'echo', the co-response to the men's demand s. The verb veeri has the following meanings: I) 'to draw' (a bow), 'to stretch, to bend something elastic' (a spring trap); 2) 'to exert one 's voice so it will carry for a long distance .' The image is that of bending something resilient that , by suddenly releasing it, will spring back. The meaning is that of vehemently eliciting a prompt response. The term veeri mahso refers here to a woman who left her houshold unit to follow a stranger. , yehkd mahsd. ' tree-people.' According to the commentators these were 'other people' with whom the woman 's people did not enter tain an institutionalized exchange.

felling trees. Now , to fell trees is a common metaphor for detumescence. However, some other commentators said that he was singing while engaged in scraping ou t the starch from a palm tree he had felled. Since the specific scraping tool is an adze, a sago hoe , with a marked phallic connotation, this too alludes to the boraro 's satyrical nature. Finally , a commentator said t hat the boraro 's song was rather a spell, because "a hollow tree is easier to fell. He wanted the trees to become hollow and soft." 39. vaada, 'tracks.' The literal translation is 'to go-thread,' the term 'thread' referring to a scent trail. oyama, 'to stretch out something' (a thread, a person, a dog). Here the tracks were 'stret ched out.'

tween light reflected from a mirror, testicles , twins, and the mirror image of a person. Referring to the text the commentators said : "They had faces like mirrors, but with testicles on each side. One face in front and another in back.' The literal translation of this sentence is: "On opposite sides-testicles-they had .' 76. bayari vii; lit., 'dance-house,' a term used to designate a large and well -built maloca belonging to a prominent group of brothers. 91.

It is understood here that this rodent , as well as the others mentioned in this context , are the women of 'other people.' 96 . The literal translation is: 'drying-they did-in summer.' During the dry season, at low water level, it is easy to catch fish or shrimps in small pools between the boulders. This is a task for women and children who will try to empty the pool by scooping or splashing. It was this the rodent-women were doing when veeri women arrived.

By this, Jaguar People are meant; during her absence a hostile raiding party had murdered her kinfolk.
140. nohpi, nuhpi (Nothocrax ummutum), a large black game bird. The commentators said that these birds too were 'people.'

1. yuhke mahsa, ' tree-people ;' by this term reference is made to the Maku Indians, nomadic hunters of the interfluvial forest s. piara, from piari, "to come out, to emerge;" Tree Person emerged from the forest. 2. sua, from suari, "to enter, to penetrate." 7. maerita, "to the creeks;" from maere, "creek." II. buhi, a tall forest tree; the suffix -ge indicates its tree-like quality. The fruits are the size of an orange, but are not edible . However, peccary feed on them, and "peccary are women." 12. yuhurota, from yuhu, "o ne, one single one;" that is, they were to gether. 13. abo, exclamation. 14. Tree Person had a flute and his Desana companion asked him about it. turirire, from turfri (nasal.), "to make a jumble , to make a riot, to turn over and over." This term has three interrelated meanings: I) a tumultuous but orchestrated music; 2) a fish run, when thou sa nds of fish swarm upriver to their spaw ning beds; 3) sexual arousal, for example, during a dance or under the influence of a drug. 15 . The commentators explained that the musical instrument referred to, was a mehtepa!o flute in which the tone is gauged by y movable vibrating blade (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975: 112). The sounds produced by this instrument , which is played exclusively by young men , is said to be sexually arousing to women. 22 . aha pu, "plantain-leaf;" in this case , a Heliconia bihai L. leaf is meant , which is similar to that of a plantain. Jaguars that hunt in Heliconia thicke ts, or those whose pelt color is similar to that of dry Heliconia leaves, are said to belong to a distinct local race. Some commentators said that a mountain lion was meant, and not a jaguar.

23. nyama yee, 'deer-jaguar;' this variety is said to have the same color as deer , and to prefer this animal as a prey. 25. karisu, ' panpipe;' from the Spanish term carrizo. 29. The local deer (Odocoileus, Mazama) have developed distinct protec
tive colorings (Reichel-Dolmatoff 1976 : 186 n. 35. seme, paca (Coelogenis paca).
38. muhu, an unide ntified nocturnal monkey . 41. ukuame, kinkajou (Potus flavus).
45 . ny ahakanyora, liL , 'they entered' (into the tree) . 50. nyumuhi, starch boiled in water, a common breakfast dish . In LG this is called mingao, while biasoru, 'pepper pot ' comes from bia, 'Chili peppers,' and soro, 'cooking pot.' This preparation consists of a clear fish soup cooked with peppers, to which some salt has been added; in LG it is called quinyapira. 53. This shows that the man was apprehensive; to come upon an open trail while walking in an unknown forest, might lead to unforeseen dangers. 69. siari, 'to lay down , to copulate.' 70. pege y uhke tere, 'hammock-tree-woven.' 71. moabari, 'kitchen utensils;' from moari, 'to prepare,' bari, 'to eat.' In a metaphoric sense, moabari refers to the female sex organ . 72. ehta viiro, 'stone-house big;' this alludes to the common belief that certain rock formation in the forest are the abodes of the Master of Animals , and that they are otherworldly malocas where the spirit fo rm s of all game animals are gathered . Inside these hills or rocks also dwell evil spirits and monsters, the boraro and all kinds of uahti. For further description , see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971 :71 er passim: 1972 passim.
74 . While siari, with the stress on the first syllable, means 'to lay down, to copulate.' (Cf supra, n69) , . the same word, with the stress on the last syllable, menas 'to light, to shed light ,' and our commentators explained in detail these alternative meanings, "They were giving fire to the men , the same fire we still use," they said in discussing the second interpretation , in allusion to sexual arousal. 75. boy6, 'dawn;' at the first light of dawn they could see them, 44. To thiS , one commentators remarked: " They were the first women to provide our ancestors with fire." At this point it was made clear by the narrator and the others that the tale referred to a first contact between Desana and Maku and , on a personal scale, to the sexual initiation of a young man .

79. In this context, food has a sexual connotation. 83. erera aberi, 'three months.'
84. ehta sanyarire, 'stone-protection.' The verb sanyari expresses the idea of enclosing the body, or part of it, in a protective cover. It can signify 'to put on a dress,' or simply to use or wear something on one's body. The commentators explained that by 'stones,' the testicles were meant. Now the commentators made it quite clear that the episode at the house of the Tree Women represented a first meeting between Desana and Maku. 88. bayanyora, 'they danced;' from bayari, 'to dance,' a common metaphor for copulation. 94. emaroge, 'high up,' from emari, 'heights.' 95. gaa, a rather general term for birds of prey, but here referring to the Harpy eagle. 101. At this point begins the sexual initiation by an old woman who appears as a shamanic Mistress of Animals. 103. kerapiriba, footwear; from kerapiri, 'to step on, to press on.' The commentators pointed out that this term has several interpretations: keri, 'to have, to possess, to produce, to procreate;' piri, 'to leave something behind, to deposit in passing, to impregnate,' as in the expression mome piri, 'to leave honey behind,' lit., 'semen-to impregnate with.' The expression 'to step on a woman' signifies intercourse. 104. puu piguru, lit., 'leaf-tail,' or 'feather-tail;' the suffix -ru refers to something tubular and male. The commentators said that the old woman had a shaman's staff, a wand, a stick rattle decorated with feathers - not leaves - she used to summon her charges with. 105. piyudeta, 'to call for something;' from piyuri, 'to call, to cry, to summon;' Llsed for both, people and animals, as in piyubari yee, 'to roar-jaguar. ' 107. vaimera, 'animals;' from vai, a term that refers to all animate life. but more specifically to game animals and fish. The term mera means 'beasts, creatures, old ones, the ancient ones,' and can be used to designate the ancient inhabitants. In the present context, vaimera means 'beasts.' 110. vaibege, lit., 'beast-old one.' 113. nyahpa nihku, 'brilliant-land.' This expression is somewhat mis leading and can be understood only if one knows a large number of related metaphors. The term nihku means 'land, country,' but has here the specific meaning of 'homeland, home' derived from nihiri,

'to be in the process of gestation, to develop, to grow, to be inside the womb.' [n fact, the 'homeland' is the womb. The term nihkil has the following additional meanings: I) a far-off land toward the sunset, 2) an otherwordly region at the end of the Milky Way, 3) paradiese, 4) a state of drug-induced hallucinations. [t was the land where the youth proved his virility, the 'brillant land' of orgasm. On this occasion he acquired the earpendants, a metaphor for testicles. 119. burira, 'those that jump;' from buriri, 'to jump,' that is, the monkeys. 129. Cf supra, section 103.
128. Jliira, 'those that fly,' that is, all birds. 132. gaa biige; Cf supra, section 110; this refers to the supernatural Harpy eagles. 134. The male Harpy eagle arrived after the female. 138. One commentator added: "She shook her feather staff." 143. turaro, 'many, plenty;' the bird gives to understand that , being a carrion feeder, he knows this 'land.' There is a replacement of the Harpy eagle, by a vulture or King vulture. 144. mlrunye, 'current , stream;' mil'll, 'wind.' Here the Milky Way, mirunye boga, is meant, an otherwordly dimension of blissful visions. 145. turo, 'the last' (point), the extreme, the ultimate;' the verb turiri implies physical effort. 149. vehkea ehora, lit. , 'tapirs-bred;' the verb ehori means 'to breed, to feed , to bring up, to take care of.' The commentators did not ex plain the reference to tapir. 153. The term dia (more often, diage) was glossed as "red." A com mentator added: "The brilliance was unbearable." 154. At night , this luminous sensation is described as vari diaro gohse, "well- red -fire." 155. mahka, "settlement, society;" here again it was added that it "shone red. "
158. seari mallirire; from seari, "fork, crotch;" seari also means "to comb someone's hair," and has an erotic connotation. The word mal1i indicates a bar-shaped object, in this case not an earpendant, according to the commentators. In any case , the meaning of the reception is quite explicit. 160. sake, "bag;" in Desana. a Spanish word for scrotum. 161. puri bira; from puri, "to plant, to impregnate, to inject, to play (an instrument), to blow (an instrument);" purire, "to germinate, to grow." The term bira is related to biran', meaning "to play, to horse

play, to (magically) impregnate;" bira poari, "pubic hair," from biru, "cu rly, screw-sha ped," poari, "hair." 165. varo seadora, "well-he combed her;" Cf supra, note 158. 169. dohte aibeo; from dohteri, a verb that has the following meanings: "to peck, to hit, to step on, to drum on;" dohtari means "to tie together;" aibeo, from airira, "to fetch, to carry ;" aibeu, "she fetched, she caught." 171. gamera yillyora, "to like, t6 love , to have intimate relations with." This refers to Desana-Maku relationships.

n. It all began here in the forest. 7. He had traveled upriver with the intention of settling down; yes; this was what he was doing; from the very beginning he had many des cendants; I tell you, they were many. 8. When he arrived here in these parts to propagate our existence , he made enemies of many people. 9. When he arrived somewhere he would say: " Hello, I shall make you my adversary ," and in this way enmities arose ; the way it is happen· ing to us at present; this is how he ca me to settle down. I am telling you. 10. This was how the Gatherer acted, and thus it happened to Blood Person. 11. The one who was Blood Person was Thunder, I am telling you; but he could not avoid the death of the first ancestors. 12. How did they perish') Did the Gourd Jaguars exist at that time') Yes, it were the Gourd Jaguars. 13. They were people. / How and when~ / It was in those times; yes, in those times. 14.

He had come LO the headwaters of this river. 21. They [the Gourd Jaguars] caught another kingroup. and another, and another, and still another. 22 . On his way he thus visited three regions. 23. Here he came upon evil people, upon bushdog [people] 24. Bushdog eats vahsa. 25. There is a region here where that tree grows. 26. On the headwaters of the Cuduyarf; there is that tree. 27. It was there where l3ushdog and his daughter were eating vahsa. 28 . Bushdog let his daughter stay on the ground while he climbed the vahsa tree and tore off fruits. / He tore them off? 29.

He came to take the women by surprise and make Jove to them with ·outh being seen; but he [Bushdogj saw it; [the rogue] thought he would not see him , but he did. 33. Looking down from high up he saw him make love to them. / He made love to them~ / Yes. 34. Having done so he stealthily left without making any noise. / Steal t hily? / Yes. 36.

"Father-in-law;" he called, "[s there still some l'ahsa left?" / He called Bushdog "father-in-law')" / Yes, he talked to him as if he were a Tukano proper ; he was a Tukano and so this was the way he talked to him. 38. "Yes there is, son-in-law," Bushdog said [in Tukanoj. 39. He used a kinship term ; he treated him as a son-in-law. 30. "If there is some left , I too want to eat," he said; There is some on that branch," Bushdog said. 41. Saying this he threw some down ; " On that branch there is something to eat," he said; "I ate from that branch." 42. Having said this he made some forked poles and a loop to climb up the vahsa tree; there was a uasai palm growing at its foot. I say. 43. With the loop he climbed up the vahsti tree.



The Wanderings of Bush Dog 403
44. When he reached the branches and was moving up and eating, Bush dog was just about to climb down. 45. He [the rogue] took hold of a branch of vahsti, about that big, and then slid down on the uasai palm, while undoing the tyings that Bushdog had made [when climbing up]. 46. He harrassed him. 47. Dropping the loop he made the palm tree switch back into an upright position , and thus he tried to get rid of the Desana. 48. The palm snapped back to its former position. 49. Thus he was left helpless alone on top of the vahsti tree; and that was a tall tree [ am talking abou t. 50. There he was , on top of it, I tell you. 51. He did not know how to get down. 52. Up there he thought it over while eating. 53. He ate for quite a while; it must have been in this season. / [n this season 'l/ Yes, because the fruits were ripe. 54. Like now, in this season; this is when the fruits ripen . 55. Those he was eating; it must have been in August, yes. 56.

The teals settled on that tree. / Did they discover him ') / They were on their way to the Hill of the Gourd Mirror , on the head waters of this river. 58. There is a lake with fish; nowadays the employees of the mission aries call that place ' the lake.' 59 . So they settled on that tree ; the teals came to that vahsti tree. / The teals? / Yes. 60. It was a small flock; hardly a flock at all. 61. They asked him : "What happened to you?" and he said: "That rogue got the better of me." They asked him that? / Yes. 62. They (said to him]: "Only now does your cousin arrive;" yes, it was the teal ; he 'was the first to tell him: "Your cousin is com ing; he knows you and when he recognises you, you will know. ". 63. The flock came and went; they stopped for a night and then took off again. / They took off? / Yes. 64. Then many of them arrived. and after three days tile tree was covered with teals. / There were many teals') / They covered the tree; They asked Bushdog: "Cousin, what happened to you," 65. "I was taken in by a rogue," he said; "By a bad person;" yes, this is what he said, and when he told them this they said: "That's the way

it is; this is what happens when one is alone;" the teals were Blood
People. 66. "Come with me," Teal said. / He said this') / Yes; "I am unable to get down, cousin," he answered ; "We will see to that ," Teal said . 67. Having thus conversed they spent the night there; "Tomorrow I shall take you along, cousin ," Teal said. 68. Having said this he gave him of the tobacco and made him eat a dose of coca, and thus they talked as night fell; ." shall help you in this," Teal said. The next day at dawn he provided him with wings and with musical instruments; they made panpipes and made wings for him to fly with. 69. To feather him they covered his arms with beautiful rows of feathers, and they smeared him with the latex of a rubber tree, in order to cover him with beautiful rows of feathers; thus they granted him their feathers and incrusted him with short tubes of panpipes, to fly with. 70. This was how they feathered him, I tell you. 71. Each one of them gave him a feather according to their possibilities ; this done they all gave him the proper down feathers and thus he . became transformed into a teal. 72 . Looking him over Teal said: "YOLI will do all right ;" haVing said this they tried to fly with him, but he was heavy and almost dropped to the ground; at first it was dangerous when he was about to fly; "You are heavy," they told him and saying this they supported him during his flight; he was flying over them and on that day is was getting late and they circled over the vahsa tree ; that was his apprentice ship; circling in his fligllt he was beginning to learn and so he sup ported himself in the air. 73. "Tomorrow we shalI leave," they said; "Everything wili be all right." / They said this? Yes. 74. In the morning they took him and flew off and , circling, he already supported himself in the air; when they saw this they took him along. 75. They went off to the Mirror Lake: eeee. 76. When they came to the Mirror Lake they said to him : "Your grand mother has food for us;" they told him that there would be cassava bread and fish ; megaribame fish. / megaribamc fish') / Yes , a big one, as big as a small crocodile. / What , as big as that ') / Yes. that big. 77. The cassava bread, too, was large. / Was it large') / It was a big cas sava cake made of starch. / A big cassava of starch') /1 t was a big cake.

78. When they all had arrived she offered them the cake; all of them tore the fish apart by the tail, yes; they divided it, they distributed it; it was inexhaustible and always complete; it was boundless and al ways of one piece; I tell you; there was no end to it. 79. When they took the cassava bread the same happened; it sufficed for many and the bread always stayed the same. 80. "We shall give it to you," they said, and he said: "All right ;" taking the food they handed it to him so that he might eat, and he ate until he had finished eating; but after this he lost control and he himself reached out and took [the food]. 8J. But now when he him se lf got hold of the cassava bread a piece was taken out of it. / It did not replace itself'l / No, not anymore; he had damaged it, and also the fish, because he himself had extended his hand and had seized it - crack; and so one could notice that a piece was missing. 82. "You are a mi xe d crowd ," she [grandmother] said; "We are not mixed ," they replied , and saying this they restored the missing parts and, distributing it , they gave him [food]; so everything was all right once more. 83. After this they went to the maloca; the next day they started work by thatching the roof of this maJoca which was the maloca of bird feathers. / That maIoca? / This maloca was made of feathers. 84. That very day they finislled putting on the thatch. / The same day? / This maloca was the feather maloca , the maloca of the old woman; the maloca of the old woman was made of feathers of birds. 85. In one day they put on the that ch; these birds, the herons, put on the thatch [because they] had been hatched by the toucan birds of the wa ters. 86. All of them put on the thatch and they finished about noon; when they saw it was finished they climbed down and went to bathe, and then went up to the maloca and entered it to dance . 87. They danced and drank and rejoiced after having shared their tobacco, and then they went on. 88. He, too , had taken off his feathers and was without feathers , but they did not like this and wanted to return with him and all his fea thers. 89. They had told him: " Don ' t take off your feathers; only we can do that ; you Desana, when are you going to li sten to ad vice')" (Now look at Sabino . for example).

90. When they were saying this they all were without feathers and so was he; his body was bare, he was naked . 91. They were dancing with their panpipes, and in pairs they went out to urinate and went off; several of them had already left this way and had gone to their malocas, and in this manner they all disap peared; many of them went home. 92. When going out to urinate , they left. I3y going out three or four of them, they went away, I tell you. / All of them') / Yes. 94. When dawn came they all had gone and he found himself alone, alone and without feathers , and he was I3lood Person. 95. She came down sweeping the floor and saw him. 96. " Who are you? " she asked; he answered her and became resplendent. 97. She stood naked before his eyes ; nothing covered her ; when he looked at her she appeared to be a pure miriti palm. 98. He desired this apparition and so he took advantage; and that was how Blood Person fell ill. 99. This is what happened to him; she was coming down sweeping the f1oor, and she started a fire and scattered peppers on it to fumigate and wanted to make him sneeze; but he resisted and did not sneeze. 100. So he lived with her in marriage, and in this way he contracted the disease; his testicles became so big that they filled a basked, and so he made one to carry them. 101. (That's why I keep my peace). 102. He became tired of this state, and so he crawled down to the landing place and then crawled upriver on the riverba'nk till he came to an inlet where there was a fishing screen. 103. At that inlet Heron had put up a screen across the entrance, and in that scree.n he caught big fish and striped fish ; poor little ones. 104. They formed a file and approached in a group , I tell you : when they came close , Heron picked them up because when the water level sank they all gathered together; in this manner Heron devoured the fish. 105. The little fish were approaching the screen just when he came down carrying that big basked; he was sitting there when the little fish noticed him bu t, having arrived there, they left again in grou ps. 106. He did not go down in time because on the way he had come upon a little man who was a Fish Person. 107. A little being, like this, he came running down to the landing; he was old and , by nature, very small.

108. "Hello," he said; "How are you0" he asked him ; "What happened to you that you fell ill like that?" 109. "You are ill," he said; "What did you do to fall ill?" he asked him. 110. "They say that the woman of that maloka is like that; this is what happened to me," he answered. III. "I shall cure you," he said; "Heron is devouring all of us; roll up that screen and push it over there, because we want to get out of here." 112. They began to escape / They escaped0 / Yes. 113 . While he was dong this he [Fish Person] said: " I am going to fetch the medicine ," and up he went running. 114. He had been gone only for a short while when he came down again carrying a small funnel of leaves. 115. First he took out the testicles and showed them to him. 116. "Grasp with your hand the size they were when it started ," he said ; "Because they might shrink up completely ." 117. Saying this he squeezed [the medicine] on top, and im mediately it worked: veo veo veo; "That's right; that is their former seize," he said; he was left with what he held grasped in his hand (he was left with a little bit, like mine). 118. "Having done this I shall be going," he said; "He [Heron] is about to come; he comes here about this time," he said. 119 . Up he went running and they [the fish] rushed out, the whole swarm of fish , and went away ; when he [Fish Person] had left, he [the De sana] put back the screen just when Heron arrived. 120. He came down: veo veo veo - his big beak was like a glistening sword ; when Blood Person saw this he became afraid and jumped up and ran away. 121. Blood Person disappeared into a tree trunk. 122. So he [Heron] left again . 123. So he lived in the maloca of the old woman.; 124. That old woman had a little basket; the old woman of his initiation took it and went to sit outside and take [things] out of it. 125. He helped the old woman to take out [things] as ifhe were her son, but he had no penis, and so he helped her to take out the contents of her little basket; while he was doing this he came upon a palm seed inside which was poison; yes poison for blowgun darts to kill animals with . / Poison to kill animals with? / Yes. 126. It was poison for killing animals; at present it is the blowgun poison of the Maku ; it is something they possess.

127. He wan ted to steal it and he was thinking of how to go abou tit , but he did not know; so he took her and ate her ; he was stealing her and by stealing her he devoured her. 128. The next day his [skin , flesh] cracked; the pOison hurt him and he cracked, he sa id; yes. 129. When this hap pened , the palm seed came out of his anus; he took it and kept it. 130. Thus he played his pranks un til she looked for him once more. 13 J. A frog was croaking at the landing place; like this, when he is up to something evil; this is why [the frog] is always at the landing place. 13 2. He always croaked: pao pao pao; she said to him [to the Desana]: "That noise reaJly bothers me ; go light a torch and kill him, and throw him away." 13 3. "All right ," he said ; he prepared a torch and went down to look for the frog and loca ted him ; but it was not him [ a frog], it was a person. 134. Pickin g him up by both ends he lifted him up with his stick rattle and threw him on top of a rock; so he go t rid of him once more. 135. So he was up there , in a bad spo t; this is why we Desanana, the Day People, evoke hatred ; we Desana, I say; this happens on our quest , I say. 136. For a long time he was lying there on top of the rock. 137 . While he was lying there that thing came - you kn ow - that black knotty-headed ant. 138. "/ shall carry yo u down," [the ant] said. / Did she say this'l / Yes. 139. "Yo u won't be able to ," he said; but there were lots of ants and they took hold of him. 140. Getting hold of him as best as they co uld, they brought him down . 141. Now they wanted to devour him ; he was aware that they wanted to kill him by letting him drop, so they could ea t him afterwards . 142. Ju st when he was thinking of this a vulture aifived. / A vulture') / Yes. 14 3. A big vulture, a white one , was descend ing. 144. "Hellow, cousin, " he said; " How are you? "That's what he said. 145. "A rogue left me in the lurch," he answered. 146. " / am your co usin," sa id the vu lture; "I grew up eating the in te stines of your parent s;" the vulture had eaten the intestines of his parent s when they were killed by the Gourd Jaguars. 147. "\ shall carry you ," he said; "Your house is not far away," he sa id.

148. Saying this he picked him up and, taking hold of him, he rose up high and then wanted to drop him. 149. He wanted to devour the survivor; when crossing the great stormy current a vulture of this kind seems to explode. 150. Crossing over that trail [current] he [the vulture] belched: aii, and asked: "How does it smelP" Just delicious, cousin," he answered; "It smells very good. " he said. Had he said that it smelled foul, he would have dropped him. 15J. By shaking him off he wanted to drop the diroa mahse. 152. He crossed over and said: "Here is your place." 153. "Hold on ." he told him and saying tl1is he went down. wooosh; he put him on top of a rubber tree in the clearing of ,his parent's house and thus delivered him back home; "Here is where your parents live," he said ; "They will be there." J 54. While the vulture was still on the tree the man went and cried; eeee; when he cried that way there was a silcence; then another be ing a bushmaster, answered: kobo kobo kobo. J 55. [tell YOll, it was the grandmother of the people who had been de voured by the Gourd Jaguars; creeping into the forest she has been hiding and had turned into a bushmaster. 156. She had been the grandmother of these people , and had become transformed. 157. While they were still clinging [to the tree] a mouse ran out of a hole from a peach palm. 158. "You rogue, you did not descend because you anticipated all this and so you stay up here," he said; [to the vulture] and, fetching a club, he said: "Your head ... 1 ' and threatened him once more. 159. "All right," said the vulture; "You get down alone," and he flew off. 160. After all that had happened he climbed on and looked for the grandmother and found her. / The grandmother again') / She had been left alone when the Gourd Jaguars devoured them. 161. He had been away for one year and now, with the start of the rainy season, he returned; this is what had happened. 162. He returned when the ants were swarming, those that we call "pep per sons." / They were swarming') / Yes. 163. When they were swarming like that he said: '" am going to eat ants; prepare some cassava." / That is what he said? / Yes. 164. Saying this he left. / He left? / The ants were swarming in the clear ing of the grandparents and he watched them as they were swarming.



165. [Then] many Gourd Jaguars arrived and, catching the ants, they ate them. 166. He did not know what to do with them [with the jaguars] and fear fully he changed into an eagle and new off. 167. So he anticipated what we are doing at present; he changed into an eagle and new off to eat the ants that were swarming; he descended and caught them in nigh t, and in descending he ate them. 168. "He belongs to another kind, " thought the Gourd Jaguars ; they had noticed all right ; stepping on a branch they broke it off and when he came flying they threw it [at him]; they came running to have a look; a man was lying there on the ground. "It's diroa malise," they cried and seized him; and so they devoured the last survivor. 169. Returning home they carried him beyond the mouth of yavarete, to where it is called 'Blood Creek;' that's were they took him. 170. There they devoured him , he being the last one. 171. They ate him up, the last survivor, and nothing was left of him. 172 . They cut him to pieces and cooked him well since early [in the morning]. 173. The one who came to eat him was White Skein Fish and his old woman. 174. Old Skein Fish's wife said: "Come and pound;" "All right," [he said] and came out; [the old woman said]: " See my grandson." 175. This was what she said when he came out; he put him into the mortar and pounded; when he was well pounded he put his hand in and got hold of a little piece that turned out to be his little finger. 176. WhiJe he was pounding he caught hold of it and bit it, and kept it in his mouth; he pounded well, not leaving a whole piece, and then he took ou t a portion. 177. All representatives of [tribal] groups participated in the meal, and they did not leave a morsel; not a morsel did they drop. 178. "Don't drop any morsels," they said and formed a tight circle just as we are doing here - and so , in a tight circle they ate him. 179. But the one who had been pounding - when he poured it out had dropped the piece he had in his mouth, just as if one let fall something. 180. When they were eating him (and there were many of them) a sound came from Eagle's Cove. 181. It came from the cove at yavarete.
182. The sound was: tooo; "Listen' Who has let him escape?" they
asked. 183 . "We did not let him escape," they said, but the one who had let him



The Wanderings of Bush Dog 411
escape," they said, but the one who had let him escape, said: 'We don't want to eat just anybody,' and he thought, 'We don't under stand this ; his soul is arriving; this won't end well.' But they finished eating and soon forgot abou t the whole matter, and paid no more attention to it. 184. The landing place of the field of the old woman of Skein Fish was [situated] on Eagle's Cove. 185. One day she had gone to the field, and when she returned from the field she took a bath . . 186. On another occasion the same happened; while she was [bathing] those little dwarf pen cil-fish , you know , came swimming along and watched her while she was washing the manioc [tubers]; 00000 they turned around. 187. Turning round and round the little fish watched her. 188. She thought: "Could it be them ')" [the eagles]; when the fishing season arrived she had them caught; but she could not catch them because they disappeared in the water and went away . 189. She tried for a while but then she became tired and made one of those nets they [women] know how to make. 190. Using that net she caught as many as she could, and then she crossed t he river and went home. 19 J. She arrived home carrying her basket and put it down; she had a bundle of red peppers she had been drying. 192. Now she toasted them on the comal, together with these little fish; she then ground the pepper and pounded the fish and, pouring all this int o a gourd vessel , she mixed it wit h the pepper. 193. She put it in the gourd vessel , closed it well and tied it up , and [sus pended] it in a basket over the hearth; she did not suspect anything. 194. After ten days a sound came from the gourd vessel that was in the pepper ba ske t; the sound was vigi vigi vigi, because he was a starch pepper person. 195. Thu s he revived , with that bothersome noise , and at last he emerged and together they wen t to the landing place. 196. First there had been only one [but now] there appeared two, about that big. 197. They were as big as that when they emerged; [they slept in ham mocks] above her grandmother and whenever they went out they would step on their grandmother's hammock to go down to the landing place; there they made noi se; to 'puu ta 'puu tooo toto to poro poro poro, and after that they went up again embracing each other.

198. Opening the door - ,'oopo l'oopo-he [they] rushed in [and cried]: "Hello, Grandmother Cashew, are you still lying down'!" "] am lying down," she said; "There is a fire; go and warm yourself," she said. 199. The two boys had red bodies and were very handsome. 200. She took care of them, for a long time. 201. She brought them up. 202. Being bored [they said] to their grandmother: "We want to eat ants; are there any"" "Over there are some," she said. 203. Having said this they asked her to come along; she had brought them up without the Gourd Jaguars knowing anything about it. 204.But they did not hide; they were not afraid; they lived without fear. 205. They felt secure, like intelligent people. one might say; quite fear less, one might say. 206. So they went and a s short way off they came to an anthill: poking at it they made a hole for the old woman, and she too opened an other; then tlley collected lants] and ate them; they washed [others] and took a rest. 207. They became tired at eating and said: "Grandmother Cashew. we won't eat any more, we won't eat more ." 208. Having said this, they said: "Grandmother Cashew. we shall go to play , we shall go to play." 209. They were very restless and so they climbed up on poles and jumped down again: they played around and behaved like Inonkeys in order to climb better, and so they turned over and over until they were gone: going off farther ami farther they became lost. 210. On that occasion they came lipan a tree we Desana call nehesuru; it is a tall and clean tree, that's how we see it. 21 I. Coming upon that tree they looked at il aIlli then turned into squirrels; their claws were as sharp as earpendants, and pointed like stone chips , and thus transformed they climbed up that tree and stayed up there quietly . ~ 12. They had climbed up in silence, but when they had come to the top of the tree they began to yell and Grandmother Cashew becal11e frightened; they cried: "You always told us that there were no [other] people around here; but there are plenty of fields." ~13. They had come upon the Gourd Jaguars, and there were many of them ~ 14. " They exterminated your grandparents by eating them." she called up to them. scolding them and telling them. 215. "They finished off your grandparents by eating them and tlley will

eat you , too," she said. "Why should they eat us?" they said ; "Come and have a look." And saying this they got hold of some pod s and shook them ; the noise resounded and, transforming them into agouties, they threw them down : POOo; it fell right among some women who were standing there; "There goes an agou ti ; hit him, kill him' " they screamed; but he escaped. 216. They saw many people but they were not afraid. 217. They knew many things; there was nothing they wO\.lld not have known. 218. Now they began to play; they took some leaves and made them rain down. 219. Opening some pods they let drop some seed s: sa sa sa bara bara bara; they fell into the creek we call nehesu. 220. They turned into megariba fish. 221. While they were doing all this the old woman became impatient and caused many large ants to climb up. 222. Many ants covered the tree in climbing up; she said: "Because of your misbehavior the ants are coming. " 223. "It that so?" they said and took a look ; "Yes, Jon'! tell me ; they are covering everything; we sure are in a fix ," they said and, taking some branches, they swept them away. 224 . Sweeping them off they descended when - ai - [they were bitten] and drapped to the grau nd; they perished. 225. Saying, "I told you so, you fools," the old grandmother let them lie there. 226 . The old woman put some water into a little funnel [of leaves] and said a spell over it ; then she repeated the same spell she had said to make the ants climb up, but in reverse. 227. "How does she address us? " said [one of the boys] and turned toward her; one here and another .there, they came to hear her saying the spell; but only his [their] soul turned to her and heard the spell. 228 . Her counter-spell neutralised the one she had cast upon them; "That stupid one; it was she who cast that spell upon us," they said. 229. Having said her spell she gave them to drink. 230. After a while they sat up, they revived. 231. " it hurts a lot, Grandmother Cashew," they said: "You asked me if it would hurt," she said ; "It would be like snake poison." 232. "She [a snake] would not hurt us," they said; they always contra dicted ; they would not listen.

233. "Let's go back," she said; she Illade a tight bundle of the ants she had collected . 234. "We will get even yet," she said jokingly; [but they answered]: "The ant bites hurt a lot; they hurt a lot." 235. "I cannot even sit down," they said. Wilen they were looking at those funnels they saw , at the foot of a plant, a large spider, and said : "Grandmother Cashew, there is a plant; take the leaves of that plant to wrap up that bundle." 236. "You never pay attention to me," she said getting up :md turning to [the forestl; she touched [the plant] , came upon the spider and was bitten - te 'e pe'me; she dropped to the ground; and so they got even and killed her. 237. She could not cope with them; they always got the better of women. 238. They took the starch halo and the pain halo from the spider, and took them and annointed some thorns with the poison and put them there; this is what diroa mahse did. 239. The poison diroa mal1Se owned had been stolen there, at the head waters of the river. 240. He began to take the measure of that poison, I tell you; he began to take the measure of what was going to happen to our people, I tell you. 241. He said: "That poison is evil," and returned; he cut some vines and got some material for screen traps; he got only one stick and he dragged it along to make an arubu trap, he said. / To make a trap') / Yes . 242 . " How do you weave this')" he asked. / He did ask? / "You don't know ," he said; " Yes, we do ," they said , and having said this they returned . 243. On their way back they spent the night in the house. That evening they did not do anything but the next day they measured and di vided the stick and [began to) weave; one [man) wove the traps from a single stick , 244. On the evening of the following day [they said]: "Let 's set the traps , Grandmother Cashew," and they went to the river. ~45. They set the traps near the riverbank, just above the landing place ; [the next day) they went early to bathe and drank mingao and then they went to gather the fish from the traps. 246. They brought a whole string of megasibIJ fish; "They [the Groud jaguars] will be coming, Grandmother Cashew," they said ..

247. "They will be coming; so you go to visit them [first) and give them part of the food," they said [to her); "Tomorrow we shall weave more traps and shall set them up." 248. "If we catch something. you give it to them right away when you visit them," they said. 249. But she thought: you won't catch any. 250. So they worked and wove more traps, and in the afternoon they set thl:m up; they saill: " We shall let them set up for three days, and after three days you go." 251. They made a good-sized tummtt trap; it was a turumu; 252 . But the old woman did not trust the boys - those boys. 253. According to them, when weaving the tllrumu basket they had made it the size of the universe; this done they put the megasibd fish into that basket [as if) to fill the womb of the universe, inside that basket; this is what they said when they filled it. 254. In the morining of the day they had fixed , they brought [the basket) and delivered it. 255. White people, too, compar~ our world to a little round ball ; that is what it looked like, that tummit basket. 256. On that day they came and said: "Grandmother Cashew, go to your house and tell the owner to fetch a big tray ; put them [the fish] on it and do the same in the next house and the same in the next one; put all on a big tray and the last ones on a small tray; so every thing will be replete." 257. When they were saying this she listened and wondered. j Did she?j [She thought]: 'No, in that little basket goes very little; there won't be sufficient [because) there are many people;" this was what she was thinking. 258. "What are you worrying about, Grandmother Cashew?" they asked her. "j am afraid it is too little," she said. "It will be all right," they said. 259. "Cook [the fish) that is left and eat it and don't go out," she said; she brought a huge vessel and put it right next to them and covered them with it; thus she made sure of the children. 260. She scattered earth around the vessel , to check whether they had left it. 261. This done she put the tunmlli basket into a Maku basket and left. When she was about to arrive at that place she thought: " There will be lots of people and there won ' t be enough for all of them." [She stumbled), her basket turned over and [fish] was all over; there were that many.

262. They filled the whole place; there was no room for [all that] fish . 263. "How clumsy I am," she cried; rapidly she wanted to gather up everything, but now there was no room for the fish; many were left over. 264. While she was thus struggling. they [the two boys] caught up with the old woman. "Hello, Grandmother Cashew, wllat is going on ')" they asked her. [She said]: " You told me to Ilave a look and to eat; I am old; [ fell and spilled [the fish] ." The old woman was afraid of them. 265 . But they helped the old woman to gather everything; at last eve ry thing was packed. 266. When she saw this, the old woman said: "Now you go back;" "All right ," [said] the boys and left. 167. Having said this she went on to where they [the Gourd Jaguars] had their clearing; she arrived there and wl1ile she was talking to the women the boys had transformed themselves into birds and had caugh t up with the old woman, and slipped into the baskets of the women , chirping: siri siri. "How nice' Are they your pets')" asked the women. While they were talking like this they [the boys] went flying on and then sat on the ground and went on. leading the women after them; and then and there they took on human shape and copulated with them. Then they went hack and said: "Grand mother Cashew, let's go." 268. The old woman came out to these women and remembered: 'That's what they asked me to do,' and had a large tray brought out, and put the fish on it; it soon was filled and the same [happened] with another tray and still another. 269. This done they gave cassava to the old woman; it was starchy cassava, manioc flour , and lots of starch. 270. The big MakLI basket became fillecl. "How did you fare, Grandmother Cashew ?" asked the boys who were sitting there in the house: "We did not go out, Grandmother Cashew," theysaid. / They said this ') / Yes. 271. "We are dying," they said; "YOli left us locked in, and we cou Id hardly breatlle," they said. :.72. The grandmother was weaving basket ry trays. 273. He [grandfather] was the chief of Skein Fish [People] and he was about to make a ritual exchange of basketry trays. 274. "Well. Grandmother Cashew ." [the boys sa id] , "We too shall go to bring esparto," and they went off; eac h one brought [only] two

[but] when they had them prepared there was a large bundle. 275. They finished [their work] as if it were mere play, and rapidly went on weaving, while they kept looking at the splendor of the old man's head which was like the designs that can be seen at present on basketry trays. 276. Looking at that, each one wove a pile. 277. While they were finishing the trays they invited [the others, the Gourd Jaguars]; they came and [the boys] presented themselves as diroa mahsa. People liked it; they were the ancestors. One of them [the Gourd Jaguars] said: "( want to lull my little nephew asleep;" that was what one of these stupid jaguars said. He said this because he wanted to devour them; this is what happened. 278. They wanted to lull them asleep in order to bite them and devour them; saying this he picked hii'n up and lay down with him, because it was already late. 279. But now it was the little one who put him asleep, yes, the jaguar ; lulling him to sleep he laid him down and then slipped away and went down to fetch a wooden mortar, he put it next to the old fellow and then lay down apart from him; and just as he had thought it would happen, he could hear how the Gourd Jaguar bit into the mortar; it was of hard wood, very hard. 280. Later on the Gourd Jaguars cleared a field and so wanted to smash the diroa mahsa [under falling trees] but they could not destroy them; and so they began to worry. 281. Later, when the dry season had arrived, they fired the clearing; they put [diroa mahse] in the middle , in order to encircle them and to burn them, but they could not do it. 282. [The field] was on fire; when it was burning they [the boys] trans formed themselves into the essence of Cecropia trees; when they burst, they rose up [in to the air] and so they prevailed. 283. They [the boys] were bathing in the river when the [Gourd Jaguars] came down from the clearing. " Hey, did you fire that clearing yet')" [asked the diroa-mahse] ; they always greeted them with these unpleasant questions. 284. After this they organised an exchange ritual; in a short time they had grown up, while looking for narcotic snuff. 285. Transformed into other bodies they went to the cave of the squirrel river, and below [the confluence] they searched for Snuff Person. 286. After having collected some snuff they went to the place called Snuff Person, just outside yavarete; there they took the snuff.

287. Taking snuff and fasting they went travelling upriver. 288. Outside the mission station of the present yavarete is what is called Snuff Wall; they arrived there under the many effects [of the drug] and they ran up and down until they stayed up. 289. When they had learned everything [by means of the snuff], the day of their grandfather's ritual exchange had come. 290. "I shall go alone," said their grandfather; "I shall go alone and you stay here," he said; "I am always taking care of you among my own people." 291. "Don't come," he said; "Yes, we too want to go , Grandfather Cashew ," they said. 292. Saying this they loaded the canoe with basketry trays and sieves; he had loaded it so well that no room was left for people. 293. "The canoe is sinking," he cried; they ran down to look; "Grand father Cashew, old man, don't you know how to load a canoe?" [they said]. They stacked the trays, putting one on top of another, and there were lots. 294. " Now let's bring our things," they said, and ran up after haVing moored the canoe; when they had gone up the riverbank the old man tried to put the canoe afloat, but it was very heavy and did not stir. 295 . They came running down and said: "Let's go' " They pushed the canoe as if it were nothing and off they went. 296. The youths just beat that old man. 297. They paddled along and came to the mouth of the Papuri river; there they said: "G randfather Cashew, we only have basketry trays to offer; that is not very attractive; let's catch some fish for them ." 298. "Grandfather Cashew, you clear up this place and make a barbecue for smoking fish; and get us some firewood," they said. 299. "We are going to fish, " they said; but the old man did not believe them. 300. They were just boys; they were not grown up yet. 301. Saying "Let's go fishing," they went down to the mou th of Oropen dola creek, in order to kill the Oropendola Snake. 302. He had five fishing rods ; he looked for them; when he had arrived there he threw them [into the water] and it made a sound like sabLi sabu sabLi.
303. Throwing in [the rods] the Oropendola snake surfaced; it was a huge snake; they killed it and when it was dead they cut it into pieces and transformed them into fish, and filled with them a large canoe.

304. There were plenty of fish, and it was late when they returned to where the grandfather was. 305. "Did you make the barbecue, Grandfather Cashew?" they asked; but he had made only a small one; "Oh, Grandfather Cashew, we got [plenty of] fish ," they said. 306. "Grandfather Cashew, you are old; don't work; we shall do this ourselves," they said. 307. And by saying this he [the older brother] established the primacy of diroa mahse; with this they b~anclled off; he said: "Thus it shall be done in the house of ritual exchange;" and this is why it is still done as he then did. 308. "Younger brother, you go and separate the fish," he ordered. 309. "And the three of you, go to cut firewood," he ordered; "The four of you go to make the barbecue," he ordered; "The three of you, go and clean the fish," he ordered; "And the fOllr of you, go to fetch vines; we shall have basket loads of fish," he said; "And the rest of you, get a fire started." he ordered. 310. Don't tell me' vooo bara bara bara bara; everything happened at once; the fish were put [on the barbecue] and the fire was burning, when dusk fell, the [fish] was smoked. 3 I I. The next day they wove the baskets and packed the fish into them; they filled the canoe with them; they made the baskets and rapidly they left . 3 I2 Having loaded the fish they said: "Let's go, let's go." 313. He [grandfather] was paddling upriver. / He was paddling? / " "Grandfather Cashew, don't paddle," they said; "Hold on," he [the older boy] said. and having said this - vaG kanlU - the [old man] fell in the canoe, and so they made fun <?f him and said: "Grand father Cashew, why didn't you hold on?" 314. In this manner they began to tease people. 315. He [continued to] paddle, and once more - vao karUuu - the old man fell; in this way they teased him. 316. His [the older brother's] had all been devoured; now he began to get even with these people; he began to take revenge. 317. They went on and after a while [they arrived] at a longhouse and they went up to it; up there they were offered guan and tinamou to eat. 318. "Grandfather Cashew, give me the head," he said; "All right," he answered and picked it up with some cassava bread and gave it to him; they feigned to eat, and at that arrived many guans calling poroporo poro po po po.

319. "Other people do have nice things in their houses," he said. 320. When they came to another longhou se they went up again , and there they were offered frogs; when they were eating the frogs they began to fill the whole house and many frogs were croakin g. 321. Bu t this was a bad omen for people. 322. When they came to another house they were offered red ants; when they ate the red ants - saaa - it started raining ants all over the hou se. 323. The diroa mahsa could not cope with them . 324. After this they went on and arrived where they were going. 325. When they arrived they said : "We will arrange for everything," and ordered them to prepare beer; in the afternoon they prepared genipa pain t to adorn the dancing ba tons. 326. When they were busy with this, diroa mahse was thinking and he realised that he still lacked [certain things.] 327. He thought of Thunder , and so he rose to ward him and went up to him. 328. At the Peccary Falls he made baskets and transformed them into pec cary. 329. He made them to fulminate [the peccary] and this is why he went to Thunder; and there he arrived. 330. When he arrived there he told him of his intention. 331. When they arrived they talked courteously with Thunder. 332 . "What you are asking for is all right ," he [Thunder] sa id ; "\3ut what have you got to offer in return?" 333. On this earth they had painted the batons they used during dances: they were different; yes; being the same one , he said. 334. Thunder said: "All right ," and offered him a dose of snuff; he absorbed the snuff and left him on the end of the trail, and Thunder fulminated. 335 . Flash' Immediately diroa mahse fulminated. 336. But only his head bu rst ; he was left without a head . 337. After a while the head came back. 338. "It's all right," sa id Thunder to diroa mahse, "This is how you must prove your manhood." 339. " Now it 's you r turn ," he told the younger one and Thunder ful minated; he too burst [his head] but after a while the head came back. 340. "All right," he said; "Yo u have done it ;" and saying thi s he [took out] what he ca rried suspended under his loincloth; that strip was

to thunder with, and not to fulminate; he gave them that bar, and when they returned they tried to fulminate some peccary; they tried to fulminate them. 341. "What is happening to us')" they said and tried to fulminate. 342. Light flashed, but there was silence and nothing happened, [ tell you; the usual thunder clap did not follow. 343. "He lied to us, he cheated us," he said angrily. 344. "All right , we shall go back once more ," they said, and saying this they went. 345. They arrived at Thunder's [house]. 346. He slept ill the day time; they blew tobacco [smoke] over him, so he would continue to sleep, and in this manner they entered unseen to where he was. 347. Taking on another shape they penetrated to where he was sleeping; he was lying there with his mouth open, and on the tongue was su pended the true thunder-bar, the one for fulminating. 348. It was shining as if it was on fire, I tell you. 349. Reaching out with his hand he undid the thunder-bar, and in its stead he left the [fake] bar; now they went back; they were deft at stealing. 350. This is why loud thunder does not have [the power] of Thunder; this is what the ancestors said. I tell you. 351. True thunder thunders only without lightning and ends the same, I tell you. 352. So there was no flash of lightning ;diroa mahse had taken that thing away from him. 353. They took it along, saying: "How is that' " and transformed the peccary; he fulminated them - crash - he shattered them and flood was flowing; "Well done ," he said. 354. "All right, younger brother; we shall avenge our ance stors," he told them. 355. While they were painting the longhouse , thunder was fulminating; there were four of them; two here and two there, and in this way they painted the longhouse. 356. On that day they prepared beer and the next day was the ritual; there was no delay : that day was the ritual exchange of basketry trays . 357. He organised the exchange ritual ; it was diroa mahse himself who made the exchange for the others. 35 8. The diroa mahsa had adorned them selves, to organise everything for the exchange ritual.

359. Carrying their gifts they entered and delivered them to the others. 360. Immediately after the delivery the diroa mahsa began to sing. 361. Th€ so ns [of the others)joined the diroa mahsa. 362. The elder brother of the diroa malisa presented himself while it was still daylight ; the nex t [in age] danced at dusk, the next one danced at midnight. and the last [the youngest] danced at dawn. 363. The older people danced in the day-time, with the grandparents. 364. They danced well; after the dance they wen t out and he adorned himself; nobody could equal diroa mahse because he carried the ful minating bar of Thunder, and so he sparkled. 365. This done, the senior diroa mahsii opened the dance. 366. On that occasion five women wanted to bite diroa malzse; the Gourd Jaguar woman had already done this to him when he had been sing ing; now again , when he had finished singing they said: "We shall bite him." 367. But diroa mahse had noticed this and knew ali about it. 368. If he did not die then, they were going to pour burning pitch over him , they had already prepared, and the Gourd Jaguars had the poles ready. 369. Now when he stepped out to sing once more, he transformed himself before they [the women] could get hold of him ; [they] covered her [Grandmother Cashew] with a huge vessel and said: "She is the one who brought us up" 370. They thought: " If they devour us, they will also devour her;" yes, [for this reason] they his the old woman. 37 J. Before they could get hold of him [he] started to fulminate them from close by, while dancing in their midst. 372. It was very rapid; he shook out the grain over many of these women and left all the women stunned. 373. "Ai," they cried; "How is our grandmother doing?" [the diroa maflsa said) and went to look - oh _. the old woman was dead. 374. "Our grandmothe r is dead," he said. 377. Saying this he brought back her soul by pronouncing a spell. 376. The old woman recovered ; the old woman recovered when all the other women, too, recovered . 378. At once they too, recovered. 379. He said: "They showed no pity with our ancestors," and without pity, he said, they must perish; and saying this he started to sing and he went outside, and from there he fulmin ated them. 380. There all the women died, the same as the old one.

381. The longhouse burned down and all the Gourd Jaguars died, I tell you ; herding together all the Gourd Jaguars, he fulminated all of them; he did this in revenge, because they had eaten his ancestors. 382 . This [tale1refers to the dimension of narcotic snuff, I tell you; yes, that it does, my son. 383. diroa malzse was the one who owned the snuff; it was his, he said so. 384. He had inherited the snuff from Day Person, I tell you. 385. The bar that was his thunder ornament to fulminate with, he passed on to our elder brothers; so this is what happened. 386. That thunder bar [remained] under the protection of the house , and it had an umbilic which that bar passed on to our ancestors. 387. And this is what they told when speaking. / When speaking? / Yes.
Text No. 36 Notes and Commentaries
This text is another example of the cycle of L 'Homme nu. It is important because it states in quite unequivocal terms that the first Desana were intruders into a territory already occupied by other tribes. In fact, the first Desana is designated as "the gatherer," while the others, those wlw had settled the Vaupes territory before him, are described as fishermen and manioc cultivators. After the rhetoric questions of the first few sentences, the text turns descriptive and almost colloquial in tone; it contains an abundance of ethnographic details of interest, and the variolls interpretations offered by the commentators are most revealing.
1. The commentators pointed out that two different dimensions were being referred to; one was that of emek6ri mahse or Sun Person, as an invisible creator, while the other was that of emek6ri mahsii as the first Desana - visible , human but semidivine. This is a word-play . 2. goamuta; the term is derived from goa goame (see Text 4, note 6), "bone," a word which can also mean "backbone, staff, tube, flute ," and often enough acquires a phaJlic meaning in which the vertical , inseminating stick rattle becomes identified with the creator god. The suffix ' -mula conveys the sense of "dominion , indication, foundation .'" To this we must add that goa, when strongly nasaiised,



424 Text No. 36 - Notes and Commentaries
comes to mean "matter." In fact, the term was glossed by some informants as "raw material" and it was said that "man's raw ma terial consists of bones." If combined with the suffLx -mee, as in goamee (or goame), it means "personification" or "manifesta tion of matter." A commentator explained that kinetic was tuliiri, and that static energy, called boga, was "the consequence of that ab stract matter." diroa mahse, lit, "blood-person;" from dii, "blood." Since in Desana theories of conception "live" female blood - in opposition to dead menstrual blood-is believed to be the basis of conception, the term "blood-people" refers to the women the first Desana abducted or obtained in exchange from previously established groups. The principal actors in many origin myths are, therefore, emekori mahsa (Sun People) and diroa masa (Blood People), both of them initially imbued with supernatural qualities. 3. The above is clearly expressed in the following words: diruame . . ari mehtanyumi neogoragere, lit. "Blood Person . existed first in the beginning of time." The term ari mehtanyumi is derived from ariri (nasaL), "to be, to exist," emehtari, "to be first," Ilyumi, "he" (nominative). A related term is ari mehtange, "he who is first," for example, a chief or a high-ranking shaman; the feminine equi Valent would be ari mehtango. These terms are used only when re ferring to spiritual or intellectual achievements. 4. behtari goamc, lit., "laziness-bone person;" the son of goamc. (see above, note 3). Spanish-speaking and missionised Indians will trans late this term as "lazy god, ignorant god." Analysis however, leads to a different interpretation. The word behtari appears to be related to melitari, meaning "to split up, to divide into categories, to branch out, to become a progenitor, to be first in line" (Cf above, note 3). Now from a symbolic, mythological perspective the first Desana was an cmek6ri mahse, a Sun Person, but from a quite realistic, historical point of view he was a simple hunter and gatherer who had pene trated into a strange land. The commentaries say that the term behtan' implies the drive for survival by food, sex, and territorial assertiveness. To this, several shamans added that "lazy" or "ignorant" were misinterpretations; the man was a "wanderer," a "gatherer" and some even said that he was an evil person. He was a human being, son of the semi-devine goame and a diroame woman, and it was he who captured the fish-woman bor('ka. He certainly was 'ignorant' of local customs but, the commentators pointed out, he



425
The Wanderings of Bush Dog
was not a marauder but had the power of abstract thought which "he inherited from diroame and goame." A shaman added to this that the man would have been evil if he had thought only of physical survival, but the fact was that he wanted to be the spiritual founding father of the Desana people, and that this quality gave him a semi divine character (see Text 4, note 6). 5. Again the words are unequivocal: diroame existed already. A com mentary says: "dirome was the incentive by which behtari goami? was to have descendants." 7. buya; this is the common designation for "adornments," referring to ritual ornaments such as feather-headdresses, necklaces, etc. These, however, are very speCialised and ~onfer to the wearer dif ferent powers and privileges, so that the term buya also comes to mean "power, privilege, virtue." Next, bllya also stands for female fecundity, for a woman's fertile womb. The fact that ritual orna ments are kept in a box of plaited canes (komoro) which has uterine associations, is related to these ideas. When the text says that the first Desana began his wanderings yuhu buya mera, lit., "one-adorn ment-with," what is meant by this is that he had a fixed purpose, his goal being to found and lead a people. Some other glosses for buya that were mentioned in conversation, are "ideal, intention, wish, art." 8. variruge, "part" (geographical), section, region, area." The word was said to be related to variru, "crotch" and thus might refer to a "region of other women." turirisaa, "to propagate." The verb is turiri (nasa!.), meaning "to spawn, to ovulate," and the associated image is that of a fish run and spawning fish (vai turiri). vahagerakegaa, lit., "enmities-he .acquired;" from vahagera, and this from vaha, "valor, value, prize," in the sense of "fierceness, compe tition." gahi mallsii, "other person;" nn expression which refers to a man of a complementary exogamic unit. 9. I have glossed the expression mere mehe, lit., "you-apart," as "adver sary, opponent." What is meant is the separation and opposition of two complementary groups, the definition of two units which, al though opposed to each other as potential enemies, establish an exchange relationship. The expression lIIari yiro do/zpa, lit., "we-doing-like," is an aside of the narrator who refers with these words to the covert hostile feelings which exist between exogamic groups.

II. The identification with thunder or thunder-people is not clear. The commentators said that " the people of the gatherer" were kil.led, but did not clearly differentiate between his kin and his eventual diroa allies. koakurige, from koari, "to eliminate, to destroy, to finish off. " 12. koa yeea, lit.. "gourd vessel-jaguars." The commentators explained that these were very fierce Indians of the Isana river, somewhat to the north of the Vaupes territory. A small group of the modern Kuripako, an Arawakan people, is still being called koa yeea, and the informants identified them witll their homonyms of the origin myth. The Arawakan koa yeea are said to be a subgroup of the tapiira. the Tapir People. 14. geikeru. "tooth, fang;" plural , geikeri. 17. From what I was able to learn this Illay well refer to an actual historical event. The Kuripako Indian s are still greatly feared by the Desana and other Tukanoan grou ps. 18. ige kurisibu, lit., "he-walking while. " deyari, "to be left over, to survive." 19. The narrator refers to the Vaupes river. 21. It was commented that the Gourd Jaguars killed four foraging bands of the first Desana. nyeari, "to overtake , to kill." 22. The three regions were said to be: I) upper Vaupes . from the head waters to the Yuruparf Falls; 2) middle Vaupes, from the Yuruparf Falls to the Yavarete Falls, at the mouth of the Papuri riv~r: 3) lower Vaupes, from Yavarete to the confluence of the Vaupes and the Rio Negro. 23. With this meeting begins a new episode in the wanderings of the first Desana . The commentators explained at length that Bushdog was a Desana; in fact. at that time a number of Desana bands were said 10 be roaming on the headwaters and in the interfluvial regions. and Bushdog was one of them. They lived in con stant fear of "other people." but, at the same time. were trying to establish more or less peaceful relationships with them, mainly in order to obtain women. Some small groups of Desana were said to have consisted only of males. while others had only few women, a situation which led to incest. rape, and the violent abduction of women from "other people." Bushdogs (ictic),o/l, now Speothosj are omnivorous canines which hunt in packs and thus present a good model for small bands of Desana foragers. According to my informants bush dogs are es



The Wanderings of Bush Dog 427
peciaJly fond of sweet fruits, such as pineapple or vahsa (Hevea sp.). The name of bush dog, vahso hii, is derived from that of another species of Hevea, called valisu (Hevea pauciflora var. coriacea).
24. The Text says that they eat pahsa and geranyimi vahsa, lit., "Ficus tree-va/mi." I have no botanical identification for this fruit. 26. karaya is the De sa na name of the Cuduyari river , a major northern affluent of the middle courses of the Vaupes. 29. The intruder is designated here by the term vahtipe, lit .. "spirit being," or "spirit-man," vahti being a very general term for all kinds of forest spirits of the kobold type. The commentators said he was "a nobody , a shameless person." 30. garibori, "to pester, to harras, to annoy." 32. erabehaa, from erari, "to come," behari, "to take by surprise ." gametara, from gametarari, "to make love." durikayuhpe, from durin', "to hide. " 33, emarope, "fro m above, from high up." inyamedihuu, "to look downward." yebapiire, "on the ground;" from yeba, "soil , earth, ground ." enamorage; this is a hybrid word coined by the narrator and taken from the Spanish enamorar, "to flirt, to make love." 34. geyegebe, from geveri, " to lie, to deceive." 35. nyama goa, "deer bone." Flutes made from a tubular deer bone have phallic associations, and the music played on them is said to arouse women. purigarii, from puriri, "to blow" (a flute) . The commentators said that the notes of this music "spoke" to the girls. 36. bara is the Desana term for "love magic;" not necessarily a potion, but also an aromatic herb , or an ointment. The vernacular LG term is chundul.
37. The intruder turns out to be a Tukano proper. neme, "father-in-law." Ilahsea, self-name of the Tukano proper; also the name of the toucan bird. In the literature the name is often spelled dahsea. 38. tihke (nasal.), a Tukano proper word meaning "so n-in-law." 39. kuusiri, "to call someone by a kinship term;" from kuru. "kin, kingroup." buhi, "son-in-law," a Desana term of reference which, in specific situations is replaced by tihke" (see above). 40. dehpe, "branch." 42. valisero, "forked pole ," plural, vahseri. vahsLiri.

bero, "bow, are, circle, loop of twisted vine. "
mihi(mihpi), a palm (Euterpe edulis). called uasiti, in LG .
44. gOroUI, from goroturi, "to change place," also "to change clot hes." Bush Dog was going to "change place" by climbing down. 45. kuru, "cluster," especially of palm fruits; in a wider sense, kin group," especially "descent group." (See above, note 39). yuru dihiri, from yuriri, " to suspend oneself;" dihiri, "to descend". diriri, "to ty together;" diriranyere, "what he had tied together." 47. pooma vayoro, "it jumped-straightening up;" from poori (nasal.), "to jump up, to whip, to snap , to straighten up." The term is used, typically, when describing the action of a trap in which a bent stick provides the main force. viragere; from vira. "Desana ;" Ilere the text states quite clearly that Bush Dog is a Desana. 48: Ileooo describes a swishing noise. The tex t says that the palm "snapped back" (Ie dia gorosirige), IiI., "as far river-place of origin. " It is not clear what is meant by this expression. The motif of a palm tree flying through the air occurs in other texts, but seems to be out of place in the present context. However , uasiti palms are essentially "female" in Desana thought , they are women, and it is possible that the symbolism involved in this episode has escaped me. Upon questioning, the informants simply replied that the palm went back to its original position. 49. I have glossed kamo mariro as "helpless," but I must further elu cidate this expression. The term kamo was said to be derived frolll kamori, "to lull , to fondle , to caress, to sustain, to make feel se cu re." The rela ted nou n kaman' (nasa!.) designa tes a process 0 f initiation, of ritual procedures, of spells and admonitions. If we interpret the te xt on the primary leve l of a frightened man finding himself trapped on a high tree. and being unable to descend. then we can say that he is left "helpless;" but if vie conceive of him as finding himself in forced isolation, on a tree bearing " female" fruits , then the meaning changes and the episode begins to take on the character of an initiation. The man's isolation or. shall we say, alien ation, is only a first step toward his transformation, his individuation. Several commentaries mentioned a relationship between kamo (or kamori), and gameri, "to love," kama (nasa!.), in Uanano , "to love," and alluded to the strong affective quality of the expression kamo mariro. A significant comment was: "He now must overcome his love," and this statement was discussed in terms which obviously

The Wanderings of Bush Dog
bring to mind the concept of sublimation. 53. [t would be mistaken to believe that the emphasis on ripeness and eating refers to caloric appetite; it refers to the individual becoming mature. The allusions to prolonged sitting, eating, and "thinking it over," followed by references to "yellow" ripeness (barca, from boreri, "to turn yellow. to ripen") show quite clearly that the man is approaching an important turning point in his existence. The com mentators were far from considering the man 's situation as ridi culous, absurd, or adventurous, but saw in it a decisive experience. 56. dohteri, "to squeeze out, to extract." 57. eoroa (nasaL), plural of eoro, probably a teal (Amazol7etta brasi lie/1Sis), a migratory duck. The bird was described as "similar to a duck" but with a shorter beak; back brownish, facial plumage brown, neck dark with whitish spots. Large flocks appear in May and in late July . The name is probably derived from the verb eori (nasal.) which was glossed as "to fish at night on the surface of the water." erabeharanyora; from erabahari, "to surprise someone, to des upon someone;" behahizri, "to descend upon, to settle upon." diuru koage, lit., "mirror-gourd hill." On the upper Yaupes river, above the Yurupari Falls, lies the Lago de Espejo or "mirror lake." It is this lake the text refers to. The mirror concept is expressed in Desana by the root diu; diuru is "mirror" and the plural is diuri, "mirrors;" but diuri also means "testicles" and the singular form, dhi, means "testicle" or "egg." The basic significance of the root diu is "double. duplication, mirror image , twin." These concepts are related to Desana preocupations with hallucinatory imagery con ceived as mirror images of reality, as welJ as with Desana intellectual and linguistic manipulation of analogy (see alsi, Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1971, Index, under veari mahsa; 1975, see under Doubles. Mirror image.) The so-called mirror lake is a place of transformation, a place where two complementary halves are joined together and transform themselves into an endless chain. It may be added here that, to the Desana, all lakes or lagoons, in fact, any water surface , is a place of transformation. The text mentions a "mirror gourd hill" called koage, and we must remember that koa, a gourd vessel, represents a womb. The gourd hill, it was explained by the commentators, symbolises the female element with which the stranded man was now to be confronted . 58. The expression kao dihtaru means, literally , "expanded lake," and refers to a relatively shallow broadening of the river which, in this



430 Text No. 36 - Notes and Commentaries
region , acquires major proportions. The commentators added: " This is another world and not all of it is water. It is a landscape that vibrates (nariri); it is a vision ." All this, of course, recalls shamanic theories of hexagonal areas on the headwaters (or the mouth) of a river, where shamanic initiations and transformations take place (see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1981). Several informants pointed out that there was a relationship between kao, the broadening of the river , and kai, the term for "mind. " In an anthropomorphised image of a river , this region would be the " head ," while the mouth of the river would be the genital region, the deltic region of procreation and birth. The headwater region is one of re-creation , following the psychological death of the person. 60. amiri, "small." kuruta, a group of units belonging to the same category: a flock of birds, a band of monkeys, a descent group, a cluster of similarly shaped clouds, etc . ehatuari; something that just fits, that is just right, just sufficient. 61. duhpige, "why?" koakumi, from koari, "to do harm ."
62. The teals present themselves as pagomage, lit. , "mother-son," that is to say, as cross-cousins. veremehtari, "to be the first in saying something." 63. yuhu nyamita, "one single night." 64 . ere'ne pere, "three days after." eheteribeha, from ehiiteriri, "to filJ something" (a dish, a basket, a box); behahari, "to descend upon." 65. The commentators elaborated on the evils of being alone, and the need for reciproca'l reJationships with kin and allies. 66. y e mera, "J-with ."

merehaa, from merehari, "to stay."
gahi nere, lit., " other-day," that is, "the following day." 68. vihuu, from vihuri, "to enchant with tobacco smoke." beabari, "to measure out food, to assign a certain portion." The expression ye mere arii ohogorike means literally: " l-you-shall accom pany-to end point." The term ohogoro means "seed-place," that is to say , "place ot insemination, the womb. " A commentator said: "What



The Wanderings of Bush Dog 431
he meant was: '1 shall accompany you till you are grown up, indicating thus quite clearly the initiatory character of the scene. keedehpeeri means "wings;" etymologically, however, the meaning is complex. The element kee means "central vein, " for example, of a long leaf, or the quill of a large feather. The element dehpe (or dohpo) menas "body," The image was explained as representing a "branch," in the sense of a " branch of a family," a descent group, the "central vein" being the common ancestor. By "giving him wings" the teals accept him into their flock, into their kin. The teals, the comment ators now explained, are Desana and they now recognise the man as on of their's "by his odor." Here is another image which is superimposed: "flying" is veri and symbolises copulation. The verb veari has the alternative meanings of "to scrape, to rub, to copulate," and it is made clear that we are dealing here with an alement of sexual initiation. The expression puribirari is derived from puriri, "to blow" (a flute) and birari, "to play" (a game), "to enjoy oneself." The attribution of musical instruments symbolises the adquisition of powers which in f1uence people through music, especially the power to arouse women sexually by long-drawn whistling tunes. 69. poari sisamoraba, "to feather him;" from poari, "feathers," sisuari, "to encrust." yihka, "arm."
vari da, a "beautiful line." geranyimige, a Ficus tree (see also note 24). goo, "latex, sticky liquid."
vapeome, from vapeori, "to smear on."
vihtu, "down," very fine fluffy feathers, generally of a white color. These down feathers have a seminal connotation, and Harpy eagle down is used as a ritual adornment, to express male fertility. tumeyuunyora, from tuuri, "to soak, to annoint." The expression ira ahpari poaripee igiire means literally, "their-assign feathers-to him," or "by granting him their feathers." tarusu dihparu sisanyora, lit., "panpipe-tubes-encrusted." The inform ants explained that all long wing feathers were stuck into short tubular canes that were encrusted into the man's arms. 71. mahsa nehke onyora, lit., "people-all-gave."

As long as the Desana accepted what was given to him , a balance was preserved , but as soon as he disobeyed the rules and simply took hold of what he desired, the exchange sequence was broken and "'did not renew itself," that is, there was no reciprocity any more. 82. mea mahsa moreka, lit. , "you-people-mi xed." By this the old woman wanted to S8y: "One of you does not belong; he is an outsider who does not respect the norms of reciprocity." Precisely a woman would complain about this, because marriage is uxorilocal and her people are being defrauded; but the men are somewhat less concerned and continue to provide the Desana with "food." The term moreka is derived from moreri (nasal.), "to mix," and can refer to a biolo gical mixture or to a mixture of liquids. Th e word is probabl Y re lated to moa (nasal.), "sa.lt ," which obviously is an "admixture " and is a symbolic equivalent of semen. In the present circumstances it is an incompatible semen. an "acid" semen. In elaborating this theme it was pointed out that the swirling, foamin g waters of the whirlpools in a river - which always have the connotation of birth giving funnels - are cal led moredibu, a term glossed as "mixture impact;" dibilri means "to conse rve, to contain , to keep condensed ." alludin g to the fertility /fecund ity connotations, and it was said that such a whirlpoo l is "t he manifestation of a mixture ." To this was added that boreka, the Fish Woman the first Desana married, emerged from such a pool, and that her very name (boreka/moreka), is a reminder of the "mixed" origins of the Desana. 83. 1110 'meri, "work."
muhipeori, " to thatch ;" from muhi, "palm thatch," peari, " to put on top. " This new episode continues the initiatory theme in that it introduces now the "house of feathers ," a capacious longhouse especially built for large ritual dances when elaborate feather headdresses are worn. The interje ction mage, "son." is addressed to a member of the audience. 85. yahia, plural of yahi, a large heron ; in the Spanish vernacular it is called garza so/dado. It were these birds that put the thatch on the roof. mihisiuri, from mihi, leave s of the uasai palm ; siuri "to attach."

The informants explained this in the following words: the "guest" had no right to take off hi s feathers. By doing so he "changed his state." From now on they were not going to give him (or his people) any women, because " withou t feathers he can not fly anymore." 89. vereri peri, liL, "words-hear," meaning, "to take advice.

"to sweep;" this is a metaphor for sexual arousal. 96. mirokayuhpe, from miroari, (nasaL), "to shine , to be resplendent," that is, to become aroused. 97. This is a literal rendering but, alas, the co rrect translation is less poetic. By needuu, not the palm -nee- is meant, but the "palm thing," that is to say, its "pure" fruit. The comm entators explained that a scaly, dark-red miriti fruit is ugly and has a putrid (boari) color, but that, when peeled and thus made "p ure ," it had an appet ising yellow color. The naked woman did not look like a " pure palm tree," but like a peeled palm fruit, which is a somewhat dif feren t picture.

torches are called turi; frolll multpuri, "to roast ," 1/1eltperi. "fragil." poari, "to break, to tear into bits." All these terms were said to refer to the phallic symbolism of a torch. 133. The commentators explained that the "frog" was a woman. J 34. The man cohabits with the woman : sisanuge, from sisiu oeri, "to grasp by the arm.

" 135. The following commentaries were made : " Frog was in a bad spot. What is being spoken of here is adultery. The croaking of the frog is the call of exogamy, of the shaman. The man descends with the torch and seizes her and lifts her up ; he punishes her sex. The voice of the shaman is hated by those who act outside the laws of exogamy. Shamans never agree to sex." tu 'buyoro, from tuburi, "to hate ." kllrigariseake, from kuriri, "to wander, to walk,'" garisiari, "to turn around , to go in a circle;" here in an abstra ct sense of "wandering on the Road of Life." 136.

There also is a symbolic relationship between carrion , burial grounds, and the female womb. A comment runs like this: "Vultures are gorori mahsa pora ("places-people-sons"). The father of a mestizo is a passer-by , a man who came by chance. In the same way a vulture is a passer-by, an evil-doer." Desana vulture symbolism is very compJex, and the above statemen t is cryt pic. J43. A King vulture is meant here. me'behari, "to land , to roost."

The image is th at of the bird flying up and then entering a region of strong currents; when passing through these currents. a loud nuise is produced, after which the bird begins to glide with lIlotionless wings. When asked to explain this image in other word s, the following commentary was offered: "A person who plays a flute knows how to produce a pure note ; th at is called bihsiri. But when it is out of tune, it is pihsiri. "The imagery remains obscure , in spite of the vocabulary which was offered by other cummentators: oreporege, frolll orepareri, oreri, " to detach onesel f, to break away ." pOrl!ri, "to burst, to scatter seeds.

The commentators gave the follow ing explanation: If a man takes a woman who does not correspond to his group, it is "like a theft," because he deprives his group of a valuable alliance with his spouse's kin. The " theft of poison " symbolises a woman from another region with whose people the uesana do not stand in an exogamous relationship. Such a woman is "poison.

delikD, "center, middle." When discussing this sce ne of hurning the youth in the center of the clearing, the commentators made the following remarks: fields or clearings- because of their fertility associations - symbolise women or wombs. The term dehk(), pro nounced witl1 a short 0 means "center," but pronounced with a long o means "water. liquid." It was said that they wanted to kill him "in the liquid center, in the womb."

This train of thought was elaborated in the following manner: the old man tried to hinder the you ths in their plans. First he loaded the canoe in such a way that no room was left for them ; then he tried to leave without them. The old man continously made sisuizri, "knots," that is, obstacles.

I . The commentators stated that the events described in this text took place in Tipiaka (now ren amed 'Fatima ,' by the missionaries), traLlitionally a Uanano settlement. However, it is not quite clear which mythological personage introduced maniac; some say it was IJorCka mago, the Daughter of Aracll Fi sh, who is the ancestor of the first-ranking Desana sib known by the name of boreka. She is suppose d to have been of Pira-Tapu ya origin , and to have brought bnreka deliki!, a particular whitish kind of manioc . l3ut others say it was boo mah se, the central figur e of the present text, who intro duced maniac. He appeared at Tipiaka, near the rapids called boo tamu , in the shape of a bird, and seduced a Desana girl who bore him a son. [n exchange, a L)esa na man married the Uanano woman

Starch Person introduces Horticulture
called nyahpi mag6, "Daughter of Sweet Patato. " From several myth fragments and other textual sources it seems that the Desana learned certain horitucltural techniques from the Arawakan tribes of the middle Vaupes river, and that the present-day Uanano, of the Tipiaka region, are Arawakans who became Tukanoised. The name boo lIlahse was translated by our informants as "Starch Person;" starch, however, is vera, while boo is related to boom, which is "tapioca. " In any case, both starch and tapioca are symbolically equated with fertility (especially with female fecundity), and the relationship with Starch Person describes the first contacts the Desana established with the Uanano. 4. doh toga, "bundle," frolll dohtoari, "to tie a bundle." 7. poeka, anything that is planted in a field; from poe, meaning "root crops." But this is a shamanic term; in everyday language one would say poe olLteri, "field fruits." 8. yeba biru, lit., "earth-perforator;" the commentators explained that certain wild roots were meant that were screw-shaped or spiral shaped. 9. yee bimre, "to cohabit-perforator;" Cr. supra, note 8. J4. marapokiige, from marapokilri, lit., "spouse-to take." dilut, from dihuri, "to introduce, to descend from above, to make something penetrate." A whole level of sexual inuendos is involved here. 20. Here the name is boobari mahse, "starch-eater-person ." 26. vehek()ri, certain basketry trays which symbolise women. See Text No. 36, passim. 27 . buke'ro, "heap, hill;" from buro, "hill." 30. The sudden appearance of starch was explained as copUlation. 34. At this point a marriage alliance 11ad been formed. 35. nyumuku, a certain sou p made of starch. 38. Fields symbolise women and "to prepare a field" is to impregnate a woman. 39. The "falling down of leaves" was explained as representing polli nation. 40. The symbolism of women urinating in the fields is often alluded to in conversion, but was not fully explained in this context. It might refer to menstruation, that is to say, to an act of non-fertility.



460 Text No. 37 - Notes and Commcntarics
45. The "eating of other food" while preparing a field refers to sexual restrictions during pregnancy. 4 7. The commentators said that "the manioc tubers went into hiding under the skin." 50. ehta yeere, "stone-to cohabit," a transparent rock crystal. These crystals are shamanistic tools with phallic and seminal connotations; see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1971; 1975, flassilll. 1978: 1979. 5 I. boo yee, " starch-cohabit;" this is also a name for clitoris. The "hiding of the phallus" is a recurrent motif in the myth cycle re ferring to the "Theft of Yurupari ." 52. billiri, "sieve , sifter :" from bihiri po, " sifting dish or plate." In sever al other contexts the image of a sieve is used to describe the womb; see Reichel-Dolmatoff 1976 : I 73 . 53. The cOlllmentators added to this : " He asked her to keep the crystal in her sieve, not in her vagina. The sieve is the womb." [n other words, she was expected to conceive a child. 56. variru, "vagina, abdomen ;" variruge, " into the vagina ." from pariri, "to open. to split open." 59. peyaru, a sliglltly fermented beer or c/7icha, made from any of a number of fruits such as maize. palm fruits, manioc . pineapple, etc. 61. imu, from imuri, "to show, to teach."
62. goreverebirido; from goro I'ereri, "place-to break lose from,"
biri, negative particle; the meaning is "to become dislocated, to behave foolishly." The commentators explained that. if the women had not behaved in that irresponsible way, it would be sufficient at present to trace the boundaries of a field, to have it produce all kinds of fruits. The expression pULl pcaro, used here as ~I spell, is derived from pu , pllll, "leaf," and pcari, "to break" (a twig). "to pluck" (a fruit). "to tear off a fruit-bearing branch." 66. mega are edible ants. Ants and tlleir particular od or Ilave an aplno disiac significance , but this part of the text was not commenteu upon . 67. soori, "to extract:" in order to collect ants. a thin reed or vine is introduced into a hole in an ant hill. 70. This part of the tex t is highly condensed amI, therefore. confusing. The motif of the "tlleft of the stone" corresponds to that of the acquisition of the ear-pendants. that is , it refers to sexual potency and legitimate activity .
m()vea, fromll1oveari. "to take away."
71. gamekeari, "lllU tually-to strike ;" from keari, "to hit, to pu nch."



Tinamou and Oppossum 461
This can also be a game in which two men stand closely side by side, and try to knock each other down by pushing with their shoul ders. In the present context , a more general meaning of fights and conflicts is given to this expression. 75. porero, "cricket ;" in other myths, the insect is a praying mantis. On the complex symbolic associations , see Reichel-Dolmatoff
1971:168, J70 ; 176:168, note n. 77. The symbolism of the canoe scene was not discussed. amugere, from amuri, "to carve, to shape." 8:2. toa, a fruit that has a strong seminal connotation; in LG it is called vivapichuna. All other fruits mentioned here have the same con

These drums symbolise the womb and the "voice" of the sib; the drumstick (too tore padige) was called the " penis of the Sun," and the act of drumming had , in most cases, an erotic meaning. 44. Oppossum tried to imitate Tinamou 's message. 46. He was "drumming" on the water, making .a hollow sound by stirr ing the water wifh both arms. 48. The drum was suspended horizontally from ropes held up by a frame of four thick stakes and placed outside the ll1aloca, near the front door. 75. This part is garbled and condensed . The entire episode of the Harpy Eagles seems to belong to another story. The commentators dis cussed at length the Harpy Eagle People whom they identified with the modern Karihona, that is, a residual group of the Hianacoto,of Koch-Grunberg's report (Koch-Gri"lnberg 1908). In fact, the name hianakoto means "Harpy Eagle People," in the Carib language of these Indians. 77. By "Blood People," the mythical wombmates (diroa mahsiJ) are meant. 81. The commentators explained that coca-chewing was not a Desana custom, but was introduced by. the Harpy Eagle People. 92 . The Blood People had large conical nets with which to catch the Harpy Eagle People . 94. Some flutes were hanging from a rafter and , being animated, emitted the typical shrill call of the Harpy Eagle. . 105. The narrator apparently forgot to mention an episode in which a harpy feather is used as a sign of identification.

6. Titi Monkey was the younger brother of Oppossum Eye.
8. kUI'i/i c;ro, lit. , "Casi Imiro )-belonging to." Casimiro and Marce lino were the Spanish names of two neighbors.

to a Tukano proper sib called nyamiri mahsa, or 'night people.' From this union a child was born, a little snake. The snake-child climbed up a rubber tree, but his tail remained in his mother's womb. Up in the tree the child cried: meo-meo-meo (mama, mama , mama), to which his mother answered soothingly: a-a-a (nasal.) However, she soon became tired of the child's insistent crying; she made a small funnel from a twisted leaf and, pulling out of her womb the snake tail of her child, she put the tail into the funnel, together with a small frog she had created and the name of which is vehe, because it croaks: ve-ve-ve. The story was not discussed in detail. and was quoted only in order to explain the name of the Pira-Tapuya chief, 13 . The commentators said that Casimiro's people had allied themselves with vehe taru, the Pira-Tapuya. 16 . inyanye; I have glossed this as " does not enter here," or "does not count here;" from iny ari, "to know , to recognise" (as an ally). kereroage; from kere (nasaL), a large tree that carries small pods con taining two or more seeds enveloped in a yellow-greenish , sweet tasting powder (Hymenaea Courbaril, the algarobo?). The particle -raa means " pertaining to" and the suffix -ge indicates a tree. The name buyarame was said to be derived from buyara, a certain kind of worker ants ; the suffix -me· indicates a male personification . 19. d ehkosiru; this is the name of Desana give to the Uanano Indians, a Tukanoan-speaking Arawak tribe of the middle course of the Vaupes river. The name is said to be derived from dehko, "water" and the verb siruri. "to slip, to glide, to float." The standard reply to all questions concerning the meaning of this name, was: "The Desana, when propagating themselves, went upstream; the Uanano went downstream, with the rain. " The etymology then remains unknown. 21. inyamahikurii, " they exchanged visits;" from inyari. " to look," mahiri. "to return , to come back," kuriri, "to walk about , to walk here and there." 22. nihikoera, "servants;" see note 10. viiroage; this term is derived from viiroa, the name of a small grey heron, and this again from vii, a conical shape and proa, an ad jective meaning "indigenous, autochthonous." What is meant here is an archaic group of very primitive fishermen known as "Little Herons. " 27. nyahsa, Tukano proper. 28. Taracua (or Taraqua) , a settlement on the Rio Negro.

When they had arrived at the House of Nights he [the owner] of the House of Nights received them , and after he [Day "person] had spoken to him he said: "That is so ," because he had heard him say that it was impossible for him; and so he said: "That is so; I can provide you because I live between night and day ; therefore I have food, and in this way I live , elder brother ; and since you came here with this intention [ shall provide you , elder brother [because] I have [plenty]. / He said this, elder brother. 3.

So he stayed; having prepared beer, he [Night Person] performed the speJls of the house . and having done so he adorned himself with the resplendent adornments of song, and having given them tobacco he brought down the box and said: "Elder brother, you come in search of the box of nights; I shall give it to you [but1 watch what I am doing; if you watch me well I shall give it to you because this has to be done like that and you must act likewise; when you return to the hou se of your womenfolk you must do the same;" and having said this, he gave it to him. 5.

Night Women
Text No. 42 - Notes and Commentaries
I. The opening scene shows us Day Person, the first Desana, and his men, all recently arrived. Three brothers procede upriver toward the West, in search of Night, while the others remain behind. [t soon becomes clear that the "search for Night" is a search for women; the three brothers go to establish contact with another tribe. dia vii poekare; lit., "river-house-within;" this expression refers to the mythological House of the Waters, the primeval womb, the sub aquatic maloca of human origins. The text continues saying that eme diita arirore, "day-only-existed;" since eme also stands for "man ," this means that there were no female marriage partners. The Desana had arrived with their sisters, but there was no "night ," no complementary element for day. The commentators went on to explain that the river is the Vaupes and that upriver, towards the headwaters in the West , the men saw that night was falling. In that triribu, " section, region," (from tari, to cut, to separate), they see that night falls , an event described by the term me'dului-negarore (from me'duMri, "to stop suddenly"). that is, day suddenly ends. In this text night is referred to in the plural, as nyamiri (singular, nyami), an allusion to women. Day Person decides to "borrow" (vayuri) night, a term which has been translated here as "to obtain." 2. bohkatiriri, "to meet;" this refers to the ritual greeting offered by Night Person . Night Person agrees to an exchange by saying that he Jives "between day and night ," that is to say, in a situation of alter nating elements. The text says: aririkea yee nyam; aritapii eme aritapii, "living I-night-is in between-day-is in between;" the term aritapii is derived from ariri (nasaL), "to be," and ta'apiri, "to inter calate," and this from tari, " to cut," and piri, " to leave, to let stand." Night Person also claims to have foou: yee amabarike yii araa yee, "I-looking for food have-thus-being I;" from anuiri, "to look for something," bari, "food, to eat." As in other contexts, food stands for women. 3. Night Person now explains how his gift must be treated. This cor responds to a practical introduction to the ritual exchange of women. First , he explains that it should be done ir; koa vahtope, lit. "the· gourds-in the midst of," an expression that can be translated as " over some drinks," or "surrounded by women." The commentators added t hat the Desana did not know the ritual contex t of exchange and had to learn it from other tribal groups, probably from the Arawakans.

4. Next,wearing his ritual adornments and having pronounced his spells and distributed cigars, Night Person brings in a box (kol1loro), one of the large , oblong leaf-plaited bo xes commonly used for the safe keeping of ritual ornaments. The term kOl1lora is derived from oho gomoro, a "seed-bundle," from aho, "seed, embryonic life," and gomoro, meaning "bundle, parcel;" in other words, the box is a " see d-co ntainer," a woman, a fertile womb. The next scene corres pond s to a sexua l initiation of the visitors, as explained by the co mmentato rs. Night Perso n agrees to an aJliance and says: yirore mii, " Iikew ise-a ct·yo u." and then adds: opaa yirilea mee Ilameke'ri mahso. " thus·m us t act·your·spouse owning-womenfolk." 5. Night Person now prese nts his women, referring to them as ige ya vii dire, "that·of·house·blood," that is, tile "blood 01' his Illaloca," o f his womb, an exp ress ion alluding to the "blood line ," the maternal line which comb in es its "blood" with the semen of the paternal line . 6. The co nn otations of this scene are obvious. He steps forward (v i hanegaa, from vill{iri, "to step frolll the periphery toward the ce n ter), armed with his phallis impl eme nts . The verb patari "to fla y, " implies rhytllill ic strokes, and the staff (valLSu) refers to the phallic rubber tree (Hevea sp.). The repea ted chanting of siri siri siri is said to imitate cricke ts. The expression kcra tuuveamuhuu means, literal ly, "obsessed·take away imped im ent s," if derived from tLlLlFeari, "to clear away, to un do," but if derived from tu 'u ri, it means "to impregnate ." It we re the co mment ators who pointed out this ety mology. Th e exp ression dihpa tabu, " in-enc losure." refers to a ter rit ory or to a se t of loca l. norm s ill which th e woman is contained. 7. In this sec tion Night Person gives hi s fin al instructions concerning th e proper way for perfolllring th e ritual which, from now on, Da y Person mu st perform when he returns to his people. He specifies that Da y Person mu s gather his vereri mal/sa, Ilis "conversation peop le," that is, th ose of t he same language group: language group exo gamy is. pe rhaps , th e most charac terist ic trait of Tukanoan society When Night Person says: " At nightfall, when they are gathered .. he uses th e term /l eapii,' this word refers to a minute, but highly significant deta il of ritual beh avi or. The term /l eopi,.i is derived from Ileori (nasal.), " to give comfort, solace," and from al/piri, "to put down, to set down," and refers to th e Desana cus tom of saying a fe w kind, but rather informal words, to one 'e neighbors in the maloca , just before retiring to sleep. One informan t describ ed this custom as "preparing the way into night." The co mm enta tors add ed to thi s

that neoplrt could also be derived from the related words nereri, "to lick, to suckle," and ahpiri, "breasts," that is, they connected it with the act of suckling. They went on to explain that in sleep all people returned to their infancy and were "suckling at the breast of night." The expression bayagahkurika, "singing you shall introduce ...", was analysed thus by the commentators: bayari, "to sing," gahkuri, "to introduce ," from gahki, "monkey/penis," kuri, knot, knob, sweJling," alluding to pregnancy . 8. siiabiriro, "it was not well," lit., "happy-not;" from siiari, "to be happy," biri, negation. dehkavari, "to distribute;" from dellka, lit. , "fruit," or "part of a tree," vari, "to give, to go," meaning here, "to participate in the fruit."

That woman was not liked; she was like me, just like me; she was my cousin, she was my cousin, and when her mother saw what she was like , she said: "Go into the forest and, after having invented the vines and the insects, have him (herO) persecuted by them." 4. So they went into the forest. 5. Going away, as he had been told to do, he changed into a gnat and bit [the vines]. 6. One of the vines moved and twisted . 7. When he saw this happen she said: " This is how high the vine should be," and measured it and tore it off. 8. This done , she told him to look at it in a mirror. 9. He measured and cut the vine at the height she had indicated. 10. "Look at it from there," she said. 11. "When you look, people will appear to you ," she said behind his back. 12. When he looked at her she asked him to copulate with him. 13. He took her by surprise. 14. Having copulated with her he took her along and lived with her. 15. This is how he took possession of her. 16. Having thus found her, he took her along and lived with her. 17. Hardly a week had passed when she said: "I want to go to gather ants," and going upriver she came upon other ant-gatherers. 18. The swallow-tailed kites were making a platform to gather dihputira ants, when site arrived. 19. "We shall make an ant exchange ritual ," they said; "But you are coming with us;" " I shall be there," she said. 20. She was planning to leave her husband - just as women do at present. 21. Women run away; they simply run off. 22. Those of my household do. 23. So when she said this they said: ' All right, and so she went to the

25. That was the way she lived; and again time went by and another swarming season of ants had arrived. 26. He [her husband] went and saw that many swallow-tailed kites were flying low. 27. He threw some pieces of wood at them. 28. When they saw that he was throwing sticks at them they said: " Don't throw sticks at us : we are having an exchange ritual and we are gathering (ants] to take to the exchange of the shaman of the veavea people." 29 . "If you want to come with us, just go ahead ," they said; " Your wife is there , too ; he got her there." 30. When he heard them say this he stopped throwing sticks at them. 31. They ga the red up the an ts and took him along . 32. They took him along and said : "Follow us." 33. "Come with us as our servant," they said; H[ Otherwise] they will recognise you ." 34. When he heard them say this he transformed himself into a very ugly Maku; he turned into a servant. 35; This done they went on and made their exchange. 36. When they entered with the gifts he walked behind them, and when they danced he went behind them. 37. When they had entered they were asked to sit down, and he [the shaman] inquired : "Wo is this?" and they answered: "This is our servant. " 38. They gave him a seat on the last bench. 39 . Going to the last bench he sat down . 40. That night, after the ant exchange, they danced and they danced all nightlong, and the next day they drank all day long. 41. The following day she wanted to prepare cassava , but there was no firewood; when she saw that the firewood was finished she said: "I shall fetch some." 42. "She wants to fetch firewood herself, as if there were no servants around ," they said ; "You go and fetch firewood," [they said to the servant.] 43. They said this to Vine Woman . 44. When he heard this he wen t ou t and talked to her. 45. "You did this to me," he said; "So it's him," she realised ; "Come with me," he said; "I would," she answered. 46.

" That old botfly knows everything; lets wait for him," he said; the next day he [botfly] came and brought many strings [of small fish] . 52. He gave him of the fish he had brought; was it that botfly? "Yes, it was him, the one they call 'una ttached tail.' 53. "Don't tell me, the fish are rotting," he [botfly] said. 54. "All the small fish are rotting," he said. 55 . "It is true what you say," he answered and, turning to his wife , he ordered her to prepare manioc flour. 56. "Prepare manioc flour and cassava bread," he said. 57. "All right ," she said and prepared flour. 58. She prepared cassava bread, everything to take along, while he went out. 59. When he arrived there he ate [fish] and smoked some of it. 60.

That gourd vessel did not break . 62. They destroyed everything and then left; after they had gone the veavea shaman came back. 63. His wife was not there; she had left. 64. "Where did she go to?" he asked; the gourd vessel said: "Your wife left. " 65. "She went with him , she went with the Maku ," 66.

Up there she drank, but the honey was farther and farther down in the tree trunk, deeper and deeper. 74. So she, too, entered into it up to her waist; when they saw this they pushed her into the hole and it sounded kuru kuru kuru kuru , as she weni down. 75.

I. By this, the ethnographer was meant. 3. This sentence is garbled and almost incomprehensible since it refers to personal circumstances of an unexplained nature. However, it was understood by all that what follows happened in the mythological past, and refers to the theme of the search for women and of first contacts with other tribes. Obviously, there is a connection between Vine Woman and Yaje Woman. 7. When gathering yaje (Banisteriopsis sp.) vines in the forest, the leafy vines are pulled down from the trees on which they grow, nnd stems are broken off at different distances, according to altitude. The Desana say that the concentration of hallucinogenic components varies according to the age of the plant, and that stems taken at certain altitudes will produce certain predictible visions. The person who gathers the vines , generally a shaman, will occasionally bite and taste the vine, in order to ascertain its pecular "bitterness." 8. The Desana word for mirror is diuru (plural, diuri) . However , diuri also means "testicles" and the underlying idea is that of duplication , of two identical objects or images. This concept of duplication is



The Faitzjitlluess of Ville WOlllall 505
often referred to in connection with narcotic trances, because the visionary world is said to be a " duplication," a mirror image of our tangible world. 11. The woman is presented here as teaching him to use yaje, but at the same time initiates him sexually. The close relationship, or near identity, of narcotic trance states and sexual experiences is a recurrent theme in Desana thought. 17. Smoked ants are an important food item. In this case, leaf-cutting ants (dihputina) are referred to; forest (nenge) ants are called menga. They symbolise a male principle and are gathered by the Desana who give them to the Pira-Tapuya in exchange for fish, or to the Tukano proper, in exchange for fish or · for bahpGru caterpillars. In other words, a male element is exhanged for a female one, and the peculiar odors of the exchange items is of great importance. Ants that live in clearings or undergrowth (viado) are called bia para, lit., "pepper children," and are not given by the Desana, but can be received by them from the Pi ra-Tapuya or the Tukano proper. They symbo lise a female principle , partly because they are "big-assed." The activity of "collecting ants" has marked erotic connotations and Vine Woman's participation in it alludes to her promiscuity. 20. This and the following two sentences were spoken in anger. 23. veavea; see Reichel-Dolmatoff. 25. Here menga ants are referrred to (See note 17). The commentators remarked: "The smoked queens of met/ga ants taste like ground nuts. I3ecause of their navor one cannot get enough of them. It is like marriage - one wants to have more and more." 27. Swallow-tailed kites represent another tribe. 48. This insect is called Iwmekateame and is a personification of the first Desana. In the present text it was identified as a botny, but it aIso appears as a wasp, in any case as a bothersome and aggressive being. The full story of komekateame is given in Text No. 25. 53. The image of rotting fish usually symbolises incombatible (that is, "inedible") women, or even promiscuous ones. In the present case of "small fish" (imika) the image might refer to "rotten seed , rotten offspring." The "three strings of fish" refer to the three female components of a phratry. 68. Woodpeckers are phallic birds and the Woodpecker People are the men of another, incompatible, group. Similar to the gathering of ants, the gathering of honey has an erotic meaning. The Desana word for honey is mame. a common synonym for semen, and both sub·

Text No. 45 - Notes and Commentaries
I. As has been pointed out in the commentaries on the preceding text, ants are an important food item, and ant gathering is an image with sexual overtones. The red forest ants (menga diara) swarm at the onset of the rainy season, when , after a few sunny days, the first heavy showers are falling. Near the flat anthills the Indians dig one or several holes in the ground , each about fifty centimeters deep and thirty centimeters in diameter. These holes are lined with broad, smooth Heliconia leaves. The ants begin to swarm before dawn and are attracted on their nuptial flight by the torch light. Their wings are burnt off and as they drop into the holes they are collected and toasted. An open grid work of horizontal poles is built over the low anthills, to facilitate the collecting of the ants. 7. The acrid smell of burning resin or pitch is said to cause the fury of certain forest spirits. 9. tanl bege, lit., "toad·old man." 15. The commentators called toad an "insect spirit," (sa 'siro vahti,) but the meaning of this expression is unclear. It is, however, a fact that toads will approach at night when ants are on their . nuptial flight, and that a toad's eye reflection might easily be mistaken for that of a fairly large mammal. 21. The nuptial flight begins about two hours before dawn.
n. By "trap" is meant the leaf·lined cavity.
40. It is unclear who was the "other man." 44. The end of the text is garbled and condensed. The association of toad with pataba fruits remained unexplained.

This text contains a brief, but important, statement on Maku-Desana relationships , as institutionalised in early times. I. goamege (goall1 ej, "Bone Person." for a discussion of this con cept, see Text 4, note 6. 2. It was pointed out that by "food," not only caloric nourishment was referred to, but also the sexual services of women. Once exogamous relationsh ips had been established with other tribes , the Desana were not allowed to formally marry Maku women, but it is understood that they had access to them. It is a fa ct that the Maku , being interOuvial forest dwellers, still roam in the neighborhood of Desana settlements. 3. sillga (nasaL), vines or strips of tree bark; also singabege, "vine-old person." This expression refers to a complex exchange pattern which can be summarized thus : the Maku prOVide the Desana with certain large food baskets called puibu, which are in daily use by all Desana, Pira-Tapuya, and Tukano proper women , and are standard equip ment in the food quest. They are mainly used to transport manioc tuber s. These baskets have a marked uterine connotation: they are fruit-bearing wombs the Makll offer to their neighbors. The baskets are carried on a strap handle, a tumpline that is supported on the forehead of the bearer. This tu mpline is made from certain bark fibers which, when soaked with perspiration, emit an acrid odor

called puikaro. The men of the three tribes mentioned above, say that this is the characteristic odor of Maku women, a smell that is said to be similar to the estrous stench of game animals, and which, to the men , has strong erotic associations. When the text says that " ... since the beginning they used those vines," reference is made to this complex of associations. 4. bullti , "blowgun," the principal hunting weapon of the Maku, often mentioned as a phallic object. dihparure, from dihpani, "totally , entirely;" the meaning is that blowguns are the exclusive property of the Maku. nyeakanyore, "they took possession of;" from nyeari, "to arm oneself, to help oneself to something," as differentiated from airi, "to take, to seize." 5. nima. a general term for "poison ," but often used to refer to curare. The Maku are famous for their knowledge of poisons and use poison ed darts for their blowguns. The sexual connotations are obvious. peari, "to smear on, dip into."
6 . seera, plural of seege. the Cacajao monkey (Cacajao melanocephalus) gahkia, plural of gahki, a generic term for monkeys, and a synonym for penis. 8. momiideara, from momai (nasal.), "to work ." Since mome can also mean "honey," and this is symbolically equivalent to semen, the verb momeri acquires a sexual connotation.
9 . momekorenyora, from momeri (see above, note 8), and koreri, "to help, to watch over, to take care of someone ." It must be remem bered that , at the time when the first Desana Indians arrived in the Vaupes territory, the Maku were the only ones who received them in a friendly manner , and accepted them into their bands. The Desana continue to feel strong bonds with the Maku, but repudiate marriage with them , ever since they became related to the old-established Arawakan tribes.

1. This text remains largely unexplained. From random remarks it seems that it refers to marriage relationships with a certain category of women (do rage fish), and to tensions between a pair of brothers. The commentators said that the boy had infected sores, and pointed out that sore is kami, a word that can also mean "younger brother.'. boage, "infected, putrefied," from bociri, "to rot." 2. emaroge, "above, from a height;" it was said that the boy was sitting or lying on a kind of scaffold or gangboard, over the water. 6. doroge, a large harlequin-marked fish, called Pintado, in the Spanish vernacular. 14.

I shall anticipate a summary of the commentators explanations , in order to make this te xt comprehensible. The story is about two brothers; during the first part of the tale they try to establish contact with a group of Fish People whose chief is a hu ge red-fish. The older brother success fully gains access to Fish Women (his " boy" is his penis, the "serum" is semen) , but the younger brother is jealous and by his behavior antagonises the "owner" of the women, who is a "monster." The second part of the story tells how the two brothers assert their sexual and territorial domi nan ce , and expel the chief of the Fish People, a scene which probably refers to the ex pulsion of the Arawakan tribes.
1. bUll, a large , very palatable fish (Chichla ocellaris,) about two feet long; it is ca lled rucunare, in Le . 4. veerike, from ~'etiro, "open, a clearing, a spot devoid of trees."

A literal translation could be "serum ," but in their final interpretation the commentators stated that semen was meant. nereri (nasal.), " to lick, to lap up." 6. miroaya, lit. , "current-creek;" the commentators glossed this as "wind-river." However, the term might also be related to mirir/, " to drown;" see note 49.
doe, a large fi sh (Erythrinus tarieira), called tarira , in Le. piraruke, giant red-fish (Arapaima gigas), called pirarucu , in Le. It may grow to two meters length , and a weight of up to 300 pounds, and probably is the biggest of all fresh-water fish. The tongue has an osseous structure and has phaJlic connotations; it is also used as a grater.

The "people downriver" are the Brazilians of Taraeua. a point that, at present, is said to be the upper limit of pirarucu fish. igero, lit., "that-big one;" some commentators glossed this term as "the monster." 10. keya, "scaffold, grid, screen." 17. nyemero, "that-beast big." 20. saari, "to embark." yuriari, "to descend, to go downriver." 24. koena, exclamation of dispair. gorasome, "you cannot do it;" from gorari, "not to be able." 30.

That is, if they had not displaced the "other people," whoever they were. 58. mellyuri, "to throwaway;" it is understood that these "pieces" are small groups of women who were captured or became incorporated by the Desana brothers.

Summary 527
SUMMARY
The Northwest Amazon is an immense area of migrations, of wanderings, and of culture contacts. In the course of hunting, fishing and exploring, in fleeing from dangers, or while taking possession of the lands of enemies, Indian societies have been on the move for many centuries. Archaeology, linguistics, and tribal traditions point to a pattern of con tinous movements, sometimes over large distances, and there is little evi dence for permanence, stability , and locally limited growth. It is not surprising, then, that the myths and tales of these peoples contain a vivid reflection of this restless past, together with its conflicts and anxieties. In fact, what many of these mythical narratives describe is the life of dis placed persons, of small groups of people who move about in search of the most elementary conditions for survival: food, women, and shelter. The basic content of these traditions is thus quite realistically stated, and one may add here that, in the tropical rain forest, to secure possession of females, is far more important than the food quest or the need to settle down; individual caloric intake is easier to achieve than social survival. In Desana mythology, food , sex , and violence are not metaphors; t~ey are facts of life. The pursuit of women and all it entails, is the theme that underlies most of these oral traditions. There are scenes of raiding and abduction, of bride service and uneasy alliances, of enforced reciprocity , and often all of this is overshadowed by these strange women's faithlessness. No wonder they are said to be the origin of Illness, Sin, and Death . And next follows the theme of the gradual establishment and maintenance of formal marriage alliances, an ever-present focus of tensions. People are truly afraid of their affines, and anxieties persist even in the ritual framework of long established relationships. In a sense, this is a nationalistic mythology, in that it tries to justify the Desana's presence in the Vaupes territory. But it does not glorify; the ancestors of old are not depicted as heroes, but as wandering rogues; not as culture bearers bu t as borrowers, as opportunists. Often they are men cast in desperate situations. This is history in the raw. The myths do not try to justify contemporary institutions, but rather speak of the hardships and vicissitudes of a recent historical process, in the course of which this or that institution or trait were introduced from the outside, almost as if by chance. In this manner, Desana society is shown in continous develop ment. In view of this past of wanderings and fluctuating contacts we



528 Summary
can neither speak of an overall Tukanoan mythology , nor can we safely separate the Tukanoan peoples into distinct tribal units, each witil its own oral literature. Some themes may cut across large areas; others will be limited to small regions, perhaps to only a few people who happen to share a common sib tradition, or who have heard some myths recited by the same powerful orator. nut in an area as diversified as the Northwe st Amazon, it would be unrealistic to try to separate and trace the finer strains and threads of this web of multiple , interpenetrating influences. It is clear that not all Tukanoan peoples share in the same system of knowledge. The main themes of Desana mythology - as far as one can identify it as a separate, male oral tradition - refer to realistic , empirical facts; solar energy , the cyclic motions of celestial bodies and their meteorolo gical correlates, the equatorial line and the Coriolis effect, the physiology of impregnation and embryonic development, the bio-psychology of the life-cycle , the drug experience, sensory input and brain manipulation, metabolism and toxicity, the properties of the rock crystal, animal behavior, plant reproduction and growth, the need to conserve natural re sources, etc. In all these basic aspects, then , the myths are "true;" they are built upon that which is common to all men. There is only one true Creation Myth: the creation of man in the Lake of Milk, from the Sun Father's semen. All others are historical accounts of explorations, first contacts, and the process of alliances. In a sense, all Desana narratives are life histories: origin myths represent birth; animal myths, maturity; myth of sin represent illness and death. The individual components, the episodes and minor motifs , are represented by a wide range of images, some of which are these: solar energy heat, light , color spectrum, crystal, semen, father image, Time and Evolution moon mother/sister image, liver, menstruation , in cest, maculae, jagu8r/puma , deer , monthly change, plant growth thunder father image , sexual potency Milky Way trail, river snake-skin, anaconda/ boa. stream of semen, foo tprints Coriolis effect whirlpools, dust devils, cloud formations, dance direction, pottery coils, dextral or sinistral twist of flutes and cigars; Cr. birth imagery impregnation clearing and planting a field, pollination , fulmi nation. dancing, biting, beating with a rod

I shall not repeat here the innumerable individual symbols, analogues, metaphors, and similes con tained in the tex ts; what I want to stress is the essential realism of this corpus of traditions. The emphasis, throughout, is on procreation, but this act has to take place within the limits of "edibility;" foreign women are potentially toxic, just like the bitter maniuc which is their cultural heritage . They speak a different language. They have a different odor, and by this, reference is made not only to a different pheromonal constitution. Although women are the articulating links in the chain of survival, they are "other" people and so they have to be detoxified by ritual. The question remains: In what con sists the poison" Is there only "poison" and "non-poison"" Many people seem to see it that way; some shamans reduce it to a polarity of Good and Evil. But there seems to be more to it. ' The main preoccupation is incest. The Desana say that in the earliest times when the ancestral bands were roaming in the forests, incestuous rela tionships were common. No pathological consequences are ever mentioned, and the general attitude is that incest is no major problem as long as there is nu offsprin g. but tile need for strict incest laws i, cuns!:lntly extolled as a condition for social survival through marriage alliances. The establishment of the incest law is made to coincide with the introduction of yoje, the hallucinogenic drug. In this manner, the child's discovery of



530 SUllunary
sex is immediately linked to the necessity of incest prohibitions. It is said that, until then, people lived in incestuous unions and were "like animals;" ira poreru iJay6ra, ira (hi bay6ra, "they ate their tails, they ate their flesh," when under the influence of the drug, that is, of the sexual urge. But the first Desana refrained from doing so. Those who continued to "eat their own flesh" (bahsi dii) were Tapir, Monkey, Squirrel, and some others, all of them representatives of the Arawakan tribes the Desana found to be living in the Vaupes territory. The significance of the narcotic trance state is shown to go beyond the immediate Dionysian level. A pertinent commentary says: "To drink yaje is a spiritual birth; childbirth is only a matter of the body." This spiritual birth, however, is the consequence of an equally spiritual incest with the mother image. When discussing Yaje Woman's question: "Who is the father of this child?" the narrator himself explained: "The father is the same person who drank yajc. Each one himself is the progenitor." When asked: "Who is the mother')" the repJy was: "He wants to return to his own mother, by means of yajc." To this, another commentator added: "But not all of them can do this; some will eat their own flesh." This statement was glossed as: "Some commit biological incest, instead of spiritually returning to their mother.'· Tllis basic archetype: the maternal image, associated with a child, is central to many trance states. In a sense, the narcotic experience may turn out to be a descent into hell, into the world of death. The mythical narratives which follow this fundamental event the introduction of narcotic trance accompanied by incest laws - con stitute, in all essence, a moralising history which, although sometimes expressing deeply felt emotions, consists of episodes which emphasise correct, controlled social behavior in situations of reciprocal obligations. l3ut conditions are ever changing, as I said at the outset. After a historic period of uxorilocal services and humiIia tions (and the corresponding emphasis on the evidence of springing from a specific womb), patrilineal descent and virilocal residence become the rule. Perhaps these scenes do not always describe facts, but rather state intentions. There is a Jot of wishful thinking in these myths, used for moralising purposes. The chains of episodes, with all their As-ifery, appear quite often as a kind of moral istic psychodrama. In fact, many narratives could be prefaced thus: "Now let's suppose you wanted to (do this or that,)" or: "Here is the story of a man who ..." These developments are couched in a metaphoric language tile subtelties of which are accessible only to the native speaker and listener,

and even that only at a certain level of comprehension and insight. I shall return to this point. It is striking how very few well-marked personalities are mentioned in the myths and tales. The major figures, such as the Sun Father (abc page) or the Progenitor (pamur[ mallse) are not elaborated; others, such as boreka, bis[u, or bush dog, are described in a few words, showing them as cowards, lazy, lustful or aggressive, but hardly more. There are a few stereotypes: the seductress, the old crone, the ogre, the wandering youth. In many aspects, all mythical beings are forces of nature. The only real person is the First Desana. Although nameless, he comes to life, not as a man bu t as a prototype , almost as an ideal, the ideal of the successful survivor. When hearing of his exploits, what comes to mind is some story of an acciden t and its few survivors. What is implied is more cunning than courage, more resourcefulness than bravery; but above all, a tremendous zest for "reaching the headwaters," whatever that image might stand for. The "old country" is never mentioned. When telling a mythical narrative the Desana speaker takes fOL granted that his audience has.a good knowledge of culture history and variability in the Vaupes area. After the first few sentences outlining a scene, most adult people will immediately project a context, and a few specific names or terms will provide a backdrop and a comparative per spective. This initial stage-setting is important for the native audience, but the ethnographer who does not possess this semantic information and is as yet unaware of the multivocal imagery, is likely to miss these opening clues. To illustrate this point, let us suppose that I am speaking of the Argonauts, lnigo Jones, the l3attle of Books, the l3auhaus, or Ver Sacrum. If I pronounce any of these expressions in conversation, any moderately educated person will immediately be able to place it within a wider contex t of chronology, h.istorical period, literary associations, etc. The same will be true, then, with such Desana expressions as : at Ipanore, Tapir's trap, Yaje Woman , rock crystal, or Orion's Belt. Or, for example, a term like "yellow" will immediately be associated with: male fertility, long-drawn whistling sounds, dot- and line-shaped phosphenes, the sun, honey, and so on. As soon as the native listener hears one of these terms, or an allusion to them, a contextual scenery will rise before his eyes, to . gether with a multitude of additional information the narrator does not even have to mention in his recital, because he knows that his audience is acquainted with it. An understanding of the narratives' contents can, therefore, be achieved only by linguistic competence, a detailed knowledge of the

ethnographic and physical setting, and exhaustive native exegesis. 11 is absolutely necessary to bring the living facts to bear on the study of these myths. The reward will be an understanding of Desana society and culture, on the level of truly fundamental thought patterns. However, the images we encounter in these myths are finite; what at first might appear to be a wondrous variety of different motifs , often enough is reduced to Freudian banalities; but even so, there is life and strife and puzzlement; there are human minds at work trying to explain, to make sense, to bring order into chaos. And it is there where the antluo pologist's interest should concentrate: on motivations and goals, as expres sed in the oral literature; on the images in which the Indians perceive them, and on the mechanisms by which they try to achieve them. Here one cannot use a taxidermic approach; there is life in these tales. Interpretation , though , is almost always a matter of operating on several levels. While reciting a text , or afterwards, a shaman will hardly ever explain a particular episode or verbal expression, escept on the most elementary level. Nor is it likely that anybody will ask him questions. Usually the audience remains silent, and each of its members will have unuerstood the woru s accoruing lO his personal knowledge and experience. These mythical levels of interpretation are coherent sets of images which form specific frameworks. For example, their may be a level of physical geography, or of astronomy, or of animal behavior, or of material culture. A myth or a particular episode may be interpreted in terms of spatial relationships, of longhouse architecture , or of human physiology anel anatomy. Since the same words may have different meanings, the level of interpretation will vary accordmg lO llle Ils,ener' " ~ L, Sp ,.i' t:,CSl al,er native meanings which encode different sets of information. As long as this information is expressed in analogies - as it often is the case .- the ii,leJlcf \\ tliuave no difl icullies ill following certain cOllllllun sense streams of thought. In Desana, "thought jumps," it jumps sideways, as they say; things are "like" (do/Jpa) other things. The Desana emphasis on mirr6r images, on the echo, the double, on brain lateralisation , is related to this and constitutes an overall concept of duality. Reciprocity. of course, is analogy; one tries to find " analogous women," "analogous foods;" indeed , the food/sex analogy is fundamental. And then, analogues give life and color to language; their spontaneousness and elasticity always make sense. Hut as soon as metaphors are used and begin to take their cryptic turns. there will be room for individual invenlion. for searching and gues sing. At the same time, the semantic framework shifts from der/m {lIri, the visible world, to deyobiri turi. the invisible world, and back. Some

times a quite realistically described scene will change into a vision; a person will simply disappear or flyaway. It may well take a life-time be fore the native listener comes to understand the metaphoric spectrum of a particular message. [n the course of time people will be exposed to fre quent recitations of the same texts. A shaman never expects his audience to understand all levels of meaning, but he believes that, after having heard a te.\t many times, the listener hill]self will be able to find meaning in words and in the images they depict. The oral presentation, after all, is only an aide-memoire; a myth tries to produce awareness, to awaken associations and to fix them in the mind. It operates, at first, on an entirely unconscious level. [t is the listener's task to wllrk out the meaning on a conscious level. Indeed, the semantic reading of these messages depends entirely upon a previous, and steadily growing, awareness of the symbolic structure according to which the Desana see the Universe and Man's existence. In its barest outlines this structure is based on the premises that our earth and the heavens form parellellandscapes; that Sun, Moon, and Thunder are anthropomorphised and inhabit this double land scape; and that landscape, man, and his artifacts, share a common anatomy. And that there is a male and a female anatomy. The cultural assumptions are reciprocal relationships. This is the essence. The interpretation the native listener will give to these texts, for his own personal understanding, is likely to take two possible orientations. The average male hearer will interpret most texts in terms of gross sexual innuendos, and will see in the episodes a series of accounts of the struggle for male dominance. Shamans and other intellectuals, however, will insist upon the covert theme of "illumination," of the "white light of the sun," of man's transcendence beyond the physical sphere. Their emphasis will be on the implicit descriptions of a process of individuation. To them, the gradual steps of development, of transformation, of time's relativity, and of those sudden glimpses of "other" dimensions, carry the true message. Man according to them, is not merely the result of a combination of yellow and red color energies, but the "white brilliance" of the sun is a fundamental component of his existence, a component that leads the way back to the cosmic womb of oblivion. This return to the mother image contains the promise of spiritual nourishment. It is thus necessary to see the message of the myths within the context of hallucinatory trance states. These states, as expressions of psychological conflicts, are central to shamanic thinking, because they are thought to provide proof for the existence of '"another world." a world where no one clies. These trance states enforce the idea of immortality by transcendence, and their nourish
