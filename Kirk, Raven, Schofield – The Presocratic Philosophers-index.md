PREFACE
This book is designed primarily for those who have more than a casual interest in the history of early Greek thought ; but by translating all Greek passages, and confining some of the more detailed discussion to small-type notes at the end of paragraphs, we have also aimed to make the book useful for those students of the history
of philosophy or science who have no previous acquaintance with this important and fascinating field.
Two points should be emphasized. First, we have limited our scope to the chief Presocratic 'physicists' and their forerunners, whose main preoccupation was with the nature (physis) and coherence of things as a whole. More specialized scientific interests were
simultaneously developing throughout the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., especially in mathematics, astronomy, geography, medicine and biology ; but for lack of space, and to some extent of evidence, we have not pursued these topics beyond the interests of the chief
physicists. We have also excluded the Sophists, whose positive philosophical contribution, often exaggerated, lay mainly in the fields of epistemology and semantics. Secondly, we have not set
out to produce a necessarily orthodox exposition (if, indeed, such a thing is conceivable in a field where opinion is changing so
rapidly), but have preferred in many places to put forward our
own interpretations. At the same time we have usually mentioned
other interpretations of disputed points, and have always tried to present the reader with the main materials for the formation of his
own judgement. The part of the book dealing with the Ionian tradition, including its forerunners and also the atomists and Diogenes (i.e.
chapters i-vi, xvn and xvm), with the note on the sources, is by G. S. Kirk, while the part dealing with the Italian tradition, and
also the chapters on Anaxagoras and Archelaus (i.e. chapters vn
xvi), are by J. E. Raven. The contributions of each author were of course subjected to detailed criticism by the other, and the planning of the book as a whole is by both. The scale of different sections of the book is admittedly rather variable. Where the evidence is fuller and clearer particularly where considerable fragments survive, as for example in the case
vii



PREFACE
of Parmenides the commentary can naturally be shorter; where the evidence is sparser and more confusing, as for example in the case of Anaximander or the Pythagoreans, our own explanations must be longer and more involved. Chapter i in particular, which
deals with a part of the subject which is often neglected, is perhaps
more detailed in parts than its ultimate importance demands, and
non-specialists are advised to leave it until last.
Only the most important texts have been quoted, and those in
an inevitably personal selection. For a nearly complete collection of fragments and testimonies the reader should turn to H. Diels,
Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (5th and later editions, Berlin, 1934-54, edited by W. Kranz). This fundamental work is referred
to by the abbreviation DK. Where a DK number (e.g. DK28 A 12)
is appended to the reference of a passage quoted in the present work, this means that DK, in the section referred to, quotes more
of the passage in question than we do. DK references are omitted
where less, or no more, of the text is given, and also in the case of
fragments (where the fragment-number, always in Diels' numeration, is the same as the number in the relevant B-section in DK). Where supplements occur in texts quoted, without further in
formation, they are usually by Diels, and reference may be made
to the textual notes in DK.
We are obviously indebted to many friends for suggestions and
help; and also, as goes without saying, to previous writers like Zellcr, Burnet, Cornford, Ross and Cherniss. Many of these debts are recorded in the text. For typographical advice and assistance
we are indebted to the printing staff of the Cambridge University Press. H. Lloyd-Jones and I. R. D. Mathewson read the proofs
and made many valuable suggestions. Another outstanding con
tribution was made by F. H. Sandbach, whose numerous acute and learned comments on the final draft were of the utmost value,
and to whom^ as an unworthy offering, we should like to dedicate this book. G.S.K.

INTRODUCTORY NOTE
THE SOURCES FOR PRESOCRATIC
PHILOSOPHY
A. DIRECT QUOTATIONS
The actual fragments of the Presocratic thinkers are preserved as quotations in subsequent ancient authors, from Plato in the fourth
century B.C. to Simplicius in the sixth century A.D., and even, in rare cases, to late Byzantine writers like John Tzetzes. The date of
the source in which a quotation occurs is not, of course, a reliable
guide to its accuracy. Thus Plato is notoriously lax in his quotations from all sources ; he often mixes quotation with paraphrase,
and his attitude to his predecessors is frequently not objective but humorous or ironical. The Neoplatonist Simplicius, on the other
hand, who lived a whole millennium after the Presocratics, made
long and evidently accurate quotations, in particular from
Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia; not for the sake of literary embellishment, but because in his commentaries on the Physics and de caelo of Aristotle he found it
necessary to expound Aristotle's views on his predecessors by set
ting down their actual words. At times Simplicius did this at
greater length than was essential because, as he tells us, a particular ancient work had become so rare.
Aristotle, like Plato, gave comparatively few direct quotations, and his main value is as a summarizer and critic of earlier thinkers.
Apart from Plato, Aristotle, and Simplicius, the following notable sources of verbatim extracts may be singled out for special mention:
(i) Plutarch, the Academic philosopher, historian and essayist of the second century A.D., in his extensive Moral Essays made
hundreds of quotations (often expanded, interpolated or partly reworded by himself) from the Presocratic thinkers.
(ii) Sextus 'Empiricus', the Sceptic philosopher and physician of the late second century A.D., expounded the theories of Aenesi
demus, who lived some two centuries earlier and himself relied to a great extent on Hellenistic sources. Sextus quotes many early
passages bearing on cognition and the reliability of the senses.



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
(iii) Clement of Alexandria, the learned head ofthe Catechetical school, lived in the second half of the second century A.D. and the
early years of the third. A convert to Christianity, Clement nevertheless maintained his interest in Greek literature of all kinds, and used a wide knowledge and a remarkable memory
to point his comparisons between paganism and Christianity with frequent quotations from the Greek poets and philosophers (chiefly in his Protrepticus and the eight books of Stromateis or
Miscellanies) .
(iv) Hippolytus, bishop of Rome in the third century A.D., wrote a Refutation of all Heresies in nine books, which attacked
Christian heresies by claiming them to be revivals of pagan philosophy. For example, the Noetian heresy was a revival of Heraclitus' theory of the coincidence of opposites a contention which
Hippolytus attempted to substantiate by the quotation of no less than seventeen sayings of Heraclitus, many of them otherwise unknown.
(v) Diogenes Laertius compiled, probably in the third century A.D., a trivial but from our point of view important Lives of Famous Philosophers in ten books. In his biographical and doxo
graphical notices, derived mainly from Hellenistic sources, he included occasional short quotations.
(vi) John Stobaeus, the fifth-century A.D. anthologist, assembled in his Anthologium educative extracts from the whole range of Greek
literature, but with special emphasis on ethical sayings. Many
Presocratic fragments (notably of Democritus) are preserved by him, often in a somewhat impure form. Stobaeus' main sources were the handbooks and compendia which proliferated in the Alexandrian period. In addition to the main sources noted above, quotations from the Presocratics occur here and there in many other ancient
writers : in Stoics like Marcus Aurelius and eclectics like Maximus of Tyre; in Christian writers other than Clement and Hippolytus,
for example in Origen; occasionally in Aetius (see B, 4, b; direct quotations in Aetius are rare) ; in technical authors like Galen the
doctor, Strabo the geographer and Athenaeus the anthologist of food and drink; and, not least important, in Neoplatonic writers from Numenius, Plotinus, Porphyry and lamblichus (the last two
of whom wrote on Pythagoras) down to Proclus and, of course, the
invaluable Simplicius.



SOURCES FOR PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHY
To conclude these notes on the sources of direct quotations, it must be emphasized that the author of a direct quotation need not
have seen the original work, since summaries, anthologies and compendia of every kind, produced in large numbers in the three centuries following the foundation of Alexandria, were regarded as an adequate substitute for most prose originals of a technical nature.
B. TESTIMONIA
(1) PLATO is the earliest commentator on the Presocratics (though there were occasional references in Euripides and Aristo
phanes). His comments, however, are for the most part only casual ones, inspired, like many of his quotations, by irony or amusement. Thus his references to Heraclitus, Parmenidcs and Empedocles are
more often than not light-hearted obiter dicta, and one-sided or exaggerated ones at that, rather than sober and objective historical
judgements. Provided this is recognized, Plato has much of value
to tell us. One passage, Phaedo 96 ff., gives a useful but brief survey
of fifth-century physical preoccupations. (2) ARISTOTLE gave more serious attention to his philosophical
predecessors than Plato had done, and prefaced some of his treatises with formal surveys of their opinions, notably in Meta
physics A. However, his judgements are often distorted by his view
of earlier philosophy as a stumbling progress towards the truth that Aristotle himself revealed in his physical doctrines, especially those concerning causation. There are also, of course, many acute and valuable criticisms, and a store of factual information. (3) THEOPHRASTUS undertook the history of previous philosophy, from Thales to Plato, as part of his contribution to the
encyclopaedic activity organized by his master Aristotle just as Eudemus undertook the history of theology, astronomy and mathematics and Menon that of medicine. According to Diogenes
Laertius5 list of his works, Theophrastus wrote sixteen (or eighteen)
books of Physical Opinions (or Opinions of the Physicists; the Greek genitive is OUCTIKCOV 8ocov) ; these were later epitomized in two
volumes. Only the last book, On sensation, is extant in its greater part ;
but important extracts from the first book, On material principles,
were copied down by Simplicius in his commentary on Aristotle's
Physics. (Some of these extracts Simplicius derived from lost commentaries by the important Peripatetic commentator Alexander



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
of Aphrodisias.) In this first book Theophrastus treated the
different thinkers in roughly chronological order, adding their
city, patronymic, and sometimes date or mutual relationship. In the remaining books the order was chronological only within the
main logical divisions. In addition to the general history Theo
phrastus wrote special works on Anaximenes, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, Archelaus, and (in several volumes) Democritus. These
have unfortunately perished; presumably Theophrastus went to greater pains to consult the original sources for these thinkers.
From the available evidence, however, his judgements even on
them were often derived directly from Aristotle, without much
attempt to apply a new and objective criticism.
(4) THE DOXOGRAPHIGAL TRADITION. (a) Its general nature.
Theophrastus' great work became the standard authority for the ancient world on Presocratic philosophy, and is the source
of most subsequent collections of 'opinions' (86ai, ccp&TKOVTCc or placita). These collections took different forms, (i) In close
reproductions of Theophrastus' arrangement each major topic was considered in a separate section, the different thinkers being treated successively within each section. This was the
method of Aetius and his source, the ' Vetusta Placita' (see p. 5).
(ii) Biographical doxographers considered all the opinions of each philosopher together, in company with details of his life supplied, to a large extent, by the febrile imaginations of Hellenistic bio
graphers and historians like Hermippus of Smyrna, Hieronymus of Rhodes and Neanthes of Cyzicus. The result is exemplified in the
biographical medley of Diogenes Laertius. (iii) Another type of doxographical work is seen in the AiaBoxoci, or accounts of philosophical successions. Its originator was the Peripatetic Sotion of Alexandria, who around 200 B.C. wrote a survey of previous philosophers arranged by schools. The known thinkers were related to each other in a descending line of master and pupil (here
Sotion was extending and formalizing a process begun by Theophrastus) ; in addition, the Ionian school was clearly distinguished from the Italian. Many of the patristic doxographical summaries
(notably those in Eusebius, Irenaeus, Arnobius, Theodoretus who, however, also made direct use of Aetius and St Augustine) were based on the brief accounts in the Succession-writers.
(iv) The chronographer Apollodorus of Alexandria composed, in the middle of the second century B.C., a metrical account of the



SOURCES FOR PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHY
dates and opinions of the philosophers. This rested partly on Sotion's division into schools and masters, partly on the chronology
of Eratosthenes, who had sensibly assigned dates to artists, philosophers and writers as well as to political events. Apollodorus
filled in the gaps left by Eratosthenes, on very arbitrary principles : a philosopher's acme or period of chief activity was assumed to be at the age of forty, and was made to coincide with the nearest of
a number of major chronological epochs, for example the capture of Sardis in 546/5 B.C. or the foundation of Thurii in 444/3.
Further, a supposed pupil was always made forty years younger than his supposed master.
(b) Aetius and the 'Vetusta Placita\ Two extant doxographical
summaries, closely resembling each other, were independently derived from a lost original the collection of Opinions made by Aetius, an otherwise unknown compilator, probably of the second century A.D., whose name is known from a reference in Theo
doretus. These extant summaries are the Epitome ofphysical opinions,
in five books, which falsely claims to be by Plutarch; and the
Physical extracts which appear in book i (for the most part) of
Stobaeus' Anthologium. (From the former, which was widely read, are derived notices in pseudo-Galen, Athenagoras, Achilles and
Cyril.) Dicls in his great Doxographi Graeci arranged these two sources in parallel columns as the Placita of Aetius. This forms our
most extensive, if not always our most accurate, doxographical
authority. Aetius' work was based, not directly on Theophrastus* history, but upon an intermediate summary of it produced, probably, in the Posidonian school in the first century B.C. This lost work was
named by Diels the Vetusta Placita. In it Stoic, Epicurean and Peripatetic opinions were added to those recorded by Theo
phrastus, and much that was derived from Theophrastus was subjected to Stoic re-formulation. Aetius himself added further
Stoic and Epicurean opinions, as well as a few definitions and
introductory comments. A direct use of the Vetusta Placita was made by Varro (in Censorinus' de die natali), and is seen also in the
brief doxography in Cicero, Academica priora n, 37, 118.
(c) Other important doxographical sources, (i) Hippolytus. The first
book of his Refutation of all Heresies, the so-called Philosophoumena
once attributed to Origen, is a biographical doxography containing separate accounts of the main philosophers. The sections on



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Thales, Pythagoras, Empedocles, Heraclitus, the Eleatics and the Atomists come from a trifling biographical summary and are of small value, unlike those on Anaximander, Anaximenes, Anaxagoras, Archelaus and Xenophanes, which come from a fuller and
much more valuable biographical source. At many points the comments of the second group are more detailed, and less inac
curate, than the corresponding ones in Aetius. (ii) The pseudoPlutarchean Stromateis. These short 'Miscellanies' (which must be
distinguished from the Epitome, from Aetius, also ascribed to Plutarch) are preserved by Eusebius; they come from a source similar to that of the second group in Hippolytus. They differ in that they concentrate on the subject-matter of the earlier books in Theophrastus, those that dealt with the material principle, cosmo
gony, and the heavenly bodies; and they contain much verbiage
and pretentious interpretation. However, some important details are preserved which do not occur elsewhere, (iii) Diogenes
Laertius. Apart from biographical details culled from many
sources, some useful chronological data from Apollodorus, and
deplorable epigrams from the pen of Diogenes himself, the opinions of each thinker are usually set out in two distinct doxographical
notes: the first (what Diogenes called the Ke9ccAccicb5r|$ or summary account) from a worthless biographical source like that used
by Hippolytus in the first group, and the second (the ETT! nepou$ or detailed account) from a fuller and more reliable epitome like
that used by Hippolytus for his second group. (5) CONCLUSION. It must be remembered that many writers
who were independent of the direct Theophrastean tradition are
known to have devoted special works to the early philosophers. For
example the fourth-century-B.c. Academic, Heraclides of Pontus, wrote four books on Heraclitus, and so did the Stoic Cleanthes;
while Aristotle's pupil Aristoxenus wrote biographies which included one of Pythagoras. Allowance must be made, therefore,
for the possibility of isolated non-Theophrastean judgements appearing in later eclectic sources like Plutarch or Clement;
though most such judgements that we can recognize show signs, nevertheless, of Aristotelian, or of Stoic, Epicurean, or Sceptic, influence. Theophrastus remains the main source of information,
and his work is known to us through the doxographers, through the quotations by Simplicius, and through the extant de sensu.
From these it is evident that Theophrastus was strongly influenced



SOURCES FOR PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHY
by Aristotle who, as has been stated, did not aim, as Theo
phrastus should have done, at extreme historical objectivity. Theophrastus was no more successful than is to be expected in understanding the motives of an earlier period and a different world of thought; a further defect was that, once having extracted
a general pattern of explanations, particularly for cosmological events, he tended to impose it, perhaps too boldly, in cases where he lacked full evidence cases which seem to have been not
infrequent. Thus it is legitimate to feel complete confidence in our understanding of a Presocratic thinker only when the Aristotelian
or Theophrastean interpretation, even if it can be accurately reconstructed, is confirmed by relevant and well-authenticated
extracts from the philosopher himself.



CHAPTER I
THE FORERUNNERS OF
PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
In this long preliminary chapter certain ideas are examined which
are not truly 'philosophical'; they are mythological rather than rationalistic in context, but may nevertheless appear as significant
preludes to the truly rational attempts to explain the world, attempts which began with Thales.
We are not concerned here with pure mythology, but with
concepts which, although expressed in the language and through the personages of myth, arc not mythopoeic in kind but are the
result of a direct, empirical, non-symbolical way of thinking. These quasi-rationalistic views of the world are most frequently concerned with its earliest history, starting from its actual birth or creation ;
for this way of thinking was incidental to the attempt (made most
notably by Hesiod in the Theogony) to systematize the manifold
deities of legend by deriving them from a common ancestor or pair of ancestors at the beginning of the world. Yet the active investigation of the world's ancestry, whether mainly mythical as in Hesiod or mainly rational as in the Milesian philosophers, must have been
carried on only by the few. The general structure of the present
world, the common environment of experience, was of wider interest; and here a common, naive, extroverted but nevertheless
partly mythical account seems to have been widely accepted. It
appears from time to time in Homer and is briefly described in i . In 2 and 3 two concepts are examined which were later credited
with cosmogonical importance by the Greeks themselves, those of Okeanos and of Nyx (Night). 4, 5 and 6 are concerned with
three special accounts, all of primarily non-philosophical character but all treating of cosmogonical topics: first the Hesiodic Theogony', then the various cosmogonical ideas associated with Orpheus,
finally (at greater and indeed somewhat disproportionate length) the intriguing but fragmentary views of Pherecydes of Syros. In the case of Night, and of Orphic cosmogony, the conclusions will
be largely negative : little of direct significance for the development of Presocratic thought is revealed, although in view of constant
8



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
assertions to the contrary it is as well to subject the evidence to a
careful scrutiny. Pherecydes may have written his book no earlier than Anaximander, but its matter is likely to be in part traditional, and therefore not irrelevant to the state ofcosmogonical speculation
even before Thales. On some points reference will be made to the
comparative mythology of earlier near-eastern cultures, especially Babylonian, Egyptian, and Hittitc. There are strong similarities
between some of the Greek theogonical and cosmogonical stories
and the theogonical myths of the great river-civilizations and their
neighbours; these similarities help to explain some details of Greek accounts down to and including Thales. Translations of the main
non-Greek texts are most conveniently to be found in Ancient Near Eastern Texts relating to the Old Testament, ed. J. B. Pritchard
(Princeton, 2nd ed. 1955), which will be referred to as Pritchard ANET. Useful summaries, both in the Pelican series, are H. Frank
fort and others, Before Philosophy* and O. R. Gurney, The Hittites. Nothing will be said in this chapter about the development of the concept of the soul. The Homeric idea of the psyche or breathsoul as an insubstantial image of the body, giving it life and
surviving it in a wretched, bloodless existence in Hades, is too familiar to need description here. Rohde's Psyche, E. R. Dodds'
The Greeks and the Irrational (Berkeley, 1951), or chapter 5 of
Jaeger's Theology of the Early Greek Philosophers (Oxford, 1947), give a good account of the popular, pre-philosophical idea of the soul.
Pythagoras was possibly the first Greek explicitly to treat the soul
as something of moral importance, and Heraclitus first clearly indicated that knowledge of the soul was relevant to knowledge of the structure of the cosmos. Yet the conception that the substance of the soul was related to aither, or to the substance of the stars,
seems from fifth-century B.C. poetical contexts to have existed for
some time already as part of the complex body of popular beliefs, alongside the distinct Homeric concept of a breath-soul. These antecedents will be summarized in the chapters on Thales,
Anaximenes, Heraclitus and Empedocles (see pp. 95 ff., isgff., 200, 205 ff., 360). The main object of the earliest deliberate efforts to
explain the world remained the description of its growth from a
simple, and therefore fully comprehensible, beginning. Matters
concerned with human life seemed to belong to a different type of enquiry, in which the old inherited assumptions, though sometimes

PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
inconsistent, were still valid. It is with the derivation of the world as
a whole, then, regarded as external to its human centre, that the rest of this chapter will be mainly concerned. It will nevertheless be seen that the world's original state, and the method by which it
diversified itself, were imagined anthropomorphically, in terms of
a parent or pair of parents. This genealogical approach persisted even after the eventual abandonment by the Milesian philosophers
of the traditional mythological framework.
I. THE NAIVE VIEW OF THE WORLD
The popular conception of the nature of the world, which can be traced mainly in scattered references in Homer, is roughly as
follows. The sky is a solid hemisphere like a bowl (//. 17, 425
XAAxeov oupocvov, cf. Pindar JV. 6, 3-4; oOpccvov is iroAuxocAKov at H* 5> 54> Od. 3, 2; aiSfjpeov oupavov at Od. 15, 329 and 17, 565. Solidity as well as brightness is presumably conveyed by these metallic
epithets). It covers the round flat earth. The lower part of the gap
between earth and sky, up to and including the clouds, contains ccf|p
or mist : the upper part (sometimes called the oupavos itself) is aiQfjp, aither, the shining upper air, which is sometimes conceived as fiery.

c the fir-tree reached
through the aer to the aither 9
. Below its surface, the earth stretches far downwards, and has its roots in or above Tartarus :

The foundation of Tartarus is thus 'brazen' (and so firm, un
yielding) like the sky : the symmetry is reflected also in the equal

FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
distance between sky and earth's surface, and earth's surface and its foundations for 'Hades' in the last line of I seems to be an
illogical variant upon an original 'earth', as in Theogony 720
TOCTCJOV evspQ' OTTO yffe oaov oOpocvos ear' GOTO yccir|$ (
c as far below, under earth, as sky is distant from it'). There was a certain vague
ness about the relationships of Hades, Erebos, and Tartarus, although Tartarus was certainly the lowest part of the underworld. The symmetry between underworld and overworld was not complete, of course : the floor of Tartarus was not normally con
ceived as hemispherical. A variant conception made the earth stretch downwards indefinitely:

(Cf. Strabo i, p. 12 Gas.)
This is a later formulation, but again a popular rather than an
intellectual one. There is no great difference in the underlying
thought; the difference is mainly that the mythological geography is not used here.
Round the edge of the earth-disc, according to the unsophisticated view, flowed the vast river of Okeanos. This concept was of
considerable importance in pre-scientific Greek thought, and is discussed in the section which follows.

That Okeanos surrounds the circular surface of the earth, though
not explicitly stated in the Homeric poems, is suggested in 4 (where the shield made for Achilles is obviously thought of as round), in
9, and by some of the epithets applied to Okeanos especially
ocy6ppoo$,
'
back-flowing
' (which probably means c
flowing back into
itself'). Passages in Euripides and others as well as in Herodotus (6) show that the idea of a circular surrounding Okeanos was widely
accepted; though occasionally in Homer, especially in the Odyssey, a looser usage, as the broad outer sea, had already begun to appear. 4 describes Okeanos as a river, and this too was a com
monly accepted view : references are frequent to the streams, pood, of Okeanos. As such, it was presumably composed of fresh water; and 5 (of which 1. 195 was unwarrantably athetized by Zenodotus) describes it as the source of all waters, whether fresh or salt, which are enclosed within its orbit, on or under the earth. The idea that salt water is simply fresh water somehow flavoured by
the earth was commonly held in the scientific period. The earth-encircling river differs from other elements of the
popular world-picture in that it cannot be obviously based upon
experience. The sky looks hemispherical and, to some eyes, impenetrable; it is called 'brazen', therefore, and treated as ice-like
or solid even by Anaximenes and Empedocles. The earth appears to be flat, and the horizon to be circular. Yet experience cannot so easily suggest that the ultimate horizon is bounded by a fresh
water river. Voyagers may have brought back reports of vast seas
beyond the Mediterranean, but these would be salt. Springs bubbling up from the earth may suggest underground rivers, but
these need not entail a surrounding river. The possibility must be
considered, then, that this particular conception originated further east, in the great river-civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia, and was somehow introduced into Greece and given a specific Hellenic form. It will be seen (pp. gof.) that Thales' idea of the
earth floating on water was probably so borrowed; and the coincidences in detail between Greek versions of certain myths,
6 They [the Greeks] affirm in words that Okeanos', beginning from the sun's risings, flows round the whole earth, but they give no effective demonstration of this.

FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
and Babylonian or Hittite versions, prove that conceptions not native either to the Aegean area, or to the proximate culture
centres of the Greek-speaking peoples before their entry into Greece, had embedded themselves in Greek thought even by the time of Hesiod (which we guess to be the seventh century B.C.),
and probably much earlier. These coincidences are briefly discussed on pp. 33 f. and 36 f. In the second part of the present
section on Okeanos, pp. i8f., the isolated Homeric references to
Okeanos as origin of all things will also appear as a probable allusion to non-Greek mythological ideas. In Babylonian accounts, and in some Egyptian versions, the earth was regarded as drying out, or thrusting itself up, in the midst of the primeval waters. 1
The development of such an idea is not surprising in Mesopotamia, where the land had indeed been formed from the marshlands between the two rivers; nor in Egypt, where the fertile land emerged each year as the Nile floods receded. The earth that
emerges from an indefinite expanse of primeval water will still be surrounded by water. This docs seem to provide a plausible, though not a certain, motive for the formation of the Greek concept of
Okeanos. In this popular development of the primeval-water motif the earth is regarded as being solidly rooted, once it has emerged, and the indefinite waste of water (which seems always to
have been conceived as having an upper limit, a surface) is contracted into a vast but not necessarily illimitable river.2 Thales, on
the other hand, postulated a floating earth and so was not simply
rationalizing the quasi-mythological Okeanos-interpretation.3
1 Gf. the Babylonian Creation-epic, which originated probably in the 2nd millennium B.C. : tablet I, 1-6 (Pritchard, Ancient Near Eastern Texts,
60 f.),
' When on high the heaven had not been named, Firm ground below
had not been called by name, Naught but primordial Apsu, their begetter,
(And) Mummu-Tiamat, she who bore them all, Their waters commingling
as a single body; No reed-hut had been matted, no marshland had
appeared . . . .' (Trans. E. A. Speiser. Apsu and Tiamat were the male and female principles of primeval water. Sometimes, but perhaps not here, they represent fresh and salt water respectively.) For Egypt cf. e.g. the
24th-century B.C. text from Heliopolis, ANET p. 3: *O Atum-Kheprer, thou wast on high on the (primeval) hill . . . .' (The primeval hillock was the first patch of land to rise above the boundless waters ; it was located in
many different cult-centres, and is symbolized by the pyramid.) Also
another version, from the Book of the Dead (in this form, latter part of 2nd millennium) :
' I am Atum when I was alone in Nun ; I am Re in his (first) appearances, when he began to rule that which he had made.'
13

(Trans. J. A. Wilson. Atum was the creator-god worshipped at Heliopolis
and equated with the sun-god Re. Nun is the primeval expanse of waters.)
3 Okeanos has a further bank in the (probably late) underworld-episode in the Odyssey, and in Hesiod.
3 In origin *60Keav6s was perhaps a non-personal descriptive term, conceivably related to Hittite 'uginna', meaning *
circle', or Sanskrit 'a-cayana-h s
, meaning 'that which surrounds*. Its development as a
mythological figure, as sometimes in Homer and Hesiod, must have been comparatively late; but for Thales it would represent the crude mythological past.
The encircling river was presupposed in the myth that the sun, after crossing the sky with his horses and chariot, sails in a golden bowl round the stream of Okeanos, to the north (as is probably implied by 'the depths of night' in 8), and so arrives back in the
east just before dawn :

This detail is not mentioned in Homer. 1 In Egypt the sun was conceived as travelling from west to east in a ship, across the subterranean waters. This may or may not have been the origin of the Greek account; but the choice of a cup or bowl may be based
upon the round shape of the sun itself, and suggests a more
empirical and not wholly mythopoeic approach. In Heraclitus (227) the sun itself is described as a hollow bowl filled with fire, and there may have been a popular account of this kind which
gave way to the more graphic conception of the sun as a
charioteer.
1 The sun rises from Okeanos (e.g. //. 7, 422), but there is no suggestion of a vessel of any kind. Perhaps this was taken for granted; but it is also possible that the idea of the sun sailing round Okeanos is post-Homeric. At Od. 10, 191 the sun goes under the earth, but this is a unique occurrence
in a passage that bears signs of lateness. The stars in Homer bathe in
Okeanos (e.g. //. 5,6; 1 8, 489) ; they can hardly all have boats, and might be conceived as going through Okeanos and passing under the earth, though such details need not have been visualized.

The preceding section outlined the usual account of Okeanos in
Homer. In the present passages the description of Okeanos as
origin of the gods (9) and of all things (10) is unique and un
expected. Nowhere else in Homer is Okeanos mentioned in terms
remotely resembling these; and it is notable that outside the
particular episode in which these two passages occur, the Aio$ or Deception of Zeus by Hera (//. 14, 153-360 and 15,

z'm'f.), there is almost nothing in Homer that can reasonably be
construed as specifically cosmogonical or cosmological in content; that is, as going beyond the accepted outline of what has been
termed the popular world-picture. Even in this episode there is not very much. 1 Indeed, there is little which might not be
explained without introducing cosmological interpretations, if a slight oddity of expression is allowed. This might apply even to Okeanos: 9 and 10 could imply no more than that the river of
Okeanos is the source of all fresh water (as in 5) ; water is necessary
for life, therefore life must have originated, directly or indirectly, from Okeanos. This would not explain his parenthood of the gods in 9; but that could be a poetical extension. It would also involve
limiting the application of TrivTeacji in 10 to living creatures and
plant-life, but again the same kind of poetic looseness might be presupposed. In any case the application of TrccvTeacn is in doubt; it might be taken to apply simply to the gods, as in 9, though without qualification its natural meaning is ' all things absolutely'. It must be admitted, however, that the references, if so understood, would be pointlessly abbreviated and give a somewhat bizarre
effect.
1 Namely 16 (Night) ; 18 (division of the world between Zeus, Poseidon, Hades) ; //. 14, 2O3f., 274 (= 15, 225), 279 (the only Homeric references to Kronos, the Titans and Tartaros except for two important passages in bk. 8, //. 8, i3fF. and 478 ff.) ; //. 14, 271 ; 15, 37f. (two of the four references
in Homer to Styx as oath of the gods). The last two cases might be regarded as intrusions with Hesiodic affinities, though they are not derived from the
Hcsiodic poems that we know.
To Plato and Aristotle, however, 9 and 10 certainly seemed to
have some kind of cosmological significance :

Plato in ii and elsewhere is obviously not entirely serious in his treatment of Homer as forerunner of the flux-idea assigned to Heraclitus, so we cannot be sure of the precise value he attached to
the Homeric Okeanos-passage. Aristotle, on the other hand, quite
certainly took it as a significant anticipation of Thales. The form of the argument about the Styx in 12 reminds us not always to
accept Aristotle's authority, as a historian of thought, without
question; but later antiquity was persuaded through him to accept Okeanos and Tethys as representative of an early cosmogonical theory, since Eudemus adduced the same passage (obviously following Aristotle in 12) in the Peripatetic history of theology. 1

It has often been assumed that there is another and earlier class
of testimony for the cosmogonical importance of Okeanos, namely early Orphic poetry:

But the Orphic verses of 14, though earlier than Plato's middle life, need not be archaic (i.e. as early as the seventh or even the
sixth century B.C.). In any case, the view which they express does not necessarily differ greatly from that of the Hesiodic Theogony
as Plato may have perceived. There, Okeanos, Tethys and the other Titans are born to Gaia and Ouranos at a comparatively
late stage from the point of view of cosmogonical production, but it is in their generation that the regular reproduction, by bisexual means, of fully personal figures (as opposed to world-constituents like Tartaros or Pontos) begins. 15, in which 'offspring of the gods' shows that Plato is describing an Orphic view, indicates that according to one Orphic account Okeanos and Tethys were the
parents of the Titans (including the theogonically vital pair Kronos and Rhea), and not their coevals as in the Theogony. That is
probably another reason for irpcoTOS in the Orphic verses of 14 :
Okeanos and Tethys are the first fully anthropomorphized couple
(though Okeanos, of course, is very much a border-line case), and prior even to Kronos and Rhea. Hesiod had assigned less importance to Okeanos than might reasonably have been expected, especially in view of the well-known Homeric passages 9 and 10 ; so the Orphic versions presumably emended the Hesiodic account to the extent of putting Okeanos and Tethys one generation earlier than the Titans. Certainly there is no evidence here for
assuming a peculiarly Orphic attribution of cosmogonical importance to Okeanos.
The evidence does not prove (or even, it might be felt, suggest) that there existed in Greece at a comparatively early date a
systematic doctrine of the cosmogonical priority of Okeanos. Hesiod gives no indication of it, and later suppositions seem to be based on the two unusual Homeric passages, which are left as the
only direct evidence for any such cosmogonical theory. They might have meant no more than that water is essential for life, though this would be rather odd. It was seen under section (i) that the idea of an encircling river Okeanos may well have been adapted
and Tethys were born as children ofGe [earth'] and Ouranos [sky], and their children were Phorkys, Kronos, Rhea and their companions ....
18



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
from Egyptian or Babylonian beliefs. It was part of those beliefs,
too, that the world originated from primeval water (see n. i on p. 13); the isolated Homeric passages could, then, be a reference to that basic near-eastern assumption, as Plutarch assumed in 70. The absence of any other such reference (at any rate until Thales)
suggests that the Homeric ones were idiosyncratic even, perhaps, pedantic; there are other indications that the composer of the
episode in which they occur had special cosmogonical and theogonical interests. The concept of the encircling river had, of course, become assimilated in Greece at a far earlier date.
3. NIGHT

This is the only place in the Homeric poems where Night is fully
personified. Again, as with the two special Okeanos passages, it occurs in the episode of the Deceit of Zeus ; and again there is an
unusual implication of special power or priority among the gods. Zeus' respect for Night here is certainly strange, and quite un
paralleled in Homer and Hesiod. In view of later interpretations
it might suggest that the poet of this episode knew some story about Nyx as a cosmogonical figure. But the reference is an isolated one,
and could be no more than a poetical development of the idea
implicit in the phrase Nu 6|Jir|T8ipa Qecov, 'Night subduer of the gods '
: even gods are overcome by sleep, hence even the virtually all-powerful Zeus hesitates to offend Night, the mother of sleep, lest she should subdue him on some unsuitable occasion. (It must be remarked, however, that he evidently had no hesitation about
offending Hypnos himself, if he was prepared in the present passage to fling him out of heaven.)
1 6 . . .and he [Zeus] would have cast me from the aither into the sea, out of'sight', had not Night, subduer of gods and men, saved me; to her did I come in flight, and eus
ceased, angry though he was; for he was in awe of doing what would be displeasing to swift Night.

Aristotle thus accepted that there were poets and writers about the
gods who put Night *
first', or who generated from Night. He may well have had the Homeric passage, 16, in mind; but this alone would hardly motivate his inclusion of Night, and it seems probable
that he was thinking primarily of the post-Hesiodic cosmogonies, produced during the sixth and fifth centuries B.C., to be described
under (iii) . In these, Night, which was produced at a very early stage
(though not the first) in the Hesiodic cosmogonical account (24), and was classed with Gaia, Okeanos and Ouranos in other more casual references in the Theogony (20 and io6f.), is elevated to the
first stage of all, either by herself or jointly with other substances, Air or Tartaros. It is natural that both Day and Night should come into being as soon as Sky and Earth have separated, to occupy the
gap between the two. 1 It is clear from Met. A 6, 1071 b 27 that by
ToO$ TrpcoTous in 17 Aristotle meant 'absolutely first', not simply 'at an early stage'; though all the four figures mentioned are
important in the Hesiodic account, and we have no knowledge of any cosmogony which gave absolute priority to Ouranos.
1 Among the offspring of Night in a subsequent passage of Hesiod, Theog.
21 1 ff., are the MoTpai and Nne(7is. This might seem to suggest that Night had a primordial distributive capacity (since the idea of distribution under
lies both these personifications), in a 8iaTais or assignment of parts of the
cosmos to different gods. Such a distribution is mentioned in Homer (again associated with the Deceit of Zeus): l8 Homer //. 15, 189

rule and kingship (Night and Ouranos or Chaos or Okeanos, for example), but %eus.

20

So in Hesiod, Theog. 1 1 2 f. and 88 1 ff. (the latter passage after the subjection of the Titans and the probably interpolated Typhoeus; cf. the division of
the heavens by Marduk after the defeat of Tiamat in the Babylonian
Creation-epic, ANET 67). Yet this happens at a relatively late stage in cosmogony; and Moira and Nemesis are probably associated with Night
merely because, like her other children (Death, Grief, etc.), they can be regarded as baleful and intractable powers.

explain the priority of Night in the Orphic cosmogony as being dependent on the Homeric passage, 16. This was because he
considered that Homer clearly assigned cosmogonical priority to Okeanos and Tethys (9, 10). Damascius here goes counter to Eudemus, and may mean to imply that the Orphic account was to some extent indebted to Homer. 1 But the crux of the matter
19 The theology ascribed to Orpheus in Eudemus the Peripatetic kept silence about the
whole intelligible realm . . . but he made the origin from Night, from whom Homer too (even though he does not describe the succession ofgenerations as continuous) establishes the
beginning of things; for we must not accept it when Eudemus says that Homer beginsfrom Okeanos and Tethys ....
20 In the verses ascribed to Epimenides all things are composedfrom Air and Night; as Homer, also, declared that Okeanos begets the gods from Tethys. . ..
21 In some sources all things are said to come from Night and Tartaros, and in some from Hades and Aither; the author of the Titanomachy says they camefrom Aither, and Acusilaus says that the other things come from Chaos, which was the first; while in the verses ascribed to Musaeus it is written that Tartaros and Night were first.
21



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
is the interpretation of 20 and 21. These passages indicate that
there were poetical accounts, composed probably in the sixth
century B.C., which made Night (in association with Aer or
Tartaros, both conveying the idea of darkness) the origin of the world. If there was an ancient, non-derivative theory of Night as
a genuine cosmogonical figure (as Aristotle in 17 suggests), as opposed to post-Hesiodic learned variants, then these passages are likely to be our surest evidence for it : but only if they themselves appear to be non-Hesiodic in character. This, however, they do
not appear (to the present writer at least) to be. With the exception of 'Afjp in 'Epimenides'2 the cosmic figures involved are all to be
found in the Hesiodic cosmogony proper (24) ; and 'Ar|p, implying
mist and darkness rather than the transparent stuff that we call
'air', is an essential element of the Hesiodic description although it does not happen to achieve personification thus in the second
stage of production, before Night, comes 'misty Tartaros', TApTccpA T
J
fjepoevToc (Theog. 119). When we see from Damascius' reference
to 'Epimenides
5 in 40 that Night and 'Afjp produce Tartaros, it begins to look as though this account is working strictly within the
limits of the Hesiodic prototype. In fact this is not entirely true, because later in 40 an egg is produced a non-Hesiodic and con
ceivably primitive device (see pp. 44-8). Nevertheless, the first stages do not appear to be unaffected by the Hesiodic version; this impression is even stronger with 'Musaeus' 3 and the other accounts mentioned in 21. Tartaros and Night belong to the second and
third stages respectively of the Hesiodic cosmogony; they seemed to share the qualities which were sometimes assigned to Chaos itself, which was therefore suppressed although Acusilaus of
Argos (probably late sixth to early fifth century) retained the genuine Hesiodic order. 4
1 Night is described in the Orphic Rhapsodies (see p. 40) as a figure of great importance, the near-equal and successor of Phanes-Protogonos. So 22 Hermias in Plat.

22 None gazed upon Protogonos ['First-born'] with their eyes, except holy Night alone.
23 (Phanes) placed his famous sceptre in the hands of goddess Nighty so that she might have the prerogative qfrulership.
22



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
According to 33, q.v., Night gave birth to Ouranos and Gaia : this seems
to have been a secondary rebirth of some kind, see p. 40. The detail is not stressed, and in fact Phanes is the real creator-god ; the relation of Night to sky and earth seems to be an incidental refinement. Another Orphic succession (Kern fr. 107) is Chaos-Okeanos-Nyx-Ouranos-Zeus. This, again, may merely imply a rearrangement of Hesiod in the light of Homer.
Chrysippus, who is said to have 'accommodated* to Stoicism ideas ascribed to Orpheus and Musaeus, described Night as the first goddess
(Chrys. ap. Philodemum piet. 13, 16; 14, 18, DK.2BI4).
2 On Epimenides see pp. 44 f. : the hexameter cosmogony and theogony to
which his name was later attached was probably not by him (as Philodemus evidently suspected), but it may nevertheless have originated in the
sixth century B.C. Damascius, too, stated that Aer and Night were Epimenides' first principles, and gave Eudemus as his source for this (40).
Philodemus, therefore, who must also have relied on Eudemus' standard history of theology, provides in 20 an earlier confirmation of Damascius'
reliability.
3 The name of Musaeus, the mythical disciple of Orpheus and eponymous author of oracle-literature, tended to become attached to any kind of
other-worldly verses including, evidently, a theogonical poem like that
assigned to Epimenides. The late sixth century B.C. is a plausible date for such a poem and such an ascription : compare the case of Onomacritus,
who according to Herodotus vn, 6 (DK.2B2O0) was banished from Athens
by Hipparchus when, having been entrusted with the collection and arrange
ment of Musaeus' oracles, he was found to have inserted a spurious one.
4 Acusilaus was a genealogist who might well have given a summary, and of course unoriginal, account of the first ancestors; though some of the material assigned to him was later suspected. According to Damascius
(DKgB i) he made a limited rearrangement of the Hesiodic figures which
came after Chaos; but he is almost entirely irrelevant to the history of early
Greek philosophy, and scarcely deserves the space accorded him in DK.
A new and important consideration may be introduced here. After the episode of the defeat of the Titans in the Theogony comes
a series of passages (726-819) which have been widely recognized as additions to the 'original' text; they are in fact short variant descriptions of the underworld. These variants, or some of them, may of course be no later than the rest of the poem, though not
composed for the place where they are now found. The probability is, however, that most of them were specially composed to 'improve' on the integral references to the underworld. If this is
the case they belong to the later part of the seventh century at the
earliest, while the early sixth century seems a likelier period for
their composition. Now in most of these variants Night is, quite
naturally, given some prominence : see for example 2, where Night surrounds the 'throat' of Tartaros, and above are the roots of the
23



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
earth (in itself probably a genuinely primitive conception). But in 27 (q.v., with discussion on pp. 30 f.) this conception is further developed, and the sources and limits of all things are located in
the great windy gap which is probably a later specification of Chaos in line 1 16 (24) ; the halls of dark night are said to be in or
around this x^M- It is easy to see that this trend of thought could lead to the elevation of Night to be representative of the
original, inchoate state of things. In the original cosmogonical account (24) Night comes at an early and important stage; the tendency to rearrange the Hesiodic figures is already indicated for
the sixth century (probably) ; Homer provided one piece of cryptic encouragement for a further elevation of Night; and added elaborations of the Hesiodic picture of the underworld tended to re
interpret Tartaros and Night as local forms of an originative X6co$. These factors provide motive enough for Aristotle's judgement in 17 ; and there seems to be little indication at present that the idea
of an absolute priority of Night occurred early enough, or in a
sufficiently independent form, to have had any effect on scientific cosmogonical thought. The isolated Homeric reference, 16, cannot be assessed with any certainty : it may be simply a reference to the power of sleep, or it may be derived from a lost myth in which a
personified Night had some special relationship to Zeus.

1 Line 1 18, dOavocTCov 01 x UCJl KcScprj vi96evTos 'OAunirou, is inorganic and quite inappropriate here, and has been omitted. It occurs in the medieval
mss., but is absent from quotations by Plato (Symp. 1783) and ps.Aristotle (MXG i, 975 a 1 1), as well as by Sextus Empiricus and Stobaeus.
Line 1 1 9 was also omitted in these quotations (as, apparently, in the copy
used by Zeno of Gitium: SVFi, 104-5), and a scholiast remarks d0Terroci (' it is marked as spurious J
) ; yet it is quoted in its correct place by Ghalcidius
(in Tim. 122), who omitted 1 18. Plato's continuation of 1 17 by 120 is not
necessarily significant; he was solely interested in Eros, and quoted what
was relevant to Eros and no more. The scholiast's doubt, and post
Platonic omissions, may have originated in Plato's omission; or the line may have been felt to be incongruous, having been added at the time
when the variant descriptions of Hades accrued (p. 23).
2 The list of Titans is completed in the lines that follow; Gaia's subsequent
offspring are patently non-cosmological. At I54ff. comes the story of the mutilation of Kronos (32) . At 2 1 1 ff. there is a reversion to the production
of personified abstractions, e.g. by Night and Strife, but they have no cosmological significance.
The author of the Theogony decided to trace back the ancestry of the gods to the beginning of the world, and 24 is his account of the earliest stages, in which the production of cosmic constituents like
Ouranos (sky) gradually leads to the generation of vague but fully anthropomorphic mythical persons like the Titans. This poetical cosmogony, composed presumably at some time during the seventh
century B.C., was not, however, invented by Hesiod: its occasional
irrationality and reduplication of stages indicate that it is a
and bore after mingling in love with Erebos. And Earth first of all brought forth starry Ouranos [sky], equal to herself, to cover her completely round about, to be a firm seat for the blessed gods for ever. Then she brought forth tall Mountains, lovely haunts of the divine Nymphs who dwell in the woody mountains. She also gave birth to the unharvested
sea, seething with its swell, Pontos, without delightful love; and then having lain with Ouranos she bore deep-eddying Okeanos, and Koios and Krios and Hyperion and
lapetos ....
25



PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
synthesis of at least two earlier variant accounts. For example,
Erebos (which may be of Hittite etymology), although there is some vagueness about it in Homer, must be locally related to the whole complex Gaia-Hades-Tartaros ('Ep^eoxpiv OTTO x9vS at
Theogony 669); yet it is produced a stage later than Gaia and Tartaros. It might be explained as a local differentiation, as Mountains and Sea (Pontos) are produced as local differentiations from Earth; but in that case it should naturally originate from Tartaros or Gaia and not from Chaos. It is grouped with Night, no doubt, because it shares a major characteristic (darkness), as
Aither is grouped with Day. Generation is of opposites (e.g. of Aither and Day by Erebos whose neuter gender does not inhibit
parental activities and Night), or of similars (Erebos and Night
from Chaos, see p. 31), or of local differentiations. Some births,
however, cannot be explained on any of these principles notably that of Ouranos from Gaia. Again, there is inconsistency over the
method of production. Eros is produced at the first stage of
differentiation, presumably to provide an anthropomorphic, sexual explanation of subsequent differentiation. It is not, however, consistently used. Gaia produces Pontos 'without love' at 132; Night mates with Erebos at 125 but produces again 'without
sleeping with anyone' at 213; Chaos at 123, and Gaia again at 126, produce independently though Love is already in existence. Immediately after producing Pontos independently at 132, Gaia produces the more fully personalized Okeanos by mating with her son and consort Ouranos. 1
1 In view of his cosmological importance as the surrounding river (2) one would expect Okeanos to occur earlier, rather than later, than Pontos,
which can properly be regarded as a detail of the earth. The production of Okeanos by Gaia and Ouranos may have a rationalistic motive, since the
surrounding stream forms the point of contact between earth and the
enclosing bowl of sky.
* First of all Chaos came-to-be': the primacy of Chaos is remarkable, and a careful enquiry must be made into what Hesiod
is likely to have meant by Xcxos here. Three interpretations may be
rejected immediately: (i) Aristotle (Phys. Ai, 208 b 29) took it to
mean space. But this concept is much later than the Theogony,
occurring first, probably, in Pythagoras, then more clearly in Zeno of Elea, and most clearly in Plato's Timaeus. (ii) The Stoics followed Zeno of Citium (e.g. SVFi9 103), who perhaps took the
26



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
idea from Pherecydes of Syros (DKys i a), in deriving x&os from X^odai and therefore interpreting it as what is poured, i.e. water.
(iii) The common modern sense of chaos as disorder can be seen e.g. in Lucian Amores 32, where Hesiod's x<fo$ is interpreted as
disordered, shapeless matter. This, again, may be Stoic in origin.
The noun is derived from Vxa> meaning 'gape, gap, yawn', as
in x<*iveiv, X^ *6117? etc - Of the certain uses of the word before
400 B.C., one group simply refers to the cosmogonic Xoco$ of this
passage (so Acusilaus in 21, Aristophanes Birds 693, Clouds 627); the other group has the special meaning 'air', in the sense of the
region between sky and earth, the region in which birds fly (so
Bacchylides 5, 27, Euripides fr. 448 (Nauck2
), Aristophanes
Clouds 424, Birds 1218). One may suspect that Bacchylides' poetical and perhaps original use of the highly individual phrase ev ocTpOTcp x&ei (as that in which the eagle flies the free air, as
opposed to earth or sea) was consciously imitated by Euripides and Aristophanes, either lyrically (Birds 1218) or as a convenient though not necessarily serious interpretation to be placed on the cosmogonical chaos of Hesiod. The evidence, then, does not point to an extensive use of X&S as the space between sky and earth,
though such a use was certainly known. Here we must consider another instance of the word in the Theogony itself (in an episode
which is possibly an expansion or addition, but which, even so, can hardly be later in date than the early sixth century) :

27



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
There has been dispute about which region of the world is represented by XAos in line 700. Either (a) it represents the whole or
part of the underworld: there is a parallel for this usage at
Theogony 814 (28), in one of the added variants (see pp. 23 f.); or (b) it represents the region between earth and aither. But (a) would be difficult: why should the ^/penetrate to the underworld (the concussion of missiles does so at 68 1 ff., but that is natural and effective) ? The Titans are not in the underworld, but on Mount Othrys (632); we have been told that the flash reaches the
upper air, and it is relevant to add that the heat, also, filled
the whole intermediate region. The following lines imagine earth
and sky as clashing together again, the emphasis is certainly
not on the underworld. An objective judge would surely conclude that Xdos at line 700 describes the region between earth
and sky. In view of the basic meaning of x<*S (as a gap, i.e. a bounded
interval, not ' void ' or anything like that), 1 and of one certain fifth
century usage as the region between sky and earth, and of another use of the word in the Theogony in which the meaning is probably the same, serious attention must be paid to an interpretation pro
pounded most notably by Cornford (e.g. Principium Sapientiae i94f.), that Xdos yeveT* in the first line of 24 implies that the gap between earth and sky came into being; that is, that the first stage of cosmogony was the separation of earth and sky. This would not be consistent with one existing and indubitable feature of the cosmogony, the postponement of the birth of Ouranos until a second
stage, at lines i26f. (Production from Chaos, lines i23ff., and
from Gaia, i26ff., may take place simultaneously.) Apart from this peculiarity, the other conditions fit the proposed interpretation: earth, with its appendage Tartaros, appears directly the gap is made; so does Eros, which in its most concrete form as
rain/semen exists between sky and earth according to poetical references.2 It seems not improbable that in the Hesiodic scheme the explicit description of the formation of Ouranos has been delayed through the confused use of two separate accounts (a confusion which can be paralleled from other details of the scheme),
and that it is implied in line 1 1 6 at the very first stage of cosmogony .
The separation of sky and earth is certainly reduplicated in the Theogony, in a fully mythopoeic form, in the story of the mutilation of Kronos (32) ; though reduplication of accounts of a different
28



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
logical character (quasi-rationalistic and mythopoeic) is easier to
accept than reduplication on the same, quasi-rationalistic level.
1 A comparison has often been drawn between X^S and ginnunga-gap in the Nordic cosmogony. This gap (which, however, preceded the creation
of the giant from whom earth and sky were made) has been taken to imply simply an indefinite empty space: but it is important to observe that in Snorri's schematization it is conceived as being terminated by the realm of ice (Niflheim) to the north and that of fire (Muspellsheiw) to the south. This certainly does not invalidate the supposition that x^$ implies
primarily a region of vast size, but secondarily and implicitly its boundaries.

This idea of the rain actually fertilizing the earth may be of great antiquity.
Cornford's interpretation may be helped by the verb used to describe the first stage of cosmogony : not fjv but yevsT*, perhaps implying that Xocos was not the eternal precondition of a differen
tiated world, but a modification of that precondition. (It is out of
the question that Hesiod or his source was thinking ofthe originative
substance as coming into being out of nothing.) The conception that earth and sky were originally one mass may have been so
common (sec pp. 32-4) that Hesiod could take it for granted, and begin his account of world-formation at the first stage of differen
tiation. This would be, undoubtedly, a cryptic and laconic pro
cedure; and it seems probable that something more complicated was meant by Xoco$ yeveT* than, simply,
c
sky and earth separated
'
though I am inclined to accept that this was originally implicit
in the phrase. The nature of the gap between sky and earth, after
their first separation, may well have been somehow specified in the popular traditions on which Hesiod was presumably drawing.
There was, conceivably, an attempt to imagine what would be the
appearance of things when there was simply dark sky, and earth,
and the gap between. Here we must turn for assistance to two of
the variants (see p. 23) on the description of the underworld, appended to the Titanomachy in the Theogony.
26 Holy sky passionately longs to penetrate the earth, and desire takes hold of earth to achieve this union. Rain from her bedfellow sky falls and impregnates earth, and she brings forth for mortals pasturage for flocks and Demeter's livelihood.

Of these, 27 is evidently an attempt to improve 726-8 (2), where Tartaros (perhaps its upper part) is said to be surrounded by Night, and above it are the roots of earth and sea. In irdpocT' there is a more exact reversion to the apparent source of 2, i.e. //. 8,

FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
careless or stupid; for example, it is difficult to be favourably
impressed by the alteration of the reasonable idea that the roots of the earth are above Tartaros to the idea that the c sources and boundaries* of earth, sea, sky and Tartaros are in Tartaros (27).
What is interesting is the further description of Tartaros as a
X<tenoc ny', a great gulf or chasm (cf. Euripides Phoen. 1605), fu^ of storms and containing the halls of Night. In 28 this gulf is described as ' gloomy Chaos ' (we need not concern ourselves with
its peculiar geography, except to note that Chaos is not absolutely unbounded). This must contain a reference to the initial XAos of line 1 1 6 (24), and it seems reasonable to suppose that the authors
of these two additions understood the initial Xocos to be dark and
windy, like Tartaros. This interpretation gains some support from the fact that in the original cosmogonical account Erebos and
Night (both, presumably, gloomy) are produced from Chaos at the stage after the production of Gaia, Tartaros and Eros.
The evidence seems to point to the following conclusion. For
Hesiod's source, at all events, the first stage in the formation of a
differentiated world was the production of a vast gap between sky and earth. By Hesiod the emphasis is placed on the nature of the
gap itself, not on the act of separation which produced it. The gap is conceived as dark and windy dark, because aither and sun had not yet come into being, and windy, because this is the natural condition of the region (as can be perceived when one is away from
shelter, e.g. on a high hillside). The same kind of description is
applied, quite naturally, to the lightless gulfs of Tartaros; and in additions to the original poem Tartaros is considered in terms of,
or actually as a part of, the original gap. 1
1 G. Vlastos (Gnomon 27 (1955) 74~5) finds 27 significant for the origin of HesiocTs cosmogonical XcScos, and even suggests that it was from here that Anaximander got the idea of TO direipov. U. Holscher, too (Hermes 81
(1953) 391-401), has completely rejected the Gornford interpretation, and
takes Xdos to be a dark and boundless waste. He supports this by the assumption that a cosmogony, attributed to Sanchuniathon (a Phoenician said to have lived before the Trojan war) by Philo of Byblus ap. Eusebium
P.E. i, 10, is really of great antiquity, much older than Hesiod. According to the summary in Eusebius the first state of things was gloomy, boundless
air and wind (x&os 0oAep6v, pe(3co8es is one of its descriptions) . When this
'passionately desired its own ApxotC (whatever that may mean) there was
intermixture. Mot (some kind of slime) was produced, and became the
sowing of creation. Now it is true that the discoveries at Ras Shamra and elsewhere have shown (a) that some motifs in Greek mythology originated

PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
long before Homer and Hesiod, and outside Greece; (b) that Phoenicia
had its own versions of myths about the early history of the gods, in the second millennium B.C., and was a meeting-place of cultures. It is also
true that in the theogony attributed to Sanchuniathon, after the cosmo
gonical summary, there is one detail (a deity, Eliun, in the generation before Ouranos) which does not correspond with Hesiod and does correspond with the cognate Hittite account of the 2nd millennium (see
pp. 36 f.). But this may be a detail of the genuine and ancient local cosmogonical tradition, which could be incorporated at any date: it does not prove that every part of the whole farrago assigned to Sanchuniathon (Hermes Trismegistus and all) has any claim to incorporate ancient
material. In particular, it does not even begin to suggest that the cosmo gonical account is anything but what it appears to be, i.e. a Hellenistic eclectic pastiche of Hesiod and later cosmogonical sources (there is a
possible mention of an egg) . To use it as a means of interpreting Xdo$ in the Theogony, and of showing that the idea of an originative windy darkness was already established for Hesiod to assimilate, must be considered interesting rather than scientific.

1 The cosmogony and anthropogony in this first book of Diodorus (who,
shortly after this passage, quoted 29) were ascribed by Diels to Democritus. There is no mention of atoms, as Cornford noted ; but some details of later stages may nevertheless come from the Mixp6s 8idKoa|K>s (p. 403
and n.). The development of society is similar to that described by
Protagoras in the Platonic dialogue. The whole account is eclectic, but its
main features are of fifth-century origin and predominantly Ionian character; as such it may well embody traditional cosmogonical ideas. 2 Orpheus is the singer. The cosmogony has nothing in common with special 'Orphic' accounts (5): Apollonius would naturally put into
Orpheus' mouth the most primitive-sounding version that he knew.
It has been suggested above that the implied, although not emphasized, first stage of the Hesiodic cosmogony was the separation of sky and earth. That this idea was familiar enough in Greece
is shown by 29-31. Only 29, admittedly, is even as early as the
fifth century ; but it is particularly important as explicitly describing the separation of sky and earth as being passed on from mother to
child, i.e. as a popular and traditional account. No scientific
parallel is known; though the idea may have been merged with
specialized Ionian theories as in 30 and its continuation.
SEPARATION IN NON-GREEK SOURCES
The splitting of earth from sky is a cosmogonical mechanism that was widely used, long before the earliest known Greek cosmo
gonical ideas, in the mythological accounts ofthe great near-eastern
cultures. (It is in fact common to many different cultures : cf., most
notably, the Maori myth of the separation of Rangi (sky) and Papa (earth) by their constricted offspring, a close parallel to 32.) Thus a gloss from the end of the first millennium B.C. on the
Egyptian Book of the Dead explains that c Re began to appear as
a king, as one who was before the liftings of Shu had taken place, when he was on the hill which is in Hermopolis' (ANET 4). Shu
is the air-god which is sputtered out by Re and lifts the sky-goddess, Nut, from the earth-god, Keb. In the Hurrian-Hittite 'Song of
Ullikummi' (ANET 125; Gurney, The Hittites, 190-4) Upelluri,

a counterpart of Atlas, says: 'When heaven and earth were built
upon me I knew nothing of it, and when they came and cut
heaven and earth asunder with a cleaver I knew nothing of it.' In
the Babylonian Creation-epic (iv, isyff.; ANET 67) Marduk splits the body of the primeval water-goddess Tiamat and makes one half of it into sky (containing the celestial waters) and the other half into Apsu, the deep, and Esharra, the '
great abode' or firmament of earth. This is the first stage in the composition of the
world as we know it, though a secondary stage in the far older
history of the Babylonian pantheon. In another, later Semitic version, Genesis i, the primeval waters are similarly divided: 'And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters. And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. 5
(Gen. i, 6-8.) *
1 The opening words of the first chapter of Genesis, ' In the beginning God
created the heaven and the earth. And the earth was without form, and void ', are a confusing anticipation of what is to follow. The initial state is boundless, dark water; the first stage of differentiation is the separation of
the waters into those of the sky and those of the earth. The anticipation in the initial summary provides a parallel for the reduplication involved in the Hesiodic cosmogony (p. 28).
The separation of sky and earth was implied, therefore, in various non-Greek mythological accounts older than Hesiod. It will be seen in the next section that Hesiod's description of the earliest generations of gods is a version of a basic near-eastern myth, which is also reproduced in an extant Hurrian-Hittite form.
There is nothing surprising, therefore, in the separation-motif
appearing in Hesiod whether implicitly in the quasi-rationalistic XAos yvT* of the formal cosmogony, or more explicitly, but in
fully mythopoeic guise, in the mutilation-story now to be considered.

The details of the present version suggest that Ouranos did separate from Gaia, in the daytime at least : but why in this case could not
Gaia emit her offspring during his absence? It is probable that in other versions of the story Ouranos covered Gaia continuously (as Rangi covers Papa in the Maori myth), so that in a manner of speaking 'sky and earth were one form'.

event that has already been accounted for in a quasi-rationalistic and much more sophisticated summary is seen in Genesis: the abstract Elohim of the
first chapter is replaced by the fully anthropomorphic and much cruder
being he hid them all away and did not let them into the light, in the inward places of
Gaia; and Ouranos rejoiced over the evil deed. And she, prodigious Gaia, groaned within, for she was crowded out; and she contrived a crafty, evil device . . . she sent him [Kronos']
into a hidden place of ambush, placed in his hands a jagged-toothed sickle, and enjoined on him the whole deceit. Great Ouranos came bringing Night with him, and over Gaia,
desiring love, he stretched himself, and spread all over her; and he, his son, from his place of ambush stretched out with his left hand, and with his right he grasped the monstrous
sickle, long andjagged-toothed, and swiftly sheared off the genitals of his dear father, and flung them behind him to be canted away ....

Jahweh of the second, and the vague ' God created man in his own image ' of
chapter i is repeated in a far more graphic and more primitive form in the
second chapter, where Jahweh creates man out of dust and breathes life
into his nostrils. (For man formed from clay cf. e.g. the Old Babylonian text ANETgq col. b, as well as the Greek Prometheus-myth.)
That some of the contents of the Theogony are of non-Greek origin and of a date far earlier than Hesiod's immediate predecessors is most strikingly shown by the parallelism between the Hesiodic account of the succession of oldest gods and the Hittite
Kumarbi-tablet, of Hurrian origin and in its extant form dating from around the middle of the second millennium B.C. 1 In the
Hittite version the first king in heaven is Alalu, who is driven out
by the sky-god Anu (same root as Greek ouranos) ; Anu is deposed by the father of the developed gods, Kumarbi (equivalent to
Kronos 'father of the gods'). As Anu tries to escape into the sky
Kumarbi bites off, and swallows, his member. On being told that he has become impregnated with the storm-god and two other
'terrible gods', Kumarbi spits out the member, which impregnates the earth with the two other gods ; Kumarbi cannot, however, rid himself of the storm-god, and eventually gives birth to him. With
the help of Anu, it is evident, the storm-god (to whom the Greek
equivalent is obviously the thunder-and-lightning god Zeus) deposes Kumarbi and becomes king in heaven. The similarities to the Greek myth are obvious : the succession sky-god, father of
gods, storm-god is common to each; so is the emasculation of the
sky-god by Kumarbi/Kronos, and the impregnation of earth by the rejected member. There are, of course, significant differences too: the Hittite version (like other near-eastern accounts) has a
god, Alalu, before the sky-god; what Kronos swallows is a stone (by
mistake for the storm-god, Theog. 468 ff.) ; and it is Rhea, not he, that bears the storm-god Zeus. It is thought that in the broken part of the Hittite tablet there may have been some reference to Kumarbi eating a stone, but this is uncertain. It should be noted
that in Hesiod, also, the sky-god (with Gaia) helps the storm-god to survive. The Hittite version carries no implication that the emasculation of the sky-god was concerned with the separation of
sky from earth; indeed, no earth-goddess is involved. This is an
important difference, but it suggests, not that the Greek separationmotive had no 2nd-millennium archetype, but that the Greek version incorporates variants which do not happen to be found in
36



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
the Hittite account. The Greek version was not derived specifically
from the Hittite, of course : there was a widely diffused common account, with many local variants, of which the Hittite tablet gives one version and Hesiod another a version, moreover, which had suffered the vicissitudes of transmission to a younger
and very different culture.
1 For the Kumarbi-tablet see ANET 120-1, Gurney, The Hittites, 190-2; R. D. Barnett, JHS 65 (1945) ioof.; H. G. Guterbock, Kumarbi (Zurich 1946), 100 ff.; 474 52 (1948) 23ff. The'Songof Ullikummi' (see pp. ssf.)
records, on separate tablets, the further doings of Kumarbi while he is king in heaven ; that sky and earth had been separated is plainly implied there.
5. ORPHIC COSMOGONIES
Several variations in cosmogony were ascribed to *Op9iKol,
'Orphics'. These might be described as people who, uniting elements from the cult of Apollo on the one hand (as KccOApaios, the purifier) and from Thracian reincarnation beliefs on the other, thought that the soul could survive if it were kept pure, and elaborated a partly individual mythology, with Dionysus as a
central figure, to illustrate this theory. The Thracian Orpheus,
with his sexual purity, his musical powers, and his power of
prophecy after death, represented the combination of the two elements. Orphic beliefs were recorded in sacred accounts, lepol
Aoyou Now this description would certainly be true, say, of the third
century B.C.; but there has been much controversy about how early there appeared a distinct class of people with well-defined
and individual beliefs of this kind. W. K. C. Guthrie has a sober
discussion of the subject in chapter xi of The Greeks and their Gods
(London, 1950) : his view, which has many supporters, is that the Orphic doctrine was already set out in sacred books in the sixth
century B.C. I. M. Linforth, however, in The Arts of Orpheus (Berkeley, 1941), analysed all the extant texts mentioning Orpheus and Orphics, and showed that, at any rate until 300 B.C., the
description
c Orphic ' was applied to all sorts of ideas connected
with practically every kind of rite (TeAeTf)). There were writings attributed to Orpheus, as indeed to Musaeus and Epimenides (see
pp. 2 iff.), as early as the sixth century B.C.; Herodotus knew of
Orphics and Pythagoreans sharing a taboo in the fifth; Orphic oracle- and dispensation-mongers were familiar to Plato, and e so
37



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
called Orphic accounts' to Aristotle. But the corpus of individual
sectarian literature (of which descriptions of Hades, accounts of
theogony and cosmogony, hymns, etc., are known to us) cannot for the most part be traced back earlier than the Hellenistic period,
and in its present form mostly belongs to the Roman period. The inscribed metal sheets from graves in Magna Graecia and Crete, with instructions of an Orphic character for the soul of the dead man, again do not antedate the Hellenistic period. The conclusion to be drawn from the available evidence seems to the present writer to be, as Linforth held, that there was no exclusively Orphic body of belief in the archaic period. However, Orpheus was then
beginning to be treated as the patron saint of rites and ritual ways
of life; and his name, like that of his legendary disciple Musaeus, became attached to theogonical literature of this period. Beliefs about reincarnation were becoming current in the Greek world, particularly in the west, and some adherents of these beliefs were
calling themselves 'Op9iKoi by the fifth century. The formation of an exclusive sect with a definite body of relevant sacred literature
came later.
In the present context, however, it is not necessary to try to establish a hypothesis on the Orphic question in general. The problem is primarily whether the cosmogonical ideas ascribed to the
Orphics could have affected, or did affect, the development of philosophical thought in the sixth and fifth centuries.
Some elements of Orphic cosmogony were obviously derived from the Hesiodic Theogony, which influenced nearly all sub
sequent mythological thought on the subject. Thus both Chaos and Night will be seen to have had considerable importance in Orphic contexts. These elements passed through the medium of late archaic accounts like those of 'Epimenides', 'Musaeus 5 and Acusilaus (p. 23 nn. 2-4), and became gradually embedded in an individual Orphic mythological complex. Other elements are almost certainly later in origin, and in some cases show awareness of the details of oriental cult and iconography. 1 (This is a case of
a learned adaptation of specific foreign information, not of the quite distinct process of the gradual assimilation of a widely
diffused general idea.) There are many scholars, however (includ
ing e.g. Gruppe, Mazon, Nestle), who have nevertheless followed
an ancient tendency to regard all beliefs described as 'Orphic',
including these cosmogonical beliefs, as of great antiquity. The
38



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
evidence set out below should demonstrate the subjective nature of any such tendency. The one unusual idea is that of the egg as a
secondary theogonical mechanism,
1 Most conspicuously, Time, Xp6vo$, as a primary cosmogonical figure may derive from the Iranian hypostatization %pran Akarana (unending time). But this Iranian concept finds its earliest testimony in a late 4th
century B.C. Greek reference, by Eudemus as reported in Chalcidius, and there is no reason to think that it was formulated as early as the Greek archaic period. ' Time ' is a sophisticated cosmogonical concept in Plato's Timaeus', it was also personified, probably as an etymology of Kronos, by Pherecydes of Syros as early as the sixth century, though probably not with a profound abstract significance (see n. i on p. 46 and n. i on p. 56). Its oriental derivation in the Orphic accounts is indicated by its concrete shape as a multi-headed winged snake. Such multipartite monsters, as distinct from simpler fantasies like centaurs and perhaps gorgons, are orientalizing in character, mainly Semitic in origin, and begin to appear in Greek art around 700 B.C. They were, of course, extremely popular as
decoration during the seventh and the first quarter of the sixth centuries. (Minoan art, too, had had its monsters, mainly dog-headed deities and
other relatively simple theriomorphic creations.) That the winged-snake
form of Time is much later, in its Greek appearances, than the Orientalizing period in art is chiefly suggested by the identification of an abstraction with such a form. This shows an acquaintance with rather complex
oriental (especially Assyrian or Babylonian) modes of thought something very different from the mere borrowing of a pictorial motif, or even the assimilation of a fully concrete myth-form. Such extravagances of the imagination evoked little sympathy in the Greek mind before the Hellenistic
period. (It should be added, however, that some scholars see no objection to taking the winged-snake Chronos as archaic in date.)
NEOPLATONIST ACCOUNTS OF ORPHIC COSMOGONIES
The later Neoplatonists (fourth to sixth centuries A.D.), and in
particular Damascius, with their long schematic allegorizations of earlier mythological accounts, are the main source for Orphic versions of the formation of the world. These writers are more reliable than appears at first sight, since much of their information was derived from summaries of Eudemus' great Peripatetic
history of theology. In some cases fragments of late Orphic poetry can be adduced to confirm details of the Neoplatonic descriptions, which are tiresomely diffuse (and are therefore schematized in (ii)
and (iii) below) and are expressed in the peculiar terminology of that school. Four different accounts of a cosmogony specifically named as Orphic are extant.
39



PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
(i) Derivation from Night Damascius in 19 (q.v.) stated that according to Eudemus 'the
theology ascribed to Orpheus . . . made the origin of things from
Night'. According to the Rhapsodies, 1 Night was the daughter of Phanes (see n. i on p. 22 and n. 3 on p. 41), himself descended
from Chronos. She was given prophetic powers by Phanes, succeeded him as ruler, and seems somehow to have given birth for a second time to Gaia and Ouranos.2 The secondary and
repetitive nature of this production of sky and earth, and the obvious intention to make Phanes the ultimate creator of the world,
suggest that Night's cosmogonical priority (as distinct from her undoubted position as a venerable figure among the gods) is here mainly the result of the derivative and syncretistic character of the
Orphic theogony. Eudemus' judgement, however, is independent of these later developments, and must clearly be assessed in the light of Aristotle's references (17) to writers about the gods who
generated from Night. On pp. 20 and 24 it is concluded that these references are to sixth-century adaptations and elaborations of the Hesiodic Theogony, and that no earlier, autonomous doctrine is
implied. Two such elaborations are ascribed to Epimenides and Musaeus in 20 and 21 ; it was inevitable that similar systems should be associated also with Orpheus, if not in the sixth century B.C.,
then in the fifth or fourth. It appears probable that it was to this
kind of derivative theogony that Eudemus referred.
1 The so-called Orphic Rhapsodies (tepoi A6yoi eV fbocycpSfais K6 according to the Suda s.v. 'Op9\>s), of which many fragments survive (Kern, frr. 59-235), mostly through quotation in Neoplatonist works, are a late
compilation of hexameter verses of varying date of composition. None of
them are certainly pre-Hcllenistic and most are probably much later.
Their name indicates their heterogeneous origin; it is significant that no author before the full Christian period seems to have heard of these verses, and it seems highly probable that their elaboration into an Orphic Iliad was not taken in hand until the third or fourth century A.D. Genuinely archaic beliefs might, of course, be embedded in some of these verses, late as they are in composition and collection.

But Phanes had already created Olympus, sun, moon and earth (frr. 89, 96, 91-3, 94 Kern, from the Rhapsodies), and sky is also presupposed.

manifest, from being unseen, and who they are by birth.

Of these four types of Orphic-denominated cosmogony, (i) mentions a first stage, Night, that does not occur in the others. Night's
importance in the Orphic pantheon probably depended, directly or indirectly, on modifications to the archetypal Hesiodic cosmogony and theogony. Eudemus may have known Orphic accounts similar to the earlier versions associated with Epimenides and
Musaeus. Much later, in one part of the heterogeneous Rhap
sodies, Night was given a specific cosmogonical function as a secondary parent of Ouranos and Gaia. This detail may be in
directly developed from archaic cosmogonical motifs, but it cannot be considered strong evidence for an archaic Orphic cosmogonical Nyx. (ii) is termed the usual Orphic account presumably because
it more or less corresponded with the broad picture given in the
late Rhapsodies, (iii) is an elaboration of (ii). It cannot, as it
stands, be pre-Hellenistic : its fantastic concrete description of the abstract Chronos is a sign of late origin, or at least of late re
modelling. (iv) is quoted by a second-century Christian apologist
of Neoplatonic leanings; it gives one significant detail, the splitting of the egg to form sky and earth, which is completely absent from
the later Neoplatonic accounts, (iii) and (iv) have a first stage, slime in one form or another, which is no doubt an eclectic
philosophical-physical intrusion. It might conceivably be taken
directly from Ionian systems like that of Anaximander, but is much more likely to have come from derivative Stoic cosmogony.

39 was written in 414 B.C. or shortly before. 40 lays claim to a still
earlier date, but Philodemus in 20 evidently suspected the authenticity of the attribution of this verse theogony to Epimenides. There
was considerable doubt about Epimenides5 historical position,
39 First of all was Chaos and Night and black Erebos and wide Tartar'os, and neither Ge nor Aer nor Ouranos existed; in the boundless bosoms of Erebos black-winged Night
begets, first, a wind-egg, from which in thefulfilment of the seasons ardent Eros burgeoned forth, his back gleaming with golden wings as he yielded to the whirling winds. Eros, mingling with winged, gloomy Chaos in broad Tartaros, hatched out our race and first brought it into the light. There was no race of immortals before Eros mingled all things together; but as one mingled with another Ouranos came into being, and Okeanos and Ge and the unfading race of all the blessed gods. Thus we are by far the oldest of all the blessed ones.
40 Epimenides posited two first principles, Air and Night. . .from which Tartaros was produced. . .from all of which two Titans were produced . . .from whose mutual mingling an egg came into being. . .from which, again, other offspring came forth.

even in the fourth century B.C. : according to Plato he was active
around 500 B.C., but Aristotle and the later tradition put him a
century earlier (DK 3 A 1-5) . His name became a focus for magical
and mystical anecdotes, and cosmogonical views might well have
been expected of him. The only thing we can say with certainty about the date of 40 is that it is pre-Eudcmian; but in view of the
proliferation of mythological accounts in hexameters, concerned with genealogy and therefore liable to begin with a theogony,
probably towards the end of the sixth century B.C., its content might be tentatively dated between then and the middle of the
fifth century (see also nn. 13 on pp. 22 f.). Thus an egg as an element in cosmogony, which is a typical feature of later Orphic accounts as recorded in the Neoplatonist tradition, is mentioned
certainly near the end of the fifth century and probably before that. Were these earlier accounts specifically Orphic in character? There are no necessarily significant differences in the manner of
production of the egg in the earlier and in the later (definitely Orphic) accounts. In the latter, Chronos (in a late and bizarre form) begets the egg in Aither or in Aither-Chaos-Erebos (36, 37).
In 39 Night produces the egg in Erebos ; in 40 it is begotten by two
Titans presumably Kronos (cf. 53?) and Rhea who are themselves the product of Air-Night and Tartaros. There is no mention
of Chronos, of course, but Pherccydes of Syros (pp. 58 f.) had probably already associated Kronos with Chronos, and there may be a connexion here with the later accounts: 1 see also 53 and
discussion. There is a distinct similarity between what is produced from the egg in the birds' account and in the later Orphic ver
sions : golden-winged Eros is an obvious prototype of the Orphic Phanes.2 Yet most of Aristophanes' bird-cosmogony is indubitably derived from the Hesiodic Theogony, with appropriate modifications.3 Chaos, Night, Erebos and Tartaros are involved in the first
stages of both accounts ; only Earth is postponed in Aristophanes, to be produced (in some ways more logically) simultaneously with Sky. The egg is a c
wind-egg', of course, partly to make it more bird-like, partly because of the traditional windiness of Tartaros
(27). So Night, Chaos and Eros are all winged, because this
is meant to be a birds' cosmogony. It is a parody of a traditional
type of cosmogony; yet the original of a parody must be recognizable, and while the Hesiodic elements are clear enough the egg is
non-Hesiodic. Eminently suited to bird-generation as it is, the
45



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
device is unlikely to have been invented by Aristophanes for that reason. It must have been familiar as a means for producing, not
necessarily a cosmogonical figure, but at least an important deity like Eros. Possibly the birth of Helen from an egg is significant here: connected with a tree-cult perhaps of Mycenean origin
(M. Nilsson, Gesch. d. griech. Religion i, 21 1 and 315), she is a ward
and representative of Aphrodite-Eros in Homer. 1 The Kronos-Chronos identification was also made in Orphic circles : cf. e.g. Proclus in Plat. Crat. 3963 (Kern fr. 68). This does not imply that Pherecydes was an Orphic, or took his ideas from early Orphic sources (though the Suda reports, probably on account of these similarities, that he 'collected Orpheus' writings'); rather it implies that the later Orphic eclectics used Pherecydes for source-material just as they used Hesiod and other early mythological writings. a The language of the Rhapsodic account is indeed strongly reminiscent of Aristophanes : compare xPuo> ^aiS TnrepOyeoxn 9opeOnevos v0cc Keel v0cc (sc. OAvris),
' Phanes ... borne here and there by golden wings' (fr. 78 Kern), with line 697 of 39. IvOcc Keel IvOcc in the Orphic verse, as in 35,
recalls Hesiod Theogony 742 (27), part of the description of windy Tartarus; Hesiod is the chief linguistic and formal model for the Rhapsodies.
3 So also in 40 the first stage, Aer and Night, is evolved from Hesiod : see p. 17. Philodemus in 20 did not mention the egg in Epimenides.
TENTATIVE CONCLUSIONS
The evidence is too sparse to lead to a final decision whether there
existed specifically Orphic cosmogonical accounts early enough to have affected Presocratic ideas. Yet it seems probable that dis
tinctively Orphic versions are not particularly early earlier, say, than the fourth century B.C. ; though the name of Orpheus, like that of Musaeus or Epimenides, may have been attached to fifth- or
sixth-century thcogonies. The ideas inherent in extant reports are eclectic in origin (Hesiod and the developments of Hesiod being the chief source), but in their present formulation are Hellenistic
at the earliest. The one conceivably early characteristic is the use of an egg formed in Erebos or Aither, from which comes a deity
who arranges the later stages of cosmic evolution. This device
occurs in an Aristophanic parody, also in a very vague summary of verses ascribed to Epimenides and perhaps not later than the first
half of the fifth century. Yet there is no reason for considering the
device specifically Orphic, simply because it occurs in later Orphic accounts which are demonstrably eclectic. Once the metaphor of
animal generation had been applied to cosmogony, as it certainly was by the time of Hesiod, the egg became a plausible genetic



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
device. It is surprising, indeed, that we do not hear more of it in early Greek contexts: Nilsson (Gesch. i, 648) noted that the cosmic
egg is a common feature in naive mythology in many parts of the world (though it does not, as it happens, occur in near-eastern
contexts except occasionally in Egypt and dubiously in c Sanchuniathon'). It could nevertheless have existed in Greece from quite early times as a folk-lore concept, which was excluded from many formal accounts because of its naive quality and finds its only
analogue in a tendency to treat the developing world embryonically. 'Epimenides' was attempting, without many natural advantages, to improve on Hesiod, and might well have welcomed the device just because it was not Hesiodic; while Aristophanes
found it obviously appropriate for a comic bird-cosmogony. The later Orphism did not shun orientalizing novelties like the
description of Time as a winged monster, and would certainly have no inhibitions about the egg-motif. There is a serious possi
bility that Aristophanes, far from depending on a hypothetical early Orphic tradition, was himself used as a source by the founders
of a special Orphic literature.
One reason for doubting an early Orphic use of the egg-motif has been generally overlooked. If there were any such early use, one would expect later applications to be consistent with an earlier tradition, which in a sacred-book sect would be regarded
as sacrosanct. Yet three quite different later uses are known. First,
the egg simply produces Phanes (34, 37). Secondly, in 38 the upper part of the egg forms the sky, the lower part the earth; the
equivalent of Phanes emerges too, and sky and earth then mate as
in Hesiod or the popular tradition. The same interpretation is out
lined in Apion (early first century A.D.) ap. ps.-Clement Horn, vi (Kern fr. 56). Here the egg has a true cosmogonical function
which can be paralleled from non-Greek myths. Thirdly, according to one extant source the Orphics used the arrangement of shell
and skin (and presumably also of white and yolk) as an analogue for
the arrangement of sky (outer heaven), aither and so on:

This is, admittedly, a simile and not a cosmogonical device; it might be argued, also, that the formation of sky and earth from
parts of the egg was just overlooked by the later Neoplatonists. Nevertheless it seems probable that there was considerable diver
gence in the use of the egg-motif, and that this divergence implies that no specific ancient Orphic tradition had been preserved.
However, this special argument is less important than the general ones, from the eclectic nature of organized Orphism, which have already been adduced.
Thus this inevitably complex survey reaches the negative conclusion that there was probably no such thing as Orphic cosmogony either before or during the Presocratic period. It has, however, revealed birth from an egg as an archaic theogonical, not cosmo
gonical, device (one which perhaps played some part in Pherecydes too, see p. 59). The regular Orphic accounts kept this theogonical
function; although one probably late variant made the egg truly cosmogonical, as the actual material of the cosmos.
6. PHEREGYDES OF SYROS
This Pherecydes was a mythographer and theogonist, and must be
distinguished from the fifth-century Athenian genealogist of the same name, also from a later and less important Lerian. 1 Accord
ing to Aristotle he was not entirely mythological in his approach :

1 F. Jacoby, Mnemosyne 13 (3rd series), 1947, 138*., has finally discredited
Wilamowitz's theory that ' Pherecydes ' was a generic name attached to all
early Ionian prose writing not specifically ascribed, as 'Hippocrates'
became attached to all medical literature. The man of Syros and the Athenian were indeed carefully distinguished in many ancient sources, though not in all.

DATE
Pherecydes was active in the sixth century B.C., perhaps around the middle of it. Ancient authorities diverge : according to one
tradition he was roughly contemporary with the Lydian king Alyattes (c. 605-5603.0.) and the Seven Sages (conventionally dated around Thales' eclipse, 585/4, or the archonship of Damasias, 582/1) ; according to another, dependent on Apollodorus, his acme was in the 5gth Olympiad, 544-541 B.C., and he was a contem
porary of Cyrus. 1 The Apollodoran dating thus makes him a generation younger than Thales and a younger contemporary of Anaximander. It fits in with the later Pythagorean tradition
which made Pythagoras bury Pherecydes (p. 51), though this event was itself probably fictitious. None of these chronological traditions looks particularly historical, and we know that such
synchronisms were assigned by the Hellenistic chronographers
largely on a priori grounds. Yet interest in Pherecydes was certainly alive in the fourth century B.C. (a crucial era for the transmission of information about the archaic period), and the broad limits of
dating, i.e. in the sixth century, are unlikely to be wrong.
1 The early dating is seen e.g. in the Suda (DKyAa) and in Diog. L. i, 42
(DKg A i, after Hermippus). The later dating appears e.g. in Diog. L. i, 1 18
(after Aristoxenus) andi, 12 1 (after Apollodorus) seeDK 7 A i ; also in Cicero Tusc. i, 1 6, 38 (DK.7A5), Pliny N.H. vn, 205, Eusebius Chron. (DKjAia).

vived in Diogenes' time, the third century A.D. The opening words
might be known well enough from the entry in Callimachus'
catalogue of the Alexandrian library (the patronymic, omitted here, was given shortly before as BApuos, 'son of Babys'). That the book survived the burning of the Library in 47 B.C. may be con
firmed by a longer quotation, 54; though this and other fragments
could have survived through the medium of handbooks or antho
logies. The title is given in 44. 'ETrrdiJivxos,
*
(of) seven recesses', seems to be the book's true title; 1 variants descriptive of the con
tents are added, as often, but are probably of later origin. The 'ten-volume theology' is probably a confusion with a ten-volume
work on Attic history (itself beginning, no doubt, from gods and heroes) ascribed to the Athenian Pherecydes in the lines that follow in the Suda. The precise reference of the cryptic and
unusual title '(of) seven recesses' is very obscure: see p. 58. 45
exemplifies the widespread tradition that this was the earliest
prose book. What Theopompus (fourth century B.C.) must actually have said is that Pherecydes first wrote about the gods in prose, as opposed to e.g. Hesiod. Prose annals were presumably recorded before Pherecydes, but he and Anaximander (whose book may
have been roughly contemporary, and might possibly be assigned to 547/6 B.C., p. 101) might well have been the first substantial prose writers to have survived; on the confusion over Thales as a
writer see pp. 85 f.
1 It seems rash to accept 'foe recesses', from 51, as the title, with Diels followed by Jaeger and others, on the sole strength of Damascius* statement
there that the divine products of Chronos* seed, when disposed in five recesses, were called TrevTepuxos. Even if this is intended to give the title of the book, the five recesses mentioned just before provide a clear motive for writing five and not seven.
HIS LIFE AND LEGEND
(i) The connexion with Pythagoras
Many miracles were attributed to Pherecydes, e.g. predictions of an earthquake, a shipwreck, the capture of Messene. These were variously located : in Sparta, near Ephesus, in Samos, in Syros, and so on. The difficulty is that the same miracles were also attributed
to Pythagoras. Apollonius the paradoxographer, not certainly using Aristotle, said that c Pythagoras afterwards indulged in the
50



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
miracle-working, TepaToiroifa, of Pherecydes' (259); and it was
certainly accepted in the Peripatetic circle that when Pherecydes fell ill of louse-disease in Dclos his disciple Pythagoras came and cared for him until his death (Diog. L. i, 118, Diodorus x, 3, 4;
DK 7Ai and 4). So Aristoxenus asserted, and Dicaearchus too
according to Porphyry Vit. Pythag. 56. Porphyry also related (as quoted by Eusebius, DKyAG) that according to the fourth
centuiy B.C. writer Andron of Ephesus the miracles belonged
properly to Pythagoras; but that Theopompus plagiarized the miracle-stories from Andron and, to disguise his theft, assigned
them instead to Pherecydes and slightly altered the localities involved. Andron was far from critical, however, since he invented
another Pherecydes of Syros, an astronomer (Diog. L. i, 119, DKyA i) ; and Porphyry's explanation of the divergence is uncon
vincing. The confusion and disagreement which patently existed in the fourth century show that reliable details of the life of
Pherecydes were lacking. If Pherecydes had been a sage of the
type naturally to attract miracle-stories (as Pythagoras was), the connexion between two similar contemporaries would have been invented whether it existed or not; but apart from the feats other
wise attributed to Pythagoras, Pherecydes seems to have had little of the shaman or magician about him. It has been suggested that the whole tissue of legend might have arisen from a well-known
fifth-century B.C. comment:

As H.Gomperz maintained (Wiener St. 47 (1929) 1 4 n. 3), this probably means no more than e If Pythagoras is right about the survival of the soul, then Pherecydes' soul should be enjoying a blessed
existence'. It might have been misinterpreted, even in antiquity, to imply a friendship between the two men, and have encouraged the transference to Pherecydes of stories about Pythagoras.
46 Ion of Chios says about him [Pherecydes] :
* Thus did he excel in manhood and honour, and now that he is dead he has a delightful existence for his soul if indeed Pythagoras the wise learned and knew true opinions above all men.''

PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Elaborate biographical accounts were invented on the slightest
pretext, especially in the third and second centuries B.C. (see e.g.
p. 183); even so one hesitates to suppose that the fourth-century controversy can have been founded on evidence so slight as Ion's little encomium. Yet none of the evidence on this point looks at all
convincing, and it is as well to preserve a certain scepticism about the relationship between the two men.

The assertion that Pherecydes was self-taught probably means no more than that no teacher could conveniently be supplied for him when his complete biography came to be written. That he used Phoenician secret books (an unlikely story indeed) is another
piece of speculation of the type beloved by the biographical compilators. Yet it must have had some foundation, and may be
based on apparently oriental motifs in his thought: he was later connected with Zoroastrianism (n. 2 on p. 65), and the battle of
Kronos and Ophioneus, like that of Zeus and Typhoeus in Hesiod, had some Phoenician affinities (p. 68).

The implication in 48 that a solstice-marker preserved in Syros in
Diogenes' time had belonged to, or been used by, Pherecydes must be approached with caution. (A solstice-marker is a device to mark the point at which the sun * turns' on the ecliptic, at midsummer or midwinter.) There seems to be some connexion with a cryptic couplet in Homer, 49. The scholia show that two alternative interpretations of this couplet were known in Alexandria :
either (a) 661 Tporral fjsAioio describes Syrie (rather than Ortygie), and means that there was there a bearing-marker in the form of a
cave; or (b) the meaning is that Syrie lies 'above', i.e. north of, Ortygie, and also west of it, where the sun ' turns ' in the sense of
setting. 1 Both (a) and (b) improbably assume that Ortygie represents Delos, and Syrie Syros (which lies some twenty miles slightly
north of west from Delos) .2 Now whatever the intended meaning of the Homeric phrase,3 there evidently was a sun-cave reported
from Syros in the Alexandrian period, and this is presumably the form of marker that Diogenes referred to three or four centuries
later. We hear of another type of natural solstice-marker from
Itanos in Crete in the fourth century B.C., and such things must
have been relatively common for calendar purposes. The sun-cave
in Syros cannot, it seems, have been the original motive of the Homeric reference, but it was nevertheless seized upon at a later
date (and certainly, one would think, later than Pherecydes) in an
attempt to explain the description in the Odyssey. Whatever its antecedents, it would as a matter of course have become associated
with the island's most notable inhabitant, Pherecydes. Although there is no other evidence that he was a practical scientist, many
other sixth-century sages, especially the Milesians, were known to have had applied as well as theoretical interests; and it would be almost inevitable for an Alexandrian scholar, for instance, auto
matically to provide a historical association between the only two
apparently scientific products of Syros Pherecydes and the solstice-marker. Reluctant as one is, therefore, to disconnect such
a pleasing device from such an intriguing man, extreme scepticism again seems desirable.

PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
1 This sense of Tpo-rrcd is absolutely unparalleled and highly improbable, especially since Tpoiral f)6Afoio are mentioned three times in the Hesiodic Works and Days, always meaning solstice. But (0), as well as (b), is virtually impossible: for even though Tpoiral fjeAioio can, and indeed does, mean
' solstice ' or ' solstices ', it cannot conceivably in any kind of Greek mean a device (whether a cave or anything else) for marking or observing solstices. 2 There were other actual Ortygias as well as Delos (to which the name is only applied in contexts which could have been affected by learned speculation on 49) : notably the island forming part of Syracuse, and a precinct near Ephesus. 'OpTuyfrj means 'of the quail* (6p*n/5), and might be applied to any locality at which quails habitually rested in their
migrations between Egypt and the north. A difficulty in identifying Ortygie with Dclos is that the two places are distinguished in the Homeric
Hymn to Apollo (16) ; but the passage is suspect on other grounds. A far
more serious difficulty, and one that has been widely ignored, is that of identifying Zupfr), with a short upsilon, with Zvpo$, which has a long
upsilon. The connexion of Syrie with Syracuse is also philologically improbable. Miss H. L. Lorimer (Homer and the Monuments 80 ff.) argued for SvpfTj referring to Syria (which, she maintained, might have been
naively taken for an island), and for Tpoirai meaning 'sunrise', i.e. the east. But it seems impossible that Syria should be termed an island ; and the Phoenicians would hardly have been conceived as spending a whole
year trading with a place so near their own country (cf. Od. 15, 455). 3 661 Tpoirccl fjeAfoio could describe either Syrie or Ortygie. Here an observation of Miss Lorimer's is of great importance: the only other place in
Homer where Ortygie is mentioned is Od. 5, 123, where Orion, having been
carried off by Eos, is slain in Ortygie by Artemis. The implication is that
Ortygie was the dwelling-place of Eos, the dawn, and therefore that it lies in the east. Miss Lorimer thought that solstices could not carry a directional meaning. But, since solstices would normally be observed at sunrise (by the
bearing method), 'where the summer solstice is' would signify the general
direction in which the sun rises at the summer solstice, namely north-east by east; while 'where the winter solstice is' would signify south-east by
east. The summer solstice is the important one for record purposes, and
the mention of the solstice, by itself, might naturally bring to mind the north-east by east direction. Thus the intention of the Homeric phrase is to
indicate the general direction of this probably mythical Ortygie. It is worth adding that the dwelling-place of Eos was often conceived as being Aia, and that Aia was commonly identified with Colchis ; and Colchis does in fact lie roughly north-east by east from the centre of the Ionian coastline.

Zas and Chronos and Chthonic 'always existed' : this resolves the
difficulty of creation ex nihilo. An analogous declaration is seen,
some two generations later, in Heraclitus' world-order, which no
god or man made, but always was, and is, and shall be (220) ; also in Epicharmus fr. i (DK.23BI probably genuine), where the case is explicitly argued. But already in the sixth century B.C. the divinity assigned to Anaximander's aiTEipov and Anaximenes' air
probably implies that these, too, had always existed. It is surprising to find this concept stated so explicitly, and in a theogonical
context, at this relatively early date. Yet the gods who always
existed are probably conceived as original forms (by etymology) of conventional figures from the traditional theogony; and one of
them is 'Time', which might naturally be felt, without any deep abstract reflexion, to have been unborn. Thus Pherecydes was
not trying to solve a logical difficulty about creation so much as to
substitute a new first stage, dependent on etymology and particu
larly on a new understanding of Kronos the father of the gods, for
the imprecise, if more rationalistic, 'Chaos came into being' of Hesiod.
The names are unusual. Zds (accusative ZdvTa) is obviously an etymological form of ZEUS, and is perhaps intended to stress the
ning is: * ^as and Chronos always existed and Chthonie; and Chthonie got the name ofGe,
since %as gave her Ge as a present [or prerogative]'

element 30- (an intensive prefix), as in j&Oeos, SOCTIS; though there is some possibility that the form Zas is intended to link the sky-god
Zeus with the earth-goddess Ge, whose Cyprian form is 30:. XOovfrj, from \6&v, is presumably intended to represent Earth in a primitive role, perhaps as the abode of chthonic daimons, and at all events with stress on the underparts of the earth. As for
Xpovos, it has been argued, notably by Wilamowitz, that the true reading must be Kpovos: Kronos played an important part in Pherecydes' theogony according to one extant fragment, 58, and 'Time' is a surprisingly sophisticated cosmogonical concept for the sixth century B.C. But Xpovo$, which is widely supported in the sources, is almost certainly correct; the other two figures are
etymologizing variants of well-known theogonical figures, and we
naturally anticipate a similar case with the third figure. The
substitution of Xpovos for Kpovos is just what we should expect
here.1 It appears likely that by the later stages of the theogony the primeval trio assumed their familiar form as Zeus, Kronos and
Hera.2 That Pherecydes was addicted to etymologies emerges clearly from our scanty evidence: thus, in addition to the idio
syncratic derivations of names already discussed, X6co$ was perhaps connected by him (as later by the Stoics) with x&<70ai (p. 59 n.), and so interpreted as water; Rhea was called Tfj (DKysg), and perhaps connected with f>eiv etc.; Okeanos was called Ogenos (54); the gods called a table 0ucopo$, 'watcher over
offerings'
1 Wilamowitz roundly declared that ' Time ', as a cosmogonical god in the sixth century, was impossible. Certainly the abstraction implied in the Xp6vov Sdcrj (Solon, see 113), or TTJV TOU xpovou Td^iv (Anaximander, see 112), is less startling in its implications, as are the Xp6vo$ 6 irdvTCOv TronYip
of Pindar 01. 2, 17 and the hypostatized Time of tragedy; though the two
last instances provide some parallel. The Iranian cosmogonical Time, Zvran Akarana, was introduced as a refinement of Mazdaism and cannot be assumed earlier than the fourth century B.C. (n. on p. 39), though the possibility of oriental influence in this respect cannot be entirely discounted.
The Chronos of the late Orphic cosmogonies was presented in a Hellenistic shape, and cannot be taken as any kind of parallel or precedent for the
sixth century B.C. The connexion of Kronos with Chronos was certainly
made by later Orphics (cf. e.g. Kern Orph. Frag. fr. 68), but according to
Plutarch (Is. Osir. 32) this was a common Greek identification: we cannot say whether or not Pherecydes was the originator. That he did intend to
relate them is stated by Hermias and Probus (DKyAg), probably after Stoic sources. In any event one should not exaggerate (as Wilamowitz did) the depth of abstraction, and of metaphysical content, implied by the
56



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
presence of Ghronos in 50. Pherecydes probably took the Kronos of legend, asked himself what the etymology was, and arrived at the obvious
answer, Ghronos or Time a familiar and simple concept which is plainly somehow involved in cosmogony.
2 Chthonie gets the name of Ge, Earth, at a subsequent stage, presumably
when Zas presents her with the cloth embroidered with earth in 54. But at that point she apparently takes over the control and guardianship of
marriages; this was Hera's prerogative (as focnTiAfoc) according to the general view, and in so far as Chthonie-Ge is the wife of Zas-Zeus she is also
thought of as becoming Hera. (Demeter, who is much closer to Ge, was in charge of certain female activities, as 860^09690$, but not of marriage ;
she may, however, provide a connecting link.) Hera was probably not an earth-goddess in origin, but there are other isolated cases where she replaces Gaia; for example, she appears to be the mother of Typhaon in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo, 35 if., also in Stesichorus (Et. Magn. 772.
50) ; cf. 53, and Virgil Aen. iv, 166.
Damascius in 51 is following Eudemus. Chronos makes fire, wind and water out of his own seed,1 and this is implied to take
place at an early stage. The episode cannot be invented, though it
would not be surprising if some details of it were distorted. One is reminded of Egyptian cosmogonical accounts in which the first world-constituents are produced by the onanism of a primeval
god, notably that of Atum-Re mentioned in the Memphis theology (ANET 5) ; and also of the mutilation of Ouranos by Kronos in
32, where certain mythological figures are begotten by Ouranos'
member and the blood from it. The idea that the human seed is creative, and therefore that a primary deity's seed is cosmo
gonically creative, is neither surprising nor illogical. What is surprising here, however, is the things which are thus created : they smack of fifth-century four-element theory, earth being omitted
because already accounted for in the very name of Chthonie-Ge.
TTveuiacc looks suspiciously anachronistic, even though Anaximenes
emphasized its importance at roughly this period (pp. I4gff.). These substances cannot have formed the raw material of later
cosmic arrangement: for according to 51 what they produce is not a world but deities of some kind. In fact, I would suggest that the
seed producing fire, wind (irveujjia) and water is probably a later
rationalizing interpretation, perhaps Stoic in origin but based on the Aristotelian concept (itself to some extent indebted to Diogenes
of Apollonia, cf. 619 fin.} that the human cnrepuoc, seed, contains oO^VTOV 7TveO|jicc, innate breath, which is also described as being 'hot' and aitherial (cf. e.g. Generation of animals 63, 736 b 336.). In accounts of early Stoic physiology, too, the seed is described as
57



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
jJieQ' OypoO ('breath with moisture', Arius Didymus on
Zeno) and is associated with Trveunoc ev0ep[Jiov, 'warm breath'. It therefore seems probable that the three unexpected products of Chronos' seed fire, wind and water are an intrusive later
interpretation of the nature of the seed itself, and that originally it was Chronos' semen itself that was placed in the recesses. As for these, the seven in the title as given in the Suda might be obtained by adding to the five recesses connected with Chronos in 51 the
two other pre-existing deities Zas and Chthonie, the latter of which, certainly, had a local and indeed a recess-like connotation.
Alternatively, all seven recesses could have been part of Chthonie : it is notable that the Babylonian world of the dead was conceived as having seven regions,2 and in the myth of the Descent of Ishtar, Ishtar has to pass through seven gates (ANET loyf.) ; one thinks
(though perhaps not significantly) of the doors and gates that Porphyry found in Pherccydes (52) .
1 This seems, then, to be the first creation-act. But there is no essential conflict with 42, where T6 yevvfjaav irpcoTOV must be Zas-Zeus: for it is
Zas who first creates the parts of the world (54), while Chronos produces theogonical, not cosmogonical, constituents.
2 In the first eleven chapters of the Hippocratic treatise TTepl (35ouocScov the world is divided into seven parts to correspond with the seven parts of
the human body. Some scholars date this fragmentary and unattractive work in the sixth century B.C. There seem to be no strong grounds for such
an early date, and stylistically a late Hellenistic origin is far more probable.
A possible clue to the production by Chronos from his own seed
appears in the following neglected passage :

53 They say that Ge in annoyance at the slaughter of the Giants slandered %eus to Hera,
and that Hera went off and told Kronos about this. He gave her two eggs9 smearing them
with his own semen, and telling her to store them underground: from them, he said, a daimon would be produced who would displace ^eus from power. And she in her anger put them under Arimon in Cilicia. But when Typhon had been produced, Hera had become reconciled to %eus, and revealed everything; and %eus blasted Typhon and named the mountain Aetna.
58



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
This has to be used with caution: it may originate from the
Pergamene editors of Homer (the first-hand scholia of B are anti
Aristarchean) and be based upon a genuinely ancient version, but it is in part eclectic, adding a Homeric element (Arimon) to those
seen in 5th-century poetry (Pi. P. i, i6ff., Aesch. Pr. 351 ff.). It could therefore be distorted in places by later Orphic developments
(cf. 34, 37) ; although it is evidently not directly dependent on the Rhapsodies, since the eggs are placed not in the windy wastes of
Aither or Ercbos (an essential element of the Rhapsodic account) but in Gaia. That Kronos not Chronos appears is not necessarily
important (see p. 56). The notable thing is that Kronos im
pregnates two eggs (why two?) with his own seed, and that the eggs
have to be placed underground, KCCTOC yfjs, possibly in a recess of
some kind here, under a mountain. From the eggs, when ferti
lized by the seed, comes Typhon/Typhoeus, an analogue of Pherecydes' Ophioneus (pp. 66 ff.) . There does seem to be a striking parallel with the cryptic mention of Chronos' seed in 51 ; if so, it provides some confirmation of the speculation that some kind of
theogonical figure or figures ('numerous other divine offspring') came directly from Chronos' seed. 1 It makes a faint possibility,
too, that generation from an egg (but not of cosmological constituents) occurred in Pherecydes (see pp. 44-8) though this device became so popular in Hellenistic and later accounts that it might
well have been imposed on a simpler story.
1 Porphyry (cf. DK 767) mentioned people who took what he called TT\V
iKpoi*iv, in Pherecydes, to refer to semen; though they applied the same interpretation to Hesiod's Styx and Plato's Ameles. H. Gomperz (Wiener St. 47 (1929) 19 n. 10) suggested that Chronos produred a generation of
primeval deities from the ixpor), just as his later form Kronos did from
Rhea; this would in fact fit in with the suggestion made above, that fire,
wind and water are an intrusive gloss. The connexion of Rhea, called
'Pfj by Pherecydes (DK.7B9), with exporj seems quite possible. A further
but more remote possibility is that Chronos' semen became primeval water.
We are told in one source (Achilles hag. 3, DKjBia) that Pherecydes, like Thales, declared the element to be water, which he called X^S
(presumably deriving it from x^6CT^ai> # tnc whole thing is not Stoic
accommodation). The Suda, too, says that 'he imitated the opinion of
Thales ' (DK 7 A 2) ; though Sextus, on the other hand, said that his principle
was earth (DK7Aio). Great penetration is not to be sought in these interpretations; but it does seem probable that Pherecydes understood Hesiod's Chaos in a special sense, perhaps because of a specious etymology. The surviving fragments show that there was no question of water coming first; but the special interpretation of Chaos may have been connected with Chronos' seed at a relatively early stage of cosmic development.
59



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
The names listed by Porphyry in 52 doors and gates as well as
recesses, pits and caves again suggest that something more elaborate than mere depressions in the earth was in question;
though this may be just mythological decoration. Porphyry's interpretation, that these things were connected with the soul, is
purely Neoplatonic and comes in a treatise in which every detail of the Cave of the Nymphs in the Odyssey is made to yield a similar
psychic meaning. There is no good evidence for attributing any special interest in the soul to Pherecydes. 1
1 Cicero's remark at Tusc. i, 16, 38 (DK.7A5), that Pherecydes was the
first to call human souls eternal, is probably caused by the attribution of
Pythagoras' ideas to his putative master; cf. the Suda, DK.7A2. A similar statement occurs in Aponius (DK7A5); the addition that Pherecydes
'unum nobis de coelo spiriturn, alterum credidit terrenis seminibus comparatum' seems to mean merely that the soul is aitherial, the body terrestrial, and not (as H. Gomperz and others have imagined) that Pherecydes postulated a double spiritus. That the soul is connected with aither is a view he might conceivably have held : see p. 200 and note.

FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
The marriage is between Zas and Chthonie, as is confirmed by
57. Zas' declaration 'desiring [or some such word] marriages to belong to you' suggests strongly that Chthonie is here partially equated with Hera, the goddess of marriage (n. 2 on p. 57). The preparations are of a fairy-tale quality, and are carried out by
unspecified agents. On the third day of the wedding festivities1
Zas makes a great cloth, decorating it with Ge (earth) and Ogenos
(evidently Pherecydes' name for Okeanos). 2 He presents it to Chthonie : the gift of this representation of Ge seems to be what was referred to in 50, where Ghthonie took the name Ge 'since
Zas gave her earth as a gift [or prerogative]'. With the cloth he also gives her Ogenos, which may be regarded as a part of the earth's surface in the broad sense but is not a prerogative of Chthonie in the way that Ge is. Chthonie initially represents the
solid substructure of earth rather than its variegated surface, Ge
and Ogenos. Now the main question is whether the weaving or embroidering of earth and Okeanos is an allegory of an actual creation-act. It seems probable that it is; otherwise, what is the point of Zas undertaking this odd and unmasculine task one very
different, it may be noted, from Hephaestus' decoration of the shield of Achilles in Iliad book 18? Not simply to symbolize the gift
of Ge, and as a mythological precedent for the Anacalypteria, the
Unveiling of the bride; there is this aetiological element in the
story, as is explicitly stated, but the gift need not have been of this bizarre kind ifit had no more significance than that of an Unveiling
gift.3 A more positive indication is provided in the following passage :
55 Proclus in Tim., n, p. 54 Diehl 6 OepSKu8r|s eAeyev sis "EpcoTa ueTa(36J3Af](j0ai T6v Aioc tJieAAovTa Srmtoupysiv, OTI 6f] TOV KoaiJiov IK

The whole of this from OTI 8f| onwards is palpably Stoic interpreta
tion, with a slight Neoplatonic colouring, and tells us nothing about Pherecydes. The first statement, however, that Zeus turned into Eros when about to create, must be based on something in Pherecydes. It suggests first that Zas did undertake some kind of
cosmogonical creation, and secondly that he did so as Eros, or at
55 Pherecydes used to say that %eus had changed into Eros when about to create, for the reason that, having composed the world from the opposites, he led it into agreement and peace and sowed sameness in all things, and unity that interpenetrates the universe.
61



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
least in some erotic situation. This need mean no more than the
liaisons and births of the Theogony\ but that some particular
description was envisaged is shown also by 57, in which a specific Eros exists between Zas and Chthonie.4 This tells us clearly that Zas' creation is concerned with an erotic situation between himself
and Chthonie : the wedding itself may, therefore, be meant, and since we hear nothing of any offspring of cosmogonical relevance, while the depiction of earth and Okeanos (whether surrounding river, or sea in general) is the prelude to the consummation of the
marriage and could well represent a cosmogonical act, we rnay provisionally accept that such is the case.
1 The wedding ceremonies took three days in all, the final unveiling accompanied by gifts, and the consummation, taking place on the third:
so Hesychius s.v., who put the ccvaKccAvnrn'ipioc on the third day, though all other ancient authorities (none of them early) imply that the whole ceremony took only one day.
2 Ogenos (Ogenos in Lycophron and Stephanus of Byzantium) is an odd variant of 'GOKeocvos, and is conceivably related to Akkadian uginna circle. Pherecydes* use of it is another indication of his preference for archaizing
or etymological forms. 3 A -niiTAos was given to Harmonia by Cadmus at their wedding
(Apollodorus in, 4, 2), but we are not told that it was decorated in any
particular way, and Cadmus did not make it. Nor does there seem to be more than an adventitious connexion with the lepos yocpos at Plataea (cf. Farnell, Cults, i, 244), in which a statue carved from an oak-tree was dressed as a bride to represent Hera.

that Pherecydes said in allegory about the gods, taking his idea from the prophecy of Ham. 57 But consider also the work of the man ofSyros, and %as and Chthonie and the Eros between them, and the birth of Ophioneus and the battle ofgods and the tree and the robe.
62



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
We learn in 56 that the embroidered cloth (i.e. that given by Zas to Chthonie in 54) was somehow on a winged oak: this must be
what 'the tree and the robe' refer to in 57. One modern sug
gestion (by H. Gomperz, Wiener St. 47 (1929) 22) is that the oak represents the frame of the loom on which Zas made the cloth.
This involves taking OTTOTTTEPOS to mean simply
'
swift', with total
suppression of the concrete wing-image ; there is no parallel for such a use with a concrete subject. More serious, a loom could hardly be called an oak-tree, simply, even in a fantastic context.
According to another interpretation (Diels, SB Ber. 1897, i47f.) the oak resembles the mast on which Athene's peplos was carried in the Panathenaic procession. It is true that 57 uses the word
TTETrAov, and ' winged ' might be explained as describing the crosspiece on which the robe was hung; but there is really no reason whatever for thinking of the Panathenaia, and to refer to the mast as an oak would be distinctly odd. 1 Both Diels and K. von Fritz
(author of the article on Pherecydes in Pauly-Wissowa) believed that an allegorical version of Anaximander is also in question : the
earth is shaped like a tree-trunk because it is cylindrical as in Anaximander (see 124) ; it is described as a tree because Anaximander said that a sphere of flame fitted round air and earth like the bark round a tree (123) ; the earth is winged because it floats
free in space (125); the embroidering of its surface is reminiscent of Anaximander's map (pp. iO3f.) ; and the treatment of Okeanos
as an integral part of the earth's surface is a new development found also in Anaximander. But none of these arguments is valid,
let alone cogent : the shape of the earth cannot be represented by the shape of the trunk alone, which is not the only or even the most conspicuous part of an oak-tree ; Anaximander's bark round
a tree is a simile ; 'winged', if it is to be given an abstract connota
tion at all, should mean 'swift-moving' and not 'floating'; Anaximander's map had no known connexion with his cos
mology; and the tendency to integrate Okeanos with the
inner seas is occasionally detectable even in Homer. Other
alleged borrowings from Anaximander (Time, and y6vo$~ y6vi|aov) are no more convincingly in favour of an inter
pretation which von Fritz had the temerity to call 'practically certain'. Further, there is little probability that a scientific ac
count should, in the archaic period, receive a nearly contemporary
allegorization.
63



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
1 Diels, followed by e.g. Jaeger, Mondolfo and von Fritz, was groundlessly impressed by the whole context (DK ys 5) of 60 below, where Origen
reports that Celsus interpreted certain rites and mythological incidents as
symbolizing the subjection of matter by god. Two passages in Homer, then Pherecydes* description of Tartaros (60), and finally the Panathenaic peplos are so interpreted; the last is said to show 'that a motherless and immaculate deity prevails over the boastful Earthborn'. Here the robe
represents Athene, the cart (later ship) in which the pole supporting it was carried represents the Earthborn: such ancient speculations about this
particular ritual were rather common. The interpretation is quoted as a
separate instance, parallel of course to the Phcrecydes extract because adduced as another illustration of the same thesis; but there is nothing to suggest that Pherecydes should be interpreted in terms of the Panathenaia.
The following interpretation is proposed as more probable than any of those described above. The oak represents the solidly fixed substructure and foundations of the earth (the 'frame' of the earth, Zeller suggested). Its trunk and branches are the support and roots of the earth. That the earth has roots is part of the
popular world-picture (pp. iof.), and a tree's branches, in winter, appear as large inverted roots. That the roots of earth and sea. were sometimes conceived as being above Tartarus, and that Tartarus
itself could be imagined as a narrower pit beneath, is clearly
shown by the important description at Theogony 726 ff., already quoted as 2: 'Around Tartarus a brazen fence is drawn; and all about it Night in three rows is poured, around the throat; and above are the roots of earth and unharvested sea.' The throat or neck that is Tartarus (or a part of it) corresponds with the trunk of the oak-tree, the roots which are above it correspond with the branches.1 The oak is 'winged' partly, at least, because of the
spreading, wing-like appearance of these same branches. On them Zas has laid the cloth embroidered with Earth and Ogenos : these
represent the earth's surface, flat or slightly convex, as indeed it
appears to be. We cannot say whether Ogenos is conceived as a
surrounding river or as the sea. The oak is specified because it is associated more than any other tree with Zeus (cf. the prophetic oaks in his shrine at Dodona, Od. 14, 328), and because of its notable strength and the great spread of its branches. Thus
according to the interpretation offered here Zas must have chosen, or magically grown, a broad oak as the foundation of the earth; or
(following a suggestion by T. B. L. Webster) he summoned an oak from afar which magically flies to him, using its branches as wings. Zas then weaves a cloth, decorating it with earth and



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
Okeanos, and lays the decorated cloth on the outspread branches of the oak to form the earth's surface.2
1 60 mentions Tartaros below the earth, which suggests that Pherecydes
broadly accepted the popular world-picture, not the rationalized construction of Anaximander. The kind of world-tree postulated above must be distinguished from e.g. the Scandinavian world-tree Yggdrasil, whose branches form the heavens, not the support for the earth's surface; though the roots of the tree are regarded as supporting the earth.
2 A clue to the meaning of the winged oak and the cloth is apparently
given by Isidorus' comment in 56 that Pherecydes c took the supposition
from the prophecy of Ham*. Unfortunately, little can be determined about
this work. Harnack suggested that Ham in this context is a name for Zoroaster (Bidez and Gumont, Les Mages Hellenists n, 62 n.) ; this identi
fication was occasionally made, cf. op. cit. i, 43 ; n, 49-50. Zoroaster was well established as a sage by the early Hellenistic period, and Aristoxenus
had stated that Pythagoras visited Zoroaster in Babylon (294) . Of the vast mass of pseudo-Zoroastrian literature produced in the Hellenistic epoch, there was a work On Nature in four books, and special accounts of
the magical properties of stones and plants, as well as descriptions of
Hades. The book on nature seems to have contained nothing of cosmo
gonical interest, but, like the rest, to have dealt with astrology, minerals
and so on. A second wave of Zoroastrian literature was produced in the first two centuries A.D. by various Gnostic sects in the Clementine
apocrypha, by the Sethians, by the disciples of Prodicus. More of genuine Zoroastrianism (dualism of good and evil, importance of fire) was to be found in these works than in the earlier group. It is a question to which group Isidorus was referring; though the facts that Isidorus' father Basilides inclined to Iranian dualism, and that the Ham-Zoroaster identification is probably first found in a Gnostic source, suggest that it was
the later one. On the other hand Isidorus is less likely to have been taken in by a product of his own age. But in neither group can we detect any
thing which might have been regarded as a significant precedent for the
winged oak or the embroidered cloth; we cannot even assume that Isidorus was struck by the oriental character of Pherecydes' allegory,
since much of the Greek Zoroastrian literature was not oriental in origin or colouring. One cannot be certain that Pherecydes' allegory had not itself been absorbed into some pseudo-Zoroastrian source, and so misled Isidorus.

Pherecydes evidently described in some detail an encounter between Kronos (probably derived from the primeval deity
Ghronos: see p. 56) and Ophioneus, the preliminaries of which appear in 58. This must form part, at least, of 'the battle of gods'
in Maximus' summary (57). Ophioneus is obviously connected with 6915, snake, and is a snake-like monster of the type of
Typhoeus in the Hesiodic Theogony (line 825, Typhoeus had a
hundred snake-heads) . The battle with Kronos is otherwise known from rare Hellenistic references, of which the description in 59 is
the most important. There, Ophion (as he is there called) has a consort, the Occanid Eurynome, while Kronos is helped by Rhea.
There are enough divergences to suggest that Apollonius is not merely copying Pherecydes, 1 and it seems that there was an old
recounted their challenges and struggles, and that they made an agreement that whichever of them fell into Ogenos, these were the vanquished, while those who thrust them out and were victorious were to possess the sky.
59 He [Orpheus] sang howfast of all Ophion and Eurynome, daughter ofOkeanos, held sway over snowy Olympus; and how by strength ofhands theformeryielded his lordship to Kronos, the latter to Rhea, and they fell in the waves of Okeanos; and the other two meantime held sway over the blessed gods, the Titans, while %eus, still a boy and still having childish thoughts in his heart, dwelt by the Dictaean cave. . ..
60 (Celsus) says that with this interpretation of these Homeric lines in mind Pherecydes has said: ' Below that portion is the portion of Tartaros; the daughters of Boreas, the Harpies, and Storm, guard it; there %eus expels whosoever of the gods behaves insolently.*
66



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
story, not mentioned in Hesiod, which formed part of the manifold lost mythology of Kronos and related his encounter with a monster. In Pherecydes the victor is to have possession of the sky
(and so become, or remain, supreme god) ; according to Apollonius in 59 (supported by a scholion on Clouds 247) Ophion and
Eurynome had already ruled on Olympus and were trying to repel a challenge. There may be a reference here to the concept of
Okeanos and Tethys as the first gods (9, 10) : Eurynome was a
daughter of Okeanos,2 and with Ophion may represent a second generation replacing, somehow, that of Ouranos and Gaia. Yet in Pherecydes there is nothing to suggest that Ophioneus had ever ruled the sky; Maximus in 57 mentions 'the birth of Ophioneus
and the battle of gods', which may suggest that Ophioneus was, like Typhoeus in Hesiod, an unsuccessful challenger for power; and Tertullian (de corona 7, DK.7B4) asserted that according to
Pherecydes Kronos was the first king of the gods. Further, Pherecydes cannot have accepted the usual view, seen in Apollonius, that Zeus was a child in Crete during part of the reign of Kronos. The primeval Zas probably turned into Zeus (%eus not
%as occurs in 60; though this could be due to carelessness in the
transmission), just as Chronos probably turned into Kronos, and this would scarcely be by the medium of a birth. In Pherecydes,
as in the common version, Kronos- Chronos must have eventually
been deposed by Zas, to be despatched below the earth (as in
Homer, //. 14, 203 f., and Hesiod). Unfortunately 60, which locates the 'portion' of Tartaros below, presumably, that of Gaia (rather than of Hades in the sense of//. 8, 16), does not mention Kronos ; it seems to come from a description of the assignment of parts of the cosmos to different deities, which followed Zeus' final
subjection of his adversaries in Homer and Hesiod also.
1 Nor need we believe that Apollonius was reproducing an ancient Orphic account. There is a great deal in this cosmogony and theogony as sung by
Orpheus in the Argonautica that is not Orphic (see also 31 and n. 2 on P- 33)
2 Also at //. 1 8, 398 ff.; Theog. 358. At Theog. 295 ff. another Oceanid,
Callirhoe, produced the snake-woman Echidna, who mated with Typhaon.
The battle ofKronos against Ophion has obvious correspondences
with that of Zeus against Typhoeus in the Theogony. The whole
Typhoeus episode seems to have been interpolated into the Hcsiodic poem; but this cannot have been long after the original

composition, and is likely in any case to have been earlier than the
date of Pherecydes. The cosmic fight with a snake-god is not, of course, exclusive to Greece, but is found all over the Near East long before Hesiod, in both Semitic and Indo-European contexts. Compare the fight of Marduk with the serpent-aided Tiamat in
the Babylonian creation-myth (ANET Gaff.); the victory of the storm-god over the dragon Illuyanka in the Hurrian-Hittite story
of that name (ANET i25f.; Gurney, The Hittites, i8iff.); and the
nightly overcoming of the dragon Apophis by the Egyptian sun
god Re in his journey undef the earth (ANET 6-7). The battle
between Zeus and Typhocus-Typhon (who was equated with the Egyptian Seth) was in later accounts, though not in Hesiod,
located in Cilicia, especially on Mount Casius near the proto
Phoenician Minoan entrepot of Ras-Shamra/Ugarit. It clearly coincided with a local version of the sky-god and snake-monster motif, and this correspondence may have been the chief motive for the assertion that Pherecydes borrowed from the Phoenicians :

The earlier parallel of the Hesiodic Typhoeus makes it unnecessary
to suppose that Pherecydes was borrowing directly from an oriental source, and one may wonder whether the reference in the Suda (47) to his access to Phoenician secret books was based on
anything more than the Ophioneus-Typhon comparison.
1 It is a question whether the 'CtyiovfScci are literally 'the children of
Ophioneus ', or simply his army or supporters, cf. 58. If the former, one may compare the monsters born to Typhaon by Echidna at Theogony 306 ff. though these are not involved in the Typhoeus episode.
THE ORDER OF EVENTS IN PHEREGYDES' BOOK
The extant evidence, reviewed in the preceding pages, presents us with a number of phases described by Pherecydes : (a) the three
pre-existing deities; (b) the making by Chronos out of his own seed
of things disposed in five recesses, which produce other generations of gods; (c) the making of the cloth by Zas, the depiction on it of Earth and Ogenos, the wedding of Zas and Chthonie, and the
6l From the Phoenicians Pherecydes, too, took his impulse, when he wrote about him whom he called the god Ophioneus, and the children of Ophioneus.
68



FORERUNNERS OF PHILOSOPHICAL COSMOGONY
presentation of the cloth, followed (?) by the spreading of it over the winged oak; (d) the battle between Kronos and Ophioneus;
(e) the assignment of portions to different deities, perhaps implied in 60. Several incidents must have taken place about which we possess no information: for example, Chronos-Kronos was pre
sumably supplanted by Zas-Zeus, as in the common account, but Pherecydes' views here are unknown. Another problem is the birth of Ophioneus mentioned in Maximus' summary, 57 : who were the parents? It seems unlikely that Zas and Chthonie were
(although all mythological weddings have offspring, and we do not know the offspring of this particular one), since it must be assumed that the battle of Kronos and Ophioneus, the reward of
which is possession of the sky, takes place either during or as a
prelude to the rule of Chronos-Kronos, which seems to have preceded the wedding of Zas and Chthonie and the assumed creation of earth and Okeanos. But a difficulty arises here. In the fight between Ophioneus and Kronos the loser is to be he who falls
into Ogenos ; but according to the creation-allegory interpretation Ogenos is made at the wedding of Zas and Chthonie, which should
therefore precede and not follow the Ophioneus-fight. This diffi
culty applies to all reconstructions that make the weaving of the
cloth a creation-allegory: for Chronos' mastery of the sky is suggested by all the other evidence (especially 51 and the analogy of the Homeric-Hesiodic account) to have preceded the period of
Zas' activity. Either, therefore, Pherecydes was inconsistent in
presupposing Ogenos before it had been formally created; or Ogenos existed before it was woven into or embroidered on the cloth; or Ogenos is not an original element in Celsus' account of
the Kronos-Ophioneus fight. The last of these hypotheses is not
impossible. A somewhat different version of this encounter is known from the Hellenistic period, and is best seen in 59. There
Ophion and his bride Eurynome, the daughter of Okeanos, ruled
the sky, but were forcibly displaced by Kronos and Rhea and fell into the waves of Okeanos. Falling into Okeanos makes sense for an Oceanid and her consort; but in Pherecydes there seems to be no place for a female consort of any kind, let alone an Oceanid. It is possible, therefore, that Celsus or his source transferred into the Pherecydes version a detail from a rather different Hellenistic
version, and adapted it to the known Pherecydean terminology.
69



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Yet if Zas and Chthonie catmotjointly have produced Ophioneus after their wedding, it remains true that the earth-goddess Chthonie-Ge is the obvious parent for a snake (whose home is
traditionally in the earth), just as Gaia is normally the mother of
the snakeish Typhoeus. A liaison between Zas and Chthonie
before their marriage (as suggested by //. 14, 296) would fit the order of 57: the passion of Zas and Chthonie, the birth of
Ophioneus, the battle of gods, the tree and the robe (and, there
fore, the marriage). But there is no strong reason for assuming
that Maximus set down these themes in the exact order in which they occurred in Pherecydes' book; and the dramatic force of the
description of the wedding, which has obvious literary pretensions, would undoubtedly be weakened if Zas and Chthonie had been
living together for ages beforehand. It seems more probable that if Ophioneus was the child of Chthonie the father, if any, was other than Zas. Here Chronos springs to mind. His seed was
placed in 'recesses', presumably in the earth, according to 51; and there was a story, known only from 53 and not connected there
with Pherccydes, that Kronos impregnated two eggs with his seed, gave the eggs to Hera to place underground, and so produced the
snakish Typhoeus, to whom Ophioneus is similar. If this is the
case, Chronos with Chthonie would produce Ophioneus and, perhaps, other monsters; Ophioneus would attack Chronos
(already perhaps called Kronos) and be defeated; Zas in his turn would attack and overthrow Kronos, and would marry Chthonie,
now to be called Ge and in some ways to become equivalent to
Hera; in so doing he would create earth and sea as we know
them (the existence of sky being somehow presupposed, perhaps
implicit in Zas himself). How Zas subjected Kronos we do not know; it might be thought that Ophioneus was acting as his agent, but in view of 59 it must be assumed that Ophioneus was defeated and that Kronos was deposed by some other means. In this case the order of events might be: three pre-existing
deities; Chronos rules the sky, plants his seed in Chthonie; birth of Ophioneus (with other chthonic creatures) ; Ophioneus challenges Kronos, but fails; Kronos somehow subjected by Zas; marriage of Zas and Chthonie-Ge-Hera, and creation of our world; apportionment of spheres, Zeus' enemies in Tartaros. But it must be emphasized that most of this is very speculative indeed. 1

CONCLUSION
In spite of all uncertainties, Pherecydes is clearly a notable figure in the history of Greek cosmogonical speculation. As Aristotle implied (42), he combines the mythological approach with a more
objective one. The assertion that three deities always existed
implies a rational amendment to the traditional genealogical pattern; yet the method of creation pursued by Chronos is as
crudely anthropomorphic as anything in Hesiod. The details of
the allegory of the decorated cloth, if correctly interpreted, are part of the stock of pure myth ; at the same time the allegory
itself, which is of the highest interest both for its originality and for
its beauty, shows that Pherecydes accepted the naive but not unempirical view of the structure of the world which was outlined
in i . His interest in etymology, and consequent handling of the first gods, is the first clear manifestation of a way of thinking
conspicuous in Aeschylus and Heraclitus, and it evidently still impressed the Orphic eclectics of three and more centuries later.
Pherecydes was an individualist both in his handling of the
traditional stories of the gods and in his use of uncommon motifs. There is practically no indication of special near-eastern influence,
except conceivably in the seven recesses. There is, however, one respect in which his narrative is closer to oriental accounts than
to Greek ones. It is evident that in his book many incidents concerning the three pre-existing deities were related before the
cosmogony proper (that is, the formation of earth and Ogcnos) was reached. This may be compared with the Babylonian creation
myth, for example, where the splitting of Tiamat to form sky and earth comes only at the end of a long saga of the gods ; and con
62 Each seems to me to tell us a kind ofstory, as though we were children, one saying that existing things are three, and that certain of them in some wayfight with each other at times,
and at times they become good friends and provide marriages and births and nurturings of their offspring

trasted with the Hesiodic Theogony, where the cosmic constituents
are produced almost immediately, and as the prelude to the history of the gods. But this may be simply because Hesiod, and not Pherecydes and the Babylonian cosmogony, is quasirationalistic.
By no stretch of the imagination could the views of Pherecydes, or any of those described earlier in this chapter, be termed philo
sophical. They were, however, sometimes directed towards an
explanation of the world as a whole, especially of how it came to be what it is ; and they reveal on occasion a method not essentially different from that of Thalcs and the first Ionian philosophers,
who are treated in the immediately following chapters. What gave these the title of philosopher was their abandonment of mytho
poeic forms of thought, of personification and anthropomorphic theistic explanations, and their attempt to explain the seen world in terms of its seen constituents.



THE IONIAN THINKERS
It was in Ionia that the first completely rationalistic attempts to describe the nature of the world took place. There, material prosperity and special opportunities for contact with other cultures with Sardis, for example, by land, and with the Pontus and Egypt by sea were allied, for a time at least, with a strong cultural and literary tradition dating from the age of Homer. Within the space of a century Miletus produced Thales, Anaximander, and Anaximenes, each dominated by the assumption of a single basic material, the isolation of which was the most important step in any systematic account of reality. This attitude was clearly a development of the genetic or genealogical approach to nature exemplified by the Hesiodic Theogony and described in Chapter i. After the great Milesians, however, the attitude was moderated or abandoned. Xenophanes is here treated among the lonians (chapter v), but in fact he does not fit into any general category. Born and brought up in Colophon, and strongly aware of
Ionian ideas (more so, apparently, than Pythagoras), he moved to western Greece and was only incidentally interested in the details of cosmogony and cosmology. In Ephesus, meanwhile, the individualistic Heraclitus outstepped the limits of material monism, and, while retaining the idea of a basic (though not a cosmogonic) substance, discovered the most significant unity of things a unity which he, too, assumed without question in their structure or arrangement. Here there is a parallel with Pythagorean theories in the west of the Greek
world. Pythagoreanism produced the reaction of Parmenides, and for a time the western schools were all-important; but the Ionian materialistic monism re-asserted itself, to a certain extent, in the compromises of some of the post-Parmenidean systems.

CHAPTER II
THALES OF MILETUS
DATE
Traditionally the earliest Greek physicist, or enquirer into the nature of things as a whole (87), Thales predicted an eclipse
which took place in 585 B.C. (76) . He was presumably not active,
therefore, much earlier than the beginning of the sixth century. 1
1 The eclipse took place in Ol. 48, 4 (585/4) according to Pliny, N.H. n,
53 (DK.HA5), who presumably followed Apollodorus; and a year or
more later according to the Eusebian scheme (DKiiA5). Modern calculations put it on 28 May 585 B.C., i.e. in Ol. 48, 3. Tannery's view
that the eclipse predicted by Thales was that of 610 is now rejected.
Apollodorus according to Diogenes Laertius i, 37-8 (DK 1 1 A i) put Thales' birth in Ol. 35, i (640), his death in Ol. 58 (548-545) at the age of seventyeight. There is a fault in the mathematics here: probably Ol. 35, i is a mistake, by the common confusion of 6 and 0, for Ol. 39, i (624). Apollo
dorus, then, characteristically placed Thales' death around the epoch-year of the capture of Sardis, his acme at the time of the eclipse, and his birth the conventional forty years earlier. This accords approximately with a
different and slightly earlier dating authority: Demetrius of Phaleron, according to Diog. L. i, 22 (DKiiAi), placed the canonization of the
Seven Sages (of whom Thales was a universally accepted member) in the archonship of Damasias at Athens, i.e. 582/1 B.C., the epoch-year of the first restored Pythian festival.

But most people say that Thales was a true Milesian by descent, and of high family.

The story of Thalcs' Phoenician ancestry, barely mentioned by
Herodotus in 64 (though 63 makes it appear as though he had said more; the references in Douris and Democritus are otherwise
unknown), was later much elaborated, partly, no doubt, to support
the common theory of the eastern origins of Greek science. If Thales drew the attention of the Milesians to the navigational
value of the Little Bear, used earlier by Phoenician sailors (see 80), this would add to the force of Herodotus' comment. The probability is that Thales was as Greek as most Milesians. 1

Herodotus provides convincing evidence for Thales5 activities as
statesman and engineer (also as astronomer, 76). Such versatility
seems to have been typical of the Milesian thinkers, whom it is
tempting to consider too exclusively as theoretical physicists. Thales, especially, became a symbol for ingenuity of a mathematical and geometrical kind: avOpcoiros 0aAfjs ('the man's a
Thales'), says a character in Aristophanes (Birds 1009) of Meton
the town-planner; and Plato (Rep. 600 A) coupled him with Anacharsis. Herodotus, it is true, did not believe the story in 67 about Thales diverting the river Halys, but he did not deny that
this is the sort of thing Thales might have done. There probably were crossings over the Halys, but Croesus' army might not have
found them : Herodotus was rightly cautious, although the grounds
of his suspicion were not certainly correct. He went on to mention a variant account by which the river was totally diverted into a

present in the army, made the river, which flowed on the left hand of the army, flow on the right hand also. He did so in this way: beginning upstream of the army he dug a deep channel, giving it a crescent shape, so that it shouldflow round the back of where the army was encamped, being diverted in this way from its old course by the channel, and passing the camp shouldflow into its old course once more. The result was that as soon as the river was divided it became fordable in both its parts.

It was the custom to credit the sixth-century sages (notably, for
example, Solon) with visits to Egypt, the traditional fountain-head of Greek science. Thales as the earliest known Greek geometer had
a special reason for being associated with the home of landmeasurement. 1 The implication of 68 that he spent a considerable
time there is unique and not persuasive. That he did visit Egypt,
however, is possible enough : several of his achievements are quite plausibly located there (e.g. 81; sec also p. 86), and Miletus' rela
tions with its colony Naucratis were so close as to make a visit by any
prominent citizen, trader or not, perfectly feasible. The reference
to Homer in 70 is, of course, to the Okeanos-passagcs 9 and 10 :
Plutarch knew that in some Egyptian mythological cosmogonies
water played an essential part, and we shall in fact see (pp. 90 f.) that Thales probably derived his idea that the earth floats on water from
earlier near-eastern, and possibly Egyptian, mythological accounts.

Further, Thales appears in Aetius as the holder of a theory about the flooding of the Nile which is one of three already recorded by Herodotus:

70 They think that Homer also, like Thales, made water principle and birth of all
things through learning from the Egyptians. 71 It seems to me that geometry was discoveredfrom this source (sc. re-measurement of holdings after the Nile flood) and so came to Greece.
72 Of these, one theory says that the Etesian winds are the cause of the river flooding, by preventing the Nile from running out into the sea. 73 Thales thinks that the Etesian winds, blowing straight on to Egypt, raise up the mass
of the Nile's water through cutting off its outflow by the swelling of the sea coming against it.
77

Aetius probably depends on a lost Peripatetic treatise, of which traces have survived in other sources (Diels Doxographi Graeci 226f.) : therefore his information may be reliable and not, as is neverthe
less possible, a purely speculative ascription. If Thales did advance this theory then he may have seen the Nile himself; though it should be remembered that he could easily have got the relevant information (that the Etesian winds blow in Egypt too), and even the idea, from Milesian traders.

Neither of these stories is likely to be strictly historical, even though they originated in the fourth century B.C. at the latest, before the
great period of fictitious biography in the third and second
74 . . .just as, Theodorus, a witty and attractive Thracian servant-girl is said to have mocked Thalesforfalling into a well while he was observing the stars and gazing upwards; declaring that he was eager to know the things in the sky, but that what was behind him
and just by his feet escaped his notice.
75 For when they reproached him because of his poverty, as though philosophy were no use, it is said that, having observed through his study of the heavenly bodies that there would
be a large olive-crop, he raised a little capital while it was still winter, and paid deposits on all the olive presses in Miletus and Chios, hiring them cheaply because no one bid against him. When the appropriate time came there was a sudden rush of requests for the presses; he then hired them out on his own terms and so made a large profit, thus demonstrating that
it is easy for philosophers to be rich, if they wish, but that it is not in this that they are interested.

centuries. They well demonstrate how at a comparatively early
date Thales had become accepted as the typical philosopher: though 74, one of the oldest versions of the absent-minded
professor theme, would have had more point if applied to someone not so notoriously practical in his interests as Thales. The detail
of the witty slave-girl is added to make the whole situation more
piquant; possibly it is a vestige of a separate and mildly malicious joke at the philosopher's expense. Plato liked making fun of the Presocratics, a truth frequently overlooked in the interpretation of certain less obvious passages. The story in 75 may have gained
currency, even before Aristotle, as a standard reply to the reproach
of unpracticality implied in 74. It might have had a slight basis of truth (though Aristotle did not think so): details like the addition of Chios to Miletus are possibly too elaborate for the
wholly invented anecdote. At all events, anyone reading this book might draw some consolation from such a clear and influential formulation of one of the classical defences of abstruse
studies.

76 In the sixth year of the war, which they [Medes and Lydians] had carried on with equal fortunes, an engagement took place in which it turned out that when the battle was in progress the day suddenly became night. This alteration of the day Thales the Milesian foretold to the lonians, setting as its limit this year in which the change actually occurred.
77 Some think he was the first to study the heavenly bodies and to foretell eclipses of the sun and solstices, as Eudemus says in his history of astronomy; for which reason both Xenophanes and Herodotus express admiration; and both Heraclitus and Democritus bear witness for him.

The prediction of the eclipse must have been based on a long series
of empirical observations, not upon a scientific theory of the true
cause of eclipses. The cause was unknown to Thales' immediate successors in Miletus and therefore, presumably, to him. If the
contrary was implied by Eudemus in 78 (it is asserted by Aetius,
e.g. n, 24, i, DK 1 1 A 170), then Eudemus was guilty of drawing a wrong conclusion from the undoubted fact of Thales' prediction. The Babylonian priests had made observations of eclipses of the
sun, both partial and total, for religious purposes, at any rate since 721 B.C.; and by the sixth century they had probably established a cycle of solstices (or less plausibly of lunations) within which
eclipses might occur at certain points. It is overwhelmingly probable that Thales' feat depended on his access to these
Babylonian records ; we know that many cultivated Greeks visited
Sardis at this period, 1 and relations with Ionia were naturally particularly close. Some scholars have argued that Thales' information more probably came from Egypt, with which he had other contacts; but there is no evidence that sufficiently detailed
observations, over a long enough period, were made and recorded by the Egyptian priests. Even on the Babylonian data it could not
be predicted that an eclipse would be visible at a particular point. Priests were despatched to different parts of the Babylonian empire
when a possible eclipse was due, and even within this large area
the expected phenomenon was sometimes not visible. Further, no precise date could be predicted, only broad limits of time. Thus Thales appears to have said that an eclipse was likely to occur within a certain year.2 It was pure chance that it happened on the day of the battle and so seemed especially remarkable, and to some degree a matter of luck that it was visible near the Ionian area at all.
78 Eudemus relates in the Astronomy that Oenopidesfirst discovered the obliquity of the Zodiac and the cycle of the Great Year, and Thales the eclipse of the sun and the variable period of its solstices.

which the year-interval could be gauged); but there is no satisfactory evidence for such a usage.
The information added by Eudemus in 77 and 78, that Thales
predicted solstices and noted that their cycle is not always equal (by which is probably meant the slight variations in length of the
solar seasons, as divided by solstices and equinoxes), is more straightforward. All that would be needed would be a rather long
series of observations with a solstice-marker, a rjAtOTpoTnov of some kind, such as was connected with Pherecydes (48), to mark
the bearings of the sun at its most northerly and southerly points in the year that is, the summer and winter solstices. Alternatively a gnomon or stable vertical rod, by which the length of the sun's
shadow could be exactly recorded, would suffice. This was said by Herodotus to be a Babylonian invention (99), and its introduction was credited to Anaximander and not to Thales (96). However, measurement of shadows was certainly involved in the computation of the height of pyramids ascribed to Thales (p. 83), and one cannot be completely confident that the observation of the sun's
zenith by similar means was unknown to him. The technique seems obvious to us now, and might be thought to have occurred to anyone who had reached Thales' by no means primitive stage of celestial observation. Diogenes (i, 24, DKiiAi) added that Thales discovered the passage of the sun from solstice to solstice,
and the relation of the diameter of sun and moon to their orbits.
The former phrase is very vague, and might imply no more than the knowledge that the sun moves between the tropics which
Thales obviously possessed. But it perhaps refers to the discovery of the inclination of the Zodiac, which Eudemus in 78 probably
ascribed to Oinopides of Chios, over a century later; the assignment of detailed knowledge of the Zodiac to Thales and Pytha
goras in Aetius (n, 12, i, DKn A 13^) is also speculative (see also
p. i03n.). Diogenes' second piece of information is quite anachronistic, for Thales cannot have thought that the heavenly bodies had orbits, since they did not pass under the earth (which

was not made free-swinging until Anaximander) ; at the most they had semi-orbits, and the ratio of diameter to celestial path would be twice that given. 1
1 The determination of this ratio was a recurrent problem in Greek astronomy, which might naturally come to be associated with the earliest
known astronomer. The ratio suggested in Diogenes, i/yaoth, implies a sexagesimal measurement of the circle of the ecliptic such as was adopted by the Babylonians: so A. Wasserstein, JHS 75 (1955) 1 14-16. Cf. Hdt. n, 109 (99) > also n, 4.

This is part of the apocryphal story of the cup (in some versions,
tripod) which had to be presented to the wisest man living : Thales was the first, and in some versions also the final, choice, but he modestly sent it on to Bias, and he to others of the Seven Sages. The 'little stars of the Wain' are the Little Bear (cf. Aratus Phaen.
39, with scholium); this constellation, because its revolution is smaller, provides a more accurate fixed point than the Great Bear
or Wain as a whole (as opposed to the Pole star itself) . (TTCc0iJi3cr6ai
strictly means 'to measure', but sometimes, more vaguely, 'to mark out, define' (Z on Pindar 01. 10, 53). The probable meaning is that Thales defined the Little Bear, and drew the attention of
Milesian sailors to its navigational usefulness. Diogenes Laertius, i,
23, interpreted the lines of Callimachus as meaning simply that Thales ' discovered ' the Little Bear. Ionian sailors may previously
have neglected it, since for all except long open-sea crossings the more conspicuous Great Bear was adequate. Thus the ocoTpoAoylcc, the study of heavenly bodies, mentioned as characteristic of Thales by Plato (74) and Aristotle (75), x seems
to have comprised the following activities: the prediction of eclipses, probably with the aid of Babylonian tables; the measurement of solstices and their variations, possibly undertaken in part
80 . . .for the victory belonged to Thales, who was clever in judgement) not least because he was said to have measured out the little stars of the Wain, by which the Phoenicians sail.

In 81 Hieronymus of Rhodes attributes to Thalcs the simplest
possible method of measuring the height of a pyramid. Thales might conceivably have learned this from the Egyptians; or it is
not impossible that the pyramids were merely local colour, to fit
the tradition of a visit to Egypt. Pliny (N.H. xxxvi, 82, DK 1 1 A 2 1 )
gave the same account, but a more complex variant appears in Plutarch, Sept. Sap. Conv. 2, 147 A (DKiiA2i), that the height of a pyramid is related to the length of its shadow exactly as the height of any mensurable vertical object is related to the length of
its shadow at the same time of day. It is probable, though not
certain, that Hieronymus is here dependent on his near-contem
porary Eudemus (whose book on the history of geometry and mathematics, as opposed to his history of astronomy, Diogenes himself does not appear to have used for Thalcs) ; if so, there is a
probability that Thales used the simpler method. On the other hand, the more complex one is based on an argument from similar triangles analogous to that ascribed to him by Eudemus in 82, as a means of measuring the distance of ships out at sea. Provided the height of the observer above sea level were known, this calculation could be made with the aid of a primitive theodolite, two
sticks (one as a sight-line, the other as an approximate level-line)
81 Hieronymus says that he [Thales] actually measured the pyramids by their shadow, having observed the time when our own shadow is equal to our height.
82 Eudemus in the History of geometry refers this theorem to Thales; for the method by which they say he demonstrated the distance of ships out at sea must, he says, have entailed the use of this theorem.

pivoting on a nail. It is to be observed that Eudemus only credited
Thales with a knowledge of similar triangles on the a priori ground that he could not otherwise have performed this kind of calcula
tion. Yet a man may make an empirical use of a rudimentary
angle-measurer without forming an explicit theory about the
principles involved, and certainly without stating those principles as a geometer. 1 Three other theorems attributed to Thales
by Proclus following Eudemus, in the same commentary as 82 (DKiiAii), circle bisected by diameter; angles at base of
isosceles triangle are equal; vertically opposed angles are equal are, again, probably just the neatest abstract solutions of particular practical problems associated with Thales. All this is very much a
matter for conjecture : my own guess would be that Thales did gain
a reputation with his contemporaries for carrying out various far from straightforward empirical feats of mensuration, without
necessarily stating the geometry that lay behind them. This is perhaps confirmed by the fact that Thales' Milesian successors
seem to have paid little attention to mathematical theory.
1 Burnet, EGP^L 9 observed that a knowledge of the Egyptian seqt ratio
(a trigonometrical approximation) could have produced a solution of both problems. In view of the possibility of Thales' acquaintance with Egypt, and his analogous use (it is assumed) of an empirical Babylonian formula, this explanation can by no means be excluded. Pamphile's report in
Diog, L. i, 24 that Thales inscribed a right-angled triangle in a circle ' and
sacrificed an ox' (cf. 281) is entertaining, if not convincing.

These passages show that there was profound doubt in antiquity about Thales' written works. It is plain, at all events, that there was no work by him in the Alexandrian library, except the dubious 'Nautical Star-guide' (cf. also 98). Aristotle appears not to have
seen any book by him, at least on cosmological matters; he was
extremely cautious in ascribing opinions to him, using the expressions 'deriving the supposition perhaps from. . .', 'the account which they say Thales gave' (87, 86), and 'from what they relate* (91). Aristotle was not necessarily conscientious in using original
sources; Theophrastus, as a professed historian of earlier philosophy, should have been conscientious (though he was not always so, in fact), but he evidently had little to add to Aristotle about Thales (except for the minor amendment implied by the con
jecture in 83 that Thales did have predecessors). Eudemus made some positive assertions about Thales as geometer and astronomer (77, 78, 82), but we have seen on 82 that these were sometimes very
speculative ; they were perhaps partly based on the quasi-legendary biographical tradition, and do not imply that Eudemus had seen written works by Thales. Diogenes' doubt in 84 about the 'Nautical Star-guide' was
shared by Plutarch, de Pyth. or. 18, 402 E (DKiiBi), who added
that the work in question was in verse ; we may thus conjecture that this was the verse work described by Hesychius in 85 as irepl
|jTcbpcov. Lobon of Argos (a disreputable stichometrist of the second century B.C.), according to Diog. L. i, 34, said that Thales wrote 200 hexameters. Only mild suspicion is expressed in 83,
where any uncertainty implied by KaAoujaevrjs is perhaps restricted to the nature of the title. But this last sentence almost certainly
contains Simplicius' own judgement and not that of Theophrastus,
the paraphrase of whom seems to end before AeyeToci. Diogenes'
Little Bear, and wrote asfollows in his Iambs. . . [80, 11. 3-4]; while according to some
he wrote only two works, On the solstice and On the equinox, considering the rest to
be incomprehensible. 85 . . . he wrote on celestial matters in epic verse, on the equinox, and much else.
85



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
information in 84, that the work was also ascribed to one Phokos of Samos, almost settles the matter: any astronomical work of archaic
appearance might naturally be ascribed to Thales, but works
actually by Thales would not be alternatively ascribed to men of
comparative obscurity. It is possible that the c Nautical star-guide
'
was a genuine sixth-century work similar to the hexameter 'AorpoAoyicc of Cleostratus of Tenedos (DK ch. 6) or the so-called Hesiodic 'AaTpovopiri (DK ch. 4) : so Diels and others have assumed. It is also possible that it was a Hellenistic forgery. Diogenes in 84 is a little worried by Callimachus3 mention in 80 of a particular nautical star-aid ascribed to Thales ; but this need
not have been described by Thales in writing. However, there is
nothing inherently improbable in Thales having recorded such
aids to navigation, a plausible enough activity for a practical sage in a maritime centre: but it was probably not in the 'Nautical Star-guide' known to the Hellenistic world that he did so. The other works mentioned in 84, on the solstice and the equinox (only the latter in 85), are unlikely, from their similar contents, to have been separate books. Simplicius in 83, and those recorded in 84
who thought that Thales left no book, evidently did not accept this work as genuine. Thales studied the solstices according to Eudemus in 77 and 78, and it would be on the ground of this known interest that such a work would be ascribed to him. Once again, however, it must be remembered that observations of
solstices and of star-risings and -settings were widely made in the
archaic period, and also set down in verse, partly in the attempt to establish a satisfactory calendar: see Cleostratus fr. 4 (DK6B4) and the Hesiodic Astronomy (DK.4B 1-5). Observations about the Hyades and the setting of the Pleiades were also attributed to
Thales (S on Aratus 172, Pliny N.H. xvm, 213; DK 1 1 B 2, 1 1 A 1 8) ; the latter observation, incidentally, was accurate for the latitude of Egypt, not that of Greece. The evidence does not allow a certain conclusion, but the probability is that Thales did not write a book; though the ancient holders of this view might have been misled by the absence of a genuine work from the Alexandrian library, and also by the
apophthegmatic nature of the wisdom assigned to the Seven Sages
in general.

86 Others say that the earth rests on water. For this is the most ancient account we have re
ceived, which they say was given by Tholes the Milesian, that it stays in place throughfloating like a log or some other such thing (for none of these rests by nature on air, but on water] as though the same argument did not apply to the water supporting the earth as to the earth itself.
87 Most of thefirst philosophers thought that principles in theform ofmatter were the only principles of all things: for the original source of all existing things, thatfrom which a thing first comes-into-being andinto which it isfinally destroyed, the substancepersisting butchanging in its qualities, this they declare is the element andfirstprinciple ofexisting things, andfor this reason they consider that there is no absolute coming-to-be or passing away, on the ground that such a nature is alwayspreserved . . .for there must be some natural substance, either one or more
than one, from which the other things come-into-being, while it ispreserved. Over the number, however, and theform of this kind ofprinciple they do not all agree; but Thales, thefounder of this type of philosophy, says that it is water (and therefore declared that the earth is on
water), perhaps taking this suppositionfrom seeing the nurture of all things to be moist, and the warm itself coming-to-be from this and living by this (that from which they come-to-be being the principle of all things) taking the supposition both from this andfrom the seeds of all things having a moist nature, water being the natural principle of moist things.
87



PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Our knowledge of Thales' cosmology depends virtually completely on these two passages, with the cryptic addition of 91-93. Apart
from Aristotle's own criticism and conjecture, they assign two
propositions to Thales: (i) the earth floats on water (like a piece
of wood or something of the sort) ; (2) the 'principle' of all things is water (in Aristotle's sense of (Scpx^! as explained in the first half of 87, i.e. the original constituent material of things, which persists as a substratum and into which they will perish), (i) was professedly known to Aristotle only indirectly, on the information of
others; further, it is impossible to tell whether the supporting argument (solid things do not rest on air, but they do on water, therefore the earth floats on water) was also derived from the
reports of Thales, or whether it was entirely supplied by Aristotle. His final objection, that Thales has solved nothing because he would still have to find something to support the water that supports the earth, shows how little Aristotle understood the probable nature of Thales' way of thinking : Thales would almost
certainly still accept the popular conception of the earth (or, in this case, its immediate support) stretching downward indefinitely, as
in Homer (i), and still in Xenophanes (3) almost a century later than Thales. The probable direct origin of Thales' idea of the earth floating on water was from non-Greek mythological accounts (pp. 90 f.) ; the device might have attracted him in part because it
provided support for the earth, but it is by no means certain that Thales felt this to be a serious problem, and most improbable in any case that he worked out the theory for himself as a conscious
answer to that problem. As for proposition (2), Aristotle evidently knew nothing beyond what he wrote, since the reasons given for
Thales' choice of water are professedly conjectural (Acc[3<i>v TCFCOS. . .). The first half of 87 is quoted to show the kind of analysis and terminology which Aristotle (and following him Theo
phrastus 1 and thus the subsequent doxographical tradition) applied to the early physicists or natural philosophers, the cpvcriKoi those who, according to Aristotle, posited solely, or primarily, the first (material) of his four causes. His application of a single
rigid analysis to his predecessors, while justly and usefully emphasizing certain resemblances between them, is also a source of con
fusion. Thus Thales' 'principle' (in Aristotle's sense) and Hera
clitus' 'principle' (fire according to Aristotle) were clearly, for Thales and for Heraclitus themselves, very different kinds of thing.
88



THALES
In fact, all we know about Thales' views on water (apart from that
the earth floats on it) is that, in a hearsay and probably much abbreviated and somewhat distorted form, they appeared to the
not over-discriminating Aristotle to fit his own idea of a material
dpxr|. Yet it is possible, contrary to Aristotle's automatic assumption, that Thales declared earth to come from water (i.e. to be solidified out of it in some way) without therefore thinking that the earth and its contents are somehow water, that they have any continuing relation to it (beyond the fact that the earth floats on
water) except that of a man to his remote ancestors: for Thales, we may conjecture, was still to some extent influenced by the genea
logical view of cosmogony best exemplified in Hesiod (24) . See
further pp. 92 f.
1 Theophrastus' abbreviated account of Thales' material principle is
given by Simplicius, Phys. p. 23, 21 Diels (=Thcophr. Phys. Op. fr. i),
DK 1 1 A 1 3. It is a close parallel of Aristotle in 87, using in many parts the
same phraseology. It adds one more conjectural reason for Thales' choice
of water, that corpses dry up (TOC vexpounevoc ^pafveToci) : this perhaps
came from Hippon (see next n.), who is probably credited with a similar argument in Anon. Lond. XT, 22 (DK.38AH), i.e. in a Peripatetic source.
The addition occurs also in Aetius.
The reasons conjectured by Aristotle in 87 for the importance attached by Thales to water as a constituent of things are mainly
physiological. 1 From the analogy of his immediate successors we
might have expected Thales to have adduced meteorological reasons, more conspicuously, in support of the cosmic importance of water.2 Yet we must beware of exaggerated generalizations like that implied in Burnet's view that sixth-century thinkers were
almost exclusively interested in meteorological (in the strict sense, including astronomical) phenomena. It is undoubtedly true that the scientific study of medicine began in the fifth century B.C., and
that analogies between the world and details of human structure become much commoner then. Yet chapter i has shown the strongly
genealogical colouring of much pre-philosophical Greek speculation, and also the importance of the analogy of physiological reproduction. In the case of Thales there are reasons for thinking that his explanation of the world was influenced not only by this
variegated traditional background of earlier Greek quasi-mythological cosmogonical versions, but also by a specific cosmological idea derived directly, perhaps, from further east.
89



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
1 It seems more probable than not that Aristotle took them from Hippon
of Samos (or of Rhegium, Crotori, or Metapontium), who in the second
half of the fifth century B.C. revived and modified the idea of water as constituent material of things. Hippon, whose intellect Aristotle did not
admire, evidently had strong physiological interests. Cf. in particular 88

Note that there is a good deal of conjecture in this, too. Against the assumption that Aristotle's conjectured reasons for Thales' choice of water were derived from Hippon is that the additional
reason given in Theophrastus (see previous note) probably did come from Hippon, and might therefore have been expected to be included by Aristotle.

These reasons certainly stem
from a Stoic source there is much Stoic phraseology and may well be
entirely conjectural. According to Theophrastus, evidently, Thales used water and its products to explain earthquakes (90: this depends on the special conception that the earth rests on water), also winds and movements of stars (Hippolylus Ref. i, i) ; but these would scarcely provide the reason for Thales adopting the theory in the first place.
The near-eastern origin of part of Thales' cosmology is indicated
by his conception that the earth floats or rests on water. In Egypt the earth was commonly conceived as a flat, rimmed dish resting upon water, which also filled the sky ; the sun sailed each day across the sky in a boat, and also sailed under the earth each night (not
round it, as in the Greek legend, e.g. 7). In the Babylonian
creation-epic Apsu and Tiamat represent the primeval waters, and
Apsu remains as the waters under the earth after Marduk has split
the body of Tiamat to form sky (with its waters) and earth. In the
story of Eridu (seventh century B.C. in its youngest extant version),
88 Of the cruder thinkers some actually declared it (sc. the soul) to be water, like
Hippon; they seem to have been persuaded by the seed of all things being moist. In fact he refutes tfiose who say that the soul is blood; because the seed is not blood.
89 For moist natural substance, since it is easily formed into each different thing, is accustomed to undergo very various changes: that part of it which is exhaled is made into air, and the finest part is kindledfrom ait into aither, while when water is compacted and changes into slime it becomes earth. Therefore Thales declared that water, of the four
elements, was the most active, ai it were, as a cause.



THALES
in the beginning 'all land was sea 5
; then Marduk built a raft on the surface of the water, and on the raft a reed-hut which became the earth. An analogous view is implied in the Psalms (where also Leviathan is an analogue of Tiamat), whereJahweh 'stretched out the earth above the waters' (136, 6), 'founded it upon the
seas, and established it upon the floods' (24, 2). Similarly Tehom is 'the deep that lieth under' (Gen. xlix. 25), 'the deep that
coucheth beneath' (Deut. xxxiii. I3). 1 Against this profusion of
parallel material, from the cast and south-cast, for the waters under the earth, there is no comparable Greek material apart from Thalcs. The naive Greek conception of a river Okeanos surrounding
the earth (ch. i 2) is not strictly comparable (for it is clear that there is no Okeanos under the earth), although it was probably a
much earlier development, in a different direction, of the widelydiffused near-eastern generic concept of the earth rising in the midst of the primeval waters a concept almost certainly not
native to the Greek-speaking peoples, whose home before the migrations into the Greek peninsula lay far from the sea. Similarly, although the isolated references in Iliad book 14 (9 and 10)
to Okeanos as origin of all things were also probably based upon the same near-eastern concept, from a slightly different aspect, they contain no implication of the special idea that the earth floats on water, and so are unlikely to have been the origin of Thalcs'
assertion of this idea. For any more general contention that the earth came from, or is maintained by, water, Thales would no
doubt be encouraged and gratified to have the apparently native Homeric precedents. Thus Thales' view that the earth floats on water seems to have been most probably based upon direct contact
with near-eastern mythological cosmology. We have already seen that he had associations both with Babylonia and with Egypt. The idea that the earth actually floats upon water was more clearly and more widely held in the latter of these countries; and the conjecture might be hazarded that Thales was indebted to Egypt for
this element of his world-picture.3
1 These instances are cited by U. Holschcr in his convincing discussion of
Thales, Hermes 81 (1953) 385-91. Some of the material is treated in ch. i, especially pp. laff. For the idea of Nun, the Egyptian primeval ocean, supporting the earth, see also the remarks of H. Frankfort, Before Philosophy 59 ff. and Ancient Egyptian Religion (New York, 1948) 114. 2 This was, indeed, the opinion of later Greek critics about the origin of
91



PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Thales' ideas on water in general : cf. Plutarch in 70 (who was acquainted with the Nun-myth), and, less dogmatically, Simplicius de caelo 522, 14 (DK 1 1 A 14). Both, however, are conjectural judgements.
Thales evidently used the floating-earth idea to explain earthquakes :
90 Seneca Qu. Nat. m, 1 4 (presumably from Theophrastus, through a Posidonian source) : ait enim (sc. Thales) terrarum orbem aqua sustineri et vehi more navigii mobilitatequc eius fluctuare tune
cum dicitur tremere.
The cosmological scope of the idea is, however, limited; and it seems reasonable to conclude from Aristotle's information in 87
that Thales also thought that the world originated from water, since this is implicit in the near-eastern mythologies and is stated in the Homeric Okeanos-passages which are thought to be based on those mythologies. Thales may have rationalized the idea from a Greek mythological form like the Homeric one ; he may also have been directly influenced (as he seems to have been for the special detail
that the earth floats on water) by foreign, perhaps Egyptian versions. Even more uncertainty attaches to a problem that has
already been foreshadowed : arc we justified in inferring from the Peripatetic identification of Thales' water as ' material principle
'
that he believed the visible, developed world to be water in some way? This is the normal interpretation of Thales ; but it is im
portant to realize that it rests ultimately on the Aristotelian
formulation, and that Aristotle, knowing little about Thales, and that indirectly, would surely have found the mere information that
the world originated from water sufficient justification for saying that water was Thales' material principle or ccpxru with the
implication that water is a persistent substrate. It must be emphasized once more that no such development was necessary, and that it was not implicit in the near-eastern concepts which were ultimately Thales' archetype. Thales might have held that the world
originated from an indefinite expanse1 of primeval water, on which it still floats and which is still responsible for certain natural
phenomena, without also believing that earth, rocks, trees or men are in any way made ofwater or a form of water. There would be a
remote ancestral connexion, no more. On the other hand Thales
90 For he [Thales] said that the world is held up by water and rides like a ship, and when it is said to 'quake
9 it is actually rocking because of the water 9s movement.
92



THALES
could have made the entirely new inference that water is the
continuing, hidden constituent of all things. Certainly his near successor Anaximenes believed that all things were made of air (but he had thought of a way in which this could be so : air takes on
different forms when compressed or rarefied), and it is invariably assumed that he was extending and refining a line of thought
initiated by Thales. It would be imprudent entirely to reject this
assumption, which goes back to Theophrastus and Aristotle. The
physiological reasons instanced by Aristotle, that all living things depend on water for nourishment, that the sperm is moist, and so on, although conjectural, are of a kind that might well have struck Thales. With other indications (e.g. the Homeric statement that
the surrounding Okeanos is the source of all springs and rivers, 5) they could have led him to the conclusion that water, as well as
being the cosmogonical source, is also involved in the very essence
of the developed world. On the other hand, one must remain
aware of the possibility that Aristotle was simply making his own kind of inference, in the absence of other information, from Thales' belief that the world originated from water and that water still
plays a major part in the cosmos by supporting the earth.
1 Thales would have accepted Simplicius* judgement (Phys. 458, 23,
DK 1 1 A 13) that water was, for him, cnreipov; though for Thales this would
mean 'limitless', i.e. of indefinite extent, and not *
infinite', and be a natural assumption rather than a consciously propounded theory. Simplicius was more seriously misleading in asserting (Phys. 180, 14) that
Thales, like Anaximenes, generated by means of the condensation and rarefaction of his material principle. This is a purely schematic judgement
based on an over-rigid dichotomy in Aristotle (106). Theophrastus only found the device explicitly used in Anaximenes: see 145.
Two things, then, have emerged from the present discussion: (i) 'all things are water' is not necessarily a reliable summary of
Thales' cosmological views; and (ii) even if we do accept Aristotle's
account (with some allowance, in any event, for his inevitably altered viewpoint), we have little idea of how things were felt to be essentially related to water.
(ii) Even apparently inanimate things can be ' alive '; the world isfull ofgods

The two passages from Aristotle's de anima allow us to conjecture, but no more, about Thales' vision of the whole world as somehow alive and animated. Aristotle himself was reporting second-hand evidence, and his statements are jejune and cautious (although in
91 enrep need not, and probably does not, express doubt, while
icrcos in 93 qualifies 60ev and not the assertion that follows). The
concluding words of 93, 'all things are full of gods', occur also in Plato, in a probably conscious but unattributed quotation. 1
92 cites the sophist and polymath Hippias as an earlier source than Aristotle for Thales' attribution of motive power to Magnesian
(magnetic) stone, to which is added amber, which becomes
magnetic when rubbed. Presumably the addition is from Hippias,
who may well have been Aristotle's source here. 2

Oecov elvoct -rrAfipri TT&VTOC; The context deals with souls being called gods, but contains no explicit reference to Thales. It is quite in Plato's style to
introduce, rather laboriously, a familiar phrase to enlighten an unfamiliar argument of his own, without naming the author. His use of the words in question is important, in any case, because it shows that they are not simply an Aristotelian summary. They could (in direct speech) be a genuine quotation from Thales; they have a totally different appearance from the banal apophthegms hopefully assigned to Thales in Demetrius of Phaleron's collection (ap. Stob. in, i, 172, DKio, 3). Aristotle repeated them, with the substitution of yVXTJS for Oecov and without attribution, at G.A. fii, 762a2i. 2 Should we conceivably read 'Hippon 5 for 'Hippias', cf. 88 etc.? There is evidence of some confusion in later antiquity about the form of Hippon's
name (as there was considerable doubt about his city) : he appeared as
* Hipponax ' in the sources for Aetius (DK 38 A 1 4) . But Hippias could have
known and written about Thales, and in the present state of the evidence must obviously be accepted.
92 Aristotle and Hippias say that he gave a share ofsoul even to inanimate [lit. soulless] objects, using Magnesian stone and amber as indications.
93 And some say that it [soul] is intermingled in the universe, for which reason, perhaps, Thales also thought that all things are full of gods. 94 Is there anyone who will accept this and maintain that all things are not full of
gods?
94



THALES
All that Aristotle seems to have known in 91 was that Thales
thought that magnetic stone possesses soul because it is able to move iron ; but the further inference, that for Thales the soul was
something motive, is clearly legitimate. Soul, whether it was associated with breath, blood, or spinal fluid, was universally
regarded as the source of consciousness and life. A man is alive, he can move his limbs and so move other things; if he faints, it means that his soul has withdrawn or become incapacitated; if he dies, it
has become permanently so, and the 'soul' that goes squeaking
down to Hades in Homer is a mere shadow, because it is dissociated from the body and can no longer produce life and movement. It is
a common primitive tendency to regard rivers, trees and so on as somehow animated or inhabited by spirits : this is partly, though not wholly, because they seem to possess the faculty of self-movement and change, they differ from mere stocks and stones. Thales' attitude was not primitive, of course, but there is a connexion with
that entirely unphilosophical animism. It should be noted, however, that his examples are of a different order: magnetic stone looks as unalivc as could be, and cannot move or change itself, only a certain kind of external object. Thus Thales appears to have made
explicit, in an extreme form, a way of thinking that permeated Greek mythology but whose ultimate origins were almost pre
articulate. Now it is possible that our second piece of specific
information, 93, is a generalization based on this very conclusion that certain kinds of apparently inanimate object are alive, possess soul, because they have a limited power of movement. 'All things
are full of gods 5
: 1 the chief distinguishing marks of the gods are
that they are immortal, they enjoy perpetual life, and that their power (their life-force, as it were) is unlimited, it extends both over the animate and over the inanimate world. Thus the assertion
may well imply (since even apparently dead things like stone may possess soul of a kind) that the world as a whole manifests a power
of change and motion which is certainly not even predominantly human, and must, both because of its permanence and because of
its extent and variation, be regarded as divine, as due to the
inherence of some form of immortal

8uvantv Oefav KivrjTiK^v OUTOU. The juxtaposition of the two statements
from Aristotle is not significant. The last sentence is Stoic in form and content; the first clause (GccAfjs. . .$EOV), too, is entirely anachronistic, and probably due to Stoic reinterpretation. It was repeated by Cicero, JV.Z). i,
10, 25, who added that god, as mind, made the world out of water.
A considerable number of recognizably fictitious opinions, like this one, were attributed to Thales by puzzled or unscrupulous doxographers and biographers. Compare, perhaps, the 30,000 daimons of Hesiod Erga 252 ff. a The claim by Choerilus of lasus (3rd-2nd c. B.C.) and others, recorded in Diog. L. i, 24 (DKiiAi), that according to Thales the soul was immortal, obviously arose as an illegitimate conclusion from this kind of
argument, and is again due to Stoic perversion (primarily) of the type of
95. Thales could have distinguished clearly between the human yUXT*| and
the divine life-force in the world as a whole, at the same time as implicitly recognizing their underlying connexion.
The precise nature of Thales' belief that all things are full of gods
is obviously not determinable. Even along the line of interpretation suggested above there is one notable uncertainty : did Thales make the bold induction, from the observation about Magnesian
stone and amber, that all apparently inanimate things really
possess soul to some degree? Or was Burnet right in maintaining (EGP 50) that c to say the magnet and amber are alive is to imply,
if anything, that other things are not'? Formally this is an
illegitimate contention (since only a part of what Thales said is
known), and in itself the fragmentary observation implies nothing either way. Nor docs the assertion that all things are full of gods, even if it is closely connected with the observation about magnetic stone, necessarily imply that the universal induction was made;
for just as one can say in English 'this book is full of absurdities'
without meaning that every single thing in it is absurd, so TrAf|pr|s
in Greek could mean '
containing a great number of, as well as
*
absolutely filled out by'. A priori, it perhaps seems more probable that Thales meant that all things in sum (rather than each single
thing) were interpenetrated by some kind of life-principle ; although there would be many kinds of matter from which this life-principle,
with its kinetic power, might be absent. The point was that the
range of soul, or of life, was much greater than it appeared to be. Thales was giving an explicit and individual statement of a broad
presupposition common to all the early physicists, that the world
andfull of daimons; right through the elemental moisture there penetrates a divine power that moves it.
96



THALES
somehow alive, that it underwent spontaneous change, and 'what irritated Aristotle) that there was therefore no need to give
my special account of natural change. This presupposition is still
lometimes called 'hylozoism'; but this name implies too strongly
.hat it is something uniform, determinable, and conscious. In fact ,he term applies to at least three possible and distinct attitudes of
nind: (a) the assumption (conscious or not) that all things ibsolutely are in some way alive ; (b) the belief that the world is
nterpenetrated by life, that many of its parts which appear nanimate arc in fact animate ; (c) the tendency to treat the world
is a whole, whatever its detailed constitution, as a single living
organism, (a) is an extreme, but in view of the universalizing .endency of Greek thought not an impossible, form of the general Dresupposition; in a way it might be said to be exemplified by Xenophanes. Thales' belief, it has been suggested, approaches :loser to (b). (c) is implicit in the old genealogical view of the
world's history described in chapter i, which still persisted to a arge extent under the new rationalized form of philosophical
:osmogony. Aristotle is seen at his most perspicuous in 118, where, Derhaps with Thales especially in mind, he shows himself aware of
:he possibility of this kind of attitude. 1
1 The spears in the Iliad (i i, 574 etc.) which arc 'eager to devour flesh', and other similar cases, are sometimes cited as an indication that the
animistic view was an old one. Animism is, of course, as old as man himself, and it arises out of the failure to objectify one's experience of the
outside world, a technique which requires some practice. The Homeric expressions are better described as a literary conceit, like the pathetic fallacy a deliberate rejection of the technique.
CONCLUSION
Fhales was chiefly known for his prowess as a practical astronomer,
geometer, and sage in general. His prediction of the eclipse was Drobably made feasible by his use of Babylonian records, perhaps
obtained at Sardis; he also probably visited Egypt. His theory Jhat the earth floats on water seems to have been derived from
icar-eastern cosmogonical myths, perhaps directly; water as the )rigin of things was also a part of these myths, but had been menioned in a Greek context long before Thales. His development of his concept may in itself have seemed to Aristotle sufficient
warrant for saying that Thales held water to be the (ScpX1^ *n its Peripatetic sense of a persisting substrate. Yet Thales could indeed
7 97 K*R



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
have felt that since water is essential for the maintenance of plant
and animal life we do not know what meteorological arguments he used it remains still as the basic constituent of things. Although
these ideas were strongly affected, directly or indirectly, by mythological precedents, Thales evidently abandoned mythic formulations: this alone justifies the claim that he was the first philosopher,
naive though his thought still was. Further, he noticed that even certain kinds of stone could have a limited power of movement and
therefore, he thought, of life-giving soul ; the world as a whole, consequently, was somehow permeated (though probably not completely) by a life-force which might naturally, because of its extent and its persistence, be called divine. Whether he associated
this life-force with water, the origin and perhaps the essential constituent of the world, we are not told. The concluding word must be that the evidence for Thales' cosmology is too slight and
too imprecise for any of this to be more than speculative; what has been aimed at is reasonable speculation.

96 Anaximander son ofPraxiades, of Miletus: he said that the principle and element is
the Indefinite, not distinguishing air or water or anything else... he was the fast to discover a gnomon, and he set one up on the Sundials (?) in Sparta, according to Favorinus in his Universal history, to mark solstices and equinoxes; and he also constructed hourindicators. He fast drew an outline of earth and sea, but he also constructed a (celestial)
globe. Of his opinions he made a summary exposition, which I suppose Apollodorus the Athenian, also, encountered. Apollodorus says in his Chronicles that Anaximander was
sixty-four years old in the secondyear of thefifty-eighth Olympiad, and that he died shortly afterwards (having been near his prime approximately during the time of Polycrates, tyrant of Samos). 97 Anaximander son of Praxiades, of Miletus, philosopher, was a kinsman, pupil and
successor of Thales. He first discovered the equinox and solstices and hour-indicators, and that the earth lies in the centre. He introduced the gnomon and in general made known an
outline of geometry. He wrote On nature, Circuit of the earth and On the fixed stars and a Celestial globe and some other works.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
(i) Date
If Thales earned the title of the first Greek philosopher mainly because of his abandonment of mythological formulations, Anaxi
mander is the first of whom we have concrete evidence that he
made a comprehensive and detailed attempt to explain all aspects
of the world of man's experience. He was younger than Thales, but probably not by much. Burnet (EGP 51) inferred from the
latter part of 96 that the chronographer Apollodorus found definite evidence, perhaps in a summary version of his book, that Anaximander was sixty-four in 547/6 B.C.; and that his death 'soon
afterwards 5 was placed by Apollodorus in the next year, the epochyear of the capture of Sardis. (The last clause of 96 is presumably a mistake: Polycrates did not come to power until ca. 540 B.C. and died ca. 522.) If this is so, then Thales and Anaximander died in the same Olympiad, and Anaximander was only fourteen years younger than Thales (n. on p. 74) . x Anaximander was called the
'successor and pupil' of Thales by Theophrastus (103 A), also his
kinsman, companion, acquaintance or fellow-citizen in the later doxographical tradition. In most cases this kind of statement need only imply that the one was thought to come from the same city as, and to be somewhat younger than, the other.2 If there were fixed dates both for Thales (the prediction of the eclipse in 585/4) and for Anaximander (for the information that he was sixty-four in
547/6 was presumably available also to Theophrastus), the a priori basis for Theophrastus' conjecture would be a reasonable one.
1 That Thales and Anaximander are not separated by the conventional
Apollodoran 4o-year interval (see next note) is in favour of 547/6 being a
non-arbitrary date. It is true that, if Anaximander could be made the master of Pythagoras, then his birth should be eighty years earlier than the latter'& floruit (which Apollodorus placed in 532/1), and he would be very close to 64 (in fact 65) in 547/6. According to the evidence of Hippolytus (Ref. i, 6, 7, DKi2Aii) even Apollodorus was wrong by one year, since Hippolytus gives the birth-year as Ol. 42, 3 (610/9 B - G -) instead of Ol. 42, 2.
What is significant, however, is that Anaximander's age was known for a
particular year which was not his floruit and not necessarily that of his death, although it was close to his death. Further, no connexion of
Pythagoras with Anaximander is known in the great majority of our sources (only in Porphyry V.P. 2, after the imaginative 3rd-century B.C. biographer Neanthes of Gyzicus, and in Apuleius, Florida 15, 20). Nevertheless, the possibility cannot be entirely excluded that Apollodorus' dating of Anaximander was arbitrarily hinged to his Polycrates-Pythagoras system. This might help to account for the last clause of 96.
IOO



ANAXIMANDER
2 The arrangement of the early philosophers into 'schools', and into masters and pupils within these schools, was initiated by Theophrastus and systematically applied in the Successions of Sotion, ca. 200 B.C. Apollodorus
used the latter work, and normally assumed a 4o-ycar interval in age
between master and pupil.
(ii) Anaximander's book
The book-titles ascribed to Anaximandcr in 97, presumably from Hesychius, should be regarded with reserve. It was the custom with Alexandrian writers to supply titles, in the absence of definite
evidence, to suit an early thinker's known interests. 'On nature'
was a standard comprehensive title which tended to be assigned to
all those whom Aristotle called 9vyaiKof, that is, to almost all the Presocratics. 1 That Anaximander certainly wrote a book of some kind is shown both by Theophrastus' incontrovertible quotation in 103 A, and possibly by Diogenes' information in 96 that there was
a 'summary exposition', which he took to be by the philosopher
himself. What Diogenes knew of may have been a later summary
(produced cither by a pupil or, more probably, in the fourth century B.C. or later) ; or it may have been the original work, whose short, perhaps discontinuous, and apophthegmatic nature was not
what was normally expected of a philosophical book.2 It is not clear whether it was from this source that Apollodorus determined the year in which Anaximander was sixty-four; it seemed probable
to Diogenes, though that age is considerably greater than the
average for authorship. The elder Pliny (N.H. 11, 31, DKi2A5) stated that Anaximander discovered the obliquity of the Zodiac in
this same Olympiad, the fifty-eighth; but the ascription of this discovery is probably false (p. 10311.), and Pliny perhaps merely misapplied Apollodorus' dating. Diogenes' term irepi^TUxev, 'came upon', might imply that the so-called summary exposition was a rarity in Apollodorus' time. Theophrastus, almost two centuries before, had access to at least one original sentence, but seems to have lacked full information about Anaximander's originative substance. The possibility cannot be ignored that he, too, used a
summary or handbook, partly at least in the form of a collection of excerpts, and one which concentrated on cosmology, anthropology and so on rather than on the nature of the parent-material.
On the other hand, Anaximander himself might have offered little information on the originative substance.

Thales was thought not to have written a book, at any rate one of a general
cosmological kind: see pp. 85 ff. One of the objections to Hepl 9uaecos as
a genuine sixth-century book-title is that <p\jc\$ is probably not used in the collective sense, 'Nature', before about the middle of the fifth century (cf. Kirk, Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments, aayfF.). Gorgias' sardonic title

his time, but no more than that. On the other hand, the addition of a word like xpTlH&Tcov or dirdvTCov to 9ucrecos would make the usage possible. The
fact remains that TTepl 9uaeco$ was indiscriminately applied to any work of
a vaguely physical nature: cf. e.g. pp. i66f., for Xenophanes' poetry.
2 We do not know how many words a papyrus roll is likely to have held
in the sixth century B.C. The letters were probably large (papyrus should
have been relatively cheap in Miletus, from Naucratis), and the total product quite short. See p. 266 for an estimate of the length of Parmenides'
poem; and p. 366 and n. 2 for Anaxagoras* book.
(iii) Scientific activities: (a) the gnomon
Anaximander did not discover the gnomon, as 96 claims (the
gnomon is a set-square or any vertical rod whose shadow indicates the sun's direction and height) : compare

97 may be correct, nevertheless, in suggesting that Anaximander
introduced the gnomon into Greece. We cannot be sure, however, that Thales did not use some form of the instrument (p. 8 1 ) , and it is
possible that Anaximander gained the credit by accident, or
because his use of the gnomon was more conspicuous. No special discoveries involving its use were assigned to him which were not also assigned to Thales; but he may have gained notoriety by the
incident referred to by Favorinus in 96. The statement that
Anaximander set up a gnomon in Sparta eirt TCOV oKio0f|pcov is
mysterious. A aKioOrjpov (or oKioOfipris) was a sun-dial, but the prepositional phrase cannot mean anything like 'for a sun-dial' or
* for the benefit of the sun-dials', and the suggestion might be made
that there was a prominence in Sparta later known as * the sundials ', from the gnomon or gnomons that existed there; Sirf, then,
would be local. cbpoaKoirsTa in 96 and obpoAoysia in 97 imply that
98 (Anaximander) was the first of the Greeks whom we know who ventured to produce a written account on nature.
99 The Greeks learnedfrom the Babylonians of the celestial sphere and the gnomon and the twelve parts of the day.
I O2



ANAXIMANDER
the ground near the gnomon was calibrated so as to give the time of day, as well as the position of the sun on the ecliptic and so the season of the year. For another association of Anaximander with
Sparta see n. on p. 104.*
1 Pliny, N.H. n, 187 (DK 13 A 140), held that it was Anaximenes who first demonstrated in Sparta the 'horologium quod appellant sciothericon ',
and who discovered the use of the gnomon. This is probably a mistake by
Pliny, who tended to confound his facts in writing about early astronomy.
He attributed the discovery of the obliquity of the Zodiac to Anaximander (p. 101), but Eudemus in 78 probably assigned this to Oinopides. The full comprehension of the ecliptic doubtless belonged to the fifth century; that
the sun moves from north to south and back was known much earlier and certainly, for example, by Thales.

These passages are obviously based on the same one statement by
Eratosthenes, as is Diogenes' remark in 96 that 'Anaximander first drew an outline of land and sea'. Diogenes' addition, 'but he also constructed a sphere' (that is, a map of the heaven), is unsubstantiated and, in the light of Anaximander's theory of the
heavenly bodies (pp. i35ff.)> improbable. The general nature of his map may perhaps be inferred from the following passage :

100 Anaximander the Milesian, a disciple of Thales, first dared to draw the inhabited world on a tablet; after him Hecataeus the Milesian, a much-travelled man, made the map more accurate, so that it became a source of wonder.
101 . . . Eratosthenes says that thefirst tofollow Homer were two, Anaximander, who was an acquaintance and fellow-citizen of Thales, and Hecataeus the Milesian. The former was thefirst to publish a geographical map, while Hecataeus left behind a drawing believed to be his from the rest of his writings.

It is a reasonable assumption that the (probably Ionian) maps referred to here resembled that of Anaximander as improved by his fellow-citizen Hecataeus; and therefore that Anaximander
produced a circular plan in which the known regions of the world
formed roughly equal segments. His empirical knowledge of
geography was presumably based in part on seafarers' reports, which in Miletus, as a commercial centre and founder of colonies, would be both accessible and varied. The philosopher himself was
said to have led a colonizing expedition to Apollonia (the city on the Black Sea, presumably), cf. Aelian V.H. m, 17 (DKi2A3).
Otherwise his only known foreign contacts are with Sparta, 1
1 Apart from the sun-indicator story in 96, Cicero related (de divinat. i, 50,
112, DK 12 A 5 a) that Anaximander warned the Spartans to move into the
fields when an earthquake was imminent. One is reminded of miraculous
predictions assigned to Pherecydcs and Pythagoras (pp. 50 f.); but as a citizen of Miletus, in the earthquake belt, Anaximander would have had
special experience. The modern Thessalians, for example, know that an
earthquake is imminent when the storks become agitated. At all events Anaximander seems to have visited Sparta, otherwise two separate anecdotes about him would hardly be located there.
THE NATURE OF ANAXIMANDER' S ORIGINATIVE SUBSTANCE,
T6 oiraipov (THE INDEFINITE) Part of Theophrastus' account of Anaximander's originative
material is preserved by Simplicius. It is disputed whether Simplicius derived this and similar doxographical extracts direct
from a version of Theophrastus, or by the medium of Alexander's
lost commentary on the Physics', some extracts certainly came
from this source. A more important question is whether Simplicius,
or Alexander, was using the full edition of Theophrastus, or the two-volume summary, or an even shorter compendious account.
The long surviving fragment on sensation, also in Simplicius, is on
a very much larger scale than the extremely cursory extracts on the material principle, which suggests that they were derived from
different versions of Theophrastus; the latter probably do not come from the complete edition. Hippolytus and the author of the
pseudo-Plutarchean Stromateis also have doxographical summaries
of them has explained the matter sensibly: they draw Okeanos running around the earth, which is drawn as though with a compass, and make Asia equal to Europe.

of Anaximander; they follow Theophrastus less closely than does Simplicius, but provide confirmation and expansion at certain
points. They also cover a greater range of subjects, some of which (e.g. zoogony, astronomy) are dealt with at greater length than the question of the ocpX1!- Simplicius' extract is printed in the left-hand
column of 103, with the corresponding parts of the two subsidiary versions alongside. Briefer and less accurate versions of this doxo
graphy appear in 96 and in Aetius (i, 3, 3, DK 12 A 14). It should be remembered that the passages in 103 are versions of Theophrastus* view of Anaximander; it will be seen that, so far as the
material principle was concerned, he differed little from Aristotle,
from whom some of his phraseology is directly derived. He quoted
one original sentence (bold type in 103 A; see pp. i lyf.) ; this need not imply that he had seen the whole of Anaximandcr's book, as is almost invariably assumed. If he did see the whole, either it was very obscure about the originative stuffor he was untypically obtuse.

(What follows is Simpl., not Theophrastus.)
(i) Did Anaximander call the originative substance &pyfy?
Most modern critics think that Theophrastus named Anaximander
as the first to have used &p\T\ (literally 'beginning' or 'source') as a special term for the originative substance. They infer this from
TrpcoTos TOUTO Touvojjioc KojJifaas TTJS ccpxfjs in 103 A, its equivalent
in 103 B, and one further context in Simplicius (Phys. 150, 23) where Anaximander is described as TrpcoTos OCUTOS ocpx^v 6vojJiocaa$ TO CmroKdiJievov. Burnet, however (EGP 54 n. 2), maintained that what Theophrastus said was simply that Anaximander was the
first to call the material principle (&pxr| in its normal Peripatetic
sense) by the name TO cnreipov, without further qualification. This, indeed, is the obvious sense of the extract from Theophrastus,
103 A, while in 1033 TOUTO has presumably dropped out by haplo
graphy before TOUVOHOC. The other passage of Simplicius is more difficult: its most obvious meaning is 'being the first to call the
substratum of the opposites &pyr\\ but Burnet explained it as
meaning '
being the first to name the substratum of the opposites
as the material cause' (that is, because according to Aristotle the
opposites in Anaximander were specifically produced from the

PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
originative stuff). Burnet's interpretation, while admittedly not the most apparent meaning of the clause in isolation, is certainly
more relevant to the trend of Simplicius' argument. Further, Theophrastus had used the word cipx'n in his remarks on Thales
as already reported by Simplicius (Phys. 23, 23, DKiiAi3), with no special note that Thales himself did not actually use this word a note that would perhaps have been natural if Theophrastus had
gone on to assert that Anaximander was its originator. It is
possible, of course, that Simplicius misunderstood Theophrastus' comment about ccpxr| and cbreipov. The whole question is of minor
importance ; it does seem, however, that no technical use of ccpx1! by Anaximander was implied by Theophrastus the use he referred
to was of TO cnreipov.
(ii) What did Anaximander mean by TO caretpov?

First, it is advisable to isolate the Peripatetic, and so also the
doxographical, interpretation of TO arreipov. Aristotle, curiously enough, mentioned Anaximander by name only four times, but made several probable references to his primary substance (e.g.
in fin.). There is little doubt that he took coreipov in Anaxi
mander, and in the monists in general, to mean primarily
'spatially infinite'. This is suggested in no. In 104, part of his discussion of the concept of infinity, Aristotle attributes some specific quality, presumably that of the intermediate in the case of Anaximander (pp. iioff.), to the material principles of all the
9\j(TiKoi who recognize the infinite. Theophrastus seems to have felt that Anaximander had given his primary substance a name
which described its spatial property, but which said nothing
except by implication (that it was not identified with any of the
later 'elements') about its qualitative properties. Thus in 103 A!. 2, and in other such classifications, chreipov means 'infinite'; it is 'neither water nor any other of the so-called elements, but some other infinite nature from which come all the heavens . . .
'
( Anaxi
mander's heavens being infinite in number for Theophrastus). 1
104 All the physicists make the infinite a property of some other nature belonging to the so-called elements, such as water or air or that which is intermediate between these.
1 08



ANAXIMANDER
1 The words h-epocv TIVOC 9uaiv arreipov seem to echo Aristotle's radically
different Prepay TIVOC 9uaiv TCO oareipcp in 104; especially since the wider
contexts of the two phrases have much in common. This superficial
similarity of phraseology suggests that Theophrastus had made himself familiar with his master's discussion of infinity in the Physics before he set about summarizing the theories of Anaximander. It is, however, uncertain that Anaximander himself intended
TO cbreipov to mean precisely 'the spatially infinite'. We may
legitimately doubt whether the concept of infinity was apprehended before questions of continuous extension and continuous divisibility were raised by Mclissus and Zeno. coreipov means
'without boundary, limit, definition'; this indefiniteness is spatial
in early usages, as in the ccmipovcc TTOVTOV of Homer (Anaximander's cnreipov is presumably from coreipos, of which drrreipcov
is a more poetical equivalent), and as in Xenophanes (3), who said that the earth went down e$ cbreipov, indefinitely, i.e. beyond
the imagination or the concern of men. Now Anaximander
certainly assumed the original stuff to have been indefinitely huge in extent; but he perhaps gave formal expression to this idea by saying that this stuff ' surrounded all things' (no), and might not have felt this characteristic (which must have been assumed as a
matter of course by Thales, see n. on p. 93) to be sufficiently remarkable to be applied as sole description, that is as 'the
spatially indefinite'. We might expect any such single description to refer first to the kind of substance, not to its commonly assumed vastness of extent. Thus Cornford (e.g. C.A.H. iv, 542) and others
have argued that TO cnreipov meant 'that which is internally
unbounded, without internal distinctions', i.e. that which is indistinct, indefinite in kind. There is no need to stress internal
divisions, 1 but the general point seems not improbable: for Anaximander the original world-forming stuff was indefinite, it resembled no one kind of matter in the developed world. Yet
no parallel early use of oorEipos in a certainly non-spatial sense can be cited, and this is in favour of retaining the interpretation 'spatially indefinite'. In any case the lack of positive identification
was conspicuously implied. Either TO cnretpov meant ' the spatially indefinite', and was implied to be indefinite in kind because it was
not formally identified as fire, air, water or earth (to use Theophrastus' terms of 103 A); or Anaximander intended it to mean primarily 'that which is indefinite in kind', but naturally assumed it also to be of unlimited extent and duration properties which,
109



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
when expressed, would be expressed in terms of all-inclusiveness
and divine immortality.2
1 Nor is it easy to accept Cornford's suggestion that the coreipov was conceived as circular or spherical, cf. ooreipov d^ipArjorTpov at Aeschylus Ag. 1382, aireipos of a ring in Aristophanes and Aristotle, etc. It is
impossible to prove that any particular application of the word that was feasible in the archaic period was entirely absent from Anaximander's mind ; but the intention seems to have been to deny any fixed determination.
2 Cherniss, Aristotle 9s Criticism ofPresocratic Philosophy 377 f., maintained that Anaximander meant cnretpov {TO irAfjOos), i.e. 'with an indeterminate number of internal divisions'. But in this case direipov would have to be expressly qualified by a word implying number, as in Anaxagoras frr. i

air andfire, simply, together with contrariety; but one of the two opposites is a privation so that it is impossible for the intermediate ever to exist in isolation, as some say the infinite
[apeiron] and the surrounding does.
106 Two types of explanation are given by the physicists. Those who have made the subsisting body one, either one of the three or something else which is thicker than fire and finer than air, generate the rest by condensation and rarefaction, making it into many But the others say that the opposites are separated outfrom the One, being present in it, as Anaximander says and all who say there are one and many, like Empedocles andAnaxagoras; for these, too, separate out the rest from the mixture.
IIO



ANAXIMANDER
Aristotle, when listing various monistic theories of the 9U<jiKo{, on a number of occasions speaks of a substance between the elements normally between fire and air or between air and
water. 1 In three or four of these passages it looks as though
Anaximander is meant as the proponent of an intermediate substance, not because he is directly named but because the substance
is implied to have been called simply TO chreipov. In 105 the
people who said that 'the cnreipov and the surrounding 5 existed on its own, in isolation from the elements, appear from the termino
logy (cf. no) to be Anaximander and followers; see also in, where the intermediate between water and air is said to ' surround
all the heavens, being boundless'. Now Aristotle in 104 declared
that all the 9uaiKoi who envisaged it gave some specific description of the infinite (TO ooreipov) : we may ask what description Anaxi
mander was deemed by Aristotle, when he wrote those words, to have given, if not as an intermediate which is, indeed, actually
mentioned in that passage as a typical description. Were it not for
one passage, namely 106, there would be no difficulty in accepting that Aristotle had Anaximander in mind in most, at any rate, of
his references to an intermediate material principle. One of
Aristotle's most acute ancient commentators, Alexander of Aphro
disias, did in fact accept this; so, usually, did Simplicius. Yet in
106, on the only possible interpretation, Aristotle placed the intermediate substance and Anaximander in opposed groups.2 Various unenlightening guesses have been made about the historical author of the intermediate-substance theory; but a care
ful study of all Aristotle's references indicates that Anaximander
was, after all, in his mind although Anaximander in fact held no such theory. Aristotle evidently felt that Anaximander's (for
Aristotle) 'infinite' ocpXT) must have had some expressible relationship to the so-called elements; and there are some passages (e.g.
107) in which he wrote simply of TO irapd TOC oroixeioc,
' that which
is beside the elements', not identifiable with any one of them, and
not of TO neTOc^v or TO neaov. By this formulation one possibility was that it was intermediate between two elements ; another, that it was a mixture of them all. In 106 Aristotle seems to take the latter view;3 but he elsewhere considered the former possibility, and had arrived at the theoretical hypothesis of an intermediate
(a hypothesis which he himself, of course, regarded as untenable: cf. 105) as a by-product of his reflexions on Anaximander. That he
in



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
had no explicit historical example in mind, however, is shown by his variation of the elements between which the intermediate came.
My suggestion is, then, that Aristotle, puzzled about the nature of
Anaximander's cbreipov, thought that, if not an element, it must be either an intermediate or a mixture. Usually when he mentioned an intermediate in lists of possible primary substances he had Anaximander in mind, though he also tended to add the inter
mediate indiscriminately to any such list for the sake of exhaustivity. It is so added in 106, where, as the result ofa different type ofcritique,
he applies the mixture-interpretation to Anaximander by name.
1 Apart from 104, 105, 106, III, cf. Met. A 7, 988 a 30; 989 a 14;
Phys. A6, iSgbi; Y^ 203318; GCB i, 328035. 2 It might be argued that t6 ev, the One, is common to both groups, therefore that Anaximander might occur in each. But the contrast is really
between those who retain the One as a substratum, and those who (like Anaximander) do not. 3 That Aristotle could regard Anaximander's direipov as a mixture is shown for certain in 122. For a fuller discussion of the whole topic see Kirk, 'Some problems in Anaximander', CQ.N.S. 5 (1955) 24 ff.

107 But yet} nor can the infinite body be one and simple, whether it be, as some say, that which is beside the elements, from which they generate the elements, or whether it be expressed simply. For there are some people who make what is beside the elements the
infinite, and not air or water, so that the rest be not destroyed by their infinite substance; for the elements are opposed to each other (for example, air is cold, water moist, andfire hot), and if one of those were infinite the rest would already have been destroyed. But, as it is,
they say that the infinite is different from these, and that they come into being from it.
108 Belief in infinity would result, for those who consider the matter, for the most part from five factors . . .further, because only so would generation and destruction not fail, if there were an infinite source from which that which is coming-to-be is derived.
112



ANAXIMANDER
These passages present two possible motives for the postulation of the Indefinite as primary substance. The reason in 107 that the
infinite primary substance, if identified with a specific worldconstituent, would swamp the other world-constituents and never
allow them to develop is assigned to those who posited an ooreipov substance 'beside the elements', i.e. not identical with
any of them. When Aristotle used this formulation he usually,
though not necessarily invariably, had Anaximandcr in mind (pp. 1 1 off.), and Simplicius in his comment on the passage (Phys.
479, 33) ascribed this reason to Anaximander. On the other hand the totally different reason suggested in 108 that an infinite source-material ensures that coming-to-be within the world shall not fail for want of material is given as Anaximander's
by Aetius (i, 3, 3, DKi2A4) and by Simplicius in one passage (de caelo 615, 15, DKi2Ai7). Aetius' attribution suggests that
Theophrastus applied the motive of 108 to Anaximander; but
we cannot be sure that he did not apply that of 107 also, and
in either case he was probably working from what Aristotle
had said.
Most modern critics have accepted 108 as giving Anaximander's
true motive, and many have rejected 107 as not (in spite of appearances) applying to Anaximander. Thus Cherniss called the
argument in 107 'the peculiarly Aristotelian argument of the
necessary equilibrium of contrary forces'. It is true that it is expressed, naturally enough, in an Aristotelian form. But Anaxi
mander had postulated a comprehensive balance between opposed substances (see 112 with discussion), and might well have reasoned in some such way as this: 'Thales said that all things originated
from water; but water (which we see in the form of rain, sea and
rivers) is opposed to fire (the sun, the fiery aither, volcanoes etc.),
and these things are mutually destructive. How then can fire have become such a prominent part of our world, if it were from
the beginning constantly opposed by the whole indefinitelyextended mass of its very opposite? How, indeed, can it have appeared at all, for a single moment? The warring constituents of our world, then, must have developed from a substance different from any of them something indefinite or indeterminable.'
(Aristotle's interpretation of ooreipov as 'infinite' does not affect
this issue.) As for 108, Aristotle himself pointed out its fallacy :

But this was precisely Anaximander's view of physical change that there is no wastage: opposed substances make retribution to
each other for their encroachments (pp. n8ff.), and provided the balance is maintained all change in the developed world takes
place between the same original quantity of separate, opposed substances. (It may be noted that 107 gives a reason for postu
lating a qualitatively indefinite primary substance, while 108 gives
one for postulating a spatially indefinite, or infinite, substance;
cf. pp. io8ff.)

ANAXIMANDER
motion certainly, therefore, to the Milesians, Heraclitus, and
Diogenes of Apollonia. 'Steers all' obviously reproduces Presocratic terminology, and the whole phrase
* enfolds all things and
steers all' may form a single rhythmical unit. Anaximander, who is mentioned below in connexion with another phrase describing
the same subject, and who is probably referred to in in in connexion with Treptexeiv, could have been its author. 1
is presumably genuine in Anaximencs fr. 2 (163), even if some of its context is re-worded; Anaxagoras (who is not in question in the
Aristotelian passage) certainly used TO irepixv in fr 2 (515). Kupepvav, of the steering of cosmic constituents or events, occurs in Heraclitus fr. 41
(230), Parmenides fr. 12, 3 (358), Diogenes of Apollonia fr. 5 (606). The two words could, of course, have been combined by Aristotle from different sources.
It is not easy, however, to see what manner of control could be exercised on all things by Anaximander's Indefinite. The Greek
does not necessarily mean that the steering is due to the enfolding both properties independently are natural ones for something conceived as divine but it probably implies it. Again, the metaphor of steering does not necessarily entail a conscious and intelli
gent agent, for the steering of a ship can be regarded as a purely mechanical process, with reference to changes of direction imposed by the steering mechanism and not to the intentions of the navigator. Yet the archaic theomorphic, and thus to some extent
anthropomorphic, conception of the primary stuff favours the assumption of purposeful action. Possible methods of control are
the following: (i) by means of surrounding or enfolding: either
(a) by preventing the further expansion of the differentiated world
('all things'), or (b) by making good the waste involved in change in the world; (2) by being immanent in all things, or some things,
and providing either (a) motive power or life-force, or (b) a principle or rule or law of change; (3) by having initiated the world
in such a way as to provide a continuing rule or law of change.
(i, b) was implied in 108, but it was argued on pp. i I3f. that this is unlikely to be valid for Anaximander; the same argument
applies to (i, a). (2, a) would apply to Thales; (2, ), rather than (3), to Heraclitus (pp. 188, 200). (2), as well as (i), seems unlikely for Anaximander, for the Indefinite clearly cannot have been imagined as immanent in the developed world, even in the way that Thales' world was somehow interpenetrated with a divine
8-2



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
life-substance: the Indefinite was probably so named because it
was not identical with anything in nature. (3), however, could apply to Anaximander: it is feasible that the control exercised on
all things was through the law of retribution between opposites, a
law (or manner of behaviour) which was initiated when the first opposed substances appeared within the Indefinite and which still
governs all change in the world. Nevertheless, it remains true that Aristotle could have had in mind someone other than Anaxi
mander Heraclitus, perhaps, or Diogenes of Apollonia in the
first part of no, and particularly, perhaps, in the phrase 'steers all
things'. The ascription of the idea of TTEpi^XEiv to the monists is repeated
in in; here again the infinite material suggests Anaximander, though it surrounds not 'all things' but 'all the heavens'. This statement seems to have been taken up by Theophrastus (103),
who evidently thought that it implied separate first heavens, each enclosing a separate world: see pp. 121 ff. for the idea of innumer
able worlds. But Aristotle's phrase could be due to his using
oupavoi in a special sense, as the spheres of the sun, moon and stars
(cf. de caelo A 9, 278bg) ; he might naturally apply his own analysis of the cosmos (based on the Eudoxan-Callippean scheme) to Anaximander, with his separate circles for the heavenly bodies (pp. i35ff.), and intend nothing more than one complex world.
In the latter part of no we are told that the enfolding stuff 'is
the divine; for it is immortal and indestructible, as Anaximander
says and most of the physicists'. It is legitimate to suppose that the words 'immortal and indestructible' were intended to belong
to Anaximander himself, though others said something similar.
According to Theophrastus as reported in 1036, however, the phrase was cdSiov xocl dyrjpco, which is a Homeric formula used of
gods or their appurtenances, 'eternal and free from old age' : so at
Od. 5, 218 (to Calypso), f| pv yap (3pOTO$ ten, aO 6* dddvaros Keel dyfjpcos (cf. also //. 2, 447). Short epic formulas often found their way into archaic prose, and it seems likely that this, rather than
the somewhat repetitive equivalent in Aristotle, was the original form.1 At all events Anaximander seems to have applied to the Indefinite the chief attributes of the Homeric gods, immortality and boundless power (connected in his case with boundless
extent) ; it seems not improbable that he actually called it 'divine', and in this he was typical of the Presocratic thinkers in general.

Simplicius is undoubtedly quoting from a version of Thcophrastus' history of earlier philosophy, and from the section on the material

a direct quotation. Thus KCCTOC TTJV TOU xpovou TOC^IV, which many
have held to be a Theophrastcan paraphrase of KCCTOC TO XP^00^

fr. 80, KCCT' epiv KCCI xpecov (for xpecbjjieva), to give a similar phrase

, as he describes it in these
rather poetical terms.
117



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
suggests that these belong to Theophrastus. The sentiment, too, looks Peripatetic: it is a close restatement of one of Aristotle's basic
dogmas about the primary substance of the physical monists, * all things are destroyed into that from which they came-to-be'
(Phys. PS, 204 b 33; cf. also 87 line 3). Theophrastus was given to quoting single words or phrases; thus he could have quoted the concluding phrase of a sentence, the rest of which he had paraphrased, in order to emphasize the connexion with the following sentence which he quotes in full. See further under v.
1 Theophrastus certainly used similar phraseology himself, notably TC$CIV TIV& Kod xpovov cbpiCF|Jivov (of Heraclitus). But this is very different from the bold personification of TTJV TOU xpovov Td^tv.
(ii) The meaning of the main assertion
The context shows that Theophrastus regarded the quotation as appropriate to the view he had just attributed to Anaximander, that 'all the heavens and the worlds in them' came from the
Indefinite. e d>v . . . (the plural is generic) adds that, since they
came from the Indefinite, they will also return to it 'of necessity; for they pay penalty and retribution to each other. . . '. It appears from the version of ps.-Plutarch, 1030, that by 'the heavens and
the worlds in them' Theophrastus was referring to cnreipoi Koaiaoi, innumerable worlds. But there is a very strong objection to understanding the words quoted from Anaximander to refer to
innumerable worlds coming-to-be from, and being destroyed into, the Indefinite. ccAAf)Aoi$ shows that retribution is made mutually between the parties who are the subject of the sentence. Can we really believe that the divine Indefinite commits injustice on its
own products, and has to pay them recompense? This, surely, is intolerable ; but if so, then Theophrastus (who was not infallible in such matters of interpretation, any more than Aristotle) mistook the proper application of Anaximander's dictum. It has long been observed that the things which commit injustice on each other must be equals, different but correlative ; and that these are most
likely to be the opposed substances which make up the differentiated world. 1
1 G. Vlastos, CP 42 (1947) lyif'j following Cherniss, tried to show how the ultimate balance between opposites could be reconciled with the
reabsorption of the world into the Indefinite: when this happens, he said, the opposites finally settle up accounts with each other (not with the
118



ANAXIMANDER
Indefinite). But if the principle of justice applies in the present world, it
is not easy to see how such a drastic change, affecting all its constituents, as the return of the world to the Indefinite could ever come about.
(iii) The opposites
It will be seen later (120, 123) that the production of opposites was an essential stage of cosmogony for Anaximander; it is therefore reasonable to assume that they played an important part in the
developed world. The interplay of opposites is basic in Heraclitus,
who seems to have deliberately corrected Anaximander by his
paradox 'strife injustice* (fr. 80, 214). Anaximander is the first in
whom the concept of opposed natural substances (which recurs in
Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, and in the
Pythagoreans certainly as early as Alcmaeon) clearly appears. Doubtless he was influenced by observation of the main seasonal
changes, in which heat and drought in summer seem to be pitted against cold and rain in winter. The constant interchange between
opposed substances is explained by Anaximander in a legalistic
metaphor derived from human society: the prevalence of one substance at the expense of its contrary is 'injustice', and a reaction takes place through the infliction of punishment by the restoration
of equality of more than equality, since the wrong-doer is deprived of part of his original substance, too. This is given to the victim in addition to what was his own, and in turn leads (it might
be inferred) to xopos, surfeit, on the part of the former victim, who now commits injustice on the former aggressor. Thus both the
continuity and the stability of natural change were motivated, for
Anaximander, by means of this anthropomorphic metaphor. The main opposites in cosmogony were the hot substance and the cold substance flame or fire and mist or air. These, with which are
associated dryness and moisture, are also the main cosmological opposites, most notably involved in the large-scale changes in the natural world. They were probably isolated by Heraclitus (fr. 126) before ever they were elevated to the form of standard irreducible
elements by Empedocles. Caution must be shown, to be sure,
about the opposites in Anaximander: it is possible, for example,
that the Peripatetics substituted their own more abstract formula
tions, the hot and the cold and so on, for much more concrete expressions by Anaximander himself. For him, the world may
have been made up of substances which, while they each possessed
"9



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
individual tendencies contrary to those of some of the others, need
not have been formally described as opposites, that is, for example,
as the hard and the soft; but simply as fire, wind, iron, water, man,
woman and so on.
(iv)
' The assessment of Time*
The concluding phrase of the quotation,
*
according to the assess
ment of Time', elaborates the injustice-metaphor. What kind of assessment does Time make? The word TCCI$ suggests the ordaining of punishment by a judge or, more aptly, the assessment of tribute (as in the Athenian tribute-lists) . In these cases what is ordained
or assessed is the amount of the punishment or payment; this can hardly be the primary purpose of Time's assessment. Time must
presumably control the time-limit for payment; the amount would
be fixed, as total restitution plus a proportionate amende. The idea of a time-limit is appropriate : the injustice of summer has to be
made good within the roughly equal period of winter, that of night
during the period of day, and so on. No uniform period can be meant: Time makes the assessment to meet the particular case. That the additional idea of inevitability is implicit in the remarkable personification of Time here may be indicated by the strikingly
similar 'trial conducted by Time' in Solon, roughly a generation
before Anaximander:
113 Solon fr. 24 Diehl, lines 1-7 ycb 6e TCOV iiv ov/vera uvr|yayov

Here Earth justifies Solon's claim because with the lapse of time she
has become free; that is what Time's trial signifies. No predetermined time-limit is intended here. Elsewhere in Solon, too,
it is the inevitability of retribution that is stressed again and again;
113 Why did I cease before I gained the objects for whose sake I brought together the people? The great mother of the Olympian deities would be my best supporting witnessfor this in the court of Time black Earth, whose boundary-stones9 fixed in many places, I once removed; formerly was she enslaved, now is she free.
1 2O



ANAXIMANDER
so in Anaximander, we may infer, injustice must inevitably be punished, sooner or later in time but here the periods, since they are those of the great seasonal changes, as well as other less
important ones, must be supervised and assessed appropriately to each case.
(v) The original of Theophrastus
9
paraphrase
It has been suggested on pp. 1 1 7 f. that ' from what things coming-tobe is for the things that are, destruction also takes place into these '
may be a paraphrase by Theophrastus of something in Anaximander which Theophrastus thought could be recast into the
common Aristotelian formula. If that statement in Anaximander
immediately preceded his dictum about the retribution of oppo
sites (as the transitional phrase KOCTOC TO xpscov may suggest), then it too was presumably concerned with the behaviour of opposites
in the developed world. One sentiment, I suggest, which Anaximander might have expressed in this context, and which could have deceived Theophrastus in the way indicated, was that
opposite substances pay recompense each to its own opposite and to no other; for example the hot substance to the cold, and not to
the heavy or the hard. This is a necessary hypothesis for Anaximander's theory of cosmic stability, obvious to us but not so obvious
then, since Heraclitus also emphasized it for his own special purposes. The axiom may have been stated in terms so general,
and possibly in a context so isolated, that Theophrastus was able to mistake its proper reference.
INNUMERABLE WORLDS
(i) Successive rather than coexistent
Plural worlds of some kind were attributed to Anaximander by
Theophrastus: '. . .some other substance of infinite spatial extent,
from which come into being all the heavens and the worlds in
them' (103 A). The fragment, about things paying to each other the penalty for injustice, was adduced as somehow relevant to this process; in this Theophrastus seems to have been mistaken
(pp. n8ff.). In the doxographical versions of Theophrastus we learn that these plural worlds were onreipoi, i.e. infinite or innumerable. There has been much controversy as to whether these innumerable worlds were successive in time (so that our world will
eventually pass away, to be succeeded by another, and so on), or
121



PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
coexistent. Zeller supported the former interpretation, Burnet the latter; Cornford demonstrated the fallacy of many of Burnet's
arguments and reinstated the Zellerian interpretation in general
favour (see CQ,28 (1934) iff., and Principium Sapientiae lyyff.). It may be accepted that if Anaximander believed in innumerable
worlds it was in a series of successive single worlds and not in any form of coexistent worlds : as Cornford argued, there is '
nothing in the appearance of nature' to suggest the latter (except the
heavenly bodies, which, however, were described by Anaximander not as worlds but simply as gaps in fire-filled circles of air:
see pp. I35ff.). Nor, it may be added, was there any mythological or other conceivable motive or precedent which might have
persuaded him to elaborate here an anti-empirical theory.
(ii) But are even successive worlds plausible in Anaximander?
I have elsewhere suggested (CQ^N.S. 5 (1955) 28 ff.) that Anaximander may in reality have believed in no type of innumerable
worlds; and this suggestion is further argued here. The reader should be aware that the generally accepted view is that he
believed in a succession of single worlds, each being produced by and destroyed into the Indefinite. This is not unlike what Theo
phrastus believed, and it possesses a prima facie credibility. If it is true, it is still worth emphasizing what a remarkable idea this was.
If coexistent worlds might be suggested to some people (though not, as it happens, to Anaximander) by the heavenly bodies, there is nothing whatever in 'the appearance of nature' to suggest successive
worlds successive separate worlds, that is (for such are clearly
meant by both Theophrastus and his modern followers), as distinct from successive changes in the state of the one continuing
world. These last are envisaged in the mythical catastrophes by fire and flood described in Plato's Timaeus, 22C-E, and were to
some extent suggested by natural phenomena; cf. pp. isgf. We may take it that the Milesians were trying to account for the
world as they experienced it; their explanations were often fanciful and dogmatic, but were none the less attempts to account for
observed phenomena. Now there was no reason whatever to assume that the world was going to be destroyed, or that if destroyed it would be succeeded by another an idea equally
foreign to the naive mythopoeic view (it was not suggested in any Greek mythological source) and to the empirical analytic view.
122



ANAXIMANDER
It is true that the world may at times have been treated as a kind
of living organism but the life was the immortal life of the gods,
who are born, as the world was born, but who live for ever. It
would be entirely contrary to the whole mythical background of
Greek thought, and to the dictates of common sense, to believe in
a cycle of separate worlds; and their appearance in Anaximander is extraordinary. But to anyone already familiar with Empedocles' radical changes of the oxpalpos (pp. 326ff.) and with the
atomist theory of Leucippus and Democritus, of innumerable worlds coming-to-be and passing away throughout infinite space (pp. 409 ff.), and already perhaps prone to misinterpret Heraclitus as having postulated a succession ofworlds (p. 202 n.), the oddity would
not be conspicuous. Given a specific motive Theophrastus might, therefore, have made a false and anachronistic attribution. Such
a motive, it is suggested, was provided by the atomists' arguments for innumerable worlds, as succinctly and infiuentially re-stated by Aristotle.
(iii) Atomist arguments applied by Theophrastus to Anaximander?

This passage gives the fifth and most important motive, according
to Aristotle, for the development of a concept of infinity. The argument that if what is outside the heaven is infinite then body is
infinite, and that if body is infinite then worlds are infinite, is
derived from the atomists, of whom Aristotle was undoubtedly thinking here. But the infinite worlds are necessitated by the
postulate of infinite body, whether or not this is in turn argued (as
by the atomists) from infinite void. On this reasoning Theo
phrastus might have been impelled to assume that the first and
most notable believer in infinite body (as he thought) namely Anaximander also posited infinite worlds. These worlds would

123



PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
behave like the atomists' in that they would be coexistent and also
successive that is, coming-to-be and passing away continually. The assumption that all innumerable worlds are of this kind
appears to be made by Aristotle in the latter part of 118. If we find evidence that Theophrastus treated Anaximander's worlds as both
coexistent and successive, this will suggest strongly that he was applying atomistic reasoning to Anaximander.
(iv) The doxographical evidence may suggest that Theophrastus applied atomist-type worlds to Anaximander
If one turns to the doxographical sources for further elucidation of
Theophrastus' views, the evidence is found to be confused and to some extent corrupt. Thus one of our twin sources for Aetius
(ps.-Plutarch; cf. Aetius n, i, 3, DKiSAiy) assigns innumerable worlds only to the atomists, while the other (Stobaeus) assigns them in addition to Anaximander, Anaximenes, Archelaus, Xenophanes(I), and Diogenes of Apollonia. Neither version can correctly represent Theophrastus: but both could have arisen from a generalization of the atomistic arguments. There was a further
confusion in Aetius (i, 7, 12, DK 12 A 17) between the innumerableworld hypothesis and the common opinion that the stars were gods. These confusions (which are seen also in Cicero) are unlikely to have been caused by a simple statement in Theophrastus that
Anaximander postulated successive worlds. Two important witnesses had quite definite views :

This comment on 114 is probably Simplicius' own, and does not directly reproduce Theophrastus. Simplicius might, however, be expected to be influenced by the Theophrastean interpretation;
though we cannot be sure that he was not misapplying the atomist
arguments, as Cornford thought. Yet the same interpretation
115 For those who supposed the worlds to be infinite in number, like the associates of
Anaximander and Leucippus and Democritus and afterwards those of Epicurus, supposed them to be coming-to-be and passing away for an infinite time, with some of them always coming-to-be and others passing away; and they said that motion was eternal. . ..
124



ANAXIMANDER
appears in a source earlier than Simplicius, and one which is
dependent on the Theophrastean tradition through a different
channel (there is a confusion with Anaxagoras in the first part) :
116 Augustinus C.D. vm, 2 non enim ex una re sicut Thales
ex umore, sed ex suis propriis principiis quasquc res nasci putavit (sc. Anaximander). quae rerum principia singularum esse credidit infinita, et innumerabiles mundos gignere et quaecumque in eis
oriuntur; eosque mundos modo dissolvi modo itcrum gigni
existimavit, quanta quisquc aetate sua manere potuerit.
Worlds coming-to-be and passing away throughout space (or the Indefinite) are surely intended here; 'quanta. . .potuerit' suggests an irregularity which is foreign to the idea of a sequence of single worlds, but which is essential to the atomistic conception.1
1 A passage in Cicero (JV.ZX i, 10, 25, DKiaAiy) which ascribes to
Anaximander worlds rising and setting 'longis intervallis' might point in
the same direction, though certainty is impossible because of the ambiguity of ' intervallis '
(spatial or temporal?).
Thus two sources independent of each other, the one indirectly (here) and the other directly influenced by the tradition from
Theophrastus, assigned atomistic worlds to Anaximander. Further,
such an ascription by Theophrastus himself, of worlds both coexistent and successive, would at least provide a possible motive for the confusion between the two in some parts of the dependent doxographical tradition on Anaximander.
(v) Further considerations against and for the hypothesis
Two difficulties of this interpretation must be mentioned.
(a) It is possible from HI that Aristotle meant to attribute
plural worlds to the monistic physicists in general: the infinite
primary substance, they said, 'surrounds all the heavens (oupcc
vous) '. To meet this, it was proposed on p. 1 16 that Aristotle was
using oupavoi in his special sense of 'celestial spheres' : he meant 'everything enclosed by the first heaven' and (perhaps because of
the analogy of Anaximander's circles) expressed this concept in
language appropriate to his own cosmology. Certainly in no the
Il6 For he [Anaximander} thought that things were born not from one substance, as Thales thought from water, but each from its own particular principles. These principles of individual things he believed to be infinite, and to give birth to innumerable worlds and whatsoever arises in them; and those worlds, he thought, are now dissolved, now born again, according to the age to which each is able to survive.
125



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
infinite primary substance is said to enclose simply 'all things', and there is no suggestion elsewhere in Aristotle of innumerable separate worlds before the atomists.
(b) If Theophrastus thought that anyone who postulated infinite material should also postulate innumerable worlds like the
atomists, why did Simplicius write in 150 (the continuation of 115) that Anaximenes, whose primary substance was described as
infinite by Theophrastus and Simplicius, believed in successive
single worlds? The distinction from Anaximander is puzzling on any interpretation. But Heraclitus and Diogenes are mentioned
as sharing the belief; Simplicius certainly ascribed successive worlds to Heraclitus, and he may have thought that Anaximenes should be classed with him, as a believer in a specific primary substance, rather than with Anaximander and the atomists, whose dpxr| was undifferentiated. There is also a possibility that Anaximenes does not belong here at all: see n. on p. 151. Nevertheless
these two pieces of evidence, puzzling as they are, cannot be
regarded as neutralized. On the other side there were three special
characteristics of Anaximander's cosmology which might well have
encouraged an innumerable-world interpretation: (i) the theory that the earth was surrounded by a number perhaps an indefinite number of rings of the celestial bodies (pp. I35ff.);
(2) the theory that the earth was drying up, which was probably part of a wider theory of cycles of change on the earth's surface
a succession of x6orpoi in the sense of local arrangements (pp. isgf.) ;
(3) the potential ambiguity of the fragment known to Theophrastus. This fragment seems properly to have described the interaction of substances within the world, but Theophrastus misapplied it to interaction between the world and the Indefinite.
Thus (i) might help to suggest coexistent worlds, (2) and (3) successive ones. Theophrastus may have applied atomistic arguments and imposed upon Anaximander worlds that were both.

<f\ del) (Ross) is supported by the comments of both Themistius and
Simplicius. The sense is that those who postulate one eternal world also
postulate eternal motion; those who postulate one non-eternal world do not. Note that successive single worlds (which would require eternal motion) are not included in this analysis.
Theophrastus evidently stated that the Indefinite was characterized by an eternal motion, which was somehow responsible for the
innumerable worlds. He likewise attributed eternal motion to
Anaximenes, presumably because, like Anaximander, Anaximenes did not specify anything that could obviously act as a cause of change. Aristotle frequently rebuked the monists for this very fault; but 118 shows that he could on occasion understand their
ways of thinking better than his pupil Theophrastus. There he considers an ungenerated motion which is 'deathless', which
inheres in things as a kind of life. He was thinking of Thales,
118 Did motion come into being at some time. . .or did it neither come-to-be nor is it destroyed, but did it always exist and will it go on for ever, and is it immortal and un
ceasingfor existing things, being like a kind of life for all natural objects?. . .But all who say that there are infinite worlds, and that some of them are coming-to-be and others passing away, say that motion always exists. . .while all who say that there is one world, whether eternal or not, make an analogous supposition about motion.
119 Tet if indeed there is some kind of natural motion, there would not be enforced
motion only, or enforced rest; so "that if the earth now stays in place by force, it also came together to the centre by being carried there because of the vortex. (For this is the cause that
everyone gives, through what happens in water and in air: for in these the larger and heavier objects are always carried toward the centre of the vortex.) Therefore all who generate the heaven say that the earth came together to the centre.
127



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
perhaps (p. 97); but the phrase 'immortal and unceasing' reminds one of the phraseology which he attributed to Anaxi
mander, among others, in no: he probably realized, then, that for Anaximander change in the cosmos was bound up with the
divinity, the power of life and movement, of the Indefinite. What Theophrastus had in mind as Anaximander's * eternal motion' was probably some more explicit, mechanical kind of motion like
that of the atomists, who are mentioned indirectly in the latter
part of 118; we have seen (pp. i23ff.) that Theophrastus may well have grouped Anaximander with the atomists over the question of innumerable worlds. Some modern scholars (e.g. Burnet) have held that Anaximander postulated a confused agitation like the
winnowing motion in Plato's Timaeus; others (e.g. Tannery) have assigned a circular motion to the Indefinite. Both are equally
unlikely. It is highly improbable that Anaximander himself ever isolated this question of motion; the Indefinite was divine, and naturally possessed the power to move what and where it willed.
To define its properties further would defeat Anaximander's
purpose. One often reads of a vortex or vortices in Anaximander. There
is in fact no evidence for this apart from Aristotle in 119, a highly involved piece of a priori reasoning in which the reference of * therefore' at the beginning of the last sentence is unclear. But in any case Anaximander was certainly not in Aristotle's mind when he wrote this passage; for shortly afterwards (125) Anaximander
is distinguished from the majority of the physicists on the ground that his earth remained at the centre by equilibrium and not by conventional kinds of 'force'. This distinction and the sub
sequent discussion come as an appendix to the discussion of vortex
action, which is no longer under consideration; thus it may be
accepted that Aristotle was talking loosely in saying in 119 that ' all who generate the heaven say that the earth came together to the centre', if this implies more than accretion. Vortices are not associated in our doxographical sources with anyone before Empe
docles, though Aristotle's generalization in 119 would surely have led Theophrastus to mention earlier occurrences, had he been able
to find them. It is, nevertheless, just possible that what was separated off from the Indefinite in the first stage of Anaximander's
cosmogony was a vortex, see p. 132 ; what is quite out of the question is either that the whole Indefinite was in vortex-motion, or
128



ANAXIMANDER
that the diurnal movement of the heavenly bodies is due to this
cause (which would not suit the earth's equilibrium in 125). The tendency of heavy bodies to the centre is assumed in most early
cosmogonies. This may have been due in part, as implied in 119, to the observation of vortex-action in everyday experience; but in
part it simply reflected the obvious arrangement of the components of the visible cosmos.

It is almost certain from the first sentence of 121 that Simplicius
is no longer quoting Theophrastus, but giving his own paraphrase of what he has just quoted. In the second sentence he partly depends on the analysis by Aristotle in 106. There are two notable differences between his comment and the Aristotelian original:
(a) the opposites are separated out (eKKpiveaOoci) in Aristotle,
separated off (diroKpivoiJievcov) in Simplicius; (b) Simplicius, but not Aristotle, said that the separation was due to the eternal motion.
Now it has been argued by U. Holscher (Hermes 81 (1953) 258 ff.) that Simplicius in the second sentence of 121 (as at Phys. 150, 22)
is simply and solely enlarging on Aristotle, and reproduces no
Theophrastean interpretation whatever; this passage, therefore, is not good evidence for Anaximander unless Aristotle is reliable in
120. But, the argument continues, Aristotle was prone to read his
120 But the others say that the opposites are separated outfrom the One, being present in it, as Anaximander says and all who say there are one and many, like Empedocles and
Anaxagoras; for these, too, separate out the rest from the mixture.
121 It is clear that he [Anaximander], seeing the changing of thefour elements into each
other, thought it right to make none of these the substratum, but something else beside these; and he produces coming-to-be not through the alteration of the element, but by the separation off of the opposites through the eternal motion.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
own simple bodies, and two pairs of basic opposites, into every
thing, and he perverted Anaximander by substituting separating out for separating off from the Indefinite, thus making this into a
mixture of opposites. Theophrastus attributed separating off to Anaximander, but of the innumerable worlds and not of opposites
(dTTOK6Kp(aOai in 103 c) ; and this, according to Holscher, was the
proper application of the word. Against this ingenious theory the following points may be made. The mention of the eternal motion
by Simplicius is Theophrastean and not Aristotelian in source
(see 117); so, apparently, is his use of the verb for separating off. Therefore, while it is agreed that he was not here quoting Theo
phrastus, he probably did have Theophrastus' assessment of Anaximander in mind. Further, Holscher has not succeeded in
convincingly destroying a most damaging piece of evidence, passage 123. This continuation of Ps.-Plutarch's doxography in 103 c states that ' the productive from the eternal of hot and cold
was separated off at the beginning of this world', and continues
with details of the cosmogony. This, though garbled, represents
Theophrastus, and shows that Theophrastus accepted separation off from the Indefinite, and opposites, as involved in Anaximander's
cosmogony. Since the extant fragment (112) suggests that the world is still composed of opposites, it seems legitimate to accept from both Theophrastus and Aristotle that opposites were involved
in cosmogony.
Nevertheless, we may accept the warning about 6<Kpivea0cci in Aristotle: it seems quite likely that this is a distortion of coro
Kptveadoci. And according to 123 what was separated off was not
opposite substances (flame and mist) but something that produced them. This might have been a kind of seed, it might have been a vortex; there was perhaps a confusion in the tradition (see p. 133). At all events we have no right to assume with Aristotle that the
opposites were in (evoucrccs) the Indefinite, and were separated out of it ; still less may we define the Indefinite as a mixture, as Aristotle
undoubtedly did. 1 The Indefinite was not clearly defined and
analysed by Anaximander; but this does not mean, of course, that he might not have been making it behave, in respect of its products, in some way like a compound either a mechanical
mixture or a fusion.2 If the opposites arose directly from the
Indefinite by being separated off, as Simplicius states in 121, then the Indefinite was being unconsciously treated as unhomogeneous;
130



ANAXIMANDER
for separation off cannot simply imply the isolation of one part of
the Indefinite, that part which becomes the world : it implies this and some change in the isolated part. If this change was not the
appearance of opposites, but of something productive of them, then one might infer that the Indefinite was the kind of thing that
contained, for example, sperms or embryos : but that still does not
mean that Anaximander thought of it as being of a specific character.

2 As suggested by Cornford and by Vlastos (CP 42 (1947) 170-2). Theophrastus is quoted by Simplicius (507) as saying that the mixture of all things in Anaxagoras could be regarded as 'one substance indefinite both in kind and in size', and that he would resemble Anaximander but whether in the idea of mixture is not clear.

This passage (supplemented, for the heavenly bodies, by Hippolytus in 127) is virtually our only authority for Theophrastus' report of the details of the cosmogonical process in Anaximander.
The Stromateis are usually less accurate than either Simplicius or
Hippolytus in reproducing Theophrastus (cf. 103) ; but it cannot be doubted that the present passage is based on him, and the citation of the bark-simile, which looks as though it is derived
122 . . . and this is the One of Anaxagoras (for this is a better description than * all things together') and the mixture ofEmpedodes and ofAnaximander, and what Democritus describes.
123 He says that that which isproductivefrom the eternal ofhot and cold was separated off at the coming-to-be of this world, and that a kind of sphere offlamefrom this wasformed round the air surrounding the earth, like bark round a tree. When this way broken off and shut off in certain circles, the sun and the moon and the stars were formed.

PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
from Anaximander himself, suggests that in places, at least, the
passage follows Theophrastus fairly closely. Theophrastus had previously stated (103 A, B, c) that innumerable worlds came out of the Indefinite; the present passage describes the emergence of our world, and is unaffected by whether or not Anaximander accepted successive worlds. The
phrase EK TOU dci6(ou, 'from the eternal', perhaps means 'from the Indefinite', which was described as immortal. 1 'The productive from the eternal of hot and cold. . .was separated off' is still
difficult, yovijaos (productive) was a favourite Peripatetic word, which usually retained some flavour, if only a slight one, of
biological generation. In the fifth century, on the other hand, yovi[Jio$ only occurs twice, in Euripides and Aristophanes the latter use being a weakened metaphor except for a special medical-technical use (of critical periods in disease ; the biological
meaning is almost suppressed) in the Hippocratic Visits. It seems unlikely, therefore, that it is an Anaximandrean word ; and in view of occurrences of the word, especially in Plutarch, as a dead
metaphor with no biological implications we cannot be sure that
it was here intended to represent generation of a biological kind, however remotely. This must be emphasized because of the popularity of Cornford's suggestion that this stage in Anaximander
corresponds with the production of a cosmogonical egg in e Orphic' accounts (on which see pp. 41-8). It would not be surprising to find that Anaximander resorted to the old mythological medium of sexual generation to account for the most difficult stage in
world-formation the production of heterogeneous plurality out
of a single source, and that, here, an Indefinite one. One would
not, however, expect a crude and explicit device like the egg; and the evidence is not certainly in favour of any such sexual device,
however metaphorical. A completely different suggestion was made by Vlastos (CP 42 (1947) 171 n. 140), that TO yovijjiov was
not a thing so much as a process. A vortex, for instance, might
well account for the appearance of opposites; for the phraseology
we may compare Democritus fr. 167, 8Tvov diro TOU iravT6s
diroKpiOfivai (
e a vortex was separated off from the whole').2 Yet
why did Theophrastus not simply use the word SIvos or 8fvr| to describe a process completely familiar to him, and one which would further have emphasized the resemblance of Anaximander
and Anaxagoras (n. 2 on p. 131)? If he had used the word, we
132



ANAXIMANDER
should not have this vague circumlocution in ps.-Plutarch. It is
at least a possibility that Theophrastus himself was in doubt about
this first stage, perhaps through lack of full information, and used a vague expression to cover himself; but he would not have
invented an intermediary between the Indefinite and the oppositcs
(which could have been more easily produced, as in 120, directly), and judgement must be reserved on its character.
1 Another possibility is that the whole phrase means 'that which was
capable from all time of producing . . . '. In this case we should expect e di6{ou, without the article. But the insertion of ex TOU <5ci5{ou between
T6 and y6vi|aov5 on the other interpretation, is almost as strange. In any case, the tortuosity of expression is not immediately due to Anaximander, and the obscure meaning is not greatly affected either way.
2 That ' separating off' can be applied to the products of a vortex, as well as to the vortex itself, is demonstrated by Anaxagoras fr. 9 init., OUTGO

The nature of the hot (substance) and cold (substance) thus
cryptically produced appears from what follows : they are flame and air-mist (the inner part of which is assumed to have condensed
into earth). The ball of flame fits closely round the air, as closely as bark grows round a tree ; this can be the point of the simile, which does not necessarily suggest that the flame is annular (though
the eventual shape of the earth is cylindrical, see 124). So far, then, something has been isolated in the Indefinite which produces flame and air-mist; earth condenses at the core, flame fits closely
round the air. Now the ball of flame bursts, breaks up into circles which are enclosed by mist which has also expanded (cf. 127), and
forms the heavenly bodies. From 134 and 135 we learn that the moist earth is dried by the sun, the remnants of the moisture being
sea. 1
1 It is possible that 123 contains other signs of biological-embryological language, apart from the dubious yovtpov. H. G. Baldry (CQ,26 (1932) 27 ff.) pointed out that dnroKpicns was used in embryological treatises to describe the separation of the seed from the parent; 9X0165 could be used of a caul, and was perhaps used in a similar sense by Anaximander see 136;
dTroppTiyvuaOat is sometimes used of a new growth detaching itself from
the parent body (which it can hardly mean here, contra Heidel and Baldry). But none of these words has an exclusively embryological sense; they are
common terms (except 9X0165, which most frequently means 'bark') which would naturally be applied to both embryology and cosmogony.

The earth is shaped like a column-drum; men live on its upper surface. It is three times as wide as it is deep a ratio which is
analogous to the distances of the heavenly bodies (pp. i36f.). Its
evident stability is explained in a new way which represents a radical advance on Thales5 idea that it floated on water (an idea revived and modified by Anaximenes, p. 153). What the earth is
at the centre of, presumably, is the rings of the heavenly bodies, of

125 There are some who say, like Anaximander among the ancients, that it [the earth] stays still because of its equilibrium. For it behoves that which is established at the centre, and is equally related to the extremes, not to be borne one whit more either up or down or to
the sides; and it is impossiblefor it to move simultaneously in opposite directions, so that it
stays fixed by necessity. 126 The earth is on high, held up by nothing, but remaining on account of its similar distance from all things.

which the sun's is the largest (127). Anaximander was not talking of the world as a whole, or saying that it was at the centre of the
Indefinite, though he would doubtless have accepted this if the
idea were put to him. At all events he completely broke away
from the popular idea that the earth must be supported by some
thing concrete, that it must have 'roots' ; his theory of equilibrium was a brilliant leap into the realms of the a priori one which he
would not have been tempted to take, it might be suggested, if vortex-action had been applied in his cosmogony and was at hand,
as it were, to explain the stability of the earth.

127 The heavenly bodies come into being as a circle offire separated offfrom the fire in the world, and enclosed by air. There are breathing-holes, certain pipe-like passages, at which the heavenly bodies show themselves; accordingly eclipses occur when the breathingholes are blocked up. The moon is seen now waxing, now waning according to the blocking or opening of the channels. The circle of the sun is 27 times the size of {the earth, that of) the moon {18 times); the sun is highest, and the circles of the fixed stars are lowest.
128 Anaximander says the sun is a circle 28 times the size of the earth, like a chariot
wheel, with itsfelloe hollow andfull offire, and showing the fire at a certain point through an aperture as though through the nozzle of a bellows. 129 Anaximander says that the sun is equal to the earth, but that the circlefrom which it has its breathing-hole and by which it is carried round is 27 times the size of the earth.

The sun and moon arc each an aperture in separate solid rings like the felloes of cartwheels. These rings consist of fire surrounded
by air (regarded as concealing mist), and out of the single aperture in each of them fire emerges like air from the nozzle of a bellows; the similes of the cartwheels and the bellows perhaps derive from Anaximandcr himself. Eclipses, and phases of the
moon, are due to a total or partial blocking of the aperture;
typically, no motive is given for this blockage. The aperture of the sun is the same size as the surface (presumably) of the earth (129) a reasonable view contradicted by Heraclitus in fr. 3 ; the diameter
of its wheel is twenty-seven times as great as this (twenty-eight times in 128) .* The moon-wheel is nineteen earth-diameters (or
eighteen, presumably) across; the obvious lacuna in 127 has been filled after Aetius n, 25, i, which gives the corresponding information to 128 for the moon, only adding that the circles of sun and
moon lie obliquely. The star-wheels (on which see below),
although we are not told so, were presumably of nine (or ten)
earth-diameters, being nearest to the earth (127 fin.). Thus Anaximandcr gave the structure of the world a mathematical
basis, developing the assumption (seen already in Homer and Hesiod, cf. I with comment) that it is orderly and determinable.
His proportionate distances may have influenced Pythagoras.
1 This larger figure (28*) cannot represent the distance from the outer, as opposed to the inner, edges of the celestial circle if diameters are meant ; for 2, not i, should then be added to the multiple, to give 29*. If the radius and not the diameter were intended the figures given would hold : but 'the circle of the sun is twenty-seven times that of the earth* (127,
128) the earth whose 'breadth* is specified in 124 implies clearly enough that the diameter is really meant. In that case the larger figure might represent the diameter from outer edge to outer edge, the smaller one that from points half-way between the outer and inner edges of the actual felloe of air assuming, what seems reasonable, that the felloe is one earth-diameter thick.
The stars present certain difficulties, (a) 127 fin. mentions the
fixed stars as closest to the earth. Possibly, as Diels thought, there is another lacuna here and the planets were mentioned too. That
130 Anaximander says that the heavenly bodies are carried by the circles and spheres on which each one goes.
136



ANAXIMANDER
the fixed stars and the planets were at the same distance from the
earth is perhaps implied by Aetius n, 15, 6 (DKi2Ai8), and is suggested by the series of proportionate distances : i (diameter of earth) x 18 (moon-ring) 27 (sun-ring). Here x9 the missing distance, must be that of the stars and planets : it must be 9, to fit into the series, and there is no vacant number to allow a different distance for stars and planets, (b) 130 mentions both circles and
spheres of the stars (while 127 has a circle of stars at the beginning,
circles at the end). The two are incompatible; possibly a sphere for the fixed stars, rings for the planets were meant. But this is inconsistent with the argument that fixed stars and planets must be at the same distance from the earth ; there would not be room
for both a sphere and rings. Indeed a sphere, although the
simplest explanation of the fixed stars, is impossible : the cosmogonical account (123) showed that a ball of flame broke up, or broke away from the mist round the earth, and was then shut into
circles (obviously of air-mist) which composed sun, moon and stars. There is no possibility, let alone any mention, of part of the
sphere of flame remaining as a sphere after it had broken away. Thus it must be assumed that each star, including the planets, has its own wheel ; these wheels are equal in diameter and are inclined
on countless different planes. They do not obscure the sun and
moon (cf. e.g. Homer //. 20, 444 ff. ; 21, 549). If their centre is the same as the centre of the earth, the circum-polar stars (which do
not set) arc unexplained as they would be even by a sphere; and
yet if their centres were at different distances up and down the earth's axis, which could account for some stars not setting, their distance from the earth would not be, as we are told it is, the same. Perhaps Anaximander did not think of this difficulty. The movement of the sun on the ecliptic, the declination of the moon, and
the wanderings of the planets were probably explained as due to wind (see 134 and 135) ; the east-to-west movements were due to
rotation of the wheels (cf. 9spa0cci in 130) in the planes of their circumferences.

1 K Tfjs drnf5os dva8i6o^vr|s Gedrenus; the mss. give an obviously corrupt reading (DK i p. 84 n.) which implies ifanything that the exhalation
is from the earth. A dual exhalation was imposed also on Heraclitus (p. 204 n. i) ; it was probably a refinement by Aristotle. Cedrenus (nth cent. A.D.) is sometimes correct: e.g. his ^KTT{TTTCOV in 131 is shown by 132
to be correct against mss. EUTTITITCOV.
These passages suggest that Anaximander shared in, and perhaps to a large degree originated, a more or less standard Ionian way of
accounting for meteorological (in our sense) events. The chief elements of this scheme are wind, the evaporation from the sea, and the condensed masses of vapour which form the clouds. All
testimonies on the subject are, of course, based on Theophrastus,
whom we may suspect of not always resisting the temptation to supply 'appropriate' explanations, where none existed, of certain natural phenomena which he thought interested all Presocratics.
The explanation of wind in 131 (cf. also Aetius m, 7, i, DK 12 A 24) is very involved ; note that it is somehow due to '
separation off' of the finest part of air. Rain is caused by the condensation (presumably) of moist vapours evaporated by the sun ; wind causes most
other phenomena (132, 133), including, probably, the movements
north and south of sun and moon (see 134, 135). The emphasis on
wind, a product of air, might suggest partial conflation with Anaximenes; he gave the same explanation of lightning as
set in motion by congregation; rain occurs from the exhalation that issues upwardsfrom the things beneath the sun, and lightning whenever wind breaks out and cleaves the clouds.
132 (On thunder, lightning, thunderbolts, whirlwinds and typhoons.) Anaximander says that all these things occur as a result of wind: for whenever it is shut up in a thick cloud
and then bursts out forcibly, through its fineness and lightness, then the bursting makes the noise, while the rift against the blackness of the cloud makes the flash.
133 Anaximander referred everything to wind: thunder, he said, is the noise of smitten cloud. . ..

Alexander in 135 must mean the attribution by Theophrastus to
apply to the whole of 134, not merely to the last sentence, since a little later (commenting on Meteor. 355 a 22) he associates Anaximander and Diogenes again with the idea that winds cause the turnings of the sun. (In paraphrasing 134 he had become confused
and described another theory.) It is helpful to have Theophrastus'
attribution, although it must be noted that the only name mentioned by Aristotle in connexion with the drying up of the sea is that
of Democritus (Meteor. 63, 356 bio, DK68Aioo). Aristotle had
previously mentioned (Meteor. A 14, 352 a 17) that those who believed the sea to be drying up were influenced by local examples
of this process (which, we may note, was conspicuous around sixth
century Miletus) ; he himself rebuked them for their false inference,
and pointed out that in other places the sea was gaining; also,
there were long-term periods of comparative drought and flood which Aristotle called the c
great summer' and 'great winter' in a
'great year'. 1
1 Here Aristotle may be aiming particularly at Democritus, who thought that the sea was drying up and that the world would come to an end. Anaxi
mander need not have thought this any more than Xenophanes did; in fact Aristotle might have been rebuking Democritus in terms of the earlier cyclical theory. There may well be a special reference to Anaxi
134 For fast of all the whole area round the earth is moist, but being dried by the sun the part that is exhaled makes winds and turnings of the sun and moon, they say, while that
which is left is sea; therefore they think that the sea is actually becoming less through being dried up, and that some time it will end up by all being dry.
135 of this opinion, as Theophrastus relates, were Anaximander and Diogenes.
139



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
mander in Aristotle's words (Meteor. 62, 355 a 22) 'those who say. . .that when the world around the earth was heated by the sun, air came into being and the whole heaven expanded. . .' (cf. 123).
It is clear that if Anaximander thought that the sea would dry
up once and for all this would be a serious betrayal of the principle
enunciated in the extant fragment (112), that things are punished for their injustice : for land would have encroached on sea without
suffering retribution. Further, although only the sea is mentioned, it is reasonable to conclude that, since rain was explained as due to the condensation of evaporation (131), the drying up of the sea would lead to the drying up of the whole earth. But could our whole interpretation of the fragment as an assertion of cosmic
stability be wrong; could the drying up of the earth be the prelude to re-absorption into the Indefinite? This it could not be, since if
the earth were destroyed by drought that would implicitly qualify the Indefinite itself as dry and fiery, thus contradicting its very
nature; and, in addition, the arguments from the form of the
fragment still stand. The principle of the fragment could, however, be preserved if the diminution of the sea were only one part of a
cyclical process: when the sea is dry a 'great winter' (to use Aristotle's term, which may well be derived from earlier theories)
begins, and eventually the other extreme is reached when all the
earth is overrun by sea and turns, perhaps, into slime. That this
is what Anaximander thought is made more probable by the fact that Xenophanes, another Ionian of a generation just after Anaxi
mander's, postulated cycles of the earth drying out and turning into slime: see pp. i7yff. Xenophanes was impressed by fossils of plant and animal life embedded in rocks far from the present sea, and deduced that the earth was once mud. But he argued, not that
the sea will dry up even more, but that everything will turn back
into mud; men will be destroyed, but then the cycle will continue, the land will dry out, and men will be produced anew. For
Anaximander, too, men were born ultimately from mud (136, 138) . The parallelism is not complete, but it is extremely close : Xenophanes may have been correcting or modifying Anaximander. Anaximander, too, was familiar with the great legendary periods of fire and flood, in the ages of Phacthon and Deucalion; impressed by the recession of the sea from the Ionian coast-line he might well
have applied such periods to the whole history of the earth.

136 Anaximander said that the first living creatures were born in moisture, enclosed in thorny barks; and that as their age increased they came forth on to the drier part and, when the bark had broken off, they lived a different kind of life for a short time.
137 Further he says that in the beginning man was born from creatures of a different
kind; because other creatures are soon self-supporting, but man alone needs prolonged nursing. For this reason he would not have survived if this had been his original form.
138 Anaximander of Miletus conceived that there arose from heated water and earth
either fish or creatures very like fish; in these man grew, in the form of embryos retained within until puberty; then at last thefish-like creatures burst and men and women who were
already able to nourish themselves stepped forth.
139 Living creatures came into being from moisture evaporated by the sun. Man was originally similar to another creature that is, to a fish.
140 Therefore they [the Syrians'] actually revere the fish as being of similar race and nurturing. In this they philosophize more suitably than Anaximander; for he declares, not that fishes and men came into being in the same parents, but that originally men came into being inside fishes, and that having been nurtured there like sharks and having become adequate to look after themselves, they then came forth and took to the land.

yocAeof for the impossible mss. TrocAocioi is a brilliant emendation based on another passage in Plutarch, de soil. an. 33, 982 A, where the shark is said to produce an egg, then to nurture the young inside itself until it is bigger; Aristotle had noted this at H.A. Zio, 565^. But 'like sharks' may well be a parenthetical remark by Plutarch (note the case:
nominative not accusative), who knew about them indirectly from Aristotle; he would naturally quote them as an illustration of Anaximander's idea. Nearly all scholars, however, have chosen to think that Anaximander knew about the embryology of sharks: so e.g. Burnet, Mondolfo, Rudberg. This seems unlikely.
The first living creatures are generated from slime (elsewhere called lAOs) by the heat of the sun: this became a standard account,
and even Aristotle accepted spontaneous generation in such cases. The observation behind the theory was perhaps that of mud-flies and sand-worms which abound in the hot sand at the edge of the sea. Yet the first creatures were not of that kind, but were surrounded by
prickly barks like sea-urchins, Gornford suggested. Aetius (136) seems to preserve special information about these first creatures, which presumably were prior to the fish-like creatures in which men were reared. The use of 9X0165 here reminds one of the bark-simile
in the cosmogonical account (123) ; both ball of flame and prickly
shell broke away from round the core (here irepi- not ocTroppriyvua0ai). The meaning ofthe concluding words of 136 is disputed ; but (JieToc
in new late-Greek compounds usually implies change rather than succession, and the sense is probably that the creatures, emerged from their husks, lived a different life (i.e. on land) for a short time longer.
Possibly Anaximander had some conception ofthe difficulties ofadaptation to environment. This would be no more startling than his intelli
gent observation that man (with nine months' gestation and many years' helplessness) could not have survived in primitive conditions without protection of some kind. This consideration led to the con
jecture that man was reared in a kind offish presumably because the earth was originally moist, and the first creatures were of the sea. Anaximander's is the first attempt of which we know to explain
the origin of man, as well as of the world, rationally. Not all his successors concerned themselves with man's history (they were
more interested in his present condition), and none surpassed him
in the thoughtful ingenuity of his theories. Incomplete and sometimes inconsistent as our sources are, they show that Anaximander's
account of Nature, though among the earliest, was one of the
broadest in scope and most imaginative of all.

more about Anaximenes' date than the statement of Theophrastus
(143) that he was an associate of Anaximander. The Succession
writers would establish him in the next philosophical generation
to Anaximander, and Eratosthenes, followed by Apollodorus, would choose a suitable epoch-year for his acme., i.e. the age of forty. The obvious epoch-year was that of the capture of Sardis by
Cyrus, 546/5 B.C. ( = O1. 58, 3; Hippolytus Ref. i, 7, 9, DKi3A7, gave Ol. 58, i, perhaps by a textual error). This puts his birth around the acme of Thales, his death around the commonly-chosen
age of sixty, and makes him twenty-four years younger than
Anaximander. This is all quite hypothetical; but we may accept what seems likely from his thought, that he was younger than Anaximander; while his active life can scarcely have continued
far into the fifth century (Miletus was destroyed in 494 B.C.). 1

141 Anaximenes son of Eurystratus, of Miletus, was a pupil of Anaximander; some say
he was also a pupil of Parmenides. He said that the material principle was air and the
infinite; and that the stars move, not under the earth, but round it. He used simple and
unsuperjluous Ionic speech. He was active, according to what Apollodorus says, around the time of the capture of Sardis, and died in the 6yd Olympiad.

less. This seems unlikely in itself and, if true, would probably have earned
comment in our sources. Further, it is unlikely that Apollodorus would have ignored Theophrastus' connexion of Anaximenes with Anaximander (who according to Apollodorus was dead by 528) ; or that he would have used two separate captures of Sardis as epochs (he certainly uses that of 546/5) . Further, Hippolytus (DK 1 3 A 7) supports a.floruit at or near 546/5.
About Anaximenes' life, and his practical activities, we know
nothing (cf. n. on p. 103). From the stylistic judgement in 141, however, it is known that he wrote a book, a part of which at least
must have been known to Theophrastus, from whom the criticism
presumably emanates. The 'simple and unsuperfluous
' Ionic may be contrasted with the ' rather poetical terminology' of Anaxi
mander (112).

142 Anaximenes and Diogenes make air, rather than water, the material principle above the other simple bodies.
143 Anaximenes son of Eurystratus, of Miletus, a companion of Anaximander, also says that the underlying nature is one and infinite like him, but not undefined as Anaximander said but definite, for he identifies it as air; and it differs in its substantial nature by
rarity and density. Being made finer it becomes fire, being made thicker it becomes wind, then cloud, then (when thickened still more) water, then earth, then stones; and the rest come into being from these. He, too, makes motion eternal, and says that change, also, comes about through it.

142, together with 153 and 162, is all that Aristotle had to say about Anaximencs by name, and our tradition depends on Theo
phrastus, who according to Diogenes Laertius v, 42 wrote a special
monograph on him (see p. 4). A short version of Theophrastus' account of the material principle is preserved by Simplicius in 143. In the present case Hippolytus' version is longer than Simplicius' ; but an inspection of 144 shows that this is mainly due to wordy
expansion and additional (sometimes non-Theophrastean) inter
pretation. However, the expression TriArjais (inAeTaQat), 'felting', for the condensation of air, is found also in Ps.-Plutarch's sum
mary (151) and was probably used by Theophrastus; it was a
common fourth-century term and need not have been used in this form by Anaximenes himself, contrary to what Diels and others
say. For Anaximenes the originative stuff was explicitly the basic form of material in the differentiated world, since he had thought of a way in which it could become other components of the world,
like sea or earth, without losing its own nature. It was simply condensed or rarefied that is, it altered its appearance according to how much there was of it in a particular place. This met the objection which Anaximander seems to have felt against Thales'
water (pp. iisff.), and which encouraged him to postulate an
being, and the rest from its products. The form of air is of this kind: whenever it is most equable it is invisible to sight, but is revealed by the cold and the hot and the damp and by movement. It is always in motion: for things that change do not change unless there be movement. Through becoming denser or finer it has different appearances; for when it is dissolved into what is finer it becomes fire, while winds, again, are air that is becoming condensed, and cloud is producedfrom air byfelting. When it is condensed still more, water is produced; with afurther degree of condensation earth is produced, and when condensed as
far as possible, stones. The result is that the most influential components of generation are opposites, hot and cold.

indefinite originative material. Anaximenes' air, too, was indefinitely vast in extent it surrounded all things (no and 163),
and was thus described as omreipov, infinite, by Theophrastus. It is
questionable exactly what he meant by air. dcfjp in Homer and sometimes in later Ionic prose meant 'mist', something visible and obscuring; if Anaximander really talked of 'the cold' in cosmo
gony he probably meant a damp mist, part of which congealed to form a slimy kind of earth. Anaximenes probably said (163) that
all things were surrounded by irveO|jia Kcd drip, 'wind (or breath) and air', and that the soul is related to this air; which suggests that
for him <4f|p was not mist but, as Hippolytus in 144 assumed, the invisible atmospheric air. This is confirmed by the fact that he evidently described winds as a slightly condensed form of air (143,
144). Now atmospheric air was certainly not included as a world-component by Heraclitus (e.g. 221), and its substantiality that is, corporeality needed to be emphasized by Empedocles (453). It looks, then, as though Anaximenes simply assumed that some part, at least, of the atmospheric air was substantial, and indeed the basic form of substance; although he did not offer any notable demonstration of its substantiality and so convince his immediate successors. This assumption would be a very remarkable one ; though it must be remembered that irveOua in the sense
of breath was certainly regarded as existing, and yet it was invisible. It was not, however, totally insensible; its presence was
revealed by tangible properties in Hippolytus' terms by ' the cold and the hot and the moist and the moving'. Atmospheric air, on
occasions, makes itself known by none of these things ; probably in that state Anaximenes would not recognize it as air, or as
existing at all. The main forms assumed by air as a result of condensation and
rarefaction were outlined by Theophrastus. They are obvious enough, and were clearly based on observation of natural pro
cesses rain coming from clouds, water apparently condensing into earth, evaporation, and so on. Such changes were accepted
by all the Presocratics ; it was only Anaximenes who explained them solely in terms of the density of a single material. 1 It may be asked why air was specified as the normal or basic form of matter; from the point of view of natural change within the world, water, equally, might be basic, with air as a rarefied variant. In view of
163 (pp. i58ff.), where cosmic air is compared with the irveOucc or
146



ANAXIMENES
breath which is traditionally conceived as the breath-soul or lifegiving yvxri, ft seems that Anaximenes regarded air as the breath
of the world, and so as its ever-living, and therefore divine, source; see also p. 161. Further, air might have seemed to possess some of
the indefinite qualities of Anaximander's originative stuff (not being naturally characterized by any particular opposite) ; in addition it
had the advantage of occupying a large region of the developed world. Anaximenes seems at first sight to have abandoned the
principle of general opposition in the world (it was shortly to be revived in a more Anaximandrean form, though with some modi
fication, by Heraclitus), and so to have lost even the metaphorical motives of injustice and retribution, for natural change. Yet one pair of opposites, the rare and the dense, took on a new and special
significance, and it could legitimately be argued that all changes are due to the reaction of these two: see further p. 149. In addition, no doubt, Anaximenes shared Thales' assumption that matter was somehow alive, which would be confirmed by the
constant mobility of air especially if this was only accepted as
being air when it was perceptible. Theophrastus, as usual, reduced these assumptions to the formula of 'eternal motion', adding that
all change would depend on this motion.

It appears that according to Theophrastus ('the other things, from these' in 143^., also in a vague and inaccurate paraphrase
in 144 init. ; cf. Cicero Acad. n, 37, 1 18, DK 13 A 9) Anaximenes did not think that every kind of natural substance could be explained as a direct form of air, but that there were certain basic forms (fire,
air, wind, cloud, water, earth, stone) of which other kinds were compounds. If true, this is important, since it makes Anaximenes the pioneer of the idea that there are elements from which other

objects are compounded an idea first formally worked out by
Empedocles. Yet it seems questionable whether this interpretation is justified. There is no other evidence that anyone before Empedocles tried to give a detailed account of any but the main cosmic substances ; having invented a device to explain diversity, it would be more in the Milesian character for Anaximenes to have
adhered to it; and Theophrastus was prone to add just such
generalizing summaries, often slightly misleading, to a specific list. 1
1 Another probably false interpretation is that which makes Anaximenes
the forerunner of atomism. He cannot have conceived of matter as continuous, it is argued; therefore, since there can be more or less of it in the same space, it must have been composed of particles which can be more or less heavily concentrated. But it seems unlikely that anyone before Pythagoras or Heraclitus bothered about the formal constitution of matter, or about precisely what was involved in condensation, which could be simply an objective description of certain observed processes.

Plutarch seems to have had access to a genuine citation from
Anaximenes: the word x<^apo$> 'slack', if no more, is definitely said to be his, and there is no reason to doubt it. Conceivably
Plutarch depends on a lost passage of Aristotle; the passage from
146 . . . or as Anaximenes thought ofold, let us leave neither the cold nor the hot as belong
ing to substance, but as common dispositions ofmatter that supervene on changes; for he says that matter which is compressed and condensed is cold, while that which is fine and 'relaxed* (using this very word) is hot. Therefore, he said, the dictum is not an unreasonable one, that man releases both warmth and coldfrom his mouth: for the breath is chilled by being compressed and condensed with the lips, but when the mouth is loosened the breath escapes and becomes warm through its rarity. This theory Aristotle claims to be due to the
man's [sc. Anaximenes'] ignorance. . ..
148



ANAXIMENES
the Aristotelian Problems discusses the phenomenon in the manner suggested in the continuation of 146, but without naming Anaxi
menes. The example of breath was evidently cited by Anaximenes as showing that rarefaction and condensation of air can produce, not merely obvious variations like those of hardness and softness, thickness and thinness, but a variation of the hot and the cold
which seems to have little directly to do with density. On this evidence alone one would expect the instance to be part of an argument that condensation and rarefaction can produce quite
unexpected alterations, and so could be responsible for every kind
of diversity. Hippolytus in 144, however, suggests that hot and cold play a vital part in coming-to-be : in other words Anaximenes
still attributed special importance to the chief cosmogonical substances in Anaximander, the hot stuff and the cold stuff. There is
no mention of this in Simplicius' extract from Theophrastus (143), but Hippolytus or his immediate source is unlikely to be entirely
responsible for it. It is, however, difficult to see how these opposed substances could be basic in Anaximenes' scheme of things, and it
seems highly probable that Theophrastus, seeing that some prominence was given to hot and cold in Anaximenes, suggested that they were for him, as they were for Aristotle and for Theophrastus
himself, one of the essential elements of yevecn$. (The Peripatetic simple bodies were composed of prime matter informed by either hot or cold and cither wet or dry.) This interpretation is anachronistic, and leaves us free to accept the natural one suggested by
Plutarch himself, expressed though it still is in Peripatetic terms. But can even Anaximenes have thought that temperature varied
directly with density? There is such a thing, for example, as hot stone or cold air. This difficulty might not have occurred to him,
since in general it is true that the ascending scale of density represents also a descending scale of temperature, from fire down to
stones; air itself normally not striking one (at any rate in the Mediterranean) as consistently either hot or cold. Alternatively, the instance of breath compressed by the lips might seem to illu
strate that density can affect temperature, without implying that it
always does so to the same degree. 1
1 The instance of the breath is one of the first recorded Greek uses of a detailed observation to support a physical theory. Note, however, (i) that it is not strictly an 'experiment', i.e. the deliberate production of a chain of events the unknown conclusion of which will either confirm or deny a

prior hypothesis; (ii) that because of lack of control and of thoroughness the conclusion drawn from the observation is the exact opposite of the truth; (iii) that the word Ayecj0ai may suggest that the observation was a
common one, not made for the first time by Anaximenes.

The first and third of these passages assert that according to
Anaximenes a god or gods came into being from the primal air; Hippolytus also, in the first sentence of 144, wrote that ' gods and
things divine' arose from air. Theophrastus, therefore, probably said more than that Anaximenes' primal air itself was divine (cf.
Aristotle's assertion in no that Anaximander and most of the
physicists considered their originative stuff to be divine). It is probable, then, that Anaximenes himself said something about gods : it may be reasonably inferred that this was to the effect that such gods as there were in the world were themselves derived from
the all-encompassing air, which was truly divine. If so, Anaximenes might be a precursor of Xenophanes and Heraclitus in their criticisms of the deities of conventional religion; though there is no
evidence that Anaximenes went so far as actually to deny their existence, any more than Heraclitus did. That air itself was divine
147 Afterwards, Anaximenes determined that air is a god, and that it comes into being, and is measureless and infinite and always in motion; as though eitherformless air could be
a god. . .or mortality did not attend upon everything that has come into being.
148 Anaximenes (says that] the air (is god): one must understand, in the case of such
descriptions, the powers which interpenetrate the elements or bodies.
149 He [Anaximander] left Anaximenes as his disciple and successor, who attributed all the causes of things to infinite air, and did not deny that there were gods, or pass them over in silence; yet he believed not that air was made by them, but that they arose from air.

ANAXIMENES
is implied both by Aristotle's generalization and by Actius in 148,
who gives a Stoicizing description of the kind of divinity involved as 'powers permeating elements or bodies', i.e. a motive and
organizing capacity that inheres in varying degrees in the constituents of the world. 1
1 It has sometimes been maintained in the past (e.g. by Burnet, EGP 78) that Anaximenes* gods are innumerable worlds. This is because according to Aetius i, 7, 12 and Cicero N.D. i, 10, 25 Anaximander*s innumerable worlds were called gods (DKi2Ai7). These statements seem to have arisen from a confusion of the innumerable worlds with the stars; and Cicero cannot possibly have had the same kind of evidence for Anaximenes, since in the very next sentence, 147, he only mentions one god as coming into being (and confusedly describes it as infinite, i.e. as primal air). There are in fact only two doxographical indications that Anaximenes postulated innumerable worlds: Aetius n, i, 3 (Stob. only; see p. 124) and 150 Simplicius Phys. 1121, 12 yevnrov 8 KOC! 90ocpTov TOV Hvoc KOCTMOV

There is far less reason to assign innumerable worlds to Anaximenes than to Anaximander, from the state of the doxographical evidence; though something was probably said on the subject by Thcophrastus, on the grounds that Anaximenes, too, postulated what Theophrastus considered to be an infinite originative stuff (sec pp. I23ff.).

Anaximencs presumably gave an account of the development of the world from undifferentiated air; as with Anaximander, only
ps.-Plutarch summarizes the subject in general, and he does little more than apply the obvious changes of air (outlined by Theo
phrastus with reference to continuing natural processes, cf. the
present tense of ytveaOcci in 143) to what could be an a priori cosmogonical pattern. Only in the case of the formation of the
heavenly bodies is there detailed information; here Hippolytus in
152 is almost certainly right as against the last sentence of 151, which seems to impose on Anaximenes ideas from Xenophanes
(ignition through motion) and Anaxagoras (the same, and sun made of earth; cf. pp. i55ff. for another confusion). The heavenly bodies (acrrpa) certainly originate from the earth, but only in that moist vapour is exhaled or evaporated from (the moist parts of) earth; this is further rarefied and so becomes fire, of which the heavenly bodies are composed. The formation of the earth had occurred by the condensation of a part of the indefinitely-extended
primal air. No reason is even suggested for this initial condensa
tion, except possibly the ' eternal motion'; as with Anaximander, this was Theophrastus' way of expressing the capacity of the divine originative stuff to initiate change and motion where it willed: see
p. I28. 1
1 As with Anaximander, there is no ground for postulating a vortex in Anaximenes except Aristotle's generalization in 119; in Anaximenes' case there is not even the mysterious 'producer of the hot and the cold' to be accounted for. Yet Anaximenes was not implicitly excepted from the generalization, as Anaximander may have been (p. 128). However,
Aristotle had reason a few lines earlier, 153, to class Anaximenes with Anaxagoras and Democritus (they all assumed that the earth remains stable because of its breadth); the two others certainly postulated a
from earth. At least, he declares the sun to be earth, but that through the rapid motion it
obtains heat in great sufficiency. 152 The heavenly bodies have come into being from earth through the exhalation arising from it; when the exhalation is rarefiedfire comes into being, andfrom fire raised on high the stars are composed.

vortex, and so Aristotle might have been content to class Anaximenes with
them in this respect too if he was not simply being careless in his use of
'all', irdvTES, in 119. Of course, as Zeller pointed out, vortex-action would produce the variations of pressure required for a cosmos ; though
Anaximenes did not in fact explain the heavenly bodies by direct rarefaction of the extremities.

Anaximenes appears to have originated the conception of the earth as broad, flat and shallow in depth 'table-like' according to
Aetius in, 10, 3 (DK 13 A 20) and as being supported by air. This idea was closely followed by Anaxagoras and the atomists (529 init.
and p. 412), who in details of cosmology conservatively selected from the Ionian tradition. That the earth was supported by air was
obviously an adaptation, encouraged no doubt by the observation of leaves floating in the air, of Thales' idea that the earth floated on water. Aristotle in the continuation of 153 was wrong in suggesting that support is provided because the air underneath is trapped and cannot withdraw: for Anaximenes the surrounding air was
unbounded in any way, and was doubtless unthinkingly supposed to support the earth because of its indefinite depth and because
leaves do float on air. Theophrastus, judging from 151, 154, and Aetius in, 15, 8 (DK 13 A 20), wrote that according to Anaximenes
the earth rides, eiroxeicrOai, on air: the verb occurs in Homer and could well have been used by Anaximenes. Aristotle's 'covers the
air below like a lid' is obviously his own expression, an improvement perhaps on Plato's reference (Phaedo 99 B) to an unnamed physicist Anaximenes or Anaxagoras or the atomists or all of
them who '
puts air underneath as a support for the earth, which
is like a broad kneading-trough'.
153 Anaximenes and Anaxagoras and Democritus say that its [the earth's] flatness is responsible for it staying still: for it does not cut the air beneath but covers it like a lid, which flat bodies evidently do; for they are hard to move even for the winds> on account of their resistance.

154 The earth is flat, being borne upon air, and similarly sun, moon and the other heavenly bodies, which are all fiery, ride upon the air through their flatness.
155 Anaximenes says that the nature of the heavenly bodies is fiery, and that they have among them certain earthy bodies that are carried round with them, being invisible.
156 Anaximenes says that the heavenly bodies make their turnings through being pushed out by condensed and opposing air.
157 Anaximenes says that the stars are implanted like nails in the crystalline; but some
say they are fiery leaves like paintings.
158 Anaximenes says the sun is flat like a leaf.
159 He says that the heavenly bodies do not move under the earth, as others have supposed, but round it, just as if a felt cap turns round our head; and that the sun is hidden not by
being under the earth, but through being covered by the higher parts of the earth and through its increased distance from us.
160 Many of the old astronomers were convinced that the sun is not carried under the earth, but round the earth and this region; and that it is obscured, and makes night, through the earth being high towards the north.
154



ANAXIMENES
That the heavenly bodies were created by the rarefaction into fire
of vapour from the earth was asserted in 152. Like the earth, they
ride on air (154) ; though since they are made of fire, as 154 and 155 confirm, and since fire is more diffuse than air, there is a difficulty which Anaximenes may not have seen in making them rest on air in the same way as the denser earth does. That the
movements of the sun on the ecliptic, of the moon in declination,
and perhaps of the planets, are caused by winds (which are slightly condensed air, cf. 143) is suggested by 156; Aristotle had referred
at Meteor. B i, 353 b 5 and 62, 355 asi (612) to old writers who had
explained the first two of these three celestial motions in just this
way. 157 creates a difficulty, however, in stating that the aorpcc (which can mean all the heavenly bodies, or the fixed stars and the planets, or just the fixed stars) are attached like studs to the ice
like outer heaven (which according to 159 would be hemi
spherical), and not floating free. This could only apply to the fixed stars; but we hear nothing more about the 'ice-like', and indeed the concept of a solid outer heaven is foreign to the little that is known of Anaximenes' cosmogony and to the other details of cosmology. The same term was applied three times by Aetius to
Empcdocles' heaven (which would be spherical), and at n, 13, n (437) he said that Empedocles' fixed stars were bound to the
ice-like, while the planets were free. It appears that this concept may have been mistakenly transferred to Anaximenes. The
second part of 157 is introduced as an opinion held by 'some
people'; but since Anaximenes certainly held the heavenly bodies to be fiery, and since 158 compares the sun to a leaf, it looks as
though he is the author of the opinion that they were fiery leaves,
and as if the text is astray. What the comparison to paintings implies is quite uncertain. If Anaximenes is meant, the aorpcc in
question could be the heavenly bodies in general, or (if the first part is accepted) they could be the planets, which would be distin
guished, as by Empedocles, from the fixed stars on the 'ice-like'.
Presumably this last term refers to the apparent transparency of the sky; it represents an improvement, from the empirical point of view, on the Homeric solid metal bowl (p. 10). Such an improvement would not be uncharacteristic of Anaximenes ; but the attribution of this view to him remains very doubtful.1 The inaccuracy
of doxographical attributions, particularly in Aetius, is probably demonstrated by the second part of 155. It is usually assumed that
155



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Anaximenes postulated these invisible celestial bodies in order to
explain eclipses; but according to Hippolytus i, 8, 6 (DK59A42)
Anaxagoras, too, believed in them. Yet Anaxagoras knew the true cause of eclipses, therefore he cannot have postulated the invisible
bodies for this purpose. The previous sentence in Aetius explains
all: Diogenes of Apollonia postulated these bodies to explain meteorites like the famous one which fell at Aegospotami in
467 B.C. (611). Anaxagoras, too, had probably been persuaded by this notable event to account for meteorites ; but Anaximenes had
no such good reason, and the theory was probably projected on to him from his assumed follower Diogenes. In any case the theory concerned meteorites and not eclipses.2
1 W. K. C. Guthric (CQ,N.S. 6 (1956) 40 ff.) suggests that the simile might conceivably be a physiological one, since in Galen's time, at least, TjAos could be used for a spot or lump growing on the pupil of the eye, while the cornea
itself was sometimes described as 'the ice-like membrane 5
. This membrane
was regarded as viscous, not as solid ; which removes one difficulty of the
attribution to Anaximenes. The date of such terminology is not known ; the simile might possibly have been supplied by Aetius or his immediate source, though this seems unlikely.
a Eudemus(?) in the sequel to 78 (DKi3Ai6) assigns to Anaximenes the
discovery that the moon shines by reflected light. This is incompatible with
the belief that the moon is fiery, and is probably due to another backward
projection, this time of a belief common to Xcnophancs, Parmenides and Empedocles.
The heavenly bodies do not pass under the earth, but (as in the
pre-philosophical world-picture, where the sun, at least, floats round river Okeanos to the north : see pp. I4f.) they move round it,
like a cap revolving round our head as Hippolytus adds in 159. This image is scarcely likely to have been invented by anyone except Anaximenes. The cap in question is a close-fitting, roughly hemispherical felt cap ; conceivably it supports the dubious implication of 157 that the heaven can be regarded as a definite (though
perhaps a viscous) hemisphere, carrying the fixed stars. As has been remarked, this is merely a refinement of the naive view of the sky as a metal bowl. The second part of 159 adds that the sun is
hidden (that is, in its passage from the west back again to the east)
'by the higher parts of the earth' (also by its greater distance; this
may be a doxographical addition). If the sun does not go under
the earth, some explanation has to be given of why it is not visible at night. But do the 'higher parts' refer to high mountains in the
156



ANAXIMENES
north the mythical Rhipaean mountains, that is or to the actual tilting of the flat earth on its horizontal axis? The latter explana
tion was certainly ascribed to Anaxagoras, Leucippus, and
Diogenes, who were strongly influenced by Anaximcnes in cosmo
logical matters. This tilting would explain how the stars could set, supposing that they are somehow fixed in the heaven : they rotate
on the hemisphere (whose pole is the Wain) and pass below the
upper, northern edge of the earth but not below its mean horizontal
axis. Yet attractive as this interpretation is, it is made very doubtful
by 160: here Aristotle refers to the theory of 'higher parts' (again, in ambiguous terms) as being held by many of the old astronomers. But his context, which is concerned with showing that the greatest
rivers flow from the greatest mountains, in the north, makes it quite clear that he understands 'the earth being high to the north' to refer to its northern mountain ranges. It must be assumed that
Aristotle was thinking in part of Anaximcnes, details of whose
cosmological views were known to him (cf. 153, 162) ; Anaxagoras and Leucippus, then, either made an advance on Anaximencs here
or were themselves misinterpreted later. A serious difficulty in the tilted-earth hypothesis is that the earth would not thus float on air, but would slip downwards as leaves do; this applies also to Leucippus' earth. The cap-image must illustrate the hemi
spherical shape of the sky, not its obliquity ; it is difficult, indeed, to sec why the cap should be imagined as being tilted on the head. Thus Anaximenes appears to have accepted the broad structure of the naive world-picture, but to have purged it
of its more obviously mythological details like the sun's golden
bowl (which presumably helped to conceal its light during the
voyage north).

Anaximenes is said to have given the same explanation of thunder and lightning, in terms of wind, as Anaximander: see 132 and
comment. The oar-image may be original. Clouds, rain, hail and snow are mainly due to the condensation of air, as one would
expect; this was indicated by Theophrastus in 143, and Aetius
(also Hippolytus, Ref. i, 7, 7-8, DKi3A7) adds further details. Winds, too, are slightly condensed air (143), and according to Hippolytus the rainbow was due to the reflexion of different sun
beams by air. Aristotle in 162 gives a relatively full account of Anaximenes5
explanation of earthquakes : note that air plays no part in this whatever.

when the descending water coalesces, snow when some windy portion is included together with the moisture.
162 Anaximenes says that the earth, through being drenched and dried off, breaks asunder, and is shaken by the peaks that are thus broken off and fall in. Therefore earthquakes
happen in periods both of drought and again of excessive rains; for in droughts, as has been said, it dries up and cracks, and being made over-moist by the waters it crumbles apart.
163 Anaximenes son of Eurystratus, of Miletus, declared that air is the principle of existing things; for from it all things come-to-be and into it they are again dissolved. As our soul, he says, being air holds us together and controls us, so does wind [or breath] and air enclose the whole world. (Air and wind are synonymous here.) He, too, is in error in
thinking that living creatures consist of simple and homogeneous air and wind .
158



ANAXIMENES
The underlined words here are commonly accepted as a direct quotation from Anaximenes. There must, however, have been some alteration and some re-wording: for the sentence is not in Ionic (cf. 141), and it contains one word, ovyKpcnreT, which could
not possibly have been used by Anaximenes, and another, Koopov, which is unlikely to have been used by him in precisely this sense. 1
That the sentence does, however, represent some kind of reproduction of a statement by Anaximenes is shown by Aetius' comment that 'air' and 'breath [or wind] ' have the same meaning here, and also by the fact that the comparison with the soul complicates the
simple Aristotelian criticism which Aetius is reproducing, that
Anaximenes did not specify a moving cause. On the other hand
the use of 9T|<Ji, 'he says', does not guarantee a direct quotation in
this kind of writing. TOpi^i? of air enfolding all things, is quite likely to be Anaximenean, cf. no; while the concept of the soul as
breath (one suspects that -rrveOnoc, not dcfip, originally stood in the first clause) is certainly an archaic one compare the Homeric distinction between the life-soul, which normally seems to be identified with the breath, and the sensory and intellectual soul
normally called 0u[ji6s. TOV KOCJIJIOV could have replaced e.g. simply
onrrccvTCc,
' all things '. The degree ofre-wording, then, probably is not
very great; unfortunately we cannot determine whether, or how far, it affected the exact point and degree of comparison.
1 ovyKpcrrelv is otherwise first used in Plutarch (twice), then in 2nd-cent. A.D. medical writers and Diog. L. (of restraining the breath etc.) ; also in the Geoponica and the Christian fathers. It is an unnatural compound which could only have occurred in the Koivi*| ; it is really a compendium for ovv^xeiv KOK KpocTeiv. This is illustrated in Plut. Vit. Phoc. 12, ovveKpdrei
T6 POCXIUCOTOCTOV TTJS 6uv<5cneco$ : he kept control of his troops by keeping them together (on a hill-top). KOCTIJIOS originally means 'order', and it is probably not established in the meaning 'world-order' until the second half of the fifth century B.C. It must have been used in descriptions of the
order apparent in nature much before then, and probably by early
Pythagoreans ; Pythagoras himself is credited with using Kdanos = oOpccv6s, but this is perhaps an over-simplification (Diog. L. vm, 48). Heraclitus' K6ajjiov TovSe (220) is probably transitional to the later and widely accepted usage, which appears unequivocally for the first time in Empedocles fr. 134, 5. (This passage was omitted by an oversight from the
discussion in Kirk, Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments 312-14, and the conclusions there should be modified accordingly.)
As it stands the comparison is not very clear: 'Breath and air enclose (surround) the whole world in the way that our soul, being
159



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
breath, holds us (i.e. our bodies) together and controls us.' The similarity in the two cases cannot just be that of the subject, air,
without further implication; it would be pointless to say, for example, 'just as air dries moisture, so does it fill balloons'. Four
possibilities, out of many, may be mentioned : (i) ovyKporrei in Aetius has replaced a simple notion like vvviyei, and the meaning is ' air holds us together, from inside, and the world together, from
outside, (and therefore man and the world are more alike than at
first appears), or <and therefore air is operative in the most diverse
kinds of object}', (ii) irepiexei carries with it the implication of Kcd Kupspvoc, cf. no. The meaning would then be 'as our soul holds the body together and so controls it, so the originative substance
(which is basically the same stuff as soul) holds the world together and so controls it
9
, supporting the inference 'holds together there
fore controls', (iii) 'The soul, which is breath, holds together and controls man; therefore what holds together and controls the world must also be breath or air, because the world is like a large
scale man or animal.' (iv) 'The life-principle and motive force of
man is, traditionally, Trveupia or the breath-soul; (irveOiJia is seen in the outside world, as wind;} therefore the life-principle of the out
side world is TTvev/iJia; (therefore wind, breath, or air is the life and
substance of all things).' Now it has been seen that the form
auyKporrei is impossible for Anaximcnes, but the question also arises whether even a verb like auvfysi could, for him, have described the relation of the soul to the body. The fact is that the
idea of the soul holding together the body has no other parallel in a Presocratic source, or indeed in any Greek source earlier than
Stoic ones and some of the later Hippocratic works. The concept
involved is admittedly not a complex one : for when the life-soul
departs, the body, or most of it, obviously disintegrates, it is no longer held together. Nevertheless the absence of parallels, together with the knowledge that Anaximenes' terminology has certainly been tampered with at this point, makes it unwise to accept the sense even of avv^xei here. This damages (ii), but not (i) and (iii) ; their main arguments can be re-stated with the substitution of
'possess', for example, in place of 'hold together (and control)': for Anaximenes could certainly have held that the soul possesses,
?Xt> the body, meaning that it permeates the whole of it (cf. e.g. Heraclitus fr. 670); and possibly, even, that it controls it. (iv)
avoids emphasizing ovyKpocTel, and depends in part on the fact
1 60



ANAXIMENES
that Anaximenes5 is the first extant use of the word TrvsOiacc, which became common (both for breath and for gust of wind) with the
tragedians ; its possible dual application could have led Anaximenes
to the parallelism of man and the world. Indeed all three remain
ing interpretations, (iv) and the revised forms of (i) and (iii), express this parallelism in one form or another: it is the essence of
the statement to be interpreted. Beyond that, to the particular form of the inference that must have been based upon it, we can
hardly hope to penetrate with certainty. Yet the fully developed and clear-cut use of the inference from the known microcosm, man, to the unknown macrocosm, the world as a whole, does not other
wise appear until the latter part of the fifth century, under the
influence, it is thought, of the new interest in theoretical medicine
at that time ; it is perhaps unlikely to occur in such a plain form as
(iii) so early as Anaximenes. It is possible, moreover, that he did
not argue so logically as even (i) or (iv) suggest; rather that a con
jecture about the world was illustrated by reference to man and the
soul, just as a dogma about the cause of lightning was illustrated by the example of the oar-blade, or that about the heavenly bodies by that of the cap on the head. This would be more plausible as
the first stage in the development of the man-world argument, and accords with Anaximenes' known use of imagery.
All this is necessarily very conjectural. It remains uncertain to
what extent Anaximenes was tending to treat the world itself as
alive, as a kind of huge animal organism; it has been noticed that,
although he introduced a thoroughly rational description of change, Anaximenes in some respects clung to the framework of
the popular, non-philosophical world-construction, and so might retain more of the old anthropomorphic attitude than at first sight
seems probable. However, his perception that air is the cosmic
equivalent of the life-soul in man goes far beyond that attitude ;
it must, in fact, have been an important motive for his choice of air as the originative substance. 1 The mention of soul is important in
itself; apart from 91 it is the first Presocratic psychological statement to survive though the actual structure of the soul envisaged,
as breath, belonged to an age-old popular tradition. Another conception of the soul, as made of the fiery aither which also fills the outer sky, was accepted from another channel of the popular tradition by Heraclitus, who was also to develop the as
sumption, probably implicit in Anaximenes, that man and the
ii 161 K&R



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
outside world are made of the same material and behave ac
cording to similar rules.
1 It is perhaps odd that Aristotle did not name Anaximenes at de an. A 2,
405 a 2 1, where 'Diogenes and some others' are named as holding the view
that the soul is air : Aristotle is arguing that the Presocratics made the soul
out of their cipx^. Plato, Phaedo 96 B (what we think with is air), was
probably referring to Diogenes of Apollonia (cf. pp. 43 7 f.), who held that soul was warm air, thus perhaps conjoining the view of soul as aither or fire. There is no reason to think with Vlastos (AJP 76 (1955) 364 and n. 56) that Diogenes was here exclusively indebted to Anaximenes.
CONCLUSION
Anaximenes is the last of the great Milesian thinkers. He was
obviously indebted to Anaximander, but also probably to Thales, to whose concept of the originative stuff as an actual component of the world he was enabled to return by his great idea of condensation and rarefaction an observable means of change by which quantity controls kind. This idea was probably accepted by Heraclitus and submerged in a system of a rather different nature : for
after the Milesians the old cosmogonical approach, according to which the most important object was to name a single kind of material from which the whole differentiated world could have
grown, was enlarged and moderated. New problems, of theology and of unity in the arrangement, rather than the material, of things, exercised Anaximenes' successors Xenophanes and Hera
clitus although they too (even though the former migrated) were lonians; still more basic departures from the Milesian tradition were made in the west. But when the fifth-century thinkers of the
east and the mainland (Anaxagoras, Diogenes, Leucippus and Democritus) had recovered from the western elenchus of the
Eleatics, it was to the Milesians, and particularly to Anaximenes, that they chiefly turned for details of cosmology ; doubtless because
those details had been in part adapted from, and were still pro
tected by, the popular, non-scientific tradition.

Xenophanes, as opposed to the Milesians, wrote in verse; and a
number of fragments of his work have survived. If we assume that
164 Xenophanes son of Dexios or, according to Apollodorus, of Orthomenes, of Colophon . . .he, being expelled from his native land, passed his time in %ancle in Sicily and in Catana. . . .He wrote in epic metre, also elegiacs and iambics, against Hesiod and Homer, reproving them for what they said about the gods. But he himself also recited
his own original poems. He is said to have held contrary opinions to Thales and Pythagoras, and to have rebuked Epimenides too. He had an extremely long life, as he himself somewhere says: 'Already there are seven and sixty years tossing my thought up and down the land of Greece; and from my birth there were another twenty-five to add to these, if I know how to speak truly about these things.' . . .And he was at his prime in the 6oth
Olympiad. 165 Of the Eleatic school Xenophanes the Colophonian is the pioneer, who Timaeus says lived in the time of Hieron, tyrant of Sicily, and the poet Epicharmus, while Apollodorus says that he was born in the ^oth Olympiad and lasted until the times of Darius and
Cyrus.

he left Colophon in Ionia about the time of its capture by the
Medes in 546/5 B.C. (he certainly knew it before this time, since in
fr. 3, DK.2IB3, he referred to the corruption of the Colophonians
by Lydian luxury), then from his own words in 164 he would have
been born around 570 B.C., twenty-five years earlier. Even if this
assumption is made, his great age at least 92 from his words in 164 makes it impossible to assign his extant poetry to any
narrow period. He referred to Pythagoras (268) and Simonides (DK2iB2i), as well as to Thales and Epimenides no more is known than the bare fact of his reference to the last three and was himself referred to by Heraclitus (193); and Parmcnides was
later supposed to be his pupil. All this is possible enough if he lived from ca. 570 to ca. 475 B.C. The statement of Timaeus (the
4th/3rd century B.C. historian of Sicily) in 165 is compatible with this assumption, since Hiero reigned from 478 to 467 B.C. and
Epicharmus was at Syracuse during this time. Apollodorus is perhaps wrongly reported in 165: Ol. 40 (620-617 B.C.) is improbably early for Xenophanes5
birth, and 'until the times of
Cyrus and Darius' is curious, since Cyrus died in 529 and Darius
gained power in 521. Yet there is no absolutely positive evidence
that Xenophanes died later than e.g. 525, when Pythagoras had
not been long in Italy. However, Diogenes in 164, after men
tioning Apollodorus, put Xenophanes5
floruit in Ol. 60 (540537 B.C.) ; this seems to be the true Apollodoran dating, based on the epoch-year of the foundation of Elea (on which Xenophanes was said to have written a poem) in 540. The details of Xenophanes5 life are even more uncertain. Born
and brought up in Ionia, and obviously acquainted with the
trends of Ionian thought, he was compelled to leave when a young
man, and from then on lived a wandering life, chiefly perhaps in Sicily; his connexion with Elea may have been a later invention
(see pp. 165 f.). He was a poet and sage, a singer of his own songs rather than those of others : he was certainly not, as some have
mistakenly assumed from 164, a Homeric rhapsode. In the longest of his extant elegies (fr. i, which has no immediate philosophical relevance) he has authority enough to outline the rules of behaviour for the symposium that is to follow; he seems therefore to have been
honourably received in aristocratic households.

It is commonly assumed in the doxographers that Xenophanes
spent a part at least of his life in Elca, and that he was the founder of the Eleatic school of philosophy. This is exemplified in 165. That he was Parmenides' master stems from Aristotle in 167, and was
categorically asserted by Theophrastus according to Simplicius (168). Yet Aristotle's judgement possibly arises from Plato's remark in 166. This remark was not necessarily intended as a
serious historical judgement (one may compare the statements in
the Theaetetus (i52D-E, i6on) that Homer and Epicharmus were the founders of the Heraclitean tradition) , as is confirmed by the
addition of the words xal S'TI TrpoaOev, 'and even before'. The con
nexion between Xenophanes and Parmenides obviously depends on the superficial similarity between the motionless one deity of the former and the motionless sphere of Being in the latter although it will be seen that Parmenides' theoretical construction
was reached in a quite different way from Xenophanes', a way
which is in fact incompatible. The extreme example of the treat
ment of Xenophanes as an Eleatic is seen in the pseudo-Aristotelian de Melisso Xenophane Gorgia (DK.2IA28), a treatise written probably about the time of Christ in which Xenophanes' god is
explained in fully Eleatic terms, and the inference is drawn from Aristotle's judgement in 167 that it was neither limited as in
166 Our Eleatic tribe, beginning from Xenophanes and even before, explains in its myths that what we call all things are actually one.
167 For Parmenides seems to fasten on that which is one in definition, Melissus on that
which is one in material; therefore the former says that it is limited, the latter that it is unlimited. But Xenophanes, the first of these to postulate a unity (for Parmenides is said to have been his pupil), made nothing clear. . ..
165



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Parmenides nor unlimited as in Melissus. Unfortunately Simplicity
who could not find at least some physical parts of Xenophanes'
poetry (de caelo 522, 7, DK.2IA47), relied on this treatise and quoted far less than usual from Theophrastus. Other evidence
connecting Xenophanes with Elca is slight: he is said by Diogenes Laertius (ix, 20, DK2iAi) to have written 2000 lines on the foundation of Colophon and the colonization of Elea, but this
probably comes from the stichometrist and forger Lobon of Argos
and is unreliable; while Aristotle (Rhet. 623, i4Oobs, DK.2I A 13) told an anecdote of some advice of his to the Eleans but this was a
*
floating' anecdote also connected with Heraclitus and others.
It is not improbable that Xenophanes visited Elea; that was
perhaps the extent of his connexion with it. He was not in any way typical of the new western trend in philosophy initiated by
Pythagoras; nor was he typically Ionian, but since his ideas were a direct reaction from Ionian theories and from the originally Ionian Homer he is placed in this book with the lonians, and not
in his probable chronological place after Pythagoras like him an emigrant from eastern to western Greece.
HIS POEMS
Some of Xenophanes' extant fragments are in elegiac metre, some are hexameters; while 170 consists of an iambic trimeter followed by a hexameter. This accords with Diogenes' mention of these three
metres in 164. Some at any rate of his poems were called SiAAoi,
'squints' or satires, and the third-century B.C. 'sillographer' Timon
of Phlius is said by Sextus (DK.2I A 35) to have dedicated his own
ZiAAoi to Xenophanes, about whom he certainly wrote; see also
DK.2I A 20-23. According to three late sources, Stobaeus (from an allegorizing author), the Geneva scholiast on the Iliad, and Pollux
(DK.2IA36, 21630, 21339), there was a physical work by Xeno
phanes called TTepl 9uaecos, 'On nature'. The value of this title has
already been discussed (p. 101 and n. 2 on p. 102), and it is only
to be expected that at least some later references to physical opinions in Xenophanes should occur in this form. It is notable
that Aetius, who also quoted the passages cited in the first two
cases above, said nothing about a TTepi 9\iaecos (DK 2 1 A 36 and 46) . That Xenophanes wrote a formal work on physical matters seems
questionable though not so impossible as Burnet would have us
believe (EGPn^f.). Theophrastus, we may observe, said that
1 66



XENOPHANES
Xenophancs' monistic conception was not '
physical' in the normal sense. 1 Xenophanes was not, like Anaximenes or Heraclitus,
primarily engaged in giving a comprehensive explanation of the
natural world. He was interested, without doubt, particularly in theology, and many of his remarks on physical topics are connected with that; others may have been ironical rejections of previous
theories, and others again would naturally reflect the interest which many educated Greeks must have felt about natural
problems at this time. Such remarks, together with comments on
particular poets and thinkers (e.g. 169; cf. also DKsi A 22), could have been expressed in separate poems in a variety of metres
though the extant theological and physical fragments are nearly all in hexameters. There may have been a separate collection of
convivial songs in elegiacs.

177 into thinking that Xenophanes' one god is definitely non-physical,
and is the whole of existence like the Parmenidean Being. But he can hardly have thought this if there was a poem which in any way resembled the works of the Milesians.
HIS IMPORTANCE
Widely different views have been held on the intellectual import
ance of Xenophanes. Thus Jaeger (Theology 52) writes of his 'enormous influence on later religious development ', while Burnet
(EGP 129) maintained that 'he would have smiled if he had known that one day he was to be regarded as a theologian'. Burnet's
depreciation is certainly much exaggerated. Yet it is plain that Xenophanes differed considerably from the Milesians or Heraclitus
or Parmenides. He was a poet with thoughtful interests, especially about religion and the gods, which led him to react against the
archetype of poets and the mainstay of contemporary education, Homer. His attacks on Homeric theology must have had a deep influence both on ordinary men who heard his poems and on other
168 Theophrastus says that Xenophanes the Colophonian, the teacher of Parmenides^ supposed the principle to be single, or that the whole of existence was one (and neither limited nor unlimited, neither in motion nor at rest); and Theophrastus agrees that the
record ofXenophanes' opinion belongs to another study rather than that of natural philosophy.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
thinkers; Heraclitus' attack on blood-purification and images (244), for example, was presumably influenced by him. His positive description of deity conceivably lay behind Aeschylus'
description of divine power in the Supplices (176). The assessment of the true relative merits ofpoets and athletes (fr. 2) was developed
by Euripides in the Autolycus (fr. 282 Nauck, DK2IC2) ; this is a less specialized instance of Xenophanes3 rational intellectualism. Nor is it safe to exaggerate his non-scientific character on the
grounds of his theological interest; the study of gods was not divorced from that of nature, and the deduction from fossils
(pp. lyyff.), whether or not it reflects original observation, shows careful and by no means implausible argument from observed fact
to general hypothesis a procedure notoriously rare among the Presocratics. Some of his other physical statements are unutter
ably bizarre, but we cannot tell how serious they were meant to be.
He was a critic rather than an original dogmatic, not a specialist
but a true ao9icriT|$ or sage, prepared to turn his intelligence upon
almost any problem (though as it happens we know of no political
pronouncements) which is why Heraclitus attacked him in 193. His opinions on almost all subjects deserve careful attention.

tion in Clement. The supplements in 172 are respectively by Diels,
Sylburg and Herwerden; the text as in DK. Line i of 170 is an iambic trimeter.
Xenophanes' criticisms are clear enough : first, the gods of Homer and Hesiod are often immoral this is patently true ; second, and more fundamental, there is no good reason for thinking that the
gods arc anthropomorphic at all. Xenophanes brilliantly perceives,
first that different races credit the gods with their own particular
characteristics (this is an early example of the new anthropological approach which is seen in Herodotus and culminated in the 9U(7i$
vojjios distinction) ; second, as a reductio ad absurdum, that animals would also do the same. The conclusion is that such assessments are subjective and without value, and that the established picture
in Homer ('according to whom all have learned', fr. 10) of gods as
men and women must be abandoned.

173 One god, greatest among gods and men, in no way similar to mortals either in body or in thought. 174 Always he remains in the same place, moving not at all; nor is it fitting for him to
go to different places at different times, but without toil he shakes all things by the thought of his mind.

1 Diog. L. ix, 19 (DKaiAi) implies that the concluding words are not

'Greatest among gods and men' in 173 should not be taken
literally; men are mentioned by a 'polar' usage, as in Heraclitus
fr. 30 (220), where this world-order was made by 'none of gods or men'. This is simply an emphatic device, and for the same reason the plural of 'gods' need not be intended literally. In fact Xeno
phanes wrote of 'gods' in other places also, e.g. in 191; partly, no doubt, this was a concession, perhaps not a fully conscious one, to
popular religious terminology. It seems very doubtful whether Xenophanes would have recognized other, minor deities as being
in any way related to the 'one god', except as dim human pro
jections of it. The one god is unlike men in body and thought it has, therefore (and also in view of 175), a body; but it is motion
less, 1 for the interesting reason that it is 'not fitting' for it to move around. Xenophanes thus accepts the well-established Greek
criterion of seemliness. Not only is it unfitting for the god to move,
but movement is actually unnecessary, for the god ' shakes all things by the active will proceeding from his insight
'
.2 This insight is related
to seeing and hearing, but like them is accomplished not by special organs but by the god's whole unmoving body. This remarkable description was reached, probably, by taking the very antithesis of the characteristics of a Homeric god. That thought or intelligence
can affect things outside the thinker, without the agency of limbs, is a development but a very bold one of the Homeric idea that
a god can accomplish his end merely by implanting, for example, Infatuation ("ATT|) in a mortal. That it was nevertheless a possible
idea is shown by its acceptance and expansion by Aeschylus.3
1 It was probably because of its motionless unity that Xenophanes' god was identified with Parmenides' Being, and later absorbed some of its properties. As early as Timon of Phlius it is called 'equal in every way' (laov oor&VTfl, cf. Uacj60ev laoTraA$ TT&VTTI in Parmenides, 351), and so becomes credited with spherical shape. Xenophanes may have described
it as 'all alike' (6|io{nv in Timon fr. 59, DK.2IA35), since this is implicit in the whole of it functioning in a particular way as in 175 ; its sphericity goes beyond the fragments and is highly dubious.
175 All of him sees, all thinks, and all hears.

Xenophanes arrived at the concept of one god by reaction from Homeric anthropomorphic polytheism; Parmenides arrived at the sphere of Being by logical inference from a purely existential
axiom. The processes are absolutely different, and, as has already been emphasized, Parmenides is unlikely to have been a pupil of
Xenophanes, even though he might have noted the older poet's view with some interest. Aristotle obviously could not understand what Xenophanes meant by his one motionless god, but complained that he 'made nothing clear' and went on to dismiss both him and Melissus as being 'rather too uncouth' (nixpov ccypoiKO
Tepoi). This puzzlement of Aristotle's suggests that Xenophanes did not produce a discursive elaboration of his theological views,
which might not, indeed, have gone very far beyond the extant fragments on the subject. Aristotle's implication that the one god
was neither immaterial (as he thought Parmenides' One to be) nor
176 (3jeus} hurls mortals in destruction from their high-towered expectations, but puts forth no force: everything of gods is without toil. Sitting, he nevertheless at once accom
plishes his thought, somehow, from his holy resting-place.
177 . . . but Xenophanes, thefast ofthese to postulate a unity (for Parmenides is said to have been his pupil), made nothing clear, nor does he seem to have touched the nature of either of
these [sc. Parmenides 9 formal unity or Melissus' material unity]; but concentrating on the whole world he says that the One is god.
171



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
material like Melissus* One (cf. 167) was due to the presence of
both corporeal and apparently non-corporeal elements in Xenophanes' description the body, 6^as, on the one hand (173), and the shaking of all things by intellect on the other (174). It is
significant here that Aristotle did not adduce Anaxagoras' Nous (which was the ultimate source of movement and the finest kind of
body, and which permeated some but not all things) in illustration
of Xenophanes' deity. Instead he made the cryptic remark that
Xenophanes ' with his eye on the whole world said that the One was
god' (for oupccvos can hardly mean 'first heaven' here). This clearly implies that god is identical with the world, which is what
Theophrastus seems to have assumed (168). But Aristotle must be
wrong here: how could the god be motionless if it is identical with
a world which is itself implied to move (174)? It is probable,
indeed, that although Xenophanes' god is not a direct development from the cosmogonical tradition, yet it is to some extent based upon the Milesian idea of a divine substance which, in the
case of Thales and Anaximenes, was regarded as somehow permeating objects in the world and giving them life and movement. Yet Xenophanes cannot have precisely worked out the local relationship of the god on the one hand and the manifold world (which he cannot have intended to reject) on the other. Aristotle, by treating him as a primitive Eleatic, misled the whole ancient tradition on this
point. (It may be noted that if Xenophanes had even implied that the god lay outside the world, then Aristotle would have seized upon
this as an anticipation of the Prime Mover.) The conclusion seems to be that Xenophanes' god was conceived as the negation of Homeric divine properties, and was not precisely located any more than the old Homeric gods were thought by Xenophanes'
contemporaries to be necessarily located on Olympus. It had a body of sorts because totally incorporeal existence was inconceivable,
but that body, apart from its perceptual-intellectual activity, was of secondary importance, and so perhaps was its location.

There is a divergence in the doxographical accounts of the constitution of the heavenly bodies : were they a concentration of fiery
particles as the sun is said to be in 178, the second part of 180, and ps.-Plutarch a few sentences before 179; or ignited clouds as is said of sun and stars in 179, of the sun in 180, and of the stars, which
are said to re-kindle at night like embers, in Aetius II, 13, 14,
DK2IA38? Thcophrastus is named in 180 as supporting the former view, but the latter also, which is widely represented in the
earth is infinite and enclosed neither by air nor by the heaven. There are innumerable suns and moons, and all things are made of earth.
179 He says that the sun and the stars come from clouds.
1 80 Xenophanes says that the sun is made of ignited clouds. Theophrastus in the Physical philosophers wrote that it is made of little pieces offire collected together from the moist exhalation, and themselves collecting together the sun.
181 What they call Iris [rainbow], this too is cloud, purple and red and yellow to behold.
182 Xenophanes said there are many suns and moons according to regions, sections and zones of the earth, and that at a certain time the disc is banished into some section of the
earth not inhabited by us, and so treading on nothing, as it were, produces the phenomenon of an eclipse. The same man says that the sun goes onwards ad infinitum, but seems to move in a circle because of the distance.
173



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
doxographers, must somehow stem from him. It seems possible that the idea of the sun, at least, as a concentration of fire, which arose from the exhalation from the sea, is in part due to a conflation of
Xenophanes with Heraclitus, who probably thought that the bowls of the heavenly bodies were filled with fire nourished in their courses by the exhalation (227). Heraclitus also thought that the sun was new every day, which accords with Xenophanes in 178. But Heraclitus was certainly influenced in other respects by Xenophanes, and the similarity here might be so caused. Yet are the
two theories as different as they appear to be at first sight? It is conceivable that the concentrations of fire resemble fiery clouds, and that some such statement in Theophrastus became dissected in
the epitomes. Alternatively, the sun alone, because of its special brightness, might be a ' concentration' of fire, the other heavenly bodies being merely ignited clouds. That Xenophanes explained the rainbow as a cloud (a development, perhaps, of Anaximenes,
cf. p. 158) is demonstrated by 181; according to Aetius n, 18, i (DK.2I A 39) what we term St Elmo's fire was due to little clouds
ignited by motion, and perhaps this explains the KCU in 181 1. i . It is not safe to deduce from this particle that some heavenly bodies were
clouds ; though it seems possible that this was in fact Xenophanes' view. It is notable that this (as opposed to some of his other ideas)
is an entirely reasonable physical theory, which proves that Xenophanes cannot be classified solely as a theologian; though it is possible enough that his motive for giving physical explanations of the heavenly bodies was to disprove the popular conception of
them as gods. This is certainly implied by the phrase 'what men call Iris' in 181.
Hippolytus' statement in 178 that there are 'innumerable suns and moons' seems to refer to the re-kindling of the sun (and
presumably also of the moon) each day; but in 182 a completely
different and much more bizarre explanation is given. There are many suns and moons in different regions, zones, or segments of the earth; eclipses of the sun are caused by our sun as it were
treading on nothing and being forced into another segment not inhabited by 'us'. The concluding sentence of 182, however, accords with the view of 178 that the sun is new every day. There is certainly a confusion here by Aetius or his source. It seems
probable that the plurality of suns and moons is simply due to their
being renewed each day; that Xenophanes explained eclipses as
174



XENOPHANES
caused by the sun withdrawing to another region of the earth; and that the two ideas became confused. That the sun continues westward indefinitely looks like a deliberately naive statement of the anti-scientific viewpoint (Heraclitus perhaps reacted in a similar
way to excessive dogmatism about astronomy, cf. fr. 3). It is possible that the segments of the earth were regarded as hollow depressions, as in the Phaedo myth ; this might seem to account both
for the sun's apparent rising and setting and for its disappearance at eclipses. Whatever is the true explanation, it is clear that
Xenophanes permitted himselfa certain degree offantasy here (and
possibly, judging by the expression 'treading on nothing', of humour). Perhaps there was some kind of irony; at any rate the
explanation of eclipses must be plainly distinguished from his more empirical, if not necessarily original, views on the actual constitution of the heavenly bodies. 1

Here Xenophanes gives an extreme kind of common-sense account, based upon the Hesiodic description of Tartarus as being as far below the earth as sky is above it (Theog. 720, cf. //. 8, 16 and see p. 1 1) . At Theogony 726 f. (2) the roots of earth and unharvested sea are above Tartarus. Thus in the Hesiodic picture the earth stretched a defined distance downwards, but in reality this distance
was obviously thought of as indefinitely vast the height of the sky, in fact. Xenophanes was not seriously emending it in calling it 'indefinite'. That the earth does stretch downwards indefinitely is

a naive but understandable view which Xenophanes probably intended as an implied criticism of the dogmatic theories of the
Milesians on this subject. Aristotle (de caelo 613, 294a2i,
DK2IA47) criticized Xenophanes and others for holding this
view, on the grounds that they were being idle in not seeking a proper explanation. The first part of 183 is such an obvious statement of fact that it cannot have been intended as anything else ; which confirms our interpretation of the second part. Ps.-Plutarch
(Strom. 4, DKsi A 32) and Hippolytus in 178 state that the earth
is not totally enclosed (frepi^xeoQai) by air. This is presumably a further deduction from 183.

The idea that everything, men included, is composed of and originates from water and earth is a naive popular one : flesh and bone may be compared with earth and stone, blood with water.
Compare our burial service,
* earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust' ; and Iliad 7, 99, 'but may you all become earth and water 5
.
Further, the surface of the earth, that which lies by our feet (183),
is obviously broadly composed of earth and sea. Xenophanes takes this simple apprehension and develops it into a rudimentary

physical theory in 186 (where the main supplement is by Diels) : sea, which is the most extensive form of water, is noted as the source of all rivers as in Homer (see 5) but also of rain and of clouds (which Anaximander had assumed to be condensations of the exhalation from the sea) and of the winds which appear to issue from clouds.
This importance attached to the sea gains significance from the observation and deduction to be described in the next section, that
the earth's surface in its present form must have developed from sea.

The deduction based upon fossils is a remarkable and impressive one. The enumeration of different occurrences is in itself unusually
scientific; the assertion ascribed to Xenophanes in the Aristotelian Mirabilia (DK.2IA48), that Stromboli tended to erupt in the seventeenth year, shows a similar method. Not that the poet him
self need have observed fossils in all three places fossil-impressions
187 Xenophanes thinks that a mixture of the earth with the sea is going on, and that in
time the earth is dissolved by the moist. He says that he has demonstrations of thefollowing
kind: shells arefound inland, and in the mountains, and in the quarries in Syracuse he says that an impression of a fish and of seaweed has been found, while an impression of a bayleaf was found in Paros in the depth of the rock, and in Malta flat shapes of all marine
objects. These, he says, were produced when everything was long ago covered with mud, and the impression was dried in the mud. All mankind is destroyed whenever the earth is carried down into the sea and becomes mud; then there is another beginning of coming-to-be, and this foundation happens for all the worlds. 188 And in some caves water drips down.

might naturally arouse popular curiosity, and so become known ; though it is notable that two of the three places were in Xeno
phanes' Sicilian orbit. (Paros has been doubted on geological grounds; but its north-eastern part is neither marble nor schist, and could have contained fossils. The Director of the Institute for
Geology, Athens, confirms that plant fossils have recently been
found there.) We cannot even be sure that the observations were
first made in Xenophanes' lifetime; they might conceivably have been available to Anaximandcr. However, Xenophanes may
reasonably be accepted as the first to draw attention to their real significance. The conjecture that the earth's surface had once been
mud or slime was again not new; this was a Milesian theory
possibly originating with Thales and certainly held by Anaxi
mander, who believed that life started from mud. The fossils,
however, seemed to be positive proof. It has been seen (pp. 139!'.) that Alexander attributed to Anaximander (as well as to Diogenes)
the belief that the earth is diminishing and will eventually dry up.
In Anaximander, however, there is no positive information that the
process is a cyclical one. Hippolytus in 187 ad fin. definitely ascribes a cyclical theory to Xenophanes : the earth must once have
been mud because plants once existed in what is now rock, fishes
in what is now dry land, and men are destroyed when it turns back
to mud; then they are produced anew, and this happens for all the arrangements of the earth's surface. Thus Xenophanes accepted that living creatures come from mud, after Anaximander; but while Anaximander seems to have seen their destruction as arising from extreme drought, for Xenophanes it was due to flood ; it has
already been suggested that myths of great catastrophes, notably the flood of Deucalion and Pyrrha and the earth-scorching of
Phaethon, may have provided a precedent for this kind of theory. This divergence between the two thinkers was connected with
divergent interpretations of the present trend of change in the earth's surface : for Anaximander it was drying up, for Xenophanes it was already turning back into sea or mud. This might have been a conscious correction on the part of the latter; it may not be coincidence that the sea was receding round Miletus, but in Sicily
was supposed to have engulfed the land-bridge which became the Messina strait. The cyclical transformations between earth and sea neither of which, however, can have been completely eliminated were



XENOPHANES
clearly related to the assertions in 184 and 185 that things come from earth and sea; while the products of sea in 186 showed that
sea is surprisingly potent. 188, fragmentary as it is, may be intended to illustrate the passage between the two basic materials :
Diels and others have thought of stalactitic caves, i.e. of water
turning to earth (rock not being clearly differentiated), while
Deichgraber (Rh. M. 87 (1938) 16) thought that both this and the reverse process might be meant; certainly, damp caves can appear
to produce moisture from earth. This, like much else, remains
uncertain (for example, at what stage is the drying-up of the sea
reversed?). The clear exposition of a cyclical theory supported by concrete evidence is indisputable, and once again shows that Xenophanes must be seriously reckoned with. The way in which
such a cyclical theory could encourage the doxographers in an innumerable-world interpretation is demonstrated by the ambi
guous use of KOCTUOIS in 187 (there properly
* world-arrangements', i.e. of the earth's surface, but appearing to mean 'separate
worlds').

It has been suggested by K. Deichgraber (Rh. M. 87 (1938) 23 ff.)
that Xenophanes in his utterances on the shortcomings of human
knowledge is developing a common poetical contrast between the
comparative ignorance of the poet and the all-knowledge of the
Muse whom he calls on to assist him: cf. e.g. Homer //. 2, 485 f., Pindar Paean 6, 51 ff. Yet this contrast is merely a special form of that between the capacity of the gods in general and the limitations
of men, which is re-stated, after Xenophanes, by Heraclitus in fr. 78 (208) and by Alcmaeon in fr. i (285) . In Xenophanes him
self it is implicit, too, in the assertion of 173 that the one god is
unlike men either in body or in thought. Parmenidcs, when he came to propose dogmatic views which could not be corroborated from human experience, gave them the form of a divine revelation. Yet there is no indication that Xenophanes claimed anything like
a revelation ; 191 suggests that arduous investigation is rewarded, and the probability is that he, like Heraclitus, felt himself to be in
a special state of knowledge for this reason. Deichgraber also thought that 189 was intended as the prooemium of the physical doctrine, not of the constructive theology; but it seems most
unlikely that the plural of 0^91 6ecov should be taken literally to mean 'about the gods of conventional religion'; the phrase means
simply 'about theology'. The assumption of two distinct poems is, it has been suggested, a dubious one; and this is confirmed by the
linking of 'theology' and 'what I say about all things'. The constructive description of the one god must ultimately have come within the scope of 189: it was the antithesis of the mistaken
Homeric concept, but, though it might be 'like the truth', in the words of 190, it could not be taken as absolutely certain. Even
Xenophanes' special position as one who had given much attention to the subject could not ensure that. However, Xenophanes did not suggest that one could not be certain that a belief was wrong;
and his destructive criticism of the Homeric gods, based as it was
on a demonstrated subjectivity, might be accepted as true. 192 shows that Xenophanes thought about problems of relationship, which were to be especially significant for Heraclitus
If god had not made yellow honey, men would consider figs far sweeter.
1 80



XENOPHANES
(pp. i8gf.). For Xenophanes the observation about honey (which may have been proverbial) presumably confirmed his beliefs about the limitation of knowledge again the contrast between god, or
gods, and men is perhaps present. Once again Xenophanes was developing an idea already implicit in popular literature and giving
it a special philosophical significance. After the dogmatism of the Milesians (and also of Pythagoras, mocked by Xenophanes in 268
for his extravagant theory of metempsychosis) an appeal to caution was salutary, and from this time on there was certainly more verbal
reference to the broadest aspects of epistemology. Unfortunately
Xenophanes' revival of the traditional doctrine of human limita
tions, this time in a partly philosophical context, did little else that
is noticeable to curb the naturally over-dogmatic tendency of Greek philosophy in its first buoyant stages.

The information that Heraclitus was at his acme, i.e. aged forty, in Ol. 69 (504501 B.C.) was doubtless taken from the chronographer
Apollodorus: Heraclitus5 middle age is placed about forty years after Anaximenes' assumed acme and Xenophanes' departure from
Colophon. (According to Sotion (Diog. L. ix, 5, DK22Ai) some people said that Heraclitus 'heard' Xenophanes. That there was
some influence is probable enough, but the critical tone of fr. 40,
quoted in 193, does not suggest a formal master-pupil relationship.) There is no need seriously to doubt Apollodorus' dating here, since Heraclitus mentioned Pythagoras and Hecataeus as well as Xeno
193 Heraclitus son ofBloson (or, according to some, ofHerakori) ofEphesus. This man
was at his prime in the 6gth Olympiad. He grew up to be exceptionally haughty and supercilious, as is clear also from his book, in which he says:
'
Learning ofmany things does not teach intelligence; if so it would have taught Hesiod and Pythagoras, and again Xenophanes and Hecataeus.' ... Finally he became a misanthrope, withdrew from the
world, and lived in the mountains feeding on grasses and plants. However, having fallen in this way into a dropsy he came down to town and asked the doctors in a riddle if they could make a drought out of rainy weather. When they did not understand he buried himself in a cow-stall, expecting that the dropsy would be evaporated of by the heat of the manure; but even so he failed to effect anything, and ended his life at the age of sixty.
182



HERACLITUS
phanes, 1 and was perhaps indirectly referred to by Parmenides
(345> cf- P- 272; also fr. 8, 55!!*., 353). Attempts have sometimes
been made to place Heraclitus' philosophical activity later than
the Apollodoran dating would reasonably suggest, after 478 B.C. (and even, most improbably, after Parmenides) ; but they have not
won acceptance, and rest on implausible hypotheses such as that no trace of self-government (suggested by the information of fr. 121 that the Ephesians had exiled Heraclitus' friend Hermodorus)
would be possible in Ephesus until after its liberation from Persia around 478. Heraclitus might have lived longer than Apollodorus'
sixty years (at which age Anaximenes also, and Empedocles
according to Aristotle, were said to die) ; but we may nevertheless provisionally accept that he was in his middle years at the end of
the sixth century and that his main philosophical activity had ended by about 480.
1 The past tense in fr. 40, 'would have taught', need not mean that all those mentioned were dead (Xenophancs at any rate lived until after 478),
but it implies that they were all widely known at the time of writing. Another fragment, 1 29 (261 ; it may be to some extent re-worded but is not
spurious, see p. sign.), implies that Pythagoras was already dead; he is said to have 'flourished' in 532/1 B.C. (p. 217), and perhaps died between 510 and 505. The Suda places Hecataeus* birth as late as 520-516 B.C.
The rest of 193 is quoted as a sample of the kind of biographical
fiction that proliferated round the name of Heraclitus. We are also told by Diogenes that he refused to make laws for the Ephesians but preferred playing with children in the temple of Artemis. Most of these stories are based on well-known sayings ofHeraclitus ; many were intended to make him look ridiculous, and were
invented with malicious intent by Hellenistic pedants who resented
his superior tone. For example, extreme misanthropy is deduced
from his criticisms of the majority of men (e.g. 197), vegetarianism from a mention of blood-pollution in 244, the fatal dropsy from his
assertion 'it is death for souls to become water 5 in 232. He was known as an obscure propounder of riddles, and this is made out to
have cost him his life : the doctors, whom he appeared to criticize
in fr. 58 (p. 190), do nothing to save him. He is said to have buried himself in dung because he had said in fr. 96 that corpses are more worthless than dung; 'being exhaled' refers to his theory of exhalations from the sea. The only details about Heraclitus' life which it might be safe to accept as true are that he spent it in

'THE OBSCURE'
Timon of Phlius, the third-century B.C. satirist, called Heraclitus

obscurus in Latin (Cicero definibus n, 5, 15, etc.). Another common
description in the Roman period was 'the weeping philosopher'. This latter judgement is entirely trivial, being founded partly on humorous references to the idea that all things flow like rivers (cf.
e.g. Plato Crat. 4400, believers in flux are like people with catarrh),
and partly on Theophrastus' well-known attribution to Heraclitus
of neAcxyxoAfoc (Diog. L. ix, 6), by which, however, he meant
'impulsiveness' (see Aristotle's description at Eth.Nic. H 8, i I5ob25) and not 'melancholy' in its later and its modern sense.

over Thales, see pp. 84 ff.). They certainly assumed that Heraclitus
wrote one, and Diogenes tells us that its title was ' On nature'. This
title was regularly assigned to works by those whom Aristotle and the Peripatetics called 'natural philosophers', and cannot be regarded as necessarily authentic in all cases: see n. on p. 102. The division into three sections is unlikely to have been original,
and suggests that Diogenes or his source was thinking of an edition
or collection of sayings, probably made in Alexandria, which followed a Stoic analysis of the parts of philosophy. Diels maintained that Heraclitus wrote no consecutive book, but merely gave
repeated utterance to a series of carefully-formulated opinions or yvooiaoci. This view has found few supporters, but could be correct.
The surviving fragments have very much the appearance of oral pronouncements put into a concise and striking, and therefore easily memorable, form; they do not resemble extracts from a continuous written work. The obstacle to this view is fr. i (197),
a structurally complicated sentence which looks very like a written introduction to a book. Possibly when Heraclitus achieved fame as a sage a collection of his most famous utterances was made, for
which a special prologue was composed. In any event the frag
ments we possess (and not all those in DK are fully authentic) were for the most part obviously framed as oral apophthegms rather than as parts of a discursive treatise ; this was in keeping with Hera
clitus' oracular intentions (see p. 212). The suggestion in 195 that the 'Heracliteans', also mentioned by Plato and Aristotle, were
devotees of the book is almost certainly guesswork; its importance lies in its implication that there was no 'school' of direct followers
at Ephesus. 1 No follower of note is known until Cratylus, an older
contemporary (probably) of Plato, who developed a debased form of Heracliteanism by exaggerating, and combining together, the Ephesian's belief in the inevitability of change and his belief (quite a common one in his time) in the significance of names.

PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Heraclitus, and the local references need not be intended literally; anyone using what Plato would consider to be a Heraclitean type of argument might be ironically associated with Ephesus. Plato's most extreme
Heraclitean acquaintance, at any rate, namely Cratylus, was neither an Ephesian nor from Ionia.
SPECIAL DIFFICULTIES OF INTERPRETATION
As has been seen, Heraclitus was renowned in antiquity for his
obscurity: his pronouncements were undeniably often cryptic, probably intentionally so, and little serious attempt seems to have been made by Plato and Aristotle to penetrate to his real meaning.
Theophrastus, on whom the later doxographical tradition depends,
unfortunately based his interpretation on Aristotle's. He does not
appear to have had access to a complete book by Heraclitus, or even (to judge, for example, from the omission of all but the barest
reference to Heraclitus in Theophrastus' de sensu] to a fully representative collection of separate utterances; in fact he complained that Heraclitus' pronouncements were cither unfinished or incon
sistent. The Stoics further distorted the account. They adopted
Heraclitus as their ancient authority, chiefly on physical matters, and in some respects produced an accurate development of his ideas; for example in their ideal of 6|aoAoyoujJivco$ jfjv, living in accord with Nature (cf. e.g. 198) . In other respects, however, they
radically re-adapted his views to meet special requirements of their own for example in their attribution to him of the idea of
ecpyrosis, the periodical consumption of the whole world by fire.
Our sources subsequent to the founder of Stoicism, Zeno of Citium,
accepted this particular interpretation of Heraclitus, which can be reconciled with some of the extant sayings and may have been
encouraged by Theophrastus, but is incompatible with others and wholly at variance with the basic Heraclitean concept of measure in natural change: see further pp. 196-9 and n. on p. 202.
As for Plato and Aristotle, there is little verbatim quotation of Heraclitus in either, nor were they really interested in the accurate
objective assessment of early predecessors. Plato occasionally mentions him, mainly in a humorous or ironical way and with emphasis
on a view freely attributed to him in the dialogues, that all things
are in flux' TT&VTCC pel or TTCCVTCC X00 ?6*- According to Aristotle at
Met. A 6, 987 a 32, Plato was influenced in youth by the emphasis laid by Cratylus on this kind of view. But all Presocratic thinkers were struck by the dominance of change in the world of our
186



HERAGLITUS
experience. Heraclitus was obviously no exception, indeed he
probably expressed the universality of change more clearly than his predecessors; but for him it was the obverse idea of the measure
inhering in change, the stability that persists through it, that was of vital importance. Plato may have been genuinely misled, especially by fifth-century sophistic exaggerations, in his distortion of Heraclitus' emphasis here; and Aristotle accepted the Platonic flux-interpretation and carried it still further. Other references to Heraclitus in Aristotle attack him for denying the law of contra
diction in his assertions that opposites arc 'the same'. Again, this
is a misinterpretation by Aristotle, who applied his own high logical standards anachronistically : by 'the same' Heraclitus
evidently meant not 'identical' so much as 'not essentially
separate', or 'belonging to one single complex'. In view of these defects in the authors of the ancient assessment it is safer to attempt the reconstitution of Heraclitus' thought, in
the first instance, on the basis of the extant genuine fragments. Even so one cannot hope for more than a very limited under
standing, mainly because Heraclitus, as Aristotle found, did not use the categories of formal logic, and tended to describe the same
thing (or roughly the same thing) now as a god, now as a form of matter, now as a rule of behaviour or principle which was never
theless a physical constituent of things.

epic and Ionic form and that used by Heraclitus. The later form was
evidently given in a gloss, and then this gloss replaced the original word, though the appended explanation remained.
These sayings make it plain that Heraclitus regarded himself as
having access to, and trying vainly to propagate, an all-important
truth about the constitution of the world of which men are a part.
The great majority fail to recognize this truth, 1 which is c common' that is, both valid for all things and accessible for all men, if only
they use their observation and their understanding2 and do not
fabricate a private and deceptive intelligence. What they should recognize is the Logos, which is perhaps to be interpreted as the unifying formula or proportionate method of arrangement of things, what might almost be termed the structural plan of things both individual and in sum. The technical sense of Aoyos in
Heraclitus is probably related to the general meaning 'measure',
'reckoning' or 'proportion'; it cannot be simply Heraclitus' own 'account' that is in question (otherwise the distinction in 199
between ejjiou and TOU Aoyou is meaningless), although the Logos was revealed in that account. The effect of arrangement according
to a common plan or measure is that all things, although apparently plural and totally discrete, are really united in a coherent complex
(199) of which men themselves are a part, and the comprehension
of which is therefore logically necessary for the adequate enact
ment of their own lives. Yet 'formula', 'proportionate arrangement' and so on are misleadingly abstract as translations of this technical sense of Aoyos ' the Logos was probably conceived by Heraclitus as an actual constituent of things, and in many respects
it is co-extensive with the primary cosmic constituent, fire (see
p. 200). It must constantly be remembered that no firm distinc

tion between different modes of existence had yet been envisaged, and that what to us is obviously non-concrete and immaterial, like
an arrangement, might be regarded before Plato as possessing the assumed ultimate characteristic of 'being', that is, concrete bulk.
To put it in another way, the arrangement would not be fully
distinguished from the thing arranged, but would be felt to possess the same concreteness and reality as the thing itself.
1 Men are attacked for this failure in many other extant fragments: see frr. 17, 19, 28, 34, 56, 72. But nothing substantial is added there to the content of 197, 198, 199. Analogous rebukes arc also hurled at indivi
duals Homer, Hesiod, Xenophanes, Hecataeus, Archilochus and Pytha

whom Pythagoras comes in for special attack elsewhere, cf. e.g. 261) pursued the wrong kind of knowledge, TroAvnocOiTi or the mere collection of disparate and unrelated facts.

These fragments exemplify four different kinds of connexion between evident opposites :
(i) In 202 the same thing produces opposite effects upon
different classes of animate object; so also fr. 13 (pigs like mud
(but men do not)) and fr. 9 (donkeys prefer rubbish to gold, {men gold to rubbish)). (ii) In 203' different aspects of the same thing may justify opposite descriptions ; so also fr. 58 (cutting and burning (which are normally bad) call for a fee when done by a surgeon) and
fr. 59 (the act of writing combines straight, in the whole line, and
crooked, in the shape of each letter) . (iii) In 204 good and desirable things like health or rest are
seen to be possible only if we recognize their opposites, sickness or weariness; so probably fr. 23 (there would be no right without wrong). (iv) In 205 certain opposites are said to be essentially connected
(literally, to be 'the same', a pregnant expression) because they succeed, and are succeeded by, each other and nothing else. Thus the hot substance and the cold belong to what we might call
a hot-cold continuum, a single entity (i.e. temperature). So also fr. 57 : night and day, which Hesiod had made parent and child,
are, and must always have been, essentially connected and coexistent.
These four kinds of connexion between opposites can be further classed under two main headings : (a) i-iii, opposites which inhere
in, or are simultaneously produced by, a single subject; (b) iv, opposites which are not susceptible of simultaneous distinction
in relation to different objects, or parts of the subject, but are con
nected through being different stages in a single invariable process.
1 This seems the most probable interpretation of ' the road up and down*. Theophrastus and a few of his followers applied the phrase to the interchanges between world-masses in the cosmic process, and most modern scholars have done the same. But the same words 'one and the same' are
used of evident opposites in the formally similar fr. 59; and Hippolytus,
a reliable source of verbatim quotations from Heraclitus who seems to have
sleeping and young and old: for these things having changed round are thosey and those having changed round are these.

HERAGLITUS
used a good handbook in which sayings of Heraclitus were grouped by
subject, certainly took ' the road up and down ' as another illustration of
the unity of opposites and not as a cosmological metaphor, to which indeed
it is not completely appropriate. We should think of an actual road or
path, which is called * the road up ' by those who live at the bottom, ' the
road down* by those at the top. Vlastos, AjfP 76 (1955) 349 n. 26, objects to this interpretation on the grounds of its 'banality'; but it only appears banal to us because of its familiarity, and fr. 59, for example, undoubtedly
has precisely the same quality.
These and similar reflexions (cf. also frr. 103, 48, 126, 99), on
objects conventionally treated as entirely separate from and opposed to each other, evidently persuaded Heraclitus that there is never any real absolute division of opposite from opposite. (For
a re-statement of this view by Anaxagoras see p. 381.)
(3) Each pair of opposites thus forms both a unity and a plurality. Different pairs are also found to be interconnected

1 avAA&yies is textually slightly preferable to auvdyies, which would mean
'things in contact'. A more important question is whether the word is
subject or predicate. Snell showed that it is subject, contrary to the
common view; neither 'wholes' and 'not wholes' nor 'in tune' and 'out of tune' are typical pairs of Heraclitean opposites, nor indeed are they connected by Heraclitus' regular principles.
In 206 'things taken together' must be, primarily, opposites: what
one takes together with night, for example, is day. (Here we may note that Heraclitus expresses what we should call 'quality'
always in terms of simple extremes, which he can then classify as opposites; so that all change can thus be regarded as that between
206 Things taken together are whole and not whole, something which is being brought together and brought apart, which is in tune and out of tune; out of all things there comes
a unity, and out of a unity all things.

opposites.) Such '
things taken together
5 are truly described in one
sense as 'whole', that is, forming one continuum, or in another
sense as 'not whole', that is, when acting as single components. Applying these alternative analyses to the conglomeration of 'things taken together', we can see that 'from all things a unity is formed', and also that from this unity ( ev6$) there can
be separated the superficial, discrete, plural aspect of things
207 asserts a relationship between god and a number of pairs of
opposites, each pair separately connected by automatic succession; these, as the glossator saw, probably stand for all pairs of opposites however connected. The relationship in question is a loose pre
dicative one; and Heraclitus, perhaps enlarging on Xenophanes, seems to have regarded 'god' as in some probably undefined way
immanent in things, or as the sum total of things. 1 One recalls the Milesian view that the originative material, which may still be
represented in the world, is divine. Heraclitus, although not so
explicitly corporealistic in his conception of divinity, was little more 'religious' than the Milesians in that he did not associate 'god' with the need for cult and worship (although he did not
utterly reject all cult, see p. 212). The particular point of 207 is that every opposite can be expressed in terms of god : because peace is divine it does not follow that war is not equally divine, is not
equally permeated by the directive and formulaic constituent which is on occasions equated with the whole ordered cosmos
(pp. 1 88, 200) . God cannot here be essentially different from Logos ; and the Logos is the constituent of things which makes them opposed, and which ensures that change between opposites will be proportional and balanced overall. God, then, is said to be the
common connecting element in all extremes, just as fire is the
common element of different vapours (because these were conceived as a compound of fire with different kinds of incense) ;
change from one to another brings about a total change of name,
which is misleading, because only a superficial component has altered and the most important constituent remains. This difficult
saying implies that, while each separate pair of contraries forms a single continuum, the several continua, also, are connected with each other, though in a different manner. Thus the total plurality
of things forms a single, coherent, determinable complex what Heraclitus called 'unity'.

1 Hippolytus, the fullest source here, and usually a reliable one, has
6iJioAoyeiv (for 6noAoyeei) and TraAfvTpoiros. 5u^9peTai is a probable
restoration from Plato's version, Symp. 187 A, and avoids a difficult use of
6poAoye!v a verb which could easily have been repeated accidentally, since Hippolytus used it twice in the infinitive just before he quoted the
fragment. TTCcAfvTovos has as much support as TrocAivTpOTro$ in the versions
(of the second part only) by Plutarch and Porphyry, and is preferred
because it gives a fully intelligible sense. G. Vlastos, AJP 76 (1955) 348 fT., defends iraAfvTpoTros : his strongest point is that Diog. L. ix, 7, a summary and often imprecise version of Theophrastus, has the phrase 8ioc TTJS vccvTioTpOTrfjs f)pii6o6oci. This certainly appears at first sight to be based upon -rrccAhnrpOTros <5cpi*ov(ii; yet the gvavTiOTpoirri (which would have to
be IvavTiOTpOTrioc if derived from an adjectival form -Tpoiros) probably refers to the Tpoirai of 221, combined (as they certainly were by Theophrastus, cf. the fuller account of him in Diog. L. ix, 8) with the 'way up
and down' interpreted as change between opposites. f|pn6o-6oct could be a general application of the concept of dpnovin, cf. 210. It is also possible

that there was doubt about the form of the epithet as early as Theophrastus, as there certainly was later. Objections to TrccAfvTpOTros are (i) can 'a turning-back connexion' really be said, even by Heraclitus, for 'a connexion achieved by contrary changes'? Perhaps it can it would be possible, certainly, in Aeschylus. If this is accepted, the meaning given fits in well enough with Heraclitus' theory of natural change. Unfortunately (ii) it
does not make any intelligible sense when applied, as it is, to the bow and
the lyre. Vlastos suggests that the sequence of tension and relaxation of the string, which discharges the arrow or makes the note, is meant: but this sequence cannot be described as an * adjustment' or 'connexion', in
any kind of Greek. The TrocAfvTpOTros K&evOos in Parmenides fr. 6 (345) is, of course, perfectly intelligible, and does not necessarily contain a reference to Heraclitus (cf. p. 272), or at any rate to this fragment.
What is stated in 2IO is a general rule; comparison with 211
(where 9\}cn$ probably means not 'Nature' but 'a thing's true constitution'), and also with 212, suggests that the rule is intended to apply to the working of the world as a whole, as a sum of constituent parts whose connexion is not apparent at first sight.
The unseen connexion of opposites is in fact stronger than other, more obvious types of connexion. 1 212, one of Heraclitus' most
familiar sayings, contains a characteristic looseness in predication :
the subject of ^uiJ^psTcci is probably not (TO) Sicc9ep6nevov, i.e. another example of a specific opposite, but a generalizing 6ioc9ep6piev6v <TI>, where 'anything being carried apart' means something like 'any discrete pair of opposites
5
. Thus the sense
given is similar to that implicit in au^epoiJievov 8toc9ep6nEVOV in 206: any pair, or sum of pairs, can be regarded either (a) as heterogeneous and analysable in terms of separate extremes, or
(b) as tending together with itself to form a unity. Now comes an
important addition: there is (sc. in it, i.e. it exemplifies) a con
nexion or means of joining (the literal sense of dp^ovhi) through opposite tensions,2 which ensures this coherence just as the tension in the string of bow or lyre, being exactly balanced by the outward tension exerted by the arms of the instrument, produces
a coherent, unified, stable and efficient complex. We may infer that if the balance between opposites were not maintained, for
example if 'the hot' (i.e. the sum of hot substances) began seriously to outweigh the cold, or night day, then the unity and coherence of the world would cease, just as, if the tension in the bow-string exceeds the tension in the arms, the whole complex is destroyed.
1 A number of fragments imply that it needs both faith and persistence to find the underlying truth. So e.g. 213 Fr. 18, Clement Strom, n, 17, 4

direction eventually leads to change in the other., that is, if there is unending

Strife or war is Heraclitus' metaphor for the dominance of change in the world. It is obviously related to the reaction between
opposites; most kinds of change (except for e.g. growth, which is the accretion of like to like), it may be inferred, could be resolved
into change between opposites. At all events, change from one extreme to the other might seem to be the most radical possible. The 'war' which underlies all events, and is responsible for different and indeed opposed conditions of men and for their fate
after death (cf. 239 and 242 for the difficult assertion about men
and gods), is called 8iKT|, the 'indicated way' (from the same root as 5eiKvuni), or the normal rule of behaviour. This must be a deliberate amendment of Anaximander's dictum (112) that things pay retribution to each other for the injustice of their alternate encroachments in the processes of natural change. Heraclitus points out that if strife that is, the action and reaction between

searched out, and difficult to compass.
214 // is necessary to know that war is common and right is strife and that all things

opposed substances were to cease, then the victor in every
contest of extremes would establish a permanent domination, and the world as such would be destroyed. 1 Yet just as in a battle there
are temporary local stoppages, or deadlocks produced by the exact balance of opposing forces, so Heraclitus must have allowed that temporary stability is to be found here and there in the cosmic
battlefield, so long as it is only temporary and is balanced by a corresponding state elsewhere. This would not diminish the
validity of the domination of strife (which, as for Anaximander,
provides a metaphorical motive for change), but it allows the principle to be applied to the world of our actual experience, in
which all things must eventually change but some things are for the time being obviously stable.

Aristotle here makes explicit what is implicit in Plato, that many
things (those that appear to be stable) must be undergoing invisible
or unnoticed changes. Can Heraclitus really have thought that a
rock or a bronze cauldron, for example, was invariably undergoing invisible changes of material? Perhaps so ; but nothing in the
extant fragments suggests that he did, and his clearly-expressed
reliance on the senses, provided they be interpreted intelligently, suggests that he did not. 1 It cannot be too strongly emphasized that before Parmcnides and his apparent proof that the senses
were completely fallacious a proof that was clearly a tremendous
shock to his contemporaries gross departures from common sense must only be accepted when the evidence for them is extremely strong. In the present case it is quite conceivable that Plato was
misled by post-Heraclitean exaggerations and distortions of Heraclitus' emphasis on eventual change; in particular, perhaps, by Cratylus, who thought that you could not step even once into
the same river (Aristotle Met. FS, ioioai3), and who is said by
Aristotle to have influenced Plato as a young man (Met. A 6,
1 Sec 200, 2OI. It is true that Melissus in fr. 8 (392) drew attention to the
appearance that some 'stable* things do change: iron is worn away by the
finger, and so on. This observation occurs in a context which perhaps has verbal references to Heraclitus (e.g. TO TE 6sp|Ji6v vyvxp6v yfveciOai xal T6 vyvxPov fepnov, cf. fr. 126). Yet there is no reason whatever to think that Melissus meant that change must in this case be continuous, even though it
can be invisible. Every time the finger rubs, it rubs off an invisible portion
of iron; yet when it does not rub, what reason is there to think that the
iron is still changing? Melissus' point is rather that appearances show that
218 Heraclitus somewhere says that all things are in process and nothing stays still, and likening existing things to the stream of a river he says that you would not step twice into the same river.
219 And some say not that some existing things are moving, and not others, but that all things are in motion all the time, but that this escapes our perception.
197



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
everything, even the apparently stable, is subject to change. This is precisely what Heraclitus must have thought; he may or may not have mentioned
infra-visible changes, but in any case would only accept them when they were deducible and continuous change is not deducible in many appa
rently stable objects. Melissus' argument, of course, was that the senses must be fallacious; for between Heraclitus and himself had come Parmcnides. With Empedoclean effluences (p. 343) the situation changes.
2 Vlastos, AJP 76 (1955) 338 ff., argues that Cratylus' rejoinder as reported by Aristotle implies a previous statement just like that in Plato (218), that you could not step twice into the same river; in fact what Heraclitus said was not fr. 12 (217) but something very like Plato's version, and the Platonic interpretation of universal flux is correct. But (i) Aristotle's formulation of Cratylus1 emendation of Heraclitus is likely enough to be based on Plato's summary, rather than on the exact form of
statements by Cratylus or Heraclitus; and (ii) in any case, the riverstatement could have been slightly distorted by other sophists even before
Cratylus; or he (who certainly grossly exaggerated Heraclitus' belief about names) could have altered its formal expression himself. As for the question of which is the more original form of the river-statement, fr. 1 2 or Plato's version, the former has every appearance of belonging to Heraclitus, being in natural and unforced Ionic and having the characteristic rhythm of archaic prose; while the latter looks Platonic, and could
more easily be a misunderstanding of fr. 1 2 than vice versa. See further
Kirk, Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments 367 ff., as well as Vlastos, loc. cit. Cratylus' 'improvement 5 of Heraclitus is implicit in a saying ascribed,
almost certainly wrongly, to Heraclitus, fr. 49 a in DK: 'We step and do
not step into the same rivers; we are and are not.' This last existential
aphorism is particularly improbable, and the whole sentence can be
explained as a development of fr. 12, where the mention of the human
standard (' those who step . . . ') probably has no purpose other than the provision of an animate point by which the flow can be gauged.
In 217 the tentative addition to fr. 1 2 of the verbs which compose
fr. 91 (which the context, and their own nature, seem to indicate as describing the flow of water, with special attention to the
regularity of its replacement) brings out what is implicit in fr. 12 : that the unity of the river as a whole is dependent upon the
regularity (also perhaps suggested by the repetition eh-gpoc ml 6Tepa) of the flux of its constituent waters. The river provides an image of the balance of constituents in the world. The river
statement does not suggest for one moment that everything singly behaves like a river. Obviously, a rock or a mountain or a table is
temporarily static, and will remain so, perhaps, for a long time : what matters for Heraclitus5 theory of balanced reaction and strife
is that eventually it should change and so help to maintain the process of world-constituents. Meanwhile the stability of a mountain, for
198

example, is balanced by a corresponding stability elsewhere of corresponding masses of sea, and of fire or aither (the mountain being mostly earth) ; on which see the next section.

1 Vlastos, op. cit. 344 ff., argues that 'the same of all* is original, and
contrasts the real physical world of common experience with the deceptive
private imaginings of men who do not follow the Logos (cf. 198 etc.). This would be possible enough if (what does not seem particularly probable) fr. 30 followed directly upon a reference to men's delusions;
but neither Plutarch nor Simplicius, who also quote the first part of the
fragment, gives the debated phrase. More important, Vlastos does not
mention that Clement in the context of the quotation is following some Stoic source in endeavouring to explain away this fragment's incon
sistency with the Stoic tf^rosw-interpretation, by arguing that 'this world-order* in Heraclitus is the all-inclusive, eternal system, T6v dir6c<TT|S Tfjs ouaiccs I5(co$ iroi6v KO<THOV as Clement had just said, and not this particular world. Thus the interpolation is very strongly motivated; see further Kirk, Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments 30 7 if.

PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
Fire is the archetypal form of matter. The world-order as a whole
can be described as a fire of which measures are being extinguished,
corresponding measures being re-kindled; not all of it is burning at the same time. It always has been, and always will be, in this condition (220). Cosmogony in the Milesian sense is therefore not
to be found in Heraclitus. Fire cannot be an originative stuff in the way that water or air was for Thales or Anaximenes, and according to Aristotle and his followers it is no longer indefinite or
infinite (cf. Theophrastus ap. Simpl. Phys. 24, i, DK 22 AS); it is nevertheless the continuing source of the natural processes in 221.
Regarded as a part of the cosmos, fire is on a par with sea (presum
ably representing water in general, as in Xcnophanes) and earth, as one of the three obvious world-masses. The pure cosmic fire was probably identified by Heraclitus with ccl0f|p (aither), the
brilliant fiery stuff which fills the shining sky and surrounds the world: this aither was widely regarded both as divine and as a
place of souls. 1 The apprehension that the soul may be fire or aither, not breath as Anaximenes had thought, must have helped to determine the choice of fire as the controlling form of matter
(cf. p. 161). 223 shows that Heraclitus' fire the purest and brightest sort, that is, as of the aithcrial and divine thunder
bolt has a directive capacity. In part this reflects the divinity
assigned to aither in the popular conception; more important, perhaps, is the fact that all fire (even the lower, mundane sort), by the regularity with which it absorbs fuel and emits smoke, while
maintaining a kind of stability between them, patently embodies the rule of measure in change which inheres in the world process,
and of which the Logos is an expression (pp. i88f.). Thus it is naturally conceived as the very constituent of things which actively determines their structure and behaviour which ensures
not only the opposition of oppositcs, but also their unity through
'strife'.

), Helen 1014!?.; Aristophanes Peace 832 f. None of these passages, of course, is as early as Heraclitus, and 226 clearly shows the influence of Anaxagoras and Diogenes of Apollonia. But the belief is described as ancient in 224 and 226, and is so widely represented in iifthcentury poetry that it must have been well established and widely known by then. It is comparable with the belief in the divinity of the sun, which must be of great antiquity.
The cosmos consists, broadly, of the masses of earth (inter
penetrated with secondary fire, as in volcanos) and sea, surrounded by the bright integument of fire or aithcr. This fire, we may conjecture on the basis of 221, was regarded by Heraclitus as the
motive point of the cosmological processes: from its region appears to come rain, which ultimately nourishes the sea, and it is itself
replenished (for fire 'consumes' moisture) by the moist evaporation ascending from the sea. Sea, as Xcnophanes had shown, turns into earth, and earth at other times and places changes to water. Thus sea and earth are what cosmic or aithcrial fire 'turns to* (221). x Changes between the three world-masses are going on simultaneously in such a way that the total of each always remains
the same. If a quantity of earth dissolves into sea, an equivalent
quantity of sea in other parts is condensing into earth, and so with changes between sea and 'burner' (fire) : this seems to be the sense of 221. The Aoyos or proportion remains the same again it is the
measure and regularity of change, this time of large-scale cosmo
logical change, that is stressed. The only surprising thing about this cosmology is its apparent avoidance of analysis into opposites and
of the relation of opposites to firc-sea-earth. The probable explanation is that the opposites are invoked in the logical examination of change, but that in the examination of large-scale changes a
more empirical description can be retained, particularly as the Logos is closely related to fire. The connexion between the two
types of analysis is the underlying concept of measure and
proportion.
226 What we call 'hot' seems to me to be immortal and to apprehend all things and to see and hear and know all things, both present andfuture. This, then, the most of all, when
all things became confused, went out to the furthermost revolution, and seems to me to have been what was called aither by the men of old.

1 Or 'is exchanged for* in the phrase of 222. Note that 220 and 222 both utterly invalidate the Stoic ascription to Heraclitus of a periodic
iKTrupcoats or consumption of the world by fire. The world-order is and shall
be an ever-living fire kindling and going out in measures (simultaneously, that is) : and in the trade-image of goods and gold the situation could not arise that all the goods (the manifold world) are simultaneously absorbed
into gold (fire), so that there is all gold and no goods. Theophrastus, after
referring to this image, added 'He makes an order and a definite time of the change of the world according to some destined necessity* (Simpl. Phys. 24, 4ff., DK22A5). It seems probable that Theophrastus was here misapplying Aristotle's dictum that 'things are destroyed into that from which they came '
; influenced in addition, perhaps, by Aristotle's curious
remark (de caelo A 10, 27gb 14, DK.22 A 10) that Empcdocles and Heraclitus
made the world fluctuate between its present condition and destruction.
Aristotle may have been thinking of a great-year cycle of 10,800 years
apparently mentioned by Heraclitus (DK.22 A 13); this may have applied to a cycle of favoured souls, or conceivably to the time taken for a single portion of fire to pass through all its stages, and in either case could have
been misleading if presented incompletely. Plato (Soph. 242 D, DK.22 A 10) clearly distinguished between Heraclitus' simultaneous unity and plurality of the cosmos and Empedocles' separate periods of Love and Strife. At the same time, they are mentioned together as both alike believing in the unity and plurality of the cosmos; and Aristotle's coupling of the two might conceivably have been motivated by the Platonic comparison, the important distinction between them being overlooked.

HERACLITUS
229 Fr. 94, Plutarch de exiL 11, 604 A "HAio$ oO\
ei S jar), 'Epivves niv AIKT|$ e-rriKovpoi
No extant fragment clearly reveals Heraclitus' ideas on the nature
of the heavenly bodies; but Theophrastus evidently gave a moderately detailed if subjective account of his views, the non
Peripatetic parts of which there is no reason to disbelieve.
Diogenes preserves the fullest version of this account, of which 227 is a part; for the rest (the stars are further from the earth than the
sun, the moon nearer) see DK.22AI. The heavenly bodies are solid bowls filled with fire. This fire is maintained by moist exhalations or evaporations from the sea, which are somehow collected in them and burned as fuel. 1 This is presumably the way in which water changes into fire in the balanced interaction between world-masses described in 221. The idea that, since
moisture is evaporated by fire, fire is physically nourished by it is a naive and popular one. Similarly the solid celestial bowls are
probably a quasi-scientific elaboration of the popular myth that the sun each night sails from west to east in a golden bowl round the northern stream of Okeanos (see 7, 8). Eclipses and phases of the moon were explained by the turning away of the bowls : but no
true cause (as opposed to a mere mechanism) was given, and Diogenes (ix, n, DK.22AI), presumably still following Theophrastus, stated that Heraclitus said nothing about the constitution of the bowls. Heraclitus was probably not interested in astronomy for its own sake, and seems to have been content with
adaptations of popular accounts so long as his general theory of cosmological change was preserved. 228 is consonant with Theophrastus' account of the celestial bowls: the sun is 'new'
every day in the sense that its fire is replenished each night with
entirely fresh exhalations. Naturally, this replenishment and consumption form a regular cycle, though one which could admit slight variations. The principle of measure in natural change is
illustrated also in 229, where the sun is restrained by Dike, the
personification of normality and therefore regularity, from exceeding its measures for example from coming too close to the earth
or shining beyond its proper time.
229 Sun will not overstep his measures; otherwise the Erinyes, ministers of Justice, will find him out.
203



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
1 Theophrastus and his followers usually attributed two exhalations, a moist and a dry one, to Heraclitus: this is most probably a misunder
standing based upon Aristotle's own dual-exhalation explanation of
meteorological (as opposed, in his case, to astronomical) events. Aristotle seems to have elaborated this theory out of Heraclitus' ideas on the importance of the exhalation from the sea and other terrestrial waters; but it appears from passages in his Meteorologica that Aristotle considered the
dry exhalation from the earth to be his own discovery (Kirk, Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments 273^). Yet, because it is kindled, he can treat Heraclitus'
exhalation as fiery : see p. 207 n. i . The explanation of night and day (as well as winter and summer) as due to the alternating prevalence of the dark and bright exhalations, ascribed to Heraclitus in Diogenes' Theophrastean account, is absurd : Heraclitus knew as well as anyone that day is due to the sun, and declared in fr. 99 that ' if there were no sun, it would
be night'.

On the other hand the Stoics took yvconr|v in Heraclitus' saying as direct object of iTdoTccaOoci (cf. Gleanthes Hymn to ^eus 34f.) as representing their
own familiar idea of divine Reason ; that they should place this interpretation on the dictum is not surprising, in any case. But that Heraclitus should have used yvcb|Jir| by itself, with no definite article and no possessor
expressed, to stand for Fire or Logos (cf. 223), has seemed improbable to some. Each of the two alternative interpretations has its difficulties, but the resulting sense in each case is not very different: wisdom consists in understanding how the world works which in any event involves understanding the divine Logos.
230 gives the real motive of Heraclitus' philosophy: not mere
curiosity about nature (although this was doubtless present too)
230 The wise is one thing, to be acquainted with true judgement, how all things are steered through all.
231 One thing, the only truly wise, does not and does consent to be called by the name of

but the belief that man's very life is indissociably bound up with
his whole surroundings. Wisdom and therefore, it might be
inferred, satisfactory living consists in understanding the Logos,
the analogous structure or common element of arrangement in things, embodying the [JiETpov or measure which ensures that change does not produce disconnected, chaotic plurality. Absolute understanding here can only be achieved by god (231; cf. also 209), who
in some respects, therefore (but not of course in anthropomorphism
and in the demand for cult), resembles the Zeus of the conven
tional religion. God, with his synoptic view, is thus e the only thing that is (completely) wise'. Fire (223) and the Logos itself (199)
are to a large degree co-extensive with, or different aspects of, this
completely wise thing.
It remains to describe Heraclitus' views about men their soul,
institutions and ideas. But for Heraclitus this subject was in no way separate from the study of the outside world; the same materials and the same laws are found in each sphere. 230 clearly
depends upon this assumption, which is implicit also in 197 (fr. i).

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Anaximenes had probably drawn cosmological conclusions from the nature of the soul, which, following the Homeric view, he envisaged as breath. Heraclitus abandoned this idea in favour of
another popular conception of the soul, that it was made of fiery
aither. On this foundation he built up a rationalistic psychological
theory, in which for the first time (unless Pythagoras himself went further in this direction than we suspect) the structure of the soul is related not only to that of the body, but also to that of the world as a whole.
/The soul in its true and effective state is made of fire : in 232
soul replaces fire in a list of what might otherwise be taken for the
main interactions of the world-masses (cf. 221). The implication
is not only that soul is fiery, but also that it plays some part in the great cycle of natural change. It comes into being from moisture
(and, if it is analogous to cosmic fire, is maintained, at least in part, by some kind of moisture sec p. 203), and is destroyed
when it turns entirely into water. 1 The efficient soul is dry (233),
that is, fiery. A soul that is moistened, for example by excessive drinking as in 234 (which well illustrates the still naive character of Heraclitus' psychology), is diminished in capacity and makes its owner behave childishly, without either wits or physical
strength. Thus intellect is explicitly placed in the soul. The soul, which can move to all parts of the body at need,2 has limits that
cannot be reached (235) ; probably the thought here is not so much
of the problem of self-consciousness as of the soul being a repre
sentative portion of the cosmic fire which, compared with the
individual, is obviously of vast extent. Thus it could be conceived as an adulterated fragment of the surrounding cosmic fire,3 and so as the possessor in some degree of that fire's directive power
(223). All this, as has been indicated, is a development of what may be reasonably taken as a popular conception of the nature of aither (cf. n. i on p. 200); but a simpler and more empirical indication of the fiery nature of soul was at hand, since it must have been commonly observed that warmth is associated with the
living body and that the dead, soulless body is cold (so Vlastos,
op. cit. 364^).
1 A Stoic re-formulation of 232, in which air is characteristically added to the three genuinely Heraclitean world-masses (to produce the four 'elements' of post-Empedoclean speculation), gives *the death of fire is the birth of air', etc.; this appears as fr. 76 in DK, but is totally misleading
206



HERAGLITUS
for Heraclitus. He appears to have ignored air as a major cosmic consti
tuent, in spite of Anaximenes ; though the exhalation from the sea, by
which sea turns to fire, might have been termed df|p. Aristotle (de an. A 2,
405 a 24, DK.22AI5) wrote that Heraclitus made soul the same as the material principle, namely 'the exhalation from which he compounds the other things '. Aristotle himself accepted two kinds of exhalation, one being fiery, so that the 'exhalation* here represents fire.
2 According to the scholiast on Chalcidius (fr. 670 in DK) Heraclitus
compared the soul to a spider which rushes to any part of its web which is
damaged. The soul is described as 'firme et proportionaliter iuncta* to the body; the idea of proportion is appropriate to Heraclitus. Cf. on Anaximenes, pp. i58ff. 3 So Macrobius S. Scip. 14, 19 (DK.22AI5), 'Heraclitus said that the soul is a spark of the essential substance of the stars '
(scintillam stellaris essentiae) the stars being no doubt conceived as concentrations of aither.
( 1 1 \,' Waking, sleeping and death are related to the degree offieriness in the soul. In sleep the soul is partly cut offrom the world-fire, and so decreases

236 A man in the night kindles a light for himself when his vision is extinguished; living, he is in contact with the dead, when asleep, and with the sleeper, when awake.
237 According to Heraclitus we become intelligent by drawing in this divine reason
[logos] through breathing, and forgetful when asleep, but we regain our senses when we wake up again. For in sleep, when the channels of perception are shut, our mind is
sunderedfrom its kinship with the surrounding, and breathing is the only point of attachment to be preserved, like a kind of root; being sundered, our mind casts off itsformer power of memory. But in the waking state it again peeps out through the channels ofperception as though through a kind of window, and meeting with the surrounding it puts on its power of reason ....

The light kindled at night in 236 must be what a man sees in dreaming, when the actual darkness seems to be illuminated; we are also told that 'sleepers are workers' (fr. 75) and that 'what
we see when asleep is sleep' (fr. 21). Naturally this light is deceptive: see the last sentence of fr. i (197). It is an individual, private illumination which supplants the real illumination of the
Logos which is common to all (198), In sleep a man is 'in contact
with' death (there is a typical Heraclitean word-play in 236 between the two senses of cnrTeaQai, 'kindle' and 'touch'): his
soul-fire is burning low, is almost extinguished, and in most respects he resembles a dead man. Sleep, then, is a medial state between waking life and death. Sextus' information in 237 is obviously important, but must be
treated with caution: he naturally imposed Sceptic epistemo
logical interpretations upon Hcraclitus, for whom his sources were,
in addition, Stoic-influenced. Yet he goes on to make clearly
accurate quotations of the long fr. i and of fr. 2 (197 and 198). It is to be expected from 232 that the soul-fire has some kind of
physical affinity, and therefore connexion, with the cosmic fire outside. Sextus tells us that in the waking state the connexion is provided by a direct contact through the senses with the external
fire with the 'surrounding', in his own terminology, by which it may be inferred that the surrounding aithcr is meant; or rather the
Logos-element in things, which may be envisaged as a direct offshoot of the pure aitherial fire. Sight is presumably of particular importance among the senses, since it receives and absorbs the
fiery impressions of light. In sleep the only possible contact is provided by breathing ; it may be wondered whether this draws in
fire so much as moisture (though cf. n. 3 on p. 211), since 'souls come from water' (232) and should draw nourishment from moisture. According to Aetius iv, 3, 12, DK22AI5 (where there is some Stoic influence), souls are nourished by both external and internal exhalations : the internal exhalations, if they exist, would be from blood and other bodily liquids ; the external ones would
be those absorbed by breathing, and likewise moist. Unfortunately
the extant fragments are no help here. 1 It is possible that in sleep the moist nourishment of the soul-fire, no longer balanced by the direct fiery accretions received in waking through the senses, subdues the soul and brings it into a death-like state. It may be
noted that the intelligent condition consequent upon the appre

hension of the Logos (see fr. i, 197) would mean in psychological terms that the active, fiery part of the soul has made contact with
the fiery Logos-constituent of the objective situation, and has been increased by it.2
1 Sextus went on to compare the resuscitation of the soul-fire by restored
contact with the universal Logos (here expressed in Stoic-Sceptic terms)
with the way in which embers glow again when brought near to a live fire.
This image, already perhaps used by Xenophanes (p. 173), may well have
been re-used by Heraclitus. Conceivably the word dyxipoccrfrj, 'going near to', which Heraclitus used (fr. 122) according to the Suda, belonged to the same image.
2 Ghalcidius, probably after Posidonius, ascribed to Heraclitus a view quite different from Sextus', according to which the soul only has contact with the cosmic reason when free in sleep from the interruption of the
senses (in Tim. ch. 251, DK.22A2O). The 'cosmic reason* is Stoic, and the
rest is quite obviously (pace A. Delatte) Platonic; though cf. Pi. fr. 131 b.

The 'better portions' which are won in 238 must belong to the soul alone, since after death the body is 'more fit to be cast out
than dung' (fr. 96). Therefore not all souls can equally undergo the 'death' (232) of becoming water, that is, of ceasing to be soul, which is essentially fiery. 239 (whose first words are probably corrupt) seems to suggest that certain souls survive death and
become daimons; this is manifestly developed from a famous passage in Hesiod. 1 The key to Heraclitus' belief here is, I think,
provided by 240, which is clearly not a verbatim quotation but a verse summary of perhaps considerably later date than Heraclitus
himself (although we know from Diogenes Laertius ix, 16,

DK.22 A i, that Scythinus made a metrical version of Heraclitus in
the late fourth or third century B.C.). It probably owes something
to fr. 24, 'Gods and men honour those slain in battle', but the
comparison with those who die from illness is quite new, and is
unlikely to have been simply invented after Heraclitus. How can the souls of those dying in battle, it may be asked, be 'purer' than
the souls of those dying from disease? The answer I suggest is that
the latter are moistened and inefficient, and their possessors are in a semi-conscious and sleep-like condition; those slain in battle, on the contrary, are cut off at their most active, when their souls are fiery from virtuous and courageous activity.2 At the moment of death the enfeebled souls of the sick lose their last residue of
fieriness and become completely watery, so that they cease to exist as souls; while the souls of those slain in battle (almost
instantaneously, for the most part) are predominantly fiery. It seems plausible, then, that the latter avoid the soul-death of
becoming water.3 They leave the body and, we may guess, are re-united with the aitherial fire. Before this happens they probably remain for a time as disembodied daimons, after the Hesiodic pattern. But there can be no idea of individual survival apart from
this, or indeed of perpetual survival as aitherial fire : for measures
of that fire are constantly being drawn into the cosmological process, and undergo the changes of 221 (see n. on p. 202 for a possible soul-period of some kind). Thus Heraclitus does not appear to be indebted here to Pythagoras.

Another saying of Heraclitus preserved by Hippolytus is very obscure : it evidently has some connexion with the doctrine of opposites, but also suggests the

the heroic conception of battle) this loss might be more than made up by an increase of fire.
3 Fr. 98 describes souls as ' using smell in Hades '
: this, too, suggests that some souls, at least, exist after the death of the body. 'Hades' should not
be taken too literally. The point of this cryptic saying is perhaps that those souls which survive death are surrounded by dry matter (in other words,
fire) ; for it was a common view that the sense of smell operates on objects drier than the smelling organ (de carnibus 16; Aristotle de sensu 5, 444 a 2 2). It is possible, however, that the fragment is quite naive in implication: simply that soul is (according to one popular view) breath, that smell is inhaled with the breath, and therefore that smell is the sense used by the
soul when the other organs have perished with the body. If this is so the saying could be ironic, or an attack on the idea of the breath-soul.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Heraclitus followed Xenophanes in ridiculing the anthropomorphism and idolatry of the contemporary Olympian religion. Yet the last words of 244 (and also, e.g., 207 and 239) show that he did not reject the idea of divinity altogether, or even some con
ventional descriptions of it. 245 implies that mysteries would not be utterly worthless if they were correctly celebrated. 246 suggests
how this is so : such rituals can possess (and sometimes accidentally
do possess) a positive value, because they guide men indirectly to the apprehension of the Logos. The precise grounds on which Hades and Dionysus are here identified are not known, but pre
sumably the former represents death, the latter exuberant life ; and
it is the implied identification of these especially significant
opposites (cf. 205, 242) that prevents the cult from being utterly shameful. It may be observed that the participants themselves
could hardly be expected to see the significance of what they do, at least before Heraclitus revealed it or rather hinted at it : the
method adopted by Apollo in his Delphic pronouncements is praised in 247, because a sign may accord better than a mis
leadingly explicit statement with the nature of the underlying truth, that of the Logos (cf. 210-212). Probably Heraclitus intended by
this kind of parallel to justify his own oracular and obscure style. 1

to determine precisely how much of this is a verbatim quotation; H. Frankel, for example, thinks that only down to ar6|jom is. I would conjecture that
down to 90eyyouevr| (with the possible exception of Kod ccKaAAcbTnora Kal djaupioTa) is by Heraclitus, the rest is a very loose paraphrase by Plutarch.
The saying looks like a justification of the unadorned oracular method of
exegesis; but precise interpretation is impossible. Heraclitus himself certainly combined the terseness of the gnomic style with the obscurity of the related oracular style; his underlying meaning was sometimes rein
forced by the use of word-plays and etymological periphrases. A somewhat similar use is seen in Aeschylus, whose choral style, especially in the Oresteia, has some affinities with Heraclitus.

Heraclitus' ethical advice is gnomic in form, and for the most part similar in general content to that of his predecessors and con
temporaries; sometimes it is expressed more graphically and often more savagely. 1 It stresses the importance of moderation, which itself depends upon a correct assessment of one's capacities. But this
kind of advice (with which one naturally compares the Delphic
maxims 'Know thyself and 'Nothing too much') has a deeper significance in Heraclitus because of its grounding (not explicitly stated but clearly implied in 197 etc.) in his physical theories, and because of his belief that only by understanding the central pattern
of things can a man become wise and fully effective: see 197, 199, 230, 237. That is the real moral of Heraclitus' philosophy, in
which ethics is for the first time formally interwoven with physics.
1 Heraclitus was undoubtedly of a strongly critical temperament, and his
abuse can hardly have made him popular with his unfortunate fellowcitizens: cf. e.g. 254 Fr. 29, Clement Strom, v, 59, 5 atpeuvTOCi y&p ev OCVTl OCTTOCVTCOV ot OCptOTOI, KAOS OC6VOCOV 0VT|TCOV oi S TToAAol KEKOpriVTCCt 6KCO7Trep KTfjvea. His political ideas seem to have been anti-democratic,
though perhaps from empirical rather than ideological motives: * One man is as ten thousand for me, if he is best', he said (fr. 49), and abused the

law, the divine law; for it has as much power as it wishes and is sufficient for all and is still left over.

Ephesians for exiling his friend Hermodorus on the ground of his exceptional ability (fr. 121). Himself of noble birth, he refused his traditional
privileges (194).
Thus c
searching for oneself in 249 leads, it may be inferred, to the discovery that the soul ranges outside oneself (see 235, 237).
250 is a denial of the view, common in Homer, that the individual
often cannot be held responsible for what he does. Socijjicov here
means simply a man's personal destiny; this is determined by his
own character, over which he has some control, and not by
external and often capricious powers acting perhaps through a 'genius' allotted to each individual by chance or Fate. Helen
blamed Aphrodite for her own weakness; but for Heraclitus (as
indeed for Solon, who had already reacted against the moral
helplessness of the heroic mentality) there was a real point in intelligent and prudent behaviour. 251 has no special overtones :
it shows how conventional the practical side of Heraclitus' ethics often was, and also that he did not always think of human behaviour in terms of the fiery nature of the soul (for 0(3pis should involve a
moistening of the soul, not its conflagration). By contrast, the insistence on respect for law in 252, though again expressed in conventional terms, takes on a far deeper significance, and is given
a profound justification, in the light of 253 (which should be
compared with 197, 198 and 199). Human laws are nourished by the divine universal law; they accord with the Logos, the formulaic constituent of the cosmos. * Nourished' is mainly, but not
completely, metaphorical: the contact between human laws and
the Logos is indirect, though not without material basis, since good
laws are the product of wise men with fiery souls (233) who thereby
understood, as Heraclitus himself does, the proper relation of men with the world.
CONCLUSION
In spite of much obscurity and uncertainty of interpretation, it does appear that Heraclitus' thought possessed a comprehensive unity which (conceivably because of the lack of information about
Anaximander and Pythagoras) seems completely new. Practically all aspects of the world are explained systematically, in relation to a central discovery that natural changes of all kinds are
regular and balanced, and that the cause of this balance is fire,
the common constituent of things that was also termed their
214



HERAGLITUS
Logos. Human behaviour, as much as changes in the external
world, is governed by the same Logos: the soul is made of fire, part
of which (like part of the whole world-order) is extinguished. Understanding of the Logos, of the true constitution of things, is
necessary if our souls are not to be excessively moistened and rendered ineffective by private folly. Heraclitus' relation of the soul to the world was more credible than that of Pythagoras,
since it was more rational; it pointed a direction which was not, on the whole, followed until the atomists and, later, Aristotle; in
the intervals a new tendency, towards the rejection of Nature, flourished with the Eleatics, Socrates and Plato.
215



THE ITALIAN SCHOOLS
The second main stage in the history of Presocratic speculation consists of the two great Italian schools, the Pythagorean and the Eleatic. The original motive and character of Italian thought differ widely from those of the Milesians. Whereas the Milesians were impelled by innate intellectual curiosity and dissatisfaction with the old mytho
logical accounts to attempt a rational explanation of physical phenomena, the impulse underlying Pythagoreanism seems to have been a religious or emotional one.' Plato himself refers to Pythagoras (Republic 600 A-B, DKi4, 10) as 'presiding over a band of intimate disciples
who loved him for the inspiration of his society and handed down a way of life which to this day distinguishes the Pythagoreans from the rest of the world '. tSuch a eulogy would be scarcely appropriate to the Milesians. Again, while the Milesians sought a purely materialist explanation of the world, and Heraclitus represents an intermediate stage, the Pythagoreans, this time in the words of Aristotle (Metaphysics
A 8, 989 bag, 0X58322), * employ stranger principles and elements than the physicists, the reason being that they took them from nonsensible things
J .*The Pythagorean cosmology is concerned, at the outset at any rate, more with the form or structure of the world than with its mere matter. But, as Aristotle adds in the next breath, having chosen their appa
rently abstract principles,
' they still concern themselves wholly with nature; they generate the universe and watch what happens to its various parts and affections and activities ; and they use up their first principles and causes on these things, as if they agreed with the other physicists that Being is just so much as is sensible and is embraced within what they call the universe. And yet, as I said, they maintain
causes and first principles that are adequate to lead up to the higher kinds of reality that are indeed better fitted to them than to discussions about nature.' These sentences state very clearly what is probably the most important of all facts about the Italian schools. While the
Pythagoreans were only secondarily, and the Eleatics hardly at all, interested in the material aspect of the world, and while both groups therefore start from first principles which in these days would be called abstract, both groups of thinkers alike, thanks merely to the date at
which they lived, were so subject to the universal preconception that
'
Being is just so much as is sensible ' that they end in a corporealism hardly less total, if much more difficult to understand, than that of the Milesians. Many modern scholars find this conclusion so repugnant that they read into the Italian philosophers' theories philosophical distinctions of which all the evidence, including sometimes the actual words of the philosopher in question, seems to show that they were
unaware. In the opinion of the present writer, it is only on the supposition that the only form of existence recognized by the Presocratics was existence in space, and that consequently the distinction between
the corporeal and the incorporeal had not yet been clearly and explicitly drawn, that it is possible to understand what the early Italian philosophers meant.

PYTHAGORAS OF SAMOS
LIFE AND DATE
While the developments already described were taking place in Ionia, an independent movement, initiated by Pythagoras, was
gaining strength in southern Italy. Of the life of Pythagoras himself, though there are several late and unreliable works on the
subject, we can be said to know very little indeed. He passed his
early life in the island of Samos, 1 flourishing, according to Apollodorus, in 532/1 B.C., during the reign of the tyrant Poly
crates. He is said to have left Samos to escape from the tyranny2 and to have settled at Croton in southern Italy, where he appears
to have risen to a position of great authority.3 Eventually, however, the Crotoniates rose in revolt against him and he withdrew
to the neighbouring city of Metapontium, where he died.4 ^

255 According to my information from the Greeks who live beside the Hellespont and Pontus, this Salmoxis, a real man, was a slave in Samos to Pythagoras son of Mnesarchus . . .but I believe that this Salmoxis lived many years before Pythagoras.
256 Aristoxenus says that at the age offorty, seeing that the tyranny ofPolycrates had grown more intense, . . . he eventually emigrated to Italy.
257 . . .He emigrated to Croton in Italy and there, by legislating for the Italians, won renown together with his pupils. They numbered nearly 300, and they administered the affairs of state so well that the constitution was virtually an aristocracy.
258 For this reason Pythagoras departed to Metapontium9 where he is said to have died.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
OBSCURITY OF THE TRADITION
Both Plato and Aristotle are remarkably chary of mentioning
Pythagoras by name, 1 and neither tells us, in the extant works,
anything of the slightest value about him. Moreover, from the way in which they speak of later Pythagorean doctrine,2 it would appear that they are both alike sceptical about the historical
origins of Pythagoreanism. Probably the name of Pythagoras was already, as it certainly was later, enveloped in a mist of
legend. 3
1 Plato mentions him once only, at Rep. 600 A-B, Aristotle in his extant
works (but cf. note 2 below) only twice, at Met. A 5, 986 a 30 (where, how
ever, the name of Pythagoras is probably only a later addition : cf. Ross, note ad loc.) and Rhet. 623, 1398^4. 2 Plato uses the word rTv6ccy6peios with equal reserve: it occurs only at
Rep. 530 D. Elsewhere he cites what we know to be Pythagorean doctrine anonymously. Aristotle, though he is not so shy of the word TTv0ocy6peio$, frequently prefers to describe the Pythagoreans as either ol 'iTaAiKof, ol irepl 'iTocMocv or (as at Met. 985 b 23, 989 b 29 etc.) ol KocAouuevoi T"Iv6ocy6peiot. Aristotle, however, was sufficiently interested in Pythagoreanism to write a treatise, which is unfortunately lost, entitled Hepl TCOV TTvOocyopefcov.
3 Certainly the surviving fragments of Aristotle's lost work on the Pythagoreans already incorporate several miraculous tales; cf. also 259 Apollonius Hist.

1 The authenticity of this fragment has been long doubted, and it was regarded by Diels (though not by Kranz) as spurious; but since the case against it rests on a misunderstanding of the word SKAe^ccnevos, which was taken to imply that Pythagoras wrote rather than read books, there is no good reason why it should not be substantially genuine.
bespite the silence of Plato and Aristotle these fifth-century passages, to which should be added also 268 and 269, amply
suffice to prove that Pythagoras was in fact a historical, not merely
a legendary, figure. The difficulty lies in establishing anything more than his bare existence; but we shall find that on the basis of
what little contemporary or early evidence survives it is possible to reconstruct at least the rough outlines of his system, v
THE EARLY PYTHAGOREAN COMMUNITY
Little as we know of Pythagoras himself, of his immediate followers we know even less. There can be no doubt that Pythagoras founded in Croton a sort of religious fraternity or order; 1 but there
and, making a selection of these writings, claimed for his own a wisdom which was really dilettantism and malpractice.
262 . . . This Salmoxis . . . who had associated with the Greeks, and especially with Pythagoras, who was not the weakest sage among the Greeks ....
263 Empedocles too bears witness to this, writing of him: 'And there was among them
a man of rare knowledge, most skilled in all manner of wise works, a man who had won the utmost wealth of wisdom; for whensoever he strained with all his mind, he easily saw
everything of all the things that are, in ten, yea, twenty lifetimes of men. 1 (Empedocles trans. Burnet)

is no good evidence for the widely held view that it was modelled
on Orphic cult-societies. It is true that Orphic and Pythagorean
doctrines and practices are often compared, -as they are first in the
following passage :

Even such a relatively early passage cannot, however, be safely taken as evidence for the existence of the Orphics (or of the
Pythagoreans) before, say, the middle of the fifth century B.C., and it throws no light on the question which of the two communities, if
either, was indebted to the other. Of Pythagoras' earliest adherents very few are even known to us by name a state of affairs which seems to have come about from two main reasons. In the first
place, there was apparently a rule of secrecy in the community,2 by which the offence of divulging Pythagorean doctrine to the uninitiated is said by later authorities to have been severely
punished with the result that there were evidently no Pytha
gorean writings before, at earliest, the time of Philolaus3 (i.e. the
end of the fifth century B.C.). And second, even within the school
itself, such was the respect paid to its founder that later discoveries made by members of the fraternity seem not to have been claimed as individual achievements but rather attributed indis
criminately to Pythagoras himself4 with the result that much
that can hardly have been the work of Pythagoras, especially in the mathematical field, must remain anonymous. The most, there
fore, that can be even attempted in the case of the Pythagoreans is to divide their doctrine into three sections, two of which cover the period from the founder to Parmenides, while the third is concerned
with the generation of Pythagoreans which flourished, under the
leadership of Philolaus, at the end of the fifth century.?, j
264 But woollen articles are never taken into temples, nor are they buried with them; that is not lawful. They agree in this with the so-called Orphic and Bacchic practices,
which are really Egyptian, and with the Pythagorean; for it is not lawful for one who partakes in these rites to be buried in woollen clothes. There is a sacred account given
on this subject.

1 We hear much of the rules of the society in late and (except when
quoting from a reputable source) unreliable authors (cf. e.g. Diog. L. vm, 10; Iambi. V.P. 81), but such evidence should be treated with reserve. It will, however, become clear from what follows that the society must have
been, in part at least, a religious fraternity.

(See 271 for continuation.) This passage derives from Dicaearchus of Messene, a pupil of Aristotle. There seem to have been two motives for silence: first (see Iambi. V.P. 94), to insure that initiates could
'hold their peace' (e^sni/deiv) ; and second (see Diog. L. vui, 15), to discourage 'the utterance of all things to all men'. Diogenes is here quoting Aristoxenus of Tarentum, another pupil of Aristotle, of whose book on Pythagoreanism relatively substantial fragments are preserved by later writers, especially lamblichus.

5 Iambi. V.P. 267 (DK.58A) gives us, it is true, a long list of the names of
Pythagoreans, some few of whom are probably early ; but the failure to distinguish between different generations of the school, illustrated by the
inclusion in the same list of, for instance, Alcmaeon (see p. 232) and Plato's contemporary, Archytas, renders it almost worthless.
265 After this his fame grew great, and he won many followers from the city itself (not only men but women also, one of whom, Theano, became very well known too) and many princes and chieftains from the barbarian territory around. What he said to his associates,
nobody can say for certain; for silence with them was of no ordinary kind.
266 The strictness of their secrecy is astonishing; for in so many generations evidently nobody ever encountered any Pythagorean notes before tiie time of Philolaus; he first published those three notorious books, which Dion of Syracuse is said to have bought, at Plato 9s request, for 100 minae
267 Pythagoras wrote nothing, nor did Socrates nor Arcesilaus nor Carneades.

268 On the subject of reincarnation Xenophanes bears witness in an elegy which begins: 'Now I will turn to another tale and show the way.' What he says about Pythagoras runs thus: ' Once they say that he was passing by when a puppy was being whipped, and he took pity and said: "Stop, do not beat it; for it is the soul of a friend that I recognized when
I heard it giving tongue."
'
269 Ion of Chios says about him (Pherecydes) : * Thus did he excel in manhood and honour, and now that he is dead he has a delightful existence for his soul if indeed Pythagoras the wise learned and knew true opinions above all men. 9
270 Moreover, the Egyptians are the first to have maintained the doctrine that the soul of man is immortal, and that, when the body perishes, it enters into another animal that is being born at the time, and when it has been the complete round of the creatures of the dry land and of the sea and of the air it enters again into the body of a man at birth; and its
cycle is completed in 3000 years. There are some Greeks who have adopted this doctrine, some informer times, and some in later, as if it were their own invention; their names I know but refrain from writing down.
222



PYTHAGORAS
Herodotus' refusal to mention names in 270 has been taken to indicate that he is speaking not of Pythagoras himself but of
contemporaries of his own; Stein suggested Empedocles, but it
seems more plausible to suppose that it was people in Athens whom Herodotus preferred not to name. It is, however, likely that the
phrase ot \ikv TrpoTepov,
* some in former times ', was intended to embrace both Pythagoras and certain others who were already known as Orphics (cf. 264) . That Pythagoras himself did indeed believe
in the transmigration of souls is anyhow pretty conclusively proved
by 268. He is even said by Diogenes Laertius (vm, 4-5, DK 14, 8)
to have claimed to remember his own four previous incarnations.
(2) Kinship of all living things
The fragment of Xenophanes (268) shows that souls could be reincarnated in the form of other living things than man, and this
in turn suggests the kinship of all living things. 265, where Porphyry is drawing on Aristotle's follower Dicaearchus, continues as follows:
271 Porphyrius, Vita Pythagorae 19 (DKi4, 8 a) n&Aioroc JJIVTOI

1 It was presumably in connexion with the cycle of reincarnation that the Pythagoreans held the remaining doctrine here attributed to them, that of
the periodic recurrence of events. The most reliable statement of this belief
is in the following fragment of Eudemus: 272 Eudemus ap. Simplic. Phys.
732, 30 (DK.58B34) et 5 TI$ Tnoreuo-eie TOIS ITuOccyopefois, wore irdAiv T& CCUTOC ocpiOnco, xdycb uu6oAoyic

271 None the less the following became universally known: first, that he maintains that
the soul is immortal; next, that it changes into other kinds of living things; also that events recur in certain cycles, and that nothing is ever absolutely new; andfinally, that all living things should be regarded as akin. Pythagoras seems to have been the first to bring these beliefs into Greece.
272 If one were to believe the Pythagoreans, that events recur in an arithmetical cycle,
and that I shall be talking to you again sitting as you are now, with this pointer in my hand, and that everything else will be just as it is now, then it is plausible to suppose that the time too will be the same time as now.
223



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
elvoct. A passage in the Theologumena Arithmeticae (p. 52, 8 de Falco ; DK 1 4, 8) tells us that certain later Pythagoreans, working on the basis of the intervals
between Pythagoras' own earlier incarnations, believed that the human soul was reincarnated every 216 years the precise number 216 being characteristically chosen as the cube of 6. Though such embellishments of the doctrine are doubtless late, it is not impossible that Pythagoras himself did indeed hold the belief, later adopted by the Stoics, in the periodic cycle; but it is at least as likely that the later Pythagoreans borrowed it from Empedocles (see pp. 326 f.).
Unfortunately, despite the definite suggestion in the last sentence that Pythagoras had learnt these doctrines abroad, the question of
their origin is hopelessly shrouded in legend. He is said by different late writers to have visited, and to have learnt from,
peoples as various as the Chaldaeans, the Indian Brahmins, the Jews and even the Druids and the Celts; but all that such traditions tell us is that certain similarities were later detected between the teaching of Pythagoras and the beliefs held in countries other than Greece. Even Herodotus' suggestion in 270 that the doctrine of
transmigration came from Egypt is demonstrably false the Egyptians never held such a doctrine; and none of the other guesses about its origin are as well attested as that.
Nor are the details of the two closely related doctrines, the
transmigration of souls and the kinship of all living things, at all easy to fill in. Empedocles' version, as his fr. 117 (476) proves, included at least some plants among living things, and presumably for that reason involved abstention from laurel leaves (fr. 140) and beans (fr. 141). Since, as we shall see in the next section, similar rules of abstinence are attributed to Pythagoras, it may well be that he too thought it was possible to be reincarnated as a
plant; but such relatively reliable and explicit evidence as exists,
most of which has already been cited, proves only that a human soul can sink as low in the scale of living things as a dog (268). It is possible, but no more than that, that in a world which he
regarded as dualistic (see pp. 240 if.) Pythagoras believed that
VJA/XT), 'life 9
, was somehow a unity, a single mass, a part of which was scattered in an impure form throughout the world, while another part, into which the individual soul would be reabsorbed
after its final incarnation, retained its purity. Such a doctrine,
however, even if it was held, seems to have had little effect on the
cosmological side of Pythagoreanism (see pp. 250 ff.), in which the place of the immortal soul is by no means clear.
224



PYTHAGORAS
(3) Rules of abstinence and other prohibitions
Arising in part from his belief in the kinship of all living things, but with a clear admixture of other motives and influences, various forms of abstinence are attributed by later writers to Pythagoras.
Two typical passages, chosen from many others like them, are :
273 Porphyrius Vita Pythagorae 7 (DKi4, 9) . . .jar} novov TGOV
dAAd Kal pccydpois xocl OrjpdTopai
274 Diogenes Laertius vm, 19 TTCCVTOS 8 pioAAov dcTtriyopeue

dpvdaiv.
It would appear from 273 that the primary motive (but not, as some of the instances in 274 show, the only one) for the Pythagorean
rules and prohibitions was the belief in the kinship of all living things: butchers and huntsmen arc presumably alike defiled by
the murder of their own kin. Unfortunately, as 274 again serves to show, there is great inconsistency between the various authorities about the details of the Pythagorean rules of abstinence. 1 The
fuller accounts are clearly unreliable, and perhaps all that can be safely concluded from them is that certain rules of abstinence arising from the belief in kinship were an early feature of the
Pythagorean way of life.
u x The conflicting nature of the evidence is in part due to Aristoxenus, who, being a friend of the Pythagoreans of his day and anxious to justify their
neglect of the religious side of Pythagoras' teaching, was intent on eliminating, or at least rationalizing, all such rules. But that some at least of these rules are of a certain age is proved by Herodotus' mention in 264 of the ban on burying the dead in woollen shrouds. ^
273 . . .not only to abstain from living things, but also never to approach butchers and huntsmen.
274 Above all else he forbade the eating of red mullet and black-tail; and he enjoined abstinencefrom the heart andfrom beans; also, according to Aristotle, on certain occasions, from the womb and from mullet. . . . He sacrificed only inanimate things; but others say that he used only cocks and sucking kids and piglings, as they are called, and never lambs.
15 225



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Besides the rules that can be explained in this way there are also,
however, in the various lists handed down to us, others of at least
four different types." A few, such as c be not possessed of irrepressible mirth ' or * disbelieve nothing strange about the gods or about
religious beliefs', would seem to be nothing more than common
ethical or religious reflexions.' A larger group, some of which have
already appeared in 274, are probably descended from primitive folk-taboo. Others again, such as * sacrifice and worship without
shoes on' or 'cut not your finger-nails at a sacrifice', clearly con
cern ritual purity. And finally some, such as * when you rise from bed, roll the bed-clothes together and smoothe out the place where
you lay', seem to owe their origin to sympathetic magic. 1

\ After the death of Pythagoras, his school apparently split into two sects, one of which, the so-called 'Acousmatics 5 or 'Pytha
gorists', preserved the mystical side of his teaching, while the other, the 'Mathematicians', concentrated on the scientific side. 1 There is no telling how many of the Pythagorean rules and
prohibitions dcKoOcrnaTa or ovjji|3oAoc, as they were called actually go back to the founder himself, but certainly many of them look like primitive survivals. |

276 The form of his instruction was twofold: one group of hisfollowers were called the Mathematicians, the other the Acousmatics. The Mathematicians were those who had learnt the more detailed and exactly elaborated version of his knowledge, the Acousmatics those who
had heard only the summary headings of his writings, without the more exact exposition.

far cited, of another side to Pythagoras' teaching are Heraclitus'
references, in 260 and 261, to his TroAuiaccdir) and ioropir| ('polymathy' and Scientific enquiry
5
), and Herodotus' description of him in 262 as 'by no means the weakest sage among the Hellenes'.
These passages alone, however, do suggest-V-what is evident also from the fact that in the fifth century the Pythagoreans were among the leading scientists that Pythagoras was interested in science as
well as in the fate of the soul, j Clearly too religion and science were,
to Pythagoras, not two separate departments between which there was no contact, but rather the two inseparable factors in a single way of life. 1 Unfortunately there is no reliable evidence whatever
concerning the nature of Pythagoras' scientific teaching: any reconstruction must be conjectural, merely attributing to Pythagoras himself such of the later Pythagorean doctrines as could without anachronism have been held in the sixth century B.C. and
may plausibly account for the subsequent spread and development of Pythagoreanism.jThe central notions, which held together the two strands that were later to fall apart, seem to have been those
of Gecopfoc (contemplation),* KOCJIJIOS (an orderliness found in the
arrangement of the universe) 3 and xaOapais (purification).4 By contemplating the principle of order revealed in the universe and especially in the regular movements of the heavenly bodies
and by assimilating himself to that orderliness, man himself was

278 Life, he said, is like a festival; just as some come to the festival to compete, some to ply their trade, but the best people come as spectators, so in life the slavish men go hunting for fame or gain, the philosophers for the truth.

PYTHAGORAS
'Pythagoras is said by Aetius, in a much debated passage (n, i, i ; DK 14, 21), to have been the first to use the word K6apo$ of the universe; but if the passage has any foundation in fact, it is most likely that Pythagoras used
the word, not, as Aetius said, to mean f) TCOV oAcov Trepiox^,
* that which embraces all things', but with a special emphasis on the element of orderliness, or the arrangement: cf. p. 159 n. Pythagoras is also said by
Diog. L. (i, 12), who is here quoting Heraclides, to have coined the word 'philosophy'; cf. Kirk, Heraclitus, the Cosmic Fragments, 395.

SCIENTIFIC ACHIEVEMENTS
The two most fundamental and universal of Pythagorean scientific doctrines are, first, the ultimate dualism between Limit and
Unlimited, and second, the equation of things with numbers^ (ec
pp. 240-50) . What is required, therefore, is a plausible explanation of how these two doctrines, by no means obviously interdependent, should have occurred to Pythagoras or his followers. There seems no reason to doubt the tradition that Pythagoras himself dis
covered probably by measuring the appropriate lengths of string on a monochord that the chief musical intervals are expressible in simple numerical ratios between the first four integers. 1 This single discovery would account naturally for all the most characteristic of Pythagorean doctrines. If the musical scale depends
simply upon the imposition of definite proportions on the indefinite continuum of sound between high and low, might not the same principles, Limit and the Unlimited, underlie the whole universe?
If numbers alone are sufficient to explain the 'consonances',
might not everything else be likewise expressible as a number or a
proportion? Moreover, since the first four integers contain the whole secret of the musical scale, their sum, the number 10 or the Decad, might well 'seem to embrace 3
, as Aristotle puts it, 'the whole nature of number' (see 289) and so come to be regarded, as
it certainly was, with veneration. 2 |It is not surprising, therefore, that both mathematics and music should have played from the
outset so vital a part in Pythagoreanism^ Of the various mathe
matical discoveries attributed to Pythagoras it is not unlikely that
279 The Pythagoreans, according to Aristoxenus, practised the purification of the body by medicine, that of the soul by music.
229



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
some notably, the theorem that still bears his name, and its
corollary, the incommensurability of the diagonal and the side of
a square3 are genuinely his. It is also a remote possibility, in view of his interest in the musical scale, that he himself invented the well-known doctrine of the ' Harmony of the Spheres^ (see
330). Some authorities maintained that he first discovered that the morning and the evening star are one and the same, while others attributed the discovery to Parmenides t
' There is, un
fortunately, no means of assessing the relative strength of the two
claims though it might perhaps be thought that Pythagoras' interests would have inclined him more towards astronomy than would those of Parmenides. All such details, however, rest on no reliable evidence; all that can be said with confidence of the scientific achievements of Pythagoras himself is that they must
have been sufficient to give the original impetus to the Pythagorcanism of the fifth century which Aristotle describes. ;
1 Octave=2: i, fifth 3:2, fourth=4:3. An elaborate story that Pytha
goras made his discovery by noticing that the hammers in a smithy
happened to produce these intervals and therefore weighing the hammers is found in several late authors (e.g. Iambi. V.P. i i$ff., Bocthius de mus. i, i o) ; but it is proved to be unreliable by the fact that Pythagoras' alleged experiments could not have yielded the results attributed to them.
z The number 10 was represented by ten dots or alphas arranged in an equilateral triangle so:
This diagram, which shows at a glance that 10=1+2 + 3 + 4, was known to the Pythagoreans as the Tetractys of the Dccad, and by it they swore their most binding oaths. So 280 Aetius i, 3, 8 (DK-58BI5) elvoci Sfc

280 Ten is the very nature of number. All Greeks and all barbarians alike count up to
ten, and having reached ten revert again to the unit. And again, Pythagoras maintains, the power of the number ten lies in the numberfour, the tetrad. This is the reason: if one starts at the unit and adds the successive numbers up to four, one will make up the number ten; and if one exceeds the tetrad, one will exceed ten too. If, that is, one takes the unit, adds

CHAPTER VIII
ALCMAEON OF CROTON
DATE AND RELEVANCE
Of the generation of Pythagoreans contemporary with or imme
diately following Pythagoras very few are even known to us by name, and, with the possible exception of Hippasus (cf. p. 231 n. 3), nothing of importance is known about any of them. The only Italian thinker between Pythagoras and Parmcnidcs of whose opinions there is sufficient evidence to justify his inclusion in this
book is Alcmaeon of Croton, who flourished, probably, early in the fifth century B.C. 1
282 Diogenes Laertius vm, 83 (DK.24AI) 'AAxnocicov KpoTcovi&TT|$. Keel o\Sro$ TTuOayopou SirjKoucre. xocl TOC irAeiOTCc ye [TOC]

This brief passage contains several important pieces of information.
The statement that he c heard Pythagoras' doubtless means, as it usually does, no more than that he was in some sort of contact
with the Pythagorean school.2 The following sentence, on the other hand, is certainly accurate; but, though Alcmaeon' s interests were primarily medical and physiological,3 his theories even in these specialized fields exercised a considerable influence on later
philosophers. The alleged quotation, whether or not it preserves Alcmaeon's own words, certainly preserves one of the most
important of his views, his dualism. And finally, though the suggestion that he was the first to do so is of doubtful value (cf., e.g., 45, 98), he does indeed seem to have written a book on natural
science, of which a few possibly genuine fragments survive.4
1 The evidence on which this dating relies is 283 Aristotle Met. AS,

282 Alcmaeon ofCroton: another pupil of Pythagoras. For the most part his theories are medical9 but sometimes he treats of natural philosophy too, maintaining that 'the majority
of human affairs are in pairs
9
. He seems to have been the first to write an account of nature.
283 Diels' text means: Alcmaeon was a young man in Pythagoras
9 old age. . ..
232



ALGMAEON
The text, however, is obviously corrupt. While Diels inserts veos before ETT{,
Ross regards the words eyveTo T^V fjAtKiav and TT! yepovTt TTv0ay6pa, which are omitted by one ms. and ignored by Alexander, as a later addition (see his note ad loc.}. It is true that lamblichus V.P. 104 lists
Alcmaeon among ' the contemporaries of Pythagoras, his young pupils in his old age '
; but since the same list contains also the names of Philolaus, Archytas and Leucippus, it clearly has no value as evidence. All that can safely be said, therefore, is that there is no reason why this dating, whether
it represents Aristotle's own opinion or that of an interpolator, should not be approximately correct. 2 Aristotle mentions Alcmaeon by name on several occasions, but, though in 289 he guesses either that Alcmaeon borrowed from the Pythagoreans
or they from him, he never suggests that Alcmaeon himself was a member of the school. Later writers arc, as usual, less cautious.
3 Alcmaeon's physiological research was directed chiefly towards deter
mining the nature of sense-perception. His theories are summed up by Theophrastus in a passage of which the most important sentences are the
following: 284 Theophr. de sensu 25 f. (DK.24A5) TCOV 8 ufj TOO 6noicp

is the seat of sensations was taken over from Alcmaeon in the Hippocratic treatise de morbo sacro, 14 and 17 (DK.24AH). The existence of the ir6poi is said by Chalcidius (in Tim. ch. 237, DK.24A 10) to have been proved by Alcmaeon's dissection of the eye. 4 The book is said by Diog. L. (with only one brief sentence between 282 and this passage) to have begun as follows: 285 Diog. L. vm, 83 'AAKuai'cov KpOTCovii'iTris TaSe lAe^e TTetpiOou ulos BpOTfvcp Kal AEOVTI Kal BaGvAAco* irepl TCOV a9avecov, irepl TCOV OV-TITCOV aa9r

other ancient sources call him) was evidently connected with Pythagoras by some marriage tie is one of the indications that Alcmaeon was in close
contact with the Pythagorean school. Leon and Bathylaus (not Bathyllus) are to be found in the list of Pythagoreans in Iambi. V.P. 267
284 Of those who think perception is of unlike by unlike Alcmaeon first defined the difference between man and animals. For man, he says, differs from other animals in that
t he only understands, while the rest perceive but do not understand', thought and perception being different, not, as Empedocles maintains, the same. Thereafter he discusses each of the senses severally. . ..Collectively he maintains that the senses are somehow connected with
the brain; and so they are incapacitated when it moves or changes its position; for it stops the passages through which sensations come.
285 Alcmaeon ofCroton, son of Peirithous, spoke these words to Brotinus and Leon and Bathyllus. Concerning things unseen and things mortal the gods see clearly, but so far as men may conjecture ....

PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
ALCMAEON'S INFLUENCE ON HIS SUCCESSORS
(i) His theory of health
Alcmaeon, like the Pythagoreans, was a dualist; but whereas the Pythagoreans recognized certain particular pairs of opposites as
ultimate (notably Limit and Unlimited, Odd and Even; see 289, p. 238), Alcmaeon, presumably owing to his medical approach to cosmology, seems merely to have asserted that contrariety was fundamental without specifying any ultimate pair or pairs. His
most influential doctrine, his theory of health, illustrates his dualism, and is summarized by Aetius as follows :

This doctrine, though here restricted to the medical field, may
perhaps have suggested the theory put forward by Simmias in Plato's Phaedo (85 -860) that the soul is merely an 'attunement'
of the physical opposites that compose the body; and since Plato is there probably citing a Pythagorean view, it seems quite likely that at this point at least Alcmaeon exercised an influence on the
Pythagoreans (see pp. 26 if.). 1
1 Once again, despite the general similarity between Alcmaeon's views and those of the Pythagoreans, the laovopfoc theory involves a significant difference of detail from the Pythagorean doctrine of dpnovfrj. G. Vlastos
286 Alcmaeon maintains that the bond of health is the 'equal balance 9 of the powers, moist and dry, cold and hot, bitter and sweet, and the rest, while the 'supremacy* of one of them is the cause of disease; for the supremacy of either is destructive. Illness comes about
directly through excess of heat or cold, indirectly through surfeit or deficiency of nourishment; and its centre is either the blood or the marrow or the brain. It sometimes arises in these centres from external causes, moisture of some sort or environment or exhaustion or hardship or similar causes. Health on the other hand is the proportionate admixture of the
qualities.
234



ALGMAEON
(Gnomon 25 (1953) 33-4) writes: * It is well known that the general norm of Kpaais in Greek cosmology and medicine was laovopia (Alcmacon B 4) or loro|jioipfot (irepl <5cpcov 12), i.e. the i/i ratio____ Over against this widespread view, the Pythagorean discovery of the formulae for musical
harmony introduced an entirely new idea, for it depicted patterns of good Kpaciis which did not conform to taovonioc but involved pairs of unequal (and, in each case, odd-even) numbers: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4.' See p. 230 n. i.

These two passages, despite their apparent dissimilarity, have been thought to refer to the same doctrine. The heavenly bodies have the property of continuous motion in a circle, and the soul, too, according to 287, is endowed with continuous motion; but whereas
the movement of the heavenly bodies is circular, 'man', according to 288, c is unable to join the beginning to the end' in other words the soul's motion cannot long remain circular and so dies. This
curious doctrine recalls fr. 103 of Heraclitus, 'on a circle beginning and end are the same'; but its details are obscure and there is no reliable evidence to enable us to reconstruct them. Here again, however, it seems possible that Alcmaeon exercised an influence on Plato, since the doctrine in the Timaeus of circles revolving in the soul seems to bear some relation to the theory of Alcmaeon and may perhaps have been borrowed directly from him.
287 Alcmaeon also seems to have held much the same view about the soul as these others;
for he says that it is immortal owing to its similarity to the immortal; and it has this quality because it is always in motion; for everything divine is in continual motion the sun, the moon, the stars and the whole heavens.
288 Alcmaeon says that men die for this reason, that they cannot join the beginning to the end.
235



CHAPTER IX
PRE-PARMENIDEAN PYTHAGOREANISM
THE PROBLEM OF DATING
In his numerous references to Pythagorcanism Aristotle very
seldom either names individual Pythagoreans or distinguishes
between different generations of the school. However much Pythagorean doctrine may have evolved during the fifth and early fourth centuries, Aristotle is content to summarize the main features of the system as a whole ; and since there is no ancient
authority of comparable weight with Aristotle, very various views have been taken of the development of the Pythagorean cosmo
logy. 1 The most that we can hope to achieve is to divide the
Pythagoreanism of the fifth century into two main periods, one before Parmenides, the other after Zcno; and since the primary
means by which even so much may be achieved consists in considering which Pythagorean doctrines seem to be attacked by Parmenides and which look like a reply to either Parmenides or
Zeno, any such reconstruction must of necessity be hazardously
conjectural. None the less the attempt seems worth the making, for otherwise the only possible course is to follow Aristotle and
group all the Pythagorean doctrines of more than a century of development into one indiscriminate amalgam.
1 For three widely different reconstructions of 5th-ceiitury Pythagoreanism
see (i) Burnet, EGP; (ii) F. M. Gornford, CQ,xvr and xvn (1922 and 1923), and introductory chapters of Plato and Parmenides ; (iii) J. E. Raven, Pythagoreans and Eleatics.

and having been brought up in it they thought its principles were tlie principles of all things. Since of these principles numbers are by nature the first, and in numbers they seemed to see many resemblances to the things that exist and come into being more than in fire and earth and water (such and such a modification of numbers being justice, another being soul and reason, another being opportunity and similarly almost all other things being numerically expressible); since, again, they saw that the attributes and the ratios of the musical scales were expressible in numbers; since, then, all other things seemed in their whole nature to be modelled after numbers, and numbers seemed to be the first things in the whole of nature, they supposed the elements of numbers to be the elements of all things, and the whole heaven to be a musical scale and a number. And all the properties of numbers and scales which they could show to agree with the attributes and parts and the whole arrangement of the
heavens, they collected and fitted into their scheme; and if there was a gap anywhere, they readily made additions so as to make their whole theory coherent. E.g. as the number 10
is thought to be perfect and to comprise the whole nature of numbers, they say that the bodies which move through the heavens are ten, but as the visible bodies are only nine, to meet this they invent a tenth the ''counter-earth''. We have discussed these matters more
exactly elsewhere. . . . Evidently, then, these thinkers also consider that number is the principle both as matter
for things and as forming their modifications and their permanent states, and hold that the elements of number are the even and the odd, and of these the former is unlimited, and the

latter limited; and the i proceeds from both of these (for it is both even and odd)) and number from the i; and the whole heaven, as has been said, is numbers. Other members of this same school say there are ten principles, which they arrange in two
columns of cognates limit and unlimited, odd and even, one and plurality, right and left,
male and female, resting and moving, straight and curved, light and darkness, good and bad, square and oblong. In this way Alcmaeon of Croton seems also to have conceived the
matter, and either he got this view from them or they got it from him; . . .for he expressed himself similarly to them. For he says most human affairs go in pairs, meaning not definite contrarieties such as the Pythagoreans speak of, but any chance contrarieties, e.g. white and black, sweet and bitter, good and bad, great and small. He threw out indefinite suggestions about the other contrarieties, but the Pythagoreans declared both how many and which their contrarieties are. From both these schools, then, we can learn this much, that the contraries are the
principles of things; and how many these principles are and which they are, we can learn from one of the two schools. But how these principles can be brought together under the

This long passage, though it is one of the few in which Aristotle recognizes (in the words eTepoi 6e TCOV OCUTGOV TOUTCOV, 'others of these same thinkers') distinctions within the school, is evidently intended as a summary of the main features of Pythagoreanism as a whole. 1 It accordingly refers in passing to most of the doctrines which Aristotle elsewhere examines in greater detail. At the same
time it is by itself far from self-explanatory: almost every sentence
in it needs corroboration, amplification or elucidation. The most convenient course will be to take this passage as a text for the whole
of this chapter, expanding in turn each of the most important sentences in their logical order rather than in the order in which
Aristotle presents them. Since Pythagoreanism is evidently based on an ultimate dualism, it will be best to start from the two first
principles (which are first not only in the list but also, as the
previous paragraph shows, in cosmology), Limit and Unlimited
and Odd and Even. Next, since the unit is derived from these two principles, we must examine the nature of the Pythagorean units and of number in general. That will enable us to see what the
Pythagoreans meant by the equation of things with numbers.
Finally we can attempt to reconstruct the cosmogony of these early Pythagoreans, against which the criticisms of the Eleatics seem to have been primarily directed.
1 The opening words of the passage, iv 5 ToO-rois Keel irpo TO\!)TCOV, show that Aristotle has in mind, at least among others, the generation of Pythagoreans which flourished at the end of the fifth century B.C. and of which Philolaus was the most prominent member. When, however, he

passes in the following paragraph to 'others of this same school', his
suggestion that either Alcmaeon borrowed from them or they from him seems to indicate that he is passing from a later to an earlier generation. But since the entire passage is clearly intended as a summary of the salient
features of Pythagoreanism as a whole, no reliance can safely be placed upon this unusual distinction.

These passages make it plain that in Aristotle's opinion not only was Pythagoreanism fundamentally dualistic1 but also the Table of Opposites, attributed in 289 to only one section or generation
of the school, was a characteristic feature of that dualism.2 What
that Table in fact represents is, as Cornford says (Plato and Parmenides 7), 'ten different manifestations of the two primary
290 From both these schools, then, we can learn this much, that the contraries are the
principles of things; and how many these principles are and which they are, we can learn from one of the two schools.
291 But the Pythagoreans have said in the same way that there are two principles, but
added this much, which is peculiar to them, that they thought Jinitude and infinity [and unity] were not attributes of certain other things, e.g. offire or earth or anything else of this
kind, but that infinity itself and unity itself were the substance of the things of which they are predicated. This is why number was the substance of all things. (Trans. Ross)
292 The Pythagoreans seem to have a more plausible view on the subject, when they put the One in the column of goods.
293 For evil belongs to the unlimited, as the Pythagoreans conjectured, and good to the limited.

PRE-PARMENIDEAN PYTHAGORE ANISM
opposites in various spheres; in each pair there is a good and an
answering evil'. The principle of Limit, in other words, is represented in the appropriate sphere by oddness, unity, rest, goodness and so on, while the principle of the Unlimited is represented by
their opposites. Moreover, as is clear from the phrases CCUTO TO iv,
'unity itself, in 291, and ev TTJ TCOV ocyaOcov avoroixtqc, 'in the column of goods', in 292, unity and goodness at least and the same is presumably true of the rest are not only 'manifestations'
of Limit but rather, each within its appropriate field, actually synonymous with Limit : in arithmetic Unity, in ethics Good take upon themselves the function of the primary principle.3
1 This is denied by Cornford (op. cit.) 9 who, on the basis of two very unreliable passages (Alexander Polyhistor ap. Diog. L. vm, 24 (DK58Bia),
on which sec Festugiere, Rev. des fit. Grecques 58 (1945) i ff., and Eudorus
ap. Simpl. Phys. 181, 10, on which see Raven, Pyth. and EL 15), argues against Aristotle that Pythagoreanism was fundamentally monistic. There can, however, be no doubt that on this question in particular Aristotle is
by far our most reliable authority. Moreover, if we elect to follow him, we can immediately see the motive for the tradition preserved in 294
Hippolytus Ref. i, 2, 12 Ai68copo$ 8 6 'EpeTpieC/s Keel 'Apioro^evos 6 uouam6s 900-1 irp6s ZapcVrav TOV XccA8aiov Ar|Au0evoci FfuOayopav. Zoroastrianism, like Pythagoreanism, was based upon a dualism between a good principle, Ormazd, and a bad, Ahriman; and all that this tradition proves is that already in the 4th century B.C. the similarity between the two systems had been observed.
2 It has been maintained, by Zeller and others (see Ross, Ar. Met. note
ad loc.), that the Table of Opposites belongs to the time of Philolaus. We
shall see, however, when we come to Parmenides, that Aristotle's implication that it belongs rather to the time of Alcmaeon is probably reliable.

In these sentences Aristotle first tells us that the Pythagoreans
were led to adopt their primary principles by their study of * mathematics', and then suggests, by the stress he lays on 'the elements of number', that he is thinking only of arithmetic. There is, however, no doubt that from the outset the Pythagoreans studied geometry as well as arithmetic. Indeed Diogenes Laertius
(vm, 12) tells us that Pythagoras himself studied especially 'the
arithmetical form of geometry', TO dcpi6|Jir|TiK6v eT8o$ ccuTfjs. But
whereas the opposition of Odd and Even is clearly appropriate in arithmetic, it is equally clear that it is not applicable to geometry. Evidently, therefore, when the Pythagoreans wished to find a similar pair of opposites to underlie geometry, they had recourse to
the pair which Pythagoras himself had already presumably discovered in his study of harmonics (see p. 229), namely Limit and
the Unlimited. Every geometrical figure can be naturally enough regarded as a parcel of unlimited space bounded by limiting points, lines or surfaces. At the same time it was clearly undesirable to
have two unrelated pairs of opposites underlying respectively arithmetic and geometry. The Pythagoreans therefore simply
equated Odd with Limit and Even with Unlimited, and proceeded to rationalize these by no means self-evident equations by a
number of curiously unconvincing arguments which we must next consider.
296 Contemporaneously with these philosophers and before them, the Pythagoreans, as they are called, devoted themselves to mathematics; they were thefast to advance this study,
and having been brought up in it they thought its principles were the principles of all things. Since of these principles numbers are by nature the fast. . .they supposed the elements of numbers to be the elements of all things. . . . The elements of number are the even and the odd, and of these the former is unlimited, and the latter limited. . . .

PRE-PARMENIDEAN PYTHAGORE ANISM
THE NATURE OF NUMBER
The early Pythagoreans, having no simple form of numerical notation, chose to express numbers in the form of patterns similar
to those now found on dominoes or dice. Thus the number 10 was
represented, as we have already seen (p. 230 note 2), by ten dots or alphas arranged in an equilateral triangle. Aristotle is certainly referring to two other such figures when he explains the Pythagorean equation of Even with Unlimited as follows :

Difficult as are the words xal X^P^S (which are usually taken to mean 'and in the other case'), there can be no doubt that the two
figures to which Aristotle is here referring are these :
Fig. i. Fig. 2.
Either of these figures can, of course, be extended, by the addition
of more 'gnomons', 1 ad infinitum. In Figure i, where 'the gnomons are being placed around the one', each successive addition marks
the next in the series of odd numbers, while Figure 2 similarly represents the series of even numbers. But whereas Figure i
remains, with each addition, always the same figure, a square, Figure 2 on the contrary changes with each addition the ratio of
its length to its height. Hence, of course, the inclusion of TGTpdycovov xai h-spo^Kes in the Table of Opposites; for iTepo^Kes, as
297 Further, the Pythagoreans identify the infinite with the even. For this, they say,
when it is taken in and limited by the odd, provides things with the element of infinity. An indication of this is what happens with numbers. If the gnomons are placed round the one, and without the one, in the one construction thefigure that results is always different, in the other it is always the same. But Plato. . .. (After Hardie)

we are told in many passages in later mathematical writers,2 refers
properly to a rectangle in which one side exceeds the other by a
single unit. And Aristotle is no doubt right in giving this as one of
the arguments by which the equations of Odd with Limit arid of
Even with Unlimited were justified. Figure i representing the Odd
is uniform, ev, Figure 2 representing the Even is infinitely variable, ocAAo del.
1 As Ross says in his note on this passage (Aristotle, Physics 542-5) :
* The
stricter meaning of the word (sc. "gnomon") is "the figure which remains
of a square when a smaller square is cut out of it". . . .But in a wider sense
yvcib|Jicov can stand for any number which when added to a figurate number gives the next number of the same figure (Iamb, in NIC. 58, 19 Pistelli; Hero/).//. 58).'

It seems probable, too, that the same two figures were used to
justify these equations in another way. Simplicius, commenting on the first words of this passage, writes as follows:

Whatever these commentators whom Simplicius quotes may have meant, they clearly cannot have meant that every even
298 An 'oblong number 9 is one which, when represented diagrammatically, has a foursided rectangular figure, but its sides are not equal, its length differing from its breadth by a single unit.
299 They meant by infinity even numbers, 'since everything even 9

say,
' is divisible into equal parts, and what is divisible into equal parts is infinite in respect of division into two; for division into halves goes on ad infinitum, while the addition of
the odd limits it by putting an end to halving

. So the commentators refer the unlimited to
the even in respect of divisibility into halves, and it is plain that they conceive of infinite divisibility in terms not of numbers but of magnitudes. . . .But Aristotle evidently does not
regard divisibility into halves as in any way an explanation of infinity.

number is divisible ad infinitum into halves; for it is an axiom common to all Greek mathematicians that the unit is indivisible and that such fractions as \ or T^ represent one unit out of a total
of 4 or 1 6. The easiest way to make sense of their comment can in
fact be represented diagrammatically so :

hand, as Figure 4 shows, has no 'middle'; and the absence of a e middle ' may well have provided the Pythagoreans with another
rationalization, however naive and artificial, for the equation of Even with Unlimited.

1 Aristotle has been discussing before this passage, and in the second sentence quoted is referring to, the theory held by Plato and some of the Platonists that number exists as a separate entity apart from sensible
things. On this theory see Ross, Ar. Met. liii-lvii.
The unfortunate consequence of their diagrammatic representation of numbers was that the Pythagoreans, thinking of numbers
as spatially extended and confusing the point of geometry with
302 Now the Pythagoreans also believe in one kind of number the mathematical; only they say it is not separate but sensible substances are formed out of it. For they construct the whole universe out of numbers only not numbers consisting of abstract units; they
suppose the units to have spatial magnitude All. . .suppose numbers to consist of
abstract units, except the Pythagoreans; but they suppose the numbers to have magnitude, as has been said before. (Trans. Ross)
303 The doctrine of the Pythagoreans in one way affords fewer difficulties than those before named, but in another way has others peculiar to itself. For not thinking of number
as capable of existing separately removes many of the impossible consequences; but that bodies should be composed of numbers, and that this should be mathematical number, is
impossible. For it is not true to speak of indivisible spatial magnitudes; and however much there might be magnitudes of this sort, units at least have not magnitude; and how can a magnitude be composed of indivisibles? But arithmetical number, at least, consists of abstract units, while these thinkers identify number with real things; at any rate they apply their propositions to bodies as if they consisted of those numbers.
(Trans. Ross)
246



PRE-PARMENIDEAN PYTHAGOREANISM
the unit of arithmetic, tended to imagine both alike as possess
ing magnitude. It is true that Aristotle, in discussing the views of earlier thinkers, often confronts them with such logical consequences of their doctrines as they themselves never either enunciated or foresaw; and no doubt in 303 he is, to some extent
at least, pursuing this usual practice. But 302 leaves no doubt that
the Pythagoreans did indeed assume, even though the assumption
was only tacit, 1 that units are spatially extended; and when we come to consider the paradoxes of Zeno we shall find that it is
against this assumption, along with the confusion of points and units, that they have their greatest force (see pp. 289 ff.).
1 This is, I believe, a point of great importance. In his review of J. E. Raven, Pythagoreans and Eleatics, G. Vlastos (Gnomon 25 (1953) 29-35), following Heidel (AJP 61 (1940) 29 n. 58), cites 304 Aetius i, 3, 19
ZupocKovcjios, els TGOV ITvOayopelcov, TTOCVTCOV T& dSiafpeTcc Kal T6 Kevov (sc. (5cpx&S elvai) TOCS y&p TTuGayoptKocs novaSas
irpcoTos dTT69T|vaTO cjconocTiKds. He then writes (p. 32): 'Whatever may be the date of Ecphantus, this statement definitely implies that
number-atomism was not regarded by the tradition stemming from
Theophrastus as an original feature of Pythagoreanism.' Even if we
accept, as we doubtless should, the view of both Heidel and Vlastos that Ecphantus 'was, at most, no earlier than the atomists and, more probably, a fourth-century figure' (Vlastos, p. 32 n. i), I cannot myself accept the implication which the statement of Aetius is said to carry. All that the
statement seems to me to imply is that Ecphantus was the first Pythagorean
explicitly to acknowledge the consequences of Zcno's attack upon the tacit
confusion of the earlier Pythagoreans. The phrase 'number-atomism* too
easily suggests (as it was meant to do by Gornford, who used it freely) a system in which units were explicitly stated to possess magnitude. It is not therefore appropriate to the present reconstruction of Pythagoreanism, which suggests only that the earlier Pythagoreans, like all the rest of the
Presocratics, failed to distinguish between the corporeal and the incorporeal. See further on Melissus, pp. 302 ff.
Nor, indeed, is that the full extent of the confusion. These unit
points functioned also as the basis of physical matter: they were
regarded in fact as a primitive form of atom. When, therefore, Aristotle speaks of number as cbs uAr|v TOIS oOai,
'
functioning as the material element in things', or when, as he often does, he
asserts that the Pythagoreans regarded the universe as consisting

305 Further, how are we to combine the belief that the modifications of number> and number itself, are causes of what exists and happens in the heavens bothfrom the beginning and now, and that there is no other number than this number out of which the world is
composed? (Trans. Ross)
306 But the Pythagoreans, because they saw many attributes of numbers belonging to sensible bodies, supposed real things to be numbers not separable numbers, however, but numbers of which real things consist. (Trans. Ross)
307 Since of these principles numbers are by nature thefirst, and in numbers they seemed to see many resemblances to the things that exist and come into being more than infire and earth and water (such and such a modification of numbers being justice, another being soul
and reason, another being opportunity and similarly almost all other things being
numerically expressible)
308 Pythagoras first attempted to discuss goodness, but not in the right way; for by referring the virtues to numbers he made his study of them inappropriate; for justice is not a square number.

We have seen in the last paragraph what the Pythagoreans meant by their equation of concrete objects with numbers: they meant that each such object consisted of a definite number of
unit-point-atoms. Accordingly we often find Aristotle protesting against the Pythagoreans, as he does, for instance, at 311 de caelo

ever, we are concerned with equations of, to us at least, a very
different type: the equation of justice with cxpiOiaos iadxis iao$ i.e. the first square number, 4 seems clearly symbolical rather than literal. It must once again be remembered, however, that Greek thinkers were very slow to apprehend that anything could
exist without spatial extension. Empedocles, as we shall see (424),
309 The Pythagoreans had before this treated of a few things, whose definitions they connected with numbers e.g. opportunity, justice or marriage. But it was natural that Socrates should seek the essence. (Trans. Ross)
310 When in one particular region they place opinion and opportunity, and, a little above or below, injustice and sifting or mixture, and allege as proof of this that each one of these is a number, and that in this place there is already a plurality of the extended bodies composed of numbers just because the qualities of number that constitute these are connected with these groups of places, this being so, is this number, which we must suppose each of these abstractions to be, the same number which is exhibited in the material universe, or is it another than this? (Trans. Ross, altered in accordance with his notes
on Ar. Met. 990 a 25 and 26, pp. 184-5) 311 For natural bodies are manifestly endowed with weight and lightness, but an
assemblage of units can neither be composed to form a body nor possess weight. (Trans. Stocks)

still speaks of his moving principles (as we might call them). Love and Strife, as 'equal in length and breadth to the four elements', and likewise Anaxagoras describes his Nous as 'the finest and purest of substances '
(503) . Plato seems to have been the first Greek
to have consciously thought that anything could exist otherwise than in space, and he was followed in this respect by Aristotle. 1 But that these two were the exception rather than the rule is
suggested by the fact that the Stoics still regarded justice, for
instance, as extended in space. It seems most probable, therefore,
that these early Pythagoreans had not clearly distinguished in their
own minds between such equations as, on the one hand, 'A man
= 250' and, on the other, 'Justice = 4'. The question in 310, whether it is the same kind of number in each case, is not only, in
fact, perfectly legitimate, but should probably be answered (though here again the Pythagoreans' assumption was doubtless only tacit rather than explicit) in the affirmative. Aristotle himself, having learnt the distinction between the concrete and the abstract, fails to
see the confusion underlying the Pythagorean equations of abstracts with numbers. But even if those equations had been intended, as
Cornford supposes (Plato and Parmenides 26), to be merely symbolical, they would still have had little appeal to a mind such as
Aristotle's.
1 Both Plato's Ideas and Aristotle's Unmoved Mover are explicitly stated by their authors to be not in space. See Plato Tim. 520 and Aristotle

312 It is strange also to attribute generation to eternal things, or rather this is one of the things that are impossible. There need be no doubt whether the Pythagoreans attribute
generation to them or not; for they obviously say that when the one had been constructed, whether out of planes or of surface or of seed or of elements which they cannot express, immediately the nearest part of the unlimited began to be drawn in and limited by the limit.

The mode of generation of 'the first unit with magnitude' is indeed, as Aristotle complains, one of the most mysterious features
of the Pythagorean cosmology, and there is no reliable evidence
apart from Aristotle's own words to enable us to solve the problem.
Fortunately, however, Aristotle's three suggestions in 312, which 'must have been prompted', as Cornford says (Plato and Parmenides
19; cf. Ross's note ad loc.), 'by known features of the system', give
us something to go on. Surfaces do certainly play a large part in Pythagorean cosmology; and XPOI& is to the Pythagoreans, as Aristotle himself tells us, so inseparable an aspect of surface that
the two words are actually synonymous :

Since, however, surfaces do not appear to be generated till a later stage in cosmogony (see pp. 253 ff.), it is the third suggestion
that appears the most plausible. 'This biological conception', as Cornford again wrote (ibid.), 'fits the notion of the world as a
living and breathing creature' (cf. 312 and also 316 below), 'which, like other living things, would grow from a seed to its full form. It also fits in with the position of the male principle under
Limit, the female under Unlimited, in the Table of Opposites.
'
This notion of the seed certainly looks like an early doctrine (cf.
the genealogical concept of cosmogony exemplified in ch. i), and its connexion with another Pythagorean view which there is reason
to regard as early, namely the Table of Opposites (see p. 241
note 2), serves perhaps to confirm what we might anyhow suspect. The early Pythagoreans may well, therefore, have initiated the
cosmogonical process by representing the male principle of Limit as somehow implanting in the midst of the surrounding Unlimited
the seed which, by progressive growth, was to develop into the visible universe. Here once again, however, it is possible that they
313 But how the fast unit with magnitude was constructed, they seem at a loss to describe.
314 For colour is either contained in the limit or actually is limit; and so the Pytha
goreans regarded surface and colour as synonymous.

felt no need, and consequently, as Aristotle's words in both 312
and 313 certainly suggest, simply omitted, to explain this mysterious beginning of cosmogony.

. Ross prints auT6 and Trveu^aTos, with some hesitation; but the
paraphrases of Philoponus (610, 8; 615, 23) and Simplicius (to whom Themistius is here closely similar) say nothing about infinite breath, but merely mention 'the surrounding infinite* or 'that which lies outside':

315 77^ Pythagoreans, too, held that void exists and that breath(?) and void enter from
the Unlimited into the heaven itself which, as it were, inhales; the void distinguishes the
natures of things, being a kind of separating and distinguishing factor between terms in series. This happens primarily in the case ofnumbers; for the void distinguishes their nature. 316 In the first book of his work On the philosophy of Pythagoras he writes that the universe is one, and thatfrom the unlimited there are drawn into it time, breath and the
void, which constantly distinguishes the places of the various classes of thing. 317 For since the dyad is the first extension (for the unit first extended into the dyad, so
to the triad and the numbers in succession), if we define the line, the Pythagoreans say, we should not call it quantity extended in one dimension, but the line is the first extension.
318 . . . The void enters the universe, which, as it were, inhales or breathes it in, just like breath, from that which surrounds it.

PRE-PARMENIDEAN PYTHAGOREANISM
pevou. This suggests that Simplicius read Trveunoc in his text of Aristotle, and that -rrveGnoc belongs to the inhalation image (according to Simplicius, though not to Philoponus and Themistius, it is explicitly a simile, i.e. oos in
315 means olov). If Simplicius is correct we must accept OCUTCO and TrveOnoc in Aristotle, and the meaning will be :
'
. . . and there enters into the universe itself out of the infinite, as though the universe were inhaling breath, even the void '. This eliminates the surprising idea (which is anyhow irrelevant to Aristotle's point) that the world draws in breath as well as the void ; though
the idea was accepted by Stobaeus in 316, perhaps through an ambiguity of Aristotle's language.
However it came into being, the first unit seems forthwith to
have begun, as it were, to inhale the surrounding Unlimited. Exactly as, in 297, the Even was said to be ' taken in and limited by the Odd', so in 312 'the nearest part of the Unlimited was drawn in and limited by Limit' or rather, to be precise, by the
first unit functioning as Limit. And now, in 315 and 316, we learn
something of the consequences of this progressive
' inhalation '
:
whether or not breath and time came with it, at all events the void entered in from outside. The function of the void is to keep things
apart and things include the units of arithmetic. Unfortunately Aristotle himself nowhere in his extant works tells us anything at all of the first consequence of this 'inhalation' of the void by the
first unit; but 317, which, in the opinion of Ross, 'was probably derived from Aristotle's lost work on the Pythagoreans' (note on
Ar. Met. Z 1 1, iO36b8), seems to fill the gap. Apparently the first
unit, like other living things, began at once to grow, and somehow as the result of its growth burst asunder into two ; whereupon the
void, fulfilling its proper function, keeps the two units apart, and thus, owing to the confusion of the units of arithmetic with the
points of geometry, brings into existence not only the number 2
but also the line. So the process is begun which, continuing indefinitely, is to result in the visible universe as we know it.

317 has already told us that, having generated the number 2, which equals the line, the first unit '
proceeds in the same way to
the number 3 and the other numbers in succession'; and just as
2 equals the line, so also, we learn from 319, 3 equals the triangle,
the simplest plane figure, and 4 the tetrahedron, the simplest solid. By the time of Aristotle there were already two different accounts given of the way in which the first unit proceeded to generate in turn the line, the plane and the solid. Besides the
apparently primitive method with which we are at present concerned, by which the 'inhalation' of the void resulted in the
division of the first unit into 2, 3 and 4 in succession, there was also a more sophisticated view by which the first unit ' flowed' into a line, the line into a plane and the plane into a solid. By this
method, however, which looks like a later refinement of the other,
the resulting figures are obviously not, as in 319, the triangle and the tetrahedron, but rather the square and the cube. 1 There is little doubt that the view of the early generation of Pythagoreans we are
now considering is that preserved by Speusippus in 319 ;
a and if, as
is usually assumed, 320 also refers to the Pythagoreans, then we have Aristotle's authority for the conclusion that points, lines and
planes, being regarded as 9uaei$, i.e. separate entities, played a vital part in Pythagorean cosmogony.

too; for thefirst principle in magnitude is the point, the second the line, the third surface and the fourth the solid.
320 There are some who, because the point is the limit and extreme of the line, the line of the plane, and the plane of the solid, think there must be real things of this sort.
(Trans. Ross) 321 For they say that the movement of a line creates a plane and that of the point a line; and likewise the movements of units will be lines. For the point is a unit having position.

Though the extant fragments ascribed to Philolaus are of very doubtful authenticity (see pp. 308 ff.), there can be little doubt that Speusippus is here at least preserving a genuinely early Pythagorean doctrine. Cf. also the sixth of the list of eleven Tctractycs preserved by Theo, where all but the second that consisting of the 'numbers by which Plato constructs the soul in the Timaeus' would seem to be derived from a Pythagorean source: 324

orepecp. This passage is of interest as confirming two points already made : first, that the first unit may have been deposited in the Unlimited like a
seed (cf. 312 and comment) ; and second, that the generation of numbers, geometrical figures and physical bodies is achieved by one and the same
process (cf. pp. 246 ff.).
So far, then, thanks to the tacit confusion between the unit of arithmetic and the point of geometry, the first unit has by one and the same process generated both the next three numbers in the series and the three dimensions. But once again the confusion does
not stop there. Just as the number 4, being composed of four unit
points, is equated with the simplest geometrical solid, so also that geometrical solid, being composed of four point-atoms, is itself a
322 Some say that the solid body is constructed from a single point; this point, by
fluxion, creates the line, the line, by fluxion, makes the plane, and it in turn, by moving upwards or downwards, generates the three-dimensional body. But this section of the
Pythagoreans differs from the earlier.
323 Speusippus. . .drawing on the Pythagorean doctrines that have always been particularly valued, and especially the writings of Philolaus, compiled an accomplished treatise which he entitled * On Pythagorean numbers '. . . .
324 The sixth tetractys is of things that grow. The seed is analogous to the unit and point, growth in length to the dyad and the line, growth in breadth to the triad and the plane, growth in depth to the tetrad and the solid.

physical body. The generation of the number-series is to the
Pythagoreans, in other words, both the generation of the objects of geometry and also cosmogony. Since things equal numbers, the first unit, in generating the number series, is generating also the physical universe.

On their implicit assumption that units, points and atoms are identical, the Pythagoreans have now succeeded in explaining the bare existence of physical bodies. But they have not yet begun to
explain the fact, which they can hardly have overlooked, that one such physical body differs in appearance and behaviour from
325 Evidently, then, these thinkers also consider that number is the principle both as
matter for things and as forming their modifications and their permanent states. . ..
326 Further, if we either granted them that spatial magnitude consists of these elements, or this were proved, still how would some bodies be light, and others have weight? To judge from what they assume and maintain, they speak no more of mathematical bodies than of perceptible; hence they have said nothing whatever about fire or earth or the other bodies
of this sort, I suppose because they have nothing to say which applies peculiarly to perceptible things. (Trans. Ross) 327 Once more, it has in no sense been determined in which way numbers are the causes
of substances and of being whether (i) as limits (as points are of spatial magnitudes) . . . or (2) is it because harmony is a ratio of numbers, and so is man and everything else? But how are the attributes white and sweet and hot numbers? (Trans. Ross)

another. The question that Aristotle asks in 326 is not, perhaps,
very difficult to answer: presumably bodies are light when they
contain a high proportion of void, and heavy when the proportions are reversed. But the question at the end of 327 (even if anachronistic, since the distinction had not yet been drawn between
qualities and things) is by no means so simple and can only be
answered with a conjecture. Every body consists, in varying proportions, of the two fundamental components, Limit and Unlimited; and those two fundamental components have each, as the Table of Opposites shows, their respective manifestations in
different spheres. According, therefore, as either Limit or Unlimited prevails in the constitution of a thing, so presumably will that thing reveal more of the one principle's manifestations
more, for instance, of rest, straightness, goodness or light and less of the other. This is admittedly a very unsatisfactory explanation of so important a factor in cosmology as qualitative distinctions. But this particular deficiency in the Pythagorean system should surprise us the less when we find, as we do, that this is one of the
grounds on which Aristotle most strongly and repeatedly criticizes
the Pythagoreans.

name counter-earth. In all this they are not seeking for theories and causes to account for observed facts, but rather forcing their observations and trying to accommodate them to certain theories and opinions of their own. But there are many others who would agree that
it is wrong to give the earth the central position, looking for confirmation rather to theory than to the facts of observation. Their view is that the most precious place befits the most
precious thing: but fire, they say, is more precious than earth, and the limit than the intermediate, and the circumference and the centre are limits. Reasoning on this basis they take the view that it is not earth that lies at the centre of the sphere, but rather fire, (b i) The
Pythagoreans have a further reason. They hold that the most important part of the world, which is the centre, should be most strictly guarded, and name it, or rather the fire which occupies that place, the 'Guard-house of Zeus', as if the word 'centre* were quite unequivocal, and the centre of the mathematical figure were always the same with that of the thing or the natural centre. But it is better to conceive of the case of the whole heaven as analogous to that of animals, in which the centre of the animal and that of the body are
different. (After Stocks) 330 From all this it is clear that the theory that the movement of the stars produces a
harmony, i.e. that the sounds they make are concordant, in spite of the grace and originality with which it has been stated, is nevertheless untrue. Some thinkers suppose that the motion of bodies of that size must produce a noise, since on our earth the motion of bodies far inferior in size and in speed of movement has that effect. Also, when the sun and the moon,

There is unfortunately no sure means of precisely dating either of these celebrated doctrines, the Counter-Earth (328 and 3291
) and
the ' Harmony of the Spheres' (330). The former is explicitly attributed by Aetius to Philolaus ;
2 but despite the relative reliabi
lity of its source the attribution has often been doubted. On the
whole it seems legitimate provisionally to accept the attribution of the Counter-Earth doctrine to Philolaus (see pp. 307 ff.), while the
doctrine of the 'Harmony of the Spheres', which is considerably less complicated, may perhaps be surmised to have originated
early in the fifth century B.C., when, thanks to Pythagoras' own discovery that the intervals of the musical scale could be expressed
as numerical ratios (see pp. 229 f.), the Pythagoreans seem, in Aristotle's words in 289, to have 'collected and fitted into their scheme all the properties of numbers and scales which they could show to agree with the attributes and parts and the whole arrangement of the heavens'.
1 Simplicius, paraphrasing, expanding, and commenting on this passage,
adds just sufficient detail, derived in part from Aristotle's lost work On the
Pythagoreans, to be worth quoting at some length: 33* Simplicius de caelo
they say, and all the stars, so great in number and in size, are moving with so rapid a motion, how should they not produce a sound immensely great? Startingfrom this argument andfrom the observation that their speeds, as measured by their distances, are in the same ratios as musical concordances, they assert that the sound given forth by the circular movement of the stars is a harmony. Since, however, it appears unaccountable that we should not hear this music, they explain this by saying that the sound is in our ears from the very
moment of birth and is thus indistinguishable from its contrary silence, since sound and silence are discriminated by mutual contrast. What happens to men, then, is just what happens to coppersmiths, who are so accustomed to the noise of the smithy that it makes no
difference to them. (Trans. Stocks)

Hilda Richardson (CQjzo (1926) 1 19) argues, on the basis of this passage and a number of other less definite indications, that 'the earliest generations of the Pythagorean school conceived of fire as existing at the heart of their central, spherical earth*. But whether this is so or not, Simplicius himself evidently believed that the earlier Pythagorean theory was geocentric, and that the more sophisticated doctrine was a later refinement.

counter-earth^ being itself an earth, and called the counter-earth because it is opposite this earth of ours; and after the counter-earth comes our earth, which also moves around the
centre; and after the earth comes the moon; for so Aristotle records in his work On the
Pythagoreans. The earth, being one of the stars and moving around the centre, makes day and night in accordance with its position relative to the sun. The counter-earth, as it moves around the centre following our earth, is invisible to us because the bulk of the earth is
always in the way For on their assumption that the decad is the perfect number, they wished to bring the number of bodies revolving in a circle also up to ten. And so, Aristotle
says, positing the sphere of the fixed stars as one, the planets as seven, and then this earth of ours, they completed the decad with the counter-earth. So Aristotle expounded the Pythagoreans' views; but the more genuine members of the school regardJire at the centre as the creative force which gives life to the whole earth from the centre and warms its cold parts;
and so some call it the * Tower ofgeus', as Aristotle recorded in On the Pythagoreans, others the 'Guard-house of %eus\ as he says here, others again the ' Throne of %eus\ as other authorities tell us.
332 Philolaus placesJire around the centre of the universe, and calls it the 'Hearth of the world 9
, the 'House oj %,eus\ ''Mother of the Gods 9
, 'altar, bond and measure of nature 9
.
Then again there is another fire enveloping the universe at the circumference. But he says that the centre is by nature primary, and around the centre ten divine bodies dance first

Here we have at least four different (though not necessarily
mutually exclusive) views of the soul, each of which is said by
Aristotle to be Pythagorean. Once again the attempt to date them
can rest only upon conjecture. It seems probable that the view in 334, that the soul is either the motes in the air or that which
then the counter-earth, and finally the fire of the * Hearth ', which has its station around the centre.
333 . . . such and such a modification of numbers being justice, another being soul and reason ....
334 The theory held by the Pythagoreans seems to have the same purport; for some of them said that the soul is the motes in the air, others that it is what moves them. They spoke of motes because they are evidently in continual motion, even when there is a complete calm.
335 Another theory has been handed down to us about the soul---- They say that it is a
kind of attunement; for attunement is a blending and composing of opposites, and the body is constituted of opposites.
336 But they only attempt to say what sort of a thing the soul is, while concerning the body that is to receive it they specify nothing further, as if it were possible, by the Pythagorean tales, for any chance soul to enter into any chance body.
261



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
moves them, belongs to the early and unwittingly corporealist generation which thought that units were extended in space. The doctrine in 335, on the other hand, that the soul is an attunement (which is of course reconcilable with the view mentioned in 333
that it is a u6c8o$ ocpidjjicov) may have originated from the laovojjiia
view of health introduced by Alcmacon (see pp. 234 f.), and in that case would not have been held before his time. Finally, the
familiar belief in transmigration, to which Aristotle is clearly
referring in 336, is a belief of a different order, not being concerned with the nature of the soul as such but rather with what befalls it.
This is one of the few traces of the religious side of Pythagoreanism that are to be found in Aristotle's extant writings; and it is note
worthy that in this unusual context he uses, not the familiar form
fTvOccyopeios, but the variant, very seldom found in his works,
TTuOccyopiKos. The belief in transmigration goes back, as we saw (pp. 222 f.), to Pythagoras himself, but was certainly preserved, throughout the whole of the fifth century at least, by the Acous
matics (see p. 227). It would be possible, if perhaps dangerously conjectural, to fit all these theories into a consistent picture, as follows. The earliest Pythagoreans might well have maintained that between its various incarnations the soul, separated from a body, hovered in the air like the motes in a sunbeam ; and in that case others of the school,
feeling perhaps that this was too humble a part, preferred to regard it rather as that which moved the motes (conceivably even
as the TrveOuoc or Trvofj ('breath') of 315 and 316). Alcmaeon could then have borrowed from these earliest Pythagoreans the belief,
which underlies also his own peculiar view of the soul (cf. p. 235),
that the soul is always in motion. Finally the next generation of
Pythagoreans, borrowing in their turn from Alcmaeon, may have
based upon his theory of health their own doctrine, by far the most influential of those under discussion, that the soul was an
attunement of the bodily constituents.

Whether or not Parmenides and Zeno ever visited Athens and met there the young Socrates, Plato need not have been so precise
about their respective ages. The fact that he gives these details
strongly suggests that he is writing with chronological accuracy. Socrates was just over seventy when he was put to death in
399 B.C., which means that he was born in 470/469. If we assume
that the words oxpoSpa VEOV,
c
very young', mean that he was under
twenty-five, then the meeting might have taken place between 450 and 445 B.C. This places Parmenides' birth at about 515
337 According to Antiphon's account, Pythodorus said that Parmenides and %eno once came to Athensfor the Great Panathenaea. Parmenides was well advanced inyears about
sixty-Jive and very grey, but a fine-looking man. ^eno was then nearlyforty', and tall and handsome; he was said to have been Parmenides^ favourite. They were staying at Pythodorus 9 house outside the city-wall in the Ceramicus. Thither went Socrates, and several
others with him, in the hope ofhearing ^eno^s treatise; for this was thefirst time Parmenides and %eno had brought it to Athens. Socrates was still very young at the time.
338 Parmenides flourished in the sixty-ninth Olympiad.

510 B.C. and Zeno's at about 490-485. It is of course true that the
date given by Diogenes, which he probably derived from Apollodorus, does not nearly square with this; but, as Burnet points out
(EGPiyo), c the date given by Apollodorus depends solely on that of the foundation of Elea (540 B.C.), which he had adopted as the
floruit of Xenophanes. Parmenides is born in that year, just as
Zeno is born in the year when Parmenides " flourished". ' Unsatis
factory as a late Platonic dialogue may be as evidence for
chronology, it can hardly be doubted that it is more reliable than
this. But in any case what really matters is not so much Par
menides' precise dates as his relation to the other Presocratics. We
shall see as we proceed that his poem certainly contains references
to Anaximenes (see p. 275) and perhaps also to Heraclitus (see
pp. 183 and 272), while both Empedocles and Anaxagoras refer often and obviously to Parmenides (cf. 414-416, 497).

339 Parmenides of Elea, son of Pyres, was a pupil of Xenophanes (and he, according to Theophrastus in his Epitome, of Anaximander) . But though a pupil of Xenophanes, he did notfollow him. He associated also, as Sotion recorded, with the Pythagorean Ameinias, son ofDiochaitas, a poor but noble man, whom he preferred tofollow. When Ameinias died Parmenides, who came of a distinguishedfamily and was rich, built a shrine to him. It was by Ameinias rather than Xenophanes that he was converted to the contemplative life. . . . He
is said also to have legislated for the citizens of Elea, as Speusippus records in his work

These two passages, though both from late authors, preserve two traditions which are likely enough, on other grounds, to be true. That Parmenides should have taken an active part in the politics of his city is in no way surprising: several of the Presocratic
philosophers did. And that he should originally have been a
Pythagorean is not only not unlikely in itself, Elea being no great distance from Croton and Metapontium, but is borne out by
internal evidence in his poem (see especially p. 277). Again, the statement in 339 that it was not Xenophanes but the otherwise
unknown Pythagorean Ameinias who ' converted ' Parmenides to the philosophic life is not the sort of thing to be invented. Aristotle
himself, possibly misled by a remark of Plato's in the Sophist
(2420-0, cf. 166) which is not to be taken seriously, says of Parmenides that 'he is supposed to have been a pupil of Xeno
phanes 5
(Met. AS, 986 b 22, DK28A6); and Sotion, whom Diogenes is quoting in 339, must have had some good reason possibly the existence of the shrine erected by Parmenides in
memory of Ameinias for rejecting Aristotle's guidance and sub
stituting for Xenophanes so obscure a figure. When it is remembered, finally, that these traditions are probably derived from such earlier authorities as the fourth-century historian Timaeus, there
seems to be no good ground for rejecting the scanty evidence we possess about the life of Parmenides.
THE NATURE OF PARMENIDES' POEM
Parmenides wrote exclusively in hexameter verse in which he
was followed by Empedocles. With the exception of the allegory of the proem (and perhaps also certain passages in the 'Way of Seeming', in which divine figures were introduced), his subjectmatter is of the most prosaic order. His diction, moreover, besides
being far from poetical, is often exceedingly obscure : the precise meaning of some of his sentences will probably never be unani
mously agreed. Thanks to Simplicius, who, knowing that the original work was already in his day rare, transcribed large
341 Parmenides set his own state in order with such admirable laws that the government yearly swears its citizens to abide by the laws of Parmenides.
265



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
sections of it into his commentaries on Aristotle, we possess,
probably, a higher proportion of the writings of Parmenides than of any other Prcsocratic philosopher. After the allegorical introduction the poem is in two parts, the ' Way of Truth ' and the ' Way
of Seeming'. The former, of which Diels estimated that we possess
about nine-tenths, presents an unprecedented exercise in logical
deduction: starting from the premise ecrn, 'it is', in much the same way as Descartes started from the premise 'cogito' Parmenides proceeds, by the sole use of reason unaided by the senses, to deduce all that can be known about Being, and he ends
by denying any truthful validity to the senses or any reality to what they appear to perceive. Then in the 'Way of Seeming', unexpectedly reinstating the world of appearances that he has so vehemently demolished, he appends what seems, from the relatively scanty fragments that survive, to have been a cosmogony of the traditional type. The relation between the two parts of the
poem is by no means obvious and has, as we shall see, been very
variously interpreted; but fortunately it is the 'Way of Truth', of
which so large a proportion survives, that made Parmenides the most influential of all the Presocratics, while the 'Way of Seeming', whatever the motive that prompted Parmenides to write it, seems to have exercised comparatively little influence upon his successors
(but see p. 283).

Barnett Wilamowitz (=* stretched through all things') seems improbable,
since T<rr6s occurs elsewhere only once, in Aristotle's Hist. An. The reading
while the daughters of the Sun, hasting to convey me into the light, threw back the veilsfrom off theirfaces and left the abode ofnight. There are the gates of the ways of Night and Day, fitted above with a lintel and below with a threshold of stone. They themselves, high in the air, are closed by mighty doors, and avenging Justice controls the double bolts. Her did the maidens entreat with gentle words and cunningly persuade to unfasten without demur the bolted barfrom the gates. Then, when the doors were thrown back, they disclosed a wide opening, when their brazen posts fitted with rivets and nails swung in turn on their hinges. Straight through them, on the broad way, did the maidens guide the horses and the car. And the goddess greeted me kindly, and took my right hand in hers, and spake to me these words: * Welcome, o youth, that earnest to my abode on the car that bears thee, tended by immortal charioteers. It is no ill chance, but right and justice, that has sent thee forth to travel on this way. Far indeed does it lie from the beaten track of men. Meet it is that thou shouldst learn all things, as well the unshaken heart of well-rounded truth, as the opinions of mortals in which is no true belief at all. Tet none the less shall thou learn these things also how,
passing right through all things, one shouldjudge the things that seem to be. 9

of N, by its suggestion that Parmenides was an itinerant philosopher, accords with the statement of Plato that Parmenides and Zeno visited Athens.
2 Soxfucos (Simpl. mss.) is adopted in DK, though Diels himself, admitting
an elision otherwise unknown in hexameters, read SOKIUCOCT* elvcci. irspcovTa Simpl. A: irep 6vTa DEF.
This proem is not only of the utmost interest as a whole but also
contains a numberofimportant points ofdetail. Parmenides is clearly
describing his escape from error to enlightenment, and it is most likely that, as Diels suggested, the allegorical form is borrowed from oracle
and mystery-literature.
c It is clear', writes Bowra (Problems in Greek Poetry 47), 'that this Proem is intended to have the importance and
seriousness of a religious revelation.' Not only the passage from
darkness into light but many minor details throughout the poem sug
gest that Parmenides desired, particularly in the Proem, to arm himself in advance, by stressing the religious nature of his revelation, with an answer to his potential critics. Bowra is probably right in
concl uding that these potential critics were ' his fellow Pythagoreans '
.
Two points of detail call for comment. It is to be noted, in the
first place, that the goddess is made to address Parmenides (1. 24)
as Koups, 'youth 3
, a word which provides us with our only clue as to the date of the poem's composition. If we take this to mean
that Parmenides was, at the most, not much over thirty when he wrote his poem, that would fix its date somewhere between, say, 490 and 475 B.C. ; and if this estimate is right, then we have an
approximate terminus ad quern, not only for several of the Pytha
gorean views already described, against which we shall see that
Parmenides especially aims many of his arguments, but also, possibly, for the publication of the fundamental doctrine of Heraclitus.
The other important point concerns the phrase (1. 29) 'AA^Qeiris
EUKUKA^OS,
c well-rounded Truth'. Truth is described as well
rounded because, presumably, wherever you pick up the chain of Parmenides' reasoning, you can follow it round in a circle,
passing through each of its links in turn, back to your startingpoint. Parmenides himself says almost exactly that in fragment 5 :

The goddess begins her instruction by defining
c the only two
conceivable ways of enquiry', which are directly contrary one to the other: if you accept one premise, then logic compels you to reject the other. The choice in fact, as Parmenides later puts it in
its briefest form (347 1. 16), is simply this: ECJTIV f| OUK eoriv.
Unfortunately even to translate these apparently simple words is liable to be misleading, because of the ambiguity, of which Parmenides himself was unconscious, between the predicative and the existential senses of the Greek word iori. 1 The usual translation,
'It is or it is not', too easily gives rise to the question what 'it' is.
So Burnct, for instance, at the beginning of his discussion of the Way of Truth (EGP 1 78), writes :
* ... it is not quite obvious at first sight what it is precisely that is. . ..There can be no real doubt that this is what we call body . . . .The assertion that it is amounts
just to this, that the universe is a plenum.
9 Such a conclusion is at
best premature. At this early stage in his poem Parmenides'
premise eon has no definite subject at all: if it is necessary to translate the sentence eoriv fj OUK e'cmv, then perhaps the least
misleading rendering is :
' Either a thing is or it is not.' Parmenides
is attacking those who believe, as all men always had believed,
344 Come now, and I will tell thee and do thou hearken and carry my word away
the only ways of enquiry that can be thought of [literally, that exist for thinking, the old dative sense of the infinitive]: the one way, that it is and cannot not-be, is the path of
Persuasion, for it attends upon Truth; the other, that it is-not and needs must not-be, that I tell thee is a path altogether unthinkable. For thou couldst not know that which is-not
(that is impossible) nor utter it; for the same thing can be thought as can be [construction as above, literally the same thing exists for thinking and for being].
269



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
that it is possible to make a significant negative predication ; but he is enabled to attack them only because of his own confusion
between a negative predication and a negative existential judgement. The gist of this difficult and important fragment is therefore
this: 'Either it is right only to think or say of a thing, "it is. . ."
(i.e. "it is so-and-so, e.g. white"), or else it is right to think or say only "it is not. . ." (i.e. "it is not something else, e.g. black"). The latter is to be firmly rejected on the ground [a mistaken one, owing to the confusion between existential and predicative] that it is impossible to conceive of Not-Being, the non-existent. Any
propositions about Not-Being are necessarily meaningless; the only significant thoughts or statements concern Being.'
1 Owing to this undetected ambiguity it is often difficult to decide how the
word OTI should be accented in Parmenides' poem. I have for the most part, but not always, followed DK; where I have diverged, see the parentheses in the translation.
A page or two after the sentences quoted in the last paragraph
Burnct, in discussing the effects of Parmenides' '
thorough-going dialectic', adds (p. 180): 'Philosophy must now cease to be monistic or cease to be corporealist. It could not cease to be
corporealist; for the incorporeal was still unknown.' This too
seems an over-simplification. It is true that the incorporeal was still unknown; but it does not follow from that that Parmenides
was wishing to describe 'body' or 'a plenum*. On the contrary, the chief difficulty about Parmenides is that, while the incorporeal was still unknown, and no vocabulary therefore existed to describe it, he was none the less, as were the Pythagoreans in the choice of
their first principles, feeling his way towards it. We shall see (pp. 302 ff.) that Melissus carried the advance a stage further; but it seems probable, even in the case of Parmenides, that had he been asked whether his 'Being' was solid (or 'body') his answer would have been a hesitant negative.

Though Parmenides has, in 344, suggested that there are only
two 'conceivable ways of enquiry', either a thing is or it is not, it
now appears from these two fragments (which seem to present a continuous passage) that in addition to the true premise there are
actually two premises that must be rejected. One of these, of course, is that already defined in fr. 2, the premise OUK lort, and
described as TravaireuOea,
'
altogether inconceivable '
; misguided as
men may be, no man could confine himself to negative judgements
and negative statements only. But for all that, the goddess (in 345
1. 3) warns Parmenides against treading this path, because, as she
goes on to suggest (in 11. 8-9), this utterly false way can be, and constantly is, so combined with the true way that a third way, a
compromise between the other two, a thing both is and is not, comes into the picture. This third way is the way on which 'ignorant mortals wander two-faced'; and they are two-faced
because, as Simplicius puts it (Phys. 117, 3; DKsSfiG), els TaCmb ovvdyoucri TOC avTiKetneva, 'they combine contraries'. It is in fact
thefirst way of enquiryfrom which I hold thee back, and then from that way also on which
mortals wander knowing nothing, two-headed; for helplessness guides the wandering thought in their breasts; they are carried along, deafand blind at once, altogether dazed hordes devoid ofjudgement, who are persuaded that to be and to be-not are the same, yet
not the same, and that of all things the path is backward-turning.
346 For never shall this be proved, that things that are not are; but do thou hold back thy
thought from this way of enquiry, nor let custom, born of much experience, force thee to let wander along this road thy aimless eye, thy echoing ear or thy tongue; but do thou judge by reason the strife-encompassed proof that I have spoken.
271



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
this very combination of contraries that is the basis of 'the
opinions of mortals' (342 1. 30 and 353 1. 51) which provide the content of the Way of Seeming; the premise upon which the whole
Way of Seeming rests is just this compromise between the true
way and the utterly false way, a thing both is and is not. It has often been suggested that the last clause of 345, TTOCVTCOV 5
TraAfvTpOTT6$ ECTTI t<Aev;6o$ (translated 'of all things the path is backward-turning'), contains a special reference to the doctrines
of Heraclitus; and so translated, it certainly is particularly appropriate to the Heraclitcan bdief that all things eventually
change into their opposites (see pp. 195 f.).
1 But it is by no means
the case that unless we see such a reference, then the last two lines
of the fragment are meaningless. They need not necessarily mean anything more than that mortals as a whole (note dKprroc 90 Ace,
' hordes devoid of judgement') 'have made up their minds to believe that to be and not to be are the same and yet not the same ' (i.e. they believe that that which is can change and become not
what it was before. To be and not to be are the same in that they
are both found in any event; and yet they are obviously opposites and are therefore, in a more exact sense, not the same), 'and they imagine that all things pass back and forth between being and
not-being' (i.e. all things change from being so-and-so, e.g. hot, to not being so-and-so, and then change back again).
1 A quite different interpretation of this last clause is possible, taking TrAvTOOv as masculine and KeAeu0o$ (as in 344 1. 4) as a * way of thought ',
which is described as TrocAivTpoiros because, having started out promisingly by saying fori, these muddlers turn back on their tracks by adding OUK IOTI. If this interpretation were adopted, the case for seeing here a reference to Heraclitus (which anyhow was largely based on the
doubtful reading TraAfvTpoiros for iraAivTovos in 212) would be further weakened.
(iii) Deductions from the true premise:
(a) denial of time, the void, plurality
The premise eon is by now established as the only possibility : the
only significant thought or statement is that a thing is. At this
stage, therefore, Parmenides proceeds to consider precisely what must be the nature of the subject of the only true statement that can be made. From now onwards until the end of the Way of Truth he is concerned, in other words, to deduce all that can be deduced from his chosen premise about the properties of Being.

This passage, though it presents a continuous argument and is impossible to subdivide, leads Parmenides none the less to more than one conclusion; and each of his affirmations involves a
corresponding denial. The selected premise eon, being the only
347 One way only is left to be spoken of, that it is; and on this way are full many signs that what is is uncreated and imperishable, for it is entire, immovable and without end. It
was not in the past, nor shall it be, since it is now, all at once, one, continuous; for what creation wilt thou seek for it? how and whence did it grow? Nor shall I allow thee to say or to think, 'from that which is not 9
; for it is not to be said or thought that it is not. And what need would have driven it on to grow, starting from nothing, at a later time rather than an earlier? Thus it must either completely be or be not. Nor will the force of true belief allow that, beside what is, there could also arise anything from what is not;
wherefore Justice looseth not her fetters to allow it to come into being or perish, but holdeth it fast; and the decision on these matters rests here: it is or it is not. But it has surely been decided, as it must be, to leave alone the one way as unthinkable and nameless
(for it is no true way), and that the other is real and true. How could what is thereafter
perish? and how could it come into being? For if it came into being, it is not, nor if it is
going to be in thefuture. So coming into being is extinguished and perishing unimaginable.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
true premise, must, Parmenides first argues, be eternally true; there cannot ever have been a time in the past, nor will there ever be a time in the future, when the statement ecm is anything but
true. It follows, therefore, that past and future arc alike meaning
less, the only time is a perpetual present time, and Being must of necessity be both uncreated and imperishable. Parmenides actually adds in the course of this argument that Being must also
be both dTpejjies, 'immovable', and ev, cruvexes, 'one, continuous';
but unless each of these epithets is interpreted (not very plausibly, since cruvexes unquestionably refers to space, not time, in 348 1. 25)
to mean only that Being exists unalterably in one continuous
present, then he is here anticipating for 'it is all one to him where he begins' (343) conclusions which he does not establish
until later in the present fragment. The next step in the argument, which occupies 11. 6-u, is the demolition of the concept of the void. The cosmogony of the
Pythagoreans had made great use of the void : the first unit, once
generated, had proceeded forthwith to take in from the surrounding
Unlimited, possibly time (which Parmenides has just demolished),
and certainly the void (to which he now turns his attention) ; and the void had from the outset fulfilled its vitally important function
of keeping units apart (see pp. 252 f.). It is tempting to suppose
that Parmenides, whom there is reason to suspect of being a
dissident Pythagorean (cf. p. 265), aims the three questions that these lines contain at the very cosmogony that he had come to reject. At all events the Pythagoreans' answer to the second of
these questions (TTTJ iroOev ccur|0ev;) could only be that their first unit had grown by 'inhaling' the void; and Parmenides' imme
diate demolition of that concept effectually destroys, therefore, the very basis of their cosmogony. Moreover, even granting that the first unit had indeed so developed, as the Pythagoreans maintained, into the universe as we know it, why should the process
have ever begun at one moment rather than another? Being
must either exist as a whole or not exist at all: that (as 11. 15-18
repeat) has already been established. Yet the Pythagoreans assert that more and more of Being is constantly coming into existence from the unreal void.
The last point established in this passage before Parmenides rounds it off with a summary is that contained in lines 12-13.
Unfortunately this particular sentence is ambiguous. It could
274



PARMENIDES
perhaps mean simply that nothing can come from TO \*r\ 6v,
c that
which does not exist', except Not-Being; but in view of the fact
that it follows, in its context, immediately after nine lines that are
concerned entirely with TO 6v, 'Being' (in one of which, 1. 6, TO 6v is referred to as CCUTO), it seems preferable to follow Cornford (Plato and Parmenides 37) and translate: 'Nor will the force of belief
suffer to arise out of what is not something over and above it (viz.
what is).
5 In any case, as Cornford points out, this latter sense is unquestionably contained in another brief sentence further on in
the same fragment (352 11. 36-7).

In these two short passages Parmenides reinforces his earlier denial of the void by a fresh argument which appears to be aimed both at Anaximenes and at the Pythagoreans. Anaximenes by his doctrine of condensation and rarefaction (see pp. 145 ff.), the
Pythagoreans by their view of the void as x00? 10"!-^ TIS TCOV
^e^fjs KCCI 8iopicri$,
* a kind of separation and definition of things
in proximity' (see 315), had both alike been guilty of assuming the existence of what is not. Being, Parmenides maintains against
them, is both indivisible and homogeneous.
348 Nor is it divisible, since it is all alike; nor is there more here and less there, which
would prevent itfrom cleaving together, but it is allfull of what is. So it is all continuous; for what is clings close to what is.
349 Look steadfastly at things which, though far off, are yet present to thy mind; for thou shalt not cut off what is from clinging to what is, neither scattering itself everywhere in order nor crowding together.

These two passages are actually separated by eight lines of summary, but by temporarily omitting those eight lines the argument is shown to be so continuous that they are best treated
together. Parmenides is of course inevitably repetitive, because, as we saw (343), his arguments are so closely linked one with another that each attribute of Being can be deduced from any

since coming into being and perishing have been driven far away, cast out by true belief. Abiding the same in the same place it rests by itself, and so abides firm where it is; for
strong Necessity holds it firm within the bonds of the limit that keeps it back on every side, because it is not lawful that what is should be unlimited; for it is not in need if it were9 it would need all.
351 But since there is afurthest limit, it is bounded on every side, like the bulk of a wellrounded sphere, from the centre equally balanced in every direction; for it needs must not be somewhat more here or somewhat less there. For neither is there that which is not, which might stop it from meeting its like, nor can what is be more here and less there than
what is, since it is all inviolate; for being equal to itself on every side, it rests uniformly within its limits.

PARMENIDES
hardly fail to notice, in these sixteen lines, the recurrent emphasis
placed on the conception of limit, TreTpas. Now Limit, as one of the two fundamental Pythagorean principles, stood at the top of the left-hand column in the Table of Opposites (see 289) ; and
among the concepts listed in that column was one, namely unity, which Parmenides has already accepted as consistent with his
premise. Moreover, there is another point in these two passages that Parmenides is evidently concerned to stress: Being or the
One is OCKIVTITOV, 'motionless', ev TOUTGD jjievov, 'resting in the
same place', ejjrrreSov, 'stable', and laoiraAes, 'equally poised'. It
is in fact, in Pythagorean terminology, fjpenouv, 'at rest', as opposed to KivouiJievov, 'in motion'. It begins to look almost as if
Parmenides, having been reared in the Pythagorean school, had come to feel that the fatal flaw in Pythagoreanism was its dualism. At all events he seems so far, while denying the existence of those two manifestations of the Unlimited, time and the void, to be
applying to his Being those attributes from the left-hand column
of the Table of Opposites that can be apprehended by the sole
use of reason as opposed to the senses.

352 What can be thought is only the thought that it is. [The infinitive by itself seldom bears the sense of the infinitive with article i.e. *
thinking*'; the construction must be the same as in 344 and 345 that is: the only thing that exists
for thinking is the thought that it is.] For you will not find thought without what is, in relation to which it is uttered; for there is not, nor shall be, anything else besides what is, since Fatefettered it to be entire and immovable. Wherefore all these are mere names which mortals laid down believing them to be true coming into being and perishing, being and not being, change ofplace and variation of bright colour.

presumably specified as being a type of change that docs not involve change of place; both locomotion and qualitative change are 'mere names'.

353 Parmenides effects the transition from the objects of reason to the objects of sense, or, as he himselfputs it, from truth to seeming, when he writes: * Here I end my trustworthy discourse and thought concerning truth; henceforth learn the beliefs of mortal men, listening to the deceitful ordering of my words '
; and he then himself makes the elemental principles
of created things the primary opposition of light and darkness, as he calls them, or fire and
earth, or dense and rare, or sameness and difference; for he says immediately after the lines quoted above: * For they made up their minds to name two forms, of which they must not

1 This passage of Simplicius actually ends here, at 1. 59, but elsewhere (Phys. 39, 8) he appends also the next two lines, [dpociov] seel. Dicls.
Parmenides has now, in the Way of Truth, taught us all that
reason, unaided by the senses, can deduce about Being. It is a
single, indivisible and homogeneous sphere, timeless, changeless and (since there is no void either inside it or outside) motionless. It has in fact no perceptible qualities whatever. If Parmenides had taken the left-hand column of the Pythagorean Table of Opposites and selected from it those concepts which could be
apprehended by reason alone, the result would be much what his
One is ; while to the right-hand column, the various manifestations of the Unlimited, he has denied any reality whatever. Such are the consequences of the exercise of reason. Now, however, in passing from the Way of Truth to the Way of Seeming, Parmenides
passes, as Simplicius saw, onto TCOV VOTJTCOV eiri TOC aiaOriTci, 'from the objects of reason to the objects of sense' ; and just as in the Way
of Truth the objects of sense have been altogether excluded, so also, as we shall see, the Way of Seeming will exclude altogether the
objects of reason. Since all objects of sense are, to Parmenides, 'mere names' without substantial existence, he is obviously com
pelled to base his survey of them upon the false assumptions which he himself declines to share with mortals; but at the same time his
survey does not cover all those false assumptions. Besides allowing
existence to non-existent phenomena, most men went so far as to confuse them with the objects of reason. Parmenides will not, even in what he knows and avows to be 'a deceitful ordering of words' (1. 52), follow them as far as that in their error.
The significance and purpose of the Way of Seeming has been very variously interpreted. Whereas Zeller for instance, following,
as he thought, a suggestion by Theophrastus, 1 regarded it as a review of popular beliefs, Burnet (EGP 184-5) concluded that 'in the absence of evidence to the contrary' it should be regarded
rather as 'a sketch of contemporary Pythagorean cosmology 5
.
Against any such view there are several strong arguments. The
ance and heavy. The whole ordering of these I tell thee as it seems likely, that so no thought of mortal men shall ever outstrip thee. 9

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Way of Seeming, contrary to Burnet's view, bears no discernible trace of the two fundamental Pythagorean doctrines the opposition of Limit and Unlimited, and the equation, in whatever sense, of things with numbers; nor do the remarks of the ancient commentators indicate that there ever was any trace of these doctrines
anywhere in the whole poem. It does, on the other hand, contain
at least one doctrine, that of the OT9(5cvai in 358 and 359, of which
there is no trace in the Pythagorean cosmology, nor indeed any
where else except possibly in Anaximander (see pp. I35ff.). Finally, it is surely inconceivable that all the ancient commentators
should have regarded the cosmology of the Way of Seeming, as they all, including Theophrastus, almost invariably did, as Parmenides' own invention, if it was in reality nothing but a sum
mary of either popular beliefs or contemporary Pythagoreanism.

Zeller, used this passage to show that in the opinion of Theophrastus Parmcnides meant to give the belief of 'the many'. It is, however, open
to doubt whether Theophrastus here meant any more than that in the opinion of the many it is the phenomenal world that has to be explained. Cf. 355 Aristotle Met. A 5, g86b3i (DK28A24) . . . dvayKo^nevos 6'

he regarded the cosmology of the Way of Seeming as Parmenides' own;
and that Theophrastus usually took the same view is evident from 357
below. The real value of these two passages is that they emphasize what was evidently the most important characteristic of the Way of Seeming: two constituents (and two only) are named, not one only. Parmenides' predecessors, other than the Pythagoreans and Alcmaeon, had run into difficulties by trying to generate the opposites out of one c3cpxr|.
The foregoing interpretation of the Way of Truth will have
suggested quite a different interpretation of the Way of Seeming.
The essential difference between the objects of reason and the
objects of sense is evidently, to Parmenides, just this: that whereas,
in the case of the objects of reason, acceptance of one of a pair of
354 ... to give an account, in accordance with popular opinion, of the coming into being of sensible things, he makes the first principles two
355 . . .but being forced to comply with sensible things, and supposing the existence of that which is one in formula but more than one according to our sensations, he now posits
two causes and two first principles (After Ross)
280



PARMENIDES
contraries logically involves the rejection of the other, in the case of the objects of sense the acceptance of one involves the accept
ance of the other as well. Light, for instance, can only be seen to
exist in its contrast with darkness; a heavy body cannot be heavy unless there is a lighter body with which to compare it; and so with
all sensible contraries. 1 The fundamental error of which men are
guilty is that they have agreed to recognize the existence of these
sensible opposites; and this is, of course, the error which Par
menides himself must knowingly perpetrate if he is to give an
account of phenomena. Accordingly, even as he perpetrates it he declares it to be an error: 'that 5
, he says (353, fr. 8 1. 54), 'is where they have gone astray'. But at least he will follow misguided mortals no further. If he is to introduce these sensible contraries he will not confuse them with intelligible ; and so, instead of the
primary pair of Pythagorean opposites, Limit and Unlimited (the former of which has been shown in the Way of Truth to be
intelligible), he selects as his own primary pair one of their
perceptible manifestations, 906$ and CTKOTOS (or, as he himself calls
it, vu), 'light' and 'darkness' (or 'night').
1 This consideration seems sufficient to establish Simplicius* interpretation of the clause TCOV piocv oO xpecov ioriv,
' two forms, of which it is not right
to name one only (i.e. without the other) ', as the most convincing. It is true that Cornford's translation,
* of which it is not right to name so much as one* (Plato and Parmenides 46), avoids the obvious difficulty of taking Hiocv in the sense of Wp-qv, and may therefore be right. But if we suppose
Parmenides to mean that, whereas in the Way of Truth it is right to name
one opposite and one only (the other being dcvcbvupiov, 347 1. 17), in the
Way of Seeming you must not name one only without also naming the
other, then we not only give the sentence an additional point, of which the structure of the whole poem seems to show that Parmenides himself was
fully aware, but we also give to the crucial word pfocv the significance which its obvious contrast with Suo seems to suggest.
What Parmenides has in fact done, in passing from the Way of
Truth to the Way of Seeming, is to take his own sphere of reality,
the One, and fill it, quite illegitimately, with the sensible opposites of light and darkness ; and once he has taken that forbidden step, then he can proceed, as had the Pythagoreans with Limit and
Unlimited, to broaden the scope of each of these primary opposites by describing their various manifestations. 1 Light is rare, night
dense, and so on. Once one pair of sensible opposites has been
admitted, then there is no insuperable difficulty in giving an
281



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
explanation of phenomena ; and if only because it avoids the con
fusion between reason and sense, Parmenides' own explanation,
even though deliberately based on error, is at least such that 'no
thought of mortal men shall ever outstrip him' (353, fr. 8 1. 61).

356 And when all things have been named light and night, and things corresponding to their powers have been assigned to each, everything is full of light and of obscure night at once, both equal, since neither has any share of nothingness. 357 The majority ofgeneral views about sensation are two: some make it of like by like,
others of opposite by opposite. Parmenides, Empedocles and Plato say it is of like by like, the followers ofAnaxagoras and ofHeraclitus of opposite by opposite. . . .Parmenides gave no clear definition at all, but said only that there were two elements and that knowledge depends on the excess of one or the other. Thought varies according to whether the hot or the cold prevails, but that which is due to the hot is better and purer; not but what even that needs a certain balance; for, says he, 'According to the mixture that each man has in
his wandering limbs, so thought is forthcoming to mankind; for that which thinks is the same thing, namely the substance of their limbs, in each and all men; for that of
which there is more is thought' for he regards perception and thought as the same. So too memory and forgetfulness arise from these causes, on account of the mixture; but he never

This passage, which sets forth the most influential of the doctrines
that survive from the Way of Seeming, contains two points in
particular that are of interest and importance. It is noteworthy in
the first place how completely Parmenides must, in the Way of Seeming, have suppressed his real convictions: the equation of
perception and thought comes strangely from the author of the Way of Truth. At the same time the whole of this passage again
makes clear how prominent a place was taken in the Way of
Seeming by the sensible oppositcs : if we can trust Theophrastus' interpretation, even thought derives from the preponderance of one opposite in the body over the other. Here once again, as in
the yuxT] ocpnovicc theory of the Pythagoreans (see pp. 261 f.), it is probable that we see the influence of Alcmaeon; but be that as
it may, Parmenides' own theory of the perception of like by like was not without influence on his successors (cf. especially
Empedocles, pp. 343 ff.).

made clear whether, if they are equally mixed) there will be thought or not, or, if so, what its character will be. But that he regards perception as also due to the opposite as such he makes clear when he says that a corpse does not perceive light, heat or sound owing to its
deficiency offire, but that it does perceive their opposites, cold, silence and so on. And he adds that in general everything that exists has some measure of knowledge.
358 The narrower rings were filled with unmixedfire, those next to them with night, and after them rushes their share offlame; and in the midst of them is the goddess who steers
all; for she it is that begins all the works of hateful birth and begetting, sending female to mix with male and male in turn with female.

It is fortunate that, since he neither believed in it himself nor, apparently, succeeded in influencing others by it, Parmenides'
astronomical system is of little importance ; for it is virtually im
possible to reconstruct. These two passages are quoted now chiefly because they give us what little reliable information we possess about the very obscure doctrine, to which reference has already
been made (p. 280), of the crrapAvoci or 'bands'. Two other points of interest do, however, arise from these passages. First, we see yet
again how prominent are the sensible opposites in the cosmology of the Way of Seeming; and in addition to the two familiar pairs in
359, dense and rare, light and darkness, we meet also in 358 with
the new pair another, incidentally, which figures in the Pytha
gorean table male and female. 1 And second, we learn again,
from the fact that Justice or Necessity is now described as the * cause of movement and becoming', how totally irreconcilable are
the two parts of Parmenides' poem (cf. 347 1. 14 and 350 1. 30). We
359 Parmenides said that there were rings wound one around the other, one formed of the rare, the other of the dense; and that there were others between these compounded of light and darkness. That which surrounds them all like a wall is, he says, by nature solid; beneath it is a fiery ring; and likewise what lies in the middle of them all is solid; and around it is again a fiery ring. The middlemost of the mixed rings is the primary cause of movement and of coming into beingfor them all, and he calls it the goddess that steers all,
the holder of the keys, Justice and Necessity. The air, he says, is separated offfrom the earth, vaporized owing to earth 9s stronger compression; the sun is an exhalation offire, and so is the circle of the Milky Way. The moon is compounded of both air andfire. Aither is
outermost, surrounding all; next comes the fiery thing that we call the sky; and last comes the region of the earth.
284



PARMENIDES
should not waste time in the hopeless attempt to reconcile the two
parts. For Parmenides, such inconsistency is inevitably involved in any attempt to explain, what deserves only to be negated, the evidence of the illusory senses.
1 Fr. 1 7, a single line concerned with embryology, 360 Galen in Epid. vi, 48
8e5rrepoT(Tiv \&v KoOpov/s, ACCIOUTI 8 Kovpcc$. . ..
actually links two pairs found in the Pythagorean Table ; but this, in the absence of further evidence, cannot safely be regarded as more than a coincidence. It is also of interest, however, as showing that Parmenides, despite his emphatic theoretical negation of the world of sense, was yet prepared to go into considerable detail in his explanation of it (cf. also
DK 28 A 50-4, especially 52). Presumably any account of the sensible world had at this period, perhaps owing to the influence of Alcmaeon, to take some account of physiological and embryological questions.

CHAPTER XI
ZENO OF ELEA
DATE AND LIFE
The most reliable evidence for Zeno's date is the same passage of Plato's Parmenides as was used (p. 263) to determine the date of
Parmcnides. On the basis of that evidence, Zeno seems to have been born about 490-485 B.C. Once again the date given by
Apollodorus for Zeno's floruit, namely 464-46 i, 1 conflicts with this; but we have already seen that his dating of the Eleatics depends solely on the date of the foundation of Elea. As with
Parmeriides, so with Zeno, Plato's testimony is obviously
preferable.
1 Diog. L. ix, 29 (DKi?9Ai) is unfortunately incomplete, but the date to be restored there is approximately indicated by 3^1 Suda s.v. Zi^vcov
(DK.29A2) ...?iv y&p m Tfjs orj 6Aupi7rioc5os (468-465), naOrj-rns
5evo9ccvous f^ TTocpjjievCSov;. The verdict of Eusebius (DK.29A3) that Zeno's
floruit was in 456-454 B.C., though nearer the mark, is shown to be equally
unreliable by the fact that he makes Heraclitus and Zeno contemporaries.
Of Zeno's life, likewise, we know little more than we have already learnt in connexion with Parmenides. Like Parmenides he came from Elea ; like Parmenides he is said to have been originally
a Pythagorean (340); and like Parmenides he is credited, also
by Strabo in 340, with political activity. As a pupil of Par
menides his name is in fact constantly coupled with that of his
master. In the one context in which his name repeatedly occurs
by itself the story of his part in a plot against a tyrant and of his courage under torture (see DKsgAi, 2, 6, 7, 8 and 9) the details
vary so much that the facts are impossible to reconstruct.

Such passages as 362 cannot admittedly be taken as historical unless they are supported by other evidence. But we shall see later that there are various reasons for accepting the suggestion that the opponents of Parmenides had attempted, in return for his
biting criticisms, to make fun of his One, and we shall see also (pp. 299 ff.) what form these attempts could have taken. There
upon, according to Plato, Zeno set about 'repaying them in the same coin with something to spare'. But be that as it may, there is anyhow no doubt of the controversial nature of Zeno's work: he
fully earns the remarks made about him in 363 and 364. His characteristic method was, as 362 and 363 both suggest, to reduce
his opponents' hypotheses to absurdity by deducing from them
contradictory consequences. The hypotheses to which he especially turned his destructive talents were two, namely plurality and
motion, which were unquestioningly accepted by all except the Eleatics themselves ; but for all that, his arguments were probably,
as we shall see, aimed particularly at the Pythagoreans. His
primary object must indeed have been exactly as Plato represents
consequences follow for his argument. This book is a retort against those who believe in plurality; it pays them back in their own coin9 and with something to spare, by seeking to show that, if anyone examines the matter thoroughly, yet more absurd consequences follow from their hypothesis ofplurality than from that of the One. In such a spirit of contention I wrote it while I was a young man. . . .
363 Do we not then know that this Eleatic Palamedes argues with such skill that the
same things appear to his listeners to be both like and unlike, both one and many, both at rest and in motion?

365 If there is a plurality, things will be both great and small; so great as to be infinite in size, so small as to have no size at all. If what is had no size, it would not even be. For if it were added to something else that
is, it would make it no larger; for being no size at all, it could not, on being added, cause any increase in size. And so what was added would clearly be nothing. Again if, when it is
taken away, the other thing is no smaller, just as when it is added it is not increased, obviously what was added or taken away was nothing. But if it is, each thing must have a certain size and bulk, and one part of it must be a certain distance from another; and the same argument holds about the part in front of it it too will have some size and there will be something infront of it. And it is the same thing
to say this once and to go on saying it indefinitely; for no such part of it will be the last, nor will one part ever be unrelated to another. So, if there is a plurality, things must be both small and great; so small as to have no
size at all, so great as to be infinite.
366 If there is a plurality, things must be just as many as they are, no more and no less.
And if they are just as many as they are, they must be limited.

These two arguments against plurality are all that survive of a set
of, according to Proclus (in Farm. 694, 23, DK.2QA 15), no less than forty. (The first of the two is actually reconstructed from four
separate quotations in Simplicius, Phys. pp. 139-41 (DK29B i and
2) ; but, as Zeller suggested, the four pieces together seem to make up a single argument.) These two probably suffice, however, to
illustrate Zeno's method. A significant feature of these two
arguments (though not necessarily, of course, of all the others) is that both alike admit of two different interpretations. Zeller, for
instance, who is followed by Ross (Aristotle, Physics 479, note on iSyai), paraphrased the latter as follows: 'The many must be both limited and unlimited in number. Limited, because it is as many as it is; no more nor less. Unlimited, because two things are
two only when they are separated; in order that they may be
separated, there must be something between them; and so too between this intermediate and each of the two, and so ad injinitum.
9
H. D. P. Lee, on the other hand, writes of this same dilemma (%eno of Elea 31): 'The second part must again make nonsense
unless it is understood that the "things" in question are supposed
to have the properties of points on a line. And the argument is
simply that between any two points a and al it is possible to take
further points a^ and a3 and so on.' This same divergence of inter
pretation is found also in their respective comments on the
argument in 365 : while Lee's interpretation is again geometrical, Zeller's is again arithmetical.
The reason for this difference of interpretation rests ultimately
in the ambiguity of the hypothesis ei iroAXoc eoriv. In his discussion
of the Pythagoreans whom he believed that Zeno was attacking, Cornford (Plato and Parmenides 58) wrote as follows :
' The assertion
that "things are many" probably covered the following propositions, (i) There is a plurality of concrete things, bodies capable of motion, such as our senses show us. . .. (2) Each of these concrete
bodies is a number, or plurality of units.' The first of these pro
If there is a plurality, the things that are are infinite; for there will always be other things between the things that are, and yet others between those others. And so the things that are are infinite.

These two passages, both based on Eudemus, make it clear that in
his opinion the plurality that Zeno was especially attacking was c a plurality of units', irAf^Oos 6vcc8cov. By exposing the contradictions involved in the notion of the unit Zeno sought to demolish
the hypothesis of plurality. Accordingly it is only when, in the argu
ments preserved in 365 and 366, we substitute for the single word
-rroAAoc,
'
plurality ', the phrase irAfjOos 4vc5c6cov,
' a plurality of units ',
that Zeno's purpose is fully apparent. For not only had Zeno's
principal opponents, the Pythagoreans, maintained that everything
in the universe sun and moon, man and horse, justice and oppor
tunity was indeed a sum of spatially extended units (seepp. 248 ff.) ; they had also, if only tacitly, confused these spatially extended units
with the points of geometry. It is against this confusion in particular that, according to Tannery, Cornford, Lee and others, Zeno's arguments against both plurality and motion are alike directed.
To suppose that this special anti-Pythagorean significance is merely accidental is surely unjust to Zeno; it must indeed, in the opinion of the present writer, have been the prime motive of his
arguments. It may be true, as some scholars have lately objected, that there are no traces in extant fifth-century literature of an
explicit equation of numbers with atoms; and it has also been maintained against Tannery and his followers (though in view of 367 and 368 this seems to be rather a matter of opinion) that, in
W. A. Heidel's words (AJP 61 (1940) 21), 'there is not, so far as I know, a single hint in our sources that the Greeks themselves were aware of the purpose of Zeno to criticize the fundamental doctrines
367 As Eudemus. . .records, eno. . .used to try to prove that it is impossible that
existing things should be a plurality by arguing that there is then no unit in existing things and that plurality is a sum of units.

of the Pythagoreans'. Neither of these objections seems, however, very damaging. If the confusion between units, points and atoms
was, as was suggested in Chapter ix, a tacit confusion arising from
the inability to imagine incorporeal entities, then it is not only
not surprising that there is as yet no explicit equation, it would be
very surprising indeed if there were. And as for the failure of our
sources to point out the special anti-Pythagorean purport of Zeno's arguments, that, so far as it is true, surely comes about because our sources, especially Aristotle himself, were concerned with the validity of the arguments in their own day rather than with the ad hominem motive that inspired them. At the same time,
to suppose that this was their only motive is probably an oversimplification; that the clause ei TroAAA eoriv was not intended to
bear, at least among others, its superficially obvious sense of 6 if there is a plurality of concrete things' seems very hard to believe. The safest conclusion therefore (and this will apply also to the arguments against motion) would seem to be that Zeno did indeed aim his dilemmas especially at the tacit confusions which he
detected in the Pythagorean theory of numbers the Pythagoreans
were in fact 'those who had tried to make fun of the Parmenidean
One '
(362) ; but that, wishing to give them as wide an interest and
applicability as possible, he couched them in the most general terms, and so left his various pluralist opponents to read into them
as much or as little significance as they in fact possessed against
their particular variety of pluralism. Only so, it seems, can we
satisfactorily explain the diversity of interpretation that these arguments have been shown to admit; only so can we account for the remarkable fluctuations of Zeno's repute. Thus Aristotle,
seeing only the general and less valid significance of the antinomies, is content to dismiss them (Met. 84, iooibi4) with the con
temptuous words, OV/TOS Oscopei 9OpTiKco$, 'his speculations are crude'. Modern scholars and philosophers on the other hand,
appreciating the full purport of these same arguments, have accorded to Zeno the greatest respect.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Zeno's arguments against motion, unlike those against plurality, were originally only four in number, of which Aristotle discusses
each in turn (though in a somewhat garbled version) in Physics Zg. It will be best to discuss each separately; but since the four were
undoubtedly intended to stand together, the full purpose of each being dependent on the other three, we must first consider the combined object of the four together. Theories of motion depend inevitably on theories of the nature of space and time ; and two opposed views of space and time were
held in antiquity. Either space and time are infinitely divisible, in which case motion is continuous and smooth-flowing; or else they are made up of indivisible minima aTojjia |aey0r| in which
case motion is what Lee aptly calls 'cinematographic', consisting
of a succession of minute jerks. We shall find that Zeno's arguments are directed against both theories the first two arguments against
the former view, the last two against the latter. The four argu
ments are really, in fact, two pairs; and further, to complete the neatness of the pattern, the first member of each pair aims to prove
that motion is impossible for a single body that is to say, is
impossible absolutely while the second aims to prove that it is
impossible for more than one body that is to say, relatively. Finally, it is once more against the Pythagoreans in particular that these four arguments together are most valid and damaging ; for it
was the Pythagoreans alone who, by their confusion of spatially extended and indivisible units with the points of geometry, would
be logically compelled to admit, under cross-examination, that
they held simultaneously the two contradictory theories of space and motion.

Zeno's first argument amounts simply to this: 'It is impossible to traverse the stadium; because before you reach the far end you
must first reach the half-way point; before you reach the half-way point you must reach the point half way to it; and so on ad
infinitum.
9 In other words, on the assumption that space is infinitely divisible and that therefore any finite distance contains
an infinite number of points, it is impossible to reach the end of an
infinite series in a finite time. Aristotle's answer to this conundrum
in 372, even if philosophically unsatisfactory, 1 shows that in this case he has rightly understood the problem.
1 On the philosophical aspect of this and the other arguments against motion see Ross, Aristotle, Physics 71-85. Ross himself concludes about this
first argument : (i) that since Aristotle himself, from whom almost the whole of our knowledge of all four arguments derives, evidently regards the solution he gives in 372 as * an adequate argumentum ad hominem as against Zeno', Zeno must therefore have 'made the paradox turn on a contrast
between the infinite number of divisions of space to be covered in covering a finite space, and the finitude of a particular portion of time* (p. 73); (ii) that none the less ' the fact apparently remains that, before it gets to the end of the line, the moving body will have had to get to the end of an infinite series, i.e. to have got to the end of something that has no end* (p. 74), and that so understood 'Zeno's first paradox still awaits its final
answer* (p. 75). See also the controversy in Analysis vols. n (1951) to 15 (1954), which however is hardly relevant to Zeno's intentions.
372 Hence %mo 9s argument makes a false assumption in asserting that it is impossible for a thing to pass over or severally come in contact with infinite things in a finite time. For there are two senses in which length and time and generally anything continuous are
called 'infinite': they are called so either in respect of divisibility or in respect of their extremities. So while a thing in a finite time cannot come in contact with things quanti
tatively infinite, it can come in contact with things infinite in respect of divisibility: for in this sense the time itself is also infinite: and so wefind that the time occupied by the passage over the infinite is not a finite but an infinite time, and the contact with the infinites is made by means of moments not finite but infinite in number.

Having in 'the Stadium' dealt with a single moving body, Zeno proceeds in ' Achilles ' to deal with the relative motion of two bodies. The argument this time is as follows: 'Achilles can never overtake a tortoise; because by the time he reaches the point from which the
tortoise started, it will have moved on to another point; by the time he reaches that second point it will have moved on again; and
so ad infinitum.
9 Aristotle's comment on this conundrum is again
sensible as far as it goes : the underlying theory of space is indeed the same as in 'the Stadium' namely that it is infinitely divisible
but this time the series is not, as it was in 'the Stadium', the
simple geometrical progression |, J, |, ^ ..., but somewhat more
complicated. That concludes Zeno's attempt to disprove 'continuous'
motion, and he now proceeds to 'cinematographic' motion.

This third argument can be confidently reconstructed as follows :

373 The second is the so-called Achilles, and it amounts to this, that in a race the quickest runner can never overtake the slowest, since the pursuer must first reach the point whence the pursued started, so that the slower must always hold a lead. This argument is
the same in principle as that which depends on bisection, though it differs from it in that the spaces with which we successively have to deal are not divided into halves. (Trans. Gaye)
374 The third is that already given above, to the effect that the flying arrow is at rest, which result follows from the assumption that time is composed of moments: if this

375 The fourth argument is that concerning the two rows of bodies, each row being composed of an equal number of bodies of equal size, passing each other on a race-course
as they proceed with equal velocity in opposite directions, the one row originally occupying the space between the goal and the middle point of the course and the other that between the
middle point and the starting-post. This, he thinks, involves the conclusion that half a given time is equal to double that time. The fallacy of the reasoning lies in the assumption that
a body occupies an equal time in passing with equal velocity a body that is in motion and a body of equal size that is at rest; which is false. For instance (so runs the argument), let
A, A ... be the stationary bodies of equal size, B, B ... the bodies, equal in number and in size to A, A, ..., originally occupying the half of the course from the starting-post to the middle of the A'J, and f, f . . . those originally occupying the other halffrom the goal to the middle of the Ks, equal in number, size, and velocity to B, B .... Then three consequences follow: First, as the B's and the PJ pass one another, the first B reaches the last F at the same moment as the first f reaches the last B. Secondly, at this moment the first F has
passed all the B's, whereas the first B has passed only half {the A'^>, and has consequently occupied only half the time occupied by the first F, since each of the two occupies an equal time in passing each body. Thirdly, at the same moment all the B's have passed all the TV: for the first f and the first B will simultaneously reach the opposite ends of the course, since (so says ^eno] the time occupied by the first F in passing each of

This final argument is much the most complicated of the four and it is virtually certain that Aristotle himself has misunderstood it; Zeno was far too shrewd to have been guilty of the paralogism of which Aristotle accuses him. The clue to the true significance of the argument lies in its relation to the other three: as 'Achilles' stands to 'the Stadium 5
, so will this conundrum stand to the
'Flying Arrow'. In other words, this argument too will be based
on the assumption that space and time are composed of indivisible minima. Indeed the only way in which any sense can be made of the
argument is to suppose and by so supposing it becomes perhaps the most telling of the whole set that each of Zeno's oyxoi (a
deliberately vague word meaning 'solid bodies' or 'masses')
represents one such indivisible minimum of space, and that those
in the rows B and P are alike moving at such a speed as to pass one
A in one indivisible minimum of time. Zeno is of course fully
justified in asking his opponents or those of them at least who believed in indivisible minima to visualize such a situation. If
space does indeed consist of indivisible minima, then it is clearly
legitimate to draw a diagram to represent, on however magnified a scale, a number of such minima; and if the same is true of time, then the rest of the data is equally legitimate. But once so much
is granted, then the rest of the argument is valid. For while each
B has passed two A's which, by the data, means in two indivisible
the B'j is equal to that occupied by it in passing each of the AV, because an equal time is
occupied by both the first B and the first f in passing all the AV. (After Gaye)

f= bodies moving from E towards A.

minima of time each f has passed four B's which again by the data must have taken four indivisible minima. It is true, of course, that unless the argument is concerned with indivisible minima it
is, as Aristotle says, totally invalid. But as soon as it is seen to be
concerned with indivisible minima, both of space and time, then it does most ingeniously demonstrate that these so-called indivisible
minima are divisible after all. And upon the unfortunate Pytha
goreans, who had hitherto confused the indivisible units of
arithmetic with the points in infinitely divisible geometrical
magnitudes, this last argument must finally have impressed the urgent need for revision of their suppositions. 1

point made several times already (see especially pp. i88f. and 246 ff.) that the Prcsocratics could imagine no form of existence other than spatial.
377 Zend's problem that 'if Place is something, it must be in something* is not difficult to solve. (Trans. Hardie)
378 Reno's difficulty demands an explanation: for if everything that exists has a place> place too will have a place, and so on ad infinitum. (Trans. Hardie)

These two passages tell us virtually all we know of the life of Melissus. The battle in which he defeated the Athenian fleet was
fought in 441/40 B.C., and it is probably for that reason that
Apollodorus fixed his floruit at 444-441. Whether or not he was, as Diogenes tells us, a pupil of Parmenides, he certainly followed
379 Melissus son oflthagenes, a Samian. He was a pupil of Parmenides He was a statesman, and was held in great honour by the citizens; and later, when he was elected
admiral, he won even greater fame for his personal courage. . . .Apollodorus says that he flourished in the eighty-fourth Olympiad.
380 For when Pericles had set sail, Melissus, son of Ithagenes, a philosopher who was then in command ofSamos, was so contemptuous of the small number of the Athenian ships
or of their commanders' inexperience that he persuaded the Samians to attack. A battle
took place which the Samians won. They took so many prisoners and destroyed so many ships that they had command of the sea, and they devoted to the prosecution of the war certain
supplies which they did not till then possess. Pericles himself, according to Aristotle, had also been defeated by Melissus in an earlier naval battle.

him very closely. We shall see reason to suppose that he was also
acquainted with contemporary Pythagoreanism. Melissus' book is said by Simplicius (Phys. 70, 16, DK.3OA4), to
whom we owe the preservation of the ten surviving fragments, to have been entitled Hepl 9uaeco$ f| Trepl TOU OVTO$, 'About nature or
reality' a version of the title regularly given by later com
mentators to books by the Presocratics. Its date is impossible to
determine; but if we are to trust Plato that Zeno wrote his treatise
as a young man (see 362), then it is at least highly probable that
Melissus' book is considerably the later of the two. We shall find that there is internal evidence also to the same effect.

381 Since, then, it did not come into being, it is now, always was and always will be, without either beginning or end, but infinite. For if it had come into being, it would have a beginning (for it would at some time have begun coming into being) and an end (for it would at some time have stopped coming into being); but since it neither began nor ended,
it always was and always shall be, without either beginning or end; for it is not possible for anything to exist for ever unless it all exists.
382 But just as it exists for ever, so too it must for ever be infinite in magnitude.
383 Nothing that has a beginning and an end is either eternal or infinite.
384 If it were not one, it would be bounded by something else.
385 For if it were {infinite), it would be one; for if it were two, the two could not be infinite, but would be limited by one another.
299



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Faithfully as he followed Parmenides in other respects, Melissus
yet broke away from him, as these fragments amply show, on one
very important point. Whereas the One of Parmenides was finite
and spherical (see 350 and 351), the One of Melissus is unequivocally declared, to the irritation of Aristotle, 1 to be infinite in extent2 as well as in time. For this remarkable change there seem to have been two main reasons, of which we will consider the
simpler first. Melissus himself tells us, in 384 and 385, that if there were more than one Being, they would be bounded by one
another. He argues for the unity of the One, in other words, from
its infinity. But that his real object was rather to prove its infinity
from its unity is obvious enough even in these fragments, and is
even more apparent from the following summary description of the Eleatics:
386 Aristotle de gen. et con. A8, 325ai4 (DK3OA8) v ml
ocKivrjTov TO Tray elvod 9aai Kod ooTEtpov evioi * T6 yocp nipccs irepouveiv &V TTp6? TO K6VOV.
Melissus is in fact countering the possible objection to the Sphere of Parmenides that, if it is indeed 'limited on every side', then
something must surely lie outside its limits, and that something can only be the void.
1 Aristotle had a profound but unjust contempt for Melissus whom he dismisses with such words as 9opTiK6$ ' crude '
(Phys. A 3, 1 85 a i o, DK 30 A 7)
or piKp6v <5cypoiK6TEpos 'a little too naive* (Met. AS, 986 b 26, DK ibid.). a This has lately been denied by G. Vlastos (Gnomon 25 (1953) 34), who,
having argued on the strength of fr. 9 (391 below) that the One of
Melissus is incorporeal, writes: 'How then could Melissus affirm that Being is incorporeal while infinite in magnitude? Because, I suggest, the infinity in question is that of beginningless and endless duration, not that of unlimited spatial extension.' I find it incredible that, if this was what Melissus wished to say, he should have included the words T6 nye0os in
382 or written OUTS dfStov OUTS crrmpov in 383. The only answer to
Vlastos' question seems to me to be to suppose that Melissus still thought that the only kind of existence was existence in space; see below, pp. 303 f.
His second motive for the change is also discernible in the
fragments, this time in 381 and 383. The One must have neither beginning nor end. There has been a prolonged discussion con
cerning 381 as to whether it signifies a temporal or a spatial
386 They say that the universe is one and motionless, and some add that it is infinite; for its limit would limit it against the void.

MELISSUS
beginning and end ; but since the next two fragments make it clear
that Melissus denied both, the question is relatively unimportant. There can in any case be no doubt that Melissus is once again
improving upon Parmenides' description of his Sphere as c limited on every side ' and '
equally poised from the centre in every direction 5
. The objection that he is this time countering seems, there
fore, to be this : if, as Parmenides' own language suggests, the One
has a beginning, a middle and an end, then surely it is no longer one but three.
There is some ground for the conjecture that these two possible
objections to the One of Parmenides had actually been raised.
Besides Plato's reference in the Parmenides to 'those who try to make fun of Parmenides' One by showing its many absurd and
contradictory consequences' (see 362) words which themselves suggest destructive arguments of exactly this type there are two passages from Aristotle which point in the same direction :

It is not, unfortunately, clear from 387 just how much Aristotle intends to ascribe to Xuthus; but even if it is only the fantastic view that when there is motion 'the universe bulges', it still seems
likely enough that the motive underlying the suggestion was
nothing but the desire to make fun of Parmenides' Sphere. We are
told by Simplicius, in his comment on this passage (683, 24, DK33), that Xuthus was, as we should hope, a Pythagorean. It
387 There are some who think that the existence of rarity and density shows that there is a void. If rarity and density do not exist, they say, neither can things contract and be compressed. But if this were not to take place, either there would be no movement at all, or the universe would bulge, as Xuthus said. (Trans. Hardie)
388 For, as the Pythagoreans say, the world and all that is in it is determined by the number three, since beginning and middle and end give the number of the world, and the
number they give is the triad. (After Stocks)
301



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
may possibly have been in answer to Xuthus, or at any rate to the
argument that outside Parmenides5 One must be the void, that
Zeno, following his usual practice of reducing his opponents' hypotheses to absurdity, included among his arguments one that was directed against the notion of TOTTOS, 'space' (see p. 297) .*
When, finally, we learn that the theory in 388 was held by, among
others,* Ion of Chios, whose first tragedy is said in the Suda (s.v.
"Icov Xlo$, DK3&A3) to have been produced in 452-449 B.C., and who, according to Harpocration (s.v. "Icov, DK.36AI), was uios
'Op6o|Jivovs, hriKATicjiv 6e louOou, 'son of Orthomenes, who was known as Xuthus',3 we have perhaps enough evidence to justify a tentative conclusion. Melissus' solitary departure from the guidance of Parmenides may well have been forced upon him by the criticisms of the Pythagoreans.
1 Space and the void are very closely associated in Greek thought. The
precise relation between the two is actually defined in 389 Aristotle Phys.

2 The same view was evidently held also by the Pythagorean Occelus
(DK 48, 8), who seems, however, so far as we can judge from our very
unreliable information, to have belonged to a later generation of the school.
3 It may well be true, as Kranz suggests in his note at DKi, 377, that the
father of Ion was nicknamed Xuthus in allusion to the myth that provided Euripides with the plot for his tragedy. But that does not alter the fact
that Xuthus is mentioned under that name by Aristotle himself.

389 Again, the theory that the void exists involves the existence ofplace: for one would
define void as space bereft of body. (After Hardie) 390 (He said that) the whole is eternal. . .and homogeneous, and has no space within it.
391 For he made it clear that he means that what exists is incorporeal when he wrote: 'If Being is, it must be one; and being one, it must have no body. If it were to have bulk, it would have parts and be no longer one. 9
302



MELISSUS
Simplicius, who was no fool and who evidently had the book of
Melissus before him as he wrote, actually quotes this fragment in
two pieces on two separate occasions (the other being Pkys. 87, 6), with the object on each occasion of showing that the Eleatic One was incorporeal. Yet in spite of this fact, which alone would seem
decisive enough, Burnet (67*327), following the second thoughts
of Zeller, regards the statement that the One of Melissus was
incorporeal as 'incredible', and argues instead that the fragment must have been 'directed against the Pythagorean assumption of ultimate units'. None of the arguments by which he supports his
contention carry, however, the slightest weight, not even the
alleged similarity between this fragment of Melissus and fragment i of Zeno (365) . For whereas there is no mention in any of Zeno's
fragments of the Eleatic but only of the Pythagorean (or at any rate the pluralists') One, the exact reverse is true of Melissus. This
is in no way surprising. It was Zeno's characteristic method (see
pp. 287 f.) to base his essentially destructive arguments upon the suppositions of his opponents. Melissus by contrast was essentially constructive and only incidentally critical. Moreover and this is a very important point the constructive and destructive
approaches are, as this very fragment reveals, by no means easy to reconcile. If, indeed, the argument of the fragment is inter
preted as an attack upon the Pythagorean unit-atoms, it succeeds in demolishing the Pythagorean 'plurality of ones 3
(irAfjOos voc5cov, cf. 367) only at the expense of the Eleatic One. The same
is, of course, true also of Zeno's arguments against plurality; but since Zeno's purpose was primarily to demolish the system of his
opponents, it is open to doubt whether, even if he was aware of this fact, he would have allowed it to deter him. With Melissus, whose object was to vindicate the Eleatic One, the case is altogether
different. If anything that possesses aco^a and TTCCXOS, 'body' and
'bulk', must thereby possess also laopioc, 'parts', and so sacrifice its unity, then the only way to preserve the unity of the Eleatic
One is obviously to deny it these attributes. This fact is so evident
that Melissus, with his constructive intent and the consequent
desire to anticipate objections, can hardly have failed to observe
it. It has already been suggested (pp. 300 f.) that it was partly to avoid a form of this argument that Melissus explicitly stated that
his One was infinite, without spatial beginning or end. The further suggestion seems to follow that, on this question of the
303



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
corporeality of the One, Melissus marks another parallel advance from the position of Parmenides. Parmenides, though he described
his One as indivisible and homogeneous, had yet conveyed the
distinct impression, in so describing it, that it possessed parts. The
Pythagoreans pounced upon this oversight and based upon it one
of their 'attempts to make fun of the One' (362). Zeno in turn
answered the Pythagoreans, using their own type of argument to refute them. Here, as elsewhere, it seems to have been left to Melissus to adapt the positive aspect of Eleaticism in the light of
the purely negative disputes of his immediate predecessors. The obvious, if not indeed the inevitable, adaptation would seem to be embodied in this fragment. Another step has been taken towards
the apprehension of the abstract; but it is still only a step in that direction, not the eventual arrival at the goal. It is admittedly
difficult for us to imagine anything except empty space which is at once infinite in extent and yet has no 'body' or c bulk'; and even empty space can be imagined to have, what Melissus' One did not
have, 'parts'. But Melissus' own words allow no escape from the conclusion that that was the way his mind was working. If he had
been capable of imagining something that was not only incorporeal but non-spatial as well, the outcome of his thought would have been different; but the only safe deduction to be drawn from the
surviving fragments of his book, which must always remain the
best guide to his meaning, 1 is that he was not capable. And since
neither of his approximate contemporaries, Empedocles and Anaxagoras, was any more successful in this respect than he was,
that conclusion is perhaps less startling than it might otherwise be.
1 The pseudo-Aristotelian treatise de Melissa Xenophane Gorgia (MXG), written about the time of Christ, tells us virtually nothing about Melissus' doctrine that we do not learn direct from the fragments. Its author's purpose, moreover, is so critical that its reliability is doubtful.

This skilful attack upon the validity of the senses may well be,
as Burnet suggests (EGP%28), directed especially against Anaxagoras; in which case, of course, it too, as well as the possible
if one thing is living and another dead, and if things are black and white and all that men say they really are if that is so, and if we see and hear aright, each one of these must be
such as we first decided, and they cannot be changed or altered, but each must be always just as it is. But, as it is, we say that we see and hear and understand aright, and yet we believe that what is warm becomes cold, and what is cold warm; that what is hard turns soft, and what is soft hard; that what is living dies, and that things are born from what lives not; and that all those things are changed, and that what they were and what they are now are
in no way alike. We think that iron, which is hard, is rubbed away by contact with the finger; and so with gold and stone and everything which we fancy to be strong, and that earth and stone are made out of water; so that it turns out that we neither see nor know
realities. Now these things do not agree with one another. We said that there were many things that were eternal and had forms and strength of their own, and yet we fancy that
they all suffer alteration, and that they changefrom what we see each time. It is clear, then, that we did not see aright after all, nor are we right in believing that all these things are many. They would not change if they were real, but each thing would be just what we believed it to be; for nothing is stronger than true reality. But if it has changed, what is has passed away and what is not has come into being. So then, if there were a plurality, things would have to be ofjust the same nature as the one. (After Burnet)

rejoinder to Ion of Chios in 381 and 383, is evidence for dating the
work of Melissus relatively late. Its prime importance lies, however, at the beginning and the end. There can be little question, as we shall see when we come to Leucippus (pp. 4043*.), that Melissus' reiterated assertion, 'if there were a plurality, each one of the many would have to be just such as I say the One is' an assertion
that was intended, of course, as a reductio adabsurdum of plurality provided the atomists with the basis of their entire system. Greek atomism is precisely a plurality in which each one of the many is, in almost every essential respect, just such as Melissus said that the One was.

These three passages, being consistent one with another, provide the best evidence available for dating Philolaus. 1 If we accept the
further statement of Apollodorus (ap. Diog. L. ix, 41, 549) that
Democritus was born about 460-457 B.C., then we can take it that Philolaus too was born somewhere around the middle of
the fifth century, and was about fifty years of age when he was
lecturing in Thebes. His name is repeatedly linked, as it is in 395,
with that of Eurytus. In dealing with these two at this point we
are, therefore, deserting a strictly chronological order; there is no question that they were both considerably later than either
Empedocles or Anaxagoras. There is, however, one fact of considerable importance about each which it will be more convenient to discuss before we leave the subject of the interaction
between Pythagoreans and Eleatics and proceed to the post
Parmenidean pluralists. 1 The statement of lamblichus (V.P. 104) that Philolaus and Eurytus were pupils of Pythagoras in his old age is obviously absurd. Both are usually associated with Groton, but sometimes with Tarentum (as in 395) or Metapontium.
393 / heard Philolaus lecture when he lived in our town [i.e. Thebes].
394 Apollodorus of Cyzicus, too, says that Democritus and Philolaus were contemporaries. 395 For the last of the Pythagoreans, whom Aristoxenus saw, were Xenophilus the Chalcidian from Thrace, and Phanton, Echecrates, Diodes and Polymnastos, all of Phleious. They were pupils of Philolaus and Eurytus, the Tarentines.

This curious story, of which this passage shows that there were several variant versions (cf. 266), seems likely to have originated with Aristoxenus. It was certainly Aristoxenus who, in his desire to detract from Plato's originality, asserted that the Republic was
largely based on a work of Protagoras; and this is clearly a story of the same malicious order. Its historical importance is of course
negligible, but it serves to raise the important question of the authenticity of the fragments still preserved in Philolaus' name.
The fragments of
' Philolaus '
More than twenty fragments are attributed to Philolaus, some
of considerable length. If they are genuine, they undoubtedly constitute much the best evidence that we possess concerning the
Pythagoreanism of the fifth century. Unfortunately, opinion seems still to be divided on the question of their authenticity. Though much has been written both for and against them, all the
more important arguments are conveniently to be found in the works of three scholars only. Ingram Bywater (J. Philol. i, 21-53),
who played a large part in originally subjecting the fragments to
suspicion, and Erich Frank (Plato und die sogenannten Pythagoreer 263-335) between them set out the whole case against the frag
396 Philolaus ofCroton, a Pythagorean. It was from him that Plato, in a letter, told
Dion to buy the Pythagorean books. . . . He wrote one book. (Hermippus says that
according to one writer the philosopher Plato went to Sicily, to the court of Dionysius, bought this book from Philolaus 9 relativesfor 40 Alexandrian(\) minae, andfrom it copied out the Timaeus. Others say that Plato acquired the books by securingfrom Dionysius the release from prison of a young man who had been one of Philolaus 9
pupils.)

ments, while R. Mondolfo (Zeller-Mondolfo i, 2, 367-82) is the
chief advocate for the defence. On the whole the argument must
be pronounced so far to have gone in favour of the prosecution :
Mondolfo, even if he has succeeded in producing an explanation or a precedent for every single suspicious feature, has hardly succeeded in explaining away what might be thought the strongest of all arguments against the fragments, the unduly large number of such suspicious or unusual features. It is impossible in the
present context to recapitulate all the detailed arguments already
adduced by either party. One general argument must suffice.
A careful reading of the fragments reveals in them a notable
resemblance to Aristotle's extant accounts of Pythagoreanism.
The most striking example is probably that afforded by the following comparison :

1 The fact that the fragments are in Doric has been used as an argument both for and against them.
There are several other such resemblances, 1 sufficient to establish
at least a strong probability that Aristotle's account of Pythagoreanism and that given by the author of the fragments are inter
dependent. If, therefore, it can be shown that the author of the
fragments was dependent upon Aristotle rather than vice versa,
then the case against the fragments is virtually conclusive.
397 Number has two special forms, odd and even, and a third derivedfrom the mixture of these two, even-odd. Each form has many manifestations, which every individual thing reveals in its own nature.
398 The elements of number (they say) are the even and the odd. . .the i proceeds from both of these (for it is both even and odd) .... Other members of this same school say
there are ten principles, which they arrange in two columns ofcognates limit and unlimited, odd and even ....

Met. AS, 98ya 13-19 (DK^SBS); fr. 2 with de caelo Ay, 274aso~3 and Phys. P4, 203a 10-15 (DK 58328); and fr. 7 with Met. NS, 1091 a 15
(DK 58326) and de caelo 613, 293a2i (DK 58337).
There are three considerations that point firmly in that
direction: (j) It is to be noted that Aristotle mentions Philolaus by name
only once in his extant writings (at Eth. Eud. B8, 1225 a 33, DK44Bi6), and he there tells us nothing of the slightest import
ance. That, if Aristotle actually derived much of his information about Pythagorean doctrine from Philolaus' book, is an almost inconceivable state of affairs. (2) One of the minor resemblances between the two authors'
phraseology is of a very suspicious nature. In the middle of fragment 6 occurs the following sentence:
399 Fr. 63 Stobaeus Anth. i, 2 1 , 7 d ... eirel 8e Tod ocpxocl v-rrapxov

It is surprising enough in itself to find the author of the fragments
expressing, in the last four words, perplexity about what seems to have been the most important constituent in his whole cosmo
logy. It becomes more surprising still when we find Aristotle, in 313, voicing an almost identical doubt. For even if Aristotle is
here faithfully reproducing an obscurity or omission in the early Pythagorean cosmogony, it would be difficult to maintain that
once that vital omission had been consciously acknowledged, as it evidently was by the author of these fragments, it would have
been left unrepaired.
(3) If, finally, we look at fragments 3, 4, 6 and especially 1 1, we find that they are all concerned with a theory of knowledge. It
will suffice to quote one only:

399 . . . But since the first principles were not by nature alike or akin, it would be
impossible for them ever to have been arranged, had not harmony supervened, in whatever way it came into being.
400 And all things that can be known contain number; without this nothing could be thought or known.
310



PHILOLAUS AND EURYTUS
This theory is in itself regarded by both Bywater and Frank
though their contention is disputed by Mondolfo as a palpable
anachronism. 'We are required', wrote Bywater (loc. cit. p. 35), ' to believe it to have been propounded in a pre-Socratic school of
thought, and at a time when the critical enquiry "How is know
ledge possible?" had barely been started, much less settled. But after Plato's time the unknowableness of matter without form
(OAr| oyvcooros Kccd* auTfjv, says Aristotle) became with various modifications a received formula wherever his influence extended.'
It is, however, only when this argument is combined with that other of the resemblance between Aristotle and the author of the
fragments that it acquires its full force. For in Aristotle's accounts of Pythagoreanism, though there is abundant evidence of the
cosmological significance of numbers, there is nowhere the faintest suggestion that among their other functions they are the only cause of knowledge. This once again, seeing that Aristotle often
discusses Pythagoreanism for the express purpose of enquiring what early traces he can find of his own doctrines, seems an almost inconceivable omission. Moreover he consistently repre
sents the Pythagoreans as concerned only with physical phenomena, with never a mention of such an epistemology as that of the
fragments. Finally, the argument that the existence of knowledge
implies the existence of stable realities is always represented by
Aristotle (e.g. at Met. A 9, ggobn) as peculiarly Platonic, resulting from the blending of Pythagoreanism with Heracliteanism
(cf. ibid. A 6, 987 a 29) ; yet it may fairly be claimed that fragments 4, 5 and especially 6 reveal a familiarity with that argument. Irrespective, therefore, of Bywater's contention that the epistemology of the fragments is anachronistic (which, even if not by itself
conclusive, can hardly be dismissed as entirely groundless), it seems virtually certain, from Aristotle's complete silence on the
subject, that that epistemology was not in fact part of the prePlatonic Pythagoreanism. For these and other reasons the fragments attributed to Philolaus
can be dismissed, with regret but little hesitation, as part of a
post-Aristotelian forgery, based, not without skill, on Aristotle's own accounts of the Pythagorean system.

Other evidence concerning Philolaus
Whereas there is abundant information concerning Philolaus in
the works of several late writers, there is scarcely so much as a mention of him in any early and reliable author. Plato and Aristotle each mention him once only, in the passages already cited (see 393 and p. 310), and from neither of these passages do we learn anything of importance about his doctrine. Otherwise there are only two sources of information that are at all reliable :
namely, first, a quotation in the Theologumena Arithmeticae (p. 82, 10 de Falco; DK44AI3) from a lost work by Speusippus On
Pythagorean Numbers, which was largely based, we are told, on the writings of Philolaus; and second, a passage from Mcno's latrica in the so-called Anonymus Londinensis. The former tells us something
of the properties of the Dccad, and so suggests that in regard to numbers Philolaus was faithful to the Pythagorean tradition. The latter, which describes the fundamental principles of his medical
and physiological theories, is so interesting that a considerable part of it is worth quoting.

401 Philolaus of Croton holds that our bodies are composed of the hot; for they have no share in the cold, as he reasonsfrom considerations such as thefollowing: the sperm is warm,
and it is the sperm that produces the living thing; and the place in which it is deposited (i.e. the womb) is, like it, warm; and what is like something has the same power as that which it resembles. Since, then, the productivefactor has no share in the cold, and also the
place in which it is deposited has no share in the cold, clearly the living thing produced will also be of the same nature. With regard to its production, he makes use of the following
reasoning: immediately after its birth the living thing draws in the breath outside, which is cold; and then, as if of necessity, it expels it again. This desirefor the breath outside arises

Then follow a number of detailed doctrines which, in the present
context, are of importance only as showing that Philolaus had something more than a merely conventional interest in medical
and physiological matters. The significance of the passage quoted is that it shows a remarkable similarity, both in the general picture it draws and
also, in the last three sentences, in vocabulary, to the passages quoted in chapter ix which describe the beginning of the Pythagorean cosmogony, 312, 315, and 316. Just as the sperm, which is warm, is deposited in the womb, so also, in cosmogony, the first unit, which represents the principle of Limit, is somehow implanted in the midst of the surrounding Unlimited; and just as the child, immediately after birth, inhales the breath outside, so also the first
unit, immediately after it is generated, proceeds to draw in the void from the surrounding Unlimited. There are of course dis
crepancies between the cosmogonical and the biological processes :
whereas, for instance, Philolaus insists that the womb itself, like the sperm deposited in it, is warm, the Unlimited in which the
first unit is implanted represents darkness, while Limit, and the
first unit likewise, stand for light. But the general similarity between the two pictures is perhaps sufficient to suggest that
Philolaus is at this point maintaining an analogy between the macrocosm and the microcosm; and in that case, whichever of the
two was originally the model for the other, his embryological
theories may perhaps provide some support for a particularly conjectural stage in the reconstruction of the Pythagorean cosmo
logy in chapter ix.
(2) EURYTUS AND HIS PEBBLES
Slight as is our reliable information about Philolaus, about his
associate Eurytus we know even less. We have, however, one solitary piece of information about him which is at once unusually
well attested and, despite its superficial triviality, probably of considerable importance.
in order that, as the result of the inhalation of the breath, our bodies, which are by nature too warm, may be cooled by it.

The statement in 404 that the information concerning this
curious practice of Eurytus comes from Archytas is a strong indication of its accuracy : no more trustworthy witness could be
found on this generation of Pythagoreans. The only question, therefore, is what Eurytus was attempting to prove with his pebbles.
402 Once more, it has in no sense been determined in which way numbers are the causes
of substances and of being whether (i) as limits (as points are of spatial magnitudes) : this is how Eurytus decided what was the number of what (e.g. of man, or of horse), viz.
by imitating the figures of living things with pebbles, as some people bring numbers into the forms of triangle and square; or (2) is it because harmony is a ratio of numbers. . .?
(Trans. Ross) 403 For the sake of argument let the definition of man be the number 250 and that of plant 360. Having settled that, he used to take 250 pebbles, some green, some black, others red and, in short, of a variety of colours. Then he would smear the wall with unslaked lime and make a shaded drawing of a man or a plant; some pebbles he fixed in the drawing of the face, others in the hands, and others elsewhere, until he had completed the drawing of a man in the number ofpebbles equal to the number of units which he claimed to define man.
404 For this (sc. not stopping half-way) is the mark of the really sensible man; just as, for instance, Archytas once said that Eurytus used to do when he distributed his pebbles; for he apparently used to claim that such and such was the number of man, such and such that of horse, and such and such that of anything else.



PHILOLAUS AND EURYTUS
It is usually assumed that, retaining the early Pythagoreans' confusion between units and atoms, he claimed, by drawing these pictures with pebbles, to determine the number of unit-atoms that
constituted the objects, such as man and horse, which he represented. But for a variety of reasons that seems a very improbable
explanation of his procedure. Eurytus, being one of the foremost Pythagoreans of his generation, is surely unlikely to have altogether ignored Zeno's devastating exposure of the earlier Pythagoreans' confusion. Again, it seems scarcely credible that he should have believed in unit-atoms of such a magnitude that their
number in such an object as man or horse could be so easily
determined, especially by means of a drawing in only two dimen
sions. And finally, as we learn from 403, he had in any case
already decided upon the appropriate number before he began to
delineate the object in question. There is every reason to suppose
that his purpose was somewhat less ingenuous than this explanation
suggests.
A more plausible explanation would seem to be as follows.
Eurytus might well have held that it was possible with his pebbles
so to delineate the external form of a man or a horse that the
resulting figure could represent nothing but a man or a horse. That is to say, he would mark off the surfaces that were peculiarly
those of a man or a horse, and the points that bounded those
surfaces, and then, by counting the number of points needed to
represent a man so that it could be nothing but a man, consider
that he had corroborated the equation of man with a particular
number. This is exactly the method that 403 suggests. He started,
according to that account of his procedure, with a aKiccypcc9{cc that is to say, probably (though the word is occasionally used to mean only an outline drawing), a drawing shaded to give the
illusion of solidity. He was probably in fact thinking in three dimensions, not two only. The boundary points of a threedimensional object could hardly be represented by a threedimensional arrangement of pebbles, simply because of the mechanical difficulties involved ; but by means of a shaded drawing
they could be represented by an arrangement of pebbles on a twodimensional surface. Further, if the pebbles used were of different
colours, as 403 again tells us that they were, the arrangement of pebbles would appear no longer a merely arbitrary scattering but an intelligible representation.
315



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
In strong support of this suggestion is the reason for which
Aristotle tells us in 402 that Eurytus developed this practice. The doctrine that lies behind the words olov at ariyiJiat TCOV neyeOcov, 'as points define magnitudes', is referred to in several other
passages of Aristotle, and even if not explicitly, at least by a process
of elimination, attributed to the Pythagoreans. One such passage
has already been quoted, 320; this time we will select others:

If, as is generally supposed, Alexander is right in telling us that the anonymous thinkers in 406 were Pythagoreans, then it would appear that, besides the earlier doctrine that the line equals 2 because two extended points placed side by side constitute a line, there was also another and subtler Pythagorean view by which a line was a stretch of continuous magnitude bounded by two points. It seems likely that this is a post-Zenonian revision of the traditional
view, in which case it may reasonably be ascribed to the generation
of Philolaus and Eurytus. And in that case again the procedure
of Eurytus begins to look less absurd. Just as a tetrahedron, for instance, could be represented by the number 4, qua the number
of points required to bound its surfaces, so also, Eurytus may well
have thought, could a physical body such as man or horse be
represented by however many pebbles were found necessary to bound the visible and tangible surfaces peculiar to that particular
body. Expressed in its most general terms, in fact, the ouaia or essence of an object would be held, as in 405, to consist in its
405 Some think the limits of body, i.e. surface, line, point and unit, are substances, and more so than body or the solid. (Trans. Ross)
406 Some are in doubt even in the case of the circle and the triangle, thinking that it is not right to define these by lines and by continuous space, but that all these are to the circle or the triangle asflesh or bones are to man, and bronze or stone to the statue; and they reduce all things to numbers, and they say the formula of 'line 9 is that of'* two 9
. (Trans. Ross)
316



PHILOLAUS AND EURYTUS
surfaces, or more precisely, since a surface is derived from points, in the points that bounded those surfaces. Physical matter and
geometrical magnitude alike are bounded by surfaces, lines and
points; and the number of points required to bound any object, whether mathematical figure or physical body, is the number with which that object is equated. Finally, as the inclusion of the
word TripccTcc in 405 (and also in the passage quoted earlier, 320)
clearly suggests, both types of equation are applications, revised in the light of Eleatic criticism, of the traditional Pythagorean doctrine of the imposition of Limit upon the Unlimited.
THE UNIT AS EVEN-ODD
One last Pythagorean doctrine remains to be discussed, that
mentioned in a passage from Aristotle's Metaphysics already cited in this chapter (398), by which the unit is neither odd nor even but
both even and odd. We saw earlier (p. 241 ) that in the pre-Parmeni
dean Pythagoreanism the unit was unquestionably regarded as a manifestation of the principle of Limit only. It seems likely,
therefore, that the present view represents once again a later modification of Pythagorean doctrine in the light of Eleatic
criticism. Unfortunately Aristotle himself here, as usual, refuses
to distinguish between an earlier and a later Pythagoreanism,
but simply groups all Pythagorean doctrines together in his general survey. The following passage, however, seems to preserve for us a genuine Pythagorean tradition.

407 The first division of numbers that they make is into two classes, calling some even, some odd. Even numbers are those which can be divided into equal parts (e.g. 2 or 4), odd those which can be divided only into unequal parts (e.g. 5 or 7). Some held that the first of the odd numbers is i. For even is the contrary of odd; i is either odd or even; it cannot be even; for so farfrom being divisible into equal parts, it cannot be divided at all; whence it follows that i is odd. Again, ifyou add even to even, the whole is even; but

It is hard to resist the conclusion that this passage represents
two distinct stages in the development of Pythagoreanism. In the original view there are only two classes of number, even and odd, of which the former comprises those numbers which are divisible
into halves, the latter those which are divisible only into unequal
parts. 1 The unit itself, though it will not fit into either class, is asserted to be odd because it cannot be even, and its equation with Limit is thereby justified. But sooner or later the fact must be
acknowledged that according to these definitions the unit cannot be odd any more than it can be even. So, while the traditional
definitions are retained essentially unaltered, the third category is introduced to contain the unit and the unit only. Arithmetically,
of course, the consequence of the change is of no great significance. The first odd number is no longer i but 3; but the unit can presumably remain the principle of numbers and their mode of
generation need not necessarily be altered. Metaphysically, however, since odd is Limit and even Unlimited, the consequences
seem to be of the utmost significance. No longer is the first unit,
the starting-point of Pythagorean cosmogony, regarded as the embodiment of Limit in the Unlimited, it is instead the first
product of the blending of the two principles ; and by that simple change another of the Eleatic criticisms, that directed against the 'inhalation' of the one principle by the other (cf. pp. 253 and 274),
is duly acknowledged and countered.
1 This early definition of odd and even numbers is also preserved, in very similar words, both by Aristoxenus ap. Stob. Anth. i, i , 6 (DK 58 B 2) and by
Nicomachus LA. i, 7 (p. 13, 15 Hoche). The twofold classification of number in Theo's first sentence is to be contrasted with what may well
have been (despite the probable spuriousness of the actual fragment) the genuine view of Philolaus in 397 above.
add i to an even number and it makes the whole odd; whence it follows that i is not even
but odd. Aristotle, however, in his work on the Pythagoreans, says that i partakes of the nature of both; for when added to an even number it makes it odd, when added to an odd, even which would be impossible if it did not partake of the nature of both; and so, he says, it is called even-odd. Archytas too agrees with Aristotle on this point.
3 l8



THE POST-PARMENIDEAN SYSTEMS
The last stage of Presocratic philosophy consists primarily of the
pluralist systems of Empedocles and Anaxagoras, of the combination of pluralism and monism represented by the atomism of Leucippus and Democritus, and finally of the re-adapted Ionian monism of Diogenes of Apollonia. Each of these systems is, in its own way, a deliberate reply to Parmenides. Parmenides seemed, to his contemporaries and immediate successors, to have established once and for all certain canons with which, until Plato himself exposed the fallacies on
which they were based, all future cosmologists must somehow comply. Being, in the first place, must not be allowed to spring from Not-being: anything that was claimed as real must also be ultimate. Again, the
void, being sheer non-existence, can find no place in any account of reality. Third, plurality cannot come from an original unity: if there is to be a plurality, it too, like reality, must be ultimate. And finally, motion must no longer be simply taken for granted; its existence must somehow be explained. Any future system that ignored any one of these four canons would, for the time being at least, have been considered from the outset untenable. This estimate of the strength of Parmenides' influence is no mere
conjecture. Both Empedocles and Anaxagoras repeatedly and clearly reveal, not only by their thought but also by the language in which it is expressed, an almost servile observance of the Parmenidean
demands; atomism, although its method of complying with the Parmenidean canons shows a courageous refusal to be intimidated, is nevertheless in a very special sense the outcome of the Eleatic
paradox; and Diogenes, even though he reverts to the single specific substance of Anaximenes, incorporates much from Anaxagoras and Leucippus in order to protect himself against Elea. Since one of the
most interesting and important aspects of the history of early Greek philosophy and it is an aspect that can easily be lost from sight is
its peculiar continuity, a part of each of the main chapters that follow will be devoted to showing, where possible in the philosophers' own words, how these post-Parmenidean systems are deliberately designed to take account of the findings of the Way of Truth.

Empedocles' precise dates are impossible to determine. Apollo
dorus, whom Diogenes is doubtless following in 408, is, as usual,
408 He flourished in the eighty-fourth Olympiad.
409 Empedodes, according to Hippobotus, was the son of Meton, himself son of Empedocles^ and came from Acragas. . . . Eratosthenes^ in his Olympic victors, says that the father of Melon won a victory in the seventy-first Olympiad, and he cites Aristotle as evidence. But Apollodorus the grammarian writes in his Chronicles that 'he was the son
of Meton, and Glaucus says that he came to Thurii very soon after its foundation
'
. . ..
According to Aristotle, and also Heraclides, he died at the age of sixty.
410 Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, who, though older than Empedocles, was later in his philosophical activity (Trans. Ross)
411 Empedocles ofAcragas was born not long after Anaxagoras, and was an admirer and associate of Parmenides, and even more of the Pythagoreans. . ..

EMPEDOGLES
definite enough; but it seems most likely that he has arrived at his
answer by simply assuming that Empedocles was forty years old
when Thurii was founded (i.e. in Ol. 84, 444-441 B.C.). Accord
ingly it has often been suggested that the date given by Apollodorus is considerably too late. 1 In the absence of any reliable and decisive
evidence, there is no ground for more than the very tentative conclusion that Empedocles' floruit must have been somewhere
around the middle of the century. That, at any rate, as we shall see (pp. 380 f.), tallies with what we are told in 410 and 411 about
the relative dates of Empedocles and Anaxagoras.
1 See Diels, 'Gorgias und Empedokles ', SB Ber. (1884) 343 ff.
LIFE
Empedocles, like Pythagoras and Heraclitus, was a favourite subject
(cf. p. 183) for apocryphal biographical tales. A considerable number of them, drawn from numerous sources, are preserved by Diogenes. For the most part they are concerned either with his
political activities or with his death, and it is the former group alone
which may perhaps contain a germ of truth. He is said to have been
an ardent democrat, to have broken up some otherwise unknown organization called the Thousand, and to have refused the king
ship of his city (see Diogenes Laertius vm, 66 and 63, DK.3I AI). Here at least we do seem to have something other than a mis
guided embellishment of his own words in his poems ; indeed we might almost conclude from his poems that his views were aristocratic rather than democratic. It would be unwise, however, to accept even these stories at their face value; they do no more than testify to a probably genuine tradition that as a democrat he took
a leading part in the politics of his city. He was evidently also an accomplished orator: Aristotle, in his lost dialogue Sophist, apparently
called him the inventor of rhetoric (Diog. L. vm 57, DK 3 1 A i ) , and
Gorgias is said to have been his pupil. Finally, his fame as a doctor,
which is suggested by his own words in fragment 1 12,1 is proved by the numerous references to him in later medical writings.

WRITINGS
The two poems from which the surviving fragments come were
called respectively TTepl 9uaco$, On Nature, and KocOccpnoi, Purifications. According to Diogenes Laertius (vm, 77) these two poems together ran to five thousand lines/ while the Suda (s.v. Empedocles, DELIAS) tells us that On Nature was in two books, together
comprising some two thousand lines. The extant verses even of
the poem On Nature represent, therefore, less than a fifth of the
original whole, while those of the Purifications, if the figure given
by Diogenes is correct, are even more fragmentary. In addition to these two poems Diogenes (I.e.) says that there was also a work of six hundred lines on medicine, which the Suda (I.e.) however tells us was in prose. Several other works are also
ascribed by later authorities to Empedocles, including no less than
forty-three tragedies, but it seems very unlikely that they are in fact his.

Koc0ocpnoi els ^Trrj TGIVOUCH TrevTocKiaxfAia. Diels, however, on the ground that the KocOocpnof is unlikely to have extended to 3000 lines, suggested reading TT&VTOC TpicrxiAia instead.
THE PROBLEM
Though the precise order of the fragments cannot be certainly determined, and though in a few cases it is even doubtful from
which poem a fragment comes, the arrangement of Diels is now
generally accepted. On the basis of the fragments alone it is possible to reconstruct the system of Empedocles with greater confidence than most of the Presocratic philosophers allow. The
chief difficulty in his case is of quite a different order. Whereas the
poem On Nature is primarily concerned to give a physical explanation of the universe and its contents, and in the process seems to leave no room for an immortal soul, the Purifications is based
upon the Pythagorean belief in transmigration. The resulting conflict between the two poems has been resolved, in modern
times, in a variety of ways. While some scholars, including both Zeller and Burnet, are content to conclude that Empedocles held
simultaneously beliefs that are not only incompatible but actually
413 His On nature and Purifications together comprise as much as 5000 lines.
322



EMPEDOCLES
contradictory, others have argued that the two poems must
belong to separate stages of Empedocles' life. The following
exposition, which owes much to the unpublished work of the late
F. M. Cornford, will attempt to show that, while the former of
these two views is far preferable to the latter, it still lays undue
stress upon the alleged incompatibility of the two poems. It will always remain a difficult question what view Empedocles really did take of the soul; but unless one poem is used to throw light
upon the obscurities of the other, even more difficult problems will remain to be solved.

These fragments amply suffice to show the strength of the in
fluence exercised by Parmenides on Empedocles. A comparison of
414 with fragment 8 of Parmenides (especially 11. 16-21, 347), or of 415 and 416 with lines 22-25 of the same fragment (348), reveals that Empedocles was not only complying with the Parmenidean
canons but doing so consciously and deliberately. It might even be maintained that this compliance is the basis of Empedocles'
system; for these few fragments, besides affording an eloquent indication of Empedocles' dependence on Parmenides, can be
made to serve also as an introduction to his cosmology. Parmenides had maintained that reality cannot come from
unreality nor plurality from an original unity. Empedocles meets both demands simultaneously. There never was, he replies, an
original unity; there were rather four eternally distinct substances, Zeus, Hera, Aidoneus and Nestis, or Fire, Air, Earth and Water. 1 These between them fill the whole of space, leaving no place in the universe for the non-existent void. All things consist of these elements, or irreducible forms of matter, in various proportions.
When a thing is said to come into existence or to perish, all that has really happened is that one temporary combination of these indestructible elements has been dissolved and another been
established. Change in fact is nothing but a re-arrangement; and to account for the motion in space which alone could effect such
a reshuffling, two motive forces, Love and Strife, take their place along with the elements as the only ultimate realities. So all four of the Parmenidean demands (see p. 319) are duly met, and
already, in meeting them, Empedocles has evolved the essentials of his system. In following his cosmology through the peculiar
cycle which he imposed upon it, we shall be merely filling in the details of an outline that has already emerged.
1 It is characteristic of Empedocles that he should present the ' four roots ' at their first appearance in mythological guise. Nestis is certainly Water,
418 And these things never ceasefrom continual shifting, at one time all coming together,
through Love, into one, at another each borne apart from the others through Strife.

but even in antiquity there was a difference of opinion concerning the other three. Fire, which is here probably represented by Zeus, is in frs. 96 and 98 called Hephaestus. For Empedocles' belief in the corporeality of air see 453.

One of the first questions Empedocles had to tackle was whether or
not the senses are a reliable guide to the truth. In these important verses, which are shown by the rest of the fragment to come from
the introduction to the poem, he is as deliberately contradicting Parmenides as he is elsewhere obeying him. Clearly the sort of cosmology on which he is about to embark demands, as indeed any
cosmology must, faith in the validity of sense-perception. So far, therefore, from following Parmenides in his condemnation of the
senses, he instructs his readers to make full but discriminating use
of them, taking care to employ each sense for the appropriate
purpose. 1

1 This is probably a single fr., of which Plut. (defac. tun. 12, 926 E) quotes 11. 1-2 (though he refers them to the rule of Strife and reads dyAocov

In these fragments Empedocles' debt to Parmenides is again obvious: though 422 doubtless reflects also the influence of
Xcnophancs' attack upon anthropomorphic gods (see pp. i68f.) 3 Empcdocles' Sphere is indisputably modelled on that of Par
menides. What Empedocles has done in fact is to take the sphere of Parmenides and fill it from the outset with the four eternally
distinct elements. But this single change from an original unity to an original plurality makes the whole difference to the sequel. Whereas with Parmenides the sphere, being a unity, can never
undergo the slightest change, with Empedocles it proves to be but one phase in a never-ending cosmic cycle.

The cosmic cycle which Empedocles is here describing is the most
peculiar feature in his whole system. This never-ending cycle would seem (though this has been disputed) to have four stages, two polar stages represented by the rule of Love and the rule of Strife, and two transitional stages, one from the rule of Love towards the rule of Strife, and the other back again from the rule of Strife towards the rule of Love. The rule of Love itself, in which
'all things unite in one through Love' (1. 7), is of course the Sphere described in the fragments in the last section. It is a uniform mixture of the four elements so uniform that nothing whatever can be discerned in it. Before we proceed to follow the cosmic cycle through the other three stages, it will be as well to pause at
this first stage (for though the cycle is never-ending and has therefore no chronologically first stage, the rule of Love is still the
logical starting-point of the process), and consider in more detail the various ingredients in the mixture.

more many, thus far they come into being and they have no lasting life; but in so far as they never cease from continual interchange of places, thus far are they ever changeless in the
cycle. 424 But come, hearken to my words; for learning increaseth wisdom. As I said before when I declared the limits of my words, a double tale will I tell: at one time it grew to be

earth and the vast height of air, dread Strife too, apart from these, everywhere equally balanced, and Love in their midst, equal in length and breadth. On her do thou gaze with thy mind, and sit not with dazed eyes; for she is recognized as inborn in mortal limbs; by her they think kind thoughts and do the works of concord, calling her Joy by name and Aphrodite. Her does no mortal man know as she whirls around amid the others; but do thou pay heed to the undeceitful ordering of my discourse. For all these are equal, and of like

if they were continually being destroyed, they would no longer be; and what could increase this whole, and whence could it come? And how could these things perish too, since
nothing is empty of them? Nay, there are these things alone, and running through one another they become now this and now that and yet remain ever as they are.

1 It looks as if a line had fallen out here, balancing the eiTe clause and completing what in its present form appears an incomplete argument.
In these passages the influence of Parmenides is once again obvious enough : certain lines in 424 could well have come from
Parmenides himself. Empedocles is in fact playing his usual part of mediator. Taking, presumably, those opposite substances which
had been most conspicuous in earlier cosmologies, the hot, the cold, the wet and the dry (the first pair of which were definitely used by Anaximander, while both pairs were mentioned in
Heraclitus fr. 126), and explicitly asserting that they are eternally distinct, he places them in the Parmenidean sphere and, by merely mixing and reshuffling them, accounts for birth, death, change and all physical phenomena. As he is at pains to point out, his elements do not, either in nature or behaviour, break any of the Parmeni
dean canons. He has already effectively restored, by a mere
revision of pre-Parmenidean ideas, plurality and diversity; he is about to restore, by the introduction of his two motive forces, motion, change and time. In fact the only Parmenidean tenet that he has sacrificed is that which Parmenides himself had valued most of all, his monism. That gone, the rest follows without
further infringement. The elements, Empedocles says in both 424 and 425, comprise the whole of material reality: 'there are these alone.' Simplicius would seem therefore to be fully justified in the following comment
on Empedocles:

426 He makes the material elements four in number, fire, air, water and earth, all
eternal, but changing in bulk and scarcity through mixture and separation; but his real first principles, which impart motion to these, are Love and Strife. The elements are

Empedocles was certainly feeling his way towards the distinction here drawn between the material and the efficient cause. Love, he
explicitly says, is the same as Aphrodite, which we recognize in
ourselves but not in the universe. He is in fact drawing, and
literally believing in, the analogy between the universe as a whole and man. Love and Strife are not, therefore, mere mechanical
forces disguised under mythical or allegorical names. Empedocles believes, as the analogy shows, that sexual love and cosmic Love arc one and the same self-existent external force which acts upon
the person or the thing that loves. 1 At the same time he is still unable to imagine any form of existence other than spatial exten
sion, and in consequence his Love and Strife are still represented
(in 424, 11. 19-20) as if they too were material.2 We have seen earlier (pp. 302 ff.) how gradual was the advance towards the apprehension of the abstract. Empedocles here takes another step
in that direction. We shall see, on pp. 374 f., how Anaxagoras takes yet another. But it was not until Plato elaborated his theory of Ideas that the goal was eventually reached.
1 Aristotle in his comments on Empedocles goes further than this and says that Love and Strife have a moral character. Cf. 4^7 Aristotle Met. A 4,

427 For if we were to follow out the view of Empedocles, and interpret it according to its meaning and not to its lisping expression, we should find that Love is the cause of good
things, and Strife of bad. Therefore, if we said that Empedocles in a sense both mentions, and is the first to mention, the bad and the good as principles, we should perhaps be right ____ (After Ross)
428 Empedocles also has a paradoxical view; for he identifies the good with Love. But this is a principle both as mover (for it brings things together) and as matter (for it is part of the mixture). (Trans. Ross)

These two brief fragments are all that survive of Empedocles'
description of the disruption of the Sphere. At that stage in the cosmic cycle when the rule of Love was complete, Strife was evidently altogether excluded from the Sphere. Indeed one short
fragment may well, in its context, have said exactly that :
431 Fr. 2 7 a, Plutarch Maxime cum prim. 2, 7770
ou ordcris ouSe TE Sfjpis avaiai|Jios V laeAseaaiv.
When we come to the opposite polar stage in the cycle, we shall
find Empedocles, in his description of the disruption of the rule of Strife, saying that * a soft, immortal stream of blameless Love kept
running in' (sec 464). Presumably, therefore, the reverse process has been taking place in the Sphere : Strife, at one stage completely excluded, has been flowing back into the Sphere until it attains a
sufficient proportion to assert itself. When that happens, motion
begins, and cosmogony, in the normal sense, is initiated. But, as Aristotle complains in 429, what higher power it is that determines 'by a mighty oath' the timing of the alternations in the cosmic
429 And at the same time Empedocles mentions no cause of the change itself, except that things are so by nature. 'But when Strife waxed great in the limbs, and sprang to his prerogatives as the time wasfulfilled which isfixedfor them in turn by a broad oath ' this
implies that change was necessary. (After Ross)
430 But when Strife began once more to prevail, then there is again motion in the Sphere; 'for all the god's limbs in turn began to quake.

431 There is no discord nor unseemly rivalry in his limbs.

PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
cycle is very far from clear. It might conceivably be maintained that Love and Strife had themselves sworn the oath; but it seems much more likely that Empedocles is here guilty of an undetected
confusion, at one moment asserting that the four elements and Love and Strife are alone ultimate, at another suggesting that even for them there are laws laid down which they cannot infringe.

432 Come, I shall tell thee first of the surf, and whence became manifest all the things we now behold9 the earth and the billowing sea, the damp air and the Titan aither who
fastens his circle around all things.
433 Empedocles holds that aither was thefirst to be separated off, nextfire, and after that earth. From the earth, as it was excessively constricted by the force of the rotation, sprang water. From water air came by evaporation. The heavens arose from the aither, the sun from the fire, while terrestrial things were compressed from the other elements.
434 Empedocles of Acragas . . . holds that the air that was separated offfrom the original mixture of the elements flowed around in a circle; and after the air fire ran outwards and, having nowhere else to go, ran upwards under the solidified periphery around the air. There
are, he says, two hemispheres revolving round the earth, one consisting entirely offire, the other of a mixture of air with a little fire; this latter he supposes to be night. Their motion arises from the fact that the accumulation offire in one region gives it preponderance there.
332



EMPEDOCLES
In these passages we see the earliest stages of cosmogony. Air,1 being the first of the elements to be separated out of the sphere,
took up a position surrounding the world, and evidently (to judge from 434) its outermost margin solidified to form the firmament.
When, however, fire followed air upwards, it seems to have dis
placed the air enclosed in the upper half of this solid firmament,
and the air thereupon sank, taking a little fire with it, into the
lower half. Two hemispheres are thus formed inside the firmament, the diurnal and the nocturnal, and when the concentration of fire in the upper hemisphere somehow2 so upsets the balance of the sphere as to start a circular motion, the result is the alternation of
day and night.
1 433 is one of several passages which suggest that Empedocles sometimes called air * aither ', though the two were normally regarded as distinct. Admittedly in 432 * aither' must stand for fire; but equally clearly in 453 (11- 5) 7> l & and 2 4) it represents air.
2 Why a concentration of a light element, Fire, in the upper hemisphere
should start a circular motion is altogether obscure; but the evidence
strongly suggests that Empedocles thought it did.

435 The sun is not in its nature fire, but rather a reflexion offire like that which comes from water. The moon, he says, was composed of air that had been shut in by fire; this air was solidified, like hail. The moon gets its light from the sun.
436 Empedocles says that the stars are made offire, composed of the fiery element which the air originally contained but squeezed out at the first separation.
437 Empedocles says that the fixed stars were attached to the ice (i.e. the frozen periphery), while the planets were unattached.

1 The text of this fr. is corrupt. The above version is Diels* conjecture for the ms. dTTEciKeOaae . . . eare oclav KaOuirepOev.
1'hesc passages contain the most notable of Empcdocles' astronomical theories. The statement in 435 that the sun is not itself
fire but a reflexion of fire involves a difficulty. Aetius tells us
(n, 20, 13, DK3IA56) that the fire reflected by the sun is that which, according to 434, is concentrated in the diurnal hemi
sphere; but in that case its reflexion cannot be in the opposite
hemisphere, because that is the nocturnal. A possible solution seems to be that suggested by Burnet (EGP^K) that 'the light of the fiery hemisphere is reflected by the earth on to the fiery hemi
sphere itself in one concentrated flash'. 1 Empedocles knew, as 435
goes on to tell us, that the moon shines by reflected light. His complicated view of the nature of the sun looks like a curious
application of the same theory.
1 Cf. Plut. de Pyth. or. 1 2,400 B (DK 313 44) , which supports this interpreta
tion. Against it, however, is the suggestion in the same passage of Aetius (n, 20, 13) that the sun is a solid object (KpucrraAAoi5i(
|Sj 'crystalline') in the fiery hemisphere which carries it round (but cf. n. i on p. 1 56) .
438 But she kept off the sun's rays, so long as it was passing over above her, and cast a shadow over as much of the earth as was the breadth of the pale-faced moon.
439 All those who generate the heavens hold that it was for this reason that the earth
came together to the centre. They then seek a reason for its staying there; and some say, in
the manner explained, that the reason is its size andflatness, others, like Empedocles, that
the motion of the heavens, moving about it at a higher speed, prevents movement of the earth, as the water in a cup, when the cup is given a circular motion, though it is often underneath the bronze, is for this same reason prevented from moving with the downward movement which is natural to it. (After Stocks)
334



EMPEDOGLES
For the rest these passages are straightforward enough. 438 shows that Empedocles knew also the true cause of eclipses, while 439 is one of the few reliable passages affording evidence of simple argument from observation on the part of the Presocratic physicists
(cf. p. 149 n., and p. 341, 453 and comment).

These two fragments show that Empedocles was concerned (as
indeed he had to be, in order to explain how composite organisms could come into existence from a mixture of the four elements) not only with the elements themselves and the complete objects which they ultimately formed, but also with such intermediate
substances (the proximate materials of the complete objects) as
bone and flesh. He seems to have been the first of the Presocratic
philosophers to pay much attention to such compounds; but,
essential as they are in his cosmogony, they still did not apparently
figure so prominently in Empedocles as they did in Anaxagoras
(see pp. 378 ff.). The exact proportions in which these substances are compounded reveal the influence of Pythagoreanism on
Empedocles. We shall see later (pp. 351 ff.) that this is by no means the only manifestation of that influence.
440 The kindly earth received in its broadfunnels two parts of gleaming Nestis out of
the eight, and four of Hephaestus; and there arose white bones divinely fitted together by the bonds of Harmony. 441 And the earth came together with these in almost equal proportions, with Hephaestus9 with moisture and with brilliant aither, and so it anchored in the perfect harbours of Kupris, either a little more of it or less of it with more of the others. From these did blood
arise, and the forms offlesh besides.

PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
FOUR STAGES OF EVOLUTION
At this point we meet a further complication in Empedocles' physical system. Not only is there, as we have already seen (pp. 326 f.), a cosmic cycle of two polar and two transitional
stages, but also, in each of the latter, there are evidently two distinct stages in the evolution of living things. The four stages to
gether seem to be accurately summarized in the following passage :

With the aid of this passage it is possible to allocate to the appro
priate stage of evolution most of the fragments of Empedocles that are concerned with the generation of living things. It will be best to describe the first three of the four stages before considering which two belong to the phase in the cosmic cycle now under discussion and which to the transition from the rule of Strife back to the rule of Love.

442 Empedocles held that the first generations of animals and plants were not complete but consisted of separate limbs not joined together; the second, arising from the joining of these limbs, were like creatures in dreams; the third was the generation of whole-natured forms; and the fourth arose no longer from the homoeomerous substances such as earth or water, but by generation, in some cases as the result of the condensation of their nourish" merit, in others because feminine beauty excited the sexual urge; and the various species of animals were distinguished by the quality of the mixture in them ....
443 Here sprang up many faces without necks, arms wandered without shoulders, unattached, and eyes strayed alone, in need offoreheads.

EMPEDOGLES
This fragment clearly describes the first of the four stages described
by Aetius in 442. At this stage, according to the brief and
incomplete fr. 58, 'solitary limbs wandered about seeking for union 5
. The next stage therefore shows them having achieved, if
at random, the union they were seeking.

These fragments describe vividly enough Aetius' second stage,
a period of monsters and deformities. We learn also from the
following passage that at this stage in evolution, as presumably at each of the others too, those creatures that were accidentally fitted
to survive did so, while the rest perished :

444 But as one divine element mingledfurther with another, these things fell together as each chanced to meet other, and many other things besides these were constantly resulting.
445 . . . with rolling gait and countless hands ....
446 Many creatures were born with faces and breasts on both sides, man-faced oxprogeny, while others again sprang forth as ox-headed offspring of man, creatures compounded partly of male, partly of the nature offemale, andfitted with shadowy [or sterile Diels] parts.
447 Wherever, then, everything turned out as it would have if it were happening for a purpose, there the creatures survived, being accidentally compounded in a suitable way; but where this did not happen, the creatures perished and are perishing still, as Empedocles says of his '
man-faced ox-progeny '.

On the ground that he combined belief in evolution with this
theory of the survival of the fittest, Empedocles has sometimes
been extravagantly claimed to have anticipated Darwin (cf. also on Anaximander, p. 142).

This third stage, the stage of 'whole-natured forms' without
distinction of sex, may possibly have been the origin of the theory put into the mouth of Aristophanes in Plato's Symposium. 1 These * wholc-natured forms ' are the outcome of the tendency of fire * to
join its like 5
; and that tendency in turn is the outcome of the
influence of Strife, the function of which, as we shall see, is to break up the uniform mixture of the elements, the work of Love, into
four separate masses. As the process of separation continues, the sexes are eventually distinguished and we reach the last of Aetius'
four stages.
1 Widely different interpretations are, however, possible. Simplicius, for instance, thinks that a * whole-natured form* has no distinct parts at all, while Aristotle regards it as merely a form of seed.

449 There is a further question, too, which might be asked. Is it possible or impossible that bodies in unordered movement should combine in some cases into combinations like

The question of which evolutionary stages belong to which phase
in the cosmic cycle has been much debated. But these passages leave little room for doubt. It is clear from 449 that the first stage
belongs to the period when Love is gaining ascendancy; 1 and since the second stage follows immediately upon the first, that too
must obviously belong there. On the other hand 451, and
especially the word vOv,
c now', shows that the present state of the
world belongs to the other transitional phase, when Strife is gaining upon Love. That leaves only the third stage; and as that
third stage is, as we have just seen, only the prelude to the present,
the pattern is complete. The third and fourth stages belong, in that order, to the phase of the cycle that we are now considering, the
progressive disruption of the Sphere by Strife; and the fourth stage
is that which the actual world has now reached. The first and
second stages, on the other hand, belong to the last phase in the cosmic cycle, which is yet to be discussed (pp. 346 ff.).
1 That Aristotle's phrase irl TTJS OtAoTr|TO$ (or (DtAfocs) refers, not to the
rule of Love, but to the period when Love is again gaining ascendancy is clear from (among other considerations) the following passage: Simplicius de caelo 587, 24 (DK3IB59) iirl Tfjs OiAoTiyros . . .

450 . . . as Empedocles said that ' where heads of many creatures came to birth without necks 9
, they are then put together by Love .... 451 At the same time he asserts that the world is in the same state now in the period of
Strife as it was earlier in that of Love.
452 By ' in the period of Love ' he means, not when Love was already in control, but when it was going to be.

PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Stage 4: the present world Since the world as we know it belongs to the fourth and last of the
evolutionary stages of 442, it is here that the relatively numerous fragments belong that are concerned with such specialized sciences as botany, embryology and physiology. In each of these Empedocles made important contributions to Greek thought.
A number of brief fragments (77-81) concerned with botany a subject to which Empedocles seems to have been the first Greek to
pay much attention are supplemented by a fairly detailed
summary by Actius (v, 26, 4, DK3iA7o). Plants, Empedocles maintained, were the first living things to appear, being, like the 'whole-natured forms' of 448, temporary combinations of fire moving upwards from beneath the earth to join its like in the firmament, and earth moving downwards under the same impulse.
Again like the 'whole-natured forms', plants are not yet sexually differentiated, but, combining the two sexes in one, reproduce themselves by bearing 'eggs' (fr, 79). The fragments concerned with embryology (63-70) are likewise very brief, but are again supplemented by Aetius (v, 7, i ; 8, i; 10, i; n, i; 12, 2; all in DK.3iA8i). Male children are conceived in the warmer part of
the womb (fr. 67) and contain a greater proportion of the hot than do female. 'The substance of the child's limbs is divided' between the parents (fr. 63), or in other words is derived from both a view that was by no means universal in the ancient world, the
Pythagoreans, for instance, believing that it derived entirely from the father but the child will resemble whichever of the parents
has contributed most. As for physiology, Empedocles here again attached great importance to the principle of the attraction of like
to like; not only does it account for nutrition and growth (Aetius v,
27, i, DK3I A 7 7), but also for pleasure and pain (Aetius iv, 9, 15,
DK3i A 95). It is not possible to describe in detail all Empedocles'
biological and physiological theories that have been preserved; from the point of view of the historian of philosophy his chief
importance lies elsewhere. But there are a few special topics
falling under this general heading that are sufficiently notable to merit inclusion.

surface, and at the mouths of these channels the outermost
surface of skin is pierced right through with many a pore, so that the blood is kept in but an easy path is cut for the air to pass through. Then, when the fluid blood rushes away thence, the bubbling air rushes in with violent surge; and when the blood leaps up, the air
is breathed out again, just as when a girl plays with a klepsydra of gleaming brass. When she puts the mouth of the pipe against her shapely hand and dips it into the fluid mass ofshining water, no liquid enters the vessel, but the bulk of the air within, pressing upon thefrequent perforations, holds it back until she uncovers the dense stream; but then, as the air yields, an equal bulk of water enters. In just the same way, when water occupies the depths of the brazen vessel and the passage of its mouth is blocked by human hand, the air
outside, striving inwards, holds the water back, holding its surface firm at the gates of the ill-sounding neck until she lets go with her hand; and then again (the reverse of what happened before), as the breath rushes in, an equal bulk of water runs out before it. And in just the same way, when the fluid blood surging through the limbs rushes backwards and

This celebrated passage, with its implicit proof of the corporeality of air, is often cited, along with 439, as evidence that the Pre
socratics in general, and Empedocles in particular, were familiar with the experimental method of modern science. 'The rise of the experimental method 5 writes Burnct (EGP2*j) 'dates from the time when the medical schools began to influence the development of philosophy, and accordingly we find that the first recorded
experiment of a modern type is that of Empedokles with the
klepsydra* We have his own account of this (fr. 100), and we can
see how it brought him to the verge of anticipating Harvey and Torricelli. 5 This is of course an exaggerated view. That Empedocles
made occasional use, if not of experiment, at least of simple
observation, cannot be disputed. It might easily be maintained, however, that all he is here doing is using an isolated observation
to illustrate a theory already reached by methods far removed
from the experimental technique of modern science. And even if the opposite view be taken, that his observation of the klepsydra was
the result of deliberate research (which it quite patently was not),
this same fragment proves conclusively that his experiments were scarcely, as Burnet claimed, modern in character. For, as Corn
ford replied (Principium Sapientiae 6), 'this theory could have been tested by anyone who would sit in a bath up to his neck and observe whether any air bubbles passed through the water into, or out of, his chest as he breathed 5
.2
1 The KAeyvSpcc, usually translated 'water-clock', was a metal vessel with
a narrow neck and with its base perforated, like a modern cofTee-strainer, with numerous small holes. For further details of experiments with it see [Aristotle] ProbL xvi, 8, 91409 (DK.59A69), which, however, is concerned with Anaxagoras rather than Empedocles. Gf. also 498. 2 Vlastos (Gnomon 27 (1955) 73), having quoted this sentence, continues: ' But what is there in Empedocles' theory to imply that minute quantities of air passing through water out of (or into!) one's chest would cause bubbles? Nothing at all ; bubbles or no bubbles, the theory would survive the bath experiment.' Even that criticism, however, whether or not it is
valid against Cornford, seems to support the present point, that Empe
docles knew nothing of the experimental method as it is now understood.

Theophrastus goes on to describe in some detail, and to criticize,
Empedocles' explanation of the various senses, especially sight and hearing. But these two passages give the essentials that apply to all
the senses alike. Perception is due to an element (here including
Love and Strife) in the body of the perceiver meeting with the same element outside. 'All things that have come into existence',
according to fragment Sg, 1 are continually giving off effluences ; and when these effluences are of the right size to fit into the pores
of the sense organ, then the required meeting takes place and perception arises.*

454 For with earth do we see earth, with water water, with air bright air, with fire
consuming fire; with Love do we see Love, Strife with dread Strife.
455 Empedocles has the same theory about all the senses, maintaining that perception arises when something fits into the passages of any of the senses. So one sense cannot judge
the objects of another, since the passages of some are too wide, of others too narrow, for the object perceived, so that some things pass straight through without making contact while others cannot enter at all.
456 Consider the matter in Empedocles 9
words, 'knowing that there are effluences of all things that came into being
9
. Not only animals and plants and earth and sea, but also
stones and brass and iron continuously give off many a stream; for everything is worn away and perishes from the continual motion of a ceaseless flux.

2 It is perhaps worth remarking that this explanation of sense-perception (as also the account of respiration in 453) would appear to involve the
admission of void. It looks as if Empedocles, when he came to details, was not always faithful to his fundamental principles.

These passages, which follow naturally upon Empedocles' theory of sense-perception, are of central importance for the interpretation of his system as a whole. Everything, according to 457 (which is expanded by Actius iv, 5, 12, DK3iAg6), has a share of
thought, which in man, according to 458, resides chiefly in the blood around the heart. But blood, as we saw in 441, is, like all the other constituents of the body, a merely temporary combination of the four elements; indeed it is just because the four elements are most evenly proportioned in the blood, and blood is therefore

thought. 459 And he has the same theory about wisdom and ignorance. Wisdom is of like by like, ignorance of unlike by unlike, wisdom being either identical with or closely akin to perception. For having enumerated how we know each thing by its equivalent, he added at the
end that ( out of these things are all things fitted together and constructed, and by these do they think andfeel pleasure or pain\ So it is especially with the blood that they think; for in the blood above all other parts the elements are blended.

equally perceptive of all four elements outside, that it is the chief
seat of perception. It seems inevitably to follow that both per
ception and thought (which, if not identical, are at any rate, as
459 says, very closely related) arc as temporary as the physical compound on which they depend. Where, then, is there room in Empedocles' physical poem for the immortal soul that is the very
basis of the Purifications? That is a question that must eventually be discussed (pp. 357 ff.). Meanwhile, however, the last two phases in the cosmic cycle, the rule of Strife and the reverse cosmogony, remain to be described.

If Empedocles ever described the rule of Strife in detail, the description has not survived; the only references to it in extant
fragments are those in 418 and 460. The omission, however, is
sufficiently repaired by 461. Whereas during the rule of Love the four elements were so evenly mixed that the whole sphere pre
sented no perceptible qualities whatever, during the rule of Strife they are completely separated one from the other into four homogeneous masses. Even if Empedocles himself gave no detailed
460 There are these alone, but running through one another they become men and the tribes of beasts, at one time coming together through Love into one order, at another each borne apart from the others by the enmity of Strife, till they have grown into one and are utterly subdued.
461 At least on many occasions he makes Love segregate things and Strife aggregate them. For when the universe is dissolved into its elements by Strife, fire is aggregated into one, and so is each of the other elements; but when again under the influence of Love they come
together into one, the parts must again be segregated out of each element. (After Ross)

description of the rule of Strife, it is perhaps legitimate to imagine four concentric spheres, with (to judge from two isolated hints
from Aristotle1
) the lighter elements, fire and air, outside, and the heavier, earth and water, nearer to the centre. And in that case
(to judge this time from the opposite polar stage, the rule of Love, in which Strife is altogether excluded from the Sphere) Love would
now be excluded, while Strife presumably pervaded each of the four separated elements (but see the next section).

462 For though Strife was segregating the elements, it was not by Strife that aither was borne upwards; on the contrary, he sometimes speaks as if it happened by mere chance 'for so, at the time, it chanced to be running, though often otherwise ' while sometimes he
says it is the nature offire to be borne upwards.

464 But now I shall turn back again to the channel of song that I proclaimed before, drawing offfrom my discourse another discourse. When Strife had reached to the lowest depth of the whirl, and Love was in the middle of the eddy, under her do all these things come together so as to be one, not all at once, but congregating each from different directions at their will. And as they came together Strife began to move outwards to the circumference. Yet alternating with the things that were being mixed many other things remained unmixed, all that Strife, still aloft, retained; for not yet had it altogether retiredfrom them, blame

1 L. 7 of fr. 35 is, in the text of Simplicius, identical with 1. 16. Since fr. 36,
consisting of the solitary line that is printed above as 1. 7, fits so naturally into the context, it seems most probable that Simplicius himself is responsible for an error in transcription and that the fr. ran as here
printed.
Aristotle's remark in 465, that Empedocles passes over the cosmogony of the transition to the rule of Love, is not perhaps
strictly true ; not only 464 but also, as we saw, 443 to 446 are all concerned with this phase in the cosmic cycle. But there is no denying that 464 is both vague in outline and obscure in detail.
What, for instance, is the SIVT], 'whirl 5
, of 1. 4, and how did it
arise? (The 8ivr| described on p. 333 is clearly not the same as
this one.) And is its 'lowest depth', to which Strife is said in 1. 3 to have fallen, the same as 'the outermost boundaries of the circle 5 in 1. 10? It would seem that it must be so, but it is far from clear
lessly, to the outermost boundaries of the circle, but while some parts of it had gone forth,
some still remained within. And in proportion as it was ever running forth outwards, so a gentle immortal stream of blameless Love was ever coming in. And straightway what before had attained to immortality became mortal, what had been unmixed before was now mixed, each exchanging its path. And as these things mingled, countless tribes of mortal things were spread abroad, endowed with shapes of every kind, a wonder to behold.
465 But there is no sense in starting generation from an original state in which bodies are separated and in movement. Hence Empedocles omits the period when Love was gaining ascendancy; for he could not have constructed the heavens by building them up out of bodies in separation, making them combine by the power of Love; since our world has its
constituent elements in separation, and therefore presupposes a previous state of unity and combination. (After Stocks)
347



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
from Empedocles' own words. The reason for this obscurity is not hard to guess. Empedocles, by his introduction of the cosmic cycle, has set himself a task which might well overtax even the
most fertile imagination : he has imposed upon himself the necessity of describing a cosmogony and a world that are the exact reverse of the world we know and of the cosmogony that brought it into being. It cannot even be said that the cosmic cycle was
unavoidable : it would surely have been a simpler undertaking to describe the emergence from the Sphere of a world in which the
two motive forces, Love and Strife, instead of prevailing alter
nately, reached a stable equilibrium. Why then and this is
another question of central importance for our understanding of Empedocles' system did he introduce the cosmic cycle at all?
The answer is to be found, if at all, in the Purifications. Between the physical poem and the Purifications there are certain remarkable
parallels of detail, on which comment will be made on pp. 349 ff. But the most remarkable parallel of all is that between the cosmic
cycle in the physical poem and the cycle through which the soul
passes in the Purifications. It is, at the least, very probable that
it is the analogy, already encountered in Empedocles (p. 330),
between microcosm and macrocosm, man and the world, that induced him so to complicate his cosmology with the otherwise
arbitrary cycle.
THE 'PURIFICATIONS'
The Purifications is concerned with the fall of man and with the
practices necessary for his restoration. The scheme is found elsewhere in Pindar's 'Orphic' odes, and especially in the second
Olympian, written in 476 B.C. for Theron of Acragas, Empedocles' own city. The cycle in this scheme starts from unity and peace,
falls into disorder and strife, recovers, and so begins again. It was
probably this cycle of the soul that suggested to Empedocles his
cosmic cycle. At any rate we find not only that the cosmic cycle
runs as parallel as possible to it but also that, whenever he can,
Empedocles marks the parallel with parallel phrases. The best course will be to follow the pattern already adopted in discussing the physical poem, and look in turn at what little evidence survives
about each phase of the soul's cycle.

According to Hesiod (Works and Days 109), whose word on such
subjects carried great weight, the rule of Kronos belongs to the
Golden Age at the beginning of the world. Irrespective, therefore, of the reigns of Zeus and Poseidon (the latter of which has been
confidently but quite conjecturally (cf. chapter I, pp. 37 ff.) said to be borrowed by Empedocles from the 'traditional' Orphic
mythology), the important point in 466 is that, even before the reign of Kronos, Kupris reigned alone and there was no god
Ares. Now Kupris is plainly identical with Aphrodite, with whom, in 424, the cosmic force of Love is expressly equated, while
Ares equally plainly represents Strife. The primal state of man's innocence exactly corresponds, therefore, to the cosmic rule of Love, when Strife is wholly excluded. Moreover, if it be true, as most modern scholars except Bignone agree, that fr. 134 comes from the Purifications, then the parallel between the two poems calls for no further proof:

Their altar was not steeped in the pure blood of bulls, but rather was this the greatest abomination among men, to tear out the life from the goodly limbs and eat them.

The close parallelism between this and the description of the
Sphere in 422 is obvious. 1 But even if Bignone is right and this
fragment actually comes, like 422, from the physical poem, it is still perhaps worth noting that, while cosmogony is evidently a sort of dismemberment of the Sphere by the forces of Strife, dismemberment of living things is described at the end of 466 as 'the greatest abomination among men'.2 To emphasize the analogy between the cosmic rule of Love and the reign of Kupris in man's primal innocence is not, of course, to say that they are one and the same; the point is rather that the latter may serve to
explain the obscurities of the former.
1 On such verbal parallels it is admittedly arguable that, of two unconnected poems, passages from one (including this passage, which has been said to be concerned with Apollo) were subsequently adapted to the other. That argument, however, seems to be considerably weakened, if not invalidated, by the parallelism of content between the two poems.
a A further indication of the parallelism is to be found in Aristotle's
description of the cosmic Sphere (at Met. 84, looob^) as eu8atnovoTonrov,
*
happiest' or 'most blessed'. It could perhaps be argued that this is merely another trace of the Pythagorean moral dualism; but the survival
of that dualism in Empedocles supports the view that the cosmic state and man's state are parallel.

The second stage in the religious poem is the primal sin and the
consequent fall of man. In 'Orphic' myth this primal sin was
committed by the Titans, who dismembered and ate Dionysus in the form of a bull ; and similarly in Empedocles, before man's fall, 'the altar did not reek with pure bull's blood' (466, 1. 8). But
with Empedocles, as 468 and 469 suggest, 1 the primal sin seems to have been rather bloodshed and meat-eating in general. This
primal sin evidently led to the general fall of man : the fall is conceived as collective, and leads to the end of the rule of Kupris.
But at the same time, apparently, this did not preclude also the particular fall of the individual soul. 470 shows in fact that the
individual soul falls through exactly the same crime as led to the
collective fall; and once the individual soul has fallen we pass to
the next stage in its cycle.
1 Although 468 and 469 do not describe the primal sin but contemporary sin, there can be little doubt that this contemporary sin is a repetition of the primal sin.

The fallen soul, as is clear from 471, goes the round of the elements,
banished from its proper abode. We may compare the so-called
apeniautism of Hesiod's Theogony 793 ff. banishment, that is, for a 'great year', a period the length of which varies in different
sources but in Empedocles is 30,000 seasons. It may perhaps be that this period is, in Empedocles, the same as that of the cosmic cycle, but there is unfortunately no evidence to substantiate the
conjecture. Empedocles, it should be noted, has no equivalent of Hell: on the contrary, the soul, as 472 and 473 show, pays the penalty for its sin in this world a world, as other frag
ments prove, of opposites;1 and its objective throughout its successive incarnations is, as we shall see in the next section, to
thousand seasons does he wander far from the blessed, being born throughout that time in the forms of all manner of mortal things and changing one baleful path of life for another. The might of the air pursues him into the sea, the sea spews him forth on to the dry land, the earth casts him into the rays of the burning sun, and the sun into the eddies of air. One takes him from the other, but all like abhor him. Of these I too am now one, a fugitive

This list, which is continued in fr. 123, is clearly a catalogue, in mythical garb, of the opposites that characterize this "ATTJS Aetucbv or 'vale of tears'
(473> 1- 4)
* It is difficult at this stage to avoid language which may mistakenly suggest that the soul which has sinned falls into this world. Actually of
course, by the interpretation here offered, it has been in this world throughout. Just as the four stages of the cosmic cycle all take place within the Sphere, so the soul too goes through all the stages in its cycle inside this world. Since, however, ( i ) the world is at present reverting to the rule of Strife (see p. 339), (2) Empedocles is yet convinced that he himself is about to escape from the wheel of birth back to the primal state of bliss (see the next section), it seems that the cycle of the individual soul
and the cosmic cycle, though parallel, are not synchronized.
Such, so far as the extant fragments permit a reconstruction, was the nature of man's primal sin and fall. But at this stage we
must turn back to the physical poem, and especially to fr. 30
(429) :
' But when Strife waxed great in the limbs, and sprang to his prerogatives as the time was fulfilled which is fixed for them in
turn by a broad oath . . . '. Few as are the lines that survive about
the first disruption of the cosmic rule of Love, it is surely not pure accident that they contain so many echoes of man's fall. Strife is the cause of the disruption of the cosmic Sphere: strife is the cause
of man's fall (471, 11. 13-14). In the cosmic cycle there is the fulness of time set for the alternation of Love and Strife : the duration of the fall of man from the rule of Kupris to the world of opposites is
fixed at 30,000 seasons (471, 1. 6). The pact between Love and Strife in the physical world is confirmed 'by a broad oath': the oracle of Necessity that fixed the period of the soul's banishment is 'sealed by broad oaths'. Once again in fact these echoes in a
mere three lines are sufficient to establish that the cosmic disrup

suggested by, the fall of man through the dismemberment of
living things.

It is only when we come to this fourth and last stage in the soul's cycle that the parallel between it and the cosmic cycle be
comes really illuminating; for it was the fourth and last stage in the cosmic cycle that appeared so arbitrary and unnatural. The
fourth stage in the soul's cycle consists, as we should expect, in the
return to primal innocence and bliss; it is obviously in fact, from the point of view of fallen man, the most vital stage of all. The
return is accomplished by the gradual ascent, with which these
passages are concerned, up the scale of lives. 475, according to
Aelian who preserves it, is concerned with the highest incarnations
next, that is, to man in the animal and vegetable kingdoms; while 476 tells us that Empedocles himself had once sunk so low in the scale as to become a bush. The top rung of the scale is
found in 477, namely 'prophets, bards, doctors and princes' and Empedocles himself was all of these. Having climbed so far, he is at last on the eve of escape from the cycle and will be reincarnated no more. As he says in 478, which is the introduction to the
Purifications, and as he virtually repeats in fr. 113, 'I go about
among you an immortal god, no mortal now.' No wonder
therefore that, with bliss just ahead, he regards this stage as
all-important; and no wonder that, regarding the otherwise in
explicable cosmic cycle as parallel to the cycle of the soul, he felt compelled to describe that most obscure stage in the cosmic cycle, the return from the rule of Strife to the rule of Love. The motive
was sufficient to stimulate him even to so difficult a task.
ARE THE TWO POEMS REALLY INCOMPATIBLE?
Though the parallelism between the two poems tells strongly against the view that they are quite separate and independent and must therefore belong to different periods in Empedocles' life, there is still no denying that they seem to take two widely different views of the nature of the soul. The last question to be considered,
then, is whether the two poems are, as they are usually thought to be, fundamentally incompatible, or whether, in view of the marked
numbers, asking where lies the path to gain, some seeking prophecies, while others, for many a day stabbed by grievous pains, beg to hear the word that heals all manner of illness.

similarities between them, some escape cannot be found from this conclusion. It will be best to approach the question from two
opposite angles, and consider, first, whether the religious poem does indeed reveal belief in the survival of the individual soul, as
opposed to mere reabsorption into a sort of common reservoir of
consciousness, and second, whether the physical poem does
indeed preclude the possibility of any part of the soul, as opposed to the whole of it, surviving death.

481 This is just what Empedocles says about his own birth ' Of these I too am now
one, a fugitive from the gods and a wanderer. 9 He calls by the name of god, that is to say, the One and its unity, in which he himself dwelt before he was snatched thence by Strife and born into this world ofplurality which Strife has organized.

couched in language so material that, unless they are more
figurative than is generally supposed, they seem strongly to
suggest individual survival. On the other hand 480 and the two
lines from 467, passages which reflect the influence of Xenophanes,
might be thought to tell equally strongly against it. If God is of this intangible nature, then it is certainly a tenable view that the
individual soul, after escape from the cycle of birth, is merely reabsorbed into the 'sacred mind'. 1 Such is certainly the inter
pretation of Hippolytus in 481 ; but a bishop is perhaps hardly a reliable authority on such a topic. Though the evidence on this
question is far from conclusive, it seems safest on the whole to
trust to those of Empedocles' own phrases that tell against any
such abstract conception of immortality.
1 Apart from the alleged reference to Apollo in 467, other Olympian
deities appear in the fragments of the KaOocpiJiof, notably in 466 and 479. It seems unlikely that they are only different aspects of a single divine mind.

485 In the same way it is absurd to identify the soul with the formula of the mixture; for the mixture of the elements that produces flesh has not the same formula as that which produces bone, and so, if everything does indeed consist of a mixture of the elements and if
the formula of the mixture is indeed the harmony that is the soul, the same thing will prove to have many souls distributed throughout its body. This is indeed a question that one might

These passages, taken together, not only present the second aspect of the problem but also suggest a possible solution. It is clear from 483 and 484 that Empedocles himself describes the blood in two
different ways according to the point of view that is uppermost in his mind at the moment. Viewed simply as a physical compound
it is described as a mixture, in nearly equal proportions, of the four elements and nothing else. But viewed as the seat of consciousness and this is the point of view that concerns us it was evidently assumed to contain also Love and Strife. Aristotle
actually inferred from 484 that, since soul consists of all six factors,
each of them must therefore be a seat of consciousness, recognizing its like outside (see, e.g., de an. A2, 404^8, DKsi B 109) ; but this
is generally admitted to be a false inference. It is only when all
six ingredients are combined in appropriate proportions that the whole mixture acquires consciousness; and though it is still with
the earth in the eye that we sec earth, we should not be conscious of seeing it if there were not the other ingredients of consciousness
present as well, including Love and Strife. Is there then any part of this composite consciousness, the product of all six factors, that can remain conscious in separation
from the body? Modern scholars unanimously, and perhaps rightly, say no; but not so Aristotle. Aristotle was obviously
puzzled over this question of the relation of the migrating soul to the consciousness of the blood, but he never asserts, as moderns do,
that the latter precludes the former. It appears from 485, where he is actually puzzling over the problem, that he concluded that
Empedocles must have held a vyuxfi ocpnovia doctrine ('the soul is an attunement'), the soul which is an attunement being the pro
portion of the mixture. But he evidently could not make out how
in that case the migrating soul came in at all. Was it perhaps a
put to Empedocles, who maintains that everything owes its existence to the formula of its constituents. Is then this formula itself the soul, or is the soul rather something of a different nature that arises in the limbs? And again, is Love the cause of any chance mixture, or of the mixture in accordance with the formula? And is Love itself the actual
formula, or something different over and above the formula?
358



EMPEDOCLES
portion of Love that maintained the proportion?
c ls Love', he asks in the last sentence,
c the proportion itself or something over
and above it?' And with that question he does suggest a possible
answer to the present problem. Love is itself, of course, indestructible and immutable; but there
must be a portion of it in every living, changing and perishable thing. It is therefore inevitably contaminated, in all composite things, with Strife; and so, even though essentially immutable, and preserving its identity even when contaminated, it is not, as the result of this contamination, reabsorbed at the dissolution of the
body into the mass of Love, but enters, its identity preserved, into another body. Eventually, however, it can become so purified as to rid itself of the contamination of Strife; and then, at its next release, it will either be reabsorbed and return to the unity the
rule of Kupris from which it had fallen, or else, possibly, remain as a separate bundle of Love until all Love is reabsorbed in the
Sphere. 1 It seems possible (but no more than that) that Aristotle's
vague suggestion is right and that Empedocles himself did think like this. Such an interpretation has at any rate the great
advantage over any other yet offered that, by providing the migrating soul with a physical basis, it resolves the monstrous incompatibility between the two poems, and so allows us to attach due importance to the obvious parallels between them.

486 For it is not our blood, he says, nor the blending of our breath that produced the essential principle of soul; rather from these ingredients the body is moulded, which is earth-born and mortal. Since the soul has come hither from elsewhere, he euphemistically calls birth a sojourn abroad the most comforting of all names; but in truth the soul is a fugitive and a wanderer, banished by the decrees and laws of the gods.
359



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
It seems likely enough that in this passage, which follows close
upon the quotation of five lines of fr. 115 (471), Plutarch is para
phrasing a lost passage of the Purifications ; and in that case it
provides just the corroboration required. For by the implication
that Empedocles regarded the migrating soul and physical consciousness as quite distinct, Plutarch would seem to have proved, what it is most desirable to prove in order to account for the parallelism between them, the connexion and
compatibility between the two compartments of Empedocles
5
thought.
GONCLUSION
If this necessarily tentative interpretation of Empedocles5 view of the soul is correct, then it places him in a direct current of thought flowing from Homer down to Plato, Aristotle and beyond. For
Homer, no doubt reflecting a popular view, distinguishes between 8vyjji6$, the conscious soul, and yuxr), the life-soul, the former
perishing with the body, the latter surviving. True that, when
separated from the body, the surviving soul in Homer is a mere shadow, which can only be restored to conscious life by drinking blood ; to Empedocles, on the other hand, it is of divine race and has fallen for the very reason that it has tasted blood. But that contrast might well be deliberate in which case, of course, it
would prove that Empedocles is consciously following Homer in distinguishing the two souls. Again, looking forward, the same twofold distinction is clear enough in Plato. In the Timaeus, for
instance, he contrasts the immortal part of the soul, which is
created by the Demiurge himself, with the mortal, including perception, which is added by the created deities at the moment of union with the body. Most striking of all, we find the same distinction in the 'active reason 5 of Aristotle, which, whatever its nature, alone has no bodily organ and therefore alone survives death. For the reasons suggested it seems not unlikely that
Empedocles is, in this respect, the connecting link between Homer
on the one side and Plato on the other. More than any other of
the Presocratics Empedocles is demonstrably influenced by his
predecessors; Anaximander, Xenophanes, the Pythagoreans, Parmenides, all left their mark upon him, and even his view of the soul may possibly have owed something to the view of Heraclitus
(see pp. 2O5ff.). The fact that, as we saw, Homer himself provided
360



EMPEDOCLES
the model for the catalogue of opposites in frr. 122 (474) and 123
is of course of no significance : the stylistic influence of Homer on Greek hexameter and elegiac verse was so strong that it would be
more surprising if Empedocles did not reflect it. But it is at least
a tenable view that in Empedocles the influence of Homer (or of
the popular semi-philosophical views which Homer reflects) went deeper than that.

487 He is said to have been twenty years old at the time of Xerxes 9
crossing, and to have lived to seventy-two. Apollodorus says in his Chronicles that he was born in the
seventieth Olympiad and died in the first year of the eighty-eighth. He began to be a philosopher at Athens in the archonship of Callias, at the age of twenty, as Demetrius Phalereus tells us in his Register of archons, and they say he spent thirty years there. . . . There are different accounts given ofhis trial. Sotion, in his Succession of philosophers, says that he was prosecuted by Cleonfor impiety, because he maintained that the sun was a
red-hot mass of metal, and that after Pericles, his pupil, had made a speech in his defence, he was finedfive talents and exiled. Satyrus in his Lives, on the other hand, says that the
charge was brought by Thucydides in his political campaign against Pericles; and he adds that the charge was not onlyfor impiety butfor Medism as well; and he was condemned to death in absence. . . . Finally he withdrew to Lampsacus, and there died. It is said that when the rulers of the city asked him what privilege he wished to be granted, he replied that the children should be given a holiday every year in the month in which he died. The custom is preserved to the present day. When he died the Lampsacenes buried him with full honours.

These passages suffice to show the difficulty of determining the dates of Anaxagoras' life. The first section of 487, most of which
probably represents mere conjecture by Apollodorus based on a statement of Demetrius Phalereus which it is impossible to recon
struct, immediately presents acute problems of chronology; for
even if we accept, as we apparently must, the emendation of Scaliger and conclude that Anaxagoras lived from ca. 500 to
428 B.C., it is still necessary, in order to make the passage consistent,
to suppose that the words em KccAAiov, 'in the archonship of
Callias', should rather read eiri KocAAi6c8ou,
c in the archonship of
Calliadcs', i.e. 480 B.C. That would give the following outline:
Born 5/499 B - G
Came to Athens and began his
philosophical activities 480/79 B.C. Died at Lampsacus 428/7 B.C.
All that can be said is that these dates may well be approximately right; for 488, which might have thrown some light on the
problem, is robbed of most of its value, not only by our ignorance of the exact dates of Empedoclcs (see pp. 32of.) 3 but also by the
ambiguity of its last phrase, which may mean either that Anaxa
goras wrote his book after Empedocles (the more probable interpretation), or that he was more up-to-date (or even, by Alexander's
interpretation, inferior) in his views.
488 Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, who, though older than Empedocles, was later in his
philosophical activity .... (Trans. Ross)
489 Pericles acquired high-mindedness in addition to his natural talents; for he fell in,
I believe, with Anaxagoras, who already possessed this quality, and steeping himself in natural speculation, and grasping the true nature of mind andfolly (which were the subjects of much of Anaxagoras^ discussion), he drew from that source anything that could contribute towards the art of debate.
363



PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
The problem of the date of his trial is even more difficult.
A. E. Taylor (CQii (1917) 81-7) held that (i) Plato consistently
conveys the impression that Anaxagoras was an important figure in Athens before Pericles' rise to fame but not after Socrates grew up; (2) Anaxagoras could not have attained the position at
Lampsacus that the last sentences of 487 suggest unless he had
spent a considerable time there. He therefore concludes that ' the
account given by Satyrus was right in placing his prosecution at the beginning arid not at the close of Pericles' political career',
i.e. ca. 450 B.C. On the other hand J. A. Davison (C),N.S. 3 (1953)
33 45)5 arguing in favour of accepting both Satyrus' and Sotion's accounts, surmises that there must have been an amnesty (other
wise unattested) in ca. 445/4 B.C. by which Anaxagoras was permitted to return to Athens, and estimates the relevant dates as follows :
Prosecuted by Thucydides ca. 456/5 B.C.
Conjectured amnesty after Thirty Years' Peace ca. 445/4 B.C.
Prosecuted by Cleon ca. 433-430 B.C.
Died at Lampsacus 428/7 B.C.
Fortunately, from the point of view of the historian of philosophy,
the exact date of the trial (or trials) is of relatively little importance.
There is ample evidence in the fragments of Anaxagoras' own
book that he wrote later than either Parmenides or Zeno (see
pp. 368 ff.); and it seems likely, though it is incapable of proof, that while Anaxagoras (in accordance with the more probable
interpretation of 488) includes implicit criticism of Empedocles, Melissus (see p. 305) aims one of his arguments primarily, if not exclusively, at Anaxagoras. Fortunately too, the most important facts of his life are not in dispute. There can be no question that
he spent a large part of his active life in Athens, 1 that he was fairly
intimately associated with Pericles,* that he was prosecuted on a
charge (at least among others) of impiety, and that he thereupon withdrew to Lampsacus.3
1 Anaxagoras is said to have taught both Archelaus (see ch. xvi) and
Euripides. Cf. 490 Strabo 14, p. 645 Gas. KXa^o^vios 6' f\v avf^p
'AvocSayopas 6 (puanxos, 'Ava^i^vovs 6jjnXirr^s TOU MtAri<r{ov S TOUTOU 'Apx&aos 6 9uaiKos Kal EupnriSrjs 6 Troir)Ti*)$. Since
490 Anaxagoras the natural philosopher was a distinguished Clazomenian, an associate of Anaximenes of Miletus; and his own pupils included Archelaus the natural philosopher
and Euripides the poet.
364



ANAXAGORAS
the statement that Anaxagoras was an associate of Anaximenes can mean no more than that he reproduced elements of Anaximenes* cosmology, it could be argued that the tradition of Anaxagoras' own influence on Archelaus and Euripides need imply no more. But even by 450 B.C. Euripides was at least thirty years old, and it seems almost certain that, in a society as small as the intellectual circle at Athens, he would already
have made the acquaintance of Anaxagoras. For passages in Euripides in which the influence of Anaxagoras is said to be manifest see DK^QAzoa-c
and 33. These citations by later writers seem, however, to prove only that the tradition of that influence was later widespread.

That Anaxagoras did indeed write only one book is almost certain; the other writings attributed to him by late and unreliable
authorities a treatise on perspective, another on the squaring of the circle and a book of problems if they ever existed at all, are
most unlikely to be the genuine work of Anaxagoras. His one
491 . . .Pericles had difficulty in rescuing Anaxagoras from imprisonment.
492 The inhabitants of Lampsacus buried Anaxagoras although he was a foreigner and even to this day still honour him.

Anaxagoras of Clazomenae are packed with such theories? The young, I suppose, learn these thingsfrom me things whichyou can sometimes buyfor a drachma, dear as that may be, in the orchestra, and then mock Socrates if he claims them as his own, particularly when they are so absurd.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
book, moreover, though it is said by Burnet (apparently on the
strength of the plural |3i(3A(a in 493, which *
perhaps implies that it filled more than one roll' 1
) to have been 'of some length', would seem more probably to have been quite short. Not only do the
fragments preserved by Simplicius seem to give us, with considerable repetitions, the whole basis of his system; but also the statement in 493 that the book could be bought for a drachma is a strong indication that it ran to no great length. The economics of Athens in 399 B.C. are by no means easy to reconstruct, but what evidence there is shows that the purchasing power of a drachma
was by then quite small. No doubt in the latter part of his book
Anaxagoras pursued his general principles into such detailed
topics as astronomy, meteorology, physiology and sense-perception subjects on which there is plenty of second-hand evidence but very few and scanty fragments. But he must in that case have dealt with them with the same summary brevity that characterizes
some of the fragments surviving from the earlier part. The extant
fragments, which together comprise about a thousand words, can hardly represent less than an eighth of the original whole and may well represent a considerably larger fraction.2
1 Simplicius also implies that in his day Anaxagoras' work was divided into more than one part: at, e.g., Phys. 34, 29 (DK.59B4) and 155, 26 (DKsgs i) he speaks of* the first part '
(or
' book ') of the work On Nature. This certainly seems to tell in favour of Burnet's view. But there is nothing in Socrates' words in 493 to suggest that the book was a long one except the plural
|3i|3Af a,
' books '
; and the word pipAfov, even in the plural, carries (at this date at least) no definite implication of length. It seems more likely, for the reasons given in this section, that if the work was originally divided, as it was in Simplicius' time, into more than one part, they were very short
parts. 2 Prof. A. H. M. Jones has very kindly corroborated this calculation with
the following note :
* The simplest calculation is on the assumption that the copyist would be a slave x^P^S olKcov. His owner would expect an dm>9opoc from a skilled slave of at least 2 obols a day; Timarchus' CTKVTOTOIIOI
(Aeschines i, 97) paid him 2 obols and their foreman 3 obols; Nicias and others in the fifth century got i obol a day for unskilled mine slaves, but
this included amortization (the hirer had to replace those who died) (Xenophon Poroi iv, 14-15). Food is reckoned at 2 obols a day by Dem. iv,
28, but this is probably an underestimate, as Dem. is trying to prove that
his scheme could be run quite cheaply. The Eleusinian accounts (/.G.z n
and m 1672-3, of 329-327 B.C.) allow 3 obols a day for public slaves for
Tpc>9^. One must also allow for clothes and other extras, and for the slave's
own profit (he would have to allow for slack times when he had no work, and he also expected to put by to pay for his freedom) ; also for the cost of

papyrus (I fear this cannot be calculated as we do not know in what units
it was bought). However, a man's time alone would amount to at least
a drachma a day; skilled men (carpenters, stonemasons etc.) are paid 2 to 2j drachmae a day in the Eleusinian accounts.
A book sold for a drachma would, therefore, be such as could be copied in well under a day.'
THE PROBLEM
No Presocratic philosopher has given rise to more dispute, or been
more variously interpreted, than has Anaxagoras. Among recent attempts to reconstruct his system the most notable are those of
Tannery (Pour Vhistoire de la science Hellene, 2nd edition), Bailey
(Greek Atomists and Epicurus, App. I), Cornford (CQ, 24 (1930) i4ff. and 8sff.), Peck (CQ 25 (1931) 27 ff. and naff.), and Vlastos (Philos. Rev. 59 (1950) 3 iff.). At the beginning of Cornford's reconstruction the problem, as it is usually understood, is succinctly stated as follows: 'Anaxagoras' theory of matter. . .rests on two propositions which seem flatly to contradict one another. One is
the principle of Homoeomereity : A natural substance, such as a piece of gold, consists solely of parts which are like the whole and like one another every one of them gold and nothing else. The
other is: "There is a portion of everything in everything", understood to mean that a piece of gold (or any other substance), so far
from containing nothing but gold, contains portions of every other substance in the world. Unless Anaxagoras was extremely
muddleheaded, he cannot have propounded a theory which
simply consists of this contradiction. One or the other proposition
must be reinterpreted so as to bring them into harmony. Some critics attack one, some the other; some try to modify both. 5 The
following reconstruction, though it owes something to each of those
listed above, has more in common with the ancient interpretations than it has with any of the modern except, perhaps, Peck's. It is
actually very doubtful whether any critic, ancient or modern, has ever fully understood Anaxagoras, and there are some points on which certainty is now unattainable. There are, however, two principles which every reconstruction should observe: first that
the only entirely reliable guide to the opinions of Anaxagoras is his own words; and second (a principle often overlooked in modern times) that he is much more likely to have meant what he said than what, though he could easily have said it, he did not
in fact say. If the result of observing these two principles is
367



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
unpalatable, then it must be remembered that what is unpalatable to us, and even what was unpalatable to Aristotle and his successors, need not necessarily have been so to Anaxagoras himself.
The system of Anaxagoras, like that of Empedocles before him and that of the atomists after, is to a large extent a conscious
reaction to the theories of his predecessors. It will be easiest, therefore, to base our reconstruction of it on his reaction to
Parmenides, Zeno and other Presocratics.

Simplicius, to whom we owe the preservation of almost all the
fragments, tells us that 495 was the opening of Anaxagoras' book.
It shows at the outset how extreme was the reaction of Anaxagoras against the Eleatic monism. Whereas Parmenides had written (in
" ouSe TTOT' ?jv ouS* ecrrai, rri vuv eaTiv oiiou -rrav,
ev,
495 All things were together, infinite in respect of both number and smallness; for the
small too was infinite. And while all things were together, none of them were plain because
of their smallness; for air and aither covered all things, both of them being infinite; for these are the greatest ingredients in the mixture of all things, both in number and in size.
496 But before these things were separated of, while all things were together, there was not even any colour plain; for the mixture of all things prevented it, of the moist and the dry, the hot and the cold, the bright and the dark, and of much earth in the mixture and of seeds countless in number and in no respect like one another. For none of the other things either are like one to the other. And since this is so, we must suppose that all things are in the whole.
368



ANAXAGORAS
('nor was it at some time past, nor shall it be, since it is now all at once, one, continuous 5
), Anaxagoras in his very first sentence
starts by substituting opoO TT&VTCC xp^naTa for 6|aoO irav, EV; next admits the forbidden fjv; and finally, in the words direipcc
(7|jiiKp6TT)Tcc, denies also the implication of indivisibility in Parmenides' ovvexes* The world, according to Anaxagoras, arose from a universal mixture of every single thing that was ultimately to
emerge; only by putting 'all things together' into this original mixture could coming into being and perishing be effectually eliminated. This is put very clearly in the following passage :

Here it cannot be doubted that Anaxagoras is explicitly accepting one of the Parmenidean demands. There can be little doubt either
that the rejection of the other demands, in 495, is equally deliberate.
The original mixture, as Anaxagoras says in both 495 and 496, was so uniform a mixture of so many diverse ingredients that
nothing would have been perceptible to an imaginary observer except perhaps 'air 1 and aither' (see pp. 382 ff.). The list of ingredients in the long sentence in 496, which has been a source of
difficulty to modern commentators, is probably not intended to be exhaustive. Apart from the ' numberless seeds ', of which more will
be said later, the other ingredients listed can be reasonably explained by reference to the views of others of Anaxagoras' pre
decessors. There had in the past been two main types of pluralism.
There had been those who, like Anaximander, the Pythagoreans and Heraclitus, had in one way or another regarded the world as
a battlefield of the opposites; and there had been Empedocles, who had solidified the warring opposites into the four eternal and immutable elements. Neither type of pluralism, to Anaxagoras 5
mind, went far enough. His own original mixture must contain, not only the traditional opposites (of which the hot and the cold

are Anaximander's, the wet and the dry are also possibly his or possibly added from Heraclitus, while the bright and the dark are
presumably the Pythagorean 9065 and CTKOTOS (see 289)), nor only the Empedoclean elements (here probably exemplified by earth, because two of the others, air and aither (or fire), have already been mentioned as ingredients in 495) ; it must contain also ' innumerable seeds in no way like each other'.
1 Anaxagoras evidently followed Empedocles in accepting also the Parmenidean equation of the void with Not-being. Cf. 498 Aristotle

also Aristotle de caelo A 2, 309 a 19 (DK.59B68), where Aristotle groups Empedocles and Anaxagoras together as ( I ) denying the existence of the void, (2) giving no explanation of differences of weight.

There is good reason to suppose that in these two brief fragments
Anaxagoras is explicitly replying to Zeno. It is at any rate a striking coincidence that, of the only two of Zeno's arguments
498 Those who try to show that the void does not exist do not disprove what people really
mean by it, but argue erroneously; this is true of Anaxagoras and of those who refute the existence of the void in this way. They merely give an ingenious demonstration that air is
something by straining wine-skins and showing the resistance of the air, and by cutting it off in klepsydras. (After Hardie) 499 Neither is there a smallest part of what is small9 but there is always a smaller (for
it is impossible that what is should cease to be) . Likewise there is always something larger
than what is large. And it is equal in respect of number to what is small, each thing, in relation to itself, being both large and small.
500 And when these things have been thus separated, we must know that all things are neither more nor less (for it is not possible that there should be more than all), but all things
are always equal.

likely that, when Anaxagoras echoes them both so exactly as he
does, he is doing so quite deliberately. 500 is of comparatively little importance. Zeno's argument had been directed against the Pythagorean confusion between the units
of arithmetic, the points of geometry and the atoms of physics. Any
physical body, according to the Pythagoreans, consisted of a number of units; and, since units are by definition indivisible, the
number attaching to any finite body is itself necessarily finite.
But if units are also geometrical points, then, since geometrical space is by definition infinitely divisible, the number is at the same time infinite. Anaxagoras' reply is a direct contradiction:
even though, as he has said in 495, things are aireipa Kai TrAfjOos Kai aiaiKpoTrjTa, they are still 'no more and no less than they are'.
It is 499 which contains the important part of Anaxagoras' reply to Zeno. Zeno's argument in 501 had again been aimed
primarily at the Pythagorean confusion of units, points and atoms: since every physical body consists of an infinite number of points,
it must, if those points have magnitude, be infinitely large, and, if they have no magnitude, have none itself either. The conse
quences of Zeno's arguments were, as Cornford pointed out (Plato and Parmenides 60-1), twofold: 'the first was reflected in the separation of arithmetic from geometry; . . .the second. . .was the
distinction between the geometrical solid and the sensible body,
which the Pythagoreans had confused .... The atomists, Leucippus and Democritus, saw that, if physical bodies need not have all the
properties of geometrical solids, they could elude Zeno's dilemmas.
They could reply: "We grant that all geometrical magnitudes are infinitely divisible and that a geometrical point has no parts or

of geometry, but compact bodies, which, if they were large enough, you could see and touch. ..." . . .The atom thus ceased to be
confused with the unit of number and the point of geometry, and
became a purely physical body whose essential property was
impenetrability.' The answer of Leucippus and Democritus was
not, however, the only possible answer to Zeno: it could equally easily have been granted that physical matter, like geometrical magnitude, was infinitely divisible. This, as is evident from 499, is
the answer that Anaxagoras chose to give. 'I grant', he means,
'that physical matter, like geometrical magnitude, is infinitely divisible ; but physical matter composes sensible bodies, and since sensible bodies exist and have magnitude, the same must be true of physical matter. However far you subdivide matter [Zeller's
reading TOjjirj for TO jjif] is attractive], you can never reduce it to
sheer nothingness ; even the smallest imaginable particle must still
possess some magnitude. In consequence each thing is indeed both great and small : great because it contains an infinite number of parts, and small because those parts are themselves of an infinite
simal smallness.' Anaxagoras' theory of matter is in fact deli
berately adopted, like that of the atomists, as an answer to Zeno ; and when that answer is added to his answer to Parmenides, one
half of the basis of his system is now complete. He is enabled, by
his beliefin the infinite divisibility of matter, to devise a cosmogony and to give an account of change which does indeed eliminate the forbidden coming-into-being of what was not.

for in everything there is a portion of everything, as I said earlier; and the things that were mingled with it would hinder it so that it could control nothing in the same way as it does

For it is the finest of all things and the purest, it has all knowledge about everything and the greatest power; and mind controls all things, both the greater and the smaller, that have life. Mind controlled also the whole rotation, so that it began to rotate in the beginning.

And the things that are mingled and separated and divided off, all are known by Mind. And all things that were to be, all things that were but are not now, all things that are now or that shall be, Mind arranged them all, including this rotation in which are now rotating the stars, the sun and moon, the air and the aither that are being separated off. And this rotation caused the separating off.
And the dense is separated offfrom the rare, the hotfrom the cold, the bright from the dark and the dry from the moist. But there are many portions of many things, and nothing is

Another Parmenidean demand with which Anaxagoras had to comply was that motion should not be simply taken for granted
but explained. In place of Empedocles' Love and Strife (moral
and psychological forces expressed in corporeal terms, see 424) Anaxagoras substitutes the single intellectual motive force of Mind. It too, like Love and Strife, has many of the qualities of an abstract
principle.
c It has all knowledge about everything, and the greatest strength; it controls all things that have life 5
; and 'it set in order
all things that were to be', including, of course, the cosmic revolution. Yet at the same time it is ' the finest of all things and the
purest' ; it is * all alike, both the larger and the smaller quantities' ; and though it is 'mixed with nothing', it is none the less present
'there, where everything else is, in the surrounding mass, and in what has been united and separated off'. Anaxagoras in fact is striving, as had several of his predecessors, to imagine and describe
a truly incorporeal entity. But as with them, so still with him, the only ultimate criterion of reality is extension in space. Mind, like
everything else, is corporeal, and owes its power partly to its
fineness, partly to the fact that it alone, though present in the mixture, yet remains unmixed.
How Mind imparted the first rotatory movement is by no means obvious; it may be that even Anaxagoras himself had no clear
mental picture of the process. It appears, however, that the area
affected was at first small but is still steadily increasing. The speed of the revolution is immense, and therefore its effect on the original
mixture is very powerful (505). The immediate consequence is
progressive separation: the moment the rotation takes in a new
their rotation) . And the speed creates theforce. Their speed is like the speed of nothing that now exists among men, but it is altogether many times as fast. 506 But Mind, which ever is, is assuredly even now where everything else is too, in the
surrounding mass and in the things that have been either aggregated or separated.

ANAXAGORAS
area, as it is doing all the time, the ingredients of that area begin at once to separate off (504). It is in fact the rotation which is
directly responsible for the separation, which leads in turn to cosmogony. Mind, having initiated the rotation, remains alone
ultimately responsible; but at the same time, as is evident from the statement at the end of 504, once the original motion has been
imparted, purely mechanical factors begin to operate and the agency of Mind itself becomes less direct. This is a feature of
Anaxagoras' system which, to the irritation of Plato and Aristotle
(see 522 and note), becomes more pronounced as his cosmogony
proceeds.
With the introduction of Mind the basis of the system is
complete. Anaxagoras is, like Empedocles, in a sense a dualist;
and his dualism is, for the first time, in a sense a dualism of Mind and matter. 1 But both members of this dualism are peculiar.
Mind, like matter, is corporeal and owes its power over matter to
its fineness and purity. Matter itself, so far from being pure, is
originally at least an infinitely divisible mixture of every form of substance that the world is ultimately to contain.

507 Such being their theory, Anaxagoras would appear to make his material principles infinite, but the cause of motion and coming into being one only, namely Mind. But if we
were to suppose that the mixture of all things was a single substance, indefinite both inform
and in extent, then itfollows that he is really affirming two first principles only, namely the substance of the infinite and Mind.
508 And since the portions of the great and of the small are equal in number, so too all
things would be in everything. Nor is it possible that they should exist apart, but all things have a portion of everything. Since it is not possible that there should be a smallest part,
nothing can be put apart nor come to be all by itself, but as things were originally, so they

These two fragments say what they want to say briefly, emphatically and, one might have thought, clearly. 508 tells us that, as in
the original mixture, so now in everything, of whatever size, that
is being separated off, all things are together; while 509, by its
addition of the words *rrAf)v vou, drives home the point that, just as the original mixture contained not only the traditional opposites and the Empedoclean elements but 'countless seeds' as well, so
now everything contains a portion of everything except Mind. That
is unquestionably what Anaxagoras himself says; and he repeats it more than once in a later fragment which has already been
quoted, 503. Those who maintain, as the majority of recent
commentators do, that when Anaxagoras said: 'in everything there is a portion of everything' he can only have meant that in
everything there is a portion of all the opposites, can only do so at the expense of accusing Anaxagoras of saying what he did not mean. It is surely inconceivable that any Greek, let alone a
practised thinker like Anaxagoras, should have written ev TTCCVTI
TTOCVTOS (Jioipa VEOTI if by TTCCVTOS he really meant to signify something quite different from TTCCVT{. Whatever TTCCVTI and TTOCVTOS are or are not intended to include, it must in fairness to Anaxagoras
be assumed that they include the same things. And that those
things comprise other things than the opposites seems to follow inevitably from a comparison of fr. 6, 508, with fr. 4, 496.
When Anaxagoras adds at the end of 509 that there are some
things also in which Mind is present, the statement is to be compared with that other sentence in 503 which tells us that
Mind controls everything that has life. If there are some things
in which Mind is present, there are obviously other things in
which it is not. Mind is presumably therefore to be imagined as
discontinuously distributed throughout the world in living things ;
must be now too, all together. In all things there are many ingredients, equal in number in the greater and in the smaller of the things that are being separated off.
509 In everything there is a portion of everything except Mind; and there are some things
in which there is Mind as well.

ANAXAGORAS
which would explain how Anaxagoras could speak, as he does near the end of 503, of 'both the greater and the smaller
quantities
5 of it.
'SEEDS' AND 'PORTIONS'
The chief problem in any reconstruction which assumes that Anaxagoras meant what he said is to determine the relation of the
OTrepucrroc of 496 to the laolpcu of 503, 508 and 509. If Anaxagoras really believed (and this at least is never disputed) in the infinite
divisibility of matter, how is it that there are already 'seeds'
present in the original mixture? To answer this crucial question,
it will be easiest first to consider what precisely Anaxagoras means by the word (Jiolpoc and only then to consider why the 'seeds' need be introduced at all.
uoipcc is not, of course, in the way in which cmip|jia is, employed by Anaxagoras as a semi-technical term; but for all that, he seems to have used the word in a sense that requires careful consideration.
An Anaxagorean noipcc is a 'portion' in the sense of a 'share'
rather than of a 'piece' or 'particle'. The essential characteristic of such a 'portion' seems to be that it is something which neither in theory nor in practice can ever be actually reached and separated out from that which contains it. However far you may subdivide matter, and however infinitesimal a piece of it you may
thereby reach, Anaxagoras will always reply, exactly as Zeno would have replied of a geometrical line, that so far from being irreducible, it still contains an infinite number of 'portions'. This
indeed is precisely the nature of Anaxagoras' reaction to Zeno; and it is probably what he means when he says in 508 that ' the portions of the great and of the small are equal in number'. Both
the infinitely great and the infinitesimally small alike contain an infinite number of 'portions'. In effect, of course, such a theory
is indistinguishable from a theory of fusion such as Bailey (Greek Atomists and Epicurus, App. I) attributes to Anaxagoras; but it
remains, as a theory, widely different. Neither of the illustrations
that are usually cited, the analogy of the mixture of liquids such as water and wine and that of the mixture of grains such as those
of sugar and sand, is at all adequate to the theory. The only
satisfactory analogy is that suggested by the influence of Zeno, the analogy of the infinite number of points in even the shortest line.
By that analogy alone can we see how Anaxagoras, despite the
377



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
infinite divisibility of matter, could still maintain that even the
infinitesimally small contained a 'portion' of everything.
Unfortunately, the objection can be brought against such a theory and indeed it has been brought by both ancient and
modern critics that in that case Anaxagoras' cosmogony is based
upon a vicious regress. It is not, as a matter of fact, by any means certain that Anaxagoras himself would have regarded such a regress as undesirable. The very notion of an infinite regress was a new one, dating only from the time of Zeno, and it seems in no way improbable that Anaxagoras should have seen in it a welcome escape from Parmenides' denial of coming-into-being. But in any case Anaxagoras has an answer to his critics. As is evident from the fact that there is already an infinite number of 'seeds' in the
original mixture, matter naturally tends, however infinitely divisible it may be, to coagulate into 'seeds', and there is therefore a natural unit of matter from which cosmogony can begin. So, it
seems, Anaxagoras evaded the dilemma. On the one hand,
certainly, the infinite regress must be retained : it is the only way
in which there can be a 'portion' of everything in everything, and so both coming-into-being and change can be effectually elimi
nated. On the other hand, equally certainly, this same infinite regress must be somehow at least momentarily halted so that Anaxagoras can start moving in the opposite direction towards the
building up of the sensible world. It is at this point that the ' seeds '
(an appropriate word, since a seed is that from which larger things develop) have an essential part to play in the system.

Unfortunately the only two surviving sentences of Anaxagoras himself that give us any clue concerning the composition of the 'seeds' are those in 510 and 511; and of these the latter may well
represent, not Anaxagoras' own exact words, but a paraphrase by
such changes, Anaxagoras a single series. Anaxagoras again posited an infinity of principles, namely the homoeomerous substances and the opposites together, while Empedocles posits only the so-called 'elements'. The theory of Anaxagoras that the principles are infinite in number was probably due to his acceptance of the common opinion of the physicists that nothing comes into beingfrom not-being. For this is the reason why they use the phrase ' all things were together', and the coming into being of such and such a kind of thing is reduced to change of quality, while others speak of combination and separation. Moreover, the fact that the opposites proceedfrom each other led them to the same conclusion. The one,
they reasoned, must have already existed in the other; for since everything that comes into being must arise eitherfrom what is orfrom what is not, and it is impossible for it to arise
from what is not (on this point all the physicists agree), they thought that the truth of the alternative necessarily followed, namely that things come into being out of existent things, i.e. out of things already present, but imperceptible to our senses because of the smallness of their bulk. So they assert that everything is mixed in everything, because they saw every
thing arising out of everything. But things, as they say, appear different from one another and receive different names according to the nature of the thing that is numerically predominant among the innumerable constituents of the mixture. For nothing, they say, is purely and entirely white or black or sweet orflesh or bone, but the nature of a thing is held to be that of which it contains the most. (After Hardie)

PRESOCRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
the scholiast on Gregorius Nazianzenus who preserves the argu
ment. At this point, therefore, we are compelled to invoke secondary sources. But at least our secondary authorities (one of
whom, Simplicius, certainly had Anaxagoras' book before him) are unanimous in attributing to Anaxagoras the views voiced by Aristotle in 512. It is fairly evident from 510, where the 'seeds' are said to have diverse colours and tastes, that some at least of the opposites, such
as bright and dark or sweet and bitter, were actually ingredients in the ' seeds '
; and there can be little doubt that Aristotle is there
fore right when he attributes to Anaxagoras the general argument that, since opposites 'come out of one another' since, in other words, a thing becomes hotter from having been cooler and vice versa they must have been present in one another all the time. But that docs not seem to be, as it is sometimes taken to be, the end
of the matter. 511 equally suggests, if somewhat less directly, that natural substances arc on an equal footing with the opposites. For if hair cannot come from what is not hair nor flesh from what is
not flesh, hair and flesh too, just like the opposites, must have been
there all the time. Again, moreover, this inference is supported by
Aristotle; for in the last sentence of 512, in the list of examples of
the things the predominance of which determines the apparent character of a whole body, there appear, besides the opposites,
white, black and sweet, the natural substances, flesh and bone. The ' seeds ' in fact contain, like the original mixture in which they
were present, not only the opposites, nor only natural substances,
but both together. It is significant that Aristotle should so often, as he does in 512,
compare and contrast Empedocles and Anaxagoras. Anaxagoras seems to have felt, as has already become evident from the list of
the ingredients of the original mixture in 496, that Empedocles had not gone far enough. If everything consisted solely of the four elements, then in putting together the four elements in different
proportions to form, say, flesh or bone, Empedocles had not, to Anaxagoras' mind, succeeded in eliminating the coming-intobeing of something new. The only way to do that was to posit in everything the presence ab initio of everything which might emerge from it. Since there was no end to the apparent changes that might
take place in the world, there must be, not only in the original mixture as a whole but in every constituent 'seed', a 'portion'
380

not only of all the opposites but of every natural substance as well. In that way alone can hair and flesh come from the wheat which nourishes them without the coming-into-being of something new.

This fragment should be compared with the last few sentences of
503 (beginning KCC! cnroKpiveToci), where, incidentally, it is to be noted that Ariaximenes' pair of opposites, the rare and the dense, are added to those of Anaximander and the Pythagoreans. The two passages together are often taken, along with those in the next
section, as indicating that Anaxagoras did indeed regard the opposites as primary elements of superior status to natural substances. It seems more likely, however, in view of the evidence to
the contrary, that he merely regarded the opposites as providing the best illustration of his general theory that ' in everything there
is a portion of everything'. Heraclitus had already shown that one of a pair of opposites cannot exist without the other; while the very fact that they are opposites means that the existence of a close relation between them, whatever it may be, is more obvious than in the case of such substances as, say, gold and flesh. Indeed a
particular argument which Anaxagoras is said to have used, the paradox that snow must really be black,1 may well be no more than a later distortion of a statement to the effect that there is a
*
portion' of 'the black' in snow. But even though the opposites
do unquestionably, for this reason, figure very prominently in the
fragments, the evidence still seems to suggest that, just as the hot
and the cold cannot be cut off from one another with a hatchet, so
are flesh, hair, gold, and every other natural substance equally inseparable one from another.

515 suggests that in the progressive separation caused by the rotation the first things to emerge were air and aithcr (or fire). 1
There is, however, a difficulty here. We have already been told, in the opening sentences of the book, 495, that in the original
mixture c nothing was visible because of its smallness; for air and
aither, both being infinite, held all things in subjection
'
. Why, then, if air and aither are already distinguished in the original mixture, do they need to be separated off when the rotation begins? There
seems to be only one satisfactory answer to that question, which, however, will only emerge from an examination of 516.

The opposites, as we have already seen, exist in the form of 'portions' in the c seeds 5
, each 'seed' being characterized by that
515 For air and aither are being separated off from the surrounding mass, which is infinite in number.
516 The dense and the moist and the cold and the dark came together here, where the earth now is, while the rare and the hot and the dry went outwards to thefurther part of the aither.
517 From these things, as they are separated off, the earth is solidified; for water is separated offfrom the clouds, earth from water, andfrom earth stones are solidified by the cold; and stones tend to move outwards more than water.
518 Anaxagoras employs this name (i.e. aither) incorrectly. For he speaks of aither in place offire.

ANAXAGORAS
of which it has most in it. When, therefore, 516 tells us that ' the dense, the moist, the cold and the dark came together where the earth now is', it means that the 'seeds' in which there was a preponderance of the dense, the moist, the cold and the dark over their respective opposites tended towards the centre of the rotation.
They obeyed, in other words, two laws which Anaxagoras seems to have regarded as virtually axiomatic, the attraction of like to
like and the tendency of the heavy to the centre, of the light to the circumference of a whirl. 1 The Empedoclean elements were not
to Anaxagoras primary substances, but rather mixtures of 'seeds' of all sorts.2 At this stage in cosmogony at least, earth is earth
rather than anything else simply because of the predominance in its constituent 'seeds' of the dense and the rest over their opposites.
Aither, on the other hand, consists of 'seeds' that are characterized
by the rare, the hot and the dry. All that is happening, therefore, at this very early stage in the world's evolution is that the 'seeds' that are characterized by the same combination of opposites are
tending together towards their appropriate place in the universe.

519 Theophrastus says that the theory of Anaxagoras resembles that of Anaximander; for Anaxagoras says that, in the dividing up of the infinite, things of a like kind tend together, and what was gold or earth in the original whole becomes gold and earth respectively.
520 Mind, he says, initiates motion, and heavy bodies occupy the lower position, light bodies the upper .
521 Anaxagoras and Empedocles hold opposite views on the elements. Empedocles holds thatjire and the rest of the list are the elements of bodies and that everything is made up of these; but Anaxagoras opposes this. He maintains that the homoeomerous substances (e.g. flesh, bone and so on) are the elements, while air or fire are mixtures of these and all
other seeds; each of them is an aggregation of all the homoeomerous substances, which,

But if that is so, then the problem raised by the comparison of fr. i, 495, with fr. 2, 515, is easily solved. All that the crucial sentence in fr. i is intended to tell us is that, in Cornford's words
(CQ, 24 (1930) 25), 'Aether and Air are merely collective names for the sets of hotter and colder (etc.) Seeds respectively. Both sets exist in the Mixture, and indeed together make up the whole
Mixture; but originally they were completely jumbled together
and coextensive.' Fr. 2, on the other hand, describes how these
sets of 'seeds', originally completely intermingled, began to be separated one from the other to form two distinctive masses.
Anaxagoras, true to his Ionian upbringing, has in fact allowed the traditional opposites, even though they are now reduced to the status of 'portions' in 'seeds' and are therefore on an equal footing with natural substances, to retain their traditional part in cosmogony; and at the same time he has found a place in his
system for the Empedoclean elements. 1
1 This is another illustration of the way in which the responsibility of
Mind becomes less direct as cosmogony proceeds. It is clearly the ground
for Socrates' famous criticism of Anaxagoras' use of Mind in PhaedoyjBff. Gf. especially 522 Plato Phaedo 98157 (DK5QA47) oor6 6ri 0avnacn-fj$

So Anaxagoras5 cosmogony is launched; and the process begun in 515 and 516 is continued in 517. First air, which is at this stage
the opposite of aither, is solidified into clouds; from clouds comes water ; from water comes earth ; and finally from earth are solidified
stones. Not only is like continuing to be attracted by like, but also, evidently, the pressure at the centre of the rotation (cf. the PITJ of
505) is compressing the 'seeds' into ever more solid bodies. Of
the ingredients in the 'seeds' it is still apparently the opposites that
however , are invisible. For this reason everything comes into beingfrom these two (fire and
aither being in Anaxagoras synonymous). 522 From this wonderful hope, myfriend, I was at once cast down: as I went ahead and read the book Ifound a man who made no use at all of Mind, nor invoked any other real causes to arrange the world, but explained things by airs and aithers and waters and many other absurdities.
384



ANAXAGORAS
are the operative factor : stones are solidified from earth under the
agency of the cold. But by now the opposites have fulfilled their
main function; from now onwards their place will be largely taken by the substances with which they are mixed in the 'seeds'.

This passage and others like it, along with fr. 10 (511), suggest
that Anaxagoras was particularly interested in the problem of nutrition. His general principles, 'a portion of everything in everything' and the attraction of like to like, provide him with a simple solution so simple, indeed, that he may well have arrived
at those general principles from consideration of this very problem. For though there are certain inevitable differences of detail, the analogy between macrocosm the world in which we live and microcosm the individual living thing is in Anaxagoras
especially plain.
523 Anaxagoras of Clazomenae, son of Hegesiboulos, held that the fast principles of things were the homoeomeries. For it seemed to him quite impossible that anything should come into being from the non-existent or be dissolved into it. Anyhow we take in nourishment that is simple and homogeneous, such as bread or water, and by this are nourished hair,
veins, arteries, flesh, sinews, bones and all the other parts of the body. Which being so, we must agree that everything that exists is in the nourishment we take in, and that everything derives its growth from things that exist. There must be in that nourishment some parts that
are productive of blood, some of sinews, some of bones, and so on parts which reason alone can apprehend. For there is no need to refer thefact that bread and water produce all these
things to sense-perception; rather, there are in bread and water parts which only reason can
apprehend.
25 385 K*R



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Bread and water, like all other substances, consist of c
seeds'; and each of those 'seeds' contains a 'portion' of everything. (It is
true, of course, that bread is not a natural substance, while water, as we have already seen, is a collection of 'seeds' of every sort; but
if we substitute wheat, which is a natural substance, for the bread
which both Actius and Simplicius actually cite, it makes no
difference to the argument.) When the bread (or wheat) is eaten, it is presumably broken up into its constituent ' seeds '
; and since
these are themselves infinitely divisible, some of them at least will probably be broken down, by the processes of mastication and digestion, into still smaller seeds. Thereupon those seeds in which
flesh predominates proceed, by the attraction of like to like, to join the flesh of the body, hair joins hair, and so on. But since no such
thing as a particle of pure substance can ever exist, the flesh from the bread that goes to join the flesh of the body must always carry
with it a 'portion' of everything else, and so ensures that the flesh, like the loaf, will continue to contain a '
portion
' of everything. Meanwhile, of course, those ingredients in the loaf that are
irrelevant to nutrition, copper, for instance, or cork, 1 are for the most part that is, all except the few '
portions
' which are carried
to join the flesh or hair of the body eliminated by the digestive
processes.
1 The examples are CornforcTs. Commenting on this passage from Actius, he writes (CQ, 24 (1930) 20) :
' Corn feeds flesh and bones; therefore it contains particles of flesh and bone. It does not nourish silver or rubies; so why should it contain particles of these? . . . There is no motive here for
asserting " a portion of every substance" in bread or corn or any other food as
such. The assertion would be gratuitous as well as absurd.' But the argument that the contention * a portion of everything in everything
' is
absurdly uneconomical, true as it may be in one way, overlooks the fact,
on which comment has already been made above (pp. 380 f.), that it is at least economical of effort. It would have been an unending task for Anaxagoras to determine what could and what could not come from what; and it is perhaps characteristic of Presocratic dogmatism that, rather than
face that unending task, he should simply have asserted, as we have seen he several times did, 'a portion of everything in everything*.
HOMOEOMERIES
Three of the passages already quoted have used one or other of the
words 6iJioiouepfj or onoio^peicu ('homoeomeries' or 'things with
like parts'). None of these passages comes from Anaxagoras him
self; two, 512 and 521, come from Aristotle; one, 523, to which
386



ANAXAGORAS
many parallels could be found in Simplicius and others, comes
from Aetius. It is actually very unlikely that Anaxagoras himself ever used either word; what the later commentators called
duoiouepeioci, he himself seems to have called 'seeds'. Aristotle,
who was probably the first to apply the phrase TOC onoio^epfj to the theories of Anaxagoras, seems at least to have used it consistently. But in the later writers the precise meaning of either term is open
to question. Perhaps the most significant of the passages in Aristotle is that
at the beginning of 512 in which he tells us that Anaxagoras
regarded as primary elements both the opposites and TOC o^oionepii,
'the things with like parts'. Now Aristotle frequently uses the
phrase TOC oiaoiojjiepfj for his own purposes : TOC 6pioio|Jiep
<n in his own
system were natural substances, such as flesh or bone, metals, or
the four elements, every part of which, in his own view, was exactly like the whole. It seems hardly likely that, when he used the phrase in connexion with the theories of Anaxagoras, he should
have used it in a different sense. What 512 therefore tells us is that
Anaxagoras regarded both the opposites and natural substances as primary elements. It is true that elsewhere in Aristotle, as in 521, the homoeomerous substances appear alone as the primary elements of Anaxagoras; but that after all does not contradict the fuller statement in 512. Our own reconstruction of Anaxagoras'
system suggests that the fuller statement is correct. For in that system as reconstructed the opposites and the natural substances
do indeed together comprise the '
everything' of which everything contains a 'portion'. Even if, therefore, the strictest possible
interpretation is placed upon the phrase TOC ouoioiaepfj in Aristotle, that still does not in the slightest degree undermine any arguments adduced in earlier sections of this chapter. It may be that
Aristotle uses the phrase in a sense which Anaxagoras himself would not have allowed ; whatever the natural substances were or
were not in Anaxagoras' system, they were certainly not, as they were in Aristotle's own, homogeneous. But that does not invalidate the truth of the statement that in the system of Anaxagoras the primary elements were the opposites and the natural substances
together. Only in the later writers, when the term 6noioupicc creeps in alongside T<X 6uoiojJiepfi, does the problem become more compli
cated. It is evident from, for instance, Lucretius i, 830 (DK 59 A 44)
387 *5-2



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
that the word 6|aoio^peia had by now become a catchword that
was almost automatically applied to Anaxagoras' physical theories; and it seems very probable that many of those who used
it did so without understanding its exact significance. 1 Simplicius, thanks to his familiarity with Anaxagoras' book, is probably our safest guide as to its correct usage. In the passages of Simplicius
where either TCC oiJioiojjiepfj or 6[Jioionepeicci figure, the former can always be understood in the sense in which Aristotle used it, whereas the latter can usually, if not always, be taken to mean the
'seeds'. The fact is, of course, that the problem is somewhat academic. Not only did Anaxagoras himself apparently never use
the words, but also, whatever interpretation be put upon them
(except only the impossible interpretation of homogeneity), there is no difficulty in fitting them into the system as reconstructed.
But if we have to speculate on why Anaxagoras' 'seeds' came to be
called 6noiouepicu, then the most likely explanation is that, since every 'seed' contains a 'portion' of everything, not only every individual 'seed' but also everything composed of 'seeds' will, in
a very real sense, contain similar 'portions'.
1 Aetius, e.g., is clearly uncertain of the exact implications of the word
6noionepioc. 523 continues thus: 524 Aetius i, 3, 5 (DK5QA46) dir6

SUMMARY OF THE PHYSICAL SYSTEM
Before proceeding to certain special doctrines, it will be as well to add a few last observations on the above reconstruction of the basis
of Anaxagoras' system. The problem which faced Anaxagoras was, of course, exactly
the same as faced the atomists. He had to give an account of the origin of the world without either deriving a plurality from an
original unity, or allowing the coming-into-being or change of anything real, or, finally, confusing geometrical space with physical matter. Given the same problem, the two solutions could
hardly have been more different. Whereas Anaxagoras made
matter, like magnitude, infinitely divisible, the atomists main
524 Since9 therefore, the nourishment contains parts that are like the things which it producesy he called them homoeomeries and said that they were thefirst principles ofexisting
things. . ..
388



ANAXAGORAS
tained that it was composed of indivisible minima; and whereas
Anaxagoras eliminated both coming-into-being and the derivation of plurality from unity by postulating ab initio an infinite
variety of substances, the atomists regarded all substance as
absolutely homogeneous and accounted for the apparent variety of phenomena by mere differences of shape, size, position and
arrangement. Both solutions are full of ingenuity, in outline and
in detail. But for all their ingenuity, and for all the difference between them, they are each the outcome as much of the Eleatic paradox as of the inventiveness of their respective authors.

Many scholars have maintained, on the strength of 525, that
Anaxagoras must have believed in a plurality of contemporary worlds. Yet some of the ancient evidence seems to suggest that he believed in one world only. Admittedly Aetius at one point (n, 4,
6, DK.59A65) lists Anaxagoras among those who held that the
world was perishable, thereby suggesting that he believed in a succession of worlds; but Aetius, as was shown in the case of Anaximander (p. 124), was confused on this issue, and elsewhere (n, i, 2, DK59A63) lists Anaxagoras instead among those who
believed in one world only. Simplicius is probably our most
reliable witness, since he certainly had the relevant part of Anaxagoras' book before him; and though elsewhere in his
commentary on the Physics (e.g. 154, 29, DK59A64) he speaks of
Anaxagoras' world in the singular, that need mean no more than that he was there concerned only with the world we know. 1 526
gives us his considered view, and clearly acknowledges his un
certainty on the point. It is perhaps just possible that, as Cornford maintained, Anaxagoras is referring in 525, not to other worlds, but to distant and unknown parts of this earth's surface, comparable with the 'hollows in the earth' in the myth in Plato's Phaedo
(logAff.). But since the question was anyhow not for Anaxagoras (as it was for the atomists, see p. 412) one which arose inevitably from his first principles and consequently demanded a definite
answer, it seems wisest to follow the guidance of Simplicius in 526
and leave the question open.
1 Aristotle's remarks about Anaxagoras at, e.g., Phys. A 4, i8ja2^ff. 9 1, 25obi8fF., though they have been used as evidence that Anaxagoras believed in only one world, are either so generalized that they are of little value as evidence on this particular question, or else suggest only that in Aristotle's opinion Anaxagoras regarded this world (irrespective of the existence of others) as imperishable.
he mean that they are now inhabiting other regions of the same world as our own. For he did not say
*
they have the sun and the moon just as we too have' but 'sun and moon> as we have ' as if he were talking of a different sun and moon. But it is debatable whether or not these considerations are valid.

(6) The sun, the moon and all the stars are red-hot stones which the rotation of the aither carries round with it. Beneath the stars
are certain bodies, invisible to us, that are carried round with the sun and moon. (7) We do not feel the heat of the stars because they are so farfrom the earth; moreover, they are not as hot as the sun because they occupy a colder region. The moon is beneath the sun and nearer to us. (8) The sun exceeds the Peloponnese in size. The moon has not any light of its own but derives it from the sun. The stars in their revolution pass beneath the earth.

527 and 528 are included mainly to show that Anaxagoras did indeed concern himself with the usual astronomical and meteoro
logical questions. It is from the long passage of which 529 is a part that we get most of our information on the subject; and 529 for
the most part speaks for itself. Clearly Anaxagoras' astronomy is
much more rational than most of his predecessors', especially perhaps the view that the sun, moon and stars are huge incan
descent stones. There is a story preserved by Diogenes Laertius 1
and Pliny that Anaxagoras predicted the fall of the large meteorite which fell at Acgospotami in 467 B.C. (cf. p. 439). Certainly this event caused a considerable stir; and though the suggestion that
Anaxagoras predicted it is absurd, it may well have contributed
towards his belief that the heavenly bodies were made of stone.
It is because of their solidity, as 517 has already suggested, that they were originally thrown off from the earth at the centre of the cosmic revolution to take up their positions nearer the periphery.
Presumably meteorites are heavenly bodies which, despite the speed of the revolution which normally keeps them aloft, have been drawn back to the earth by the familiar tendency of the heavy to move towards the centre of the revolution.

531 is again quoted merely to show that Anaxagoras did include detailed doctrines in his book: its point presumably is that the white of an egg is the embryo's food. Several equally detailed
theories are attributed to him by the ancient authorities, including
Aristotle; but they are of no great importance for present purposes. The two most important of his biological theories are those in 532 and 533. In his belief that life originated in c the moist' he followed
Anaximander (see pp. 141 f.)> but the notion that it was brought down to the earth with the rain is curious. 1 All living things, of course, from plants at the bottom of the scale to man at the top,2
have a portion of Mind (see 503 and 509) . Before living things came into existence Mind was presumably dispersed evenly throughout the mixture ; but from the time when life originated it
evidently began to localize itself in living things, so that there are
now, according to 509, only ''some things in which there is Mind
also'.
1 This may be a development of the popular idea, exemplified in Aeschylus (see 26), that rain is the semen of Ouranos, by which Gaia is fertilized.

These three passages are all concerned with the senses, but otherwise they have little in common. 536, as we are told by Sextus
who preserved it, was concerned with imperceptible gradations of colour, arid its general point seems to have been that though our
senses show us what 'portions' predominate in a thing they are not adequate to reveal all the other '
portions
s which that thing must contain. 537, on the other hand (which may perhaps come from
a discussion of epistemology rather than of perception), suggests that from what we can see we are enabled to imagine also what we
cannot see. 538 contains only the most important excerpts from a detailed account of Anaxagoras' theories of perception. These few sentences suffice to show that in this field too Anaxagoras
marks an advance upon most of his predecessors. His theory may
have been developed in conscious opposition to thatofEmpedocles, who believed in perception of like by like (see 454) ; but the notion
that the perception of unlike by unlike is, as it were, an imper
ceptible pain is original and subtle.
537 Appearances are a glimpse of the obscure.
538 Anaxagoras thinks that perception is by opposites,for like is not affected by like
A thing that is as warm or as cold as we are does not either warm us or cool us by its approach, nor can we recognize sweetness or bitterness by their like; rather we know cold by warm,
fresh by salt and sweet by bitter in proportion to our deficiency in each. For everything, he says, is in us already. . . . Every perception is accompanied by pain, a consequence that would seem to follow from his hypothesis; for everything unlike produces pain by its contact; and the presence of this pain becomes clear either from too long a duration orfrom an excess of sensation.

The precise date of Archelaus is uncertain. Diogenes is almost
certainly wrong in saying that Archelaus first brought physical speculation to Athens; that distinction probably belongs to Anaxagoras. Likewise the statement that physical philosophy
ended with him is very dubious; 1 even Leucippus, let alone Democritus, was probably later than Archelaus. But the tradition that Archelaus was a pupil of Anaxagoras and teacher of Socrates is too well attested to be doubted,2 and it gives us at least an
approximate date. His importance lies chiefly in these distinguished associations; in comparison with either his master or his pupil his direct contribution to philosophy is very small. But he is of a certain interest as indicating the straits to which all but the
very greatest of the later physicists were driven in their search for
an original cosmology.
1 This is doubtless merely an instance of the passion for organizing history into 'Ages'. Socrates introduces the 'Age of Ethics', so the *Age of Physical Philosophy* must stop abruptly. 2 See 541, and also 54 ^S* L. 11, 23 "Icov S 6 XTos (see p. 302) xocl veov OVTCC (sc.

539 Archelaus, of Athens or else Miletus, son of Apollodorus or, according to some accounts, of Midon, was a pupil of Anaxagoras and teacher of Socrates; it was he who first transferred physical philosophy from Ionia to Athens, and he was called a physicist. Moreover, physical philosophy came to an end with him, owing to Socrates' introduction of ethics. Archelaus too seems to have touched upon ethical questions, for he speculated as well
about law, goodness and justice. 540 Ion of Chios says that in his youth Socrates went away with Archelaus to Samos.

541 Archelaus of Athens, the pupil of Anaxagoras with whom Socrates is said to have
associated, tries to introduce something original of his own into cosmogony and other subjects, but still gives the same fast principles as Anaxagoras had. Both hold that the fast principles are infinite in number and different in kind, and they posit the homoeomeries as principles 542 (i) Archelaus was by birth an Athenian, the son of Apollodorus. He believed in a material mixture like that of Anaxagoras and his fast principles were the same; but he maintained that from the outset there was a certain mixture immanent in Mind. (2) The origin of motion was the separation one from the other of the hot and the cold, of which the
former moves, the latter stays still. When water is liquefied itflows to the centre, and there it is burnt up to become air and earth, the former of which is borne upwards, while the latter takes up a position below. (5) For these reasons, then, the earth came into being, and lies
at rest in the centre, forming no appreciable fraction of the whole universe. { The air)
produced by the conflagration (controls the universe), and from its original combustion comes the substance of the heavenly bodies. Of these the sun is the biggest, the moon the
second, and of the rest some are smaller, some larger. (4) He says that the heavens are inclined, with the result that the sun gave light on the earth, made the air transparent, and the earth dry. For it was originally a marsh, being lofty around the edge and hollow in the

It would appear from these passages, which of course derive ultimately from Theophrastus, 1 that Archelaus took over the
system of Anaxagoras but at numerous points, some fundamental,
some superficial, made his own modifications or corrections. The
following are the most interesting features of the revised cosmology : (1) Mind. Whereas Mind in the system of Anaxagoras had been 'mixed with nothing' and had derived its power from its purity
(see 503), in Archelaus it seems to be deprived of its purity (542, i) 2 and therewith, perhaps, of its creative power. (2) Primary substance. Though some of the ancient authorities
suggest that Archelaus made air the primary substance (and one, Epiphanius, even that he chose earth), there can be little doubt that 541 and 542 preserve the most reliable tradition and that he
started, like Anaxagoras, with e seeds ' or ' homoeomeries '. Whereas,
however, Anaxagoras had made Mind initiate motion and so cause the separating off of * the dense, the moist, the cold and the dark' from 'the rare, the hot and the dry' (see 516), Archelaus
seems (though the evidence is conflicting: cf. DK6oAio and 18) to make the apparently automatic separation of the hot from the
middle. He adduces as aproofofthis hollowness the fact that the sun does not rise and set at the same time for all men, as would inevitably happen if the earth were flat. (5) On the subject of animals, he holds that when the earth was originally getting warm in the lower region, where the hot and the cold were mingled, many animals began to appear, including men, all with the same manner of life and all deriving their nourishmentfrom the
slime. These were short-lived; but later they began to be born from one another. (6) Men
were distinguished from animals, and established rulers, laws, crafts, cities and so on. Mind, he says, is inborn in all animals alike;for each of the animals, as well as man, makes use of Mind, though some more rapidly than others.

PRESOGRATIC PHILOSOPHERS
cold the cause of movement (542, 2). Thereby he exaggerates the
tendency in Anaxagoras, to which Plato so strongly objected (see
p. 384 n.) , to delegate the responsibility of Mind to the opposites. (3) The four world-masses. The method by which Archelaus brought the four world-masses into being from the opposites is somewhat obscure and very peculiar. Water seems to have been * melted' or 'liquefied' from 'the cold' in its interaction with 'the hot 5
(which suggests, perhaps, that 'the cold' was conceived of as ice), and when it thereupon flowed to the centre, it was 'burnt up', again in its interaction with 'the hot', to form earth and air.
The mobility of 'the hot' (i.e. fire), and the immobility of 'the cold' (i.e. perhaps ice, producing first water, and thence not only the stationary earth but also fluid air3), and the reaction between them, seem to constitute an essential and, so far as we can judge, an original feature of Archelaus' cosmogony.4 There is no obvious
motive for this revision of Anaxagoras except perhaps the desire to
bring the Empedoclean 'elements' into greater prominence. (4) fyogony. The zoogony of Archelaus seems to represent a reversion from that of Anaxagoras, in which seeds were carried down to earth with the rain (see 533), to that of Anaximander, in which 'living things arose from the moist element as it was
evaporated by the sun' (see 139).

4 This theory is extended in the Hippocratic de victu, an eclectic and very
superficial quasi-philosophical treatise written, probably, toward the end of the fourth century B.C.
CONCLUSION
In general, it is hard to resist the conclusion that Archelaus was
a second-rate thinker, motivated by the desire to revise the system
543 He holds that water is liquefied by the hot; and in so far as it comes together to the
lower region owing to thefiery element, itforms earth; in sofar as itflows around, it creates air.

of Anaxagoras by the inclusion of as many as possible of the
doctrines of his most eminent predecessors. From Anaximander
he borrowed, besides his biological theories, the primacy of the hot and the cold; from Anaximenes he apparently borrowed the doctrine of the condensation and rarefaction of air (see 143) ;
x
from Empedocles he seems to have taken the four 'elements 5
; and from Anaxagoras he inherited, with a number of modifications of detail such as that concerning the shape of the earth (542, 4),
almost everything else. It is hardly surprising that the resulting synthesis is lacking in great interest or importance.2

because he had said something to the effect that men were at first without laws or morals and had only attained to them in course of time (cf. 542, 6)) in a misguided attempt to credit the teacher of Socrates with a decent
minimum of ethical teaching.

546 Leucippus of Elea or Miletus (both accounts are current) had associated with Parmenides in philosophy, but in his view of reality he did not tread the same path as
Parmenides and Xenophanes, but rather, it seems, the opposite path. For while they regarded the whole as one, motionless, uncreated and limited and forbade even the search for what is not, he posited innumerable elements in perpetual motion namely the atoms and held that the number of their shapes was infinite, on the ground that there was no reason why any atom should be of one shape rather than another; for he observed too that coming-into-being and change are incessant in the world. Further he held that not-being
exists as well as being, and the two are equally the causes of things coming-into-being. The nature of atoms he supposed to be compact andfull; that, he said, was being, and it moved in the void, which he called not-being and held to exist no less than being. In the same way his associate Democritus of Abdera posited as principles the full and the void

Leucippus was generally agreed to have evolved his theory of atoms in answer to the Eleatic elenchus : so Aristotle in 552 below.
He was even assumed by late sources to have been an Eleatic;
according to Diogenes Laertius ix, 30 (DK67Ai) he was a pupil
of Zeno. This we need not believe : it is not suggested by Aristotle, and is the kind of thing which might easily be asserted by Sotion and the other succession-writers. Miletus is given as his alter
native birth-place; the a priori reasons for this are not so strong,
he instructed himself. He and Hermarchus both maintain that there never was a philosopher
Leucippus, who some (including Apollodorus the Epicurean) say was the teacher of Democritus.
548 Leucippus postulated atoms and void, and in this respect Democritus resembled him, though in other respects he was more productive.
549 Democritus, son of Hegesistratus (or by other accounts of Athenocritus or Damasippus), a citizen of Abdera or, as some say, of Miletus. . . . Later he met Leucippus and,
according to some, Anaxagoras also, whose junior he was by forty years . ... (41) As he himselfsays in the Little World-system, he was ayoung man in the old age ofAnaxagoras,
being forty yean younger. He says that the Little World-system was composed 730 years after the capture of Troy. He would have been born, according to Apollodorus in the Chronicles, in the eightieth Olympiad; according to Thrasylus, in his book entitled Preparation for reading the works of Democritus, in the third year of the seventyseventh, being one year (as he says) older than Socrates.

though he obviously revived some Milesian astronomical theories ;
it might therefore be true. He may of course have visited Elea,
but the Eleatic doctrines were known in Athens, and Melissus,
against whom Leucippus perhaps chiefly reacted, was an Ionian. Singularly little was known about Leucippus, in any case, and in 547 his very existence seems to be denied by Epicurus and
Hermarchus. But Epicurus is intent on proving his own origin
ality; Burnct (EGP^o n. 2) suggested that all Epicurus said was something like ASUKITTTTOV ou8' ei ysyovev oTScc, meaning ' I don't
consider Leucippus worth discussing'. Alternatively, the emphasis might have been on the word 9iA6cro9Ov : there was no philosopher
Leucippus (i.e. Leucippus was no philosopher). It is clear from 552 that Aristotle considered Leucippus to be the inventor of
atomism, and this is accepted also by Theophrastus in 546. Normally they write simply of *
Leucippus and Democritus', though certain elaborations, e.g. of the theory of perception, are
distinguished as Democritean. On the whole we might accept the assessment of Cicero in 548 ; all our other evidence seems to show
that the main theory was originated by Leucippus and accepted
by Democritus, who worked out the details and introduced a few
minor refinements. It would be very difficult here satisfactorily to
distinguish the two, especially since many post-Theophrastean sources ignore Leucippus; where distinctions are traceable they
will be pointed out. The doxographical passages mentioning
Leucippus are collected in DK chapter 67 : see also C. Bailey, The Greek Atomists and Epicurus, for a valiant attempt to distinguish the views of the two thinkers.
The date of Leucippus is not known independently, except from such guesses as that he was a pupil of Zeno. Democritus, however, evidently gave a clue to his own age in his work 'The Little
World-system': he was about forty years younger than Anaxagoras. This fits Apollodorus' date in 549 (born 460-457 B.C.) better than Thrasylus', of some ten years earlier. In any case, if
Democritus accepted 1184 B.C. as the year of the capture of Troy (and this, the Eratosthenic epoch-year, was merely the commonest of several dates), then the composition of the 'Little
World-system' (on which see the next section) would be placed too early, in 454. The probability is that it was written after 430.
Leucippus, presumably, was somewhat older, and his floruit (i.e. the composition of the 'Great World-system') might be put
402



ATOMISTS: LEUGIPPUS AND DEMOCRITUS
around 440-435. A possible terminus ante quern is provided by Theophrastus' statement (601) that Diogenes of Apollonia derived some of his ideas from Leucippus; for Diogenes was already parodied in the Clouds of 423 B.C. (617).

It is true that the 'Great World-system 3 is usually assigned to Democritus, since he was the elaborator of atomism and, apart
from Epicurus, its chief exponent. Epicurus himself would presumably have credited it to Democritus. But Theophrastus' opinion in 550 counts for much: Aristotle came from a city in
Thrace, and both he and his pupil Theophrastus devoted special works to Democritus. They were evidently aware of the distinction between Leucippus and Democritus, whereas it is natural that when the distinction became forgotten all early atomistic works
should be attributed to Democritus. We may therefore provi
sionally accept Theophrastus' view that Leucippus wrote the Mycc$ 8idKO(T|JUD$, Democritus the MiKpo$ BiocKoanos;1 with the
possible modification that the former may have been a com
pendium of Leucippus' cosmological work with other, later,
atomistic additions. One other work is attributed to Leucippus,
namely On Mind: the quotation from him by Aetius (568) is
assigned to this work, which may, of course, have been a section of the 'Great World-system'. The content of this fragment would
certainly not be foreign to that work, and might have formed part of an attack on the concept of Mind in Anaxagoras.
1 It seems probable that this work contained a description of the origin of civilization and culture, and that part of the description in Diodorus i, 7-8 (DK 6835,1) goes back to Democritus by way of Hecataeus of Abdera
550 Thrasylus listed his books in order by tetralogies, just as he did Plato's books.
(46) His ethical works comprised the following . . .. The physical books were these: The
Great World-system (which Theophrastus' followers say was by Leucippus), the Little
World-system, the Cosmography and On the planets
403 26-2

(see G. Vlastos, AJP 67 (1946) 51 if.). However, Diodorus certainly used
more than one Ionian source for this section, and it can be conceded that the account of cosmogony in i, 7 is not primarily atomistic.
Democritus, on the other hand, must have been one of the
most prolific of all ancient authors. Thrasylus (or Thrasyllus), who
arranged Plato's dialogues in tetralogies, did the same for Democritus according to 550 : there were thirteen tetralogies (comprising
fifty-two separate works, some no doubt quite short) divided
between the following general headings: Ethics (2 tetralogies), Physics (4)5 Mathematics (3), Music, including literature and language (2), Technical subjects (2). There were additional works
which were probably not genuine. 1 It is a tantalizing misfortune,
and a reflexion of later taste, that the considerable number of fragments that have survived (not all of which are certainly genuine) are nearly all taken from the ethical works.
1 Among the works classed as 'Yironv^iaocTo: and not included by Thrasylus (Diog. L. ix, 49, DK68A33) are five concerned with foreign travel, for
example a Ghaldaean and a Phrygian dissertation. The attribution is perhaps related to the many stories in our ancient biographical sources that Democritus travelled extensively: for example 55 1 Diog. L. ix, 35 <pr)al ArmTjTptos v 'OiJcovupois xccl 'AvTicrOevris v AiocSoxous <5aro8r|ufjcrai auTdv Kcd els ATyvnrrov Trp6s TO\>S tepeas yecopieTpiav ua0Tia6nevov Kal Trp6s XaASaiovs Els TT]V TTepaiSa, Kcci els Tfjv 'EpvOpav OdXaaaav yevteOai.

IXOsTv. Another story is that Xerxes left Ghaldaean overseers in Demo
critus5 father's household, from whom Democritus learned much. There may have been some basis in fact for these stories of foreign contact.
According to another anecdote Democritus said that he visited Athens, but that no one recognized him.

Aristotle plausibly regarded Leucippus' theory of indivisible particles moving in the void as an attempt to answer the Eleatic
dilemma. This had implied among other things that anything which is could not alter, since that would involve its becoming
what-is-not. Leucippus, it was held, agreed that such alterations of being were out of the question; but whereas the Eleatics had
rejected void as patently not-being, and had thus made motion (of which void was held to be a necessary pre-condition) impossible, Leucippus baldly accepted the existence of void, and so was able to explain variety and change by the accretion and separation of
distinct particles of real, fully existing stuff, which itself did not alter, but preserved the properties of Eleatic EOV. The idea that
apparent alteration consists, in fact, of the rearrangement of indestructible matter had already been reached by Empedocles,
and, in a particularly clear form, by Anaxagoras. The latter stated in fr. 17 (497) that 'no object comes-to-be or passes away, but is
mixed or separated from existing objects'. But Empedocles and
them. . . . But Leucippus thought he had a theory which, being consistent with sense
perception, would not do away with coming-into-being or perishing or motion or the multiplicity of things. So much he conceded to appearances, while to those who uphold the one he granted that motion is impossible without void, that the void is not-being and that
no part of being is not-being. For being, in the proper sense, is an absolute plenum. But such a plenum is not one, but there is an infinite number of them, and they are invisible owing to the smallness of their bulk. They move in the void (for the void exists), and by
their coming together they effect coming-into-being, by their separation perishing. 553 . . . But if it has changed, what is has passed away and what is not has come into being. So then, if there were a plurality, things would have to be ofjust the same nature as the one.
405



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Anaxagoras had continued to accept the Eleatic arguments about the impossibility of void ; though it is not clear that their ideas
about motion were entirely consistent with this position. 1 Further, an Eleatic could have objected, as Melissus did implicitly object in 384 and fr. 7, that different root-forms of matter did not meet
the arguments about TO eov being uniform; for if water, or a portion of flesh, for example, exists, then it might be argued that earth or bone, being different in some way at least, cannot exist. Leucippus,
then, postulated a truly uniform type of material being. In this he may well have been following out the consequence evolved by Melissus in 392 as an absurdity, from an argument about the fallacy of the senses, that if there are many things, and not the uniform Eleatic One, then the many must each possess the
properties of that One homogeneity, permanence, lack of internal change, and indivisibility.
1 Empedocles' theory of pores in the body actually presupposed the existence of the void which he formally denied, according to Aristotle de
gen. et con. A 8, 325 b i. See also n. 2 on p. 344.
The later accounts which make atomism a development of
Eleaticism, and Leucippus, for example, a pupil of Zeno, were probably derived from the Aristotelian assessment; cf. Theo
phrastus in 546. But this assessment is so plausible in itself that, even while admitting the tendency in Aristotle to over-schematize
the relations of his philosophical forebears, we may yet accept it.
Empedocles and Anaxagoras were unquestionably striving to overcome the Eleatic dilemma ; it is apriori probable that Leucippus too, since he indubitably dealt with the same kind of problems, devoted careful attention to the Eleatics. Melissus had suggested
a possible solution so clearly that it is difficult to believe that
Leucippus' support of this very solution was independent. At the same time Leucippus remained faithful to the principles of his probably Ionian background, since he was now enabled to revert
to a single material basis for phenomena. In the acceptance of void he was consciously correcting an Eleatic axiom.

void; they call them being and not-being respectively. Being is full and solid, not-being is void and rare. Since the void exists no less than body, itfollows that not-being exists no less than being. The two together are the material causes of existing things. And just as those
who make the underlying substance one generate other things by its modifications, and postulate rarefaction and condensation as the origin of such modifications, in the same way these men too say that the differences in atoms are the causes of other things. They hold that
these differences are three shape, arrangement and position; being, they say, differs only in
*
rhythm, touching and turning', of which 'rhythm' is shape,
'
touching' is arrangement and
'turning* is position; for A differs from N in shape, AN/rom NA in arrangement, and
X from H in position. 555 Democritus . . . calls space by these names * the void',
'
nothing', and ' the infinite ', while each individual atom he calls 'hing' [i.e. 'nothing' without 'not'}, the 'compact' and '
being '. He thinks that they are so small as to elude our senses, but they have all sorts
offorms and shapes and differences in size. So he is already enabled from them, as from elements, to create by aggregation bulks that are perceptible to sight and the other senses.
556 They (sc. Leucippus, Democritus, Epicurus) said that the first principles were infinite in number, and thought they were indivisible atoms and impassible owing to their

These passages (to which 546 should be added; there are several other similar but less concise descriptions in Aristotle and the
doxographers) state clearly enough the basis of the atomists' theory of matter. Full reality is assigned, as in the Milesian
tradition, to the corporeal; but the corporeal is fully corporeal and homogeneous, like the Eleatic *
sphere' of Being it contains no
void and no interstices, so cannot be divided (556) .* The atoms were so small as to be invisible (555) ; though Democritus might have allowed exceptions here (560) . They were indivisible in fact,
though not (since they had extension in space) in thought : in this way the old Eleatic argument against Pythagorean monads was
circumvented. The solid atoms, infinite in number and shape, 2
are scattered throughout infinite void, which is declared to exist : it is called 'that which is not', in Eleatic phraseology, but is asserted nevertheless to have existence of a sort (it must have, a priori, to allow movement and coalescence of the atoms; the
same preconception had been unconsciously adopted by Empe
docles, see n. on p. 406) .3 The existence of the void is distinct,
however, from the full corporeal existence of atoms. Aristotle in
555 is misleading when he calls the void 'space' ; the atomists had
no conception of bodies occupying space, and for them the void only exists where atoms are not, that is, it forms the gaps between them. The atoms differ from each other, not in matter, but only in
arrangement and shape: all 'qualitative' differences in objects (which are conglomerates of atoms), therefore, are dependent on quantitative and local differences alone.
1 This is probably Democritus' reason. Leucippus, according to a late doxographical source, held that the atoms were indivisible because of their smallness: 557 Galen de elem. sec. Hippocr. i, a (DK68A49) ocTrocOfj 8"

compactness) and without any void in them; divisibility comes about because of the void in compound bodies .. ..
557 They suppose their primary bodies to be impassible (some of them, e.g. Epicurus

school, regarding them as unbreakable because of their hardness, others, e.g. the school of Leucippus, as indivisible because of their smallness) ....

number of shapes of atoms infinite: 55^ Aristotle de gen. et corr. A 2,

Bailey, Greek Atomists 81, suggests that this relatively sophisticated type of argument (which is, of course, fallacious) is probably the product of Democritus rather than Leucippus.
Epicurus maintained that infinite shapes will eventually demand infinite sizes, and indeed Democritus may have suggested that some atoms are com
paratively large : $6o Dionysius ap. Eusebium P.E. xiv, 23, 3 TOOOVTOV

Aristotle in 552 asserted that Leucippus, and in 555 that Democritus, supposed all atoms to be invisible: possibly the latter passage is misleading. In any case Democritus is unlikely to have thought of anything larger than the specks of dust in a sunbeam; even those would be 'very large' in comparison with the vast

Hence arise innumerable worlds, and are resolved again into these elements. The worlds come into being as follows: many bodies of all sorts ofshapes move 'by abscission from the
infinite
9 into a great void; they come together there and produce a single whirl, in which, colliding with one another and revolving in all manner of ways, they begin to separate apart, like to like. But when their multitude prevents them from rotating any longer in
equilibrium, those that are fine go out towards the surrounding void as if sifted, while the rest * abide together
9
and, becoming entangled, unite their motions and make a first spherical structure. (32) This structure stands apart like a 'membrane* which contains in itself all kinds of bodies; and as they whirl around owing to the resistance of the middle,
the surrounding membrane becomes thin, while contiguous atoms keep flowing together owing to contact with the whirl. So the earth came into being, the atoms that had been borne
to the middle abiding together there. Again, the containing membrane is itself increased, owing to the attraction of bodies outside; as it moves around in the whirl it takes in anything it touches. Some of these bodies that get entangledform a structure that is atfirst moist and muddy, but as they revolve with the whirl of the whole they dry out and then ignite to form the substance of the heavenly bodies.
563 Leucippus and Democritus envelop the world in a circular 'cloak' or 'membrane 9

which was formed by the hooked atoms becoming entangled.

1 It looks as though aupjjieveiv, upfjv, and (in 563) XITC*>V were actually
derived from atomist contexts. The phrase KCCTOC diroTOnfiv ^K T^S ocireipou (sc. xcopocs) is closely paralleled in the Epicurean letter to Pythocles (Ep. IT, 88; DK67A24). Diogenes might have derived it from Dcmocritus; but it is also possible that oviJineveiv, 0|jif|v, XITCOV, as well as KOCTOC diroTOpir|v, arc merely Epicurean.
The account in 562 of the formation of worlds (formally attributed
to Leucippus, but no doubt representing the general views of Democritus also) is fairly detailed, but full of difficulties. The first stage is when a large collection of atoms becomes isolated, as it were, in a large patch of void. The second stage is when they form
a whirl or vortex. How this occurs we cannot tell ; it must happen
c by necessity
5 ,
1 as the result of a particular combination of their
separate atomic movements, and a vortex would presumably not necessarily or commonly arise out of the circumstances of the first stage alone. The vortex-action causes like atoms to tend towards
like.2 (There is a good deal of reminiscence of Anaxagoras in all this: in him Nous started a vortex and similar particles came
together to form bodies, 503 and pp. 382 f.) 3 The larger atoms congregate towards the middle, the smaller ones are squeezed out
(575) . A kind of membrane or garment (563) encloses the whole : whether this is formed by the smaller and extruded atoms (as
564 Democritus holds the same view as Leucippus about the elements, full and void. . . he spoke as if the things that are were in constant motion in the void; and there are innumerable worlds, which differ in size. In some worlds there is no sun and moon, in others they are larger than in our world, and in others more numerous. (3) The intervals between the worlds are unequal; in some parts there are more worlds, in others fewer; some
are increasing, some at their height, some decreasing; in some parts they are arising, in others failing. They are destroyed by collision one with another. There are some worlds devoid of living creatures or plants or any moisture.



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
suggested by Aetius, DK67A24), or whether these are thrust right out of the ovcnT)ua into the void (as suggested in 562), is uncertain. Other atoms come into contact with the extremity of the revolving mass and are drawn within the membrane. Certain of these atoms become ignited by the speed of the revolution (562 adfin.} and so form the heavenly bodies; the bulkier ones at
the centre 'stay together' (ovmaeveiv) to form the earth. Diogenes Laertius continues, after the end of 562, with a description
of cosmological details which are not particularly enlightening, but show us that here Leucippus tended to accept, not very
critically, the old Ionian theories. One important and highly conservative idea of Leucippus is that the earth is flat, shaped like
a tambourine (TUjjnravoi6f|s, Aetius m, 10, 4) ; Democritus slightly emended this (id. m, 10, 5), but retained the overall flatness. Both appear to have held that the earth was tilted downward towards the south.* Since there are innumerable atoms and an infinite void, there is no reason why only one such world should be formed ; Leucippus and Democritus therefore postulated innumerable
worlds, coming-to-be and passing away throughout the void
(562 init., 564). They are the first to whom we can with absolute certainty attribute the odd concept of innumerable worlds (as
opposed to successive states of a continuing organism), one which is reached entirely on the a priori grounds described above. 5 The
doxographcrs, however, certainly attributed the idea of plural worlds (whether coexistent or successive) to some lonians, con
ceivably by an error initiated by Theophrastus (see pp. 1 23 ff., also p. 390). Democritus, according to 564, seems to have embellished the idea by observing that there is no need for each world to have a sun and moon, and so on, or to have waters and give rise to life : the random nature of the cosmogonical process 562 would not
always produce the same result. For example, if there were no further atoms to be attracted close to the outer membrane of a
world, that world would presumably have no heavenly bodies.6

v, so that some other phenomenon than eclipse is explained by
the tilting of the earth. The order of subjects in Diogenes is against a gap; but the tilting of the earth would be so utterly unsuitable as an explanation of eclipses that it seems reasonable to postulate either a textual displace
ment or a total misunderstanding by Diogenes or his sources. The tilting of the earth remains; it explains both the slant of the zodiac and the differences of climate, and is conceivably related to, though very different from, Anaximenes' theory that the sun is hidden behind high northern
parts at night. Eclipses had already been correctly explained by Empcdocles and Anaxagoras. Cf. also Aetius HI, 12, 1-2 (DK67A27 and 68Ag6). 5 Compare the well-known saying of Democritus' pupil Mctrodorus of Chios, that it is strange for one ear of corn to be produced in a great plain,
and for one world in the boundless.
6 It looks as though there is a reference here to Anaxagoras fr. 4 (525; the recurrence of the phrase Trap
1 fmiv may be accidental). It is not at all certain, however, that that fragment described entirely separate worlds with separate suns and moons; if it did, then the fact that every world had the same structure justifies G. Vlastos* reference (Philos. Rev. 55 (1946)
53 f.) to ' the telcological streak in Anaxagorean physics ', and his suggestion that Dcmocritus* theory may be a * conscious refutation' of it.

572 Tet Democritus says that each of the indivisible bodies is heavier in proportion to its
excess (sc. of bulk).
573 Democritus distinguishes heavy and light by size .... Nevertheless in compound bodies the lighter is that which contains more void, the heavier that which contains less.
Sometimes he expressed it thus, but elsewhere he says simply that the fine is light.
574 Democritus named two (sc. properties ofatoms) , size and shape; but Epicurus added a third to these, namely weight. . . . Democritus says that the primary bodies (i.e. the solid atoms) do not possess weight but move in the infinite as the result of striking one another.

These passages present apparently contradictory opinions on the question whether the atoms, for Democritus, possessed weight, and if so, of what kind. Leucippus is not mentioned, and presumably did not think that the subject demanded special treatment. Aristotle in 572 is quite clear that for Democritus the atoms had
weight, but that the weight depended on their size. We may here pause to consider what weight means: it means a tendency to move consistently in a certain direction, what we call ' downwards ', and a resistance to e upward ' movement. This tendency might be explained by the operation of outside forces ; there is no need to
think of it as essential to all body, no matter what its environment,
and in fact (as Burnet EGP 342 f. argues) it appears that the concept of absolute weight as an essential attribute of body did
not occur to the early physicists. Now bodies in our world do as a matter of experience seem to have weight ; Democritus would
obviously not deny this. Composite bodies arc composed of atoms and void; void cannot have weight; therefore weight, in our world, must belong to atoms. But the atoms are solid, and of the same substance; therefore their weight varies directly with their size
(572). Compound objects of the same size can differ in weight because of differences in the amount of void they contain (573, of which the last sentence does not indicate a real inconsistency) . In our world all objects have weight of some kind and there is no such
thing as absolute lightness, as there was for Aristotle : things which
apparently tend upwards, such as fire, are actually being squeezed up by the compression of bulkier bodies (575) . At this point it must be remembered that the atoms as such, and before being
associated into bodies, differ from each other only in size and in
shape (see e.g. 555). These are their 'primary qualities'. The interaction of atoms is due to their collisions with and rebounds
from each other, which are continuing effects of the original random motion (see p. 417); there is no mention of weight, or a
575 . . . Democritus' school thinks that everything possesses weight, but that because it
possesses less weight fire is squeezed out by things that possess more, moves upwards and consequently appears light.

tendency to fall in one direction, as a cause of collision. (It is
explicitly stated, in fact, most clearly by Aetius in 574, that Epicurus added weight as an original property, and source of the behaviour, of atoms; he made their original motion a fall through space due to their weight.)
* Weight 5
only operates in a vortex, in
a developed world, and is an expression of the tendency of bulky objects towards the centre of a whirl. Before becoming involved in a vortex an atom is not activated by weight at all. 1
1 This explanation has been worked out chiefly by Dyroff and Burnet, and is accepted by Bailey: it does seem adequately to account for some confusion in the ancient authorities.

576 So Leucippus and Democritus, who say that their primary bodies are always in motion in the infinite void, ought to specify what kind of motion that is, what is the motion natural to them.

the other differences already mentioned; and as they move they collide and become entangled. . . .
578 For they (sc. Leucippus and Democritus) say that their primary magnitudes are infinite in number and indivisible in magnitude; the many does not come from one nor one
from many, but rather all things are generated by the intertwining and scattering around of these primary magnitudes.
579 For they (sc. Leucippus and Democritus) say that the atoms move by mutual collisions and blows.

TraAjJiov
It is evident from 576 and other similar complaints by Aristotle, as well as from the lack of positive information on this point, that neither Leucippus nor Democritus gave any full account of an original motion of atoms the motion, that is, which causes
collisions, not that which is caused by collisions. Indeed, since atoms and the void have always existed, it is clear that there must
always have been motion (whose eternity had to be postulated in order to avoid Eleatic arguments against a beginning of motion),
and consequent collisions. To enquire, therefore, as Aristotle does, what was the 'natural' motion of atoms is less pertinent than at
first appears. The real problem, philosophically speaking, is whether atoms and void have always existed ; if this is accepted, one can also accept that they have always interacted with each other. However, if the atomists were forced to define an 'original'
motion they could presumably say that it was a random motion, with no tendency in any atom to move in one direction rather than another. It is clear that collisions would very soon take place, and
that the original motion would progressively be supplanted by the secondary motions which result from collision and rebound.
It is just possible, however, that Democritus, at any rate, did
point to some kind of 'original' motion. Aristotle (de an. A 2,
4O3b3i ff.) tells us that he held soul-atoms to be self-moving, like
motes in a sunbeam; and it has been suggested that this image more aptly illustrates a random motion of atoms in general. In
577 it is suggested that motion in the void is originally caused by dissimilarities between the atoms. Democritus could not, of course, have meant that unlike exercised a force of repulsion on unlike, operating at a distance and not by contact. More probably
the suggestion is that irregular atoms are in a state of disequilibrium in the void, and so undergo movement. 1
1 Simplicius may have misrepresented Aristotle here. When giving his
own views the former is unreliable on this point; for at Phys. 1318, 35 (DK68A58) he claims that the original motion of atoms is due to their
weight, an Epicurean idea; and that it is through this, and because the void does not resist, that they are 'scattered around', TrepiTraAdaaeaOai (-TTepnraXafaecjOai mss., em. Diels) on which see the next note.
580 Democritus said there was only one kind of motion, that due to vibration.
27 417 K&R



PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
The regular motion of atoms, and perhaps the only one which Leucippus and Democritus fully envisaged, is due to rebounds of atoms after collision. This is frequently called a 'derived' motion;
in most of the doxographical accounts (e.g. 574) it is the only one known. Collisions of atoms result either in 'intertwining'
(ovinrAoK/i), if the atoms arc of congruent shape, or in 'being scattered around' (irepiTraAa^ig), if not that is, in rebounding in one direction or another. This is what is meant by Aristotle in 578.
Aetius in 580 assigns a special type of motion to Democritus, namely TraA|Ji6s or 'vibration' (the verbal root of which is the
same as that of TrepnrdAa^is; Bailey actually interpreted irepiTr6cAais in 578 in the sense of iraAuos, though not very plausibly). There is little doubt that Aetius is here reading an Epicurean idea into Democritus ; Epicurus used this word to describe the invisible
oscillation which, as he conceived, atoms underwent when con
fined in a complex body (Epicurus Ep. i, 43; cf. Bailey p. 332). z
1 LSJ gives the meaning of -rrepiTrcScAoc^is as 'collision, combination* of atoms, though that of irepiTraAcxcraeadai is given as * to be hurled around '.
Both translations are imperfect. The meaning of TrocAdoxrecrOat is ' to be shaken about, or sprinkled', and that of its simpler form TraXXeiv is 'to
shake*. A transitional stage to the Epicurean iraA|Ji6s-interpretation is
perhaps seen at Theophrastus de sensu 66 Jin. (DK 68 A 135). In 578
Aristotle simply means that things are produced by the entanglement and rebound of atoms; the latter does not of itself produce yevecris, but is
necessary for its continuity.

These passages state more precisely what has been outlined in
earlier extracts, e.g. 546 and 562, namely how atoms make up the visible complex bodies of our experience. As a result of collision between atoms those which are of congruous shape do not rebound but remain temporarily attached to one another: for example a hook-shaped atom may become involved with an atom into whose
shape the hook fits. Other congruous atoms colliding with this two-atom complex then become attached, until a visible body of a certain character is formed. It is emphasized that no real coalescence of atoms takes place : they simply come into contact
with each other, and always retain their own shape and indivi
duality. When a complex of atoms collides with another complex
it may be broken up into smaller complexes or into its constituent atoms, which then resume their motion through the void until
they collide with a congruous atom, or complex, once again.
There are considerable difficulties in this account. What part
does the principle of like-to-like play? This principle, illustrated
by Democritus in 569, is used in the description ofworld-formation; for in 562 atoms of all shapes come together in a great void, and like tends to like when the smaller atoms go to the periphery, the
concave, some convex, and indeed with countless other differences; so he thinks they cling to each other and stay together until such time as some stronger necessity comes from the surrounding and shakes and scatters them apart.
582 . . .these atoms move in the infinite void, separate one from the other and differing in shapes, sizes, position and arrangement; overtaking each other they collide, and some are shaken away in any chance direction, while others, becoming intertwined one with another
according to the congruity of their shapes, sizes, positions and arrangements, stay together and so effect the coming into being of compound bodies.

action may be modified, coalescence is due to congruence (which
implies difference, so far as ovpiTrAoKi^ is concerned, and not similarity) rather than to the principle of like-to-like. 582 tells us
that this congruence must operate in respect of shape, size,
position, and order. But this is not a complete solution, since we are told of one particular shape of atom that cannot be subject to
any obvious type of congruence with others of its shape, but
which docs nevertheless combine to make up a single type of complex (or rather two different but connected types) . This is the spherical atom, of which both soul and fire were evidently held to
be composed. 1 Soul, it might be argued, is regarded (as elsewhere in the fifth century) as scattered throughout the whole body ; but even so some conjunction of soul-atoms seems necessary. Fire is a
clearer case, for it is distinctly visible, and must be composed of
spherical atoms and no (or very few) atoms of another shape. How did these atoms come together? They cannot have become implicated with or hooked on to one another, as a result of
collision ; rather they must have become conjoined by the operation
of the principle of like-to-like. It seems, therefore, that Aristotle
in 581 is misleading in implying that all examples of aunnevsiv, i.e. of the formation of apparently stable complex bodies, are due to implication of atoms : there are occasions when other types of
auiJueTpicc (see 582), especially similarity of shape and size, are more relevant.
1 Aristotle asserts in several passages that for the atomists soul- and fireatoms were spherical, because they had to be mobile and penetrative:

tion of spherical atoms from the atmosphere an idea analogous, perhaps, to that of Heraclitus in 237. Aristotle occasionally implies that the soul is fire, because of this community of shape; but the truth is that a spherical
atom is neither soul nor fire, it is just a spherical atom. It takes on secondary properties only in association with other atoms; in the context
583 Democritus says that the spherical is the most mobile ofshapes; and such is mind and
fire.

of an animal body it is soul, in other contexts it is fire (cf. Cherniss, Aristotle 9s Criticism of Presocratic Philosophy, 290 n.). Nevertheless, the
similarity of shape explains how soul can be nurtured from the atmosphere (which is not besouled, but contains some fire) . Apart from soul (equivalent to mind according to Aristotle's account of atomism) and fire, no details have survived about which shape of atom gave rise to which secondary
characteristics, except in the case of sensation sharp atoms produce salty tastes, etc. (see 591 below). Aristotle understood that air and water (and earth, probably) were conglomerations of all shapes of atoms, -rravCTTrepnf ai : 584 de caelo Vq., 303 a IQ irolov Se KOC!

584 They (sc. Leucippus and Democritus) did not further define what particular shape belonged to each of the elements but merely attributed the sphere to fire; air, water and the
rest they distinguished by magnitude and smallness, as if their substance was a sort of mixture of seeds of all the elements.
585 Democritus and the majority of natural philosophers who discuss perception are
guilty of a great absurdity; for they represent all perception as being by touch.
586 Leucippus, Democritus and Epicurus say that perception and thought arise when images enter from outside; neither occurs to anybody without an image impinging.
587 Democritus explains sight by the visual image, which he describes in a peculiar way; the visual image does not arise directly in the pupil, but the air between the eye and the
object of sight is contracted and stamped by the object seen and the seer; forfrom everything there is always a sort of effluence proceeding. So this air, which is solid and variously coloured, appears in the eye, which is moist (?); the eye does not admit the dense part,
but the moist passes through

It is a necessary consequence of the atomist doctrine, that everything consists of atoms and void, that all sensation should be
explained as a form of contact or touch (585). The soul consists of
spherical atoms (583) spread through the body, and the mind was presumably regarded as a concentration of soul-atoms. Thus
thought is a process analogous to sensation, and takes place when the soul- or mind-atoms are set in motion by the impingement of congruent atoms from outside. This is implied in 586; in the case of thought one might suppose that self-motion by the kinetic
spherical atoms is also possible, to account for apparently spon
taneous thoughts. A full account of Democritus' detailed expla
nation of the different senses is given by Theophrastus in his de sensu, 49-83 (DK 68 A 1 35); this account may contain some
Peripatetic distortion and elaboration, but shows that Democritus, on this and on other subjects, went to great pains to work out the
588 They attributed sight to certain images, of the same shape as the object, which were
continually streaming offfrom the objects of sight and impinging on the eye. This was the view of the school ofLeucippus and Democritus ---
589 By convention are sweet and bitter, hot and cold, by convention is colour; in truth
are atoms and the void ____ In reality we apprehend nothing exactly, but only as it changes according to the condition of our body and of the things that impinge and press upon the
body. 590 There are two forms of knowledge, one genuine, one obscure. To the obscure belong
all the following: sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch. The other is genuine, and is quite distinct from this. . . . When the obscure form can no longer see more minutely nor hear
nor smell nor taste nor perceive through touch, but finer ***.

detailed mechanism of the atomic theory. The fullest, and least
satisfactory, description is of vision. Leucippus had evidently (588) taken over the Empedoclean theory (see p. 343) that images, eiScoAcc, are given off by objects, and affect the sense
organs. This was elaborated by Democritus, who held (587) that the visual image (eijupoccns) in the pupil is the result of effluences
(orrroppoaf) both from the seen object and from the observer; these meet and form a solid impression (evTUTrcocris) in the air, which then enters the pupil of the eye. The other senses are
explained more simply, and with emphasis on the different effects
of different sizes and shapes of atom;1 none of the explanations
stands close examination, and Aristotle and Theophrastus were
able to make some very pertinent criticisms. We do not know, for
example, how Democritus explained the sense of touch: as all
senses depend ultimately on this sense, it is obviously a problem
how sight or taste, for example, differ from it.

It follows that there can be no unchanging knowledge, the same
for all, of the secondary appearances (which are primary, however,
for our experience) or 'qualities' of things. Hot and cold, and so on, are conventional : in reality there are simply atoms and void
(589). We can know nothing of the former kind, for our perception of the secondary qualities is distorted by resistance in the medium,
air, or by the special dispositions of our own soul-atoms. Demo
critus made other pronouncements of a sceptical nature (cf. also
frr. 6, 7, 8) ; but in 590 it is clearly stated that there is a genuine
kind of opinion apart from sensation; it operates on objects too fine
591 Bitter taste is caused by small, smooth, rounded atoms, whose circumference is actually sinuous; therefore it is both sticky and viscous. Salt taste is caused by large, not rounded atoms, but in some cases jagged ones. . ..

for sensation to apprehend. The fragment itself breaks off at the
crucial point, but Sextus* introductory comments (not quoted here) indicate that ' genuine' opinion is intellectual. Obviously, its
objects are atoms and the void it penetrates beyond the c conventional ' secondary characteristics to the ultimate reality. Leucippus and Democritus themselves had been employing this
kind ofjudgement. Yet the mind, like the soul as a whole, operates through the mechanical motions and collisions of atoms, and its impressions must be subject to the same sort of distortions as those
of sensation (for which cf. 589, second part). It is clear, then, that Democritus should not have claimed, and perhaps did not claim,
more than approximate truth for his 'genuine' opinions the truth still lay 'in the depths' (fr. ny). 1
1 The difficulty of proving a conviction about atoms and the void, if we
can only infer these from our possibly fallacious corporeal impressions, is implied in a rejoinder by the senses to the first part of 589 (' by convention. . .in reality atoms and void '), ascribed to Democritus by Galen : 593 Demorritus Fr. 125, Galen de medic, empir. 1259, 8 Schoene (DK 68 8125) . . .TdAocivd 9pT|v, Trap* fi^oov AapoOaa T&S moreis fj^as Kara|3ocAAei$; TTTcojJia TOI TO KaT&|3Ar|iaa. This neat criticism is normally accepted as Democritean, but the possibility must not be overlooked that it is framed by a later critic as an intentional epilogue to, and corrective of, 589. It is odd that Sextus did not quote it.

We know of no ethical doctrines held specifically by Leucippus,
but Democritus devoted a part, though evidently not a particularly large part, of his considerable output to this subject. It happens that nearly all of the 290 or so verbatim fragments that have come down to us are from the ethical writings. Many are
preserved because John Stobaeus, the 5th-century-A.D. anthologist, incorporated them in his collection. Over a quarter of the total are ascribed to 'Democrates'; most critics now follow Diels and
accept the majority of these as genuine fragments of Democritus. Democritus' ethics are not explicitly based upon atomist physical
preconceptions, and atoms arc not mentioned. 1 The ethical
fragments express, in a graphic and highly developed gnomic
form, the Hellenic sentiments of restraint, common sense, and sanity. Yet no irrational sanctions of behaviour are introduced, no Justice or Nature that could not be resolved into the interplay of atoms and void. Vlastos may well be right in calling Democritean
ethics 'the first rigorously naturalistic ethics in Greek thought'. At the same time there is no pandering to sophistic amoralism : the
ethical ideal is euOu|air| (otherwise termed euecrrcb, dOapipiri)
contentment founded on moral well-being. 594 and 595 show this clearly enough; the latter may contain a reference to Heraclitus fr. 1 1 9 (250) . There are other, clearer references to Heraclitus ; and
Democritus also repeated Anaxagoras' famous pronouncement 'the things that appear are a vision of the unseen' (537), which has an obvious relevance to the atomic theory. 596 shows the non-hedonistic and indeed ascetic nature of much of his ethics,
596 Service abroad teaches self-sufficiency; barley-bread and a straw mattress are the
pleasantest medicines for hunger and fatigue. 597 He who feels any desire to beget a child seems to me better advised to take itfrom one of his friends; he will then have a child such as he wishes, for he can choose the kind he wants .... But if a man begets his own child, many are the dangers there; for he must make the best of him whatever his nature.

PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
a trend which was followed by Epicurus; while 597 is an amusing
example of philosophical rationalism, which in a Mediterranean
way rejects as secondary the emotional and psychological overtones which some would consider of first importance.
1 C. Bailey, The Greek Atomists and Epicurus 522, stated that ' there is no
effort to set the picture of the "cheerful" man on a firm philosophical basis or to link it up in any way with the physical system '. This is probably too extreme a view: the ethical doctrines are certainly not incompatible with the physical, and connexions may have been established in parts of Democritus that have not survived. G. Vlastos, Philos. Rev. 54 (1945)
578 ff. and 55 (1946) 53 fT., describes some possible but relatively slight points of contact between Democritean ethics and physics.
CONCLUSION
Atomism is in many ways the crown of Greek philosophical achievement before Plato. It fulfilled the ultimate aim of Ionian material monism by cutting the Gordian knot of the Eleatic
elenchus. Much as it owed not only to Parmenides and Melissus,
but also to the pluralist systems of Empedocles and Anaxagoras, atomism was not, however, an eclectic philosophy like that of
Diogenes of Apollonia. It was in essence a new conception, one which was widely and skilfully applied by Democritus, and which
through Epicurus and Lucretius was to play an important part in Greek thought even after Plato and Aristotle. It also, of course, eventually gave a stimulus to the development of modern atomic
theory the real nature and motives of which, however, are utterly
distinct.

The Apollonia of which Diogenes was a citizen was probably the Milesian foundation on the Pontus, rather than the Cretan city. 1 The statement that he was roughly contemporary with Anaxa
goras must be taken together with Theophrastus' judgement in 60 1 that he was 'almost the youngest' of the physical philosophers, and with Aristophanes' parody in the Clouds (617), produced in
423 B.C. All this is consonant with a floruit around 440-430. The statement that the succession-writer Antisthenes made Diogenes
a pupil of Anaximenes may be due to a misunderstanding by Laertius rather than by Antisthenes : Diogenes would naturally be placed in the Milesian tradition and associated with Anaximenes
because of his material principle, but his relative lateness in date does not seem to have been in doubt.
1 So Aelian, V.H. n, 3 1 (DK 64 A 3) , who mentioned ' Diogenes the Phrygian '
in a list of 'atheists'. Stephanus of Byzantium, on the other hand, associates ' Diogenes the physicist
' with the Cretan city, the former Eleutherna
(DK ibid.).

1 According to Simplicius (Phys. 149, 18) the references by Aristotle in 106 to an 'intermediate* substance were interpreted by Nicolaus of
Damascus and by Porphyry as referring to Diogenes of Apollonia. Clearly
this was an inference from passages like 606, where warm air (which might be taken as intermediate between fire and air) forms the allimportant noetic substance.
There has been much debate about whether Diogenes wrote a
single book which, like Anaxagoras' work, for example, covered different but nevertheless interrelated subjects, or whether, as
Simplicius thought (600), he wrote at least four books: 'Against
the Sophists', 'Meteorologia' (a highly dubious form of book
title), and 'On the nature of man', as well as the 'On nature' which Simplicius himself saw and from which he quoted nearly all our extant fragments. Diels held the former view, which is supported by 599, and thought that a subdivision of the book in the Hellenistic period (suggested by a reference by Rufus in Galen,
DK64B9, to the second book of Diogenes' 'On nature') could have
misled Simplicius. Burnet (EGP 353) and W. Theiler, on the other hand, argued that Simplicius is unlikely to be wrong on this point. Yet Simplicius' argument in 600, that what he took to be a divergence in the ancient interpretation of Diogenes' primary
6OO Since the generality of enquirers say that Diogenes of Apollonia made air the primary element, similarly to Anaximenes, while Nicolaus in his theological investigation relates that Diogenes declared the material principle to be between fire and air. . ., it must be realized that several books were written by this Diogenes (as he himself mentioned in
On nature, where he says that he had spoken also against the physicists whom he calls
'
sophists' and written a Meteorology, in which he also says he spoke about the
material principle, as well as On the nature of man); in the On nature, at least, which alone of his works came into my hands, he proposes a manifold demonstration that
in the material principle posited by him is much intelligence.
428



DIOGENES
substance must have arisen from the existence of different and not entirely consistent accounts by Diogenes, is rendered invalid because Nicolaus could have derived his interpretation from the
book available to Simplicius himself (see p. 428 n.). Further, that same book certainly included a great deal on the ' nature of man' ;
for the long and detailed fr. 6 (extracts in 619), quoted by Aristotle, seems to give precisely what Simplicius claims (Phys. 153, 13, DK64B6) to have found in 'On nature', namely 'an accurate anatomy of the veins', and not to have come from a separate work on the nature of man. Similarly the subjects of the other separate
books postulated by Simplicius could have been comprehended in one original work, and Simplicius might easily have mistaken references to other parts of this work for references to separate books; modern scholars are sometimes confronted by a similar
ambiguity in Aristotle's references to his treatment of particular
subjects elsewhere. Yet perhaps Diogenes did write at least one book other than Simplicius'
' On nature '
: for it is stated by Galen, On medical experience xxn, 3 (in R. Walzer's translation from the
Arabic), that 'Diogenes, writing more briefly and compendiously than you (sc. Asclepiades), has collected the diseases and their
causes and remedies in one treatise'. This Diogenes (mentioned
also ibid, xni, 4) may well be the Apolloniate, whom we know from Theophrastus (de sensu 43, DK64Aig) and from another
medical author ([Galen] de humor, xix, 495 Kuhn, DK 64 A 29 a) to have held views about diagnosis by the tongue and colour of the
patient. He was, therefore, perhaps a professional doctor, who may have published a technical medical treatise as well as a
general exposition of his cosmic theory. The opening sentence of the latter, quoted in 599, reminds one of the methodological claims made at the beginning of some of the
older and more philosophically-inclined works of the Hippocratic corpus, notably Ancient medicine, Airs waters places, and The nature of man. It must be admitted to Diogenes' credit that his exposition
and argumentation is, for his period, clear, simple and dignified.

Simplicius here obligingly distinguishes Thcophrastus' judgement
on Diogenes from his own appended comments. According to Theophrastus, then, most of Diogenes' theories were eclectic,
being derived from Anaxagoras, from Leucippus, or, in the important matter of the material principle, from Anaximenes. This seems to be true so far as it goes; but it seems probable that Heraclitus should be added to the list of important influences
(pp. 433 f., 436 ff., 442). J Although an eclectic, Diogenes seems to have been far more effective than Hippon of Samos, for example, or even Archelaus; he used elements from earlier systems as material
for a unitary theory of the world which was more self-consistent,
less complicated, more explicit and more widely applicable than
its monistic forebears. He adapted Anaxagoras'
' Mind ' to his own
monistic conception, and thereby showed, perhaps more clearly
than his predecessors, how the basic substance (which is itself, in
certain forms, VOTJCIIS or intelligence) could control the operation
of natural change; and in the explicitly teleological fragment (604, which must have been further expanded in other parts of Diogenes' work) he fully worked out an idea which seems to have been fore
shadowed in Heraclitus and left uncompleted in Anaxagoras.
1 H. Diller, Hermes 76 (1941) 359 ff., argued that the Leucippean elements are negligible; and that Melissus was criticizing both Diogenes and Leucippus (the normal view being, of course, that Leucippus reacted to
suggestions in Melissus, see pp. 405 f.) . The chronology of these three thinkers is admittedly loose enough to allow that they were all active, as Diller
suggests, in the decade 440430 B.C. ; and we cannot be absolutely certain
these matters (i.e. physical studies), wrotefor the most part in an eclecticfashion, following Anaxagoras in some things and Leucippus in others. He, too, says that the substance of the universe is infinite and eternal air, from which, when it is condensed and rarefied and
changed in its dispositions, the form of other things comes into being. This is what Theophrastus relates about Diogenes; and the book of Diogenes which has reached me,
entitled On nature, clearly says that air is that from which all the rest come into being.

about their relationship. Yet Diller bases his theory of the priority of Diogenes to Melissus largely on similarities of diction and vocabulary, and overlooks the fact that words like neTOCKoaneiaOoci were liable to be used in any philosophical writing of the latter half of the fifth century B.C. There are verbal similarities between Melissus fr. 7 and Diogenes fr. 2 (6O2 below) ; but it seems clear, not that Melissus is rebuffing Diogenes, or even
vice versa, but that both are reacting in different ways to pluralist explanations of the world.

This statement, which according to Simplicius' introductory remark (DK64B2) came 'immediately after the proem' that is,
immediately or shortly after 599 is a re-affirmation of monism in
face, presumably, of the pluralist systems of Empedocles and Anaxagoras. It is based on a new argument: not that it is simpler to have a single originative and basic substance (which may have
been the chief Milesian motive, partly consciously, but partly
unconsciously through the influence of the mythical-genealogical tradition), but that interaction of any kind between absolutely
and essentially distinct substances would be impossible. Of the
602 My opinion, in sum, is that all existing things are differentiated from the same
thing, and are the same thing. And this is manifest: for if the things that exist at present in this world-order earth and water and air andfire and all the other things apparent in this world-order if any of these were differentfrom the other (different, that is, in its own
proper nature), and did not retain an essential identity while undergoing many changes and differentiations, it would be in no way possible for them to mix with each other, orfor one to help or harm the other, orfor a growing plant to grow out of the earth or for a living creature or anything else to come into being, unless they were so composed as to be the same
thing. But all these things, being differentiated from the same thing, become of different kinds at different times and return into the same thing.



PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
interactions named, 'helping' and 'harming' (probably), and plant and animal growth, are taken from the animate sphere; which suggests that Diogenes' view of the world is influenced by
his physiological interests, much as Anaxagoras' theory seems to have been intimately connected with his reflexions on nutrition.
Biological change cannot arise from the mere juxtaposition of totally different substances, as for example in Empedocles'
'recipes' for bone and flesh (440 and 441). This principle is extended by Diogenes to the inanimate world, too, which is
analysed in terms of the four now recognized world-masses and the
other natural substances, thus showing the effect of Anaxagoras' extension of natural substance beyond Empedocles' four 'roots' (496). 602 concludes with the earliest certain enunciation (cf.
pp. i i8f.) of a principle assigned by Aristotle to the Presocratics in general, that things are destroyed into that from which they came. 1
1 Simplicius, in his connecting comment (DK64B2) between 602 and 604, found it odd that air, which is to be identified as the single underlying substance, is mentioned in 602 as one of several world-constituents. But this suggests that atmospheric air is not the basic form of air, but a close
derivative. The basic form of air is presumably the warm air that is
intelligence, cf. 606 if, that is, Diogenes distinguished any such 'basic* or true form.
602 may also be taken as a limitation of the principle expressed
in Anaxagoras fr. 17 (497), that all coming-to-be is mixture, all
passing-away is separation. Diogenes accepted this, but only if the elements of the mixture were of one kind and not, as Anaxagoras
thought, of many different kinds. In this respect Diogenes may
have been following Leucippus. The direct evidence for dependence on Leucippus, however, apart from Theophrastus' bare assertion in 601, is slight. 1

and infinite void. Air is generative of the worlds through being condensed and rarefied. Nothing comes to be from that which is not, nor is anything destroyed into that which is
not. The earth is circular, supported in the centre (sc. of the world) , having received its formation in accordance with the revolution proceeding from the hot and coagulation
produced by the cold.

indirectly derived from Theophrastus, but through a third-rate biographical source. There is no other mention of the void in connexion with Diogenes of Apollonia; and it might be argued that its presence here is due to doxographical conjecture. Yet Theophrastus evidently credited Diogenes with innumerable worlds of atomistic type (see 610, as well as
the present passage), and Diogenes could certainly have taken this theory from Leucippus. If so, then he might also have followed Leucippus in
postulating the void a postulate intimately connected, for the atomists, with that of innumerable worlds.
THE BASIC SUBSTANCE CONTAINS DIVINE INTELLIGENCE,

As it is, it seems preferable to understand something like the underlying substance referred to in 602 Jin. as the subject both of 8e56ccj0oci and of Xeiv.
According to Simplicius, 604 followed very closely upon 602, and was itself followed by 605. Diogenes set out his teleological belief in a prominent position, therefore, before the basic substance had
been fully identified as air. According to that belief the world and
its parts are arranged by a divine intelligence in the best possible
way. This intelligence, according to Simplicius and to fr. 5 (606) , is implicit in the basic substance. It is postulated because otherwise it would have been impossible for things to be divided up, and to be measured, as they patently are, into winter and summer, night and day, rain and wind and fair weather. It is the regularity
of natural events, therefore, of year- and day-cycles and of the weather, which impressed Diogenes ;
x here he was surely to some extent dependent on Heraclitus, who stressed that the measures
(220-222) of all natural change were preserved by the Logos, itself an expression or aspect of the archetypal substance, fire.
604 For, he says, it would not be possible without intelligence for it (sc. the underlying substance) so to be divided up that it has measures of all things of winter and summer and night and day and rains and winds andfair weather. The other things, too, if one wishes to consider them, one would find disposed in the best possible way.

PRESOGRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
Heraclitus had instanced these same natural oppositions and cycles
(cf. 205, 207 and fr. 57) as evincing a basic unity because of the regularity of their measures. Diogenes' concept of the conscious
purposefulness of nature, however, goes beyond Heraclitus; the latter, although he considered all things to be 'steered' by fire (223), held that this was in accordance with an objective natural
rule (which could be regarded materially as Logos or fire itself) implicit in the constitution of things a development, perhaps, of Anaximander's idea that natural interchanges were governed by a natural law of justice. Thus for Heraclitus pure fire was intelli
gent, but the regularity of natural events was achieved not so much by the deliberate exercise of this intelligence on every occasion as
by the incorporation of the Logos (fire in a systematically metric
function) in each separate thing, leading it to behave in a regular or measured way. For Diogenes, on the other hand, every natural
event was evidently due directly to the intelligence of the pure form of the basic substance; and thus occasional local anomalies, which were permitted in the systems of Anaximander and
Heraclitus, providing they were eventually corrected and counterbalanced, should not really take place. The difference in Diogenes' view is undoubtedly due to the influence of Anaxagoras' Mind, vous (503 ff.) ; the effect of which, however, as Socrates complained in 522, was only too often merely mechanical.
1 No doubt he was also impressed by the significant functions of the
organs of living creatures. We know that he gave considerable attention to methods of sensation (see 616) and breathing in different species for example in fish (DK64A3I) ; and that such differences were explained by differences in natural structure, which might thus appear to be purpose
serving.

(i.e. life-principle) and intelligence, as will be clearly shown in this work; and if this is removed, then they die and intelligence fails.
606 And it seems to me that that which has intelligence is what men call air, and that all men are steered by this and that it has power over all things. For this very thing seems to me to be a god and to have reached everywhere and to dispose all things and to be in everything. And there is no single thing that does not have a share of this; but nothing has an equal share of it, one with another, but there are manyfashions both of air itself and of intelligence. For it is many-fashioned, being hotter and colder and drier and moister and
more stationary and more swiftly mobile, and many other differentiations are in it both of taste and of colour, unlimited in number. And yet of all living creatures the soul is the same, air that is warmer than that outside, in which we exist, but much cooler than that near the sun. But in none of living creatures is this warmth alike (since it is not even so in individual men); the difference is not great, but as much as still allows them to be similar.
Yet it is not possiblefor anything to become truly alike, one to the other, of the things undergoing differentiation, without becoming the same. Because, then, the differentiation is manyfashioned, living creatures are many-fashioned and many in number, resembling each other neither inform nor in way oflife nor in intelligence, because of the number ofdifferentiations. Nevertheless they all live and see and hear by the same thing, and have the rest of their
intelligence from the same thing.

1 This is the old contrast between god and man, or god and the world : the
perfect and the imperfect (cf. p. 180). Simplicius noted (DK64By) that
both the divine and the world arc made of the same thing, air, for Diogenes. It is nevertheless legitimate to contrast the pure, divine form of air with its
derivative, corporeal forms; the severity of this contrast is due to its traditional formulation.
Simplicius obviously omitted something that came between 604 and 605 in Diogenes' book, so that we do not know the 'signs'
(cf. Melissus fr. 8 init., 392) mentioned in 605: presumably they too were signs that the basic substance was air. Perhaps the
gradual diminution of decaying bodies, 'into thin air', might have been one such indication, the nature of semen (sec p. 444 and 619) another. The sign that is mentioned, that all creatures live by
breathing air, which is both soul (life-principle) and intelligence, is obviously the most important of all ; it was probably stated in
Anaximenes, indeed (cf. pp. i6if.), but would occur naturally to anyone of pronounced physiological interests like Diogenes. That breath is the life-substance is deduced in 605 from the fact that life leaves the body with the breath, and was implicit in some
Homeric uses of 0uno$ and vpux/|. The connexion of TTVEUIJCC,
breath, with TrvsOncc, wind, was perhaps first made by Anaximenes. That air is also intelligence is, on the one hand, an inference
from its divinity as the life-principle; on the other it may be a
reasonable development of a view like Heraclitus', that the
intelligent substance (in his case Logos or fire) is inhaled by
breathing. 1 But even in Homer the distinction between life
and intelligence or feeling (Guuos) was blurred.
1 Diogenes succeeded in accounting for the dual function of air (as life,
and as intelligence and perception) in his detailed physiological theory; for air as sensation see p. 442 below, for air as life cf. 609 Aetius v, 24, 3
607 And this very thing is both eternal and immortal body, but of the rest some come into
being, some pass away. 608 But this seems to me to be plain, that it is both great and strong and eternal and
immortal and much-knowing.

This is analogous to Heractitus' theory of waking, sleeping and death as descending stages of consciousness, due to the diminution of soul-fire.
Air is god; it steers, has power over, inheres in, and disposes all
things (606 init.) ; it is eternal and immortal (607, 608). In these
descriptions, whose hieratic quality (particularly 606 with its
repetition of TrdvTccs, TTOCVTCOV, yrav etc.) has been rightly remarked,
Diogenes seems to collect together all the phraseology of his predecessors of Anaximander (no), Heraclitus (223) and
Anaxagoras (503) in particular. His emphasis in 606 that all things absolutely participate in air may be intended as a correction
of Anaxagoras, for whom Mind only existed in animate things. For Diogenes all things are made of air, but the inanimate is divided from the animate world by the fact that only in some things
is warm air found. In 606 the animate is chiefly in question;
differences are explained by air changing in accordance with its
warmth, dryness, motion, and other characteristics, which give it different 'tastes and colours'. It may be noted here that, in spite
of Theophrastus' assessment in 601, Diogenes does not appear to be interested in explaining all changes of air as being due solely to rarefaction and condensation; at least he describes some alteration in terms of what should be derivative and secondary changes,
like those of temperature. In fact, the distinguishing mark of the
divine is its temperature, not its density ; Diogenes has clearly overlooked, or at least failed to stress, the elegant consistency of Anaximenes.
Intelligence is warm air, warmer than the atmosphere (which is presumably air verging towards water), but cooler than the air
round the sun (which is verging towards fire). There are indefinite
slight variations in the temperature-range of intelligence-producing air, thus accounting for countless variations in perception, intelligence, and way of life. Moderate warmth is the differentia of
609 Diogenes says that if the blood, pouring into every part, fills the veins and pushes the air enclosed in them into the chest and the stomach below, then sleep occurs and the middle part of the body is warmer; but if all the airy part goes away from the veins, death occurs simultaneously.

PRESOCRATIG PHILOSOPHERS
soul-air; thus Diogenes achieves a rational distinction between the animate and the inanimate world, while retaining (unlike Anaxagoras) a common substance for both, and thus keeping his
monistic conception intact. Neatness, rather than originality, is his contribution here. Anaximenes had already assumed that both soul and the world were made of air, and that they were neverthe
less distinguished, presumably by degree of concentration though this is not explicitly stated; and for Heraclitus, too, the archetypal form of matter, fire, was also, in certain forms, soulsubstance which acted not only within animate creatures but also, as noetic and directive, on the world as a whole.

Diogenes' cosmogony is unoriginal, and is dependent on Anaxagoras (for the idea of the noetic substance starting a vortex) and on the Milesian tradition (the dense coalescing at the centre to
form earth, the rarer material going to the extremity, by like-to
610 Diogenes the Apolloniate premises that air is the element, and that all things are in motion and the worlds innumerable. He gives this account of cosmogony: the whole was in motion, and became rare in some places and dense in others; where the dense ran together
centripetally it made the earth, and so the rest by the same method, while the lightest parts took the upper position and produced the sun.
611 Diogenes says that the heavenly bodies are like pumice-stone, and he considers them
as the breathing-holes of the world; and they are fiery. With the visible heavenly bodies are carried round invisible stones, which for this reason have no name: they often fall on the earth and are extinguished, like the stone star that made itsjiery descent at Aegospotami.

like and differentiation). Both 610 and 603 assign innumerable worlds to Diogenes (see n. on pp. 432 f.); these were of atomistic
type, presumably after Leucippus coming-to-be, that is, and passing away throughout the boundless void (cf. also Aetius n, i, 3, DK64Aio). Aristotle's comment (134) that according to some natural philosophers the world was drying up was referred by Alexander (135) to Diogenes as well as to Anaximander ; Alexander adds (DK64AI7) that Diogenes explained the saltness of the sea
by the sun's evaporating the sweet water, which may suggest that
this drying of the sea was a simple meteorological comment not necessarily concerned with cosmic cycles or innumerable worlds. 1 The heavenly bodies (of which the sun is probably farther away
than the stars, cf. 610 fin.} are like pumice-stone, and glowing;
doubtless their pumice-like consistency is postulated so that they can be very light, and interpenetrated by fire. The great Aegospotami meteorite of 467 B.C. had evidently impressed Diogenes (as
it had Anaxagoras, cf. p. 392), who inferred that there must be other such bodies revolving unseen in the sky. This may be
Diogenes' own idea (cf. p. 156). Other astronomical details are derivative : that the sun is a concentration of rays from the aither
(Aetius n, 20, 10, DK64AI3) is from Empedocles (p. 334); that the earth, which is a circle, presumably a round disc, is tilted toward the south (Aetius n, 8, i, DK5QA67) is ascribed also to Anaxagoras and Leucippus; whether or not it is derived from
Anaximenes is questionable (see pp. i56f.).
1 It is probable that Diogenes is referred to (though perhaps not exclusively; for this kind of detail he was classed with Anaximenes) in 6l2 Aristotle Meteor. B 2, 355 a 2 1 TO 8' a\JT6 av/upcdvei Kal TOUTOIS aAoyov teal

614 (On why the Heradean stone (i.e. the magnet) attracts iron.) Diogenes the Apolloniate says that all ductile metals naturally discharge from themselves, and draw in from outside, a kind of emanation, some more and others less; but that bronze and iron discharge it
in the greatest quantity ....
615 Diogenes attributes thinking and the senses, as also life, to air. Therefore he would seem to do so by the action of similars (for he says that there would be no action or being acted upon, unless all things were from one). The sense of smell is produced by the air round the brain .... (40) Hearing is produced whenever the air within the ears, being moved by the air outside, spreads toward the brain. Vision occurs when things are reflected
on the pupil, and it, being mixed with the air within, produces a sensation. A proof of this is that, if there is an inflammation of the veins (i.e. those in the eye), there is no mixture
with the air within, nor vision, although the reflexion exists exactly as before. Taste occurs to the tongue by what is rare and gentle. About touch he gave no definition, either about its nature or its objects. But after this he attempts to say what is the cause of more accurate sensations, and what sort of objects they have.

Slightly over half of Theophrastus' description is given in 615; for
the remainder see DK. Some of Theophrastus' explanations show
his own interpretation, notably like-to-like as a principle of sensation, and 'symmetry', which has apparently been super
have least air in their heads, for it is mixed most quickly; and, in addition, if a man draws it in through a longer and narrower channel; for in this way it is more swiftly assessed.
Therefore some living creatures are more perceptive of smell than are men; yet nevertheless, if the smell were symmetrical with the air, with regard to mixture, man would smell
perfectly. . . . That the air within perceives, being a small portion of the god, is indicated by the fact that often, when we have our mind on other things, we neither see nor hear. (43) Pleasure and pain come about in this way: whenever air mixes in quantity with the
blood and lightens it, being in accordance with nature, and penetrates through the whole body, pleasure is produced; but whenever the air is present contrary to nature and does not mix, then the blood coagulates and becomes weaker and thicker, and pain is produced. Similarly confidence and health and their opposites .... (44) Thought, as has been said, is caused by pure and dry air; for a moist emanation inhibits the intelligence; for this reason thought is diminished in sleep, drunkenness and surfeit. That moisture removes intelligence is indicated by the fact that other living creatures are inferior in intellect, for they breathe the air from the earth and take to themselves moister sustenance. Birds breathe pure air, but have a constitution similar to that offishes; for their flesh is solid, and the breath does
not penetrate all through but stays around the abdomen. . . . Plants, through not being hollow and not receiving air within them, are completely devoid of intelligence.

imposed on Diogenes' idea of Kpaons, correct mixture. All sensa
tion is caused by air, air from the outside meeting and mixing with,
or simply agitating, air in the sense-organ itself or in the brain, whither it is led by blood-channels from the sense-organ. Clarity of perception depends on the fineness of the air in the body and the fineness and directness of the blood-channel by which the air is
conveyed. Apparently the air is mixed with blood on its journeys
through the head ; when air naturally permeates the blood throughout the whole body, pleasure is produced. Thinking (9povelv) depends on pure, dry air; it is not clear from 615 exactly where or how this functions, 1 but Simplicius tells us in 619 that air mixed with blood and pervading the body through the blood-channels
produces thought (being distinguished from pleasure, presumably,
by its purity, dryness and warmth). One may compare Anaxagoras* Mind, which was *
purest and finest of all substances' (503),
and Heraclitus' soul-fire; in Diogenes, as in Hcraclitus, moisture (iKiaocs again) quenches or inhibits intelligence. Differences of intelligence and of animation are explained partly by differences of surrounding air (that near the ground is moist and heavy, therefore plants have a very low degree of life),2 partly by differences of bodily structure (birds cannot properly assimilate their pure
surrounding air).

616 Accordingly I consider that the brain has the most power in man. For, if it is in
sound condition, it is our interpreter of the things that come into being through air; and air provides intelligence. The eyes and ears and tongue and hands and feet do whatsoever the
brain determines; for there is an element of intelligence in the whole body, according as each part partakes of air, but it is the brain that is the messenger to the understanding. For whenever man draws breath into himself it arrives first at the brain, and thus the air spreads into the rest of the body after leaving behind its choicest part in the brain, and
whatever of it is intelligent and possesses judgement.

617 For never would I have correctly discovered the affairs on high, except by hanging up my thought and mingling my rarefied intelligence with air of like kind. If I had stayed on the ground and considered from beneath the things above, never would I have discovered
them; for the truth is that the earth draws to itself by force the emanation of intelligence.
618 The veins in man are as follows. There are two veins pre-eminent in magnitude. These extend through the belly along the backbone, one to right, one to left; either one to the leg on its own side, and upwards to the head, past the collar-bones, through the throat. From these, veins extend all over the body, from that on the right hand to the right
side andfrom that on the left hand to the left side; the most important ones, two in number, to the heart in the region of the backbone; other two a little higher up through the chest in underneath the armpit, each to the hand on its own side: of these two, one being termed
the spleen-vein, and the other the liver-vein. . . . There is also another pair, running from each of these through the spinal marrow to the testicles, thin and delicate. There is,
further, a pair running a little underneath the cuticle through the flesh to the kidneys, and these with men terminate at the testicle, and with women at the womb. (The veins that

619 seems to show that the long fragment on the blood-channels, 6i83 actually came in the book called by Simplicius On nature. That the semen is aerated is stated in both 618 and 619; this is important, since semen produces new life, and its aerated nature
(conceivably noted by Pherecydes, though see p. 57) is an important indication that air is the vital substance. Semen, for Diogenes and
for other early theorists on the anatomy of the body, was a product of the blood, which was also, of course, aerated (though not so
conspicuously), and thus conveyed sensation and thought. The great detail of the account of the blood-channels (the central part
of which is omitted here) shows that Diogenes' physiological interests, 1 which connected with and perhaps partly motivated the
general theory, were of no merely incidental importance to him; in this we may compare Empedocles (also a doctor of some kind,
cf. p. 321) and Anaxagoras (p. 393). There is no doubt that from
Alcmaeon and Empedocles onwards the more easily determinable structure of the human body was used as a clue to that of the whole world. The assumption of a parallelism between the two seems to have been held in some form by Anaximenes, probably as a
leave the stomach are comparatively broad just as they leave; but they become gradually thinner, until they change over from right to left and from left to right.} These veins are termed the spermatic veins. The blood is thickest when it is imbibed by the fleshy parts; when it is transmitted to these regions it becomes thin9 warm, and frothy. (After D'Arcy
Thompson)
619 And in the continuation he shows that also the sperm of living creatures is aerated,
and acts of intelligence take place when the air, with the blood, gains possession of the whole body through the veins; in the course of which he gives an accurate anatomy of the veins. Now in this he clearly says that what men call air is the material principle.

development of the entirely unscientific tendency to treat the outside world as a person, to animate it and regard it as a living
organism. This assumption was grounded in reason as a result of
integrations like that of Heraclitus, who had emphasized very
strongly that the Logos or arrangement of all things, of men and of the world as a whole, was essentially the same.
1 Diogenes, like Empedocles and Anaxagoras, also paid attention to
embryology (cf. DK 64 A 2 5-8); treating, for example, the old problem of whether the embryo is produced from the male contribution only, or from both male and female (cf. p. 340).
CONCLUSION
With Diogenes and Democritus, who were little if at all older than
Socrates, the Presocratic period is legitimately held to end. During the second half of the fifth century B.C., particularly during the
Peloponnesian War and under the influence of the mature Socrates
and the Sophists, the old cosmological approach by which the
primary aim was to explain the outside world as a whole, man
being considered only incidentally was gradually replaced by
a humanistic approach to philosophy, by which the study of man
became no longer subsidiary but the starting-point of all enquiry. This re-orientation was a natural development: in part it was determined by social factors, but in part, as will have become apparent, it was the product of tendencies in the Presocratic
movement itself.
