The Poetic Edda






The Poetic Edda
Northvegr Edition
Edda Sæmundar Hinns Froða The Edda Of Sæmund The Learned
Translated From the Old Icelandic
By
Benjamin Thorpe
The Northvegr Foundation Press • Lapeer, Michigan



iv
This Northvegr Edition is an unabridged and unaltered republication of a translation that was published in two separate editions. The first edition is an edition published by the Norroena Society in 1907, as The Elder Edda of Saemond Sigfusson, and the Younger Edda of Snorre Sturleson. This edition also included a translation of the Prose Edda, translated by I. A. Blackwell, which is not included in the present edition. We no longer have access to the text of the second edition, which is most likely from Thorpe’s 1866 publication, Edda Sæmundar hinns Frôða. The texts from the two editions are virtually the same except for a few key points. The 1907 edition includes footnotes (which have been reproduced for the Northvegr Edition). The 1866 edition includes three lays that did not appear in the 1907 edition: Hrafnagaldr Odins, Gunnars Slagr and Gröttasóngr. All three are included in this edition. Every effort has been taken to reproduce this translation as accurately as possible.

Preface
(Chiefly from the Vita Sæamundi Multiseii volgo Froda, Autore Arna Magnæo, prefixed to the Copenhagen edition.)
Sæmund, son of Sigfus, the reputed collector of the poems bearing his name, which is sometimes also called the Elder, and the Poetic, Edda, was of a highly distinguished family, being descended in a direct line from King Harald Hildetönn. He was born at Oddi, his paternal dwelling in the south of Iceland, between the years 1054 and 1057, or about 50 years after the establishment by law of the Christian religion in that island; hence it is easy to imagine that many heathens, or baptized favourers of the old mythic songs of heathenism, may have lived in his days and imparted to him the lays of the times of old, which his unfettered mind induced him to hand down to posterity. The youth of Sæmund was passed in travel and study, in Germany and France, and, according to some accounts, in Italy. His cousin John Ögmundson, who later became first bishop of Holum, and after his death was received among the number of saints, when on his way to Rome, fell in with his youthful kinsman, and took him back with him to Iceland, in the year 1076. Sæmund afterwards became a priest at Oddi, where he instructed many young men in useful learning; but the effects of which were not improbably such as to the common people might appear as witchcraft or magic: and, indeed, Sæmund’s predilection for the sagas and songs of the old heathen times (even for the magical ones) was so well known, that among his countrymen there were some who regarded him as a great sorcerer, though chiefly in what is called white or innocuous and defensive sorcery, a repute which still clings to his memory among the common people of Iceland, and will long adhere to it through the numerous and popular stories regarding him (some of them highly entertaining)
that are orally transmitted from generation to generation. The following, the first among many, may serve as a specimen. Sæmund was residing, in the south of Europe, with a famous Master, by whom he was instructed in every kind of lore; while, on the other hand, he forgot (apparently through intense study) all that he had previously learned, even to his own name; so that when the holy man John Ögmundson came to his abode, he told him that his name was Koll; but on John insisting that he was no other than Sæmund Sigfusson, born at Oddi in Iceland, and relating to him many particulars regarding himself, he at length became conscious of his own identity, and resolved to flee from the place with his kinsman. For the purpose of deceiving the Master, John continued some time in the place, and often came to visit him and Sæmund: till at last, on dark night, they betook themselves to flight. No sooner had the Master missed them than he sent in pursuit of them; but in vain, and the heavens were too overcast to admit, according to his custom, of reading their whereabouts in the stars. So they traveled day and night and all the following day. But the next night was clear, and the Master at once read in the stars where they were, and set out after them at full speed. Then Sæmund, casting his eyes up at the heavens, said: ‘Now is my Master in chase of us, and sees where we are.’ And on John asking what was to be done, he answered: ‘Take one of my shoes off; fill it with water, and set it on my head.’ John did so, and at the same moment, the Master, looking up at the heavens, says to his companion: ‘Bad news: the stranger John has drowned my pupil; there is water about his forehead.’



viii
And thereupon returned home. The pair now again prosecute their journey night and day; but, in the following night, the Master again consults the stars, when, to his great amazement, he sees the star of Sæmund directly above his head, and again sets out after the fugitives. Observing this, Sæmund says: ‘The astrologer is again after us, and again we must look to ourselves: take my shoe off again, and with your knife stab me in the thigh: fill the shoe with blood, and place it on the top of my head.’ John does as directed, and the Master again gazing at the stars, says: ‘There is blood now about the star of Master Koll, and the stranger has for certain murdered him’: and so returns home. The old man now has once more recourse to his art; but on seeing Sæmund’s star shining brightly above him, he exclaimed: ‘My pupil is still living: so much the better. I have taught him more than enough; for he outdoes me both in astrology and magic. Let them now proceed in safety; I am unable to hinder their departure.’ Sæmund died at the age of 77, leaving behind him a work on the history of Norway and Iceland, which is now entirely lost. The first who ascribed to Sæmund the collection of poems known as the Poetic Edda,1 was Brynjolf Sveinsson, bishop of Skalholt. This prelate, who was a zealous collector of ancient manuscripts, found in the year 1643, the old vellum codex, which is the most complete of all the known manuscripts of the Edda; of this he caused a transcript to be made, which he entitled Edda Sæmundi Multiseii. The transcript came into the possession of the royal historiographer Torfæus; the original, together with other MSS., was presented to the King of Denmark, Frederick III., and placed in the royal library at Copenhagen, where it now is.2 As many of the Eddaic poems appear to have been orally transmitted in an imperfect state, the collector has supplied the deficiencies by prose insertions, whereby the integrity of the subject is to a certain degree restored. The collection called Sæmund’s Edda consists of two parts, viz., the Mythological and the Heroic. It is the former of these which is now offered to the public in an English version. In the year 1797, a translation of this first part, by A.S. Cottle, was published at Bristol. This work I have never met with; nor have I seen any English version of any part of the Edda, which the exception of Gray’s spirited but free translation of the Vegtamskvida. The present volume closes with a translation of the Solarlioð, a poem in which the religion of the country appears in a transition state from Heathenism to Christianity.3 Some readers will, I doubt not, be desirous of ampler illustration of the mythological poems of the Edda than that which is afforded by the Index to this volume; to such I would recommend the translation of the Prose Edda, in Mallet’s Northern Antiquities, published by Bohn, and Thorpe’s Northern Mythology and Popular Traditions, in 3 vols. Small 8, the 1st vol. Of which contains a good and satisfactory compendium of the Odinic religion. The German scholar will find ample and valuable information on the same subject in the “Altnordische Mythologie” prefixed to Professor Lünings editions of the Edda, a work which I have principally used while revising the present translation, and which I regard as unquestionably the best existing. From a memorandum made at the time, I find that this volume was ready for press in the year 1856, though the idea of offering it to the public was not entertained until about two years ago.

On intimating my intention to one or two persons, I was informed that an edition was already in the press, and, consequently, I withdrew from the field. But as that edition seems to be postponed sine die, or I had been misinformed regarding it, I have resolved on sending forth my humble production. It is needless to inform my readers that it has no pretension to elegance; but I believe it to be a faithful though homely representation of the original, and may, at all events serve as a stopgap until made to give place to a worthier work; for that the lack of an edition of the Edda seems a chasm in our literature cannot be denied. If a not unfavourable reception is given it by the British public, the Second, or Heroic part shall be immediately sent to press.

Part 1: The Mythological Lays
Völuspá: The Vala’s Prophecy
Introduction to the Völuspá
As introductory to the Völuspá, the following description of a wandering Vala or prophetess may be thought both desirable and interesting: “We find them present at the birth of children, when they seem to represent the Norns. They acquired their knowledge either by means of seid, during the night, which all others in the house were sleeping, and uttered their oracles in the morning; or they received sudden inspirations during the signing of certain songs appropriated to the purpose, without which the sorcery could not perfectly succeed. These seid-women were common over all of the North. When invited by the master of a family, they appeared in a peculiar costume, sometimes with a considerable number of followers, e.g., with fifteen young men and fifteen girls. For their soothsaying they received money, gold rings, and other precious things. Sometimes it was necessary to compel them to prophesy. An old description of such a Vala, who went from guild to guild telling fortunes, will give the best idea of these women and their proceedings: Thorbiörg, nicknamed the little Vala, during the winter attended the guilds, at the invitation of those who desired to know their fate, or the quality of the coming year. Everything was prepared in the most sumptuous manner for her reception. There was an elevated seat, on which lay a cushion stuffed with feathers. A man was sent to meet her. She came in the evening dressed in a blue mantle fastened with thongs and set with stones down to the lap; round her neck she had a necklace of glass beads, on her head a hood of black lambskin lined with white catskin; in her hand a staff, the head of which was mounted with brass and ornamented with stones; round her body she wore a girdle of agaric (knöske), from which hung a bag containing her conjuring apparatus; on her feet were rough calfskin shoes with long ties and tin buttons, on her hands catskin gloves, white and hairy within. All bade her welcome with a reverent salutation; the master himself conducted her by the hand to her seat. She undertook no prophecy on the first day, but would first pass a night there. In the evening of the following day she ascended her elevated seat, caused the women to place themselves round her, and desired them to sing certain songs, which they did in a strong, clear voice. She then prophesied of the coming year, and afterwards, all that would advanced and asked her such questions as they thought proper, to which they received plain answers.” Northern Mythology I. p.214, Den Ældre Edda I. p. 6.
In the following grand and ancient lay, dating most probably from the time of heathenism, are set forth, as the utterances of a Vala, or wandering prophetess, as above described, the story of the creation of the world from chaos, of the origin of the giants, the gods, the dwarfs, and the human race, together with other events relating to the mythology of the North, and ending with the destruction of the gods and the world, and their renewal.

Völuspá The Vala’s Prophecy
1. For silence I pray all sacred children, great and small, sons of Heimdall1 they will that I Valfather’s deeds recount, men’s ancient saws, those that I best remember.
2. The Jötuns I remember early born, those who me of old have reared. I nine worlds remember, nine trees, the great central tree, beneath the earth.
3. There was in times of old, where Ymir dwelt, nor sand nor sea, nor gelid waves; earth existed not, nor heaven above, ‘twas a chaotic chasm, and grass nowhere.
4. Before Bur’s sons raised up heaven’s vault, they who the noble mid-earth shaped. The sun shone from the south over the structure’s rocks: then was the earth begrown with herbage green.
1. In the Rigsmal we are informed how Heimdall, under the name of Rig, became the progenitor of the
three orders of mankind.



3
5. The sun from the south, the moon’s companion, her right hand cast about the heavenly horses. The sun knew not where she2 a dwelling had, the moon knew not what power he possessed, the stars knew not where they had a station.
6. Then went the powers all to their judgement-seats, the all-holy gods, and thereon held council: to night and to the waning moon gave names; morn they named, and mid-day, afternoon and eve, whereby to reckon years.
7. The Æsir met on Ida’s plain; they altar-steads and temples high constructed; their strength they proved, all things tried, furnaces established, precious things forged, formed tongs, and fabricated tools;
8. At tables played at home; joyous they were; to them was naught the want of gold, until there came Thurs-maidens three, all powerful, from Jötunheim.
2. In the Germanic tongues, as in the Semitic, the sun is fem., the moon masc.



4
9. Then went all the powers to their judgement-seats, the all-holy gods, and thereon held council, who should of the dwarfs the race create, from the sea-giant’s blood and livid bones.
10. Then was Mötsognir created greatest of all the dwarfs, and Durin second; there in man’s likeness they created many dwarfs from the earth, as Durin said.
11. Nýi and Nidi, Nordri and Sudri, Austri and Vestri, Althiöf, Dvalin Nár and Náin, Niping, Dáin, Bivör, Bavör, Bömbur, Nori, An and Anar, Ai, Miödvitnir,
12. Veig and Gandálf, Vindálf, Thráin, Thekk and Thorin, Thror, Vitr, and Litr, Núr and Nýrád, Regin and Rádsvid. Now of the dwarfs I have rightly told.



5
13. Fili, Kili, Fundin, Nali, Hepti, Vili, Hanar, Svior, Billing, Bruni, Bild, Búri, Frár, Hornbori, Fræg and Lóni, Aurvang, Iari, Eikinskialdi.
14. Time ‘tis of the dwarfs in Dvalin’s band, to the sons of men, to Lofar up to reckon, those who came forth from the world’s rock, earth’s foundation, to Iora’s plains.
15. There were Draupnir, and Dólgthrasir, Hár, Haugspori, Hlævang, Glói, Skirvir, Virvir, Skafid, Ai, Alf and Yngvi, Eikinskialdi,
16. Fjalar and Frosti, Finn and Ginnar, Heri, Höggstari, Hliódolf, Móin: that above shall, while mortals live, the progeny of Lofar, accounted be. ******************3
3. Indicates a line that has been lost.



6
17. Until there came three mighty and benevolent Æsir to the world from their assembly. They found on earth, nearly powerless, Ask and Embla, void of destiny.
18. Spirit they possessed not, sense they had not, blood nor motive powers, nor goodly colour. Spirit gave Odin, sense gave Hoenir, blood gave Lodur, and goodly colour. *******************
19. I know an ash standing Yggdrasil hight, a lofty tree, laved with limpid water: thence come the dews into the dales that fall ever stands it green over Urd’s fountain.
20. Thence come maidens, much knowing, three from the hall, which under that tree stands; Urd hight the one, the second Verdandi, on a tablet they graved Skuld the third. Laws they established, life allotted to the sons of men; destinies pronounced.



7
21. Alone she3 sat without, when came that ancient dread Æsir’s prince; and in his eyes she gazed.
22. “Of what wouldst thou ask me? Odin! I know all, where thou thine eye didst sink in the pure well of Mim.” Mim drinks mead each morn from Valfather’s pledge.5 Understand ye yet, or what?
23. The chief of hosts gave her rings and necklace, useful discourse, and a divining spirit: wide and far she saw o’er every world.
24. She the Valkyriur saw from afar coming, ready to ride to the gods’ people: Skuld held a shield, Skögul was second, then Gunn, Hild, Göndul, and Geirskögul. Now are enumerated Herian’s maidens, the Valkyriur, ready over the earth to ride.
25. She that war remembers, the first on earth, when Gullveig6 they with lances pierced, and in the high one’s7 hall
4. The Vala here speaks of herself in the third person.
5. His eye, here understood to signify the sun.
6. A personification of gold. With the introduction of gold was the end of the golden age.
7. i.e., Odin’s: his hall is the world.



8
her burnt, thrice burnt, thrice brought her forth, oft not seldom; yet she still lives.
26. Heidi they called her, whithersoe’r she came, the well-foreseeing Vala: wolves she tamed, magic arts she knew, magic arts practised; ever was she the joy of evil people.
27. Then went the powers all to their judgement-seats, the all-holy gods, and thereon held council, whether the Æsir should avenge the crime, or all the gods receive atonement.
28. Broken was the outer wall of the Æsir’s burgh. The Vanir, foreseeing conflict tramp oér the plains. Odin cast (his spear), and mid the people hurled it: that was the first warfare in the world. ********************
29. Then went the powers all to their judgement-seats, the all-holy gods, and thereon held council: who had all the air with evil mingled? or to the Jötun race Od’s maid had given?



9
30. There alone was Thor with anger swollen. He seldom sits, when of the like he hears. Oaths are not held sacred; nor words, nor swearing, nor binding compacts reciprocally made.
31. She knows that Heimdall’s horn is hidden under the heaven-bright holy tree. A river she sees flow, with foamy fall, from Valfather’s pledge. Understand ye yet, or what?
32. East sat the crone, in Iárnvidir, Fenrir’s progeny: of all shall be one especially the moon’s devourer, in a troll’s semblance.
33. He is sated with the last breath of dying men; the gods’ seat he with red gore defiles: swart is the sunshine then for summers after; all weather turns to storm. Understand ye yet, or what?
34. There on a height sat, striking a harp, the giantess’s watch, the joyous Egdir; by him crowed, in the bird-wood, the bright red cock, which Fialar hight.



10
35. Crowed o’er the Æsir Gullinkambi, which wakens heroes with the sire of hosts; but another crows beneath the earth, a soot-red cock, in the halls of Hel.
36. I saw of Baldr, the blood-stained god, Odin’s son, the hidden fate. There stood grown up, high on the plain, slender and passing fair, the mistletoe.
37. From that shrub was made, as to me it seemed, a deadly, noxious dart. Hödr shot it forth; But Frigg bewailed, in Fensalir, Valhall’s calamity. Understand ye yet, or what?
38. Bound she saw lying, under Hveralund, a monstrous form, to Loki like. There sits Sigyn, for her consort’s sake, not right glad. Understand ye yet, or what?
39. Then the Vala knew the fatal bonds were twisting, most rigid, bonds from entrails made.



11
40. From the east a river falls, through venom dales, with mire and clods, Slid is its name.
41. On the north there stood, on Nida-fells, a hall of gold, for Sindri’s race; and another stood in Okolnir, the Jötuns beer-hall which Brimir hight.
42. She saw a hall standing, far from the sun, in Náströnd; its doors are northward turned, venom-drops fall in through its apertures: entwined is that hall with serpent’s backs.
43. She there saw wading the sluggish streams bloodthirsty men and perjurers, and him who the ear beguiles of another’s wife. There Nidhögg sucks the corpses of the dead; the wolf tears men. Understand ye yet, or what?
44. Further forward I see, much can I say of Ragnarök and the gods’ conflict.



12
45. Brothers shall fight, and slay each other; cousins shall kinship violate. The earth resounds, the giantesses flee; no man will another spare.
46. Hard is it in the world, great whoredom, an axe age, a sword age, shields will be cloven, a wind age, a wolf age, ere the world sinks.
47. Mim’s sons dance, but the central tree takes fire, at the resounding Gjallar-horn. Loud blows Heimdall, his horn is raised; Odin speaks with Mim’s head.
48. Trembles Yggdrasil’s ash yet standing; groans that aged tree, and the jötun is loosed. Loud bays Garm before the Gnupa-cave, his bonds he rends asunder; and the wolf runs.
49. Hrym steers from the east, the waters rise, the mundane snake is coiled in jötun-rage. The worm beats the water, and the eagle screams: the pale of beak tears carcases; Naglfar is loosed.



13
50. That ship fares from the east: come will Muspell’s people o’er the sea, and Loki steers. The monster’s kin goes all with the wolf; with them the brother is of Byleist on their course.
51. Surt from the south comes with flickering flame; shines from his sword the Val-god’s sun. The stony hills are dashed together, the giantesses totter; men tread the path of Hel, and heaven is cloven.
52. How is it with the Æsir? How with the Alfar? All Jötunheim resounds; the Æsir are in council. The dwarfs groan before their stony doors, the sages of the rocky walls. Understand ye yet, or what?
53. Then arises Hlin’s second grief, when Odin goes with the wolf to fight, and the bright slayer of Beli with Surt. Then will Frigg’s beloved fall.



14
54. Then comes the great victor-sire’s son, Vidar, to fight with the deadly beast. He with his hands will make his sword pierce to the heart of the giant’s son: then avenges he his father.
55. Then comes the mighty son of Hlódyn: (Odin’s son goes with the monster to fight); Midgárd’s Veor in his rage will slay the worm. Nine feet will go Fiörgyn’s son, bowed by the serpent, who feared no foe. All men will their homes forsake.
56. The sun darkens, earth in ocean sinks, fall from heaven the bright stars, fire’s breath assails the all-nourishing tree, towering fire plays against heaven itself.
57. She sees arise, a second time, earth from ocean, beauteously green, waterfalls descending; the eagle flying over, which in the fell captures fish.



15
58. The Æsir meet on Ida’s plain, and of the mighty earth-encircler speak, and there to memory call their mighty deeds, and the supreme god’s ancient lore.
59. There shall again the wondrous golden tables in the grass be found, which in days of old had possessed the ruler of the gods, and Fjölnir’s race.
60. Unsown shall the fields bring forth, all evil be amended; Baldr shall come; Hödr and Baldr, the heavenly gods, Hropt’s glorious dwellings shall inhabit. Understand ye yet, or what?
61. Then can Hoenir choose his lot, and the two brother’s sons inhabit the spacious Vindheim. Understand ye yet, or what?
62. She a hall sees standing than the sun brighter, with gold bedecked, in Gimill: there shall the righteous people dwell, and for evermore happiness enjoy.



16
64. Then comes the mighty one to the great judgement, the powerful from above, who rules o’er all. He shall dooms pronounce, and strifes allay, holy peace establish, which shall ever be. **********************
65. There comes the dark dragon flying from beneath, the glistening serpent, from Nida-fells. On his wings bears Nidhögg, flying o’er the plain, a corpse. Now she will descend.

VafÞrúðnismál: The lay of Vafthrúdnir
Odin visits the Giant (Jötun) Vafthrudnir, for the purpose of proving his knowledge. They propose questions relative to the Cosmogony of the Northern creed, on the condition that the baffled party forfeit his head. The Jötun incurs the penalty.
Odin 1. Counsel thou me now, Frigg! as I long to go Vafthrudnir to visit; great desire, I say, I have, in ancient lore with that all-wise Jötun to contend.
Frigg 2. At home to bide Hærfather I would counsel, in the gods’ dwellings; because no Jötun is, I believe, so mighty as is Vafthrudnir.
Odin 3. Much have I journeyed, much experienced, mighty ones many proved; but this I fain would know, how in Vafthrudnir’s halls it is.
Frigg 4. In safety mayest thou go, in safety return, in safety on thy journeyings be; may thy wit avail thee, when thou, father of men! shalt hold converse with the Jötun.



18
5. Then went Odin the lore to prove of that all-wise Jötun. To the hall he came which Im’s father owned. Ygg went forthwith in.
Odin 6. Hail to thee, Vafthrudnir! to thy hall I am now come, thyself to see; for I fain would know, whether thou art a cunning and all-wise Jötun.
Vafthrudnir 7. What man is this, that in my habitation by word addresses me? Out thou goest not from our halls, if thou art not the wiser.
Odin 8. Gagnrad is my name, from my journey I am come thirsty to thy halls, needing hospitality, for I long have journeyed and kind reception from thee, Jötun!
Vafthrudnir 9. Why then, Gagnrad! speakest thou from the floor? Take in the hall a seat; then shall be proved which knows most, the guest or the ancient talker.



19
Gagnrad 10. A poor man should, who to a rich man comes, speak usefully or hold his tongue: over-much talk brings him, I ween, no good, who visits an austere man.
Vafthrudnir 11. Tell me, Gagnrad! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy proficiency, how the horse is called that draws each day forth over human kind?
Gagnrad 12. Skinfaxi he is named, that the bright day draws forth over human kind. Of coursers he is best accounted among the Reid-goths. Ever sheds light that horse’s mane.
Vafthrudnir 13. Tell me now, Gagnrad! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy proficiency, how that steed is called, which from the east draws night o’er the beneficent powers?
Gagnrad 14. Hrimfaxi he is called, that each night draws forth over the beneficent powers. He from his bit lets fall drops every morn, whence in the dales comes dew.

Vafthrudnir 15. Tell me, Gagnrad! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy proficiency, how the stream is called, which earth divides between the Jötuns and the Gods?
Gagnrad 16. Ifing the stream is called which earth divides between the Jötuns and the Gods: open shall it run throughout all time. On that stream no ice shall be.
Vafthrudnir 17. Tell me, Gagnrad! since on the floor thou wilt prove thy proficiency, how that plain is called, where in fight shall meet Surt and the gentle Gods?
Gagnrad 18. Vigrid the plain is called, where in fight shall meet Surt and the gentle Gods; a hundred rasts it is on every side. That plain is to them decreed.
Vafthrudnir 19. Wise art thou, o guest! Approach the Jötuns bench, and sitting let us together talk: we will our heads in the hall pledge, guest! for wise utterance. ************************



21
Gagnrad 20. Tell me first, if thy wit suffices, and thou, Vafthrudnir! knowest, whence first came the earth, and the high heaven, thou, sagacious Jötun?
Vafthrudnir 21. From Ymir’s flesh the earth was formed, and from his bones the hills, the heaven from the skull of that ice-cold giant, and from his blood the sea.
Gagnrad 22. Tell me secondly, if thy wit suffices, and thou, Vafthrudnir! knowest, whence came the moon, which over mankind passes, and the sun likewise?
Vafthrudnir 23. Mundilfoeri hight he, who the moon’s father is, and eke the sun’s: round heaven journey each day they must, to count years for men.
Gagnrad 24. Tell me thirdly, since thou art called wise, and if thou, Vafthrudnir! knowest, whence came the day, which over people passes, and night with waning moons?



22
Vafthrudnir 25. Delling hight he who the day’s father is, but night was of Nörvi born; the new and waning moons the beneficent powers created, to count years for men.
Gagnrad 26. Tell me fourthly, since they pronounce thee sage, and if thou, Vafthrudnir! knowest, whence winter came, and warm summer first among the wise gods?
Vafthrudnir 27. Vindsval hight he, who winter’s father is, and Svasud summer’s; yearly they both shall ever journey, until the powers perish.
Gagnrad 28. Tell me fifthly, since they pronounce thee sage, and if thou, Vafthrudnir! knowest, which of the Æsir earliest, or of Ymir’s sons in days of old existed?
Vafthrudnir 29. Countless winters, ere earth was formed, was Bergelmir born; Thrudgelmir was his sire, his grandsire Aurgelmir.



23
Gagnrad 30. Tell me sixthly, since thou art called wise, and if thou, Vafthrudnir! knowest, whence first came Aurgelmir, among the Jötun’s sons, thou sagacious Jötun?
Vafthrudnir 31. From Elivagar sprang venom drops, which grew till they became a Jötun; but sparks flew from the south-world: to the ice the fire gave life.
Gagnrad 32. Tell me seventhly, since thou art called wise, and if thou knowest, Vafthrudnir! how he children begat, the bold Jötun, as he had no giantess’s company?
Vafthrudnir 33. Under the armpit grew, ‘tis said, of the Hrimthurs, a girl and boy together; foot with foot begat, of that wise Jötun, a six-headed son.

24
Vafthrudnir 35. Countless winters, ere earth was formed, Bergelmir was born. That I first remember, when that wise Jötun in an ark was laid.
Gagnrad 36. Tell me ninthly, since thou art called wise, and if thou knowest, Vafthrudnir! whence the wind comes, that over ocean passes, itself invisible to man?
Vafthrudnir 37. Hræsvelg he is called, who at the end of heaven sits, a Jötun in an eagle’s plumage: from his wings comes, it is said, the wind, that over all men passes.
Gagnrad 38. Tell me tenthly, since thou all the origin of the gods knowest, Vafthrudnir! whence Niörd came among the Æsir’s sons? O’er fanes and offer-steads he rules by hundreds, yet was not among the Æsir born.
Vafthrudnir 39. In Vanaheim wise powers him created, and to the gods a hostage gave. At the world’s dissolution he will return to the wise Vanir.



25
Gagnrad 40. Tell me eleventhly, since all the condition of the gods thou knowest, Vafthrudnir! what the Einherjar do in Hærfather’s halls, until the powers perish?
Vafthrudnir 41. All the Einherjar in Odin’s halls each day together fight; the fallen they choose, and from the conflict ride; beer with the Æsir drink, of Sæhrimnir eat their fill, then sit in harmony together.
Gagnrad 42. Tell me twelfthly, as thou all the condition of the gods knowest, Vafthrudnir! of the Jötuns’ secrets, and of all the gods’, say what truest is, thou all-knowing Jötun!
Vafthrudnir 43. Of the secrets of the Jötuns and of all the gods, I can truly tell; for I have over each world travelled; to nine worlds I came, to Niflhel beneath: here die men from Hel.



26
Gagnrad 44. Much have I journeyed, much experienced, mighty ones many proved. What mortals will live, when the great “Fimbulwinter” shall from men have passed?
Vafthrudnir 45. Lif and Lifthrasir; but they will be concealed in Hoddmimir’s holt. The morning dews they will have for food. From them shall men be born.
Gagnrad 46. Much have I journeyed, much experienced, mighty ones many proved. Whence will come the sun in that fair heaven, when Fenrir has this devoured?
Vafthrudnir 47. A daughter shall Alfrödull bear, ere Fenrir shall have swallowed her. The maid shall ride, when the powers die, on her mother’s course.
Gagnrad 48. Much have I journeyed, (etc.) who are the maidens that o’er the ocean travel, wise of spirit, journey?



27
Vafthrudnir 49. O’er people’s dwellings three descend of Mögthrasir’s maidens, the sole Hamingiur who are in the world, although with Jötuns nurtured.
Gagnrad 50. Much have I journeyed, (etc.) Which of the Æsir will rule o’er the gods’ possession, when Surt’s fire shall be quenched?
Vafthrudnir 51. Vidar and Vali will the gods’ holy fanes inhabit, when Surt’s fire shall be quenched. Modi and Magni will Mjöllnir possess, and warfare strive to end.
Gagnrad 52. Much have I journeyed, (etc.) What of Odin will the life’s end be, when the powers perish?
Vafthrudnir 53. The wolf will the father of men devour; him Vidar will avenge: he his cold jaws will cleave, in conflict with the wolf.
Gagnrad 54. Much have I journeyed, (etc.) What said Odin in his son’s ear, ere he on the pile was laid?



28
Vafthrudnir 55. That no one knoweth, what thou in days of old saidst in thy son’s ear. With dying mouth my ancient saws I have said, and the gods’ destruction. With Odin I have contended in wise utterances: of men thou ever art the wisest!

Grímnismál: The Lay of Grimnir
The subject is wholly mythological
King Hraudung had two sons, one named Agnar, the other Geirröd. Agnar was ten, and Geirröd eight winters old. They both rowed out in a boat, with their hooks and lines, to catch small fish; but the wind drove them out to sea. In the darkness of the night they were wrecked on the shore, and went up into the country, where they found a cottager, with whom they stayed through the winter. The cottager’s wife brought up Agnar, and the cottager, Geirröd, and gave him good advice. In the spring the man got them a ship; but when he and his wife accompanied them to the strand, the man talked apart with Geirröd. They had a fair wind, and reached their father’s place. Geirröd was at the ship’s prow: he sprang on shore, but pushed the ship out, saying, “Go where an evil spirit may get thee.” The vessel was driven out to sea, but Geirröd went up to the town, where he was well received; but his father was dead. Geirröd was then taken for king, and became a famous man. Odin and Frigg were sitting in Hlidskialf, looking over all the world. Odin said, “Seest thou Agnar, thy foster-son, where he is getting children with a giantess in a cave? while Geirröd, my foster-son, is a king residing in his country.” Frigg answered, “He is so inhospitable that he tortures his guests, if he thinks too many come.” Odin replied that that was the greatest falsehood; and they wagered thereupon. Frigg sent her waiting-maid Fulla to bid Geirröd be on his guard, lest the trollmann who was coming should do him harm, and also say that a token whereby he might be known was, that no dog, however fierce, would attack him. But that King Geirröd was not hospitable was mere idle talk. He, nevertheless, caused the man to be secured whom no dog would assail. He was clad in a blue cloak, and was named Grimnir, and would say no more concerning himself, although he was questioned. The king ordered him to be tortured to make him confess, and to be set between two fires; and there he sat for eight nights. King Geirröd had a son ten years old, whom he named Agnar, after his brother. Agnar went to Grimnir and gave him a full horn to drink from, saying that the king did wrong in causing him to be tortured, though innocent. Grimnir drank from it. The fire had then so approached him that his cloak was burnt; whereupon he said:
1. Fire! thou art hot, and much too great; flame! let us separate. My garment is singed, although I lift it up, my cloak is scorched before it.



30
2. Eight nights have I sat between fires here, and to me no one food has offered, save only Agnar, the son of Geirröd, who alone shall rule over the land of the Goths.
3. Be thou blessed, Agnar! as blessed as the god of men bids thee to be. For one draught thou never shalt get better recompense.
4. Holy is the land, which I see lying to Æsir and Alfar near; but in Thrundheim Thor shall dwell until the powers perish.
5. Ydalir it is called, where Ullr has himself a dwelling made. Alfheim the gods to Frey gave in days of yore for a tooth-gift.
6. The third dwelling is, where the kind powers have with silver decked the hall; Valaskjalf ‘tis called, which for himself acquired the Ás in days of old.
7. Sökkvabekk the fourth is named oe’r which the gelid waves resound; Odin and Saga there, joyful each day, from golden beakers quaff.



31
8. Gladsheim the fifth is named, there the golden-bright Valhall stands spacious, there Hropt selects each day those men who die by weapons.
9. Easily to be known is, by those who to Odin come, the mansion by its aspect. Its roof with spears is laid, its hall with shields is decked, with corslets are its benches strewed.
10. Easily to be known is, by those who to Odin come, the mansion by its aspect. A wolf hangs before the western door, over it an eagle hovers.
11. Thrymheim the sixth is named, where Thiassi dwelt, that all-powerful Jötun; but Skadi now inhabits, the bright bride of the gods, her father’s ancient home.
12. Breidablik is the seventh, where Baldr has built for himself a hall, in that land, in which I know exists the fewest crimes.
13. Himinbjörg is the eighth, where Heimdall, it is said, rules o’er the holy fanes: there the gods’ watchman,in his tranquil home, drinks joyful the good mead.



32
14. Folkvang is the ninth, there Freyja directs the sittings in the hall. She half the fallen chooses each day, but Odin th’ other half.
15. Glitnir is the tenth; it is on gold sustained, and eke with silver decked. There Forseti dwells throughout all time, and every strife allays.
16. Noatun is the eleventh, there Niörd has himself a dwelling made, prince of men; guiltless of sin, he rules o’er the high-built fane.
17. O’ergrown with branches and high grass is Vidar’s spacious Landvidi: There will the son descend, from the steed’s back, bold to avenge his father.
18. Andhrimnir makes, in Eldhrimnir, Sæhrimnir to boil, of meats the best; but few know how many Einherjar it feeds.
19. Geri and Freki the war-wont sates, the triumphant sire of hosts; but on wine only the famed in arms, Odin, ever lives.



33
20. Hugin and Munin fly each day over the spacious earth. I fear for Hugin, that he come not back, yet more anxious am I for Munin.
21. Thund roars; joyful in Thiodvitnir’s water lives the fish; the rapid river seems too great for the battle-steed to ford.
22. Valgrind is the lattice called, in the plain that stands, holy before the holy gates: ancient is that lattice, but few only know how it is closed with lock.
23. Five hundred doors, and forty eke, I think, are in Valhall. Eight hundred Einherjar will at once from each door go when they issue with the wolf to fight.
34. Five hundred floors, and forty eke, I think, has Bilskirnir with its windings. Of all the roofed houses that I know, is my son’s the greatest.
25. Heidrun the goat is called, that stands o’er Odin’s hall, and bites from Lærad’s branches. He a bowl shall fill with the bright mead; that drink shall never fail.



34
26. Eikthyrnir the hart is called, that stands o’er Odin’s hall, and bites from Lærad’s branches; from his horns fall drops into Hvergelmir, whence all waters rise:
27. Sid and Vid, Soekin and Eikin, Svöl and Gunntro, Fiörm and Fimbulthul, Rin and Rennandi, Gipul and Göpul, Gömul and Geirvimul: they round the gods’ dwellings wind. Thyn and Vin, Thöll and Höll, Grad and Gunnthorin.
28. Vina one is called, a second Vegsvin, a third Thiodnuma; Nyt and Nöt, Nön and Hrön, Slid and Hrid, Sylg and Ylg, Vid and Van, Vönd and Strönd, Giöll and Leipt; these (two) fall near to men, but fall hence to Hel,
29. Körmt and Örmt, and the Kerlaugs twain: these Thor must wade each day, when he to council goes at Yggdrasil’s ash; for the As-bridge is all on fire, the holy waters boil.



35
30. Glad and Gyllir, Gler and Skeidbrimir, Sillfrintopp and Sinir, Gisl and Falhofnir, Gulltopp and Lettfeti; on these steeds the Æsir each day ride, when they to council go, at Yggdrasil’s ash.
31. Three roots stand on three ways under Yggdrasil’s ash: Hel under one abides, under the second the Hrimthursar, under the third mankind.
32. Ratatösk is the squirrel named, which has to run in Yggdrasil’s ash; he from above the eagle’s words must carry, and beneath to Nidhögg repeat.
33. Harts there are also four, which from its summits, arch-necked, gnaw. Dain and Dvalin, Duneyr and Durathror.
34. More serpents lie under Yggdrasil’s ash, than any one would think of witless mortals: Goin and Moin they are Grafvitnir’s sons Grabak and Grafvöllud, Ofnir and Svafnir, will, I ween, the branches of that tree ever lacerate.



36
35. Yggdrasil’s ash hardship suffers greater than men know of; a hart bites it above, and in its side it rots, Nidhögg beneath tears it.
36. Hrist and Mist the horn shall bear me Skeggöld and Skögul, Hlökk and Herfjötur, Hildi and Thrudi, Göll and Geirölul, Randgrid and Radgrid, and Reginleif, these bear beer to the Einherjar.
37. Arvakr and Alsvid, theirs ‘tis up hence fasting the sun to draw: under their shoulder the gentle powers, the Æsir, have concealed an iron-coolness.
38. Svalin the shield is called, which stands before the sun, the refulgent deity: rocks and ocean must, I ween, be burnt, fell it from its place.
39. Sköll the wolf is named, that the fair-faced goddess to the ocean chases; another Hati hight, he is Hrodvitnir’s son; he the bright maid of heaven shall precede.



37
40. Of Ymir’s flesh was earth created, of his blood the sea, of his bones the hills, of his hair trees and plants, of his skull the heaven;
41. And of his brows the gentle powers formed Midgard for the sons of men; but of his brain the heavy clouds are all created.
42. Ullr’s and all the gods’ favour shall have, whoever first shall look to the fire; for open will the dwelling be, to the Æsir’s sons, when the kettles are lifted off.1
43. Ivald’s sons went in days of old Skidbladnir to form, of ships the best, for the bright Frey, Njörd’s benign son.
44. Yggdrasil’s ash is of all trees most excellent, and of all ships, Skidbladnir, of the Æsir, Odin, and of horses, Sleipnir, Bifröst of bridges, and of skalds, Bragi, Habrok of hawks, and of dogs, Garm, (Brimir of swords.)
1. What in this strophe is said of Ullr has apparently reference to a lost myth. It would seem that, through
the intervention of the kettles, the Æsir were unable to see Odin’s unpleasant position between the two fires.



38
45. Now I my face have raised to the gods’ triumphant sons, at that will welcome help awake; from all the Æsir, that shall penetrate, to Aegir’s bench, to Aegir’s compotation.2
46. I am called Grim, I am called Gangleri, Herian and Hjalmberi, Thekk and Thridi, Thund and Ud, Helblindi and Har,
47. Sad and Svipall, and Sanngetall, Herteit and Hnikar Bileyg, Baleyg, Bölverk, Fjölnir, Grim and Grimnir, Glapsvid and Fjölsvid,
48. Sidhött, Sidskegg Sigfödr, Hnikud, Alfödr, Valfödr, Atrid and Farmatýr; by one name I never have been called, since among men I have gone.
49. Grimnir I am called at Geirröd’s, and at Asmund’s Jalk and Kialar, when a sledge I drew; Thror at the public meetings, Vidur in battles, Oski and Omi, Jafnhar and Biflindi, Göndlir and Harbard with the gods.
2. My version of this strophe is not in accordance with those of other interpreters. Odin raises his countenance to
heaven, in full confidence that when seen help will forthwith be afforded him. Under the name of Ægir, Gierrod is
generally understood: I rather think the meaning to be, that all the Æsir who [sit at] Ægir’s compotation will forth
with come to his aid.



39
50. Svidur and Svidrir I was at Sökkmimir’s called, and beguiled that ancient Jötun, when of Midvitnir’s renowned son I was the sole destroyer.
51. Drunken art thou, Geirröd, thou hast drunk too much, thou art greatly by mead beguiled. Much didst thou lose, when thou wast of my help bereft, of all the Einherjar’s and Odin’s favour.
52. Many things I told thee, but thou hast few remembered: thy friends mislead thee. My friend’s sword lying I see, with blood all dripping.
53. The fallen by the sword Ygg shall now have; thy life is now run out: Wroth with thee are the Disir: Odin thou now shalt see: draw near to me if thou canst.
54. Odin I now am named, Ygg I was called before, before that, Thund, Vakr and Skilfing, Vafudr and Hroptatýr, with the gods, Gaut and Jalk, Ofnir and Svafnir, all which I believe to be names of me alone.
King Geirröd was sitting with his sword lying across his knees, half drawn from the scabbard, but



40
on finding that it was Odin, he rose for the purpose of removing him from the fires, when the sword slipt from his hand with the hilt downwards; and the king having stumbled, the sword pierced him through and killed him. Odin then vanished, and Agnar was king for a long time after.



41
Hrafnagaldr Odins: Odin’s Ravens’ Song
This very obscure poem has been regarded as a fragment only of a poem, of which the beginning and end are wanting. With regard to the beginning, the want may possibly be more apparent than real; the strophes 2-5 being in fact a sort of introduction, although they do not at first strike us as such, in consequence of the obscurity of the 1st strophe, which seems very slightly connected with the following ones, in which the gods and dwarfs are described as in council, on account of certain warnings and forebodings of their approaching downfall, or Ragnarök. Another point of difficulty is its title, there being nothing in the whole poem to connect it with Odin’s ravens, except the mention of Hugr (Hugin) in the 3rd strophe. Erik Halson, a learned Icelander, after having spent or wasted ten years in an attempt to explain this poem, confessed that he understood little or nothing of it. In its mythology, too, we find parts assigned to some of the personages, of which no traces occur in either Sæmunds’ or Snorri’s Edda; though we are hardly justified in pronouncing it, with more than one scholar of eminence, a fabrication of later times.
1. Alfather works, the Alfar discern, the Vanir know, the Nornir indicate, the Ividia brings forth, men endure, the Thursar await, the Valkyriur long.
2. The forebodings the Æsir suspected to be evil; treacherous Vættar had the runes confounded. Urd was enjoined to guard Odhroerir, powerfully to protect it against the increasing multitude.
3. Hug then goes forth, explores the heavens, the powers fear disaster from delay. ‘Twas Thrain’s belief that the dream was ominous; Dain’s thought that the dream was dark.



42
4. Among the dwarfs virtue decays; worlds sink down to Ginnung’s abyss. Oft will Asvid strike them down, oft the fallen again collect.
5. Stand no longer shall earth or sun. The stream of air with corruption laden shall not cease. Hidden is in Mim’s limpid well men’s certain knowledge. Understand ye yet, or what? ************************
6. In the dales dwells the prescient Dis, from Yggdrasil’s ash sunk down, of alfen race, Idun by name, the youngest of Ivaldi’s elder children.
7. She ill brooked her descent, under the hoar tree’s trunk confined. She would not happy be with Nörvi’s daughter, accustomed to a pleasanter abode at home.



43
8. The triumphant gods saw Nanna sorrowing in earth’s deep sanctuaries; a wolf ’s skin they gave her, in which herself she clad, changed her feelings, practised guile, alter’d her aspect.
9. Vidrir selected Bifröst’s guardian, of the Giöll-sun’s keeper to inquire all that she knew of every world; Bragi and Lopt should witness bear.
10. Magic songs they sung, rode on wolves the god and gods. At the heavenly house, Odin listened, in Hlidskjalf; let them go forth on their long way.
11. The wise god asked the cupbearer of the gods’ progeny and their associates, whether of heaven, or Hel, or earth, she knew the origin, duration, or dissolution?



44
12. She spoke not, she could no words to the anxious gods bring forth, nor a sound uttered; tears flowed from the head’s orbs; with pain repressed they flow anew.
13. As from the east, from Elivagar, the thorn is impelled by the ice-cold Thurs, wherewith Dain all people strikes over the fair mid-earth;
14. When every faculty is lulled, the hands sink, totters with drowsiness the bright, sword-girt Ás; drives away the current the giantess’s blandishment of the mind’s agitations of all people,
15. So to the gods appeared Jorun to be affected, with sorrows swollen, when they no answer got; they strove the more the greater the repulse; still less than they had hoped did their words prevail.
16. When the leader of the inquiring travellers, the guardian of Herian’s loud-sounding horn took the son of Nal for his companion, Grimnir’s skald at the place kept watch.



45
17. Vingolf reached Vidur’s ministers, both borne by Forniots kin. They entered, and the Æsir forthwith saluted, at Ygg’s convivial meeting.
18. Hangatyr they hailed, of Æsir the most blissful; potent drink in the high seat they wished him to enjoy, and the gods to sit happy at the feast, ever with Yggiung pleasure to share.
19. On benches seated, at Bölverk’s bidding, the company of gods were with Sæhrimnir sated. Skögul at the tables, from Hnikar’s vessel, measured out mead, in Mimir’s horns.
20. Of many thing inquired, when the meal was over, the high gods of Heimdall, the goddesses of Loki, whether the maid had uttered divinations or wise words? From noon until twilight’s advent.



46
21. Ill they showed it had fallen out, their errand bootless, little to glory in. A lack of counsel seemed likely, how from the maiden they might an answer get.
22. Omi answered; “Night is the time for new counsels; till the morrow let reflect each one competent to give advice helpful to the Æsir.”
23. Ran along the ways of mother Rind, the desired repast of Fenrisulf. Went from the guild, bade the gods farewell Hropt and Frigg, as, before Hrimfaxi,
24. The son of Delling urged on his horse adorned with precious jewels. Over Mannheim shines the horse’s mane, the steed Dvalin’s deluder drew in his chariot.
25. In the north boundary of the spacious earth, under the outmost root of the noble tree, went to their couches Gygiar and Thursar, spectres, dwarfs, and Murk Alfs.



47
26. The powers rose, the Alfs’ illuminator northwards towards Niflheim chased the night. Up Argjöll ran Ulfrun’s son, the mighty hornblower, of heaven’s heights.



48



49
Vegtamskviþa eða Baldrs Draumar
The Lay of Vegtam, or Baldr’s Dreams
1. Together were the Æsir all in council, and the Asyniur all in conference, and they consulted, the mighty gods, why Baldr had oppressive dreams.
2. To that god his slumber was most afflicting; his auspicious dreams seemed departed. They the Jötuns questioned, wise seers of the future, whether this might not forebode calamity?
3. The responses said that to death destined was Ullr’s kinsman, of all the dearest: that caused grief to Frigg and Svafnir, and to the other powers On a course they resolved:
4. That they would send to every being, assurance to solicit, Baldr not to harm. All species swore oaths to spare him; Frigg received all their vows and compacts.



50
5. Valfather fears something defective; he thinks the Hamingiur may have departed; the Æsir he convenes, their counsel craves; at the deliberation much is devised.
6. Uprose Odin lord of men, and on Sleipnir he the saddle laid; rode thence down to Niflhel. A dog he met, from Hel coming.
7. It was blood-stained on its breast, on its slaughter-craving throat, and nether jaw. It bayed and widely gaped at the sire of magic song: long it howled.
8. Forth rode Odin the ground rattled till to Hel’s lofty house he came. Then rode Ygg to the eastern gate, where he knew there was a Vala’s grave.



51
9. To the prophetess he began a magic song to chant, towards the north looked, potent runes applied, a spell pronounced, an answer demanded, until compelled she rose, and with deathlike voice she said:
Vala 10. “What man is this, to me unknown who has for me increased an irksome course? I have with snow been decked by rain beaten, and with dew moistened: long have I been dead.”
Vegtam 11. “Vegtam is my name, I am Valtam’s son. Tell thou me of Hel: from earth I call on thee. For whom are those benches strewed o’er with rings, those costly couches o’erlaid with gold?”
Vala 12. “Here stands mead, for Baldr brewed, over the bright potion a shield is laid; but the Æsir race are in despair. By compulsion I have spoken I will now be silent.”



52
Vegtam 13. “Be thou not silent, Vala! I will question thee, until I know all. I will yet know who will Baldr’s slayer be, and Odin’s son of life bereave.”
Vala 14. “Hödr will hither his glorious brother send, he of Baldr will the slayer be, and Odin’s son of life bereave. By compulsion I have spoken; I will now be silent.”
Vegtam 15. “Be not silent, Vala! I will question thee, until I know all. I will yet know who on Hödr vengeance will inflict or Baldr’s slayer raise on the pile.”
Vala 16. “Rind a son shall bear, in the western halls: he shall slay Odin’s son, when one night old. He a hand will not wash, nor his head comb, ere he to the pile has borne Baldr’s adversary. By compulsion I have spoken; I will now be silent.”



53
Vegtam 17. “Be not silent, Vala! I will question thee, until I know all. I will yet know who the maidens are, that weep at will, and heavenward cast their neck-veils? Tell me but that: till then thou sleepest not.”
Vala 18. “Not Vegtam art thou, as I before believed; rather art thou Odin, lord of men!”
Odin 19. “Thou art no Vala, nor wise woman, rather art thou the mother of three Thursar.”
Vala 20. “Home ride thou, Odin! and exult. Thus shall never more man again visit me, until Loki free from his bonds escapes, and Ragnarök all-destroying comes.”



54



55
Hávamál: The High One’s Lay
1. All door-ways, before going forward, should be looked to; for difficult it is to know where foes may sit within a dwelling.
2. Givers, hail! A guest is come in: where shall he sit? In much haste is he, who on the ways has to try his luck.
3. Fire is needful to him who is come in, and whose knees are frozen; food and raiment a man requires, who o’er the fell has travelled.
4. Water to him is needful who for refection comes, a towel and hospitable invitation, a good reception; if he can get it, discourse and answer.
5. Wit is needful to him who travels far: at home all is easy. A laughing-stock is he who nothing knows, and with the instructed sits.
Odin is the “High One.” The poem is a collection of rules and maxims, and stories of himself, some of them
not very consistent with our ideas of a supreme deity.



56
6. Of his understanding no one should be proud, but rather in conduct cautious. When the prudent and taciturn come to a dwelling, harm seldom befalls the cautious; for a firmer friend no man ever gets than great sagacity.
7. A way guest1 who to refection comes, keeps a cautious silence, (Or/Wit is needful to him who travels far: harm seldom befalls the wary;) with his ears listens, and with his eyes observes: so explores every prudent man.
8. He is happy, who for himself obtains fame and kind words: less sure is that which a man must have in another’s breast.
9. He is happy, who in himself possesses fame and wit while living; for bad counsels have oft been received from another’s breast.
1. In the Copenhagen paper Ms. F. this strophe begins with the following three lines:
Wit is needful
to him who travels far:
harm seldom befalls the wary:
They are printed in the Stockholm edition of the original Afzelius and Rask, and in the Swedish translations
by Afzelius.



57
10. A better burthen no man bears on the way than much good sense; that is thought better than riches in a strange place; such is the recourse of the indigent.
11. A worse provision on the way he cannot carry than too much beer-bibbing; so good is not, as it is said, beer for the sons of men.
12. A worse provision no man can take from table than too much beer-bibbing: for the more he drinks the less control he has of his own mind.
13. Oblivion’s heron ‘tis called that over potations hovers, he steals the minds of men. With this bird’s pinions I was fettered in Gunnlöd’s dwelling.
14. Drunk I was, I was over-drunk, at that cunning Fjalar’s. It’s the best drunkenness, when every one after it regains his reason.
15. Taciturn and prudent, and in war daring should a king’s children be; joyous and liberal every one should be until the hour of his death.



58
16. A cowardly man thinks he will ever live, if warfare he avoids; but old age will give him no peace, though spears may spare him.
17. A fool gapes when to a house he comes, to himself mutters or is silent; but all at once, if he gets drink, then is the man’s mind displayed.
18. He alone knows who wanders wide, and has much experienced, by what disposition each man is ruled, who common sense possesses.
19. Let a man hold the cup, yet of the mead drink moderately, speak sensibly or be silent. As of a fault no man will admonish thee, if thou goest betimes to sleep.
20. A greedy man, if he be not moderate, eats to his mortal sorrow. Oftentimes his belly draws laughter on a silly man, who among the prudent comes.
21. Cattle know when to go home, and then from grazing cease; but a foolish man never knows his stomach’s measure.



59
22. A miserable man, and ill-conditioned, sneers at every thing; one thing he knows not, which he ought to know, that he is not free from faults.
23. A foolish man is all night awake, pondering over everything; he then grows tired; and when morning comes, all is lament as before.
24. A foolish man thinks all who on him smile to be his friends; he feels it not, although they speak ill of him, when he sits among the clever.
25. A foolish man thinks all who speak him fair to be his friends; but he will find, if into court he comes, that he has few advocates.
26. A foolish man thinks he know everything if placed in unexpected difficulty; but he knows not what to answer, if to the test he is put.
27. A foolish man, who among people comes, had best be silent; for no one knows that he knows nothing, unless he talks to much. He who previously knew nothing



60
will still know nothing talk he ever so much.
28. He thinks himself wise, who can ask questions and converse also; conceal his ignorance no one can, because it circulates among men.
29. He utters too many futile words who is never silent; a garrulous tongue, if it be not checked, sings often to its own harm.
30. For a gazing-stock no man shall have another, although he come a stranger to his house. Many a one thinks himself wise, if he is not questioned, and can sit in a dry habit.
31. Clever thinks himself the guest who jeers a guest, if he takes to flight. Knows it not certainly he who prates at meat, whether he babbles among foes.
32. Many men are mutually well-disposed, yet at table will torment each other. That strife will ever be; guest will guest irritate.
33. Early meals a man should often take, unless to a friend’s house he goes; else he will sit and mope, will seem half-famished, and can of few things inquire.



61
34. Long is and indirect the way to a bad friend’s, though by the road he dwell; but to a good friend’s the paths lie direct, though he be far away.
35. A guest should depart, not always stay in one place. The welcome becomes unwelcome, if he too long continues in another’s house.
36. One’s own house is best, small though it be; at home is every one his own master. Though he but two goats possess, and a straw-thatched cot, even that is better than begging.
37. One’s own house is best, small though it be, at home is every one his own master. Bleeding at heart is he, who has to ask for food at every meal-tide.
38. Leaving in the field his arms, let no man go a foot’s length forward; for it is hard to know when on the way a man may need his weapon.
39. I have never found a man so bountiful, or so hospitable that he refused a present; of his property so liberal that he scorned a recompense.



62
40. Of the property which he has gained no man should suffer need; for the hated oft is spared what for the dear was destined. Much goes worse than is expected.
41. With arms and vestments friends should each other gladden, those which are in themselves most sightly. Givers and requiters are longest friends, if all (else) goes well.2
42. To his friend a man should be a friend, and gifts with gifts requite. Laughter with laughter men should receive, but leasing with lying.
43. To his friend a man should be a friend, to him and to his friend; but of his foe no man shall the friend’s friend be.
44. Know, if thou has a friend whom thou fully trustest, and from whom thou woulds’t good derive, thou shouldst blend thy mind with his, and gifts exchange, and often go to see him.
45. If thou hast another, whom thou little trustest, yet wouldst good from him derive, thou shouldst speak him fair, but think craftily, and leasing pay with lying.
2. The sense of this line seems doubtful; I have adopted the version of Finn Magnusen.



63
46. But of him yet further, whom thou little trustest, and thou suspectest his affection; before him thou shouldst laugh, and contrary to thy thoughts speak: requital should the gift resemble.
47. I was once young, I was journeying alone, and lost my way; rich I thought myself, when I met another. Man is the joy of man.
48. Liberal and brave men live best, they seldom cherish sorrow; but a base-minded man dreads everything; the niggardly is uneasy even at gifts.
49. My garments in a field I gave away to two wooden men: heroes they seemed to be, when they got cloaks: exposed to insult is a naked man.
50. A tree withers that on a hill-top stands; protects it neither bark nor leaves: such is the man whom no one favours: why should he live long?
51. Hotter than fire love for five days burns between false friends; but is quenched when the sixth day comes, and friendship is all impaired.



64
52. Something great is not (always) to be given, praise is often for a trifle bought. With half a loaf and a tilted vessel I got myself a comrade.
53. Little are the sand grains, little the wits, little the minds of (some) men; for all men are not wise alike: men are everywhere by halves.
54. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise: of those men the lives are fairest, who know much well.
55. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise; for a wise man’s heart is seldom glad, if he is all-wise who owns it.
56. Moderately wise should each one be, but never over-wise. His destiny let know no man beforehand; his mind will be freest from care.
57. Brand burns from brand until it is burnt out; fire is from fire quickened. Man to man becomes known by speech, but a fool by his bashful silence.



65
58. He should early rise, who another’s property or life desires to have. Seldom a sluggish wolf gets prey, or a sleeping man victory.
59. Early should rise he who has few workers, and go his work to see to; greatly is he retarded who sleeps the morn away. Wealth half depends on energy.
60. Of dry planks and roof-shingles a man knows the measure; of the fire-wood that may suffice, both measure and time.
61. Washed and refected let a man ride to the Thing,3 although his garments be not too good; of his shoes and breeches let no one be ashamed, nor of his horse, although he have not a good one.
62. Inquire and impart should every man of sense, who will be accounted sage. Let one only know, a second may not; if three, all the world knows.
63. Gasps and gapes, when to the sea he comes, the eagles over old ocean; so is a man,
3. The public meeting.



66
who among many comes, and has few advocates.
64. His power should every sagacious man use with discretion; for he will find, when among the bold he comes, that no one alone is the doughtiest.
65. Circumspect and reserved every man should be, and wary in trusting friends. Of the words that a man says to another he often pays the penalty.
66. Much too early I came to many places, but too late to others; the beer was drunk, or not ready: the disliked seldom hits the moment.
67. Here and there I should have been invited, if I a meal had needed; or two hams had hung, at that true friend’s, where of one I had eaten.
68. Fire is best among the sons of men, and the sight of the sun, if his health a man can have, with a life free from vice.
69. No man lacks everything, although his health be bad: one in his sons is happy, one in abundant wealth, one in his good works.



67
70. It is better to live, even to live miserably; a living man can always get a cow. I saw fire consume the rich man’s property, and death stood without his door.
71. The halt can ride on horseback, the one-handed drive cattle; the deaf fight and be useful: to be blind is better than to be burnt:4 no ones gets good from a corpse.
72. A son is better, even if born late, after his father’s departure. Gravestones seldom stand by the way-side unless raised by a kinsman to a kinsman.
73. Two are adversaries: the tongue is the bane of the head: under every cloak I expect a hand. **************************** ****************************
74. At night is joyful he who is sure of travelling enjoyment. (A ship’s yards are short.)5 Variable is an autumn night. Many are the weather’s changes in five days, but more in a month.
4. That is dead on the funeral pyre.
5. This line is evidently an interpolation.



68
75. He (only) knows not who knows nothing, that many a one apes another. One man is rich, another poor: let him not be thought blameworthy.
76. Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves also die; but the fair fame never dies of him who has earned it.
77. Cattle die, kindred die, we ourselves also die; but I know one thing that never dies, judgement on each one dead.
78. Full storehouses I saw at Dives’ sons’: now bear they the beggar’s staff. Such are riches; as is the twinkling of an eye: of friends they are most fickle.
79. A foolish man, if he acquires wealth or a woman’s love, pride grows within him, but wisdom never: he goes on more and more arrogant.
80. Then ‘tis made manifest, if of runes thou questionest him, those to the high ones known, which the great powers invented, and the great talker6 painted, that he had best hold silence.
6. Odin.



69
81. At eve the day is to be praised, a woman after she is burnt, a sword after it is proved, a maid after she is married, ice after it has passed away, beer after it is drunk.
82. In the wind one should hew wood, in a breeze row out to sea, in the dark talk with a lass: many are the eyes of day. In a ship voyages are to be made, but a shield is for protection, a sword for striking, but a damsel for a kiss.
83. By the fire one should drink beer, on the ice slide; but a horse that is lean, a sword that is rusty; feed a horse at home, but a dog at the farm.
84. In a maiden’s words no one should place faith, nor in what a woman says; for on a turning wheel have their hearts been formed, and guile in their breasts been laid;
85. In a creaking bow, a burning flame, a yawning wolf, a chattering crow, a grunting swine, a rootless tree, a waxing wave, a boiling kettle,



70
86. A flying dart, a falling billow, a one night’s ice, a coiled serpent, a woman’s bed-talk, or a broken sword, a bear’s play, or a royal child,
87. A sick calf, a self-willed thrall, a flattering prophetess, a corpse newly slain, (a serene sky, a laughing lord, a barking dog, and a harlot’s grief);
88. An early sown field let no one trust, nor prematurely in a son: weather rules the field, and wit the son, each of which is doubtful;
89. A brother’s murderer, though on the high road met, a half-burnt house, an over-swift horse, (a horse is useless, if a leg be broken), no man is so confiding as to trust any of these.
90. Such is the love of women, who falsehood meditate, as if one drove not rough-shod, on slippery ice, a spirited two-years old and unbroken horse; or as in a raging storm a helmless ship is beaten;



71
or as if the halt were set to catch a reindeer in the thawing fell.7
91. Openly I now speak, because I both sexes know: unstable are men’s minds towards women; “tis then we speak most fair when we most falsely think: that deceives even the cautious.
92. Fair shall speak, and money offer, who would obtain a woman’s love. Praise the form of a fair damsel; he gets who courts her.
93. At love should no one ever wonder in another: a beauteous countenance oft captivates the wise, which captivates not the foolish.
94. Let no one wonder at another’s folly, it is the lot of many. All-powerful desire makes of the sons of men fools even of the wise.
95. The mind only knows what lies near the heart, that alone is conscious of our affections. No disease is worse to a sensible man than not to be content with himself.
7. From this line it appears that the poem is of Norwegian or Swedish origin, as the reindeer was unknown
in Iceland before the middle of the 18th century, when it was introduced by royal command.



72
96. That I experienced, when in the reeds I sat, awaiting my delight. Body and soul to me was that discreet maiden: nevertheless I posses her not.
97. Billing’s lass8 on her couch I found, sun-bright, sleeping. A prince’s joy to me seemed naught, if not with that form to live.
98. “Yet nearer eve must thou, Odin, come, if thou wilt talk the maiden over; all will be disastrous, unless we alone are privy to such misdeed.”
99. I returned, thinking to love, at her wise desire. I thought I should obtain her whole heart and love.
100. When next I came the bold warriors were all awake, with lights burning, and bearing torches: thus was the way to pleasure closed.
8. The story of Odin and Billing’s daughter is no longer extant; but compare the story of Odin and Rinda in
Saxo, p. 126, edit. Muller and Veleschow.



73
101. But at the approach of morn, when again I came, the household all was sleeping; the good damsel’s dog alone I found tied to the bed.
102. Many a fair maiden, when rightly known, towards men is fickle: that I experienced, when that discreet maiden I strove to seduce: contumely of every kind that wily girl heaped upon me; nor of that damsel gained I aught.
103. At home let a man be cheerful, and towards a guest liberal; of wise conduct he should be, of good memory and ready speech; if much knowledge he desires, he must often talk on good.
104. Fimbulfambi he is called who little has to say: such is the nature of the simple. *************************
105. The old Jötun I sought; now I am come back: little got I there by silence; in many words I spoke to my advantage in Suttung’s halls.



74
106. Gunnlöd gave me, on her golden seat, a draught of the precious mead; a bad recompense I afterwards made her, for her whole soul, her fervent love.
107. Rati’s mouth I caused to make a space, and to gnaw the rock; over and under me were the Jötun’s ways: thus I my head did peril.
108. Of a well-assumed form I made good use: few things fail the wise; for Odhrærir is now come up to men’s earthly dwellings.
109. ‘Tis to me doubtful that I could have come from the Jötun’s courts, had not Gunnlöd aided me, that good damsel, over whom I laid my arm.
110. On the day following came the Hrim-thursar, to learn something of the High One, in the High One’s hall: after Bölverk they inquired, whether he with the gods were come, or Suttung had destroyed him?



75
111. Odin, I believe, a ring-oath gave.9 Who in his faith will trust? Suttung defrauded, of his drink bereft, and Gunnlöd made to weep! ****************************
112. Time ‘tis to discourse from the preacher’s chair. By the well of Urd I silent sat, I saw and meditated, I listened to men’s words.
113. Of runes I heard discourse, and of things divine, nor of graving them were they silent, nor of sage counsels, at the High One’s hall. In the High One’s hall. I thus heard say:
114. I counsel thee, Loddfafnir, to take advice: thou wilt profit if thou takest it. Rise not at night, unless to explore, or art compelled to go out.
115. I counsel thee, Loddfafnir, to take advice, thou wilt profit if thou takest it. In an enchantress’s embrace thou mayest not sleep, so that in her arms she clasp thee.
9. In the pagan North oaths were taken on a holy ring or bracelet, as with us on the Gospels, a sacred ring being
kept in the temple for the purpose.



76
116. She will be the cause that thou carest not for Thing or prince’s words; food thou wilt shun and human joys; sorrowful wilt thou go to sleep.
117. I counsel thee, etc. Another’s wife entice thou never to secret converse.
118. I counsel thee, etc. By fell or firth if thou have to travel, provide thee well with food.
119. I counsel thee, etc. A bad man let thou never know thy misfortunes; for from a bad man thou never wilt obtain a return for thy good will.
120. I saw mortally wound a man a wicked woman’s words; a false tongue caused his death, and most unrighteously.
121. I counsel thee, etc. If thou knowest thou has a friend, whom thou well canst trust, go oft to visit him; for with brushwood overgrown, and with high grass, is the way that no one treads.



77
122. I counsel thee, etc. A good man attract to thee in pleasant converse; and salutary speech learn while thou livest.
123. I counsel thee, etc. With thy friend be thou never first to quarrel. Care gnaws the heart, if thou to no one canst thy whole mind disclose.
124. I counsel thee, etc. Words thou never shouldst exchange with a witless fool;
125. For from an ill-conditioned man thou wilt never get a return for good; but a good man will bring thee favour by his praise.
126. There is a mingling of affection, where one can tell another all his mind. Everything is better than being with the deceitful. He is not another’s friend who ever says as he says.
127. I counsel thee, etc. Even in three words quarrel not with a worse man: often the better yields, when the worse strikes.



78
128. I counsel thee, etc. Be not a shoemaker, nor a shaftmaker, unless for thyself it be; for a shoe if ill made, or a shaft if crooked, will call down evil on thee.
129. I counsel thee, etc. Wherever of injury thou knowest, regard that injury as thy own; and give to thy foes no peace.
130. I counsel thee, etc. Rejoiced at evil be thou never; but let good give thee pleasure.
131. I counsel thee, etc. In a battle look not up, (like swine the sons of men become) that men may not fascinate thee.
132. If thou wilt induce a good woman to pleasant converse, thou must promise fair, and hold to it; no one turns from good if it can be got.
133. I enjoin thee to be wary, but not over wary; at drinking be thou most wary, and with another’s wife; and thirdly, that thieves delude thee not.



79
134. With insult or derision treat thou never a guest or wayfarer, they often little know, who sit within, or what race they are who come.
135. Vices and virtues the sons of mortals bear in their breasts mingled; no one is so good that no failing attends him, nor so bad as to be good for nothing.
136. At a hoary speaker laugh thou never; often is good that which the aged utter, oft from a shriveled hide discreet words issue; from those whose skin is pendent and decked with scars, and who go tottering among the vile.
137. I counsel thee, etc. Rail not at a guest, nor from thy gate thrust him; treat well the indigent; they will speak well of thee.
138. Strong is the bar that must be raised to admit all. Do thou give a penny, or they will call down on thee every ill in thy limbs.



80
139. I counsel thee, etc. Wherever thou beer drinkest, invoke to thee the power of earth; for earth is good against drink, fire for distempers, the oak for constipation, a corn-ear for sorcery a hall for domestic strife. In bitter hates invoke the moon; the biter for bite-injuries is good; but runes against calamity; fluid let earth absorb.
RunatalsÞáttr Oðins: Odin’s Rune-song.10
140. I know that I hung, on a wind-rocked tree, nine whole nights, with a spear wounded, and to Odin offered, myself to myself; on that tree, of which no one knows from what root it springs.
141. Bread no one gave me, nor a horn of drink, downward I peered, to runes applied myself, wailing learnt them, then fell down thence.
142. Potent songs nine from the famed son I learned of Bölthorn, Bestla’s sire, and a draught obtained
10. The first eight strophes of this composition require an explanation which I am incompetent to afford.
They have had many interpreters and as many interpretations. The idea of Odin hanging on a tree would seem
to have been suggested by what we read of the grove at Upsala, or Sigtuna, in which the victims offered to that
deity were suspended from the trees. In the guise of an unknown wanderer, Odin may be supposed to have
been captured and thus offered to himself. It no doubt refers to some lost legend.



81
of the precious mead, drawn from Odhrærir.
143. Then I began to bear fruit, and to know many things, to grow and well thrive: word by word I sought out words, fact by fact I sought out facts.
144. Runes thou wilt find, and explained characters, very large characters, very potent characters, which the great speaker depicted, and the high powers formed, and the powers’ prince graved:
145. Odin among the Æsir, but among the Alfar, Dáin, and Dvalin for the dwarfs, Ásvid for the Jötuns: some I myself graved.
146. Knowest thou how to grave them? knowest thou how to expound them? knowest thou how to depict them? knowest thou how to prove them? knowest thou how to pray? knowest thou how to offer? knowest thou how to send?11 knowest thou how to consume?
147. “Tis better not to pray than too much offer; a gift ever looks to a return. ‘Tis better not to send than too much consume. So Thund graved
11. Probably, send them (the runes) forth on their several missions.



82
before the origin of men, where he ascended, to whence he afterwards came.
148. Those songs I know which the king’s wife knows not nor son of man. Help the first is called, for that will help thee against strifes and cares.
149. For the second I know, what the sons of men require, who will as leeches live. *********************** *********************** ***********************
150. For the third I know,12 if I have great need to restrain my foes, the weapons’ edge I deaden: of my adversaries nor arms nor wiles harm aught.
151. For the forth I know, if men place bonds on my limbs, I so sing that I can walk; the fetter starts from my feet, and the manacle from my hands.
152. For the fifth I know, I see a shot from a hostile hand, a shaft flying amid the host, so swift it cannot fly that I cannot arrest it, if only I get sight of it.
12. The miraculous powers here ascribed to Odin to himself bear, in many instances, a remarkable similar
ity to those attributed to him by Snorri.



83
153. For the sixth I know, if one wounds me with a green tree’s roots;13 also if a man declares hatred to me, harm shall consume them sooner than me.
154. For the seventh I know, if a lofty house I see blaze o’er its inmates, so furiously it shall not burn that I cannot save it. That song I can sing.
155. For the eighth I know, what to all is useful to learn: where hatred grows among the sons of men that I can quickly assuage.
156. For the ninth I know, if I stand in need my bark on the water to save, I can the wind on the waves allay, and the sea lull.
157. For the tenth I know, if I see troll-wives sporting in air, I can so operate that they will forsake their own forms, and their own minds.
158. For the eleventh I know, if I have to lead my ancient friends to battle,
13. The ancient inhabitants of the North believed that the roots of trees were particularly fitted for hurtful troll
dom, or witchcraft, and that wounds caused thereby were mortal. In India a similar superstition prevails of the hurt
fulness of the roots of trees.



84
under their shields I sing, and with power they go safe to the fight, safe from the fight; safe on every side they go.
159. For the twelfth I know, if on a tree I see a corpse swinging from a halter, I can so grave and in runes depict, that the man shall walk, and with me converse.
160. For the thirteenth I know, if on a young man I sprinkle water, he shall not fall, though he into battle come: that man shall not sink before swords.
161. For the fourteenth I know, if in the society of men I have to enumerate the gods, Æsir and Alfar, I know the distinctions of all. This few unskilled can do.
162. For the fifteenth I know what the dwarf Thiodreyrir sang before Delling’s doors. Strength he sang to the Æsir, and to the Alfar prosperity, wisdom to Hroptatýr.
163. For the sixteenth I know, if a modest maiden’s favour and affection I desire to possess, the soul I change of the white-armed damsel, and wholly turn her mind.



85
164. For the seventeenth I know, that that young maiden will reluctantly avoid me. These songs, Loddfafnir! thou wilt long have lacked; yet it may be good if thou understandest them, profitable if thou learnest them.
165. For the eighteenth I know that which I never teach to maid or wife of man, (all is better what one only knows. This is the closing of the songs) save her alone who clasps me in her arms, or is my sister.
166. Now are sung the High-one’s songs, in the High-one’s hall, to the sons of men all-useful, but useless to the Jötun’s sons. Hail to him who has sung them!
Hail to him who knows them! May he profit who has learnt them! Hail to hose who have listened to them!

Hymiskviða: The Lay of Hymir
1. Once the celestial gods had been taking fish, and were in compotation, ere they the truth discovered.1 Rods2 they shook, and blood inspected, when they found at Ægir’s a lack of kettles.
2. Sat the rock-dweller glad as a child, much like the son of Miskorblindi. In his eyes looked Ygg’s son steadfastly. “Thou to the Æsir shalt oft a compotation give.”
3. Caused trouble to the Jötun th’ unwelcome-worded Ás: he forthwith meditated vengeance on the gods. Sif ’s husband he besought a kettle him to bring. “in which I beer for all of you may brew.”
4. The illustrious gods found that impossible, nor could the exalted powers it accomplish, till from true-heartedness, Tý to Hlorridi much friendly counsel gave.
1. To wit, that they were short of kettles for brewing.
2. That is divining rods.



88
5. “There dwell eastward of Elivagar the all-wise Hýmir, at heaven’s end. My sire, fierce of mood, a kettle owns, a capacious caldron, a rast in depth.”
Thor 6. “Knowest thou whether we can get the liquor-boiler?”
Tý “Yes, friend! if we stratagem employ.” Rapidly they drove forward that day from Asgard, till to the giant’s home they came.
7. Thor stalled his goats, splendid of horn, then turned him to the hall that Hýmir owned. The son his granddam found to him most loathful; heads she had nine hundred.
8. But another came all-golden forth, fair-browed, bearing the beer-cup to her son:
9. “Ye Jötuns’ kindred! I will you both, ye daring pair, under the kettles place. My husband is oftentimes niggard toward guests, to ill-humour prone.”



89
10. But the monster, the fierce-souled Hýmir, late returned home from the chase. He the hall entered, the icebergs resounded, as the churl approached; the thicket on his cheeks was frozen.
11. “Hail to thee, Hýmir! be of good cheer: now thy son is come to thy hall, whom we expected from his long journey; him accompanies our famed adversary, the friend of man, who Veor hight.
12. “See where they sit under the hall’s gable, as if to shun thee: the pillar stands before them.” In shivers flew the pillar at the Jötun’s glance; the beam was first broken in two.
13. Eight kettles fell, but only one of them, a hard-hammered cauldron, whole from the column. The two came forth, but the old Jötun with eyes surveyed his adversary.



90
14. Augured to him his mind no good, when he saw the giantess’s sorrow on the floor coming. Then were three oxen taken, and the Jötun bade them forthwith be boiled.
15. Each one they made by the head shorter, and to the fire afterwards bore them. Sif ’s consort ate, ere to sleep he went, completely, he alone, two of Hýmir’s beeves.
16. Seemed to the hoary friend of Hrúngnir Hlorridi’s refection full well large: “We three to-morrow night shall be compelled on what we catch to live.”
17. Veor said he would on the sea row, if the bold Jötun him would with baits supply: “To the herd betake thee, (if thou in thy courage trustest, crusher of the rock-dwellers!) for baits to seek.



91
18. I expect that thou wilt bait from an ox easily obtain.” The guest in haste to the forest went, where stood an all-black ox before him.
19. The Thursar’s bane wrung from an ox the high fastness of his two horns. “To me thy work seems worse by far, ruler of keels! than if thou hadst sat quiet.”
20. The lord of goats the apes’ kinsman besought the horse of plank farther out to move; but the Jötun declared his slight desire farther to row.
21. The mighty Hýmir drew, he alone, two whales up with his hook; but at the stern abaft Veor cunningly made him a line.
22. Fixed on the hook the shield of men, the serpent’s slayer, the ox’s head.



92
Gaped at the bait the foe of gods, the encircler beneath of every land.3
23. Drew up boldly the mighty Thor the worm with venom glistening, up to the side; with his hammer struck, on his foul head’s summit, like a rock towering, the wolf ’s own brother.
24. The icebergs resounded, the caverns howled, the old earth shrank together: at length the fish back into the ocean sank.4
25. The Jötun was little glad, as they rowed back, so that the powerful Hýmir nothing spake, but the oar moved in another course.
26. “Wilt thou do half the work with me, either the whales home to the dwelling bear, or the boat fast bind?”
3. The great serpent that encircles the earth.
4. According to the Prose Edda, the giant, overcome with fright, took out his knife and severed Thor’s
line.



93
27. Hlorridi went, grasped the prow, quickly, with its hold-water, lifted the water-steed, together with its oars and scoop; bore to the dwelling the Jötun’s ocean-swine, the curved vessel, through the wooded hills.
28. But the Jötun yet ever frowned, to strife accustomed, with Thor disputed, said that no one was strong, however vigorously he might row, unless he his cup could break.
29. But Hlorridi, when to his hands it came, forthwith brake an upright stone in twain; sitting dashed the cup through the pillars: yet they brought it whole to Hýmir back.
30. Until the beauteous woman gave important, friendly counsel, which she only knew: “Strike at the head of Hýmir, the Jötun with food oppressed, that is harder than any cup.”



94
31. Rose then on his knee the stern lord of goats, clad in all his godlike power. Unhurt remained the old man’s helm-block, but the round wine-bearer was in shivers broken.
32. “Much good, I know, has departed from me, now that my cup I see hurled from my knees.” Thus the old man spake: I can never say again, beer thou art too hot.
33. Now ‘tis to be tried if ye can carry the beer-vessel out of our dwelling.” Tý twice assayed to move the vessel, yet at each time stood the kettle fast.
34. Then Modi’s father by the brim grasped it, and trod through the dwelling’s floor. Sif ’s consort lifted the kettle on his head, while about his heels its rings jingled.
35. They had far journeyed before Odin’s son cast one look backward: he from the caverns saw, with Hýmir from the east, a troop of many-headed monsters coming.



95
36. From his shoulders he lifted the kettle down; Mjöllnir hurled forth towards the savage crew, and slew all the mountain-giants, who with Hýmir had him pursued.
37. Long they had not journeyed when of Hlorridi’s goats one lay down half-dead before the car. It from the pole had sprung across the trace; but the false Loki was of this the cause.
38. Now ye have heard, for what fabulist can more fully tell what indemnity he from the giant got: he paid for it with his children both.5
39. In his strength exulting he to the gods’ counsel came, and had the kettle, which Hýmir had possessed, out of which every god shall beer with Ægir drink at every harvest-tide.
5. This strophe belongs apparently to another poem.

97
ThrymskviÞa eðr Hamarsheimt
The Lay of Thrym, or the Hammer recovered
1. Wroth was Vingthor, when he awoke, and his hammer missed; his beard he shook, his forehead struck, the son of earth felt all around him;
2. and first of all these words he uttered: “Hear now, Loki! what I now say, which no ones knows anywhere on earth, nor in heaven above; the Ás’s hammer is stolen!”
3. They went to the fair Freyja’s dwelling, and he these words first of all said: “Wilt thou me, Freyja, thy feather-garment lend, that perchance my hammer I may find?”
Freyja 4. “That I would give thee, although of gold it were, and trust it to thee, though it were of silver.”



98
5. Flew then Loki the plumage rattled until he came beyond the Æsir’s dwellings, and came within the Jötun’s land.
6. On a mound sat Thrym, the Thursar’s lord, for his greyhounds plaiting gold bands and his horses’ manes smoothing.
7. “How goes it with the Æsir How goes it with the Alfar, Why art thou come alone to Jötunheim?”
Loki 8. “Ill it goes with the Æsir, Ill it goes with the Alfar. Hast thou Hlorridi’s hammer hidden?”
Thrym 9. “I have Hlorridi’s hammer hidden eight rasts beneath the earth; it shall no man get again, unless he bring me Freyja to wife.”



99
10. Flew then Loki the plumage rattled until he came beyond the Jötun’s dwellings, and came within the Æsir’s courts; there he met Thor, in the middle court, who these words first of all uttered.
11. “Hast thou had success as well as labour? Tell me from the air the long tidings. Oft of him who sits are the tales defective, and he who lied down utters falsehood.”
Loki 12. “I have had labour and success: Thrym has thy hammer, the Thursar’s lord. It shall no man get again, unless he bring him Freyja to wife.”
13. They went the fair Freyja to find; and he those words first of all said: “Bind thee, Freyja, in bridal raiment, we two must drive to Jötunheim.”



100
13. Wroth then was Freyja, and with anger chafed, all the Æsir’s hall beneath her trembled: in shivers flew the famed Brisinga necklace. “Know me to be of women lewdest, if with thee I drive to Jötunheim.”
15. Straightway went the Æsir all to counsel, and the Asyniur all to hold converse; and deliberated the mighty gods, how they Hlorridi’s hammer might get back.
16. Then said Heimdall, of Æsir brightest he well foresaw, like other Vanir “Let us clothe Thor with bridal raiment, let him have the famed Brisinga necklace.
17. “Let by his side keys jingle, and woman’s weeds fall round his knees, but on his breast place precious stones, and a neat coif set on his head.”



101
18. Then said Thor, the mighty Ás: “Me the Æsir will call womanish, if I let myself be clad in bridal raiment.”
19. Then spake Loki, Laufey’s son: “Do thou, Thor! refrain from suchlike words: forthwith the Jötuns will Asgard inhabit, unless thy hammer thou gettest back.”
20. Then they clad Thor in bridal raiment, and with the noble Brisinga necklace, let by his side keys jingle, and woman’s weeds fall round his knees: and on his breast places precious stones, and a neat coif sat on his head.
21. Then said Loki, Laufey’s son: “I will with thee as a servant go: we two will drive to Jötunheim.”



102
22. Straightway were the goats homeward driven, hurried to the traces; they had fast to run. The rocks were shivered, the earth was in a blaze; Odin’s son drove to Jötunheim.
23. Then said Thrym, the Thursar’s lord: “Rise up, Jötuns! and the benches deck, now they bring me Freyja to wife, Niörd’s daughter, from Noatún.
24. “Hither to our court let bring gold-horned cows, all-black oxen, for the Jötuns’ joy. Treasures I have many, necklaces many, Freyja alone seemed to me wanting.”
25. In the evening they early came, and for the Jötuns beer was brought forth. Thor alone an ox devoured, salmons eight, and all the sweetmeats women should have. Sif ’s consort drank three salds of mead.



103
26. Then said Thrym, the Thursar’s prince: “Where hast thou seen brides eat more voraciously? I never saw brides feed more amply, nor a maiden drink more mead.”
27. Sat the all-crafty serving-maid close by, who words fitting found against the Jötun’s speech: “Freyja has nothing eaten for eight nights, so eager was she for Jötunheim.”
28. Under her veil he stooped desirous to salute her, but sprang back along the hall. “Why are so piercing Freyja’s looks? Methinks that fire burns from her eyes.”
29. Sat the all-crafty serving-maid close by, who words fitting found against the Jötun’s speech: “Freyja for eight nights has not slept, so eager was she for Jötunheim.”



104
30. In came the Jötun’s luckless sister, for a bride-gift she dared to ask: “Give me from thy hands the ruddy rings, if thou wouldst gain my love, my love and favour all.”
31. Then said Thrym, the Thursar’s lord: “Bring the hammer in, the bride to consecrate; lay Mjöllnir on the maiden’s knee; unite us each with other by the hand of Vör.
32. Laughed Hlorridi’s soul in his breast, when the fierce-hearted his hammer recognized. He first slew Thrym, the Thursar’s lord, and the Jötun’s race all crushed;
33. He slew the Jötun’s aged sister, her who a bride-gift had demanded; she a blow got instead of skillings, a hammer’s stroke for many rings. So got Odin’s son his hammer back.



105
Alvíssmál: The Lay of the Dwarf Alvis
Alvis 1. The benches they are decking, now shall the bride1 with me bend her way home. That beyond my strength I have hurried will to every one appear: at home naught shall disturb my quiet.
Vingthor 2. What man is this? Why about the nose art thou so pale? Hast thou last night with corpses lain? To me thou seemst to bear resemblances to the Thursar. Thou art not born to carry off a bride.
Alvis 3. Alvis I am named, beneath the earth I dwell, under the rock I own a place. The lord of chariots I am come to visit. A promise once confirmed let no one break.2
Vingthor 4. I will break it; for o’er the maid I have, as father, greatest power. I was from home when the promise was given thee. Among the gods I the sole giver am.
Alvis 5. What man is this, lays claim to power over that fair, bright maiden? For far-reaching shafts
1. Thrud, Thor’s daughter by his wife Sif. Skaldskap.
2. This appears to allude to a promise made to the dwarf; but of which the story is lost.



106
few will know thee. Who has decked thee with bracelets?
Vingthor 6. Vingthor I am named, wide I have wandered; I am Sidgrani’s son: with my dissent thou shalt not that young maiden have, nor that union obtain.
Alvis 7. Thy consent I fain would obtain. Rather would I possess than be without that snow-white maiden.
Vingthor 8. The maiden’s love shall not, wise guest! be unto thee denied, if thou of every world canst tell all I desire to know.
Alvis 9. Vingthor! thou canst try, as thou art desirous the knowledge of the dwarf to prove. All the nine worlds I have travelled over, and every being known.
Vingthor 10. Tell me, Alvis! for all men’s concerns I presume thee, dwarf, to know how the earth is called, which lies before the sons of men, in every world.



107
Alvis 11. Jörd among men “tis called, but with the Æsir fold; the Vanir call it vega, the Jötuns igroen, the Alfar groandi, the powers supreme aur.
Vingthor 12. Tell me Alvis! etc. how the heaven is called, which is perceptible, in every world.
Alvis 13. Himinn tis called by men; but hlýrnir with the gods; vindofni the Vanir call it, uppheimr the Jötuns, the Alfar fagraræfr, the dwarfs driupansal.
Vingthor 14. Tell me Alvis! etc. how the moon is called, which men see in every world.
Alvis 15. Mani ‘tis called by men, but mylinn with the gods, hverfanda hvel in Hel they call it, skyndi the Jötuns, but the dwarfs skin; the Alfar name it artali.
Vingthor 16. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the sun is called, which men’s sons see in every world.



108
Alvis 17. Sol among men ‘tis called, but with the gods sunna, the dwarfs call it Dvalinn’s leika, the Jötuns eyglo, the Alfar fagrahvel, the Æsir’s sons alskir.
Vingthor 18. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the clouds are called, which with showers are mingled in every world.
Alvis 19. Sky they are called by men, but skurvan by the gods; the Vanir call them vindflot, the Jötuns urvan, the Alfar veðrmegin; in Hel they are called hialm huliðs.
Vingthor 20. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the wind is called, which widely passes over every world.
Alvis 21. Windr ‘tis called by men, but vavuðr by the gods, the wide-ruling powers call it gneggiuð, the Jötuns æpir the Alfar dynfari, in Hel they call it hviðuðr.
Vingthor 22. Tell me Alvis! etc. how the calm is called, which has to rest in every world.



109
Alvis 23. Logn ‘tis called by men, but lægi by the gods, the Vanir call it vindslot, the Jötuns ofhlý, the Alfar dagsevi, the Dwarfs call it dags vera.
Vingthor 24. Tell me, Alvis! etc. what the sea is called, which men row over in every world.
Alvis 25. Sær ‘tis called by men, but silægia with the gods; the Vanir call it vagr, the Jötuns alheimr, the Alfar lagastafr, the Dwarfs call it diupan mar.
Vingthor 26. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the fire is called, which burns before men’s sons in every world.
Alvis 27. Eldr ‘tis called by men, but by the Æsir funi; the Vanir call it vagr, the Jötuns frekr, but the Dwarfs forbrennir; in Hel they call it hröðuðr.
Vingthor 28. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the forest it called, which grows for the sons of men in every world.



110
Alvis 29. Viðr ‘tis called by men, but vallarfax by gods, Hel’s inmates call it hliðÞangr, the Jötuns eldi, the Alfar fagrlimi; the Vanir call it vöndr.
Vingthor 30. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the night is called, that Nörvi’s daughter hight, in every world.
Alvis 31. Nott it is called by men, but by the gods niol; the wide-ruling powers call it grima, the Jötuns olios, the Alfar svefngaman; the Dwarfs call it draumniörunn.
Vingthor 32. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the seed is called, which the sons of men sow in every world.
Alvis 33. Bygg it is called by men, but by the gods barr, the Vanir call it vaxtr, the Jötuns æti, the Alfar lagastafr; in Hel ‘tis hnipinn called.
Vingthor 34. Tell me, Alvis! etc. how the beer is called, which the sons of men drink in every world.



111
Alvis 35. Öl it is called by men, but by the Æsir biorr, the Vanir call it veig, hreinna lögr the Jötuns, but in Hel ‘tis called miöðr: Suttung’s sons call it sumbl.
Vingthor 36. In one breast I have never found more ancient lore. By great wiles thou hast, I tell thee, been deluded. Thou art above ground, dwarf! at dawn; already in the hall the sun is shining!

113
Harbarðslióð: The Lay of Harbard
Thor journeying from the eastern parts came to a strait or sound, on the other side of which was a ferryman with his boat. Thor cried out:
1. Who is the knave of knaves, that by the sound stands yonder?
Harbard 2. Who is the churl of churls, that cries across the water?
Thor 3. Ferry me across the sound, to-morrow I’ll regale thee. I have a basket on my back: there is no better food: at my ease I ate, before I quitted home, herrings and oats, with which I yet feel sated.
Harbard 4. Thou art in haste to praise thy meal: thou surely hast no foreknowledge; for sad will be thy home: thy mother, I believe, is dead.
Thor 5. Thou sayest now what seems to every one most unwelcome to know that my mother is dead.
Harbard 6. Thou dost not look like one who owns three country dwellings, bare-legged thou standest, and like a beggar clothed; thou hast not even breeches.



114
Thor 7. Steer hitherward thy boat; I will direct thee where to land. But who owns this skiff, which by the strand thou holdest?
Harbard 8. Hildolf he is named who bade me hold it, a man in council wise, who dwells in Radsö sound. Robbers he bade me not to ferry, or horse-stealers, but good men only, and those whom I well knew. Tell me then they name, if thou wilt cross the sound.
Thor 9. I my name will tell, (although I am an outlaw) and all my kin: I am Odin’s son, Meili’s brother, and Magni’s sire, the gods’ mighty leader: With Thor thou here mayst speak. I will now ask how thou art called.
10. I am Harbard called; seldom I my name conceal.
Thor 11. Why shouldst thou thy name conceal, unless thou crime has perpetrated?
Harbard 12. Yet, thou I may crime have perpetrated, I will nathless guard my life against such as thou art; unless I death-doomed am.



115
Thor 13. It seems to me a foul annoyance to wade across the strait to thee, and wet my garments: but I will pay thee, mannikin! for thy sharp speeches, if o’er the sound I come.
Harbard 14. Here will I stand, and here await thee. Thou wilt have found no stouter one since Hrugnir’s death.
Thor 15. Thou now remindest me how I with Hrugnir fought, that stout-hearted Jötun, whose head was all of stone; yet I made him fall, and sink before me. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?
Harbard 16. I was with Fjölvari five winters through, in the isle which Algrön hight. There we could fight, and slaughter make, many perils prove, indulge in love.
Thor 17. How did your women prove towards you?



116
Harbard 18. Sprightly women we had, had they but been meek; shrewd ones we had, had they but been kind. Of sand a rope they twisted, and from the deep valley dug the earth: to them all I alone was superior in cunning. I rested with the sisters seven, and their love and pleasures shared. What meanwhile didst thou, Thor?
Thor 19. I slew Thiassi, that stout-hearted Jötun: up I cast the eyes of Allvaldi’s son into the heaven serene: they are signs the greatest of my deeds. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?
Harbard 20. Great seductive arts I used against the riders of the night,1 when from their husbands I enticed them. A mighty Jötun I believed Hlebard to be: a magic wand he gave me, but from his wits I charmed him.
Thor 21. With evil mind then thou didst good gifts requite.
1. Giantesses, witches, etc.



117
Harbard 22. One tree gets that which is from another scraped: each one in such case is for self. What meanwhile didst thou, Thor?
Thor 23. In the east I was, and slew the Jötun brides, crafty in evil, as they to the mountain went. Great would have been the Jötun race, had they all lived; and not a man left in Midgard. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?
Harbard 24. I was in Valland, and followed warfare; princes I excited, but never reconciled. Odin has all the jarls that in conflict fall; but Thor the race of thralls.
Thor 25. Unequally thou wouldst divide the folk among the Æsir, if thou but hadst the power.
Harbard 26. Thor has strength overmuch, but courage none; from cowardice and fear, thou wast crammed into a glove, and hardly thoughtest thou was Thor. Thou durst not then, through thy terror, either sneeze or cough, lest Fjalar it might hear.



118
Thor 27. Harbard, thou wretch! I would strike thee dead, could I but stretch my arm across the sound.
Harbard 28. Why wouldst thou stretch they arm across the sound, when there is altogether no offence? But what didst thou, Thor?
Thor 29. In the east I was, and a river I defended, when the sons of Svarang me assailed, and with stones pelted me, though in their success they little joyed: they were the first to sue for peace. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?
Harbard 30. I was in the east, and with a certain lass held converse; with that fair I dallied, and long meetings had. I that gold-bright one delighted; the game amused her.
Thor 31. Then you had kind damsels there?
Harbard 32. Of thy aid I had need, Thor! in retaining that maiden lily-fair.
Thor 33. I would have given it thee, if I had had the opportunity.



119
Harbard 34. I would have trusted thee, my confidence if thou hadst not betrayed it.
Thor 35. I am not such a heel-chafer as an old leather shoe in spring.
Harbard 36. What meanwhile didst thou, Thor?
Thor 37. The Berserkers’ brides I on Læssö cudgeled; they the worst had perpetrated, the whole people had seduced.
Harbard 38. Dastardly didst thou act, Thor! when thou didst cudgel women.
Thor 39. She-wolves they were, and scarcely women. They crushed my ship, which with props I had secured, with iron clubs threatened me, and drove away Thialfi. What meanwhile didst thou, Harbard?
Harbard 40. I in the army was, which was hither sent, war-banners to raise, lances to redden.
Thor 41. Of that thou now wilt speak, as thou wentest forth us hard terms to offer.



120
Harbard 42. That shall be indemnified by a hand-ring, such as arbitrators give, who wish to reconcile us.
Thor 43. Where didst thou learn words than which I never heard more irritating?
Harbard 44. From men I learned them, from ancient men, whose home is in the woods.
Thor 45. Thou givest certainly a good name to grave-mounds, when thou callest them homes in the woods.
Harbard 46. So speak I of such a subject.
Thor 47. Thy shrewd words will bring thee evil, if I resolve the sound to ford. Louder than a wolf thou wilt howl, I trow, if of my hammer thou gettest a touch.
Harbard 48. Sif has a gallant at home; thou wilt anxious be to find him: thou shalt that arduous work perform; it will beseem thee better.



121
Thor 49. Thou utterest what comes upmost, so that to me it be most annoying, thou dastardly varlet! I believe thou art lying.
Harbard 50. I believe I am telling truth. Thou art travelling slowly; thou wouldst have long since arrived, hadst thou assumed another form.
Thor 51. Harbard! thou wretch! rather is it thou who has detained me.
Harbard 52. I never thought that a ferryman could the course of Asa-Thor retard.
Thor 53. One advice I now will give thee: row hither with thy boat; let us cease from threats; approach the sire of Magni.
Harbard 54. Go farther from the sound, the passage is refused thee.
Thor 55. Show me then the way, if thou wilt not ferry me across the water.



122
Harbard 56. That’s too little to refuse. “Tis far to go; “tis to the stock an hour, and to the stone another; then keep the left hand way, until thou reachest Verland; there will Fjörgyn find her son Thor, and point out to him his kinsmen’s ways to Odin’s land.
Thor 57. Can I get there to-day?
Harbard 58. With pain and toil thou mayest get there, while the sun is up, which, I believe, is now nigh.
Thor 59. Our talk shall now be short, as thou answerest with scoffing only. For refusing to ferry me I will reward thee, if another time we meet.
Harbard 60. Just go to where all the powers of evil may have thee.



123
För Skirnis eðr Skirnismál
The Journey or Lay of Skirnir
Frey, son of Niörd, had one day seated himself in Hlidskjalf, and was looking over all regions, when turning his eyes to Jötunheim, he there saw a beautiful girl, as she was passing from her father’s dwelling to her bower. Thereupon he became greatly troubled in mind. Frey’s attendant was named Skirnir; him Niörd desired to speak with Frey; when Skadi said:
1. Rise up now, Skirnir! go and request our son to speak; and inquire with whom he so sage may be offended.
Skirnir 2. Harsh words I have from your son to fear, if I go and speak with him, and to inquire with whom he so sage may be offended.
Skirnir 3. Tell me now, Frey, prince of gods! for I desire to know, why alone thou sittest in the spacious hall the livelong day?
Frey 4. Why shall I tell thee, thou young man, my mind’s great trouble? for the Alfs’ illuminator shines every day, yet not for my pleasure.



124
Skirnir 5. Thy care cannot, I think, be so great, that to me thou canst not tell it; for in early days we were young together: well might we trust each other.
Frey 6. In Gýmir’s courts I saw walking a maid for whom I long. Her arms gave forth light wherewith shone all air and water.
7. Is more desirable to me that maid than to any youth in early days; yet will no one, Æsir or Alfar, that we together live.
Skirnir 8. Give me but thy steed, which can bear me through the dusk, flickering flame, and that sword, which brandishes itself against the Jötuns’ race.
Frey 9. I will give thee my steed, which can bear thee through the dusk, flickering flame, and that sword, which will itself brandish, if he is bold who raises it.



125
Skirnir speaks to the horse....
10. Dark it is without, ‘tis time, I say, for us to go across the misty fells, over the Thursar’s land: we shall both return, or the all-potent Jötun will seize us both.
Skirnir rides to Jötunheim, to Gýmir’s mansion, where fierce dogs were chained at the gate of the enclosure that was round Gýmir’s hall. He rides on to where a cowherd was sitting on a mound, and says to him:
11. Tell me, cowherd! as on the mound thou sittest, and watchest all the ways, how I to the speech may come, of the young maiden, for Gýmir’s dogs?
12. Either thou art death-doomed, or thou art a departed one. Speech wilt thou ever lack with the good maid of Gýmir.
Skirnir 13. Better choices than to whine there are for him who is prepared to die: for one day was my age decreed, and my whole life determined.
Gerd 14. What is that sound of sounds, which I now sounding hear within our dwelling? The earth is shaken, and with it all the house of Gýmir trembles.



126
A serving-maid. 15. A man is here without, dismounted from his horse’s back: he lets his steed browse on the grass.
Gerd 16. Bid him enter into our hall, and drink of the bright mead; although I fear it is my brother’s slayer who waits without.
17. Who is this of the Alfar’s, or of the Æsir’s sons, or of the wise Vanir’s? Why art thou come alone, through the hostile fire, our halls to visit?
Skirnir 18. I am not of the Alfar’s, nor of the Æsir’s sons, nor of the wise Vanir’s; yet I am come alone, through the hostile fire, your halls to visit.
19. Apples all-golden I have here eleven: these I will give thee, Gerd, thy love to gain, that thou mayest say that Frey to thee lives dearest.
Gerd 20. The apples eleven I never will accept for any mortal’s pleasure; nor will I and Frey, while our lives last, live both together.



127
Skirnir 21. The ring too I will give thee, which was burnt with the young son of Odin. Eight of equal weight will from it drop, every ninth night.
Gerd 22. The ring I will not accept, burnt thou it may have been with the young son of Odin. I have no lack of gold in Gýmir’s courts; for my father’s wealth I share.
Skirnir 23. Seest thou this sword, young maiden! thin, glittering-bright, which I have here in hand? I thy head will sever from thy neck, if thou speakest not favourably to me.
Gerd 24. Suffer compulsion will I never, to please any man; yet this I foresee, if thou and Gýmir meet, yet will eagerly engage in fight.
Skirnir 25. Seest thou this sword, young maiden! thin, glittering-bright, which I have here in hand? Beneath its edge shall the old Jötun fall: thy sire is death-doomed.



128
26. With a taming-wand I smite thee, and I will tame thee, maiden! to my will. Thou shalt go thither, where the sons of men shall never more behold thee.
27. On an eagle’s mount thou shalt early sit, looking and turned towards Hel. Food shall to thee more loathsome be than is to any one the glistening serpent among men.
28. As a prodigy thou shalt be, when thou goest forth; Hrimnir shall at thee gaze, all being at thee stare; more wide-known thou shalt become than the watch among the gods,1 if thou from thy gratings gape.
29. Solitude and disgust, bonds and impatience, shall thy tears with grief augment. Set thee down, and I will tell thee of a whelming flood of care, and a double grief.
30. Terrors shall bow thee down the livelong day, in the Jötuns’ courts. To the Hrimthursar’s halls, thou shalt each day crawl exhausted, joyless crawl; wail for pastime shalt thou have, and tears and misery.
1. Heimdall.



129
31. With a three-headed Thurs thou shalt be ever bound, or be without a mate. Thy mind shall tear thee from morn to morn: as the thistle thou shalt be which has thrust itself on the house-top.
32. To the wold I have been, and to the humid grove, a magic wand to get. A magic wand I got.
33. Wroth with thee is Odin, wroth with thee is the Æsir’s prince; Frey shall loathe thee, even ere thou, wicked maid! shalt have felt the gods’ dire vengeance.
34. Hear ye, Jötuns! hear ye, Hrimthursar! sons of Suttung! also ye, Æsir’s friends! how I forbid how I prohibit man’s joy unto the damsel, man’s converse to the damsel.
35. Hrimgrimnir the Thurs is named, that shall possess thee, in the grating of the dead beneath; there shall wretched thralls, from the tree’s roots, goats’ water give thee. Other drink shalt thou, maiden! never get, either for thy pleasure, or for my pleasure.



130
36. Þurs2 I cut for thee, and three letters more: ergi, and oenði, and oÞola. So will I cut them out, as I have cut them in, if there need shall be.
Gerd 37. Hail rather to thee, youth! and accept an icy cup, filled with old mead; although I thought not that I ever should love one of Vanir race.
Skirnir 38. All my errand will I know, ere I hence ride home. When wilt thou converse hold with the powerful son of Niörd?
Gerd 39. Barri the grove is named, which we both know, the grove of tranquil paths. Nine nights hence, there to Niörd’s son Gerd will grant delight.
Skirnir then rode home. Frey was standing without, and spoke to him, asking tidings:
40. Tell me, Skirnir! ere thou thy steed unsaddlest, and a foot hence goest, what thou hast accomplished in Jötunheim, for my pleasure or thine?
2. Thurs, etc., the names of magical runes.



131
Skirnir 41. Barri the grove is named, which we both know, the grove of tranquil paths. Nine nights hence, there to Niörd’s son Gerd will grant delight.
Frey 42. Long is one night, yet longer two will be; how shall I three endure. Often a month to me less has seemed than half a night of longing.

Rígsmál: The Lay of Rig
In ancient Sagas it is related that one of the Æsir named Heimdall, being on a journey to a certain sea-shore, came to a village, where he called himself Rig. In accordance with this Saga is the following:
1. In ancient days, they say, along the green ways went the powerful and upright sagacious Ás, the strong and active Rig, his onward course pursuing.
2. Forward he went on the mid-way, and to a dwelling came. The door stood ajar, he went in, fire was on the floor. There man and wife sat there, hoary-haired, by the hearth, Ai and Edda, in old guise clad.
3. Rig would counsel give to them both, and himself seated in the middle seat, having on either side the domestic pair.
4. Then Edda from the ashes took a loaf, heavy and thick, and with bran mixed; more besides she laid on the middle of the board; there in a bowl was broth on the table set, there was a calf boiled, of cates more excellent.



134
5. Then rose he up, prepared to sleep: Rig would counsel give to them both; laid him down in the middle of the bed; the domestic pair lay one on either side.
6. There he continued three nights together, then departed on the mid-way. Nine months then passed away.
7. Edda a child brought forth: they with water sprinkled its swarthy skin, and named it Thræl.
8. It grew up, and well it throve; of its hands the skin was shriveled, the knuckles knotty, *************************** and fingers thick; a hideous countenance it had, a curved back, and protruding heels.
9. He then began his strength to prove, bast to bind, make of it loads; then faggots carried home, the livelong day.



135
10. Then to the dwelling came a woman walking, scarred were her foot-soles, her arms sunburnt, her nose compressed, her name was Thý.
11. In the middle seat herself she placed; by her sat the house’s son. They spoke and whispered, prepared a bed, Thræl and Thý, and days of care.
12. Children they begat, and lived content: Their names, I think, were Hrimr and Fjósnir, Klur and Kleggi, Kefsir, Fulnir, Drumb, Digraldi, Drött and Hösvir, Lút and Leggialdi. Fences they erected, fields manured, tended swine, kept goats, dug turf.
13. The daughters were Drumba and Kumba, Ökkvinkalfa, and Arinnefia, Ysia and Ambatt, Eikintiasna, Tötrughypia, and Trönubeina, whence are sprung the race of thralls. *************************



136
14. Rig then went on, in a direct course, and came to a house; the door stood ajar: he went in; fire was on the floor, man and wife sat there engaged at work.
15. The man was planing wood for a weaver’s beam; his beard was trimmed, a lock was on his forehead, his shirt close; he chest stood on the floor.
16. His wife sat by, plied her rock, with outstretched arms, prepared for clothing. A hood was on her head, a loose sark over her breast, a kerchief round her neck, studs on her shoulders. Afi and Amma owned the house.
17. Rig would counsel give to them both; rose from the table, prepared to sleep; laid him down in the middle of the bed, the domestic pair lay one on either side.



137
18. There he continued three nights together. Nine months then passed away. Amma a child brought forth, they with water sprinkled it, and called it Karl. The mother in linen swathed the ruddy redhead: its eyes twinkled.
19. It grew up, and well throve; learned to tame oxen, make a plough, houses build, and barns construct, make carts, and the plough drive.
20. Then they home conveyed a lass with pendant keys, and goatskin kirtle; married her to Karl. Snör was her name, under a veil she sat. The couple dwelt together, rings exchanged, spread couches, and a household formed.
21. Children they begat, and lived content. Hal and Dreng, these were named, Held, Thegn, Smith, Breidrbondi, Bundinskegg, Bui and Boddi, Brattskegg and Segg.



138
22. But (the daughters) were thus called, by other names: Snot, Brud, Svanni, Svarri, Sprakki, Fliod, Sprund, and Vif, Feima, Ristil; whence are sprung the races of churls. ******************************
23. Rig then went thence, in a direct course, and came to a hall: the entrance looked southward, the door was half closed, a ring was on the door-post.
24. He went in; the floor was strewed, a couple sat facing each other, Fadir and Modir, with fingers playing.
25. The husband sat, and twisted string, bent his bow, and arrow-shafts prepared; but the housewife looked on her arms, smoothed her veil, and her sleeves fastened;
26. Her head-gear adjusted. A clasp was on her breast; ample her robe, her sark was blue; brighter was her brow, her breast fairer, her neck whiter than driven snow.



139
27. Rig would counsel give to them both, and himself seated on the middle seat, having on either side the domestic pair.
28. Then took Modir a figured cloth of white linen, and the table decked. She then took thin cakes of snow-white wheat, and on the table laid.
29. She set forth salvers full, adorned with silver, on the table game and pork, and roasted birds. In a can was wine; the cups were ornamented. They drank and talked; the day was fast departing, Rig would counsel give to them both.
30. Rig then rose, the bed prepared; there he then remained three nights together, then departed on the mid-way. Nine months after that passed away.



140
31. Modir then brought forth a boy; in silk they wrapped him, with water sprinkled him, and named him Jarl. Light was his hair, bright his cheeks, his eyes piercing as a young serpent’s.
32. There at home Jarl grew up, learned the shield to shake, to fix the string, the bow to bend, arrows to shaft, javelins to hurl, spears to brandish, horses to ride, dogs to let slip, swords to draw, swimming to practice.
33. Thither from the forest came Rig walking, Rig walking: runes he taught him, and his own son declared him, whom he bade possess his alodial fields, his alodial fields, his ancient dwellings.



141
34. Jarl then rode thence, through a murky way, over humid fells, till to a hall he came. His spear he brandished, his shield he shook, made his horse curvet, and his falchion drew, strife began to raise, the field to redden, carnage to make; and conquer lands.
35. Then he ruled alone over eight vills, riches distributed, gave to all treasures and precious things; lank-sided horses, rings he dispersed, and collars cut in pieces.1
36. The nobles drove through humid ways, came to a hall, where Hersir dwelt; there they found a slender maiden, fair and elegant, Erna her name.
37. They demanded her, and conveyed her home, to Jarl espoused her; she under the linen2 went. They together lived, and well throve, had offspring, and old age enjoyed.
1. A common practice: the pieces served as money.
2. The nuptial veil.



142
38. Bur was the eldest, Barn the second, Jod and Adal, Arfi, Mög, Nid and Nidjung. They learned games; Son and Svein swam and at tables played. One was named Kund, Kon was the youngest.
39. There grew up Jarl’s progeny; horses they broke, curved shields, cut arrows, brandished spears.
40. But the young Kon understood runes, æfin-runes, and aldr-runes; he moreover knew men to preserve, edges to deaden, the sea to calm.
41. He knew the voice of birds, how fires to mitigate, assuage and quench; sorrows to allay. He of eight men had the strength and energy.
42. He with Rig Jarl in runes contended, artifices practiced, and superior proved; then acquired Rig to be called, and skilled in runes.



143
43. The young Kon rode through swamps and forests, hurled forth darts, and tamed birds.
44. Then sang the crow, sitting lonely on a bough! “Why wilt thou, young Kon: tame the birds? Rather shouldst thou, young Kon! on horses ride ************************* ************************* and armies overcome.
45. Nor Dan nor Danp halls more costly had, nobler paternal seats, then ye had. They well knew how the keel to ride, the edge to prove, wounds to inflict.
(The rest is wanting......)

Ægisdrekka, eða Lokasenna, eða Lokaglepsa
Ægir’s Compotation or Loki’s Altercation
Ægir, who is also name Gýmir, had brewed beer for the Æsir, after he had got the great kettle, as has been already related. To the entertainment came Odin and his wife Frigg. Thor did not come, being in the East, but his wife Sif was there, also Bragi and his wife Idun, and Tý, who was one-handed, Fenrisulf having bitten off his hand while being bound. Besides these were Niörd and his wife Skadi, Frey and Freyja, and Odin’s son Vidar. Loki too was there, and Frey’s attendants, Byggvir and Beyla. Many other Æsir and Alfar were also present. Ægir had two servants, Fimafeng and Eldir. Bright gold was there used instead of fire-light. The beer served itself to the guests. The place was a great sanctuary. The guests greatly praised the excellence of Ægir’s servants. This Loki could not hear with patience, and so slew Fimafeng; whereupon the Æsir shook their shields, exclaimed against Loki, chased him into the forest, and then returned to drink. Loki came again, and found Eldir standing without, whom he thus addressed:
1. Tell me, Eldir! ere thou thy foot settest one step forward, on what converse the sons of the triumphant gods at their potation?
Eldir 2. Of their arms converse, and of their martial fame, the sons of the triumphant gods. Of the Æsir and the Alfar that are here within not one has a friendly word for thee.
Loki 3. I will go into Ægir’s halls, to see the compotation. Strife and hate to the Æsir’s sons I bear, and will mix their mead with bale.



146
Eldir 4. Knowest thou not that if thou goest into Ægir’s halls to see the compotation, but contumely and clamor pourest forth on the kindly powers, they will wipe it all off on thee.
Loki 5. Knowest thou not, Eldir, that if we two with bitter words contend, I shall be rich in answers, if thou sayest too much?
Loki then went into the hall, but when those present saw who was come in, they all sat silent.
Loki 6. I Lopt am come thirsty into this hall, from a long journey, to beseech the Æsir one draught to give me of the bright mead.
7. Why gods! are ye so silent, so reserved, that ye cannot speak? A seat and place choose for me at your board, or bid me hie me hence.
Bragi 8. A seat and place will the Æsir never choose for thee at their board; for well the Æsir know for whom they ought to hold a joyous compotation.



147
Loki 9. Odin! dost thou remember when we in early days blended our blood together? When to taste beer thou didst constantly refuse, unless to both ‘twas offered?
Odin 10. Rise up, Vidar! and let the wolf ’s sire sit at our compotation; that Loki may not utter words of contumely in Ægir’s hall.
Vidar then rising, presented Loki with drink, who before drinking thus addressed.
11. Hail, Æsir! Hail, Asyniur! And ye, all-holy gods! all, save that one As, who sits within there, Bragi, on yonder bench.
Bragi 12. A horse and falchion I from my stores will give thee, and also with a ring reward thee, if thou the Æsir wilt not requite with malice. Provoke not the gods against thee.
Loki 13. Of horse and rings wilt thou ever, Bragi! be in want. Of the Æsir and the Alfar, that are here present, in conflict thou art the most backward, and in the play of darts most timid.



148
Bragi 14. I know that were I without, as I am now within, the hall of Ægir, I thy head would bear in my hand, and so for lying punish thee.
Loki 15. Valiant on thy seat art thou, Bragi! but so thou shouldst not be, Bragi, the bench’s pride! Go and fight, if thou art angry; a brave man sits not considering.
Idun 16. I pray thee, Bragi! let avail the bond of children, and of all adopted sons, and to Loki speak not in reproachful words, in Ægir’s hall.
Loki 17. Be silent, Idun! of all women I declare thee most fond of men, since thou thy arms, carefully washed, didst twine round thy brother’s murderer.
Idun 18. Loki I address not with opprobrious words, in Ægir’s hall. Bragi I soothe, by beer excited. I desire not that angry ye fight.



149
Gefion 19. Why will ye, Æsir twain, here within, strive with reproachful words? Lopt perceives not that he is deluded, and is urged on by fate.
Loki 20. Be silent, Gefion! I will now just mention, how that fair youth thy mind corrupted, who thee a necklace gave, and around whom thou thy limbs didst twine?
Odin 21. Thou art raving, Loki! and hast lost thy wits, in calling Gefion’s anger on thee; for all men’s destinies, I ween, she knows as thoroughly as I do.
Loki 22. Be silent, Odin! Thou never couldst allot conflicts between men: oft hast thou given to those to whom thou oughtest not victory to cowards.
Odin 23. Knowest thou that I gave to those I ought not victory to cowards? Thou was eight winters on the earth below, a milch cow and a woman, and didst there bear children. Now that, methinks, betokens a base nature.



150
Loki 24. But, it is said, thou wentest with tottering steps in Samsö, and knocked at houses as a Vala. In likeness of a fortune teller, thou wentest among people; Now that, methinks, betokens a base nature.
Frigg 25. Your doings ye should never publish among men, what ye, Æsir twain, did in days of yore. Ever forgotten be men’s former deeds!
Loki 26. Be thou silent, Frigg! Thou art Fjörgyn’s daughter, and ever hast been fond of men, since Ve and Vili, it is said, thou, Vidrir’s wife, didst both to thy bosom take.
Frigg 27. Know thou that if I had, in Ægir’s halls, a son like Baldr, out thou shouldst not go from the Æsir’s sons: thou should’st have been fiercely assailed.
Loki 28. But wilt thou, Frigg! that of my wickedness I more recount? I am the cause that thou seest not Baldr riding to the halls.



151
Freyja 29. Mad art thou, Loki! in recounting thy foul misdeeds. Frigg, I believe, knows all that happens, although she says it not.
Loki 30. Be thou silent, Freyja! I know thee full well; thou art not free from vices: of the Æsir and the Alfar, that are herein, each has been thy paramour.
Freyja 31. False is thy tongue. Henceforth it will, I think, prate no good to thee. Wroth with thee are the Æsir, and the Asyniur. Sad shalt thou home depart.
Loki 32. Be silent, Freyja! Thou art a sorceress, and with much evil blended; since against thy brother thou the gentle powers excited. And then, Freyja! what didst thou do?
Niörd 33. It is no great wonder, if silk-clad dames get themselves husbands, lovers; but ‘tis a wonder that a wretched Ás, that has borne children, should herein enter.



152
Loki 34. Be silent, Niörd! Thou wast sent eastward hence, a hostage from the gods. Hýmir’s daughter had thee for a utensil, and flowed into thy mouth.1
Niörd 35. ‘Tis to me a solace, as I a long way hence was sent, a hostage from the gods, that I had a son, whom no one hates, and accounted is a chief among the Æsir.
Loki 36. Cease now, Niörd! in bounds contain thyself; I will no longer keep it secret: it was with thy sister thou hadst such a son; hardly worse than thyself.
Tý 37. Frey is best of all the exalted gods in the Æsir’s courts: no maid he makes to weep, no wife of man, and from bonds looses all.
Loki 38. Be silent, Tý! Thou couldst never settle a strife ‘twixt two; of thy right hand also I must mention make, which Fenrir from thee tore.
1. The events related in this strophe are probably a mere perversion, by the poet, of what we know of Niord’s
history.



153
Tý 39. I of a hand am wanting, but thou of honest fame; sad is the lack of either. Nor is the wolf at ease: he in bonds must bide, until the gods’ destruction.
Loki 40. Be silent, Tý; to thy wife it happened to have a son by me. Nor rag nor penny ever hadst thou, poor wretch! for this injury.
Frey 41. I the wolf see lying at the river’s mouth, until the powers are swept away. So shalt thou be bound, if thou art not silent, thou framer of evil.
Loki 42. With gold thou boughtest Gýmir’s daughter, and so gavest away thy sword: but when Muspell’s sons through the dark forest ride, thou, unhappy, wilt not have wherewith to fight.
Byggvir 43. Know that were I of noble race, like Ingun’s Frey, and had so fair a dwelling, than marrow softer I would bray that ill-boding crow, and crush him limb by limb.



154
Loki 44. What little thing is that I see wagging its tail, and snapping eagerly? At the ears of Frey thou shouldst ever be, and clatter under mills.
Byggvir 45. Byggvir I am named, and am thought alert, by all gods and men; therefore am I joyful here, that all the sons of Hropt drink beer together.
Loki 46. Be silent, Byggvir! Thou couldst never dole out food to men, when, lying in thy truckle bed, thou wast not to be found, while men were fighting.
Heimdall 47. Loki, thou art drunk, and hast lost thy wits. Why dost thou not leave off, Loki? But drunkenness so rules every man, that he knows not of his garrulity.
Loki 48. Be silent, Heimdall! For thee in early days was that hateful life decreed: with a wet back thou must ever be, and keep watch as guardian of the gods.



155
Skadi 49. Thou art merry, Loki! Not long wilt thou frisk with an unbound tail; for thee, on a rock’s point, with the entrails of thy ice-cold son, the gods will bind.
Loki 50. Know, if on a rock’s point, with the entrails of my ice-cold son, the gods will bind me, that first and foremost I was at the slaying, when we assailed Thiassi.
Skadi 51. Know, if first and foremost thou wast at the slaying, when ye assailed Thiassi, that from my dwellings and fields shall to thee ever cold counsels come.
Loki 52. Milder was thou of speech to Laufey’s son, when to thy bed thou didst invite me. Such matters must be mentioned, if we accurately must recount our vices.
Then Sif came forth, and poured out mead for Loki in an icy cup, saying:
53. Hail to thee, Loki! and this cool cup receive, full of old mead: at least me alone, among the blameless Æsir race, leave stainless.



156
He took the horn, drank, and said:
54. So alone shouldst thou be, hadst thou strict and prudent been towards thy mate; but one I know, and, I think, know him well, a favoured rival of Hlorridi, and that is the wily Loki.
Beyla 55. The fells all tremble: I think Hlorridi is from journeying home. He will bid be quiet him who here insults all gods and men.
Loki 56. Be silent, Beyla! Thou art Byggvir’s wife, and with much evil mingled: never came a greater monster among the Æsir’s sons. Thou art a dirty strumpet.
Thor then came in and said:
57. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Mjöllnir, shall stop thy prating. I will thy head from thy neck strike; then will thy life be ended.
Loki 58. Now the son of earth is hither come. Why dost thou chafe so, Thor? Thou wilt not dare do so, when with the wolf thou hast to fight, and he the all-powerful father swallows whole.



157
Thor 59. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Mjöllnir, shall stop thy prating. Up I will hurl thee to the east region, and none shall see thee after.
Loki 60. Of thy eastern travels thou shouldst never to people speak, since in a glove-thumb thou, Einheri! wast doubled up, and hardly thoughtest thou was Thor.
Thor 61. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Mjöllnir, shall stop thy prating; with this right hand I, Hrugnir’s bane, will smite thee, so that thy every bone be broken.
Loki 62. ‘Tis my intention a long life to live, though with thy hammer thou dost threaten me. Skrymir’s thongs seemed to thee hard, when at the food thou couldst not get, when, in full health, of hunger dying.
Thor 63. Silence, thou impure being! My mighty hammer, Mjöllnir, shall stop thy prating. Hrungnir’s bane shall cast thee down to Hel, beneath the grating of the dead.



158
Loki 64. I have said before the Æsir, I have said before the Æsir’s sons, that which my mind suggested: but for thee alone will I go out; because I know that thou wilt fight.
65. Ægir! thou hast brewed beer; but thou never shalt henceforth a compotation hold. All thy possessions, which are herein, flame shall play over, and on thy back shall burn thee.
After this Loki, in the likeness of a salmon, cast himself into the waterfall of Franangr, where the Æsir caught him, and bound him with the entrails of his son Nari; but his other son, Narfi, was changed into a wolf. Skadi took a venomous serpent, and fastened it up over Loki’s face. The venom trickled down from it. Sigyn, Loki’s wife, sat by, and held a basin under the venom; and when the basin was full, carried the venom out. Meanwhile the venom dropped on Loki, who shrank from it so violently that the whole earth trembled. This causes what are not called earthquakes.



159
Fiölsvinnsmál: The Lay of Fiölsvith
1. From the outward wall he saw one ascending to the seat of the giant race.
Fiölsvith Along the humid ways haste the back hence, here, wretch! is no place for thee.
2. What monster is it before the fore-court standing, and hovering round the perilous flame? Whom dost thou seek? Of what art thou in quest? Or what, friendless being! desirest thou to know?
Wanderer 3. What monster is that, before the fore-court standing, who to the wayfarer offers not hospitality? Void of honest fame, prattler! hast thou lived: but hence hie thee home.
Fiölsvith 4. Fiölsvith is my name; wise I am of mind, though of food not prodigal. Within these courts thou shalt never come: so now, wretch! take thyself off.
Wanderer 5. From the eye’s delight few are disposed to hurry, where there is something pleasant to be seen. These walls, methinks, shine around golden halls. Here I could live contented with my lot.



160
Fiölsvith 6. Tell me, youth; of whom thou art born, or of what race hath sprung.
Wanderer 7. Vindkald I am called, Varkald was my father named, his sire was Fiölkald.
8. Tell me, Fiölsvith! that which I will ask thee, and I desire to know: who here holds sway, and has power over these lands and costly halls?
Fiölsvith 9. Menglöd is her name, her mother her begat with Svaf, Thorin’s son. She here holds sway, and has power over these lands and costly halls.
Vindkald 10. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what the grate is called, than which among the gods mortals never saw a greater artifice?
Fiölsvith 11. Thrymgiöll it is called, and Solblindi’s three sons constructed it: a fetter fastens every wayfarer, who lifts it from its opening.



161
Vindkald 12. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what that structure is called, than which among the gods mortals never saw a greater artifice?
Fiölsvith 13. Gastropnir it is called, and I constructed it of Leirbrimir’s limbs. I have so supported it, that it will ever stand while the world lasts.
Vindkald 14. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what those dogs are called, that chase away the giantesses, and safety to the fields restore?
Fiölsvith 15. Gifr the one is called, the other Geri, if thou that wouldst know. Eleven watches they will keep, until the powers perish.
Vindkald 16. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether any man can enter while those fierce assailants sleep?
Fiölsvith 17. Alternate sleep was strictly to them enjoined, since to the watch they were appointed. One sleeps by night, by day the other, so that no wight can enter if he comes.



162
Vindkald 18. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether there is any food that men can get, such that they can run in while they eat?
Fiölsvith 19. Two repasts lie in Vidofnir’s wings, if thou that wouldst know: that is alone such food as men can give them, and run in while they eat.
Vindkald 20. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what that tree is called that with its branches spreads itself over every land?
Fiölsvith 21. Mimameidr it is called; but few men know from what roots it springs: it by that will fall which fewest know. Nor fire nor iron will harm it.
Vindkald 22. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. to what the virtue is of that famed tree applied, which nor fire nor iron will harm?
Fiölsvith 23. Its fruit shall on the fire be laid, for labouring women; out then will pass what would in remain: so it is a creator of mankind.



163
Vindkald 24. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what the cock is called that sits in that lofty tree, and all-glittering is with gold?
Fiölsvith 25. Vidofnir he is called; in the clear air he stands, in the boughs of Mima’s tree: afflictions only brings, together indissoluble, the swart bird at his lonely meal.
Vindkald 26. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether there be any weapon, before which Vidofnir may fall to Hel’s abode?
27. Hævatein the twig is named, and Lopt plucked it, down by the gate of Death. In an iron chest it lies with Sinmoera, and is with nine strong locks secured.
Vindkald 28. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether he will alive return, who seeks after, and will take, that rod?
Fiölsvith 29. He will return who seeks after, and will take, the rod, if he bears that which few possess to the dame of the glassy clay.



164
Vindkald 30. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether there is any treasure, that mortals can obtain, at which the pale giantess will rejoice?
Fiölsvith 31. The bright sickle that lies in Vidofnir’s wings, thou in a bag shalt bear, and to Sinmoera give, before she will think fit to lend an arm for conflict.
Vindkald 32. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what this hall is called, which is girt round with a curious flickering flame?
Fiölsvith 33. Hyr it is called, and it will long tremble as on a lance’s point. This sumptuous house shall, for ages hence, be but from hearsay known.
Vindkald 34. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. which of the Æsir’s sons has that constructed, which within the court I saw?
Fiölsvith 35. Uni and Iri, Bari and Ori, Var and Vegdrasil, Dorri and Uri, Delling and Atvard, Lidskialf, Loki.



165
Vindkald 36. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. what that mount is called on which I see a splendid maiden stand?
Fiölsvith 37. Hyfiaberg ‘tis called, and long has it a solace been to the bowed-down and sorrowful: each woman becomes healthy, although a year’s disease she have, if she can but ascend it.
Vindkald 38. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. how those maids are called, who sit at Menglöd’s knees in harmony together?
Fiölsvith 39. Hlif the first is called, the second is Hlifthursa, the third Thiodvarta, Biört and Blid, Blidr, Frid, Eir and Örboda.
Vindkald 40. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether they protect those who offer to them, if it should, be needful?
Fiölsvith 41. Every summer in which men offer to them, at the holy place, no pestilence so great shall come to the sons of men, but they will free each from peril.



166
Vindkald 42. Tell me, Fiölsvith! etc. whether there is any man that may in Menglöd’s soft arms sleep?
Fiölsvith 43. There is no man who may in Menglöd’s soft arms sleep, save only Svipdag; to him the sun-bright maid is for wife betrothed.
Vindkald 44. Set the doors open! Let the gate stand wide; here thou mayest Svipdag see; but yet go learn if Menglöd will accept my love.
Fiölsvith 45. Hear, Menglöd! A man is hither come: go and behold the stranger; the dogs rejoice; the house is opened. I think it must be Svipdag.
Menglöd 46. Fierce ravens shall, on the high gallows, tear out thy eyes, if thou art lying, that hither from afar is come the youth unto my halls.



167
47. Whence art thou come? Whence hast thou journeyed? How do thy kindred call thee? Of thy race and name I must have a token, if I was betrothed to thee.
Svipdag 48. Svipdag I am named, Solbiart was my father named; thence the winds on the cold ways drove me. Urd’s decree may no one gainsay, however lightly uttered.
Menglöd 49. Welcome thou art: my will I have obtained; greeting a kiss shall follow. A sight unlooked-for gladdens most persons, when one the other loves.
50. Long have I sat on my loved hill, day and night expecting thee. Now that is come to pass which I have hoped, that thou, dear youth, again to my halls art come.
Svipdag 51. Longing I have undergone for thy love; and thou, for my affection. Now it is certain, that we shall pass our lives together.

Hyndlulioð: The Lay of Hyndla
Freyja rides with her favourite Ottar to Hyndla, a Vala, for the purpose of obtaining information respecting Ottar’s genealogy, such information being required by him in a legal dispute with Angantyr. Having obtained this, Freyja further requests Hyndla to give Ottar a portion (minnisöl) that will enable him to remember all that has been told him. This she refuses, but is forced to comply by Freyja having encircled her cave with flames. She gives him the potion, but accompanied by a malediction, which is by Freyja turned to a blessing.
Freyja 1. Wake, maid of maids! Wake, my friend! Hyndla! Sister! who in the cavern dwellest. Now there is a dark of darks; we will both to Valhall ride, and to the holy fane.
2. Let us Heriafather pray into our minds to enter, he gives and grants gold to the deserving. He gave to Hermod a helm and corslet, and from him Sigmund a sword received.
3. Victory to his sons he gives, but to some riches; eloquence to the great, and to men, wit; fair wind he gives to traders, but poesy to skalds; valor he gives to many a warrior.



170
4. She to Thor will offer, she to him will pray, that to thee he may be well disposed; although he bears ill will to Jötun females.
5. Now of thy wolves take one from out the stall; let him run with runic rein.1
Hyndla 6. Sluggish is thy hog the god’s way to tread:
Freyja 7. I will my noble palfrey saddle.
Hyndla 8. False art thou, Freyja! who tempest me: by thy eyes thou showest it, so fixed upon us; while thou thy man hast on the dead-road,2 the young Ottar, Innstein’s son.
Freyja 9. Dull art thou, Hyndla! methinks thou dreamest, since thou sayest that my man is on the dead-road with me; there where my hog sparkles with its golden bristles, hight Hildisvini, which for me made
1. That is, with a rein inscribed with runes.
2. The road to Valhall.



171
the two skilful dwarfs, Dain and Nabbi. From the saddle we will talk: let us sit, and of princely families discourse, of those chieftains who from the gods descend. They have contested for the dead’s gold, Ottar the young and Angantyr.
10. A duty ‘tis to act so that the young prince his paternal heritage may have, after his kindred.
11. An offer-stead to me he raised, with stones constructed; now is that stone as glass become. With the blood of oxen he newly sprinkled it. Ottar ever trusted in the Asyniur.
12. Now let us reckon up the ancient families, and the races of exalted men. Who are the Skiöldings? Who are the Skilfings? Who the Ödlings? Who the Ylfings? Who the höld-born? Who the hers-born? The choicest race of men under heaven?



172
Hyndla 13. Thou, Ottar! art of Innstein born, but Innstein was from Alf the Old, Alf was from Ulf. Ulf from Sæfari, but Sæfari from Svan the Red.
14. Thy father had a mother, for her necklaces famed, she, I think, was named Hledis the priestess; Frodi her father was, and her mother Friant: all that stock is reckoned among chieftains.
15. Ali was of old of men the strongest, Halfdan before him, the highest of the Skiöldungs; (Famed were the wars by those chieftains led) his deeds seemed to soar to the skirts of heaven.
16. By Eimund aided, chief of men, he Sigtrygg slew with the cold steel. He Almveig had to wife, first of women. They begat and had eighteen sons.



173
17. From them the Skiöldungs, from them the Skilfings, from them the Ödlings, from them the Ynglings, from them the höld-born, from them the hers-born, the choicest race of men under heaven. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!
18. Hildegun her mother was, of Svafa born and a sea-king. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski! Carest thou to know? Wishest thou a longer narrative?
19. Dag wedded Thora, mother of warriors; of that race were born the noble champions, Fradmar, Gyrd, and the Frekis both, Am, Jösur, Mar, Alf the Old. Carest thou this to know? Wishest thou a longer narrative?
20. Ketil their friend was named, heir of Klyp; he was maternal grandsire of thy mother. Then was Frodi yet before Kari, but the eldest born was Alf.



174
21. Nanna was next, Nökkvi’s daughter; her son was thy father’s kinsman, ancient is that kinship. I knew both Brodd and Hörfi. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!
22. Isolf, Asolf, Ölmod’s sons and Skurhild’s Skekkil’s daughter; thou shalt yet count chieftains many. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!
23. Gunnar, Balk, Grim, Ardskafi, Jarnskiöld, Thorir, Ulf, Ginandi, Bui and Brami, Barri and Reifnir, Tind and Tyrfing, the two Haddingis. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!
24. To toil and tumult were the sons of Arngrim born, and of Eyfura: ferocious berserkir, calamity of every kind, by land and sea, like fire they carried. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!



175
25. I knew both Brodd and Hörfi, they were in the court of Hrolf the Old; all descended from Jörmunrek, son-in-law of Sigurd. (Listen to my story) the dread of nations, him who Fafnir slew.
26. He was a king, from Völsung sprung, and Hiördis from Hrödung; but Eylimi from the Ödlings. All that race it thine, Ottar Heimski!
27. Gunnar and Högni, sons of Giuki; and Gudrun likewise, their sister. Guttorm was not of Giuki’s race, although he brother was of them both. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!
28. Harald Heildetönn, born of Hrærekir Slöngvanbaugi; he was a son of Aud, Aud the rich was Ivar’s daughter; but Radbard was Randver’s father. They were heroes to the gods devoted. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!



176
29. There were eleven Æsir reckoned, when Baldr on the pile was laid; him Vali showed himself worthy to avenge, his own brother: he the slayer slew. All that race is thine, Ottar Heimski!
30. Baldr’s father was son of Bur: Frey to wife had Gerd, she was Gymir’s daughter, from Jötuns sprung and Aurboda; Thiassi also was their relation, that haughty Jötun; Skadi was his daughter.
31. We tell thee much, and remember more: I admonish thee thus much to know. Wishest thou yet a longer narrative?
32. Haki was not the worst of Hvedna’s sons, and Hiövard was Hvedna’s father; Heid and Hrossthiof were of Hrimnir’s race.
33. All the Valas are from Vidolf; all the soothsayers from Vilmeidr, all the sorcerers from Svarthöfdi; all the Jötuns come from Ymir.



177
34. We tell thee much, and more remember, I admonish thee thus much to know. Wishest thou yet a longer narrative?
35. There was one born, in times of old, with wondrous might endowed, of origin divine: nine Jötun maids gave birth to the gracious god, at the world’s margin.
36. Gialp gave him birth, Greip gave him birth, Eistla gave him birth, and Angeia; Ulfrun gave him birth, and Eyrgiafa, Imd and Atla, and Jarnsaxa.
37. The boy was nourished with the strength of earth, with the ice-cold sea, and with Son’s blood. We tell thee much, and more remember. I admonish thee thus much to know. Wishest thou a yet longer narrative?
38. Loki begat the wolf with Angrboda, but Sleipnir he begat with Svadilfari: one monster seemed of all most deadly, which from Byleist’s brother sprang.



178
39. Loki, scorched up in his heart’s affections, had found a half-burnt woman’s heart. Loki became guileful from that wicked woman; thence in the world are all giantesses come.
40. Ocean towers with storms to heaven itself, flows o’er the land; the air is rent: thence come snows and rapid winds; then it is decreed that the rain should cease.
41. There was one born greater than all, the boy was nourished with the strength of earth; he was declared a ruler, mightiest and richest, allied by kinship to all princes.
42. Then shall another come, yet mightier, although I dare not his name declare. Few may see further forth than when Odin meets the wolf.



179
Freyja 43. Bear thou the memory-cup to my guest, so that he may all the words repeat of this discourse, on the third morn, when he and Angantyr reckon up races.
Hyndla 44. Go thou quickly hence, I long to sleep; more of my wondrous power thou gettest not from me. Thou runnest, my hot friend, out at nights, as among he-goats the she-goat goes.
45. Thou hast run thyself mad, ever longing; many a one has stolen under thy girdle. Thou runnest, my hot friend, out at nights, as among he-goats the she-goat goes.
Freyja 46. Fire I strike over thee, dweller of the wood! so that thou goest not ever away from hence.



180
Hyndla 47. Fire I see burning, and the earth blazing; many will have their lives to save. Bear thou the cup to Ottar’s hand, the mead with venom mingled, in an evil hour!
Freyja 48. Thy malediction shall be powerless; although thou, Jötun-maid! dost evil threaten. He shall drink delicious draughts. All the gods I pray to favour Ottar.



181
Gróagaldr: The Incantation of Groa
Son 1. Wake up, Groa! wake up, good woman! at the gates of death I wake thee! if thou remembrest, that thou thy son badest to thy grave-mound to come.
Mother 2. What now troubles my only son? With what affliction art thou burthened, that thou thy mother callest, who to dust is come, and from human homes departed?
Son 3. A hateful game thou, crafty woman, didst set before me, whom my father has in his bosom cherished, when thou bides me go no one knows whither, Menglöd to meet.
Mother 4. Long is the journey, long are the ways, long are men’s desires. If it so fall out, that thou thy will obtainest, the event must then be as it may.
Son 5. Sing to me songs which are good. Mother! protect thy son. Dead on my way I fear to be. I seem to young in years.



182
Mother 6. I will sing to thee first one that is thought most useful, which Rind sang to Ran; that from thy shoulders thou shouldst cast what to thee seems irksome: let thyself thyself direct.
7. A second I will sing to thee, as thou hast to wander joyless on the ways. May Urd’s protection hold thee on every side, where thou seest turpitude.
8. A third I will sing to thee. If the mighty rivers to thy life’s peril fall, Horn and Rud, may they flow down to Hel, and for thee ever be diminished.
9. A fourth I will sing to thee. If foes assail thee ready on the dangerous road, their hearts shall fail them, and to thee be power, and their minds to peace be turned.
10. A fifth I will sing to thee. If bonds be cast on thy limbs, friendly spells I will let on thy joints be sung, and the lock from thy arms shall start, (and from thy feet the fetter.)
11. A sixth I will sing to thee. If on the sea thou comest, more stormy than men have known it, air and water shall in a bag attend thee, and a tranquil course afford thee.



183
12. A seventh I will sing to thee. If on a mountain high frost should assail thee, deadly cold shall not thy carcase injure, nor draw thy body to thy limbs.
13. An eighth I will sing to thee. If night overtake thee, when out on the misty way, that the dead Christian woman no power may have to do thee harm.
14. A ninth I will sing to thee. If with a far-famed spear-armed Jötun thou words exchangest, of words and wit to thy mindful heart abundance shall be given.
15. Go now ever where calamity may be, and no harm shall obstruct thy wishes. On a stone fast in the earth I have stood within the door, while songs I sang to thee.
16. My son! bear hence thy mother’s words, and in thy breast let them dwell; for happiness abundant shalt thou have in life, while of my words thou art mindful.

Solarlióð: The Song of the Sun
This singular poem, the authorship of which is, in some manuscripts, assigned to Sæmund himself, may be termed a Voice from the Dead, given under the form of a dream, in which a deceased father is supposed to address his son from another world. The first 7 strophes seem hardly connected with the following ones, which, as far as the 32nd consist chiefly in aphorisms with examples, some closely resembling those in the Hávamál. In the remaining portion is given the recital of the last illness of the supposed speaker, his death, and the scenes his soul passed through on the way to its final home. The composition exhibits a strange mixture of Christianity and Heathenism, whence it would seem that the poet’s own religion was in a transition state. Of the allusions to Heathenism it is, however, to be observed that they are chiefly to persons and actions of which there is no trace in the Odinic mythology, as known to us, and are possibly the fruits of the poet’s own imagination. The title of the poem is no doubt derived from the allusion to the Sun at the beginning of the strophes 39-45. For an elaborate and learned commentary, with an interlinear version of the Song of the Sun, the reader may consult Les Chants de Sol, by Professor Bergmann, Strassbourg & Paris, 1858.
1. Of life and property a fierce freebooter despoiled mankind; over the ways beset by him might no one living pass.
2. Alone he ate most frequently, no one invited he to his repast; until weary, and with failing strength, a wandering guest came from the way.
3. In need of drink that way-worn man, and hungry feigned to be: with trembling heart he seemed to trust him who had been so evil-minded.



186
4. Meat and drink to the weary one he gave, all with upright heart; on God he thought, the traveller’s wants supplied; for he felt he was an evil-doer.
5. Up stood the guest, he evil meditated, he had not been kindly treated; his sin within him swelled, he while sleeping murdered his wary cautious host.
6. The God of heaven he prayed for help, when being struck he woke; but he was doomed the sins of him on himself to take, whom sackless he had slain.
7. Holy angels came from heaven above, and took to them his soul: in a life of purity it shall ever live with the almighty God. *****************************
8. Riches and health no one may command, though all go smoothly with him. To many that befalls which they least expect. No one may command his tranquility.
9. Unnar and Sævaldi never imagined that happiness would fall on them, yet naked they became, and of all bereft, and, like wolves, ran to the forest. *******************************



187
10. The force of pleasure has many a one bewailed. Cares are often caused by women; pernicious they become, although the mighty God them pure created.
11. United were Svafud and Skarthedin, neither might without the other be, until to frenzy they were driven for a woman; she was destined for their perdition.
12. On account of that fair maid, neither of them cared for games or joyous days; no other thing could they in memory bear then that bright form.
13. Sad to them were the gloomy nights, no sweet sleep might they enjoy: but from that anguish rose hate intense between the faithful friends.
14. Hostile deeds are in most places fiercely avenged. To the holm they went,1 for that fair woman, and each one found his death. ***********************************
15. Arrogance should no one entertain: I indeed have seen that those who follow her,
1. That is, they engaged in single combat; the spot for such encounters being called a holm, consisting of a
circular space marked out by stones.



188
for the most part, turn from God.
16. Rich were both, Radey and Vebogi, and thought only of their well-being; now they sit and turn their sores to various hearths.
17. They in themselves confided, and thought themselves alone to be above all people; but their lot Almighty God was pleased otherwise to appoint.
18. A life of luxury they led, in may ways, and had gold for sport. Now they are requited, so that they must walk between frost and fire.
19. To thy enemies trust thou never, although they speak thee fair: promise them good: ‘tis good to have another’s injury as a warning.
20. So it befell Sörli the upright, when he placed himself in Vigolf ’s power; he confidently trusted him, his brother’s murderer, but he proved false.
21. Peace to them he granted, with heart sincere; they in return promised him gold, feigned themselves friends.,



189
while they together drank; but then came forth their guile.
22. Then afterwards, on the second day, when they in Rýgiardal rode, they with swords wounded him who sackless was, and let his life go forth.
23. His corpse they dragged (on a lonely way, and cut up piecemeal) into a well, and would it hide; but the holy Lord beheld from heaven.
24. His soul summoned home the true God into his joy to come; but the evil doers will, I ween, late be from torments called. ************************************
25. Do thou pray the Disir of the Lord’s words to be kind to thee in spirit: for a week after, all shall then go happily, according to thy will.
26. For a deed of ire that thou has perpetrated, never atone with evil: the weeping thou shalt sooth with benefits: that is salutary to the soul.
27. On God a man shall for good things call, on him who has mankind created.



190
Greatly sinful is every man who late finds the Father.
28. To be solicited, we opine, is with all earnestness for that which is lacking: of all things may be destitute he who for nothing asks: few heed the wants of the silent.
29. Late I came, though called betimes, to the supreme Judge’s door; thitherward I yearn; for it was promised me, he who craves it shall of the feast partake.
30. Sins are the cause that sorrowing we depart from this world: no one stands in dread, if he does no evil: good it is to be blameless.
31. Like unto wolves all those seem who have a faithless mind: so he will prove who has to go through ways strewed with gleeds.
32. Friendly counsels, and wisely composed, seven I have imparted to thee: consider thou them well, and forget them never: they are all useful to learn. *************************************



191
33. Of that I will speak, how happy I was in the world, and secondly, how the sons of men reluctantly become corpses.
34. Pleasure and pride deceive the sons of men who after money crave; shining riches at last become a sorrow: many have riches driven to madness.
35. Steeped in joys I seemed to men; for little did I see before me: our worldly sojourn has the Lord created in delights abounding.
36. Bowed down I sat, long I tottered, of life was most desirous; but He prevailed who was all-powerful: onward are the ways of the doomed.
37. The cords of Hel were tightly bound round my sides; I would rend them, but they were strong. ‘Tis easy free to go.
38. I alone knew, how on all sides my pains increased. The maids of Hel each eve with horror bade me to their home.



192
39. The sun I saw, true star of day, sink in its roaring home; but Hel’s grated doors on the other side I heard heavily creaking.
40. The sun I saw with blood-red beams beset: (fast was I then from this world declining) mightier she appeared, in many ways than she was before.
41. The sun I saw, and it seemed to me as if I saw a glorious god: I bowed before her, for the last time, in the world of men.
42. The sun I saw: she beamed forth so that I seemed nothing to know; but Giöll’s streams roared from the other side mingled much with blood.
43. The sun I saw, with quivering eyes, appalled and shrinking; for my heart in great measure was dissolved in languor.
44. The sun I saw seldom sadder; I had then almost from the world declined: my tongue was as wood become, and all was cold without me.



193
45. The sun I saw never after, since that gloomy day; for the mountain-waters closed over me, and I went called from torments.
46. The star of hope, when I was born, fled from my breast away; high it flew, settled nowhere, so that it might find rest.
47. Longer than all was that one night, when stiff on my straw I lay; then becomes manifest the divine word: “Man is the same as earth.”
48. The Creator God can it estimate and know, (He who made heaven and earth) how forsaken many go hence, although from kindred parted.
49. Of his works each has the reward: happy is he who does good. Of my wealth bereft, to me was destined a bed strewed with sand.
50. Bodily desires men oftentimes seduce, of them has many a one too much: water of baths was of all things to me most loathsome.



194
51. In the Norns’ seat nine days I sat, thence I was mounted on a horse: there the giantess’s sun shone grimly through the dripping clouds of heaven.
52. Without and within, I seemed to traverse all the seven nether worlds: up and down, I sought an easier way, where I might have the readiest paths. ************************************
53. Of that is to be told, which I first saw, when I to the worlds of torment came:scorched birds, which were souls, flew numerous as flies.
54. From the west I saw Von’s dragons fly, and Glæval’s paths obscure: their wings they shook; wide around me seemed the earth and heaven to burst.
55. The sun’s hart I saw from the south coming, he was by two together led: his feet stood on the earth, but his horns reached up to heaven.
56. From the north riding I saw the sons of Nidi, they were seven in all: from full horns, the pure mead they drank from the heaven-god’s well.



195
57. The wind was silent, the waters stopped their course; then I heard a doleful sound: for their husbands false-faced women ground earth for food.
58. Gory stones those dark women turned sorrowfully; bleeding hearts hung out of their breasts, faint with much affliction.
59. Many a man I saw wounded go on those gleed-strewed paths; their faces seemed to me all reddened with reeking blood.
60. Many men I saw to earth gone down, who holy service might not have; heathen stars stood above their heads, painted with deadly characters.
61. I saw those men who much envy harbour at another’s fortune; bloody runes were on their breasts graved painfully.
62. I there saw men many not joyful; they were all wandering wild: this he earns, who by this world’s vices is infatuated.



196
63. I saw those men who had in various ways acquired other’s property: in shoals they went to Castle-covetous, and burthens bore of lead.
64. I saw those men who many had of life and property bereft: through the breasts of those men passed strong venomous serpents.
65. I saw those men who the holy days would not observe: their hands were on hot stones firmly nailed.
66. I saw those men who from pride valued themselves too highly; their garments ludicrously were in fire enveloped.
67. I saw those men who had many false words of others uttered: Hel’s ravens from their heads their eyes miserably tore.
68. All the horrors thou wilt not get to know which Hel’s inmates suffer. Pleasant sins end in painful penalties: pains ever follow pleasure. *********************************



197
69. I saw those men who had much given for God’s laws; pure lights were above their heads brightly burning.
70. I saw those men who from exalted mind helped the poor to aid: angels read holy books above their heads.
71. I saw those men who with much fasting had their bodies wasted: God’s angels bowed before them: that is the highest joy.
72. I saw those men who had put food into their mothers’ mouth: their couches were on the rays of heaven pleasantly placed.
73. Holy virgins had cleanly washed the souls from sin of those men, who for a long time had themselves tormented.
74. Lofty cars I saw towards heaven going; they were on the way to God: men guided them who had been murdered wholly without crime.



198
75. Almighty Father! greatest Son! holy Spirit of heaven! Thee I pray, who hast us all created; free us all from miseries. **********************************
76. Biugvör and Listvör sit at Herðir’s doors, on resounding seat; iron gore falls from their nostrils, which kindles hate among men.
77. Odin’s wife rows in earth’s ship, eager after pleasures; her sails are reefed late, which on the ropes of desire are hung.
78. Son! I thy father and Solkatla’s sons have alone obtained for thee that horn of hart, which from the grave-mound bore the wise Vigdvalin.
79. Here are runes which have engraven Niörd’s daughters nine, Radvör the eldest, and the youngest Kreppvör, and their seven sisters.
80. How much violence have they perpetrated Svaf and Svaflogi! bloodshed they have excited, and wounds have sucked, after an evil custom.



199
81. This lay, which I have taught thee, thou shalt before the living sing, the Sun-Song, which will appear in many parts no fiction.
82. Here we part, but again shall meet on the day of men’s rejoicing. Oh Lord! unto the dead grant peace, and to the living comfort.
83. Wondrous lore has in dream to thee been sung, but thou hast seen the truth: no man has been so wise created that has before heard the Sun-Song.

Part 2: The Heroic Lays
Preface
In the preface to the first or mythological part of this translation of Sæmund’s Edda, I announced my intention of publishing the second or heroic portion, should that first part be not unfavourably received. That condition has been fulfilled, for not only has its reception here been favourable, but in the United States of America it has been noticed in terms highly gratifying to the translator. I now therefore do not hesitate to publish the second part. The limits within which I deem it necessary to confine myself, from my desire to produce a small work at a moderate cost, admit only of a very brief notice of the poems contained in this portion of the Edda: The Lay of Völund (Völundarkvida) celebrates the story of Völund’s doing and sufferings during his sojourn in the territory of the Swedish king Nidud. (Ger. Wieland, Fr. Veland and Galans) is the Scandinavian and Germanic Vulcan (Hephaistos) and Dædalus. In England his story, as a skillful smith, is traceable to a very early period. In the Anglo-Saxon poem of Beowulf we find that hero desiring, in the event of his falling in conflict with Grendel, that his corslet may be sent to Hygelac, being, as he says, the work of Weland: and king Ælfred, in his translation of Boethius de Consolatione, renders the words fidelis ossa Fabricii, etc. by Hwæt (hwær) sint nu Þæs foremæran and Þæs wisan goldsmiðes ban Welondes? (Where are now the bones of the famous and wise goldsmith Weland?), evidently taking the proper name of Fabricius for an appellative equivalent to faber. In the Exeter Book, too, there is a poem in substance closely resembling the Eddaic lay. In his novel of Kenilworth, Walter Scott has been guilty of a woeful perversion of the old tradition, travestied from the Berkshire legend of Wayland Smith. As a land-boundary we find Weland’s smithy in a charter of king Eadred a.d. 955. Ampler details concerning Weland are to be found in Mr. Price’s preface to Warton’s History of English Poetry 8vo., edit.; Müller, Sagabibliothek, II. pp. 157 sqq.; Grimm, Deutsche Mythologie, pp. 349 sqq. edit. 1844; Müller, Aldeutsche Religion, p. 311. Much interesting matter will also be found in Weber and Jamieson ́s Illustrations of Northern Antiquities. Bishop Müller, derives the name from O. Nor. Vél, thinking that it is only according to the Norse pronunciation that it has a signification, viz. art, wile, guile, and lundr, mind, disposition, and is thence inclined to assign a Northern origin to the story. But may not the form Völundr be merely a Northern adaptation of the German Wieland or Anglo-Saxon Weland? On the Lay of Helgi Hiörvard ́s Son there is nothing to remark beyond what appears in the poem itself. The Lays of Helgi Hundingcide form the first of the series of stories relating to the Völsung race, and the Giukungs, or Niflungs. The connection of the several personages celebrated in these poems will appear plain from the following tables.



202
The Eddaic series of the Völsung and Niflung lays terminates with the Lay of Hamdir; the one entitled Gunnar’s Melody is no doubt a comparatively late composition; yet being written in the true ancient spirit of the North is well deserving of a place among the Eddaic poems. Nor, indeed, is the claim of the Lay of Grotti to rank among the poems collected by Sæmund, by any means clear, we know it only from its existence in the Skalda; yet on account of its antiquity, its intrinsic worth, and its reception in other editions of the Edda, both in original and translation, the present work would

seem, and justly so, incomplete without it. Had the limits, within which I am desirous to confine my humble attempt at a version of the Poetic Edda, permitted, I would have assigned a portion of this preface to some notice of the relation between the Northern poems relating to the Völsungs and Giukungs, or Niflungs, and the same subject as it appears in the Nibelunge Not; but as the latter is familiar to many readers and accessible to all, in the original old German, in modern German, and in more than one excellent English version, I omit all further mention of the subject. In compliance with the expressed wish of the Publishers, I subscribe my name as the translator of Sæmund’s Edda.

Völundarkviða: The Lay of Völund
There was a king in Sweden named Nidud: he had two sons and a daughter, whose name was Bödvild. There were three brothers, sons of a king of the Finns, one was called Slagfid, the second Egil, the third Völund. They went on snow-shoes and hunted wild-beasts. They came to Ulfdal, and there made themselves a house, where there is a water called Ulfsíar. Early one morning they found on the border of the lake three females sitting and spinning flax. Near them lay their swan-plumages: they were Valkyriur. Two of them, Hladgud-Svanhvit and Hervör-Alvit, were daughters of King Hlödver; the third was Ölrún, a daughter of Kiár of Valland. They took them home with them to their dwelling. Egil had Ölrún, Slagfid Svanhvit, and Völund Alvit. They lived there seven years, when they few away seeking conflicts, and did not return. Egil then went on snow-shoes in search of Ölrún, and Slagfid in search of Svanhvit, but Völund remained in Ulfdal. He was a most skilful man, as we learn from old traditions. King Nidud ordered him to be seized, so as it is here related.
1. Maids flew from the south, through the murky wood, Alvit the young, fate to fulfil.
2. One of them, of maidens fairest, to his comely breast Egil clasped. Svanhvit was the second, she a swan’s plumage bore; but the third, their sister, the white neck clasped of Völund.
3. There they stayed seven winters through; but all the eighth were with longing seized; and in the ninth fate parted them. The maidens yearned for the murky wood, the young Alvit, fate to fulfil.



206
4. From the chase came the ardent hunters, Slagfid and Egil, found their house deserted, went out and in, and looked around. Egil went east after Ölrún, and Slagfid west after Svanhvit;
5. But Völund alone remained in Ulfdal. He the red gold set with the hard gem, well fastened all the rings on linden bast, and so awaited his bright consort, if to him she would return.
6. It was told to Nidud, the Niarars’ lord, that Völund alone remained in Ulfdal. In the night went men, in studded corslets, their shields glistened in the waning moon.
7. From their saddles they alighted at the house’s gable, thence went in through the house. On the bast they saw the rings all drawn, seven hundred, which the warrior owned.



207
8. And they took them off, and they put them on, all save one, which they bore away. Came then from the chase the ardent hunter, Völund, gliding1 on the long way.
9. To the fire he went, bear’s flesh to roast. Soon blazed the brushwood, and the arid fir, the wind-dried wood, before Völund.
10. On the bearskin sat, his rings counted, the Alfar’s companion: one was missing. He thought that Hlödver ́s daughter had it, the young Alvit, and that she was returned.
11. So long he sat until he slept; and he awoke of joy bereft: on his hands he felt heavy constraints, and round his feet fetters clasped.
12. “Who are the men that on the rings’ possessor have laid bonds? and me have bound?”
1. On snow-shoes.



208
13. Then cried Nidud, the Niarars’ lord: “Whence gottest thou, Völund! Alfars’ chief!2 our gold, in Ulfdal?”
14. “No gold was here in Grani’s path, far I thought our land from the hills of Rhine. I mind me that we more treasures possessed, when, a whole family, we were at home.
15. Hladgud and Hervör were of Hlödver born; know was Ölrún, Kiar’s daughter, she entered into the house, stood on the floor, her voice moderated: “Now is he not mirthful, who from the forest comes.”
King Nidud gave to his daughter Bödvild the ring which had been taken from the bast in Völund’s house; but he himself bore the sword that had belonged to Völund. The queen said:
16. His teeth he shows, when the sword he sees, and Bödvild’s ring he recognizes: threatening are his eyes as a glistening serpent’s: let be severed his sinews’ strength;
2. The designation of Alfars’ chief, or prince, applied to Volund, who, as we learn from the prose introduc
tion, was a son of a king of the Finns, may perhaps be accounted for by the circumstance that the poem itself
hardly belongs to the Odinic Mythology, and was probably composed when that system was in its decline and
giving place to the heroic or romantic.



209
and set him then in Sævarstad.
This was done; he was hamstrung and then set on a certain small island near the shore, called Sævarstad. He there forged for the king all kinds of jewelry work. No one was allowed to go to him, except the king. Völund said:
17. “The sword shines in Nidud’s belt, which I whetted as I could most skillfully, and tempered, as seemed to me most cunningly. That bright blade for ever is taken from me: never shall I see it borne into Völund’s smithy.
18. Now Bödvild wears my consort’s red-gold rings: for this I have no indemnity.” He sat and never slept, and his hammer plied; but much more speedy vengeance devised on Nidud.
19. The two young sons of Nidud ran in at the door to look, in Sævarstad. To the chest they came, for the keys asked; manifest was their grudge, when therein they looked.
20. Many necklaces were there, which to those youths appeared of the red gold to be, and treasures. “Come ye two alone, to-morrow come;



210
that gold shall be given to you.
21. Tell it not to the maidens, nor to the household folk, nor to any one, that ye have been with me.” Early called one the other, brother, brother: “Let us go see the rings.”
22. To the chest they came, for the keys asked; manifest was their grudge, when therein they looked. Of those children he the heads cut off, and under the prison’s mixen laid their bodies.
23. But their skulls beneath the hair he in silver set, and to Nidud gave; and of their eyes precious stones he formed, which to Nidud’s wily wife he sent.
24. But of the teeth of the two breast-ornaments he made, and to Bödvild sent. Then did Bödvild praise the ring: to Völund brought it, when she had broken it: “I dare to no one tell it, save alone to thee.”



211
Völund 25. “I will so repair the fractured gold, that to thy father it shall fairer seem, and to thy mother much more beautiful, and to thyself, in the same degree.”
26. He then brought her beer, that he might succeed the better, as on her seat she fell asleep. “Now have I my wrongs avenged, all save one in the wood perpetrated.”3
27. “I wish,” said Völund, “that on my feet I were, of the use of which Nidud’s men have deprived me.” Laughing Völund rose in the air: Bödvild weeping from the isle departed. She mourned her lover’s absence, and for her father’s wrath.
28. Stood without Nidud’s wily wife; then she went in through the hall; but he on the enclosure sat down to rest. “Art thou awake Niarars’ lord!”
3. The translation of this line is founded solely on a conjectural emendation of the text. The wrong alluded
to may be the hamstrining.



212
29. “Ever am I awake, joyless I lie to rest, when I call to mind my children’s death: my head is chilled, cold are to me thy counsels. Now with Völund I desire to speak.”
30. “Tell me, Völund, Alfars’ chief! of my brave boys what is become?”
31. “Oaths shalt thou first to me swear, by board of ship, by rim of shield, by shoulder of steed, by edge of sword, that thou wilt not slay the wife of Völund, nor of my bride cause the death; although a wife I have whom ye know, or offspring within thy court.
32. To the smithy go, which thou has made, there wilt thou the bellows find with blood besprinkled. The heads I severed of thy boys, and under the prison’s mixen laid their bodies.



213
33. But their skulls beneath the hair I in silver set, and to Nidud gave; and of their eyes precious stones I formed, which to Nidud’s wily wife I sent.
34. Of the teeth of the two, breast-ornaments I made, and to Bödvild sent. Now Bödvild goes big with child, the only daughter of you both.”
35. “Word didst thou never speak that more afflicted me, or for which I would more severely punish thee. There is no man so tall that he from thy horse can take thee, or so skilful that he can shoot thee down, thence where thou floatest up in the sky.”
36. Laughing Völund rose in air, but Nidud sad remained sitting.
37. “Rise up Thakrád, my best of thralls! bid Bödvild, my fair-browed daughter, in bright attire come, with her sire to speak.



214
38. Is it, Bödvild! true what has been told to me, that thou and Völund in the isle together sat?”
39. “True it is, Nidud! what has been told to thee, that Völund and I in the isle together sat, in an unlucky hour: would it had never been! I could not against him strive, I might not against him prevail.”

HelgakviÞa Hiörvarðs Sonar
The Lay of Helgi Hiörvard ́s son
There was a king named Hiörvard, who had four wives, one of whom was named Alfhild, their son was named Hedin; the second was named Særeid, their son was Humlung; the third was named Sinriód, their son was Hymling. King Hiörvard made a vow that he would have to wife the most beautiful woman he knew of, and was told that King Svafnir had a daughter of incomparable beauty, named Sigrlinn. He had a jarl named Idmund, whose son Atli was sent to demand the hand of Sigrlinn for the king. He stayed throughout the winter with King Svafnir. There was a jarl there named Franmar, who was the foster-father of Sigrlinn, and had a daughter named Alöf. This jarl advised that the maiden should be refused, and Atli returned home. One day when the jarl’s son Atli was standing in a grove, there was a bird sitting in the boughs above him, which had heard that his men called the wives which King Hiörvard had the most beautiful. The bird talked, and Atli listened to what it said. The bird said:
1. Hast thou seen Sigrlinn, Svafnir’s daughter, of maidens fairest, in her pleasant home? though fair the wives of Hiörvard seem to men in Glasis-lund.
Atli 2. With Atli, Idmund’s son, sagacious bird! wilt thou further speak?
Bird I will if the prince will offer to me, and I may choose what I will from the king’s court.



216
Atli 3. Choose not Hiörvard nor his sons, nor the fair daughters of that prince, nor the wives which the king has. Let us together bargain; that is the part of friends.
Bird 4. A fane I will chose, offer-steads many, gold-horned cows from the chief ’s land, if Sigrlinn sleep in his arms, and unconstrained with that prince shall live.
This took place before Atli’s journey; but after his return, when the king asked his tidings, he said:
5. Labor we have had, but errand none performed; our horses failed us in the vast fell; we had afterwards a swampy lake to ford; then was denied us Svafnir’s daughter with rings adorned, whom we would obtain.
The king commanded them to go a second time, and also went himself. But when they had ascended a fell, and saw in Svavaland the country on fire, and a great reek from the horses of cavalry, the king rode down the fell into the country, and took up his night-quarters by a river. Atli kept watch, and crossed the river, and came to a house, on which sat a great bird to guard it, but was asleep. Atli shot the bird dead with an arrow. In the house he found the king’s daughter Sigrlinn, and Alöf daughter of Franmar, and brought them both away with him. The jarl Franmar had taken the form of an eagle, and protected them from a hostile army by sorcery. There was a king named Hrodmar, a wooer of Sigrlinn: he had slain the king of Svavaland, and ravaged and burnt the country. Hiörvard obtained Sigrlinn, and Atli Alöf. Hiörvard and Sigrlinn had a son tall and comely: he was taciturn and had no fixed name. As he was sitting on a mound he saw nine Valkyriur, one of whom was of



217
most noble aspect. She said:
6. Late wilt thou, Helgi! rings possess, a potent warrior, or Rödulsvellir, so at morn the eagle sang if thou art ever silent; although thou, prince! a fierce mood mayest show.
Helgi 7. What wilt thou let accompany the name of Helgi, maid of aspect bright! since that thou art please to give me? Think well over what thou art saying. I will not accept it, unless I have thee also.
Valkyria 8. Swords I know lying in Sigarsholm, fewer by four than five times ten: one of them is of all the best, of shields the bale, with gold adorned.
9. A ring is on the hilt, courage in the midst, in the point terror for his use who owns it: along the edge a blood-stained serpent lies, and on the guard the serpent casts its tail.
There was a king named Eylimi; Svava was his daughter; she was a Valkyria and rode through air and water. It was she who gave Helgi that name, and afterwards often protected him in battle. Helgi said:



218
10. Hiörvard! thou art not a king of wholesome counsel, leader of people! renowned though thou mayest be. Thou has let fire devour the homes of princes, though harm to thee they none have done.
11. But Hródmar shall of the rings dispose, which our relations have possessed. That chief recks little of his life; he thinks only to obtain the heritage of the dead.
Hiörvard answers, that he will supply Helgi with an army, if he will avenge his mother’s father. Helgi thereupon seeks the sword that Svava had indicated to him. Afterwards he and Atli went and slew Hrodmar, and performed many deeds of valor. He killed the Jötun Hati, as he sat on a crag. Helgi and Atli lay with their ships in Hatafiörd. Atli kept watch in the first part of the night. Hrimgerd, Hati’s daughter, said:
12. Who are the chieftains in Hatafiörd? With shields are your ships bedecked; boldly ye bear yourselves, few things ye fear, I ween: tell me how your king is named.
Atli 13. Helgi is his name; but thou nowhere canst to the chief do harm; iron forts are around the prince’s fleet; giantesses may not assail us.



219
Hrimgerd 14. How art thou named? most powerful champion! How do men call thee? Thy king confides in thee, since in the ship’s fair prow he grants thee place.
Atli 15. Atli I am named, fierce I shall prove to thee; towards giantesses I am most hostile. The humid prow I have oft occupied, and the night-riders slain.
16. How art thou called? corpse-greedy gigantess! hag! name thy father. Nine rasts shouldst thou be underground, and a forest grow on thy breast.
Hrímgerd 17. Hrímgerd I am called, Hati was my father called, whom I knew the mightiest Jötun. He many women had from their dwellings taken, until him Helgi slew.
Atli 18. Thou wast, hag! before the prince's ships, and layest before them in the fiörd's mouth. The chieftain's warriors thou wouldst to Rán consign, had a bar not crossed thee.



220
Hrimgerd 19. Now, Atli! thou art wrong, methinks thou art dreaming; thy brows thou lettest over thy eyelids fall. My mother lay before the prince’s ships; I Hlödvard’s sons drowned in the ocean.
20. Thou wouldst neigh, Atli! if thou wert not a gelding. See! Hrímgerd cocks her tail. Thy heart, methinks, Atli! is in thy hinder part, although thy voice is clear.
Atli 21. I think I shall the stronger prove, if thou desirest to try; and I can step from the port to land. Thou shalt be soundly cudgeled, if I heartily begin, and let thy tail fall, Hrímgerd!
Hrimgerd 22. Just come on shore, Atli! if in thy strength thou trustest, and let us meet in Varinsvik. A rib-roasting thou shalt get, brave boy! if in my claws thou comest.
Atli 23. I will not come before the men awake, and o’er the king hold watch. It would not surprise me, if from beneath our ship some hag arose.



221
Hrimgerd 24. Keep watch, Atli! and to Hrimgerd pay the blood-fine for Hati’s death. If one night she may sleep with the prince, she for the slain will be indemnified.
Helgi 25. Lodin is named he who shall thee possess, thou to mankind art loathsome. In Tholley dwells that Thurs, that dog-wise Jötun, of all rock-dwellers the worst: he is a fitting man for thee.
Hrimgerd 26. Helgi would rather have her who last night guarded the port and men, the gold-bright maiden. She methought had strength, she stept from port to land, and so secured your fleet. She was alone the cause that I could not the king’s men slay.
Helgi 27. Hear now, Hrimgerd! If I may indemnify thee, say fully to the king: was it one being only, that saved the prince’s ships, or went many together?
Hrimgerd 28. Three troops of maidens; though one maid foremost rode, bright, with helmed head. Their horses shook themselves, and from their manes there sprang



222
dew into the deep dales, hail on the lofty trees, whence comes fruitfulness to man. To me all that I saw was hateful.
Atli 29. Look eastward now, Hrimgerd! whether Helgi has not stricken thee with death-bearing words. By land and water the king’s fleet is safe, and the chief ’s men also.
30. It is now day, Hrimgerd! and Atli has the detained to thy loss of life. A ludicrous haven-mark ‘twill, indeed, be, where thou a stone-image standest.
King Helgi was a renowned warrior. He came to King Eylimi and demanded his daughter Svava. Helgi and Svava were united, and loved each other ardently. Svava remained at home with her father, but Helgi was engaged in warfare. Svava was a Valkyria as before. Hedin was at home with his father, King Hiörvard in Norway. Returning home alone from the forest on a Yule-eve, Hedin met a troll-wife riding on a wolf, with serpents for reins, who offered to attend him, but he declined her offer; whereupon she said: “Thou shalt pay for this at the Bragi-cup.”1 In the evening solemn vows were made, and the són-hog was led forth, on which the guests laid their hands, and then made solemn vows at the Bragi-cup. Hedin bound himself by a vow to possess Svava, the beloved of his brother Helgi; but repented it so bitterly that he left home and wandered through wild paths to the southern lands, and there found his brother Helgi. Helgi said:
31. Welcome art thou, Hedin! What new tidings canst thou give from Norway?
1. At guilds the Bragi-cup (Bragafull) was drunk. It was the custom at the funeral feast of kings and jarls,
that the heir should sit on a lower seat, until the Bragafull was brought in, that he should then rise to receive
it, make a vow, and drink the contents of the cup (full). He was then led to his father’s high seat. At an offer
ing guild, the chief signed with the figure of Thor’s hammer both the cup and the meat. First was drunk Odin’s
cup, for victory and power to the king; then Niord’s cup, and Frey’s for a good year and peace; after which it
was the customer with many to drink a Bragafull. The peculiarity of this cup was, that it was a cup of vows,
that on drinking it a vow was made to perform some great and arduous deed, that might be made a subject
for the song of the skald.



223
Why art thou, prince! from the land driven, and alone art come to find us?
Hedin 32. Of a much greater crime I am guilty. I have chosen a royal daughter, thy bride, at the Bragi-cup.
Helgi 33. Accuse not thyself; true will prove words at drinking uttered by us both. Me a chieftain has to the strand summoned; within three nights I must be there. ‘Tis to me doubtful whether I return; then may well such befall, is it so must be.
Hedin 34. Thou saidst, Helgi! that Hedin well deserved of thee, and great gifts: It would beseem thee better thy sword to redden, than to grant peace to thy foes.
Helgi so spoke, for he had a foreboding that his death was at hand, and that his fylgiur (attendant spirit) had accosted Hedin, when he saw the woman riding on a wolf. There was a king named Alf, a son of Hrodmar, who had appointed a place of combat with Helgi in Sigar’s plain within three days. Then said Helgi:



224
35. On a wolf rode, at evening twilight, a woman who him offered to attend. She well knew, that the son of Sigrlinn would be slain, on Sigar’s plain.
There was a great conflict, in which Helgi got his death-wound.
36. Helgi sent Sigar riding, after Eylimi’s only daughter: he bade her quickly be in readiness, if she would find the king alive.
Sigar 37. Helgi has me hither sent, with thee, Svava! thyself to speak. Thee, said the king, he fain would see, ere the noble-born breathes forth his last.
Svava 38. What has befallen Helgi, Hiörvard’s son? I am sorely by afflictions stricken. Has the sea him deluded, or the sword wounded? On that man I will harm inflict.



225
Sigar 39. This morning fell, at Frekastein, the king who beneath the sun was of all the best. Alf has complete victory, though this time it should not have been!
Helgi 40. Hail to thee, Svava! Thy love thou must divide; this in this world, methinks, is our last meeting. They say the chieftain’s wounds are bleeding. The sword came too near my heart.
41. I pray thee, Svava! weep not, my wife! if thou wilt my voice obey that for Hedin thou a couch prepare, and the young prince in thy arms clasp.
Svava 42. I had said, in our pleasant home, when for me Helgi rings selected, that I would not gladly, after my king’s departure, an unknown prince clasp in my arms.



226
Hedin 43. Kiss me, Svava! I will not return, Rógheim to behold, nor Rödulsfiöll, before I have avenged Hiörvard ́s son, who was of kings under the sun the best.
Helgi and Svava were, it is said, born again.



227
Helgakviða Hundingsbana Fyrri
The First Lay of Helgi Hundingcide
1. It was in the times of yore, when the eagles screamed, holy waters fell from the heavenly hills; then to Helgi, the great of soul, Borghild gave birth in Brálund.
2. In the mansion it was night: the Norns came, who should the prince’s life determine. They him decreed a prince most famed to be, and of leaders accounted best.
3. With all their might they span the fatal threads, when that (he) burghs should overthrow1 in Brálund. They stretched out the golden cord, and beneath the middle of the moon’s mansion fixed it.
4. East and west they hid the ends, where the prince had lands between; towards the north Neri’s sister cast a chain, which she bade last for ever.
1. That is, when they came to spin that period of his destiny.



228
5. One thing disquieted the Ylfing’s offspring, and the woman who had the child brought forth. Sitting on a lofty tree, on prey intent, a raven to a raven said: “I know something.
6. Stands cased in mail Sigmund’s son, one day old: now is our day come. His eyes are piercing as a warrior’s; a wolf ’s friend is he: we shall rejoice!”
7. He to the folk appeared a noble chief to be; among men ‘twas said that happy times were come; went the king himself from the din of war, noble garlic to bring to the young prince;
8. Gave him the name of Helgi, and Hringstadir, Sólfiöll, Snæfiöll, and Sigarsvellir, Hringstäd, Hátún, and Himinvangar, a sword ornate, to Sinfiölti ́s brother.



229
9. Then grew up, in his friends’ bosom, the high-born youth, in joyous splendor. He paid and gave gold for deserts; nor spared the chief the blood-stained sword.
10. A short time only the leader let warfare cease. When the prince was fifteen winters old, he caused the fierce Hunding to fall, who long had ruled over lands and people.
11. The sons of Hunding afterwards demanded from Sigmund’s son treasure and rings; because they had on the prince to avenge their great loss of wealth, and their father’s death.
12. The prince would neither the blood-fine pay, nor for the slain indemnity would give. They might expect, he said, a terrific storm of grey arrows, and Odin’s ire.



230
13. The warriors went to the trysting place of swords, which they had appointed at Logafiöll. Broken was Frodi’s peace between the foes: Vidrir’s hounds went about the isle slaughter-greedy.
14. The leader sat under the Arastein, after he had slain Alf and Eyiólf, Hiörvard and Hávard, sons of Hunding: he had destroyed all Geirmimir’s race.
15. Then gleamed a ray from Logafiöll, and from that ray lightnings issued; then appeared, in the field of air, a helmed band of Valkyriur: their corslets were with blood besprinkled, and from their spears shone beams of light.
16. Forthwith inquired the chieftain bold, from the wolf-congress of the southern Dísir, whether they would, with the warriors, that night go home? then was a clash of arms!



231
17. One from her horse, Högni ́s daughter, stilled the crash of shields, and to the leader said: “We have, I ween, other objects than with princely warriors to drink beer.
18. My father has his daughter promised to the fierce son of Granmar; but I have, Helgi! Declared Hödbrodd, the proud prince, like to a cat’s son.
19. That chief will come in a few days, unless thou him call to a hostile meeting; or the maiden take from the prince.”
Helgi 20. Fear thou not Isung’s slayer; there shall be first a clash of foes, unless I am dead.
21. Thence sent messengers the potent prince through air and over water, succors to demand, and abundance of ocean’s gleam to men to offer, and to their sons.



232
22. “Bid them speedily to the ships to go, and those from Brandey to hold them ready.” There the king abode, until thither came warriors in hundreds from Hedinsey.
23. From the strands also, and from Stafnsnes, a naval force went out, with gold adorned. Helgi then of Hiörleif asked: “Hast thou mustered the valiant people?”
24. But the young king the other answered: “Slowly” said he “are counted from Trönuey the long-beaked ships, under the seafarers, which sail without in Öresund,
25. Twelve hundred faithful men; though in Hátún there is more than half of the king’s host We are to war inured.”
26. Then the steersman threw the ship’s tents aside, that the princes’ people might awake, and the noble chiefs the dawn might see; and the warriors hauled the sails up to the mast in Varinsfiörd.



233
27. There was a dash of oars, and clash of iron, shield against shield resounded; the vikings rowed; roaring went, under the chieftains the royal fleet far from the land.
28. So might be heard, when together came the tempest’s sister2 and the long keels, as when rock and surge on each other break.
29. Higher still bade Helgi the deep sail be hauled. No port gave shelter to the crews; when Ægir’s terrific daughter the chieftains’ vessels would o’erwhelm.
30. But from above Sigrún intrepid, saved them and their fleet also; from the hand of Rán powerfully was wrested the royal ship at Gnípalund.
31. At eve they halted in Unavágar; the splendid ships might into port have floated, but the crews, from Svarinshaug,
2. Kolgu Systir. Kolgat was one of the daugthers of Ægir and Ran; they were the waves.



234
in hostile mood, espied the host.
32. Then demanded the god-born Gudmund: “Who is the chieftain that commands the fleet, and that formidable force brings to our land?”
33. Sinfiötli said, slinging up on the yard a red-hued shield with golden rim; He at the strait kept watch, and able was to answer, and with nobles words exchanged
34. “Tell it at eve, when you feed your pigs, and your dogs lead to their food, that the Ylfings from the east are come, ready to fight at Gnípalund.
35. Hödbrodd will Helgi find in the fleet’s midst, a king hard to make flee, who has oft the eagles sated, while thou wast at the mills, kissing the thrall-wenches.



235
Gudmund 36. Little dost thou remember of ancient saws, when of the noble thou falsehoods utterest. Thou hast been eating wolves’ dainties, and of thy brother wast the slayer; wounds hast thou often sucked with cold mouth; every where loathed, thou hast crawled in caverns.
Sinfiötli 37. Thou was a Vala-crone in Varinsey, cunning as a fox, a spreader of lies. Thou saidst thou no man wouldst ever marry, no corsleted warrior, save Sinfiötli.
38. A mischievous crone was thou, a giantess, a Valkyria, insolent, onstrous, in Alfather’s hall. All the Einheriar fought with each other, deceitful woman! for thy sake. Nine wolves we begat in Sagunes; I alone was father of them all.



236
Gudmund 39. Father thou wast not of Fenriswolves, older than all, as far as I remember; since by Gnípalund, the Thurs-maidens thee emasculated upon Thorsnes.
40. Thou was Siggeir’s stepson, at home under the benches layest, accustomed to the wolf ’s howl out in the forests: calamity of every kind came over thee, when thou didst lacerate thy brother’s breast. Notorious thou mad’st thyself by thy atrocious works.
Sinfiötli 41. Thou was Grani’s bride at Brávöllr, hadst a golden bit, ready for the course. Many a time have I ridden thee tired, hungry and saddled, through the fells, thou hag!
Gudmund 42. A graceless lad thou wast thought to be, when Gulnir’s goats thou didst milk. Another time thou wast a giantess’s daughter, a tattered wretch. Wilt thou a longer chat?



237
Sinfiölti 43. I rather would at Frekastein the ravens cram with thy carcase, than thy dogs lead to their meat, or thy hogs feed. May the fiend deal with thee!
Helgi 44. “Much more seemly, Sinfiölti! would it be for you both in battle to engage, and the eagles gladden, than with useless words to contend, however princes3 may foster hate.
45. Not good to me appear Granmar’s sons, yet ‘tis right that princes should speak the truth: they have shown, at Móinsheimar, that they have courage to draw the sword.”
46. Rapidly they their horses made to run, Svipud and Svegiud, to Sólheimar, over dewy dales, dark mountain-sides; trembled the sea of mist, where the men went.
3. Literally ring-breakers, or –dispensers.



238
47. The king they met at the burgh’s gate, to the prince announced the hostile advent. Without stood Hödbrodd with helmet decked: he the speed noticed of his kinsmen. “Why have ye Hníflúngs such wrathful countenance?”
48. “Hither to the shore are come rapid keels, towering masts, and long yards, shields many, and smooth-shaven oars, a king’s noble host, joyous Ylfings.
49. Fifteen bands are come to land; but there are out at sea, before Gnípulund, seven thousand blue-black ocean-beasts with gold adorned; there is by far their greatest multitude. Now will Helgi not delay the conflict.”
Hödbrodd 50. “Let a bridled steed to the chief assembly run, but Sporvitnir to Sparinsheid; Melnir and Mylnir to Myrkvid; let no man stay behind of those who swords can brandish.



239
51. Summon to you Högni, and the sons of Hring, Atli and Yngvi, Alf the old; they will gladly engage in conflict. We will let the Völsungs find resistance.”
52. It was a whirlwind, when together came the fallow4 blades at Frekastein: ever was Helgi Hundingsbani foremost in the host, where men together fought: ardent for battle, disdaining flight; the chieftain had a valiant heart.
53. Then came a maid from heaven, helmed, from above the clash of arms increased for the king’s protection. Then said Sigrún well skilled to fly to the host of heroes from Hugin’s grove5
54. “Unscathed shalt thou, prince! possess thy people, pillar of Yngvi’s race! and life enjoy; thou hast laid low the slow of flight, the chief who caused the dread warrior’s death.
4. It would appear that their swords were of bronze.
5. Hugin’s grove. The raven’s grove, i.e., the battle-field, strewed with corpses, the raven’s food.



240
And thee, o king! well beseem both red-gold rings and a powerful maid: unscathed shalt thou, prince! both enjoy, Högni’s daughter, and Hringstadir, victory and lands: then is conflict ended.”



241
Helgakviða Hundingsbana Önnur
The Second Lay of Helgi Hundingcide
King Sigmund, son of Völsung, had to wife Borghild of Brálund. They named their son Helgi, after Helgi Hiörvard’s son. Helgi was fostered by Hagal. There was a powerful king named Hunding, after whom the land was called Hundland. He was a great warrior, and had many sons, who were engaged in warfare. There was enmity, both open and concealed, between King Hunding and King Sigmund, and they slew each others kinsmen. King Sigmund and his kindred were called Völsungs, and Ylfings. Helgi went forth and secretly explored the court of King Hunding. Heming, Hunding’s son, was at home. On departing Helgi met a herdsman, and said:
1. “Say thou to Heming, that Helgi bears in mind who the mailed warrior was, whom the men laid low, when the grey wolf ye had within, and King Hunding that it was Hamal.”
Hamal was the son of Hagal. King Hunding sent men to Hagal in search of Helgi, and Helgi had no other way to save himself than by taking the clothes of a female slave and going to grind. They sought but did not find him. Then said Blind the Baleful:
2. Sharp are the eyes of Hagal’s thrall-wench; of no churlish race is she who at the mill stands. The mill-stones are split, the receiver flies asunder. Now a hard fate has befallen the warrior, when a prince must barley grind: much more fitting to that hand is the falchion’s hilt than a mill-handle.



242
Hagal answered and said:
3. No wonder ‘tis that the receiver rattles, when a royal damsel the handle turns. She hovered hither than the clouds, and, like the vikings, dared to fight, until Helgi made her captive. She is a sister of Sigar and Högni; therefore has fierce eyes the Ylfing maid. **********************
Helgi escaped and went on board a ship of war. He slew King Hunding, and was afterwards named Helgi Hundingsbani. He lay with his force in Brunavágar, and carried on ‘strand-högg’1 and ate raw flesh. There was a king named Högni, whose daughter was Sigrún: she was a Valkyria, and rode through air and over the sea. She was Svava regenerated. Sigrún rode to Helgi, and said:
4. What men cause a ship along the coasts to float? where do ye warriors a home possess? what await ye in Brunavágar? whither desire ye to explore a way?
Helgi 5. Hamal causes a ship along the coasts to float; we have home in Hlésey; a fair wind we await in Brunavágar; eastward we desire to explore a way.
1. Slaughtering and carrying off the cattle on the sea-shore.



243
Sigrún 6. Were, o prince! hast thou wakened war, or fed the birds on conflict’s sisters?2 Why is thy corslet sprinkled with blood? Why beneath the helm eat ye raw flesh?
Helgi 7. It was the Ylfings’ son’s last achievement, if thou desirest to know west of the ocean, that I took bears in Bragalund, and the eagles’ race with our weapons sated. Now, maiden! I have said what the reasons were, why at sea we little cooked meat ate.
Sigrún 8. To a battle thou alludest. Before Helgi has King Hunding been doomed to fall. In conflict ye have engaged, when your kindred ye avenged, and stained with blood the falchion’s edge.
Helgi 9. Why dost thou suppose, sagacious maiden! that it was they, who their kin avenged? Many a warrior’s
2. The Valkyriur.



244
bold sons there are, and hostile to our kindred.
Sigrún 10. I was not far, leader of people! eager, at many a chieftain’s end: yet crafty I account Sigmund’s son, when in val-runes3 the slaughter he announces.
11. A while ago I saw thee commanding war-ships, when thou hadst station on the bloody prow, and the cold sea waves were playing. Now, prince! thou wilt from me conceal it, but Högni’s daughter recognizes thee. ****************************
Granmar was the name of a powerful prince who dwelt at Svarinshaug. He had many sons: one was called Hödbrodd, the second Gudmund, the third Starkadr. Hödbrodd was at the assembly of kings, and there betrothed himself to Sigrún, the daughter of Högni. But when she was informed of it, she rode with the Valkyriur through the air and over the sea in quest of Helgi. Helgi was at Logafiöll, warring against the sons of Hunding, where he slew Alf and Eyiólf, Hiörvard and Hervard. Being over-fatigued with the conflict, he was sitting under the Arastein, where Sigrún found him, and running to him, threw her arms round his neck, and, kissing him, told him her errand so as it is related in the first Völsungakviða.
12. Sigrún sought the joyous prince, Helgi’s hand she forthwith grasped, kissed and addressed the helm-decked king.
3. Dark words of deadly import.



245
13. Then was the chieftain’s mind to the lady turned. She declared that she had loved, with her whole heart, Sigmund’s son, before she had seen him.
14. “To Hödbrodd I was in th’ assembly betrothed, but I another prince would have: yet, chieftain! I foresee my kindred’s wrath: I have my father’s promise broken.”
15. Högni’s daughter spoke not at variance with her heart: she said that Helgi’s affection she must possess.
Helgi 16. Care thou not for Högni ́s wrath, nor for the evil mind of thy kin. Thou shalt, young maiden! live with me: of a good race thou art, as I perceive.
Helgi then collected a large fleet and proceeded to Frekastein, and at sea experienced a perilous storm. Lightnings came over them, and the flashes entered the ships. They saw that nine Valkyriur were riding in the air, and recognized Sigrún among them. The storm then abated and they reached land in safety. The sons of Granmar were sitting on a hill as the sips were sailing towards the land. Gudmund leapt on a horse, and rode to explore on the hill by the haven. The Völsungs then lowered their sails, and Gudmund spoke as it is before written in the Helgakvida:
“Who is the leader that commands the fleet, and an appalling host leads to our land?”



246
This said Gudmund, Granmar’s son.
17. Who is the warrior that commands the ships, and lets his golden banner wave o’er his prow? No peace seems to me in that ship’s front; it casts a warlike glow around the vikings.
Sinfiölti, Sigmund’s son, answered:
18. Here may Hödbrodd Helgi learn to know, the hard of fight, in the fleet’s midst: he the possession hold of thy race; he the fishes’ heritage has to him subjected.
Gudmund 19. Therefore ought we first, at Frekastein, to settle together, and decide our quarrels! Hödbrod! ‘tis time vengeance to take, if an inferior lot we long have borne.
Sinfiötli 20. Rather shalt thou, Gudmund! tend goats, and steep mountain-tops shalt climb, have in thy hand a hazel staff, that will better please thee than judgments of the sword.



247
Gudmund rode home with intelligence of the hostile arrangement; whereupon the sons of Granmar collected a host, and many kings came thither. Among them were Högni, the father of Sigrún, with his sons Bragi and Dag. There was a great battle, and all the sons of Högni, and all their chiefs were slain, except Dag, who obtained peace, and swore oaths to the Völsungs. Sigrún, going among the slain, found Hödbrodd at the point of death. She said:
23. Not will Sigrún of Sefafiöll, King Hödbrodd! sink in thy arms: thy life is departed. Oft the axe’s blade the head approaches of Granmar’s sons.
She then met Helgi, and was overjoyed. He said:
24. Not to thee, all-wise maiden! are all things granted, though, I say, in somewhat are the Norns to blame. This morn have fallen at Frekastein Bragi and Högni: I was their slayer.
25. But at Styrkleifar King Starkadr, and at Hlebiörg the son of Hrollaug. That prince I saw of all most fierce, whose trunk yet fought when the head was far.
26. On the earth lie the greater number of thy kinsmen, to corpses turned. Thou hast not fought the battle, yet ‘twas decreed, that thou, potent maiden! shouldst cause the strife.



248
Sigrún then wept. Helgi said:
27. Sigrún! console thyself; a Hild thou hast been to us. Kings cannot conquer fate: gladly would I have them living who are departed, if I might clasp thee to my breast.
Helgi obtained Sigrún, and they had sons. Helgi lived not to be old. Dag, the son of Högni, sacrificed to Odin, for vengeance for his father. Odin lent Dag his spear. Dag met with his relation Helgi in a place called Fiöturlund, and pierced him through with his spear. Helgi fell there, but Dag rode to the mountains and told Sigrún what had taken place.
28. Loath am I, sister! sad news to tell thee; for unwillingly I have my sister caused to weep. This morning fell, in Fiöturlund, the prince who was on earth the best, and on the necks of warriors stood.
Sigrún 29. Thee shall the oaths all gnaw, which to Helgi thou didst swear, the limped Leiptr’s water, and at the cold dank wave-washed rock.
30. May the ship not move forward, which under thee should move, although the wished-for wind behind thee blow. May the horse not run, which under thee should run, although from enemies thou hast to flee!



249
31. May the sword not bite which thou drawest, unless it sing round thy own head. Then would Helgi’s death be on thee avenged, if a wolf thou wert, out in the woods, of all good bereft, and every joy, have no sustenance, unless on corpses thou shouldst spring.
Dag 32. Sister! thou ravest, and hast lost thy wits, when on thy brother thou callest down such miseries. Odin alone is cause of all the evil; for between relatives he brought the runes of strife.
33. Thy brother offers thee rings of red gold, all Vadilsvé and Vigdalir: have half the land, thy grief to compensate, woman ring-adorned! thou and thy sons.
Sigrún 34. So happy I shall not sit at Sefafiöll, neither at morn nor night, as to feel joy in life, if o’er the people plays not the prince’s beam of light; if his war-steed runs not under the chieftain hither, to the gold bit accustomed; if in the king I cannot rejoice.



250
35. So had Helgi struck with fear all his foes and their kindred, as before the wolf the goats run frantic from the fell, of terror full.
36. So himself Helgi among warriors bore, as the towering ash is among thorns, or as the fawn, moistened with dew, that more proudly stalks than all the other beasts, and its horns glisten against the sky.
A mound was raised for Helgi; but when he came to Valhall, Odin offered him rule over all jointly with himself. Helgi said:
37. Thou, Hunding! shalt for every man a foot-bath get, and fire kindle; shalt bind the dogs, to the horses look, to the swine give wash, ere to sleep thou goest.
A female slave passing at evening by Helgi’s mound, saw him riding towards it with many men:
38. Is it a delusion which methinks I see, or the powers’ dissolution, that ye, dead men, ride, and your horses with spurs urge on, or to warriors is a home journey granted?



251
Helgi 39. ‘Tis no delusion which thou thinkst to see, nor of mankind the end, although thou seest us, although our horses we with spurs urge on, nor to warriors is a home-journey granted.
The slave went home and said to Sigrún:
40. Sigrún! go forth from Sefafiöll, if the people’s chief thou desirest to meet. The mound is opened, Helgi is come, his wounds still bleed; the prince prayed thee that thou wouldst still the trickling blood.
Sigrún entered the mound to Helgi and said:
41. Now am I as glad, at our meeting, as the voracious hawks of Odin, when they of slaughter know; of warm prey, or, dewy-feathered, see the peep of day.
42. I will kiss my lifeless king, ere thou thy bloody corslet layest aside. Thy hair is, Helgi! tumid with sweat of death; my prince is all bathed in slaughter-dew;



252
cold, clammy are the hands of Högni’s son. How shall I, prince! for this make thee amends?
Helgi 43. Thou art alone the cause,4 Sigrún of Sefafiöll! that Helgi is with sorrow’s dew suffused. Thou weepest, gold-adorned! cruel tears, sun-bright daughter of the south! ere to sleep thou goest; each one falls bloody on the prince’s breast, wet, cold, and piercing, with sorrow big.
44. We shall surely drink delicious draughts, though we have lost life and lands. No one shall a song of mourning sing, though on my breast he wounds behold. Now are women in the mound enclosed, daughters of kings, with us the dead.
4. The superstition commemorated in this strophe is, no doubt, the origin of some very beautiful ballads in
the later literature of Scandinavia and Germany referring to this superstition:
“When thou, my dear, art cheerful,
“And easy in thy mind,
“The coffin where I slumber
“Is all with roses lined.
“But oft as thou ‘rt in sorrow,
“And bow’d with grief so sore,
“Is all the while my coffin
“Brim full of blood and gore.”



253
Sigrún prepares a bed in the mound.
45. Here, Helgi! have I for thee a peaceful couch prepared, for the Ylfings’ son. On thy breast I will, chieftain! repose, as in my hero’s lifetime I was wont.
Helgi 46. Nothing I now declare unlooked for, at Sefafiöll late or early, since in a corpse’s arms thou sleepest, Högni’s fair daughter! in a mound, and thou art living, daughter of kings!
47. Time ‘tis for me to ride on the reddening ways: let the pale horse tread the aerial path. I towards the west must go over Vindhiálm’s bridge, ere Salgofnir awakens heroes.
Helgi and his attendants rode their way, but Sigrún and hers proceeded to their habitation. The following evening Sigrún ordered her serving-maid to hold watch at the mound; but at nightfall, when Sigrún came thither, she said:
48. Now would be come, if he to come intended, Sigmund’s son, from Odin’s halls. I think the hope lessens of the king’s coming,



254
since on the ash’s boughs the eagles sit, and all the folk to the dreams’ tryst are hastening.
Serving-maid 49. Be not so rash alone to go, daughter of heroes! to the house of draugs:5 more powerful are, in the night-season, all dead warriors, then in the light of day.
Sigrún’s life was shortened by grief and mourning. It was a belief in ancient times that men were regenerated, but that is now regarded as an old crone’s fancy. Helgi and Sigrún are said to have been regenerated. He was then called Helgi Haddingiaskadi, and she Kara Hálfdan’s daughter, as it is said in the Songs of Kara; and she also was a Valkyria.
5. Probably house of draffs; place of swine, swill, lees.



255
Sinfiötlalok: Sinfiötli’s End
Sigmund Völsung’s son was a king in Frankland. Sinfiötli was the eldest of his sons, the second was Helgi, the third Hámund. Borghild, Sigmund’s wife, had a brother named Gunnar; but Sinfiötli her step-son and Gunnar both courted one woman, on which account Sinfiötli slew Gunnar. When he came home, Borghild bade him go away, but Sigmund offered the blood-fine, which it was incumbent on her to accept. At the funeral feast Borghild presented the beer: she took a large horn full of poison, and offered it to Sinfiötli; who, when he looked into the horn, and saw that there was poison in it, said to Sigmund: “the drink ferments!” Sigmund took the horn and drank up the contents. It is said that Sigmund was so strong that no poison could hurt him, either outwardly or inwardly; but that all his sons could endure poison outwardly. Borghild bore another horn to Sinfiötli, and prayed him to drink, when all took place as before. Yet a third time she offered him the horn, using reproachful words on his refusing to drink. He said as before to Sigmund, but the latter answered: “Let is pass through thy lips, my son.” Sinfiötli drank and instantly died. Sigmund bore him a long way in his arms, and came to a long and narrow firth, where there was a little vessel and one man in it. He offered Sigmund to convey him over the firth; but when Sigmund had borne the corpse to the vessel, the boat was full-laden. The man then said that Sigmund should go before through the firth. He then pushed off his boat and instantly departed. King Sigmund sojourned long in Denmark, in Borghild’s kingdom, after having espoused her. He then went south to Frankland, to the kingdom he there possessed. There he married Hiördís, the daughter of Eylimi. Sigurd was their son. King Sigmund fell in a battle with the sons of Hunding. Hiördís was afterwards married to Alf, son of King Hiálprek, with whom Sigurd grew up in childhood. Sigmund and his sons exceeded all other men in strength, and stature, and courage, and all accomplishments, though Sigurd was foremost of all; and in old traditions he is mentioned as excelling all men, and as the most renowned of warlike kings.

257
SigurÞarkviða Fafnisbana Fyrsta eða Gripisspa
The First Lay of Sigurd Fafnicide or Gripir’s Prophecy
Gripir was the name of the son of Eylimi, the brother of Hiördis. He ruled over lands, and was of all men wisest and prescient of the future. Sigurd rode alone, and came to Gripir’s dwelling. Sigurd was of a distinguished figure. He found a man to address outside the hall, whose name was Geitir. Sigurd applied to him, and asked:
1. Who here inhabits, in these towers? what nation’s king do people name him?
Geitir Gripir is named the chief of men, he who rules a firm realm and people.
Sigurd 2. Is the wise king of the land at home? Will the chief with me come and converse? With him needs speech an unknown man: I desire speedily Gripir to see.
Geitir 3. The glad king will of Geitir ask, who the man is that demands speech of Gripir.



258
Sigurd Sigurd I am named, born of Sigmund, and Hiördis is the chieftain’s mother.
4. Then went Geitir, Gripir to inform: “Here is a man without, a stranger, come; of aspect he is most distinguished. He desires, king! with thee to speak.”
5. Goes from the hall the lord of men, and the stranger prince kindly greets: “Welcome, Sigurd! better had it been earlier; but do thou, Geitir! take charge of Grani.”
6. They began to talk, and much to tell, when the sagacious men together met. “Tell me, if thou knowest, my mother’s brother! how will Sigurd’s life fall out?”
Gripir 7. Thou wilt foremost be of men beneath the sun, exalted high above every king; liberal of gold, but of flight sparing, of aspect comely, and wise of words.



259
Sigurd 8. Say thou, sage king! more than I ask, thou wise one, to Sigurd, if thou thinkst to see it: what will first happen for my advancement, when from thy dwelling I shall have departed?
Gripir 9. First wilt thou, prince! avenge thy father, and for the wrongs of Eylimi wilt retaliate; thou wilt the cruel sons of Hunding boldly lay low; thou wilt have victory.
Sigurd 10. Say, noble king! kinsman mine! with all forethought, as we hold friendly converse; seest thou of Sigurd those bold achievements, that will highest soar under heaven’s regions?
Gripir 11. Thou alone wilt slay that glistening serpent, which greedy lies on Gnítaheid; thou shalt of both the slayer be, Regin and Fafnir. Gripir tells truly.



260
Sigurd 12. Riches will abound, if I so bring conflict among men, as thou for certain sayest. Apply thy mind, and at length say what will yet my life befall.
Gripir 13. Thou wilt find Fafnir’s lair, and thence wilt take splendid riches, with gold wilt load Grani’s back. Thou wilt to Giuki ride, the war-famed prince.
Sigurd 14. Yet must thou, prince! in friendly speech, foresighted king! more relate. I shall be Giuki’s guest, and I shall thence depart: what will next my life befall?
Gripir 15. A king’s daughter will on a mountain sleep, fair, in corslet cased, after Helgi’s death. Thou wilt strike with a keen sword, wilt the corslet sever with Fafnir’s bane.



261
Sigurd 16. The corslet is ript open, the maid begins to speak. When awakened from her sleep, on what will she chiefly with Sigurd converse hold, which to the prince’s benefit may tend?
Gripir 17. She to thee, powerful one! runes will teach, all those which men ought to know; and in every man’s tongue to speak, and medicines for healing. May good await thee, king!
Sigurd 18. Now that is past, the knowledge is acquired, and I am ready thence away to ride. Apply thy mind, and at length say what more will my life befall.
Gripir 19. Thou wilt find Heimir’s dwellings, and the glad guest wilt be of that great king. Vanished is, Sigurd! that which I foresaw; no further mayest thou Gripir question.



262
Sigurd 20. Now bring me grief the words thou speakest; for thou foreseest, king! much further; thou knowest of too great calamity to Sigurd; therefore thou, Gripir! wilt not utter it.
Gripir 21. Of thy life the early portion lay before me clearest to contemplate. I am not truly accounted sage, nor of the future prescient: that which I knew is gone.
Sigurd 22. No man I know on the earth’s surface, who greater prescience has than thou, Gripir! Thou mayest not conceal it, unhappy though it be, or if ill betide my life.
Gripir 23. Not with vices will thy life be sullied; let that, noble prince! in thy mind be borne; for while mankind exists, thy name, director of spear-storm! will be supreme.



263
Sigurd 24. The worst seems to me, that Sigurd is compelled from the king to part in such uncertainty. Show me the way all is decreed before great chieftain! if thou wilt, my mother’s brother!
Gripir 25. To Sigurd I will now openly tell, since the chieftain me thereto compels: thou wilt surely find that I lie not. A certain day is for thy death decreed.
Sigurd 26. I would not importune the mighty prince, but rather Gripir’s good counsel have. Now I fain would know, though grateful it may not be, what prospect Sigurd has lying before him.
Gripir 27. There is with Heimir a maiden fair of form, she is by men Brynhild named, daughter of Budli; but the dear king Heimir nurtures the hard-souled damsel.



264
Sigurd 28. What is it to me, although the maiden be of aspect fair? nurtured with Heimir? That thou, Gripir! must fully declare; for thou forseest my whole destiny.
Gripir 29. She will thee bereave of almost every joy, the fair-faced foster-child of Heimir. Thou wilt not sleep nor of affairs discourse, nor men regard; only this maiden thou wilt see.
Sigurd 30. What remedy for Sigurd will be applied; tell me that, Gripir! if it seem good to thee. Shall I obtain the damsel? with dowry purchase the lovely royal daughter?
Gripir 31. Ye will each swear unnumbered oaths, solemnly binding, but few will keep. Hast thou been Guiki’s guest one night, thou wilt have forgotten the fair ward of Heimir.



265
Sigurd 32. How is that, Gripir! explain it to me: seest thou such fickleness in the king’s mind, that with that maiden I shall my engagement break, whom with my whole heart I thought to love?
Gripir 33. Prince! thou wilt be snared in another’s wiles, thou wilt pay the penalty of Grimhild’s craft; the bright-haired maiden, her daughter, she to thee will offer. This snare for the king she lays.
Sigurd 34. Shall I then with Gunnar form relationship, and with Gudrun join in wedlock? Well wived then the king would be, if the pangs of perjury caused me no pain.
Gripir 35. Thee will Grimhild wholly beguile; she will implore thee Brynhild to demand for the hand of Gunnar, king of Goths: the journey thou wilt forthwith promise to the king’s mother.



266
Sigurd 36. Evils are at hand, I can that perceive; Sigurd’s wits will have wholly perished, if I shall demand, for another’s hand, a noble maiden whom I well love.
Gripir 37. All of you will swear mutual oaths, Gunnar, and Högni, and thou the third; and ye will forms exchange, when on the way ye are, Gunnar and thou: Gripir lies not.
Sigurd 38. To what end is that? why shall we exchange forms and manner, when on the way we are? Another fraud will surely follow this, altogether horrible. But say on, Gripir!
Gripir 39. Thou wilt have Gunnar’s semblance, and his manners, thy own eloquence, and great sagacity; there thou wilt betroth the high-minded ward of Heimir: no one can that prevent.



267
Sigurd 40. To me that seems worse, that among men I shall be a false traitor called, if such take place. I would not deception practise on a royal maid the most excellent I know.
Gripir 41. Thou wilt repose, leader of hosts! pure as the maiden, as she thy mother were; therefore exalted, lord of men! while the world endures thy name will be.
42. The nuptials will of both be solemnized, of Sigurd and of Gunnar, in Giuki’s halls; then will ye forms exchange, when ye home return; yet to himself will have each his own senses.
Sigurd 43. Will then Gunnar, chief among men, the noble woman wed? Tell me that, Gripir! although three nights by me the chieftain’s bride glad of heart has slept? The like has no example.



268
44. How for happiness shall hereafter be this affinity? Tell me that, Gripir! Will the alliance for Gunnar’s solace hereforth prove, or even for mine?
Gripir 45. Thou wilt the oaths remember, and must silence keep, and let Gudrun enjoy a happy union. Brynhild nathless will herself think an ill-married woman. She will wiles devise to avenge herself.
Sigurd 46. What atonement will that woman take, for the frauds we shall have practised on her? From me the maiden has oaths sworn, but never kept, and but little joy.
Gripir 47. She to Gunnar will plainly declare, that thou didst not well the oaths observe, when the noble king, Guiki’s heir, with his whole soul, in thee confided.



269
Sigurd 48. What will then follow? let me know that. Will that tale appear as true, or that the noble woman falsely accuses me, and herself also. Tell me that, Gripir!
Gripir 49. From spite towards thee, and from o’erwhelming grief, the powerful dame will not most wisely act. To the noble woman do thou no further harm, though thou the royal bride with guiles has circumvented.
Sigurd 50. Will the prudent Gunnar, Guthorm, and Högni, at her instigation, then proceed? Will Giuki’s sons on their relative redden their swords? Tell me further, Gripir!
Gripir 51. Then will Gudrun be furious at heart, when her brothers shall on thy death resolve. In nothing then will that wise woman take delight. Such is Grimhild’s work.



270
52. In this thou shalt find comfort, leader of hosts! This fortune is allotted to the hero’s life: a more renowned man on earth shall never be, under the sun’s abode, than thou wilt be accounted.
Sigurd 53. Now part we, now farewell! Fate may not be withstood. Now hast thou, Gripir! done as I prayed thee: thou wouldst have fain a happier end foretold me of my life’s days, hadst thou been able.



271
SigurÞarkviða Fafnisbana Önnur
The Second Lay of Sigurd Fafnicide
Sigurd went to Hiálprek's stud and chose himself a horse, which was afterwards named Grani. Regin, Hreidmar’s son, was then come to Hiálprek; he was the most skilful of men, and a dwarf in stature; he was wise, cruel, and versed in magic. Regin undertook the rearing and instruction of Sigurd, and bore him great affection. He informed Sigurd of his parentage, and how it befell that Odin, and Hoenir, and Loki came to Andvarafors (the waterfall of Andvari). In the fall there was an abundance of fish. There was a dwarf named Andvari, who had long lived in the fall in the likeness of a pike, and in which he supplied himself with food. "Our brother", continued Regin, "was named Otr, who often went in to the fall in the likeness of an otter. He had caught a salmon, and was sitting on the bank of the river with his eyes shut eating it, when Loki killed him with a stone. The Æsir thought themselves very lucky, and stripped off the otter’s skin. That same evening they sought entertainment with Hreidmar, and showed their prize. Thereupon we laid hands on them, and imposed on them, as the redemption of their lives, that they should fill the otter’s skin with gold, and cover it over with red gold. They thereupon sent Loki to procure gold. He went to Ran, and obtained her net, and thence proceeded to Andvarafors, and cast the net before a pike, which leapt into the net. Whereupon Loki said:
1. What fish is this, that in the river swims, and cannot from harm itself protect? Redeem thy life from Hel, and find me the water’s flame.1
The Pike 2. Andvari I am named, Oin was my father named; many a cataract have I passed. A luckless Norn in times of old decreed, that in the water I should wade.
Loki 3. Tell me, Andvari! if thou wilt enjoy
1. One of many periphrases for gold.



272
life in the halls of men, what retribution get the sons of mortals, if with foul words they assail each other.
Andvari 4. Cruel retribution get the sons of mortals, who in Vadgelmir wade: for the false words they have against other uttered, the punishments too long endure.
Loki viewed all the gold that Andvari owned; but when he had produced the gold, he retained a single ring, which Loki also took from him. The dwarf went into his stone and said:
5. That gold which the dwarf possessed, shall to two brothers be cause of death, and to eight princes, of dissension. From my wealth no one shall good derive.
The Æsir produced the gold to Hreidmar, and with it crammed the otter's skin full, and set it up on the feet. They then had to heap up the gold and cover it; but when that was done, Hreidmar, stepping forward, observed a whisker, and required it to be covered; whereupon Odin drew forth the ring Andvara-naut, and covered the hair. Loki said:
6. There is gold for thee, and thou hast a great redemption for my life. For thy son no blessing is decreed; of both it shall prove the bane.
Hreidmar 7. Gifts thou hast given, friendly gifts thou hast given not; with a kind heart thou hast not given. Of your lives ye should



273
have been deprived, had I foreknown that peril.
8. But that is worse, what I seem to know, a strife of kinsmen for a woman. Princes yet unborn I think them to be, for whose hate that gold is destined.
9. The red gold, I trust, I shall possess while I am living: of thy threats I entertain no fear; so take yourselves hence home.
Fafnir and Regin demanded of Hreidmar their share of the blood-fine for their slain brother Otr, which he refused, and Fafnir stabbed his father with a sword while sleeping. Hreidmar called out to his daughters:
10. Lyngheid and Lofnheid! Know my life is departing. To many things need compels.2
Lyngheid Few sisters will, although they lose a father, avenge a brother's crime.
11. Then bring forth a daughter, wolf-hearted fury! if by a chief thou have not a son. Get for the maid a spouse, in thy great need; then will her son thy wrong avenge.
Hreidmar then died, and Fafnir took all the gold. Regin then requested to have his share of the pat
2. To wit, to avenge my death on your brothers.



274
rimony, but met with a refusal from Fafnir. Regin thereupon sought counsel of his sister Lyngheid, how he might obtain the patrimony. She said:
12. Thou of thy brother shall mildly demand thy patrimony and a better spirit. It is not seemly, that with the sword thou shouldst demand thy property of Fafnir.
The foregoing is what Regin related to Sigurd. One day, when he came to Regin's dwelling, he was kindly received, and Regin said:
13. Hither is come the son of Sigmund to our hall, that man of energy: courage he has greater than I aged man: now of a conflict have I hope from the fierce wolf.3
14. I will nurture the bold-hearted prince: now Yngvi's kinsman is to us come; he will be a king under the sun most powerful; over all lands will his destinies resound.
Sigurd was thence forward constantly with Regin, who related to him how Fafnir lay on Gnítaheid in the likeness of a serpent. He had an "Ægis-helm"4 at which all living beings were terror-stricken. Regin forged a sword for Sigurd, that was named Gram, and was so sharp that immersing it in the Rhine, he let a piece of wool down the stream, when it clove the fleece asunder as water. With that sword Sigurd clove in two Regin's anvil. After that Regin instigated Sigurd to slay Fafnir. He said:
15. Loud will laugh Hunding's sons, they who Eylimi
3. Sigurd.
4. A terrific helm or headpiece.



275
of life deprived, if the prince is more desirous to seek red rings, than to avenge his father.
King Hiálprek collected a fleet to enable Sigurd to avenge his father. They encountered a great storm, and were driven past a certain promontory. A man was standing on the cliff who said:
16. Who ride yonder, on Rævil's horses, the towering billows, the roaring main: the sail-steeds are with sweat bedewed, the wave-coursers will not the wind withstand.
Regin 17. Here am I Sigurd in sea-trees; a fair wind is given us for death itself: higher than our prows the steep waves dash, the rolling horses plunge. Who is it that inquires?
Hnikar 18. They called me Hnikar, when I Hugin gladdened, young Völsung! and battles fought. Now thou mayest call me the ancient of the rock, Feng, or Fiölnir. I desire a passage.
They turn to the land, the old man goes on board, and the storm abates. Sigurd said:



276
19. Tell me, Hnikar! since thou knowest the omens both of gods and men, which omens are best if to fight 'tis needful at the swing of glaves?
Hnikar 20. Good omens there are many, if men but knew them, at the swing of glaves, a faithful fellowship, I think, is the dark raven's, with the sworded warrior.
21. The second is if, when thou art gone out, and about to depart, thou seest two renown-seeking men standing in the fore-court.
22. The third omen is, if wolves thou hearest howl under the ash-boughs, it will victory to the announce over helmed warriors, if thou seest them go before thee.
23. No man should fight against the moon's late-shining sister. They have victory, who can see keenly at the play of swords, or to form the wedge-array.



277
24. Most perilous it is, if with thy foot thou strikest, when thou to battle goest. Wily Dísir stand on either side of thee, and wish to see thee wounded.
25. Combed and washed let every brave man be, and at morning fed; for 'tis uncertain whither he at eve may come. 'Tis bad to succumb to fate.
Sigurd fought a great battle with Lýngvi, Hunding's son, and his brothers, in which Lýngvi and his three brothers fell. After the battle Regin said:
26. Now is the bloody eagle, with the trenchant blade, graven on the back of Sigmund's slayer. No son of king, who the earth reddens, and the raven gladdens, is more excellent.
Sigurd returned home to Hiálprek, when Regin instigated him to slay Fafnir.



278



279
Fafnismol
Sigurth and Regin went up to the Gnitaheith, and found there the track that Fafnir made when he crawled to water. Then Sigurth made a great trench across the path, and took his place therein. When Fafnir crawled from his gold, he blew out venom, and it ran down from above on Sigurth’s head. But when Fafnir crawled over the trench, then Sigurth thrust his sword into his body to the heart. Fafnir writhed and struck out with his head and tail. Sigurth leaped from the trench, and each looked at the other. Fafnir said:
1. “Youth, oh, youth! of whom then, youth, art thou born? Say whose son thou art, Who in Fafnir’s blood thy bright blade reddened, And struck thy sword to my heart.”
Sigurth concealed his name because it was believed in olden times that the word of a dying man might have great power if he cursed his foe by his name. He said:
2. “The Noble Hart my name, and I go A motherless man abroad; Father I had not, as others have, And lonely ever I live.”
Fafnir spake: 3. “If father thou hadst not, as others have, By what wonder wast thou born? (Though thy name on the day of my death thou hidest, Thou knowest now thou dost lie.)”
Sigurth spake: 4. “My race, methinks, is unknown to thee, And so am I myself; Sigurth my name, and Sigmund’s son, Who smote thee thus with the sword.”
Fafnir spake: 5. “Who drove thee on? why wert thou driven My life to make me lose? A father brave had the bright-eyed youth, For bold in boyhood thou art.”



280
Sigurth spake: 6. “My heart did drive me, my hand fulfilled, And my shining sword so sharp; Few are keen when old age comes, Who timid in boyhood be.”
Fafnir spake: 7. “If thou mightest grow thy friends among, One might see thee fiercely fight; But bound thou art, and in battle taken, And to fear are prisoners prone.”
Sigurth spake: 8. “Thou blamest me, Fafnir, that I see from afar The wealth that my father’s was; Not bound am I, though in battle taken, Thou has found that free I live.”
Fafnir spake: 9. “In all I say dost thou hatred see, Yet truth alone do I tell; The sounding gold, the glow-red wealth, And the rings thy bane shall be.”
Sigurth spake: 10. “Some one the hoard shall ever hold, Till the destined day shall come; For a time there is when every man Shall journey hence to Hel.”
Fafnir spake: 11. “The fate of the Norns before the headland Thou findest, and doom of a fool; In the water shalt drown if thou row ‘gainst the wind, All danger is near to death.”
Sigurth spake: 12. “Tell me then, Fafnir, for wise art famed, And much thou knowest now: Who are the Norns who are helpful in need, And the babe from the mother bring?”



281
Fafnir spake: 13. “Of many births the Norns must be, Nor one in race they were Some to gods, others to elves are kin, And Dvalin’s daughters some.”
Sigurth spake: 14. “Tell me then, Fafnir, for wise thou art famed, And much thou knowest now: How call they the isle where all the gods And Surt shall sword-sweat mingle?”
Fafnir spake: 15. “Oskopnir is it, where all the gods Shall seek the play of swords; Bilrost breaks when they cross the bridge, And the steeds shall swim the flood.
16. “The fear-helm I wore to afright mankind, While guarding my gold I lay; Mightier seemed I than any man, For a fiercer never I found.”
Sigurth spake: 17. “The fear-helm surely no man shields When he faces a valiant foe; Oft one finds, when the foe he meets, That he is not the bravest of all.”
Fafnir spake: 18. “Venom I breathed when bright I lay By the hoard my father had; (There was none so mighty as dared to meet me, And weapons nor wiles I feared.)”
Sigurth spake: 19. “Glittering worm, thy hissing was great, And hard didst show thy heart; But hatred more have the sons of men For him who owns the helm.”



282
Fafnir spake: 20. “I counsel thee, Sigurth, heed my speech, And ride thou homeward hence; The sounding gold, the glow-red wealth, And the rings thy bane shall be.” (V. “For it often happens that he who gets a deathly wound yet avenges himself.”)
Sigurth spake: 21. “Thy counsel is given, but go I shall To the gold in the heather hidden; And, Fafnir, thou with death dost fight, Lying where Hel shall have thee.”
Fafnir spake: 22. “Regin betrayed me, and thee will betray, Us both to death will he bring; His life, methinks, must Fafnir lose, For the mightier man wast thou.”
Regin had gone to a distance while Sigurth fought Fafnir, and came back while Sigurth was wiping the blood from his sword. Regin said:
23. “Hail to thee, Sigurth! Thou victory hast, And Fafnir in fight hast slain; Of all the men who tread the earth, Most fearless art thou, methinks.”
Sigurth spake: 24. “Unknown it is, when all are together, (The sons of the glorious gods,) Who bravest born shall seem; Some are valiant who redden no sword In the blood of a foeman’s breast.”
Regin spake: 25. “Glad art thou, Sigurth, of battle gained, As Gram with grass thou cleanest; My brother fierce in fight hast slain, And somewhat I did myself.”



283
Sigurth spake: 26. “Afar didst thou go while Fafnir reddened With his blood my blade so keen; With the might of the dragon my strength I matched, While thou in the heather didst hide.”
Regin spake: 27. “Longer wouldst thou in the heather have let Yon hoary giant hide, Had the weapon availed not that once I forged, The keen-edged blade thou didst bear.”
Sigurth spake: 28. “Better is heart than a mighty blade For him who shall fiercely fight; The brave man well shall fight and win, Though dull his blade may be.
29. “Brave men better than cowards be, When the clash of battle comes; And better the glad than the gloomy men Shall face what before him lies.
30. “Thy rede it was that I should ride Hither o’er mountains high; The glittering worm would have wealth and life If thou hadst not mocked at my might.”
Then Regin went up to Fafnir and cut out his heart with his sword, that was named Rithil, and then he drank blood from the wounds. Regin said:
31. “Sit now, Sigurth, for sleep will I, Hold Fafnir’s heart to the fire; For all his heart shall eaten be, Since deep of blood I have drunk.”
Sigurth took Fafnir’s heart and cooked it on a spit. When he thought that it was fully cooked, and the blood foamed out of the heart, then he tried it with his finger to see whether it was fully cooked. He burned his finger, and put it in his mouth. But when Fafnir’s heart’s-blood came on his tongue, he understood the speech of birds. He heard nut-hatches chattering in the thickets. A nut-hatch said:



284
32. “There sits Sigurth, sprinkled with blood, And Fafnir’s heart with fire he cooks; Wise were the breaker of rings, I ween, To eat the life-muscles all so bright.”
A second spake: 33. “There Regin lies, and plans he lays The youth to betray who trusts him well; Lying words with wiles will he speak, Till his brother the maker of mischief avenges.”
A third spake: 34. “Less by a head let the chatterer hoary Go from here to Hel; Then all of the wealth he alone can wield, The gold that Fafnir guarded.”
A forth spake: 35. “Wise would he seem if so he would heed The counsel good we sisters give; Thought he would give, and the ravens gladden, There is ever a wolf where his ears I spy.”
A fifth spake: 36. “Less wise must be the tree of battle Than to me would seem the leader of men, If forth he lets one brother fare, When he of the other the slayer is.”
A sixth spake: 37. “Most foolish he seems if he shall spare His foe, the bane of the folk; There Regin lies, who hath wronged him so, Yet falsehood knows he not.”
A seventh spake: 38. “Let the head from the frost-cold giant be hewed, And let him of rings be robbed; Then all the wealth which Fafnir’s was Shall belong to thee alone.”



285
Sigurth spake: 39. “Not so rich a fate shall Regin have As the tale of my death to tell; For soon the brothers both shall die, And hence to Hel shall go.”
Sigurth hewed off Regin’s head, and then he ate Fafnir’s heart, and drank the blood of both Regin and Fafnir. Then Sigurth heard what the nut-hatch said:
40. “Bind, Sigurth, the golden rings together, Not kingly is it aught to fear; I know a maid, there is none so fair, Rich in gold, if thou mightest get her.
41. “Green the paths that to Gjuki lead, And his fate the way to the wanderer shows; The doughty king a daughter has, That thou as a bride mayst, Sigurth, buy.”
42. Another spake: “A hall stands high on Hindarfjoll, All with flame is it ringed without; Warriors wise did make it once Out of the flaming light of the flood.1
43. “On the mountain sleeps a battle-maid, And about her plays the bane of the wood2; Ygg with the thorn hath smitten her thus, For she felled the fighter he fain would save.
44. “There mayst thou behold the maiden helmed, Who forth on Vingskornir rode from the fight; The victory-bringer her sleep shall break not, Thou heroes’ son3, so the Norns have set.”
Sigurth rode along Fafnir’s trail to his lair, and found it open. The gate-posts were of iron, and the gates; of iron, too, were all the beams in the house, which was dug down into the earth. There Sigurth found a mighty store of gold, and he filled two chests full thereof; he took the fear-helm and a golden mail-coat and the sword Hrotti, and many other precious things, and loaded Grani with them, but the horse would not go forward until Sigurth mounted on his back.

2. A periphrasis for fire.

Sigrdrífumál: The Lay of Sigrdrifa
Sigurd rode up the Hindarfiall, and directed his course southwards towards Frankland. In the fell he saw a great light, as if a fire were burning, which blazed up the sky. On approaching it, there stood a skialdborg, and over it a banner. Sigurd went into the skialdborg, and saw a warrior lying within it asleep, completely armed. He first took the helmet off the warrior’s head, and saw that it was a woman. Her corslet was a s fast as if it had grown to her body. With his sword Gram he ripped the corslet from the upper opening downwards, and then though both sleeves. He then took the corslet off from her, when she awoke, sat up and, on seeing Sigurd, said:
1. What has my corslet cut? why from sleep have I started? who hast cast from me the fallow bands?
Sigurd Sigmund’s son hast just now ript the raven’s perch,1 with Sigurd’s sword.
She 2. Long have I slept, long been with sleep oppressed, long are mortals’ sufferings! Odin is the cause that I have been unable to cast off torpor.
Sigurd sat down and asked her name. She then took a horn filled with mead, and gave him the minnis-cup.
She 3. Hail to Day! Hail to the sons of Day! To Night and her daughter hail! With placid eyes behold us here, and here sitting give us victory.
1. The original words, hrafns hrælundir, the raven’s corpse-trees. So Grimm understands the line; because
that bird hops about upon the armour as upon a tree.



288
4. Hail to the Æsir! Hail to the Asyniur! Hail to the bounteous earth! Words and wisdom give to us noble twain, and healing hands2 while we live.
She was named Sigrdrífa, and was a Valkyria. She said that two kings had made war on each other, one of whom was named Hiálmgunnar; he was old and a great warrior, and Odin had promised him victory. The other was Agnar, a brother of Höda, whom no divinity would patronize. Sigrdrífa overcame Hiálmgunnar in battle; in revenge for which Odin pricked her with a sleep-thorn, and declared that thenceforth she should never have victory in battle, and should be given in marriage. “But I said to him, that I had bound myself by a vow not to espouse any man who could be made to fear.” Sigurd answers, and implores her to teach him wisdom, as she had intelligence from all regions: Sigrdrifa 5. Beer I bear to thee, column3 of battle! with might mingled, and with bright glory: ‘tis full of song, and salutary saws, of potent incantations, and joyous discourses.
6. Sig-runes thou must know, if victory (sigr) thou wilt have, and on thy sword’s hilt grave them; some on the chapes, some on the guard, and twice the name of Tý.
7. Öl- (beer-) runes thou must know, if thou wilt not that another’s wife, thy trust betray, if thou in her confide. On the horn must they be graven, and on the hand’s back, and Naud4 on the nail be scored.
2. The superstition of the healing hand is not yet extinct in Iceland. Dr. Maurer relates a story of a man in
Reykjavik to whom it would seem to have been communicated by an elfin, in a dream.
3. Literally apple-tree.
4. The name of a rune.



289
8. A cup must be blessed, and against peril guarded, and garlick in the liquor cast: then I know thou wilt never have mead with treachery mingled.
9. Biarg- (help-) runes thou must know, if thou wilt help, and loose the child from women. In the palm they must be graven, and round the joints be clasped, and the Dísir prayed for aid.
10. Brim- (sea-) runes thou must know, if thou wilt have secure afloat thy sailing steeds. On the prow they must be graven, and on the helm-blade, and with fire to the oar applied. No surge shall be so towering, nor waves so dark, but from the ocean thou safe shalt come.
11. Lim- (branch-) runes thou must know, if thou a leech wouldst be, and wounds know how to heal. On the bark they must be graven, and on the leaves of trees, of those whose boughs bend eastward.
12. Mál- (speech-) runes thou must know, if thou wilt that no one for injury with hate requite thee. Those thou must wind, those thou must wrap round, those thou must altogether place in the assembly, where people have into full court to go.



290
13. Hug- (thought-) runes thou must know, if thou a wiser man wilt be than every other. Those interpreted, those graved, those devised Hropt, from the fluid, which had leaked from Heiddraupnir’s head, and from Hoddropnir’s horn.
14. On a rock he stood, with edged sword, a helm on his head he bore. Then spake Mim’s head its first wise word, and true saying uttered.
15. They are, it said, on the shield graven, which stands before the shining god, or Arvakr’s ear, and on Alsvid’s hoof, on the wheel which rolls under Rögnir’s ear, on Sleipnir’s teeth, and on the sledge’s bands.
16. On the bear’s paw, and on Bragi’s tongue, on the wolf ’s claws, and the eagle’s beak, on bloody wings, and on the bridge’s end, on the releasing hand, and on the healing’s track.



291
17. On glass and on gold, on amulets of men, in wine and in wort, and in the welcome seat, on Gúngnir’s point, and on Grani’s breast, on the Norn’s nail, and the owl’s neb.
18. All were erased that were inscribed, and mingled with the sacred mead, and sent on distant ways: they are with the Æsir, they are with the Alfar, some with the wise Vanir, some human beings have.
19. Those are bók-runes, those are biarg-runes, and all öl- (beer-) runes, and precious megin- (power-) runes, for those who can, without confusion or corruption, turn them to his welfare. Use, if thou hast understood them, until the powers perish.
20. Now thou shalt choose, since a choice is offered thee, keen armed warrior! my speech, or silence: think over it in thy mind. All evils5 have their measure.
5. An allusion to Sigurd’s unhappy end.



292
Sigurd 21. I will not flee, though thou shouldst know me doomed. I am not born a craven. Thy friendly counsels all I will receive, as long as life is in me.
Sigrdrifa 22. This I thee counsel first: that towards thy kin thou bear thee blameless. Take not hasty vengeance, although they raise up strife: that, it is said, benefits the dead.
23. This I thee counsel secondly: that no oath thou swear, if it be not true. Cruel bonds follow broken faith: accursed is the faith-breaker.
24. This I thee counsel thirdly: that in the assembly thou contend not with a fool; for an unwise man oft utters words worse than he knows of.
25. All is vain, if thou holdest silence; then wilt thou seem a craven born, or else truly accursed. Doubtful is a servant’s testimony, unless a good one thou gettest. On the next day let his life go forth, and so men’s lies reward.



293
26. This I counsel thee fourthly: if a wicked sorceress dwells by the way, to go on is better than there to lodge, though night may overtake thee.
27. Of searching eyes the sons of men have need, when fiercely they have to fight: oft pernicious women by the way-side sit, who swords and valour deaden.
28. This I thee counsel fifthly: although thou see fair women on the benches sitting, let not their kindred’s silver over thy sleep have power. To kiss thee entice no woman.
29. This I thee counsel sixthy: although among men pass offensive tipsy talk, never while drunken quarrel with men of war: wine steals the wits of many.
30. Brawls and drink to many men have been a heart-felt sorrow; to some their death, to some calamity: many are the griefs of men!



294
31. This I thee counsel seventhly: if thou hast disputes with a daring man, better it is for men to fight than to be burnt within their dwelling.
32. This I thee counsel eighthly: that thou guard thee against evil, and eschew deceit. Entice no maiden, nor wife of man, nor to wantoness incite.
33. This is thee counsel ninthly: that thou corpses bury, wherever on the earth thou findest them, whether from sickness they have died, or from the sea, or are from weapons dead.
34. Let a mound be raised for those departed; let their hands and head be washed, combed, and wiped dry, ere in the coffin they are laid: and pray for their happy sleep.
35. This I thee counsel tenthly: that thou never trust a foe’s kinsman’s promises, whose brother thou hast slain, or sire laid low: there is a wolf in a young son, though he with gold be gladdened.
36. Strifes and fierce enmities think not to be lulled, no more than deadly injury. Wisdom and fame in arms a prince not easily acquires, who shall of men be foremost.

37. This I counsel thee eleventhly: that thou at evil look, what course it may take. A long life, it seems to me the prince may (not) enjoy; fierce disputes will arise.
Sigurd said: “A wiser mortal exists not, and I swear that I will possess thee, for thou art after my heart.” She answered: “Thee I will have before all others, though I have to choose among all men.” And this they confirmed with oaths to each other.

Fragments of the Lays of Sigurd and Brynhild
Sigurd then rides away from Hindarfiall, and journeys on till he comes to the habitation of Heimir, who was married to Beckhild, Brynhild’s sister. Alsvid, Heimir’s son, who was at play when Sigurd arrived at the mansion, received him kindly, and requested him to stay with him. Sigurd consented, and remained there a short time. Brynhild was at that time with Heimir, and was weaving within a gold border the great exploits of Sigurd. One day, when Sigurd was come from the forest, his hawk flew to the window at which Brynhild sat employed on weaving. Sigurd ran after it, saw the lady, and appeared struck with her handiwork and beauty. On the following day Sigurd went to her apartment, and Alsvid stood outside the door shafting arrows. Sigurd said: “Hail to thee, lady!” or “How fares it with thee?” She answered: “We are well, my kindred and friends are living, but it is uncertain what any one’s lot may be till their last day.” He sat down by her. Brynhild said: “This seat will be allowed to few, unless my father comes.” Sigurd answered: “Now is that come to pass which thou didst promise me.” She said: “Here shalt thou be welcome.” She then arose, and her four maidens with her, and, approaching him with a golden cup, bade him drink. He reached towards her and took hold of her hand together with the cup, and place her by him, clasped her round the neck, kissed her, and said: “A fairer than thou was never born.” She said: “it is not wise to place faith in women, for they so often break their promise.” He said: “Better days will come upon us, so that we may enjoy happiness.” Brynhild said: “It is not ordained that we shall live together, for I am a shield-maiden (skjaldmær).” Sigurd said: “Then will our happiness be best promoted, if we live together; for harder to endure is the pain which herein lies than from a keen weapon.” Brynhild said: “I shall be called to the aid of warriors, but thou wilt espouse Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter.” Sigurd said: “No king’s daughter shall ensnare me, therefore have not two thoughts on that subject; and I swear by the gods that I will possess thee and no other woman.” She answered to the same effect. Sigurd thanked her for what she had said to him, and gave her a gold ring. He remained there a short time in great favour. Sigurd now rode to Heimir’s dwelling with much gold, until he came to the palace of King Giuki, whose wife was named Grimhild. They had three sons, Gunnar, Högni, and Guthorm. Gudrún was the name of their daughter. King Giuki entreated Sigurd to stay there, and there he remained a while. All appeared low by the side of Sigurd. One evening the sorceress Grimhild rose and presented a horn to Sigurd, saying: “Joyful for us is thy presence, and we desire that all good may befall thee. Take this horn and drink.” He took it and drank, and with that drink forgot both his love and his vows to Brynhild. After that, Grimhild so fascinated him that he was induced to espouse Gudrún, and all pledged their faith to Sigurd, and confirmed it by oaths. Sigurd gave Gudrún to eat of Fafnir’s heart, and she became afterwards far more austere then before. Their son was named Sigmund.
These fragments from the Volsunga-Saga, which are inserted in some paper manuscripts of the Edda, and
containing matter probably derived from the lost poems relative to Sigurd and Brynhild, are printed in the
Stockholm edition of the Edda. they are also given by Afzelius in his Swedish version, and partially in Danish
by Finn Magnusen in his edition. A complete translation into Danish of the entire Saga has since been given
by Prof. Rafn at Copenhagen.



298
Grimhild now counseled her son Gunnar to woo Brynhild, and consulted with Sigurd, in consequence of this design. Brynhild had vowed to wed that man only who should ride over the blazing fire that was laid around her hall. They found the hall and the fire burning around it. Gunnar rode Goti, and Högni Hölknir. Gunnar turns his horse towards the fire but it shrinks back. Sigurd said “Why dost thou shrink back, Gunnar?” Gunnar answers: “My horse will not leap this fire,” and prays Sigurd to lend him Grani. “He is at thy service,” said Sigurd. Gunnar now rides again towards the fire, but Grani will not go over. They then changed forms. Sigurd rides, having in his hand the sword Gram, and golden spurs on his heels. Grani runs forward to the fire when he feels the spur. There was now a great noise, at it is said:
1. The fire began to rage, and the earth to tremble, high rose the flame to heaven itself: there ventured few chiefs of people through that fire to ride, or to leap over.
2. Sigurd Grani with his sword urged, the fire was quenched before the prince, the flame allayed before the glory-seeker with the bright saddle that Rök owned.
Brynhild was sitting in a chair as Sigurd entered. She asks who he is, and he calls himself Gunnar Giuki’s son. “And thou art destined to be my wife with my father’s consent. I have ridden through the flickering flame (vafrlogi) at they requisition.” She said: “I know not well how I shall answer this.” Sigurd stood erect on the floor resting on the hilt of his sword. She rose embarrassed from her seat, like a swan on the waves, having a sword in her hand, a helmet on her head, and wearing a corslet. “Gunnar,” said she, “speak not so to me, unless thou art the foremost of men; and then thou must slay him who has sought me, if thou hast so much trust in thyself.” Sigurd said: “Remember now thy promise, that thou wouldst go with that man who should ride through the flickering flame.” She acknowledged the truth of his words, stood up, and gave him a glad welcome. He tarried there three nights, and they prepared one bed. He took the sword Gram and laid it between them. She inquired why he did so. He said that it was enjoined him so to act towards his bride on their marriage, or he would receive his death. He then took from her the ring called Andvaranaut, and gave her another that had belonged to Fafnir. After this he rode away through the same fire to his companions, when Gunnar and he again changed forms, and they then rode home.



299
Brynhild related this in confidence to her foster-father Heimir, and said: “A king named Gunnar has ridden through the flickering flame, and is come to speak with me; but I told him that Sigurd alone might so do, to whom I gave my vow at Hindarfiall, and that he only was the man.” Heimir said that what had happened must remain as it was. Brynhild said: “Our daughter Aslaug thou shalt rear up here with thee.” Brynhild then went to her father, King Budli, and he with his daughter Brynhild went to King Giuki’s palace. A great feasting was afterwards held, when Sigurd remembered all his oaths to Brynhild, and yet kept silence. Brynhild and Gunnar sat at the drinking and drank wine. One day Brynhild and Gudrún went to the river Rhine, and Brynhild went farther out into the water. Gudrún asked why she did so? Brynhild answered: “Why shall I go on along with thee in this more than in anything else?” “I presume that my father was more potent than thine, and my husband has performed more valorous deeds, and ridden through the blazing fire. They husband was King Hiálprek’s thrall.” Gudrún answered angrily: “Thou shouldst be wiser than to venture to vilify my husband, as it is the talk of all that no one like to him in every respect has ever come into the world; nor does it become thee to vilify him, as he was thy former husband, and slew Fafnir, and rode through the fire, whom though thoughtest was King Gunnar; and he lay with thee, and took from thee the ring Andvaranaut, and here mayest thou recognize it.” Brynhild then looking at the ring, recognized it, and turned pale as though she were dead. Brynhild was very taciturn that evening, and Gudrún asked Sigurd why Brynhild was so taciturn. He dissuaded her much from making this inquiry, and said that at all events it would soon be known. On the morrow, when sitting in their apartment, Gudrún said: “Be cheerful, Brynhild! What is it that prevents thy mirth?” Brynhild answered: “Malice drives thee to this; for thou hast a cruel heart.” “Judge not so,” said Gudrún. Brynhild continued: “Ask about that only which is better for thee to know; that is more befitting women of high degree. It is good, too, for thee to be content, as all goes according to thy wishes.” Gudrún said: “It is premature to glory in that: this forebodes something; but what instigates thee against us?” Brynhild answered: “Thou shalt be requited for having espoused Sigurd; for I grudge thee the possession of him.” Gudrún said: “We knew not of your secret.” Brynhild answered: “We have had no secret, though we have sworn oaths of fidelity; and thou knowest that I have been deceived, and I will avenge it.” Gudrún said: “Thou art better married than thou deservest to be, and thy violence must be cooled.” “Content should I be,” said Brynhild, “didst thou not posses a more renowned husband than I.” Gudrún answered: “Thou hast as renowned a husband; for it is doubtful which is the greater king.” Brynhild said: “Sigurd overcame Fafnir, and that is worth more than all Gunnar’s kingdom, as it is said:
“Sigurd the serpent slew, and that henceforth shall be by none forgotten, while mankind lives: but thy brother neither dared through the fire to ride, nor over it to leap.”



300
Gudrún said: “Grani would not run through the fire under King Gunnar: but he (Gunnar) dared to ride.” Brynhild said: “Let us not contend: I bear no good will to Grimhild.” Gudrún said: “Blame her not; for she is towards thee as to her own daughter.” Brynhild said: “She is the cause of all the evil which gnaws me. She presented to Sigurd the pernicious drink, so that he no more remembrest me.” Gudrún said: “Many an unjust word thou utterest, and this is a great falsehood.” Brynhild said: “So enjoy Sigurd as thou hast not deceived me, and may it go with thee as I imagine.” Gudrún said: “Better shall I enjoy him than thou wilt wish; and no one has said he has had too much good with me at any time.” Brynhild said: “Thou sayest ill and will repent of it. Let us cease from angry words, and not indulge in useless prattle. Long have I borne in silence the grief that dwells in my breast: I have also felt regard for thy brother. But let us talk of other things.” Gudrún said: “Your imagination looks far forward.” Brynhild then lay in bed, and King Gunnar came to talk with her, and begged her to rise and give vent to her sorrow; but she would not listen to him. They then brought Sigurd to visit her and learn whether her grief might not be alleviated. They called to memory their oaths, and how they had been deceived, and at length Sigurd offered to marry her and put away Gudrún; but she would not hear of it. Sigurd left the apartment, but was so greatly affected by her sorrow that the rings of his corslet burst asunder from his sides, as is said in the Sigurðarkviða:
“Out went Sigurd from that interview into the hall of kings, writhing in anguish; so that began to start the ardent warrior’s iron-woven sark off from his sides.”
Brynhild afterwards instigated Gunnar to murder Sigurd, saying that he had deceived them both and broken his oath. Gunnar consulted with Högni, and revealed to him this conversation. Högni earnestly strove to dissuade him from such a deed, on account of their oaths. Gunnar removed the difficulty, saying: “Let us instigate our brother Guthorm; he is young and of little judgement, and is, moreover, free of all oaths; and so avenge the mortal injury of his having seduced Brynhild.” They then took a serpent and the flesh of a wolf, and had them cooked, and gave them to him to eat, and offered him gold and a large realm, to do the deed, as is said:
“The forest-fish they roasted, and the wolf ’s carcase took, while some to Guthorm dealt out gold; gave him Geri’s2 flesh
2. The name of one of Odin’s wolves; here used poeitically for wolf in general.



301
with his drink, and many other things steeped therein.”
With this food he became so furious, that he would instantly perpetrate the deed. On this it is related as in the Sigurðarkviða, when Gunnar and Brynhild conversed together.



302



303
SigurÞarkviða Fafnisbana Þriðja
The Third Lay of Sigurd Fafnicide
1. It was of old that Sigurd, the young Völsung, Giuki sought, after his conflict, received the pledge of friendship from the two brothers; oaths exchanged the bold of deed.
2. A maid they offered him, and treasures many, Gudrún, Giuki’s youthful daughter. Drank and conversed, many days together, Sigurd the young and Giuki’s sons.
3. Until they went to woo Brynhild, and with them Sigurd, the youthful Völsung, rode in company, who knew the way. He would have possessed her, if her possess he might.
4. Sigurd the southern laid a naked sword, a glittering falchion, between them; nor the damsel did he kiss, nor did the Hunnish king to his arm lift her. He the blooming maid to Giuki’s son delivered.



304
5. She to herself a body was of no sin conscious, nor at her death-day, of any crime, that could be a stain, or thought to be: intervened therein the grisly fates.
6. Alone she sat without, at eve of day, began aloud with herself to speak: “Sigurd must be mine; I must die, or that blooming youth clasp in my arms.”
7. “Of the words I have uttered I now repent; he is Gudrún’s consort, and I am Gunnar’s. The hateful Norns long suffering have decreed us.”
8. Oftentimes she wandered, filled with evil thoughts, o’er ice and icebergs, every eve, when he and Gudrún had to their couch withdrawn and Sigurd her in the coverings wrapt, the Hunnish king his wife caressed.
9. “Devoid I go of spouse and pleasure; I will beguile myself with vengeful thoughts.”



305
10. By those fits of fury she was impelled to murder. “Thou, Gunnar! shalt wholly lose my land, and myself also. Never shall I be happy, king! with thee.
11. I will return thither from whence I came, to my near kindred, my relations; there will I remain, and slumber life away, cause to be slain, and a king become than the other greater.
12. Let the son go together with the father, the young wolf may not longer be fostered. For whom will vengeance be the easier to appease, if the son lives?”
13. Wroth was Gunnar, and with grief borne down; in his mind revolved, sat the whole day; he knew not well, nor could devise, what were most desirable for him to do, or were most fitting to be done, when he should find himself of the Völsung bereft, and in Sigurd a great loss sustain.



306
14. Much he thought, and also long, that it did not often happen, that from their royal state women withdrew. Högni he then to counsel summoned, in whom he placed the fullest trust.
15. “Of all to me Brynhild, Budli’s daughter is the dearest; she is the chief of women: rather will I my life lay down than that fair one’s treasures lose.
16. “With thou the prince for his wealth circumvent? good ‘tis to command the ore of Rhine, and at ease over riches rule, and in tranquillity happiness enjoy.”
17. This alone Högni for answer gave: “It beseems us not so to do, by the sword to break sworn oaths, oaths sworn, and plighted faith.



307
18. “We know not on earth men more fortunate, while we four over the people rule, and the Hun lives, that warlike chief; nor on earth, a race more excellent, if we five sons long shall foster, and the good progeny can increase.”
19. I know full well whence the causes spring: Brynhild’s importunity is over-great.
20. We will Guthorm, our younger brother, and not over-wise, for the deed prepare: he is free from sworn oaths, sworn oaths, and plighted faith.”
21. Easy it was to instigate the ferocious spirit: in the heart of Sigurd stood his sword.
22. On vengeance bent, the warrior in his chamber hurled his brand after the fierce assassin; to Guthorm flew dartlike Gram’s gleaming steel from the king’s hand.



308
23. Fell the murderer in two parts, arms and head flew far away, but his feet’s part fell backwards on the place.
24. Sunk in sleep was Gudrún, in her bed, void of cares, by Sigurd’s side: but she awoke of joys bereft, when in the blood of Frey’s friend she swam.
25. So violently struck she her hands together, that the stout of heart rose in his bed. “Weep not, Gudrún! so cruelly, my blooming bride! thy brothers live.
26. An heir I have, alas! too young; he cannot flee from the hostile house; among themselves they recently have dark and evil counsels devised.
27. Never henceforth, although seven thou bear, will such a son to the trysting with them ride. Full well I know how this has befallen: Brynhild the sole cause is of all the evil.



309
28. Me the maiden loved more than any man; but towards Gunnar I sinned not; affinity I held sacred, and sworn oaths; thenceforward I was called his consort’s friend.”
29. The woman gave forth sighs, and the king his life. So violently she struck her hands together, that the beakers on the wall responsive rang, and in the court the geese loudly screamed.
30. Laughed then Brynhild, Budli’s daughter, once only, from her whole soul, when in her bed she listened to the loud lament of Giuki’s daughter.
31. Then said Gunnar, the hawk-bearing prince: “Laugh not thereat, thou barbarous woman! glad on thy couch, as if good awaited thee. Why hast thou lost that beauteous colour? authoress of crime! Methinks to death thou art doomed.



310
32. Well doest thou deserve, above all women, that before thy eyes, we should lay Atli low, that thou shouldst see thy brother’s blood-streaming sore, his gory wounds shouldst have to bind.”
33. Then said Brynhild, Budli’s daughter: “No one provokes thee, Gunnar! complete is thy work of death. Little does Atli thy hatred fear; his life will outlast thine, and his might be ever greater.
34. Gunnar! I will tell thee, though thou well knowest it, how early ye resolved on crimes. I was o’er-young and unrestrained, with wealth endowed, in my brother’s house.
35. Nor did I desire to marry any man, before ye Giukungs rode to our dwelling, three on horseback, powerful kings: would that journey had never been!



311
36. Then myself I promised to the great king, who with gold sat on Grani’s back. In eyes he did not you resemble, nor was at all in aspect like: yet ye thought yourselves mighty kings.
37. And to me apart Atli said, that he would not have our heritage divided, nor gold nor lands, unless I let myself be married, nor grant me any part of the acquired gold, which he to me a girl had given to possess, and to me a child in money counted.
38. Then distracted was my mind thereon, whether I should engage in conflict, and death dispense, valiant in arms, for my brother’s quarrel. That would then be world-widely known, and to many a one bring heartfelt anguish.



312
39. Our reconciliation we let follow: to me it had been more pleasing the treasures to accept, the red-gold rings of Sigmund’s son: nor did I another’s gold desire; him alone I loved, none other. Menskögul1 had not a changing mind.
40. All this will Atli hereafter find, when he shall hear of my funeral rites completed; for never shall the heavy-hearted woman with another’s husband pass her life. Then will my wrongs be all avenged.”
41. Up rose Gunnar, prince of warriors, and round his consort’s neck laid his hands; all drew nigh, yet each one singly, through honest feeling, to dissuade her.
42. She from her neck those about her cast; she let no one stay her from her long journey.
1. That is, Skogul with the necklace; Brynhild applies this name to herself, which is a compound of men,
necklace, monile, and Skogul, the name of a Valkyria.



313
43. He then called Högni to consultation. “I will that all our folk to the hall be summoned, thine with mine now ‘tis most needful to see if we can hinder my consort’s fatal course, till from our speech a hindrance may come: then let us leave necessity to rule.”
44. To him Högni answer gave: “Let no one hinder her from the long journey, whence may she never born again return. Unblest she came on her mother’s lap, born in the world for ceaseless misery, for many a man’s heart-felt sorrow.”
45. Downcast he from the meeting turned to where the lady treasures distributed. She was viewing all she owned: hungry female thralls and chamber-women. She put on her golden corslet no good meditated ere herself she pierced, with the sword’s point.



314
46. On the pillow she turned to the other side, and, wounded with the glave, on her last counsels thought.
47. “Now let come those who desire gold, and aught less precious, to receive from me. To every one I give a gilded necklace,2 needle-work and coverlets, splendid weeds.”
48. All were silent, thought on what to do, and all together answer gave: “Too many are there dead: we will yet live, still be hungry hall-servants, to do what fitting is.”
49. At length after reflection, the lady linen-clad, young in years, words in answer uttered: “I desire that none, dead to entreaty, should by force, for our sake, lose their life.
50. Yet o’er your bones will burn fewer ornaments, Menia’s good meal,3 when ye go hence me to seek.
2. Necklaces usually consisted in gold and silver chains or laces with ornaments attached to them; if these
resembled the sun or moon they were called Sigli, suns (such were those here spoken of); and such was the
necklace worn by Freyja, the bright goddess of the Vanir.
3. Menia’s meal, or flour, is gold.



315
51. Gunnar! sit down, I will tell to thee, that of life now hopeless is thy bright consort. Thy vessel will not be always afloat, though I shall have my life resigned.
52. With Gudrún thou wilt be reconciled, sooner than thou thinkest: that wise woman has by the king sad memorials, after her consort’s death.
53. There is born a maid, which her mother rears; brighter far than the clear day, than the sun’s beam, will Svanhild be.
54. Gudrún thou wilt give to an illustrious one, a warrior, the bane of many men: not to her wish will she be married; Atli will come her to espouse, Budli’s son, my brother.
55. Much have I in memory how I was treated, when ye me so cruelly had deceived: robbed I was of happiness, while my life lasted.



316
56. Thou will desire Oddrún to possess, but Atli will permit it not; in secret ye will each other meet. She will love thee, as I had done, if us a better fate had been allotted.
57. Thee will Atli barbarously treat; in the narrow serpent-den wilt thou be cast.
58. It will too come to pass, not long after, that Atli will his soul resign, his prosperity, and cease to live; for Gudrún in her vengeance him in his bed will slay, through bitterness of spirit, with the sword’s sharp edge.
59. More seemly would appear our sister Gudrún, had she in death her first consort followed, had but good counsel been to her given, or she a soul possessed resembling mine,
60. Faintly now I speak but for our sake she will not lose her life. She will be borne on towering billows



317
to King Jonakr’s paternal soil. Doubts will be in the resolves of Jonakr’s sons.
61. She will Svanhild send from the land, her daughter, and Sigurd’s. Her will destroy Bikki’s counsel; for Jörmunrek for evil lives. Then will have passed away all Sigurd’s race, and Gudrún’s tears will be the more.
62. One prayer I have to thee yet to make, in this world’t will be my last request: Let in the plain be raised a pile so spacious, that for us all like room may be, for those who shall have died with Sigurd.
63. Bedeck the pile about with shields and hangings, a variegated corpse-cloth, and multitude of slain. Let them burn the Hun4 on the one side of me;
64. Let them with the Hun burn on the other side, my household slaves, with collars splendid,
4. Sigurd.



318
two at our heads, and two hawks; then will all be equally distributed.
65. Let also lie between us both the sword with rings adorned, the keen-edged iron, so again be placed, as when we both one couch ascended, and were then called by the name of consorts.
66. Then will not clang against his heel the hall’s bright gates, with splendid ring, if my train him hence shall follow. Then will our procession appear not mean.
67. For him will follow five female thralls, eight male slaves of gentle birth, fostered with me, and with my patrimony, which to his daughter Budli gave.
68. Much I have said, and more would say, if the sword would grant me power of speech. My voice fails, my wounds swell: truth only I have uttered; so I will cease.”



319
Brot af Brynhildarkviða
Fragments of the Lay of Brynhild
Gunnar 1. “Why art thou, Brynhild! Budli’s daughter! absorbed in evil and murderous thoughts? What injury has Sigurd done thee, that thou the hero wilt of life bereave?”
Brynhild 2. “Sigurd to me oaths has sworn, all falsehoods. He at a time deceived me when he should have been of all oaths most observant.”
Högni 3. “Thee Brynhild has in anger instigated evil to perpetrate, harm to execute. She grudges Gudrún her happy marriage, and thee, possession of herself.” ***************************** *****************************



320
4. Some a wolf roasted, some a snake cut up, some to Guthorm served the wolf, before they might, eager for crime, on the mighty man lay their hands.
5. Without stood Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter, and these words first of all she uttered: “Where is now Sigurd, lord of warriors, seeing that my kinsmen foremost ride?”
6. Högni alone to her answer gave: “Asunder have we Sigurd hewed with our swords; his grey steed bends o’er the dead chief.”
7. Then said Brynhild, Budli’s daughter, “Well shall ye now enjoy arms and lands. Sigurd would alone over all have ruled, had he a little longer life retained.
8. Unseemly it had been that he should so have ruled over Giuki’s heritage and the Goths’ people, when he five sons, for the fall of hosts, eager for warfare, had begotten.”



321
9. Then laughed Brynhild the whole burgh resounded once only from her whole heart: “Well shall ye enjoy lands and subjects, now the daring king ye have caused to fall.”
10. Then said Gudrún, Guiki’s daughter: “Much thou speakest, things most atrocious: may fiends have Gunnar, Sigurd’s murderer! Souls malevolent vengeance awaits.”
11. Sigurd had fallen south of the Rhine: loud from a tree a raven screamed: “With your blood will Atli his sword’s edge redden; the oaths ye have sworn your slaughter shall dissolve.”
12. Evening was advanced, much was drunken, then did pleasant talk of all kinds pass: all sank in sleep, when to rest they went. Gunnar alone was wakeful longer than all:



322
13. He began his foot to move, and much with himself to speak; the warlike chief in his mind pondered, what during the conflict the raven and the eagle were ever saying, as they rode home.
14. Brynhild awoke, Budli’s daughter, daughter of the Skiöldungs, a little ere day: “Urge me or stay me the mischief is perpetrated my sorrow to pour forth, or so suppress it.”
15. All were silent at these words; few understood the lady’s conduct, that weeping she should begin to speak of what she laughing had desired.
16. “In my dream, Gunnar! all seemed so horrid; in the chamber all was dead; my bed was cold; and thou, king! wast riding of joy bereft, with fetters loaded, to a hostile host. So will ye all, race of Niflungs! be of power deprived, perjurers as ye are!



323
17. Ill Gunnar! didst thou remember, when blood ye in your footsteps both let flow; now hast thou him ill for all that requited, because he would prove himself foremost.
18. Then was it proved, when the hero had ridden to see me, to woo me, how the warlike chief whilom held sacred his oath towards the youthful prince.
19. Laid his sword, with gold adorned, the illustrious king between us both: outward its edges were with fire wrought, but with venom drops tempered within.”
From this lay, in which the death of Sigurd is related, it appears that he was slain without doors, while some relate that he was slain sleeping in his bed: but the Germans say he was slain out in the forest; and it is told in the Guðrúnarkviða hin Forna, that Sigurd and the sons of Giuki had ridden to the public assembly (Þing) when he was slain. But it is said by all, without exception, that they broke faith with him, and attacked him while lying down and unprepared.

325
GuÞrúnarkviða Fyrsta: The First Lay of Gudrún
Gudrún sat over Sigurd dead; she wept not as other women, although ready to burst with sorrow. Both men and women, came to console her, but that was not easy. It is said by some that Gudrún had eaten of Fafnir’s heart, and therefore understood the talk of birds. This is also sung of Gudrún:
1. Of old it was that Gudrún prepared to die, when she sorrowing over Sigurd sat. No sigh she uttered, nor with her hands beat, nor wailed, as other women.
2. Jarls came forward of great sagacity, from her sad state of mind to divert her. Gudrún could not shed a tear, such was her affliction; ready she was to burst.
3. Sat there noble wives of jarls, adorned with gold, before Gudrún; each of them told her sorrows, the bitterest she had known.
4. Then said Giaflaug, Giuki’s sister: “I know myself to be on earth most joyless: of five consorts I the loss have suffered; of two daughters, sisters three,



326
and brothers eight; I alone live.”
5. Gudrún could not shed a tear, such was her affliction for her dead consort, and her soul’s anguish for the king’s fall.
6. Then said Herborg, Hunaland’s queen: “I a more cruel grief have to recount: my seven sons, in the south land, my spouse the eighth, in conflict fell.
7. My father and my mother, my brothers four, on the sea the wind deluded; the waves struck on the ship’s timbers.
8. Their last honours ‘twas mine to pay, ‘twas mine to see them tombed, their funeral rites to prepare was mine. All this I underwent in one half-year, and to me no one consolation offered.
9. Then I became a captive, taken in war, at the close of the same half-year. Then had I to adorn, and tie the shoes,



327
of the hersir’s wife, each morn.
10. From jealousy she threatened me, and with hard blows drove me: nowhere master found I a better, but mistress no where a worse.”
11. Gudrún could not shed a tear, such was her affliction for her dead consort, and her soul’s anguish for the king’s fall.
12. Then said Gullrönd, Guiki’s daughter: “Little canst thou, my fosterer, wise as thou art, with a young wife fittingly talk.” The king’s body she forbade to be longer hidden.
13. She snatched the sheet from Sigurd’s corse, and turned his cheek towards his wife’s knees: “Behold thy loved one, lay thy mouth to his lip, as if thou wouldst embrace the living prince.”
14. Gudrún upon him cast one look: she saw the prince’s locks dripping with blood, the chief ’s sparking eyes



328
closed in death, his kingly breast cleft by the sword.
15. Then sank down Gudrún back on her pillow, her head-gear was loosed, her cheeks grew red, and a flood of tears fell to her knees.
16. Then wept Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter, so that the tears spontaneously flowed, and at the same time screamed the geese in the court, the noble birds, which the lady owned.
17. Then spake Gullrönd Giuki’s daughter: “Your loves I know were the most ardent among living beings upon earth: thou hadst delight nowhere, sister mine! save with Sigurd.”
18. Then said Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter: “Such was my Sigurd among Giuki’s sons, as is the garlick out from the grass which grows, or a bright stone on a thread drawn, a precious gem on kings.



329
19. I also seemed to the prince’s warriors higher than any of Herian’s Dísir; now I am as little as the leaf oft is in the storm-winds, after the chieftain’s death.
20. Sitting I miss, and in my bed, my dearest friend. Giuki’s sons have caused, Giuki’s sons have caused my affliction, and their sister’s tears of anguish.
21. So ye desolate the people’s land, as ye have kept your sworn oaths. Gunnar! thou wilt not the gold enjoy; those rings will be thy bane, for the oaths thou to Sigurd gavest.
22. Oft in the mansion was the greater mirth, when my Sigurd Grani saddled, and Brynhild they went to woo, that witch accursed, in an evil hour!”
23. Then said Brynhild, Budli’s daughter: “May the hag lack spouse and children,



330
who thee, Gudrún! has caused to weep, and this morning given the runes of speech!”1
24. Then said Gullrönd, Giuki’s daughter: “Cease, thou loathed of all! from those words. The evil destiny of princes thou hast ever been; thee every billow drives of an evil nature; thou sore affliction of seven kings, the greatest bane of friendship among women!”
25. Then said Brynhild, Budli’s daughter: “Atli my brother, Budli’s offspring, is the sole cause of all the evil;
26. When in the hall of the Hunnish folk, with the king we beheld the fire of the serpent’s bed.2 Of that journey, I have paid the penalty, that sight I have ever rued.”
27. She by a column stood, the wood violently clasped. From the eyes of Brynhild, Budli’s daughter, fire gleamed forth;
1. Power of speech.
2. A periphrasis of gold.



331
venom she snorted, when she beheld the wounds of Sigurd.
Gudrún then went away to the forest and deserts, and travelled to Denmark, where she stayed seven half-years with Thora, Hakon’s daughter. Brynhild would not outlive Sigurd. She caused her eight thralls and five female slaves to be killed, and then slew herself with a sword, as it is related in the Sigurðarkviða in Skemma (the Short Lay of Sigurd).



332



333
Helreið Brynhildar: Brynhild’s Hel-ride.
After Brynhild’s death two piles were made, one for Sigurd, which was the first burnt; but Brynhild was burnt afterwards, and she was in a chariot, which was hung with precious tapestry; so that it was said that Brynhild drove in a chariot on the way to Hel, and passed through a place: in which a giantess dwelt. The giantess said:
1. “Thou shalt not pass through my stone-supported dwelling-place. Better had it beseemed thee to work broidery, than to seek after another’s husband.
2. Why dost thou, vagrant woman! from Valland, my dwelling visit? Thou hast, golden dame! if thou desirest to know, gentle one! from thy hands washed human blood.”
Brynhild 3. “Upbraid me not, woman of the rock! although I have in warfare been. Of us, I trow, I shall the better seem, wherever men our conditions know.”



334
Giantess 4. “Thou, Brynhild! Budli’s daughter! wast in evil hour born in the world; thou hast been the bane of Giuki’s children, and their happy house subverted.”
Brynhild 5. “From my chariot I will truly tell thee, thou witless crone! if thou desirest to know, how Giuki’s heirs made me both lovelorn and perjured.
6. The bold-hearted king1 caused the garbs of us eight sisters under an oak to be borne. Twelve years old was I, if thou desirest to know, when to the youthful king oaths I gave.
7. By all in Hlymdalir I was called Hild with the helm, by all who knew me.
8. Then caused I next, in the Gothic realm, the old Hiálmgunnar to Hel to journey: I gave victory to
1. By depriving them of swan-plumage, for they were Valkyriur like the wives of Volund and his brothers,
Agnar reduced them under his subjection.



335
the youthful brother of Öda, whereat Odin became hostile to me.
9. He with shields encompassed me, red and white, in Skatalund; their surfaces enclosed me; him he ordained my sleep to break, who in no place could be made to fear.
10. He made around my hall, towards the south, towering burn the destroyer of all wood: then bade that man only over it to ride, who me the gold should bring, that under Fafnir lay.
11. On Grani rode the chief, the gold-disperser, to where my foster-father ruled o’er the dwellings. He alone seemed there to all superior, the Danish warrior, of the court.
12. We slept and were content in the same bed, as if he had my born brother been; neither of us might on the other, for eight nights, lay a hand.



336
13. Reproached me Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter, that I had slept in Sigurd’s arms; then was I made aware of what I fain would not, that they had deceived me, when a mate I took.
14. To calamities all too lasting men and women ever will be while living born. We two shall now, Sigurd and I, pass our life together. Sink thou of giant-kind!”



337
Drap Niflunga: The Slaughter of the Niflungs.
Gunnar and Högni then took all the gold, Fafnir’s heritage. Dissension prevailed afterwards between the Giúkungs and Atli. He charged them with being the cause of Brynhild’s death. By way of reconciliation, it was agreed that they should give him Gudrún in marriage, to whom they administered an oblivious potion, before she would consent to espouse Atli. Atli had two sons, Erp and Eitil, but Svanhild was the daughter of Sigurd and Gudrún. King Atli invited gunnar and Högni to his residence, and sent to them Vingi, or Knefröd. Gudrún was aware of the treachery, and sent them word in runes not to come; and to Högni, as a token, she sent the ring Andvaranaut, in which she had tied some wolf ’s hair. Gunnar had sought the hand of Oddrún, Atli’s sister, but did not obtain it. He then married Glaumvör, and Högni took Kostbera to wife. Their sons were Sólar, Snævar, and Giúki. When the Giúkungs came to Atli, Gudrún besought his sons to intercede for their lives, but they would not. The heart of Högni was cut out, and Gunnar was cast into a pen of serpents. He struck his harp and lulled the serpents, but an adder stung him in the liver.



338



339
Guðrúnarkviða Önnur: The Second Lay of Gudrún
King Theodric was with Atli, and had there lost the greater number of his men. Theodric and Gudrún mutually bewailed their afflictions. She related to him and said:
1. A maid above all maids I was; my mother reared me bright in her bower; my brothers I much loved, until me Giúki, with gold adorned, with gold adorned, to Sigurd gave.
2. Such as Sigurd above Giúki’s sons, as the green leek is, springing from the grass, or the high-limbed hart above the savage beasts, or the gleed-red gold above grey silver.
3. Until my brothers the possession grudged me of a consort to all superior. They could not sleep, nor on affairs deliberate, before they Sigurd had caused to die.
4. Grani to the assembly ran, his tramp was to be heard; but Sigurd then himself came not. All the saddle-beasts were splashed with blood, and with sweating faint, from the murderers.



340
5. Weeping I went to talk to Grani, with humid cheeks, I prayed the steed to tell: then Grani shuddered, in the grass bowed down his head. The steed knew that his master was no more.
6. Long I wandered, long was my mind distracted, ere of the people’s guardian I inquired for my king.
7. Gunnar hung his head, but Högni told me of Sigurd’s cruel death. “Beyond the river slaughtered lies Guthorm’s murderer, and to the wolves given.
8. Yonder beyond Sigurd, towards the south, there thou wilt hear the ravens croak, the eagles scream, in their feast exulting; the wolves howling round thy consort.”
9. “Why wilt thou, Högni! to a joyless being such miseries recount? May thy heart by ravens be torn and scattered over the wide world, rather than thou shouldst walk with men.”



341
10. Högni answered, for once cast down, from his cheerful mood by intense trouble: “Gudrún! thou wouldst have greater cause to weep, if the ravens should tear my heart.”
11. Alone I turned from that interview to the wolves’ scattered leavings. No sigh I uttered, nor with my hands beat, nor wailed, as other women, when I heart-broken sat by Sigurd.
12. Night seemed to me of blackest darkness, when I sorrowing sat by Sigurd. Better by far it seemed to me had the wolves taken my life, or I had been burnt as a birchen tree.
13. From the fell I journeyed five long days and nights, until the lofty hall of Hálf I recognized. Seven half-years I with Thora stayed, Hákon’s daughter, in Denmark.



342
14. She for my solace wrought in gold southern halls, and Danish swans.
15. We had in pictures the game of warriors, and in handiworks a prince’s nobles; red shields, Hunnish heroes, a sworded host, a helmed host, a prince’s following.
16. Sigmund’s ships from the land sailing, with gilded heads, and carved prows. We on our canvas wrought how Sigar and Siggeir both contended southward in Fyen.
17. When Grimhild, the Gothic woman, heard how greatly I was affected, she cast aside her needlework, and her sons called oft and earnestly, that she might know, who for her son would their sister compensate, or for her consort slain the blood-fine pay?
18. Gunnar was ready gold to offer, for the injuries to atone, and Högni also. ************************* *************************



343
She then inquired who would go the steeds to saddle, the chariot to drive, on horseback ride, the hawk let fly, arrows shoot from the yew bow?
19. Valdar and the Danes with Jarizleif, Eymód the third with Jarizkar, then entered, to princes like. Red mantles had the Langbard’s men, corslets ornamented, towering helms; girded they were with falchions, brown were their locks.
20. For me each one would choose precious gifts, precious gifts, and to my heart would speak, if for my many woes they might gain my confidence, and I would in them trust.
21. Grimhild to me brought a potion to drink cold and bitter, that I my injuries might forget; it was mingled with Urd’s power, with cold sea-water, and with Són’s blood.



344
22. In that horn were characters of every kind graven and red-hued; nor could I comprehend them: the long lyng-fish1 of the Haddings’ land, an uncut ear of corn: the wild-beasts’ entrance.
23. In that potion were many ills together, a herb from every wood, and the acorn, the fire-stead’s dew,2 entrails of offerings, swine’s liver seethed; for that deadens strife.
24. And then I forgot, when I had taken it, all the king’s words in the hall spoken. There to my feet three kings came, before she herself sought to speak with me.
25. “Gudrún! I will give thee gold to possess, of all the riches much of thy dead father; rings of red gold, Hlödver’s halls, all the hangings left by the fallen king.
1. That is the long fish of the heath, or ling, a snake or serpent.
2. Soot.



345
26. Hunnish maids, those who weave tapestry, and in bright gold work, so that I may delight thee. Over Budli’s wealth thou alone shalt rule, adorned with gold, and given to Atli.”
27. “I will not have any man, nor Brynhild’s brother marry: it beseems me not with Budli’s son to increase a race, or life enjoy.”
28. “Take care not to pay the chiefs with hate; for ‘tis we who have been the aggressors: so shouldst thou act as if yet lived Sigurd and Sigmund, if sons thou bearest.”
29. “Grimhild! I cannot in mirth indulge, nor, for my hero’s sake, cherish a hope, since the bloodthirsty (wolf and) raven have together cruelly drunk my Sigurd’s heart’s blood.”



346
30. “Him3 of all I have found to be a king of noblest race, and in much most excellent: him shalt thou have until age lays thee low, or mateless be, if him thou wilt not take.”
31. “Cease to offer that cup of ills so pertinaciously, that race to me: he will Gunnar’s destruction perpetrate, and will cut out Högni’s heart. I will not cease until the exulting strife-exciter’s life I shall have taken.”
32. Weeping Grimhild caught the words, by which to her sons Gudrún forboded evil, and to her kindred dire misfortunes. “Lands I will also give thee, people and followers, Vinbiörg and Valbiörg, if thou wilt accept them; for life possess them, and be happy, daughter!”
33. “Him then I will choose, among the kings, and from my relatives reluctantly receive him. Never will he be to me
3. Atli: Grimhild speaks.



347
a welcome consort, nor my brothers’ bale a protection to our sons.”
34. Forthwith on horseback was each warrior to be seen; but the Walish women were in chariots placed. For seven days o’er a cold land we rode; but the second seven, we beat the waves; and the third seven, we reached dry land.
35. There the gate-wards of the lofty burgh the latticed entrance opened, ere the court we entered. ************************** **************************
36. Atli waked me, but I seemed to be full of evil thoughts, for my kinsmen’s death.
37. “So me just now4 have the Norns waked, a grateful interpretation I fain would have. Methought that thou, Gudrún! Giuki’s daughter! with a treacherous sword didst pierce me through.”
38. “Fire it forebodes,5 when one of iron dreams, arrogance and pleasure,
4. Atli speaks.
5. Gudrun answers.



348
a woman’s anger. Against evil I will go burn thee, cure and medicate thee, although to me thou art hateful.”
39. “Seemed to me here in the garden6 that young shoots had fallen, which I wished to let grow: torn up with their roots reddened with blood, to table were they brought, and offered me to eat.
40. Seemed to me that hawks flew from my hand, lacking their quarry, to the house of woes; seemed to me I ate their hearts with honey swollen with blood, with sorrowing mind.
41. Seemed to me from my hand whelps I let slip; lacking cause of joy, both of them howled: seemed to me their bodies became dead carcases: of the carrion I was compelled to eat.”
42. “There will warriors7 round thy couch converse, and of the white-locked ones take off the head; death-doomed they are within a few nights, a little ere day: thy court will eat of them.”
6. Atli speaks.
7. Gudrun answers.



349
43. “Lie down I would not,8 nor sleep after, obstinate in my fate That I will execute!”
8. Atli speaks.



350



351
Guðrunarkviða Þriðja: The Third Lay of Gudrún
Atli had a serving-woman named Herkia1, who had been his concubine. She informed Atli that she had seen Thiodrek and Gudrún together; whereat Atli was much afflicted. Then Gudrún said:
1. What ails thee ever, Atli! Budli’s son! Hast thou sorrow in thy heart? Why never laughest thou? To thy jarls it would seem more desirable, that thou with men wouldst talk, and on me wouldst look.
Atli 2. It grieves me, Gudrún! Giuki’s daughter! that in my palace here, Herkia has said, that thou and Thiodrek have under one covering slept, and wantonly been in the linen wrapt.
Gudrún 3. For all this charge I will give my oaths by the white sacred stone, that with me and Thiodrek nothing has passed, which to man and wife only belongs;
1. Herkia, the Erka or Helche of the German tradition, who here appears as a slave or servant, is, accord
ing to that tradition, the queen of Etzel or Atli, who did not marry Kreimhilt (Gudrun) until after her death.
The falsification of the story, the pitiful subordinate part acted by Thiodrek, the perfect silence of all the other
poems on this event, and the ordeal of the cauldron, sufficiently show that the poem is a later composition. P.
E. Muller (II., p. 319) ascribes it to Sæmund himself.



352
4. Save that I embraced the prince of armies, the honoured king, a single time. Other were our cogitations, when sorrowful we two sat to converse.
5. Hither came Thiodrek, with thirty warriors; now there lives not one of those thirty men. Surround me with thy brothers, and with mailed warriors; surround me with all thy noblest kinsmen.
6. Send to Saxi the Southmen’s prince, he can hallow the boiling cauldron.”
7. Seven hundred men entered the hall, ere in the cauldron the queen dipt her hand.
8. “Now Gunnar comes not, nor call I Högni: I shall not see again my loved brothers: with his sword would Högni such wrong avenge: now I must myself purify from crime.”



353
9. She to the bottom plunged her snow-white hand, and up she drew the precious stones.2 “See now, ye men! I am proved guiltless in holy wise, boil the vessel as it may.”
10. Laughed then Atli’s heart within his breast, when he unscathed beheld the hands of Gudrún. “Now must Herkia to the cauldron go, she who Gudrún had hoped to injure.” No one has misery seen who saw not that, how the hand there of Herkia was burnt. They then the woman led to a foul slough.3 So were Gudrún’s wrongs avenged.
2. The iarknastein of the original was a milk-white opal.
3. This punishment was known to the old Germans.



354



355
Oddrúnargrátr: Oddrún’s Lament
There was a King named Heidrek, who had a daughter named Borgný. Her lover was named Vilmund. She could not give birth to a child until Oddrún, Atli’s sister, came. She had been the beloved of Gunnar, Giuki’s son. Of this story it is here sung:
1. I have heard tell, in ancient storied how a damsel came to the eastern land: no one was able, on the face of earth, help to afford to Heidrek’s daughter.
2. When Oddrún, Atli’s sister, heard that the damsel had great pains, from the stall she led her well-bridled steed, and on the swart one the saddle laid.
3. She the horse made run on the smooth, dusty way, until she came to where a high hall stood. She the saddle snatched from the hungry steed, and in she went along the court, and these words first of all she uttered:
4. “What is most noteworthy in this country? or what most desirable in the Hunnish land?”



356
Borgný 5. Here lies Borgný with pains o’erwhlemed, thy friend, Oddrún! See if thou canst help her.
Oddrún 6. What chieftain has on thee brought this dishonour? Why so acute are Borgný’s pains?
Borgný 7. Vilmund is named the falcon-bearers’ friend: he the damsel wrapt in a warm coverlet five whole winters, so that from her father she was hidden.
8. They, I ween, spoke not more than this: kindly she went to sit at the damsel’s knee. Vehemently sang Oddrún, fervently sang Oddrún songs of power over Borgný.
9. A girl and boy might then tread the mould-way, gentle babes, born of Högni’s bane. Then began to speak the death-sick damsel, who before had no word uttered.



357
10. “So may thee help the benignant genii, Frigg and Freyja, and other gods besides, as thou hast from me peril removed!”
11. “I was not inclined to give thee help, because thou never wast of succour worthy: I vowed, and have performed what I then said when the princes the heritage divided, that I would ever help afford.”
Borgný 12. Mad art thou, Oddrún! and hast lost thy wits, when in hostile spirit most of thy words thou utterest; for I have been thy companion upon the earth, as if from brothers we both were born.
Oddrún 13. I remember yet what thou one evening saidst, when I for Gunnar, a compotation made. Such a case, saidst thou, would not thenceforth happen to any maiden, save to me alone.”
14. Then sat down the sorrowing lady to tell her woes, for her great grief:



358
15. “I was nurtured in the kingly hall, I was the joy of many in the council of men. Life I enjoyed, and my father’s wealth, five winters only, while my father lived.
16. These last words the noble-hearted king strove to utter, ere he departed hence.
17. He bade me be endowed with ruddy gold, and in the south be given to Grimhild’s son. He said no maiden could more excellent in the world be born, if fate willed it not otherwise.
18. Brynhild in her bower was occupied to broidery: she had people and lands around her. Earth slumbered, and the heavens above, when Fafnir’s bane her burgh first saw.
19. Then was conflict waged with the Walish sword, and the burgh taken which Brynhild owned. It was not long which was not surprising ere she discovered all those frauds.



359
20. These she caused cruelly to be avenged, so that we all have great afflictions. Know it will be through every land of men, that she caused herself to die with Sigurd.
21. But I for Gunnar, rings’ dispenser, love conceived, such as Brynhild should. But he Brynhild bade a helmet take, said she a Valkyria should become.
22. They forthwith offered1 ruddy rings to my brother, and indemnity not small. He2 besides offered for me fifteen vills, and the load of Grani’s sides, if he would accept them.
23. But Atli said he never would a marriage-gift receive from Giuki’s son. Still we could not our loves withstand, but I my head must lay upon the ring-breaker.
1. For Brynhild’s death.
2. Gunnar.



360
24. Many things said my relations; declared they had surprised us both together; but Atli said, that I would not crime commit, nor scandal perpetrate. But such should no one ever deny, when love has part.
25. Atli sent his emissaries about the Murk-wood, that he might prove me; and they came to where they ought not to have come, to where we had one couch prepared.
26. To the men we offered red-gold rings, that they it might not to Atli tell; but they forthwith hastened home, and it quickly to Atli told.
27. But they from Gudrún carefully concealed it, yet rather by half she should have known it.3 ************************* *************************
28. A sound was heard of gold-shod hoofs, when into the court rode Giuki’s heirs.
3. From here the narrative appears to be very fragmentary.



361
************************ ************************ Of Högni they the heart cut out, and into a serpent-pen the other cast. ************************ ************************
29. I had gone yet once again to Geirmund, to prepare a banquet. ************************ ************************ ************************
The brave king began4 the harp to sound; for the prince of noble race hoped that I to his aid might come.
30. I it heard from Hlesey, how of trouble there the harp-strings sang.
31. I my thralls bade all be ready; I the prince’s life would save. The vessel we let float past the forest,5 until I saw all Atli’s courts.
4. Gunnar while in the serpent-pen.
5. For lund (forest, wood), which is the reading of the MSS., the Copenhagen editor favours the correction
to sund (a sound or straight, the Sound)?



362
32. Then came Atli’s miserable mother crawling forth: may she perish! she Gunnar pierced to the heart; so that the hero I could not save.
33. Oftentimes I wonder, woman gold-adorned!6 how I after can life retain; for I seemed the formidable sword-dispenser as myself to love:
34. Thou sitst and listenest, while I recount to thee many and evil fate, my own and theirs.” Each one lives as he best may. Now is ended Oddrún’s lament.
6. Borgny.



363
Atlakviða: The Lay of Atli
Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter, avenged her brothers, as is well known. She first killed Atli’s sons, and afterwards Atli himself, and burnt the palace with all the household. On these events was this lay composed.
1. Atli sent riding a messenger to Gunnar, a crafty man, Knefrud was his name. To Giuki’s courts he came, and to Gunnar’s hall, to the seats of state,1 and the glad potation:
2. There drank the courtiers wine in their Valhall but the guileful ones2 silence kept the Huns’ wrath they3 feared. Then said Knefrud, with chilling voice: the southern warrior on a high bench sat
3. “Atli has sent me hither on his errand riding on a bit-griping steed, through the unknown Myrkwood, to pray you, Gunnar! that to his bench ye come, with helms of state, Atli’s home to visit.
1. The ephithet aringreypr is applied both to benches and helmets (see Strophes 3 and 16). Its meaning
is doubtful: it has been rendered iron-bound, brass-bound, hearth-encircling, curved like an eagle’s beak, etc.
Benches and helmets of ceremony are evidently intended, probably ornamented with brass-work or figures of
eagles. But to whichever substantive applied, I take its meaning to be the same.
2. The messengers of Atli.
3. The Giukings.



364
4. Shields ye there can choose, and smooth-shaven spears, gold-red helms, and of Huns a multitude, silver-gilt saddle-cloths, sarks gory-red, the dart’s obstruction, and bit-griping steeds.
5. The plain he will also give you, the broad Gnítaheid, whistling javelins, and gilded prows, vast treasures, and Danp’s towns, with that famed forest, which men the Murkwood call.”
6. Gunnar his head then turned, and to Högni said: “What counselest thou, bold warrior?” now suchlike we hear? Of no gold I knew on Gníta’s heath, to which we possess not other equal.
7. Seven halls have we filled with swords, of each of which the hilt is gold. My horse I know the best, and my sword the keenest; my bow adorns my seat, my corslets are of gold, my helm and shield the brightest, brought from the hall of Kiar: mine alone are better than all the Hunnish ones.



365
8. What thinkest thou the woman4 means, by sending us a ring in a wolf ’s clothing wrapt? I think that she caution enjoins. Wolf ’s hair I found twined in the red-gold ring: wolfish is the way we on our errand ride.”
9. No sons persuaded Gunnar, nor other kinsman, interpreters nor counsellors, nor those who potent were. Then spake Gunnar, as beseemed a king, great in his mead-hall, from his large soul:
10. “Rise now up, Fiörnir! let along the benches pass the golden cups of heroes, from the attendants’ hands.
11. The wolf shall rule the Niflungs’ heritage, O bearded sages! if Gunnar perish; black-coated bears earth’s fruit tear with their teeth, to the dogs’ delight, if Gunnar come not back.”
12. Honoured men, weeping led the land’s ruler from the Huns’ court. Then said Högni’s youthful heir: “Go now, prudent and prosperous, whither your wishes lead.”
4. Gudrun: she had sent, by Atli’s messengers, a ring to her brothers, as a warning, in which a wolf ’s hair
was entwined, together with a note in runes, which were falsified by Vingi.



366
13. The warriors made their bit-griping steeds over the mountains fly, through the unknown Murkwood. The whole Hunnish forest trembled where’er the warriors rode; over the shrubless, all-green plains they sped.
14. Atli’s land they saw, and the high watch-towers; Bikki’s people stood on that lofty fortress; the south people’s hall was round with benches set, with well-bound bucklers, and white shields, the javelin’s obstruction. There Atli drank wine in his Valhall: his guards sat without, Gunnar and his men to watch, lest they there should come with yelling dart, to excite their prince to conflict.
15. Their sister forthwith saw, when the hall they had entered, her brothers both beer had she little drunken “Betrayed art thou now Gunnar! though strong, how wilt thou contend with the Huns’ deadly wiles? Go quickly from this hall!
16. Better hadst thou, Gunnar! in corslet come, than with helm of state, to see the home of Atli; thou in the saddle wouldst have sat whole sun-bright days, and o’er the pallid dead



367
let the Norns weep, the Hunnish shield-maids misery suffer; but Atli himself thou shouldst into the serpent-pen have cast; but now the serpent-pen is for you two reserved.”
17. “Sister! ‘tis now too late the Niflungs to assemble, long ‘tis to seek the aid of men, of valiant heroes, over the rugged fells of Rhine.”
18. Then the Burgundians’ friends5 Gunnar seized, in fetters laid, and him fast bound.
19. Högni hewed down seven, with the keen sword, but the eighth he thrust into the raging fire. So should a valiant man defend himself from foes.
20 Högni had Gunnar’s hands6 protected. The bold chief they asked, if the Goths’ lord would with gold his life redeem? ************************* *************************
21. “Högnis heart in my hand shall lie, cut bloody from the breast of the valiant chief,
5. Atli’s men.
6. That is Gunnar himself.



368
the king’s son, with a dull-edged knife.” ************************** **************************
They the heart cut out from Hialli’s breast; on a dish bleeding laid it, and to Gunnar bare.
23. Then said Gunnar, lord of men: “Here have I the heart of the timid Hialli, unlike the heart of the bold Högni; for much it trembles as in the dish it lies: it trembled more by half, while in his breast it lay.”
24. Högni laughed, when to his heart they cut the living crest-crasher; no lament uttered he. All bleeding on a dish they laid it, and it to Gunnar bare.
25. Calmly said Gunnar, the warrior Niflung: “Here have I the heart of the bold Högni, unlike the heart of the timid Hialli; for it little trembles, as in the dish it lies: it trembled less, while in his breast it lay.



369
26. So far shalt thou, Atli! be from the eyes of men as thou wilt from the treasures be. In my power alone is all the hidden Niflungs’ gold, now that Högni lives not.
27. Ever was I wavering, while we both lived; now am I so no longer, as I alone survive. Rhine shall possess men’s baleful metal, the mighty stream, the Ás-known Niflungs’ heritage. In the rolling water the choice rings shall glitter, rather than on the hands of the Huns’ children shine.
28. Drive your wheel-chariots, the captive is now in bonds.”
29. Atli the mighty, their sister’s husband, rode with resounding steeds, with strife-thorns7 surrounded. Gudrún perceived the heroes’ peril she from tears refrained, on entering the hall of tumult.
30. “So be it with thee, Atli! as toward Gunnar thou hast held the oft-sworn oaths, formerly taken by the southward verging sun, and by Sigtý’s hill,
7. Spears.



370
the secluded bed of rest, and by Ullr’s ring.” Yet thence the more did the bit-shaker8 the treasure’s guardian, the warrior chief, drag to death.
31. The living prince then did a host of men into a pen cast down, which was within with serpents over-crawled. But Gunnar there alone a harp in wrathful mood with his hand struck: the strings resounded. So should a daring chief, a ring-dispenser, gold from men withhold.
32. Atli turned his brass-shod9 steed, his home to re-visit, back from the murder. Din was in the court with horses thronged, men’s weapon-song, from the heath they were come.
33. Out then went Gudrún, Atli to meet, with a golden cup to do her duty to the king. “Thou canst, o king! joyful in thy hall receive from Gudrún the arms of the departed.”
8. The horse.
9. The original word is eyrskan, a word of doubtful signification.



371
34. The drinking-cups of Atli groaned with wine heavy, when in the hall together the Huns were counted. Long-bearded, bold, the warriors entered.
35. Hastened the bright-faced dame to bear their potions to them, the wondrous lady to the chiefs; and reluctantly to the pallid Atli the festal dainties offered, and uttered words of hate.
36. “Thou, swords’ dispenser! hast thy two sons’ hearts, slaughter-gory, with honey eaten. I resolved that thou, bold chief! shouldst of a human dish eat at thy feasting, and to the place of honour send it.
37. Henceforth thou wilt not to thy knees call Erp and Eitil, joyous with beer the two: thou wilt not henceforth see them from thy middle seat, gold-dispersing, javelins shafting, manes clipping, or horses urging.”
38. Uproar was on the benches, portentous the cry of men, noise beneath the costly hangings. The children of the Huns wept, all wept save Gudrún, who never wept, or for her bear-fierce brothers, or her dear sons,



372
young, simple, whom she had borne to Atli.
39. Gold scattered the swan-fair dame; with ruddy rings the household gifted. Fate she let ripen, but the bright gold flow. The woman spared not the treasure-houses.
40. Atli incautious had himself drunk weary; weapon he had none, nor was ‘gainst Gudrún guarded. Oft had their sport been better, when they lovingly embraced each other before the nobles.
41. With the sword’s point she gave the bed of blood to drink with death-bent hand, and the dogs loosed, out at the hall-door drove them, and the lady wakened the household with burning brand. That vengeance she for her brothers took.
42. To fire she then gave all that were therein, and from her brothers’ murder were from the dark den10 returned. The old structures fell, the treasure-houses smoked, the Budlungs’ dwelling. Burnt too were the shield-maids within, their lives cut short; in the raging fire they sank.
10. The serpent-pen.



373
43. Of this enough is said. No such woman will henceforth arms again bear, to avenge her brothers. That bright woman had to three kings of men the death-doom borne, before she died.
Yet more clearly is this told in Atlamálum inum Groenlenzkum (the Groenland lay of Atli).



374



375
Atlamál in Groenlenzku
The Groenland Lay of Atli
1. Of those misdeeds men have heard tell, when warriors of old a compact made, which by pledges they confirmed, a secret consultation held: terrible it was to them after, and to Giuki’s sons likewise, who were betrayed.
2. The warriors’ fate ripened, they were death-doomed: ill advised was Atli, though he possessed sagacity: he felled a mighty column, strove hardly against himself; with speed he messengers despatched, that his wife’s brothers should come quickly.
3. Wise was the house-dame, prudently she thought; the words in order she had heard, that in secret they had said: the sage lady was at a loss: fain would she help them: they1 o’er the sea must sail, but she herself could not go.
4. Runes she graved, Vingi them falsified, before he gave them from him; of ill he was the bearer. Then departed Atli’s messengers, through the branched firth, for where the bold warriors dwelt.
1. The messengers.



376
5. They with beer were cheered, and fires they kindled, naught thought they of guile, when they were come; they the gifts accepted, which the prince sent them, and of no evil thought.
6. Then came Kostbera, she was Högni’s wife, a woman greatly cautious, and them both greeted. Glad was also Glaumvör, Gunnar’s consort, the prudent dame her duty forgot not, she to the guests’ need attended.
7. Högni they home invited, if he would be pleased to go. Treachery was manifest, had they but reflected! Gunnar then promised, if only Högni would, but Högni refused what the other proposed.
8. The noble dames bore mead, of many things there was abundance, many horns passed round, until it seemed they had full drunken.
9. The household prepared their couches, as to them seemed best. Cunning was Kostbera, she could runes interpret; she the letters read by the bright fire; her tongue she had to guard between both her gums so perverted were they, it was difficult to understand them.



377
10. To their bed they went, she and Högni. The gentle lady dreamed, and concealed it not, to the prince wisely said it as soon as she awoke.
11. “From home thou art going, Högni! give ear to counsel; few are fully prudent: go another time.
12. I have the runes interpreted, which thy sister graved: that fair dame has not this time invited thee. At one thing I wonder most, I cannot even conceive, why so wise a woman so confusedly should grave; for it is so set down as if it intimated death to you both, if you should straightway come. Either she has left out a letter, or others are the cause. 2
13. “They are,” said Högni, “all suspicious; I have no knowledge of them, nor will I into it inquire, unless we have to make requital. The king will gift us with gleed-red gold. I never fear, though we may hear of terror.”
2. It would seem that the original runes, as graved by Gudrun, had not been so completely erased as to leave
no traces of them; but that they were still sufficiently legible to enable Kostbera to ascertain the real purport
of the communication.



378
14. “Tottering ye will go, if thitherward ye tend. No kind entertainment there will ye at this time find. Högni! I have dreamed, I will not conceal it: in an evil hour ye will go, or so at least I fear.
15. Methought thy coverlet was with fire consumed; that the towering flame rushed through my dwelling.”
Högni 16. “Here lie linen cloths, which thou hadst little noticed: these will quickly burn where thou the coverlet sawest.”
Kostbera 17. “Methought a bear came in, and broke down the columns; and so his talons shook, that we were terror-stricken; by his mouth held many of us, so that we were helpless: there, too, was a din far from little.”
Högni 18. “A tempest there will be furious and sudden: the white bear thou sawest will be a storm from the east.”
Kostbera 19. “Methought an eagle flew herein, all through the house: that will largely concern us. He sprinkled all with blood: from his threats I thought it



379
to be the ‘ham’3 of Atli.”
Högni 20. “We often slaughter largely, and then red we see: often are oxen meant, when we of eagles dream. Sound is the heart of Atli, dream thou as thou mayest.” With this they ended: all speeches have an end. ******************************
21. The high-born awoke, there the like befell: Glaumvör had perceived that her dreams were ill-boding, adverse to Gunnar’s going to and fro.
22. “Methought a gallows was for thee erected,4 thou wentest to be hanged, that serpents ate thee, that I inter’d thee living, that the Powers’ dissolution came Divine thou what that portends.
23. Methought a bloody glave from thy sark was drawn ill ‘tis such a dream to a consort to recount methought a lance was thrust through thy middle: wolves howled on every side.”
3. Ham (hamr. fem. hamingja) a gaurdian angel, an attendant spirit.
4. Here a gallows in our sense of the word, but usually a stake on a scaffold, to which the condemned to a
death of torture was bound hand and foot.



380
Gunnar 24. “Where dogs run they are wont to bark: oft bodes the bay of dogs the flight of javelins.”
Glaumvör 25. “Methought a river ran herein, through the whole house, that it roared violently, rushed o’er the benches, brake the feet of you brothers twain; nothing the water spared: something will that portend!
26. Methought dead women in the night came hither; not ill-clad were they: they would choose thee, forthwith invited thee to their seats. I ween thy Dísir have forsaken thee.”
Gunnar 27. “Too late it is to speak, it is now so resolved; from the journey we shall not shrink, as it is decreed to go: very probable it seems that our lives will be short.” ***************************
28. When colours were discernible, those on journey bent all rose up: the others fain would stay them. The five journeyed together, of ‘hús-carls’ there were present twice that number. It was ill devised



381
Snævar and Sólar, they were Högni’s sons; Orkning he was named, who them accompanied, a gentle shield-bearer was he, the brother of Högni’s wife.
29. They went fair-appointed, until the firth them parted: ever would their wives have stayed them, they would not be stayed.
30. Glaumvör then spake, Gunnar’s consort, Vingi she addressed, as to her seemed fitting: “I know not whether ye will requite us as we would: with treachery came the guest, if aught of ill betide.”
31. Then Vingi swore, little spared he himself: “May him the Jötuns have, if towards you he lies! the gallows hold him, if aught against peace he meditates!”
32. Bera took up the word, she of gentle soul: “Sail ye prosperous, and may success attend you: may it be as I pray, and it nothing hinder!”
33. Högni answered he to his kin meant well “Be of good cheer, ye prudent! whatever may befall. Many say the same, though with great difference; for many little care how they depart from home.”



382
34. On each other then they looked before they parted: then, I ween, their fates were severed, and their ways divided.
35. Vigorously they rowed, their bark was well nigh riven; backward bending the waves they beat, ardently plied: their oar-bands were broken, the rowlocks shattered.5
36. A little after I will the end relate they saw the mansion stand that Budli had possessed. Loud creaked the latticed gates, when Högni knocked.
37. Then said Vingi, what he had better not, “Go far from the house, ‘tis perilous to enter; I quickly enticed you to perdition; ye shall forthwith be slain. With fair words I prayed your coming, though guile was under them. But just bide here, while a gallows I prepare.”
38. Högni answered little thought he of yielding, or of aught fearful that was to be proved: “Think not to frighten us; try that seldom. If one word thou addest, thou wilt thy harm prolong.”
5. So great was their haste to land.



383
39. They rushed on Vingi, and struck him dead, laid on their axes, while life within him throbbed.
40. Atli his men assembled, in their byrnies they issued forth, went prepared so that a fence was between them. Words they bandied, all with rags boiling: “Already had we resolved to take your lives away.”
Högni 41. “It looks but ill, if ye before have counseled: e’en now ye are unprepared, and we one have felled, smitten to death: one of your host was he.”
42. Furious they became, when those words they heard; their fingers they stretched forth, and their bow-strings seized; sharply shot, and with shields themselves protected.
43. In then came the tale of what without was passing; loud before the hall they a thrall heard speak.
44. Then incensed was Gudrún, when the sad news she heard: adorned with necklaces, she tore them all asunder; so hurled the silver, that the rings in shivers flew.



384
45. Then she went out, not gently moved the doors; went forth void of fear, and the comers hailed, turned to the Niflungs: that was her last greeting, truth attended it; more words she said:
46. “I sought by symbols to prevent your leaving home, fate may no one resist and yet must you come hither.” Wisely she asked: might they not be appeased? No one consented, all answered no.
47. Saw then the high-born lady that a hard game they played; a deadly deed she meditated, and her robe dashed aside, a naked falchion seized, and her kinsmen’s lives defended: skilful she was in warfare, where her hand she applied.
48. Giuki’s daughter caused two warriors to fall; Atli’s brother she struck down, he must thenceforth be borne so she the conflict managed, that she his foot struck off. Another too she smote, so that he never rose, to Hel she sent him: her hand trembled not.



385
49. A conflict then ensued, which was widely famed, but that excelled all else which Giuki’s sons performed. So ‘tis said the Niflungs, while yet they lived, with swords maintained the fight, corslets rent, helmets hewed, as their hearts prompted.
50. At morning most they fought, until mid-day had passed; all early morn, and the forenoon, ere the fight was ended, the field flowed with blood, until eighteen had fallen: Bera’s two sons, and her brother, had them overcome.
51. Then the fierce Atli spoke, wroth though he was: “‘Tis ill to look around; this is long of you. We were thirty warlike thanes, eleven survive: the chasm is too great. We were five brothers, when Budli died; now has Hel the half, two lie slain.



386
52. “A great affinity I obtained, that I cannot deny, pernicious woman! of which I have no benefit: peace we have seldom had, since thou among us camest. Of kinsmen ye have bereft me, of riches often wronged. To Hel my sister ye have sent; that is to me most bitter.”
Gudrún 53. “This thou callest to mind, Atli! but thou so first didst act: my mother thou didst take, and for her treasures murder; my gifted niece with hunger thou didst cause to perish. Laughable to me it seems, when thou sorrows doest recount. The gods are to be thanked, that it goes ill with thee.”
Atli 54. “Jarls! I exhort you the sorrow to augment of that presumptuous woman: I would fain see it. Strive so to do, that Gudrún may lament. Might I but see that in her lot she joys not!
55. Take ye Högni, and with a knife hack him: cut out his heart: this ye shall do. Gunnar the fierce of soul to a gallows fasten; do the work thoroughly, lure up the serpents.”



387
Högni 56. Do as thou listest, glad I will await it; stout I shall prove myself: I have ere now things much harder proved. Ye had a hindrance while unscathed we were: now are we so wounded that our fate thou mayest command.
57. Beiti spake, he was Atli’s steward Take we Hialli, but Högni let us save. Let us do half the work; he is death-worthy. As long as he lives a slug he will ever be.
58. Terrified was the kettle-watcher the place no longer held him: he could be a whiner, he clomb into every nook: their conflict was his bane, as he the penalty must pay; and the day sad, when he must from the swine die, from all good things, which he had enjoyed.
59. Budli’s cook they took, and the knife brought towards him. Howled the wretched thrall, ere the point he felt; declared that he had time the gardens to manure, the vilest offices to do, if from death he might escape. Joyful indeed was Hialli, could he but save his life.



388
60. Högni all this observed few so act, as for a slave to intercede, that he may escape “Less ‘tis, I say, for me to play this game myself. Why shall we here desire to listen to that screaming?”
61. Hands on the good prince they laid. Then was no option for the bold warriors, the sentence longer to delay. Then laughed Högni; heard the sons of day how he could hold out: torment he well endured!
62. A harp Gunnar took, with his foot-branches touched it. He could so strike it, that women wept, and the men sobbed, who best could hear it. He the noble queen counseled: the rafters burst asunder.
63. There died the noble, at the dawn of day; at the last they caused their deeds to live.
64. Atli thought himself great: over them both he strode, to the sagacious woman told the evil, and bitterly reproached her. “It is now morning, Gudrún! thy loved ones thou hast lost; partly thou art the cause that it has so befallen.”



389
Gudrún 65. Joyful art thou, Atli! slaughter to announce: repentance shall await thee, when thou hast all proved. That heritage shall be left thee that I can tell thee that ill shall never from thee go, unless I also die.
Atli 66. That I can prevent; another course I see, easier by half: the good we oft reject. With slaves I will console thee, with things most precious, with snow-white silver, as thou thyself mayest desire.
Gudrún 67. Of that there is no hope; I will all reject; atonement I have spurned for smaller injuries. Hard I was ever thought, now will that be aggravated. I every grudge concealed, while Högni lived.
68. We were both nurtured in one house; many a play we played, and in the wood grew up; Grimhild us adorned with gold and necklaces; for my brothers’ death never wilt thou indemnify me, nor ever do what shall to me seem good.



390
69. Mens’ too great power women’s lot oppresses; on the knee the hand sinks, if the arms wither; the tree inclines, if its root-fibres are severed. Now, Atli! thou mayest alone over all here command.
70. Most unwise it was, when to this the prince gave credit: the guild was manifest, had he been on his guard. Dissembling then was Gudrún, against her heart she could speak, made herself gay appear, with two shields she played.6
71. A banquet she would prepare, her brothers’ funeral feast; the same would Atli also for his own do.
72. With this they ended; the banquet was prepared; the feasting was too luxurious. The woman great of heart was stern, she warred on Budli’s race; on her spouse she would cruel vengeance wreak.
73. The young ones she enticed, and on a block laid them, the fierce babes were terrified, and wept not, to their mother’s bosom crept, asked what was she was going to do.
6. She played a double game.



391
74. “Ask no questions, both I intend to kill; long have I desired to cut short your days.”
75. “Slay as thou wilt thy children, no one hinders it; thy rage will have short peace, if thou destroyest us in our blooming years, thou desperate woman!” It fell out accordingly: she cut the throats of both.
76. Atli oft inquired whither his boys were gone to play, as he nowhere saw them?
Gudrún 77. Over I am resolved to go, and to Atli tell it. Grimhild’s daughter will not conceal from thee. Little glad, Atli! wilt thou be, when all thou learnest; great woe didst thou raise up, when thou my brothers slewest.
78. Very seldom have I slept since they fell. Bitterly I threatened thee: now I have reminded thee. ‘It is now morning’, saidst thou: I yet it well remember; and it now is eve, when thou the like shalt learn.
79. Thou thy sons hast lost, as thou least shouldest; know that their skulls thou hast had for beer-cups;



392
thy drink I prepared, I their red blood have shed.
80. I their hearts took, and on a spit staked them, then to thee gave them. I said they were of calves, it was long of thee alone thou didst leave none, voraciously didst devour, well didst ply thy teeth.
81. Thy children’s fate thou knowest, few a worse awaits. I have my part performed, though in it glory not.
Atli 82. Cruel was thou, Gudrún! who couldst so act, with thy children’s blood my drink to mingle. Thou hast destroyed thy offspring, as thou least shouldest; and to myself thou leavest a short interval from ill.
Gudrún 83. I could still desire thyself to slay; rarely too ill it fares with such a prince. Thou hast already perpetrated crimes unexampled among men of frantic cruelty, in this world: now thou hast added what we have just witnessed. A great misdeed hast thou committed, thy death-feast thou hast prepared.



393
Atli 84. On the pile thou shalt be burnt, but first be stoned; then wilt thou have earned what thou hast ever sought.
Gudrún 85. Tell to thyself such griefs early to-morrow: by a fairer death I will pass to another light.
86. In the same hall they sat, exchanged hostile thoughts, bandied words of hate: each was ill at ease.
87. Hate waxed in a Hniflung, a great deed he meditated; to Gudrún he declared that he was Atli’s deadly foe.
88. Into her mind came Högni’s treatment; happy she him accounted, if he vengeance wreaked. Then was Atli slain, within a little space; Högni’s son him slew, and Gudrún herself.
89. The bold king spake, roused up from sleep; quickly he felt the wounds, said he no binding needed. “Tell me most truly who has slain Budli’s son. I am hardly treated: of life I have no hope.”



394
Gudrún 90. I, Grimhild’s daughter, will not from thee hide, that I am the cause that thy life passes away; but partly Högni’s son, that thy wounds make thee faint.
Atli 91. To the slaughter thou hast rushed, although it ill beseemed thee; ‘tis bad to circumvent a friend, who well confided in thee. Besought I went from home, to woo thee, Gudrún!
92. A widow thou wast left, fierce thou was accounted, which was no falsehood, as we have proved. Hither home thou camest, us a host of men attended; all was splendid on our journey.
93. Pomp of all kinds was there, of illustrious men, beeves in abundance: largely we enjoyed them. Of all things there was plenty partaken of by many.
94. A marriage gift to my bride I gave, treasures for her acceptance, thralls thrice ten, seven fair female slaves: in such things was honour; silver there was yet more.



395
95. All seemed to thee as it were naught, while the lands untouched lay, which Budli had left me. So didst thou undermine, didst allow me nothing to receive. Thou didst my mother let often sit weeping: with heart content I found not one of my household after.
Gudrún 96. Now, Atli! thou liest, though of that I little reck. Gentle I seldom was, yet didst thou greatly aggravate it. Young brothers ye fought together, among yourselves contended; to Hel went the half from thy house: all went to ruin that should be for benefit.
97. Brothers and sisters we were three, we thought ourselves invincible: from the land we departed, we followed Sigurd. We roved about, each steered a ship; seeking luck we went, till to the east we came.
98. The chief king we slew, there a land obtained, the ‘hersar’ yielded to us; that manifested fear. We from the forest freed him whom we wished harmless, raised him to prosperity who nothing had possessed.



396
99. The Hun king7 died, then suddenly my fortune changed: great was the young wife’s grief, the widow’s lot was hers. A torment to me it seemed to come living to the house of Atli. A hero had possessed me: sad was that loss!
100. Thou didst never from a contest come, as we have heard, where thou didst gain thy cause, or others overcome; ever wouldst thou give way, and never stand, lettest all pass off quietly, as ill beseemed a king.
Atli 101. Gudrún! now thou liest. Little will be bettered the lot of either: we have all suffered. Now act thou, Gudrún! Of thy goodness, and for our honour, when I forth am borne.
Gudrún 102. I a ship will buy, and a painted cist;8 will the winding-sheet well wax, to enwrap thy corse; will think of every requisite, as if we had each other loved.
7. Sigurd.
8. The ancient usage of laying the body in a ship and sending it adrift, seems inconsistent with the later cus
tom of depositing it in a cist or coffin.



397
103. Atli was now a corpse, lament from his kin arose: the illustrious woman did all she had promised. The wise woman would go to destroy herself; her days were lengthened: she died another time.
104. Happy is every one hereafter who shall give birth to such a daughter famed for deeds, as Giuki begat: ever will live, in every land, their oft-told tale, wherever people shall give ear.



398



399
Gudrúnarhvöt: Gudrún’s Incitement
Having slain Atli, Gudrún went to the sea-shore. She went out into the sea, and would destroy herself, but could not sink. She was borne across the firth to the land of King Jonakr, who married her. Their sons were Sörli, Erp, and Hamdir. There was reared up Svanhild, the daughter of Sigurd. She was given in marriage to Jörmunrek the Powerful. With him lived Bikki, who counseled Randver, the king’s son, to take her. Bikki told that to the king, who caused Randver to be hanged, and Svanhild trodden under horses’ feet. When Gudrún heard of this she said to her sons:
1. Then heard I tell of quarrels dire, hard sayings uttered from great affliction, when her sons the fierce-hearted Gudrún, in deadly words, to slaughter instigated. ****************************
2. “Why sit ye here? why sleep life away? why does it pain you not joyous words to speak, now Jörmunrek your sister young in years has with horses trodden, white and black, in the public way, with grey and way-wont Gothic steeds?
3. Ye are not like to Gunnar and the others, nor of soul so valiant, as Högni was. Her ye should seek to avenge, if ye had the courage of my brothers, or the fierce spirit of the Hunnish kings.”



400
4. Then said Hamdir, the great of heart: “Little didst thou care Högni’s deed to praise, when Sigurd he from sleep awaked. They blue-white bed-clothes were red with thy husband’s gore, with death-blood covered.
5. For thy brothers thou didst o’er-hasty vengeance take, dire and bitter, when thou thy sons didst murder. We young ones1 could on Jörmunrek, acting all together, have avenged our sister.
6. Bring forth the arms of the Hunnish kings: thou hast us stimulated to a sword-mote.”
7. Laughing Gudrún to the storehouse turned, the kings’ crested helms from the coffers drew, their ample corslets, and to her sons them bore. The young heroes loaded their horses’ shoulders.
8. Then said Hamdir, the great of heart: “So will no more come his mother to see, the warrior felled in the Gothic land,
1. Themselves and the two sons of Atli.



401
so that thou the funeral-beer after us all my drink, after Svanhild and thy sons.”
9. Weeping Gudrún, Giuki’s daughter, sorrowing went, to sit in the fore-court, and to recount, with tear-worn cheeks, sad of soul, her calamities, in many ways.
10. “Three fires I have known, three hearths I have known, of three consorts I have been borne to the house. Sigurd alone to me was better than all, of whom my brothers were the murderers.
11. Of my painful wounds I might not complain; yet they even more seemed to afflict me, when those chieftains to Atli gave me.
12. My bright boys I called to speak with me; for my injuries I could not get revenge, ere I had severed the Hniflungs heads.
13. To the sea-shore I went, against the Norns I was embittered; I would cast off their persecution; bore, and submerged me not



402
the towering billows; up on land I rose, because I was to live.
14. To the nuptial couch I went as I thought better for me, for the third time, with a mighty king. I brought forth offspring, guardians of the heritage, guardians of the heritage, Jonarkr’s sons.
15. But around Svanhild bond-maidens sat; of all my children her I loved the best. Svanhild was, in my hall, as was the sun-beam, fair to behold.
16. I with gold adorned her, and with fine raiment, before I gave her to the Gothic people. That is to me the hardest of all my woes, that Svanhild’s beauteous locks should in the mire be trodden under horses’ feet.
17. But that was yet more painful, when my Sigurd they ingloriously slew in his bed; though of all most cruel, when of Gunnar the glistening serpents to the vitals crawled; but the most agonizing,

which to my heart flew, when the brave king’s heart they while quick cut out.
18. Many griefs I call to memory, many ills I call to memory. Guide, Sigurd! thy black steed, thy swift courser, hither let it run. Here sits no son’s wife, no daughter, who to Gudrún precious things may give.
19. Remember, Sigurd! what we together said, when on our bed we both were sitting, that thou, brave one, wouldst come to me from Hel’s abode, but I from the world to thee.
20. Raise, ye Jarls! an oaken pile; let it under heaven the highest be. May it burn a breast full of woes! the fire round my heart its sorrows melt!”
21. May all men’s lot be bettered, all women’s sorrow lessened, to whom this tale of woes shall be recounted.

Hamðismal: The Lay of Hamdir.
1. In that court1 arose woeful deeds, at the Alfar's doleful lament;2 at early morn, men's afflictions, troubles of various kinds; sorrows were quickened.
2. It was not now, nor yesterday, a long time since has passed away, few things are more ancient, it was by much earlier when Gudrún, Giuki's daughter, her young sons instigated Svanhild to avenge.
3. "She was your sister, her name Svanhild, she whom Jörmunrek with horses trod to death, on the public way, with grey and way-wont Gothic steeds.
4. Thenceforth all is sad to you, kings of people! Ye alone survive,
5. “Branches of my race. Lonely I am become, as the asp-tree in the forest,
1. See Str. 10, and Ghv. 9, and, Luning, Glossar.
2. The Alfar’s Lament is the early dawn, and is in apposition to “early morn,” in the following line. The swart
Alfar are meant, who were turned to stone if they did not flee from the light of day. This is the best interpreta
tion I can offer of this obscure strophe.



406
of kindred bereft, as the fir of branches; of joy deprived, as is the tree of foliage, when the branch-spoiler comes in the warm day."
6. Then spake Hamdir, the great of soul, "Little, Gudrún! didst thou care Högni's deed to praise, when Sigurd they from sleep awaked. On the bed thou satst, and the murderers laughed.
7. Thy bed-clothes, blue and white, woven by cunning hands, swam in thy husband's gore. When Sigurd perished, o'er the dead thou satst, caredst not for mirth So Gunnar willed it.
8. Atli thou wouldst afflict by Erp's murder, and by Eitil's life's destruction: that proved for thyself the worse: therefore should every one so against others use, a sharp-biting sword, that he harm not himself."
9. Then said Sörli he had a prudent mind "I with my mother will not speeches exchange: though words to each of you to me seem wanting. What, Gudrún! dost thou desire, which for tears thou canst not utter?



407
10. For thy brothers weep, and thy dear sons, thy nearest kin, drawn to the strife: for us both shalt thou, Gudrún! also have to weep, who here sit fated on our steeds, far away to die."
11. From the court they went, for conflict ready. The young men journeyed over humid fells, on Hunnish steeds, murder to avenge.
12. Then said Erp, all at once the noble youth was joking on his horse's back "Ill 'tis to a timid man to point out the ways." They said the bastard3 was over bold.
13. On their way they had found the wily jester. "How will the swarthy dwarf afford us aid?"
14. He of another mother answered: so he said aid he would to his kin afford, as one foot to the other4 (or, grown to the body, one hand the other.)
3. In this and the four following strophes the person alluded to is their half-brother Erp, of whose story
nothing more is known. He, it appears, had preceded or outridden the others.
4. Malmesbury relates a similar story of king Æthelstan and his cupbearer.



408
15. "What can a foot to a foot give; or, grown to the body, one hand the other?"
16. From the sheath they drew the iron blade, the falchion's edges, for Hel's delight. They their strength diminished by a third part, they their young kinsman caused to earth to sink.
17. Their mantles then they shook, their weapons grasped; the high-born were clad in sumptuous raiment.
18. Forward lay the ways, a woeful path they found, and their sister's son wounded on a gibbet, wind-cold outlaw-trees,5 on the town's west. Ever vibrated the ravens' whet: there to tarry was not good.
19. Uproar was in the hall, men were with drink excited, so that the horses’ tramp no one heard, until a mindful man winded his horn.
20. To announce they went to Jörmunrek that were seen helm-decked warriors.
5. Lit. wolf-trees; a fugitive criminal being called vargr wolf.



409
"Take ye counsel, potent ones are come; before mighty men ye have on a damsel trampled."
21. Then laughed Jörmunrek, with his hand stroked his beard, asked not for his corslet; with wine he struggled shook his dark locks, on his white shield looked, and in his hand swung the golden cup.
22. "Happy should I seem, if I could see Hamdir and Sörli within my hall. I would them then With bowstrings bind, The good sons of Giuki on the gallows hang."
23. Then said Hródrglöd, on the high steps standing; "Prince," said she to her son for that was threatened which ought not to happen "shall two men alone bind or slay ten hundred Goths in this lofty burgh?"
24. Tumult was in the mansion, the beer-cups flew in shivers, men lay in blood from the Goths' breasts flowing.
25. Then said Hamdir, the great of heart: "Jörmunrek! thou didst



410
desire our coming, brothers of one mother, into thy burgh;1 now seest thou thy feet, seest thy hands Jörmunrek! cast into the glowing fire.
26. Then roared forth a godlike2 mail-clad warrior, as a bear roars: "On the men hurl stones, since spears bite not, nor edge of sword, nor point, the sons of Jonakr."
27. Then said Hamdir, the great of heart: "Harm didst thou, brother! when thou that mouth didst ope. Oft from that mouth bad counsel comes."
28. "Courage hast thou, Hamdir! if only thou hadst sense: that man lacks much who wisdom lacks.
29. Off would the head now be, had but Erp lived, our brother bold in fight, whom on the way we slew, that warrior brave me the Dísir instigated that man sacred to us, whom we resolved to slay.
6. According to the Skalda it would appear that they cut off his hands and feet while he was asleep. Erp, had
they not murdered him, was to have cut off his head.
7. Odin, as in the Battle of Bravalla.



411
30. I ween not that ours should be the wolves' example, that with ourselves we should contend, like the Norns' dogs, that voracious are in the desert nurtured."
31. "Well have we fought, on slaughtered Goths we stand, on those fallen by the sword, like eagles on a branch. Great glory we have gained, Though now or to morrow we shall die. No one lives till eve against the Norns' decree."
32. There fell Sörli, at the mansion's front; but Hamdir sank at the house's back.
This is called the Old Lay of Hamdir.

Gunnars Slagr: Gunnar's Melody.
1. It of old befell that Gunnar, Giuki's son, was doomed to die In Grábak's halls. The feet were free of the king's son, but his hands were bound with hard bonds.
2. A harp he seized, the warrior king his skill displayed, his foot-branches moved, the harp-strings sweetly touched: that art had not been practised save by the king’s son.
3. Then sang Gunnar, in these strains: the harp got voice, as it had been a man; yet not a sweeter sound, had it been a swan; the hall of serpents echoed to the golden strings:
4. "I my sister know wedded to the worst of men, and to the Niflungs’ base foe espoused. To his home bade Atli Högni and Gunnar, his relations, but murdered both.



414
5. Slaughter he made them take for festivity, and conflict for convivial potations. Ever will that survive while men shall live: so did relations never any one delude.
6. Why, Atli! dost thou so wreak thy anger? Herself did Brynhild cause to die, and Sigurd's cruel death. Why wouldst thou Gudrún cause to weep?
7. Long since the raven told, from the high tree, our calamities, at our relation's death; Brynhild told me, Budli's daughter, how Atli would deceive us both.
8. This also Glaumvör said, when we both reposed, for the last time, in the same bed, my consort had portentous dreams 'Go not Gunnar! Atli is now false to thee.



415
9. A lance I saw red with thy blood, a gallows ready for Giuki's son: I thought for thee the Dísir prepared a feast; I ween that for you brothers treachery is at work.'
10. Said also Kostbera she was Högni's wife the runes were falsely graved, and the dreams interpreted. But the heart beat high In the princes' breast, neither knew fear of a cruel death.
11. The Norns have for us, Giuki's heirs, a life-time appointed, at Odin's will; no one may against fate provide, nor, of luck bereft, in his valour trust.
12. Atli! I laugh that thou hast not the red-gold rings that Hreidmar owned; I alone know where that treasure hidden lies, since that Högni to the heart ye cut.



416
13. Atli! I laugh, that ye Huns the laughing Högni to the heart cut. The Hniflung shrank not from the scooping wound, nor flinched he from a painful death.
14. Atli! I laugh, that thou hast lost many of thy men that choicest were, beneath our swords, before thy own death. Our noble sister has thy brother maimed.
15. Yet shall not Gunnar, Giuki's son, fear express in Grafvitnir's dwelling; nor dejected go to the sire of hosts: Already is the prince inured to suffering.
16. Sooner shall Góin pierce me to the heart, and Nidhögg such my reins, Linn and Lángbak my liver tear, than I will abandon my steadfastness of heart.



417
17. Gudrún it will grimly avenge, that Atli us has both deceived; she to thee, king! will give the hearts of thy cubs, hot at the evening meal;
18. And their blood thou from cups shalt drink formed of their skulls. That mental anguish shall bite thee most cruelly, when Gudrún sets such crimes before thee.
19. Short will be thy life after the princes' death; an ill end thou wilt have, for breach of our affinity: such is befitting thee, through the deed of our sister sorely impelled thy treachery to requite.
20. Gudrún will thee with a lance lay low, and the Niflung stand hard by; in thy palace will the red flame play; then in Náströnd thou shalt be to Nidhögg given.



418
21. Now is Grábak lulled, and Grafvitnir, Góin and Móin, and Grafvöllud, Ofnir and Svafnir, with venom glistening, Nad and Nidhögg, and the serpents all, Hring, Höggvard, by the harp's sound.
22. Alone wakeful remains Atli's mother, she has pierced me to the heart's roots, my liver sucks, and my lungs tears.
23. Cease now, my harp! hence I will depart, and in the vast Valhall abide, with the Æsir drink of costly cups, be with Sæhrimnir sated at Odin's feast.
24. Now is Gunnar's melody all sung out; I have men delighted for the last time. Henceforth few princes will with their foot-branches the sweetly sounding harp-strings strike."

Gróttasöngr: The Lay of Grótti, or The Mill-Song
King Fródi succeeded to the kingdom of Denmark at the time when the emperor Augustus had proclaimed peace over all the world; and as Fródi was the most powerful king in the North, the peace was attributed to him and called Fródi's peace, where-ever the Danish tongue was spoken. When on a visit to king Fiölnir in Sweden, he bought two female slaves, whose names were Fenia and Menia, both of great strength and stature. At this time two mill-stones were found in Denmark so large that no one could drag them. These stones possessed the property of grinding whatever the grinder wished. Fródi set the two slaves to work at the quern, or mill, which was named Grótti and commanded them to grind gold, peace, and prosperity to Fródi; but he allowed them not a moment's rest nor even sleep longer than while the cuckoo was silent, or a song might be sung. They then sang the song called Gróttasöngr, and ceased not before they had ground an army against Fródi, so that in the night a sea-king, named Mýsing, came, slew Fródi, and carried off great booty. Such was the end of Fródi's peace. Mýsing took Grótti, together with Fenia and Menia, and caused white salt to be ground in his ships, until they sank in Pentland Firth. There is ever since a vortex where the sea falls into Grótti's eye; there the sea roars as it (Grótti) roars, and then it was that the sea first became salt. Skalda, edit. Rask, p. 146.
1. Now are come to the king's house two prescient damsels, Fenia and Menia; they are with Fródi, Fridleif 's son, the powerful maidens, in thraldom held.
2. To the mill they both were led, and the grey stone to set a going ordered; he to both forbade rest and solace, before he heard the maidens' voice.
3. They made resound the clattering quern, with their arms swung the light stones. The maidens he commanded yet more to grind.



420
4. They sung and swung the whirling stone, until Fródi's thralls nearly all slept. Then said Menia to the meal 'twas come
5. "Riches we grind for Fródi, all happiness we grind, wealth in abundance, in gladness' mill. On riches may he sit, on down may he sleep, to joy may he wake: then 'tis well ground!
6. Here shall not one another harm, evil machinate, nor occasion death, nor yet strike with the biting sword, although a brother's slayer he find bound."
7. He had not yet said one word before: "Sleep ye not longer than the gowks round the house, or than while one song I sing."
8. "Thou was not, Fródi! for thyself over-wise, or a friend of men, when thralls thou boughtest; for strength thou chosest them, and for their looks, but of their race didst not inquire.



421
9. Stout was Hrúngnir, and his father, yet was Thiassi stronger than they; Idi and Örnir our relations are, brothers of the mountain-giants from whom we are born.
10. Grótti had not come from the grey fell, nor yet the hard stone from the earth; nor so had ground the giant maid, if her race had aught of her known.
11. Nine winters we playmates were, strong and nurtured beneath the earth. We maidens stood at mighty works; ourselves we moved the fast rock from its place.
12. We rolled the stone o'er the giants' house, so that earth thereby shrank trembling; so hurled we the whirling rock, that men could take it.



422
13. But afterwards, in Sweden, we prescient two among people went, chased the bear, and shattered shields; went against a grey-sarked host, aided one prince, another overthrew, afforded the good Guthrom help. Quiet I sat not ere we warriors felled.
14. Thus we went on all those winters, so that in conflicts we were known; there we carved, with our sharp spears, blood from wounds, and reddened brands.
15. Now are we come to a king's house, unpitied both, and in thraldom held; gravel gnaws our feet, and above 'tis cold; a foe's host we drew. Sad 'tis at Fródi's!
16. Hands must rest, the stone shall stand still; for me I have my portion ground. To hands will not rest be given, until Fródi thinks enough is ground.



423
17. Hands shall hold falchions hard, the weapon slaughter-gory. Wake thou, Fródi! wake thou, Fródi! if thou wilt listen to our songs and sagas old.
18. Fire I see burning east of the burgh; tidings of war are rife: that should be a token; a host will forthwith hither come, and the town burn over the king.
19. Thou wilt not hold the throne of Lethra, rings of red gold, or mighty mill-stone. Let us ply the winch, girl! yet more rapidly; are we not grown up in deadly slaughter?
20. My father's daughter has stoutly ground, because the fate of many men she saw. Huge fragments spring from the mill-stone into the Örnefiörd. Let us grind on!



424
21. Let us grind on! Yrsa's son, Hálfdan's kinsman, will avenge Fródi: he will of her be called son and brother: we both know that."
22. The maidens ground, their might applied; the damsels were in Jotun-mood, the axes trembled; the stone fell from above, the ponderous rock was in shivers split.
23. But the mountain-giants’ maiden said; “Frodi! we have ground; together we cease, the maidens have stood at the grinding long.”
