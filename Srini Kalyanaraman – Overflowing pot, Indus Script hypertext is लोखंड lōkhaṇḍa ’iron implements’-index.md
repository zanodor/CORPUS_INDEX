The streams of water flowing the naked, bearded person are the signature tune of the times in Ancient Near East. This glyptic or overflowing pot held by Gudea, appears on hundreds of cylinder seals and friezes of many sites. Overflowing water from a pot is a recurrent motif in Sumer-ElamMesopotamian contact areas – a motif demonstrated to be of semantic significance in the context of lapidary-metallurgy life activity of the artisans.

Limestone tablet: the scene sculptured in relief at the head of the tablet represents Nabu-aplu-iddina being led by the priest Nabu-nadin-shum and the goddess Aa into the presence of the Sun-god, who is seated within Ebabbara. Before the god is the solar disc, resting upon an altar which is supported by ropes held by attendant deities, whose bodies spring from the roof of the shrine. In the field above the Sun-god, and within the shrine, are a lunar disc, a solar disc and an eight-pointed star, the symbols of Sin, Shamash and Ishtar. The god wears a horned headdress and carries the ringed rod in his right hand. The shrine is represented as resting on the heavenly ocean. The engraved text contains a record of Nabu-apla-iddina's re-endowment of the Sun-Temple at Sippar. The inscription is engraved in six columns, three upon the obverse and three upon the reverse; and the upper part of the obverse is occupied by a scene sculptured in low relief; the edges of the tablet are bevelled.

Fig. 33 Urnamma stela. Borker-Klahn's reconstruction
On the Urmamma Stela, she is hovering over the offering of flowing water to the ruler by the enthroned deity. In this scene the goddess underlines the gift bestowed on the ruler, and figures as a personification of it, while on the seal she may have implied and guaranteed that the petitioner who offers an antelope (?) is pleading for and will receive blessings of abundance in return. The basin of Gudea is dedicated to Ningirsu, and may be understood as a plea for prosperity as well as a boast of its successful outcome."(Claudia E. Suter, 2000, Gudea's Temple Building: the representation of an early Mesopotamian Ruler in text and image, BRILL., II.c.i.d, pp. 62-63).
Duplicated hieroglyph shown on the central register of Ur-Nammu stela.

Greenstone cylinder seal. A hunting god (full-face) has a bow and an arrow (?) over his shoulder; a quiver with
tassel attached hangs on his back. On the left hand mountain stands a small tree and Ishtar (full-face) who is
winged and armed with weapons including an axe and a mace rising from her shoulders. She is holding a bush-like
object, probably a bunch of dates, above the sun-god's head. The sun-god Shamash with rays, holding a serrated
blade, is just begining to emerge from between two square topped moutains. The water god Ea stands to the right
with one foot placed on the right hand mountain. He stretches out his right hand towards an eagle, probably the Zu
bird who stole the tablets of destiny. A couchant bull lies between his legs and streams of water and fish flow from
his shoulders. Behind him stands his two-faced attendant god Usimu with his right hand raised. All wear the
multiple-horned head-dresses of deities. The male figures are bearded and Usimu has a double beard and wears a
flounced skirt. Ea and Ishtar both wear flounced robes and the fourth complete figure wears a striped skirt which
either has a cod-piece or is hitched up in front. This god wears his hair in a long curl down the left side,
reminiscent of those worn by bull-men and Ishtar has two similar curls hanging down, one on either side, while Ea
and Shamash wear their hair in a triple bun. The scales of the mountain are continued in a horizontal band all round
the lower part of the seal and it is on this band that the figures are standing. There is a two line inscription in a
frame and below it a lion is pacing towards the right and roaring. The cylinder is slightly concave in
shape.https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1891-0509-2553

water from shoulders
Adda cylinder seal
The two hieroglyphs show an identical palm frond with two hanging twigs or fronds as the centerpiece of an altar in front of both the male and female divinities. The male divinity is a builder holding a staff and bob plumb bob as perceptively noted by Jenny Vorys Canby whose painstaking researches resulted in a reasonable reconstruction of missing fragments of the stela. A major missing part unearthed by Canby is another hieroglyph: overflowing pots pouring into the center-piece altars with the palm fronds.

The decipherment of the three hieroglyphs: 1. duplicated frond, 2. palm frond and 3. overflowing pot will provide a framework for unraveling the central message of the Ur-Nammu stela which is a monumental 10 feet high stela which surely shows builders at work in the bottom registe. The central message is the material resources with which the builders were working -- as conveyed by a rebus reading of the three hieroglyphs: metalcastings, metalware.

The Iconography of Inana/Ištar is as varied as her characteristics. In early iconography she is represented by a reed bundle/gatepost Frankfort 1939: 15; Szarzyńska 2000: 71, Figs. 4-5), which is also the written form of her name in very early texts (Black and Green 1998: 108). The uppermost register of the famous Uruk Vase shows the goddess in anthropomorphic form, standing before two such gateposts (Black and Green 1998: 150, Fig.122). In human form as the goddess of sexual love, Inana/Ištar is often depicted fully nude. In Syrian iconography, she often reveals herself by holding open a cape. The nude female is an extremely common theme in ancient Near Eastern art, however, and although variously ascribed to the sphere of Inana/Ištar (as acolytes or cult statuettes), they probably do not all represent the goddess herself. A sound indication of divine status is the presence of the horned cap. In her warrior aspect, Inana/Ištar is shown dressed in a flounced robe with weapons coming out of her shoulder, often with at least one other weapon in her hand and sometimes with a beard, to emphasize her masculine side. Her attribute animal as the goddess of war is the lion, on the back of which she often has one foot or fully stands. In praise of her warlike qualities, she is compared to a roaring, fearsome lion (see Inana and Ebih, ETCSL 1.3.2). In her astral aspect, Inana/Ištar is symbolized by the eight-pointed star. The colours red and carnelian, and the cooler blue and lapis lazuli, were also used to symbolise the goddess, perhaps to highlight her female and male aspects respectively (Barret 2007: 27)...Inana/Inanna is the Sumerian name of this goddess. It is most often etymologically interpreted as nin.an.a(k), literally "Lady of the heavens" (Selz 2000: 29). A different interpretation (Jacobsen 1976: 36) translates her name as "Lady of the date clusters." The Semitic name Ištar originally belonged to an independent goddess that was later merged and identified with the Sumerian Inana (Abusch 2000: 23). http://oracc.museum.upenn.edu/amgg/listofdeities/inanaitar/

standing on only one leg”, according to the Śivapurāṇa 2.3.15 (“The penance and reign of
Tārakāsura”).—Accordingly, as Brahmā narrated: “[...] For a hundred years he [Tāraka]
performed penance with his hands lifted up, standing on only one leg [i.e., ekapāda] and
gazing at the sun. With his mind steady and firm he observed all sacred rites. Then for a
hundred years, the lord and king of Asuras, Tāraka performed the penance: stood steady
touching the ground with the single big toe. For hundred years he performed penance by
drinking only water; another hundred years by sustaining himself on air alone, another
hundred years standing in water and another hundred years standing on dry land. [...]”.
