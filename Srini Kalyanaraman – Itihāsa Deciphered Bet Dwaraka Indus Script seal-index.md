Jangid is a Brahmin jāti (caste) in India, particularly Haryana, Rajastha and Punjab historically known for carpentry, especially woodcarving and furniture making. Today, the Jangid are usually known for painting and decorative works such as making seats or chariots for religious figurines. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jangid_Brahmin Jangada Maria do Carmo Andrade

It can be said that a raft is a frame made of wood from a ship to rescue the castaways; construction in the form of a wooden grid for transport over water; typical vessel of fishermen in



the North and Northeast of Brazil, usually made of five round sticks, solidly connected with each other and with a mast. It was in India that the Portuguese saw a small vessel called janga. There were three or four sticks tied with vegetable fibers or secured with grid-shaped wood. The most popular types in Northeast Brazil, which is a traditional region for the use of rafts, are the boat, the paddock and the large raft. The biggest one is seven clubs and, exceptionally, there are some ten clubs. The most popular is the six, although the historical model was four clubs.
Various types of wood are used in the construction of the raft, especially the stick-of-raft or mulungu, tiliácea, apeíba, tibourbou and others. The raft must be built in the water, so that the sticks do not break with the immersion, nails are not allowed, they can rust and damage the wood, causing accidents.
The crew of the small rafts is formed by the master and the helper. In the larger ones, the crew reaches four men: the master, who commands the vessel; the boatman, who holds the raft rope and wets the sail when it goes from the land to the high seas; bow-beak, which waters the sail when the raft comes from the sea to the land; and the contra-nozzle, (which is called rebique, in Ceará) is the fisherman who is in the most anterior part of the raft during the fisheries.
To divide the fish, the crew usually mark the fish. Unbranded (whole) fish are from the master, those cut at one end of the tail are from the sow, those cut from the entire tail are from the bowhead, and the fish streaked on the head are from the back-beak.
The expression putting on the tide means going, traveling, going fishing and sailing, it means going back.
The raft, although considered the oldest vessel, still exists with the same purpose and keeps the same characteristics of the primitive raft. Updated Sept. 9, 2009 http://basilio.fundaj.gov.br/pesquisaescolar/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=3 79&Itemid=1
