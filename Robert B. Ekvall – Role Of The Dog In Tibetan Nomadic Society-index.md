Role Of The Dog In Tibetan Nomadic Society by Robert B. Ekvall Seattle
This Article appeared originally in the Central Asiatic Journal, Vol. III, No. 3, September 3 , 1963
The role of the dog in Tibetan nomadic society has many aspects; some of them the obvious, and what one would expect in any society – aid in hunting, watchdog functions, etc., -and others which are quite the reverse of the obvious; which relate to social integration, and to influences affecting the development of personality within a culture. In any case the role of the dog is of surprising importance and is well worth some attention. Before discussing, however, the role of the dog in Tibetan nomadic society, the position of the dog in Tibetan society as a whole should be noted and some account should be taken of Tibetan attitudes in general toward dogs.
In many Asian Societies the dog is despised and quite literally is an outcast; barely tolerated as a scavenger. This is particularly so in Islamic societies where the unbeliever was stigmatized as a "dog" but was also true in traditional China where, except for the toy spaniels which became somewhat of status symbols and those dogs which were bred and fattened for food, the life of the dog was a miserable one. The Chinese have an extensive repertoire of invectives which begin with the word "dog", and Chinese living in the border areas between China and Tibet in moments of exasperation derive satisfaction in calling the Tibetans "dog headed barbarians".
Among the Tibetans, on the other hand, the dog is favored and even honored in tradition, in symbolism and in real life. The year of the dog is the year of good harvests and among the twelve animals by which the years are named the dog ranks with the tiger and the horse as the most auspicious. As an omen he is good and he is credited with the special sight – the ability to see ghosts and demons – and thus his outcries have peculiar significance. Mi La, the Tibetan poetsaint, told his disciple, Ras CHung, that the dogs the latter saw in his dream represented KHaa aGro Ma(sky going females), or the celestial courtesans of Tantric doctrine.' In some of the religious dances only dog masks are permitted and in doctrinal discourse the neophyte is urged to be toward his spiritual teacher like a dog is toward his master: faithful and loyal; with no touch of resentment no matter how harshly treated.
For the earliest Chinese one set of barbarians, the Ti, who were bracketed with the Ch'iang and later were incorporated into the Tibetan empire, were represented in ideographic writing by the symbols of dog and fire combined; and the Chinese chroniclers of the eight century, in proper civilized scorn, write about the Tibetans that "when they honor their leaders they bark like dogs". 2 The Tibetans, on the other hand, see nothing amiss for the dog to be by the fire when he does

not need to be on guard, and seem to feel no self-consciousness or embarrassment in explaining that Tibetans show their tongues in greeting just as dogs show their affection by licking the hands of their masters and those whom they like. Nor do they feel demeaned by comparing themselves to dogs, for dogs are creatures whom they like and even respect.
Like all people who consider dogs individuals, and not just anonymous animals, the Tibetans give their dogs personal names. Some of these names are combinations of the word rGya, which can have anyone of a number of meanings, chief of which is "expanse" or "big one" , with color and other designations such as rGya Ser (big one yellow), rGya dMar (big one red), rGya Bo Mig bZHi (the big one eyes four), rGya sBrug (big one dragon), rGya dGe (big one virtue). Other names are names of animals followed by the diminutive of endearment PHrug (young one); such as Dom PHrug (black bear young one), sPang PHrug (wolf young one) and Seng PHrug (lion young one). But a great many of the dogs are called by religious names which in the religion oriented culture of the Tibetans is a good indication of their status and how they are regarded. They may be called Sangs rGyas (the Buddhahood), Don aGrub (realization of causes) – which is a personal name of Buddha, sGroI Ma (savior female), or the Tara goddess, and bKra SHis (blessing).
The attitude of liking and even respect is even more pronounced among the nomadic pastoralists of the Tibetan plateau. Without undue sentiment – although the womenfolk and children give the growing puppies much affection – they accord dogs recognition as companions and acknowledge their value as allies in meeting a common danger. They are cared for and treated very much as

equals. When they are exercising their guard function they have clearly defined rights as to how they may and may not be treated; what weapons may be used against them and what weapons may not be used, unless indeed one is prepared to become embroiled with the owners. Stones, staves, whips and weighted ropes, the butt end of spears and the back of swords – even, with good wrist work, to the taking out of a tooth or giving of a toothache – may be used: but edged weapons, spear points, and above all firearms, even if only fired in the air may not be used. The position and value of the dog is most clearly stated in the Tibetan proverb which says "The three most excellent possessions of the wilderness one are his gun, his horse and his dog."
The livestock which the Tibetan nomads rear and keep are, in the cycle of production, "fields on the hoof' which are tended in expectation of a harvest in milk, meat, wool, hair, hides and the annual increase. Dogs are not a part of these "fields on the hoof'. Their flesh is not eaten. The Tibetan profess the utmost abhorrence of the very idea and enjoy throwing back at the Chinese an epithet which includes the word "dog"; calling them KHyii SHa Za mKHan (dog meat eaters). Dogs are not reared for their pelts or for sale, although a few skins of those which have died or have been killed by enemies are offered for sale and occasionally a nomad will sell a dog, invariably getting moreover a good price, more as a favor than for gain. But it is also true that most of the dogs which are found throughout Tibet come from the land of the tents where greater availability of protein foods such as buttermilk, whey from cheese making, scraps of meat and the carcasses of stock which have died, favor the rearing of dogs. No nomad, however, wants the reputation of being a trader in dogs.
Only the relatively few dogs which are used in hunting make any direct contribution to the income of their owners. Nor do dogs contribute to mobility, for their use as draft animals as among the circumpolar peoples or as the travois-pulling dogs of the Plains Indians, prior to the time the latter acquired the horse, has never been reported. At moving time all that is expected of dogs is that they should carry their own weight, and occasionally the puppies even must be packed on loads or stuffed into saddle bags.
Nevertheless, they are highly valued and well treated for themselves and for the obvious roles they fulfill. In those roles they are accomplices in the subsidiary subsistence techniques of hunting, and in the primary subsistence techniques of animal husbandry they are creators of security – precarious at times but greatly needed. In addition to these two obvious roles there are other roles which the dogs fulfill of which the Tibetans have slight, if any, appreciation yet which are of great importance. They function to create privacy and social distance in a situation where both privacy and social distance are a felt need. They help shape the behavior patterns of the children of the tents and thus influence character formation. And finally, although the dog is one of the "three excellent possessions of the wilderness one," yet as the peculiar pets of the womenfolk and as pitted again the horse, by the threat they pose to the mounted man, they counterbalance the arrogance of the male on horseback.
The role of hunting dogs was of much greater importance in earlier periods of Tibetan history than at the present time. The general term for hunting dog is Ra KHyi (corral dog) for his function is to fence in weak game and to bring to bay and from a right around big and strong game. Folk tales

and legends which are over a thousand years old stress the use ofrGya (dogs(s», SHa KHyi (meat dog(s» and Ri KHyi (mountain dogs(s» in coursing the stag and surrounding game. Marco Polo also speaks of "mastiffs as big as donkeys which are capital at seizing wild beasts (in particular the wild oxen)". In the well-known encounter between mGon Po rOo de the hunter and Mi La, the poet-saint of the eleventh century, the Red Bitch figures prominently in the chase of the Black Stag, but eventually is converted to the gentle doctrine of seeking the benefit of all living creatures.
In modern times the pervasive influence of that gentle doctrine, and Buddhist scruples against the taking of life, have reinforced older fears of the aboriginal hunt gods, who object to poaching among their prized and jealously guarded herds of wildlife, and consequently, hunting as a subsidiary subsistence technique, has declined in importance. Along with that decline the number of hunting dogs kept among the nomads has been much reduced and the importance of their role has lessened. In some areas a few rangy prick-eared dogs – mostly fawn or brindle – are kept for tracking stag of musk deer. They are called SHa KHyi (meat dogs(s» which is a somewhat general term for hunting dogs, and sometimes more specifically SHwa KHyi (stag dogs).

They vary greatly in pelage, conformation and size for the breed is not at all pure. In a Golok tribe which I visited in the summer of 1940 I saw quite a number of slender greyhound type dogs which had certain resemblances to both borzois and salukis and came in rather unusual [colors?] such as light fawn, ivory and pale ash grey. They were considered useless as watchdogs but, as their name Wa KHyi (fox dog) indicates, were kept for hunting foxes.
The watchdogs, called Srung KHyi (guard dogs(s» or sGo KHyi (door dog(s», on the other hand are extremely numerous among the nomadic pastoralists. There is no tent which does not have at least two, and chiefs or wealthy men may own twenty or more. In one small encampment of six tents where I visited for several weeks there were twenty-one dogs – averaging three and one half dogs per tent. They are two varieties or breeds: the true Tibetan mastiff – which is somewhat rare – and another equally ferocious and almost equally large mongrel.
The latter undoubtedly has, among other strains, more or less mastiff blood.
The mastiffs, known variously as Sang KHyi (Sang (breed name) dog(s» or gTSang KHyi (dogs of Tsang) constitute what Tibetans call a "bone line" and considerable efforts are made to keep the breed pure. Their possession is somewhat of a status symbol; it is very difficult to find one for sale; and if found the price is usually that of a good horse. They have the typical heavy muzzle, high domed head, hanging lips, the red of the eyelid showing and massive forequarters of the mastiff breed. The rather long tail is somewhat lightly feathered and carried in a loose curl. In color they are usually black – always so if considered pure bred – with tan trim on the face, neck and legs, usually some white on the throat and chest, and a tan spot over each eye; from which they get the name Mig bZHi Can (four eyed one(s)). As to size, the one I had weighed 160 pounds. Their most distinctive characteristic is an incredibly heavy baying bark much more like the sound of a fog horn than the outcry of any animal.
The mongrel watchdogs, which are by far the more numerous, are little, if any smaller than the mastiffs and quite as ferocious. But in their bark they do not have quite the foghorn quality of tone which distinguishes the true mastiff. In coloration they exhibit greater diversity; ranging from pure black to grey wolf color and even an occasional white one. Their pelage is somewhat longer than that of the mastiffs, they have somewhat wider and flatter heads with more pointed muzzles, and the heavily feathered tail is carried in a tight curl over the back.
Both varieties are used only as watchdogs and although a dog may occasionally follow the herdsman for the day they are not trained as sheep and cattle dogs to drive and herd livestock. In an incidental fashion they act as scavengers always hungrily on hand when the butchering is being done. Whenever the stock die in unusual numbers from disease or in the heavy snows of late spring the dogs feast to repletion. Their proper function in life, however, is as watchdogs, and as such they are savage and alert. Their mission in life, as defined by the Tibetans, is to "guard wealth against beasts of prey and thieves" and to the fulfillment of this mission they bring vigilance and ferocity. Indeed, they are so fierce that some of them are castrated to heighten their vigilance

but also to lessen their ferocity and make them less likely to charge into a spear point or wildly swinging sword, and get hurt.
During the day they range the perimeter of the encampment as a pack, although the composition of the pack changes for dogs drop out and join it as it moves around. The dogs which belong to each tent keep fairly close to that tent, and any dog which gets too far away finds himself among more enemies than friends, and in trouble. They make it impossible for anyone to get near to or within the circle of the encampment without that approach being known; and unless the one who comes is very much of an expert in the only effective technique a horseman can use against the dogs, that approach is soon halted.
A man on foot may use a staff, throw stones and, at very close quarters, use the back of his sword; but the man on horseback must rely on whirling a rope with a weight on one [end]. The rope may be the long lead rope of the horse's bridle or any rope which is handy. The weight may be a wooden or horn whip handle, a tent peg, a bone or any other similar weight. The roped is whirled so the weight swings around to make a circle; and a twelve foot length – which is about the maximum which can be handled by a rider protecting himself and his mount – thus creates a sort of charmed circle, about twenty-four feet in diameter, of safety for himself and his horse as long as he can keep the weight swinging and the rope does not get tangled under his horse's neck or tail, or around the gun, with its long forked rest, which he carries on his back. Nor should he hit too squarely one of the snapping, lunging dogs on the circumference of the circle, for then the rhythm of the swing will be broken. When coolly and efficiently done this maneuver will keep the dogs – except for the occasional maniac animal which rushes in regardless of rope, spear or sword – at bay indefinitely when riding through an encampment, or when waiting on the outskirts for reaction, permission or welcome from the members of the nearest tent.

All legitimate approach to tent or encampment is based, however, on the assumption or hope that eventually friends or someone will come to the rescue and stand off the dogs: thus permitting final arrival at the tent door. Once welcomed and accepted as guest the stranger must stay warily within the tent – on rare occasions even there he may be in danger of a sneak attack – and he can only move outside when he is escorted and protected by the owners of the dogs. When they escort him they too must change as he moves around the encampment for the dogs of each tent only recognize the members of their own tent family; barely tolerating even next door neighbors who must exercise caution in approaching the neighboring tent.
At night the encampment is given over to the dogs who redouble their vigilance and ring the tents with sound and fury, which dies down at times to querulous bickering only to break out into a roar of suspicion at any unusual sound or sign of movement, as they rush from place to place. The men who have their sleeping places on the perimeter of the encampment sustain an oddly symbiotic relationship with the dogs in the maintenance of this vigil: their occasional shouts, and once in a while a shot into the air, stimulate the dogs, and the dogs in turn keep the men in an uneasy state of half wakefulness. Thus together they build a defense – sensitive as a burglar alarm which moreover has teeth – against thieving and surprise attack.
Not is the menace of the dogs all bark and no bite. On occasions all precautions fail and people get bitten; sometimes even killed. Three times during the eight years I lived in Amdo I learned of a rider who, for one reason or another, was not able to keep the protective rope whirling and the dogs, getting in close quarters, sought to hamstring the horse which panicked and bolted; bucking wildly. In each instance the rider was thrown – for one his saddle girth broke and for another his horse stumbled and fell – and falling in the midst of the dogs never got to his feet.
It is not only strangers who run such risks. Members of an encampment – both adults and children – may get severely bitten right in their own encampment. In my experience, next to sword wounds, dog bites were the most frequent occasion for requests for first-aid. Such accidents may be regretted and may arouse a certain amount of ill feeling, but an attack by dogs which results even in a death does not lead to a feud and reprisal, such as would follow the killing of anyone in a sudden brawl or by accidental gunfire.
