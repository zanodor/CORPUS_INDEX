# Index for Tom van Bakel – The seven men of Eshtar depicted on a ANE cylinder seal.pdf

The seven men of Eshtar depicted on a ANE cylinder seal
I was trying to write an essay that showed why it was so difficult to identify characters and animals depicted on cylinder seals from the Ancient Near East. It turned out that there was little standard symbolism: for example, scorpions could represent at least 5 different deities. This essay expanded more and more and led me to investigate the following imprint as well. Although the result was not at all what I expected, I found it so surprising that I decided to publish it anyway.
Kalki Ubil-Eshtar
The original cylinder seal belonged to the writer Kalki. We know this because the inscription reads: 'Kalki, a scribe and servant of Ubil-Eshtar, brother of the king'. It is clear that this inscription mentions the name 'Eshtar', which usually means that the whole scene has something to do with this goddess. Although she herself is not depicted here, I think that these seven men play a part in one of her myths, namely in the 'Descent Of Inanna' (Eshtar and Inanna are two names of the same goddess). One of the reasons why I think so is that in this myth number seven appears several times:
o In seven cities Inanna abandoned her temple to descend to the underworld. o She gathered together the seven me. o She had to pass the seven gates of the underworld. o And the galla seized Dumuzi by the thighs and they poured milk out of his seven churns.
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein - Kramer
What I actually want to say in many words is in fact already shown here. Although one can imagine that ‘the seven cities', 'the seven me', ‘the seven gates' and ‘the seven churns' are related to each other, number 'seven' has no fixed symbolic value as it is linked to completely different qualities.

I think that Eshtar and her seven men are related to Sirius as well as the following constellations:

http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
You can read that two of these constellations are directly linked to Ishtar (another name of Eshtar), besides that, it appears that Virgo, Cancer and Gemini can be linked to this goddess too.

We start with Virgo, called ‘Seed-Furrow’ in Babylon:

Dendera Zodiac, Louvre Paris
The Dendera Zodiac features a goddess with a bow and arrow. This is a constellation called ‘The Bow’ in Babylonia, it is the elamite of Ishtar:
7 The Bow (BAN), the elamite d.Ishtar, the daughter of d.Enlil {part of Hydra}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Number 1
Shara the son of Inanna
On the far left of the imprint is Shara, Inanna's beloved son. He is a warrior and with his bow and arrow he is situated in this Bow constellation:
He is mentioned in the myth 'Descent Of Inanna': he sings hymns for his mother Inanna, cuts her nails and smooths her hair:
Descent Of Inanna
In Umma, at the holy shrine, Shara the son of Inanna, was dressed in a soiled sackcloth. When he saw Inanna surrounded by the galla, he threw himself in the dust at her feet. The galla said: 'Walk on to your city, Innana, we will take Shara in your place.' Inanna cried: 'No! Not Shara! He is my son who sings hymns to me. He is my son who cuts my nails and smooths my hair. I will never give Shara to you.'
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein - Kramer
The galla want to take him in Inanna’s place, but his mother will never give him to them.



Here is Shara again. He is an archer as he ‘shoots forth with barbed arrows like a sunbeam, shoot forth with reed-arrows like moonlight':
Lugalbanda and the Anzud bird ‘Like Šara, Inana's beloved son, shoot forth with your barbed arrows like a sunbeam, shoot forth with reed-arrows like moonlight!

As you can see, he has a special hairstyle as he ‘arranges the hair at the nape of the neck’:
The temple hymns
303-310. O E-bur-sigsig (House with beautiful bowls) set up under heaven, mighty banqueting hall, fulfilling (?) the commands, abundance of the midst of the sea in ......, at whose holy ...... there is entreaty and joy. The faithful man has enlarged E-maḫ (Magnificent house), the house of Šara, for you in plenty. Your house E-maḫ -- whose prince is the princely son of the Mistress -continues (?) in good fortune, an area of abundance and well-being.
311-313. The one who arranges the hair at the nape of the neck, with the
gaze of a wild cow, Šara, who ...... good things, the son who allots the divine powers to his mother, has erected a house in your precinct, O house Umma, and taken his seat upon your dais. 314. 11 lines: the house of Šara in Umma.

Apparently he is attracted to hair as he is the one who smooths over his mother's hair. besides that, he cuts her nails and sings to her too:
Descent Of Inanna Inanna cried: 'No! Not Shara! He is my son who sings hymns to me. He is my son who cuts my nails and smooths my hair. I will never give Shara to you.'
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein - Kramer
According to the next balbale his father is An, the god of heaven:
A balbale to Šara 1-33. 29 lines missing 1 line fragmentary ...... great radiance ....... Šara, the song praising you befits you. Šara, your divine powers are most precious; Father An, who has engendered you ....... 34-45. Your own mother, holy Inana, has let you sit with her on the holy ....... ...... she is the Mistress.

Sirius (alpha Canis Maioris) is also relevant to us. In Mesopotamia this star is called ‘The Arrow’, ‘The Lance’ or ‘The Spear’:

http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Lulal a son of Inanna
Lulal, another son of Inanna, is standing next to his brother Shara. He is a warrior too. Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what he holds in his hand, it can be a large reed-arrow or a small spear. It can even be a thin mace. Nevertheless, he is situated in Sirius: together with the cultic attendants he is lined up for Inanna beside the dogs (Canis Minor and Canis Major: [Sirius is the biggest star of Canis Major]):
A hymn to Inana as Ninegala
Lulal stands by your feet, bearing in battle the pitiless (?) mace. Beside them the cultic attendants stand at your service, lined up for you beside the dogs.
The galla want to take him too, but Inanna will never give her son away:
Descent Of Inanna
The galla said: 'Walk on, Inanna, we will accompany you to Badtibira.' In Badtibira, at the holy shrine, Lulal, the son of Inanna, was dressed in a soiled sackcloth. When he saw Inanna surrounded by the galla, he threw himself in the dust at her feet. The galla said: 'Walk on, Inanna, we will take Lulal in your place.' Inanna cried: 'No, not Lulal. he is my son. He is a leader among men. He is my right arm. He is my left arm. I will never give Lulal to you’.
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein - Kramer
In the sky map Šara and Lulal are not situated next to each other but in the above imprint they are, as they are brothers.

The next constellation relevant to us is Cancer, which is called ‘The River Crayfish’ in the Babylonian calendar:
7 The River Crayfish (AL.LUL), domicile (shu-bat d.Anim) of d.Anu. {Cancer}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
From the following table we can conclude that Tammuz, the spouse of Eshtar, is the presiding deity of this constellation:

Dumuzi
In Sumer Tammuz is called Dumuzi which means ‘true’ or ‘loyal’ ‘son’ and thus he is depicted as a beardless youngster in the above imprint. They made him stand up and they gashed him with axes:
She uttered against him the cry of guilt. 'Take him away! Take Dumuzi away!' The galla, who know no food, who know no drink, who eat no offerings, who drink no libations, Who accept no gifts, seized Dumuzi. They made him stand up; they made him sit down. They beat the husband of Inanna. They gashed him with axes.

The next constellation of interest to us is Gemini:
5 The Large Twins (MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL), d.Lugalgirra (plague god?) and d.Meslamtaea. (Nergal.) {‘End’ rather than large}; Bottom stars of Gemini}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Gemini Gemini
Dumuzi walks between two men who both wear beards, they both hold an axe, they both are dressed in robes with flounces of the same fabric. In addition, they have the same pose and look in the same direction: therefore these two persons represent Gemini.
In the following table we can see that the moon god Suen is the presiding deity of this constellation:

(Gemini) Sivan May/June
The moon god is the father of Inanna as well as of the sun god Utu:
A hymn to ‘Inanna as Ninegala’
‘Inanna, you are the lady of the great divine powers. Your mother Ningal ...... great attributes. Your father Suen ...... great holy cows. Your brother, the youth Utu ....... Your spouse Ama-ušumgalana, the shepherd, Lord Dumuzi, ....... Your beloved minister (?) Ninšubur ....... Your beloved sister-in-law Ĝeštin-ana ....... (3 lines fragmentary or missing)



Utu Suen/Nanna
Usually Gemini is represented by several dualities: common dualities are Heaven and Earth and the Sun and the Moon.
This imprint shows the sun god and the moon god. When they stand together, in other words: when they conjunct, then there is new moon, which is apparently the case here. The Babylonians believed that the moon was reborn every month:
An adab (?) to Suen for Šu-Suen
The beauty of heaven, the prince of earth, youthful Suen, the immense, the light of heaven and earth, who makes years of prosperity and good ...... last permanently, Nanna, the lord who is born each month, sired my Šu-Suen.
In general, that meant that the moon god was depicted as a child, but in this imprint that is not the case: the sun god and the moon god have many similarities because they have to represent Gemini. Only the moon god with his short robe looks just a little younger than the sun god, who also wears a bonnet.
Here we come across the curious phenomenon that the moon god is the father of the sun god, but that he looks younger than his son, as he is born again each new month.



The sun god Utu stands before Dumuzi and his hair is twisted into two buns. These buns, looking like small circles, may symbolize 20 indicating that this person is indeed the sun god Utu.
http://www.ancientscripts.com/sumerian.html
In Sumer number 10 was symbolized by a small circle. On cylinder seals drill holes form small circles, which means that one drill hole symbolizes 10, two holes symbolize 20, and three holes symbolize 30, etc. These numbers on their turn indicate deities: 10 indicates Iškur/Adad, 20 indicates Utu/Shamash, and 30 indicates Nanna/Suen:
Male: 60 - Anu, 50 -Enlil, 40 - Ea/Enki, 30 - Nanna/Suen, 20 - Utu/Shamash, 10 - Iškur /Adad Female: 55 - Antu, 4.5 - Ninlil, 35 - Ninki, 25 -Ningal, 15 - Inanna/Ishtar, 5 Ninhursag
http://www.rulit.net/books/the-12th-planet-read-299421-25.html
The sun god wears a headdress which seems to sparkle over the land:
A prayer for Samsu-iluna May your headdress sparkle over the Land like Utu! May your sceptre correctly guide the
numerous people! May Suen let you control the living beings! With your shepherd's crook may you lead Sumer and Akkad as if you were their mother and father! May the widespread people, the people whom you have united, pray to you as you shine like the Barge of Heaven! May you be the god of the foreign lands that are settled together!



Dendera Zodiac, Louvre Paris
The last constellation of interest to us is Orion, which was called ‘The Loyal Shepherd of Heaven’ in Babylon:
2 The Loyal Shepherd of Heaven (SIPA.ZI.AN.NA), d.Papsukkal, the messenger of d.Anu and d.Ishtar [ the constellation Orion. SIPA.ZI.AN.NA = GilgaMESH, where d.MASH is a name of Gilgamesh-Mercury]
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
d.Papsukkal, the messenger of Anu and Ishtar, is related to this constellation. He was syncretized with Ninshubur, the servant of the goddess Inanna:
Papsukkal Papsukkal was a messenger god in the Akkadian pantheon. He is known chiefly from late sources from the Seleudic period. His wife was Amasagnudi, and he acted as both messenger and gatekeeper for the rest of the pantheon. A sanctuary, the E-akkil is identified from the Mesopotamian site of Mkish.
Papsukkal was syncretized with Ninshubur, the sukkal (servant) of the goddess Inanna. Papsukkal was the regent of the tenth month in the Babylonian calendar.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Papsukkal
Number 1
Kalki, Ubil-Eshtar
At the right Kalki, the owner of the seal, carries a throne and Ubil-Eshtar, his lord, carries a crook and some garments. Depicted this way they act like servants.



As Ubil-Eshtar holds a crook he represents the constellation ‘The Shepherd of Heaven’. As Kalki carries a throne and the same Ubil-Eshta also carries a net and a reed pipe (?) they both are depicted like servants carrying things, similar to Ninshubur, who’s name can be translated as ‘lady servant’ or ‘lady slave’. She is Inanna’s constant support:
Ninshubur, her faithful servant, went with her. Inanna spoke to her, saying: 'Ninshubur, my constant support, My sukkal who gives me wise advice, My warrior who fights by my side, I am descending to the kur, to the underworld
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein - Kramer
The galla want to take her in Inanna’s place, but Inanna won't allow it.
The galla said: 'Walk on Inanna,
We shall take Ninshubur in your place.'
Inanna cried: 'No! Ninshubur is my constant support. She is my sukkal who gives me wise advice. She is my warrior who fights by my side. She did not forget my words. She set up a lament for my by the ruins. She beat the drum for me at the assembly places. She circled the houses of the gods. she tore at ther eyes, at her mouth, at her thighs. She dressed herself in a single garment like a beggar. Alone she set out for Nippur and the temple of Enlil. She went to Ur and the temple of Nanna. She went to Eridu and the temple of Enki. Because of her, my life was saved. I will never give Ninshubur to you.'
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein - Kramer



The point is that Kalki may carry the throne of Dumuzi and Ubil-Eshtar may hold his crook (Dumuzid is a shepherd), he may carry his me-garments in a net, and in his left hand he may even holds his reed pipe (very vague).
The galla said: 'Walk on to your city, Inanna. We will go with you to the big apple tree in uruk.' In Uruk, by the big apple tree, Dumuzi, the husband of Inanna, was dressed in his shining me garments. He sat on his magnificent throne; (he did not move). The galla seized him by the thighs. They poured milk out of his seven churns. They broke the reed pipe which the shepherd was playing. Inanna fastened on Dumuzi the eye of death. She spoke against him the word of wrath. She uttered against him the cry of guilt. 'Take him away! Take Dumuzi away!'
This means that Dumuzi is totally dishonoured, and now this whole scene is completely turned upside down.



Gala with an axe Gala with an axe
The bizarre fact occurs that everything can suddenly reversed: first we see the depicted persons as relatives of Eshtar/Inanna, but because Dumuzi is standing and the two small servants carry his belongings, the six persons can also represent the galla who take Dumuzi with them. And then this scene then shows the moment when these galla with their weapons especially with their axes (only mentioned once in the ‘Decent Of Inanna) made Dumuzi stand up:
Inanna fastened on Dumuzi the eye of death. She spoke against him the word of wrath. She uttered against him the cry of guilt. ‘Take him away! Take Dumuzi away!’ The galla, who know no food, who know no drink, Who eat no offerings, who drink no libations, Who accept no gifts, seized Dumuzi.
They made him stand up; they made him sit down. They beat the husband of Inanna. They gashed him with axes.
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein – Kramer
And thus it occurs that the six persons represent the relatives and servants of Esthar/Inanna, but at the same time they may represent ‘the galla’ who know no food etc:
The galla, who know no food, who know no drink, Who eat no offerings, who drink no libations, Who accept no gifts, seized Dumuzi.
Descent Of Inanna Wolkstein – Kramer
So, if I am right, this special imprint of a cylinder seal shows the complexity of images depicted on cylinder seals: first the persons in this imprint may represent relatives of Eshtar and they are linked to a number of constellations. Then the same persons may have represented gala being linked to the same constellations. So the surprising thing occurs that deities and gala could stay in the same constellations. What do you think of that?

You can read the whole myth in the PDF ‘Descent Of Inanna’ of Wolkstein and Kramer Other texts are taken from ‘The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature’.



Museum number: 89137 Description: Speckled black and white diorite cylinder seal; five figures are proceeding towards the left. The first two are turning back to look at their companions. The first has a short beard, his hair in a bun and wears a short cross-over kilt and shoes with upturned toes. He carries a quiver and a bow over his left shoulder and an arrow in his right hand. A tassel is attached to his quiver. The second figure wears his hair and beard short and curly and is dressed in a striped robe. His hands are clasped and he holds a stick. The figure has a short flounched robe. He carries an axe over his left shoulder. The fourth figure is clean-shaven with a completely shaven head, wears a fringed robe and holds a tablet (?) in his left hand. The fifth figure is dressed in attire similar to that of the second. He holds an axe in the crook of his left arm and a sling in his right hand. Terminal, five lines of inscription, partially framed; three horizontal lines; two small figures, both beardless and wearing short skirts, one with curly hair who is carrying a stool and one with his hair in a bun who is carrying a net at the end of a crook over his shoulder. They are following the procession. This seal seems to be represent a high official on a tour of inspection. The official in question is depicted in the middle of the group, carrying an axe which symbolises the power he wields. Immediately behind him is his scribe. He holds a tablet and ready to take down any record of the expedition his master might wish to dicitate. Two attendants accompany the official. The expedition is led by a local mountain guide who is armed and wearing shoes which are suitable for mountaineering. Two servants follow, carrying the chair and personal effects of the official. Attention is focused on the central figure by the fact the first two men in the procession look back at him.
