Were SCYTHIANS Israelites?
Were SCYTHIANS Israelites?
When Jacob built shelters for his cattle in Jordan, he called the place
"SUCCOTH" (Heb. "Cottages" or "Huts") (Gen. 33:17). When Israel dwelt in
Egypt, she named a town "SUCCOTH" (Ex. 12:37). In Palestine, the city of
"SUCCOTH" was given to the tribe of Gad (Josh. 13:27). Later, Israel was
deported to Media (2 Ki. 18:11) which is the same place that Diodorus
Siculus says the "SCYTHIANS" had their origin "on the Araxes" River (2:3).
Herodotus then says the SCYTHIANS moved "across the Araxes into
Cimmeria" (the Crimea) (4:11). In 2 Esdras 13:40-46 we read that Israelites
traveled this same route. Later, Germany was known as "SCYTHIA"
(Nennius' History of the Britons 31,37 & 50). Then Scandinavia was anciently
called "SCATHAnavia." Ireland was known as "SCOTIA Major" and
Scotland was called "SCOTIA Minor" (Venerable Bede & Nennius). Strabo
says, "All the nations toward the northern parts, the ancient Greek writers
call SCYTHIANS" (11:507).
Israelites, Scythians and Saxons Without A King
The following facts connect both Saxons and Scythians with Israel. Israel
was to be "many days WITHOUT A KING" (Hos. 3:4) "The most ancient
account of the Saxon government on the continent exists in this short but
expressive passage of Bede: 'The ancient SAXON'S HAVE NO KING, but
many chiefs set over their people, who, when war presses, draw lots
equally, and whomsoever the chance points out, they all follow as leader,
and obey during the war. The war concluded, all the chiefs become again
of equal power." In the Lindenb. Gloss. 1347, the following occurs: 'TWELVE
Ethelings governed over the land of the Saxons; and whenever war arose in
that land, the Saxons chose one of the TWELVE to be king while the war
lasted; when the war was finished, the TWELVE became alike.'" (Sharon



Turner's Anglo-Saxons 1:207)
Israelites, Scythians and Saxons Had Divining Rods
The SAXON custom of DIVINING by RODS or "AUGURY by WANDS"
(Tacitus' Germania 9:10) can be traced to the Israelite practice mentioned in
Hosea 4:12 which says, "My people ask counsel of their STOCKS, and their
STAFF declareth unto them." "They cut a small branch of a fruit-tree into
TWIGS, marked them, and scattered them at random on a white vest. The
priest, if it were a public COUNCIL, or the father, at a private
CONSULTATION, prayed, gazed at heaven, drew each three times, and
interpreted according to the mark previously impressed. Alfred also says
they cast lots with TWIGS (Sharon Turner's Anglo Saxons 1:223). Herodotus
says, "SCYTHIA has an abundance of soothsayers who foretell the future
by means of a number of WILLOW WANDS. A large bundle of these
WANDS is brought and laid on the ground. The soothsayer unties the
bundle, and places each wand by itself, at the same time uttering his
prophecy" (Herod. 4:67).
Israelites, Scythians and Saxons Had Similar Religions
The religion of Odin included the belief in a beneficent ALL-FATHER in
HEAVEN, who made the heaven, and earth, and air out of nothing; in the
future purifying the world by FIRE, a catastrophe connected with the
embodiment of evil., who is frequently described as a SERPENT or a
DRAGON; in a NEW WORLD that is TO COME, and in the advent of "the
POWERFUL ONE" for JUDGMENT.
Israelites and Scythians Had Groves But No Images
A German (Scythian) custom mentioned in Tacitus' Germania 9:10 that
seems to be Israelite is as follows:"The deities of the Germans are NOT
confined WITHIN WALLS, nor FASHIONED INTO any mortal SHAPES;
they hallow GROVES and WOODS, and call by the name of gods that



hidden presence which is felt by reverence alone." Many passages in the
Bible mention "GROVES" as places of Israelite worship (1 Kings 14:15) and
the biblical command to "not make unto thee any GRAVEN IMAGE or any
LIKENESS of ANYTHING" is also well known. Immediately before the
captivity, "Ephraim was joined to IDOLS," but neither in Scythia nor in
Germany did they have IMAGES so they must have repented somewhat.
Neither did they have kings for "the children of Israel shall abide many
days WITHOUT A KING, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice,
and WITHOUT AN IMAGE, and without an ephod, and without
teraphim" (Hos. 3:4).Scythians made no idols (Herodotus 4:59).
Israelites-Scythians-Saxons Were Civilized, Wise and Unconquerable
"Round the Black Sea ... are to be found, if we EXCEPT SCYTHIA, the
most uncivilized nations in the world. No one could claim that the rest
have any of the arts of civilized life, or have produced any man of
distinction" (Her. 4:46). Aeschylus says "The SACAE (or SCUTHS) were
noted for their GOOD LAWS, and were preeminently a RIGHTEOUS
people." Colossians 3:11 contrasts Barbarians with SCYTHIANS.
Thucydides says, "In respect of MILITARY STRENGTH and NUMBER of
SOLDIERS, NO single NATION, either in Europe or Asia, could MATCH
the SCUTHS" (Thuc. 2:97 spoken about 420 B.C.). As Psalm 105:20 says, "He
INCREASED his people Israel greatly, and made them STRONGER than
their enemies." Herodotus adds, "They have, in one respect ... shown
themselves WISER than any other nation upon the face of the earth....
Possessing no houses but waggons, and carrying these about wherever
they go, accustomed, one and all, to fight on horseback with bows and
arrows, and dependent for their food not upon agriculture but upon their
cattle: how can they fail of being UNCONQUERABLE, and even
UNASSAILABLE?" (4:46). "NO WEAPON that is formed AGAINST THEE
shall PROSPER" (Isa. 54:17).
Their oaths were accompanied by CEREMONIES IDENTICAL WITH



those of the MEDES; they used skulls as drinking cups, like the Northmen
of later years; their weapons were the spear, the battle-axe and the bow;
they made BOOTHES like the Israelites; they had fables of GRIFFINS, the
representations of which on the Scythian tombs are almost exactly like the
WINGED LIONS of the Assyrians.
Israelites and Scythians Boiled Meat By Burning Bones
Describing their sacrifices, Herodotus says, "After flaying the beasts, they
take out all the bones, and put the flesh into BOILERS or cauldrons of a
large size, then placing the BONES of the animals beneath the cauldron,
they set them ALIGHT, and so BOIL the meat." (Her. 4:61) In Ezekiel 24:5
we read, "take the choice of the flock, and BURN also the BONES under it,
and make it BOIL well." Professor Rawlinson thinks both these passages
refer to the same custom.
Israelites and Scythians Didn't Eat Pigs
Finally Herodotus says regarding sacrifices,"they NEVER USE SWINE;
nor, indeed, is it their wont to breed them in any part of their country" (Her.
4:63). Yes "the SWINE ... IS UNCLEAN to you" (Lev. 11:7). Strabo says of the
Dacians "that the care of WORSHIPPING the Supreme Being is GREAT
among this nation, is not to be doubted, after what Posidonius has related,
'and they even ABSTAIN FROM ANIMAL FOOD from religious motives,'
as likewise on account of the testimony of other historians" (Strabo 7:3:4).
Israelites and Scythians Dwelt in Caves Without Flax
Herodotus says, "HEMP groweth abundantly in this land of Scythia, and of
this the people MAKE GARMENTS that are very like to garments made of
FLAX. These people possess neither houses, cities, nor cultivated land: but
lived in waggons and on the produce of their cattle." This reminds us of
Hosea 2:2-14 which says, "Plead with your mother, plead ... Lest I strip her
naked, and set her as in the day that she was born, and make her as a



wilderness, and set her like a DRY LAND, and slay her with thirst ... For
she said, I will go after my lovers, that give me my bread and water, my
wool and my flax, mine oil and my drink ... For she did not know that I gave
her corn, ands wine, and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which
they prepared for Baal. Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in
the time thereof, and My wine in the season thereof, and will RECOVER
my wool and MY FLAXgiven to cover her nakedness." Israel dwelt among
the monuments -- the BARROWS and MOUNDS of Southern Russia, the
CAVES in which the Getae lived in memory of that to which Zalmoxis
retired -- and ate unclean food. Therefore Isaiah 65:4 says Israelites
"remain among the GRAVES, and lodge in the MONUMENTS; that eat
swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels." Plint N.H.
4:12 calls them "CAVE-DWELLERS."
Israel and Scythia Didn't Intermarry with Other Nations
Tacitus says the Kimbri were Germans and "the Germans never to have
intermarried with other nations; but to be a Race, Pure, Unmixed, and
stamped with a distinct character. Hence a family likeness pervades the
whole though their numbers are so great" (Tacitus de Morib. Ger. c.v.). Thus
was Israel sifted through a sieve, but not one grain was allowed to fall to
the ground (Amos 9:9). "SCYTHIANS are dead-set AGAINST FOREIGN
WAYS" (Her. 4:75). Their destiny was to "DWELL ALONE." (Num. 23:9)
Israelites and Scythians Were Known As Arians
Reuben, Gad and half-Manasseh were placed by Tiglath-Pileser in the
mountain district of Great MEDIA, a region expressly called HARA (1 Chr.
5:26; Ar being a mountain). In fact all ten tribes of Israel were placed in the
"cities of the MEDES" (2 Ki. 17:6). Herodotus 7:62 says, "The Medes were
once universally known as ARIANS." HARA was named ARIA, ARIANA
and ARACHOSIA by the Greeks (see Ptolemy). It contains the city of
HARAT. According to the black obelisk discovered in the ruins of the



palace of Nimrod which is now in the British Museum, the people or
leader of the ARIANS was called ESAKSKA (Isaac) and their principal
cities were "Beth-Telabon, Beth-Everak and Beth-Tsida" in 670 B.C. This
information connects the Israelites with the ARIANS. These ARIANS
must have migrated to Thrace because, according to Stephanus, Thrace
was called ARIA. From Thrace they migrated to Germany since Tacitus
mentions the HARII there in SE Germany (Ger.43). The Thracian
SCYTHIANS pricked and stained their bodies (Herod. 5); so did the ARII of
Germany (Tacitus); the BELGAE of Britain (Caesar de Bell. Gall.), and the
PIKS of Norway and Scotland (Herodian; Claudian).
According to Herodotus 1:110, the Magi lived next to the Budii in MEDIA.
Daniel was made "Rab-Mag" by Nebuchadnezzar (Dan. 2:48). The name
"Mag" in Pehlvi denotes "Priest." The Magi of MEDIA visited the child
Yeshua because they were Israelites.
