ABSTRACT
Hunnic Warfare in the Fourth and Fifth Centuries C.E.: Archery and the Collapse of the Western Roman Empire
Laura E. Fyfe
The Huns are one of the most misunderstood and mythologized barbarian invaders
encountered by the Roman Empire. They were described by their contemporaries as
savage nomadic warriors with superior archery skills, and it is this image that has been
written into the history of the fall of the Western Roman Empire and influenced studies of
Late Antiquity through countless generations of scholarship. This study examines
evidence of Hunnic archery, questions the acceptance and significance of the “Hunnic
archer” image, and situates Hunnic archery within the context of the fall of the Western
Roman Empire. To achieve a more accurate picture of the importance of archery in
Hunnic warfare and society, this study undertakes a mortuary analysis of burial sites
associated with the Huns in Europe, a tactical and logistical study of mounted archery and
Late Roman and Hunnic military engagements, and an analysis of the primary and
secondary literature.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION
1.1 Introduction to the Huns
During its decline and subsequent fall in the latter part of the fifth century C.E. the
Western Roman Empire witnessed significant political upheaval, civil war, and frequent
barbarian invasions. Of these barbarian groups, the Huns are one of the most
misunderstood and mythologized. Appearing on the borders of Europe in the fourth
century C.E. the Huns were described by their contemporaries as savage nomadic
warriors impervious to hardship. The Huns themselves did not leave a written record and
modern scholars are left with no detailed account by an eyewitness of the Huns at war.
However, the fourth century historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote that the Huns were
the most formidable of all warriors because they possessed superior archery skills (31.2.8,
9). This prevailing image was written into the history of the fall of the Western Roman
Empire and has influenced studies of Late Antiquity through countless generations of
scholarship.
Biases in both the historical and archaeological record pose significant issues for
historians attempting to reconcile this image of a fearsome mounted archer (Figure 1).
Scholarly acceptance of this image has shifted focus away from fundamental questions
concerning the significance of archery in Hunnic warfare, and thus more broadly the role
played by the Huns in the fall of the Western Roman Empire.

1.2 Statement of Problem and Objectives
This study examines evidence of Hunnic archery, questions the acceptance and
significance of the “Hunnic archer” image, and situates Hunnic archery within the context
of the fall of the Western Roman Empire. A mortuary analysis of archaeological and
osteological evidence from burial sites associated with the Huns in Europe will help
create a more accurate picture of the importance of archery in Hunnic warfare and
society. Looking at the disparity between archaeological and historical evidence will
address tensions between Data Set A: Burial Sites and Data Set B: The Descriptions. An
examination of the tactical and logistical implications of mounted archery and the way
such a military engagement would appear and function on a battlefield will help to re
assess the importance, prevalence, and viability of mounted archery in Hunnic warfare.
An examination of both primary and secondary literature will provide the context for this
study and will serve as the foundation for the central research question: what can the
archaeological evidence and a logistical analysis of Hunnic archery tell scholars about the
importance and implication of archery in Hunnic warfare?

CHAPTER 2
LITERARY AND HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
2.1 The Late Roman Empire and the Huns
The aim of this study is not to provide a comprehensive history of the Late Roman
Empire and the Huns, nor does it propose to definitively answer the historiographical
question of the end of the Western Roman Empire. Nevertheless, a brief overview is of
undeniable importance in order to situate this study within its broader historical context.
The period between the third and seventh centuries C.E. is known by scholars of
Mediterranean history and culture as Late Antiquity and by those with a focus on northern
Europe as the Migration Period (James 2009: 1). Immigration across the Rhine and the
Danube into the Roman Empire had been occurring since the first century C.E. after
which barbarian peoples continued to be slowly integrated into the west. In 395 C.E.,
following the death of Theodosius I, the eastern and western parts of the Roman Empire
were divided between his two sons. While laws continued to be issued in the names of
both emperors, east and west began to drift apart due mainly to the military and economic
costs of dealing with the westward movement of numerous barbarian peoples. The
Alemanni, Franks, Vandals, Goths, Huns, and Alans had broken through the old frontiers
of the Rhine and Danube rivers (Kelly 2008: 17; Mitchell 2007: 5). While many eastern
provinces remained unaffected, the northern boundary of the empire eroded as the
Western Empire proved unable to hold off the waves of barbarians (Mitchell 2007: 5).
Barbarian immigrants began serving in Roman armies in increasingly greater numbers
and a few barbarian commanders became notable in the historical record (Whitby 2000:



5
290; Mitchell 2007: 192).1 To avoid war, supplement their own armies, and perhaps even
to increase the number of tax payers, the Romans granted land to various barbarian
groups (e.g. Tervingi and Greuthungi in 382 C.E.) in return for troops (Kelly 2008: 48).
Land was also ceded to the Huns (e.g. Pannonia and Valeria in the mid fifth-century);
however, this was under significantly different circumstances (discussed subsequently).
In the fourth century C.E., the Huns appear in history as if out of nowhere in a
series of clashes with the Roman Empire and neighbouring barbarian groups. During this
period they do not appear as a united force under a single ruler; in fact, they were
frequently employed by both Roman and barbarian generals as soldiers (Heather 1995:
10). While largely nomadic, by the end of the fourth century the Huns had made their
home in the Great Hungarian Plain (an area of approximately 64,000 square km), which
provided an ideal base from which to launch attacks both north and south of the Danube
(Kelly 2008: 59). West of the Black Sea, it was the only area of grassland large enough to
support horses on any great scale. If pasturing horses was its only function, the Great
Hungarian Plain could accommodate an estimated 320,000 horses; however, if varied
terrain and other possible land uses are considered, the number is more likely around
150,000 (Lindner 1981: 14).
In the beginning of the fifth century individual Hunnic leaders begin to be noted
by name in the historical record. As a less cohesive force prior to this, little is known of
individual Huns. The period from the 430s also witnessed a shift in Hunnic policy.
Instead of destroying the settlements they encountered, they began to sign treaties and
1 This is a complex issue dealing with ethnicity and cultural/social identification with the Roman Empire. In reality, very few “barbarian” generals during this time rose to high-ranking positions; however, the impacts of barbarians in the Roman military are undeniable. For an historical overview, see: Mitchell (2007). For comprehensive discussions of barbarian and Roman ethnicity, see Halsall (2007); James (2007).

demand tribute payments (Kelly 2008: 61). By doing this, Kelly (2008: 71) argues, the
Huns created a persistent security problem for the empire while offering themselves as a
solution to it. It is important to note that there has been no consensus reached about the
exact date of the three Roman treaties with the Huns. The initial treaty with Rua (350lb of
gold annually) has been dated to 422 C.E., and the subsequent treaties with Bleda and
Attila, and then Attila as sole ruler, have been dated to 439 and 443 or 447 C.E.
respectively (Maenchen-Helfen 1983: 93). The discrepancies in the chronologies of
secondary sources, therefore, must be considered in any evaluation of events.
In the early decades of the fifth century Rua obtained military leadership of a
more united group of Huns and, upon his death in 434 C.E., he was succeeded by his
nephews Bleda and Attila (Thompson 1948: 69). While the Hunnic confederacy, a multi
ethnic group of warrior bands, reached the height of its power during the first six years of
their joint rule (434-440 C.E.) it remains difficult to trace their part in the expansion of
the “Hun Empire” (Heather 1995: 28; Kelly 2008: 96).
With an imminent Gothic threat in the Mediterranean and a dangerous Burgundian
presence on the Rhine (where they had recently seized more Roman land), Aetius (391
454 C.E.), an influential Western Roman military commander,2 offered a deal in
exchange for Hunnic assistance in the West. In 425 C.E, recognizing Hunnic
unwillingness to divert resources away from consolidating power north of the Danube
(one of Rua’s primary concerns), Aetius offered a guarantee that there would be no
Roman intervention in Hunnic control of two of the western empire’s frontier provinces:
2Aetius served in the Roman army and between 405 and 408 C.E. was a hostage of the Gothic king Alaric. Following this he was a hostage with the Huns, from whom poet Sidonius Apollinaris (Carm.7.230-1) claimed he learned the “art of war.” For a more detailed account, see James (2009).

Pannonia I and Valeria (Kelly 2008: 112). A stretch of land approximately 160km wide
and running 320km to the south was conceded by the Western Empire (Kelly 2008: 112).
There were clear benefits to Attila and Bleda: strengthening a valuable alliance with
Aetius and eliminating the Burgundian presence by replacing it with a less hostile Roman
border resulted in a secure Rhine frontier. With Hunnic control over parts of Pannonia
and Valeria, the brothers had more freedom to cross the Danube further east and push
towards Constantinople. The result was first a truce with the Burgundians in 436 C.E.
followed shortly by their complete annihilation at the hands of the Huns (Kelly 2008:
113). Writing of the massacre, Prosper of Aquitaine joins the small group of
contemporary writers to leave a horrifying description of Hunnic power and cruelty: “the
Huns destroyed the Burgundians root and branch” (Prosper Tiro 1322).
The failure of allied Roman and Hunnic troops in 439 C.E. to defeat the Visigoths
at Toulouse may have factored significantly in a decision by Attila and Bleda to sign a
non-aggression pact with the Eastern Empire. Envoys met in the winter of 439 C.E. and
came to a series of agreements known as the Treaty of Margum. The treaty made a
number of stipulations: the Romans were to return all Hunnic refugees who crossed the
frontier, they were not to enter into an alliance with any enemies of the Huns, they were
to confirm Hunnic trading rights with the Empire, and finally they were to make an
annual payment of 700lbs of gold directly to Attila and Bleda (Kelly 2008: 118; 2015:
199).
Carthage fell to the Vandals later that same year (October 439 C.E.) and the
Roman Empire continued to face numerous military challenges. The eastern emperor
Theodosius II (408-450 C.E.) sent a naval expedition to Sicily to recapture the city in 441
C.E. (Bayless 1976:176; Thompson 1948: 86). In that same year a Persian army under



8
Yezdegerd II invaded the Eastern Roman Empire drawing additional Roman forces away
from its northern defenses (Bayless 1976:176; Thompson 1948: 86). This movement of
troops away from the area gave Attila an opportunity to capture a fort north of the
Danube. Theodosius protested this apparent breach of the terms of the treaty stipulating
fair and safe trade (Bayless 1976: 178; Kelly 2008: 123; Thompson 1948: 88). Attila
countered by accusing a Roman bishop of robbing royal Hunnic graves and the Romans
for retaining a considerable number of fugitives from the Huns, in clear violation of the
treaty (Bayless 1976: 178; Kelly 2008: 123; Thompson 1948: 88). The Roman envoys
could do nothing but deny these claims, leaving the Huns to continue their devastation of
towns and fortresses from the summer of 441 C.E. into the next spring (Kelly 2008: 124;
Thompson 1948: 88). Over these years, Attila succeeded in breaking through the empire’s
frontier defences and came within 35km of Constantinople (Kelly 2008: 138). The
subsequent Peace, brokered by Anatolius and signed in 443 C.E., temporarily concluded
these Hunnic invasions (Bayless 1976: 176). The terms of the treaty were similar to those
of the Treaty of Margum (439 C.E.) with one major addition: the Romans were to make
payments of 2,100lbs of gold per annum along with an immediate payment of 6,000lbs of
gold directly to Attila.3
In addition to the payment of gold, Anatolius conceded that the Danube would no
longer mark the geographical extent of Roman imperial rule (Kelly 2008: 140). Attila
demanded the evacuation of a great swath of territory running from Singidunum,
3 Thompson (1948: 77, 217) and Maenchen-Helfen (1973: 117) suggest that such a large sum was imposed because of a failure by Theodosius to pay the original amount demanded by the Treaty of Margum. Bayless (1976: 178) disagrees, arguing that if this were the case, the failure to pay would have been listed among Attila’s grievances. The demand served as a punitive measure whether as compensation for the tribute in arrears or for the violation of the Treaty of Margum.

approximately 480km along the river, to Novae and five days’ journey wide. This
depopulated zone acted as a buffer and served both to prevent a surprise attack and to
deprive the Romans of the natural defensive advantages of the Danube, removing the
main obstacle preventing the Huns from breaking into the empire (Kelly 2008: 140-141).
Most towns inside this zone were completely laid to waste, yet the people who had fled
the area would slowly return. Neither the Romans nor Attila could completely drive the
peasants off of their land (Maenchen-Helfen 1973: 124). Some of Theodosius’
contemporaries, like Priscus of Panium, were critical of the ‘cowardice’ of the emperor
and his acceptance of these terms (9.3; 11.1). While a sum of 2,100lbs of gold (roughly
151,200 solidi) appears a “vast sum,” it was hardly enough to threaten the financial
integrity of the imperial government (Kelly 2008: 141-142). Comparing this amount to
the expenses of Leo’s expedition against the Vandals in 468 C.E. which, from various
sources of income, totalled approximately 64,000lbs of gold and 700,000lbs of silver, it is
difficult to argue that a mere 2,100lbs constituted a crippling amount (Elton 2014: 246).
After the conclusion of the Peace of Anatolius internal dissension broke out
between the Hunnic leaders. After the death of Bleda in 445 C.E., most likely at the hand
of his brother, Attila became the first sole leader of the Huns (Halsall 2007: 251; Kelly
2008: 129; Maenchen-Helfen 1973: 126; Thompson 1948: 97). In 447 C.E. Roman forces
under Arnegisclus were forced to engage with the Huns near the Utus River, as Attila
invaded the Balkan regions of the Eastern Empire. The Romans were narrowly defeated
and both armies suffered heavy casualties, the numbers of which are unknown (Kelly
2008: 138). Following this, Theodosius again sent the general Anatolius to negotiate
peace, and he eventually brokered the Second Peace of Anatolius (Kelly 2008: 140).



10
In 451 C.E. Attila led an expedition against the West. Eager to accept what he
believed to be a marriage proposal from Honoria, the sister of emperor Valentinian III
(425-455 C.E.), Attila took his forces to Gaul to claim his ‘share’ of the western empire.4
He marched west and wreaked havoc on many surrounding cities (Halsall 2007: 252-3).
Along with tales of destruction, there are surviving stories written about ‘miracles’ that
saved Christian towns from the advancing Huns. The most well-known tells of the
encounter in 451 C.E. between Attila and Lupus, bishop of Troyes. After praying for days
Lupus reportedly went to face the great Hunnic leader. To his challenge Attila replied, “I
am Attila, the scourge of God” (Jacobus de Voragine, Life of S. Germain). The bishop
cried with shame at his failure to keep his people from sinning, welcoming Attila.
According to the story, this humility was enough to save the city; the Huns were blinded
by heaven and passed through the gates seeing no one (Kelly 2008: 243).
When Attila reached the Loire, the Romans at Orléans were finally able to resist
his Hunnic forces. Halfway between Troyes and Châlons-sur-Marne, Attila’s army met
the Romans and Goths (under Aetius and Theodoric I respectively) at what came to be
known as the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields (451 C.E.). The violence and carnage was
documented by Prosper of Aquitaine, who wrote within four years of the engagement,
and Jordanes whose account was written almost 100 years later (Halsall 2007: 253;
Mitchell 2007: 112). The battle can be seen as indecisive; however, the Huns suffered the
4 Upon becoming forcibly engaged, Emperor Valentinian’s sister Honoria is said to have offered Attila a substantial down-payment in gold to intervene on her behalf. With this offer she allegedly sent a signet ring. It is likely that Attila discussed this with his advisors, believing it was either a trap to bring Attila to Ravenna or an opportunity to put pressure on the emperor. Attila’s response was that he would help Honoria and in return she would become his next wife (Halsall 2007: 252; Kelly 2008: 224-230).



11
worst of the exchange and while Thorismund’s Visigoths continued to fight, Attila’s army
withdrew to Pannonia (Halsall 2007: 253; Whately 2013: 67).
Later in 452 C.E. Attila assembled another army and over the next year invaded
Italy and plundered Aquileia, Milan, and Ticinum (Mitchell 2007: 112). The city of Rome
itself was saved, according to some accounts, by a parley between Attila and Pope Leo I
(Mitchell 2007: 112). Whether or not the Pope was successful, it is also worth considering
the possibility that, as claimed by Hydatius (MGH AA 11, 26-27), the Huns were forced
to retreat due to diseases such as malaria or dysentery, a problem that affected many
ancient armies (Burgess 1988: 360; Halsall 2007: 254). However, not all in Attila’s path
were spared.
At the beginning of 453 C.E. Attila decided to take another wife. After his
wedding he feasted into the night; when he did not appear the next morning his
bodyguard broke down the doors to find him dead. With no injury it appeared as though
Attila had hemorrhaged through the nose and choked on his own blood while he slept
(Kelly 2008: 265). After his abrupt death the confederation fell to factional discord and
the Huns as a unified force disappear from history. Civil war between Attila’s sons
allowed groups formerly subject to the Huns (e.g. the Gepids and Goths) to assert
independence (significantly during the Battle of Nedao in 454), and by the late 460s C.E.,
some of these same Huns sought refuge inside the Eastern Empire (Heather 1995: 29).
Struggles within the Western Roman Empire also brought about the death of both Aetius
at the hands of Valentinian, and six months later the emperor himself, killed by former
members of Aetius’ bodyguard (Kelly 2008: 272).
The Western Roman Empire collapsed fitfully over the next two decades. There is
no single commonly accepted cause for the events culminating in the end of the Western



12
Roman Empire and blame has been placed on everything from excessive Christian piety
to the effects of lead water pipes (Heather 1995: 4). Modern historians do not
unanimously agree on whether the events surrounding the year 476 C.E. constituted a
collapse or a period of transition. Romanists tend to see a collapse of centuries of glorious
military, political, and social tradition while medievalists often view this as a period of
transition and rebirth from a corrupt and despotic empire that paled in comparison to its
more ancient counterpart. Most scholars argue for a culmination of multiple factors. Elton
(1996: 266-68) argues that political and military failure on the part of the Roman Empire
precipitated the events that led to the downfall. Pressure on the frontiers, the Battle of
Adrianople (378 C.E.), numerous civil wars, and lack of soldiers bred fatal internal and
external conflict. Kelly (2008: 277) argues for an emphasis on continuity, although he
does not deny the significant political change that occurred in the fifth century. Halsall
(2007: 34) describes the fragmentation of the Western Roman Empire and the power
vacuum it created, which allowed new non-Roman political entities to slowly replace the
political role of the Roman Empire.
Even with access to the same primary texts, modern historians continue to defend
a wide range of arguments about the importance of the Huns to the fall of the West. This
makes both the scarce literary and archaeological records all the more important and
potentially problematic in the study of the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Some, like
Kim (2013: 2) and Kelly (2008: 66), argue that for a short period of time, from 440-455
C.E., the Huns formed the first steppe “empire.” According to Kim (2013: 49, 88), the
Huns with their superior military skill drove all other barbarian groups into the Empire,
and Attila’s Huns themselves succeeded in finally destroying the Western Empire. Kelly
(2008: 277, 78) argues that Attila himself could not be blamed for the fall of the west, nor



13
could he have foreseen the events that led to it, yet none of what occurred could have
happened without him and without his sudden and unexpected death. Heather (1995: 38)
argues that rather than leading to its destruction, the Huns actually sustained the Western
Empire until the 440s C.E., and that they indirectly contributed to imperial collapse by
suddenly disappearing and leaving the west without outside military assistance. Attila
never came close to conquering either half of the empire. To Heather, (1995: 23) a
foreign policy crisis was ultimately the downfall of the West. Hunnic hostility was less
significant than the indirect effect of forcing a multitude of immigrants across the Roman
frontier (Heather 1995: 29). How modern scholars use the available sources (and which
they choose to rely on) greatly shapes the debate. Therefore, it is of great importance to
critically examine the written and archaeological evidence and to test it alongside
logistical assumptions of Hunnic military tactics.
2.2 The Primary Literature
When mapped out chronologically and geographically, the barbarian migrations
during the Late Roman Empire may resemble deliberate military strategy. In reality they
represent a series of unplanned movements by many groups of ‘outsiders’ occurring year
after year in a chronologically and geographically confusing time period that modern
scholars know very little about. Much of what is now known of the Huns survives as
descriptions of their military prowess and uniquely superior mounted archery skills. The
Huns themselves did not keep written records and as a result the majority of available
information is derived from contemporaneous third-party sources. Three of the best and
most detailed accounts of the Huns and similar nomadic barbarians survive today from



14
the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus (c. 325/330-391 C.E.), Priscus of Panium (c.
410/420-472 C.E.) and Menander Protector (who wrote about the Turks in the 6th century
C.E.).
Ammianus Marcellinus was born in approximately 330 C.E. into the local
aristocracy of Roman Syria or Phoenicia. He received a high quality education and,
despite his first language being Greek, wrote his histories in Latin. Joining the Roman
army as an officer, or protector domesticus, around 350 C.E., during his life and career he
travelled through Egypt, Sparta, and possibly Thrace, eventually settling in Rome (Barnes
1998: 1; Crump 1975: 1; Matthews 1989: 9-17). The first 13 books of Ammianus’ Res
Gestae are lost and the surviving 18 (Books 14 to 31) describe a period of only 25 years:
from 353 C.E. to the Battle of Adrianople in 378 C.E. His fourth century text is the most
complete surviving account of the Huns, providing the main description of their physical
appearance and social and military customs. His descriptions are based on his ‘travels’
and are arguably consistent with the observations of a protector in his time. His
references to supplies and use of military terminology alongside his vivid topographical
descriptions extend beyond those of other contemporary historians, and seem to
demonstrate his knowledge of operations (Lee 1998: 212; Trombley 1999: 21, 27).
Ammianus wrote of his own experience on the battlefield rather than of the battle
as a whole, although it is likely that he never personally encountered a Hun (King 1987:
78). In fact, there were no significant encounters between the Huns and the Roman army
during Ammianus’ lifetime. He introduces the Huns at the beginning of Book 31,
explaining their rare and brief appearance in the works of other writers. Like his
predecessors and contemporaries he did not have satisfactory evidence for a geographic
origin and writes simply that they were living where they first became known to history



15
beyond the Sea of Azov (Thompson 1948: 19). According to Ammianus even a Hun
himself knew little of his own geographic origin, having been “conceived in one place,
born somewhere else, and reared even further off” (31.2.10). While Ammianus hesitated
to ascribe an origin story to the Huns, Greek sophist and historian Eunapius (c. 345-420
C.E.) did not. While his Hunnic digression has not survived, the following has been
ascribed to him: neighbouring peoples became known to the Huns after a single tribesman
in pursuit of a wild animal mistakenly stumbled upon a mild climate with fertile soil and
populated by a settlement of people (Maenchen-Helfen 1973: 8; Rohrbacher 2002: 226).
The passages of both Eunapius and Ammianus bear striking similarities to one written by
Herodotus (c. 484-425 B.C.E.) about the Scythian people (4. 8-11). Whether myth or
reality, Thompson (1948: 20) suggests that the Huns’ accidental discovery precipitated
their attack on the Goths in Crimea. Herodotus writes: “...the wandering Scythians once
dwelt in Asia...quitted their homes, crossed the Araxes, and entered the land of
Cimmeria. For the land which is now inhabited by the Scyths was formerly the country of
the Cimmerians” (4.11).
Ammianus’ physical description of the Huns fits within the traditional “nomad
ideology” (Shaw 1982-3: 25). He recounts tales of a ‘savage people’ driving inhabitants
from their homes as the Gothic kingdom of Ermanarich fell before the Huns (Thompson
1948: 26). His descriptions of the Huns were likely the first that many in his audience had
ever heard.
At the very moment of their birth the cheeks of their infant children are deeply marked by an iron, in order that the usual vigour of their hair, instead of growing at the proper season, may be withered by the wrinkled scars; and accordingly they grow up without beards, and consequently without any beauty, like eunuchs, though they all have closely-knit and strong limbs, and plump necks; they are of great size, and bow-legged, so that you might fancy them two-legged beasts, or the stout figures which



16
are hewn out in a rude manner with an axe on the posts at the end of bridges (Ammianus 31.2.2). Ammianus wrote that the physical conditioning prepared them for a life of burden
and toil (31.2.1). He wrote that they had no use of fire, choosing only to eat the roots of
plants and raw meat that they would warm up by placing it between their thighs and on
the backs of their horses as they rode (31.2.1). Ammianus’ Huns did not dwell in
buildings, choosing to roam over the mountains and forests with their wagons, hardened
to cold and starvation. They did not practice agriculture, instead gaining their property
through robbing and pillaging.
One of the most vivid and enduring elements of Ammianus’ description of the
Huns is of their reliance on horses.
They cover their heads with round caps, and their shaggy legs with the skins of kids; their shoes are not made on any lasts, but are so unshapely as to hinder them from walking with a free gait. And for this reason they are not well suited to infantry battles, but are nearly always on horseback, their horses being ill-shaped, but hardy; and sometimes they even sit upon them like women if they want to do anything more conveniently. There is not a person in the whole nation who cannot remain on his horse day and night. On horseback they buy and sell, they take their meat and drink, and there they recline on the narrow neck of their steed, and yield to sleep so deep as to indulge in every variety of dream (Ammianus 31.2.6).
Ammianus created a powerful and enduring image of fearsome warriors: Huns
riding into battle upon their horses. These mounted warriors were not subject to the
authority of a king, but would advance under the command of a chief when collective
action was demanded (31.2.7). He described skilled archers and fearless close-combat
warriors.
Sometimes when provoked, they fight; and when they go into battle, they form in a solid body, and utter all kinds of terrific yells. They are very quick in their operations, of exceeding speed, and fond of surprising their enemies. With a view to this, they suddenly disperse, then reunite, and again, after having inflicted vast loss upon the enemy, scatter themselves



17
over the whole plain in irregular formations: always avoiding a fort or an entrenchment. And in one respect you may pronounce them the most formidable of all warriors, for when at a distance they use missiles of various kinds tipped with sharpened bones instead of the usual points of javelins, and these bones are admirably fastened into the shaft of the javelin or arrow; but when they are at close quarters they fight with the sword, without any regard for their own safety; and often while their antagonists are warding off their blows they entangle them with twisted cords, so that, their hands being fettered, they lose all power of either riding or walking (Ammianus 31.2.8,9).
This image still forms the prevailing image of the Huns. Ammianus’ description
provides modern scholars with a definitive yet likely exaggerated and prejudiced
description. Late Antique historical accounts of nomadic people often follow a consistent
stereotypical framework and Ammianus’ picture of the Huns as barbaric nomads without
land or law fits with the traditional Classical image of the nomad (Shaw 1982: 13, 25).
Ammianus’ Res Gestae describes Hunnic warfare but does not describe the Huns
at war. While he discusses their reliance on horse-archery, Ammianus does not explain
how the Huns acquired their bows or other weapons – whether they constructed them or
gained them through plunder. He describes bone-tipped arrows yet none have appeared in
the archaeological record (Elton 1996: 63; King 1987: 82). Bone-tipped arrows have,
however, been associated with the later Mongols (Martin 1943: 52). His picture of the
Huns is somehow both detailed and simplistic, providing a vivid description without any
true context.
There are four theoretical origins of Ammianus’ description of the Huns. First,
and very unlikely, he completely fabricated his account. Second, he was an eyewitness to
the Huns he described, which is also unlikely as there exists no evidence of this and his
discussion of Hunnic warfare lacks specific examples. Third and fourth, combined are the
most probable, he drew much of his information from his formal education (the works



18
that he read), and by talking to his contemporaries, some of whom may have met or at
least heard of the Huns. It is likely that Ammianus knew some of the facts that he
endeavoured to present, yet he may have lacked the cultural context through which to
interpret them (King 1987/1985: 77). While the identities of his informants are unknown
to history, as are the exact contents of his library, modern historians do have a reasonable
surviving sample of what he could have read and what was available to him during his
lifetime. To date, Ammianus is one of the few remaining sources of information about the
Huns and provides the foundation for modern and historical scholarship.
The second major literary source for the Huns during and after the reign of Attila
was Priscus of Panium. Priscus was born in Thrace between 410 and 420 C.E. where he
received a standard philosophical and rhetorical education5 (Blockley 1981: 48). His
major works were a History of Byzantium and Attila in eight books, Exercises in Rhetoric,
and Letters (Suda II 2301). His writing survives only in fragments; the greatest part is
found in the de Legationibus, part of an encyclopedic collation of ancient texts
commissioned by Emperor Constantine VII Porphyrogennetos in the tenth century C.E.
(Maas 1995: 146). The de Legationibus focused mainly on international relations and,
fittingly, Priscus’ History describes how Attila campaigned against the Eastern and
Western Roman Empire, the nature and size of the cities which his forces captured, and
the chaos that he founded before withdrawing (Evagrius 1.17; Maas 1995: 146). It is
important to note, however, that there are no existing fragments of Priscus actually
describing the Huns on the battlefield. The earliest datable fragment records the death of
5 Philosophy and rhetoric were two components of a Roman education. The study of philosophy was largely Greek in content, while the study of rhetoric taught students the art of discourse; that is how to write, speak, inform, persuade, and motivate their audience (Corbett 1990: 1).



19
Rua and the succession of Attila and Bleda (c.434 C.E.) (Blockley 1981: 50). Much of the
material about Attila in Jordanes’ Gothic History (Getica) comes from Priscus. It is in
through these sections (rewritten by Jordanes into Latin) and the preserved original
fragments that modern scholars have access to Priscus today.
Through the words of other historians Priscus offers general descriptions of the
Huns as a people and specific details of their style of warfare. In a fragment of Jordanes’
Getica derived from Priscus, he describes them as a savage tribe “practicing only hunting
and no other form of labour except that when they increased in numbers, they harassed
the neighbouring peoples with treachery and rapine” (24. 123-26). Of their siege of
Naissus (443 C.E.), Priscus describes “machines” that the Huns brought up to the circuit
wall: beams mounted on wheels for men to stand upon to shoot at defenders on ramparts,
screens woven from rawhide and leather to shield from missiles, and “rams” which
consisted of a beam suspended by chains from timbers with short ropes for the men to
manipulate from the ground (Fr. 1b Blockley, 6.2.1-36; Blockley 1972: 22). The most
vivid and detailed descriptions that Priscus provides are of the camp of Attila and of the
sights he saw and the people he encountered.
In 449 C.E. Priscus was invited by Maximinus, an Eastern Roman official, to
accompany him on an embassy to Attila. Although the roles of both the men in the
embassy are unclear, it is likely that Priscus accompanied Maximinus as a personal friend
and possibly his secretary. The events leading up to the embassy began with the visit of
Edeco, a Hunnic commander, to Constantinople. His purpose was to deliver a letter to the
emperor from Attila accusing the Romans of harbouring Hunnic fugitives. The eunuch
Chrysaphius, along with his translator Vigilas, bribed Edeco to assassinate Attila upon his
return (Exc. De Leg. Gent 5). It is likely that Maximinus, and through him Priscus, knew



20
nothing of this plan as they journeyed into Hunnic territory (Blockley 1981: 64; Exc. De
Leg. Rom. 3).
On his way Priscus described the “barbarian” villages that he saw. Coming from a
social and historical tradition that saw nomads as the lowest level of savagery, Priscus
may have been surprised by what he saw. Instead of tents and wagons he saw settlements
abundantly stocked with provisions. The food he observed did not possess the quality of
typical Roman fare, yet neither was it raw meat and vegetable roots. In place of wheat the
Huns ate millet, and drank medos instead of wine. Priscus also describes a drink made
from barley that the locals called kamon (Exc. De Leg. Rom. 3). He wrote in great detail
of the ceremony surrounding Attila’s entrance into a village and the songs they sang in
their language (Exc. De Leg. Rom. 3).
Through Jordanes, Priscus describes a village that resembled a large city. It had
wooden walls made of smooth planks, dining rooms of great dimensions, and colonnades
with lavish decoration (34. 178-80, 182). The tone of this description is important because
while Priscus was a Roman writing in the fifth century C.E., Jordanes, a man of Gothic
background living in a Roman province on the lower Danube, wrote his history of the
Goths a century later in an entirely different social and political context. The image of the
Hunnic village (described as “a very large city”) comes from Jordanes’ interpretation and
translation of Priscus’ words, not from Priscus himself, and it is not clear if the
description comes from Priscus or from Jordanes’ commentary (Traina 1993: 288). It is
difficult to imagine that Priscus, coming from the heart of the Roman Empire, would have
seen wooden walls as emblematic of a great city. Also through Jordanes, Priscus
describes an area of the courtyard enclosed by a high wall resembling a royal palace
(34.178-80,182). This was the seat of Attila.



21
Like most ancient historians, Priscus couched many of his observations in moral
terms (Blockley 1981: 63; Maas 1995: 149). A description of Attila in extraordinary
detail is attributed to him in Jordanes’ Getica.
Attila was a man born in the world for the shattering of nations, the terror of all the lands who, through some chance, made all quake as his fearsome reputation spread aboard. His gait was haughty, and he cast his eyes hither and thither, so that the power of his pride was reflected in the movements of his body. Though a lover of war, he was not prone to violence. He was a very wise counselor, merciful to those who sought it and loyal to those whom he had accepted as friends. He was short, with a broad chest and large head; his eyes were small, his beard sparse and flecked with grey, his nose flat and his complexion dark, which showed the signs of his origin (Jordanes Get. 34.178-80,182).
Priscus describes Attila as a strong and decisive leader, striking a sharp contrast
with those on the Roman side: generals Anatolius and Theodulus, and the “cowardly”
emperor Theodosius (Blockley 1981: 63; Kelly 2008: 199). Yet rather than highlighting
obvious differences between Hunnic and Roman society Priscus appears to focus on
cultural similarities such as architecture, bathing habits, clothing, and food (Kelly 2008:
193). This assumption, however, is problematic as much of Priscus’ work is missing from
the historical record. Nevertheless, it is evident through his work that Priscus began to
find misleading the description of Huns as simply “barbarians” (Kelly 2008: 189).
Priscus describes in great detail the experience of dining with Attila. Seats were
arranged around the walls of the building on both sides with Attila sitting upon a couch in
the centre. His bed was behind him, screened by fine linens and multi-coloured
ornamental hangings that Priscus described as similar to those which the Greeks and
Romans prepared for weddings (Exc. De Leg. Rom 3). Attendants entered serving meat,
bread, and cooked foods on lavishly prepared silver platters (Exc. De Leg. Rom 3).
Priscus notes that while his guests were dining and drinking from plates and goblets of



22
silver and gold, Attila ate his meat on a wooden plate and drank from a simple wooden
cup (Exc. De Leg. Rom 3). His clothing was also plain and his sword, boots, and horse’s
bridle were unadorned (Exc. De Leg. Rom 3). While his company was talking and
laughing, Attila remained aloof from the festivities (Kelly 2008: 188). This passage
describing the dichotomy between Attila and his followers adds to the image of the
Hunnic leader. Attila’s greed for gold and fervent insistence on the return of Hunnic
fugitives paints the picture of a man anxious about his empire and the loyalty of his
followers. Perhaps the increasing demand for Roman gold served to maintain and reward
his followers and to keep them from betraying him in the face of lavish Roman bribes.
Writing of Attila’s death, Priscus describes the way the men cut off sections of
their hair and disfigured their “already hideous faces” with deep gashes in mourning, “not
with womanly tears and wailings, but with the blood of men” (Jordanes Getica 49.254
58). Attila’s body was lain out in a silken tent and the best horsemen rode around Attila in
a circle reciting a funeral chant. His body was then bound in three coffins: first with gold,
then silver, and third “with the strength of iron” (Jordanes Getica 49.254-58).
These images of Attila and his followers are drastically different from the pictures
painted by Ammianus, writing only a century earlier. Ammianus described brutish,
ragged nomads eating roots and raw meat and sleeping on horseback. Priscus writes of
men eating lavishly prepared meals and living in palace-like dwellings. Both historians
describe the scarred faces of the Hunnic men and while Ammianus undoubtedly received
this description from an historical source or informant, Priscus saw these men first-hand.
Ammianus’ Huns scarred the faces of their children, while those in Priscus’ later
reckoning performed the ritual in mourning. They are both writing of the same element of



23
Hunnic society but perhaps the time in which they wrote, their background, and their
personal convictions contributed to their very different interpretations.
In addition to describing Attila the Hun, Priscus writes of three other encounters
during his stay. He describes a man who began his life as a merchant on the Danube, was
enslaved by Hunnic forces, and eventually attained his freedom in the household of
Onegesius, one of Attila’s foremost chieftains. The man explains to Priscus that his life
among the Huns is far superior to his past within the boundaries of Rome (Maas 1995:
150). The merchant argues that Romans are subject to uneven justice where the poor are
punished and the rich can buy their freedom (Maas 1993: 150). Priscus defends the
Empire by arguing for the virtue of Rome’s founding fathers and enduring social systems
(Maas 1995: 150). The man retorts: “the laws were fair and the Roman polity was good,
but...the authorities were ruining it by not taking the same thought for it as those of old”
(Exc. De Leg. Rom. 3). Kelly (2008: 196) argues that because Priscus did not respond to
this final statement, he may have agreed. His description of their conversation displays a
contrast between life in the Roman Empire and life in the “barbarian” periphery that, in
its nature, was atypical of his time.
Priscus’ following two encounters with Onegesius and Zercon (the Huns’ court
jester) follow a similar theme. The tale of Onegesius is one of freedom and personal
allegiance. To Priscus’ disbelief he rejects a Roman bribe, preferring to remain a
barbarian (Maas 1995: 154). Here, Priscus explores what it means to be a slave under
Attila and to be free in Rome. Unlike the others, Zercon does not have the opportunity to
make choices and manipulate his identity. The man, a Moorish dwarf, is trapped: he
exists both inside and outside Hunnic society (Maas 1995: 157). Whether truth or parable,
these tales illuminate elements of Hunnic culture and society and illustrate how Priscus



24
used his experiences in his composition to hint at the lost ‘riches’ of Rome (Maas 1995:
160).
Priscus wrote in an elevated and classicizing manner, adopting a classical style in
his text (Blockley 1981: 52; Traina 1993: 287). Numbers appear rarely in his surviving
work, and Blockley (1981: 52) suggests they were likely not more frequent in the
complete text. When Priscus uses numbers he most commonly does so to refer to specific
details of a treaty, such as numbers of fugitives or amounts of gold. This suggests that the
details of diplomatic relations were of most interest to him, or perhaps to the compilers of
the Excerpta, a body of work focused on diplomacy (Blockley 1981: 52).
Priscus’ discussions of military affairs, in contrast to Ammianus, are perhaps his
weakest sections. His failure to consider the strategic and logistical aspects of the Roman
military situation reflects his lack of interest and knowledge in military history (Blockley
1981: 64). Numbers of troops are never given; he instead uses phrases like “a great host
of barbarians” (Blockley 1981: 52). Because of his lack of time-indicators, distances, and
geographical detail, his description of Attila’s camp has not settled the dispute over its
location. Many scholars argue that the camp was located on the North-eastern part of the
Hungarian Plain (Browning 1953: 143). Browning (1953: 143-145) argues that an
alternative reading of Priscus suggests that Maximinus and his party did not arrive on the
plain of Hungary, but instead in Wallachia, a location more conducive to Attila’s eastern
ambitions.
Priscus was a vocal critic of Theodosius’ policy of appeasement. Personal reasons
(including the Hunnic devastation of Thrace and the heavy tax burden imposed by tribute
payments) may have factored into his opinion (Blockley 1981: 64). Blockley (1981: 65)
argues that Theodosius’ error was not in refusing to fight the Huns, as Priscus implies, but



25
in provoking war in 441 C.E. through his failure to return the fugitives. Priscus does not
spend a great deal of his work discussing events in the Western Roman Empire, although
his perception of the fracturing of that part of the empire into separate ‘states’ is well
illustrated by Fr. 30, where he speaks of Italians, Goths, and Franks instead of Romans
(Blockley 1981: 67). However, these deficiencies may only be present in the few
surviving fragments of his text and might serve only to obscure many of his qualities as
an historian (Blockley 1981: 70).
While he did not write specifically about the Huns, the third historian serving as a
focus of this section wrote about embassies to individual Turkic leaders. The work of
Menander the Protector provides a useful point of ethnographic comparison (of both the
historian and his subject) with that of Priscus and the embassy to Attila. Almost all that is
known about Menander comes from the preface of his History (Blockley 1985: 1). He
was born in Constantinople in the middle of the sixth century C.E., and while he trained
for a legal career he did not become an advocate (Blockley 1985: 1). He writes that he
was drawn by the awards that Emperor Maurice bestowed upon writers so he decided to
continue the History of Agathias after the latter’s death (Suda M591). It is unknown
whether his work was commissioned by the emperor or a powerful minister, although it is
clear that he had access to imperial archives (Blockley 1985: 1). Blockley (1985: 1)
suggests that the reward he received was likely an appointment as a protector. During this
time, a protector was not necessarily involved in the military so it is likely that Menander
had a diplomatic career, possibly explaining his focus on diplomatic relations over
military matters (Blockley 1985: 1).
Menander’s style of writing is influenced by rhetoric, poetry, and drama; and the
structure of his work is mainly geographical and topical (Blockley 1985: 5, 6). His work



26
was preserved in fragments in the Excerpta de Sententiis and de Legationibus and is thus,
like Priscus, subject to the biases of the compilers. Taking this into account, the material
preserved from the History suggests that his interests centered upon Roman relations with
other peoples, particularly the Avars and the Persians (Blockley 1985: 5, 6, 13). Of
interest to this study are his descriptions of two separate embassies to the Turks c. 569-71
and 575-76 C.E. where he wrote about the camps and of interactions with individual
Turkic rulers.
In 569 C.E. the emperor Justin II decided to send an embassy to the Turkish camp
of Dizabul in Sogdiana and ordered Zemarchus (a general in command of the eastern
armies) to lead it along with Maniakh (a Turkic envoy) and his companions (Exc. De Leg.
Gent. 7). Upon entering the land of the Sogdians some men who claimed the ability to
ward off “ill-omened things” began to perform a ritual on the bags of the travelers (Exc.
De Leg. Rom. 8). Menander describes the ritual in vivid detail.
They set fire to branches of the frankincense tree, chanted some barbarous words in their Scythian tongue, making noise with bells and drums, waved about the baggage frankincense boughs as they were crackling with flames, and, falling into a frenzy and acting like madmen, supposed that they were driving away evil spirits (Exc. De Leg. Rom. 8).
His description of these events conforms to the Classical ideology of the nomad.
These Turks appear more like the savage barbarians of Ammianus than the ‘civilized’
Huns of Priscus. As Priscus entered the village of Attila he too witnessed singing and
dancing, yet unlike Priscus, Menander described a primitive ritual.
Menander also describes three separate dwellings that were visited. Each was
more spectacular than the last.
[The first tent] was furnished with silken hangings dyed without skill in various colours. They did not drink wine like ours which is squeezed from grape, for their land does not support the grape vine, and that species of



27
plant is not native to their area. They drank their fill of another barbarous kind of sweet wine. [The second hut] was similarly decorated with multi-coloured silken hangings. In it stood statues of different shapes. Sizabul sat there on a couch made completely of gold. In the middle of the building were golden urns, water-sprinklers and also golden pitchers. [The third dwelling had]...gilded wooden pillars and a couch of beaten gold which was supported by four golden peacocks. In front of this dwelling were drawn up over a wide area wagons containing many silver objects, dishes and bowls, and a large number of statues of animals, also of silver and in no way inferior to those which we make; so wealthy is the ruler of the Turks (Exc. De Leg. Rom. 8).
Like Priscus, Menander writes of the surprising opulence of his surroundings. The
descriptions of the “silken hangings” and pieces of gold and silver appear as both praise
and scorn. While Priscus describes the Hunnic medos with curiosity, Menander describes
the “unusually sweet” Turkish wine with disdain. This is juxtaposed with his description
of silver dishes, bowls, and statues of fine craftsmanship.
The second embassy, in 575 C.E., was led by Valentinus, an imperial bodyguard
(Exc. De Leg. Rom 14). They met a mourning Turxanthus somewhere in the Altay
Mountains where he told them that his father, Sizabul, had recently died and implored
them to slash their faces with daggers in the custom of his people. Following this, four
captives were placed in the grave with Sizabul. The slashing of the face and the burial of
captives parallels Priscus’ description of the funeral of Attila. Both of these historians
seemed to be aware of a similar custom among different groups which could suggest that
this ritualized mourning was prevalent among mobile barbarians and that Ammianus had
likely misinterpreted the information he undoubtedly received from a third party.
The three historians discussed in this section have vastly different relationships
with their subjects in both time and space. Ammianus’ Huns existed long before Attila
and his confederacy. Lacking political, social, and geographical unity, they likely



28
resembled more closely the nomadic raiders leading wagons and horses of Ammianus’
writing than the settled barbarian aristocracy described by Priscus. The Turks described
by Menander lived much later than Attila’s “Empire,” yet they bore similarities to the
Huns of both Ammianus and Priscus. Like Priscus, Menander describes objects made of
precious metal and expertly-crafted statues, yet there is a fundamental difference: instead
of a settlement he describes wagons and tents. Attila’s Huns appeared to Priscus as a
settled people, apart from their nomadic legacy, while Menander’s Turks more closely
resemble Ammianus’ nomadic Huns. Among other things this suggests that it was not
only the Roman Empire that underwent transition during the centuries following the
Huns’ entrance into Europe. Their political, economic, military, and social structure more
than likely underwent significant changes resulting from the change in terrain as they
travelled across the steppe, the style of leadership as they transitioned into single rule, and
the nature of their social and military life as they moved into a more sedentary existence.
2.3 The Secondary Literature
The primary texts vary fundamentally, allowing for a wide range of interpretation
about Hunnic warfare and of the importance of Attila in Late Roman history. Some
modern historians like Hyun Kim (2013) argue that for a short period of time, from 440
455 C.E., the Huns formed the first steppe “empire.” Proponents of this view suggest that
Hunnic raids combined with their superior military skill made a major impact, if not
acting as the decisive factor, in the fall of the Western Roman Empire (Kim 2013: 69).
These assumptions of their military prowess are primarily based upon the ancient sources
who describe the Huns as fearsome mounted archers. Inconsistencies between the



29
historical and archaeological records on this point pose significant issues. Elton (1996:
58, 63, 64) suggests that long distance weapons such as bows were less common than
previously accepted because archaeological evidence is rare. Conversely, Mitchell (2007:
198) argues that fragments of Olympiodorus (Fr. 19) confirm the reputation of the Huns
as formidable archers (Maenchen-Helfen 1973: 73). Kim (2013: 46, 69), whose argument
of Hunnic dominance is centered on a well-organized and powerful Hunnic military,
denies sole dependence on archery, arguing that the Alans and various Turkic tribes
would likely have possessed similar weapons.
Since Edward Gibbon’s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire (1776-1788), the
historical treatment of the Huns has undergone many trends and transitions. As a source
of information Ammianus has transitioned from Gibbon’s “accurate and faithful guide”
(Gibbon 1776-1788: 2.26. 1073-4) whose work is a “stylistic masterpiece” (Maenchen
Helfen 1973: 1) to a morally biased pagan (Hunt and Drijvers 1999: 5) peddling
“mythical” accounts of events he knew little about (Kim 2013: 17; King 1987: 77). Other
modern readings lie somewhere in between. For example, Goldsworthy (2009: 314)
questions the powerful image of Attila but appears to accept Ammianus’ physical
description of the Huns. Priscus’ account is somewhat less controversial, although much
is made of his stylistic approach and political biases (Blockley 1981: 54, 58, 63-69). He is
typically viewed as an excellent eyewitness to Hunnic society because he provides a
contemporary Roman assessment of Hunnic power (Kim 2013: 54; Mitchell 2007: 200).
Only fragments remain of the large body of history written during the Late Roman
Empire, leaving limited avenues through which to assess Hunnic impact. Kim (2013: 2)
argues that modern scholars rely too heavily upon exclusively Greco-Roman sources: an
approach that he believes falls short of providing satisfactory answers. He perceives a



30
lack of enthusiasm among modern historians for comparative studies and for the use of
available Central Asian historical data (Kim 2013: 19). To which data he is specifically
referring is not clear as his main preoccupation lies with the secondary literature. He
argues that without a doubt the end of the Western Roman Empire was brought about by
the Huns. This was theoretically accomplished not only through military might, but also a
Hunnic intervention in Roman internal affairs that prevented the empire from resolving
the “barbarian problem,” leading to the erosion of Roman military capacity in the face of
a growing barbarian tide (Kim 2013: 49, 130). To Kim (2013: 4, 19) the Huns not only
destroyed an existing political and social system, but also left behind their own cultural
heritage – a legacy of their sophisticated ‘early’ state structure. Kim’s Hunnic Empire
played a decisive role in the unraveling of Roman hegemony over what would later
become Western Europe and actively facilitated the creation of the German successor
kingdoms (Kim 2013: 7). However, despite this emphasis, Kim (2013: 89) concedes that
the almost immediate breakup of the Hunnic Empire after the death of Attila suggests that
perhaps they were not as organized after all.
It has been postulated that the organizational failure of the post-Attila Huns was a
result of their dependence on Roman gold (Heather 2009: 237, 254, 264). Some argue
that the “Hunnic Empire” was nothing more than a “primitive protection racket” that
endured mainly through extortion and blackmail (Kelly 2009: 47; Thompson 1948: 236).
Unlike Kim, Thompson (1948: 234) suggests that the arrival of the Huns prompted no
new social or productive forces that could have transformed the Roman Empire. In fact,
he argued that the Huns actually slowed the process of “German dismemberment” and
delayed the collapse of the Roman Empire (Thompson 1948: 235,236). Maenchen
Helfen’s (1973: 12) arguments align with Thompson to an extent, although he argues that



31
to plunder on the scale the Huns did would not have been possible without a military
organization and commanders to plan campaigns and coordinate attack forces.
Kelly (2008: 277) argues for the continuity rather than the collapse of the Roman
state, with new rulers preparing to accept Roman forms of governance. Although he
agrees that there was great political change in the fifth century C.E., he contends that
Attila cannot be held responsible. The Hunnic king could not be blamed for the fall of the
Western Roman Empire, nor could he have foreseen it, yet Kelly (2008: 278) argues that
it could not have happened without him and without his untimely death. In direct
encounters with the Roman army the Huns were not particularly impressive. They
sustained heavy casualties at Utus River in 447 C.E., and the Battle of the Catalaunian
Plains in 451 C.E. was arguably a stalemate (Kelly 2008: 288). Attila’s strategic
brilliance, according to Kelly (2008: 288) lay not in fighting the Romans, but in avoiding
large-scale confrontation.
In an effort to reconsider some of the processes and events which accompanied
the fall of the western half of the Roman Empire, Heather (1995: 29) argues that the
Hunnic victories of the 440s C.E. were less dangerous to the Western Empire than the
sudden disappearance of Hunnic power after the death of Attila in 453. Hunnic military
power could no longer be used by the Romans to enforce their policy of military
containment towards the immigrants that had already established themselves in Western
Europe (Heather 1995: 29). The West was also short of funds and could no longer have
afforded to pay the Huns; re-employment would also have been especially difficult after
the devastation they had so recently caused (Heather 1995: 30). Heather (1995: 37) argues
that the Hunnic Empire under Attila was no more than a “sideshow” to the dramatic



32
collapse of the West and that the indirect impact of the Huns upon the Roman Empire was
of much greater importance than the war with Attila.
The variations in modern historical interpretation are not limited to natural
changes in scholarly practice over the course of decades and centuries. Historians writing
over the last 20 years (Heather 1995, Barnes 1998, Kelly 2008, Kim 2013) disagree on
fundamental aspects of the historical question: Hunnic military culture, the veracity of
Ammianus Marcellinus, and most significantly, the part played by Attila and the Huns in
the collapse of the Western Roman Empire. These historians, for the most part, draw from
the same sources of information: the historical and archaeological record. Some place
more importance on the material record than the historical, while others (like Kim)
emphasize the Asian over the European sources on the Huns. The gulfs between the
different modern interpretations seem to be rooted in each individual sorting the few
remaining sources of evidence by a different order of importance. It is, therefore, the
objective of this study to analyse these sources, beginning from the previous discussion of
the literature and continuing throughout the remaining chapters, in order to negotiate the
differences in historical discourse and to evaluate the importance of the Huns at the end
of the Western Roman Empire.

CHAPTER 3
MORTUARY ARCHAEOLOGY: THEORY
3.1 Introduction
The most enduring image of the Hun in many modern histories is the mounted
archer. E. Luttwak (1976: 20, 22) wrote that the Huns “introduced an entirely new and
highly effective style of warfare into the Roman world” and that there is “no doubt that
Hun archery was an innovation in warfare, partly because it was combined with
exceptional horse mobility at all levels – tactical, operational, strategic – and partly
because of the new weapon.” However, there are significant gaps between archaeological
and historical evidence and it is important to examine these critically in order to form a
more realistic picture of Hunnic warfare in the context of the Western Roman Empire.
In order to examine the Huns in an archaeological context the limitations and
possibilities of the archaeology of war inside and outside of the Late Roman Empire must
be considered. This will be followed by an analysis of mortuary archaeological theory in
the context of the Late Roman Empire focusing on dating, ethnicity, representativeness
and taphonomic processes. This analysis will revolve around what it is possible to infer
about Hunnic military practices by examining contemporary burial assemblages, why
archaeological evidence of conflict in this era is so sparse, and why it is still difficult to
pinpoint the exact location of many large-scale conflicts, such as the Battle of the
Catalaunian Plains (451 C.E.). Perhaps most important is the question of why the
prevalence of weapons so far recorded in these funerary contexts does not match the
literary descriptions that place so much importance on Hunnic mounted archery.



34
3.2 Archaeology of War
By nature, archaeological evidence is anonymous and fragmentary with much
depending on deposition, survival, recovery, and research (James 2013: 94). While site
analysis can often be corroborated with historical evidence and provide physical details
about past societies, archaeological evidence is rarely able to provide a full and complete
picture.
James (2013: 94) argues that the most important role of Late Roman archaeology
is to provide a view of the many “barbarian” groups in the classical world that is
undistorted by Greco-Roman prejudices or misunderstandings. Archaeology can
theoretically provide a wider picture of these societies not only at war but also during
times of peace. Barbarian groups like the Huns (who, like all other European barbarians,
were illiterate) have no documented histories of their own and as such, much of what is
written about them comes from a Roman perspective. James is partially correct in his
assertion because there is a chance that future archaeological research will uncover
previously unknown information or aid in the dispelling of modern accepted assumptions,
yet without the benefit of Greek and Roman texts there is little to no context for
interpretation. As flawed as these accounts are, without them modern scholars are left
without a starting point in an incomplete and largely unreadable record. The
archaeological interpretation of both what is and what is not observable is vital.
3.3 Material Evidence: Arms and Armour
Archaeology significantly broadens scholarly comprehension of the practical
realities of ancient warfare. One example is the breakthrough in the understanding of



35
Roman-era saddles. Stirrups were not introduced to Europe until after the fall of the
Western Empire and before the 1970s it was assumed that stirrup-less cavalry (in
comparison to the shock cavalry of medieval and later times) could only have been of
relatively limited effectiveness (James 2013: 112). Not having a secure seat was thought
to restrict the rider’s stability and force with which to wield a weapon for fear of falling.
Archaeologists studied the remains of Roman saddles in combination with reconstruction
and practical experimentation and the prevailing assumption was proved incorrect. These
Roman saddles (Figures 2 and 3) had four upstanding pommels (two in front of the rider’s
legs and two behind) that prevented the rider from sliding forward or backward (Connolly
and van Driel-Murray 1991: 33). Once the problem was no longer falling off the horse,
experiments demonstrated that mounting and dismounting required the rider to vault on or
off, which according to these experiments, is easily learned (James 2013: 113).

3.4 Skeletal Evidence
The same archaeological conditions that apply to sites and material remains apply
to the bodies of the dead. James (2013: 101) notes the remarkable lack of war dead in the
archaeological record and the fact that there has yet to be an identified and scientifically
studied mass battlefield grave. There are two likely reasons for this: most soldiers did not
die on the battlefield and when they did, various processes contributed to the dispersal or
loss of the skeletons. Those fatally wounded often succumbed to their injuries after the
battle, possibly days after the engagement. The practice of victorious troops and local
people of stripping the corpses of clothing, weapons, and equipment, hasty on-field
burials (and the enemy dead left where they fell), human and animal scavenging of these



37
shallow burials, removal and burial of bodies in other locations, and complete obliteration
due to weathering contributed heavily to the loss of battlefield dead (Whately 2013: 139).
Upon the discovery of human remains in this context, differentiating between
physical traces on the skeleton resulting from combat and those of an anomalous, genetic,
taphonomic, or ‘ordinary’ nature is both very important and often problematic. Some
genetic conditions can present similarly to trauma6 and animal scavenging or other post
mortem wear can create trauma-like markings on bone. It is also possible to infer
‘occupation’ or ‘repetitive action’ by analysing musculoskeletal wear. Many activities
that involve heavy labour can result in enlarged areas of muscle attachment and/or
regions of erosion (Byers 2008: 374). While it is possible to draw certain conclusions
about ‘occupation,’ there are numerous explanations for robust muscle attachment sites
and a great deal depends on the context in which the human remains exist. For example,
without context a male skeleton exhibiting robusticity in humeri, radii, and/or ulnae does
not unequivocally suggest archery. However, when similar human remains are put into a
military context, archery seems more likely than agricultural work.7
Most battlefield trauma during the Late Empire was caused by swords, spears,
javelins, or arrows, and would have most commonly appeared on the extremities (Salazat
2013: 297). For most Roman soldiers the left arm was typically protected by a large
shield, leaving the right arm and thighs as the easiest targets. Most simple flesh wounds
(not likely to show on the skeleton) were less serious than those deep enough to reach the
bone and were most frequently inflicted by spears and arrows rather than swords because
6 An example of this is a sternal foramen (or perforated sternum): a developmental variant of the sternum resulting from incomplete fusion of the sternal ossification centres. Under certain conditions it can look remarkably like a bullethole in the chest (Bermio and Hemalatha 2014: 547). 7 For a discussion of the types of occupational markers, see Wilczak and Kennedy 1998.



38
they more often had sufficient impact to penetrate deeply (Salazat 2013: 298). Axes,
while rare, could also injure and in some cases even completely sever bones. Accounts of
bone-shattering wounds, however, do not typically appear in ancient sources because
weapons like maces were rare in the Late Empire. This type of injury only became
common after the introduction of firearms (Salazat 2013: 298). Unfortunately, little is
known about the fracturing of bone by arrows, although extensive shattering is not
expected from this type of low velocity projectile (Byers 2008: 308).
The most dangerous and likely fatal wounds were penetrating wounds to the head,
chest, and abdomen, particularly by spears or arrows. These injuries were frequent among
the more lightly armoured troops (archers, for example) as they were more likely to be
wearing leather caps or no head protection at all (Salazat 2013: 298). Given sufficient
impact, even body armour was not reliable; it was primarily designed to reduce injury
rather than block all attacks. Cranial trauma was also caused by blows from blunt objects,
or stones shot by catapults (Salazat 2013: 298), and eye wounds were not always fatal due
in large part to the advanced surgical practices of the time (Bartsiokas 2000: 512; Rubini
and Zaio 2011: 1556; Salazat 2013: 298).
Infection was very common in wounds of both flesh and bone, and in the case of
large gashes to the abdomen there was the additional problem of the intestines prolapsing
through the wound (Salazat 2013: 298). Any major wound also carried a serious threat of
haemorrhaging. For an army surgeon one of the most demanding tasks was the extraction
or excision of a missile (Salazat 2013: 301). Arrows were difficult to extract without
breaking and leaving pieces behind, which in many cases would cause inflammation
(Sarauw 2007: 73). A large percentage of Late Antique arrowheads were barbed, making



39
them more difficult to extract (Salazat 2013: 301). If the arrow was stuck in the bone,
often the bone had to be scraped, drilled into, or excised.
As previously mentioned, many combat-related fatalities occurred off the
battlefield. An army’s mortality rate was also impacted by accident, drowning, and
disease, not to mention the trauma of post-injury medical treatment (Salazat 2013:
299,304). No internal (and very few external) analgesics appear in ancient texts, such as
Celsus’ first century CE De Medicina, and when pain relief is mentioned it is usually in
the context of colic, pleurisy, and other painful medical conditions; rarely is it mentioned
in connection with pain resulting from a wound (Salazar 2013: 304). The pain of injury,
not to mention the traumatic process of attending to the wound without an analgesic,
sometimes caused the soldier to die of shock.
Skeletal remains can provide a useful index for assessing trauma in a wide variety
of contexts (Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1556). Accidental injuries can reflect day-to-day
living and violence-related wounds provide a good testimony of conflict. The Lombard
Avar cemetery of Campochiaro in Molise, Central Italy (sixth to eight centuries C.E.) is a
good example that will be discussed briefly here and expanded upon in Chapter 4.6.
Rubini and Zaio (2011: 1551) argue that the military nature of this settlement is indicated
by the osteoarchaeological evidence of warfare and violence present on three sets of
remains (all adult males above the age of 50). One individual (grave n.20) exhibited
deeply imprinted muscular insertion areas, especially on the humeri and the proximal end
of the linea aspera of the femora, which could be connected with hard activity of these
muscle masses like drawing a bow and riding a horse. Pronounced muscle attachment
sites typically associated with horseback riding also appear often in the shoulder and
elbow, and in many cases the bones in the right and left hand are asymmetrical from



40
holding reins, hunting tools, or weapons in the dominant hand (Anđelinović et al. 2015:
711, 717). Rubin and Zaio (2011: 1556) conclude that the three individuals in their study
show clear traces of trauma from weapons because, in part, their shapes could not be
attributed to an every-day event or accident. The great number of weapons, helmets, and
shields that were among the grave-goods at Campochiaro contributed to the identification
of these individuals as soldiers.
In addition to pronounced muscle attachment sites, the human skeleton can exhibit
numerous other forms of trauma related to mounted archery. Degenerative joint disease in
the cervical and lumbar vertebrae is often associated with habitual horseback riding. To
maintain a proper position in the saddle (a physically demanding task), the leg,
abdominal, and back muscles are heavily loaded, leading to flexibility and strength
adaptations in the muscles, tendons, and bones (Khudaverdyan et al. 2016: 47, 57, 61).
There are also physiological adaptations observed in the clavicle and forearm bones in
response to heavy use of the upper limb muscles, and the presence of enthesopathies (the
abnormal attachment of a tendon or ligament to a bone) is linked with repeated forceful
use of the upper limb muscles (Thomas 2014: 279; Tihanyi et al. 2015: 68). Medical
studies show that the type of equipment used (light or heavy; short or long bow), shooting
posture, draw technique, and level of training have a discernable impact on the severity,
location, and degree of asymmetry and injury present on the skeleton (Thomas 2014:
285). Tihanyi et al. (2015: 73) observe that while there is no evident physiological
difference between the arm holding the bow and the arm pulling the string, they note clear
differences between the phalanges (finger bones) of the right and left hand. Under ideal
conditions, there could be observable differences between the bony lesions correlated



41
with different shooting techniques (i.e. drawing with one, two, or three fingers); however,
these small bones are infrequently recovered and therefore very difficult to study.
3.5 Burial/Military Assemblages
Due to their nomadic lifestyle, much of the direct archaeological evidence of the
Huns comes from burial sites. Looking for evidence of warfare in the context of burial
assemblages raises significant questions about what should be considered normal in a
civilian versus a military assemblage and whether it is possible to accurately tell the
difference (Allason-Jones 1999: 1).
There are clear hazards to speculating from finds assemblages, and questions
raised by these issues play a large role in this discussion of Hunnic military practices.
This illustrates one of the greatest difficulties of analysing a weapons grave or military
assemblage. While the Roman military had perhaps a greater opportunity for equipment
standardization,8 this is not the case with the diverse array of equipment utilized by bands
of Huns and other barbarians. Any attempt to identify individual units of the Roman
army, for example, or even to distinguish between different barbarian groups in the
representation of their equipment is generally misguided (Campbell 2013: 419).
It can be assumed that equipment frequently changed hands in the case of trade,
inheritance, exchange, plundering, and grave robbing, and that at any given time a soldier
was in possession of a weapon that was not made specifically for him. Thus, it cannot be
assumed that a weapon interred with an individual was either made for or even used by
8 The standardization of arms would likely have mirrored the desire to standardize fighting style and thus form a more cohesive group. Elton (1996: 110) argues that the equipment worn by the Romans gave them a distinct advantage over their adversaries.



42
him during life. Additionally, the definition of an assemblage as military (or otherwise)
provides context through which to interpret the remains. Yet, in many cases, a military
assemblage is so-titled because of the goods it contains. Both of these opposing lines of
inquiry affect the interpretation of the site and of the individual(s) interred there.
It is important to note that a soldier’s life was not entirely made up of battles.
Similarly, much of what is known of the Huns is of a military nature; however, it is not
reasonable to assume that the entirety of their lives was consumed with acts of combat
and warfare. The picture of the Hunnic mounted archer who lived upon his horse is an
exaggeration. Living in their camps were men, women, and children whose culture
consisted of more than warfare9 (Bona 2002: 31). As in any Roman case, weaponry
discovered in a Hunnic-era barbarian burial must be examined in a context broader than
“this individual was buried with a weapon therefore he must have been a soldier.”
3.6 Weapons Graves
Funerary archaeology (and weapons graves specifically) has been employed to
identify populations in the archaeological record and to track the movement of particular
people, customs, and ideas over time and space. Tracking changes in burial practices is
used to determine both the geographical origins of new burial customs and the impact of
these on local populations (Halsall 1992: 202). There are many facets of Late Antique
burial practice that must be considered (social, economic, religious, etc.) in order to better
understand the origin, function, and meaning of these practices.
9 Hunnic cauldrons, for example, represent some of the only archaeological evidence specific to the Huns: both their distribution and the context in which they were found leave little doubt of their origin (Maenchen-Helfen 1973: 306-337).



43
Weapons became common grave goods for peoples in eastern and central Europe
around the time the Roman frontier was established in the end of the first century C.E.
For example, many Hunnic-era funerary deposits contain weapons, something that will be
expanded upon subsequently (Goldsworthy 2009: 107). The presence of weapons in these
sites has been linked to numerous processes ranging from shifts in tactics, weapon sets,
fighting processes, and social status (Härke 1990: 22). Since the 1960s, interpretations of
weapons burials have undergone many historiographical and methodological changes and
it is important to discuss these interpretations in order to better understand the various
historical and archaeological perspectives of the Huns and their weapons burial practices.
The idea of an archaeological ‘culture’ composed of a specific type of remains
(implements, burial rites, etc.) frequently recurring together emerged at the end of the
nineteenth century (Halsall 2010: 23; Meriander 1981: 101; Trigger 2006: 216). This led
to narratives of cultures moving from one area to another and the use of archaeological
material to track the invasion and settlement of several non-Roman peoples into the
Empire (Halsall 2010: 23-4). A change in ‘archaeological culture’ was therefore typically
interpreted as a sign of ‘diffusion’ through migration or invasion. This Culture-History
approach to archaeology attempted to link sites to an historical or political narrative and
fell out of favour around World War Two when it took a decidedly nationalistic turn
(Halsall 2010: 24). It was replaced by Functionalist Archaeology (reaching its peak in the
1950s) whose proponents viewed cultures as functional systems wherein each internal
component served a specific purpose. Despite its occasionally environmental focus,
Functionalist Archaeology still relied on diffusion and migration for much of its
explanation of change. Emerging in the late 1950s, New Archaeology (later called
Processual Archaeology) in turn was interested in long-term developments, such as the



44
development of social organization or the collapse of complex societies, but often
neglected ideological explanation and removed the individual from history (Halsall 2010:
32).
The dominant response to Processual Archaeology was Post-Processual
Archaeology (c. 1970s-1980s) which viewed material culture as actively and
meaningfully constructed (Halsall 2010: 33). Through this lens of interpretation, objects
had the possibility of different meanings in different contexts. This proved valuable for
weapons graves because all weapons buried with individuals do not necessarily mean the
same thing. For example, a bow means one thing in the context of battle but could hold
another meaning in a burial context; a bow buried with a child is not likely to represent
the working equipment of that individual.
Funerary deposition of military equipment was always prevalent in small numbers
in previous periods of Roman history but the practice became more common in the fourth
century. Some argue that this is due to the practices of non-Roman groups moving within
the empire (Coulston 2013: 465). During the post-Roman period (the fifth and sixth
centuries C.E.) most Germanic groups on the Continent and England buried their dead
with grave goods ranging in type from dress ornaments to weapons (Härke 1990: 22).
This discovery came with a ‘convenient’ interpretation: warriors were buried with the
weaponry they used during their lives (Härke 1990: 22). This “Warrior graves”
assumption (hergewede) was mainly applied to Germanic graves which were then used to
reconstruct standard weapon sets, infer fighting practices, and to evaluate social and
economic processes (Härke 1990: 22, 3; Williams 2005: 202). Härke (1990: 24) argues
that these conventional views of weapons burials must be revisited because the “warrior
graves” assumption is simplistic and often misleading.



45
Questioning the validity of this theory not only contributes to the scholarship of
Anglo-Saxon burial rites, it also expands debate and weakens assumptions of Hunnic-era
weapons burials. Härke (1990: 28) describes the perceived changes over time in the
frequencies of weapons: axes and archery equipment were early types while others
appeared and reached their peak popularity as a burial deposit in subsequent centuries.
One theory suggests that this change (despite likely distortions through the burial rite)
could reflect an actual change in weaponry and fighting practices (Elton 1996: 58, 63,
64). It logically follows that if these are the graves of warriors there would be an expected
increase in the numbers of weapon burials in times of increased fighting. However, this
can be challenged by considering burials away from home, loss of weapons through a
variety of processes, and the practice of passing weapons into the hands of the living out
of necessity (Härke 1990: 28). Further, an analysis of archaeological and skeletal data of
inhumations from 47 cemeteries from the fifth to eighth centuries C.E. in England found
that one fifth (18%) of all inhumations and nearly half (47%) of the identifiably male
adult inhumation burials were accompanied by weapons (Härke 1990: 25). The weapons
in question were generally deposited in complete condition, although the variation
between cemeteries is immense (Härke 1990: 26).
Härke (1990: 29) explains that the change in weapon burial frequencies over time
did not conform to the theory. The earliest weapon burials of the Anglo-Saxon period are
dated to the first half of the fifth century with numbers increasing in the later part of the
century, reaching their peak around the middle of the sixth century. Change over time in
relative frequencies of weapon burials is difficult to determine, yet it appears that the
peak of the weapon burial rite falls where there was an historical absence (or decline in)
Anglo-Saxon military activity (Härke 1990: 32). A counter explanation could be that in



46
times of relative ‘peace’ there was a surplus of unused weaponry that could be
ceremonially interred with the deceased without causing a shortage. This is only one
(simplistic) explanation but its viability makes room for a more diverse array of theories.
Further evidence against the “warrior graves” assumption comes from the actual
weapons found in the graves since there were few cases of a soldier’s complete kit (Härke
1990: 33). In the Anglo-Saxon sample incomplete and non-functional sets account for
approximately 25% of all weapon combinations. The most frequent set (appearing in
approximately 50% of weapons burials) is a single spear. A spear together with a shield
appeared in 25% of weapons burials. All other combinations represent less than 10%,
suggesting that Anglo-Saxon weapons graves contained relatively basic weapons sets
(Härke 1990: 33, 53). Weapons found in graves could represent a selection of the actual
military equipment of the living. Similarly, not all weapons belonging to a deceased
individual were necessarily interred with him. Much (like expensive and skillfully crafted
swords) was likely handed down over several generations. Härke (1990: 35) argues that
some swords must have been very old when they were placed in a grave. This confounds
the interpretation that the weaponry buried necessarily suggests the style and equipment
of a particular time period.
Many factors complicate the interpretation of weapons graves and suggest a more
symbolic or ritualistic meaning. The age at death of those buried in weapons graves
ranges from 12 months to 60 years; clearly some of these individuals were not warriors.
Size and construction of some of these weapons indicate their use as a child’s toy, but not
in every case (Härke 1990: 35-36; Halsall 1992: 102-103). Additionally, weapons have
been found buried with individuals exhibiting osteoarthritis, malunited fractures of long
bones, and other skeletal deformations that could cause severe disability. Many of these



47
individuals would not have been capable of wielding the weapons found interred with
them (Sarauw 2007: 77). All of this evidence raises questions about the significance of
the type of weapon an individual was buried with and who was selected for or excluded
from a weapon burial and why. On average weapons burials have been found to be more
richly furnished with grave-goods than those without weapons (Härke 1990: 37). This
could be an indicator of status or, as Härke (1990: 40) argues, ethnicity. This concept
ethnicity (both Roman and barbarian) is problematic and will be returned to in greater
detail.
A recent avenue of interpretation focuses primarily on more complex information
about the burial practices themselves. The burial rite is seen as a social event to display
the status of the mourners towards a larger audience, with an understanding that the
deceased had very little active involvement in the ritual (Halsall 1992: 205; Morris 1992:
1; Sarauw 2007: 76 Williams 2005: 209). It is necessary to view the burial rite not only as
a reflection of the deceased but of the culture and ideas of the people performing it; a
burial ritual allows an opportunity for the living to define themselves in time and place
(Theuws and Alkemade 2000: 417). Studies of Anglo-Saxon cemeteries have revealed
that the funeral practice was linked to the maintenance of the status of the deceased’s
family (Halsall 1992: 198). In northern Gaul in the fourth century C.E., traditional Late
Roman burials began to appear with the addition of more lavish grave goods (Theuws and
Alkemade 2000: 404). Halsall (1992: 205) frames this shift in terms of social stress and
competition for community leadership. Thus, the appearance of lavishly furnished graves
(notably those containing weapons) demonstrated military power and occurred when
Roman central authority was not heavily felt (Halsall 1992: 206). It must be noted,



48
however, that the burial itself is only part of the death ritual; its importance and meaning
must therefore be assessed accordingly (Morris 1992: 13).
3.7 Royal Graves: The Tomb of Childeric
Studying burial ritual is important because of its significance in creating new
identities and because of the huge importance of cemetery evidence in Late Antiquity.
The question of whether it is possible to reconstruct the identity of an historical person
based on grave goods or whether the burial ritual is related to other aspects of society is
key in this discussion. The “rhetoric” of the burial ritual may have played a more
important role in the creation of future identities than in mirroring those of the past
(Theuws 2000: 10). By that token, the interpretation of a Hunnic-era weapons burial may
illustrate more about Hunnic society and culture than about specific military practices.
The tomb of Childeric I will be used here to exemplify the social interpretation of a royal
or ‘lavish’ burial assemblage. This site will be more thoroughly analyzed in Chapter 4.2.
The discovery of the tomb of the Frankish king Childeric I in 1653 in Tournai in
Gaul marks the beginning of Merovingian10 archaeology (Halsall 2010: 169). The tomb
of Childeric, whose identity was determined by the presence of a signet ring with his
name on it, is one of the most lavish assemblages yet recovered from an early medieval
burial (Halsall 2010: 169). The burial is dated to c. 481 C.E. using the contemporaneous
writing of Gregory of Tours and several coins found in the grave minted during the reign
of Zeno (474-491 C.E.) (Halsall 2010: 171; Kazanski and Perin 1988: 13). Despite the
clear chronology and identification, Childeric’s grave does raise other issues. Primarily,
10 The Merovingians were a powerful Frankish dynasty that exercised control over much of modern-day France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, and the Low Countries.



49
the identification of certain objects proves difficult as little is known of their original
location in the grave (Kazanski and Perin 1988: 13) (see Chapter 4.2).
Childeric’s grave is usually seen as a pagan Germanic monument that revived the
custom of the lavishly furnished burial in the ‘Flonheim-Gültlingen Horizon,’ a style
characterized by metalwork decorated in a new polychrome style11 (Halsall 2010: 173).
No earlier royal Frankish burials have been discovered and no later ‘pagan’ or
‘Germanic’ kings have been discovered in similarly furnished graves (Halsall 2010: 173,
4). However, this is most likely due to the relative rarity of royal burials. Yet it remains
questionable whether this burial rite was intrinsically ‘pagan’ or ‘Germanic.’ The sudden
increase of lavishly furnished graves in northern Gaul sometimes associated with
Germanic foederati had begun to be replaced with less ornate graves in the second quarter
of the fifth century while Childeric’s tomb differed significantly from the ‘Flonheim
Gültlingen Horizon.’ The burial at Tournai also differed greatly from the so-called
custom of ‘Reihengräberzivilisation’12 that it had supposedly given rise to by the early
sixth century (Halsall 2010: 175). This, argues Halsall (2010: 175), makes Clovis’
decision to bury his father in this way even more interesting. Much of the work done at
the site has concentrated on what the burial can reveal about Childeric himself, yet it was
not Childeric but his son who created the tomb.
In the end of the fifth century many locally powerful families in northern Gaul
began burying their dead (usually adult males) with increasing numbers of grave goods.
11 The polychrome style is a decorative technique consisting of encrusting gold vessels and ornaments with precious and semi-precious stones and/or glass (Harhoiu 1977: 19). 12 Reihengräberzivilisation is a burial custom where interments in cemeteries occur in relatively neatly arranged rows (Reihengräber – row-graves) and are accompanied by numerous grave-goods, primarily weaponry for males and jewellery for females. This style of burial appeared in northern Gaul in the late fourth century C.E. and persisted until the mid-fifth century. This style of burial was different from the prevalent rite that was characterized by a decreasing number of grave-goods (Halsall 1992: 196).



50
Halsall (2010: 185) argues that the social instability sparked by the end of the Western
Roman Empire ushered in these new burial styles that were employed to demonstrate
power: power not associated with old Rome, but newer Gothic powers on the Danube.
This suggests a connection between the unusually lavish nature of Childeric’s burial and
the political tumult of Clovis’ succession and his right to succeed his father (Halsall 2010:
185). It is possible that the circumstances surrounding Childeric’s burial go back to the
aftermath of Attila’s invasion of Gaul in 451 C.E. and a re-imagining of the nature of
Frankish settlements in Gaul. Clovis’ own disputed succession could have provided the
context for Childeric’s grave (Halsall 2010: 183). It follows that individuals with the most
elaborate ritual deposits were those whose death could cause the most social tension
within a community. Halsall (2010: 175, 205) calls the funeral a “transient ritual display”
or symbolic text that required the ‘audience’ to read and understand the symbolic
message.
Of funerary practices in general, Halsall (2010: 207) argues that there are certain
correlations between the type and number of grave goods, and the age and sex of the
deceased. This “symbolic text” was deliberately chosen to transmit information. It was a
display of the deceased person’s identity that, most importantly, set out how the person
was to be seen: a “ritual scene making” (Halsall 2010: 208; Williams 2005: 210). Burials
with lavish grave goods came into being in this region around 500 C.E. and flourished
between c. 545 and the end of the sixth century C.E., probably beginning with Childeric’s
tomb in Tournai (Halsall 2010: 211). The rituals can be seen as new and “intrusive” rites,
or elaborate variations of the previously existing rites. Old Roman elements were still
recognizable, but the new variations employed themes that proclaimed the power of the
Germanic kingdoms (Halsall 2010: 212). What originally began as a ritual for local elites



51
to display power may have spread to other families with entire communities burying their
dead with grave goods.
3.8 Ethnicity and Migration
Since the nineteenth century, grave sites have been viewed as an important source
of evidence for Europe’s barbarians (Williams 2005: 195). Until the 1960s/1970s
ethnicity was seen as a static identifier that was externally reflected with the help of
“signs” (Theuws and Alkemade 2000: 443). For example, certain forms of weaponry
appearing in Roman contexts have been identified as ‘Germanic’ in origin (Coulston
2013: 477). Theuws and Alkemade (2000: 450) identify three phases in the development
of the weapon burial rite: most of the fourth century; the late fourth century and the first
half of the fifth century; and the second half of the fifth century and the beginning of the
sixth century. The weapons burials of the fourth century have experienced renewed
scholarly interest since their identification as graves of foederati has begun to be
criticized (Theuws and Alkemade 2000: 450).
What differences in funerary practices can and cannot tell modern scholars about
ethnicity and what ethnicity can tell about differences in funerary practices is a complex
starting point for any explanation of Hunnic material culture. It is not possible to
confidently determine if a grave is ‘Hunnic’ and the difficulty of this distinction affects
any study of Hunnic military practices that focuses on the archaeological record. It is
therefore difficult to assess the prevalence of Hunnic archery since a positive
identification of a burial as Hunnic is so problematic. However, such a distinction may
not be essential if, in fact, the strict ethnic division was mostly contrived by the Roman
narrative. This makes the question of the Hunnic impact on the fall of the Western Roman



52
Empire even more complex if the “Hun” distinction is in question. Much of this comes
down to a question of ethnicity and how important ethnic distinctions are when
interpreting the archaeological record, and what impact they made on its formation and on
surrounding historical events.
In his seminal paper “Zur Entstehung der Reihengräberzivilisation,” Joachim
Werner (1950 cited in Halsall 1992: 196) argued that the origins of the Merovingian
burial customs, noted for the number of goods and the presence of weaponry, rest in a
style of burial that appeared in northern Gaul late in the fourth century C.E. These burials
were identified with the Germanic newcomers into the area based on their alleged “un
Roman” appearance and use of material culture (Theuws and Alkemade 2000: 404). The
occurrence of these graves within the borders of the Roman Empire has been linked with
the migration of Germanic ‘barbarian’ tribes from over the Rhine, and the archaeological
evidence has been used to fill in the sequence of events leading up to the fall of the
Western Roman Empire.
An ethnic assumption here is problematic because there exists a chronological
discrepancy between written and archaeological evidence (Halsall 1992: 197). Historical
sources place the first of these settlements around 300 C.E., whereas these ‘early
Germanic’ graves began to appear only in the late fourth century C.E. Halsall (1992: 197)
argues that the lavish nature of many of the graves did not match the low socio-economic
status of the barbarians and that the presence of weaponry in the burials contradicts the
fact that these laeti, like regular Roman troops, did not own their own weapons. The
theory that these were the graves of foederati conforms better to the archaeological
evidence, yet these graves were not found in areas where foederati were definitely settled
(Halsall 1992: 197). A fixation on the ‘Germanic’ characteristics of these burials has



53
caused a separation of the finds from their contexts and a subsequent linking of material
culture to a biologically defined ‘homogeneous’ ethnic community (Theuws and
Alkemade 2000: 405).
This debate illustrates the readiness of some scholars to correlate excavated data
with literary sources and apply one theory to a very complex problem (Theuws and
Alkemade 2000: 407). Halsall (1992: 199) applies Dunning’s 1968 criteria for
determining if a pottery style is imported to the question of whether a burial rite is
intrusive (Appendix A). His application of the first two criteria of this test to the ‘early
Germanic’ graves (whether the rite significantly differs from those of the “host country”)
weakens the interpretation that these burials resulted from barbarian immigration into
northern Gaul (Halsall 1992: 199). The most common finds in these male graves are belt
fittings and buckles that were once thought to be badges of Germanic mercenaries but
later determined to be Roman.
It has been suggested that these graves were Germanic because of the weapons in
them, yet many of these were of Roman manufacture (Halsall 1992: 200). In theory,
Roman citizens were not allowed to own weapons, but practically they were common,
and used especially for hunting. Burial assemblages provide much modern information
about Late Roman weaponry, so making any ethnic determinations from them is risky and
problematic. Distribution of late fourth and early fifth century weapons graves is
widespread and many of these graves do not contain any ‘Germanic’ features (Halsall
1992: 200). A conclusion that can be drawn is that burial with weapons and symbols of
authority (e.g. belts) was becoming more popular along the frontier of Roman Gaul
during this time. A furnished burial was an “active strategy” involved in the creation,



54
maintenance, and negotiation of social reality, rather than simply as a passive reflection
of ‘ethnicity’ (Halsall 2010: 216).
Theuws and Alkemade (2000: 445) argue that there are no regional concentrations
other than those created by archaeologists who bring together certain elements under a
specific (seemingly arbitrary) type. Distribution patterns of different groups are not
mutually exclusive and the mixing of these patterns highlights the fact that there is no
“norm” impacting behaviour in a funerary context (Theuws and Alkemade 2000: 445).
Thus, it is not necessarily possible to conclude that being a member of a specific network
led to a specific burial rite at death. The aforementioned weapons graves are typically
interpreted as those of Germanic chiefs who served in the Roman army. Yet, this does not
explain why only a few individuals are buried this way, nor does it explain the importance
of displaying a Germanic ethnic background after a career in the Roman Army. Whether
the deposition of weaponry relates to ethnicity in a meaningful way or whether grave
goods classified as weapons served only a military purpose is of importance to this study.
The identification of a barbarian warrior based upon a weapons burial depends in many
cases on a strictly functional interpretation of deposited objects as weapons (Theuws
2000: 452).

CHAPTER 4
FUNERARY EVIDENCE
4.1 Introduction
The majority of archaeological sites for nomadic people in Late Antiquity are
burial sites. Genito writes:
The particular socio-economic structure of nomadic societies always allowed such a cultural mixture, wherein the limits of its constituents are very difficult to define archaeologically. For this reason, the material culture of the ancient steppe-peoples represents a particularly difficult ground for debating questions of ethnic affiliation (Genito 2000: 230).
Similar to the fall of the Western Roman Empire, different intellectual traditions place
importance on different influences: Byzantine scholars emphasize East-Mediterranean
cultural contributions while Iranian scholars focus on Middle-Asiatic cultural
characteristics (Genito 2000: 230). This results in nomadic people, like the Huns, either
receiving or losing much of their cultural identity through the interpretive lens of
academic paradigms. For example, there have been numerous ornate bronze cauldrons
(Figure 4) found in association with the Huns. The mere fact of their existence, and the
evidence suggesting that they constructed them, seems to counter Ammianus’ assertion
(31.2.3) that the Huns did not cook their food (King 1987: 80; Maenchen-Helfen 1973:
306). Significantly, the cauldrons and the archaeological evidence of Hunnic artificial
cranial modification (Figure 5) do not factor in all discussions of Hunnic culture (for
more information, see Maenchen-Helfen 1973) (Fóthi 2000: 89).

57
This chapter will discuss the available weaponry through a mortuary analysis of
goods-assemblages from several sites. The burial ritual along with the style and type of
the artefacts contained within each assemblage will provide a reasonable date range for
these sites along with possible interpretations about physical and stylistic origins.
Through historical and archaeological analogy this discussion will link artefact
composition and type to various historical and geographic stages of the Great Migration
and thus to the presence of the Huns in Europe. Key to this discussion is a distinctly
Danubian style that Kazanski and Périn (1988: 24) believe disseminated through the
West. They argue that from the Hunnic-era (the last third of the fourth century to the first
half of the fifth) the aristocracy of different barbarian groups imitated customs of “royal
Danubians” or a mix of “cultural” traits typical of the Huns, Goths, Gepids, and Alano
Sarmatians. The success of this “style,” they argue, explains the power of the so-called
Hunnic “Empire” (Kazanski and Perin 1988: 24). Many of the burials in this study are of
‘elite’ individuals. The examination of these sites will address whether elite culture of the
fifth century shows signs of the importance of mounted archery written about in the texts.
The sites (listed below) were chosen for a number of reasons, one of which was
availability of published material. Only a small number of Hunnic-era grave sites
excavated up until the end of the twentieth century have contained weapons and this has
led to a range of new theories about weapon burial practices. Whether viewing the
deposition of weapons from a functional or symbolic perspective, examining the military
contents of these burials will allow for a re-examination of the “Hunnic” archer image as
it plays out in the archaeological record. This in turn will address the tensions between
Data Set A: The Burial Sites and Data Set B: The Historical Descriptions.



58
What follows is a mortuary analysis of the following sites: Tournai (Belgium, fifth
century C.E.), Pouan (France, fifth century C.E.), Pietroasa (Romania, third to fifth
centuries C.E.), Campochiaro (Italy, sixth to eighth centuries C.E.), and Budapest-Zuglo
(Hungary, fourth and fifth centuries C.E.) (Figure 6).
A valuable site with which to begin this analysis would be Blučina (Czech
Republic, fifth century C.E.). The individual was interred with a golden-hilt spatha, a
seax, a bow, a saddle, and three glass vessels in addition to items of personal jewellery.
Unfortunately, while this site will feature in the conclusion of this study, a thorough
analysis cannot be conducted here because the site material and related texts are written
exclusively in Czech. This language barrier creates, according to some scholars, a distinct
Western European bias in studies of barbarians and the fall of the Western Roman
Empire. This notion will be returned to in detail in the conclusion.

4.2 Tournai (Belgium): The Tomb of Childeric
Gregory of Tours was the only detailed literary source for the reigns of Childeric
and his son Clovis until modern scholars developed new interpretations of the historical
and archaeological data, making it unnecessary to view these reigns solely through
Gregory’s eyes (James 1988: 58). Childeric’s tomb was first discovered in 1653 at
Tournai, Belgium. Most of the ‘valuable’ objects were stolen and melted down for their
precious metals in the nineteenth century; however, descriptions and sketches, along with
recently discovered artefacts from the area, have made it possible to study the site (Geary
1992: 113) (Figures 7-10). Jacques Chifflet wrote Anastasis Childerici Primi (“The
Resurrection of Childeric I”) in 1655 (James 1988: 58). His interpretations depended on
accounts from those who had been present at the time of discovery so it is likely that
some objects described in his monograph were not actually found in Childeric’s grave but
in nearby and perhaps associated graves (James 1988: 61). There was also likely theft of
some of the more valuable objects prior to the arrival of ducal officials. The identification
of many of the associated objects in relation to Childeric is therefore problematic because
of the near total ignorance of their archaeological provenience within the tomb. It is
essential from this point to consider the circumstances that led to the accumulation of
these objects (Geary 1992: 113).
Coins stamped with the images of fifth century emperors and a signet ring
inscribed with “Childerici regis” helped to identify the remains as those of Childeric I,
king of the Franks (457-481/482 C.E.) (Geary 1992: 113). The tomb, incompletely
excavated, revealed three groups of objects that K. Böhner attributes to Childeric himself
(weapons and clothing accessories), his horse (harness, etc.), and to a woman (Böhner in



61
Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14). This categorization is not universally agreed upon;
Kazanski and Périn (1996: 203) argue that more proof is needed.
In 1983 Raymond Brulet conducted subsequent excavations that showed that
Childeric’s grave was not isolated, but was in fact in the midst of, and perhaps formed the
earliest grave in, a Frankish cemetery that was in use until the seventh century (James
1988: 63). Three pits were discovered containing the skeletons of numerous horses 20m
from the site of the main burial. These remains were radiocarbon dated to c. 490 +/-50
years, corroborating the other evidence. James (1988: 63) writes that it is tempting to
connect Childeric to the sacrifice of horses in the form of a Germanic horse burial or
pagan ritual. If the three pits are contemporary, he argues, it throws a different light on
the previously described ‘Roman-like’ burial of the king (James 1988: 64). Geary (1992:
113) argues instead that the mound burial, typical of Alans and Sarmatians from Iran
(more so than western Germanic people), in which Childeric and at least one horse was
buried, was surrounded by at least 30 horses that were killed and interred around his tomb
(Geary 1992: 113).
The objects found within Childeric’s tomb will now be considered in detail. The
clothing accessories as determined by Werner are as follows: a gold kidney-shaped belt
buckle; a pair of gold cloisonné kidney-shaped shoe buckles (according to Böhner one of
these is actually related to a harness, the fluted rim button having been part of a strap
pendant hanging from the handle of the sword); a cruciform gold fibula (or brooch) that
was to close a paludamentum or chlamys13 on the right shoulder; a solid gold signet ring
with a picture of the king and the inscription CHILDERICI REGIS (Childeric the King); a
13 A cloak or cape fastened at one shoulder typically worn by Roman military commanders or high ranking officials.



62
simple gold ring (possibly a wedding band); a solid gold bracelet or arm-ring (weighing
around 300 grams) that was most likely placed permanently on the wrist or arm of the
king because of the small diameter; and a zoomorphic cloisonné gold pouch clasp with
garnets (James 1988: 61; Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14).14
Childeric’s tomb contained nearly 300 gold and silver coins. Most were minted
within the Eastern Roman Empire at Constantinople. Kazanski and Périn (1988: 20)
suggest that because the 100 pieces of gold ranging from Valentinian III (425-455 C.E.)
to Zenon (474-491 C.E.) were contemporary to Childeric, they were likely part of a royal
treasury fueled by subsidies that the Eastern Emperor would have sent to him in exchange
for military aid against the Visigoths.
14 Certain objects here are considered by Werner to be clothing accessories; however, Böhner argues that these were part of the accessories of a royal horse (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14).



63
Figure 7. The Clothing Accessories and Spear Head from the Tomb of Childeric, Tournai, from Kazanski and Perin, 1988.
Weapons interred with Childeric included a cavalry lance and an ax typical of
northern Gaul and particularly of “Frankish” warriors in the mid fifth and sixth centuries
(Geary 1992: 113; Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14). A long sword was present that featured
a gold plated guard and pommel with the grip decorated in gold cloisonné. Surviving
parts of the sheath were also decorated with cloisonné, along with a u-shaped chape and
harness suspension bars (Kasanski and Périn 1988:14). Another sword was discovered
and although the blade has disappeared, most researchers believe that this shorter sword,
or scramasax, was a sharp, single-bladed weapon typical of the tombs of Merovingian
chiefs (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14; Périn and Kazanski 2007: 32). The décor of the
sheath shows that the scramasax was connected to a belt with two straps fixed on the



64
same side of the weapon. This is suggested because the bottom of the chape is decorated
and therefore meant to be viewed and assumes that the weapon was suspended by one
side and carried horizontally and parallel to the belt (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14).
Prototypes have been found in representations appearing on frescoes in fifth century
Central Asia and among the remains of another Hunnic-Era tomb (Novogrigorev’ka in
Ukraine) (Ambroz in Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14). Kazanski and Périn (1988: 17) argue
that Childeric probably wore his scramasax sideways along his body while mounted on
his horse so that the chape remaining was very visible.

65
Figure 9. The Sheath of the Scramasax from the Tomb of Childeric, Tournai, from Kazanski and Perin, 1988.
There is much debate over whether the material in the horse burial is associated
with the tomb of Childeric. Böhner attributed the harness (along with the appliqués,
buckles, and the famous bees15) to Childeric by comparing Tournai to other princely
tombs in Central Europe containing a horse or harness (Böhner in Kazanski and Périn
1988: 17). He argued that like other burials of this nature, the objects had similar
buttonholes affixed onto leather, not fabric, implying that they were attached to the
leather of the harness rather than to Childeric’s clothing (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 14).
His interpretation is strengthened by the 1653 discovery of a horse’s skull and antique
horseshoe; however, their association with Childeric is problematic (Kazanski and Périn
1996: 203). Werner disagrees with the hypothesis of an adjacent horse tomb and with the
allocation of some of the grave components to a harness (Werner in Kazanski and Périn
1988: 17). He suggested that the half-moon appliqué was to close a sleeveless fur jacket
similar to that mentioned by Gallic poet Sidonius in his account of Sigismer’s (a Frankish

prince) entrance into Lyon in 470 C.E. (Werner in Kazanski and Périn 1988: 17). Brulet’s
excavations in the immediate vicinity of Childeric’s tomb in the 1980s add considerably
to the debate. Like many graves of fifth and sixth century Europe (e.g. Eriswell 104,
Lakenheath, Kirton-in-Lindsey 11), the king’s horse was actually buried in an adjacent pit
(or the same pit), explaining the discovery of the skull and harness that had perhaps been
deposited together with other personal items (Fern 2005: 44, 46; Kazanski and Périn
1988: 17). Brulet discovered the skeletons of 21 horses divided among three pits around
Childeric’s grave, although it is not agreed upon whether these pits were dug at the same
time (Effros 2006: 159). Effros (2006: 159) suggests instead that the horse burials
indicate a surplus expended to commemorate the Frankish king, either at the time of his
funeral or by his descendants.



67
Figure 10. Harness Decoration and Accessories Alongside the “Female” Objects in the Tomb of Childeric, Tournai, from Kazanski and Perin, 1988.
James (1988: 61) argues that the material in the assemblage was not out of place
in a wealthy grave in the late fifth century. The gold-and-garnet belt and equipment
fittings, buckles, and gold arm-ring have been found in numerous wealthy Germanic



68
graves of the Roman and early medieval period16 (James 1988: 61). The long and short
swords are similar to others found in Pannonia and the cloisonné bees and other
“zoomorphic motifs” indicate a strong oriental influence, although they were likely
produced in northern Gaul (Geary 1992: 113). The polychrome fashion in gold-and
garnet jewellery was once thought to have come west from the Black Sea with the
migration of Goths, Alans, and Huns. However, in the 1980s archaeologists began
shifting their interpretation to suggest that this style originated in Pannonia, in the heart of
the “Hunnic Empire” in the early part of the fifth century (James 1988: 61). Beginning in
the second half of the fifth century this type of artefact became ubiquitous with
aristocratic style among barbarian peoples that spread, perhaps, due to the close
connections between Germanic leaders within the Roman army (Coulston 2013: 465;
James 1988: 62).
Also at Tournai, in 1653 a small skull cap, a spherical rock crystal pendant (5cm
in diameter, weighing 134 g), and a fragment of a gold needle tip were discovered beside
the skeleton of Childeric (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 18). This led Böhner (in Kazanski
and Périn 1988: 18) to consider the possibility of an adjacent female tomb, similar to
other Germanic double burials of the fifth century. Werner (in Kazanski and Périn 1988:
18) does not support this hypothesis. He argued that the pendant is too large to be
considered one of the characteristically female pendants present in the Merovingian Era
and suggested its inclusion in the funerary category of unknown or “curiosity”. Kazanski
and Périn (1988: 20) argue that it is surprising, if these artefacts signified the presence of

69
a female tomb, that other ‘typically female’ objects,17 were not recovered in 1653 along
with the rest of the funerary remains. An earlier violation of the burial or its partial
searching in the discovery of the tomb is a possible explanation for the lack of material,
although it does not confirm the hypotheses of either Böhner or Werner.
The tomb of Childeric is an exceptional find in Northern Gaul in the fifth century
and beyond; the only parallel is the princely tomb in Pouan, discovered in 1842. In fact,
the tomb of Childeric has been set as the model for a series of rich contemporary, or even
substantially later, warrior tombs in the Flonheim-Gültlingen horizon (Kazanski and Périn
1988: 20). Kazanski and Périn (1988: 19-20) suggest that numerous stylistic influences
reflected by the tomb of Childeric add to the identification of various parts of the funerary
assemblage. These influences (including Frankish, Roman and Byzantine, Germanic, and
Danubian) help contextualize the burial both physical and historically.
Apart from the identification of the burial as that of Frankish king Childeric,
further evidence of a Frankish influence is seen in the armament of the deceased, which
appears similar to that worn by contemporary Frankish warriors of the Somme and the
Rhine who used long swords (or scramasaxes), axes and lances (Kazanski and Périn
1988: 21). Similarly to others in the Flonheim-Gültlingen group, it is the number of
weapons, presence of swords, and the ‘richness of the décor’ that for Kazanski and Périn
(1988: 21) distinguish a ‘chief’ from an ordinary soldier.
Roman and Byzantine influences are also present. The cruciform fibula was a
typically Roman style worn by elevated members of the imperial army and
17 An example of typically female grave goods comes from a rich female burial at Saint Severin in Cologne. Some of these artefacts include a palm-cup, pottery vessel, jewelled buckle, and numerous decorative brooches and other items of jewelry (MacGregor 1997: 76; Martin 2002: 236).

administration.18 Such fibulae served to close the short cloaks, or paludamenta, of the
officers at the right shoulder which Childeric also wore to cover his armour (as depicted
on his signet ring) (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 21). As an ally of Rome, Childeric could
have received this “badge of dignity” from Majorian (457-461 C.E.), Zeno (474-491
C.E.), or Aegidius (James 1988: 66; Werner in Kazanski and Périn 1988: 21). Such
fibulae were also found in other contemporary princely tombs including Apahida I
(Romania) and Blučina (Czech Republic). The wearing of a signet ring is also a Roman
tradition that has been noted in the tombs of barbarian ‘elites.’ One was discovered in the
tomb of Apahida I with the Greek monogram OMAPOC (Omaros) which suggests the
adoption of this custom by barbarian ‘princes’ related to the Roman Empire.
It is interesting to note that unlike Alaric II, king of the Visigoths (458/66-507
C.E.), who is depicted on his signet ring dressed like a Roman (wearing a breastplate but
without weapons), Childeric was represented on his signet ring as combining two
seemingly distinct styles: Roman and Frankish/barbarian. He wore the Roman breastplate
and paludamentum, yet he was depicted in the style of barbarian royalty with long hair
and a lance (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 21). The style in which the sheath of both the
sword and scramasax were decorated could also denote a Byzantine influence (Kazanski
and Périn 1988: 21). According to Arrhenius (in Kazanski and Périn 1988: 21) the
cloisonné technique is evidence of its manufacture in a Byzantine workshop (likely
located in Constantinople) in the fifth and sixth centuries. Many such ‘adornments’ within
this stylistic group that have been dated from the late fourth or early fifth century have
been discovered in Eastern and Central Europe (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 21).
18 According to Geary (1992: 113) the gold cruciform fibula is of Roman origin. Similar pieces have notably been found in Hungary and the former Czechoslovakia.



71
Any theory about potential influence and origin depends on the importance either
of technique or style; scholars often do not agree on which is more important. Arrhenius
(in Kazanski and Périn 1988: 22) suggests that the décor of the sheath of the scramasax in
Childeric’s tomb was produced according to a technique identical to that of the sword and
argues that it was from the same Constantinopolitan workshop and could have formed a
matching set. Nevertheless it should be noted that the transmission of technology and
style is not solely dependent on the physical relocation of all relevant artefacts. It is
possible that a diffusion of objects with a certain style in Western Europe resulted from
Byzantine influence through the Empire’s territory (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 22). In this
case, both the style and technique could have the same origin.
One theory suggests that short or long weapons with single-edged blades were
made in Europe in the fifth century by Huns because the oldest specimens found in
Europe date to the Hunnic-era (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 22). Arrhenius (in Kazanski and
Périn 1988: 22) argued that the scramasax as a weapon in Europe was a Byzantine
invention and that a Byzantine origin for Childeric’s scramasax cannot be excluded. The
use of a scramasax accompanying a sword as a second weapon was widespread in the
fifth century among the Franks and Alemanni and among the barbarian groups living near
the Byzantine border to the west, yet it is rarely seen among other peoples (Kazanski and
Périn 1988: 23). Additionally, they suggest that the shape and angle of the mouth of the
sheath was typical of areas near Constantinople in the fifth century.
Suggesting a possible Germanic influence, Kazanski and Périn (1988: 23) note
that stylistically the tomb of Childeric shares much in common with both Germanic and
Alano-Sarmatian (Iranian) barbarians. Most notable are the funeral details themselves,
adding also the mound and horse burial, along with the potential sacrifice of a herd of



72
horses. Additionally, Werner (in Kazanski and Périn 1988: 23) argued that the gold
bracelet with flared ends was characteristic of those worn by Germanic peoples and
marked the princely rank of their owners. However, it must be noted that similar bracelets
have been documented in the Roman world unconnected to Germanic groups.19 The
diversity of origins speaks to both the bracelet specifically and more generally to other
funerary remains. Here, gold bracelets with flared ends have been shown to reflect the
status of those buried with them; however, they do not provide any indication of ethnicity.
Kazanski and Périn (1988: 25) argue that similar funerary elements between
Childeric’s tomb and those described as typically Germanic suggests that contact between
Gaul and Germanic kingdoms of the Danube continued during the second half of the fifth
century. For example, the grave goods of numerous warrior tombs (Altlussheim, Beja,
Wolsheim, Mundolsheim, etc.) closely parallel the “princely” Danubian style of the
chronological phase of “Untersiebenbrunn,” dating from the late fourth century to the first
half of the fifth century C.E., and demonstrate the Western dissemination of these styles.
Kazanski and Perin (1988: 24) argue that because three of the five aforementioned tombs
are located on the west bank of the Rhine, the new mode first became established in the
small area housing “barbaric” or “barbarized” aristocracy of the Western Roman Army.
One stylistic element that appeared in the West with the wave of Danubian
fashion was the taste for the polychrome gold-work, e.g. stones or coloured glass beads
on a gold backing. In particular, the shape of Childeric’s belt buckle appears to be
stylistically linked to the Danube region. The rectangular or kidney-shaped plates that are
19 Some of the oldest examples of flared bracelets are documented in Afghanistan in a first century royal tomb. In the lower Volga a bracelet of this type was discovered in a mortuary context near Roman bronze vessels dating from the first to third centuries C.E. (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 23). Similar Byzantine bracelets dating to the sixth century C.E. are currently housed at the Archaeological Museum of Istanbul.



73
present in the assemblage appear to fall within the oldest type. The medium and large belt
buckles associated with the same kidney-shape are known also in southern Russia from
the Hunnic “Empire” and appear in Western Europe in the second half of the fifth century
(Kazanski and Périn 1988: 25). Kazanski and Périn (1988: 25) argue that this style went
west through the Middle Danube. This style of belt buckle has also been found in the
tombs of Western barbarian aristocracy during this time, like Pouan, and the weapon sets
with the cloisonné décor parallel those in the Middle Danube (James 1988: 90; Kazanski
and Périn 1988: 25).
Kazanski and Périn (1988: 26) argue that while this particular style was at one
point in time limited to the military aristocracy of the Western Empire, from the age of
Clovis it was widely adopted by non-aristocratic members of the population. It is widely
accepted that the tomb of Childeric is, from both a chronological and stylistic point of
view, the ‘hinge’ between two periods (Kazanski and Périn 1988: 26). It is therefore
possible that those who interred Childeric (likely his son) were largely responsible for the
continued diffusion of the Danubian mode from the Franks.
4.3 Pouan (France): The “Treasure of Pouan”
On August 22, 1842 a labourer named Jean-Baptiste Buttat found a rich burial that
is now referred to as the “Treasure of Pouan” (Bienaimé 1993: 3). Situated in the Aube
Valley, Pouan lies about 30km north of Troyes (site of the Battle of the Catalaunian
Plains in 451 C.E.). The burial area is composed of pebbles and alluvial soil covered with
approximately 40cm of topsoil and if Buttat, the sole witness to the discovery, is to be
believed, the body was interred at a depth of 80cm to a meter (Bienaimé 1993: 3). Having



74
obtained secondary information, the contemporary archaeologist A. Peigné-Delacourt
reported that the body had most likely been placed on its back (Bienaimé 1993: 3).
Accompanying the skeleton were two rusty iron blades and various gold objects
(Figure 11). After recovering what he could, Buttat offered the pieces to the Museum of
Troyes. Due to limited resources the museum could only purchase the sword and the
scramasax (Bienaimé 1993: 4). Other precious objects were purchased by Mr. Gauthier, a
jeweler in Troyes, remaining in his family until 1853 when they were shown at the
Archaeological Congress in Troyes (June 9, 1853) (Bienaimé 1993: 4). They were
eventually purchased for the Museum of Troyes by Napoleon III (1852-1870). The
“Treasure of Pouan” became the centrepiece of the archaeological collection at the
museum.

75
No records were taken during the excavation of the Treasure of Pouan so a great
many details about the site and the relative position of the artefacts remain unknown
(Bienaimé 1993: 5). Recovery attempts have been made to spatially locate the sword and
scramasax using parts from the sheaths and handles of these weapons with varying
results. The most recent is contained is the technical report of A. Thouvenin of the
Laboratoire d’Archéologique des Métaux de Nancy, and it is through his analysis that the
following descriptions are based.
The contents of the tomb were as follows: a sword and scabbard; a scramasax and
scabbard; a pair of cloisonné belt buckles; a selection of solid gold jewellery; and various
undetermined/unidentified items. Bienaimé (1993: 7) separates these artefacts into two
categories: solid gold jewellery, and weapons and objects in gold work cloisonné. For a
more detailed physical description of some of the following artefacts, see Appendix C.
Several pieces of solid gold jewellery were unearthed at Pouan. The two belt
buckles are included in this category because their use is not strictly military. They are
decorated in gold cloisonné with four large garnets and embossed gold paillon.20 A gold
“wreath,” an undecorated open bracelet with flared ends (141g), two loops with a straight
pin (weighing 118g and 29g respectively), and a large ring with the fine inscription
“HEVA” (40g) were also found (Bienaimé 1993: 9,11).
The blade of the sword (remaining 873mm) is thin and double-edged, made of
three bands welded together. Bienaimé argues that these characteristics are reminiscent of
work of the haute époque, i.e. the fifth century C.E., which suggests to him that it is an
isolated piece. The pommel is an elongated iron plate whose upper surface is inlaid with
20 Paillon is a thin leaf of metal (silver or gold) used especially in enameling and gilding.



76
four garnets: two circular and two ogival, crimped on embossed gold and set with garnets.
The grip of the sword, covered with a gold foil, is rolled and welded as a pipe with five
raised ridges that run transversely to its long axis. The blade of the scramasax is long and
narrow (with dimensions of 602mm and max. 30mm). The handle is made of rolled and
welded gold leaf adorned with ridges/rings along the entire length. (For a more detailed
description of both weapons, refer to Appendix C).
The tomb of Pouan was once thought to contain the earliest examples of its kind
and style in the West. Some earlier scholars (e.g. Peigné-Delacourt in 1866) have even
suggested that the princely tomb was that of Theodoric I (418-451 C.E.), king of the
Visigoths, who died in battle against Attila at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fields in 451
C.E. (Bienaimé 1993: 7; James 1988: 62). In their 1956 publication, Salin and France
Lanord (1956: 73) argue that the assemblage undoubtedly belongs to the fifth century.
They write: “It is certainly much earlier than the famous assemblage of Tournai
(Childeric I buried in 482) and Apahida (second half of the fifth century), which are more
sophisticated” (Salin and France-Lanord 1956: 74). They argue that the weapons relate to
the haute époque type typical of southern Russia (early fifth century to the end of 500)
(Salin and France Lanord 1956: 68, 75). They write that these ornaments are similar to
those that the Huns and Goths made; the Hunnic ornaments, however, have a more
“oriental” character (Salin and France Lanord 1956: 75).
Despite scholarly speculation, the identity of the individual interred in Pouan will
likely remain unknown, although the HEVA inscription on the ring might suggest Gothic
origins (Bienaimé 1993: 11). Regardless of the individual identity, most scholars argue
that the tomb belonged to a prince or king, someone of elite status and wealth. Salin and
France-Lanord (1956: 75) write: “We can finally say that it is a set worn by a barbarian



77
king, most likely Goth, buried around the year 450 C.E. It is indeed a king, because at that
time, such wealth requires a royal quality.”
The weapons and ornaments of the tomb of Pouan are representative of a period
when gold and garnets in particular played a predominant stylistic role. Men of high
status, according to Bienaimé (1993: 12), were fascinated by the rich contrast of red and
gold; a style of art typical of the Black Sea region and the Hunnic period. Bienaimé
(1993: 12) argued that undoubtedly some Germanic peoples established themselves along
the Black Sea where they were able then to transmit the goldsmith techniques that later
came to be used in Western Europe. The question of whether the artefacts at Pouan were
imported or of local Pontic tradition must be considered. Considering the prominent
Danubian influence seen in many princely tombs of this time, it is likely that either the
style or the objects themselves came from the east. The assemblage appears stylistically
uniform with the exception of the sheath of the sword. Whether it was Theodoric or
another Gothic prince, military encounters around Troyes, Chalons-sur-Marne, and Pouan
were numerous in the fifth century (Bienaimé 1993: 12).
The burial at Pouan was not part of a larger necropolis, and seems to have been a
lone burial. However, within a few meters of the site, unusual finds have multiplied in the
years since Buttat’s initial discovery. In 1842 a bronze basin with decorated handles of
the Gallo-Roman period was discovered. A burial with warrior equipment was also
discovered along with a bronze sword from the Late Bronze Age II (Bienaimé 1993: 12).
Bienaimé (1993: 12) argues it is unlikely that these discoveries, all from different periods
and all similarly ornate, are ‘coincidences.’



78
4.4 Pietroasa (Romania): The Pietroasa Treasure
The Pietroasa Treasure was discovered in Pietroasa, Buzău, Romania in 1837 by
two workers cutting limestone in a quarry (Cojocaru et al 1999: 1). Of the 22 original
pieces, only 12 have survived and are currently conserved at the National Museum of
Romanian History in Bucharest (Harhoiu 1977: 1) (Figure 12). Alexandru Odobescu, a
pioneer of Roman archaeology in the late nineteenth century, described the assemblage in
his work entitled Le Trésor de Petrossa (Paris, 1889-1900). In his work Odobescu
reached several conclusions about the treasure. He believed that the pieces in the
assemblage belonged to a pagan Germanic people, likely the Goths, who inhabited Dacia
from the third to fifth centuries C.E. While acknowledging that not all pieces dated from
the same period he argued that they were all representative of an ‘indigenous’ art of these
Dacian Goths. Odobescu also believed that the entire assemblage was associated with a
pagan temple because it contained almost exclusively “sacred vases and sacerdotal
ornaments” (Harhoiu 1977: 3). He suggested further that the collection of artefacts
belonged to Athanaric, king of the Visigoths, and was buried before his departure to
Constantinople where he died in 381 C.E. (Harhoiu 1977: 3). This identification has been
held by numerous later scholars (e.g. Diculescu 1923), while some have based less
specific chronological and ethnic hypotheses on Odobescu’s assumptions (see below).



79
Figure 12. The Contents of the Grave at Pietroasa, from Romania-insider.com
Despite numerous archaeologists, linguists, and art historians continually
contributing to the scholarship of the Pietroasa site, Odobescu’s work remains an
important reference. Many later assumptions were based largely on written records from
the last years of Athanaric’s life and lacked attention to archaeological data, which today
has provided more conclusive chronological evidence (Harhoiu 1977: 3). The dating of
the Pietroasa treasure continues to be an ongoing debate. Numerous Romanian specialists
(Dunăreanu-Vulpe 1956, 1958, 1967; Nestor 1960; Theodorescu 1967; Werner 1956
discussed in Harhoiu 1977: 3) attribute the assemblage to the fourth century Visigoths. J.
Werner (1956 in Harhoiu 1977: 4) assigned the treasure to the fourth century before the



80
Hunnic invasion; however, his interpretation is not based solely on archaeological
analysis. Harhoiu (1977: 4) argues that while analogous burial assemblages containing
gold ingots (Crasna, Feldioara) or silver ornaments (Valea Strîmbă) dating to
approximately 380 C.E. have been suggested in support of the “Athanaric Hypothesis,”
the presence of silver ornaments at Valea Strîmbă have no stylistic link to the Pietroasa
treasure and therefore cannot explain the burial of both assemblages as a consequence of
the same event: the Hunnic invasion. N. Fettich (1932 in Harhoiu 1977: 4) argued that the
collections of ingots from both Crasna and Feldioara represented the first instances of the
accumulation of gold by Germanic groups north of the Danube and that this was a direct
result of the socio-political situation arising in the Balkan Peninsula after the Battle of
Adrianople (378 C.E.). The fact that this gold was not fashioned into ornaments suggests
to some that the burial of these assemblages was a consequence of the Hunnic invasion,
although equally valid hypotheses for a later burial have been suggested (Harhoiu 1977:
4). Harhoiu (1977: 4) does not believe that the date of the aforementioned burials can be
connected with the chronology of the Pietroasa assemblage because it appears to reflect a
different period stylistically.
Numerous scholars (e.g. Hubert, Pocher, and Volbach 1967; Theodorescu 1976; in
Harhoiu 1977: 4) have made additional arguments for dating Pietroasa to the fourth
century; however, many of these claims are largely unsubstantiated. Arrhenius (1971 in
Harhoiu 1977: 5) produced the most substantive argument for a fourth century date:
garnets cut into the shape of steps and a crystalline backing for the stones were typical of
mid-fifth century, neither of which are present in the treasure of Pietroasa. Conversely,
Harhoiu (1977: 5) maintains that these styles were not typical only of the first half of the
fifth century.



81
Other hypotheses date the assemblage to after the departure of Athanaric to
Constantinople, firmly dated to 381 C.E. Beleaev (1929 in Harhoiu 1977: 5) analyzed
literary sources about the different types of fibulae used at Late Roman and Byzantine
courts to date a small brooch from Pietroasa to the fifth century and suggests possible
circulation into the sixth century. While assigning this brooch to beyond the first half of
the fifth century is implausible, brooches of similar design to Pietroasa did not appear
before the 360s – 370s and have often been assigned to the 370s – 390s (Harhoiu 1977:
5). Some scholars (Böhner 1948; Holmquist 1955; Horedt 1969 in Harhoiu 1977: 6) dated
the assemblage at Pietroasa to the fifth century on the basis of the polychrome style of its
various pieces. Horedt (1969 in Harhoiu 1977: 6) even suggested that the treasure
belonged to the Ostrogoths and that its burial was connected with events taking place
around 450 C.E. that finally led to the collapse of the “Hunnic Empire.”
The ceremonial elements of the assemblage (according to Harhoiu 1977: 7) can be
divided into: pieces worked only in gold and those decorated in polychrome style. The
items can be further separated into artefacts worn on the body and those with other
purposes. The latter will now be described. (For a more detailed description of these
artefacts, refer to Appendix D). The first is a plate with a broad everted rim and foot-ring.
It is decorated using the au repoussé technique.21 Harhoiu (1977: 7) compares this plate
with a gold plaque found in the tumulus at Certomlîk and with sarcophagi of the Late
Roman Period (third to sixth centuries C.E.). He notes that the decoration does not help
date the piece more exactly as the rosette was an ordinary decorative pattern (Harhoiu
1977: 7). He does argue, however, that some of the detailing could be a chronological
21 A metalworking technique in which a malleable metal is ornamented by hammering and lightly chasing from the reverse side to create a design in low relief.



82
indication of the Migration Period because North-Pontic workshops, to which this piece
has been tentatively assigned, have been known to use similar decorative patterns
(Harhoiu 1977: 7).
The second piece at Pietroasa is a tall ovoid oenochoe (jug) measuring 36cm.
(Harhoiu 1977: 8). The various decorative elements on the vessel (featuring the opus
interrasile22 and au repoussé techniques) represent stylized birds, bird-heads, and
acanthus-leaves and are arranged in zones (Harhoiu 1977: 8). Harhoiu (1977: 8) compares
the oenochoe to a silver jug found at Kerch in the Crimea dated to the time of Emperor
Constantius II (337-361 C.E.). Because the stylized acanthus-leaves separated by
triangles is a style rarely used by Late Roman workshops, some scholars argue for
workshops of “barbaricum” as a potential origin place. Harhoiu (1977: 8) argues instead
that due to similarities with the jug from Kerch, North-Pontic workshops that worked for
the “barbarian” population are a more plausible origin site. Additional analogies between
the Pietroasa jug and pendants from Coşovenii de Jos with the same stylized acanthus
flowers in the same technique suggest a date around 400 C.E. However, based on the
presence of pottery vessels (which would be clay copies of the jug from Pietroasa) within
the Sîntana de Mureş-Cerneahov culture,23 Harhoiu (1977: 9) argues that the Pietroasa jug
dates from earlier in the fourth century C.E.
The third item, a patera,24 is the sole piece that shows very little sign of damage
(Harhoiu 1977: 9). The decorative elements, mostly in the au repoussé style, include rows
22 Pierced open metalworking technique found from the third century C.E., involving punching holes in metal to simulate lattice patterns, openwork gold jewellery, etc. 23 An archaeological culture flourishing between the second and fifth centuries C.E. in a wide area of Eastern Europe, specifically in modern Ukraine, Romania, Moldova, and parts of Belarus. Suggested origins of this ‘culture’ type are a mix of Gothic, Geto-Dacian, Sarmatian, and Slavic. 24 A broad shallow Roman dish typically used to pour libations.



83
of human figures. Some scholars argue that the patera is associated with the late
Sarmatians from Southern Russia and that the seated figure is closely connected with the
Great Goddess of the Scythian tradition (Harhoiu 1977: 10). Odobescu (in Harhoiu 1977:
10) suggested initially that the figures represent a “syncretism between deities proper to
the German population, and those of the classical Graeco-Roman world.” There are
elements of the Gandhara style25 as well as Sassanian, Parthian, and Hellenistic influences
in the clothing and body proportions (Harhoiu 1977: 10). Harhoiu (1977: 10) argues that
similarities between the patera and Parthian art suggest a Syrian origin (Antioch more
specifically) with a date of around 360 C.E. There is no evidence suggesting how the
patera arrived at Pietroasa; however, Harhoiu (1977: 11) suggests, with no supporting
evidence, that when the Hunnic expedition of 395 C.E. reached Antioch, the patera was
taken into the possession of the Huns or an allied people and arrived in the Carpathian
region (along with numerous other items).
The fourth and fifth items are two multi-angular cups: an octagonal cup measuring
10.5cm in height, and a twelve-sided cup 11cm high. Both cups feature similar design
elements: handles in the shape of panthers consisting of rosettes set with garnets (Harhoiu
1977: 11). Harhoiu (1977: 11) suggests possible analogies between these vessels and
some types of metal vessels from the Roman period, although panthers were well-known
in Roman art. More precise dating may come from the polychrome style in which the
cups are worked (Harhoiu 1977: 12). K. Horedt (1969 in Harhoiu 1977: 12) argued that
25 From the ancient kingdom of Gandhara, a style of Buddhist art that developed from a combination of Greek, Syrian, Persian, and Indian artistic influence. The development began in the Parthian Period (50 B.C.E. – 75 C.E.).



84
this design practice was typical of the Hunnic period as Late Antique metal vessels have
been known to occur in princely tombs in the fifth century C.E.
The personal ornaments in the Pietroasa treasure included a plain gold collar with
a loop and hook for fastening. Harhoiu (1977: 12) argues that this type of ornament is
typical of male graves from the period of Attila and reflects a widespread style stretching
from Western Siberia to Central Europe. Bronze and silver collars sporadically occur in
the fourth century; however, the gold examples have only been known to occur in the
fifth century (Harhoiu 1977: 12). A similar collar has been described from the assemblage
at Pouan (see Chapter 4.3). The second collar, with an inscription, also has a loop and
hook for fastening. The inscription, in German runes, has various interpretations.26
Harhoiu (1977: 13) argues that this piece reflects social position and the inscription
(which he suggests was likely engraved in a later period) attests that the item belonged to
a Gothic group. Artefacts of this type have been dated from the second half of the fourth
century or beginning of the fifth century C.E. and have been confined by class (namely
the members of the imperial guard). Primary literature also refers to similar objects.
Zosimus describes the murder of a group of barbarians (likely Goths) in the Dobrudja in
388 C.E. Gerontius, the perpetrator of the massacre, captured gifts “which consisted of
gold collars given by the emperor to them for their adornment” (Zosimus 4. 40.20). The
final collar is composed of two unequal parts joined with hinges (Harhoiu 1977: 14). The
collar, embedded with garnets, features designs of hearts and flowers. This style of
26 There are three recognized interpretations of the runes. The first, by Neumeister, reads: qutaniowi hailag and has three translations: 1) To Wodan, sacred; 2) To the good country of the Scythians, sacred; 3) To the good fatherland, sacred. The second interpretation, by M. Isbăşescu, reads: qutani o wi hailag or qutanio wi hailag and is translated as: “hereditary sacrosanct master (or protector) of the Gothi.” The third, by R. Loewe, reads: qutan Iowi hailag, and is translated as “to Jupiter of the Gothi, devoted.”



85
ornament is known both in Scandinavia and Germany in the Bronze Age and in Scythian
art from the first millennium B.C.E. Harhoiu (1977: 14) argues that the polychrome style
of the collar indicates a date during the first half of the fifth century.
The final group of artefacts was three fibulae: small (12.5cm high), middle sized
(25cm high), and large (27cm high, 15cm wide). The small and medium-sized fibulae
each have a foot shaped like a stylized bird. The catch system is identical to the
“crossbow” fibulae from the late Roman and Roman-Byzantine period (Harhoiu 1977:
14). Harhoiu (1977: 15) argues that this fibula along with its middle-sized counterpart is a
combination of two types of fibulae with part of the design (the oval centre and catching
system) deriving from late Roman oval fibulae and other elements (namely the stylized
bird-head) carrying ‘Oriental’ influences. According to D. Brown (1972 in Harhoiu 1977:
18) the middle-sized fibula was worn on the breast and potentially worn in women’s
dress.
The body of the large fibula is similar to that of a bird and is made of a thick gold
plate that Harhoiu (1977: 17) argues is bent to permit the ornament to be worn on the
shoulder. This fibula has similar design elements to its counterparts; however, unlike the
small and middle-sized fibulae Harhoiu (1977: 17) argues that this piece is without
parallels. He argued, in fact, that it served as a prototype for the eagle-shaped fibulae
from Ostrogothic Italy or Visigothic Spain (Harhoiu 1977: 17).
The dates for the small and middle-sized fibulae are likely similar (around the
fifth century). Harhoiu (1977: 16) notes the significance of the eagle design, present on all
three fibulae and the oenochoe jug, which occurs on other objects dating to the fifth and
sixth centuries. Harhoiu (1977: 17) argues that this animal motif was adopted by the Huns
through contact with the Chinese civilization, cultures of the Altai population, and



86
influence of the Sarmatian culture.27 He further suggests that the Gothic adoption of this
pattern occurred only after they were included in the Hunnic confederation (Harhoiu
1977: 17). Arguing, as Harhoiu (1977: 17) does, that these objects reflected social status
within Hunnic society, similar eagle representations also appear on less ornate pieces, in
the Sîntana de Mureş-Cerneahov tradition and in Roman contexts for example.
Examining the polychrome style of numerous objects found in Romania, Harhoiu
(1977: 20) separates the types into four groups. The first contains pieces decorated
exclusively with cabochon work and features ornaments associated with the Huns, dating
from the end of the fourth century to the beginning of the fifth century C.E. The second
can be described as objects worked in cloisonné technique that belong to the same period
including a type of shoe-buckles typical of the period of Attila (Harhoiu 1977: 20). The
third are objects found in graves, princely tombs, or hoards. The fourth and final category
is represented by the Pietroasa treasure: princely graves from Apahida and the Someşeni
hoard (Harhoiu 1977: 21).
The Pietroasa treasure can be typologically linked with both the Sîntana de Mureş
Cerneahov culture of the fourth century and the Unterseibenbrunn-Coşovenii de Jos
culture28 of the first half of the fifth century (Harhoiu 1977: 23). The graves of the
Sîntana de Mureş-Cerneahov culture contain relatively rich grave-goods consisting of
silver or bronze fibulae, combs, plain buckles, and pottery. Generally swords and gold
objects are lacking, with polychrome objects not occurring in larger cemeteries
27 For a detailed explanation of the theories linking the European Huns with the Asian Hsiung-nu, see Wright (1997) and de la Vaissière (2005). 28 This style of stamped ornamentation, popular across Europe during the early Migration Period, takes its name from a group of elite burials from Untersiebenbrunn in Lower Austria and Coşovenii de Jos, in Romania.



87
suggesting that they indicated a higher social position. Some of the decorative elements
are likely Roman in origin and continued to be used beyond the Sîntana de Mureş
Cerneahov culture (Harhoiu 1977: 24). Harhoiu (1977: 24) argues that the most
‘advanced’ elements of this culture travelled south to the regions north of the Black Sea.
Thus, when this region was conquered by the Huns the style became synthesized with
Sarmatian and Bosporan elements. This was accompanied by social changes leading
perhaps to the princely graves and hoards from the end of the fourth century and
beginning of the fifth century C.E.
One of the characteristic elements of the Unterseibenbrunn-Coşovenii de Jos
culture is different categories of metal antiquities (mostly silver) including pieces of
harness, bridles, harness-rings, pendants, and belt-fittings with engraved decoration
(Harhoiu 1977: 25). These elements occur in hoards and princely tombs found over a
large geographic area from Sweden to the Lower Danube and Western Europe. A certain
phase of the development of the polychrome style was contemporary with the
Unterseibenbrunn-Coşovenii de Jos culture including elements of the Pietroasa treasure.
Geographically, the cloisonné present on the small and middle-sized fibulae has been
stylistically linked to other finds from Central and Western Europe (Komárom, Hungary;
Blučina, Czech Republic). The decorative technique also appears on certain sword
sheaths from the second half of the fifth century C.E., and a variant of the cloisonné style
(present on the collar with hinge) appears on several pieces typical of the Hunnic period
(Harhoiu 1977: 28). This technique is also present on the hilt of the scramasax of Pouan.
Harhoiu (1977: 34-35) argues that the treasure at Pietroasa and the design
elements that it represents can be linked to various historical and political processes of the
late Roman Empire. He links the movement of style with the movement and dominance



88
of the Hunnic confederacy as the process of permanent infiltration of new peoples from
the East began. The similarities in fashion and the adoption of some Roman cultural
objects reflect contact between the two social structures. Harhoiu (1977: 36) argues, in
fact, that the burial of the Pietroasa Treasure is an “archaeological reflection of the
historical events connected with the disappearance of the Hunnic state.”
4.5 Budapest-Zugló (Hungary): A Horse Burial
The site of Budapest-Zugló was first discovered in December of 1961 when
construction workers accidentally came across the remains along the right bank of the
Rákos Creek in Budapest, situated in the former Roman Province of Valeria. The grave
was dug on the island-like sand ridge surrounded by water and researchers argue that it is
without a doubt a solitary burial (Nagy 2010: 146). Nothing is known about the original
topography of the area and it is not clear whether there was a mound present over the
burial. The burial contained a 20-25 year old male, numerous grave goods (Figure 13),
and the severed head of a horse (placed close to this individual’s feet, upside down with a
west-east orientation) along with three vertebrae at unknown depth (Nagy 2010:
140,147). The skeleton was found at a depth of 112.22cm and only the leg bones and the
feet (likely discarded by the construction workers) were missing.
Accompanying the set of human remains were six items. Others were later
discovered and recorded during the subsequent excavation and documented by Tibor
Nagy in the archaeological report the following year (Nagy 2010: 139). The position of
the grave goods relative to the body was determined through the examination of the grave
drawings and photographs. Unfortunately, three artefacts that appear on the grave
drawing are not mentioned in the report and have not been located within the museum: a



89
vessel fragment found behind the skull; a 12cm-long single-edged knife; and a disc
shaped ‘button’ found next to the lower ribs on the right side of the skeleton (Nagy 2010:
141).
Figure 13. The Contents of the Grave at Budapest-Zuglo, from Nagy, 2010.



90
The original numbering indicates that the burial contained 13 grave goods: (1) an
iron bit; (2) an iron bar covered with gold foil; (3) a diamond-shaped bronze pendant; (4
5) two gold mounts found by the construction workers; (6) a bronze bell; (7) an iron
buckle; (8) a small iron buckle; (9-13) five gold mounts found during the excavation
(Nagy 2010: 142). An iron bell (14) was later re-discovered by Nagy and confirmed as
part of the Zugló assemblage. From the information contained in the excavation report,
the grave goods present at Budapest-Zugló can be divided into two groups: artefacts
placed by the human skeleton, and artefacts associated with the horse bones. The first
artefact associated with the human remains was an iron buckle, found by the pelvis of the
individual. No direct analogies have been found for this buckle, although this piece seems
to be an example of a common Late Roman and early Medieval type of buckle known as
a “B-shaped buckle with incurving centre” (Nagy 2010: 166). Several similar buckles cast
in bronze, however, have been found both inside and outside the empire. Although this
type of buckle does not appear to have been common in Eastern Europe during the
Hunnic-era, similar pieces are known from fifth century assemblages in the Carpathian
Basin29 (Nagy 2010: 167).
Another, smaller, oval iron buckle was found on the inner side of the left thigh of
the individual. The function of this buckle is not clear (Nagy (2010: 165) suggests that it
could have been associated with footwear); however, a similar buckle (with a seemingly
different function) was found on the waist of a skeleton in the Hunnic-era cemetery in
Nagydém-Középrépáspuszta (Nagy 2010: 165). Nagy (2010: 167) argues that the
technique of setting stones and enamel into a recessed surface (like the Zugló buckles)
29 Assemblages at Palkonya-Hőerőmű or Csongrad-Kenderföldek. See Csallány (1959) and Mihály Párducz (1959).



91
was most likely adapted from Late Roman jewellery. These ornate buckles with cloisonné
inlay most often appear in male burials with accompanying weapons and were likely
manufactured in Mediterranean workshops (Nagy 2010: 169). J. Werner (1966 in Nagy
2010: 169) argues that this type of buckle was modelled on Hunnic-era pieces from the
Danube region.
Six garnet-encrusted gold mounts with perforated corners were found between the
legs of the individual, all arranged in a row down to the knees (Nagy 2010: 170). The
position of the mounts suggests that they formed part of a decorative trim on a caftan-like
dress that hung from the waist down (Nagy 2010: 170). Three of the smaller mounts were
found face-down which according to Nagy (2010: 170), suggests that they were part of a
leather strap held together by the iron buckle. They may have decorated the shoe straps or
represented part of an additional belt also placed into the grave.
The ornate nature of these mounts is reminiscent of the ornamental pattern of
Hunnic-era diadems of Kovrig’s Class 230 which have been discovered between
Kazakhstan and southern Poland. Nagy (2010: 171) suggests that these mounts had been
parts of other pieces and had been ‘recycled’ or ‘repurposed’ in their current form. This,
she suggests, is evident by the perforations in the corners of the pieces, and was a custom
not unusual during the Hunnic-era. It is not known whether the Zugló mounts originally
belonged to one or several pieces of jewellery, nor is it clear what the function of the
original piece was (Nagy 2010: 172). Nagy (2010: 174) suggests that the mounts had
originally belonged to at least three pieces made in different styles. It is likely that at least
30 A type classified by I. Kovrig (“Das Diadem von Csorna” 1985).



92
one piece was originally from a diadem while the others could have come from the
decorative elements of a scabbard, a buckle, or a fibula (Nagy 2010: 174).
There were also several artefacts found in association with the horse remains.
According to the construction workers each of the following items were located between
the head of the horse and the right foot of the human burial (Nagy 2010: 150). An iron bit
was present that was folded in two before its deposition, causing it to oxidize in that
position. Traces of ribs on the inner side of the side bars suggest that they were originally
covered with gold foil (Nagy 2010: 154). The only known analogy for this bit from the
same period is a poorly preserved artefact found in the Giliach cemetery in northern
Caucasus. At this site, the bit and associated harness mounts were placed by the feet of
the individual (male) with an artificially deformed skull. He had also been buried with his
sword and spear. This leads Nagy (2010: 155) to suggest that bits with straight side-bars,
like the Zugló bit, may have been more common in the Danube region in the mid-fifth
century C.E.
A fragment of a ribbed iron bar with a round section covered in gold foil (along a
1.5cm section) was found and suggested to be part of a side-bar from another bit. I.
Zasetskaia (1994 in Nagy 2010: 155) traces the tradition of ringed side-bars to the La
Tène period (c. 501 B.C.E. to 1 B.C.E). Bits with ringed side-bars were often interred in
second- or third- century Alannic military burials on the River Kuban (Nagy 2010: 155).
A diamond-shaped bronze pendant covered with gold foil was also found. This,
argues Nagy (2010: 156), is a harness ornament that is most typical of the Hunnic period.
The ornamental pattern of the pendant is formed of two circles and a loop-like line in the
so-called ‘omega motif.’ It is likely that the motif originated in the region between the
Caspian and Black Seas and was first used for the decoration of harness sets. This pattern



93
is also common among other artefacts from steppe assemblages and has been interpreted
as a zoomorphic design, namely as a symbolic depiction of ram heads (Nagy 2010: 157).
The two circles present on the Zugló harness pendant appear to represent the shape of a
cicada with the two circles potentially forming the eyes (Nagy 2010: 158). This
representation is unusual but not unique in this era; it also appears on Hunnic-era dress
accessories in polychrome style (Nagy 2010: 158). Bóna (1991 in Nagy 2010: 159)
suggests that the cicada motif was a revered ancestral symbol that was first brought to
Europe by the Huns. The best analogies for this motif are the garnet-inlaid gold mounts
from the tomb of Childeric.
Finally, two bells, one iron and one bronze, were found placed across the horse
remains (Nagy 2010: 147). These bells were both constructed from metal sheet and were
thus different from the popular cast bronze bells found within the Roman province of
Pannonia and throughout barbaricum (Nagy 2010: 161). Bells were often hung from the
necks of grazing animals (horse, cattle, sheep, or pigs) and likely served a dual purpose:
to signal the location of the animals and to ward off thieves (Nagy 2010: 151). The large
number of Late Roman iron bells in the archaeological record suggests that bell-making
had already been a long tradition in the empire (Nagy 2010: 164). Similarities between
these bells and those found at Zugló suggests that during this time, Roman-manufactured
goods were available (likely through trade) beyond the limits of the empire.
Horse bells buried in association with horse bones and harness sets are
exceptionally rare in Merovingian Europe and there is little evidence for the deposition of
iron bells in Late Roman burials in Pannonia. The practice is mostly known to have
Central Asian origins, although they were known to the Romans. However, in the Great
Hungarian Plain small bronze bells have been found in female and child burials of the



94
Sarmatian age (Nagy 2010: 152). The Zugló burial is the earliest Migration-period
example of a horse buried with a bell. Bóna (1991 in Nagy 2010: 154) argues that the
Zugló burial can be viewed as part of the tradition of partial horse burials of the Hunnic
era that was typified by the placement of a horse head either above the head or by the feet
of an individual. The practice of burying a horse skull with or without severed legs,
usually wrapped in hide, serves as a substitute for the entire animal (Nagy 2010: 147).
This has traditionally been an Eastern European practice that is well documented in
Sarmatian and Hunnic-era assemblages, typically in male burials (Nagy 2010: 147). The
upside-down position of the skull is another characteristic feature of horse burials at this
time; however, none of the currently known burials in the eastern Hun territories
contained solely a skull.
It is interesting to consider that although the individual may have had military
involvement, he was not buried with any weapons. P. Tomka (2001 in Nagy 2010: 154)
suggests that no weapons were deposited in the grave in the first place because during the
Hunnic-era weapons and harness sets were buried in separate pits adjacent to the main
graves.
The Province of Valeria, created by Emperor Galerius (293 – 311 C.E.), lies along
the Danube in the eastern part of Pannonia. This area was perpetually under barbarian
attack from various groups including the Vandals, Quadi, Goths, and later Attila and his
Huns. Valeria was later abandoned by the western Romans in the 430s C.E. and given to
the Huns by Aetius as payment for military support (see Chapter 2.1) (Nagy 2010: 137).
The area remained in the hands of the Huns until the collapse of the “Hunnic Empire”
following the battle of Nedao (454 C.E.). The archaeological evidence indicates a sharp
population decline in the capital (Aquincum) in the early fifth century; however, small



95
groups of graves have been found adjacent to old military and civilian cemeteries (Nagy
2010: 137). Certain finds also indicate the presence of high-status burials in the area.
Settlements along the left bank of the Danube, never under direct imperial
administration, were abandoned by their barbarian chieftains before the first Hunnic raids.
Interestingly, the geographical distribution of finds seems to demonstrate continuous
occupation of the settlements and surrounding areas (Nagy 2010: 138). It is here that
Zugló becomes very important. The burial rite, grave goods, and human bones indicate
that the assemblage could be directly linked to the Hunnic conquest. In fact, Nagy (2010:
138) describes the burial as that of a “young Hun buried with the head of his horse and its
accompanying harness.” The identification of the individual as a Hun, however, is not as
simple when the complicated nature of ethnicity during the Late Empire is factored in.
Lines between Romans and barbarians have been blurred through time in the
archaeological record, not to mention any perceivable distinction between different
barbarian groups.
The sites at Tournai, Pouan, Pietroasa, and Budapest-Zugló are all individual
princely tombs that demonstrate significant stylistic links to each other and to their
numerous Danubian-styled contemporaries. The examination of these burials within the
historical context of the Hunnic Empire and the Great Migration adds credence to a key
argument in this study. While the Huns may not have been militarily remarkable
compared to the Romans, they had significant physical and cultural influence on the
barbarian tide flowing into the Roman Empire and on the barbarian successor states that
rose after the fall of the West.



96
4.6 Campochiaro (Italy)
Unlike the previously discussed single-burial sites, the site at Campochiaro is a
cemetery containing 234 inhumations (with excavations ongoing) (Rubini and Zaio 2011:
1552). The early medieval cemetery is located in Molise (Central Italy) and dates from
the sixth to the eighth centuries C.E. The site consists of two inhumation areas: Morrione
and Vicenne.
This site shows the contemporary presence of locals, Lombards, and Avars of the
steppes (Genito 2000: 233; Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1551). According to Rubini and Zaio
(2011: 1552) the ‘multicultural’ nature of the cemetery is demonstrated by the presence of
a variety of culturally specific grave-good types and by preliminary anthropological study
of the skeletal sample. Several graves contained a man with a horse along with a harness
complex with typical Avar stirrups.31 This type of assemblage is rarely found in South
Europe and shows a decidedly East-European and Central-Asiatic influence (visible from
the Iron Age in Siberia, Mongolia, and in the area from Transcaucasia to Hungary until
the Age of Migrations) (Genito 2000: 233).
This site has been chosen for the present study for a number of reasons. Of central
importance is the fact that the cemetery at Campochiaro is one of the few sites that have
been systematically excavated. Most sites (including those previously discussed in this
study) were initially discovered long before standardized archaeological methodology
was in place. Scholars have also suggested that the site at Campochiaro was likely an
outpost against the Byzantine army; the military nature of the site has been demonstrated
31 The actual date that stirrups arrived in the west and their impact on the development of mounted warfare is disputed. In the late sixth century C.E. Emperor Maurice (582 – 602 C.E.) mentions them in his Strategikon (1.2, 2.9)  ̧ probably adopted from the Avars. “Typical” Avar stirrups have a circular bow, an elongated triangular attachment loop, and larger flat tread (Curta 2007: 206; 2008: 297; Genito 2000: 234).



97
through the physical impact of warfare on many of the skeletons. In this case the
examination of skeletal trauma can lead to assumptions about the type of weapons used
and the general physical conditions of warfare. Additionally, numerous graves contain
both a man and his horse along with a harness complex and stirrups. This provides a
picture of the possible accoutrement of a mounted warrior during this time, contributes to
the discussion and significance of horse burials and, more broadly can address questions
about mounted warfare. The site at Campochiaro shows no signs of a stable settlement or
built-up area. However, it is known to be situated at a vital crossing point of three main
pasture routes coming from Abruzzo and extending to Puglia (Genito 2000: 2320). This
allows scholars to link this cemetery to a seasonally migrating group (Rubini and Zaio
2011: 1551-1552). Thus, studying the site can shed light on semi-nomadic burial and
warfare practices which, in turn, can address the problems related to the evidence-scarcity
of the nomadic Huns.
Unlike many of the sites first discovered and excavated prior to the mid-twentieth
century, Campochiaro has a wealth of well-preserved skeletal remains. The remains of the
three individuals from the inhumation area at Morrione will be the focus of this analysis.
They are well-preserved with only minor post-mortem damage (Rubini and Zaio 2011:
1552). The sex and age of the individuals was determined by standards set by Buikstra
and Ubelaker (1994: 15-38). Height was determined by the methods of Trotter and Gleser
(1958: 79-123). The skeletal trauma was analyzed using forensic anthropological methods
regarding in particular the origin and type of lesion (Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1553).
The first individual (No. 20, Figure 14) was a male over 55 years of age at death
and approximately 161.5cm in height. His post-cranial skeleton shows muscular insertion
areas that are deeply and strongly imprinted. These areas are especially significant on the



98
humeri and in the proximal end of the linea aspera of the femora. This feature, suggests
Rubini and Zaio (2011: 1554), could be connected with a strenuous activity of these
specific muscular masses such as drawing a bow and riding a horse. Regarding the
trauma, the cranium of individual No. 20 has a large ante-mortem hole in the left parietal
bone about 6cm in diameter. The original shape of the lesion was sub-circular with
relatively regular edges. This suggests a post-traumatic surgical operation to enlarge the
wound and remove bone fragments, a practice dating back beyond the fourth century
B.C.E. (Prag 1990: 240; Rubin and Zaio 2011: 1556) Interestingly, the process of
cicatrisation (new bone formation as part of the physical process of repair) was advanced,
suggesting a long period of survival after the incident of trauma (Rubini and Zaio 2011:
1555). Rubini and Zaio (2011: 1557) argue that the most probable cause of the injury was
a blow from above, likely from a mace due to the thickness of the parietal bone at the
position of the lesion. Additionally, unlike a blow from an axe which leaves both cut
marks and breakage, a mace typically only produces breakage (similar to the cranial
trauma of individual No. 20).
Figure 14. Campochiaro individual No. 20, (bones present in grey) from Rubini and Zaio, 2011.



99
Individual No. 102 (Figure 15) was a male approximately 50-55 years of age at
death and standing around 169.7cm in height. Severe vertebral osteo-arthritis is evident in
all segments of this individual’s spine, and a lanceolate-shaped ante-mortem wound
measuring 4.5cm in length and 2.7cm in breadth is present on the frontal bone (Rubini
and Zaio 2011: 1556). Similar to individual No. 20, this trauma site shows complete bony
remodeling that suggests a long survival post-injury. Due to its shape, the wound to the
skull was likely produced by an object with a large triangular section and a sharp
extremity (Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1557). This could have been caused by the point of a
sword or a spear; however, the thickness of the frontal bone makes the former unlikely
because a sword blade has a small section. More likely is that the trauma was caused by
an axe-blow which can produce severe damage, even when shielded by a helmet. Further,
the unusual shape of the lesion could be explained by the individual having worn a helmet
during the incident, which also explains why there are no additional cuts around the
lesion (Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1557).
Figure 15. Campochiaro individual No. 102, (bones present in grey) from Rubini and Zaio, 2011.
Individual No. 108 (Figure 16) was also a male over 50 years of age at death
measuring approximately 161.1cm in height. This individual suffered from severe osteo



100
arthritis of the lumbar spine, and perhaps most interestingly, also suffered from
lepromatous leprosy. The condition was fairly advanced and the individual exhibited
rhinomaxillary syndrome associated with destruction of some of the hand and foot
bones.32 The left side of the frontal bone shows a perpendicular cut that runs from the
frontal prominence to the arch of the eyebrows (10.2mm in length, 2mm in breadth, and
negligible depth). In this individual, traces of new bone formation and/or any
inflammatory processes are completely absent (Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1556). The cranial
injury here was likely caused by a sharp weapon (a sword or dagger) due to its
dimensions and shape. Interestingly, because the trauma site lacks remodelling, the
wound likely occurred peri-mortem (around time of death).
Figure 16. Campochiaro individual No. 108, (bones present in grey) from Rubini and Zaio, 2011.
Individual No. 108 presents an interesting case that relates easily to previous
discussions of weapons burials. It is unclear how well this individual would have been
able to perform his duties as a soldier because of the advanced nature of his disease.
32 Leprosy is an infection primarily affecting the skin and the peripheral nerves. Progression of the disease leads to anaesthesia, or numbing, of the affected areas, primarily the hands and feet and often the nose and mouth area. This numbing allows these regions to be more susceptible to injury and infection, often leading to deformation and bone loss (Pálfi 1991: 99).



101
Rubini and Zaio (2011: 1558) suggest a possible theory: due to his inability to fight he
was executed by his fellow soldiers. Conversely, it has been suggested that because of the
nerve damage resulting from leprosy, individual No. 108 may have been more impervious
to pain (Rubini and Zaio 2011: 1557). Whether or not this individual made a fit soldier,
he was buried in a cemetery with associated grave goods and weapons. This speaks to the
military culture discussed in Chapter 3. Whether or not an individual was able to fight in
battle, the symbolic importance of warfare is evident at this site.
‘Horse burials’ can be both culturally and geographically informative as numerous
lines of inquiry can be drawn. As the burials at Zugló and Campochiaro have
demonstrated, horse burials can be categorized into two groups: burials with the entire
horse skeleton and those with part of the horse (head and legs). There are even ‘horse
burials’ that lack horse remains and contain only fittings placed alongside the horseman
or at his feet (Genito 2000: 234). The horse burials at Vicenne are large, rectangular
shaped pits with the horse located to the left of the individual, with spearheads placed to
the right of the horse skull (Genito 2000: 234). Iron bits typically remain in the mouths of
the horses and Avar-type stirrups are located on both sides of the horse skeleton. This
provides evidence of the use of metal stirrups in Italy in the seventh century C.E., despite
their spread to the West being generally placed in the eighth century (Genito 2000: 234).
The different sizes of some of the stirrups (even between left and right on the same
individual) suggest a more individualized small-scale production rather than a mass
production (Genito 2000: 235). This could also suggest that the rider mounted on the left
where the larger stirrup appears most often.
The most detailed primary source of information about the practice of horse
burials is contained in the travel notes of Ibn Fadlan, ambassador of the Abbasid caliph



102
al-Muqtadir (908-932 C.E.) that were sent to the king of the Bulgarians of the Volga (see
Ibn Fadlan, translated by Frye, 2005). His report gives historical, geographical and
ethnographic information. Ibn Fadlan describes a burial and the practice of sacrificing a
horse: the act of killing a horse and placing it (all or in part) into a grave allows the
deceased to ride symbolically to ‘paradise.’ Interestingly this practice was also
documented among the Mongols (Genito 2000: 234).
Belcastro and Facchini (2001: 387) conducted a study examining the
morphometric features of nine out of thirteen horse burials at Vicenne. The remaining
four burials were not preserved adequately enough for this study. Their aim was to
determine if there were any patterned differences between the horsemen and the rest of
the population. The horsemen ranged from 15-18 years of age to over 50 years of age at
death (Belcastro and Facchini 2001: 389). The findings revealed that there were no
significant differences between the two groups with only two skeletons showing marked
variation. The conclusion was that the multicultural context exemplified by the
assortment of grave goods and the morphometric heterogeneity was a result of numerous
migratory phenomena (Belcastro and Facchini 2001: 396). Belcastro and Facchini (2001:
399) argue, however, that the horsemen likely had a special role in society based on the
context of the horse burial and certain patterns of skeletal wear that may suggest a
restricted social group.
Additionally, considering the cost of a horse, the custom of burying complete
horse skeletons in graves might have been a privilege of elite individuals, whereas as the
deposition of only horse fittings could have characterized a lower echelon of society
(Genito 2000: 234).

4.7 Conclusion
The purpose of the above analysis was not to form the definitive picture of the
Hunnic archer, but instead to get an idea of the type of weaponry available during the
Late Roman Empire and, by extension, the type of weapons available to the Hunnic
armies. The princely burials at Tournai, Pouan, and Pietroasa demonstrate both the
symbolic importance of the warrior in the Late Roman-era and illuminate the conscious
displays of power and strength during times of political instability. These burials,
however, do not directly exhibit signs of the importance of mounted archery. While the
warrior was an enduring image in the elite funerary rituals of the Migration Period, this
sample suggests that the equipment of a mounted archer was not a defining characteristic
of European princely burials.
The Budapest-Zuglo burial, however, does emphasize the symbolic and ritual
importance of horses to Late Antique barbarian society, lending further support to the
idea that the Huns valued and relied upon horses. The Campochiaro site, analysed using
recently developed techniques, provides information on the age, sex, and physical well
being of the deceased. The use of grave goods to determine whether an individual was a
soldier can now be corroborated with skeletal evidence of repetitive and strenuous actions
associated with years of military service. While the lack of weapons (or of certain types
of equipment) found interred in Hunnic-era graves has previously suggested a change in
social and military practices, new types of evidence from Campochiaro and other newly
studied sites can be used to extend the study of mounted archery beyond the physical
objects in the archaeological record.

CHAPTER 5
BATTLEFIELD PRACTICES AND LOGISTICS
5.1 Introduction
An important facet of so-called “Decline and Fall” studies focuses on the
supposed declining state of Roman military effectiveness and technical capacity leading
directly to the collapse of the Western Empire. Simply put, this suggests that by the late
empire, Rome’s traditional military discipline had eroded and become increasingly
‘barbarized’ through an influx of ‘Germanic’ peoples both as soldiers and in higher
ranking positions in the military (Coulston 2013: 464; Howarth 2013: 29; Lee 1998: 223).
The term “barbarization” is often used pejoratively concerning the loyalty of the non
Roman soldiers and the effectiveness of the army. This perceived weakness left the
empire vulnerable to the Hunnic Confederacy and their superior mounted archers,
allowing them to easily overwhelm the weak western defences.
This simplistic image of the fall of the West has been challenged from all angles
in Roman scholarship in the past 30 years. Lee (1998: 224) suggests, for example, that
there is little actual evidence suggesting that foederati were disloyal, even when fighting
other barbarians. Most significantly, an argument that assigns sole responsibility for the
fall of the West to a single factor ignores the inherent complexities of any prolonged
social and political process of collapse or transition. In contrast to the ‘declining military’
theory, Elton (1992: 165; 1996: 265) argues that the Late Roman army of the fifth century
C.E. did continue to enjoy the superiority over its enemies that it had during fourth
century Rhine campaigns. In fact, apart from Adrianople the Roman army did not lose a
major battle against barbarian groups between the years 350 and 500 C.E. (Elton 1992:



105
168). Elton (1992: 169; 1996: 165) suggests that the lesser barbarian victories of 406-407
C.E. and those in the years following were not the result of a structural failure of the
Roman army, but can be credited to surprise, overwhelming numbers, atypically
competent leadership, and treachery. Once inside the empire, however, the barbarians and
their weak intelligence system were confronted by professional Roman armies that, as
Elton (1996: 165; 1992: 169) argues, were capable of containing and even annihilating
their enemy. The Romans instead chose to absorb the invading barbarians and utilize their
strength.
This question of strength or weakness can also be looked at in reverse. As Elton
(1996: 166) also suggests, the shrinking imperial tax-base due to barbarian settlement in
Gaul and Spain coupled with the loss of revenue and territory in Africa resulted in Roman
political and economic instability. Thus, it was Roman weakness and not barbarian
strength.
The notion that a militarily superior Hunnic force composed mainly of mounted
archers brought down the failing Roman army and thus the Western Roman Empire is a
complex problem. It is important to examine both parts of the claim to assess the validity:
the strength or weakness of the Roman army and the superiority of the Hunnic mounted
warriors and of the logistics of an army of archers.
The type of fighting style employed by Hunnic groups during this era is highly
reminiscent of other historical Roman opponents. Most significantly, the wars between
the Parthians and Rome (66 B.C.E-217 C.E.) marked an important meeting of Roman
heavy infantry and efficient Parthian horse-archers. The importance of these earlier
engagements is twofold: first, they represent the empire’s familiarity with this style of
warfare prior to the Huns; and second, examining Parthian tactics and weaponry provides



106
a comparison that allows informed speculation about the nature of the little-known
Hunnic military system. The Huns were even said to have employed the famous “Parthian
shot”, so-named after a feigned retreat against the Romans at the Battle of Carrhae (53
B.C.E.). Whether or not the Huns prove to have been the most effective mounted archers,
they were not the first of their kind to be faced (and subsequently beaten) by Roman
armies.33 These tactics would have come as no surprise to late Roman generals.
This section will address to what degree Hunnic mounted archers could have
impacted Roman defences by providing a logistical model of a Roman versus Hunnic
battlefield scenario. This theoretical model will comprise both textual explanations and
diagrammatic representations. The model will assess the validity of the “fearsome
mounted archer” image in contrast to that of the formidable Roman army and will be
accomplished through several lines of inquiry. First, a brief historical look at Roman and
barbarian military encounters will provide context and background for the model. Second,
historical accounts and contemporaneous military manuals, primarily Maurice’s
Strategikon, will be used to get an idea of approximate numbers, formations, tactics, and
training requirements for Roman and barbarian armies. Third, logistics will be discussed
to assess factors such as supply and provisions, carrying capacity and consumption rate
(of both men and animals), and potential distance travelled. Fourth, the experiences and
limitations of soldiers (and specifically archers) as humans will be examined alongside
the mathematical calculations often used to model army behaviour. Finally, cavalry and
the use of horses in combat will be examined logistically from both a numerical and an
‘on-the-ground’ perspective to determine elements such as spacing and terrain, and the
33 The Romans had also encountered effective cavalry during the Hellenistic Period and previously with the Sarmatians in the first century C.E.



107
limitations of working with animals. Each section will come together to form a theoretical
model of a Roman versus Hunnic battlefield scenario that will then be mapped out and
assessed in the concluding chapter.
5.2 Roman and Barbarian Armies: A History of Engagement
During the third century C.E. the Roman Empire entered a politically unstable
period accompanied by a collapse of military coherence, the abandonment of borders by
usurpers marching on Rome, and the invasions of increasingly aggressive barbarian
groups (Goldsworthy 2009: 109; Howarth 2013: 35). As threats from outside the empire
grew, walls were built around all cities and the army transitioned from the traditional
static defence to a more mobile force (Goldsworthy 2009: 109). Although slightly
different patterns emerged in the east and west, out of necessity they experienced a trend
towards a larger number of smaller armies (Lee 1998: 215). A two-tiered system emerged
where certain regiments formed the central field army (comitatenses) with the rest being
stationed in the provinces and along the frontiers (limitanei) (Lee 1998: 213; Whitby
2000: 288). The latter guaranteed an imperial presence in the frontier regions and helped
protect security and communications, control cross-border movement, and further define
the sphere of Roman authority (Whitby 2000: 289). These changes represented part of a
trend towards specialization of both function and armament that began during the third
century. Lee (1998: 215) suggests that a significant reason for the shifts in the Roman
army was logistical expenditure. It is important to note, however, that lack of evidence for
the army during this time makes these changes difficult to fully understand (Howarth
2013: 35).



108
The Roman armies of the fourth and fifth centuries C.E., by contrast, are relatively
well-documented. In the fourth century, the Roman army grew significantly in size,
exhibiting features that strongly distinguished it from its second century counterpart (Lee
1998: 211, 213). In addition to the split between the comitatenses and the limitanei, there
was also a proliferation of units and unit-types. The comitatenses comprised three
significant types of regiment: cavalry (approx. 500 men); infantry (approx. 1,000 men);
and a new type of infantry unit, the auxilium palatinum (approx. 500-800 men). Frontier
troops also began to diversify, exhibiting a mix of old-style legions together with cavalry
units. The precise nature of these units is not clear; however, based on literary and
archaeological evidence these were much smaller than the traditional legion (Lee 1998:
214).
The main fourth century theatres of operation were on the Persian frontiers,
Britain, North Africa, on the Rhine, and on the Danube. It was in the latter region where
Rome most frequently engaged with the Goths, Huns, Avars, and Slavs (Whitby 2000:
288). Through the Sarmatians in the third and fourth centuries the Romans experienced
mounted warfare and from the Gothic and Persian archers they began placing greater
emphasis on defence from missiles (Coulston 2013: 465; Wells 2013: 595). As a result,
the Romans adapted to the numerous facets of siege warfare (Elton 1992: 168).
The end of the fourth century and the beginning of the fifth witnessed a series of
shocking military and political events. The death of Emperor Julian (361-363 C.E.) in a
Persian campaign was followed shortly by the death of Valens and the majority of his
army at the hands of the Goths at Adrianople in 378 C.E. The emperor Theodosius I then
negotiated a settlement with the Goths, shortly thereafter leading an army, composed in
part of Goths, to defeat the usurper Eugenius in 394 C.E. Theodosius died the following



109
year. Within fifteen years the Goths had once again become the enemy, attacking Rome
in 410 C.E. (Howarth 2013: 36). It was here, in the last quarter of the fourth century, that
the Huns first appeared in Europe.
After Theodosius I, Roman emperors became increasingly alienated from the
armies (his young sons, Arcadius and Honorius, did not accompany troops on campaign,
Honorius arguably due to his young age) which allowed for the emergence of army
commanders as highly influential political figures, especially in the West (Lee 1998:
229). By the mid- to late-fifth century, the Western Roman army ceased to exist as a state
institution; it had been replaced by military forces of the successor kingdoms in Gaul,
Spain, Africa, and Italy (Whitby 2000: 288).
5.3 Rome, the Frontiers, and Barbarians
There is much speculation around how the Romans viewed frontier management.
The idea that emperors were able to formulate a grand strategy on an empire-wide scale
has been criticized because in order to achieve coherent policy at this level, high
command would have needed, among other things, accurate geographical knowledge and
reliable sources of intelligence. Lee (1998: 218) argues that these capabilities were
limited, if not lacking entirely, in the Roman Empire. This idea suggests that a clear
frontier policy did not exist and that the Romans simply considered the frontiers as
borders of their logistical network rather than limits of their empire, responding to
problems as they arose (Elton 1992: 170; Howarth 2013: 35; Lee 1998: 218). Reality
more than likely existed somewhere in between. At the start of the fifth century C.E.
Roman armies engaged barbarian forces as frequently outside the empire as they did
within its borders, resulting in the majority of armed forces being stationed along the



110
frontiers (Elton 1992: 168). Germanic soldiers were increasingly employed in auxiliary
forces of the Roman army and by the final decades of the Western Empire it had become
difficult to visually distinguish between them and their Roman counterparts (Wells 2013:
595). This perceived fluidity of the frontier is an important concept that will re-appear a
great deal throughout this discussion.
Barbarians at this time did not maintain standing armies (Elton 1996).34 While the
Romans performed their best in open battles and sieges, the barbarians were most
effective at ambushes and wearing down the enemies through successive raids (Elton
1992: 168). Roman forces at this time became increasingly more mobile, and to
accomplish this mobility (discussed subsequently) while effectively defending Gaul, the
army had to work efficiently and be well situated within a supply network (Elton 1992:
170; Dennis 1984: viii).
The Hunnic attack of 451 C.E. exemplifies a Roman border engagement. They
attacked from beyond the frontiers and were met by a Roman army in Gaul composed
mostly of Romans with some Franks, Visigoths, and Burgundians fighting as allies (Elton
1996: 171). These ‘settlers’ in the empire, according to Elton (1992: 171), most likely
fought for the empire out of self-preservation and, combined, only just managed to hold
off the Huns. Elton (1992: 171) argues that without allies, the Romans would have likely
lost the battle.
Most inter-tribal warfare among the barbarians, as exemplified by the pre-Attila
Huns, was small-scale and mainly consisted of raiding (Goldsworthy 2009: 106). A
chieftain would periodically gain power among the groups, but status was not generally
34 Elton is specifically referring here to the Germans in Gaul; however, much of the tactics described hold true for many barbarians facing the Roman Empire.



111
passed down through generations. This disunity was much easier for the Romans to
handle and often came with the benefit of barbarian alliance and direct military aid
(Goldsworthy 2009: 107). In the middle of the third century C.E., however, frontier
defences on the Rhine and Danube faltered and successive bands of raiders broke
through. As previously described (Chapter 2.1), this preceded the arrival of the Huns into
Europe; a push of border tribes into the empire, raiding or begging asylum.
The Huns had the advantage of being both tactically and strategically mobile, with
wagons transporting vital resources that could withdraw beyond conflict areas
(Goldsworthy 2009: 317). Goldsworthy (2009: 317) claims that all Huns were mounted
and accustomed to travelling on horseback, which is a claim reminiscent (although not
cited) of Ammianus, although it may be a slight exaggeration. Historically the people of
the steppe were primarily horsemen, emphasizing light weapons and rapid movement;
tactics that allowed the Huns to strike quickly during their raids, often escaping with
minimal losses (Kazanski 2013: 494; Wells 2013: 596). Ammianus wrote that the Hunnic
warriors shot arrows from a distance and then rode into battle with their bows or swords
to engage the enemy at closer range (31.2.9). The Roman army also encountered a fair
number of Germanic groups and interestingly, the literary sources give an entirely
different picture of these engagements. According to Goldsworthy (2009: 106), few
Germanic warriors were mounted and armour was rare. The majority wielded a spear,
javelin, and shield, while the minority had swords that were, by the third century, almost
invariably Roman-made (Goldsworthy 2009: 106).



112
5.4 Military Theory in the Literature
Whately (2013: 133) argues that it is important to understand the nature of
specific conflicts and wars in order to situate them within the “wider strategic culture” of
the empire. Doing this, he argues, necessitates more than a chronological reconstruction
and must focus instead on issues such as impact, strategy, and military culture (Whately
2013: 133). Unfortunately, the record of the Late Empire is sparse and there are
comparatively few sources that deal specifically with military issues (Whately 2013:
111). The Theodosian Code, as one example, preserves laws related to the creation,
sustenance, and functioning of certain elements of the Roman army. The Notitia
Dignitatum, an official document from the 420s describes the formal organization,
structure and disposition of both eastern and western Roman forces (Lee 1998: 211;
Whitby 2000: 288). As there are few surviving descriptions of Late Roman military
conflicts, the work of military theorists represents some of the most important sources of
information for battlefield tactics and ‘grand strategy.’ Fortunately, a significant number
of these works have survived, including De Rebus Bellicis (Anonymous, fourth century
C.E.), Vegetius’ Epitoma Rei Militaris (late fourth or early fifth century C.E.), Urbicius’
Epitedeuma and Taktikon (sixth century C.E.), Syrianus Magister’s On Strategy,
Rhetorica Militaris, and Naumachia (ninth century), and finally Maurice’s Strategikon
(approximately 590 C.E.). These authors, although not always identifiable, had a wide
range of backgrounds from ‘armchair generals’ to individuals with actual combat
experience, incorporating in their work a variety of approaches and aims (Whately 2013:
118).



113
5.5 Roman Training, Tactics, and Organization in Maurice’s Strategikon
One of the most influential military texts is Maurice’s Strategikon. This manual
discusses tactics (in particular cavalry) of the late sixth century army, an outline of
procedures for battle preparedness, and an important discussion of some of Rome’s
enemies, including the Huns (Whately 2013: 118). There are several important
considerations when using military manuals. While a great deal of information about
numbers, formations, training, and regulation is often incorporated, the human element
must not be neglected and the practical value of these texts must be carefully considered.
Because the nature of the publication of these works is often largely unknown, a
researcher must consider whether these manuals described contemporary warfare or
whether they represent compilations of earlier works within the tradition (Whately 2013:
119). In addition, while scenarios were often meticulously planned in advance, not all (in
fact, not many) military engagements went exactly as intended. This gap between theory
and reality must be acknowledged. Nevertheless, Maurice’s Strategikon is an invaluable
source of information for this study and will help form a clearer picture of what an
engagement between Roman and Hun forces could have looked like and what tactical
considerations were in effect. This, in turn, will help create a model of such an
engagement that will address the overarching question of whether the Huns were as
formidable as Ammianus described: an insurmountable force facing the faltering Roman
army, or whether “fearsome mounted archers” was a convenient description for a people
that, while not directly facilitating it, played a role in the fall of the Western Roman
Empire.
Maurice’s Strategikon was written during a period of military transition, both in
terms of tactics and armament. In response to their enemies’ increasing reliance on a



114
mounted offensive, cavalry, and in particular horse archers, began to play a more
significant role in the Roman army (Lee 2011: 153). The Roman army would recruit
barbarians through many sources: defeated enemies, prisoners of war, individuals
entering the empire in search of employment, and barbarian groups settled within the
empire (Lee 1998: 222; Whitby 2000: 290). In fact, not long before the Battle of
Adrianople in 378 C.E. the Goths had served in the Roman army as foederati, a long
enduring practice in the Empire. While the use of foederati was not a new idea (it had
been employed since the Republic to annex resources and defuse hostility), barbarians
had not been incorporated into the Roman army in such large numbers before the fourth
century C.E. (Lee 1998: 223; Whitby 2000: 290).
After the disaster at Adrianople (when Ammianus claims that two thirds of the
Roman field army was destroyed), barbarian recruitment continued to rise. The
unforeseen effect of this policy was not only a significant number of barbarians rising to
high positions in the army, but also that Gothic troops were occasionally put under Gothic
control, giving large groups of barbarians settled within the empire a sense of autonomy
(Lee 1998: 223). The groups of foederati varied in size, from a few hundred to 10,000,
and were under the command of the magister militum (Whitby 2000: 290). The effects of
high-ranking barbarians were widespread. The East witnessed profound transformation
and in the West by the 460s the Roman army was replaced by private armies under the
control of powerful landowners or Germanic warlords (Liebeschuetz 2007: 48). Lee
(1998: 223) suggests that increasing Gothic independence within the army contributed to
a “Gothic Problem” that later emerged. Another effect, often labelled the “barbarization”
of the Roman army, is exemplified by the shifting from traditional Roman military tactics
and equipment to more “barbarian” weapons and fighting styles. Vegetius, a



115
contemporary source, viewed this as a weakening of the Roman army and objectively it
did have certain pitfalls. The agreements made with non-Roman groups significantly
increased both the power and independence of barbarian chieftains, and as Whitby (2000:
290) argues, such independent action in the fifth century contributed significantly to the
collapse of imperial authority.
While not contemporaneous with the Western Empire or the Hunnic invasions, the
information in Chapter 11 of the Strategikon can be reasonably extrapolated to help fill
some gaps in military knowledge in the preceding centuries although the descriptions of
organization and knowledge of enemy tactics may not accurately reflect military theory
and culture during the fourth and fifth centuries. Several other concerns must be
acknowledged. First, while the manual represents clear formations and tactics, it does not
necessarily represent how the Roman army actually fought. Second, discussions of tactics
in antiquity, like most writing of the time, were never purely technical: they were at times
infused with moralizing overtones (Kaldellis 2007: 192). Third, numbers and figures, if
known, might help determine the approximate cost of the military establishment, but they
do not necessarily indicate the empire’s actual military strength which is largely
dependent on its ability to concentrate and provision troops in certain locations (Whitby
2000: 292). Finally, Maurice’s work focuses heavily on cavalry operations. While useful
for the purposes of this study, it likely does not provide a complete picture of Late Roman
military tactics. Conversely, the emphasis on cavalry in both Maurice’s Strategikon and
the preface of Prokopios’ Wars (discussed in a subsequent section) may in fact reflect
tactical priorities that shaped the conduct of war that simply are not represented by the
raw numbers, such as we have (Kaldellis 2013: 197).



116
The Strategikon contains numerous illustrations of the formation of a tagma. (For
definitions of Greek military terminology see Appendix G). These illustrations and
accompanying detail can be used to create a model of Roman versus Hunnic military
engagement. Of particular value is the description of the division of troops. Maurice
writes that the cavalrymen were divided into various tagmata (or banda) composed of
300-400 men. Tagmata were combined to form a meros (under the command of a
merarch) (Maurice 1.4). Cavalry tagmata were divided into a first and second line,
especially if the army was large (2.5). The army was formed into two lines, because
during combat such an organization better facilitated supervision and troop management
(2.1). Generally a third of each meros consisted of assault troops, preferably archers
stationed on the flanks, with the remaining two thirds consisting of defenders (2.3). The
assault troops would move ahead of the main line and rush upon a retreating enemy while
the defenders followed as a support in the event that the assault fell back (1.3).
Following the categorization of troops, an important detail when considering a
military encounter composed largely of cavalry is the space required. It would have been
necessary for troops to march in open order to prevent the crowding of cavalrymen (3.2).
Each man and his mount needed to be far enough apart from each other as to be able to
turn his horse about easily. Maurice (9.5) writes that each horse in the formation occupied
a space of approximately one meter. This, however, does not seem like much room as
normal infantry spacing was three feet and often six (1-2 meters) (Vegetius 3.14-15). In a
discussion of hunting, Maurice (12.D) wrote that to prevent crowding there was a limit of
800 to 1,000 horsemen to each mile, which would provide each man approximately two
meters. Lances, some eight or nine feet in length (2.4-2.7m), must not reach beyond the
front, nor should archers be too close behind a line. A space of four to five feet (1.2-1.5m)



117
between the ranks would prevent men impaling themselves on each other’s spears or
archers from being forced to shoot upwards, causing their arrows to be ineffectual
(Maurice 2.6; Tritle 2013: 284). What Maurice does not discuss here, however, is how
close four to five feet is relative to the kick distance of a horse. The depth of formation
was also important and regulated by the type of unit (Maurice 2.6). A depth of no more
than eight or ten men and no fewer than five was recommended. It is worth remembering
that accomplishing even and safe spacing is difficult during combat, especially at a run,
and demands a high level of training (Tritle 2013: 284).
The units that made up the first line were to march close enough to one another so
that the distance between each meros was enough that the men did not crowd each other
and to make them appear clearly separated (Maurice 2.13). The flank guards marched
close together until they approached the enemy and then moved out to the side about a
bowshot from the left meros. The out-flankers occupied a similar position on the right.
The divisions of the second line were positioned at a bowshot from one another. It is not
clear here whether Maurice is referring to bowshot distance as an archer’s flight range
(shooting as far as possible) or target range (shooting for accuracy) which are
approximately 300m and 130m respectively.
Positioning of the second line during battle was an important consideration. Until
they were near enough to the enemy the second line would follow the first at a distance of
a mile or more, depending on the terrain, to remain unseen (2.13; 3.3). The second line
should not be positioned so far behind the first as to be unable to provide assistance, yet it
should not be close enough to get mixed up with it in battle (2.13). If the army numbered
between five and six to 15,000 men, the second line would have two divisions and one



118
clear space. If the army was larger than 15,000, the Strategikon advises a commander to
organize the second line into four divisions with spaces between them (Figure 17).
Figure 17. The Formation of the First and Second Battle Line in Maurice’s Strategikon (3.8)
Upon closing in, the second line would move to within four bowshots of the first.
Within three or four bowshots of the enemy, the flanks gradually closed while continuing
to advance. Archers would then deploy their arrows as the entire line together began the
charge (3.4). The Strategikon contains a detailed description of the moment after the
command to “charge” is given (3.5). The men would lean forward and cover their heads



119
and part of their horses’ necks with their shields as they raised their lances. Protected by
their shields they rode at a steady charge, not too fast as to break ranks. The archers in the
rear would then begin to shoot.
All of the tactical scenarios in Maurice’s Strategikon were learned and practiced
in the form of drills. The purpose of these was to familiarize troops with various
formations and actions including the pursuit of an enemy, falling back, and an attack from
the rear (3.5). Drills were not limited to formations pertaining to the main charge.
Irregular formations were also practiced, including marching in various circular
movements (accomplished by first falling back and wheeling about), surprise attacks
against the enemy, and providing support to units in trouble (3.5). Fake drills were
occasionally thrown in to practice to prevent enemy spies gaining comprehensive
knowledge of Roman tactics. These drills, both actual and fake, are outlined in the
Strategikon (6.1-4). As an exercise, hunting also provided practical training in endurance,
stealth, patience, and spacing/organization (Tritle 2013: 284).
Tactical solutions for facing various enemies are also described in the Strategikon.
Maurice wrote a section on dealing with Persians (11.1), Scythians (whom he described
as Avars, Turks, and others “whose way resembles that of the Hunnish peoples”) (11.2),
Franks and Lombards (11.3), and Slaves, Antes, and the like (11.4). Maurice’s description
of “Hunnic Peoples” bears a striking similarity to that of Ammianus. He writes that
because they are nomadic, they “endure heat and cold, and the want of many necessities”
(11.2). Another likely exaggerated belief that the two shared was that the Huns, having
been raised on the backs of their horses, could not walk on the ground (11.2). Maurice
also echoes Ammianus with descriptions of greed and talent in mounted archery (11.2).
He expands and diverges from Ammianus in a few critical ways, however. The



120
description of “Hunnish Peoples” in the Strategikon states that in combat these people are
armed with mail and carry both a lance (slung over their shoulder) and a bow. The horses
of high-ranking men were also armed in iron or felt. Maurice writes that they formed their
battle ‘line’ not in three parts, but in units of irregular size, all joined together to give the
appearance of one long line (11.2). They preferred wedge-shaped or scattered group
formations. In addition to their main force, the “Hunnish People” kept a force which they
sent to form an ambush or aid other units. According to the Strategikon, “Hunnish
People” preferred battles fought at long range and ambushes, with a defining Hunnic
tactic being the encircling of their enemies, simulated retreats and sudden returns (11.2).
For a model of this type of engagement, see Figure 24.



121

122
Maurice was concerned with broader strategy when preparing for battle (7). If the
enemy was superior in cavalry he recommended the destruction of forage. Bribery with
gifts and favours could be used to create divisions in diverse groups. Enemies relying on
the spear were to be led to difficult terrain; those relying on the bow were best
encountered in the open in close, hand-to-hand combat. Wet weather also gave an
advantage over enemy archers as the conditions were believed to affect their bows (8.2).
Maurice even gave specific direction for encountering Hunnic and Scythian peoples. An
assault was best launched in February or March when the horses were at their worst after
a long winter. Later he also recommends July, August, or September because the grass is
dry and burns easily, and the enemy cavalry would find it difficult to stay in one place for
any length of time (10.4). Against the Huns, or any group of archers, a commander must
avoid positioning troops on the lower slopes of a mountain or on difficult terrain. Instead,
they should aim to have an elevated starting position. This would ensure the best defence
against hostile detachments lying in ambush (7.2). Maurice also suggests a level and
unobstructed ground when encountering the Huns. A Roman cavalry force would advance
against them en masse and engage them in hand-to-hand combat (11.2).
The Strategikon also contains solutions to the tactical problems presented by these
barbarian groups. When encountering hostile outflanking and encircling movements, a
typical Hunnic strategy, Maurice suggested a commander station two or three banda to
the left side of the first line to act as flank guards (2.4). To the right he would station one
or two banda of archers to serve as outflankers. The second line (or support line) was
separated into four divisions stationed a bowshot distance from one another’s flanks, and
a third line (or rear guard) would be composed of the end divisions of the second line
dropped approximately a bowshot behind both sides (2.4). This third line aids in repulsing



123
any enemy forces appearing in the rear to harass the second line. If the entire enemy force
is mounted, the cavalry was divided into three lines (2.2). To prevent ambushes, three or
four banda (called ambush troops) would be sent to both sides of the battle line. If the
terrain was favourable, the ambush troops on the left could surround the enemy’s right
(2.5). Maurice also made adjustments to his tactics if the enemy’s force was smaller or
larger and cautioned against a completely frontal assault (2.5). Timing, he wrote, was
essential as a well-timed attack on the flanks and rear of the enemy was much more
effective than any frontal attack or charge. The Strategikon also contains a description of
a typical Scythian ambush, whereby they disorient their enemy and catch their force in
the middle of the Scythian formation. To this effect Maurice cautioned against relying
only on one formation, because one mistake could mean the lives of many men (4.2).
Maurice’s cavalrymen wore mail that reached to their ankles and carried bows
suited to the strength of each soldier. They carried spare bow strings in their saddlebags
along with quivers containing 30 to 40 arrows (1.2; 12.5). In his Wars, sixth century
historian Prokopios similarly described Roman cavalrymen in helmets, armour (mail,
lamellar, or scale), carrying either a bow and a sword or a spear and a shield (Kaldellis
2007: 189). All young soldiers were required to possess a bow and quiver regardless of
their skill; unskilled men were instructed to use lighter bows. Maurice (1.2; 12.3) wrote
that it was essential for even the most unskilled to learn how to shoot a bow. In fact, he
dedicates a section in the Strategikon specifically to archery training. Soldiers were
trained to shoot rapidly on foot, “either in a Roman or Persian manner” (1.1). The Roman
manner of shooting a bow, adopted from the steppe nomads, consisted of drawing the
bowstring with thumb and forefinger. The Persian method employed the lower three
fingers (Haldon 1999: 215). The soldiers would be trained to shoot an arrow or throw a



124
small javelin while carrying a shield, all while jumping and running (12.3). Maurice
understood the importance of the key physical properties of archery. He noted the
importance of speed and force in discharging the arrow and insisted that his men were
trained to shoot while mounted so that they were able to shoot rapidly at a run to the
front, rear, right, and left of the horse (1.1). It was also essential that the soldier could
comfortably mount and dismount his horse and switch seamlessly from bow and quiver to
spear.
Archers were deployed in many types of units as described by the Strategikon.
Young and strong men who knew how to shoot a bow would be selected for the light
armed infantry (12.9). They were sometimes placed in formations alternating one heavy
armed infantryman with one archer, and occasionally placed among the files and on the
flanks inside the cavalry (12.12). If the cavalry was large (over 12,000 men) they would
be organized 10 deep (12.13). The Romans deployed either light or heavy cavalry,
depending on the tactics of the opposing force that were often learned from mercenary
groups of the same ethnic background (Dennis 1984: X).
The Strategikon offers several suggestions for the maintenance and management
of these barbarian troops, who by this time formed formal guard regiments. Generally,
allied forces of any kind were not to be mixed in with Roman troops, both on the
battlefield and at camp. This was to ensure that formations and tactics remained secret so
that in any event of hostility on the part of the allies, Roman tactics would not be used
against them (8.2.80). Any units of the same ‘race’ as the enemy were also to be
separated from the army and not permitted to join in battle against their own people. This
was to prevent them going over to the enemy at an “inopportune” moment (8.6; 7.15).



125
Spies were assigned to each tagma to keep both the enemy and their own units under
observation (2.11).
The use of barbarian troops was a long-standing practice in the Roman Army and
Maurice’s text demonstrates a clear strategy for dealing with non-Roman and allied
troops. The existence of the Strategikon and the historical precedent it most likely drew
from suggests that the Western Roman army at the time of Attila was also familiar with
both the advantages and downfalls of using foreign troops and was well-equipped to deal
with numerous outcomes.
5.6 Military Logistics
Many historical sources describe the actions and motives of warfare in antiquity,
whether in terms of divine action or human agency (Whately 2013: 133). Attention is less
often paid to provisioning, logistics, and overall costs of war. Looking at Alexander the
Great (336-323 B.C.E.), Engels (1978: 1) argues that supply was the basis of his strategy
and tactics and postulates this logistical problem: contrary to assumptions that supplies
were collected in each district and used for the next advance, only a limited amount of
supplies could have been taken from place to place due to the “restricted capabilities of
the methods of land transportation.” The solution, he argues, is that Alexander would
have had to arrange in advance with local officials to collect provisions, thus altering a
common perception of supply acquisition and drawing into question the manner in which
subsequent mobile armies acquired supplies.
To attribute Alexander’s success in part to his meticulous attention to provisioning
his army, Engels (1978: 3) calculated consumption rates of food and water based on
known nutritional requirements of men, horses, and other pack animals. It is important to



126
note here that while gross consumption rates vary with the number of troops and animals,
precise numbers do not affect the army’s consumption rate: the weight of food and water
consumed per individual per day (Engels 1978: 3). Second, he calculated the minimum
weight of non-comestible (non-food) items such as tents and military gear. Finally, using
these data Engels (1978: 4) mathematically examined the efficiency of various methods
of transport under various conditions in terms of the weight they could carry, their
consumption of food, and the rate of speed they could achieve. These produced a model
of the Macedonian logistic system which Engels could adjust for terrain and numbers of
personnel and animals (1978: 4).
While the routes taken by Alexander and his army are known with reasonable
certainty, the same cannot be said for much of the Late Roman and Hunnic campaigns.
Due to both lack of historical and archaeological data (and the scope of this study), use of
Engels’ work will be limited to certain components of his study: consumption rates and
weight of non-comestibles. The problems of transportation and provision that Alexander
faced are not unlike those likely faced by Late Roman and barbarian commanders, and
Engels’ conclusions about capability and efficiency will be examined through a Late
Roman lens.
Estimating the number of troops and animals during an expedition can be
reasonably accomplished by references in the sources. Numbers for this exercise can also
be drawn from the second case study (that will be addressed in greater detail
subsequently): Maurice’s cavalry formation in the Strategikon that included 3,000 troops
(9.5). Difficulties arise, however, in computing the number of followers and pack
animals. Followers of Alexander’s army likely differed from their Late Roman
counterparts, so estimates must be made from other sources. Alexander, like his father



127
before him, attempted to limit the number of followers wherever possible, limiting
servants to one for every 10 foot soldiers and one for every cavalryman to carry hand
mills and other gear (Engels 1978: 12). Engels (1978: 18) estimated that there would be
one follower for every three combatants. Soldiers were to carry their own arms, armour,
utensils, and some provisions. Alexander’s speed, argues Engels (1978: 13), was achieved
by limiting a potentially unwieldy and distracting train of followers. Soldiers in Maurice’s
army were accompanied by servants, children, and other members of their family (5.1).
Maurice does not give precise numbers of servants, but he recommends only so many as
to care for the horses.
Movement by land was more difficult and often slower (Engels estimates 24km
per day) because it had to be supported by cumbersome baggage carts that were often
impeded by rough or hilly terrain (Engels 1978: 16; Whitby 2000: 293, see Figure 18).
Campaigns with a large number of wagons were often vulnerable because of their speed
and size. For example, in 479 C.E. the Romans ambushed and captured 2,000 wagons
from a Gothic column that likely stretched more than 8km (Whitby 2000: 293).



128
Figure 18. The Order of March c. 600, in Haldon, 1999.
The number of cavalry can be estimated with relative ease. For Maurice’s case
study 3,000 troops would have 3,000 horses in battle, plus the number of reserve horses.
Maurice (11.2) wrote that the Huns maintained a large herd of horses that provided
nourishment and gave the impression of a huge army. They would keep reserve horses
behind their main line with their baggage train about a mile or two away. The number of
baggage animals is more difficult to calculate as it varied with the amount of supplies
carried and the nature of the climate and terrain (more supplies would have been carried
in arid regions than in fertile terrain) (Engels 1978: 14). The transportation capabilities of
a baggage train would then depend on the type of animal used and the number of wagons



129
employed. A horse or mule, for example, can carry about 90kg for extended distances
(excluding the weight of the pack, approximately 23kg) and would work for
approximately eight hours a day, often without breaks (Engels 1978: 14-15; Engels 2013:
355). In the Roman Imperial Army, individual pack animals were said to carry non
comestible items including a tent, hand mills, kettles, and tool kits for eight to ten days
(Maurice 12.6). Approximately 800 pack animals were used by each legion to carry these
supplies, and would typically be allocated to each squad of ten soldiers. Engels (1978: 17)
estimated that a man can only carry about 36kg for any extended distance so logically
most of the burden would fall to pack animals. Maurice wrote that cavalrymen were to
carry between half and a whole kilogram of bread, barley, boiled meal (or meat), and
water in their saddlebags, which were large enough to hold three or four days’ rations
when necessary (1.2; 7.9; 7.17).
Engels (1978: 18; 2013: 355) calculated that the minimum ration for an adult male
marching through hot terrain would be slightly over 1kg of grain (or its nutritional
equivalent) and at least 2 liters of water per day. Horses and other pack animals would
need, in addition to their usual forage (4.5kg of straw/chaff), 4.5kg of grain and 36 liters
of water per day. These rations could be reduced for a brief period of time, but this put the
army at risk of disease and malnutrition (Engels 1978: 18). All of these rations (excluding
the green forage and water) would have to be carried by the animals because the supplies
would likely not be available along the route. The Huns grazed their horses all year long
and were made vulnerable by a shortage of fodder that resulted from such a large number
of horses (Maurice 11.2).
Engels’ logistical estimations have undeniable value when considering the
problems encountered by nomadic barbarians, helping challenge assumptions of Hunnic



130
organization and tactical effectiveness. Engels (1978: 18) estimates the total number of
people marching with Alexander at the crossing of the Hellespont to be approximately
65,000: 48,100 soldiers and 6,100 cavalry with one follower for every three combatants
(totalling over 16,000). One animal was needed to carry the baggage of 50 people, thus
the army would require 1,300 baggage animals. A total of over 122,000kg of grain
represents the total weight of grain requirements for personnel, cavalry, horses, and
baggage animals for only one day. This would be divided by approximately 109kg
(representing 113kg carrying capacity minus animal’s ration for one day) meaning that
the number of pack animals needed to carry just one days’ supply of grain would be
1,121. These numbers, however, only represent estimations for a terrain with abundant
water and forage for the horses, allowing the horses to only carry grain rations (Engels
1978: 18). Following the same logic, if a two day supply needed to be transported, a total
of 2,340 pack animals would be needed.
It would have been mathematically possible for Alexander’s army to carry its own
grain provisions for just 25 days, because by that time the pack animals would have
consumed all the supplies they carried at a rate of 4.5kg per day (Engels 1978: 19).
However, the practical limit would likely be a 10 day supply of grain because the number
of pack animals needed to carry a larger amount would be staggering. Following the
formula, 40,350 animals would be needed to carry a 15 day ration and an astronomical
107,600 to carry 20 days of grain. While the calculations make the scenario somewhat
easier to imagine, Engels (1978: 19) considers that this many suitable pack animals likely
did not exist in all of Greece. Perhaps the biggest problem suggested by Engels (1978: 19)
is the extraordinary size of the baggage train itself if that many pack animals were used. If
107,600 animals travelled in single-file the line would extend approximately 492km.



131
Because this is not a likely arrangement, it is also worth noting that even if the animals
travelled in a column 10 animals wide, the line would extend 50km. This, Engels (1978:
20) argues, suggests that the Macedonians never employed more than 20,000 pack
animals at a time.
The above estimations are for terrain abundant with forage and grain. With only
water the numbers change significantly. To calculate the necessary number of animals,
Engels (1978: 20) divided 155,582kg (weight of grain required for the same number of
men and animals in addition to fodder for one day) by 104kg (~52km minus 4kg). All
considered, 1,492 animals would be necessary to carry grain and fodder for one day.
Again theoretically the army could have carried 12.5 days of grain and fodder before it
was consumed. More practically, no more than a seven day supply would be possible due
to the sheer number of animals.
Engels (2013: 356) argues that the most important influence on an army’s
logistical capabilities was the number of men, pack animals, cavalry horses, and
followers. Because the ratio between an army’s consumption rate and its carrying
capacity remains constant regardless of numbers, there would always reach a point where
the horses would consume more food than they could carry (Engels 1978: 21; Engels
2013: 355). Yet, the army would have had to keep moving because if it remained
stationary for too long a time it would exhaust the resources of a 48km radius (Engels
2013: 357).
Returning briefly to the Strategikon (9.5), the same series of equations can be used
to get an idea of military logistics in later Roman history. Maurice, writing of a strategy to
make the Roman army appear larger to an enemy spy, describes a theoretical cavalry
formation of 600 men across and 500 deep, totalling 300,000 troops. Each horse occupies



132
a space approximately three feet (~1m) wide and eight feet (2.4m) deep. Spread out in
this formation the cavalry would extend 1,800 feet (~548m) wide and 4,000 feet (1,219m)
deep. The perimeter of this formation would then total 11,600 feet (3535.68m), or 3.6km.
As a mental exercise, Maurice lines up the cavalry in a single long line allowing for the
same spacing on either side of each horse, totalling 900,000 feet (274,320m/290km), and
suggests that in order to make an army look larger, a commander should arrange his
troops in a long, thin line. This case study is useful in conjunction with Engels’ if certain
important variables are noted. First, extraordinarily large armies cannot move with the
same speed as their smaller counterparts and as discussed previously, the scope of
military operations would be limited by the inherent logistical problems (Whitby 2000:
293). Second, estimates for maximum size typically hover around 20,000, with 120,000
being the likely maximum of any pre-eighteenth century campaigning army (Whitby
2000: 293).
Using both the data and conclusions drawn from these two case studies, a picture
of Hunnic military logistics can be formed. On a macro-level that is beyond the scope of
this project, modern sources such as climatic conditions, seasonal conditions affecting
mountain passes, harvest dates, easiest roads for water and forage, cultivatable lands, and
the presence of settled communities can be considered as likely logistical problems
affecting Hunnic mobility. While Roman commanders had imperial territory from which
they could acquire supplies, Hunnic groups, whether smaller raiding parties or larger and
more organized bands, had to resort to invading territories, looting, and extorting gold and
supplies from imperial powers in exchange for security. The mobility of larger groups of
Huns would have been hampered by sheer size, number of followers, and baggage
trains/wagons. As Huns were primarily nomadic, aside from smaller raiding parties, they



133
would have had to travel not only with their implements of war, but also with their stock
animals, temporary shelters, food stores, and their families.
5.7 The Soldier as an Individual
It is essential here to look at both the limitations and capabilities of individual
archers (and their weapons) and at armies as large cohesive units composed of individual
men. Formulas and reconstructions can calculate rate and range of shot, amount of
necessary provisions, and distance travelled; however, there are several unknowns. While
factors such as human eyesight and accuracy of shot can be tested for experimentally,
conditions cannot be accurately recreated and historical data cannot be recovered. For
example, if an archer can shoot 5 arrows in 2.5 seconds, it does not mean that this rate can
be sustained over a meaningful period of time (Strickland and Hardy 2005: 100). The
calculation represents what is physically possible but not what is sustainable. Wear and
tear on both the weapon and on the individual (fatigue, skeletal/muscular injury) would
naturally slow the rate. Additionally, rate of shot is also impacted by the number of
arrows in the archer’s quiver and the circumstances of the engagement.
The function and performance of a bow and arrow on a mechanical level depend
generally on a number of calculable parameters (Kooi 1981: 120). (For more detail, see
Appendix F). The individual archer must maintain the value of these parameters as
constantly as possible, requiring immense skill in addition to technique (Kooi 1991: 23;
Kooi 1004: 283; Kooi and Bergman 1997: 126). Despite the importance of design, rate of
shot, distance, and accuracy of shot are determined primarily by the individual; therefore,
it can be argued that a ‘good’ or ‘bad’ bow can only be gauged within the context of the
functional requirements of the archer (Kooi and Bergman 1997: 34). This assertion casts



134
doubt upon Ammianus’ notion that the Huns fought with superior bows, as efficacy
appears to have less to do with the tool than with its owner.
In an effort to better understand what was done/possible and not done/not possible
on the battlefield, James (2013: 114) argues for the merits of both battlefield simulations
(inside and outside of Hollywood) and critical comparison to contemporary engagements.
He writes of witnessing a professional foxhunting demonstration in England that included
several hundred mounted participants. This experience provided a “visual and visceral
impression” of a unit of cavalry (James 2013: 114). Five hundred horses, even outside a
military context, provide many impacts on the senses. As James (2013: 114) describes,
“the ground reverberated under hundreds of tons of muscle, bone, leather, and metal on
the move”. Modern analogies are accompanied by the inherent pitfalls of both cultural
and technological differences, but nevertheless they provide a useful starting point.
Ethnographic parallels are also a useful source of evidence for traditions of horse
archery, some of which lasted long enough to be documented and the skills passed on
among enthusiasts and specialists (for example, Hungarian specialist Lajos Kassai).
Speaking to an experienced bow maker, archer, and horseman, James (2004: 198; 2013:
114) learned that a mounted archer is more accurate at a gallop than a slower (often jerky)
trot because a fast-moving horse provides a more stable “firing platform.” Re-enactors are
also a useful source of information. Upon conferring with a “centurion”, James (2013:
115) concluded that from a practical perspective, verbal communication between a
superior officer and his troops was often difficult, even in ideal conditions, due to the
noise of animals and equipment.
Even if soldiers were armed with bows, spears, and swords, this does not
necessarily reveal how they actually fought (Kaldellis 2007: 191). To become an



135
extremely skilled archer took many years of training. It is possible, therefore, that allied
forces (volunteer or otherwise) of both the Huns and the Romans were armed with
powerful weapons but were unable to wield them effectively. As James (2013: 116)
notes, the simple act of trying on replica armour, wielding the weapons, riding a horse,
vaulting into a saddle, or shooting a composite bow in a re-enactment setting can give an
idea of how heavy and difficult the mere basics of military service were (James 2013:
116).
5.8 Cavalry and Cavalry Horses
A discussion of mounted archery would be incomplete without noting several key
points about the horses themselves. While often viewed as a flexible implement of war,
their psychological temperament, physical capabilities, and training play an important
role in determining outcomes and effectiveness on the battlefield. Steppe horses like those
used by the Huns were smaller than Roman horses, yet they were necessarily tough
allowing for survival in their native conditions (Goldsworthy 2009: 317).
Roman cavalry horses described in the Strategikon (1.2) wore protective pieces of
iron armour on their heads and breast plates made of iron or felt (Figures 19 and 20).



136
Figure 19. “Parades and Processions, Clibanarii, Rome, AD 356,” Christa Hook.



137
Figure 20. Late Roman Cavalryman, from Um Kampf Rom, Gerhard H. Kuhlmann.
Early cavalry horses were outfitted with a saddle with horns at the front and rear
to secure the rider (Hyland 2013: 507). Maurice also wrote of thick cloths under the
saddle, bridles, and iron stirrups with a lasso and hobble (1.2). Even if fully armoured,
horses were frequently injured, most severely with puncture wounds, resulting in
infection and almost certain death (Hyland 2013: 503). Ammianus (16.12.21) describes
the battlefield threat of arrows, javelins, lances, and even infantrymen crawling among
the horses to stab them. Once an outbreak began, endemic illness also travelled quickly
through the ranks. Goldsworthy (2009: 117) suggests that cavalry horses were a lot more



138
difficult to feed (likely owing to the required caloric intake and various dietary
predilections) and keep in good condition than soldiers.
The temperament of a horse is an often neglected yet vitally important factor to
consider. Maurice recommends a very infrequent use of the battle cry “Nobiscum” to
begin charge because it created a problem for the horses whose temperament, like men,
differs depending on the individual and circumstance (2.18). If the horses became
frightened or disoriented the battle line could easily become uneven and its ranks broken.
He issued the same caution about war trumpets (2.17). An example of this phenomenon is
the Battle of Busta Gallorum in 552 C.E. when the Romans caused alarm among the
Gothic cavalry horses by clashing their shields loudly (Kaldellis 2007: 203).
Cavalry horses were trained to become accustomed to rapid maneuvering in open
fields and over hilly, thick, and rough ground to potentially mitigate any surprise or
trouble resulting from a change in ground conditions (7.17). Training a cavalry horse well
required immense skill due largely to their varied temperament. A bit was used not only
to simply control and direct the animal, but also to give a subtle series of communications
and effect complex manoeuvers (Hyland 1992: 73). Even a command as seemingly
simple as lowering to the ground with no forward movement (called the levade) was both
vital and difficult (Hyland 1992: 73). Improper training and treatment of each individual
cavalry horse could lead the rider into danger during battle. If a certain horse was more
sensitive to pain, applying too severe a bit could cause it to rebel, leading it to charge into
the enemy, retreat, or rear up on its hind legs (Hyland 1992: 74). This was all
incorporated into both training the horse and training the cavalryman to interact with his
mount, and if not accomplished properly could have rendered a horse dangerous to its
rider or in extreme cases made it useless for duty (Hyland 1992: 74).



139
Even with the requisite training, however, horses will not allow themselves to be
put into positions of extreme danger as ‘perceived’ by them. For example, if an enemy
infantry force is headed by a unit of soldiers wielding spears it is unlikely that a cavalry
horse will charge at full speed into the wall of spikes. Here horses appear more intelligent
than their riders in their refusal to charge a line of spears and shouting men. As
Machiavelli wrote: “if you want to make an experiment of this, try to run a horse into a
wall with whatever impetus you want” (2.95).
5.9 A Discussion on the Effectiveness of Mounted Archery
Like all weapons, when used to its fullest potential, the bow had the ability to
control any military situation. On the effectiveness of archers and cavalry, Maurice writes
that archers were essential for surprise attacks and that without cavalry, it is impossible to
confront an enemy with any degree of safety (9.1; 11). Horse archers could repel the
charge of Roman clibanarii (armoured cavalry) and continue to inflict damage during a
retreat, employing the infamous “Parthian Shot.” A disorganized charge could be further
weakened by ambushes at the flank (Bivar 1972: 289). In the introduction to Wars,
Prokopios also discusses effectiveness and provides a valuable description of mounted
archers (Kaldellis 2007: 189). The latter passage has often been taken literally, causing
some historians to envision the dawn of a new era of cavalry warfare in the sixth century
(Kaldellis 2007: 189). An alternate (and perhaps more useful) reading of his work
highlights trends in Roman military culture that Prokopios found distressing, including an
over-reliance on cavalry and the use of barbarians in the Roman army (Kaldellis 2007:
189). Ammianus also found the trend of employing barbarians in favour of locals
“disastrous to the Roman state” (19.11.7, 31.4.4).



140
Prokopios describes archers wearing a thorax (Figure 21) and writes of bows so
powerful that no armour could withstand them, wielded by expert horsemen who could
skillfully deploy missiles to either side, forwards, or backwards at a full gallop (1.1.12
15). Considering this description it is difficult to imagine a soldier in this context being
easily able to shoot arrows backwards at a full gallop while wearing such constricting
armour. This is not to say that it did not happen; however, it is useful to consider
depictions of mounted archers and the purported efficacy of mounted archery through the
lens of physical capability. What follows is a brief discussion of a few facets of mounted
archery that should be considered both in a Hunnic context and within the question of
efficacy.
Figure 21. Roman Thorax, from P. T. Struck, University of Pennsylvania.



141
To begin with, cavalry are faster than infantry over short distances and a fit and
well-fed horse can comfortably sustain a speed of approximately 25km per hour,
occasionally achieving speeds in excess of 30 (Hyland 2013: 516). However, on longer
campaigns the advantage of cavalry decreases logistically (Goldsworthy 2009: 117). This
is due in part to the nature of caring for horses; however, more significantly, an army can
only travel at the speed of its slowest element. Horses only offer a speed advantage if the
entire force is mounted and without carts and camp followers. Maintaining the daily
requirements of grain and forage and the requisitioning of supplies requires either a high
degree of logistical planning and sophistication or certain sacrifices, such as distance,
achieved in one day or period.
Whether the westward movement of the Huns is considered that of an “empire”, it
is difficult to reconcile the level of planning necessary to feed and water troops as
exemplified by Alexander the Great to the descriptions of nomadic barbarians, whether or
not they (eventually) maintained a home base on the Hungarian Plains. Encountering (and
overtaking) small nomadic bands or approaching settled communities on the edges of the
Roman Empire, the Huns conducted much of their early supply acquisition through
raiding. Their success on this front can be seen in one of two ways. First, the Huns were
so effective in their style of combat that they completely overwhelmed all of their
adversaries and thus gained supply-line, military, and land advantages that sustained their
movement through Western Europe. Alternatively, the small groups and settled civilian
populations that were either frequently raided or completely annexed by the Huns put up
as much resistance (to combat or bribery) as the words “small” and “civilian” suggest. In
addition to food supplies acquired through raiding, Hunnic horses required enough



142
pasture to sustain them in one place and enough freedom to move to another when the
resources were exhausted.
It is clear that the Romans placed a heavy premium on the training of their armies.
This was done very systematically to test the proficiency of individual soldiers and to
improve tactical co-ordination (Rance 2002: 223). It took years for an archer or a
cavalryman to become proficient, let alone in enjoying success at both simultaneously.
These same skills were practiced at least as effectively (or as some argue more so) among
the Huns. Members of the Hunnic confederacy were not ethnically or culturally
homogeneous in origin, equipment, or training. It is therefore possible that the Hunnic
armies more closely resembled the later Roman armies, replete with groups of foederati,
allied forces, and mercenaries, each trained under their own customs. Nevertheless, it is
unlikely that a similarly standardized training regimen was employed by the Huns.
The effective use of mounted archers required advanced military tactical and
strategic planning and was contingent upon matters of spacing, both on and off the
battlefield. In addition to sufficient pasture, horses (even smaller steppe horses) are large
animals requiring a significant amount of physical space. Enough room must be kept
between horses on the battlefield; enough on either side to give maneuverable room
around the horse while it is in motion, and even more so to the rear of the animal for
obvious reasons. Due to the high number of casualties among cavalry horses and the
degree of fatigue resulting from their strenuous work, both Roman and Hunnic
cavalrymen needed to keep spare horses which also must be kept fed and healthy
(Maurice 5.2). The Romans left these with the baggage train because amid the confusion
of battle, as Maurice wrote, no one could recognize his horse and hope to mount it.



143
Finally, it is important to rethink the assumption that the chronological
development of archery equipment (culminating here with the Hunnic bows, refer to
Figures 22 and 23) was a process of improvement of performance. Rather, the design of
the Hunnic bow represents one solution to the problem of creating a mobile weapon
system capable of discharging lightweight projectiles (Boie and Bader 1995: 31; Kooi and
Bergman 1997: 126, 134). Nineteenth century German military historian Hans Delbrück
wrote “the fact that the further one pulls the string, the stronger the shot, cannot have been
a new discovery...good marksmen have certainly always bent their bows as strongly and
as far as their physical strength allowed” (Delbrück 1975: 386-7). His argument addresses
the importance of the archer and his physical capabilities and skill. Maurice recognized
the disparity in strength among archers and allowed weaker or unskilled men to use less
powerful bows than those used by the regular troops (1.2). The more experienced the
archer the better able to master complex weaponry and make the required minute
corrections for each shot. Even composite bows warped over time, and a bow was likely
not the only weapon in an individual’s kit that altered with age.
The level of training and the manner in which the Huns acquired their material is
obscured by time and lack of reliable data. Yet, it is reasonable to assume that because the
Huns were not the first significant army of mounted archers in history, or even the first to
attack the Romans, they did not necessarily represent a novel and insurmountable threat
to the Roman Empire on their own.

CHAPTER 6
CONCLUSION
6.1 The Huns and the Fall of the West
The Huns appeared in the historical and literary record in the late fourth century as
a barbarian horde clashing with surrounding barbarian groups and eventually with the
Roman Empire itself. When Rua (and eventually his nephew Attila) obtained military
leadership in the 430s the Huns emerged as a cohesive force. While largely nomadic, the
Huns made their home on the Great Hungarian Plain, an extensive grassland fit for the
pasturing of vast numbers of horses that provided a base from which to attack both north
and south of the Danube River (Kelly 2008: 59). At the beginning of the fifth century, the
Huns began to demand tribute payments in exchange for peace. This put the Huns in an
interesting position relative to the Empire: they were both a persistent security problem
while at the same time offering themselves as the most viable solution.
Attila launched several campaigns against the West and was finally checked in
451 C.E. at the Battle of the Catalaunian Fieds. While the battle was indecisive, the Huns
appeared to suffer the worst of the exchange and withdrew to Pannonia (Halsall 2007:
253). After Attila’s abrupt death, the Hunnic confederation fell to factional discord and
the Huns as a united force disappeared from history. During the two decades following
the disintegration of the “Hunnic Empire”, the Western Roman Empire collapsed fitfully
and eventually fell when Odovacar deposed Romulus Augustulus in 476 C.E.
The image of the Hunnic archer as a fearsome warrior, and of the so-called
“Hunnic Empire” as a political and military force capable of rivaling an institution as
powerful and prolific as the Roman Empire is problematic. Three sources of evidence



147
were used in this study to test this prevailing image and will be evaluated once more,
illustrating how the existing evidence, as sparse as it is, does not match the expected
characteristics.
6.2 The Primary and Secondary Literature
As previously discussed, much of what is known of the Huns survives as
descriptions of their seemingly unique mounted archery skills. The three historians in this
study have vastly different relationships with their subjects. Ammianus’ Huns existed
long before Attila, arguably before any sort of unification had even begun. The barbarians
he described resembled loosely organized nomadic raiders far from the barbarian
aristocracy that Priscus described much later. While ethnically identified as the same
people (a problematic notion in itself) these Huns do not bear many similarities.
Menander’s descriptions can serve here as a bridge between the two. Menander’s Turks
lived out of wagons and tents like the Huns of Ammianus, yet they used objects made of
precious metal and expressed ritualistic mourning similar to the Huns of Priscus. This
apparent change in Hunnic society conforms to a reasonable historical timeline. The
further the Huns travelled across the steppe into Europe the more they would have been
forced to change; they experienced different climates, surrounding peoples, styles of
leadership and social customs, and most significantly, a more ‘evolved’ relationship with
their biggest and most powerful adversary: the Roman Empire.
Along with the sparse archaeological record, these sources make up, for better or
for worse, the prevailing image of this widely mythologized and highly misunderstood
people. Based almost entirely off the texts of Ammianus, some modern historians, like
Kim, maintain that the Huns were the most formidable mounted archers of their time,



148
capable of challenging, or even of unravelling, the Roman Empire. This presents an
interesting problem: the Huns of Ammianus appear very differently in the historical
record from the Huns that existed around the fall of the Western Empire. Many elements
of Ammianus’ descriptions stand alone, unconfirmed by later writers, resembling more
the ancient writings of Herodotus with whom he was likely educated. Ammianus’
reasoning for facial scarification (to prevent the growth of facial hair) and his description
of those on whom it was practiced (children) appear to be refuted by both Priscus and
Menander who describe grown men gashing their cheeks in mourning. Additionally,
Ammianus describes Hunnic prowess with unique bone-tipped arrows, yet none have
been discovered in the archaeological or historical record in association with the Huns.
Kim (2013) argues that the end of the Western Roman Empire was brought about
by the Huns, specifically a Hunnic ‘Empire’, not only through military might, of which
there was plenty, but also by a Hunnic intervention in Roman internal affairs that
prevented the resolution of the “barbarian problem.” This, he argues, led to the erosion of
Roman military capacity, eventually leading to its destruction at the hands of the
‘barbarian tide’. Interestingly, he concedes that the death of Attila precipitated an almost
immediate breakup of the “Hunnic Empire.” Therefore, it is difficult to imagine that a
quickly unravelling confederacy sustained itself long enough to even witness the fall of
the Western Empire, let alone be its central cause. Conversely, and exemplifying the
complicated nature of this discussion, Thompson (1948) argues that not only did the Huns
not contribute meaningfully to post-Roman Europe, they actually delayed the collapse.
Landing somewhere in the middle of Kim and Thompson, Maenchen-Helfen
(1973) argues reasonably that while not necessarily capable of actually ending the
Western Roman Empire, the large-scale plunder and extortion committed by the Huns



149
could not have been accomplished without a significant degree of military organization.
Kelly’s (2008) somewhat equivocal argument best represents the complexity of the issue
because while not standing firmly in either camp, he seems to suggest that a multitude of
interconnected factors led up to the fall of the West, one being Attila the Hun. He argues
that while Attila could not be blamed for the fall, it could not have occurred without him
and without his untimely death. The suggestion that his absence played an equally
important role strengthens Kelly’s argument (and that of many others) that the Hunnic
legacy was perhaps not superior mounted archers. The strategic shift between the Huns of
Ammianus and those fighting under Attila, that is, the transition from pillaging to
extortion, is perhaps the true brilliance of the Huns; not fighting the Romans, but avoiding
large-scale confrontations at great benefit.
6.3 Weapons Burials
Despite the significance of Hunnic archers in the primary texts, few of these
descriptions are borne out in the archaeological record. If the Huns were primarily
archers, one could reasonably expect a degree of archaeological evidence. However,
finding and interpreting this evidence is problematic. To begin with, archaeological
evidence of conflict during this era is exceedingly sparse. Even using the primary
literature as a guide usually leads nowhere as contemporary historians were less interested
in exact geographical location and more interested in political turmoil and the
personalities of generals and emperors leading armies into battle. As the Huns were
primarily a nomadic people, they are even more difficult to locate archaeologically
because sites for nomadic groups are often limited to funerary deposits. Additionally,
when a site is discovered, attempting to view the Huns as a single ethnic group is



150
misleading because, much like the Roman Empire, the Hunnic Confederacy drew from
wide geographical and cultural areas. As the Huns traversed the Steppe into Europe they
seized control of numerous barbarian groups, forming a multi-ethnic confederacy.
Therefore, to identify a specifically “Hunnic” gravesite is nearly impossible. As this study
demonstrates, it is more important to look at both what is present (princely barbarian
graves and the geographical and temporal transmission of cultural styles) and what is
remarkably absent in the archaeological record: abundant evidence of an unprecedented
number of mounted archers.
Despite these complications, much can be inferred about barbarian military
practices and Hunnic social, cultural, and military influence through the archaeological
record. The princely sites used in this study demonstrate the true cultural impact that the
Huns and other Danubian peoples had on surrounding groups and on the formation of the
post-Roman barbarian kingdoms. These sites illustrate the social and political importance
of the warrior, not exclusively the archer, by providing insight on what types of
weaponry existed during the Hunnic Era. These sites also provide information on stylistic
and geographical origin of weapons burial practices, which, in turn, sheds light on the
importance of archery and the warrior image in Late Antique barbarian cultures.
What princely burials lack, the sites at Campochiaro make up for in detail about
style of warfare. While thorough osteological analysis is beyond the scope of this study, it
is clear through the examination of these human remains that much can be postulated
about individuals interred in a context of conflict. It is important to note, however, that
physical traces on the skeleton resulting from an anomalous, genetic, or taphonomic
nature can present very similarly to trauma-induced skeletal markers. Inferring repetitive
action from skeletal markers, such as those at Campochiaro, is possible; however,



151
extrapolating occupation is often problematic without a sufficient degree of context.
Certain types of agricultural work, for example, can produce enlarged muscle attachment
sites similar to those produced by wielding heavy weaponry. Additionally, falls from
heights (such as falling off a horse) and many other forms of blunt force trauma
documented in agricultural populations, commonly associated with lower limb, humoral,
and clavicle fractures, present similarly to combat related injuries (Judd and Roberts
1999: 240; Wentz and De Grummond 2009: 113). This is why the individuals at
Campochiaro are so important. In addition to markers of repetitive action and evidence of
various forms of trauma, context makes it infinitely more likely that the individual was a
soldier rather than a farm labourer.
6.4 Logistics, Strategy, and Battlefield Simulation
This study addressed Roman and Hunnic engagement on both a battlefield level
and on a larger strategic, tactical, and logistical level to assess the degree to which the
Huns could have impacted the Roman military. The diagrammatic and textual
explanations of this engagement considered the historical background of Roman and
barbarian military engagements, contemporaneous military manuals, logistical and supply
considerations as they affect troop movement, the experiences and limitations of soldiers
as individuals, and the use of cavalry horses in terms of behaviour, training, and physical
spacing.
On an individual level, the analysis in Chapter 5 revealed that the practice of
shooting a bow and arrow required a great deal of training and physical strength. Despite
Ammianus’ claim that the Huns wielded uniquely superior bows, the true limitations of
effectiveness lie mainly in the human element. Mathematical calculations, like rate of



152
shot, can provide reasonable estimates; however, the highest rate cannot physically be
sustained over a meaningful period of time. Both man and man-made weapon display
wear and tear that could significant diminish efficacy. With this in mind, while the Huns
could have trained from a young age to be expert bowmen, such skills may not have been
present in the numerous amalgamated barbarian groups that formed the Hunnic
Confederacy. By the time of Attila, therefore, it is likely that only a small number among
the Hunnic ranks were the truly expert bowmen described in the ancient texts.
One of the most important conclusions drawn from this study regarded the
physical capabilities of both Hunnic and Roman armies and strategies. As an extension of
the Roman Empire, Rome’s armies were enduring and powerful, able to requisition
supplies and manpower from the vast territory under the empire’s domain. Next to the
Roman Empire (and even the later Mongolian Empire) it is difficult to view Attila’s Huns
as an “Empire” to the same degree. Rome and her citizens accepted huge financial and
social costs to sustain its military might and allow for more versatility than surrounding
peoples. If supplying and provisioning an army with the might of the Roman Empire
behind it was challenging, it can only have been that much more daunting for the Huns, a
largely nomadic people without much in the way of a permanent base, almost completely
lacking resource and manpower stability. Despite lucrative pillaging, until Attila’s
monetary demands from the Roman Empire the Huns lacked coherence. As the
confederacy grew, amalgamating even more of the surrounding groups, sustaining the
same degree of power would have been an almost insurmountable challenge.
The use of Maurice’s Strategikon and the two case studies employed in this study
help form a feasible picture of Hunnic military logistics. Many factors, some of which are
beyond the scope of this study, affected Hunnic mobility and effectiveness. As Hunnic



153
groups grew larger and more cohesive, forward movement would have been hampered by
sheer size, number of followers, and all the requisite baggage and supply vehicles.
Without a permanent base (or far from the Hungarian Plain) the Huns would have to
travel with huge stores of food, extra weaponry (particularly arrows and spare bows), and
temporary shelters. This, however, is also true for the mobile Roman army.
Even if the military force of the Huns was as Ammianus described and they really
were exceptionally trained, disciplined, and effective mounted archers, the Huns were by
no means the first mounted archers encountered by the Roman Empire. The Romans had
encountered and familiarized themselves with this style of warfare over the preceding
centuries and thus it is unlikely that any degree of strategic or tactical brilliance on the
part of Attila (who was, in fact, never entirely successful in direct combat with a Roman
army) could have surprised or overwhelmed the Western Roman Empire.
6.5 Conclusion
The Huns represent an interesting historical paradox; they are simultaneously one
of the most well-known yet most misunderstood groups in history. Their reputation as
fearsome mounted archers is owed in large part to Ammianus Marcellinus and is
perpetuated by an increasingly small group of modern historians whose focus remains on
his exaggerated descriptions. The nature of Ammianus’ Huns and the fall of the Western
Roman Empire, however, must be looked at separately. The Huns of Ammianus and those
fighting under the banner of Attila may not have even recognized each other. The early
Huns were composed of small raiding bands that lived an exclusively nomadic lifestyle.
Attila’s Huns, described by Priscus of Panium, were part of larger and more organized
Hunnic confederacy. They were less nomadic by nature, maintaining, as they did, a base



154
on the Hungarian Plain, and consisted of a multi-ethnic conglomeration of surrounding
barbarian groups. The later Huns moving across the Eurasian Steppe into Europe
encountered different climatic, geographical, and socio-political conditions, likely
necessitating a change in tactics. Moving across different terrain could have made it
harder to be pastoralists, affecting Hunnic reliance on horses. While Ammianus’ Huns
could have focused primarily on mounted archery, it is likely that by the time of Attila,
their society and their military focus had evolved into something more complex as their
relationship with the Roman Empire changed.
The question of the fall of the Western Roman Empire is far too complex for a
single solution, so one has not been attempted by this study. The evidence and arguments
put forth, however, shed light on a number of likelihoods, and most importantly, re
evaluate a problematic traditional image. Rather than Hunnic archers toppling one of the
world’s most successful and wide-reaching empires, a more reasonable explanation of
Hunnic involvement in the fall of the West could present thusly: The Western Roman
Empire continued to be burdened with the economic and social costs of maintaining
armies on and off the frontiers in the face of an approaching barbarian tide. This occurred
in conjunction with the inherent political and social issues of incorporating these same
barbarian groups into the empire as refugees, citizens, and soldiers. This combination of
social, political, and economic factors put too much strain on the empire at a critical
moment in history that happened to coincide with the several successful military and
economic campaigns led against the empire by a powerful Hunnic ruler, and the power
vacuum created by his sudden death.

APPENICES
APPENDIX A
G. Halsall’s Adaptation of Gerald Dunning’s 1968 Questions for Determining an
Intrusive Rite.
1) Is it significantly different from the rites of the “host country?”
2) Are the rite’s geographical origins known with precision and do they lie outside
the “host country?”
3) If 2 is satisfied, does the rite appear earlier than, and then overlapping
chronologically with, its appearance in the “host country?”
APPENDIX B
Theuws and Alkemade’s (2000) Criteria for an Object’s Ethnic Identification.
1) Legal: in which the weapons deposited in graves are identified as the Hergewede
known from later texts. The assumption that weapon burial is seen as the evident
by-product of specific Germanic property-rights.
2) Stylistic: where the shape and design of artefacts are considered both “unRoman”
and characteristic for an assumed Germanic or barbarian taste (lack of technical
knowledge).
3) Religious: deposition thought to reflect pagan conceptions on the afterlife and the
“primitive” fear of the dead.
APPENDIX C
A more detailed physical description of some objects found in the burial at Pouan as they
appear in Chapter 4.3. Descriptions are sourced from the technical report of A. Thouvenin
of the Laboratoire d’Archéologique des Métaux de Nancy.
A small piece of gold work (unidentified/undetermined items) sometimes described as a
buckle, consisted of a small gold ring on which a circular element lined with garnets is
built. This is surrounded by a beaded gold thread. The latter is likely how it was attached
to leather.



168
Two cloisonné belt buckles are decorated in gold cloisonné welded to a shaped base
plate with four large garnets partitioned on embossed gold paillon. This is joined to a
thick gold plate, cut and crafted, then welded to a thin plate in order to be attached to the
leather of a belt by means of three gold rivets (Bienaimé 1993: 9). The cloisonné is made
up of a hexagon of radiating garnets set on gold paillon.
A gold “wreath” with a locking mechanism, decorated with three rows of ocelles
weighing 84g, was discovered (Bienaimé 1993:9).
The blade of the sword (remaining 873mm) is double-edged and made of three bands
welded together in a ‘damask’ style (i.e. looking like a cloth pattern). It is thin (3mm),
wide (estimated at max. 68mm) and has characteristics of work of the haute epoque,
suggesting to Bienaimé (1993: 7) that it is an isolated piece. The pommel is an elongated
iron plate whose upper surface is inlaid with four garnets: two circular and two ogival,
crimped on embossed gold and set with garnets. The grip of the sword, made of a gold
foil, is rolled and welded as a pipe with five raised ridges that run transversely to its long
axis. The only remaining element of the guard is a perforated silver plate in the shape of
an elongated oval. The guard itself was likely made of wood, 6mm thick. Four silver nails
remain in place on the plate that functioned to keep the guard in place. The entry point of
the corresponding sheath/scabbard (characterized by Bienaimé as a remarkable piece of
work) consists of two components in an elongated oval section: a sort of cloisonné box
intended for display with a welded gold plate on each end that shows the posterior
section. The casing has transverse partitions in which rectangular garnets are set on
embossed gold. The base is decorated with filigree. The back plate, welded to the casing,
is decorated with narrow bands of gold arranged like the rungs of a ladder by a seamless
alloy (Bienaimé 1993: 7). A simple silver chape (incomplete) represents a classic channel
whose remaining end has a frieze of transverse grooves and traces of gilding. Two
identical suspension loops are present that are different from other parts of the gold
cloisonné work. Built in partially gilded cast silver they are large, rectangular, and square
topped with silver tabs that extend the basic rectangular element at each end. The
underside of these suspension loops have indentations made for the passage of a belt.
Twelve garnets are set on embossed gold.



169
The blade of the scramasax is long and narrow (with dimensions of 602mm and max.
30mm). At the bottom of the grip, and forming the guard, is a casing with grid-like
ornamentation. The pommel is in the shape of a heart with cloisonné decorations joined
by welding, with garnets set on joined paillon (Bienaimé 1993: 7). The entry point of the
corresponding sheath, an element of rectangular cloisonné, has a row of rectangular
partitions (the base forming triangular patterns) wherein garnets are set onto paillons with
the rear as a welded gold band. The chape is in the form of a thin rectangular cloisonné
plate, also with rectangular garnets. Its opening is close to the side where the edge of the
scramasax sits in the sheath (Bienaimé 1993: 7).
APPENDIX D
A more detailed physical description of objects found in the burial at Pietroasa as they
appear in Chapter 4.4. Descriptions are sourced from Harhoiu 1977.
Plate with a broad everted rim and foot-ring, decorated using the au repoussé
technique with the rim decorated in simple geometrical patterns in relief with ‘zig-zag’
lines bordered by two rows of semi-spherical dots (Harhoiu 1977:70).
A tall ovoid oenochoe (jug) measuring 36cm (Harhoiu 1977: 7). The various decorative
elements on the vessel (featuring the opus interrasile and au repoussé techniques)
represent stylized birds, bird-heads, and acanthus-leaves and are arranged in zones. The
middle zone is decorated with parallel ‘wavy’ flutings while other zones are engraved
(Harhoiu 1977: 8).
A patera, showing very little damage, is 7.5cm high with a diameter of 25.7cm. A
statuette (rising about 3.7cm) rises in the centre of the dish that features a seated woman
modelled in ronde-bosse (Harhoiu 1977: 9). The decorative elements, mostly in the au
repoussé style include vine stalks with leaves and grapes, and rows of human figures.
Two multi-angular cups: an octagonal cup measuring 10.5cm, and a twelve-sided cup
11cm high. Both cups feature similar design elements: handles in the shape of panthers
with two rows of panels (representing the side of the first cup) with the upper part of the
handles consisting of rosettes set with garnets (Harhoiu 1977: 11). The lip and the edge of
the base of the octagonal cup are doubled with gold bands.



170
The first collar (a plain collar) measuring 17cm in diameter, was made of a large gold
band with a loop and hook for fastening.
The second collar (with an inscription) is made of a band thicker (1.2cm) in the middle
than at the terminals, and strengthened by twisted wire. This collar also has a loop and
hook for fastening.
The third collar (consisting of two unequal parts – 20cm and 15cm – joined with
hinges) has a pattern of decoration consisting of overlapping hears and stylized flowers
and leaves. The upper part of this collar also features garnets.
The small fibula consists of three distinct parts: a disc-shaped central section, a lyre
shaped plate at the end, and a foot-shaped like a stylized bird. The catch system is
identical to the “crossbow” fibulae from the late Roman and Roman-Byzantine period
(Harhoiu 1977: 14). The decorative elements of this fibula include recesses filled with
rock-crystals, plates in the shape of wings, garnets, chains with ovoid pendants,
geometrical figures, and gold wire (Harhoiu 1977: 14-15).
The medium fibula consists of the same three discount parts. This fibula is set with rows
of flat garnets in the shape of leaves, hearts, and circles that enclose a stone placed in the
centre (Harhoiu 1977: 15). Each stone is engraved with concentric circles.
The large fibula is shaped like a bird and is made of thick gold plate that Harhoiu (1977:
17) argues is bent to permit the ornament to be worn on the shoulder. This fibula also
contains heart designs and garnets; however, unlike the small and middle-sized fibulae,
Harhoiu (1977: 17) argues that this piece is without parallels.
APPENDIX E
A more detailed physical description of objects found in the burial at Budapest-Zugló as
they appear in Chapter 4.5. Descriptions are sourced from Nagy, 2010.
The artefacts associated with the human skeleton:
An iron buckle was found by the pelvis of the individual. The loop is flat with a slight
curve in the middle and is decorated with round glass plates set into gold cells. The sides
of these were lined with a gold foil that was bent into a cylindrical shape (Nagy 2010:



171
165). Two pairs of round settings lined with gold foil are present on the iron rings and the
base of the buckle tongue (Nagy 2010: 143).
Another, smaller, oval iron buckle was found on the inner side of the left thigh of the
individual.
Six garnet-encrusted gold mounts with perforated corners were found between the
legs of the individual, all arranged in a row down to the knees. One of these rectangular
mounts was decorated with pressed bead-row motifs and another was set with oval
cabochon garnet. Several of these mounts had design elements of various geometric
shapes (oval, rectangle, semi-circle, diamond, and triangle).
The artefacts associated with the horse remains:
An iron bit was present that was folded into before its deposition, causing it to oxidize in
that position.
A fragment of a ribbed iron bar with a round section covered in gold foil (along a
1.5cm section) was found and suggested to be part of a side-bar from another bit.
A diamond-shaped bronze pendant covered with gold foil was all found. Two sections
of the pendant are held together with a bronze rivet.
An iron bell was constructed from metal sheets.
A bronze bell was constructed from metal sheets.
APPENDIX F
The Mechanics of the Bow, cited from Kooi (1981; 1991; 1993; 1994); Kooi and
Sparenberg (1980); Tuijn and Kooi (1992); Kooi and Bergman (1997).
The bow proper consists of two elastic limbs separated by a rigid middle part called
the grip. The bow is braced by fastening a string between both ends of the limbs and an
arrow is set on the string (Figure 14). The archer then pulls the bow from its braced
position into a full draw, completing the static action in which potential energy is stored
in the elastic parts of the bow. This potential energy, called ‘deformation energy,’ is



172
delivered by the human body and can be quickly released to loose the arrow. After the
archer takes aim the arrow is released. The force in the string (as light and inextensible as
possible) accelerates the arrow as the deformation energy converts to kinetic energy
(Kooi and Bergman 1997: 125; Kooi and Sparenberg 1980: 27). A portion of this kinetic
energy is transferred onto the arrow; the string is essential in this process of
transformation. The motion of the limbs, string, and arrow is mathematically described by
Newton’s law of motion. During this process the bow is held in place and the archer feels
a recoil force in the bow-hand. Although the force at the arrow decreases after its release,
the recoil force increases and becomes more than two times the weight of the bow. At a
certain moment this force becomes negative, which means that the archer has to pull
instead of push the bow at the end of the shooting process in order to keep the grip at its
place. After the arrow has left the string the bow returns to its braced position as a result
of damping (Kooi 1981: 120; 1991: 22; Kooi and Bergman 1997: 124,125).
When drawing a bow the force exerted by the archer on the string will generally
increase. Thus, to keep a bow in a fully drawn position, the maximum force (called the
draw-weight of the bow) must be exerted by the archer as he/she aims at the target (Kooi
and Sparenberg 1980: 27; Strickland and Hardy 2005: 6). It is important for the bow to
possess enough deformation energy at full draw because it is not possible for all this
energy, stored statically in the bow, to be transferred into kinetic energy. The
effectiveness of this transfer is dependent on the manner in which the kinetic energy of
the arms or limbs can be recovered (Kooi and Sparenberg 1980: 28, 34). There are two
factors which contribute to this loss of energy: the virtual mass of the limbs and the
internal and external damping. Small virtual mass generally means high efficiency,



173
causing a relatively high percentage of the energy in the limbs to transfer to the arrow
leaving less energy in the bow to produce kickback (Kooi 1993: 18).
