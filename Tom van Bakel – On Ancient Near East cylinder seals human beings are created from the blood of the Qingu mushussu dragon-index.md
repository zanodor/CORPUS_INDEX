# Index for Tom van Bakel – On Ancient Near East cylinder seals human beings are created from the blood of the Qingu mushussu dragon.pdf

On Ancient Near East cylinder seals human beings are created from the blood of the Qingu mušhuššu dragon and as a result these human beings are depicted as dragons too
So-called mušhuššu dragons are carved on many cylinder seals found in the Ancient Near East. Arrows and styluses are placed on some of these mythical animals. These arrows suggest a scene from the Enuma Elish in which Ea creates a human from the blood of the Qingu dragon. The styluses suggest another scene from the Enuma Elish: Ea imposed the service of the gods upon them, which is then inscribed on the Tablet of Destinies.
Incidentally, it was not uncommon at that time to present himself as a dragon, as King Lipit-Eštar did, who called himself a gaping dragon in one of his praise poems:
Praise Poem Lipit-Eštar
I am a gaping dragon, a source of great awe for the soldiers. I am like the Anzud bird, peering about in the heart of the mountains. I am a wild bull whom nobody dare oppose in its anger. I am a bison, sparkling with beautiful eyes, having a lapis-lazuli beard; I am ....... With my kind eyes and friendly mouth, I lift people's spirits. I have a most impressive figure, lavishly endowed with beauty. I have lips appropriate for all words. As I lift my arms, I have beautiful fingers. I am a very handsome young man, fine to admire.

In this short essay I am going to tell you a few things about these dragons, arrows and styluses and especially about the creation of mankind from the blood of Qingu.



Number 1
We'll start with the dragon and arrow depicted on the right of this imprint. To understand the meaning of the arrow, it must first be said that in Sumer a so-called 'Ti' sign, which looks like the above arrow, has a number of meanings:
In Sumer the word ‘Ti’ means ‘arrow’, ‘timber’, ’rib’ and it also means ‘life’. ‘Nin-ti is the Sumerian ‘she who makes life.’
Volker-Doormann.Slavery
So here we read that one of the meanings of the 'Ti' sign is 'life'. Nevertheless, on seals it suggests a complete scene described in the Enuma Elish:
They inflicted the penalty on him (Qingu) and severed his blood-vessels. From his blood he (Ea) created mankind.
Enuma Elish - The Babylonian Epic of Creation by Joshua J. Mark
So when this sign was placed on a dragon, it suggested that Ea had created a human being from the blood of the Qingu dragon, and as a result, this human being was also depicted as a dragon.



Number 2
On this imprint of a cylinder seal, an archer shoots an arrow at a so-called mušhuššu dragon. This archer is Ashur, who has taken over Indra's place, and the mušhuššu dragon is his enemy Qingu. Again, in the Enuma Elish we read that mankind is created from the blood of Qingu: in other words, the slain Qingu is reborn as a human being. This is symbolized by the arrow on the 'pedestal'. This pedestal is the blood of Qingu, and the arrow, which here means 'life', symbolizes that blood being brought back to life: then a man is created from it:
‘Qingu is the one who instigated warfare, Who made Tia-mat rebel and set battle in motion.’ They bound him, holding him before Ea, They inflicted the penalty on him and severed his blood-vessels. From his blood he (Ea) created mankind.
Enuma Elish - The Babylonian Epic of Creation by Joshua J. Mark
Incidentally, on this print we see two meanings of the 'Ti' sign: on the left it is an arrow that is shot at Qingu and on the right a decorated arrow symbolizes that the blood of Qingu is brought back to life.



Number 3
On this imprint we see another mušhuššu dragon and to the right of it is another 'Ti' sign suggesting that the blood of Qingu (the two lines below) is brought back to life: in this print a human being in the form of a young dragon emerges from this blood (see the next page).
On the far right is a so-called 'stylus'. With this piece of writing equipment cuneiform signs were formed in clay.
As it happens, Ea has taken over The Tablet of Destinies from Qingu:
He attached guide-ropes and put them in Ea's hands. [The Tablet] of Destinies which Qingu had taken and carried,
And Marduk has ordered him to administer all his decrees:
Let him, like me, be called 'Ea'. Let him control the sum of all my rites, Let him administer all my decrees.’
So, the wise Ea had to create mankind and had impose the service of the gods upon them:
After the wise Ea had created mankind And had imposed the service of the gods upon them
The stylus suggests that Ea then writes down man's destiny on The Tablet of Destinies. Nevertheless, in this print it is placed on Qingu’s blood, suggesting that this destiny is written in his blood.



Number 4
Tiamat Qingu human
This imprint shows three so-called mushhushshu (serpent-dragons). The first represents Tiamat, the second Qingu and the third a human. Marduk is depicted here as an archer who tramples Tiamat and shoots an arrow at Qiungu.
Once again, it is said in the Enuma Ekish that from the blood of Qingu mankind is created. Then Ea, the god of water, imposes on mankind the service of the gods.
Because humans were created from the blood of Qingu (the rising mushhusshu), they were also depicted as a mushhusshu. He just doesn't have wings while the gods Tiamat and Qingudie do.
So, a human, probably the owner of the seal, is thus depicted as a little mushhushshu. He carries an arrow on his back and a so-called stylus on his head. It will be clear that the arrow suggests that the seal owner was created from the blood of the slain Qingu, and the stylus suggests that Ea writes down on 'The Tablet of Destinies' the destiny of this man, namely to to serve gods.



Number 5
In this imprint, we see Qingu being killed. The fish man on the right is the water god Ea who creates a human from his blood. The stylus behind him suggests that on The Tablet of Destinies the water god writes down the destiny of this human.



Number 6
This imprint shows the same Qingu killing scene. From his blood a human being, who is depicted on the far right, is created.
This print features a decorated 'Ti' sign on a pedestal. This pedestal represents the blood of Qingu and the sign 'arrow/life' suggests that this blood has been brought back to life as a human being.
The stylus is centred on a little square suggesting that the destiny of this human: to serve the gods, is added to The Tablet of Destinies.



Number 7
This imprint features a mušhuššu dragon in the centre with an arrow and stylus on its back. It should now be understood that it represents the owner of the seal, who was created from the blood of the Qingu dragon and who is entrusted to serve the gods, which is written down on 'The Tablet of Destiny, by means of the stylus.
Again, it was not uncommon to portray or call oneself a dragon, as Šulgi has done in a number of praise poems:
A praise poem of Šulgi
I am the king, a wild bull of acknowledged strength, a lion with wide-open jaws! I am Šulgi, a wild bull of acknowledged strength, a lion with wide-open jaws! I am a great storm let loose from heaven, sending its splendour far and wide! I am good stock, with brindled body, engendered by a breed-bull! I am a king born from a cow, resting amid butter and milk! I am the calf of a thick-necked white cow, reared in the cow-pen! Dressed in a ...... royal robe and holding out a sceptre, I am perfect for ....... I am also the good shepherd who takes joy in justice, the scourge and stick of all evil! Strength of lions, hero of battle -- I have no rivals! Handsome of limb, ferocious lion, I am perfection in warfare! Grasping a lapis-lazuli mace and a battle-axe, with long fingers I sharpen a tin knife to untie knots. In the turbulent affray of battle, in the conflict, I shoot out my tongue, a mušḫuš darting out its tongue at the foreign lands, a dragon raging (?) at men.

Number 8
The seal owner Ashur
On this imprint, the seal owner faces Ashur, who has taken over the role of Marduk here. Between them are a 'Ti' sign and a stylus on a pedestal. This pedestal represents the blood of Qingu. The 'Ti' sign symbolizes that from the blood of Qingu the seal owner was created, and with the stylus suggests this seal owner has received his destiny from Ashur, which is written down on 'The Tablet of Destinies'.
I finish this short essay about dragons, arrows and styluses with a section from the Enuma Elish in which mankind is created from the blood of Qingu.
Tablet VI
Then Marduk heard the gods' speech He conceived a desire to accomplish clever things. He opened his mouth addressing Ea, He counsels that which he had pondered in his heart, ‘I will bring together blood to form bone, I will bring into being Lullû, whose name shall be 'man'. I will create Lullû—man On whom the toil of the gods will be laid that they may rest. I will skilfully alter the organization of the gods: Though they are honoured as one, they shall be divided into two.’



Ea answered, as he addressed a word to him, Expressing his comments on the resting of the gods, ‘Let one brother of theirs be given up. Let him perish that people may be fashioned. Let the great gods assemble And let the guilty one be given up that they may be confirmed.’ Marduk assembled the great gods, Using gracious direction as he gave his order, As he spoke the gods heeded him: The king addressed a word to the Anunnaki, ‘Your former oath was true indeed, (Now also) tell me the solemn truth: Who is the one who instigated warfare, Who made Tia-mat rebel, and set battle in motion? Let him who instigated warfare be given up That I may lay his punishment on him; but you sit and rest. The Igigi, the great gods, answered him, That is, Lugaldimmerankia, the counsellor of the gods, the lord, ‘Qingu is the one who instigated warfare, Who made Tia-mat rebel and set battle in motion.’ They bound him, holding him before Ea, They inflicted the penalty on him and severed his blood-vessels. From his blood he (Ea) created mankind, On whom he imposed the service of the gods, and set the gods free. After the wise Ea had created mankind And had imposed the service of the gods upon themThat task is beyond comprehension Nudimmud performed the creation with the skill of MardukKing Marduk divided the gods, All the Anunnaki into upper and lower groups. He assigned 300 in the heavens to guard the decrees of Anu And appointed them as a guard. Next he arranged the organization of the netherworld. In heaven and netherworld he stationed 600 gods. After he had arranged all the decrees, And had distributed incomes among the Anunnaki of heaven and netherworld,
