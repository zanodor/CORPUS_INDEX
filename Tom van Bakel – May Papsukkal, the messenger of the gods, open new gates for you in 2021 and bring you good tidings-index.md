Using the Mul.Apin and the Dendera Zodiac we can date the major agricultural developments in the Ancient Near East
Agricultural developments were extremely important in the Ancient Near East. They were so important that implements like 'The Seed-Plough' and 'The Harrow' were included in the ancient star compendium Mul.Apin. Besides that, ‘The Ard’, ‘The Hoe’ and ‘a woman holding a spike’ were depicted on the Dendera Zodiac.
We will see that from this we can find out when the agricultural implements were invented.
Greek ‘Perseus’ Babylonian ‘Plough’, ‘Seed-Funnel’ and bird
As you see, the Babylonians saw in the constellation Perseus, a ‘plough’, a ‘seed-funnel’, and a bird:
1 The Plough(GISH.APIN), d.Enlil, the lead star of the stars of d.Enlil. {Perseus} 2 The Wolf (UR.BAR.RA) , seed-funnel of the plough [Perseus] {The seed are the Pleiades}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Number 1
On the left is the same 'seed-plough' and 'bird' and on the right is an imprint of a cylinder seal that shows a striking number of similarities.
This bird is an eagle. It is pictured here because when at that time the sun passed through Aquila (Eagle) the fields were ploughed and sown. To put it plainly, this ploughing and sowing was certainly not done in Taurus, on the contrary, when at that time the sun passed through this constellation the harvest began.



Number 2
In this imprint a seed-plough and a leopard are depicted at the top.
When we reverse the image of the seed-plough and leopard then we see the similarities with the constellations at the left. So, instead of a bird, a leopard is visualized here, because at that time ploughing and sowing was also done in the constellation ‘The Leopard’:
28 The Leopard (UD.KA.DUCH.A), d.U.GUR UD.KA.DUCHA.A has its ‘head of the Milky Way’ at Cygnus and the tail at Cepheus
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Inanna is related to this predator as she is called ‘a leopard among the Anuna gods’:
A hymn to Inanna
The mistress, a leopard among the Anuna gods, full of pride, has been given authority. Not having ...... struggle ......, Inanna ....... She ...... the adolescent girl in her chamber, receiving her, ...... heart ...... charms. She evilly ...... the woman she rejects. In the entire (?) country she ....... She lets her run around in the town square ....... ...... of a house the wife sees her child.
And believe it or not, she is described as ‘a breaking plough opening hard ground’:
A hymn to Inanna
Her howling is like Iškur's and makes the flesh of all the lands tremble. No one can oppose her murderous battle -- who rivals her? No one can look at her fierce fighting, the speeding carnage. Engulfing (?) water, raging, sweeping over the earth, she leaves nothing behind. The mistress, a breaking plough opening hard ground, ....... The braggarts do not lift their necks, ....... Her great heart performs her bidding, the mistress who alone fashions (?) ....... Exalted in the assembly, she occupies the seat of honour, ...... to the right and left..
So the above imprint indicated that ploughing and sowing was done in ‘The Leopard’: at that time the sun passed through this constellation in December.



In the sky the seed-plough is situated above Taurus
In this sky map we can see that Perseus, so the Babylonian ‘Seed-Plough’, is situated above Taurus.
Number 3
And this imprint shows exactly the same: a plough is situated above a bull. This means that this picture looks a bit like a small sky map.



Number 4
This imprint demonstrates that the plough is linked to Taurus as well as to Pleiades (indicated by the seven drill holes at the top). This means that between 4320 to 2160 this plough was related to March/April, although in reality the farmers were ploughing and sowing in October, November and even in December:
Barley Sowing then took place in the autumn (largely in October–November). A prior estimate of the
quantity of grain that ought to be sown was carried out in order to ensure optimal production. The seeds and beasts of burden were prepared, and teams of labourers were formed. The ploughs were equipped with a seeder - a kind of funnel designed to leave the seed buried behind the plough as it turned the soil. The grain was planted at regular intervals of around 60–75 cm.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_Mesopotamia#Cereals
The point is, that in Sumer ploughs appear in pictographs around 3000 BC and seed-ploughs around 2300 BC:
In Eurasia, the Sumerians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in pictographs around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture#Origins
And at that time the sun went through Taurus in March/April.
Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160. Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0;
The Earth Chronicles Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Seven Books of The Earth Chronicles by Zecharia Sitchin
March/April was a very important period because then a new year began, and each new year the gods brought renewals to the world. Enki once was the presiding deity of March/April (see page 13) and with new year he renewed abundance and days of splendour:
An adab to Suen for Ibbi-Suen
An ...... favourable day ...... holy ....... He has a righteous crown, long-lasting divine powers and a royal sceptre. Enlil has decreed lordship for his beloved one, as his destiny, and has created with magnificent grandeur the qualities of a warrior. Enki, renewing abundance and days of splendour, ...... the Tigris and Euphrates in their wide flooding. Nintur, who causes human seed to propagate and brings living beings into existence, ...... cities and crowded places, all the numerous people together. Nanna, the ...... light, confirming the divine plans, new moon of eternal fame, light which goes towards the earth, has given authority (?) to my Ibbi-Suen.



Number 5
Ili-illat Enlil gives a plough to Ili-illat
In the myth ‘The debate between Hoe and Plough’ we read that the storm god Enlil fashioned the plough:
The debate between Hoe and Plough The Plough addressed the Hoe: ‘I am the Plough, fashioned by great strength, assembled by great hands, the mighty registrar of Father Enlil.’
The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
His son Ninĝirsu established for the people the plough together with some other implements:
The rulers of Lagaš
In order to dig canals, to clean the levees and ditches, to ...... the large arable tracts, to ...... all the cultivated fields, he (Ninĝirsu) established for the people the pickaxe, the spade, the earth basket, and the plough, which mean life for the Land. Then he turned his attention to making barley sprout. He made the people stand before the maiden, and they raised their heads day and night, at the appointed times. Before Ezina who makes the seeds grow, they prostrated themselves and she made them grow (?). Before (?) Ezina who makes the dappled barley grow, they ......
Again, every new year the world was renewed and about 4300 years ago, when the sun passed through Taurus at new year, one of the renewals was that Ninĝirsu established a seed-plough for the people. And that was the reason why this implement was seen in Perseus situated above ‘The Bull’ and not in a constellation above ‘The Leopard’ or ‘The Eagle’.
This plough was so important that according to the next text ‘kings took hold of its handles’ and a special festival is held for it, please note, in the harvest month, so in March/April:
The debate between Hoe and Plough I am mankind's faithful farmer. To perform my festival in the fields in the harvest month, the king slaughters cattle and sacrifices sheep, and he pours beer into a bowl. The king offers the gathered (?) libation. The ub and ala drums resound. The king takes hold of my handles, and harnesses my oxen to the yoke. All the great high-ranking persons walk at my side. All the lands gaze at me in great admiration. The people watch me in joy.’



The Ard
https://www.archaeologs.com/i/137/ard?gobacklng=en
But, before the seed-plough appeared in agriculture, there was a so-called Ard, an ancient light plough:
Ard
An ancient light plough with a simple blade that was used to scratch the surface of the soil rather than turn furrows. It was drawn by animals or man and grooved the ground, but it had no mold board or colter and therefore did not turn over the soil. With this type of plough cross-ploughing was usually necessary, with a second ploughing at right angles to the first.
https://www.archaeologs.com/i/137/ard?gobacklng=en
It first appeared in the mid-Neolithic:
Evidence of its use in prehistory is sometimes found at archaeological sites where the long, shallow scratches (Ard marks) it makes can be seen cutting into the subsoil. The Ard first appears in the mid-Neolithic and is closely related to the domestication of cattle. It probably spread with animal traction in general across the cereal-growing cultures of the Neolithic Old World. Its exact point of origin is unknown, but it spread quickly throughout West Asia, South Asia and Europe in the late Neolithic and early Chalcolithic.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ard_(plough)
So around 7.250 BC
The Neolithic is characterized by fixed human settlements and the invention of agriculture from circa 10,000 BCE. Reconstruction of Pre-Pottery Neolithic B housing in Aşıklı Höyük, modern Turkey. Period Final period of Stone Age Dates 10,000–4,500 BC

https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010028871
Even this simple implement was so important that it was depicted on the Dendera Zodiac. It is situated near Cancer. Again, this does not imply that in this constellation the farmers ploughed with it, but this only shows that in 'The Age of Cancer', so between 8640 to 6480 BC the gods gave this Ard to mankind with new year:
Lion (Leo) 10760 to 8640,
Crab (Cancer), 8640 to 6480; Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160. Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0;
The Earth Chronicles Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Seven Books of The Earth Chronicles
So, as ‘The Ard’ is a constellation it is obvious that it was regarded as one of the divine innovations that the gods gave to the people around 7.250 BC, so between 8640 to 6480 BC when the sun passed through Cancer at new year.
Number 6
And this imprint shows two farmers ploughing with an Ard and a bull. Here we also see the seven drill-holes representing Pleiades and a bird representing ‘The Swan’.



https://collections.louvre.fr/en/ark:/53355/cl010028871 Number 7
There are more constellations that are related to agriculture, such as Virgo who holds a spike in her hand. From 12960 to 10800 BC the sun went through this constellation in March/April.
Scales 15120 to 12960 B.C. Virgo 12960 to 10800 B.C. Lion 10800 to 8640 BC,
The Earth Chronicles Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Seven Books of The Earth Chronicles by Zecharia Sitchin
As said before, in March/April the farmers started harvesting, and thus, in those 2160 years Virgo was a grain constellation, which of course is symbolized by the spike in her hand. There even could be a kind of Akitu, a harvest festival celebrated in spring:
Akitu (or Akītum; Sumerian ezen á-ki-tum, akiti-šekinku (á-ki-ti-še-gur10-ku5) ‘cutting of barley’, akiti-šununum ‘sowing of barley’, Babylonian akitu, also rêš-šattim ‘head of the year’) was a spring festival in ancient Mesopotamia.
The name is from the Sumerian for ‘barley’, originally marking two festivals celebrating the beginning of each of the two half-years of the Sumerian calendar, marking the sowing of barley in autumn and the cutting of barley in spring. In Babylonian religion it came to be dedicated to Marduk's victory over Tiamat.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akitu
This meant that Inanna, who was the presiding deity of Virgo, was a grain goddess from 12960 to 10800. And now we can understand why she is colourful as a pile of grain:
A song of Inanna and Dumuzid
Maiden, glossy mane, lovely beauty, Inanna, glossy mane, lovely beauty! Maiden, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer, Inanna, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer! Maiden,
colourful as a pile of grain, fit for the king, Inanna, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for Dumuzid! Maiden, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness, Inanna, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness!



Dendera Zodiac Louvre Number 8
‘The Harrow’ is another implement that is mentioned in the Mul.Apin:
23 The star to its side: The Harrow (GISH).GAN.UR, the weapon of d.A.E - in which one sees the Apsu {The First star of Libra. The Apsu, Sumerian AB.ZU ‘hole’ is the ‘entry’ to the underworld at the first star of Libra.}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
It is the first star of Libra and on the Dendera Zodiac a damaged bull-man, standing between the constellations Libra and Virgo, may hold this ‘Harrow’. Beneath him another bull-man carries a Hoe. In 12960 BC the sun moved between Virgo and Libra in March/April. At that time the Natufian culture began cultivating grain:
The Natufian culture (/nəˈtuːfiən/) is a Late Epipaleolithic archaeological culture of the Levant, dating to around 15,000 to 11,500 years ago. The culture was unusual in that it supported a sedentary or semi-sedentary population even before the introduction of agriculture. The Natufian communities may be the ancestors of the builders of the first Neolithic settlements of the region, which may have been the earliest in the world. Some evidence suggests deliberate cultivation of cereals, specifically rye, by the Natufian culture, at Tell Abu Hureyra, the site of earliest evidence of agriculture in the world. The world's oldest evidence of bread-making has been found at Shubayqa 1, a 14,500-year-old site in Jordan's north-eastern desert. In addition, the oldest known evidence of beer, dating to approximately 13,000 BP, was found at the Raqefet Cave in Mount Carmel near Haifa in Israel.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natufian_culture
So, this Natufian culture started around 13000 BC which of course coincides with the year 12960 BC when the sun moved between Virgo and Libra with new year.
Scales 15120 to 12960 B.C. Virgo 12960 to 10800 B.C.
The Earth Chronicles Handbook: A Comprehensive Guide to the Seven Books of The Earth Chronicles
So, the two bull-men with their implements indicated that at that time the Natufian culture began cultivating grain. As they were constellations it was clear that they were regarded as one of the divine renewals that the gods gave to mankind around 12960 BC, when the sun moved between Vulva and Libra with new year. By the way, the meaning of a Hoe cannot be overstated, in ‘The song of the hoe’ this implement appears to be a living identity who becomes a king, as the lord placed a holy crown on his head:
The song of the hoe
The lord evaluated the hoe (al), determined its future destiny and placed a holy crown on its head



Number 9
In this imprint Anu, the god of heaven, gives a harrow to the seal owner who is standing at the left.
Number 10
But in this imprint the harrow is a constellation:
23 The star to its side: The Harrow (GISH).GAN.UR, the weapon of d.A.E - in which one sees the Apsu {The First star of Libra. The Apsu, Sumerian AB.ZU ‘hole’ is the ‘entry’ to the underworld at the first star of Libra.}
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
It is just one of the many constellations depicted in this imprint, like The Seed-plough, Taurus, Canis Major, Tammuz, (the presiding deity of Cancer), Leo, Crater, Ishtar, (the presiding deity of Virgo), Cancer, Aquila and Aquarius.
The small girl above the plough may be the grain goddess Ezina (which latterly means Grain) as the next text reads that winter ‘made grain abundant in the furrows. He made Ezina appear radiant as a beautiful maiden’:
The debate between Winter and Summer
Winter made the ewe give birth to the lamb, he gave the kid to the goat. He made cows teem together with their calves, he provided butter and milk. On the high plain he made the deer and stag glad of heart. He made the birds of heaven set their nests in the broad spaces. The fish of the lagoons laid eggs in the reedbed. In all the orchards he made honey and wine drip (?) to the ground. He made the trees, wherever planted, bear fruit. He established gardens and provided plants. He made grain abundant in the furrows. He made Ezina appear radiant as a beautiful maiden. The harvest, the great festival of Enlil, rose heavenward.



https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150722144709.htm
It's amazing, but there appears to be a much older farming culture, as it turns out that the trial plant cultivation started much, much earlier, namely about 23000 years ago:
Until now, researchers believed farming was ‘invented’ some 12,000 years ago in the Cradle of Civilization -- Iraq, the Levant, parts of Turkey and Iran -- an area that was home to some of the earliest known human civilizations. A new discovery by an international collaboration of researchers from Tel Aviv University, Harvard University, Bar-Ilan University, and the University of Haifa offers the first evidence that trial plant cultivation began far earlier -- some 23,000 years ago.
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150722144709.htm
This would have happened in Ohala:
Although weeds are considered a threat or nuisance in farming, their presence at the site of the Ohalo II people's camp revealed the earliest signs of trial plant cultivation -- some 11 millennia earlier than conventional ideas about the onset of agriculture.
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150722144709.htm
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/07/150722144709.htm
A prehistoric settlement on the sea of Galilee.



It is dated to around 23000 BP:
Ohalo II is an archaeological site in Israel, near Kinneret, on the southwest shore of the Sea of Galilee. It is one of the best preserved hunter-gatherer archaeological sites of the Last Glacial Maximum, radiocarbon dated to around 23,000 BP (calibrated). It is at the junction of the Upper Paleolithic and the Epipaleolithic, and has been attributed to both periods. The site is significant for two findings which are the world's oldest: the earliest brushwood dwellings and evidence for the earliest small-scale plant cultivation, some 11,000 years before the onset of agriculture. The numerous fruit and cereal grain remains preserved in anaerobic conditions under silt and water are also exceedingly rare due to their general quick decomposition.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohalo_II
There was something like agriculture as a ‘hut yielded over 90,000 seeds’. These ‘seeds account for more than 100 species of wild barley and fruits’:
Archeologists have conducted an exhaustive study of Hut 1 at Ohalo II; this hut yielded over 90,000 seeds. The seeds account for more than 100 species of wild barley and fruits. Such a high
concentration of seeds in the hut makes it highly unlikely that they were accidentally deposited into the hut via natural forces such as wind. In addition, statistical analysis demonstrates that the concentration of plant matter was significantly higher around the walls than the center. Had the seeds been deposited by the collapsed roof, they would have evenly scattered on the ground. Furthermore, just 13 species of fruit and cereal make up about half of the total number of seeds found in the area; these include brome grains (Bromus pseudobrachystachys), wild barley (Hordeum spontaneum) and millet grass grains (Piptatherum holciforme), just to name a few. This suggests a marked preference of certain species of edible plants. A seed of particular interest comes from the Rubus fruit, which was fragile, difficult to transport, and preferably eaten immediately after collection. The presence of Rubus seeds at the Ohalo II site could indicate that the seeds were dried in the sun or by the fire for storage: early evidence for advanced planning of plant food consumption. Most importantly, the extremely high concentration of seeds clustering around the grinding stone in the northern wall of Hut 1 led archeologist Ehud Weiss to believe that humans at Ohalo II processed the grain before consumption.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohalo_II
A 2015 study reported that its ‘findings represent the earliest indications for the presence of proto-weeds in a site predating the Neolithic plant domestication by some 11,000 years:
A 2015 study reported that its ‘findings represent the earliest indications for the presence of protoweeds in a site predating the Neolithic plant domestication by some 11,000 years. This study shows for the first time that proto-weeds grew in the vicinity of human camps and most probably also in small-scale, cultivated plots.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohalo_II
The exact spatial distribution of the seed around a grinding stone further indicates extensive preparation:
The exact spatial distribution of the seed around a grinding stone further indicates extensive
preparation. The seeds were scattered in a U-shape around the grinding stone, Weiss hypothesized that a woman was squatting at the open end of the U, and actively distributing the seeds all around her while grinding.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohalo_II



From 21600 to 19440 B.C. the sun passed through Capricorn in March/April when a new year began and grain was harvested in the settlement Ohala. This grain was sown in Virgo, because at that time the sun passed through this constellation in November/December. Seeing this we can understand why Virgo is called ‘Seed-Furrow’ in Babylon:
9 The Seed-Furrow AB.SIN 35 Virgo
http://www.oocities.org/astrologymulapin/pathofthemoon.htm
Again, this constellation is linked to Inanna who is related to fields and grain a few times:
A balbale to Inana as Nanaya
‘My resting against the wall is one lamb. My bending over is one and a half giĝ. Do not dig a canal, let me be your canal. Do not plough a field, let me be your field. Farmer, do not search for a wet place, my precious sweet, let this be your wet place. ......, let this be your furrow. ......,’
A balbale to Inana
May you be ...... a bending reed, may you be barley in the furrows, a beautiful ......, may you be Ezina, who beautifies ......, may you be a nursing mother of the womb, may you be your mother's ......, a vine, my beloved, your personal god's ......, acting grandly!
All in all, it seemed to be plausible that from 21600 to 19440 B.C. grain was sowed in Virgo, and that may be the reason is why this constellation she was called ‘The Seed-Furrow’ in Babylon. But about 9.000 years later, between 12960 to 10800, she was a harvest constellation and that is why she was depicted with a spike in her hand.
So, it will be clear that in this essay I state that the implements mentioned in the Mul.Apin and depicted on the Dendera Zodiac indicated the developments of agriculture in the Very Ancient Near East.
o From 21600 to 19440 B.C. grain was sown in Virgo, called ‘The Seed-Furrow’ in Babylon. o In 12960 BC when the sun moved between Virgo and Libra in March/April, the hoe and the harrow were invented. o Around 7.250 BC when the sun passed through Cancer in March/April the Ard was invented. o And between 4320 to 2160 BC when the sun passed through Taurus in March/April the seed-plough was invented.

He was a messenger god in the Akkadian pantheon. He is known chiefly from late sources from the Seleudic period. His wife was Amasagnudi, and he acted as both messenger and gatekeeper for the rest of the pantheon. A sanctuary, the E-akkil is identified from the Mesopotamian site of Mkish.

Number 2 British Museum number134762 Description; procession led by a sphinx which paces towards the left. The sphinx has a lion's body and a bearded human head with its hair in a double bun. In the field above the sphinx are a small barrel-shaped object, a seed-plough, a bucket, and a small lioness (?) climbing up the yoke of the plough. Two bearded bird-men follow the sphinx. Both carry branches of vegetation in each hand and wear the divine head-dress. Last in the procession (though this depends on where the impression is cut) is the boat-god - a boat with its bows formed by a bearded god who wears his hair looped up at the back, holds a barbed ‘tuning-fork’ shaped object in his right hand and trails his left hand in the water. The stern of the boat is almost as high and ends in an animal's head. In the boat sits a bearded god with rays rising from his shoulders and each group of rays ends in a ball; he wears a fringed robe and holds a long paddle with a heart-shaped head in both hands. The water is not indicated by there are five cross-hatched fish in front of, and below, the boat. Between the boat and the sphinx is a round pot with a narrow neck; seal is worn around the edges and has been rubbed down over the bird-men.

It would not be a mistake to say that the cylinder seal VA 243 was first brought to attention of general public in 1976 when an American writer Zecharia Sitchin published his controversial novel The 12th Planet, where he asserted, among other things, that the seal contains a depiction of our Solar system. The cylinder seal is housed in the Vorderasiatisches collection in the Pergamon Museum, Berlin, under the inventory number VA 00243. The seal is made of serpentine and dates



back to the Akkadian period (ca. 2350 – 2150 BC). According to the museum’s brief description, the seal depicts an enthroned god with a plough in the raised hand and another god facing him, who introduces a worshiper carrying a lamb. Between the introducing god and the worshipper, in the top register, there is a star surrounded by globes of various sizes. The inscription on VA 243 reads: ‘Dubsiga (personal name), Ili-illat (name of the seal owner), your/his servant.’

Auf dem Rücken des Tieres ist ein Gestell montiert; über den beiden ein Sichelmond und ein achtstrahliger Stern. — Im unteren Bildfeld links ist ein Stier vor einen Pflug gespannt, der von einem bartlosen Mann im kurzen gefransten Schurz geführt wird; hinter ihm eine gleiche, jedoch bärtige Gestalt, die beide Hände erhoben hat [ergänzter Text von Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 150: Es handelt sich aber kaum um eine alltägliche und profane Verrichtung, wie der Gebetsgestus des Mannes zeigt, der dem Pflüger folgt. Das Gebet richtet sich wohl an die beiden Gottheiten, die im oberen Register zu sehen sind]; zwischen ihnen zwei Rauten; Randleiste. Diskussion: [Ergänzter Text von Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 150: Der achtstrahlige Stern hinter der Göttin legt nahe, in ihr Ischtar zu sehen. Der «gesattelte» Stier, der von einem Bediensteten gehalten wird, identifiziert den Gott als Hadad/Adad, den «Donnerer», der hier durch die Ähren als Spender der Fruchtbarkeit gekennzeichnet wird. (ergänzter Text von Keel/Staubli 2001: Nr. 69: Auf einem anderen neuassyrischen Siegel begrüsst Ischtar mit der Rahmentrommel den Wettergott als Sieger über die Chaosschlange.) Vögel erscheinen zwar gelegentlich im Zusammenhang von Pflügeszenen. Aber der recht deutlich als Taube charakterisierte Vogel scheint hier, wie auf altsyrischen Siegeln (vgl. Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 67-69) als Liebesbote zu amten. Die rituelle Begegnung von Gott und Göttin im Dienste der Fruchtbarkeit (vgl. Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 65-66) wurde nach neuen Erkenntnissen in Assyrien auch in der 1. Hälfte des 1. Jt. v. Chr. regelmäßig gefeiert (Nissinen 2001)].
