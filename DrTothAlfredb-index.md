1. Introduction
In the most recent Sumerian Grammar (Edzard 2003), Dietz Otto Edzard deals on less than one page with the possible relationship between Sumerian and other languages under the title “The (hopeless) question of the linguistic affiliation of Sumerian”, thus proving to be biased from the beginning. Superfluous to say that he does not even mention the very well known Sumerian-Hungarian language comparisons that started already in the 19th century (cf. Érdy 1974).
According to Edzard, there are two reasons, why “the problem is practically insoluble”: 1. “Sumerian must have separated from a hypothetical language family of which it was part in the middle or late fourth millennium B.C. at the latest. We know next to nothing about the sound and structure of Sumerian before the middle of the third millennium. Thus there is a gap of at least two thousand years between that time and the oldest reconstructible form of any languages which have been compared to Sumerian” (2003, p. 2). – Here is to say that the time difference between Vedic (testified since about 1500 B.C.) and Albanian (testified since about 1500 A.D.) is around 3000 years, thus one millennium more than between Sumerian and the oldest reconstructible form of an other language. Therefore, according to Edzard, it would not have been possible to prove that both Vedic and Albanian belong to the Indo-European language family. However, this is internationally accepted by all linguists.
Edzard’s other objection against the comparison of Sumerian and any other language is: 2. “Efforts to find cognates have been exclusively based on the sounds of individual words” (2003, p. 2.). – Here is to say that this is simply not true, because even the kling-klang etymologists always considered the semantic similarities between words, too. Moreover, the comparison of words – consisting of sounds and semantics – is exactly the method how the Indo-European language family has been established. But not enough with that: Proto-Indo-European is a reconstruction that never existed as a language, while Sumerian was once a living and not an artificial language. Moreover, there is to underline that the comparison of two non-artificial languages like Sumerian and Hungarian is methodically acceptable, while the comparison of a couple of languages with an artificial language like Proto-Indo-European is unscientific, because Proto-Indo-European was first reconstructed from the alleged Indo-European languages and then the affiliation of this languages to a hypothetical Indo-European language family was “proved” by comparing them to the reconstructed Proto-language – this is thus logically circular and methodically unacceptable.
In this contribution I show the linguistic relationship between Hungarian, Sumerian, and Egyptian. The method that I use is historical linguistics, but I will follow the same strategy that I have already established in EDH (Tóth 2007): There I took the Sumerian-Hungarian dictionary of Gostony (1975), revised it by correcting mistakes and updating this standard work to the newest results of Sumerology. The result were 1042 safe Sumerian-Hungarian cognates that I compared after with words of other languages that had been compared to Hungarian by other authors already before. Therefore, I always compared at least the cognates of 3 and not only 2 languages with one another, hence excluding the danger of mistaken etymologies as much as it is possible in diachronic linguistics. Mathematically speaking, the fact that only two languages have 1042 common safe cognates excludes the chance, but the other fact that I was able to show remarkable numbers of cognates in 17 language families comprising several dozens of languages excludes any doubts of the genetic affiliations of the languages compared.
Hungarian and Egyptian were compared to one another relatively late – first by the Hungarian historian Tibor Baráth (Baráth 1968-74; Baráth 1973; Baráth 1988; Baráth s.a.), but according to Lajos Bíró, “Th. Glock 1916-ban azt írta, hogy a magyar nép az egyiptomi-főníciai kultúrkörből ered” (Bíró s.a.). In 1935/36, the Finn hobby-researcher Sigurd Wettenhovi-Aspa published his “capital work” about the alleged Fenno-Egyptian cultural origin of the whole Old World, claiming amongst other things that there is no Indo-European language family and trying to “prove” his theory by giving such “word

equations” like English (!) pyramid = Finn pyhät raamit “holy frame”. By another “equation”: Bonaparte = Finn Punaparta = “Redbeard” he proved that he is unable to differentiate between nouns and names, that he does not know that certain words are borrowings and that he does not know Latin. That he did not even know the parts of speech, he proved with his “equations” German “der (masc. article)” (English “the”) = Finn terä = phallus, penis, and German “die (fem. article)” = Finn tissi = “tits, bosom”. Attempts like this damaged the comparison of any member of the so-called Finno-Ugric language family – and thus traditionally also Hungarian – with Egyptian enormously.
It was only by chance that I learned in the fall of 2006 about a to me hitherto unknown publication by the Finn linguist Helmi Poukka: “Unkarin ja Egyptin sanojen vertailua” (Poukka 1979). My extensive researches showed that this booklet is only in one library of the world – according to “WorldCat”: in Kent State University Library in the U.S. But since American copyright law did not allow me to get a copy of this book and since the rules of this University Library did not allow me either to borrow this book, because it is a typewriter manuscript (that was given to Kent by István Erdély), I had no chance to use it for EDH (Tóth 2007). That I finally got a photocopy of this booklet, that contains 9461 common Egyptian-Hungarian etymologies, I owe to the generosity of PD Dr. Johannes Reckel of Göttingen University. Since the American copyright law does not apply for borrowings outside of the US, Dr. Reckel was able to get a copy of Poukka’s remarkable work and could send it to me – back to the US.
Poukka follows the transcription of Erman and Grapow (1961). For technical reasons, I had to replace h with a dot underneath by ħ and h with a semicircle underneath by h, the one example where dotted w appears, I had to use underlining.
1 The numbering of the cognates in Poukka’s works jumps from no. 845 to 946, thus the nos. 946ss. should be read as 846ss., so that the booklet does not contain 1046 cognates, as indicated, but “only” 946. This fact is taken into consideration in our present study.

3. Conclusions
Egyptian shares 382 of the 1042 Sumerian-Hungarian cognates of Gostony (1975) and Tóth (2007, chapter 5), respectively, thus 36.7%. Therefore, Egyptian stands from its genetical affilitation to Sumerian-Hungarian between Hungarian and the Munda languages (33%) and Hungarian and the Dravida languages (36%), cf. Tóth (2007, chapter 18). But Egyptian shares also 33% with the common Hungarian-Etruscan cognates (Tóth 2007, chapter 9), that are, however, not won by using Gostony’s list, since because of the fragmentary character of Etruscan, the correspondences of most Etruscan words are neither known in Hungarian nor in Sumerian. But the same percentage of SumerianHungarian cognates both in Egyptian and in Etruscan confirmes the hypothesis of Glock (1916, ap. Bíró, s.a.), Padányi (1963, pp. 167ss.) and Baráth (1968-74) that Hungarian, Egyptian and Etruscan are genetically strongly related to one another and that Sumerian-Hungarian was definitively the most influenceful language in the Mediterranean area.
Since Egyptian is a member of the Hamito-Semitic or Afro-Asiatic languages, and since Hungarian and the Bantu languages share only 8% of their cognates (Tóth 2007, chapter 8), in Egyptian there must be the Asiatic and not the African part of this language family that is genetically related to SumerianHungarian. Since this Asiatic part in Egyptian is Semitic, is it a desideratum for the future to compare Sumerian-Hungarian with the Semitic languages, most of all with its oldest testified member, Akkadian. First attempts – completely neglected by mainstream-researchers – were made by Kiss (1839), who compared Hungarian with Hebrew because at his time the cuneiform writing was not yet detected and thus Akkadian still unknown, and Giesswein (1887, 1888) who already considered the first results of the deciphering of Akkadian and also took Egyptian into consideration. The idea of comparing SumerianHungarian with Semitic languages like Akkadian results also from the simple fact that the Sumerians and the Akkadians were neighbors in the Euphrat-Tigris basin and influenced one another also linguistically strongly. Moreover, the Akkadians took their cuneiform writing from the Sumerians, and this writing goes back to the script found by Zsófia von Torma (1894) and Nicolae Vlassa (1963) in Tatárlaka/Tărtăria on the so-called Tartarian Tablets (cf. Tóth 2007, in press).
Our 382 Sumerian-Hungarian-Egyptian cognates share also 40% of the 946 Hungarian-Egyptian cognates found by Poukka (1979). The reason, why this percentage is not higher, is simply, because Poukka used mostly other Hungarian words than we did sticking to the corpus of Gostony (1975) and Tóth (2007, chapter 5) for the sake of making this present study compatible with EDH (Tóth 2007). If one would etymologize Poukka’s Hungarian corpus according to the Sumerian-Hungarian sound laws established by Gostony (1975), there could be no doubt, that the percentage of the genetical affiliation between Sumerian-Hungarian and Egyptian is much higher than 40%. This would confirm basically the following statement by Baráth (1968, vol. 1): “Az úgynevezett szumír és egyiptomi nyelv eredetileg uganyaz a nyelv”. But because of Baráth’s exaggeration (he was not a linguist), I can, however, not agree with his idea that Sumerian and Egyptian “were in fact the same” (Baráth, s.a., p. 1), and neither can I agree with his assumption of a forward-and-backward movement of the Sumerian-Hungarians: “It is also believed that [the language, A.T.] spread from Sumer toward the southern part of the country and later to the east all the way into the Mediterranen (...). After the Egyptian kingdom was firmyl established (1500 B.C.), it spread toward the great bend of the Euphrates river and Syria” (Baráth, s.a., p. 1). Baráth does obviously, although he was a historian, not know that the Pre-Sumerians originated in Transylvania and after having completed their wandering to Mesopotamia turned the Transylvanian Tordos culture (5500-5000 B.C.) into the Sumerian Uruk Warka IV (ca. 3500-3200 B.C.) and the Jemdet Nasr (ca. 3100-2900 B.C.) cultures that are basically identical (von Torma 1894, Vlassa 1963, Badiny 2001, Tóth 2007, in press).
But also generally speaking, languages – as the relatively recent language death theory teaches us – do not die out normally from one decade or century to the other (except in the case of epidemics or genocide, like in the case of Tasmanian).

Retoromance in the St. Gallen Rhine Valley took over 1400 years, and many words, expressions, even suprasegmental (phonetical) and syntactical phenomena of Retoromance are still to be found in the today wholly germanized area. Considering the fact, that Retoromance was and still is a rather unimportant language that did not have cultural impacts like f.ex. Sumerian and Akkadian did, we must conclude that the time of the death of this languages was either much later than hitherto assumed or that they went through a long period of transformation like e.g. Latin did in developing into the Romance languages. It is therefore impossible to believe what such an authority like Woolley (who was one of the excavators of Sumer) wrote about the Sumerians: “Their language, though fallen out of popular use, might long survive in religious texts to be studied by the curious and painfully understood by the aid of a dictionary; but the race had gone, exhausted by wars, sapped by decay, swamped by the more vigorous stock which had eaten the tree of their knowledge” (Woolley 1929, pp. 181ss.).
Woolley’s flowery way of speaking shows nothing but his bare incompetence about language decay as well as linguistics in general. According to mainstream-research, all old cultures (or, to speak with Oswald Spengler in his “Der Untergang des Abendlandes”/”The Decay of the West”: Alle Hochkulturen/All high-cultures) without exception disappeared suddenly without leaving back any linguistic or cultural traces. If there are doubtless common words in Sumerian, Akkadian, ..., and still living languages, then these are considered to be Wanderwörter. In a PhD dissertation of the University of Arizona, Tucson, a doctorand even listed amongst the reasons why the Aztec culture allegedly vanished so “suddenly” also the possibility that the Aztects my have taken away by an U.F.O. That the Sumerians were not taken away by U.F.O.’s and that the Sumerian language did not die out – neither long before Christ nor in later centuries – but went through a transformation into Hungarian and several dozens of other languages, was shown hopefully for once and ever in EDH and the present study. But the work is not yet finished.
