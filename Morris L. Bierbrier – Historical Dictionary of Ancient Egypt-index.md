Editor’s Foreword
ix
Historical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt was the first volume in the Historical Dictionaries of Ancient Civilizations and Historical Eras series, and now it is the first to be expanded and updated. This is quite fitting because while the Egyptian civilization is not the oldest, it is certainly the grandest. It stands out for the vast area it covered, the amazing span of its history, and the exceptional works of art and architecture it left behind. The Egyptian civilization is also one of the most topical of the ancient cultures, its achievements studied in classrooms around the globe, major events—or simulations thereof—conveyed in movies and operas, and its vestiges still visited by countless millions of people every year, whether in present-day Egypt or dozens of museums. There are indeed few who do not recognize the pyramids and the Sphinx, Luxor and the Valley of the Kings, and Tutankhamun and Cleopatra. This series of historical dictionaries, like the others, provides information on significant people, places, and events. In this second edition, both the old and new eras of achievement are presented. Entries provide information on ancient kings and queens, generals and workmen, as well as the archaeologists who brought these important figures to light and the sites that display them. The book also covers such broader subjects as art, language, and religion and aspects of architecture and historical periods. The volume is supported by a chronology of key events, an introduction that places the significant happenings in context, and appendixes containing a dynastic list and museums with Egyptian collections. The extensive bibliography, carefully structured by subject, leads the reader to additional authoritative sources. While this second edition resembles the first, it has been substantially expanded with many new entries and updated with the latest research. This second edition is written by Morris Leonard Bierbrier who, while providing numerous fine points of Egyptology, has fashioned a



book that can also be used by a broader public. The entries are informative yet concise, providing considerable insight into a field that interests generalists and specialists alike. To compile such a handy guide, Bierbrier drew on an impressive accumulation of knowledge and experience. He studied Egyptology at the University of Toronto and the University of Liverpool and joined the Department of Egyptian Antiquities of the British Museum in 1976, where he spent 25 years as assistant keeper until his retirement. He is also author of numerous articles and two books, The Late New Kingdom in Egypt: A Genealogical and Chronological Investigation and The Tomb-Builders of the Pharaohs. He is also editor of Who Was Who in Egyptology.

This second edition of Historical Dictionary of Ancient Egypt could not have been written without the assistance of Dr. Patricia Spencer, director of the Egypt Exploration Society; Christopher Naunton, deputy director of the Egypt Exploration Society; and the society’s staff, Andrew Bednarski, Karen Exell, Tracey Gargetta, Roo Mitcheson, and Alice Stevenson, whom I warmly thank for their encouragement and technical advice. No text of this nature is ever finite, as new discoveriesboth archaeological and intellectual—continue to advance and refine the history of ancient Egypt. The selection of topics and entries is my responsibility, but I have benefited from advice from the series editor, Jon Woronoff. This book could not have been completed without the assistance of my dear wife, Lydia Collins, who has advised and supported me throughout its production. It is a pleasure, once again, to dedicate this volume to her.






Reader’s Note
xiii
The pronunciation of ancient Egyptian is uncertain as vowels were not written down. Thus the names of Egyptian people and places have been interpreted in different ways by Egyptologists over the years. Some have preferred to use Greek versions of such royal names as Amenophis or Sethos, although Greek versions do not survive for all royal names, and some are obviously garbled. In this text, an Egyptian form is cited for most personal names, although it is not always possible to be completely consistent with well-known names like Ramesses. Place names are given the most commonly known form—Arabic, Greek, and rarely Egyptian. The names, order, and dates of the rulers of ancient Egypt are not fixed because of gaps in our knowledge. From the New Kingdom, there is a margin of error of about 25 years, but it may be greater in earlier periods. Some dynasties are contemporaneous, which adds to the confusion. New discoveries constantly refine our knowledge, but many problems remain. Names and terms printed in boldface in the dictionary section indicate that there is a corresponding entry for additional information.

Introduction
xxvii
Ancient Egypt owed its prosperity, wealth, and power to its geographic location along the banks and in the Delta formed by the river Nile. The annual floods of the Nile brought down rich silt from the interior that enriched the fertility of the soil and made food production dependable and plentiful. The agricultural region was protected in the east, west, and south by desert areas and in the north by the Mediterranean Sea, which tended to discourage but not necessarily prevent invasions. The desert areas were also rich in minerals and stone, which could be exploited as tools and building materials. The original inhabitants of Egypt appear to have belonged to the Hamito-Semitic group of peoples, along with the ancient Libyans and Berbers. The Egyptian language had affinities with both the ancient Hamitic and Semitic languages but was an autonomous linguistic branch. The Egyptians clearly differentiated themselves from their Semitic neighbors to the northeast, the Libyans to the west, and the Nubians to the south. They appear to have inhabited the Nile Valley from the earliest times and essentially remained a homogeneous group absorbing the intermittent flow of immigrants mainly from the northeast. Inhabitants of the Nile Valley can be identified from the Palaeolithic Period at various sites beginning in 200,000 BC as hunter-gatherers living off the land and using flint tools. During the Neolithic Period, farming communities developed, growing emmer wheat, barley, and flax. These groups also domesticated animals and made and used pottery. Such sites have been found at Merimda Beni Salama in the Delta and in the Fayum, but the earliest phase of the Predynastic Period is known as Badarian from the site of el-Badari in Middle Egypt (5000–4000 BC). The subsequent phases of the Predynastic Period take their name from Naqada in Upper Egypt. Naqada I (4000–3500 BC) witnessed the growth of settlement sites in Upper Egypt noted for its black-topped red



pottery. During the Naqada II Period (3500–3100 BC), the culture is attested as far north as the Delta at Minshat Abu Omar, although an apparently separate culture is attested at Maadi near modern Cairo. According to late Egyptian traditions, two kingdoms emerged during the late Predynastic Period: those of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt, which were merged to form the united kingdom of Egypt through the actions of the legendary king Menes. Modern historians have speculated that the historical king Narmer of Upper Egypt conquered Lower Egypt to unite the country, but the historical process was probably more complicated. A strong kingdom under Dynasty 0 emerged in the south, possibly based at Hierakonpolis, but those rulers were buried in mastaba tombs at Abydos. Little is known about developments in the north or even if the kingdom of Lower Egypt existed, but certainly by about 3100 BC, the country was unified under Dynasty 1. The union of Egypt is also alleged to have led to the founding of a new capital at Memphis; certainly the tombs of such officials as Hemaka in the nearby cemetery at Saqqara testify to the early importance of Memphis, although the rulers continued to the buried at Abydos. The tombs became increasingly elaborate with niched facades, and the royal tombs were surrounded by those of sacrificed retainers. Hieroglyphic writing appeared during the late Predynastic Period, as attested in the titulary of the rulers, who were identified with the sky god Horus. The writing became more complex, appearing on labels and surviving tomb inscriptions. During Dynasty 2, it appears that there were religious conflicts between the followers of the gods Seth and Horus, which apparently were resolved by Khasekhemwy. During his reign, the first bronze vessels and royal sculptures are attested. He was the last ruler to be buried at Abydos. Dynasty 3 marked a shift in royal policy. The rulers were now buried at Saqqara. The mastaba tomb and royal sacrifices were abandoned in favor of the newly developed step pyramid, a series of mastabas placed on top of one another using stone on a large scale. The step pyramid was allegedly conceived by the vizier Imhotep, minister of King Djoser. The complex of Djoser also includes other buildings and reliefs of the king undertaking ritual activities. The names of the rulers of Dynasty 3 are attested at the mines of the Wadi Maghara on the Sinai Peninsula. Dynasty 3 marked the first appearance of the sun god Re, who became the main god, displacing the sky god Horus.
xxviii • INTRODUCTION



Some scholars include Dynasty 3 in the Old Kingdom, and others begin the period with Dynasty 4. Dynasty 4 marked the high point of royal power and control during the Old Kingdom. The forces of the first ruler, Snefru, campaigned in Nubia, and Egypt entered into commercial relations with Byblos and the Levant. Expeditions penetrated to Buhen in Nubia, where a coppersmelting operation and supporting town site have been discovered, and stone from quarries near Abu Simbel was used for royal statuary. The most visible sign of royal power was the royal tombs at Meidum, Dahshur, and later Giza, where the true stone pyramid was constructed to contain the royal burial. Each pyramid was in fact an architectural complex consisting of the royal pyramid, to which was attached a mortuary temple linked by a causeway to a valley temple on the edge of the cultivation where the royal body was received prior to its burial. Smaller pyramids of the queens adjoined the main pyramid, which was surrounded by the mastaba tombs of the princes and courtiers of the reign. The royal court was unable to maintain the degree of economic control needed for the continual construction of stone pyramids in succeeding reigns, and only three were built. Dynasty 4 ended in some chaos, and future rulers were content to build pyramids with rubble case and only stone casing. The new rulers of Dynasty 5 enhanced the prestige of their patron deity, the sun god Re, who was elevated to the top of the pantheon and in one form absorbed the sky god Horus to appear as Re-Harakhty. New sun temples were built at Abusir, where most of the rulers chose to be buried. The earliest known written documents on papyrus, which are temple accounts, date to this period. Dynasty 6 maintained control over the entire country, but the minority and the long reign of Pepy II led to a loosening of central control. The dynasty apparently ended in confusion, and the central authority of the Old Kingdom collapsed, ushering in the First Intermediate Period. The term Intermediate Period is used to designate phases when the central government was weak or nonexistent and, partly as a consequence, written documentation is also less abundant. At the end of the Old Kingdom, the country was divided into warring factions whose leaders adopted the titularies of rulers. Dynasties 7 and 8 briefly maintained themselves at Memphis but were superseded by two main contenders for power: the princes of Herakleopolis (Dynasties 9 and 10)

and Thebes (Dynasty 11). Other provincial rulers, or nomarchs, increased their local power, backing one side or the other. The surviving monuments of the period demonstrate the growth of different provincial schools of art as opposed to the previous uniform school emanating from the royal court of Memphis. Around 2040 BC, Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11 finally overcame the forces of Herakleopolis and reunited Egypt to establish the Middle Kingdom. A new capital was established at Thebes, where the king built his funerary monument at Deir el-Bahri. Trade links were reopened with the south and the Levant. His dynasty did not endure for long and was replaced by Dynasty 12, inaugurated by the southerner Amenemhat I, probably the vizier of the last ruler of Dynasty 11. Amenemhat I proved a vigorous and inventive ruler. He strengthened Egypt’s defenses on the Sinai Peninsula by building fortifications to control the growing influx of Semitic peoples. He moved the capital to Itjtawy near the Fayum in the center of the country, and the region was further developed by his successors. Amenemhat I sought to ensure political stability by appointing his son, Senusret I, as his coregent. During his reign, the military occupation of Nubia began. His court also patronized writers who wrote favorably of the dynasty, and the literature of the Middle Kingdom became the classic reading of the Egyptian literate classes long after stories like the Tale of Sinuhe. This strong reign ended with the assassination of Amenemhat I in obscure circumstances, but Senusret I was able to secure the throne and continue his father’s policies. Expansion continued south into Nubia as far as Semna under Senusret I and Senusret III, and a series of fortifications were erected at strategic points to keep Nubia under control. The extent of Egyptian influence in the Levant is unclear. Trade links were maintained with coastal cities like Byblos. Egyptian couriers passed through Palestine, and the execration texts reveal an intimate knowledge of local rulers. Some texts report Egyptian military action in the Levant region. It is probable that Egypt maintained political influence in the area through diplomacy and the occasional military expedition. The period is distinguished by its fine and intricate craftsmanship, notably the production of jewelry, examples of which have been recovered from several royal tombs, including those of princesses Sithathoriunet and Nefruptah. Dynasty 12 appears to have died out in the male line with Amenemhat IV, who was briefly succeeded by his sister, Sobeknefru, the first

unequivocal female ruler. Her reign was brief, and the succeeding Dynasty 13 is considered by most Egyptologists to have begun the Second Intermediate Period. At first, the country remained stable and united, although there was a continuous succession of rulers who generally ruled for a very short period. However, the unity of Egypt began to dissolve with the creation of a contemporary Dynasty 14 at Xois. Egyptian forces withdrew from Nubia, where a strong native kingdom emerged based at Kerma. The country also faced an increasing influx of Asiatic settlers from the east, centering on the town of Avaris. Later Egyptian accounts infer a brutal invasion with much destruction. It is known that peaceful Asiatic settlement had continued throughout Dynasty 12 and Dynasty 13, but the final conquest of the north by the Asiatics or Hyksos may have been made under more violent circumstances. Certainly the Hyksos rulers of Dynasty 15 and Dynasty 16 adopted Egyptian styles of titulary and so must have had some Egyptian advisers at court. The Hyksos appeared to have controlled Lower Egypt and Middle Egypt, but Thebes remained independent under a series of rulers who also adopted royal titularies, although they may at one point have been obliged to become vassals of the Hyksos rulers in the north. It is clear that the Thebans and Egyptians as a whole resented the rule of this foreign dynasty, and as before, the rulers of Thebes led the resistance to the Hyksos and sought to oust them from Egypt. According to a fragmentary literary tale, the revolt against their rule appears to have been initiated by Tao of Dynasty 17 against the Hyksos ruler Apepi of Dynasty 15. Tao may have died in battle, but the struggle was carried on by his successor, Kamose, who besieged the Hyksos capital at Avaris and prevented a coalition between Hyksos and Nubian forces. He too appears to have failed, and it was left to his successor, Ahmose I, to capture Avaris around 1550 BC, expel the Hyksos forces from Egypt, and reunite Egypt under the control of his new Dynasty 18. The victorious Egyptians pursued their defeated foes into southern Palestine, and under successive monarchs, notably Thutmose III, they extended their domination of the Levant to the Euphrates River, attempting to forestall any future Asiatic resurgence. At the same time, Egyptian forces penetrated south of Elephantine (Aswan), destroying the Nubian kingdom based at Kerma and annexing much of Nubia as far south as Kurgus near the Fifth Cataract.

These further conquests brought wealth and prosperity back into Egypt. The rulers of Dynasty 18 embarked on important building projects, notably in the temple of Karnak at Thebes, whose god, Amun, was elevated to chief god of Egypt and identified with the sun god Re. The temples were also awarded large land grants and portable wealth to confirm their support of the dynasty. The royal family altered its burial customs, choosing the more secluded Valley of the Kings. The control of an empire and the southern gold mines made Egypt a superpower on the world stage. Direct contact was established with Greece, Asia Minor, and Babylon. Egyptian prestige reached its height during the reign of Amenhotep III, whose harem was filled with many foreign princesses, although his chief wife was an Egyptian commoner, Tiy. Religious discontent surfaced during the reign of Amenhotep III’s son, Akhenaten, who sought to suppress the cult of Amun in favor of his own patron deity, Aton, a form of the sun god Re. Although he tried to eliminate many of the old gods, as well as Amun, he was not a monotheist, denying neither his own divinity nor that of his father. In his new capital at Amarna, a distinctive new art style developed. Akhenaten also faced the growth of a new superpower in the Hittite empire, which annexed the Egyptian provinces of southern Syria. The failure of Akhenaten’s program led to a return to the old gods and the old capital under his eventual successor, Tutankhamun, who was apparently the last of the royal line. The final rulers of Dynasty 18 sought to restore Egypt’s position at home and abroad. This new militaristic approach was favored by the rulers of Dynasty 19, who came from a military background. The attempt to restore the former empire ended in failure around 1274 BC, when Ramesses II was defeated by the Hittites; however, he held on to his inherited borders and eventually reached a peaceful accommodation with his enemy, relinquishing claims on lost territory and in due course marrying Hittite princesses. He was able to undertake major building projects at Abu Simbel and other temples and at his new capital, Pi-Ramesses. Egypt had become a cosmopolitan country no longer immune to outside influences in language and customs and even accepting foreign deities, but the era of Ramesses II marked the beginning of the end of Egypt as a prosperous superpower. The successors of Ramesses II faced invasions from the west by the Libyans allied to the Sea Peoples, as well as a civil war leading to the

establishment of Dynasty 20. Ramesses III managed to fend off a further onslaught of the Sea Peoples, who had apparently destroyed the Hittite empire, but his successors gradually became impoverished and withdrew from all Egyptian possessions in the east and in Nubia. Another civil war led to the end of the New Kingdom and the beginning of the Third Intermediate Period. The Third Intermediate Period is marked by the fragmentation of authority within the country, notably the division between north and south. During Dynasty 21, the authority of the pharaoh situated in the north was only nominally recognized in Thebes under the control of the high priest of Amun. Sheshonq I, of Libyan extraction, attempted to restore the unity of Egypt by establishing his son as high priest, and he also sought to restore Egyptian prestige abroad by invading Palestine; however, the tendency of Dynasty 22 to install princes in key areas of Egypt led to disunity and constant civil war, with Dynasty 22 and Dynasty 23 vying for nominal authority amid other local princes, notably of Sais (Dynasty 24). Unity was only restored with the invasion and conquest of Egypt by the Nubian kings Piye and Shabaqo, who put an end to Dynasty 24 and reduced the local princes to vassals. The Nubian rule (Dynasty 25) in Egypt was brief, as a weakened Egypt faced new superpowers in the east who cast covetous eyes on the natural wealth and historic treasures of the country. A series of Assyrian invasions devastated the country, culminating in the expulsion of Dynasty 25; the sack of Thebes; and the installation of a puppet ruler, Psamtik I of Sais, in 663 BC. Psamtik I made use of his Assyrian master and later Greek mercenaries to eliminate all rival princes, and he won control of the south through the adoption of his daughter as God’s wife of Amun at Thebes. His Saite dynasty (Dynasty 26) represented a brief revival of Egypt’s prosperity and power. Artistic trends toward archaism and simplicity, which began during the Third Intermediate Period, continued. The hieratic written script gave way to the new, more abbreviated demotic, which also indicated a shift in the spoken language. The weakening of Assyria allowed Egypt to become virtually independent, and under Nekau II, the country was even able to intervene in an attempt to support Assyria, which failed, and vainly to try to restore Egyptian influence in the Levant in the face of the new threat from Babylon. Closer relations were initiated with Cyrene in North Africa, sealed through a

marriage alliance by Ahmose II, and with the Greek states leading to the designation of Naukratis as a Greek entrepôt in Egypt. Egypt, however, remained too weak to resist the onslaught of the Persian king Cambyses, who added the country to his Persian empire as a province ruled by a satrap of royal birth. The Persian conquest (Dynasty 27) was deeply resented, especially as the Persian authorities appear to have limited the funds available to the temples, many of which had suffered varying degrees damage during the invasion. There was a series of revolts aided and abetted by the Greeks, which eventually succeeded in expelling the Persians around 404 BC. The new rulers of Egypt, Dynasties 28, 29, and 30, were Delta dynasties recognized throughout Egypt whose principal aim was to prevent any new Persian incursion. The most prominent were the rulers Nakhtnebef and Nakhthorheb, who embarked on an ambitious building program on most of the temples of Egypt. This last native dynasty was deposed by the reinvading Persians in 343 BC, but their rule was brief as Egypt fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC. Alexander was welcomed by the Egyptians as a liberator. His sojourn in Egypt was short but significant. He visited the Siwa Oasis, where the oracle is alleged to have confirmed his divinity and made arrangements for the founding of Alexandria. Upon his death, Egypt was secured by his general, Ptolemy, who founded a new dynasty and secured Alexander’s body for burial at Alexandria. Unlike some of Alexander’s successors, Ptolemy did not aspire to recreate his empire but was content to rule Egypt and its dependencies. This did not mean that he refrained from expanding Egypt’s influence and control in Greece, Asia Minor, and especially Syria when possible, and the Ptolemaic dynasty became embroiled in frequent wars over Syrian territories with the Seleucid Empire, which weakened both powers. Egypt was ruled from the court at Alexandria, which was almost exclusively Greek. Native Egyptians did not fill the top administrative positions and had to learn the Greek language for advancement. Greek settlers, mostly veteran soldiers, were given land, notably in the Fayum area where agricultural land was increased by improved irrigation. Many settlers married local women, and a bilingual class arose that acted as an intermediary between the Greek rulers and the bulk of the Egyptian population. Greek settlers also benefited from tax privileges denied to the locals; however, the court patronized Egyptian temples

and sponsored building works to win the loyalty of the priestly class. This did not prevent occasional rebellion on the part of the Egyptians, especially in the south where the rulers Harwennefer and Ankhwennefer maintained their independence for a time. The Ptolemaic dynasty was severely weakened by civil war and the growth of Roman power in the Mediterranean. Ptolemy XII was forced to accede to Roman financial demands, leading to his expulsion and reinstatement by Roman force of arms. Cleopatra VII was also given power by Roman might but used her charms on Caesar and Marcus Antonius to expand Egyptian influence and restore its prestige in the Levant. Her partnership with Antonius was used by his enemies in Rome to blacken his reputation and inexorably led to a military clash with Roman forces under the future Augustus. His victory at Actium in 30 BC resulted in the conquest of Egypt and the suicides of Cleopatra and Antonius. The Roman conquest resulted in a change of government in Egypt. Egypt was regarded as the private property of the Roman emperor, ruled in his name by the prefect, and the source of cheap grain to keep the Roman populace happy. Few emperors visited Egypt after Augustus, most notably Hadrian. Roman senators were barred from entering the country without imperial permission. The Greek population in major citiesAlexandria, Naukratis, Ptolemais, and later Antinoopolis—were allowed to enjoy favored tax status, but the mixed Greek-Egyptian population of the provincial cities lost their special status, being regarded as equivalent to the native population, although prominent local citizens enjoyed some privileges. While the emperors occasionally endowed Egyptian temples, the Roman administration tended not to actively support ancient Egyptian institutions. The Egyptian language was no longer considered valid in the courts, where only Greek and Latin were recognized. As a result, written Egyptian in the form of demotic and residual hieroglyphic writing gradually died out in ordinary usage, although it was kept fitfully alive by the priesthood until the 5th century. The temples and the priests they supported grew steadily impoverished. The weakened pagan culture was unable to resist the spread of Christianity, which gained official recognition under Emperor Constantine. Egyptian Christianity was marked by a certain asceticism, which led individual hermits like Anthony to seek solace in isolated locations, but

soon under Pachomius the religion gave rise to settled monastic communities, which helped foster Christianity. Christians were intolerant of the pagan past—both Egyptian and Greek—and made destructive attacks on ancient temples and monuments, especially following the official suppression of paganism under the Emperor Theodosius I in 391–392 AD. Only the temple of Philae remained open because of its diplomatic importance in Egyptian–Nubian relations until the time of the Emperor Justinian, when it was closed in the 530s AD. Funeral customs also changed with the abandonment of mummification and substantial grave goods. A new form of written Egyptian emerged known as Coptic. The ancient language was written in Greek letters with the addition of seven new letters to represent specific Egyptian sounds. The spoken language had already been altered through the influx of Greek words into the vocabulary. It is thought that the Coptic alphabet may have been devised by the early Christians to translate religious texts, but it was also used for new religious compositions, biographical texts, letters, and administrative texts, notably in the new monastic communities. The development of Coptic proved to be of immense importance in the modern understanding of the ancient Egyptian language. The adoption of Christianity and the suppression of the ancient cults did not lead to stability in Egypt. The division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD meant that Egypt was now ruled from Constantinople and became part of the Byzantine Empire. Attempts by the emperor to impose an agreed uniform Christian creed foundered on the doctrinal differences between orthodoxy as understood by Rome and the tendency toward Monophysitism in the Coptic Church. Opposition to what the patriarchs at Alexandria, including Cyril and Dioscorus, saw as unorthodox doctrines gradually estranged the Egyptian church from the imperial court, which vainly sought a compromise and then increasingly opted to impose orthodoxy by force, leading to the foundation of a Coptic Church separate from the Orthodox Church. Religious dissension weakened Byzantine rule and led sections of the population to welcome the Arab conquest of 641–642 AD. The Arab conquest ultimately put an end to the last vestiges of the ancient Egyptian culture, in which the new rulers, like their Christian predecessors, had no interest. It was not their immediate intention to convert the entire population to Islam, as this would have drastically af

fected their new revenues from the poll tax on nonbelievers; however, later bouts of fanaticism and social and economic pressure led to the conversion of the bulk of the population to Islam. Islamicization led to the adoption of Arabic as the common language of the new administration, and its use also spread to the non-Muslim population so that Coptic had died out as a spoken language by the 15th century. It was preserved only in a few places in the Christian service, although even the speakers no longer knew the meaning of the words. Ancient sites, when not despoiled or destroyed, were gradually buried and forgotten. Memories of ancient Egypt survived only in the neglected works of classical authors in European monastic libraries. Very few Europeans visited Egypt during the medieval period apart from occasional pilgrims or merchants who brought back a few objects. The growth of learning during the Renaissance led to a rediscovery of classical antiquity and interest in the country. Coptic works, including Biblical translations, were acquired for Western libraries, and the language was soon deciphered, although it was not connected with ancient Egyptian. Haphazard excavations took place at Saqqara to supply mumiya, ground-up mummy dust prized for its alleged medicinal properties, during the course of which minor Egyptian antiquities were uncovered. More substantial pieces were found in Rome, where they had been imported during the period of Roman control. Minor pieces continued to arrive in Europe as a result of more intrepid travelers who penetrated further into Egypt during the 18th century. The major impetus to the study of ancient Egypt came with the invasion of the country by Napoleon in 1798 as part of a plan to cut off the British from India. Napoleon took with him a team of scholars who went about the country recording and collecting monuments. The expedition ended in failure, as the French were eventually forced to surrender to a combined Turkish–British force. The monuments that had been collected for shipment to Paris, including the Rosetta Stone, were awarded to the British by treaty and ended up in the British Museum. The French scholars returned with their papers and published the multivolume Description de l’Égypte, which made Egyptian sites and monuments known to a wider public. Peace in Europe in 1815 and a stable government in Egypt under Mohammed Ali allowed scholars, artists, and collectors to visit Egypt; record its monuments; and collect antiquities with the permission of the

Egyptian government. A major breakthrough was made by the decipherment of the hieroglyphic script by Jean-François Champollion using the Rosetta Stone and other bilingual monuments. His realization that the ancient Egyptian language was an earlier form of Coptic, which he already knew, greatly aided his work. His work was carried on by other scholars after his early death. The hieroglyphic, hieratic, and demotic scripts used by the ancient Egyptians can now be read, although grammatical and lexical difficulties still remain. The major European collections of Egyptian antiquities at the British Museum in London, England, the Louvre Museum in Paris, France, and the Museo Egizio in Turin, Italy, were formed during the first part of the 19th century mainly by purchase from collectors, notably those of the British and French consuls in Egypt, Henry Salt and Bernardino Drovetti, who used such agents as Giovanni Battista Belzoni to acquire objects either directly from the locals or from excavations. The Egyptian government approved the export of most antiquities, in which it took no interest, until in 1858 the efforts of Auguste Mariette persuaded the ruler to create an Egyptian Antiquities Service to supervise and approve all excavations and exports of antiquities and a Cairo museum, which opened in 1862, to display the best discoveries that were to remain in Egypt. Serious excavation began toward the end of the century with the creation of the French Institute of Archaeology in 1880 and the Egypt Exploration Fund (now the Egypt Exploration Society) in 1882. The method of excavation was revolutionized by the work of the British archaeologist Flinders Petrie, whose attention to detail and such small objects as pottery enabled archaeological levels to be more clearly dated. Important contributions were made during the first half of the 20th century by such American institutions as the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston under its excavator George Reisner. Under agreements at the time, the chief finds remained in Egypt, but a portion of the discoveries were awarded to institutions that financed excavations. The discovery of the tomb of Tutankhamun led to increased public awareness of ancient Egyptian history and archaeology. Apart from interruptions due to wars, excavation and study of ancient Egypt have continued unabated. Following the revolution of 1952, the sale and export of antiquities from Egypt were banned apart from divisions of du

plicate archaeological material with foreign archaeological missions. During the 1960s, a major international rescue campaign was undertaken to excavate sites in Nubia in danger of flooding by Lake Nasser, the lake created by the Aswan High Dam. More recently, excavation by the Egyptian Antiquities Service and foreign missions have shifted from desert sites to lesser known town sites, especially in the Delta region. Continual discovery of new material necessitates constant revision of ancient Egyptian chronology and history, which still have many problems awaiting solutions. The more material that is recovered, the more we learn how little we know of ancient Egypt despite the riches of its archaeological heritage.

ABDI-ASHIRTA (fl. 1350 BC). Ruler of Amurru. He was a vassal of the Egyptians in Syria. His career is known from the Amarna letters. Abdi-Ashirta embarked on a campaign of conquest against his neighbors with the help of the Habiru. Abdi-Ashirta argued that his acts were in Egypt’s best interest and protested his loyalty to the pharaoh. He was later arrested by the Egyptian authorities and possibly executed. His son, Aziru, succeeded him.
ABRAHAM (fl. 590–620). Abbot of the monastery of St. Phiobammon at Deir el-Bahri and Bishop of Armant. Son of Sabinus and Rebecca. He founded the monastery on the ruins of Queen Hatshepsut’s mortuary temple to replace an earlier monastery of St. Phoibammon in the nearby western desert, which had fallen in ruins. Abraham is known primarily from the many ostraca, some in his own hand, and papyri in both Greek and Coptic, which were excavated by Henri Edouard Naville at the monastic site. Both his will written in Greek and a portrait of him have survived. See also ANTHONY; COPTIC CHURCH; PACHOMIUS; SHENOUTE.
ABU MINA. A major pilgrimage site and town on the edge of the western Delta southwest of Alexandria built over the supposed burial place of the Christian martyr St. Menas. It was begun in the fourth century and consisted of a series of churches and buildings, including the Great Basilica, the largest church in Egypt. Abu Mina was destroyed by Persian invaders about 619 AD but was partially rebuilt and occupied until the 11th century. It was initially cleared in 1905–1907 and more recently has been excavated by a German



expedition since 1961. The site is the origin of the many St. Menas pottery flasks that contained holy water.
ABU ROASH. Modern name for the site of the funerary complex of Djedefre of Dynasty 4, which includes the remains of his pyramid and associated temples, as well as a major cemetery of the Early Dynastic Period and a pyramid of Dynasty 3. The site has been excavated by French expeditions since 1901, notably under Fernand Bisson de la Roque in 1922–1924 and Pierre Montet in 1937; a Dutch expedition in 1957–1959; and a joint French–Swiss team since 1995.
ABU SIMBEL. Modern name for the site in Nubia where Ramesses II erected two temples. The larger temple, with four colossal statues of the king on the facade, is dedicated to Amun-Re, Re-Harakhty, Ptah, and Ramesses II and is aligned so the rays of the rising sun illuminate the cult statues in the interior sanctuary twice a year. The smaller temple, with statues of the king and his queen, Nefertari, with their children on the front wall, is dedicated to the goddess Hathor. The site was rediscovered by Swiss explorer Johann Ludwig Burckhardt in 1813, and the main temple was entered in 1817 by Giovanni Battista Belzoni, who removed some of the statuary, now in the British Museum. The temples were disassembled and moved to a higher site nearby from 1964–1968, when the area was flooded in the wake of the construction of the new Aswan High Dam. See also AMADA; BEIT EL-WALI; GERF HUSSEIN; KALABSHA; SOLEB.
ABUSIR. Modern name for the area between Giza and Saqqara that served as the burial place for the kings and courtiers of Dynasty 5 and also the location of temples dedicated to the sun god Re. Four pyramids with their temples have been found here. The area was examined by a German expedition under Friedrich von Bissing and then under Ludwig Borchardt in 1898–1913, followed by a Swiss expedition in 1954–1957, and it has been excavated by a Czech expedition since the 1960s.

ABYDOS. Greek name for the sacred city of Abdju in Upper Egypt and burial place of Osiris, god of the dead, located south of modern Sohag. The kings of Dynasty 0, Dynasty 1, and Dynasty 2 were buried there at the site now known as Umm el-Qaab. The local god, Kentiamentiu, became identified with Osiris, who was believed to be buried there. In the Middle Kingdom, with the growth in worship of Osiris, the site became a place of pilgrimage and a desirable location for burial. In the New Kingdom, temples were erected by Sety I and Ramesses II, as well as a cenotaph for Osiris, the Osireion. The area was excavated by French archaeologists Auguste Mariette in the 1850s and Émile Amélineau in 1894–1998. The Egypt Exploration Fund worked here under Flinders Petrie and later other archaeologists in 1899–1904, 1909–1914, and 1925–1930, and also sponsored the copying of the temple of Sety I since 1928. Another British archaeologist, John Garstang, was active in 1907. Excavations have been carried out by an American expedition from Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania since 1967, German archaeologists in the archaic cemetery since 1977, and an American team from the University of Michigan in the Old Kingdom cemetery since 1995.

ACHAEMENES (fl. c. 484–459 BC). Persian satrap of Egypt. Son of Darius I, king of Persia, and Atossa, daughter of Cyrus the Great. He was appointed to office in 484 BC after a rebellion in Egypt and governed until he was killed in 459 BC during another rebellion against Persian rule led by Inaros. See also ARSAMES; XERXES I.
ACHILLAS (fl. 48–49 BC). Military commander of Ptolemy XIII. He supported the king and his minister, Pothinus, in ousting Cleopatra VII from power. Achillas supervised the murder of Gnaeus Pompeius and besieged Caesar in Alexandria. He was murdered in 48 BC in a power struggle with the supporters of Arsinoe IV.

ADAIMA. Modern name for a site on the west bank of the Nile south of Esna in Upper Egypt. It contains the remains of a settlement and cemeteries from the Naqada I Period of the Predynastic Period to the Early Dynastic Period. Adaima was first excavated on behalf of the Brooklyn Museum from 1906–1908. The site was examined by a team from the French Institute in 1973 and since 1989 by a French expedition.

AFTERLIFE. The ancient Egyptians firmly believed in an afterlife, although conceptions of its nature varied. It was generally regarded as a continuation of the agricultural life along the Nile, hence servant figures, or shabtis, were required to avoid manual labor. It was also believed that the dead rested in suspended animation and were only revived when the sun god Re descended into the underworld during the hours of darkness on earth. To enjoy an afterlife, the deceased had to have led a virtuous life according to the precepts of maat. He would have to pass through the various gates of the underworld, guarded by demons, to reach the court of the god of the dead Osiris, where he would be judged in the weighing of the heart ceremony. Various spells in the Book of the Dead were designed to ensure that this procedure was carried out successfully. The Egyptians also believed that the body of the deceased had to be preserved as a home for the ka, or life spirit, and the ba, or free spirit, of the deceased so that he or she might continue to live after death. The technique of mummification was developed to accomplish this. The mummy was buried in the tomb after the opening of the mouth ceremony in which it was magically revived. Depending on the cost of burial, the mummy could be interred in a series of wooden decorated coffins that might be placed in a large stone coffin or sarcophagus. The family or priests would then make periodic food offerings to the spirit of the deceased. Statues would also be provided as a home for the spirits in case the body decayed. The Egyptians ex

A-GROUP. A term invented by George Reisner and used by Egyptologists to designate the inhabitants of Nubia in the Predynastic Period, Early Dynastic Period, and the early Old Kingdom. The people appear to have been herders and farmers. They are known from cemetery sites and a few Egyptian texts that describe Egyptian military activities against them. Such action may have contributed to their eventual disappearance. An alleged B-Group who succeeded them is now regarded as fictitious. See also C-GROUP.
AGRICULTURE. Egypt was an agricultural country in which the bulk of the population were peasant farmers involved in work on the land. The fertility of the land caused by the Nile floods ensured that crops were generally abundant and famines, while they did occur, were rare. The main crops were wheat and barley used to make bread and beer, the staple diet of the people. Vegetables were also produced, and vineyards are attested. Flax was planted to produce linen for clothing, and fodder was grown for livestock. The life of the countryside was dominated by the agricultural schedule. Planting followed the Nile flood in the early summer, and the peasantry was available for government-forced labor toward the end of the growing season. Government inspectors determined the amount of tax due from the individual plots, and the collected grain was stored and used to feed government employees, as at Deir elMedina. In Egypt’s barter economy, a measure of wheat was used to value less expensive goods. Most of the land was owned by the royal court, the temples, and the bureaucracy, but along with the large estates, small private plots are also attested. Most of the people were presumably landless peasants who worked on the large estates as sharecroppers or laborers, but some peasants owned their own land by inheritance or gift of the crown. Enterprising farmers owned some land, rented out more from the estates, and hired laborers, so the status of the agricultural population may be varied. See also DIET; TRADE.

AHA (reigned c. 3080 BC). Second king of Dynasty 1. Successor of Narmer, as confirmed by the dynastic seal. He appears to have been buried at Abydos, and tombs of officials of his reign are known at Saqqara. Aha is probably not to be identified as Menes. He was succeeded by Djet, who was probably his son and whose mother was Khenethap.
AHHIYAWA. An important power whose kingdom bordered on the Mediterranean Sea. The country and its ruler are mentioned in Hittite records. It is now generally believed that the term corresponds to Achaea, the country of the Mycenaean Greeks. A statue base of Amenhotep III mentions the names of various towns in Greece. Quantities of Mycenaean pottery have been found in Egypt at the end of Dynasty 18 and in Dynasty 19. Egyptian objects have been found on mainland Greece, so the two countries are known to have been in contact, although not necessarily directly.
AHHOTEP (fl. 1570–1540 BC). Sister and queen of probably Seqenenre Tao of Dynasty 17 and thus daughter of Senakhtenre and Tetisheri. She was the mother of Ahmose I, who founded Dynasty 18, and his sister-wife Ahmose-Nefertari. Ahhotep apparently acted as regent of her son on his accession and exercised great influence during his reign. A second queen, Ahhotep, is known from a burial at Thebes and is probably to be identified as a queen of Kamose or Seqenenre Tao. The gilded coffin from this burial and jewelry are now in the Cairo Egyptian Museum.
AHMOSE (fl. 1560–1500 BC). Military officer. Son of Baba, a soldier of King Seqenenre Tao, and his wife Ebana, from whose name her son is generally known as Ahmose, son of Ebana. He was the owner of a tomb at Elkab, which contains a major autobiographical inscription describing his exploits in the wars against the Hyksos. Ahmose was present at the siege of Avaris and later took part in campaigns in Palestine, Syria, and Nubia under Ahmose I, Amenhotep I, and Thutmose I. See also WARFARE.

mose seems to have been used both as a distinct name and as part of a more complex name, like Ahmose-Meritamun, daughter of Ahmose I and wife of Amenhotep I. The most prominent prince seems to have been Ahmose-Sipair.
AHMOSE (fl. 1504–1470 BC). Sister-wife of Thutmose I and mother of Hatshepsut. Her parentage is not known, but she was not a royal princess as previously believed.
AHMOSE I (reigned c. 1552–1527 BC). Throne name Nebpehtyre. Founder of Dynasty 18. Probably son of Seqenenre Tao and Queen Ahhotep. He succeeded Kamose, who may have been his brother, apparently under the regency of his grandmother, Tetisheri, and his mother, Ahhotep. Ahmose I continued the campaign of the rulers of Thebes against the Hyksos rulers in the north, and his army successfully took the Hyksos capital, Avaris, and expelled the Hyksos from Egypt, reuniting the country under his rule. His army penetrated at least into southern Palestine in pursuit of the enemy. He also began the Egyptian invasion of Nubia. His wife and probable sister, Ahmose-Nefertari, became regent for their son, Amenhotep I, on his death. See also AHMOSE-SIPAIR; WARFARE.
AHMOSE II (reigned 570–526 BC). The Greek form of his name is Amasis. Throne name Khnumibre. A military commander of Wahibre (Apries), whom he overthrew following a brief civil war. He sought to ally Egypt with the Greeks to face the continuing threat of Persia, including a marriage alliance with Laodike, a Greek lady from Cyrene. Ahmose II ruled effectively for 45 years and died conveniently just before the Persian invasion of 525 BC, as a result of which his son, Psamtik III, was deposed and later executed.
AHMOSE-NEFERTARI (fl. 1550–1500 BC). Wife and probably sister of Ahmose I and thus daughter of Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep. She appears to have been the first queen to use the title God’s wife of Amun and is portrayed with her husband on several monuments of the reign. Ahmose-Nefertari may have acted as regent for her son, Amenhotep I, and seems to have survived him. She was deified with him after his death and is worshipped with him, especially at the village of Deir el-Medina.
AHMOSE-NEFERTARI • 7



AHMOSE-SIPAIR (fl. 1520 BC). A prince of Dynasty 18. He was probably the eldest son of Ahmose I. He was venerated in the later New Kingdom and appears in tomb paintings in Deir el-Medina of the Ramesside Period. Ahmose-Sipair was worshipped together with Ahmose-Nefertari, who may have been his mother, and Amenhotep I. It has been suggested that he was the brother of Ahmose I and the father of Thutmose I. This appears less likely in view of his association with Ahmose-Nefertari, and it is equally probable that he died young. See also MERITAMUN; SITAMUN.
AITAKAMA (fl. 1350–1320 BC). Ruler of Kadesh. Son of Shutatarra, ruler of Kadesh. Loyal of Egypt, his father was defeated and deposed by the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I, and Aitakama was installed in Kadesh as a Hittite vassal. He joined Aziru of Amurru in attacks on Egyptian territory, yet he wrote an Amarna letter declaring his loyalty to Egypt. Upon the death of his Hittite overlord, he broke this allegiance but was assassinated by a son who returned to the Hittite fold.
AKHENATEN (reigned c. 1352–1336 BC). Throne name Neferkheperure waenre. Original name Amenhotep IV. Son of Amenhotep III and Tiy. It is probable that he was not the eldest son, as a Prince Thutmose is attested but presumably died young. It is also not clear if there was a coregency between his father and himself or whether he succeeded only upon his father’s death. Akhenaten sought to establish the primacy of the cult of Re-Harakhty in the form of Aten, the sun’s disk. Following opposition in Thebes from the followers of Amun, he established a new capital at Akhetaten, now Amarna, and built his royal tomb nearby. His opposition to the older cults gradually grew more intense, and they were eventually proscribed. His religious beliefs have been wrongly described as monotheism, as Akhenaten did not abandon those cults associated with the sun god or with kingship, namely his deified father and himself. His reign is also noted for a revolutionary new art style, which is far freer than older Egyptian conventions and depicted the royal family and he himself in a particular manner. Some have sought to identify a medical problem in this style, but it may simply have been a new artistic convention. His wife, Nefertiti, assumed a prominent

role in royal scenes, and it has been suggested that she even succeeded him. The circumstances that ended the reign are unknown. Akhenaten’s eventual successor, Tutankhamun, who may have been his son, abandoned Amarna and reverted to the worship of Amun. Akhenaten’s name and that of his immediate successors were later proscribed.

AKHMIM. Modern name for the Egyptian Khent-Min, Greek Khemmis or Panopolis in the ninth Upper Egyptian nome. Little remains of the ancient city under the modern town. Akhmim is the home city of Ay. In 1981, colossal statues of Ramesses II and his daughter and Queen Meritamun were discovered there. Unsupervised excavations at the end of the 19th century led to the discovery of many textiles and textile fragments from the Coptic Period. The nearby tombs of the Old Kingdom at el-Hawawish were copied and published by an Australian expedition from Macquarie University in 1979–1992. See also ATHRIBIS; MIN.
AKORIS. A town site in Middle Egypt north of Beni Hasan and Ashmunein (Hermopolis). Probably ancient Mer-nefer, late Ta-dehnet. Modern Tihneh-el-Gebel. It is attested from the Middle Kingdom until the Coptic Period. A limestone quarry was located nearby. It has been excavated by a Japanese expedition since 1981.
ALARA (reigned c. 770 BC). Nubian ruler. The first known member of the later Dynasty 25. He is not known to have been active in Egypt, but his successor, Kashta, extended Nubian rule over the Theban area. See also PIYE.
ALASIA. A foreign country named in Egyptian documents during Dynasty 18, Dynasty 19, and Dynasty 20, notably in the Amarna letters. The country could be reached by sea, as described in the story of Wenamun. Alasia is generally identified with all or part of

Cyprus, although some authors situate it on the Levant coast. However, recent advances in the understanding of the geography of Aisa Minor through Hittite documents render this last theory increasingly untenable.
ALEXANDER II (IV of Macedon) (reigned 317–310 BC). Posthumous son of Alexander the Great and the Bactrian princess Roxana. He reigned jointly with his uncle, Philip Arrhidaeus, until the murder of the latter in 317 BC. Alexander II was imprisoned by Cassander and murdered in 310 BC, but he was still acknowledged as ruler until 305 BC, when Cassander, Ptolemy I, and other Macedonian generals assumed independent kingships over parts of Alexander the Great’s empire.
ALEXANDER THE GREAT (356–323 BC). King of Macedon and conqueror of the Persian Empire, including Egypt. Son of King Philip of Macedon and Olympias of Epirus. Alexander succeeded to the Macedonian throne upon the assassination of his father in 336 BC and in 334 BC embarked on the conquest of Persia. In 332 BC, his army entered Egypt, whose satrap surrendered peacefully. Alexander assumed the status of an Egyptian ruler and visited the Siwa Oasis, where he received an oracular pronouncement, later believed to indicate that he was the son of a god. He indicated the position of a new city to be built on the coast and named Alexandria after himself. He left Egypt in 331 BC to continue his conquests elsewhere, arranging for the country to be divided under various officials, the chief of whom was Cleomenes, the chief financial officer. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC upon his return from India. His mummified body was eventually buried in a special mausoleum in Alexandria, where it remained on display until at least the 3rd century AD. See also ALEXANDER II; PHILIP ARRHIDAEUS; PTOLEMY I SOTER.
ALEXANDER HELIOS (b. 40 BC). Son of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra VII. Twin of Cleopatra Selene. He was declared king of Armenia, Parthia, and Media in 34 BC and betrothed to Princess Iotape of Media. He was captured by Augustus in 30 BC and displayed in his triumph in Rome in 29 BC. His ultimate fate is unknown. See also PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS.

ALEXANDRIA. City on the Mediterranean coast of the western Delta founded by Alexander the Great in 331 BC on the site of the Egyptian village of Rakedet, Greek Rakotis. It became the capital of Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt and included many fine buildings, notably the famed Library of Alexandria and the Pharos, or Lighthouse, of Alexandria, regarded as one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Alexander’s body was preserved in a special mausoleum in the city. The city was also decorated with Egyptian monuments removed from earlier sites, notably Heliopolis. The large cosmopolitan population included Egyptians, Greeks, and Jews. The city later suffered damage from earthquakes and invasion and declined following the move of the capital to Cairo after the Arab conquest in 642 AD. Many parts of the city appear to have sunk beneath the harbor. Little of the ancient metropolis remains today, apart from the area adjacent to the so-called Pompey’s Pillar. Excavations by successive directors of the Graeco-Roman Museum have uncovered many local burial catacombs with reliefs in a mixed EgyptianRoman style. Since 1960, a Polish expedition has worked at the site of Kom el-Dikka uncovering a theater and baths. A French rescue expedition excavated part of the main cemetery at Gabbari from 1997–2000, prior to the construction of a new expressway. Recent surveys by teams of French divers have begun to reveal the parts of the city now underwater and recovered Egyptian sculptures and reliefs. Blocks in the sea near the fort of Qait Bey have been identified as belonging to the original lighthouse.
AMADA. Modern name for a site in Lower Nubia of a temple built by Thutmose III and his son, Amenhotep II, in honor of Amun-Re and Re-Harakhty. The area is now flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake formed by the Aswan High Dam, but the temple was removed and reerected at a higher level. See also ABU SIMBEL; BEIT EL-WALI; GERF HUSSEIN; KALABSHA; SOLEB.
AMARA WEST. Modern name for a site in Upper Nubia where a major Ramesside settlement and temple have been discovered. The
AMARA WEST • 11



town appears to have been founded by Sety I, with further construction by his son, Ramesses II. It was probably the major administrative center for Upper Nubia. It was excavated by the Egypt Exploration Society in 1938–1939 and 1947–1950.
AMARNA. The modern Arabic name el-Amarna or Tell el-Amarna denotes the site of the capital city Akhetaten founded by Akhenaten in Middle Egypt in his year 5 (1348 BC). Akhenaten claimed to have chosen a virgin site to become the new capital, away from the religious intolerance of Thebes and where he was free to pursue the worship of Aten. The site consists of the remains of royal palaces, villas, temples, private dwellings, and a workmen’s village, and the boundaries were marked by a series of stelae. The sculptor Thutmose’s workshop yielded the famous bust of Nefertiti, now in the Berlin Egyptian Museum. Tombs for officials were cut in the nearby cliffs, and a royal tomb was built for the king. The scenes on the walls are not fully preserved, but one depicts the death of the Princess Meketaten, although the circumstances of her passing are unclear. The city was abandoned by Tutankhamun and used as building material by later rulers, notably Ramesses II. The site was first excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1891–1892 and then a German expedition in 1907 and 1911–1914. The tombs were copied by an expedition of the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1901–1907. In 1921–1936, further excavations were carried out by the British organization, renamed the Egypt Exploration Society, and work was resumed under its auspices in 1977.
AMARNA LETTERS. A large number of clay tablets inscribed in cuneiform, the script used in Mesopotamia and western Asia, found at the site of el-Amarna. The letters consist of the diplomatic correspondence of the royal court at the end of Dynasty 18 with the princes of Syria and Palestine under Egyptian control as well as other royal courts in Babylonia, Assyria, and Anatolia. Most of the documents date to the reign of Akhenaten, but some letters may belong to the time of his predecessor, Amenhotep III, or his successor, Tutankhamun. The letters reflect a state of disarray in the Egyptian empire, although the extent of the disorder may be exaggerated. See also ABDI-ASHIRTA; AITAKAMA; AMMISTAMRU I; AZIRU; MEGIDDO; RIB-HADDA.
12 • AMARNA



AMARNA PERIOD (c. 1352–1327 BC). A term used by Egyptologists to denote the reigns of Akhenaten and his successors, Smenkhkare and Tutankhamun. The period is notable for innovations in art and religious belief and ended with the abandonment of Amarna as Egypt’s capital. The rulers of the Amarna period were later suppressed from Egypt’s historical record by their successors. See also AY; HOREMHEB; NEFERTITI; RELIGION.
AMASIS. See AHMOSE II.
AMENEMHAT. The name of several Egyptian princes of Dynasty 18. One is known solely from an inscription on a coffin that had been made for his reburial toward the end of Dynasty 20 or early Dynasty 21 and was rediscovered in 1918–1920 at Deir el-Bahri. He has been wrongly described as a son of Amenhotep I, but his actual parentage remains unknown. His very existence might be doubtful if the later embalmers were mistaken in their identification of the body, which was that of a one-year-old child. The eldest son of Thutmose III, who died before his father but was alive in his year 24 (1456 BC), was named Amenemhat but cannot be identified with this child as his titles indicate an older individual. Another Prince Amenemhat may have been a son of Thutmose IV.
AMENEMHAT I (reigned c. 1985–1955 BC). Throne name Sehetepibre. Son of Senusret and Nefret. He is first attested as vizier of Mentuhotep IV of Dynasty 11 and must be identical to the founder of Dynasty 12, although it is not clear if he came to the throne peacefully or as a result of a coup d’état. Amenemhat I proved a strong and effective ruler, establishing a new capital at Itjtawy, now Lisht in the Fayum. He began the campaign of conquest of Nubia and also built a series of fortifications along Egypt’s Sinai border known as the Walls of the Ruler. He apparently installed his son Senusret I as coregent, although this has been doubted by some Egyptologists. Amenemhat I was assassinated after 30 years of rule in an apparent palace conspiracy that was later crushed by his son. He was buried in a pyramid complex at Lisht. A wisdom text in his name, The Instruction of Amenemhat I, was composed after his death, presumably during his son’s reign. See also INTEFYOKER; KHETY; SINUHE.
AMENEMHAT I • 13



AMENEMHAT II (reigned c. 1922–1878 BC). Throne name Nubkaure. Son of Senusret I of Dynasty 12 and Nefru. He continued Egyptian expansion in Nubia and sent expeditions to the Red Sea and Punt. An inscription gives details of campaigns in the Sinai Peninsula and possibly further north. Amenemhat II maintained contacts with Byblos. He was buried in a pyramid complex at Dahshur. See also KHENEMET-NEFER-HEDJET; SENUSRET II.
AMENEMHAT III (reigned c. 1855–1808 BC). Throne name Nimaatre. Son of Senusret III of Dynasty 12. His principal monuments are located in the Fayum area, which seems to have been extensively developed during his reign. He built two pyramids, one at Dahshur, where he appears to have been buried, and another at Hawara, where his mortuary temple was later known to the Greeks as the Labyrinth. See also AMENEMHAT IV; NEFRUPTAH; SOBEKNEFRU.
AMENEMHAT IV (reigned c. 1808–1799 BC). Throne name Maatkherure. Son of Amenemhat III of Dynasty 12. He is principally known from several monuments in the Fayum. Amenemhat IV appears to have died without issue and was succeeded by his sister, Sobeknefru. His burial place has not been securely identified.
AMENEMHAT V (reigned c. 1796–1783 BC). Throne name Sekhemkare. A minor king of Dynasty 13. He is only known from the Turin Royal Canon and a statue found at Elephantine.
AMENEMHAT VI (reigned c. 1788–1785 BC). Throne name Sankhibre. A minor king of Dynasty 13. He is attested in the Turin Royal Canon and on several monuments from Heliopolis, Abydos, and Karnak. His full name is given as Ameny Intef Amenemhat, which may imply that his father was named Intef and his grandfather Ameny, an abbreviation for Amenemhat, and was possibly Amenemhat V.
AMENEMHAT VII (reigned 1769–1766 BC). Throne name Sedjefakare. A minor king of Dynasty 13. Possibly son of Kay. He is named on the Turin Royal Canon and on several monuments.
14 • AMENEMHAT II



AMENEMNISU (reigned c. 1043–1039 BC). Throne name Neferkare. Second ruler of Dynasty 21 of unknown origin. He was cited in Manetho by his throne name, which was generally considered to be an error until an inscription with his titulary was discovered in the tomb of Pasebakhaenniut I at Tanis. His reign appears to have been brief. See also AMENEMOPE; NESBANEBDJED.
AMENEMOPE (reigned c. 993–984 BC). Throne name Usermaatre setepenamun. Epithet meryamun. Fourth ruler of Dynasty 21 and successor of Pasebakhaenniut I. Little is known of his reign. His burial was discovered at Tanis by French excavator Pierre Montet.
AMENHERKHEPESHEF (fl. 1285–1255 BC). Eldest son of Ramesses II of Dynasty 19 and Nefertari. The prince appears to have been also known as Amenherwenemef and Setiherkhepeshef. He was named crown prince by his father and is attested until year 21 of the reign, when he was involved in diplomatic correspondence with the Hittites along with his mother. Amenherkhepeshef died before his father. He was buried in the tomb of the sons of Ramesses II (KV5) in the Valley of the Kings. A like-named son of Ramesses III, who died young, was buried in the Valley of the Queens (QV55). See also KHAEMWESE; MERENPTAH; MERYATUM; PREHERWENEMEF; SETY.
AMENHOTEP I (reigned c. 1525–1504 BC). The Greek form of his personal name is Amenophis. Throne name Djeserkare. Son of Ahmose I of Dynasty 18 and Ahmose-Nefertari. He seems to have succeeded as a child under the regency of his mother. During his reign, the workmen’s community at Deir el-Medina appears to have been founded, and he was the first king to be buried in a cliff tomb in or near the Valley of the Kings, but this remains to be identified. Amenhotep I apparently died without issue by his sister and queen Meritamun and was succeeded by Thutmose I. He was later worshipped as a god, along with his mother, especially at Deir el-Medina. His body was recovered in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881.
AMENHOTEP I • 15



AMENHOTEP II (reigned c. 1427–1400 BC). Throne name Akheperure. Son of Thutmose III of Dynasty 18 and Meryetre Hatshepsut. He appears to have been named as coregent by his father and succeeded as sole ruler in 1425 BC. Upon his accession, he faced a revolt in his Asiatic domains, which he ruthlessly crushed, exhibiting the remains of the rebels as far south as Nubia. His inscriptions boast of his athletic prowess. He appears to have largely maintained the northern conquests of his father. Amenhotep II was buried in tomb KV35 in the Valley of the Kings, and his body was recovered from his tomb in 1898, along with the remains of other rulers who had been buried there in a royal cache. His mortuary temple at Thebes is in ruins, but some foundation deposits have been recovered. It was excavated in 1896 by Flinders Petrie and since 1998 by an Italian expedition. He was succeeded by his son Thutmose IV and by the lady Tiaa.
AMENHOTEP III (reigned c. 1390–1352 BC). Throne name Nebmare. Son of Thutmose IV of Dynasty 18 and Mutemwia. He may have succeeded as a child and reigned 32 years. His supremecy is known for its magnificence in construction and artworks. He maintained the Egyptian empire in Asia and was in communication with the many princes of the area, as shown in the Amarna letters. His chief queen commoner, Tiy, was the mother of his eventual heir, Akhenaten, as it appears that his eldest son, Thutmose, predeceased him. Amenhotep III married several foreign princesses from Mitanni and Babylon. He also had several daughters, notably Sitamun, whom he married. A proposed coregency between father and son is debatable, and most Egyptologists reject the notion. He was buried in tomb KV22 in the Valley of the Kings, and his body was recovered from the royal cache in tomb KV35 of Amenhotep II. His mortuary temple at Kom el-Hetan on the west bank opposite Thebes is largely in ruins but featured the Colossi of Memnon and inscriptions mentioning the Keftyu. It has been under excavation by a German expedition since 1998. See also GILUKHEPA; TADUKHEPA.
AMENHOTEP IV. See AKHENATEN.
AMENHOTEP, SON OF HAPU (fl. c. 1390–1360 BC). Overseer of works for Amenhotep III. He was born in Athribis and was likely
16 • AMENHOTEP II



responsible for the construction of many of the king’s monuments, including his mortuary temple at Thebes and his Nubian temple at Soleb, where he was commemorated. He was buried at Thebes. Amenhotep, son of Hapu, acquired a reputation for wisdom and was deified after his death, being worshipped in his own mortuary temple. See also MEMNON, COLOSSI OF.
AMENIRDIS. The name of two princesses of Dynasty 25 who were adopted as God’s wife of Amun. Amenirdis I was the daughter of Kashta and Pebtama, and her adoption by Shepenwepet I was an indication of the control of Thebes exercised by the ruler of Nubia. Amenirdis II, daughter of Taharqo, was adopted by Shepenwepet II as her heir, but it is not certain if she succeeded, as Dynasty 25 was ousted from Thebes by Psamtik I of Dynasty 26, who sent his daughter, Nitocris, to become God’s wife.
AMENMESSE (reigned c. 1202–1199 BC). Throne name Menmire. Of unknown parentage, he contended with Sety II for the throne upon the death of Merenptah. Amenmesse was defeated and his memory largely obliterated. He had prepared tomb KV10 in the Valley of the Kings for his burial. See also DYNASTY 19.
AMENMOSE (fl. 1504–1499 BC). Egyptian prince of Dynasty 18. He was the eldest son of Thutmose I, possibly by the lady Mutnefret. He is attested in his father’s reign with the title of general and in a tomb scene with his younger brother, Wadjmose. Both predeceased their father, and the throne eventually passed to their brother or half brother, Thutmose II.
AMENOPHIS. See AMENHOTEP.
AMENY QEMAU (reigned c. 1793–1783 BC). Throne name uncertain. An ephemeral king of Dynasty 13. His pyramid tomb was discovered at Dahshur in 1957 but has never been properly excavated or published. The name Qemau has been wrongly interpreted in the past with the meaning of Asiatic. He may have been the father of Harnedjitef, who also bore the epithet that might be read as son of Qemau. The name of Ameny Qemau might be interpreted to indicate
AMENY QEMAU • 17



that he was the son of a previous ruler named Ameny, who in turn might be identified with one of the obscure rulers named Amenemhat of Dynasty 13, probably Amenemhat V.
AMETHYST. Ancient Egyptian hesmen. A violet-colored quartz used in miniature vessels, amulets, and jewelry, mainly from the late Predynastic Period to the end of the Middle Kingdom and again in the Graeco-Roman Period. The main quarries were at Wadi el-Hudi during the Middle Kingdom and Wadi Abu Diyeiba during the Graeco-Roman Period, which was discovered in 1914 and surveyed by an U.S. team in 2004.
AMHEIDA. Ancient Trimithis. A town in the northwest Dakhla Oasis. It has been excavated by an American expedition since 2004. The site was occupied during the Old Kingdom, but the present remains date from the Third Intermediate Period to the late Roman Period. The town was abandoned at the end of the 4th century. The main temple, now destroyed, was dedicated to the god Thoth.
AMMISTAMRU I (fl. 1360–1340 BC). Ruler of Ugarit. He was a correspondent in the Amarna letters. As a vassal ruler, he wrote to declare his loyalty to Egypt. His son and succesor, Niqmaddu, challenged his allegiance and acknowledged Hittite king Suppiluliuma I as his overlord.
AMUN. Chief god of the New Kingdom and later. Originally a minor god at Thebes, he rose to prominence in Dynasty 12, which came from the south, and was promoted to the head of the pantheon under the Theban Dynasty 18 through a fusion with the sun god Re, becoming Amen-Re, king of the gods. Amun is usually represented as a human figure with two plumed feathers but can also have the head of a hawk. He is viewed as one of the creator gods. His main temple was at Karnak in Thebes, where he formed part of the Theban triad with his wife, the goddess Mut, and his son, the moon god Khonsu. He was later worshipped as one of the main gods in Nubia at Gebel Barkal and other temples. His sacred animals were the ram and the goose. See also RELIGION.

AMURRU. A kingdom in Syria that was the northenmost area conquered by Thutmose III. In the time of Amenhotep III and Akhenaten, it was ruled by Abdi-Ashirta and his son, Aziru, who expanded their power with the help of the Habiru. Aziru later defected to the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I and became his vassal. A later ruler, Benteshina, returned to the Egyptian allegiance under Ramesses II but was deposed by the Hittites in the aftermath of the battle of Kadesh. He was later restored by Hattusili III. By the time of the Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty, Egypt finally recognized the loss of Amurru.
AMYRTAEOS (reigned 404–399 BC). Greek name for the Egyptian ruler of Dynasty 28, Amenirdis of Sais, who led a rebellion against the Persian occupation and succeeded in expelling them from the country. He apparently invaded Phoenicia to prevent a Persian counterattack. No inscriptions of his are known, but Amyrtaeos is mentioned in a demotic papyrus. Amyrtaeos was later overthrown by Nefaarud I, founder of Dynasty 29.
ANAT. Canaanite goddess of war. Her worship was adopted in Egypt during the Ramesside Period, and Ramesses II gave his eldest daughter, Bintanat, her name. The Egyptians considered Anat one of the wives of Seth, along with Astarte. See also QUDSHU; RELIGION; RESHEP.
ANCHMACHIS. See ANKHWENNEFER.
ANEDJIB (reigned c. 2935 BC). Sixth ruler of Dynasty 1 and successor of Den. He was buried in a modest tomb at Abydos, and his name has been erased in some instances, indicating possible unrest at the end of his reign. See also SEMERKHET.
ANHUR. Egyptian god known to the Greeks as Onuris and considered a god of war. He is depicted as a bearded man wearing feathered plumes and carrying a spear. His principal place of worship was Thinis in the eighth nome of Upper Egypt, but he was also worshipped in combination with Shu at Sebennytos. Anhur’s wife was the lioness-headed goddess Mehit. See also RELIGION.

ANIBA. Site in Lower Nubia in the Second Cataract region. Egyptian Miam. A fortress was constructed here during Dynasty 12 and was reoccupied during the New Kingdom when it became a major administrative center for the area between the First Cataract and Second Cataract. Aniba was excavated by a German expedition in the 1930s and is now flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake of the Aswan High Dam. Some monuments from the site were salvaged before the flooding. See also ASKUT; BUHEN; KUMMA; MIRGISSA: SHALFAK; URONARTI.
ANKHESENAMUN (fl. 1345–1327 BC). Formerly Ankhesenpaaten. Third daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti and wife of Tutankhamun. She joined her husband in the abandonment of her father’s religious practices and capital at Amarna and changed her name to remove the reference to Aten. Upon the death of her husband, Ankhesenamun wrote to the Hittite king seeking a Hittite prince as a new husband, but the choice, Zannanza, died mysteriously on the way to Egypt. Her subsequent fate is unknown, although it has been conjectured that she married the next king, Ay, as her name appears joined with his on two rings.

ANKHESENPAATEN-TASHERIT (fl. 1336 BC). A princess of the Amarna Period. She is attested on some monuments originating from Amarna found at Hermopolis. Her origin is unknown, but she may be a daughter of Akhenaten or Smenkhkare, and her mother may be Ankhesenpaaten, later Ankhesenamun.

ANKHESENPEPY IV (fl. 2220 BC). The name of a wife of Pepy II. Her sarcophagus was found in the tomb of Iput, another of his queens, at Saqqara. She was the mother of an ephemeral king of Dynasty 7 or Dynasty 8 whose throne name was Neferkare.
ANKHNESNEFERIBRE (fl. c. 590–525 BC). Daughter of Psamtik II of Dynasty 26 and Takhut. She was adopted by her great-aunt Nitocris in 595 BC and succeeded her as God’s wife of Amun in 586 BC. She held the post until the Persian invasion of 525 BC, after which there is no further record of her. Ankhnesneferibre is the last attested God’s wife, although a later classical source implies that the office continued. Her reused sarcophagus was discovered at Deir elMedina and is now in the British Museum.
ANKHWENNEFER (reigned c. 199–186 BC). The Greek form of his name is Chaonnophris, previously wrongly read as Anchmachis. Rebel ruler in the south during the reign of Ptolemy V. He succeeded Harwennefer and was able to regain Thebes, controlling as far north as Asyut. Ankhwennefer was driven from Thebes in 191 BC and finally defeated and captured in battle in 186 BC. His ultimate fate is unknown.
ANTHONY (c. 251–356 AD). Egyptian saint and hermit. He was the son of Christians from the village of Qiman, and upon their death, he gave away his worldly possessions and lived the life of an ascetic hermit near the village and later in the eastern desert. Anthony inspired other hermits to live near him for a time, forming the first ascetic community, although he himself moved to the desert to be on his own. Several of his letters survive, and his life, written by Athanasius, spread the idea of ascetic life in the Christian world. Pachomius, another ascetic, was to change the solitary existence of the hermit into that of a monastic community. See also ABRAHAM; COPTIC CHURCH; SHENOUTE.

ANTINOOPOLIS. Greek name of the city in Middle Egypt founded by Hadrian in 130 AD in honor of his favorite, Antinous, who had drowned in the Nile. Now modern Sheikh Ibada, it is located on the east bank of the Nile opposite Hermopolis. The inhabitants were drawn from the major Greek cities in Egypt. The site was originally an Egyptian city with a temple erected by Ramesses II and has remains dating from the Predynastic Period. Antinoopolis was excavated by the French archaeologist Albert Gayet from 1895–1914, by a British expedition from 1913–1914, and more recently by an Italian expedition.
ANTIOCHUS IV (reigned 175–164 BC). Ruler of the Seleucid Empire encompassing Syria, Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and parts of Iran. Son of Antiochus III and Laodice of Pontus and brother of Cleopatra I. He succeeded to the throne upon the assassination of his brother, Seleucus IV, in association with his nephew, Antiochus, whom he adopted and later executed. Conflict with Egypt over Syria was renewed in 170–169 BC, but an invading Egyptian army was defeated. Antiochus in turn invaded Egypt, taking the border town of Pelusium and capturing Ptolemy VI and Memphis, but he failed to take Alexandria and withdrew in 169 BC. He invaded again in 168 BC and may have aimed to crown himself ruler of Egypt, but he was forced to withdraw under pressure from Rome. He then turned his attention eastward to Iran and died at Tabae in 164 BC. See also POPILLIUS LAENAS, CAIUS; WARFARE.
ANTONIUS, MARCUS (83–30 BC). Roman politician. Son of Marcus Antonius and Julia of the family of the Julii Caesares. He was an early supporter of his distant relation, Caius Iulius Caesar, and sought to inherit his political power after the latter’s assassination in 44 BC, but he was forced to ally himself with the future Augustus to crush their political opponents. Antonius was given the eastern part of the empire in the division of the territory after the victory at Philippi in 42 BC and married Augustus’s sister as part of their political alliance. He soon formed a political and personal connection with Cleopatra VII of Egypt, which estranged him from Augustus, who used this oriental entanglement to vilify Antonius in Rome. War

was eventually declared against Egypt, and Antonius was defeated at the battle of Actium in 31 BC and committed suicide in 30 BC as Augustus’s forces entered Alexandria. See also ALEXANDER HELIOS; CLEOPATRA SELENE; PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS.
ANTYEMSAF. See NEMTYEMSAF.
ANUBIS. Egyptian god of the necropolis and embalming represented as a jackal or a jackal-headed man. He was responsible for conducting the deceased to Osiris, god of the dead. See also RELIGION.
ANUKIS. Daughter of the god Khnum of Elephantine and Satis. She is depicted as a human female figure wearing a feathered headdress and was principally worshipped at Elephantine and in Nubia. See also RELIGION.
APEPI (reigned c. 1585–1550 BC). The Greek form of his name is Apophis. Throne name Aawoserre. Last or penultimate Hyksos ruler of Dynasty 15. He is attested as an opponent of the rulers of Thebes, Tao, and Kamose. Apepi tried to fashion an alliance with the ruler of Kush against the Thebans, but this attempt apparently failed. It is not clear whether he was still reigning when his capital, Avaris, fell to the Theban forces under Ahmose I. Two other throne names, Aakenenre and Nebkhepeshre, are associated with Apepi and may refer to different monarchs or more likely to the same man who changed his throne name. He may have been briefly succeeded by Khamudy, the last of the dynasty. See also IANNAS; KHAYAN; SALITIS.
APEREL (fl. 1370 BC). Northern vizier of Amenhotep III. His intact tomb was excavated at Saqqara beginning in 1976, culminating in the opening of the burial chamber in 1987. His existence was hitherto unknown. Aperel’s name is Semitic, but his burial was thoroughly Egyptian, so it cannot be necessarily assumed that he was of foreign origin as Semitic names were sometimes used by Egyptians. See also AMENEMHAT I; AY; HEMIUNU; IMHOTEP; INTEFYOKER; KAGEMNI; MERERUKA; NEFERMAAT; PASER; PTAHHOTEP; PTAHSHEPSES; RAMESSES I; REKHMIRE.

APION. Family of Egyptian landowners and officials in the Byzantine Period, known from documents from Oxyrhynchus, where they had estates. The earliest known member appears to have been Flavius Strategius I, who died before 469. His probable son was Apion I, a patrician and vice prefect of the East in 503–504 and later praetorian prefect in the East in 518–519, who held an honorary consulship at the end of the 5th century AD and died between 524 and 532. Other family members included Flavius Strategius II, prefect of Egypt from 518–523, and Flavius Strategius Apion II, consul in 539 who died around 578. The family supported the orthodox imperial view in the religious controversies with the nascent Coptic Church. The last known member was Apion III, who died or disappeared in late 619, possibly a victim of the Persian invasion. The Apions represent one of the few Egyptian families to have exercised political influence on the imperial court.
APIS. Greek name for the sacred bull of Memphis. Egyptian Hapi. The bull was the living embodiment of the god Ptah and after death was identified with Osiris. He was recognized by distinct signs and housed in the temple complex. Upon his death, a new bull was sought born near the time of death of the old. The bulls were buried in the Serapeum at Saqqara. The mother of the bull was also accorded special honors, and the burial catacombs for the cows were discovered by a British expedition in the 1970s. The cult is known from Dynasty 1, but it became particularly important during the Late Period. See also RELIGION.
APRIES. See WAHIBRE.
ARCHAIC PERIOD. See EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD.
ARIUS (c. 270–336 AD). Egyptian Christian priest in Alexandria of Libyan origin who enunciated the doctrine of Arianism indicating that Christ had only one nature—human as against the orthodox view of two natures, human and divine intermingled. He was fiercely opposed by Athanasius, later patriarch of Alexandria, who forced him to leave the city. Arius died in Constantinople in 336. His doctrine

found little support in Egypt, although Athanasius was for a time deposed by an Arian, but it influenced several emperors and later spread to barbarian converts outside the empire.
ARMANT. Modern name for the Egyptian Iuny, Greek Hermonthis, capital of the fourth nome of Upper Egypt until superseded by Thebes. It was located on the west bank of the Nile opposite Tod. The principal deity of the site was the god Montu, whose temple is now destroyed. Archaeological remains date from the Predynastic Period to the Roman Period, when it again became the nome capital. The burials of the sacred ram Buchis have also been located. Armant was excavated on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Society in 1927–1932, and the texts in the temple have been recorded by the French Institute since 2002.
ARSAMES (fl. 423-404 BC). Persian satrap of Egypt during the reign of Darius II of Persia (423–404 BC). Member of the royal family. Part of his official correspondence written in Aramaic has been discovered. His governorship may have been ended by the revolt that brought Amyrtaeos to power. See also ACHAEMENES.
ARSAPHES. See HERYSHEF.
ARSINOE I (born c. 300 BC). Daughter of King Lysimachus of Thrace and Nicaea. First wife of Ptolemy II and mother of Ptolemy III. She was exiled to Coptos in 279 BC on a charge of conspiracy after she was supplanted in the king’s affections by Arsinoe II.
ARSINOE II (c. 316–270 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy I and Berenice I. She married King Lysimachus of Thrace, who killed his son by his first marriage possibly by her influence. This resulted in civil strife leading to the king’s death in battle in 281 BC. She then married her half brother Ptolemy, king of Macedonia, who murdered two of her sons and died in battle with the Celts in 279 BC. She returned to Egypt and entered into her third marriage around 276 BC to her full brother, Ptolemy II. She was highly influential at court and was deified with her husband.
ARSINOE II • 25



ARSINOE III (c. 235–205 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy III and Berenice II and wife of her full brother Ptolemy IV, whom she married in 217 BC. She was estranged from her husband and apparently murdered by his courtiers shortly after his death to prevent her becoming regent. See also SOSIBIOS.
ARSINOE IV (c. 63–41 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy XII and possibly Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. She supported her brother, Ptolemy XIII, against Cleopatra VII and was taken to Rome by Iulius Caesar to appear in his triumph in 46 BC. She later took refuge in Ephesus but was executed at the order of her sister, Cleopatra VII, in 41 BC. See also ACHILLAS.
ART. In ancient Egypt, monumental and most private art was designed for religious rather than decorative purposes. The statue was originally developed as a substitute home for the spirit in the afterlife, and later statues were also placed in temples where the name of the deceased could be read, causing the deceased to live again. The block statue, which first appeared in the early Middle Kingdom, was particularly favored because of the amount of space available for text. Incised reliefs and wall paintings in tombs depicted the goods and activities the deceased wished to enjoy in the next life. Royal reliefs on temple walls showed the majesty and power of the king and the beneficence of the gods. Most statues and reliefs were in fact painted, but much of this paint has worn away. Egyptian artists worked to a canon of proportions for the human figure. A standard style was set by the royal court, although regional variations appeared during the First Intermediate Period, Second Intermediate Period, and Third Intermediate Period, when central government and artistic patronage had broken down. Egyptian art was not static, as the canon of proportions varied over time. The most obvious change occurred during the Amarna Period, when the canon was changed and the human figure was depicted in an exaggerated style with a long, narrow neck and full hips. During the Late Period, artists drew inspiration from the works of the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom.
Very little decoration in royal and private buildings survives. The remaining fragments of tiles and frescoes show that the decorative
26 • ARSINOE III



scheme of the royal palace sought to display the might of the sovereign as a conqueror, although more intimate scenes are known from the Amarna Period. Egyptian craftsmen were adept in the production of such small, functional objects as cosmetic spoons and other toiletry objects in a highly decorative form. See also SPHINX; STONE; THUTMOSE.
ARTAXERXES I (reigned 465–423 BC). King of Persia and ruler of Egypt. Son of Xerxes and Amestris. He succeeded to the throne following the murder of his father and his elder brother, Darius. He faced a major revolt in Egypt beginning in 459 BC led by Inaros, but his forces managed to crush the resistance in 454 BC. He installed Arsames as satrap. He also signed a peace treaty with Athens in 449 BC to end the Greco-Persian wars. Following his death, the throne was briefly occupied by his sons, Xerxes II and Sogdianus, until a third son, Darius II, secured his rule.
ARTAXERXES II (c. 453/445–359 BC). King of Persia. Son of Darius II and Parysatis. Egypt was in revolt upon his succession, although he seems to have been recognized in Elephantine until 401 BC. He faced a rebellion by his younger brother, Cyrus, which was suppressed and unable to reconquer Egypt despite several campaigns. See also AMYRTAEOS.
ARTAXERXES III (reigned in Egypt 343–338 BC). King of Persia and ruler of Egypt. Personal name Ochus. Son of Artaxerxes II and Statira. He took part in a war against Egypt around 361 BC and seized power upon the death of his father in 359 BC. He spent his reign quelling rebellions and consolidating his empire. He embarked on a campaign of reconquest of Egypt in 343 BC. He had a reputation as a cruel and ruthless ruler and was murdered by his close adviser, Bagoas, in 338 BC, who initially placed his son, Arses—officially Artaxerxes IV—on the throne before replacing him with Darius III. See also WARFARE.
ASHAYET (fl. 2020 BC). A minor wife of Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11. She was commemorated in a chapel and buried in a pit tomb at his funerary complex at Deir el-Bahri. The chapel was discovered
ASHAYET • 27



during Henri Edouard Naville’s excavations at the site, but Ashayet’s tomb was found largely intact by an American expedition from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in excavations from 1920–1921. Her sarcophagus and mummy are now in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. See also HENHENET; KAWIT; KEMSIT; MYT; NEFRU; SADEH; TEM.
ASKUT. Modern name for the site of a fortress in the Second Cataract region of Nubia. Egyptian Djer Setiu. It appears to have been constructed during the Middle Kingdom as part of a series of fortresses from Buhen to Semna by Senusret III to control the native Nubians. The fortress was abandoned during the Second Intermediate Period but reused during the New Kingdom. Askut was excavated in 1962–1964 by an expedition from the University of California at Los Angeles before the site was flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake created by the Aswan High Dam. See also ANIBA; BUHEN; KUMMA; MIRGISSA; SEMNA; SHALFAK; URONARTI.
ASSYRIA. A kingdom situated in northern Iraq that was renowned for its warring capabilities. Assyria benefited from the destruction of Mitanni and the Hittite Empire and expanded southward to conquer Mesopotamia and westward to Syria and Palestine, whose states were annexed or reduced to vassal status. The kingdom came into conflict with Egypt at the beginning of Dynasty 25, but its forces were kept at bay until the reign of Esarhaddon (681–69 BC), who invaded Egypt in 671 BC. Nubian ruler Taharqo of Dynasty 25 was defeated and driven south, and members of the royal family were captured, but Assyrian forces were eventually expelled. The son and successor of Esarhaddon, Ashurbanipal (669–27 BC), renewed the campaign, took Memphis, and drove Taharqo south again. The local princes of the Delta submitted, notably Nekau I of Sais of Dynasty 26, who became the chief Assyrian vassal after the other princes were executed for disloyalty. The new ruler of Dynasty 25, Tantamani, invaded Egypt from Nubia in 664 BC, after the departure of the main Assyrian forces, and killed Nekau, whose son, Psamtik I, fled to Assyria for protection. In 663 BC, the Assyrians returned, defeated the Nubians, and sacked Thebes. During Psamtik I’s long reign, the control of Assyria gradually weakened due to in
28 • ASKUT



ternal difficulties, and Egypt regained independence. When the Assyrian kingdom was destroyed in 612 BC, the remnants appealed to Egypt for help, and Nekau II invaded Palestine as an ally but was defeated by the Babylonians at the battle of Carchemish in 609 BC, after which Assyria disappeared as a political entity.
ASTARTE. Canaanite goddess of love and fertility. Her worship spread to Egypt during the New Kingdom. She was considered one of the wives of the god Seth, along with Anat. See also QUDSHU; RELIGION; RESHEP.
ASWAN. See ELEPHANTINE.
ASYUT. Arabic name for the Egyptian Sauty, Greek Lycopolis, capital of the 13th nome of Upper Egypt. The chief deity of the city was the god Wepwawet. Very little remains of the town, but the tombs of the nomarchs of the First Intermediate Period and the Middle Kingdom have been uncovered. Excavations were performed by a French team in 1903, an Italian expedition in 1905–1913, and British excavators in 1906–1907 and 1922. A joint German–Egyptian expedition has been working on tombs in the necropolis since 2003.
ATEN. The sun’s disk and so a form of the sun god Re-Harakhty. Aten was worshipped as a god in his own right toward the end of Dynasty 18 and raised to position of supreme deity by Akhenaten in opposition to the cult of Amun. In his honor, the king took a name compounded with that of the god and founded a new city at Amarna. The king sought to suppress the cults of other rival gods, but his new religion was not monotheistic since he did not proscribe cults connected with the sun god, like the Mnevis bull or those deifying the kingship of his father or himself. Following Akhenaten’s death, the cult of Aten was abandoned and proscribed, although there are occasional references to the Aten in its old form as the sun’s disk.
ATET. See NEFERMAAT.
ATHANASIUS (c. 296–373 AD). Egyptian Christian patriarch. He was born in Alexandria, where he was educated and became the secretary

of Patriarch Alexander, whom he succeeded in 326. Prior to his accession, he took part in the Council of Nicaea in 325, where the orthodox creed was laid down, and thereafter he became a staunch opponent of the doctrine of Arius. Athanasius was exiled from 334–337 and deposed from 340–345 and 356-61 and briefly exiled in 363 and 365 by various emperors for his views. He set the example for opposition by the patriarchs of Alexandria to imperial policy when it conflicted with their religious beliefs. He died in May 373. His surviving writings include an influential life of St. Anthony. See also BENJAMIN; COPTIC CHURCH; CYRIL; CYRUS; DIOSCORUS; THEOPHILUS.
ATHRIBIS. Greek name for the Egyptian Hutheryib, modern Tell Atrib, capital of the 10th nome of Lower Egypt. The town is attested from at least the Old Kingdom but was particularly prominent in the Late Period and Graeco-Roman Period. Little remains on the site, but it was excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1907 and subsequently by Alan Rowe in 1939 and has been under excavation by a Polish expedition since 1957. The tomb of queen Takhut, wife of Psamtik II and mother of Wahibre, was discovered here in 1951. A second site named Athribis is located at modern Nag ash-Shaykh Hamad in the ninth nome of Upper Egypt on the west bank of the Nile opposite Akhmim, ancient Hutrepit. The surviving remains are dated from the Late Period to the Coptic Period and include Graeco-Roman tombs and a temple dedicated to the local goddess Repit with her consort Min. The site has been examined by a German–Egyptian expedition since 1998.
ATUM. Primeval creator god who was believed to have arisen from chaos, or Nun, and then produced the deities Shu and Tefnut by spitting or masturbation. He can be depicted as a human figure or serpent. Atum worshipped at Heliopolis, where he was identified with the sun god Re. His sacred animal was the ichneumon or shrew. See also RELIGION.
AUGUSTUS (63 BC–14 AD). First Roman emperor. Original name Caius Octavius. Son of Caius Octavius and Atia and great-nephew of Iulius Caesar who adopted him in his will. He used his adoptive fa

ther’s name and his own political skills following Caesar’s assassination in 44 BC to become one of the rulers of the Roman world, alongside Marcus Aemilius Lepidus and Marcus Antonius. Augusttus eventually forced Lepidus’s resignation and clashed with Antonius and his ally Cleopatra VII, whom he defeated and drove to suicide in 30 BC. He then annexed Egypt as the personal property of the emperor, forbidding any senator to go there without imperial permission and putting Egypt under the control of a prefect. His rule restricted the rights of the native Egyptians and refused to recognize the use of the Egyptian language in official documentation. Augustus was considered pharaoh by the Egyptians, and his name appears in cartouches with the prenomen autocrator, the Greek equivalent of imperator, his official Roman designation.
AVARIS. Modern Tell el-Daba. Capital city of the Hyksos Dynasty 15 situated in the Delta. Very little is known of its history. It was founded in Dynasty 12 and settled by immigrants from Syria-Palestine and later served as the Hyksos stronghold. Avaris was attacked by Kamose and later captured by Ahmose I of Dynasty 18, after which it fell into ruins. Excavations on the site have been carried out by an Austrian expedition since 1966 and have revealed palace structures and wall frescoes in the Minoan style.
AVIDIUS CASSIUS, CAIUS (c. 130–175 AD). Roman general. He was born in Egypt c. 130 AD as son of Caius Avidius Heliodorus, prefect of Egypt. He served the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and took part in the Parthian War from 162–166. He became consul in 166 AD and was then named governor of Syria. On a rumor of the death of the emperor, he was proclaimed his successor in 175 AD and controlled Egypt and the East, but his revolt collapsed, and he was killed when the news of the emperor’s death proved false.
AY (reigned c. 1327–1323 BC). Throne name Kheperkheprure. High official during the reign of Akhenaten and Tutankhamun with the title God’s father and vizier. It has been speculated that he was the brother of Tiy and the father of Nefertiti, but nothing definite is known about his family apart from the fact that his wife, also Tiy, was the nurse of Nefertiti. Ay succeeded Tutankhamun, probably

against the wishes of Queen Ankhesenamun, and conducted the burial rites for the late monarch, as depicted in Tutankhamun’s tomb. His reign was brief and he was buried in tomb KV23 in the Valley of the Kings, which was discovered in 1816, but his mummy has not been preserved or identified. His memory was later suppressed in Dynasty 19. See also HOREMHEB; NAKHTMIN.
AYN SOKHA. Modern name for a site on the Gulf of Suez south of the city of Suez. There are remains of copper-smelting facilities from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom. The area has been under excavation by a French expedition since 2001.
AZIRU (fl. 1350–1320 BC). Ruler of Amurru. Son of Abdi-Ashirta. He continued his father’s policy of conquest and took over the local Egyptian capital, killing the Egyptian commissioner. He still protested his loyalty to Akhenaten in the Amarna letters. Aziru was summoned to Egypt to explain his actions but was allowed to return to Amurru to face a Hittite advance. He renounced his Egyptian allegiance and became a vassal of the Hittite king Suppiluliuma I. See also BENTESHINA.

BACCHIAS. A town in the northeastern Fayum from the GraecoRoman Period. Modern Tell Umm et-Atl. It flourished from the 3rd century BC until the 4th century AD. The main temple was dedicated to the local god Soknobkonneus. It was excavated by British archaeologists briefly in 1896, and excavation work has been carried out by an Italian expedition since 1993. Remains of houses and papyri have been discovered. See also DEIR EL-NAQLUN; GUROB; HARAGEH; HAWARA; KARANIS; KOM KHELWA; KOM TALIT; LAHUN; LISHT; MEDINET MADI; SOKNOPAIOU NESOS; TEBTUNIS.

BAGOAS (fl. 360–336 BC). Persian eunuch. He was a close adviser of Artaxerxes III and led his army in the reconquest of Egypt in 343 BC. He quarreled with his Greek mercenaries and was recalled to Persia. Bagoas murdered Artaxerxes III in 338 BC, as well as his son and successor, Arses, in 336 BC but was then executed by Darius III, whom he had placed on the throne. See also NAKHTHORHEB.
BAHARIYA OASIS. Ancient Egyptia Djesdjes or Wehat mehyt, meaning northern oasis. An oasis in the Western Desert west of Luxor. Archaeological remains have been discovered from the Middle Kingdom to the Byzantine Period, including tombs of local governors from Dynasty 19 and Dynasty 26. There are also temples dedicated to Hercules and Alexander the Great. A major cemetery of the Graeco-Roman Period was discovered by Egyptian archaeologists in 1996. The late Roman fortress site at Qaret el-Tub has been excavated by a French team beginning in 2001 and the settlement site from Dynasty 26 at Qasr Allam since 2002. See also DAKHLA OASIS; FARFARA OASIS; KHARGA OASIS; SIWA OASIS.
BAKENKHONS (fl. 1300–1220). High priest of Amun at Thebes. He came from a priestly family, being the son of Roma, second prophet of Amun, and Amenemope. His lengthy biography is inscribed on a block statue, now in the Munich Museum. During his youth, he served in the stable of Sety I and then succesively held the offices of fourth, third, and second prophets of Amun during the reign of Ramesses II until being promoted to the post of high priest, first prophet of Amun. He supervised the king’s building of the temple of Karnak. He was succeeded by Roma-Roy, probably a close relation. A second high priest of Amun, Bakenkhons held office during the reigns of Sethnakhte and Ramesses III. A stela of his dated to year 4 of Sethnakhte was discovered in 2007 during clearance of the alley of ram-headed sphinxes between the temples of Karnak and Luxor. See also PASER; WENNEFER.
BAKENRENEF (reigned c. 725–719 BC). The Greek form of his name is Bocchoris. Throne name Wahkare. Ruler of Dynasty 24. He succeeded his father, Tefnakhte, as prince of Sais and claimant to the throne of Egypt. The extent of his rule is unclear, but he was opposed

BAKETATEN (fl. c. 1350 BC). Royal princess known only from a relief at Amarna, where she is depicted with her mother, Queen Tiy. It is presumed that she was an otherwise unattested daughter of Amenhotep III, but it is possible that she was in fact a granddaughter of Tiy and daughter of Akhenaten. See also AMARNA PERIOD; SITAMUN; THUTMOSE.
BALAMUN. See TELL EL-BALAMUN.
BALAT. Modern name for a site near Ayn Asil in the Dakhla Oasis. Ancient Dmi-iw. It flourished during the Old Kingdom and was the center of the oasis and seat of the local governor. The site was discovered by Egyptian archaeologist Ahmad Fakhry, who excavated the area from 1968–1972. Excavations were continued by a French expedition beginning in 1977. Since 1985, the group has uncovered the palace of the governor built during Dynasty 6, where two caches of clay tablets inscribed in hieratic and seal impressions have been found. The nearby tombs of the governors of the oasis, Ima-Pepy I, Ima-Pepy II, Khentikha and Medu-nefer, who served under Pepy I and Pepy II, have also been cleared and published.
BALBILLA, JULIA (fl. 130 AD). Daughter of Caius Iulius Antiochus Epiphanes and Claudia Capitolina and granddaughter of King Antiochus IV of Commagene and Tiberius Claudius Balbillus, prefect of Egypt. She accompanied Emperor Hadrian and his wife, Vibia Sabina, to Egypt in 130 AD and took part in their visit to the Colossi of Memnon. Balbilla recorded the event in a poem inscribed on one of the statues, which still survives.
BALLANA. Modern name for a site in Nubia on the west bank of the Nile south of Qasr Ibrim where, together with the site of Qustul on the east bank, many graves have been excavated from different phases of Nubian culture. Some 180 tombs, dating from the 4th through 7th centuries AD, were discovered, of which 40 contained
34 • BAKETATEN



material of such richness that they might be called royal, including jewelry, crowns, weapons, horse fittings, and vessels. These items are now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. The site has given its name to the Ballana culture, or X-group culture, which can be identified from graves elsewhere in Nubia. Ballana was excavated by the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1931–1934 and more recently by an Egyptian expedition in 1958–1959 and the University of Chicago in the 1960s in advance of flooding caused by the Aswan High Dam.
BASTET. Cat goddess of Bubastis represented as a cat-headed or lioness-headed human figure, often with a sistrum rattle or kittens. The worship of her cult became popular during the Late Period, from which time cemeteries of cats killed as votive offerings to her have been discovered. See also RELIGION; SAKHMET.
BAUEFRE (fl. 2570 BC). A royal prince of Dynasty 4. Son of Khufu. He is named in the literary tale on the Westcar Papyrus, and his name appears in a cartouche in a later inscription in the Wadi Hammamat. He is otherwise unknown. See also DJEDEFRE; HARDJEDEF; KAWAB; KHAFRE.
BAWIT. Modern name for a monastic site of Apa Apollo in Upper Egypt on the west bank of the Nile between Asyut and Ashmunein (Hermopolis), which flourished from the late 3rd century AD until at least the end of the 12th century. It was apparently founded by the monk Apa Apollo. Excavations by French archaeologists from 1901–1904 and in 1913 uncovered part of the site and found architectural elements and stone and wooden sculpture, as well as important paintings. Further excavations have been conducted by an Egyptian expedition in 1976 and from 1984–1985 and a French team since 2002.
BAY (fl. 1196 BC). Ruler of the throne at the end of Dynasty 19. He claims to have arranged the succession of Siptah after the death of Sety II. Egyptian inscriptions give him the title of chancellor, but a text from Ugarit calls him commander of the king’s guard. He had a tomb (KV13) in the Valley of the Kings. Bay has been identified as a Syrian by modern Egyptologists due to a later ambiguous reference,

but there is no firm evidence of his background. He is now known to have been executed in year 5 of Siptah (1189 BC) by order of the king. Since the king was a minor, it is obvious that a rival faction at court, possibly head by Queen Dowager Tewosret, arranged for his demise. Tewosret succeeded to the throne the next year after the death of the king, so she was the ultimate beneficiary of Bay’s execution. He was presumably never buried in his valley tomb. See also SETHNAKHTE.
BEIT EL-WALI. Modern name for the site of a temple of Ramesses II in Nubia, built early in his reign and depicting his wars. The area is now flooded by the lake of the Aswan High Dam, but the temple has been moved to a site near Aswan. See also ABU SIMBEL; AMADA; GERF HUSSEIN; KALABSHA; SOLEB.
BELZONI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA (1778–1823). Italian adventurer and excavator. He was born in Padua on 5 November 1778 and later joined a circus troupe in London. He went to Egypt in 1815 to seek work as a technical adviser but was unsuccessful. Belzoni was employed by Henry Salt, the British consul general, to move a head of Ramesses II from the Ramesseum to England for placement in the British Museum and thereafter to acquire antiquities for Salt’s collections, which were later sold to the British Museum and the Louvre Museum. He supervised excavations at Giza, Thebes, and Abu Simbel and acquired material from locals. He quarreled with Salt over the terms of his employment, and in 1819, he returned to London with some antiquities and watercolors of tomb scenes. While there he put on a successful exhibition and wrote his memoirs. Belzoni died at Gwato in Benin, West Africa, on 3 December 1823, during an expedition seeking the source of the Niger River. See also DROVETTI, BERNARDINO MICHELE MARIA.
BENI HASAN. Modern name for the site in Middle Egypt containing the rock tombs of the nomarchs of the 16th nome of Upper Egypt and other officials dating to Dynasty 11 and Dynasty 12. One tomb is notable for the depiction of Asiatics who had traveled to Egypt. The site also contains a New Kingdom rock chapel dedicated by Hatshepsut and Thutmose III. The tombs were copied by an expe

BENJAMIN (c. 590–661 AD). Coptic patriarch of Alexandria. He was born at Barshut in the western Delta and in 620 joined a monastic community at Canopus. He later served as assistant to the patriarch Andronicus of the Coptic Church, succeeding him in 622. In 631, he opposed Cyrus, the newly appointed orthodox patriarch and prefect of Egypt who tried to end the religious divisions in Egypt by force. Benjamin fled into hiding, and the resultant instability undoubtedly aided the Arabic conquest of Egypt in 642. He was later restored to office, but the division of the Christians into Coptic and orthodox communities with separate patriarchs remained permanent. He remained on amicable terms with the new Islamic rulers. He died on 3 January 661. See also ATHANASIUS; CYRIL; CYRUS; DIOSCORUS; THEOPHILUS.
BENTESHINA (fl. 1290–1235 BC). King of Amurru. Son of TuppiTeshub, king of Amurru, and great-grandson of Aziru, son of AbdiAshirta. Originally a Hittite vassal, he defected to Egypt probably under Sety I. Benteshina was deposed by Muwattili II, the Hittite king, in the aftermath of the battle of Kadesh when the Hittites regained control of Amurru. He was restored to the throne by UrhiTeshub or Hattusili III, whose daughter he married.
BERENICE I (c. 340–278/7 BC). Daughter of Magas and Antigone and wife of a Macedonian named Philip by whom she had several children. She came to Egypt with Eurydice, second wife of Ptolemy I, and soon became the mistress and then wife of the king. Berenice I was the mother of his successor, Ptolemy II, and his sister-wife, Arsinoe II.
BERENICE II (c. 273–221 BC). Daughter of King Magas of Cyrene and Apama. She was engaged to Ptolemy III, but her mother attempted to marry her to a Macedonian prince against whom she led a revolt ending in his execution. She married the Egyptian king in 246 BC. Berenice II was the mother of Ptolemy IV, who apparently had her killed shortly after his accession.
BERENICE II • 37



BERENICE III. See CLEOPATRA BERENICE III.
BERENICE IV (c. 78–55 BC). Eldest daughter of Ptolemy XII and Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. When her father was expelled in 58 BC, she was named joint ruler apparently with her mother. In 56 BC, Berenice IV first married Seleucus, a Syrian prince whom she murdered shortly after the marriage. She then wed Archelaus of Cappadocia, who was killed in 55 BC trying to defeat the Roman forces supporting his father-in-law. Upon his restoration, Ptolemy XII executed his daughter.
BERENIKE. Ptolemaic port on the Red Sea on a parallel with Aswan and connected by a trade route to Edfu. It was founded by Ptolemy II around 275 BC and named after his mother, Berenice I. It was the main port for trade with Arabia and India during the Ptolemaic Period when important imports included elephants for the Ptolemaic army, but it declined during the Roman Period when Myos Hormos, located further north, became more prominent. Berenike appears to have been refurbished during the 4th century AD and flourished until the 6th century AD. The town was excavated by an American expedition from 1994–2001.
BERLIN EGYPTIAN MUSEUM. Founded by the King of Prussia on 1 July 1828 following the acquisition of the collections of Heinrich von Minutoli and Giuseppe Passalacqua, who became the first director, and the collection of Bernardino Drovetti in 1836. The collection was increased during the expedition to Egypt in 1842–1845 by Richard Lepsius, who became the second director of the institution in 1865. A new museum for Egyptain antiquities was opened in 1850. The collection was enriched by the gift of Amarna sculpture, notably the head of Queen Nefertiti by a merchant who had financed the German excavations at Amarna. The museum was badly damaged during World War II, and the collections were later divided between East Berlin and West Berlin. The management of the Egyptian collection has now been unified, and plans are under way to rebuild the museum at its old site.

BIBI UMM FAWAKHIR. A gold mining site in the Eastern Desert northeast of the Wadi Hammamat between Coptos and Quseir (Myos Hormos). It flourished in the 5th and 6th centuries AD, but there is earlier evidence of New Kingdom and Ptolemaic activity. Bibi Umm Fawakhir was excavated by an expedition from the University of Chicago from 1992–2001.
BINTANAT (fl. c. 1280–1210 BC). Eldest daughter of Ramesses II and Isitnofret. She married her father and was influential during the latter part of his reign and into that of her full brother, Merenptah. Bintanat had her own tomb (QV71) in the Valley of the Queens, where she is depicted with a daughter whose royal parentage is not explicitly stated. See also HENTTAWY; HENUTMIRE; MAATHORNEFERURE; MERITAMUN; NEBTTAWY; NEFERTARI.
BOOK OF THE DEAD. The name given to a type of papyrus often buried with the dead from the New Kingdom onward. The papyrus contained a number of magical spells that would enable the deceased to successfully reach the next world. The most important spell concerned the ritual of the weighing of the heart against the feather of maat to determine the deceased’s worthiness to enter the afterlife, and the spell was supposed to fix the balance in the deceased’s favor. Some books of the dead were decorated with elaborate vignettes and scenes depicting funerals and rituals. Some were obviously produced as special commissions, but there were stock examples available for purchase in which the name of the deceased could be filled in blank spaces or in some cases not filled in at all. See also RELIGION.
BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS. Founded in 1872, the museum immediately acquired its first Egyptian objects from the collection of C. Granville Way, who had purchased them from the estate of Robert Hay, an early traveler in Egypt. Further acquisitions were made from the collection of John Lowell of Boston, another early traveler, and from donations from the Egypt Exploration Fund. In 1909, a new museum building was inaugurated. Following the appointment of George Reisner as curator of Egyptian antiquities in 1910, the museum received substantial numbers of objects from his archaeological work at Giza, Naga el-Deir, Deir el-Bersha, and various Nubian

BREASTED, JAMES HENRY (1865–1935). American Egyptologist. He was born in Rockford, Illinois, on 27 August 1865. He studied at Yale University and later in Berlin. Breasted obtained a post at the University of Chicago in 1895, where later in 1905 he became professor of egyptology. With funds from John D. Rockefeller, he founded the Oriental Institute at the University of Chicago, which became the leading research and teaching center for Near Eastern studies in the United States. He also directed expeditions in Egypt and published translations of Egyptian historical texts. He died in New York on 2 December 1935.
BRITISH MUSEUM. Founded in 1753 as a national museum of Great Britain to house collections bequeathed to the nation. It was funded by a lottery that allowed the purchase of property in London, now on Great Russell Street. The original building was demolished and rebuilt during the first half of the 19th century. Small Egyptian items were initially part of the collection, but major Egyptian antiquities were acquired in 1802 with the surrender of objects, including the Rosetta Stone, collected by the French invaders of Egypt who were defeated by a combined British and Turkish force. Egyptian holdings then expanded with the purchase of individual collections, including those of Henry Salt in 1823, Joseph Sams in 1834, and Giovanni Anastasi in 1839, as well as items acquired at auction or by donation. The collection was further enhanced by the efforts of the keeper of Egyptian antiquities, E. A. Wallis Budge (1857–1934). Since 1882, the museum has received a share of the objects excavated by the Egypt Exploration Fund/Egypt Exploration Society. Since 1980, the British Museum has conducted its own excavations at Hermopolis and Tell el-Balamun. It houses one of the finest collections of Egyptian antiquities outside the Cairo Egyptian Museum.

BRONZE. An alloy of copper and tin. It is attested infrequently in Egypt before the Middle Kingdom, although some vessels from the tomb of Khasekhemwy of Dynasty 2 of the Early Dynastic Period are known from Abydos. Bronze gradually superceded the use of copper in the New Kingdom. It became the standard material for weapons, pins, vessels, and especially votive statues during the Late Period. See also GOLD; IRON; SILVER.
BRUCE, JAMES (1730–1794). British traveler. He was born in Kinnaird, Scotland, on 14 December 1730. He traveled extensively in Africa, visiting Egypt in 1768, where he toured the Valley of the Kings at Thebes. He entered the tomb of Ramesses III (KV3), which was thereafter known as Bruce’s tomb, and made drawings. Bruce later spent several years in Ethiopia, returning to Europe in 1773. His publication of his travels in 1790 contained the first engraving of a scene from a royal tomb. He died in Kinnaird on 27 April 1794.
BUBASTIS. Greek name for the Egyptian city of Per-Bastet, capital of the 18th nome of Lower Egypt, now Tell Basta. The principal deity worshipped in Bubastis was the cat-headed or lioness-headed goddess Bastet. Remains have been found from the Old Kingdom, but the town was most prominent in Dynasty 22, which is said to have originated there. It was excavated by a British expedition from the Egypt Exploration Fund from 1887–1889 and by Egyptian Egyptologists, notably Labib Habachi in 1939 and from 1943–1944, Shafik Farid from 1961–1967, Ahmad el-Sawi from 1967–1971, and more recently Muhammad Bakr since 1978 and a joint expedition of Zagazig University and Potsdam University since 1996.
BUCHIS. Sacred ram of the city of Armant. The Bucheum or catacombs of the rams were excavated from 1926–1932 by a British expedition sponsored by the Egypt Exploration Society and date from Dynasty 30 to the Roman Period. See also RELIGION.
BUDGE, SIR ERNEST ALFRED THOMPSON WALLIS (1857–1934). British orientalist. He was born in Bodmin, England, on 27 July 1857 of illegitimate birth. While working in London as a youth, he was attracted to the displays of the ancient Egyptian and

Assyrian world in the British Museum. His enthusiasm was noted by the then keeper of Oriental antiquities Samuel Birch, who raised enough money to send him to study the topic at the University of Cambridge. He joined the staff of the museum in 1883 and through intrigue managed to oust Keeper Renouf, Birch’s successor, and obtain his position in 1892. Budge proved an active collector of objects for the museum, establishing links with agents and dealers in antiquities in Egypt and Mesopotamia. He grudgingly accepted excavated material from the Egypt Exploration Fund and other sources and was opposed to Flinders Petrie’s ideas about the importance of archaeology. He wrote extensively and often hastily on Egyptian, Coptic, Assyrological, and Ethiopian topics and was well known as a popularizer of the subjects. Although completely outdated, his books are still being reprinted. Budge retired in 1924 and died in London on 23 November 1934.
BUHEN. Site in Nubia at the Second Cataract. The Egyptians had penetrated this far south during the Old Kingdom, where remains of copper-smelting production have been found. A major fort was constructed in the Middle Kingdom as part of the Egyptian garrison. The site and its vicinity were excavated by a British expedition from the Egypt Exploration Society from 1960–1965 before the area was flooded by Nasser Lake, the lake formed behind the Aswan High Dam. See also ANIBA; ASKUT; KUMMA; MIRGISSA; SEMNA; SHALFAK; URONARTI.
BUTO. Greek name for the Egyptian twin cities of Pe and Dep, also known as Per-Wadjet, modern Tell el-Farain. Ancient capital city of Lower Egypt whose principal deity was the cobra goddess Wadjet. Some remains can be traced from the Predynastic Period until Roman occupation. The site was briefly examined by Flinders Petrie in 1886 and excavated by Charles Currelly in 1904 and Veronica SetonWilliams for the Egypt Exploration Society from 1964–1968 but has since been examined more extensively by an Egyptian expedition and a German expedition since 1985.
BYBLOS. Major town and seaport on the eastern Mediterranean coast in modern Lebanon, ancient Gubla. It was the principal port through
42 • BUHEN



which timber and other goods were exported to Egypt from the Early Dynastic Period onward. Relations are attested in the Old Kingdom, Middle Kingdom, and New Kingdoms. The city became part of the Egyptian empire as a result of the campaigns of Thutmose III. Toward the end of Dynasty 18, Byblos was menaced by the aggressive intentions of the kings of Amurru, who had become Hittite vassals. This was reported in detail by King Rib-Hadda in the Amarna letters. The city escaped destruction by the Sea Peoples and is mentioned in the tale of Wenamun at the end of Dynasty 20 when Egyptian influence there was negligible due to the weakness of the Egyptian state. See also YANTIN.
BYZANTINE PERIOD (395–642 AD). The period during which Egypt was ruled from Constantinople by the eastern Roman emperor. The era is marked by increasing religious differences between the orthodox court and the Monophysite church in Egypt, which became increasingly nationalistic, eventually breaking away to form the separate Coptic Church. The period ended with the Arabic conquest of Egypt in 642 AD. See also RELIGION.

CAIRO EGYPTIAN MUSEUM. Established in 1862 by the Egyptian ruler Said at the request of Auguste Mariette, the head of the Antiquities Service, and opened at Bulaq in October 1863. It houses and preserves the largest and finest number of Egyptian antiquities in the world. The museum was filled with objects from Mariette’s excavations and subsequent work by Egyptian and foreign archaeologists. It supervised the division of antiquities agreed upon with foreign excavators and kept all important pieces in Egypt. In 1891, the museum was moved to Giza, and in 1902 it was again relocated to its present site in Cairo. A large selection of objects acquired in the 19th century and the early 20th century were published in a series of catalogs by international scholars. Masterpieces in the collection include the Narmer Palette, the statues of Khafre and Menkaure from Giza,

CAMBYSES (reigned 525–522 BC). Persian ruler, son of Cyrus, king of Persia and Mesopotamia. He carried out a successful invasion of Egypt in 525 BC, overthrowing Dynasty 26. The invasion caused some damage, although the extent of cannot be determined. Cambyses adopted a few Egyptian royal customs, including taking the throne name Mesutire, chosen by Udjahorresnet. He canceled many of the privileges of Egyptian temples and so became unpopular with the Egyptian priesthood. Later stories of his cruelty, including the murder of the Apis bull, cannot be substantiated and may be exaggerated. He was briefly succeeded by his supposed brother, Bardiya, and then his cousin, Darius I.
CANOPIC JARS. Modern term for the four jars in which the soft internal tissues of the deceased were stored after the mummification of the body. Canopic chests in which packages of these organs—the liver, lungs, stomach, and intestines—were placed are known from the early Old Kingdom, but actual jars with ovoid lids appeared slightly later. By the Middle Kingdom, the set of jars dedicated to the four sons of Horus had evolved. The jars were all originally human-headed, but by the New Kingdom they bore separate headshuman, baboon, jackal, and hawk. From Dynasty 21 onward, the internal organs were wrapped in packages and placed in the body, but the funerary equipment continued to include dummy canopic jars. The use of actual jars was revived in Dynasty 26. The term canopic derives from confusion with Canopus, a deity depicted as a humanheaded jar during the Graeco-Roman Period. See also AFTERLIFE; MUMMY.
CARACALLA (188–217 AD). Roman emperor. He was born on 4 April 188, the eldest son of Septimius Severus and Julia Domna. His original name appears to have been Lucius Septimius Bassianus, but
44 • CAMBYSES



he was renamed Marcus Aurelius Antoninus after his father’s accession. Caracalla was his nickname. Caracalla was named coemperor with his father on 28 January 198 and succeeded his father in 211 with his younger brother Geta, whose murder he ordered in late 211. Geta’s image has been erased from a relief in the temple of Esna. In the same year, he issued a proclamation granting Roman citizenship to all inhabitants of the empire to raise taxes. Caracalla conducted several military campaigns, notably an eastern war beginning in 215. He visited Egypt from December 215 to March/April 216 and massacred part of the population of Alexandria, whom he regarded as disrespectful. Caracalla was assassinated on the road between Edessa and Carrhae in Syria on 8 April 217.
CARTER, HOWARD (1874–1939). British excavator. He was born in London on 9 May 1874, the son of an artist who trained him in the trade. He was sent to Egypt in 1891 as an artist draughtsman at Beni Hasan by the Egypt Exploration Fund and later worked as an assistant to Flinders Petrie at Amarna and Deir el-Bahri. Carter was appointed chief inspector for Upper Egypt in 1899 and transferred to Lower Egypt in 1904 but left the Antiquities Service in 1905 after a disagreement. He was employed by the Earl of Carnarvon beginning in 1909 as an archaeologist in the Theban area, especially in the Valley of the Kings, where he made significant discoveries before finding the intact tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. Carter took 10 years to clear the tomb, but he lacked the academic background to undertake a definitive archaeological report on his work. His detailed notes are preserved in the Griffith Institute in Oxford, United Kingdom, and have been used to prepare a series of reports on groups of materials from the tomb. He died in London on 2 March 1939. See also MARIETTE, (FRANÇOIS) AUGUSTE FERDINAND; MONTET, (JEAN) PIERRE MARIE; NAVILLE, (HENRI) EDOUARD; REISNER, GEORGE ANDREW; WINLOCK, HERBERT EUSTIS.
CARTOUCHE. The modern French name used by Egyptologists to denote the ring that encircles the prenomen and nomen in the royal titulary, ancient Egyptian shenu. The identification of the cartouche as the marker of the royal name aided the decipherment of hieroglyphic writing.

CATARACT. The modern name for the rocky stone areas in the bed of the Nile that render navigation impossible. The First Cataract is situated just south of Elephantine, modern Aswan, and marks the original border between Egypt and Nubia. There are six numbered cataracts in the course of the Nile in Sudan before it divides into the White Nile and Blue Nile near Khartoum.
C-GROUP. The term invented by George Reisner and used by Egyptologists to designate the inhabitants of Lower Nubia during the late Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom. They may have been connected to the A-Group but were more likely a new more warlike people who moved north as the Egyptians abandoned Nubia during the First Intermediate Period. Their kingdoms are mentioned in texts of Dynasty 6. The northern regions were conquered by the Egyptians during the Middle Kingdom, while the southern part of Nubia evolved into the kingdom of Kerma or Kush, which reoccupied the north during the Second Intermediate Period and was finally conquered at the beginning of Dynasty 18.
CHAMPOLLION, JEAN-FRANÇOIS (1790–1832). French scholar. He was born in Figeac on 23 December 1790. He very early conceived the desire to decipher the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphic script and prepared himself by studying oriental languages, including Coptic. He eventually obtained an academic post in Grenoble, France, which gave him time to devote to his studies. Champollion first regarded the script as symbolic; however, Englishman Thomas Young demonstrated that the names of the Ptolemaic rulers were written alphabetically. Champollion later disingenuously claimed that he was unaware of Young’s research, but he adopted this approach and soon, with the help of such bilingual inscriptions as the Rosetta Stone, surpassed Young’s work. Champollion established that the hieroglyphic script was both alphabetic and pictographic and was able to read ancient Egyptian for the first time and realize that it was an older form of Coptic. He achieved widespread recognition for his work and in 1826 was appointed first curator of Egyptian antiquities at the Louvre Museum. From 1828–1829 he visited Egypt. Champollion was appointed professor of Egyptian history and archaeology at the Collège

CHRONOLOGY. The ancient Egyptian calendar consisted of a year of 360 days divided into the three seasons akhet (flood), peret (sowing) and shemu (harvest), plus five extra days at the end of the year. Each season was comprised of four months of 30 days and was in turn divided into three weeks of 10 days of 24 hours split between night and day. Because the calendar did not include the extra one-quarter day of the earth’s rotation, the civil calendar gradually diverged from the solar year so that the months moved, and the two only harmonized briefly every 1,460 years. The solar year was measured from the annual rising of the star Sirius, which becomes visible around July of each year in the modern calendar. A third calendar used for administrative purposes was the regnal year initially based on the biennial cattle count during the Old Kingdom and from the Middle Kingdom onward the king’s actual years, although his first year was foreshortened, so the beginning of his second might coincide with the beginning of the civil year. This practice was abandoned during the New Kingdom when the full regnal year was dated from the king’s accession, but calculation of the regnal year reverted to the old system during the Late Period. Thus three different dating systems—solar, civil, and regnal—were used during the New Kingdom. The conversion of Egyptian dates to the modern Julian calendar is not exact. Dating from the Late Period is fixed by synchronisms with Assyrian, Persian, Greek, and Roman dating systems. It is known that the solar and civil calendars coincided in 139 AD, thus the previous coincidence would have occurred 1,460 years earlierthe period being known as a Sothic cycle—but the use of astronomical references to the rising of the star Sirius are too unclear to be of use. The most effective method for determining chronology is through use of the detailed king lists known from such documents as
CHRONOLOGY • 47



the Palermo Stone or Turin Royal Canon or authors following Manetho supplemented by synchronisms with Mesopotamian or Hittite kings and astronomical dating when available. For earlier periods, radiocarbon dating has proved most useful. The chronology of ancient Egypt is under constant revision as new discoveries are made.
CLEOMENES (fl. c. 350–322 BC). Born in Naukratis, he was appointed the chief financial administrator of Egypt by Alexander the Great and soon became the leading power in the country. Cleomenes undertook the building of Alexandria. He was executed by Ptolemy I following his appointment as satrap in 322 BC.
CLEOPATRA I (c. 215–176 BC). Wife of Ptolemy V and daughter of Antiochus III, ruler of the Seleucid Empire, and Laodice of Pontus. She was engaged to Ptolemy V in 196 BC and married him in 194–193 BC as part of a peace settlement between Egypt and the Seleucid Empire. She had three children, including Cleopatra II, Ptolemy VI, and Ptolemy VIII. Upon the death of her husband in 180 BC, she acted as regent until her own death between April and July 176 BC.
CLEOPATRA II (c. 185–116 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I and wife of Ptolemy VI and Ptolemy VIII. She was married to her brother, Ptolemy VI, in April 176 BC and declared joint ruler of Egypt in 170 BC in the face of the threat of invasion by the Seleucid king Antiochus IV. When her husband was captured by the enemy, she and her younger brother, Ptolemy VIII, held out in Alexandria. Antiochus IV was forced to abandon Egypt under Roman pressure, and the joint rule of the three siblings was restored. In 164 BC, civil war broke out between the brothers, and Ptolemy VIII was expelled to Cyrene. Cleopatra II bore four children to Ptolemy VI, including Ptolemy Eupator, Ptolemy VII, Cleopatra Thea, and Cleopatra III. Her husband was killed in 145 BC, and she briefly acted as regent for her son, Ptolemy VII, until power was seized by her brother, Ptolemy VIII, who married her and murdered her son. Cleopatra bore her new husband one son, Ptolemy Memphites, but he soon preferred her daughter Cleopatra III. Civil war broke out between the spouses in 132 BC during which Ptolemy VIII murdered

his son, Memphites, before regaining control in 130 BC. Peace was eventually restored between the spouses in 124 BC, when Cleopatra II was recognized as senior queen. She is last recorded in 116 BC having survived her second husband.
CLEOPATRA III (c. 158–101 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. She became the second consort of her uncle, Ptolemy VIII, around 141 BC, which eventually led to a civil war between her mother, Cleopatra II, who was the first consort, and her husband. Peace was eventually restored in 124 BC. Cleopatra bore her husband five children, including Ptolemy IX, Ptolemy X, Cleopatra IV, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, and Cleopatra V Selene. Upon Ptolemy VIII’s death in 116 BC, she was given the choice of which son would rule with her. She preferred her younger son, Ptolemy X, but was forced by public pressure to accept her elder son, Ptolemy IX, who was eventually ousted in favor of his younger brother in 107 BC. This led to civil war between the rival kings in Cyprus and Syria. Cleopatra III died in 101 BC, allegedly murdered by her ungrateful son, Ptolemy X.
CLEOPATRA IV (d. 113 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. Consort of her brother, Ptolemy IX, who was forced to divorce her by their mother around 116 BC. Cleopatra IV fled to Cyprus and then Syria, where she married the Seleucid king Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. She was in Antioch in 113 BC when it fell to his rival, Antiochus VIII Grypus, whose wife, her sister Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, ordered her execution.
CLEOPATRA V SELENE (c. 140/35–69 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. Around 116 BC, she married her brother, Ptolemy IX, after he was forced by his mother to divorce his first wife and their sister, Cleopatra IV. She remained in Egypt when her husband was expelled in 107 BC, and in 103 BC she married her cousin, Antiochus VIII Grypus, ruler of Syria, son of her aunt Cleopatra Thea, and former husband of her sister, Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. Antiochus VIII Grypus was killed in 96 BC. Cleopatra Selene then married two further rulers of Syria, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus (d. 95 BC), cousin of her husband but also his maternal
CLEOPATRA V SELENE • 49



half brother through Cleopatra Thea and former husband of her other sister, Cleopatra IV, and finally her stepson, Antiochus X Eusebes (killed around 89 BC). She apparently had two sons by her first husband, whose fate is uncertain, and two sons by her last husband, who aspired to rule in Syria. Cleopatra Selene was captured during an invasion of Syria by Tigranes, king of Armenia, and executed in Seleucia-on-the-Tigris in 69 BC. Because the former Cleopatra V Tryphaena and Cleopatra VI Tryphaena are now regarded as identical, Cleopatra Selene is cited in more recent scholarship as Cleopatra V Selene.
CLEOPATRA VI TRYPHAENA (d. 57 BC). Wife of Ptolemy XII. Her origin is unknown, but she was presumably his sister or half sister and so daughter of Ptolemy IX. She evidently remained in the country when her husband was expelled in 58 BC and ruled jointly with her daughter, Berenice IV. Earlier scholars had supposed that the coruler was a sister of Berenice IV and counted Cleopatra V Tryphaena as the mother and Cleopatra VI Tryphaena as the daughter, but these two are now regarded as one and the same; the designation Cleopatra V has now been assigned to Cleopatra V Selene.
CLEOPATRA VII PHILOPATOR (c. 69–30 BC). Egyptian queen. Daughter of Ptolemy XII and possibly Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. She succeeded her father alongside her younger brother and consort, Ptolemy XIII, with whom she soon fell out. Their civil war was interrupted by the arrival in Egypt of Iulius Caesar who soon sided with Cleopatra and defeated her brother’s forces in 47 BC during a battle in which he was killed. Cleopatra VII Philopator was installed as ruler of Egypt with her younger brother, Ptolemy XIV, as consort, but she had become Caesar’s mistress and claimed him as the father of her son, Ptolemy Caesarion. She was in Rome in 44 BC when Caesar was assassinated and hurriedly returned to Egypt. Her brother soon died and was replaced as ruling pharaoh by her son as Ptolemy XV.
Cleopatra VII Philopator formed an alliance with Marcus Antonius, who was in charge of the eastern Roman Empire, and bore him three children. She used her intimacy with Antonius to aggrandize Egypt to the detriment of other eastern states. Their relationship gave

Antonius’s rival, Augustus, the opportunity to vilify him in Rome and declare war on Egypt as a threat to Rome. Egyptian forces were defeated at the battle of Actium in 31 BC and, after the fall of Alexandria in 30 BC, Cleopatra VII Philopator committed suicide rather than be taken captive to Rome. See also ALEXANDER HELIOS; ARSINOE IV; BERENICE IV; CLEOPATRA SELENE; PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS.
CLEOPATRA BERENICE III (d. 80 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy IX and Cleopatra IV. She became the official consort of her uncle, Ptolemy X, after he took over the throne from her father, and following the former’s deposition in 88 BC of her father Ptolemy IX. She became sole ruler of Egypt upon his death in 80 BC but was forced by the Romans to accept her first cousin and stepson, Ptolemy XI Alexander II, as her consort. He murdered her within days of their marriage in June 80 BC and was promptly killed himself.
CLEOPATRA SELENE (fl. c. 40 BC–11/7 AD). Daughter of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra VII. She was born in 40 BC with her twin brother, Alexander Helios. She was captured by Augustus in 30 BC and displayed in his triumph in Rome in 29 BC. She was brought up by Octavia, the sister of Augustus and Roman wife of Antonius, and married to King Juba II of Mauretania (modern Morocco) around 20 BC. Cleopatra Selene may have acted as regent for her husband during his absences from the kingdom, and she appears on his coinage. She had at least one son, King Ptolemy of Mauretania, who was executed by Caligula in 40 AD and is the last known descendant of the Ptolemaic dynasty.
CLEOPATRA THEA (c. 165–121/0 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. She was married in 150 BC to the Syrian pretender Alexander I Balas, who was installed as Seleucid ruler with the aid of his father-in-law, but the allies soon fell out. Cleopatra Thea was given to his rival, Demetrius II. Balas was defeated in battle by Ptolemy VI in 145 BC, after which he was killed and Ptolemy died of wounds. Demetrius II was captured in battle with the Parthians in 139 BC, and Cleopatra Thea married his brother, Antiochus VII Sidetes, who was himself killed in battle with the Parthians in 129
CLEOPATRA THEA • 51



BC. Demetrius II was restored but proved unpopular and was killed at Tyre in 126/125 BC. His widow ruled alone or in association with her sons by Demetrius II, Seleucus V (allegedly killed by her), and Antiochus VIII Grypus. She was apparently poisoned by her son in 121/120 BC after her attempt to murder him had failed. Her other son, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, by Antiochus VII, became a rival to his half brother, Antiochus VIII Grypus. Both brothers married Ptolemaic princesses, the former Cleopatra IV and Cleopatra Selene, and the latter Cleopatra Tryphaena and his brother’s widow, Cleopatra Selene.
CLEOPATRA TRYPHAENA (d. 112 BC). Daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. She married her first cousin, Seleucid king Antiochus VIII Grypus, son of Demetrius II and Cleopatra Thea, but he faced a rival in his half brother, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, who was married to Cleopatra IV, sister of Cleopatra Tryphaena. When Cleopatra IV was captured in 113 BC, she was executed at her sister’s behest. Cleopatra Tryphaena was then herself killed when she fell into the hands of Antiochus IX in 112 BC.

COMINIUS LEUGAS, CAIUS (fl. 18 AD). Roman explorer and discoverer of the mines at Mons Porphyrites. He built a sanctuary there in honor of the gods Pan (Egyptian Min) and Sarapis, in which he erected a black porphyry stela in 18 AD, indicating that he must have discovered the site that year or slightly earlier.
CONTENDINGS OF HORUS AND SETH, THE. A mythological story found in a single manuscript from the Ramesside Period written in the Late Egyptian form of the Egyptian language. Fragments of an earlier version of the text written in Middle Egyptian of the Middle Kingdom have been found at Lahun. The story relates the contest of Horus, son of Osiris, and Isis and his uncle Seth for the throne of Egypt in which Horus eventually triumphs. The text is notable for its depiction of the gods as foolish, quarrelsome, and incompetent.

COPPER. A metal used extensively by the Egyptians for tools, weapons, and vessels. Its use is attested in beads from the early Predynastic Period. Such rare copper statues as those of Pepy I and his son, Nemtyemsaf I, survive. Copper was found in the Eastern Desert, where copper-smelting activity has been uncovered at Ayn Sokha, Sinai at Wadi Maghara, Nubia near Buhen, and elsewhere. The metal was also mined at times by the Egyptians at Timna in the Negev Desert. It was often hardened by the use of arsenic. It was superceded by bronze from the Middle Kingdom. See also GOLD; IRON; SILVER.
COPTIC. The final phase of the Egyptian language and writing in which Greek script, with the addition of six new letters, was used to write ancient Egyptian. It is believed that the script was developed by Christians to spread their faith to the Egyptian populace. The script was used to translate Christian religious works, including the Bible, but also ordinary correspondence, business and legal texts, and funerary and other inscriptions in stone. Following the Arabic conquest in 642 AD, Coptic was gradually superseded by Arabic and fell out of use by the 16th century, with the exception of certain religious phrases no longer understood by the priests or general population. European scholars learned the language from exported Biblical and other religious manuscripts but were unaware that it was ancient Egyptian until the decipherment of the hieroglyphic script. Knowledge of Coptic greatly aided in the decoding and understanding of ancient Egyptian. See also CHAMPOLLION, JEAN-FRANÇOIS.
COPTIC CHURCH. Egyptian Christianity developed during the 1st century AD under the patriarch of Alexandria. The Coptic script was used to translate the Holy Scriptures and religious works. Strains soon appeared between the orthodox formula for the nature of Christ, which was two natures—human and divine intermingled—as set down by the councils of Nicaea in 334 and Chalcedon in 454, and the belief in Egypt of one divine nature known as Monophysitism. After failing to find a compromise, the Byzantine emperors, with the support of the Roman popes, sought to impose orthodoxy in Egypt, leading to a schism when a Coptic patriarch of Alexandria was
COPTIC CHURCH • 53



elected in opposition to the orthodox one. Most Egyptians supported the Coptic church, and their loyalty to the emperor was weakened, facilitating the Arab conquest. This in turn led to the eventual decline of the native church, since large parts of the population eventually converted to Islam, and the Coptic language was replaced by Arabic. The Coptic church is more vigorous at present than it was for several centuries. See also BENJAMIN; RELIGION.
COPTIC MUSEUM. This museum was founded in 1902 through the efforts of Marcus Simaika Pasha and established in its current position in Old Cairo in 1908. It was taken over by the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1931 and enlarged in 1947. The collection contains more than 14,000 objects from the Coptic Period, including stone sculptures, frescoes, icons, textiles, ivory objects, wood, metal, ceramic, and such important manuscripts as the Nag Hammadi Codices.
COPTOS. Greek name for a site in northern Upper Egypt, modern Qift. Ancient Egytian Gebtu, capital of the fifth Upper Egyptian nome. The chief deity of the town was the fertility god Min, who was also regarded as the god of the Eastern Desert. The town was an important center for expeditions into the desert to the stone quarries or to the Red Sea coast to connect to trade routes to Punt and other key locations. The temple that survives there dates to the Ptolemaic Period with Roman additions, but earlier remains have been found that date back to the Early Dynastic Period. The site was partly excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1893–1894 and a French expedition from 1910–1911. Further excavations took place from 1987–1992 by an American expedition from the University of Michigan, and a French team has been working the area since 2002. See also BERENIKE; MYOS HORMOS; WADI HAMMAMAT.
COREGENCY. A system of dual rule that was devised to ensure the automatic transfer of power to the junior ruler upon the death of the elder. It seems to have first been employed by Amenemhat I, who made his son, Senusret I, a joint ruler, although in this case the succession was disputed. Two types of coregency are known whereby the junior partner has a full royal titulary and regnal dates or simply the titulary and no separate year dates until his succession as sole

ruler. Coregencies have complicated the determination of the exact chronology of rulers as they are not always attested clearly or taken account of in the surviving king lists. Some coregencies proposed by some modern Egyptologists like that between Amenhotep III and Akhenaten are disputed.
CORNELIUS GALLUS, CAIUS (c. 70–26 BC). Roman poet and official. First prefect of Egypt from 30–26 BC. He took part in the Egyptian campaign of Augustus and was put in charge of the newly conquered province of Egypt. He suppressed a revolt in Thebes. His inscriptions praising his own deeds annoyed the emperor, and he was recalled and forced to commit suicide in 26 BC. See also PETRONIUS, PUBLIUS.
CORNELIUS SCIPIO AEMILIANUS AFRICANUS, PUBLIUS (d. 129 BC). Roman general. He was born 185/184 BC, son of Lucius Aemilus Paulus, conqueror of Macedonia, and Papiria and was adopted by Publius Cornelius Scipio, a son of the conqueror of Hannibal. He was consul in 147 BC and led the campaign that destroyed Carthage in 146 BC. He visited Alexandria in 140/139 BC as part of a Roman delegation to the East and met with Ptolemy VIII. The Romans were taken aback by the extravagance of the Ptolemaic court and the demeanor of the king, whom they persuaded to walk through the city with them to the surprise of his subjects.

CYRENE. An area of eastern Libya colonized by Greek settlers c. 630 BC. An independent dynasty emerged but later recognized the suzerainty of Cambyses and subsequently Alexander the Great. First ruled by Ptolemy I, Cyrene became sovereign again, but the country was annexed to Egypt through the marriage of Berenice II to Ptolemy III. It briefly became independent once again under Ptolemy VIII before his accession and under Ptolemy Apion, the illegitimate son of Ptolemy VIII, who died childless in 96 BC and left his kingdom to Rome.
CYRENE • 55



CYRIL (c. 378–444 AD). Patriarch of Alexandria. He was the son of the sister of the patriarch Theophilus and was born in Theodosiu c. 378 and educated at the monastery of Deir Anba Macarius in the Nitrian Valley. He became a priest in Alexandria and succeeded his uncle as patriarch in 412. Cyril was a vigorous opponent of Neoplatonism and Nestorianism and took a leading part in the Council of Ephesus in 431, when the teachings of Nestorius were condemned as heresy. He died in Alexandria on 27 June 444 and was succeeded by Dioscorus. See also ATHANASIUS; BENJAMIN; COPTIC CHURCH; CYRUS.
CYRUS (d. 642 AD). Byzantine official. Bishop of Phasis in the Caucasus until 631, when he was named by Emperor Heraclius as prefect of Egypt and patriarch of Alexandria in opposition to the Coptic Church and its patriarch, Benjamin. He was entrusted with putting an end to dissension by enforcing orthodoxy in Egypt, and he attempted to carry out this policy with ruthless persecution of the Copts, though he was unsuccessful. Cyrus faced the Arabic invasion in 641 and was forced to agree by a treaty on 8 November 641 to surrender Alexandria and Egypt to the invaders and withdraw imperial forces the following year. He died in Alexandria on 21 March 642 before the end of Byzantine rule in the city. See also ATHANASIUS; BYZANTINE PERIOD; CYRIL; DIOSCORUS; THEOPHILUS.

DAHSHUR. Modern name for the area south of Saqqara where several royal tombs from Dynasty 4, Dynasty 12, and Dynasty 13 are located. Two pyramids, the Bent and the Red, are assigned to Snefru and were the first built as true pyramids from the start. The pyramids of Amenemhat II, Senusret III, and Amenemhat III are also located here, as well as the tombs of queens and princesses from which much fine jewelry has been excavated. The tomb of King Hor of Dynasty 13 has also been discovered. The area was excavated by the French from 1894–1895; the Egyptians under Ahmad Fakhry from 1951–1955; and the German Archaeological Institute, later taken over by the Metropolitan Museum of Art beginning in 1980,

DAKHLA OASIS. An oasis in the Western Desert west of Luxor. Excavations have uncovered remains possibly from the Early Dynastic Period and from the Old Kingdom to the Byzantine Period. The site was visited by Herbert Winlock in 1908 and again examined by Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry from 1968–1972. A settlement and tombs from Dynasty 6 have been excavated at Balat by a French expedition since 1977, while a joint Canadian–Australian expedition has conducted a survey and excavations in the oasis since 1978 and found a Roman and Byzantine town site and associated temples at Ismant el-Kharb, which has yielded documentary and literary texts on papyrus and wooden tablets. The site of the main temple at Mut elKharb, the later capital of the oasis, has been under investigation since 2001, and remains have been found from the New Kingdom to the Graeco-Roman Period. An American expedition is now working at the site of Amheida. See also BAHARIYA OASIS; FARFARA OASIS; KHARGA OASIS; SIWA OASIS.
DARIUS I (reigned 522–486 BC). King of Persia and ruler of Egypt. Throne name in Egypt Setutre. Son of Hystaspes and Rhodogune. He supposedly came from a junior line of the royal family. He accompanied Cambyses on his conquest of Egypt. Darius I seized the throne in September 522 after the ephemeral reign of Bardiya, alleged brother of Cambyses, whom Darius denounced as an imposter. His forces spent the early years of his rule resisting revolts in the empire, including Egypt, which he may have visited c. 518 BC and perhaps on a second occasion. He ordered the codification of Egyptian law and the completion of a canal between the Nile and Red Sea begun by Nekau II. Darius I is best known for his military campaign in Greece, which resulted in the defeat of the Persians at the battle of Marathon in 490 BC. There appears to have been further unrest in Egypt at the end of his reign. He died in October 486 and was succeeded by his son, Xerxes I, born to his chief wife Atossa, daughter of Cyrus and sister of Cambyses.
DARIUS II (reigned 423–404 BC). Personal name Ochus. King of Persia and ruler of Egypt. Illegitimate son of Artaxerxes I. He

succeeded to the throne after the ephemeral reigns of his brothers Xerxes II and Sogdianus. He then married his half sister, Parysatis. Darius II faced a major revolt in Egypt toward the end of his reign led by Amyrtaeos.
DARIUS III (reigned in Egypt 336–332 BC). King of Persia and ruler of Egypt. Original name Codomanus. Son of Arsames, an alleged grandson of Darius II, and Sisygambis. He distinguished himself in battle during the reign of Artaxerxes III. He was put on the throne by Bagoas after the murder of Arses and then executed the ambitious minister. Darius III faced the invasion of Alexander the Great, who defeated his forces at Granicus in 334 BC and Issus in 333 BC, when he was present. He lost Egypt in 332 BC when his satrap, Mazaces, surrendered without a struggle. After a further defeat at Gaugamela in 331 BC, he fled to eastern Iran, where he was murdered in 330 BC by rebellious nobles.
DEIR EL-BAHRI. Modern name for a site on the cliffs of the western bank of the Nile opposite Thebes. It was apparently first used to construct the tomb and mortuary temple of Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11 and the tombs of his successors, as well as the chief officials of the court. During Dynasty 18 it was chosen as the site of the mortuary temple of Queen Hatshepsut, the building of which was supervised by her official, Senenmut. The temple is well preserved and is famous for its reliefs of the expedition to Punt and the transportation of an obelisk. Next to Deir el-Bahri a mortuary temple was constructed by Thutmose III, but this shrine has been largely destroyed by an earthquake, leaving only a pillared hall with Hathor capitals and a chapel. The site became a Coptic monastery during the Christian period but was later abandoned. Deir el-Bahri was first excavated by Auguste Mariette in 1850, 1862, and 1866. Major excavations were undertaken in the Hatshepsut temple from 1893–1896 and the Mentuhotep II temple from 1903–1907 by a British expedition of the Egypt Exploration Fund. Further work in the area was carried out by Herbert Winlock of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1911–1931. The Mentuhotep II temple was reexamined by a German expedition from 1965–1972, and the Hatshepsut temple has been the subject of excavation and

restoration work by a Polish team since 1961, during which time the Thutmose III temple was also discovered.
DEIR EL-BALLAS. Modern name for a site in Upper Egypt north of Thebes where the remains of a major royal palace and town have been discovered. The area appears to have been occupied at the end of Dynasty 17 and the beginning of Dynasty 18. It was partially excavated by George Reisner from 1900–1902, and work has more recently been carried out by an expedition from the Boston Museum of Fine Arts since 1980.
DEIR EL-BERSHA. Modern name for a site in Middle Egypt on the east bank of the Nile near Hermopolis. The most important features of the area are the rock-cut tombs of the governors of the 15th nome of Upper Egypt from Dynasty 12, notably the tomb of Djehutihotep, which features a scene of the transport of a colossal seated statue from the quarry at Hatnub. The tombs were excavated and copied by expeditions of the Egypt Exploration Fund from 1891–1892, the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1897 and from 1900–1902, and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1915 and 1990. The area has been investigated by a Belgian expedition since 2002.
DEIR EL-GABRAWI. Modern name for a site in Middle Egypt on the east bank of the Nile north of Asyut where the governors of the 12th nome of Upper Egypt were buried in rock-cut tombs during Dynasty 6. Some of the scenes in one tomb served as a model for similar scenes in a tomb at Thebes dated to the Saite Period. The tombs were copied by Norman de Garis Davies in 1900 and in 2004 by an Australian expedition.
DEIR EL-MEDINA. Modern name for the site of the workmen’s village on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes near the Valley of the Kings. The village was founded either by Amenhotep I, who was worshipped there as a god, or his successor, Thutmose I, whose name appears on bricks at the site. The workmen were organized to construct the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings, but little material has survived from Dynasty 18 apart from several tombs of such workmen as the foreman Kha, whose tomb was found intact, and
DEIR EL-MEDINA • 59



some stelae. The village may have been abandoned during the reign of Akhenaten but was certainly in operation under Tutankhamun and reorganized during the reign of Horemheb. Much material survives from the Ramesside Period, including stelae, papyri, ostraca, and tombs that give a detailed picture of community life. Deir el-Medina was under the direct control of the southern vizier but was effectively governed by the two foremen of each side of the workforce, which was divided into two sections, and the scribe or scribes. Local disputes were settled in the village court made up of the chief men of the village, but criminal cases were sent to the vizier. The workmen were supplied with payments of wheat and beer and other commodities, and surviving daybooks show that the work period was not overly onerous and there was generous time off. In their spare time the workmen prepared material for their own tombs and accepted commissions for tomb equipment from outside the community. The village possessed a series of small chapels in which such gods and goddesses as Amun and Meretseger were worshipped by the workmen themselves in the roles of priests. The village was abandoned at the end of Dynasty 20 when royal burials ceased and conditions deteriorated due to Libyan raids. Some workmen remained at Medinet Habu and took part in the preparation of the royal caches during Dynasty 21.
The site was discovered in the early 19th century, and objects were acquired by several museum collections, notably the British Museum, Louvre Museum, and Turin Egyptian Museum. Deir elMedina was excavated by an Italian expedition from Turin from 1905–1906 and in 1909, a German expedition in 1913, and since 1917 has been excavated and published by the French Institute in Cairo.

DEIR EL-NAQLUN. A Coptic monastic site in the Fayum consisting of a monastery and hermitages with a church dedicated to the archangel Gabriel. Since 1986, Deir el-Naqlun has been excavated by a Polish expedition and, apart from architectural remains, it has yielded much documentary evidence.

DEMOTIC. Term derived from the Greek for the cursive Egyptian script, which was derived from and then superseded hieratic from the Saite Period. It was used primarily on papyri and ostraca but also occasionally on carved stone, notably the Rosetta Stone. Use of the script declined following the Roman conquest as it was no longer recognized in the courts and solely used by priests. The last known text has been found in the temple of Philae dated to 452 AD. See also HIEROGLYPHIC.
DEN (reigned c. 2985 BC). Fifth king of Dynasty 1. Successor and probably son of Djet and Queen Merneith, who may have acted as regent for her son. His tomb has been excavated at Abydos, and among the finds were ivory labels that showed the king in various poses, including smiting Asiatics. See also ANEDJIB.
DENDERA. Modern name for the Egyptian city of Iunet, later known as Tentyris in Greek, capital of the sixth nome of Upper Egypt. The site is known from the Early Dynastic Period, and there are tombs from the First Intermediate Period, when the regional rulers were semi-independent. Its main feature is the magnificent Graeco-Roman temple dedicated to the goddess Hathor, from which came the famous Dendera zodiac now in the Louvre Museum. The site was excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1897–1898 and the University of Pennsylvania from 1915–1918. The temple inscriptions are being published by a French expedition. See also EDFU; ESNA; KOM OMBO.

DIET. The main food items in ancient Egypt were bread and beer. Depending on wealth, the diet could be supplemented by fish from the Nile; such fowl as ducks and geese, either domestic or killed in the wild; and meat in the form of cattle, sheep, or goats. Chickens were not introduced until the New Kingdom. The evidence indicating the existence of pigs is inconsistent since they are clearly attested during the Predynastic Period at Kahun during the Middle Kingdom and at Amarna during the New Kingdom, and they are depicted in some tombs, but religious texts imply that the eating of pig meat was taboo. Their use becomes more evident during the Graeco-Roman Period. Such vegetables as onions, garlic, radishes, beans, lentils, and lettuce were available, as were some fruit trees, including as date, fig, pomegranate, and persea. Vineyards produced wine for the upper classes. A sweetener was provided by bee honey. See also AGRICULTURE.
DIOCLETIAN (reigned 284–305 AD). Roman emperor. Original name Diocles. Full name Gaius Aurelius Valerius Diocletianus. Born in Dalmatia on 22 December 243/245, he joined the army and rose to the rank of commander of the Royal Bodyguard. Upon the mysterious death of the Emperor Numerian, he was proclaimed emperor on 20 November 284. In a series of campaigns, Diocletian reunited the empire under his rule. In 298, he crushed the revolt of Lucius Domitius Domitianus in Alexandria. Diocletian reorganized the empire and instituted the system of two emperors with a Caesar to assist each. He also undertook the systematic persecution of Christians in an attempt to restore old Roman values. Diocletian abdicated on 1 May 305 and retired to Salonae, where he saw the empire relapse into civil war among his successors. He died in Salonae on 3 December 316 or possibly 311.

whom he succeeded in 444. Dioscorus soon came into conflict with the pope in Rome when he headed the Second Council of Ephesus in 449 over the issue of Monophysitism. Here his opponent, the patriarch of Constantinople. Flavian, was deposed and died soon after as a result of ill treatment by Egyptian monks in the entourage of Dioscorus. The orthodox view was reaffirmed at the Council of Chalcedon in 451, and Dioscorus was deposed and exiled to Gangra in Paphlagonia. The decisions of the Council of Chalcedon and the deposition of the Alexandrian patriarch increased the tension between the Coptic population of Egypt, who supported their patriarch and the imperial power in Constantinople, which led to continued dissension in Egypt. See also ATHANASIUS; BENJAMIN; COPTIC CHURCH; CYRIL; CYRUS; THEOPHILUS.
DIOSCORUS (c. 520–585 AD). Egyptian landholder, lawyer, and poet. He was the son of Apollos, village headman of Aphrodito in Middle Egypt, modern Kom Ishgaw, and later founder and monk of the monastery of Apa Apollos. He received a good classical education, probably at Alexandria, and pursued a legal career during which he visited Constantinople. Many of his papers, which include both documentary and literary texts of his own composition written in Greek and Coptic, were discovered from 1901–1907 and are now divided among several museum collections.
DIVINE BIRTH. According to the official theology, each ruler of ancient Egypt was a son of the chief god of the period who impregnated the queen mother. This belief was reflected in the Westcar Papyrus, where the first three rulers of Dynasty 5 are described as the sons of Re. During the New Kingdom, the mother of Hatshepsut is depicted being embraced by the god Amun in reliefs at Deir el-Bahri, and the mother of Amenhotep III is shown in a similar position in the temple of Luxor. See also RELIGION.
DJEDEFRE (reigned c. 2566–2558 BC). Variant Redjedef. Eldest son and successor of Khufu of Dynasty 4. He is apparently mentioned in the destroyed section of the Westcar Papyrus. Djedefre’s reign is obscure, and he is mainly known from his funerary pyramid at Abu Roash. He was succeeded by his brother, Khafre.

DJEDHOR (reigned 361–362 BC). The Greek form of his name is given as Tachos or Teos. Throne name Irmaatenre. Epithet setepenanhur. Second ruler of Dynasty 30. Son of Nakhtnebef. Upon his accession, he embarked on a military campaign against Persia in Asia financed by a heavy levy on temples to pay his expenses, including Greek mercenaries. Djedhor left his brother, Tjaihapimu, as regent in Egypt, but the latter’s son, Nakhthorheb, revolted against his uncle and won over the army, whereupon Djedhor fled to Persia.
DJEDKARE (reigned c. 2414–2375 BC). Personal name Isesi. Penultimate ruler of Dynasty 5. His pyramid at Saqqara was discovered in 1880, but the owner remained unidentified until an Egyptian expedition in 1945. Further work was carried out in the 1950s and 1980s, and a French expedition began work on the site in 2000. The pyramid complex has not yet been fully published. See also MENKAUHOR; UNAS.
DJEHUTY (fl. 1460 BC). A leading general of Thutmose III who took part in his wars in the Levant. He is the hero of the tale The Taking of Joppa, in which his soldiers took this seaport by hiding in large jars, thus secretly gaining access to the fortress.
DJER (reigned c. 3050 BC). Third king of Dynasty 1. Successor and probable son of Aha. His mother was Khenethap. His tomb has been excavated at Abydos, and among the finds was an arm with fine jewelry of the period. His tomb was later identified as the tomb of Osiris. See also DJET.
DJET (reigned c. 3000 BC). Fourth king of Dynasty 1. Successor of Djer. His tomb has been excavated at Abydos, and among the finds was a finely carved stela with the royal name written as a serpent, now in the Louvre Museum. His son and successor, Den, may have been a child upon his accession, as Djer’s wife, Merneith, appears to have acted as regent.

This stretch of the Nile river was under the control of Egypt during most of the Ptolemaic Period, except from around about 207–160s BC, when it was occupied by Meroe. Under Ptolemy VI, Egyptian control briefly extended to the Second Cataract. Dodekaschoenus was awarded to Roman Egypt under the peace treaty negotiated by Publius Petronius in 21 BC. The income tax here supported the priesthood at Philae. The area was abandoned by Rome during the reign of Diocletian.
DOMITIANUS, LUCIUS DOMITIUS. A rival emperor to Diocletian. He is known only from papyri but appears to have a led a revolt from August to December 297 centered in Alexandria. Literary sources record a revolt by a certain Aurelius Achilles in Alexandria at this time, who may have been Domitianus’s supporter and successor. The revolt was crushed by early 298, and both men must have perished as a result.
DROVETTI, BERNARDINO MICHELE MARIA (1776–1852). French soldier and diplomat of Italian extraction. He was born in Barbania, Piedmont, Italy, on 4 January 1776. When Italy came under French control under Napoleon, he joined the French army, and he was later promoted to French vice consul in Alexandria in 1802, although he did not arrive there until 1803. He became vice consul general in Egypt in 1806 and then consul general in 1811. Drovetti was dismissed in 1814 after the fall of Napoleon, but he remained in Egypt as a private businessman until being reappointed as consul from 1821–1829. He became an avid collector of Egyptian antiquities and financed agents to collect or dig for objects mostly at Saqqara and Thebes. Drovetti has been harshly depicted by Giovanni Battista Belzoni, who saw his men as rivals. His first collection was sold in 1824 and became the foundation for the Turin Egyptian Museum, and his second went to the Louvre Museum in 1827, while his third was acquired by the Berlin Egyptian Museum in 1836. He died in Turin, Italy, on 9 March 1852.

DUAMUTEF. See SONS OF HORUS.
DUATENTOPET (fl. 1150 BC). Queen of Ramesses IV of Dynasty 20. She was buried in QV73 in the Valley of the Queens.
DUDIMOSE (reigned c. 1674 BC). Throne name Djedneferre. One of the last rulers of Dynasty 13. He is generally identified with the ruler Tutimaios, mentioned by the historian Josephus probably following Manetho, during whose reign the Hyksos seized power in Egypt. However, it has recently been suggested that the passage in Josephus does not contain a royal name and Dudimose should be assigned to Dynasty 16. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
DYNASTIES. The Egyptian writer Manetho divided Egyptian rulers into numbered dynasties or families. His original manuscript apparently contained 30 dynasties, and later copyists seemingly added Dynasty 31, the later Persian kings, but the Macedonian and Ptolemaic kings and Roman emperors were never part of the numbered sequence. This concept of dynastic tabulation has been followed by modern Egyptologists. The concept appears already in use during the Ramesside Period in the Turin Royal Canon.
DYNASTY 0 (c. 3500–3100 BC). The designation given by Egyptologists to those kings of Upper Egypt before the official union of Egypt. They are attested mostly by their tombs at Abydos. It is not clear how much of Lower Egypt they controlled. The system of hieroglyphic writing had not developed sufficiently for their names to be clearly read, so they are known by their royal symbols, for example, King Scorpion.
DYNASTY 1 (c. 3100–2890 BC). First dynasty of the Archaic or Early Dynastic Period. Stated by Manetho to comprise eight kings of Thinis, the dynasty was founded by the legendary Menes, the first king of united Egypt. All can be identified from later king lists. The royal seal of Dynasty 1, recently discovered at Abydos, confirms the order of the first five kings beginning with Narmer, who may be identified with Menes. The kings were buried at Abydos and their high officials at Saqqara.
66 • DUAMUTEF



DYNASTY 2 (c. 2890–2686 BC). Stated by Manetho to comprise nine kings of Thinis. The names given by Manetho and earlier king lists are difficult to reconcile with those on contemporary inscriptions. The rulers were buried either at Saqqara or in the royal cemetery at Abydos.
DYNASTY 3 (c. 2686–2613 BC). Stated by Manetho to comprise nine kings of Memphis. Very little is known about this dynasty, the most famous ruler being Djoser, for whose burial the step pyramid was allegedly designed by Imhotep. These rulers were buried at Saqqara. This dynasty is usually considered to mark the beginning of the Old Kingdom.
DYNASTY 4 (c. 2613–2494 BC). Sometimes considered the first dynasty of the Old Kingdom. Stated by Manetho to consist of eight kings of Memphis belonging to a different line. Most of these rulers can be identified from contemporary monuments and later king lists, although the number varies. The rulers include Snefru, who built two pyramids at Dahshur, and Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure, the builders of the three pyramids at Giza.
DYNASTY 5 (c. 2494–2345 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of eight kings from Elephantine, although he names nine. All nine are easily identifiable on monuments and later king lists. They were buried in pyramids at Abusir and Saqqara, notably Unas, whose pyramid was the first to be inscribed.
DYNASTY 6 (c. 2345–2181 BC). Stated by Manetho to comprise six kings of Memphis. The first five, notably Pepy II, are all identifiable from contemporary monuments and later king lists. They were buried in pyramids at Saqqara. The last, Nitocris, is known from the Turin Royal Canon and later legend.
DYNASTY 7 (c. 2181 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of 70 kings of Memphis who reigned for 70 days. No rulers have been identified, and the entire dynasty may be nonexistent.
DYNASTY 8 (c. 2181–2125 BC). Stated by Manetho to comprise 27 kings of Memphis who reigned for 146 years. This dynasty, or the
DYNASTY 8 • 67



preceding if it existed, marks the beginning of the First Intermediate Period. A number of rulers are known from king lists.
DYNASTY 9 (c. 2160–2130 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of 19 kings of Herakleopolis who reigned for 146 years. See also DYNASTY 10.
DYNASTY 10 (c. 2130–2040 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of 19 kings of Herakleopolis who reigned for 185 years. The numbers and figures for Dynasty 9 and Dynasty 10 are dubious. The Turin Royal Canon seems to list 18 rulers for both dynasties, but they are ignored on other king lists. Contemporary monuments mention kings with the name of Khety, and Merykare is known from literature. Dynasty 10 was contemporary in part with Dynasty 11 and was overthrown by Mentuhotep II.
DYNASTY 11 (c. 2125–1985 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of 16 kings of Thebes who reigned for 43 years. Only seven kings are known, although the first king, Mentuhotep I, never reigned but was honored with the royal title by his descendants. The family may have originally been governors of Thebes, but independence was probably declared by Intef I, who adopted the royal title. Mentuhotep II reunited Egypt and inaugurated the Middle Kingdom. The later kings were buried at Deir el-Bahri.
DYNASTY 12 (c. 1985–1795 BC). Stated by Manetho to comprise seven kings of Thebes. There were in fact eight, as the founder, Amenemhat I, was erroneously mentioned by Manetho under Dynasty 11. Much detail on this dynasty is preserved in the Turin Royal Canon and on many contemporary monuments. The dynasty moved its capital to Itjtawy, modern Lisht, and the kings were buried in pyramids in the Fayum area and Dahshur.
DYNASTY 13 (c. 1795–1650 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of 60 kings of Thebes who reigned for 453 years. With this dynasty began the Second Intermediate Period. Manetho’s numbers and total of years are clearly inaccurate, but the Turin Royal Canon reveals a long list of kings, many with short reigns. Many rulers can be identified from contemporary monuments.
68 • DYNASTY 9



DYNASTY 14 (c. 1750–1650 BC). Stated by Manetho to comprise 76 kings of Xois who reigned for 184 years. Nothing is known of this dynasty, which was probably contemporary with Dynasty 13 in part. Some of the minor Hyksos kings have recently been assigned to this dynasty rather than Dynasty 16. Manetho’s figures are again suspect.
DYNASTY 15 (c. 1650–1550 BC). The dynasty of the Hyksos. Stated by Manetho to comprise six kings, although the figures for this dynasty vary in different versions from 250 to 284 years. The Turin Royal Canon gives a more accurate assessment of 108 years. Few monuments survive, but most kings can be identified from scarabs or other references, notably Khayan and Apepi.
DYNASTY 16 (c. 1650–1580 BC). The surviving sources of Manetho are confused regarding this dynasty. Versions range from 32 Hyksos rulers reigning for 518 years to five kings of Thebes reigning for 190 years. Some Egyptologists assign minor Hyksos chieftains, probably contemporary with Dynasty 15, to this dynasty, but more recently it has been suggested that some of the Theban rulers previously listed in Dynasty 17 should be listed here.
DYNASTY 17 (c. 1580–1550 BC). The versions of Manetho are confused, sometimes identifying this dynasty with Dynasty 15 or naming 43 kings of Thebes. Egyptologists place here some of the rulers of Thebes before the reunification of Egypt under Dynasty 18, many of which are known from the Turin Royal Canon or contemporary monuments.
DYNASTY 18 (c. 1550–1295 BC). The first dynasty of the New Kingdom starting with Ahmose I, who drove out the Hyksos and reunified Egypt. Manetho names 14 or 16 kings of Thebes, but his names are not all identifiable with evidence from contemporary monuments, which yield detailed information on 14 rulers.
DYNASTY 19 (c. 1295–1186 BC). The famous Ramesside dynasty founded by Ramesses I. The sources for Manetho name five kings of Thebes reigning for 194 to 209 years, but Ramesses I is usually misplaced in Dynasty 18. Contemporary monuments yield eight rulers.
DYNASTY 19 • 69



DYNASTY 20 (c. 1186–1069 BC). Manetho names 12 kings of Thebes reigning for 135 years. Contemporary monuments name 10 kings from the founder, Sethnakhte, to Ramesses XI. With the exception of the first ruler, all kings bore the dynastic name Ramesses. The rulers were all buried in the Valley of the Kings, except the last, whose tomb was unfinished.
DYNASTY 21 (c. 1069–945 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of seven kings of Tanis reigning for 130 years. Most can be identified from contemporary sources. The dynasty was founded by Nesbanebdjed (Smendes), ruler of Tanis, but he apparently only ruled the north of the country, while the south was virtually independent under the high priest of Amun at Thebes. Some royal burials have been discovered at Tanis.
DYNASTY 22 (c. 945–715 BC). The Libyan dynasty founded by Sheshonq I. Stated by Manetho to consist of nine kings of Bubastis reigning for 120 years. Nine kings with the names of Sheshonq, Osorkon, and Takelot can be identified from contemporary monuments, but the situation is confused, as Dynasty 23 was in part contemporary with Dynasty 22, and other local rulers also assumed pharaonic titularies. The royal burials have been discovered at Tanis.
DYNASTY 23 (c. 818–715 BC). Manetho’s excerptors name three kings of Tanis reigning for 44 years or four kings reigning for 89 years. This dynasty was wholly contemporary with Dynasty 22 and appears to have consisted of local rulers of Libyan origin, possibly offshoots of the previous dynasty, who became independent. The first ruler, Pedubast I, and the second, Osorkon III, are easily identifiable from contemporary monuments. It is not clear exactly where their capital city was located, but they were recognized in Thebes.
DYNASTY 24 (c. 727–715 BC). Stated by the copyists of Manetho to comprise one king of Sais, Bocchoris, who reigned for six or 44 years. The former figure is probably more accurate. That king, whose Egyptian name was Bakenrenef, is known from contemporary sources, but Egyptologists also include his predecessor, Tefnakhte, in this dynasty.
70 • DYNASTY 20



DYNASTY 25 (c. 747–656 BC). Manetho names three Nubian rulers, Shabaqo, Shebitqo, and Taharqo, who reigned for 40 or 44 years. Contemporary monuments confirm these three kings, as well as two previous rulers, Kashta and Piye, and a final one, Tantamani, whose rule was recognized in parts of Egypt.
DYNASTY 26 (664–525 BC). Manetho names nine rulers of Sais reigning for 150 to 167 years, of whom the first three appear to have been only local rulers of Sais. The first authenticated member of the dynasty was Nekau I (d. 664 BC), and his son, Psamtik I, was the first to rule a reunited Egypt. The later kings are well attested on contemporary monuments and documents. Dynasty 26 was overthrown by the invasion of King Cambyses of Persia in 525 BC.
DYNASTY 27 (525–404 BC). The kings of Persia who ruled in Egypt from Cambyses to Darius II. Manetho lists eight kings reigning for 120 or 124 years and four months, but the names vary slightly in his copyists. The kings are known from some monuments in Egypt and Persian and classical sources.
DYNASTY 28 (404–399 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of Amyrtaeos of Sais, who reigned for six years. The king is known from contemporary classical sources. He was evidently deposed by the founder of the succeeding dynasty.
DYNASTY 29 (399–380 BC). Manetho lists four kings of Mendes who reigned for 21 years and four months but actually gives five names. Some of the kings, like Nefaarud and Hakor, are known from contemporary documentation.
DYNASTY 30 (380–343 BC). Stated by Manetho to consist of three kings from Sebennytos who reigned for 20 or 38 years. The names of these rulers, Nakhtnebef, Djedhor, and Nakhthorheb, all appear on contemporary monuments and in classical sources. The last ruler of the dynasty was forced to flee to Nubia by the second Persian invasion in 343 BC.
DYNASTY 31 (343–332 BC). This dynasty was apparently added to Manetho and refers to the kings of Persia who ruled Egypt
DYNASTY 31 • 71



following the conquest by Artaxerxes III until the arrival of Alexander the Great.
–E
EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD (c. 3100–2686 BC). The term used by Egyptologists for the period of Dynasty 1 and Dynasty 2; some also include Dynasty 3. The term Archaic Period is also used for this era. This period witnessed the development of the unitary Egyptian state; the growth of royal power as shown in the tombs at Abydos; and most importantly, the development of writing in the form of hieroglyphs.
ECONOMY. The Egyptian economy was primarily based on agriculture as the fertility of the soil engendered by the Nile flood allowed a crop surplus to fulfill the population’s basic food needs. The excess crops could be collected, stored, and recirculated. Egypt’s natural resources provided for most mineral needs, in particular control of the gold mines of Nubia.
Egypt never developed a monetary economy, but a sophisticated barter system was used. Goods were valued in measures of wheat if of low worth, or weights of copper, silver or gold for more highly valued objects. These items would be paid for with goods of a similar value and not usually with the materials used in the valuation. Major imports were normally received as part of state diplomatic relations. These included wood from Lebanon, tin, lapis lazuli, and other luxury goods accepted as tribute when Egypt was strong or reciprocated with such Egyptian products as gold. There is little evidence of a strong merchant class in Egypt, and foreign trade, not on the diplomatic level, appears to have been carried out by foreigners based in their own quarters in Memphis or later in such special areas as Naukratis. See also TRAVEL.
EDFU. Modern name for a site on the west bank of the Nile in the second nome of Upper Egypt, halfway between Thebes and Elephantine (Aswan), ancient Egyptian Djeba, Greek Apollonopolis Magna, where a major temple dedicated to the god Horus, which was rebuilt
72 • EARLY DYNASTIC PERIOD



during the Ptolemaic Period from 237 BC to 57 BC, is located. The inscriptions include a long text, which may be the text of a ritual play. Remains of the earlier temple have been uncovered in the foundations. The Edfu triad consists of Horus, his wife Hathor, and Isis. Tombs from the Old Kingdom to the Byzantine Period are located there, along with a Coptic monastery. Excavations have been performed by Auguste Mariette around 1860, a French expedition from 1914–1933, and a Franco–Polish team from 1937–1939. The temple inscriptions are being published by a French team. The main town site, largely buried under the modern town, has been examined by an international expedition beginning in 2000, and a German expedition has been surveying the locality since 1994. The sacred site of Behdet was located nearby. See also DENDERA; ESNA; KOM OMBO.
EDUCATION. The bulk of the Egyptian population consisted of agricultural laborers, while not more than 10 percent or less were literate. There is little evidence of formal schools but some did exist, possibly attached to temples or run in a semiprivate capacity by trained scribes. One such institution is mentioned in the Tale of Truth and Falsehood attended by the illegitimate son of the hero presumably because his mother is a wealthy woman. Many would have simply been educated by their father or a close relation. People from nonscribal backgrounds would have found it difficult to gain an education unless their father had come into wealth, usually by war booty. It is probable that even many of the educated Egyptian people living in the later periods could only read hieratic and not hieroglyphic. With the growth of demotic, the ability to read was probably confined to a smaller population of scribes and, when not recognized by the Roman authorities for legal purposes, it was eventually confined to the priests, so the advent of Christianity caused the forms of ancient Egyptian writing to be lost.

EDWARDS, AMELIA ANN BLANFORD (1831–1892). British author, traveler, and patroness. She was born in London on 7 June 1831, the daughter of an army officer. She edited and published popular books and articles and visited Egypt and Syria from 1873–1874 and wrote the best seller A Thousand Miles up the Nile in 1877. She became concerned with the destruction of Egyptian monuments and

founded the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1882 to encourage the accurate study, conservation, and excavation of Egyptian antiquities. She was the funds secretary and worked tirelessly on its behalf, lecturing both in England and the United States to raise money. She was an active supporter of Flinders Petrie and left money in her will to found the professorship at University College London for him. She died at Westbury-on-Trym, England, on 15 April 1892.
EGYPT. Modern name derived from the Greek Aigyptos for the country comprising the Nile Delta and the Nile Valley up to Elephantine (Aswan) and the adjacent deserts. The Greek name may be derived from the name Hikuptah, which was sometimes used for ancient Memphis. The ancient Egyptians called their country Kemet, the Black Land, referring to the fertile soil left by the Nile inundation.
EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND (AKA EGYPT EXPLORATION SOCIETY). This organization was founded in London in 1882 to sponsor excavations in Egypt, largely through the efforts of novelist Amelia Edwards. The name was changed from Egypt Exploration Fund to Egypt Exploration Society in 1919. It has been responsible for archaeological work at many sites in Egypt, notably at Tanis and Bubastis in the Delta, Abydos, Amarna, Deir el-Bahri, Memphis, Saqqara, and Buhen and Qasr Ibrim in Nubia. Among the archaeologists employed by the society have been Flinders Petrie and Howard Carter. The society has also encouraged the copying of tomb and temple reliefs and inscriptions, and from 1895–1907 it sponsored the work of Bernard Grenfell and Arthur Hunt in collecting Graeco-Roman papyri, notably at Oxyrhynchus, which are still in the course of publication. In the past, the society received from the Egyptian authorities a division of the antiquities found during its excavations, which were then distributed to various museums throughout the world.

74 • EGYPT



ELEPHANTINE. Greek name for the Egyptian Abu, modern Aswan, capital of the first nome of Upper Egypt. The site located on an island in the Nile marked the southern limit of the border of Egypt proper and was the main entrepôt for goods imported from the south, notably ivory, from which its name in Egyptian and Greek derives. Remains have been found from the Predynastic Period (Naqada III) to the Roman Period. The principal deity worshipped at the main temple was the ram-headed god Khnum, together with the goddesses Satis and Anukis. There was a smaller temple devoted to Satis erected by Thutmose III and Hatshepsut. The important shrine of the deified Heqaib is also located here. Rock tombs from the Old Kingdom to the New Kingdom are located on the west bank of the Nile at Qubbet el-Hawa. The Nilometer records the levels of the flood and dates from the Roman Period. Interesting records of a Jewish colony during the Persian Period have been discovered here. Elephantine was excavated by German archaeologists from 1906–1907, by a French team from 1907–1909, by Egyptian archaeologists in 1932 and from 1946–1947, and by a Swiss archaeologist from 1953–1954, and it has been systematically excavated by a GermanSwiss expedition since 1969. The nearby tombs were examined by a second German expedition from 1960–1973. See also NUBIA.
ELEPHANTINE PAPYRI. Hieratic, Demotic, and Greek papyri have been discovered during the excavations at Elephantine, but the term generally refers to the archives of Aramaic papyri found at this site at the end of the 19th century. These disclose a hitherto unknown Jewish colony resident there as part of the Persian garrison during the Persian Period. The texts indicate tensions between the local population and the Jewish residents and also point to the construction of a Jewish temple. Most of the texts are now preserved in the Berlin Egyptian Museum, the Brooklyn Museum, and the Cairo Egyptian Museum.
ELKAB. Arabic name for a site in Upper Egypt south of Thebes, ancient Egyptian Nekheb, Greek Eileithyiapolis, on the east side of the Nile, opposite Hierakonpolis in the third nome of Upper Egypt, of which became the capital during the New Kingdom. The principal deity of the city was the goddess Nekhbet, tutelary goddess of
ELKAB • 75



Upper Egypt. Remains date from the Prehistoric Period to the Graeco-Roman Period from 7000 BC to the 4th century AD. The remains include the foundations of the temple of Nekhbet, whose standing remains were destroyed in 1828; the foundations of the smaller temple of Thoth; mastabas from the Early Dynastic Period; Old Kingdom rock tombs; and tombs from Dynasty 18 and Dynasty 19. Those of Ahmose, son of Ebana, and Ahmose Pennekhbet contain biographical texts concerning the war against the Hyksos and the early rulers of Dynasty 18. Elkab was excavated by British archaeologists from 1892–1904 and has been worked by a Belgian expedition since 1937 and more recently also by a team from the British Museum.
ESNA. Modern name for a site in southern Upper Egypt on the west bank of the Nile, ancient Egyptian Iunet, Greek Latopolis. The surviving temple dedicated to Khnum dates to the Ptolemaic Period and Roman Period and includes a relief of Septimius Severus with his family, in which the image of his younger son, Geta, has been erased by the order of his older brother, Caracalla, who murdered him. Esna was excavated by the British archaeologist John Garstang from 1905–1906 and since 1951 has been excavated and the temple inscriptions copied by a French expedition. See also DENDERA; EDFU; KOM OMBO.
EXECRATION TEXTS. These texts are found during the Middle Kingdom inscribed on figures and pots that were ritually broken. They contain curses against the enemies of the king, both internal and external. The ceremony of breaking their names may have been thought to render these enemies powerless. The texts range from the general to the specific, giving names of individuals and foreign princes in Palestine and Nubia otherwise unknown. The texts give the earliest citation of the city of Jerusalem.
EXODUS. A book of the Hebrew Bible that describes the captivity of the Israelites in Egypt and their delivery by Moses from the oppression of the pharaoh. Much has been written to try to identify the route of the Exodus out of Egypt and the pharaoh concerned. The pharaoh of the oppression has usually been identified as Ramesses II

or his son. Merenptah; however, the story, as described in Exodus, is in some respects legendary. Most Egyptologists do not accept the complete tale as historical fact. Some doubt its entire historicity, while others are willing to subscribe to a minor flight of slaves but not the full dramatic account. It has been recently argued that the Exodus is to some extent a rewriting of the expulsion of the Hyksos from a Canaanite or Israelite point of view. See also JOSEPH.

FAIENCE. Egyptian Thnt. Material used for the production of amulets, inlays, jewelry, shabtis, votive offerings, vases, and bowls. It consists of a core of crushed quartz covered in a glaze composed of soda, lime, and silica, usually but not exclusively blue. The technique was in use from Predynastic Period to the Arabic Period. See also GLASS.
FARAS. Modern Arabic name for a site in Nubia, Greek name Pachoras, south of Abu Simbel in modern Sudan. The earliest remains appear to date to the Meroitic Period, as blocks of Thutmose III found here are now known to have been reused from Buhen. The most extensive period of occupation dates to the Coptic Period and includes several churches and a cathedral with frescoes. The site was briefly excavated in 1905 by an expedition from the University of Pennsylvania, from 1910–1913 by Francis L. Griffith for the University of Oxford, from 1960–1962 by the Sudan Antiquities Service, and from 1961–1964 by a Polish expedition that discovered the cathedral and much inscriptional evidence. The area was flooded in 1964 by Lake Nasser, the lake formed by the waters of the Aswan High Dam. The frescoes were rescued and divided between the National Museums in Khartoum and Warsaw.
FARFARA OASIS. Ancient Egyptian Ta-ihu. An oasis in the Western Desert between the Dakhla Oasis and the Bahariya Oasis. It is possibly mentioned in the famous stela of Kamose. It is cited in later records, but little excavation has taken place there and no pharaonic remains have been uncovered. An Italian expedition has been examining

Palaeolithic and Neolithic remains in the oasis. See also KHARGA OASIS; SIWA OASIS.
FAYUM. A fertile depression south of Memphis where a large lake was located during the Pharaonic Period. The area was developed during the course of Dynasty 12, whose capital at Lisht was close to the Fayum. Several of the rulers were buried either in the Fayum at Hawara or nearby at Lahun. The principal god of the region was the crocodile god Sobek. The area was further extensively settled during the Ptolemaic Period due to major drainage works carried out to release new land for retired Greek soldiers of the royal army. The area was quite prosperous at the time, as well as during the Roman Period, and the remains of many settlements exist from which many objects, notably literary and nonliterary papyri and mummy portraits, have been recovered.

FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (c. 2181–2055 BC). The term used by Egyptologists to denote the period from the end of Dynasty 6 to the reunification of Egypt under Dynasty 11. The era is marked by the collapse of royal power and the growth of the authority of the local rulers or nomarchs of the nomes. Local autonomy also led to distinct provincial art styles. Following the disappearance of the ruling line in Memphis, the governors of Herakleopolis (Dynasty 9 and Dynasty 10) and Thebes (Dynasty 11) vied for supreme authority, and the period came to an end with the victory of Mentuhotep II of Thebes, who reunited the country under his rule. See also MIDDLE KINGDOM; OLD KINGDOM.
FOUNDATION DEPOSITS. A series of ritual objects buried at the corners and important axis points of temples and tombs, sometimes in brick-lined pits. The deposits often consist of inscribed plaques of faience, stone, and precious metals, as well as food offerings, model tools, vessels, and other religious symbols, also often in faience or

FRENCH INSTITUTE. Originally Ecole française and from 1898 Institut français d’archéologie orientale. It was founded in 1880 by the French government as a research center in Cairo to undertake the study of ancient and Islamic Egypt and carry out archaeological excavations. It has had its headquarters at the Munira Palace since 1907. Several directors later became the heads of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. At first it organized epigraphic work, copying texts notably in Graeco-Roman Period temples at Edfu and later Dendera and Esna. Beginning in 1898, archaeological excavations have been undertaken at various sites in Egypt, particularly Deir elMedina, Karnak, Medamud, and more recently at the Dakhla Oasis and Kharga Oasis. The findings of its projects have been published by its own press.

Apart from the mines, the site included small sanctuaries erected by the miners, notably to the deities Hathor, Horus, and Min, as well as graffiti. The lead was used for the production of eye makeup known by the Arabic word kohl.
GEBELEIN. Greek Pathyris. Modern name for a site in the third nome of Upper Egypt where remains from the Old Kingdom to the Roman Period have been uncovered, including an important early papyrus. The patron goddess was Hathor linked to Anubis. The site was excavated by an Italian expedition from 1910–1814, from 1919–1920, and again in 1930, 1935, and 1937.
GERF HUSSEIN. Former location of a sandstone temple in Nubia built by the viceroy of Kush, Setau, in honor of Ptah and the deified Ramesses II. The inscriptions on the temple were copied and certain parts cut out before the site was flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake caused by the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s. See also ABU SIMBEL; AMADA; BEIT EL-WALI; KALABSHA; SOLEB.
GERMANICUS (15 BC–19 AD). Roman prince. Son of Nero Claudius Drusus and Antonia, daughter of Marcus Antonius. He was likely born in Rome on 24 May 15 BC. His original name was probably Nero Claudius Germanicus, but he was known as Germanicus Julius Caesar following his adoption by Emperor Tiberius in 4 AD. He was destined to succeed to imperial power and held several high

appointments, including governor of Germany and Syria. In 19 AD, he traveled to Egypt despite the ban on senatorial visits and was well received in Alexandria. He died in Antioch upon his return on 10 October 19 AD.
GERZEH. The modern name for a cemetery site northwest of Meidum. It was excavated by a British expedition in 1911. The cemetery comprised graves of the Predynastic Period with a few graves from the Early Dynastic Period and the New Kingdom. Flinders Petrie adopted the term Gerzean to describe the culture, but it is recognized as a form of Naqada II culture from the south. See also ADAIMA; KAFR HASSAN DAOUD; MINSHAT ABU OMAR; TELL ELFARKHA; TELL IBRAHIM AWAD.
GILUKHEPA (fl. 1381 BC). A princess of Mitanni and daughter of Shuttarna II, who married Amenhotep III when he was 10 years old. Her fate is unknown, although she is mentioned when arrangements were made for the marriage of her niece, Tadukhepa, to the king. See also TIY.
GIZA. Modern name for the area near modern Cairo that was the main burial site for the rulers of Dynasty 4. The site is dominated by the three pyramid complexes of Khufu and Khufu’s son, Khafre, and grandson, Menkaure. The Sphinx appears to have been constructed under Khafre but was renovated by the later king, Thutmose IV. The pyramids are surrounded by the tombs of the wives, children, and officials of the monarchs. The most important early excavations here were carried out by the Italian Giovanni Battista Caviglia in 1817 and the British John Perring and Howard Vyse from 1837–1838. In more modern times, the site has been excavated by several expeditions, the most notable led by Auguste Mariette in 1853; Flinders Petrie from 1880–1881; the Boston Museum of Fine Arts under George Reisner from 1902–1939, whose discoveries included the tomb of Hetepheres, which was examined from 1924–1927; the Italian Ernesto Schiaparelli in 1903; the Austrian Hermann Junker from 1912–1929; the American Clarence Fisher for the University of Pennsylvania in 1915; and Egyptian archaeologists Selim Hassan from 1929–1939,

Abdel-Moneim Abu Bakr for the University of Cairo from 1949–1976, an Egyptian team that excavated one of the boat graves beside the pyramid of Khufu in 1954; and more recently Zahi Hawass and Mark Lehner in 1978, 1980, and since 1989. The University of Cairo resumed work in the area in 2000.
GLASS. A material produced in Egypt beginning in the New Kingdom. The earliest dated vessel is belongs to the reign of Thutmose III, and he may have imported glassmakers from Syria after his conquests. Glass was used for the production of inlays, amulets, and cosmetic vessels. See also FAIENCE.
GNOSTICISM. A religious doctrine that combined elements of Christianity and Platonist Greek philosophy. These beliefs were later deemed heretical by the orthodox Christian church, and gnostic texts were proscribed. The discovery of gnostic texts in Egypt written in Coptic, notably at Nag Hammadi, have enabled gnostic beliefs to be better understood. See also MANICHEISM; RELIGION.
GOD’S FATHER. Title used beginning in the Middle Kingdom for the father of a ruler who was not himself a king. During late Dynasty 18, it may have designated a king’s father-in-law, although the exact reason that it was used by future king Ay is unclear. It is not to be confused with the minor priestly title of god’s father used for priests of a certain god.
GOD’S WIFE OF AMUN. Title first attested for queens and some princesses during Dynasty 18. The office was eventually bestowed on unmarried princesses, who were regarded as brides of the god Amun rather than the king. The first known princess to hold the office under these conditions was Isis, daughter of Ramesses VI of Dynasty 20. The importance of the office gradually eclipsed the status of that of high priest of Amun by Dynasty 25, and the latter office fell into disuse in Dynasty 26, the title being absorbed by the God’s wife. The office was used by both Dynasty 25 and Dynasty 26 to exert control over Thebes by having their princesses installed, although true power rested with the steward of the God’s wife. The last attested God’s wife was Ankhnesneferibre, daughter of Psamtik II, who
82 • GLASS



was in office at the time of the Persian invasion in 525 BC. Classical sources during the Ptolemaic Period imply that the office may have continued or been revived on a more modest scale. The tombs of the God’s wives were built in the precinct of the temple of Medinet Habu.
GOLD. A precious metal highly valued from antiquity. Egyptian Nbw. It was mainly used for jewelry, personal adornment, and royal funerary equipment. The trade of gold appears to have been a royal monopoly. The metal was found in the Eastern Desert in such locations as Wadi Hammamat and Nubia so much so that Egypt was regarded as a prime source of the metal by foreign countries. According to Egyptian myth, the flesh of the gods was made of gold. See also BRONZE; COPPER; IRON; SILVER.
GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD (332 BC–642 AD). A term used by Egyptologists for the entire span of rule by the Greeks and later the Romans in Egypt. It is usually divided into the Ptolemaic Period, Roman Period, and Byzantine Period.
GRAFFITI. Singular graffito. Short inscriptions carved or painted on temple walls, tomb walls, cliff faces, or prominent boulders that usually give the name of the author and sometimes the date and reason for his presence. Lengthier texts can occur. Graffiti can also be pictorial, notably during the Prehistoric Period when they are known as rock art. The texts are useful for dating purposes and are attested throughout Egyptian history to the Arabic Period and unfortunately in modern times when they can disfigure the monuments.
GRIFFITH, FRANCIS LLEWELLYN (1862–1934). British Egyptologist. He was born in Brighton, England, on 27 May 1862. He studied at Oxford and excavated in Egypt with Flinders Petrie and Henri Edouard Naville. He became reader in 1901 and then in 1924 professor of Egyptology at Oxford. He was one of the leading scholars of Egyptian texts and deciphered the script of ancient Meroe. He died in Oxford on 14 March 1934. According to his will, he founded the Griffith Institute in Oxford, a major research center for Egyptology.

GUROB. Modern name for a site in the Fayum west of the Nile. Ancient Egyptian Merwer. A palace complex and associated town and cemetery were located here during Dynasty 18, Dynasty 19, and Dynasty 20. The finds included imported Mycenaean pottery. It is believed that the famous sycamore head of Queen Tiy, now in the Berlin Egyptian Museum, came from this vicinity. Other cemeteries date from the late Predynastic Period to the First Intermediate Period and the Ptolemaic Period. The area was excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1888–1890 and again by his team from 1903–1904 and in 1920. It was briefly surveyed in 1978 and 1983 and since 2005 has been investigated by a team from the University of Liverpool.

HABIRU. A term found in cuneiform documents to signify nomads, renegades, or mercenaries. They are mentioned in the Amarna letters as allies of Abdi-Ashirta, king of Amurru. The term is obviously the ancestor of the word Hebrews but does not necessarily designate the same people in all its references.
HADRIAN (76–138 AD). Roman emperor. Original name Publius Aelius Hadrianus. He was born in Baetica in 76, son of Publius Aelius Hadrianus and Domitia Paulina, and was great-nephew of the Emperor Trajan, who adopted him on his deathbed in 117. Hadrian was noted for his policy of favoring Greek culture and his constant travels throughout the empire. He visited Egypt in 130 along with his wife, Vibia Sabina, and his favorite, Antinous, who drowned in the Nile. Hadrian founded the city of Antinoopolis in his honor. His visit to the Colossi of Memnon is recorded in graffiti.
HAKOR (reigned 393–380 BC). The Greek form of his name is Achoris. Throne name Khnummaatre setepenkhnum. Second ruler of Dynasty 29 and successor of Nefaarud I. He allied with Greek states and rebels in Cyprus against Persian rule.

HAPUSENEB (fl. 1470 BC). High priest of Amun. He was a strong supporter of Queen Hatshepsut and supervised the construction work for her tomb in the Valley of the Kings, and at Karnak, he supervised the removal of two obelisks from Elephantine for the temple. His own badly damaged tomb (nunber 67) at Thebes has a scene depicting the Egyptian expedition to Punt during Hatshepsut’s reign.
HAPY. Fertility god who was a personification of the annual Nile flood. He is depicted as a fat, effeminate man with large breasts and marsh plants on his head. A different god Hapy with a baboon head was one of the Sons of Horus. See also RELIGION.
HARAGEH. A cemetery site near Lahun at the entrance to the Fayum dating from the Predynastic Period to the Coptic Period. It was excavated by a British expedition from 1912–1914.

HARDJEDEF (fl. 2570 BC). Son of Khufu of Dynasty 4. During later times, he was regarded as the author of a text of wisdom literature, and he was named among the princes in the literary tale of the Westcar Papyrus. An isolated later text in the Wadi Hammamat writes his name in a royal cartouche. In later legend, he was credited with the discovery of the text of the Book of the Dead. See also BAUEFRE; DJEDEFRE; KAWAB; KHAFRE.
HAREM CONSPIRACY PAPYRI. An archive of papyri that date to the reign of Ramesses IV detailing the investigation of a conspiracy against his predecessor, Ramesses III. It appears that the king was assassinated in an attempt by a lady of the harem and certain officials to put her son, Pentaweret, on the throne. The conspiracy was thwarted by the king’s appointed heir. The judgements of the special court are recorded. Many of the culprits were sentenced to death or suicide.
HARKHUF (fl. 2280 BC). Egyptian official during the reigns of Nemtyemsaf I and Pepy II of Dynasty 6 who held the post of governor of Upper Egypt, possibly as successor to Weni. He was buried at

Elephantine, and his tomb contains a major autobiographical inscription. He undertook four expeditions to Nubia during which he acquired exotic goods for the royal court, including a pygmy or dwarf for which he was personally congratulated by the king.
HARMACHIS. See HARWENNEFER.
HARNEDJITEF (reigned c. 1770 BC). Throne name Hetepibre. Ruler at the beginning of Dynasty 13. Possibly son of a previous ruler, Ameny Qemau, whose name appears in his cartouche and has been wrongly interpreted as meaning “the Asiatic.” A statue of Harnedjitef has been found in the Delta near Avaris. A mace with his throne name has been found in the Syrian city of Ebla, indicating that trade and political links with the Levant were still active in this period. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
HARRIS PAPYRUS. Also known as Great Harris Papyrus or Papyrus Harris I. It was acquired by collector Anthony Charles Harris (1790–1869) from illicit excavations at Thebes in 1855, possibly at Deir el-Medina. It is an account written during the reign of Ramesses IV of the state of Egypt and its temples during the reign of his father, Ramesses III, which the new king inherited. A historical summary describes in general terms the rise of Dynasty 20 under his grandfather, Sethnakhte. The papyrus is now housed in the British Museum.
HARSAPHES. See HERYSHEF.
HARSIESE (reigned c. 870–860 BC). Throne name Hedjkheperre setepenamun. Son of the high priest of Amun Sheshonq, who may have succeeded as Sheshonq II and Nestanebtashru. Grandson of Osorkon I of Dynasty 22 and great-grandson of Pasebakhaenniut II of Dynasty 21. He succeeded as high priest of Amun and then adopted the royal titulary during the reign of his cousin, Osorkon II. Upon Harsiese’s death, Osorkon II installed his own son, Nimlot, as high priest to reassert central control of Thebes. See also KAROMAMA; MAATKARE.
86 • HARMACHIS



HARWENNEFER (reigned c. 205–199 BC). The Greek form of his name is Haronnophris and was previously wrongly read as Harmachis. Rebel king during the reign of Ptolemy V. His rebellion was centered in the south, and he controlled the area from south of Thebes to north of Abydos, while the Ptolemaic government remained in control of Elephantine and the north. Thebes was retaken in 199 BC, when Harwennefer was succeeded in unknown circumstances by Ankhwennefer.
HATHOR. Egyptian goddess of sexual love and music. She was originally the mother of the sky god Horus and so mother of the king who was identified with Horus. She was later regarded as the daughter of Re and wife of Horus. She is depicted as a cow or human figure with the ears of a cow or wearing a crown with the horns of a cow. Her principal place of worship was Dendera, but she also had connections with such desert and foreign areas as Serabit el-Khadim, where she was worshipped as the lady of turquoise. She is also associated as a protective deity with the necropolis area of Thebes. See also RELIGION.
HATNUB. Site in the Eastern Desert used as a quarry for Egyptian alabaster from the Early Dynastic Period to the Roman Period. See also AKORIS; GEBEL EL-HARIDI; GEBEL EL-SILSILA; MONS CLAUDIANUS; MONS PORPHYRITES; SERABIT EL-KHADIM; WADI EL-HUDI; WADI MAGHARA; WADI HAMMAMAT.
HATSHEPSUT (reigned c. 1472–1458 BC). Throne name Makare. Queen-regnant of Egypt. She was the daughter of Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose and married her half brother, Thutmose II, by whom she had at least one daughter, Nefrure. Hatshepsut became regent for her stepson, Thutmose III, but she soon ascended the throne in her own right, although the date for this act is disputed. She claimed that she had been designated as heir to the throne by her father. Hatshepsut built her mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri with scenes showing the great events of her reign, including an expedition to Punt and the erection of an obelisk. The work was supervised by her chief
HATSHEPSUT • 87



architect, Senenmut, whose relations with the queen have been the subject of much speculation. Her reign ended after 21 years, presumably upon her death, and her stepson became sole ruler. Hatshepsut initially built her tomb as king’s wife in the Wadi Gabbanat al-Qurud. Her sarcophagus from this tomb is now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. She appears to have been buried with her father in a joint tomb (KV20) built later in the Valley of the Kings. Thutmose III later attempted to expunge all mention of his aunt, although he appears to have been on relatively good terms with her during her reign. Her mummy was identified in 2007 as one of two women found in KV60. See also NEFRUBITY; WOMEN.
HATTUSILI III (fl. 1300–1237 BC). King of the Hittites. Youngest son of Mursili II and Gassuliyawiya. He served with his brother, Muwattalli II, and was granted an important viceroyalty in the northern part of the kingdom. He was with the Hittite forces in Syria at the time of the battle of Kadesh in which he may have fought. He fell out with his brother’s successor, his nephew, Urhi-Teshub, and deposed him c. 1295 BC. He faced hostility from Egypt but negotiated a famous peace treaty in 1258 BC. His daughter, Maathorneferure, later married Ramesses II c. 1245 BC. Correspondence between the two monarchs has been found at the Hittite capital Hattusha. See also PUDUHEPA.
HAWARA. Modern name for the area in the Fayum where the pyramid complex of Amenemhat III of Dynasty 12 was built. The remains of the mortuary temple were later identified by the Greeks as the Labyrinth. The area was excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1888–1889 and in 1911, when in a cemetery close to the complex he discovered pits from the Roman Period that contained many burials with finely painted mummy portraits. In 1955–1956, an Egyptian expedition uncovered the intact burial of Princess Nefruptah, daughter of the king.

HEIRESS CONCEPT. A theory invented by Egyptologists whereby the right to the throne passed through a woman and thus necessitated brother–sister marriages by the ruler. The theory was based on the inscriptions of Queen Hatshepsut and the number of brother–sister marriages during early Dynasty 18. This concept has now been proven false, as succession passed through the male line. Many rulers chose not to marry their sisters, preferring commoners.
HEKANAKHTE (fl. 1950 BC). Landholder and priest at Thebes during the reign of Senusret I. He is known from his letters, which were discovered in 1921–1922 at Deir el-Bahri. These letters were written to his household while he was away in the north and give details about the practice of Egyptian agriculture and personal relations within his family.
HELIOPOLIS. Greek name for the Egyptian city of Iunu, capital of the 13th Lower Egyptian nome in the suburbs of present-day Cairo. Its main temple was dedicated to the creator god Atum, who was identified with the sun god Re, elevated to the chief god in Egypt beginning during Dynasty 5. Very little remains of the original city and temple apart from an obelisk of Senusret I. Many of the monuments appear to have been transported to decorate Alexandria during the Ptolemaic Period and Roman Period. Excavations were carried out by an Italian expedition in 1903, Flinders Petrie from 1911–1912, the University of Cairo from 1976–1981, and Egyptian inspectors since 1988.
HELWAN. Modern name for a site south of Cairo where a major cemetery of the Early Dynastic Period was excavated from 1942–1954 by Egyptian archaeologist Zaki Saad. Objects from Dynasty 1 and Dynasty 2, including pottery, stone vessels, palettes, and jewelry, were recovered. An Australian expedition began work there again in 1997.
HEMAKA (fl. 2950 BC). High official of King Den of Dynasty 1. His large tomb (number 3035), excavated at Saqqara, has been ascribed to the king but is now generally accepted as that of his chancellor. It

was discovered by Cecil Firth, a British archaeologist working for the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1931, and was cleared by his successor, Walter B. Emery, in 1936.
HEMIUNU (fl. 2600-2560 BC). Egyptian prince of the Old Kingdom. Probably identified with a like-named son of Nefermaat. He served as vizier under Khufu. He was buried in a mastaba tomb at Giza. It is speculated that he may have been in charge of the construction of the Great Pyramid. A statue from his tomb is now housed in the Pelizaeus Museum in Hildesheim, Germany.

HENTTAWY. The name of several ladies related to the family of the high priests of Amun and the royal family during Dynasty 21. The most important seems to have been the wife of Pinudjem I and daughter of Queen Tentamun. The inscriptions concerning these women are not always precise, so their exact relationships are still uncertain.
HENUTMIRE (fl. 1275 BC). Royal princess and queen of Dynasty 19. She is probably a daughter of Sety I and appears on a statue with his wife, Tuy. She later married her brother, Ramesses II. She was buried in QV75 in the Valley of the Queens. See also BINTANAT;

HEQAIB (fl. 2240 BC). Military official and probable governor of Elephantine at the end of the Old Kingdom. His full name was Pepinakht, also known as Heqaib, and he was buried at Qubbet elHawa (tomb number 35) on the west bank of the Nile opposite the island of Elephantine. He appears to have played a leading role in Egyptian military activity in Nubia and was deified after his death. A shrine was built in his honor by Sarenput I, governor of Elephantine, at the beginning of Dynasty 12. It was excavated in 1932 and 1946 by Egyptian archaeologists and yielded a large number of statues, stelae, and offering tables of kings and officials of Dynasty 12 and Dynasty 13. The shrine was abandoned during the Second Intermediate Period.
HERACLIUS (c. 575–641 AD). Byzantine emperor. Son of Heraclius, the governor of Africa, of Armenian origin, and Epiphania. His father organized a revolt against the usurper Phocas in 610, sending a nephew, Nicetas, to secure Egypt while the younger Heraclius sailed to Constantinople, where he was crowned emperor on 7 October 610. The new emperor tried without success to reconcile the religious differences within the empire between the orthodox and Monophysite beliefs. He had to fight and expel the Persians, who occupied Egypt and other eastern provinces between 617 and 629, only to lose them to the Arabs from 641–642. He died in Constantinople on 11 February 641. See also BENJAMIN; CYRUS.
HERAKLEOPOLIS. Greek name, more properly Herakleopolis Magna, for the Egyptian site of Nen-nesu, modern Ihnasya elMedina in Middle Egypt. It became the capital of Egypt under Dynasty 9 and Dynasty 10, until the overthrow of the last ruler by the prince of Thebes. Its main temple was dedicated to the local god Heryshef and enlarged by Ramesses II. The city was an important military garrison during Dynasty 22, and a branch of the royal family was established there. Excavations were carried out by British archaeologists from 1890–1891 and 1903–1904 and more recently by a Spanish expedition from 1966–1969, from 1976–1979, and since 1984, which has uncovered tombs of the royal family of Dynasty 22.

HERIHOR (fl. 1075 BC). High priest of Amun and military general of unknown but possibly Libyan origin at the end of Dynasty 20. It is not certain if he preceded or followed Piankh in office. He adopted the style of king at Thebes, using his title as high priest as his throne name, and was virtually an independent ruler in the south. His rule may not have ended peacefully, as his figure on one stela is defaced. He may have been the first of a line of independent Theban high priests.
HERMOPOLIS. Greek name, more properly Hermopolis Magna, for the ancient Egyptian Khmunu, modern el-Ashmunein, capital of the 15th nome of Upper Egypt. The site is virtually destroyed, but there are remains from the Middle Kingdom to the Roman Period. It has been excavated by expeditions from Italy in 1903, Germany from 1929–1939, the University of Alexandria during the late 1940s, various Egyptian inspectors, and more recently a British Museum expedition from 1980–1990. Many of the blocks from Amarna were reused in construction work here by Ramesses II. See also AKHENATEN; TALATAT.
HERODOTUS (c. 484–420 BC). Greek author from Halicarnassus. He visited Egypt during the course of his travels, and his The Histories (c. 440 BC) contains valuable information about Egyptian history and customs. Much of this information would have been supplied by Egyptian priests and is uneven in content. See also MANETHO.
HERYSHEF. Chief god of Herakleopolis whose Greek name was Arsaphes and who was identified with the Greek god Herakles. He is depicted as a ram-headed human figure. See also RELIGION.
HESIRE (fl. 2650 BC). A high official of Dynasty 3. His tomb at Saqqara yielded delicately carved wooden panels depicting the owner and his titles. The tomb was first discovered by Auguste Mariette and later recleared from 1911–1912.
HESUNEBEF (fl. 1210–1175 BC). Workman in the Deir el-Medina community during Dynasty 19 and Dynasty 20. He is first attested as a slave boy of the foreman Neferhotep, who freed him and

arranged a post for him as a workman. Neferhotep also obtained a bride for him from a community family. Hesunebef remained in the workforce after his patron’s death, but the new foreman, Paneb, Neferhotep’s adopted son, was later accused of adulterous relations with his wife and sexual misconduct with his daughter, who was then passed on to Paneb’s son. The truth of this accusation is unclear, but Hesunebef and his wife divorced. During the reign of Ramesses III, Hesunebef rose to the post of deputy foreman. He remained loyal to the memory of his patron, naming his son after him and erecting a stela in his honor. See also KENHERKHEPESHEF; KHA; RAMOSE; SENNEDJEM.
HETEPHERES. The name of several princesses and queens of Dynasty 4. The most important was Hetepheres I, the wife of Snefru and mother of Khufu. Her intact burial missing a body was recovered at Giza by George Reisner during an expedition from 1925–1927. Hetepheres II was the daughter of Khufu, wife of her brother Kawab, and mother of Meresankh III.
HIBA, EL-. Modern name for the Egyptian Teudjoi and Greek Ankyronpolis. This location was an important military garrison during Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22. The cemetery of the Roman Period was excavated by British explorers in 1903, and papyri and mummy portraits were found. It was investigated by an American expedition in 1980 and again by a team from the University of California, Berkeley, beginning in 2001.
HIERAKONPOLIS. Greek name for the Egyptian city of Nekhen, modern Kom el-Ahmar on the west bank of the Nile opposite Elkab. The city was a major settlement during the Predynastic Period and Early Dynastic Period and probably the capital of the kings of Upper Egypt before the unification of the country. Important remains and objects from this period were discovered in Hierakonpolis during a British expedition from 1897–1899, including the famous Narmer Palette and the Scorpion Macehead. The main deity of the city was the falcon god Horus. The site continued to be occupied through the Roman Period and Coptic Period. Further excavation took place during an expedition by the University of Liverpool from

1905–1906, the Brooklyn Museum from 1907–1908, a British expedition in 1927, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1934–1935. Work was resumed by an American expedition from 1967–1969 and since 1978.
HIERATIC. Modern term derived from the Greek word for the abbreviated form of writing the hieroglyphic script, which developed during the Early Dynastic Period and was used primarily on papyri and ostraca for correspondence and religious and literary texts. The earliest complete texts are the Abusir Papyri of Dynasty 5. The script fell out of use during the Saite Period, when it was largely replaced by demotic, but it persisted in use in religious texts until the Roman Period.
HIEROGLYPHIC. Modern term derived from the Greek word used to describe the standard form of Egyptian writing to express the Egyptian language. The earliest forms appear at the end of the Predynastic Period and the Early Dynastic Period, but the script does not become fully intelligible until the Old Kingdom. The writing consists of two types of signs: phonograms that represent single consonants or consonantal clusters (biliterals or triliterals) and ideograms that indicate the sense of the word, usually written at the end of the word to reinforce the meaning. The basic consonantal alphabet consists of 24 signs; vowels were not written. Hieroglyphic writing was soon replaced by hieratic for ordinary usage, and the hieroglyphic script was reserved for monumental work in stone or paint and for religious texts. The script was deciphered in modern times by Jean-François Champollion, building on the work of Thomas Young, with the help of bilingual texts such as the Rosetta Stone. The subsequent realization that Coptic was a later form of the same language immeasurably aided the understanding of ancient Egyptian texts. See also DEMOTIC.
HIGH PRIEST OF AMUN. The chief religious office in the temple of Amun at Karnak in Thebes. The office grew in importance and wealth with the elevation of Amun to the position of chief god of Egypt during Dynasty 18 and the extensive endowments bestowed upon the temple by various rulers.

appears to have been carefully controlled by the ruler to avoid any conflict of power, and incumbents were often chosen not from the Theban clergy but from priesthoods in other cities or from court officials. The reforms of Akhenaten appeared in part designed to limit the influence of the priesthood of Amun. During Dynasty 20, the office became more influential and hereditary in one family, resulting in a civil war in Thebes under Ramesses XI, whose generals, Herihor and Piankh, suppressed the high priest Amenhotep but took over his office and power. During Dynasty 21, the south was virtually independent under the family of high priests descended from Piankh. Under Dynasty 22, an attempt was made to control Thebes through the appointment of royal princes as high priests, but conflict soon arose, especially over the appointment of the high priest Osorkon. During Dynasty 25, the office was still held by royal descendants of the dynasty, but it appears to have been suppressed during Dynasty 26, when the titles were assumed by the God’s wife of Amun. The office is again attested during the Ptolemaic Period, when it appears to have been primarily religious and shorn of political power. See also BAKENKHONS; IUPUT; NEBWENNEF; PASER; WENNEFER.
HIGH PRIEST OF PTAH. Chief religious office in the temple of Ptah at Memphis. The lack of documentation limits knowledge of the influence and power of this office. As administrator of the main temple of the second capital of Egypt, the high priest had great resources under his control, but any political power would have been limited by the proximity of the court, which resided in the north during the New Kingdom. There is no evidence of conflict, as is recorded in the case of the high priest of Amun. The officeholders included Prince Khaemwese, son of Ramesses II, and several princes during Dynasty 22, but also local priests allegedly of one family. An inscription listing many of the officeholders and the rulers they served is an important chronological tool in studying Egyptian history. The office took on new importance during the Ptolemaic Period, when the high priest served as the chief Egyptian religious official at the royal court, and many funerary inscriptions of the family survive. The office may have been suppressed by the Roman government, as only one high priest is attested after the conquest.

HITTITES. An Indo-European-speaking people who established a kingdom in central Anatolia, modern Turkey, which in the second millennium BC gradually built up an empire that included much of Anatolia and Syria. The Hittites helped destroy the kingdom of Mitanni and sought to inherit their overlordship in Syria, leading them into conflict with Egypt during the reign of Akhenaten. The Hittite king Suppiluliuma I managed to detach the Egyptian vassal kingdom of Amurru from Egyptian control. Upon the death of Tutankhamun, his widow, Ankhesenamun, sought a Hittite husband, but this plan proved abortive. Sety I and Ramesses II sought to restore Egyptian control in Syria, but the Egyptians were driven back at the battle of Kadesh in 1274 BC. A peace treaty was eventually signed between the two powers in 1258 BC, whereby the border between the two empires in Syria was recognized with the loss of Amurru to the Hittites. Around 1245 BC, a marriage was arranged by Ramesses II with the daughter of the Hittite king, who was known in Egypt as Maathorneferure, and he later appears to have married a second daughter. Relations between the two powers remained friendly until the destruction of the Hittite kingdom around 1195 BC, probably as a result of the movement of the Sea Peoples perhaps aided by local tribesmen. See also HATTUSILI III; MUWATTALLI II; PUDUHEPA; URHI-TESHUB.
HOR (reigned c. 1760 BC). Throne name Awibre. Ruler of Dynasty 13. He was buried at Dahshur, where statues of the king have been recovered from his tomb, which was discovered in 1894. The nearby tomb shaft of the royal lady Nubheteptikhered may well be one of his female relations. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
HOREMHEB (reigned c. 1323–1295 BC). Throne name Djeserkheperure. Of unknown parentage from Henes. Possibly to be identified with Paatonemheb attested during the reign of Akhenaten, he was a military commander during the reign of Tutankhamun. He was married to Mutnodjmet, possibly a sister of Nefertiti. Horemheb conducted campaigns in Nubia and Palestine to restore Egyptian power and alongside Ay conducted affairs in the minority of Tutankhamun and helped organize the return to orthodoxy after the Amarna Period. His tomb at Saqqara, built when he was a commoner, was first

seen in the 19th century and was rediscovered and excavated by an expedition of the Egypt Exploration Society from 1975–1980. Horemheb succeeded to the throne upon the death of Ay and continued the policy of rebuilding Egypt at home and abroad and suppressed the names of his immediate predecessors since Amenhotep III. He died childless and appears to have arranged the succession of his vizier, Ramesses I, founder of Dynasty 19. He was buried in tomb KV57 in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy has not been recovered or identified. See also DYNASTY 18.
HORUS. Egyptian god. Horus was originally a sky god identified with the ruler during the Early Dynastic Period who bore a Horus name in a serekh as part of the royal titulary. In later legend, Horus became the son of Osiris and Isis and the legitimate ruler of Egypt upon his father’s death. In his former aspect, he was worshipped as Haroeris or Horus the elder and in the latter as Harpocrates or Horus the child, often depicted as a youth with a sidelock protected by his mother. Horus was also identified with the sun god Re and was worshipped as Re-Harakhty. His sacred animal was the hawk, and his particular places of worship were at Hierakonpolis and Edfu. The udjat-eye of Horus was considered a potent amulet. See also RELIGION.
HOTEPSEKHEMWY (reigned c. 2880 BC). First ruler of Dynasty 2. The reasons for his accession and the start of a new dynasty are unknown. His tomb appears to have been at Saqqara. See also RANEB.
HRERE (fl. 1075 BC). Wife of a high priest of Amun and mother of Nodjmet and an unnamed king. She may be the wife of Piankh, who wrote to her in his absence to carry out administrative duties in Thebes, but it has also been suggested that she may have been the wife of the high priest Amenhotep. It is not altogether clear whether there were one or two Hreres. See also HERIHOR.
HU. A site in Upper Egypt near Nag Hammadi. Graeco-Roman Diospolis Parva. Capital of the seventh nome of Upper Egypt. Remains have been found from the Predynastic Period to the GraecoRoman Period. The main temple was dedicated to the goddess

Hathor. The site was excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1898–1899 and by an American expedition from 1989–1991.
HUNI (reigned c. 2638–2615 BC). Last ruler of Dynasty 3. He is often said to have been buried in the pyramid at Meidum, but this may well have been built for Snefru or completed by him. There is no basis for the contention that Snefru was his son since Snefru’s mother does not have a queenly title. No reason is known for the change in dynasty.
HYKSOS. The Greek form of the Egyptian Heka Khasut, “ruler of foreign lands.” This title was used by the Egyptians for the various Asiatic chieftains in Palestine and Syria. The later derivation of “shepherd kings” is erroneous. The Egyptians were always wary of Asiatic encroachment, and during Dynasty 12 Amenemhat I built a wall to exclude unwanted Asiatics. Nevertheless, some immigration was permitted as an Asiatic settlement grew up around Avaris, and Asiatic travelers are depicted at Beni Hasan. During the Second Intermediate Period, large numbers of Asiatics settled in Egypt and eventually took over most of the country, founding the Hyksos Dynasty 15 and adopting many of the attributes of Egyptian rulers. Thebes apparently became a vassal state but ultimately rebelled and succeeded in capturing the Hyksos capital at Avaris and driving them from Egypt. See also APEPI; IANNAS; KHAYAN; SALITIS.
HYPATIA (d. 415 AD). Pagan martyr. Daughter of the mathematician Theon of Alexandria. She was educated in mathematics, astronomy, and philosophy and taught Neoplatonist philosophy in Alexandria. As a pagan, she was opposed by Christians in the city and was killed by a mob incited by fanatical monks. It is not clear if the murder had the approval of the patriarch Cyril.
–I
IAH. Moon god of Egypt. He was popular at the beginning of Dynasty 18 when such royal names as Ahmose and Ahhotep were composed from his name. He was later identified with Khonsu. See also RELIGION.
98 • HUNI



IANNAS (reigned c. 1590 BC). Greek name given by the Hebrew historian Josephus, who derived it from Manetho for one of the Hyksos kings of Dynasty 15. A stela fragment recently discovered at Avaris bears the cartouches of Khayan and names his eldest son, Ianassi, presumably to be identified with the future king. Nothing is known of his actual reign. See also APEPI; SALITIS.
IARET (fl. 1400 BC). Sister-queen of Thutmose IV and daughter of Amenhotep II. She appears on several monuments from her husband’s reign. See also MUTEMWIA; NEFERTIRY.
IBI (reigned c. 2140 BC). Throne name Kakare. A minor ruler of Dynasty 8. Nothing is known of his reign, but he was buried in a pyramid at Saqqara, which was excavated in the 1930s. See also FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
IMHOTEP (fl. 2660 BC). Vizier of Djoser of Dynasty 3. He is credited with devising the construction of the step pyramid, the first stone structure in Egypt. He had a reputation for wisdom and was deified after his death and worshipped as a minor deity. He is usually depicted as a seated scribe with an open papyrus on his lap. He was identified by the Greeks with Aesculapius, god of medicine.

IMSETY. See SONS OF HORUS.
INAROS (fl. 459–454 BC). Greek form of the Egyptian name Irethorru. Son of Psamtik, a local Egyptian dynast. Egyptian rebel against the rule of Persia. Allied with forces from Athens, he took Memphis and defeated and killed the satrap Achaemenes in 459 BC, but his army was later crushed by superior Persian troops. He was captured and taken to Persia, where he was executed. His son, Amyrtaeos, was said to have been reinstated in his father’s possessions and may have been an ancestor of the later king Amyrtaeos. An inscription from Kharga Oasis mentions his rule.
INAROS • 99



INENI (fl. 1510–1470 BC). A high official at the beginning of Dynasty 18, serving in the reigns of Amenhotep I, Thutmose I, Thutmose II, and Thutmose III with the title of overseer of the granary of Amun. Son of the judge Ineni and the lady Sit-Djehuty. He was in charge of building works at Karnak for the first two rulers and supervised the construction of the royal tomb of Thutmose I in the Valley of the Kings. He was buried in a tomb (number 81) at Thebes, which contains a detailed biographical inscription.
INTEF (fl. 2150 BC). Governor of Thebes during the First Intermediate Period. Son of the lady Ikuy. He was worshipped as the ancestor of the later rulers of Dynasty 11 and so was probably the father or ancestor of Mentuhotep I.
INTEF I (reigned c. 2125–2112 BC). First declared ruler of Dynasty 11. Horus name Sehertawy. Son of Mentuhotep I. At first governor of Thebes, he appears to have revolted against Herakleopolis and adopted the title of king, although he did not adopt the full royal titulary. He was buried in a rock-cut tomb on the west bank at Thebes.
INTEF II (reigned c. 2112–2063 BC). Successor to Intef I of Dynasty 11. Horus name Wahankh. Son of the lady Nefru and possibly Mentuhotep I, so likely the brother of his predecessor. He consolidated Theban control of Upper Egypt, capturing Thinis. He was buried in a rock-cut tomb on the west bank at Thebes where a funerary stela mentioning his pet dogs was set up. The stela is mentioned in a tomb robbery papyrus of Dynasty 20, and part of it was recovered by Auguste Mariette in excavations in 1860.
INTEF III (reigned c. 2063–2055 BC). Successor and presumably son of Intef II of Dynasty 11 and the lady Nefru. Horus name Nakhtnebtepnefer. Little is known of his brief reign except that a famine occurred in the region of Abydos. He too was buried in a rock-cut tomb at Thebes. He married the lady Iah, by whom he had his son and successor, Mentuhotep II, who conquered the rest of Egypt and ended the First Intermediate Period.

INTEF IV (reigned c. 1740 BC). Throne name Sehetepkare. A minor king of Dynasty 13. A statue of his has been discovered in the Fayum.
INTEF V (reigned c. 1571–1566 BC). A king of Dynasty 17. Prenomen Nubkheperre. His position in the dynasty is unclear. He has hitherto been regarded as one of the earlier rulers, but in more recent research, it has been suggested that he may be a son of Sobekemsaf I and brother and successor of Intef VI. He is known from a large number of inscriptions at Abydos, Coptos, and Thebes. He was buried on the west bank at Thebes, and his tomb was mentioned in the Tomb Robbery Papyri as still intact. His coffin is now housed in the British Museum. His tomb was rediscovered and excavated by a German expedition from 2001–2002.
INTEF VI (reigned c. 1566 BC). Throne name Sekhemrewepmaat. A king of Dynasty 17. He has generally been regarded as a successor of Intef V, but more recently it has been suggested that he may be a son of Sobekemsaf I and brother and predecessor of Intef V. He was buried on the west bank at Thebes, and his tomb is mentioned in the Tomb Robbery Papyri as still intact. The pyramidion of his tomb in now housed in the British Museum, while his coffin is preserved in the Louvre Museum.
INTEF VII (reigned c. 1566 BC). A king of Dynasty 17. Prenomen Sekhemreherhermaat. His coffin is now housed in the Louvre Museum. He was possibly a coregent of Intef VI.
INTEFYOKER (fl. 1945–1950 BC). Vizier of Amenemhat I and Senusret I of Dynasty 12. He is attested in office toward the end of the reign of Amenemhat I and was presumably one of the most powerful officials of the period. He was buried in a tomb near the pyramid of Amenemhat I at Lisht; however, his family is cursed in the execration texts, so it is speculated that they eventually fell from power. See also APEREL; AY; HEMIUNU; IMHOTEP; KAGEMNI; MERERUKA; NEFERMAAT; PASER; PTAHHOTEP; PTAHSHEPSES; RAMESSES I; REKHMIRE.

IPUT. The name of two queens of Dynasty 6. Iput I appears to have been the wife of Teti and mother of Pepy I and was buried in a subsidiary pyramid next to that of Teti. Iput II was the wife of Pepy II and was buried in a subsidiary pyramid next to her husband’s.
IPUWER. The ostensible author of a text of wisdom literature composed during the late Middle Kingdom that describes Egypt in a state of chaos. While this has been taken as a reference to a historical event, it is now regarded as simply a literary device.
IRETHORRU. See INAROS.
IRON. A metal rarely used in Egypt until the Saite Period that later became widespread during the Roman Period. Isolated examples are known from the Old Kingdom onward, but the most notable examples are an iron dagger, iron chisel heads, and amulets from the tomb of Tutankhamun of Dynasty 18. See also BRONZE; COPPER; GOLD; SILVER.
ISIS. Greek name of the major female deity of Egypt, Egyptian Ast. Daughter of Geb and Nut and consort of her brother, Osiris, mythological ruler of Egypt. Following the murder of her husband by their brother Seth, she assiduously collected the remains of Osiris and, according to one version, was impregnated by him after death, if not before. She fought tirelessly for the rights of her son, Horus, to succeed to Egypt in opposition to Seth. This contest is reflected in the bawdy tale The Contendings of Horus and Seth. The worship of Isis became particularly strong during the Graeco-Roman Period, when Osiris was displaced as her husband by the composite god Sarapis. Her cult spread throughout the Roman Empire, being particularly attractive to women. It was suppressed at the advent of Christianity. See also RELIGION.
ISIS (fl. 1485 BC). The name of a junior wife of Thutmose II who was the mother of his successor, Thutmose III. She is only attested during the reign of her son as the king’s mother. Princess Isis is probably her granddaughter. See also HATSHEPSUT.

ISITNOFRET (fl. 1300–1245 BC). Junior wife and queen of Ramesses II. He married her at the same time as Nefertari, and she bore his eldest daughter, Bintanat, as well as three sons, his second, Ramesses, his fourth, Khaemwese, and his 13th, Merenptah. She appears to have succeeded Nefertari as chief queen but died before her husband and was replaced by Bintanat. The name was also borne by princesses of Dynasty 19 and a later queen, wife of Merenptah, who may have been his niece, daughter of Khaemwese. See also HENUTMIRE; HENTTAWY; MAATHORNEFERURE; MERITAMUN; NEBETTAWY.
ISMANT AL-KHARB. Ancient Kellis. A Roman town in the Dakhla Oasis that flourished from the 1st to the 4th centuries AD. The main temple of the site was dedicated to the local god Tutu. The area has been excavated by a joint Canadian and Australian team since 1986. Apart from the temple, houses have been uncovered that contained documents in Greek and Coptic, including many associated with the Manichean sect opposed to orthodox Christianity. See also MANICHEISM.
ISRAELITES. The people of the Old Testament Bible who founded the state of Israel in the former Egyptian province of Canaan. They are later known as the Hebrews (Habiru). Their origins are obscure, but modern archaeologists believe that they were the original inhabitants of the hill country in Canaan joined perhaps by other elements. According to Isrealite legend, they immigrated to Egypt and then escaped in the Exodus. They conquered most of Canaan apart from the coastal fringe held by the Philistines. This must have occurred after the withdrawal of the Egyptians in late Dynasty 20. The only reference to the Israelites in an Egyptian text is the inscription of Merenptah of Dynasty 19, where they are mentioned as a defeated tribe not yet a state. The extant and importance of the state of Israel is much debated by many scholars regarding the Biblical account as unsupportable by archaeological discoveries. The area was eventually divided into two states, Judah in the north and Israel in the south. The former was conqured by the Assryrians. According to the Bible, the forces of Nekau

II defeated those of Josiah, king of Israel, when he invaded the area in support of Assyria. The state of Israel was later annexed by the Babylonians. See also JOSEPH.
ISTEMKHEB. The name of several princesses and members of the family of the high priests of Amun during Dynasty 21. The most important appears to have been a wife of the high priest Pinudjem I and a daughter of Pasebakhaenniut I, who married the high priest Menkheperre.
IULIUS ALEXANDER, TIBERIUS (c. 10–75 AD). Roman official. He was born in Alexandria, son of Alexander Lysimachus, head of the Jewish community. Alexander served as governor of Judaea (c. 46–48) and as prefect of Egypt, in which capacity he helped engineer the accession of Vespasian. He served on the staff of Titus during the siege of Jerusalem.
IULIUS CAESAR, CAIUS (100–44 BC). Roman dictator. Son of Caius Iulius Caesar and Aurelia. He had a successful political career culminating in the consulship of 59 BC. Caesar obtained an appointment as governor of Roman Gaul (then only covering modern Provence) and exhibited exceptional military skill in conquering the whole of Gaul (modern France and part of Belgium). Attacked by political opponents at home, he invaded Italy in 49 BC and was proclaimed dictator. Caesar defeated his rival, Gnaeus Pompeius, at Pharsalus and followed the latter’s flight to Egypt, where he discovered that Pompeius had been murdered and Egypt was engulfed in civil war between Ptolemy XIII and his sister, Cleopatra VII. He sided with Cleopatra, who became his mistress, and following the defeat and death of Ptolemy, he installed her as ruler of Egypt alongside her younger brother, Ptolemy XIV. She claimed that Caesar was the father of her son, Ptolemy XV, known as Caesarion. Cleopatra was in Rome when Caesar was assassinated in 44 BC. See also ANTONIUS, MARCUS.
IUPUT. The name of two kings and a royal prince of Dynasty 22 and Dynasty 23. Iuput (fl. 944–924), son of Sheshonq I, was installed as high priest of Amun to control Thebes on behalf of his father. Iuput I (reigned c. 805–783 BC) is attested as ruler in association with Pe

dubast I of Dynasty 23, but nothing is known of him. Iuput II (reigned c. 731–720 BC) had the throne name Usimaatre setepenamun and the epithet meryamun sibast. He is attested as ruler of Leontopolis in the stela of Piye.
–J
JOSEPH. Biblical hero, son of Jacob and Rachel, who was sold into slavery in Egypt and rose to the position of king’s chief minister or vizier. He later welcomed his father and family to settle in Egypt. The story exhibits knowledge of Egyptian customs, but it is debatable whether Joseph represents a historical figure. The background of the story may refer to the period when the Hyksos had gained power in Egypt. See also EXODUS; ISRAELITES.
JUBILEE. This heb-sed festival or jubilee was usually performed in a king’s 30th year and presumably consisted of rituals to rejuvenate him to continue his rule. It is possible that during prehistoric times the king may have been killed if he failed the ritual. Subsequent jubilees were performed at frequent intervals after year 30 until the death of the monarch.
JUSTINIAN (482–565 AD). Byzantine emperor. He was born as Petrus Sabbatius, son of Sabbatius in Tauresium 482. He was adopted by his maternal uncle, Emperor Justin I, and made coemperor in 527, succeeding to sole rule later in the year. He sought to expand the empire regaining Italy, North Africa, and parts of Spain. He also undetook the codification of the laws of the empire. He was a staunch adherent to the orthodox faith and unsympathetic to the Coptic church. He encouraged orthodox missionaries in Nubia and closed the temple of Philae, ending paganism in Egypt. He died in Constantinople on 14 November 565. See also THEODORA.

KADESH. An important city-state, now located in Syria; modern Tell Nebi Mend. The city became part of the Egyptian empire during

Dynasty 18. Its prince rebelled against Thutmose III but was forced to submit after the battle of Megiddo. The city later fell under Hittite control during the reign of Suppiluliuma I. It may have been briefly regained by Sety I. Around 1274 BC, Ramesses II sought to regain the lost Egyptian territory, but his forces were ambushed outside Kadesh by the Hittite army. Although his army was severely mauled, the Egyptian king managed to hold the Hittites back from his camp and avoid capture. The battle itself ended in stalemate, but the campaign was lost, and the Egyptians were forced to retreat. Upon his return to Egypt, Ramesses II had an account of the battle written and inscribed on temple walls to glorify his personal bravery despite the unfortunate outcome of the campaign. The Hittites more succinctly recorded an Egyptian defeat, and the northern part of the Egyptian empire in Syria, notably Amurru, remained in Hittite hands. See also WARFARE.
KAFR HASSAN DAOUD. Modern name for a cemetery site on the eastern edge of the Delta of Lower Egypt in the Wadi Tumilat. The area was surveyed in 1983, and remains were identified from the Predynastic Period to the Graeco-Roman Period. Kafr Hassan Daoud was excavated by an Egyptian expedition from 1988–1995 and since 1995 by a British-Egyptian expedition, which has uncovered more than 1,000 graves from the Predynastic Period (Naqada II) to the Early Dynastic Period. These burial places contain pottery and stone vessels, and the names of the kings Narmer and Qaa have been identified. See also ADAIMA; GERZEH; MINSHAT ABU OMAR; TELL EL-FARKHA; TELL IBRAHIM AWAD.
KAGEMNI (fl. 2613 BC). Legendary vizier of Huni of Dynasty 3 and Snefru of Dynasty 4. He was the recipient of a text of wisdom literature that has only survived in fragments and was undoubtedly composed at a later date. A historical vizier of this name is known from the reign of Teti of Dynasty 6 and may have served as a model for the literary text. His tomb was discovered in 1893 and more fully excavated during the 1920s.

KALABSHA. Modern name for the site in Nubia 50 kilometres south of Elephantine (Aswan) on the west bank of the Nile; Greek Talmis. There stood a temple rebuilt under Augustus dedicated to the Nubian god Mandulis. The area was flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake formed by the Aswan High Dam, but the temple was moved to a safer location from 1961–1963. During the course of this work, a gateway of the Graeco-Roman Period was discovered, which is now housed in the Berlin Egyptian Museum. See also ABU SIMBEL; AMADA; BEIT EL-WALI; GERF HUSSEIN; SOLEB.
KAMOSE (reigned c. 1555–1552 BC). Throne name Wadjkheperre. Last ruler of Dynasty 17 and prince of Thebes. He succeeded Seqenenre Tao, who may have been his father, and continued the war against the Hyksos. Kamose campaigned up to the walls of the Hyksos capital Avaris and also in Nubia. A stela giving details of his campaign was found at Karnak. His fate is unknown, but he was followed by Ahmose I, possibly his brother, who expelled the Hyksos from Egypt. See also AHHOTEP.
KARANIS. Modern Kom Aushim. A town during the Graeco-Roman Period in the Arsinoite nome of the Fayum. It flourished from the Ptolemaic Period until the 5th century AD. It was excavated by an expedition from the University of Michigan from 1924–1935 and found in an excellent state of preservation. Approximately 5,000 inscribed documents were recovered that illustrate life in Karanis, mainly in the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD.

KARNAK. The main temple of the god Amun at Thebes known in Egyptian as Iput-sut. The temple was known during the Middle Kingdom and was enlarged and embellished by successive rulers of the New Kingdom. Its great wealth led to an increase of political power for the high priest of Amun, under whom Thebes became virtually independent during the Third Intermediate Period. The temple

was sacked by the Assyrians in 663 BC, and although it was restored during the Ptolemaic Period, it never regained prominence. The site has been extensively excavated beginning in the 20th century and is currently being restored by the Centre Franco-Égyptien. More recent expeditions include the work of the Brooklyn Museum at the subsidiary temple of Mut since 1976.
KAROMAMA. Variants Karoma, Kamama. The name of several queens and princesses of Dynasty 22 and Dynasty 23, the first of which was the wife of Sheshonq I and mother of his heir, Osorkon I. A second was the wife of Osorkon II. Another queen, Karomama, was the daughter of Osorkon II’s Prince Nimlot, wife of Takelot II, and mother of the high priest of Amun Osorkon. The mother of Osorkon III was also named Kamama, probably a form of the name. A bronze statue, inlaid with gold, silver, and electrum, of the God’s Wife Karomama is now housed in the Louvre Museum.
KASHTA (fl. c. 750 BC). Nubian ruler. He appears to have gained control over the Theban region at the end of Dynasty 23 and installed his daughter, Amenirdis, as the adopted daughter and heiress of the God’s wife of Amun. See also ALARA.
KAWAB (fl. 2580 BC). Son of Khufu of Dynasty 4 and possibly Meritetes. He was apparently Khufu’s eldest son and destined successor, but he died before his father and was buried in a mastaba near Khufu’s pyramid at Giza. His widow, Hetepheres II, then married his brother, Khafre.
KAWIT (fl. 2020 BC). A minor wife of Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11. She was commemorated in a chapel and buried in a pit tomb at Mentuhotep’s funerary complex at Deir el-Bahri discovered during Henri Edouard Naville’s excavations at the site. Her sarcophagus is now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. See also ASHAYET; HENHENET; KEMSIT; MYT; NEFRU; SADEH; TEM.

duce. These depictions leave little doubt that they are Minoans from Crete, and the existence of Minoans in Egypt is confirmed by the discovery of Minoan pottery at Egyptian sites from the Middle Kingdom. Egyptian stone vessels found in Crete indicate a trading relationship beginning in the Early Dynastic Period. An inscription from the reign of Amenhotep III names several cities of the Keftyu, notably Knossos, but it is unclear whether the reference is contemporary or based on earlier records. Recent discoveries of Minoan frescoes at Avaris confirm the presence of Minoan traders or artists in Egypt beginning in the late Second Intermediate Period or early Dynasty 18. See also TRADE.
KEMSIT (fl. 2020 BC). A minor wife of Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11. She was commemorated in a chapel and buried in a pit tomb at Mentuhotep’s funerary complex at Deir el-Bahri discovered during Henri Edouard Naville’s excavations at the site. Fragments of her chapel and sarcophagus are now housed in the British Museum. See also ASHAYET; HENHENET; KAWIT; MYT; NEFRU; SADEH; TEM.
KENHERKHEPESHEF (fl. 1270–1200 BC). Chief scribe of the Deir el-Medina community from the middle of the reign of Ramesses II until Sety II. Son of Panakht and Sentnefer. He appears to have been adopted by the scribe Ramose and succeeded him in his office. He is known as a collector of historical and religious manuscripts, including an account of the Battle of Kadesh written in his own hand and a dream book giving interpretations of dreams. His interest in previous rulers is attested by a brief king list, also in his own hand. His tomb has not been discovered, and he appears to have died childless. He was survived upon his death by his widow, Naunakhte, who must have been several decades younger than him as she remarried the workman Khaemnun and had eight children. She survived until the reign of Ramesses V when her will was written. She apparently inherited the papers of her first husband, which were passed on to her sons by the second marriage. They added to the archive, notably with the literary text The Contendings of Horus and Seth. The archive was uncovered in the 1920s and is preserved in several museums.

KENHERKHEPESHEF • 109



KERMA. Site of a major city in Nubia near the Third Cataract and apparent capital of the Nubian kingdom, Kush, founded by a population related to the C-group people from the Old Kingdom, which was especially prominent during the Second Intermediate Period when an alliance was attempted with the Hyksos against the rulers of Thebes of Dynasty 17. The kingdom of Kush was regarded as a major threat by the Egyptians and was destroyed in a series of campaigns at the beginning of Dynasty 18, after which the area was incorporated as a province of Egypt. The site is dominated by two large brick constructions known as the Upper Deffufa and the Lower Deffufa of uncertain usage. The area was excavated by George Reisner from 1913–1916 for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and more recently by a Swiss expedition under Charles Bonnet.
KHA (fl. 1390 BC). Foreman in the community of Deir el-Medina during Dynasty 18, probably during the reign of Thutmose IV and Amenhotep III. He is known from his undecorated tomb that was discovered with its contents still intact by an Italian expedition in 1906. The mummies of Kha and his wife, Meret, together with the coffins and other objects from the tomb, are now preserved in the Turin Egyptian Museum.
KHABA (reigned c. 2648–2640 BC). Horus name of an obscure king of Dynasty 3. He apparently was the builder of the unfinished pyramid located at Zawiyet el-Aryan.
KHABABASH (reigned c. 338–337 BC). Egyptian ruler who is attested on several documents, including an inscription on the sarcophagus of an Apis bull of his second year. He appears to have held office during the later Persian Period as a rebel against their rule, but his origin and exact date are not known.
KHAEMWESE (fl. c. 1285–1230 BC). Fourth son of Ramesses II by Isitnofret. He was appointed to the priesthood of Ptah and eventually reached the position of high priest of Ptah at Memphis and briefly served as crown prince before predeceasing his father. He may have been buried in the Serapeum. Khaemwese undertook restoration works of older monuments, including the pyramids at

Abusir and Saqqara. In later literature, he is portrayed as a learned but not necessarily wise magician. A like-named son of Ramesses III, who died young, is known from his tomb (QV44) in the Valley of the Queens. See also AMENHERKHEPESHEF; MERENPTAH; MERYATUM; PREHERWENEMEF; SETY.
KHAFRE (reigned c. 2558–2532 BC). His name might be read as Rakhaef and was known in Greek as Chephren. Son of Khufu of Dynasty 4. He succeeded his brother, Djedefre. For his burial, he moved back to the site at Giza and erected the second pyramid at that site close to that of his father. His valley temple was excavated in 1860 and yielded much fine sculpture. It is believed that his architects fashioned the Sphinx after his likeness from a rocky outcrop near his pyramid. See also HARDJEDEF; MENKAURE.
KHAKHEPERRESENEB. The ostensible author of a text of wisdom literature composed during the Middle Kingdom that consists of a series of complaints about the state of Egypt.
KHAMERERNEBTY. The name of two queens, mother and daughter, of Dynasty 4. It is generally thought that the elder married Khafre and that their daughter then became the wife of Menkaure, but formal proof is lacking, although it seems likely that the elder was the mother of Menkaure. The younger was buried in a tomb at Giza in the cemetery near the pyramid of Khafre originally designed for her mother.
KHARGA OASIS. Possibly Ancient Egyptian Wehat resyt, meaning southern oasis. An oasis in the Western Desert west of Luxor. Prehistoric remains have been discovered there, but evidence from the Pharaonic Period is lacking. The surviving archaeological sites date from the Graeco-Roman Period and Byzantine Period, apart from the temple at Hibis, which was begun during the Persian Period. The area was excavated by an expedition from the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1907–1909, 1927–1928, and 1930–1931. These were followed by French expeditions, notably beginning in 1976 at the site of Dush, a Roman settlement abandoned during the 5th century AD; since 1993 at Ayn Manawir, which dates from the Late

Period to the Graeco-Roman Period; and since 1998 at El-Deir. See also BAHARIYA OASIS; DAKHLA OASIS; FARFARA OASIS; SIWA OASIS.
KHASEKHEMWY (reigned c. 2710 BC). Final ruler of Dynasty 2. Probably identical with a King Khasekhem attested on contemporary monuments. He appears to have ended the religious conflict between the supporters of Horus and Seth by adopting both gods as part of the serekh of the royal titulary. His statues found at Hierakonpolis represent the king as victorious over northern enemies in Lower Egypt. He built an elaborate tomb at Abydos and a massive palace structure that may have served as a mortuary temple.
KHAYAN (reigned c. 1600 BC). Throne name Sewoserenre. Hyksos ruler of Dynasty 15. Monuments of his have been found in Crete and Baghdad, but it is uncertain when they were removed from Egypt. The discovery of Cretan frescoes at his capital, Avaris, strengthens the idea of direct relations between Crete and Egypt at the time. A stela names his eldest son and presumed successor, Iannas. See also APEPI; SALITIS.
KHENDJER (reigned c. 1750 BC). Throne name Userkare. A ruler of Dynasty 13. He is known principally for his pyramid tomb, which was built at Saqqara and excavated by Gustave Jécquier from 1929–1931. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
KHENEMET-NEFER-HEDJET. The name of a princess and two queens of Dynasty 12. The princess was a daughter of Amenemhat II, but her fate is unknown, although she might be identical with Queen Khenemet-nefer-hedjet the elder. Queen Khenemet-neferhedjet the elder was the chief wife of Senusret II and mother of Senusret III, while Khenemet-nefer-hedjet the younger was the wife of Senusret III. The parentage of either queen is uncertain. The name was later used as a royal title for the queen.
KHENETHAP (fl. 3080). Queen of Egypt. Wife of Aha of Dynasty 1 and mother of Djer. She may be the earliest attested queen in Egypt, but the position of Neithhotep is uncertain.
112 • KHASEKHEMWY



KHENTIKHA (fl. 2225 BC). Governor of Dakhla Oasis under Pepy II of Dynasty 6. Son of Ima-Pepy II, a previous governor. His tomb is the most impressive in the series of official tombs. He is also credited with the building of the governor’s palace at Balat.
KHENTKAUES. The name of two queen mothers of Dynasty 5. Khentkaues I was buried at Giza, where her tomb was excavated in 1932, while the tomb of Khentkaues II was excavated at Abusir from 1978–1981. The theory that Khentkaues I was a princess of Dynasty 4 who linked the two dynasties has been abandoned since she is nowhere styled the daughter of a king. She was the mother or wife of Userkaf or Sahure, while Khentkaues II was the wife of Neferirkare and mother of Raneferef and Niuserre. It seems that both may have been mothers of two kings and played important political roles, possibly as regents for a minor king or during a disputed succession. See also ABUSIR PAPYRI.
KHEPRI. An Egyptian deity in the form of a scarab-headed figure. He was an aspect of the sun god at dawn and often identified with the god Atum and so associated with resurrection. See also ATEN; RE; RELIGION.
KHETY. The name of several kings of Dynasty 9 and Dynasty 10 based in Herakleopolis. Their reigns are obscure, and little documentation survives from the period.
KHETY (fl. 1960 BC). Author and sage who lived during Dynasty 12. He was the author of The Satire on Trades, a popular composition extolling the profession of the scribe and denigrating others. He may also have composed The Instructions of King Amenemhat I, which was assigned to the king.
KHNUM. The ram-headed creator god of Elephantine. He was believed to fashion the souls of the living on his potter’s wheel and so was also a patron of potters. He was associated with the goddesses Anukis and Satis. See also RELIGION.
KHNUMHOTEP I (fl. 1985–1945 BC). Nomarch of the 16th Upper Egyptian nome and governor of the Eastern Desert. He was a
KHNUMHOTEP I • 113



contemporary of Amenemhat I of Dynasty 12, who confirmed him in office, and Senusret I. He took part in military expeditions to Nubia and against the Asiatics. His tomb with biographical texts is located at Beni Hasan in Middle Egypt.
KHNUMHOTEP II (fl. 1910–1874 BC). Nomarch of the 16th Upper Egyptian nome and governor of the Eastern Desert. Son of Nehri and Baqet, daughter of Khnumhotep I. He was a contemporary of Amenemhat II and Senusret II. He maintained the family’s power in Middle Egypt. His tomb, which depicts a famous scene of the arrival of Asiatic nomads, with biographical texts is located at Beni Hasan.
KHONSU. Moon god. His principal place of worship was Thebes, where he was regarded as a son of Amun and his consort, Mut. He is attested from the Old Kingdom but gained greater prominence during the New Kingdom with the growth of the cult of Amun. He had a separate temple within the Karnak complex. He is depicted as a human or hawkheaded deity with a lunar crescent. His cult continued during the Graeco-Roman Period, and at Kom Ombo he was worshipped as a son of Sobek and Hathor. See also IAH; RELIGION.
KHUFU (reigned c. 2592–2566 BC). The Greek form of his name is Cheops. Second king of Dynasty 4, son of Snefru and Hetepheres I. The Great Pyramid at Giza was built during his reign as his tomb, surrounded by the mastaba tombs of his family and officials, including his vizier, Hemiunu. Little is known about his reign, but he was remembered in later times as a harsh ruler. According to the Turin Royal Canon, he reigned for 23 years, but an inscription, apparently of his year 27, has recently been discovered. See also BAUEFRE; DJEDEFRE; HARDJEDEF; KAWAB; KHAFRE; MERITETES.
KING LISTS. Lists of kings and their reign lengths seem to have been kept in early dynastic times for religious and chronological use. No complete list has survived, but the Turin Royal Canon written during the Ramesside Period is the most complete record with many ex

act reign lengths. Other offering lists to deceased kings appear in tombs and temples. One difficulty with these lists lies in the fact that some rulers reigned contemporaneously as coregents or rivals, which is rarely indicated. See also CHRONOLOGY; MANETHO.
KIYA (fl. 1340 BC). Secondary wife of Akhenaten, of unknown origin. There has been much speculation about her background and possible children, but nothing is known about her except her name, which is found erased on many monuments. See also NEFERTITI.
KOM ABU BILLO. Modern name for a site in the third nome of Lower Egypt on the western edge of the Delta; Greek Terenuthis, possibly ancient Egyptian Perhathornebetmefkat. The principal deity of the town may have originally been Hathor and later the snake goddess Renenutet. The necropolis dates from the Old Kingdom but has yielded many stelae from the Roman Period that depict the deceased in Greek costume either standing with arms raised or reclining on a couch often associated with such Egyptian gods as Anubis or Horus, sometimes with texts in Greek. The area was first excavated on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund from 1887–1888 when remains of a Ptolemaic temple were discovered. Further excavations were carried out by the University of Michigan in 1935 and the Egyptian Antiquities Service from 1970–1971.
KOM AL-KHILGAN. Modern name for a site in the northeastern Delta of Lower Egypt near Tell el-Farkha and Minshat Abu Omar. The remains date from the Predynastic Period to the Second Intermediate Period. It has been excavated since 2002 by a joint French–Egyptian team.
KOM EL-AHMAR SAWARIS. Possibly ancient Hut-nesut, capital of the 18th nome of Upper Egypt. The site near modern Sharuna dates from the Old Kingdom to the Coptic Period and features Old Kingdom tombs, notably one of Pepiankh of Dynasty 6 and the remains of a Ptolemaic temple from the Graeco-Roman Period. It was excavated by a Polish team in 1907, Egyptian archaeologists in 1976 and 1980, and a German expedition from 1984–1989.
KOM EL-AHMAR SAWARIS • 115



KOM EL-HISN. The modern name for a site in the western Delta south of Naukratis, ancient Imu. Remains have been found from the Old Kingdom to the Roman Period. The main temple was dedicated to the dual goddess Sakhmet-Hathor. It became the capital of the third nome of Lower Egypt during the New Kingdom. Kom elHisn was first surveyed in 1885 and again in 1980, and excavations were carried out by an Egyptian expedition from 1943–1946, an American team in 1984 and 1986, and an Egyptian expedition from the University of Alexandria, Damanhur branch beginning in 2001.
KOM FIRIN. Modern name for a settlement site in the western Delta of Lower Egypt whose surviving remains date from the New Kingdom to the Late Period. At least one temple with inscriptions of Ramesses II have been identified. The site was excavated by the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1911 and from 1949–1951 and has been the subject of a survey and excavations by a British team since 2002.
KOM KHELWA. Modern name for a site in the northwest Fayum near Medinet Madi. It is the site of a Middle Kingdom cemetery that includes the tomb of Wadjet, governor of the Fayum during Dynasty 12. It was surveyed by an Italian expedition in 1981 and excavations commenced in 1991.

KOM OMBO. The modern name for a site on the east bank of the Nile in the first nome of southern Upper Egypt, ancient Egyptian Nebit, Greek Ombos. The principal surviving monument consists of a temple from the Ptolemaic Period dedicated to the gods Sobek and Horus in the form of Haroeris and their respective wives and sons. The temple was cleared by the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1893 and is being published by a French expedition. The nearby town has not been excavated. See also DENDERA; EDFU; ESNA.
KOM TALIT. Ancient Talit, a Graeco-Roman site in the Fayum, now largely destroyed. It once featured a temple to Taweret. The area was

KUMMA. Modern name for a site in lower Nubia in the Second Cataract region where a fortress was erected during Dynasty 12, probably by Senusret III, as part of the Egyptian garrison. Egyptian Itnw Pedjut. The area has now been flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake of the Aswan High Dam. See also ANIBA; ASKUT; BUHEN; MIRGISSA; SEMNA; SHALFAK; URONARTI.
KV. An abbreviation used by Egyptologists to denote the Valley of the Kings on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes. Sometimes the further abbreviation of WV is used to denote the west valley of the burial ground. The numbering of the tombs was begun by John Gardner Wilkinson. Some pit tombs and tentative constructions have not been numbered. Most of the tombs had been plundered in antiquity, although the royal tomb of Tutankhamun and several private tombs have been found intact. The royal tombs of Dynasty 18 were decorated by painted plaster, but from Horemheb onward the tombs were carved in raised relief and then painted. See also DEIR EL-MEDINA.
KV1. The tomb of Ramesses VII of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity and was noted by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. The tomb was cleared by Edwin Brock during the 1980s and 1990s. The king’s mummy remains unidentified.
KV2. The tomb of Ramesses IV of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity and was noted by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. A sketch plan of the tomb has survived on a papyrus in Turin Egyptian Museum and on an ostracon. The mummy of the king was found in the royal cache in KV35 in 1898.

KV3. An unfinished tomb in the Valley of the Kings dated by a cartouche to the time of Ramesses III. It was seen by James Burton in the early 19th century and cleared by Harry Burton in 1912. It is not certain if it was originally intended for the king and then abandoned or was for one of his children.
KV4. The tomb of Ramesses XI of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity and was cleared by an American expedition in 1979, when foundation deposits were discovered. It was the last royal tomb built in the valley and was never used by the king, who was buried in the north.
KV5. The tomb of the children of Ramesses II of Dynasty 19 in the Valley of the Kings. It may have been seen by the traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738 but was first firmly recorded by James Burton in 1825, although not cleared. American archaeologist Kent Weeks began clearance in 1987 and found evidence of the burial of the sons of Ramesses II, including inscriptions of Ameherkhepeshef, Ramesses, Sety, and Meryatum. The design of the tomb is unique, with more than 150 rooms, including chapels for the various sons. It is undoubtedly the tomb of the royal children mentioned on a papyrus now in the Turin Egyptian Museum.
KV6. The tomb of Ramesses IX of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity. It was examined by British consul Henry Salt, and a number of objects were recovered, which are now housed in the British Musuem. It was further cleared by Georges Daressy in 1888. A plan of the tomb can be found on an ostracon in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. The king’s mummy was discovered in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri.
KV7. The tomb of Ramesses II of Dynasty 19 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity but has been badly damaged by flooding. It has not been throughly excavated until recently, but it was investigated by a French expedition beginning in 1991. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881.

KV8. The tomb of Merenptah of Dynasty 19 in the Valley of the Kings. It has been stood open since antiquity. It was seen by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. It was cleared by Howard Carter in 1903 and Edwin Brock from 1987–1988 and 1994–1995. A French expedition has been working in the tomb since 2002. The king’s mummy was discovered in KV35 in 1898. One of the king’s stone sarcophagi was reused for the burial of King Pasebakhaenniut I at Tanis.
KV9. The tomb of Ramesses VI of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It was known as the tomb of Memnon and has stood open since antiquity. It was seen by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. It was cleared by James Burton in the 1820s and Georges Daressy in 1888 and later examined by Edwin Brock beginning in 1985. The first chambers are inscribed for Ramesses V, and it is probable that the tomb was originally intended for him and usurped by his successor. It is unlikely that a double burial was intended. The mummies of both kings were found in the royal cache in KV35. The head of a sarcophagus lid found there is now housed in the British Museum.
KV10. The tomb of Amenmesse of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity. It was noted by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. It was cleared by Edward Ayrton in 1907 and has been investigated by American archaeologist Otto Schaden since 1993. The tomb has yielded objects mentioning Queen Takhat, who may be Amenmesse’s mother. The king’s mummy has not been recovered.
KV11. The tomb of Ramesses III of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity. The tomb was originally intended for Sethnakhte but was abandoned when it broke into KV10. The builders for Ramesses III realigned the axis of the tomb to complete it for the king. It was seen by traveler James Bruce in 1768, and he later printed an engraving of the scene of the harper, the first scene from the royal tombs to be published. Since then it has also been known as Bruce’s tomb. The tomb was entered by Giovanni

Battista Belzoni in 1816, when he removed the sarcophagus. Its lid is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and the lower part is in the Louvre Museum. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881.
KV12. An undecorated multichamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It may have been seen by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738 and was cleared by James Burton during the 1820s. The site was also examined by Harold Jones from 1908–1909, Howard Carter from 1920–1921, and Otto Schaden from 1993–1994.
KV13. The tomb of the chancellor Bay, an official of Siptah of Dynasty 19, in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity. Following Bay’s execution, the tomb was vandalized, and his name was excised so that only his title remains. It appears to have been reused for two princes of Dynasty 20. The tomb was cleared by a German expedition from 1988–1994.
KV14. The tomb of Sethnakhte of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It was originally built for Queen Tewosret and possibly her husband, Sety II, but taken over by Sethnakhte. It has stood open since antiquity. There is a record of work on the queen’s tomb in year 2, probably by her husband. It was seen by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. The tomb was cleared by a German expedition from 1983–1987. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881.
KV15. The tomb of Sety II of Dynasty 19 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity. It was seen by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738. The tomb is unfinished. It is not certain if it was his original tomb or whether he was moved here after KV14 was taken over by Sethnakhte. It was examined by Howard Carter from 1903–1904. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache in KV35 in 1898. A plan of the tomb on an ostracon is now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum.

zoni. Some surviving wooden objects from the tomb are now housed in the British Museum. The king’s mummy has not been securely identified, but an alleged mummy, which was formerly in the Niagara Falls Museum in Canada and the William C. Carlos Museum in Atlanta, was returned to the Cairo Egyptian Museum in 2003.
KV17. The tomb of Sety I of Dynasty 19 in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni in October 1817. It is one of the best preserved tombs in the valley with most of the painted scenes intact. Belzoni’s rather garbled copies created a sensation when exhibited in London. The tomb has been damaged, with some scenes lost since its discovery. The alabaster sarcophagus was removed by Belzoni and now is in Sir John Soane’s Museum in London. The king’s mummy was discovered in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881.
KV18. The tomb of Ramesses X of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It has stood open since antiquity. It was recorded by traveler Richard Pococke during his visit to the valley in 1738 and James Burton in 1825. Howard Carter found foundation deposits in 1902. A full clearance of the tomb commenced in 1998 by a Swiss expedition. The king’s mummy has not been located.
KV19. The tomb of Prince Ramesses-Mentuherkhepeshef, son of Ramesses IX of Dynasty 20 in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni in 1817 and cleared by Edward Ayrton from 1905–1906.
KV20. An undecorated tomb in the Valley of the Kings sometimes attributed to Thutmose I of Dynasty 18, in which case it was his original tomb built by Ineni, but it is more likely that of his daughter, Hatshepsut. If the latter, Hatshepsut likely intended it as a double burial with her father, as funerary equipment of both were found there. The tomb descent is very steep, and at 100 yards, is the longest in the Valley of the Kings. Hatshepsut’s sarcophagus is now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, while that of her father is preserved in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. The tomb was opened in 1799 and recorded by Giovanni Battista Belzoni in 1817 but not entirely

cleared until 1903–1904 by Howard Carter. It was reexamined again in 1980. See also KV38.
KV21. A small, undecorated tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni in October 1817 and reexamined by a team from Pacific Lutheran University from 1989–1990. It consists of a single chamber with a small side storage room. It was robbed in antiquity. Two female mummies were found there. It possibly dates to Dynasty 18.
KV22. The tomb of Amenhotep III of Dynasty 18 in the west valley of the Valley of the Kings. It was first noted by members of a French expedition in 1799, and it was cleared by Howard Carter in 1915 and has been reexamined by a Japanese expedition since 1989. The tomb may well have been begun by Thutmose IV, whose foundation deposits were found. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache in KV35 in 1898. It has been speculated that his wife, Tiy, was also buried in the tomb, as frgaments of her sarcophagus were discovered.
KV23. The tomb of Ay of Dynasty 18 in the west valley of the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni in 1816 and reexamined by Otto Schaden in 1972. It has been suggested that it was originally destined for Tutankhamun but was taken over by Ay, who buried his predecessor in a lesser tomb. The king’s mummy has not been identified.
KV24. A small, one-chamber tomb in the west valley of the Valley of the Kings. It was noted by John Gardner Wilkinson and excavated by Otto Schaden from 1991–1992, when evidence of later burials was found. The tomb probably dates to Dynasty 18.
KV25. An unfinished tomb in the west valley of the Valley of the Kings. It consists of only two corridors. It was discovered by Giovanni Battista Belzoni in 1817 and cleared by Otto Schaden in 1972. It dates to the end of Dynasty 18. It has been speculated that it may be the original Theban tomb of Akhenaten before his move to Amarna.

KV31. A small tomb or pit in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered in 1817 by the Earl of Belmore under the direction of Giovanni Battista Belzoni. Its present location is unknown.
KV32. A small, undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898 and reexcavated by a Swiss team beginning in 2001 and identified from fragments of a canopic chest as made for Queen Tiaa, mother of Thutmose IV. It dates to Dynasty 18.

KV35. The tomb of Amenhotep II of Dynasty 18 in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Victor Loret in 1898. This tomb was used as a royal cache for some mummies of pharaohs, so it was presumably sealed during Dynasty 21. The king’s mummy is the only royal one, aside from Tutankhamun, found in its original tomb.
KV36. The tomb of the royal fanbearer Maiherperi of Dynasty 18 in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered largely intact by Victor Loret in 1899 and consists of a single, undecorated chamber with a small annex. It was robbed in antiquity, but only a few precious items have been removed. Most of the funerary equipment and the mummy, although damaged, remained. The occupant is otherwise unknown but must have been a favored courtier.

It is not clear if the tomb was the king’s original burial place constructed by Ineni from which his body was transferred to KV20 and then back again or a reburial when his body was removed from KV20. His mummy has not been securely identified.
KV39. An undecorated royal tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Victor Loret in 1899 and reexamined by John Rose from 1989–1994. It has been speculated that it may be the lost tomb of Amenhotep I.
KV40. A small tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Victor Loret in 1899, but no details have been published. It likely dates to Dynasty 18.

KV41. A small tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Victor Loret in 1899, but no details have been published. It likely dates to Dynasty 18.
KV42. An undecorated, multichambered tomb with such royal attributes as a cartouche-shaped burial chamber in the Valley of the Kings. It may have ben discovered by Victor Loret at the end of the 19th century, but it was cleared under the supervision of Howard Carter in 1900. Remains from private burials of Dynasty 18 were found but were probably intrusive. In 1921, Carter discovered foundation deposits of Queen Meryetre Hatshepsut, wife of Thutmose III and mother of Amenhotep II, so the tomb was likely intended for her.
KV43. The tomb of Thutmose IV of Dynasty 18 in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Howard Carter in 1903. Although robbed, a number of pieces of funerary equipment were recovered, including shabtis and foundation deposits. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache in KV35.
KV44. An undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Howard Carter in 1901. It contained several private coffins and mummies. It was examined again by a team from Pacific Lutheran University from 1990–1991. It likely dates to Dynasty 18.
KV45. An undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Howard Carter in 1902. It contained canopic jar fragments of Userhat of Dynasty 18, who may have been the original occupant, as well as later material. It was examined again by a team from Pacific Lutheran University from 1990–1991.
KV46. The intact tomb of Yuya, father of Queen Tiy and father-in-law of Amenhotep III, and his wife, Tuya, in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by James Quibell in 1905. The contents, which include the mummies of the couple, are now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum.
KV46 • 125



KV47. The tomb of Siptah of Dynasty 19 in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1905 and cleared inside by Harry Burton in 1912 and outside by Howard Carter in 1922. The tomb and its environs have been under investigation by a Swiss expedition since 1998. The king’s mummy was found in the royal cache in KV35 in 1898.
KV48. A single, undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1906. The tomb had been robbed, but a mummy and some funerary equipment were recovered, naming the vizier Amenemopet under Amenhotep II of Dynasty 18, the presumed original owner.
KV49. A small corridor tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1906. It likely dates to Dynasty 18 and may later have been used as a storeroom.
KV50. An undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1906. It contained a mummified monkey and dog.
KV51. An undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1906. It contained mummified animals.
KV52. An undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1906. It contained a mummified monkey.
KV53. An undecorated, single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1906.
KV54. A small pit tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered in 1907 and contained embalming materials from the burial of Tutankhamun. It was relocated and examined by a Swiss expedition from 1998–1999.
KV55. One of the most controversial tombs in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in 1907. It had remained largely
126 • KV47



intact and contained a skeleton in a wooden coffin and other funerary equipment, some inscribed with the name of Queen Tiy. The names on the coffin had been erased. The body has been scientifically examined and proved to be that of a young male. It has been tentatively identified as that of Smenkhkare, but some believe that it is the body of Akhenaten, although the age does not fit. The tomb was evidently a reburial brought from Amarna. The material is now in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. The tomb was recleared by Lyla Pinch Brock from 1993–1996.
KV56. An undecorated single-chamber tomb in the Valley of the Kings known as the Gold Tomb. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in January 1906. Gold and silver jewelry was recovered bearing the names Sety II and Queen Tewosret. It has been speculated that this was material from the queen’s tomb or perhaps that the tomb belonged to a child of the royal couple.
KV57. The tomb of Horemheb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Edward Ayrton in February 1906. It is one of the finest tombs in the valley, with most of the painting preserved, apart from scenes in sketch outline. It is the first tomb with painted raised relief instead of the painted plaster walls of earlier Dynasty 18 tombs. The king’s mummy has not been recovered. A British expedition is currently reexcavating material in the tomb.
KV58. A small, undecorated tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Harold Jones in 1909. The finds consisted of an alabsater shabti, sheets of gold foil, alabaster knobs, and faience box handles, which may have come from the tomb of Ay.
KV59. A small, undecorated pit tomb in the Valley of the Kings.
KV60. A small, undecorated tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Howard Carter in 1903. It contained some mummified geese and meat offerings and two female mummies. One mummy was in a coffin inscibed with the name of the great royal nurse In-Sitre. The tomb was reopened by Edward Ayrton in 1906, and the coffin and mummy were likely then removed to the Cairo Egyptian Museum. The other mummy remained in the tomb, which
KV60 • 127



was opened again in 1989–1990, when it was cleared by a team from Pacific Lutheran University. It was long suggested that one of the female mummies might be that of Queen Hatshepsut, and it was confirmed that the mummy in the coffin was indeed hers in 2007 by matching a broken tooth in a box with her name to a similar broken tooth on the mummy.
KV61. A small, undecorated pit tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by Harold Jones in 1910. It appears to have been abandoned unused.
KV62. The tomb of Tutankhamun in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered intact by Howard Carter in 1922. It consists of three rooms on one level: an antechamber leading to the main burial chamber and a storage annex off the antechamber. Only the burial chamber was decorated with painted reliefs. These works of art depict the funeral of the king carried out by his successor, Ay. It appears that the tomb was hastily built upon the unexpected death of the king. The rich contents have been removed to the Cairo Egyptian Museum, but the inner coffin and the king’s mummy remain in the tomb.
KV63. The most recently discovered tomb in the Valley of the Kings. It was discovered by an American expedition in February 2006. It consists of one small, undecorated chamber off the main shaft. Seven coffins, filled mainly with funerary material and 28 storage jars, were found inside. The tomb is dated to the end of Dynasty 18 by necropolis sealings.

LAHUN. Modern name for a site near the Fayum, also known as Illahun, where the pyramid complex of Senusret II of Dynasty 12 was built. At Kahun, a nearby site, the village for the workmen who constructed the pyramid was laid out and later used by the community of priests that served the royal cult. The area was excavated from

LANGUAGE. The ancient Egyptian language belongs to the AfroAsiatic group of languages and has affinities with both North African and Semitic languages and possibly devolved before these two groups separated. The language did not remain unchanged but rather went through five linguistic stages. Old Egyptian was used during the Old Kingdom and expressed in written form by hieroglyphic and hieratic writing. The next phase, Middle Egyptian, was first used during the Middle Kingdom and later regarded as the classical form of the language by subsequent generations. Late Egyptian was in use during the New Kingdom but was replaced by demotic during the Late Period, which used new grammatical and written forms until it also died out as a written language during the Roman Period. Coptic was introduced during the Christian period. Regional variations only become apparent during the Coptic period but must have existed in earlier times. During its long history, the Egyptian language borrowed many words from Semitic languages during the New Kingdom and later from Greek languages.
LAPIS LAZULI. A blue gemstone thought to originate in Afghanistan during ancient times. It has been used for jewelry and vessels in Egypt since the Predynastic Period (Naqada I) and must have reached Egypt via trade routes. The gem was highly prized and during the New Kingdom was imitated by blue glass.
LATE PERIOD (664–332 BC). A term used by Egyptologists for the period from the beginning of Dynasty 26 until the conquest of Egypt by Alexander the Great. Some scholars also include Dynasty 25. During this time, the royal court was located in the Delta at Sais and other cities. Egyptian rulers attempted to maintain the independence of the country against outside aggression from Persia but were ultimately unsuccessful.

LEONTOPOLIS. Greek name for the Egyptian Ta-remu, modern Tell el-Muqdam in the Delta 50 miles north of Cairo. Capital of the 11th nome of Lower Egypt. The principal deity was the lion god Mahes. The remains date from the Middle Kingdom to the Graeco-Roman Period. Little is left of the city now. It was examined by Auguste Mariette in 1889 and excavated by Henri Edouard Naville in 1892. In 1915, the burial of a Queen Kama, possibly a shortened form of Karomama, of the Third Intermediate Period was discovered at the site. The city was investigated by an American expedition from 1992–1998.
LEPSIUS, (KARL) RICHARD (1810–1884). German Egyptologist. He was born in Naumburg, Germany, on 23 December 1810. He studied Egyptology in Paris and Germany. From 1842–1845, Lepsius was sent to Egypt with a Prussian expedition that collected antiquities for the Berlin Egyptian Museum, but he and his colleagues also took copious notes on and made drawings of standing monuments, which were later published in 12 volumes. In 1846, he was appointed professor at Berlin University and in 1855 vice director of the Berlin Museum, succeeding as director in 1865. Lepsius continued JeanFrançois Champollion’s research into ancient Egyptian grammar and helped perfect the understanding of the ancient language. He died in Berlin, Germany, on 10 July 1884.
LIGHTHOUSE. See PHAROS.
LISHT. Modern name for the city of Itjtawy, capital of Dynasty 12 located in the Fayum. The town itself is unexcavated, but the pyramids of Amenemhat I and his son, Senusret I, and their officials are located nearby. The site was excavated by the French from 1894–1995 and the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1906–1934 and 1984–1989.

LITERATURE. A great variety of types of literature has survived from ancient Egypt from all periods. These include the didactic wisdom
130 • LEONTOPOLIS



literature; poetry, including love poems from the New Kingdom; hymns; and a large number of stories and folktales, some purely entertaining but with a moral point and others mythological in content. Royal inscriptions and religious texts could be written in a poetical vein. See also DJEHUTY; SHIPWRECKED SAILOR; SINUHE; TALE OF THE DOOMED PRINCE, THE; TALE OF THE ELOQUENT PEASANT, THE; TALE OF THE TWO BROTHERS, THE; TALE OF TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD, THE; WENAMUN; WESTCAR PAPYRUS.
LOUVRE MUSEUM. Following the French Revolution, the Louvre Palace in Paris, France, was turned into a museum but contained only few Egyptian objects. In 1824, the French government acquired the Durand collection of 1,225 small Egyptian antiquities, and in 1826, through the efforts of Jean-François Champollion, the second collection of Henry Salt, the British consul general in Egypt, comprising 4,000 pieces, was purchased. A separate Egyptian section was established in the Louvre in 1826, with Champollion as its curator. The collection was enriched by further purchases, notably the Bernardino Drovetti collection in 1827, and objects acquired by Champollion during his tour of Egypt from 1828–1829. Further antiquities were received from the excavations of Auguste Mariette at the Serapeum and the work of the French Institute, which undertook excavations throughout Egypt. Among its chief pieces are a stela from King Djet’s tomb dating to Dynasty 1 from Abydos, the Seated Scribe from the Old Kingdom, and the bronze statue inlaid with gold, silver, and electrum of Princess Karomama of Dynasty 22. See also BERLIN EGYPTIAN MUSEUM; BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS; BRITISH MUSEUM; CAIRO EGYPTIAN MUSEUM; METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART; TURIN EGYPTIAN MUSEUM.
LOWER EGYPT. Ancient Egyptian Tamehu. The area of Egypt comprising the Nile Delta from the Mediterranean Sea north to Memphis. It appears to have evolved into a separate kingdom, possibly with its capital at Buto, during the Predynastic Period and was united, forcibly or not, with Upper Egypt to form a single country described in Egyptian texts as the Two Lands. The symbol of Lower Egypt was the sedge plant, which formed part of the royal title with
LOWER EGYPT • 131



the bee of Upper Egypt. The tutelary goddess Wadjet was represented as a serpent, or uraeus, on the royal brow. The royal crown of Lower Egypt, known as the red crown, consisted of a flat top with a vertical section at the back. See also MIDDLE EGYPT.
LUXOR. Modern name for the town on the site of ancient Thebes. The name is used by Egyptologists to refer to the temple in Luxor, known to the Egyptians as Iput-rsyt, as distinct from the temple of Karnak, or Iput-sut, now on the outskirts of the town. The Luxor temple was built by Amenhotep III and apparently dedicated to the ka, the soul of the king. Reliefs feature the divine birth of the king. The temple was later enlarged by Tutankhamun and Ramesses II. A procession of ram-headed sphinxes connected the temple to that of Karnak. During the main religious festival, the sacred image of the god Amun would proceed from Karnak to Luxor on a barque carried by priests. During the 4th century AD, part of the temple was converted into a church and later a mosque. A Muslim religious festival celebrating a local saint incorporates some features of the ancient Egyptian ritual. A major cache of New Kingdom statues was recovered here in 1989.
–M
MAADI. Modern name for a suburb south of Cairo where excavations by Cairo University from 1930–1953 uncovered a settlement and cemeteries dating to the late Predynastic Period. The remains included huts and storage pits for grain and pottery, both local and imported, from Palestine. The local culture is different from that of Upper Egypt of the Naqada Period, which is believed to be in part contemporary and was thought to represent a separate culture of Lower Egypt, although excavations at Minshat Abu Omar and elsewhere in the Delta reveal Naqada culture there. A German expedition investigated the site from 1999–2002.
MAAT. The Egyptian concept of righteous order, often translated as truth and symbolized by a feather or a goddess with a feather on her head. The king was obliged to maintain maat on earth through just rule and the maintenance of the constant religious rituals in the tem

ples, which placated the gods. Individuals were supposed to follow maat in their daily lives to ensure passage to the next life and, according to religious belief, their heart would be weighed against the feather of maat to determine their worthiness to enter the afterlife, although Books of the Dead were used to avoid any possible problems if there was doubt about the worthiness of the individual. See also RELIGION.
MAATHORNEFERURE (fl. 1245 BC). Egyptian name of the Hittite princess, daughter of Hattusili III and Puduhepa, who married Ramesses II in his year 34, c. 1245 BC. The marriage is recorded on several monuments, and this queen is known from scarabs and other textual evidence. She appears to have been a resident for a time at the royal palace at Gurob. See also BINTANAT; HENTTAWY; HENUTMIRE; ISITNOFRET; MERITAMUN; NEBETTAWY; NEFERTARI.
MAATKARE (fl. 1030 BC). Daughter of the high priest of Amun Pinudjem I and Henttawy II. She was appointed God’s wife of Amun. Her body was recovered from the royal cache at Deir elBahri in 1881. Her virgin status was disputed, as a small body, believed to be her child, was found in her coffin, but x-ray analysis later revealed this to be her pet monkey. A later Maatkare, daughter of Pasebakhaenniut II of Dynasty 21, was the wife of Osorkon I of Dynasty 22.
MAHES. Greek Mihos. A lion god said to be the son of Bastet or Sakhmet. He was regarded as a god of war and protector of sacred environs. He was primarily worshipped in Lower Egypt at Leontopolis and had a chapel at Bubastis. His cult became more widespread during the Graeco-Roman Period. See also RELIGION.
MALKATA. Modern name for an area on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes known as Aten Tjehen. Here the remains of a palace of Amenhotep III have been found, as well as a pleasure lake at nearby Birket Habu. The site was discovered in 1888 and excavated by the American R. Tytus from 1901–1903, the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1910–1920, and an American expedition from Pennsylvania

from 1971–1974. It has been more recently examined by a Japanese expedition from Waseda University from 1972–1980 and 1985–1988.
MANETHO (fl. 270 BC). Egyptian priest and author during the reign of Ptolemy II. He came from Sebennytos and appears to have held the post of high priest at Heliopolis. He wrote Aegyptiaca, a history of Egypt penned in Greek based on temple records. The complete text is now lost, but part of it is known from garbled excerpts in the works of other authors. His king list and division of dynasties were instrumental in establishing Egyptian chronology but must be carefully evaluated. The names and reign lengths are often distorted and must be checked against contemporary sources. It is now known that this division of dynasties was based on earlier documents, like the Turin Royal Canon. Manetho was also involved in the establishment of the cult of Sarapis in Egypt. See also DYNASTY 1DYNASTY 30.
MANHATA. A wife of Thutmose III. She was buried with her cowives, Manuwai and Maruta, in a tomb in Wadi Gabbanat alQurud. Their names have also been transliterated as Menhet, Menwi, and Merti. The tomb was discovered almost intact by illicit diggers in 1916, and the bulk of the objects were sold to the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1918 onward. The names indicate that the ladies were of Caananite or Syrian extraction and were probably acquired as a result of the king’s levantine conquests.
MANICHEISM. A religious doctrine developed from gnosticism that was preached throughout the Mediterranean world by the Bablylonborn Mani and his disciples from the 3rd century AD. It is a dualistic religion of good and evil, light and dark in which good is identified with Jesus Christ and heaven and evil with Satan and earth. It was proscribed during the Roman Empire both before and after the triumph of orthodox Christianity. It was prevalent in Egypt, and Manichean texts have been discovered at Medinet Madi and the Dakhla Oasis.

MARIETTE, (FRANÇOIS) AUGUSTE FERDINAND (1821–1881). French excavator. He was born in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France, on 11 February 1821, and he first became a teacher. His interest in Egypt was aroused by papers of a relative who had visited the country, and he taught himself both the Egyptian and Coptic languages. In 1850, he was sent to Egypt to purchase Coptic manuscripts but used the money to discover and excavate the Serapeum at Saqqara. In 1858, he was appointed head of the newly founded Egyptian Antiquities Service (now the Supreme Council for Antiquities) and organized archaeological excavations at all major sites in Egypt, notably Abydos, Thebes, Dendera, Saqqara, Giza, and various sites in the Delta region. In 1863, he opened the first Cairo Egyptian Museum. Mariette tried to put an end to illicit excavation and restricted foreign excavators. The bulk of his discoveries went to the Cairo Egyptian Museum, which henceforth had first choice of excavated material in Egypt. He died in Cairo on 18 January 1881, and he was later reburied in front of the new Cairo Museum. See also CARTER, HOWARD; MONTET, (JEAN) PIERRE MARIE; NAVILLE, (HENRI) EDOUARD; PETRIE, WILLIAM MATTHEW FLINDERS; REISNER, GEORGE ANDREW; WINLOCK, HERBERT EUSTIS.
MARINA EL-ALAMEIN. Modern name for an ancient site on the Mediterranean coast near modern el-Alamein where Egyptian and Polish excavations since 1986 have uncovered a town from the Graeco-Roman Period with nearby tombs. The tombs consist of burial chambers off a central altar and a room for the funeral and subsequent feasts in honor of the dead. Mummy portraits have been recovered with some of the burials, indicating that this practice was also carried on in northern Egypt; this had not been hitherto attested due to the wetter climate here.
MARRIAGE. Although marriage undoubtedly existed in ancient Egypt, there is no evidence of any marriage ceremonies, and it may be that a couple merely declared their intention and lived together. It is probable that there was a family celebration of some sort, but no legal or religious notification was necessary. Marriage contracts from the Late Period have survived that specify the terms of relationships. Most Egyptian men appear to have had monogamous marriages with
MARRIAGE • 135



one wife at a time, and certainly this state of affairs was the ideal in wisdom literature. Because of the high mortality rate, it is likely that some men and women had additional partners, although evidence for remarriage is not always clearly indicated. Divorce was freely available but was limited by economic and social pressures. A divorced wife or widow was entitled to one-third of the matrimonial property unless guilty of adultery, in which case her financial claims were diminished. Polygamy, although permitted, is rarely attested, except for the king. Total fidelity on the part of men was not realistically expected, but most men appear to have preferred to consort with prostitutes, concubines, or slave girls rather than take a second wife, as this procedure was expensive and might lead to legal disputes. In one known case of a childless couple, the husband fathered children by a slave girl, and the offspring were then adopted by the wife. Aside from the royal family, ancient Egyptians did not marry their sisters. Early Egyptologists were confused by the fact that wives are often referred to as a sister as a term of endearment. The king as a god could marry his sister, although this was not obligatory, and only a few cases of full brother–sister marriage are recorded during the Pharaonic Period, possibly Mentuhotep II and his sister, Nefru; Seqenenre Tao and Ahhotep; and Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. Others married half sisters, or the identity of the mother of the queen is uncertain. The practice was revived by some of the Ptolemaic kings, beginning with Ptolemy II. Only during the Graeco-Roman Period are brother–sister marriages attested for commoners, and this development seems to have arisen as a means to control family property. See also SEX.

MASAHARTA (fl. 1044–1036 BC). High priest of Amun at Thebes during Dynasty 21. Son of Pinudjem I. He succeeded his father as high priest apparently when the latter adopted royal titles but may have predeceased him. He was eventually succeeded by his brother, Menkheperre. His body was recovered from the royal cache.

MASTABA. Arabic term used by Egyptologists to describe freestanding tombs from the late Predynastic Period onward. The superstructure of these tombs is rectangular in shape and composed of mudbrick or stone. Within the core of the superstructure are various storerooms or chapels, sometimes filled in to present a seemingly solid appearance. A shaft within the body of the tomb leads to the underground burial chamber. See also PYRAMID.

MEDAMUD. Modern name for a site in Upper Egypt just northeast of Luxor. Ancient Egyptian Madu. The main deity of the site was the god Montu, whose temple is attested during the Middle Kingdom, although the surviving remains date to the Graeco-Roman Period. A cult of a sacred bull similar to the Mnevis is known from here. The site was excavated by French archaeologists from 1929–1940.
MEDINET HABU. Modern name for the site of the mortuary temple of Ramesses III on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes. The temple is well preserved and contains a major inscription detailing the king’s war against the Sea Peoples. The workmen from Deir el-Medina sought refuge here at the end of Dynasty 20. The site also contains a temple of Thutmose III and the burial chapels of the God’s wives of Amun.
MEDINET MADI. Modern name of a town site in the Fayum. Ancient Egyptian Dja, named Narmuthis during the Graeco-Roman Period. The earliest remains date to the Middle Kingdom when a temple to the goddess Renenutet is attested. Later evidence dates from the 4th century AD to the early Arabic Period, when the main temple was dedicated to Isis-Termouthis. The late Roman fort Castrum Narmoutheos was identified in 2006. The site was excavated by a French expedition in 1900; a German expedition from 1909–1910; and an Italian expedition from 1934–1939 and since 1966, recovering much documentary evidence in the form of ostraca and papyri pertaining to the Manichean religious sect.

MEGIDDO. A city-state in Syria-Palestine that became a vassal of Egypt after the campaigns of Thutmose I. In 1458 BC, it became the center of a revolt against Egypt headed by the prince of Kadesh. The city was attacked and beseiged by Thutmose III in a surprise assault and forced to surrender. The captured princes were obliged to renew their allegiance to Egypt. The city and its ruler, Biridiya, appear in the Amarna letters. The city remained under Egyptian control until the middle of Dynasty 20, when the last attested Egyptain ruler there is Ramesses VI. See also WARFARE.
MEHIT. A lioness-headed goddess of the desert regions and wife of Anhur of the eighth Upper Egyptian nome.
MEHY (fl. 1290 BC). An Egyptian army officer depicted by the side of Sety I in his war reliefs at Karnak. His figure was later erased by Ramesses II. Early Egyptologists mistakenly assumed that the erased reliefs originally depicted an older son of Sety I suppressed by Ramesses II, but the correct name and titles of Mehy have now been deciphered. However, his exact position in the court and subsequent career remains unknown.
MEIDUM. Modern name for ancient Egyptian Mertem, where the earliest known true pyramid is located, although it was not originally designed as such. It was built as a step pyramid, but the steps were later filled in, although most of the filling has now collapsed. The pyramid has been attributed to Huni or his successor, Snefru. It is surrounded by the tombs of royal officials, including that of Prince Rahotep, which contained finely painted statues of him and his wife, Nefret, now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, and Prince Nefermaat, who served as vizier. The site was examined by Auguste Mariette from 1871–1872, Flinders Petrie from 1890–1891 and 1909–1911, Alan Rowe from 1929–1932, an Egyptian expedition and later a Polish–Egyptian expedition that conserved the tombs from 1985–1988, and a Spanish expedition since 1996.
MEIR. Modern name for a site in Middle Egypt south of Amarna, ancient Egyptian Qis, capital of the 14th nome of Upper Egypt whose patron goddess was Hathor. The most important features of the area

are the rock-cut tombs of the nomarchs from Dynasties 6–12. The reliefs were copied by an expedition sponsored by the Egypt Exploration Society from 1912–1914, in 1921, and from 1949–1950. Another nearby burial site was located at Quseir el-Amarna recorded by an Australian expedition in 1989.
MEKETATEN (fl. 1340 BC). Second daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. She appears on many monuments with her sisters during the early part of her father’s reign. The deathbed scene of this princess is vividly depicted in the royal tomb at Amarna. This scene might be interpreted to suggest that she died during childbirth, but this is not certain. See also ANKHESENAMUN; ANKHESENPAATENTASHERIT; BAKETATEN; MERITAMUN; MERITATENTASHERIT; NEFERNEFRUATEN; NEFERNEFRURE; SETEPENRE.
MEKETRE (fl. 2000 BC). Chancellor at the end of Dynasty 11 and possibly the beginning of Dynasty 12. He was buried at Deir elBahri, and his tomb was excavated by an expedition from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1921. Among the objects discovered were fine models of activities of daily life, which are a feature of tombs of the Middle Kingdom.
MEMNON, COLOSSI OF. The two colossal statues of Amenhotep III that stood before his mortuary temple on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes. The statues were named by the Greeks after the legendary Ethiopian king Memnon, who fought in the Trojan War. One was believed to sing, probably the action of wind through cracks, and became a favorite tourist attraction during the Roman Period, being visited notably by Hadrian and his wife. The statue was repaired by order of Septimius Severus, and it sang no more. The temple behind the statues was heavily plundered by Merenptah, who used many blocks and statues for the construction of his own mortuary temple.
MEMPHIS. Greek name for the capital of the first nome of Lower Egypt located at modern Mit Rahina. The city is said to have been founded by Menes. It then served as the capital of a united Egypt and was first called Inebu-hedj, meaning “White Wall.” It was later
MEMPHIS • 139



known by the name Men-nefer, derived from the pyramid of Pepy I, from which the Greek form of its name developed. Memphis remained the first or second capital of Egypt throughout most of dynastic history. Its principal monument was the temple to its local god, Ptah, which is now in ruins but was largely rebuilt by Ramesses II. The remains of smaller temples and palaces, mainly from the Ramesside Period, have also been uncovered. The site has not been systematically excavated and so is less well known than the southern capital at Thebes. Investigations were carried out by Jospeh Hekekyan in 1852. Excavations were carried out by Auguste Mariette; Flinders Petrie from 1909–1913; the University of Pennsylvania from 1915–1919, 1921–1923, and 1955–1956; Egyptian archaeologists notably in 1931 and 1942 when tombs of the Ramesside Period and Dynasty 22 were uncovered; and the Egypt Exploration Society since 1981. The kings and courtiers who resided here were buried at the nearby desert sites of Abusir, Dahshur, Giza, Meidum, and Saqqara.
MENAS, ST. Legendary Christian martyr and popular saint of Coptic Egypt. He was supposedly a Roman soldier of Egyptian parentage serving in Phrygia. As a committed Christian, he was martyred during the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian. His body was brought to Egypt by his military comrades and buried in the Delta at the site now known as Abu Mina.
MENDES. Greek name for the Egyptian Per-Banebdjet, now Tell elRuba, capital of the 16th nome of Lower Egypt. Capital of Dynasty 29. The principal deity of the site was the sacred ram Banebdjet. Remains include tombs from the Old Kingdom and later eras and the cemetery of the sacred rams. The site has been excavated by a number of American Egyptologists since 1964. The nearby site of Tell elTimai, Greek Thmuis, marked the area of residence during the Graeco-Roman Period.
MENES. Legendary first king of Egypt who founded Dynasty 1 and founder of the city of Memphis. There are no certain contemporary references to a king of this name, but he appears on Ramesside king lists 2,000 years later. He may be identified with Narmer, although some scholars have suggested that he may be Aha.

MENHET. See MANHATA.
MENKAUHOR (reigned c. 2421–2414 BC). Ruler of Dynasty 5. Successor of Niuserre. Very little is known about his reign, and although the name of his pyramid has been discovered, the actual structure has yet to be located at either Saqqara or Abusir. See also DJEDKARE.
MENKAURE (reigned c. 2532–2503 BC). The Greek form of his name is Mycerinus. Ruler of Dynasty 4. Son and successor of Khafre and probably Queen Khamerernebty I. He built the third pyramid complex at Giza next to that of his father and his grandfather, Khufu. His pyramid was opened in 1837, and his sarcophagus was shipped to London but was lost at sea. The associated temples and chapels were excavated by George Reisner for the Boston Museum of Fine Arts from 1906–1910 and in 1923 and yielded fine pieces of sculpture depicting the king with various goddesses.
MENKHEPERRE (fl. 1060–986 BC). High priest of Amun at Thebes during Dynasty 21. Son of Pinudjem I. He eventually succeeded his brother, Masaharta, at Thebes in year 25 of Nesbanebdjed (c. 1035 BC) after some political dissension resulting in the banishment of his rivals. Menkheperre held office for approximately 50 years, after which he was followed by his sons, Nesbanebdjed and Pinudjem II. See also THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
MENNA (fl. 1395 BC). Owner of the well-preserved tomb 69 in the necropolis of Thebes, probably dating to the reign of Thutmose IV. He held the title of scribe of the fields of the king. The scenes in his tomb include those of the harvest and fishing and fowling.
MENTUEMHAT (fl. 700–650 BC). Fourth prophet of Amun and mayor of Thebes. Son of Nesptah, who had similar titles, and Istemkheb. He was the virtual ruler of Thebes and Upper Egypt at the end of Dynasty 25 and is named in Assyrian accounts as prince of Thebes. Mentuemhat skilfully kept his position during and after the Assyrian conquest but submitted in 656 BC to Psamtik I, who recognized his position. He was succeeded by his son, Nesptah, but Psamtik I eventually managed to remove the family from power. His

large tomb is located on the western bank of the Nile and has not been fully excavated.
MENTUHERKHEPESHEF. The name of several princes of Dynasty 19 and Dynasty 20. The name was first used for the fifth son of Ramesses II (fl. 1270 BC). A like-named son of Ramesses IX was buried in tomb KV19 in the Valley of the Kings, first rediscovered in 1817.
MENTUHOTEP I (fl. 2125 BC). Ancestor of Dynasty 11. He apparently never actually ruled but was probably a governor of Thebes and was awarded a posthumous royal Horus name as the father of Intef I. See also FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
MENTUHOTEP II (reigned c. 2055–2004 BC). Throne name Nebhepetre. Son of Intef III and Iah, ruler of Thebes of Dynasty 11. He reestablished the unity of Egypt c. 2040 BC by defeating the ruler of Herakleopolis during Dynasty 10, thus ending the First Intermediate Period and inaugurating the Middle Kingdom. He established Thebes for the first time as capital of Egypt. Mentuhotep II appears to have undertaken campaigns in Nubia, in Sinai, and against the Libyans to safeguard and possibly expand Egypt’s borders. He built his tomb and mortuary temple at Deir el-Bahri. He married his sister, Nefru, and the lady Tem, mother of his successor, Mentuhotep III.
MENTUHOTEP III (reigned c. 2004–1992 BC). Throne name Sankhkare. Son and successor of Mentuhotep II and Tem. He also built a funerary complex at Deir el-Bahri, but it has not survived. This site was examined by George Schweinfurth in 1904 and Flinders Petrie in 1909 and excavated by a Hungarian expedition from 1995–1998.
MENTUHOTEP IV (reigned c. 1992–1985 BC). Throne name Nebtawyre. Successor and probable son of Mentuhotep III and Imi. He is not listed in any of the surviving king lists but is known from contemporary documents, including inscriptions of mining expeditions to the Wadi el-Hudi and the Wadi Hammamat. The latter records a visit by his vizier, Amenemhat, who is generally believed

to be the future Amenemhat I who may well have overthrown his master.
MENTUHOTEP V–VII. Ephemeral kings of Dynasty 13 and Dynasty 17. Meryankhre Mentuhotep V is known from two statues, Sewadjre Mentuhotep VI from a fragmentary inscription, and Sankhenre Mentuhotep VII from some inscriptions and the Turin Royal Canon. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
MENWI. See MANHATA.
MERENPTAH (reigned c. 1212–1202 BC). Throne name Baenre. Thirteenth son of Ramesses II by Isitnofret. He apparently survived all his older brothers or those eligible for the throne and became virtual coregent of his father toward the end of his father’s reign. After his succession, he faced invasions from the Libyans and Sea Peoples that were successfully repulsed. Diplomatic correspondence with the king of Ugarit was discovered in 1994. He was buried in tomb KV8 in the Valley of the Kings, and his mummy was found in the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II. The remains of his mortuary temple on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes were excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1896 and a Swiss expedition since 1971. His temple was built with material removed from the nearby mortuary temple of Amenhotep III. See also AMENHERKHEPESHEF; KHAEMWESE; MERYATUM; PREHERWENEMEF; SETY.

MERERUKA (fl. 2340 BC). Vizier of Teti of Dynasty 6 and successor of Kagemni. Son of the lady Nedjetempet. He married a royal princess, Watetkhekher, alias Sesheseshet. His tomb is located near the pyramid of Teti at Saqqara, and it is one of the largest in the cemetery. There are many fine reliefs of daily life and a massive statue of the deceased in the main hall. The tomb was discovered in 1893 but was only fully copied by an expedition from the University of Chicago from 1930–1936. Mereruka’s mother’s tomb has recently been discovered next to his.

MERESANKH. The name of several princesses and queens of Dynasty 4. Meresankh I was the mother of Snefru. Meresankh II was the daughter of Khufu, and Meresankh III was the daughter of Khufu’s son, Kawab; both were wives of Khafre and were buried at Giza.
MERETSEGER. Snake goddess of Thebes. She was worshipped primarily by the royal workmen at Deir el-Medina, no doubt to avoid the dangers of snakebites. She was sometimes represented as a woman with a snake’s head. Meretseger was identified with el-Qorn, the highest mountain peak on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes. See also RELIGION.
MERIMDA BENI SALAMA. Modern name of an archaeological site in the Delta northwest of Cairo where a prehistoric town settlement was located. The later phases include mudbrick houses apparently built in a town plan. The culture is contemporary with that of elBadari and Naqada I but exhibits differences that were originally thought to indicate separate cultural development for Lower Egypt. The site was excavated by a German expedition from 1928–1939 and 1977–1983. Recent discoveries at Minshat Abu Omar indicate that Naqada culture was also present in the north.
MERITAMUN (fl. 1540–1500 BC). Egyptian princess and queen. Sister and wife of Amenhotep I of Dynasty 18 and thus likely daughter of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. She appears to have had no issue. She was buried in tomb number 358 at Deir el-Bahri, which was discovered in the 1920s. A body identified as hers in the royal cache is thought to be a misattribution. See also AHMOSE-SIPAIR; SITAMUN.
MERITAMUN (fl. 1450 BC). Egyptian princess of Dynasty 18. Likely daughter of Thutmose III. She is attested in the chapel at Deir el-Bahri and several other monuments and is not to be confused with Meritamun of 1540–1500 BC.

MERNEITH • 145



MEROE. Capital of the Kushite kingdom in Nubia from the Late Period until the Roman Period. Following the expulsion of Dynasty 25 from Egypt, their successors reigned first at Napata and then further south at Meroe. The rulers were buried in pyramids near the city. Hostilities with the Egyptian authorities occasionally occurred, the most notable being during the reign of Augustus. Little is known about the internal workings of the kingdom, as Meroitic script has yet to be deciphered. The city-site has been excavated by the British John Garstang from 1909–1914, a Canadian expedition from 1965–1977 and 1983–1984, a joint German–Sudanese expedition in 1992, and a joint Canadian–Sudanese expedition since 1999. The pyramid site has been explored by George Reisner from 1920–1923 and more recently by a German expedition.
MERSA GAWASIS. Modern name for the site of an ancient Egyptian port on the Red Sea north of Quseir al-Khadim (Myos Hormos). Ancient Saww. It lies at the entrance to the Wadi Gawasis and is accessed via the Eastern Desert to the Nile Valley. The port flourished from the end of the Old Kingdom to the early New Kingdom, but the period of its greatest activity appears to be during the Middle Kingdom. It was used by expeditions to Punt. Inscriptions have been recovered naming Senusret I; Senusret’s vizier, Intefyoker; and Amenemhat III. The site was discovered and examined by an Egyptian team from 1976–1977 and has been under excavation by a joint American–Italian expedition since 2001.

METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART. One of the major collections of Egyptian antiquities located in New York City. The Egyptian galleries were first opened in 1911. The collection was assembled from such purchases as the antiquities of the Earl of Carnarvon; donations from the Egypt Exploration Fund; and most importantly archaeological work in Egypt carried out by director Herbert Winlock, mainly at Deir el-Bahri, Thebes, and Lisht. Major pieces include the statue of Sahure of Dynasty 5, the jewelry of Princess Sithathoriunet, a wooden statue of Senusret I, and the jewelry of the minor wives of Thutmose III. Following the Nubian Rescue Campaign, the museum was presented with the temple of Dandur by the Egyptian government.

MONTET, (JEAN) PIERRE MARIE (1885–1966). French Egyptologist. He was born at Villefranche-sur-Saone, France, on 27 June 1885, and studied at the University of Lyons and the French Institute in Cairo. He excavated at Byblos in Lebanon from 1921–1924; in Egypt at Abu Roash in 1937; and at the important site of Tanis from 1929–1940, 1945–1951, and 1954–1956. His most important finds were the royal tombs of Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22 at Tanis from 1939–1940. Montet later became professor at the University of Strasbourg. He died in Paris on 18 June 1966.

MUDBRICK. The basic material used for construction in ancient Egypt. Nile clay mixed with sand and straw was poured into molds and dried to form bricks used in the building of most domestic buildings and palaces. Straw was used in the bricks found at Amarna. Mudbricks were also used in the lower courses of temple construction. They were placed on a bed of clean sand and topped by the stone structure. As mudbrick buildings decay over time, only the bottom courses are generally preserved. The Egyptian word for brick was tob, which then passed into Arabic and Spanish to produce the modern word adobe.
MUMMY. Modern word derived from the Arabic mumiya to describe the embalmed bodies of the ancient Egyptians. The earliest preserved bodies from the late Predynastic Period, c. 3200 BC, are not mum

mies strictly speaking since they have been preserved by natural means in the dry Egyptian sand without any human intervention. Possibly inspired by these examples, the Egyptians came to believe that it was necessary to maintain the body of the deceased as home for the soul. Mummification efforts were undertaken beginning in the Old Kingdom. The first results were not very successful. The bodies were wrapped in linen, presumably after the removal of the internal organs, and then covered with mud to model human features. Only a few of these mummies have been discovered intact, notably one in the tomb of Nefer during Dynasty 5.
By the New Kingdom, the method of embalming had been perfected, and it reached its most advanced state during Dynasty 21. The internal organs were removed and placed in canopic jars or returned to the body in packages, apart from the heart, which was left in the body. The brain was extracted via the nose and discarded. The body was then dried out with dry natron, a natural salt; packed and anointed with resins and aromatics; and then wrapped in bandages, beneath and between which various amulets were often placed. The method of mummification declined in succeeding periods, although the outer covering of bandages became more elaborate and during the Roman Period included painted mummy portraits. Mummification was abandoned during the Coptic Period as a pagan rite. During the medieval period, bodies were ground to a powder, known in Arabic as mumiya, which was considered beneficial for health. This practice led to a minor industry of excavating and disposing of mummies, which incidentally also resulted in some early archaeological discoveries. The present term mummy derives from the Arabic name of the powder. See also AFTERLIFE.
MUMMY PORTRAITS. Painted wooden panels with a head and shoulders portrait of the deceased attached to the head of the mummy popular during the Roman Period. The portrait was painted in tempera or wax encaustic. Painting in wax is mentioned by ancient authors, but the mummy portraits from Hawara are the only surviving examples of this technique, which has not been successfully replicated in modern times. The portraits are often called Fayum portraits, as the majority of them have been found in the Fayum, but examples have also been excavated throughout the country from

MUSIC. No textual information has survived on ancient Egyptian music, but original instruments have been recovered, and musical instruments are depicted on tomb reliefs. Music was used as a background for songs and hymns and for dancing in a religious context or at private banquet functions. The musical instruments of the period included the flute, depicted in the Old Kingdom; the double clarinet of the Old Kingdom, which was replaced in the New Kingdom by the double oboe; harps of various types; lyres and lutes introduced from the Levant in the New Kingdom; drums; and tambourines. Hand clapping and clappers were also used for rhythm. The trumpet was used in militray contexts and the sistrum in religious ceremonies.
MUT. Egyptian goddess. Consort of Amun. She is usually depicted as a female figure with a vulture headdress surmounted by the double crown of Egypt, but she is also portrayed with the head of a lioness. Her sacred animal was a lion, and her principal place of worship was her temple at Karnak linked to the main temple of Amun. The temple was adorned by many statues of the goddess Sakhmet, who was thus linked to Mut. See also RELIGION.
MUTEMWIA (fl. 1350 BC). Queen-mother of Amenhotep III and wife of Thutmose IV. She is not attested until the reign of her son and must have been a minor wife of his father. There is no evidence identifying her with the Mitannian princess who was also wife to Thutmose IV. In the temple of Luxor, she is depicted in the embrace of the god Amun, who according to tradition was the father of each Egyptian ruler.
MUTNEFRET (fl. 1500 BC). Wife of Thutmose I and mother of Thutmose II. Her origin is unknown, but she is generally described by Egyptologists as a minor or secondary wife. There is no evidence for this assertion, as she may have been the wife of Thutmose I before his accession to the throne, at which time he may have wed his

MUTNODJMET (fl. 1310 BC). Queen of Horemheb. She appears in the reign of Akhenaten, apparently as the sister of his queen, Nefertiti, but her parentage is unknown. It is not clear when she married Horemheb, who appears to have had an earlier wife. She apparently died childless before her husband and is possibly buried in his tomb at Saqqara.
MUTNODJMET (fl. 1039–991 BC). Queen of Pasebakhaenniut I. She is mentioned in texts in his tomb at Tanis. She bears the titles of king’s daughter and king’s sister, so she may the daughter of Pinudjem I, who had a daughter of this name.
MUWATTALLI II (c. 1310–1272 BC). King of the Hittites. Son of Mursili II and Gassuliyawiya. He faced a renewed attempt by Egypt to regain its lost territories in Syria resulting in the battle of Kadesh with Ramesses II. The Hittite victory there assured that these areas remained in Hittite possession. He also led campaigns against his northern and western neighbors. See also URHI-TESHUB; WARFARE.

MYOS HORMOS. Modern Quseir al-Khadim. A seaport on the Red Sea built during the Ptolemaic Period but that was more prominent during the Roman Period until the 3rd century AD. It was the major port for trade with Arabia and India and was connected to Coptos via the Wadi Hammamat. Hadrian later built a road to connect it with Antinoopolis. The historian Stabo visited the port with the prefect Aelius Gallus. The town was excavated by an American expedition in 1978, 1980, and 1982 and a British team from 1999–2003, when it was securely identified. The remains of an ancient Egyptian port on the Red Sea have been identified nearby at Mersa Gawasis.

A possible tomb from the Old Kingdom and two tombs from the Ramesside Period are located in the nearby cliffs. There are remains of a New Kingdom temple dedicated to the goddess Mehit.
NAGA EL-DEIR. Modern name for a site in northern Upper Egypt on the east bank of the Nile south of Sohag. It likely served as a cemetery for the city of Thinis, capital of the eighth Upper Egyptian nome. The remains date from the Predynastic Period to the Middle Kingdom. The site was excavated by George Reisner from 1901–1904, in 1912, and from 1923–1924, and the examination yielded much inscribed material in the form of stelae and the Reisner Papyri.

NAKHT (fl. 1395 BC). Owner of tomb 52 in the necropolis of Thebes, probably dating to the reign of Thutmose IV. He held the title of astronomer. The tomb is decorated with scenes of a blind harper and agricultural activities.
NAKHTHORHEB (reigned 360–343 BC). The Greek form of his name is Nectanebos, usually rendered as Nectanebo II. Throne name Senedjemibre setepenanhur. Epithet meryhathor. Last ruler of Dynasty 30. Son of Tjaihepimu, who was the brother of King Djedhor. Nakhthorheb accompanied his uncle, Djedhor, on a campaign in Syria and there rebelled with the assistance of his father, who had been left as regent in Egypt. Nakhthorheb was joined by the Greek mercenaries in the army, and his uncle fled to Persia. He continued the policies of his grandfather, Nakhtnebef, in supporting Egyptian temples.
Nakhthorheb faced continued attempts by Persia to reconquer Egypt, and his armies were eventually defeated in 343 BC, and he was forced to flee to the south, disappearing from history. The sarcophagus, which he prepared for his burial, was reused and is now housed in the British Museum. Later legend views him as a wise magician who escaped to Macedon and through an affair with Queen Olympias fathered Alexander the Great, who drove the Persians from Egypt. The legend is chronologically impossible but reflects the Egyptian tendency to try to give an Egyptian background to their foreign conquerors. See also WARFARE.
NAKHTMIN (fl. 1327 BC). An Egyptian army officer under Tutankhamun. He dedicated some shabtis to the king’s tomb and so must have been of some importance. It has been speculated that he was related to Ay and rival to Horemheb for the throne. His ultimate fate is unknown.
NAKHTNEBEF (reigned 380–362 BC). The Greek form of his name is Nectanebes, usually rendered as Nectanebo I. Throne name Kheperkare. Founder of Dynasty 30. Son of Djedhor, a military officer from Sebennytos. He overthrew Nefaarud II of Dynasty 29. He managed to defeat a Persian invasion of Egypt in 373 BC and

embarked on a major program of refurbishing Egypt’s temples. See also DJEDHOR; NAKHTHORHEB; WARFARE.
NAME. Ancient Egyptian rn. Much importance was attached in ancient Egypt to preserving the name of an individual throughout eternity as this imparted immortality to the deceased. Statues and stelae were erected especially in tombs and temples for this purpose. One of the standard prayers of an ancient Egyptian was that someone “cause his name to live.”
NAOS. Greek name for the sacred shrine of a temple. The naos usually consisted of a hollowed-out stone or wooden container fitted with wooden doors into which the image of the deity was placed. Such monuments are depicted on statues and survive from some temples. Model naoi are also known to exist in bronze and wood.
NAPATA. First capital of the later kingdom of Kush in Nubia. The site is 30 kilometers south of the Second Cataract and appears to have been initially occupied during the New Kingdom. Following the Egyptian withdrawal, a Nubian kingdom centered on Napata developed and under Kashta and Piye, and finally Shabaqo conquered Egypt as Dynasty 25 or the Napatan Dynasty. The area includes the royal cemeteries at el-Kurru and Nuri and the holy mountain of Gebel Barkal with its temple to Amun. The capital of the kingdom was eventually transferred to the site of Meroe.
NAQADA. Modern name for ancient Nubt, Greek Ombos. A site in Upper Egypt north of Thebes where important remains from the late Predynastic Period were excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1895. The name is now used to denote the final phase of predynastic culture, divided into the periods Naqada I (c. 3900–3600 BC); Naqada II (c. 3600–3200 BC), which is best attested by its painted designs on pottery; and Naqada III (c. 3200–3100 BC), when the elements of kingship (Dynasty 0) and writing are first discernible.

156 • NAME



NARMER (reigned c. 3100 BC). First king of Dynasty 1, as named in the royal seal of the dynasty. He may be identified with the legendary King Menes. He is known from a palette and macehead found at Hierakonpolis, which record his military victories. He was buried at Abydos, where his tomb has recently been reexcavated by a German expedition. See also AHA.
NAUKRATIS. Greek name for a site in the fifth nome of Lower Egypt that became a settlement for Greek merchants during Dynasty 26, probably founded by Psamtik I rather than Ahmose II, as stated in Herodotus, and that flourished into the Roman Period. It was excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1885; other British archaeologists in 1886, 1899, and 1903; and an American expedition from 1977–1978 and 1980–1983.
NAVILLE, (HENRI) EDOUARD (1844–1926). Swiss Egyptologist and archaeologist. He was born in Geneva, Switzerland, on 14 June 1844. He studied Egyptology at several universities and visited Egypt in 1865 for the first time. He first worked on texts but was chosen as a field archaeologist by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1882. He excavated at many sites in the Lower Egypt, notably Tell elMaskhuta, Bubastis, and also at Herakleopolis and Abydos. He also cleared the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri near Thebes. He clashed with Flinders Petrie over archaeological methods, as he was mainly interested in inscribed material and monumental architecture and often ignored small finds. He died in Malagny near Geneva on 17 October 1926. See also CARTER, HOWARD; MARIETTE, (FRANÇOIS) AUGUSTE FERDINAND; MONTET, (JEAN) PIERRE MARIE; REISNER, GEORGE ANDREW; WINLOCK, HERBERT EUSTIS.
NEBETTAWY (fl. 1270–1240 BC). Princess of Dynasty 19. She was the fifth daughter of Ramesses II. She was given the title of queen, but it is not known if this means that she actually married her father. She was buried in QV60 in the Valley of the Queens.

He overthrew Amyrtaeos, but little is known of his reign. Nefaarud II, who reigned in 380 BC, was in turn ousted by Nakhtnebef (Nectanebo I), founder of Dynasty 30.
NEFER (fl. 2400 BC). The owner of a tomb built at Saqqara south of the causeway of the pyramid of Unas that was discovered by Egyptian archaeologists in 1966. Son of the overseer of singers Kahay and Meretites, who were also buried here. Nefer inherited his father’s rank and built the tomb for the family during Dynasty 5. The tomb contains fine painted reliefs and is remarkable for the survival of a male mummy in a fine state of preservation.

nasty 13 are unclear. He was one of the more important rulers of the period, and he recorded his family origins on graffiti near Elephantine. He was acknowledged as sovereign by Yantin, ruler of Byblos. He was succeeded by his brothers, Sihathor and Sobekhotep IV. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
NEFERIRKARE (reigned c. 2475–2455 BC). Personal name Kakai. Third ruler of Dynasty 5. According to the later Westcar Papyrus, he was a brother of his predecessors, Userkaf and Sahure, but this is doubtful. It has recently been suggested that he was the son of Sahure. He built his pyramid complex at Abusir, which was excavated by the German Ludwig Borchardt in 1900 and from 1903–1907. He is the first ruler to use two cartouches with his prenomen and nomen in the royal titulary. See also RANEFEREF.
NEFERMAAT (fl. 2620–2580). Egyptian prince during the Old Kingdom. He was either a son of Huni of Dynasty 3 or Snefru of Dynasty 4. He served as vizier, probably under Snefru or Khufu. He and his wife, Atet, were buried in a mastaba tomb at Meidum. Many of the wall paintings from the tomb have been preserved, including a famous scene of geese from the chapel of Atet now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. He was possibly succeeded in office by his probable son, Hemiunu. See also AMENEMHAT I; APEREL; AY; IMHOTEP; INTEFYOKER; KAGEMNI; MERERUKA; PASER; PTAHHOTEP; PTAHSHEPSES; RAMESSES I; REKHMIRE.

NEFERTI. The fictional author of a literary text set during the reign of Snefru in which he prophesies civil war and confusion in Egypt, which will be ended by the succession of Amenemhat I of Dynasty 12. The text was doubtlessly written during the reign of the latter as a justification of his accession to the throne.

NEFERTITI (fl. 1370–1336 BC). Chief wife of Akhenaten of unknown origin. She is represented as an equal of her husband on reliefs and in a style not previously used for queens. She is best known for the famous bust found at Amarna now housed in the Berlin Egyptian Museum. She was apparently the mother of six daughters, including Meritaten (later Meritamun), Meketaten, Ankhesenpaaten (later Ankhesenamun, wife of Tutankhamun), Nefernefruaten, Nefernefrure, and Setepenre. Her ultimate fate is unknown, but it has been suggested that she briefly acted as ruler or regent upon her husband’s death. See also AY; SMENKHKARE; TIY.

NEFRU. The name of several queens of Dynasty 11 and Dynasty 12. The mothers of Intef II and Intef III of Dynasty 11 were both named Nefru, as was the daughter of Intef III and Iah, who married her brother, Mentuhotep II. The tomb of the last was discovered at her husband’s funerary complex at Deir el-Bahri. During Dynasty 12, Nefru, daughter of Amenemhat I, married her brother, Senusret I, and was the mother of his successor, Amenemhat II. She is mentioned at the royal court in the story of Sinuhe.
NEFRUBITY (fl. 1480 BC). Daughter of King Thutmose I and Queen Ahmose and sister of Queen Hatshepsut. She is named in the temple reliefs at Deir el-Bahri but is otherwise unknown.
NEFRUPTAH (fl. 1810 BC). The name of at least two royal princesses of Dynasty 12. The more notable was the daughter of Amenemhat III, whose intact tomb was discovered in 1955 at Hawara near the pyramid of her father. Her body had been dissolved by water seepage, but jewelry and funerary material were recovered. A sarcophagus inscribed for her was also found in her father’s burial chamber, but it was either not used or used only temporarily. Her importance is witnessed by the fact that her name is written in a cartouche.
NEFRURE (fl. 1480–1459 BC). Only daughter of Thutmose II and Queen Hatshepsut. She was given a prominent role at court by her mother and was placed in the care of Senenmut. She was possibly destined to marry her half brother, Thutmose III. It is not certain if she survived her mother or if this marriage took place, but she undoubtedly died fairly young and without issue. See also MERYETRE HATSHEPSUT; NEBTU; SITIAH.
NEHESY (reigned c. 1700 BC). Throne name Aasehre. Ruler of Dynasty 14 during the Second Intermediate Period. He is known from several monuments discovered in the eastern Delta region, notably from Tanis, Bubastis, Leontopolis, Avaris, and Tell Hebua. His capital was probably at Xois or Avaris, and his rule undoubtedly extended over part of the Delta region.
NEITH. Primeval Egyptian goddess worshipped primarily at Sais. She is represented as a woman with the red crown of Lower Egypt. Her

NEITH (fl. 2275 BC). Egyptian princess and queen. Daughter of Pepy I. She married her brother, Pepy II, and was buried in a subsidiary pyramid next to his at Saqqara.
NEITHHOTEP (fl. 3080 BC). A queen of Dynasty 1. Her position remains uncertain, as she appears to be connected with kings Aha and Djer. It may even be possible that there were two ladies of this name.
NEKAU I (d. 664 BC). The Greek form of his name is Necho. Throne name Menkheperre. Originally prince of Sais, he was installed as puppet ruler of Egypt by the Assyrians and was killed by Tantamani during his reconquest of Egypt. He was the ancestor of Dynasty 26. See also PSAMTIK I.
NEKAU II (reigned 610–595 BC). Throne name Wehemibre. Son of Psamtik I. He attempted to stop the growth of Babylonian power by supporting the remnants of the defeated Assyrian army. Nekau defeated the army of King Josiah of Israel, killing the king when the Israelites attempted to block his forces, but he himself was defeated by the Babylonians at the battle of Carchemish in 609 BC. He was forced to retreat but prevented a Babylonian invasion of Egypt. He attempted to build a canal between the Nile and Red Sea, which was later finished by Darius I. See also PSAMTIK II; WARFARE.
NEKHBET. Egyptian goddess of Nekheb, modern Elkab, represented as a vulture. She was the tutelary deity of Upper Egypt and as such appears in the nebty or two ladies name of the royal titulary and on the royal crown with the uraeus of Wadjet. See also RELIGION.
NEMTYEMSAF. The name of two kings of Dynasty 6 who both had brief reigns. The name was wrongly read Antyemsaf by earlier Egyptologists. Nemtyemsaf I (reigned c. 2287–2278 BC), throne name Merenre, was the elder son of Pepy I. He died young and was buried at Saqqara. His pyramid was opened in 1880, and its complex was excavated by a French team from 1971–1973 and in 1980.
162 • NEITH



Nemtyemsaf II (reigned c. 2184–2183 BC) was the son of Pepy II and nephew of his namesake. If a later story reported by Herodotus is correct, he was assassinated after a brief reign and succeeded by his sister-queen, Nitocris.
NEPHERITES. See NEFAARUD.
NEPHTHYS. Egyptian goddess. Daughter of Geb and Nut and sister of Isis, Osiris, and Seth, whom she married. She was the chief mourner for Osiris, along with Isis. Nephthys was one of the tutelary goddesses protecting coffins and canopic jars. See also RELIGION.
NESBANEBDJED (reigned c. 1069–1043 BC). The Greek form of his name is Smendes. Throne name Hedjkheperre. Founder of Dynasty 21. Mayor of Tanis at the end of Dynasty 20, he succeeded to the throne after Ramesses XI in obscure circumstances. His control of southern Egypt appears to have been minimal. He and his wife, Tentamun, are mentioned in the story of Wenamun.
NESKHONS. The wife of Pinudjem II, high priest of Amun at Thebes. Possibly a daughter of the high priest Nesbanebdjed and so niece of her husband. She was buried in the royal cache at Thebes. She bore the title of viceroy of Kush, which must have been purely nominal and was used for the last time by her. See also DYNASTY 21.
NEW KINGDOM (c. 1550–1069 BC). The term used by Egyptologists to describe the period from Dynasty 18 to Dynasty 20 when Egypt was at the height of its power and prosperity and ruled an empire covering Nubia and Palestine-Syria. The era began with the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt and the reunion of the country under Ahmose I and ended with the Second Intermediate Period. There followed the expansion into Nubia and the Levant, culminating in the campaigns of Thutmose III. The increased wealth generated by these conquests led to major building campaigns, notably at Karnak and later under Ramesses II at Pi-Ramesses, Abu Simbel, and other sites. The god of Thebes, Amun, was elevated to the head of the divine pantheon. Increasing political and economic instability and aggressive external threats led to the gradual abandonment of the

empire by the end of Dynasty 20 and the division of the country, heralding the Third Intermediate Period. See also MIDDLE KINGDOM; OLD KINGDOM; WARFARE.
NILE. Modern word derived from Greek for the main waterway of ancient Egypt known simply then as the itrw (river), since there was no other river. It was the main artery for irrigation and transportation in Egypt. The Nile flooded annually from July to September fed by the rains in Ethiopia, and it brought fertile topsoil down to Egyptian farmlands and washed out harmful salts. As a result, Egypt was guaranteed hefty crop harvests unless the Nile was exceptionally low or high and thus presented the most stable area for settlement in the Middle East. The Nile also served as the main means of communication throughout the Nile Valley up to Elephantine (Aswan), where a series of cataracts or rapids impeded river traffic and so marked the historical border of Egypt. See also AGRICULTURE; CHRONOLOGY.
NIMLOT. The name of several princes of Dynasty 22. The earliest was the brother of King Osorkon the Elder and father of Sheshonq I. Both Sheshonq I and Osorkon II had sons named Nimlot who were placed in control of the town of Hierakonpolis. During the invasion of Piye, King Nimlot of Hermopolis was one of his chief opponents. See also KAROMAMA.
NITOCRIS (reigned c. 2183–81 BC). The Greek form of the name of a legendary queen. She is alleged by Herodotus to have succeeded her assassinated brother and husband and to have executed his murderers before committing suicide. If the legend is correct, she might have been the wife of Nemtyemsaf II. The Egyptian name Neithikert, from whom the Greek Nitocris may be derived, appears as the last ruler of Dynasty 6 in the Turin Royal Canon, but nothing historical is known of the ruler, who may well have been a man. See also FIRST INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
NITOCRIS (fl. 665–586 BC). Daughter of Psamtik I and Mehitenweskhet, daughter of the priest Harsiese. She was appointed in 656 BC as eventual heiress to the title of God’s wife of Amun and was

thereby ensured the recognition of her father as pharaoh by the authorities in Thebes headed by Mentuemhat. She later adopted her great-niece, Ankhnesneferibre, in 595 BC, and she died on 16 December 586 BC. A second Nitocris, daughter of Ahmose II, was destined to be the successor of Ankhnesneferibre, but her fate is unknown after the Persian conquest of Egypt.
NIUSERRE (reigned c. 2445–2421 BC). Personal name Ini. Ruler of Dynasty 5. Son of Neferirkare and probably Khentkaues II. He was the eventual successor of the short-lived Raneferef, possibly after some confusion. He built a sun temple at Abu Ghurab near Abusir, which was excavated by a German expedition at the end of the 19th century, and a pyramid and mortuary complex at Abusir excavated by Ludwig Borchardt from 1902–1904, from which many fine reliefs were recovered. The Palermo Stone indicates that he sent expeditions to Sinai and Punt. See also MENKAUHOR.
NODJMET (fl. c. 1075 BC). Wife of the high priest of Amun and titular king Herihor. A surviving letter indicates that she served in an administrative capacity in Thebes while the high priest Piankh was absent in Nubia. It has been suggested that she might have married Piankh as well, but his wife may have been Hrere.
NOMARCH. See NOME.
NOME. Greek name for the 42 provincial divisions of Egypt known as sepat to the Egyptians. There were traditionally 22 Upper Egyptian nomes and 20 Lower Egyptian nomes, each with its own standard and symbols. The governors of the nomes, known as nomarchs in Greek, tended to increase their power at times of weakness of the central government, notably during the First Intermediate Period, but their powers were curbed during Dynasty 12, and the offices may well have been suppressed under Senusret III.
NUBIA. Modern name for the area of the Nile Valley and its adjacent region south of Elephantine. It became important to Egypt as a source of minerals and served as an intermediary between Egypt and sub-Saharan Africa for luxury trade goods. Egyptian expeditions

penetrated the area beginning in the late Predynastic Period during raiding forays, and in the Old Kingdom, copper was mined and smelted at Buhen, although it is unclear whether the Egyptian presence was permanent. During the Middle Kingdom, a determined attempt was made to subjugate the area, and extensive fortresses were built along the Nile with the new border fixed at Semna. The collapse of the Second Intermediate Period led to an Egyptian withdrawal and the growth of a native kingdom based in Kerma in the area now known in Egyptian sources as Kush. The Hyksos sought an alliance with Kush against the rulers of Thebes, but both were destroyed by Dynasty 18, which renewed the Egyptian conquest of the south, conquering Nubia down to Napata by the reign of Thutmose III and putting the new province under the rule of the viceroy of Kush. Some native chieftains were allowed to remain under strict control, but their families were sent to the Egyptian court to be Egyptianized. Nubia was exploited principally for its gold reserves, which greatly enhanced Egyptian prestige and power. Numerous temples were built, and Egyptian religion, especially worship of the god Amun, took a strong hold on the population. Egyptian administration collapsed into civil war and confusion at the end of Dynasty 20. A new native kingdom was formed based at Napata and eventually under Piye, and Shabaqo conquered Egypt itself to found Dynasty 25. The Nubians were driven out of Egypt by Assyria, but the dynasty persisted in Nubia and later moved its capital to Meroe. Tension remained between the Meroitic kingdom and the Ptolemaic and Roman rulers of Egypt over control of the area just south of Elephantine, and Nubian rulers were assiduous in their worship at the temple of Philae, even after Egypt was Christianized. The Meroitic kingdom fell apart during the 4th century AD, partly under pressure from such invading desert tribes as the Nobatae, which gave the area its modern name. Three local kingdoms developed and adopted Christianity in the 6th century but were eventually overwhelmed by Muslim forces and disappeared during the 15th century. The successive constructions of dams at Aswan and the subsequent flooding have led to major archaeological campaigns in Lower

Nubia from 1898–1902, 1907–1912, 1929–1934, and 1960–1965 so that, although the region is now flooded, its archaeological record is better attested than many areas of Egypt proper. See also A-GROUP; C-GROUP; NUBIAN RESCUE CAMPAIGN.
NUBIAN RESCUE CAMPAIGN. The construction of the new Aswan High Dam, which commenced in 1960, resulted in the creation of Lake Nasser, a massive lake flooding much of Lower Nubia from the First Cataract at Aswan to almost the Third Cataract. Under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization, following an appeal by the Egyptian and Sudanese governments in 1959, an intensive archaeological campaign was organized by the international community from 1960–1965, involving 27 nations. Nineteen temples or monuments were removed from threatened sites, notably the temples at Abu Simbel, Dendur, and Philae, and also parts of the temples of Gerf Hussein and Semna.
NUN. God of the primeval waters of chaos from which emerged a mound on which the god Atum appeared. See also RELIGION.
NUT. Egyptian goddess of the sky and wife of Geb, the god of earth. Mother of Osiris, Isis, Seth, and Nephthys. She is represented as a naked woman often in an arched position over her husband and is depicted on the inside of coffins as a protector of the dead. See also RELIGION.

–O
OBELISK. Modern word for an Egyptian monolithic stone monument consisting of a thin shaft with a top is shaped as a pyramidion. Ancient Egyptian tekhen. Small obelisks are known, but most are tall and were located in temples. The development of the monument was linked to the introduction of the cult of the sun god Re, whose rising rays would strike the top of the obelisk, often sheeted in gold. The first obelisks seem to have been constructed at Heliopolis and the sun temples of Dynasty 5, but their use in temples in the New Kingdom and later periods was widespread. Two obelisks were placed in front of the main pylon of the major temples. Scenes from the temple of Hatshepsut at Deir el-Bahri depict the transport of an obelisk from the quarries at Aswan to Thebes, while a broken monument remains in the quarry. Many obelisks were carried off by Roman conquerors to decorate Rome, while others were removed in modern times to major European and North American cities.
OLD KINGDOM (c. 2686–2181 BC). A term used by Egyptologists to refer to the stable period beginning in either Dynasty 3 or Dynasty 4 to the end of Dynasty 6, which followed the Early Dynastic Period. It appeared that Egypt at the time had a highly organized autocratic government that could mobilize its resources and manpower in massive construction efforts, like the building of the pyramids. The period ended with the collapse of central authority possibly due to famine or increasingly powerful regional governors or nomarchs ushering in the First Intermediate Period. See also MIDDLE KINGDOM; NEW KINGDOM.
ONURIS. See ANHUR.
OSIRIS. The Greek form for the Egyptian god of the dead Wsir, lord of the underworld. Son of Geb and Nut and husband of Isis. According to legend, he was originally a king of Egypt but was murdered and dismembered by his brother, Seth. His widow, Isis, recovered and buried his remains. He was also a god of vegetation and renewal. The dead king, and later any deceased individual, was identified with Osiris, but the individual also had to be judged by Osiris

before entering the next life. Osiris is depicted as a mummiform figure with a feathered crown holding a crook and flail. He was early amalgamated with the god Khentyamnetyu of Abydos, which became the principal place of his worship and where his tomb was said to be located. See also RELIGION.
OSORKON (fl. 850–785 BC). The name of a high priest of Amun, son of Takelot II and Queen Karomama. He was installed in office by his father but faced opposition from the Thebans and was involved in a series of campaigns to claim his position. He recorded his biography on a long inscription on the temple wall at Karnak. It has been suggested that he is to be identified with a later King Osorkon III, who also had the title of high priest and is known mainly from monuments in Thebes and Middle Egypt. If this is true, Osorkon must have lived to an old age.
OSORKON (reigned c. 984–978 BC). Throne name Aakheperre setepenre. A king of Dynasty 21, now known to Egyptologists as Osorkon the Elder. Son of the Libyan chief Sheshonq and Mehtenweskhet. He briefly gained the throne from the Tanite king Amenemope, but it then passed to Siamun, apparently of another family. His nephew, Sheshonq I, reestablished the Libyans to the throne, founding Dynasty 22. The true form of his name was only established after the later kings Osorkon had been numbered, so he does not appear in that sequence.
OSORKON I (reigned c. 924–889 BC). Throne name Sekhemkheperre setepenre. Epithet meryamun. Son of Sheshonq I of Dynasty 22 and Queen Karomama. He established a major fortress at PerSekhemkheperre. He is attested in close relations with the port of Byblos on the eastern Mediterranean coast. He married Maatkare, daughter of Pasebakhaenniut II, by whom he was the father of Sheshonq, whom he installed as high priest of Amun in succession to his brother, Iuput. This son wrote his name in a royal cartouche and may be identified with the ephemeral king Sheshonq II. See also TAKELOT I.
OSORKON II (reigned c. 874–850 BC). Throne name Usimaatre setepenamun. Epithet meryamun sibast. Son of Takelot I of Dynasty 22

and Kapes. He continued the dynastic policy of putting sons in key positions, installing Sheshonq as high priest of Ptah in Memphis and Nimlot as high priest of Heryshef in Herakleopolis and later high priest of Amun in Karnak. He erected a festival hall in Bubastis to celebrate his jubilee. He was buried at Tanis, and his intact tomb was rediscovered in 1939. See also TAKELOT II.
OSORKON III (reigned c. 777–749 BC). Throne name Usimaatre setepenamun. Epithet siese. Ruler of Dynasty 23. Son of Queen Karomama. He is attested mainly by monuments in Thebes and Middle Egypt. He installed his son, Takelot III, as high priest of Amun in Karnak and his daughter, Shepenwepet I, as God’s wife of Amun. He was recognized as ruler in Thebes and Middle Egypt. See also OSORKON; RUDAMUN.
OSORKON IV (reigned c. 730–715 BC). Throne name possibly Aakheperre setepenamun. He was probably the last ruler of Dynasty 22 and ruled only in the areas of Tanis and Bubastis. He is named on the stela of Piye and attested in Assyrian sources in 716 BC. He may be the ruler who appears in the Bible as So, king of Egypt. He was followed by the Nubian rulers of Dynasty 25.
OSTRACON. Plural ostraca. Greek name used by Egyptologists to designate flakes of limestone or pottery with ink inscriptions in hieroglyphic, hieratic, demotic, and later Greek that are often found at many sites in Egypt. Some texts may be trial pieces or school exercises, but many are complete documents that may contain literary texts or such nonliterary material as legal texts, tax documents, or letters. These often provide valuable contributions to the study of Egyptian literature and daily life, notably the thousands of ostraca found at Deir el-Medina.
OXYRHYNCHUS. Greek name of a town in Middle Egypt, ancient Per-medjed, capital of the 19th Upper Egyptian nome and modern el-Bahnasa. Little is known of the site during the Pharaonic Period as it is attested only from the New Kingdom onward. The principal deity worshipped there was Seth, along with the sacred oxyrhynchus fish. Remains date from the Graeco-Roman Period into the Muslim

Period. The site was excavated from 1896–1907 by a British expediton, when thousands of papyri from that time were recovered. These finds included both known and lost literary texts and a large volume of documentary material. Further excavations at the site were carried out by an Italian team from 1910–1914, Flinders Petrie in 1922, and another Italian expedition from 1927–1934. The area has been excavated more recently by a Kuwaiti-financed expedition from 1985–1987, which concentrated on Islamic remains; an Egyptian dig in 1993, and a Spanish–Egyptian expedition from 1992–2002.
–P
PACHOMIUS (292–346 AD). Egyptian Christian monk and saint. He was born in Upper Egypt and later served in the Roman army in Egypt. Upon leaving the army, he settled at the village of Shenest in Middle Egypt and converted to Christianity, becoming an ascetic hermit at Tabennese. He was joined by other disciples, whom he organized into the first monastic community with a common rule. This gradually expanded during his lifetime to nine monasteries and two convents. He transformed the previously ascetic solitary style of living into that of a monastic existence, an idea that soon spread throughout the Christian world. See also ABRAHAM; ANTHONY; COPTIC CHURCH; SHENOUTE.
PALERMO STONE. A fragment of diorite that was inscribed with the annals of the kings of Egypt from the Predynastic Period to Dynasty 5, now housed in the Palermo Museum in Italy. While the early section is vague, later reigns are listed year by year with mention of the one important event of the year. Other fragments of the stone or similar stones have been located; however, all remain too broken to give a detailed account of the period. See also CHRONOLOGY.
PANEB (fl. 1235–1190 BC). Foreman of the community of Deir elMedina at the end of Dynasty 19. Son of the workman Nefersenut and Iuy. He was adopted by the childless foreman Neferhotep. He appears in the workforce at the end of the reign of Ramesses II, when he is attested with his wife, Wab. Upon the death of Neferhotep, who
PANEB • 171



was apparently killed in the civil war between Sety II and Amenmesse, he succeeded to his adopted father’s office. At the end of Dynasty 19 or possibly early Dynasty 20, he was accused by Amennakhte, brother of Neferhotep, of various crimes, including bribing the vizier to obtain the office of foreman; stealing from the royal tombs; and oppressive behavior toward his fellow workmen, notably adultery with some of their wives. He disappears abruptly from the records, and a later reference implies that he was punished for his misdeeds. See also HESUNEBEF; KENHERKHEPESHEF; KHA; RAMOSE; SENNEDJEM.
PAPYRUS. Plural papyri. An aquatic plant found in the swamps of ancient Egypt but is now extinct in that country. The name derives from Greek and probably ancient Egyptian. The pith of the plant was cut into strips and joined using its natural adhesive properties to form sheets that were never more than 50 centimeters high. The sheets could be glued together to form rolls or cut down to form smaller writing surfaces. Papyrus became the standard medium of written communication in ancient Egypt, and many examples of literary, religious, and documentary uses survive. The earliest uninscribed example dates to Dynasty 1. Papyrus was later used outside of Egypt throughout the ancient world before the invention of paper. See also LITERATURE; WISDOM LITERATURE.
PARENNEFER. See WENNEFER.
PASEBAKHAENNIUT I (reigned c. 1039–991 BC). The Greek form of his name is Psusennes. Throne name Akheperre setepenre. He ruled in the north while Thebes was under the control of the high priests of Amun. He was buried in Tanis, and his tomb was discovered intact by a French expedition headed by Pierre Montet in 1939. See also MUTNODJMET; THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
PASEBAKHAENNIUT II (reigned 959–945 BC). Throne name Titkheperure setepenre. Epithets hor and meryamun. Last ruler of Dynasty 21. He is generally believed to be identical to the likenamed high priest of Amun, son of Pinudjem II. Little is known about his reign. His daughter, Maatkare, married Osorkon I, second ruler of Dynasty 22. See also THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
172 • PAPYRUS



PASER (fl. 1300–1255 BC). Southern vizier of Sety I and Ramesses II. Son of the high priest of Amun Nebnejteru and Meritre. He began his career as chamberlain and later chief chamberlain to Sety I, who promoted him to vizier. Paser continued in office under Ramesses until at least year 21, when he was in correspondence with the Hittite court at the time of the peace treaty with Egypt. He was in direct charge of the community at Deir el-Medina, where he appears to have been highly respected. Paser is known from a large number of monuments, including his tomb (number 106) at Thebes. He was later rewarded with the post of high priest of Amun.

PASER (fl. 1116 BC). Mayor of Thebes under Ramesses IX. According to the Tomb Robbery Papyri, he first alerted authorities to the pillaging of the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings. He was initially rebuffed, but he eventually forced an inquiry that identified the thefts and culprits. His investigation was hindered by Paweraa, mayor of Western Thebes, who managed to keep his office in spite of the robberies.
PASHERMUT (reigned c. 393 BC). The Greek form of his name is Psammuthis. Throne name Userre setepenptah. Obscure ruler of Dynasty 29 and probable successor to Nefaarud I and rival to Hakor. He is attested in inscriptions from Thebes and Memphis.
PEDUBAST I (reigned c. 818–793 BC). Throne name Usermaatre setepenenamun. Epithet meryamun. Founder of Dynasty 23. He appears to have assumed the royal titulary during the reign of Sheshonq III of Dynasty 22 and founded a parallel line of rulers recognized in Thebes. Little is known about his reign or that of his contemporary, Iuput I. His effective successor was Osorkon III. See also THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
PEDUBAST II. Throne name Sehetepibre. Minor kinglet who flourished at the end of the Third Intermediate Period. He may well be the king of Tanis, who is mentioned in an Assyrian inscription from 671 BC.
PEDUBAST II • 173



PEFTJAUAWYBAST (reigned c. 730 BC). Throne name Neferkare. He is attested as ruler of Herakleopolis at the end of the Third Intermediate Period when the country was divided into various local kinglets with full royal titularies. He married a daughter of Rudamun of Dynasty 23.
PELUSIUM. Ancient Sjn or P3y-ir-Imn. Modern Tell Farama. Major town on Egypt’s eastern border in the 14th Upper Egyptian nome. It is attested from the Old Kingdom to the Arabic Period. Pelusium was the first destination of invaders across the Sinai desert, and its fall inevitably left the country open to such invaders as Alexander the Great. The town has not been fully investigated apart from rescue excavations by international teams in the 1990s. A Polish expedition has been working in the area of the newly discovered theater since 2003.
PEPY I (reigned c. 2321–2287 BC). Throne name Meryre. Son of Teti of Dynasty 6 and Queen Iput I. He had a lengthy reign and is attested at various sites, notably at Hierakonpolis, where a life-size copper statue of the king and a smaller figure, possibly of his son Nemtyemsaf I, were discovered. There is a mysterious reference in the inscription of Weni to a disgraced queen who was replaced by two sisters, both renamed Ankhesenmeryre, otherwise Ankhesenpepy I and II. His other wives included Nubwenet, Inenek-Inti, and Meritetes, whose tombs next to the pyramid of the king were identified in 1990, 1992, and 1995. Another queen, Nedjeftet, was named in texts found in the tomb of Inenek-Inti, while Mehaa was named in the tomb of her son, Prince Hornetjerikhet, excavated in 1996. The king was buried in a pyramid at Saqqara, whose discovery in 1880 revealed the first examples of pyramid texts and has been the subject of excavation by a French team since 1966. He was succeeded by his son, Nemtyemsaf I.
PEPY II (reigned c. 2278–2184 BC). Throne name Neferkare. Son of Pepy I and Ankhesenmeryre II. He succeeded his half brother, Nemtyemsaf I. As he was still a child, his mother and her brother apparently ruled on his behalf. Very little information has survived
174 • PEFTJAUAWYBAST



about his reign, except its length. Both the Turin Royal Canon and Manetho imply that he reigned for more than 90 years, but this date has recently been disputed, as only about 64 years are attested. The dynasty ended in confusion shortly after his death, so his longevity and increasing loss of power may have contributed to its downfall. The king was buried in a pyramid at Saqqara surrounded by the subsidiary pyramids of his queens, Iput II; Neith, who was his sister or half sister; Udjebten; and Ankhesenpepy IV, who was buried in the tomb of Iput. Another queen was Ankhesenpepy III, whose tomb was discovered in the funerary complex of Pepy I. He was succeeded by his son, Nemtyemsaf II.
PERIBSEN (reigned c. 2760 BC). Ruler of Dynasty 2 and successor to Nynetjer. There appears to have been a religious conflict during his reign between the followers of the gods Horus and Seth. Peribsen changed the standard inscription of the royal titulary, writing his name in a serekh not as a Horus name but as one preceded by that of Seth.
PERSIA. Ancient kingdom situated in modern Iran. The Persian king, Cyrus the Great, overthrew the Babylonian kingdom and annexed most of western Asia, creating the largest empire then known. His son, Cambyses, conquered Egypt in 525 BC and added it to the empire. Persian rule in Egypt was unpopular, and the Persians were later accused of neglecting Egyptian religion and withdrawing temple privileges. The Persian governor or satrap was usually a member of the royal family. The Persians were expelled by Amyrtaeos in 404 BC. In 343 BC, the Persian king Artaxerxes III reconquered Egypt, driving out the last native ruler, Nakhthorheb. Alexander the Great put an end to Persian rule in 332 BC and was welcomed as a liberator by the Egyptians. See also ACHAEMENES; ARSAMES; ARTAXERXES I; ARTAXERXES II; ARTAXERXES III; BAGOAS; DARIUS I; DARIUS II; XERXES I.
PETOSIRIS (fl. 330 BC). High priest of Thoth at Hermopolis. Son of the high priest of Thoth, Sishu, and Ankhefenkhons. He succeeded his elder brother as high priest and probably held office at the end of

the Persian Period and the beginning of Greek rule. He was the owner of a magnificent tomb at Tuna el-Gebel discovered in 1919. In the biographical inscriptions there, he claims to have restored the neglected temples of his city. See also GRAECO-ROMAN PERIOD.
PETRIE, WILLIAM MATTHEW FLINDERS (1853–1942). British archaeologist. He was born in Charlton, England, on 3 June 1853. He was educated at home, his interest in archaeology being encouraged by his father. Petrie was first sent to Egypt to survey the pyramid of Khufu from 1880–1882. He later excavated for the Egypt Exploration Fund from 1884–1986 and again from 1896–1905, but disagreements led to his founding of the Egyptian Research Account and later the British School of Archaeology in Egypt to finance his independent excavations by donations from subscribers. Petrie carried out work in many sites in Egypt, notably Tanis, Abydos, Hawara, Lahun, Amarna, and Thebes. He was the first archaeologist to stress the importance of such small, uninscribed objects as amulets and pottery, which could be used to date the consecutive archaeological levels of a site, and he strongly criticized those like his rival Edouard Naville, who sought only monumental, inscribed antiquities. He believed in prompt publication but then often omitted much detailed evidence. He also laid down the basic framework for the study of Predynastic and Early Dynastic Egypt through the through study of pottery. Petrie’s rather austere lifestyle in the field owed much to his desire to expend his resources on the excavations. He was appointed as the first professor of Egyptology at University College London in 1892, retiring in 1933. During the 1920s, he turned his attention to excavation in Palestine. He died in Jerusalem on 28 July 1942. His personal collection of antiquities, notebooks, and papers is preserved in the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology at University College in London.

PETRONIUS, PUBLIUS (fl. 25–21 BC). Roman prefect of Egypt c. 25–21 BC. He led Roman forces in two campaigns against Meroe after Meroitic forces raided Aswan and the temple of Philae and carried off booty, including statues of the emperor. A bronze head of

Augustus was discovered buried in Meroe in 1910 and is now housed in the British Museum. Roman forces marched to Qasr Ibrim, which they garrisoned, and sacked the Nubian city of Napata from 24–25 BC and in 22 BC. The war ended around 21 BC with a treaty that fixed the Egyptian border at Maharraqa south of Aswan and so awarded the Dodekaschoenus to Rome. See also CORNELIUS GALLUS, CAIUS.
PHARAOH. Modern word derived from Hebrew to designate the ruler of Egypt. The ancient Egyptian term peraa, or great house, was used at first to refer to the royal court as a whole and was not originally a synonym for king, ancient Egyptian nesu, but it was used with this meaning from the New Kingdom onward. Its first known use as a title was during the reign of Sheshonq I.
PHAROS. The famous Lighthouse of Alexandria and one of the seven wonders of the ancient world. Its construction was apparently initiated under Ptolemy I but was completed during the reign of Ptolemy II. Monumental statues of the latter king and his wife, Arsinoe, were placed before the entrance. The building was dedicated to the god Zeus. The lighthouse was destroyed by a series of earthquakes, notably in the 14th century AD, and left in ruins. The fort of Qait Bey was built on the site, probably reusing some of the original building materials. Blocks and the possible remains of the royal statues have been found in the sea nearby.
PHILAE. Greek name for an island in the Nile south of Elephantine where a temple to Isis and associated buildings were constructed dating from the Late Period to the Roman Period. Temples were also erected to deities from Nubia, and the site became a place of pilgrimage for Nubians and Egyptians. The last known hieroglyphic inscription (394 AD) and the last demotic inscription (452 AD) are recorded here. Following the advent of Christianity in Egypt, the temples remained open to accommodate the worshippers from the empire of Meroe until the time of Justinian, who closed them. From 1972–1979, the buildings on the site were dismantled and reconstructed on a neighboring island to rescue them from Lake Nasser, the new lake formed by the construction of the Aswan High Dam.
PHILAE • 177



PHILIP ARRHIDAEUS (reigned 323–317 BC). Son of Philip II of Macedon and Larinna and half brother of Alexander the Great. Although mentally incompetent, he was proclaimed his brother’s successor and ruled jointly with his nephew, Alexander II (IV), until he was murdered at the order of his stepmother, Olympias. He never visited Egypt, but his name is recorded on work in the temples of Karnak, Hermopolis, and Sebennytos.
PHILISTINES. A people named the Peleset who formed part of the coalition known as the Sea Peoples who invaded Egypt during the reign of Ramesses III of Dynasty 20. Ramesses III claims that they were defeated and that he allowed them to settle in southern Canaan. They had likely already occupied the area, and he won a nominal pledge of allegiance from them that lapsed when the Egyptians withdrew from Canaan in late Dynasty 20. The Philistine cities were in constant conflict with their new neighbors, the Israelites, as indicated in the Bible. They were subsequently absorbed in the Babylonian, Persian, and later empires. Recent excavations in Ashdod and other Philistine sites have shown new light on the Philistine material culture, but their origins remain obscure. They gave their name to the larger area now known as Palestine.
PIANKH (fl. c. 1094–1064 BC). High priest of Amun and military general at the end of Dynasty 20. He led his army against the viceroy of Kush, Panehsi, whose forces had overrun Thebes, advancing into Nubia, although it is not clear if he gained an outright victory. Letters written by him while on campaign have survived. It is not clear if he followed or preceded Herihor, but he was an ancestor of such independent high priests as Pinudjem I, who flourished under Dynasty 21. See also HRERE; NODJMET.
PIANKHY. See PIYE.
PIMAY (reigned c. 773–767 BC). Throne name Usimmatre setepenere or setepenamun. Epithet meryamun. An obscure monarch of Dynasty 22. Probably son of Sheshonq III or Sheshonq IV. He was the father of Sheshonq V. See also THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
178 • PHILIP ARRHIDAEUS



PINUDJEM. The name of two high priests of Amun who flourished during Dynasty 21. Pinudjem I (fl. 1064–26 BC) was the son of Piankh, and he succeeded as high priest and governor of Upper Egypt during the reign of Nesbanebdjed. He was an effective ruler of the south and later took royal titles with the throne name Khaheperre setepenamun. He was succeeded by his two sons, Masaharta and Menkheperre, and his two grandsons, Nesbanebdjed and Pinudjem II, who maintained Theban independence. The marriage links between the Theban family and the royal family of Dynasty 21 in Tanis are not always clear. His great-grandson, Pasebakhaenniut II, eventually became ruler of the entire country.
PI-RAMESSES. The northern capital city of Ramesses II built on the Delta at modern Qantir near the site of the Hyksos capital Avaris. Building seems to have begun under Sety I, but Ramesses II enlarged the city and gave it his name. Several poems in praise of the city survive. Pi-Ramesses seems to have been abandoned after Dynasty 20, and many of its monuments were used to decorate the cities of Tanis and Bubastis. It is currently being excavated by a German expedition that has uncovered the royal stables and other palace buildings.
PIYE (reigned c. 747–720 BC). Throne names Usimaatre and Sneferre. Ruler of Nubia formerly known as Piankhy. Successor of Kashta. He is known principally from a stela detailing his military campaign against Egypt around 728 BC. He appears to have inherited control over parts of southern Egypt, and he temporarily extended Nubian control throughout the country by defeating local princes, notably Tefnakhte, prince of Sais, although control was largely lost upon his return to Nubia. He was buried in el-Kurru near Napata and was succeeded by his brother, Shabaqo, who conquered Egypt and founded Dynasty 25. See also SHEPENWEPET.
POCOCKE, RICHARD (1704–1763). British traveler. He was born in Southampton, Great Britain, in 1704 and educated at Oxford. He visited Egypt from 1737–1738, journeying as far up the Nile as Philae. He visited the Valley of the Kings and left the first map of the area. He then traveled in Palestine and the East before returning to Egypt

in late 1738 and 1739 to visit Sinai. Upon his return to Great Britain, he published an account of his travels. He later became bishop of Ossory and then Meath. He died in Charleville, Ireland, on 25 September 1765.
POMPEIUS, GNAEUS (106–48 BC). Roman general. He was the son of Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo, a leading general. He took part in the Roman civil wars of the 80s BC, serving in Sicily, Italy, and Africa, and he later led Roman armies in Spain from 77–71 BC and Asia and Syria from 66–62 BC. He was consul in 70 BC and later in 52 BC. He formed a political allaince with Iulius Caesar, whose daughter he married, known as the First Triumvirate. He backed the restoration of Ptolemy XII but failed to arrange it in person. He fell out with Caesar and led the senatorial focres against him. Upon his defeat, he fled to Egypt, where he supposed the government of Ptolemy XIII would support him, as he had been a friend of the king’s father. Instead the king’s advisors regarded him as a political embarassment and possible threat, and he was killed as he landed on Egyptian soil.
POPILLIUS LAENAS, CAIUS (fl. 200–158 BC). Roman senator. He was consul in 172 and 158 BC. He served in the Roman army in Greece from 170–169 BC and visited Egypt in 168 BC, when he forced King Antiochus IV to halt his invasion.
POSTUMUS, CAIUS RABIRIUS. See RABIRIUS POSTUMUS, CAIUS.
POTHINUS (fl. 49–48 BC). Chief minister of Ptolemy XIII. Together with Achillas, he deposed Cleopatra VII, igniting civil war in Egypt. He also advised the murder of Gnaeus Pompeius. He opposed the intervention of Iulius Caesar and was executed by him in 48 BC.
POTTERY. The use of pottery for storage vessels and eating utensils began during prehistoric times and continued throughout Egyptian history. Pottery is found in sites in the eastern Sahara and Sudan dating back to 9000–8000 BC. It appears in Egypt in the seventh millennium from sites in the Fayum and Merimda Beni Salama. Hand

made painted pottery became common during the Predynastic Period with such distinctive designs as the Badarian and Naqada sequences. From these pieces, Flinders Petrie divised a scheme of sequence dating pottery, which is especially useful for working with objects from nonhistoric periods of time. These early periods are distinguished by their handmade pottery. The use of the potter’s wheel appears to have originated in Dynasty 4 or Dynasty 5. Scenes of pottery production appear on Old Kingdom tomb reliefs. The pottery of the historic periods is decorated in a simpler manner, is more utiliarian, and has not been the subject of detailed studies until recently. Scholars can now differentiate the types of clay used, for example silt or marl clays, and they are beginning to identify the exact locations of manufacture. Kilns used in the production of pottery have been discovered in excavations, like those found at predynastic Hierakonpolis. Imports of foreign pottery from Syria-Palestine, Crete, and Greece can prove useful dating tools as well. See also BADARI, EL-; TELL EL-YAHUDIYA.
PREDYNASTIC PERIOD (c. 5000–3100 BC). The period in Egyptian history from the development of permanent settlements until the creation of the united Egyptian state with Dynasty I. The period is subdivided into the cultures named from the sites of el-Badari and Naqada.
PREFECT. The title of the governor of Egypt during the Roman Period. The official was directly appointed by the Roman emperor from the equestrian order, namely the nonsenatorial official class. As Egypt supplied most of Rome’s grain, it was essential that the prefect not be a threat to the emperor or a potential rival. Senators were barred from entering Egypt without the emperor’s express approval. During the later Roman Empire, Egypt was divided into several provinces, but the senior official based in Alexandria retained the title of prefect. See also APION; CORNELIUS GALLUS, CAIUS; PETRONIUS, PUBLIUS; IULIUS ALEXANDER, TIBERIUS.
PREHERWENEMEF (fl. c. 1280–1260 BC). Fourth son of Ramesses II but the king’s third son by his queen, Nefertari. He appears in inscriptions from the beginning of Ramesses II’s reign. His fate is not

PSAMTIK I (reigned 664–610 BC). The Greek form of his name is Psammetichus. Throne name Wahibre. Son of Nekau I of Sais. Upon his father’s death in battle against Tantamani in 664 BC, he fled to Assyria and was restored as puppet ruler by Assyrian forces in 663 BC, founding Dynasty 26. He skillfully reunited Egypt under his rule with the help of Greek mercenaries and by installing his daughter, Nitocris, as God’s wife of Amun in Thebes. He gradually disentangled himself from Assyrian control and restored Egyptian independence. See also MENTUEMHAT.
PSAMTIK II (reigned 595–589 BC). Throne name Neferibre. Son and successor of Nekau II. He sought to restore Egyptian prestige by a campaign into Nubia recorded by graffiti of his soldiers at Abu Simbel and also intrigued in Palestine. He arranged the adoption of his daughter, Ankhnesneferibre, as God’s wife of Amun. He died on 10 February 589 BC. See also WAHIBRE.
PSAMTIK III (reigned 526–525 BC). Throne name Ankhkaenre. Son of Ahmose II and Tantheta, daughter of the priest of Ptah Padineith. Shortly after his accession, he faced an invasion by Cambyses, king of Persia, who conquered Egypt and took him prisoner. He and his son were later executed for plotting against the new ruler.
PTAH. Chief god of Memphis depicted as a mummiform man with a cap and beard holding a sceptre. His principal epithet was Lord of Maat, or Truth. He was associated with crafts. Ptah was worshipped throughout the country as one of the main deities. The priests of Memphis credited him with the first act of creation. His consort was

PTOLEMAIC PERIOD (323–30 BC). The term used by Egyptologists for the period during which Egypt was ruled by the Macedonian general Ptolemy I and his descendants. The beginning of the period varies, as Ptolemy was in charge from 323 BC, but he did not openly assume independent rule until 305 BC. Many temples from Upper Egypt erected or refurbished by the Ptolemies survive; however, the government was continued from Alexandria by the Greek ruling class, and Egyptian culture, although respected, remained secondary to the interests of the rulers. See also PTOLEMY II–PTOLEMY XV.
PTOLEMY (d. 58 BC). King of Cyprus. Illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX by an unknown mistress. When his brother became Ptolemy XII of Egypt in 80 BC, he was given Cyprus to rule. His kingdom was unilaterally annexed by Rome in 58 BC. He was offered the position of high priest at Paphos but commited suicide. The failure of his

brother, Ptolemy XII, to support him led to a rebellion in Egypt that temporarily ousted him from the throne.
PTOLEMY I SOTER (c. 367–282 BC). Son of Lagus and Arsinoe. Macedonian nobleman and military commander under Alexander the Great. In 323 BC, upon the death of Alexander the Great, he secured the governorship of Egypt, which he virtually ruled as an independent state after disposing of Cleomenes. He expanded his control to Cyprus and parts of Syria, Greece, and Asia Minor. He assumed the title of king in 305 BC. Unlike other would-be successors of Alexander the Great, he had no pretensions to try to control the entire empire. Ptolemy I had several wives, including the Persian Artacama, daughter of Artabazus, whom he presumably abandoned; the Macedonian Eurydice, daughter of the regent Antipater; and finally Berenice I, leading to court intrigues over his succession until he made his son Ptolemy II, by his last wife, coregent. He apparently died during the first half of 282 BC. See also ALEXANDER II; PHILIP ARRHIDAEUS.
PTOLEMY II PHILADELPHUS (308–246 BC). Son of Ptolemy I and Berenice I. He was named coregent with his father in 285 BC and succeeded to sole rule in 282 BC. His reign was prosperous, allowing the king to undertake major building works, including the Pharos, or Lighthouse, of Alexandria; Library of Alexandria; and Museum of Alexandria. He scandalized Greek public opinion by divorcing his wife, Arsinoe I, and marrying his full sister, Arsinoe II. He died in January 246 BC and was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy III.
PTOLEMY III EUERGETES (c. 284–222 BC). Son of Ptolemy II and his first wife, Arsinoe I. He succeeded to the throne in 246 BC and continued to expand Egypt’s control in Syria and Asia Minor. He also acquired Cyrene through marriage with its heiress Berenice II. He died between October and December 222 BC and was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy IV.
PTOLEMY IV PHILOPATOR (c. 244–205 BC). Son of Ptolemy III and Berenice II. He married his sister, Arsinoe III. He pursued an
184 • PTOLEMY I SOTER



aggressive policy in Asia in an attempt to gain control of PalestineSyria but faced a major revolt in the south where native rulers Harwennefer and Ankhwennefer were proclaimed. His chief minister was Sosibios, who arranged a series of murders of members of the royal family to strengthen his hold on power. The king appears to have died in late 205 BC, but his death was initially concealed by his court. He was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy V.
PTOLEMY V EPIPHANES (210–180 BC). Son of Ptolemy IV and Arsinoe III. He was born on 9 October 210 and was at first under the regency of various courtiers, notably Sosibios. He faced difficulties throughout his reign with revolts in Egypt that were eventually suppressed and clashes over Ptolemaic possessions in Syria and Palestine that were lost in 200 BC. He married a Seleucid princess, Cleopatra I. He died in September/October 180 BC and was succeeded by his son, Ptolemy VI.
PTOLEMY VI PHILOMETER (c. 186–145 BC). Son of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I. He succeeded in 180 BC at a young age under the regency of his mother and later courtiers. When Egypt was threatened by Antiochus IV, the royal family was united through his marriage to his sister, Cleopatra II, in 176 BC and their joint rule together with his brother, Ptolemy VIII, beginning in 170 BC. He was briefly captured and then released by Antiochus IV during the latter’s invasion in 169 BC, and his rule was restored by a Roman ultimatum to the Syrian king to withdraw from Egypt in 168 BC after a second invasion. His reign was undermined by war with his brother, who was expelled to Cyrene in 163 BC. Ptolemy VI attempted to regain Egyptian possessions in Syria in 145 BC but died of wounds sustained in a battle near Antioch in which his forces were victorious. His elder son, Ptolemy Eupator, died during his lifetime, so he was initially succeeded by his younger son, Ptolemy VII.
PTOLEMY VII NEOS PHILOPATOR (c. 162–145 BC). Son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. He was made joint ruler with his father but was killed in 145 BC when his uncle, Ptolemy VIII, returned to Egypt and seized the throne.
PTOLEMY VII NEOS PHILOPATOR • 185



PTOLEMY VIII EUERGETES II (c. 182–116 BC). Nicknamed Physcon, or potbelly. Younger son of Ptolemy V and Cleopatra I. He was made joint ruler with his brother, Ptolemy VI, in 170 BC and expelled him from the country in 164 but was himself forced to retire to Cyrene in 163 BC. Upon his brother’s death in 145 BC, Ptolemy VIII returned to Egypt and seized the throne, murdering his nephew, Ptolemy VII. He first married in 145 BC his sister, Cleopatra II, by whom he had one son, Ptolemy Memphites, whom he eventually put to death. Around 140 BC, he married his niece, Cleopatra II’s daughter, Cleopatra III, thus precipitating a civil war with his sister in 132 BC. He was initially driven out of Egypt but regained control in 130 BC. The civil war was finally resolved in 124 BC by the recognition of Cleopatra II’s position as senior queen. Ptolemy VIII died on 28 June 116 BC, leaving Egypt to Cleopatra III and whichever of her two sons, Ptolemy IX or Ptolemy X, she chose to rule with her.
PTOLEMY IX SOTER II (142–80 BC). Nicknamed Lathyros or chickpea. Elder son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. He was possibly born on 18 February 142 BC. King of Cyprus under his father, he succeeded him despite the wishes of his mother, who preferred his younger brother, the future Ptolemy X. He was forced to divorce his sister-wife Cleopatra IV in favor of a younger sister, Cleopatra V Selene. He was expelled from Egypt in 107 BC by his mother and brother but was able to return in 88 BC and reigned with his daughter, Cleopatra Berenice III, until his death in March 80 BC.
PTOLEMY X ALEXANDER I (c. 140–88 BC). Younger son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III. He was his mother’s choice as ruler in 116 BC but was forced to acknowledge his elder brother, Ptolemy IX. Later king of Cyprus, he ousted his elder brother in 107 BC and reigned in Egypt with his niece, Cleopatra Berenice III, as consort until they were expelled by a popular revolt in 89 BC. He returned with Syrian forces but was again expelled to Lycia. He was killed in a battle at sea in March 88 BC as he attempted to flee to Cyprus.
PTOLEMY XI ALEXANDER II (c. 105–80 BC). Son of Ptolemy X and an unknown wife. He was living in exile until he was chosen as the consort of his cousin, Cleopatra Berenice III, upon the death of
186 • PTOLEMY VIII EUERGETES II



her father, Ptolemy IX. He murdered his wife shortly afterward and was in turn killed by the Alexandrian mob in June 80 BC. He was succeeded by his cousin, Ptolemy XII.
PTOLEMY XII THEOS PHILOPATOR PHILADELPHUS NEOS DIONYSIUS (d. 51 BC). Illegitimate son of Ptolemy IX by an unknown mistress. He was chosen as ruler upon the murder of Ptolemy XI and soon gained the nickname Auletes, or flute player. He was expelled in 58 BC, following his failure to support his brother, Ptolemy, king of Cyprus. He was replaced by his daughter, Berenice IV, but he was restored in 55 BC by Roman troops and executed his daughter. He appointed the Roman Rabirius Postumus, who loaned him the money to pay for his restoration, as his finance minister. His wife was Cleopatra VI Tryphaena and may have been his sister, but it is not known if she was the mother of all of his children, notably Cleopatra VII. See also ARSINOE IV; PTOLEMY XIII, PTOLEMY XIV PHILOPATOR.
PTOLEMY XIII (c. 61–47 BC). Elder son of Ptolemy XII and possibly Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. He succeeded jointly with his sister and wife, Cleopatra VII, but he soon fell out with her, and civil war broke out between the siblings. The situation was changed by the arrival of Iulius Caesar, who soon supported Cleopatra. The king was defeated in battle against Roman forces and apparently drowned in the Nile during the action in January 47 BC. See also ACHILLAS; ARSINOE IV; POTHINUS.
PTOLEMY XIV PHILOPATOR (c. 59–44 BC). Younger son of Ptolemy XII and possibly Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. He replaced his older brother as consort of Cleopatra VII, but his position was purely nominal, and he was probably murdered by her.
PTOLEMY XV PHILOPATOR PHILOMETER (47–30 BC). Son of Cleopatra VII, who named Iulius Caesar as the father. The boy was nicknamed Caesarion. He was made joint ruler of Egypt with his mother in 44 BC upon the death of his uncle, Ptolemy XIV. He was executed while trying to escape from Roman forces following the conquest of Egypt in 30 BC.
PTOLEMY XV PHILOPATOR PHILOMETER • 187



PTOLEMY APION (d. 96 BC). Son of Ptolemy VIII by his concubine, Irene. His father made him ruler of Cyrene in 145 BC, where he ruled until his childless death in 96 BC. He left his kingdom to Rome.
PTOLEMY EUPATOR (c. 163–152 BC). Elder son of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II. He was named coregent with his father but died young.
PTOLEMY MEMPHITES (c. 144–131 BC). Son of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra II. Heir to the throne, he was executed by his father in 131 BC after his mother had revolted in an attempt to overthrow her husband.
PTOLEMY PHILADELPHUS (b. 36 BC). Younger son of Marcus Antonius and Cleopatra VII. He was assigned Syria and the eastern part of the Roman Empire by his father in 34 BC. He was taken prisoner by Augustus in 30 BC, but his ultimate fate is unknown. See also ALEXANDER HELIOS; CLEOPATRA SELENE.
PUDUHEPA (fl. 1285–1220 BC). Queen of the Hittites. Daughter of Pentipsharri, priest of Ishtar at Lawazantiya. She married the future Hattusili III and supported his usurpation of the throne. She played an important role in his government, especially in foreign policy. She arranged marriage alliances with foreign monarchs, including the marriage of her daughter, Maathorneferure, with Ramesses II. Her correspondence with the Egyptian king and his wife, Nefertari, has been recovered at the Hittite capital.
PUNT. A country located along the Red Sea coast, probably in Somalia, to which Egyptian expeditions were periodically sent from the time of the Old Kingdom to the New Kingdom to obtain such exotic products as incense. An expedition sent by Queen Hatshepsut is recorded in detail on reliefs on her funerary temple at Deir el-Bahri. The expedition reached the Red Sea via the Wadi Hammamat and sailed from a port located at Mersa Gawasis.
PYLON. Greek name for the massive stone gateway in front of Egyptian temples and also within several of the larger temples. The pylon
188 • PTOLEMY APION



was decorated with scenes of the king triumphant over his enemies and had emplacements for massive flagstaffs. Obelisks and large royal sculptures were often placed in front of the pylon.
PYRAMID. Greek name for the four-sided, triangular-shaped monument that marked the burial of kings from the Old Kingdom to the Middle Kingdom. Rulers from Dynasty 1 and Dynasty 2 were buried in mudbrick mastaba tombs, but during Dynasty 3 a new architectural form in stone was evolved ascribed according to legend to the vizier Imhotep for his master, Djoser. The stone step pyramid at Saqqara consisted of a series of six mastabas placed on top of each other covering the burial chamber beneath. The tomb complex also included a mortuary temple and other ritual buildings. This type of complex was used during the course of the dynasty, but at the beginning of Dynasty 4, the true pyramid with its pyramidion capstone was created for Snefru at Meidum and later Dahshur. The pyramids of Khufu, Khafre, and Menkaure at Giza represent the high point of pyramid construction. Each of these pyramids had a mortuary temple associated with it, as well as a valley temple reached by water and connected to the main pyramid by a dry causeway. The tombs of the queens in small pyramids and favored courtiers in mastabas surrounded the king’s tomb. Later pyramids were built on a less lavish scale with rubble cores and only one course of stone masonry on the outside, but they were highly decorated with reliefs in the temples and causeway walls and pyramid texts inscribed inside the burial chamber. Pyramid construction continued into the Middle Kingdom, although the pyramids of Dynasty 12 in the Fayum area often had a mudbrick core. At the beginning of Dynasty 18, pyramids were abandoned by rulers in favor of secluded tombs in the Valley of the Kings, but the royal mortuary temples remained, now located near the Nile, and some are of considerable size. Small mudbrick pyramids with a stone pyramidion were used to mark burials of private individuals. The use of small pyramids for royal burials with associated chapels was revived by Dynasty 25 at cemeteries near Napata and Meroe.
PYRAMID TEXTS. Religious texts inscribed on the walls of the royal pyramid to enable the king to pass safely to the next life. The earliest
PYRAMID TEXTS • 189



texts are inscribed in the pyramid of Unas, last ruler of Dynasty 5, and were discovered in 1881. The texts were first discovered in 1880 in the pyramid of Pepy I of Dynasty 6. See also AFTERLIFE.
PYRAMIDION. The capstone of a pyramid. After the use of pyramids for royal burials was discontinued, mudbrick pyramids were placed on top of private tombs, as at Thebes surmounted by a stone pyramidion often inscribed with a prayer to and decorated with a figure of the sun god Re-Harakhty.
–Q
QAA (reigned c. 2915 BC). Eighth and final ruler of Dynasty 1 and successor to Semerkhet. Like his predecessors, he was buried in Abydos, where his tomb has recently been reexcavated by a German expedition. A fine stela of the king is now housed in the Louvre Museum. See also DYNASTY 2.
QADESH. See KADESH.

QASR IBRIM. Modern name for a site in Nubia situated on the east bank of the Nile 116 kilometers north of Wadi Halfa. Greek name Primis. The site consists of a Roman fortress but includes isolated blocks and stelae from the New Kingdom and a temple from Dynasty 25, as well as later Meroitic occupation and a Christian cathedral. The town later housed a Turkish garrison. The construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s has led to flooding of part of the site, which is now an island, by Lake Nasser. The site and its vicinity have been excavated by the Egypt Exploration Society since 1961. Much documentary material from the Coptic Period and Turkish Period has been discovered, along with interesting material from the Napatan Period, Meroitic Period, and Roman Period occupation. Nearby chapels were dedicated by the viceroys of Kush of Dynasty 18 and Dynasty 19, and a rock-cut stela of Sety I was removed before the area was covered by the new lake.

QAU EL-KEBIR. Modern name for a site in the 10th Upper Egyptian nome. Ancient Djuqa, Graeco-Roman Antaeopolis. The settlement site is destroyed but once had the remains of a Graeco-Roman temple. The cemeteries date from the Old Kingdom to the GraecoRoman Period. The most important items at the site are the tombs of the nomarchs of the First Intermediate Period and the early Middle Kingdom. The site was excavated by an Italian expedition from 1905–1906, a German expedition from 1913–1914, and Flinders Petrie’s team from 1923–1925. Another cemetery for the elite of the area in the Old Kingdom was located at nearby El-Hammumiya, which was also examined by the Petrie expedition and later recorded by an Australian team from 1989–1990.

QUDSHU. Canaanite fertility goddess whose worship became popular in Egypt during Dynasty 18 and Dynasty 19. She is represented as a full-frontal nude woman and is often depicted with the Syrian war god Reshep. See also ANAT; ASTARTE; RELIGION.
QUEEN. The wife of the king. The most common term for the position was hmt nswt, or “king’s wife,” and from the Second Intermediate Period onward, the term hmt nswt wrt, or “king’s great wife,” was used to denote the chief queen. Other terms were used, particularly during the Old Kingdom. It appears that there was normally only one chief queen at a time, although Ramesses II may have bestowed this title more frequently. The king appears to have had a relatively free choice of wives, although many women were picked for political reasons. The king was not obliged to marry his sister, and the heiress concept has been shown to be false. Kings may have married their sisters to enhance their divine status, as the gods married their sisters. Similarly, Amenhotep III and Ramesses II appear to have granted the title of queen to some of their daughters, although it remains unclear whether such marriages were honorific. The son of the

chief queen may have been favored in the royal succession, but the known succession of sons of minor queens and concubines indicates that this was not necessarily always the case. The king’s mother, if a minor wife, was then raised to the status of chief queen.

–R
RABIRIUS POSTUMUS, CAIUS (fl. 80–43 BC). Roman banker. Son of Caius Curtius and Rabiria. He was adopted by his mother’s brother. He lent money to Ptolemy XII and later financed the king’s restoration to the throne in 55 BC to recover his debts. To obtain repayment of his loan, he was made finance minister of Egypt from 55–54 BC. He became a supporter of Iulius Caesar and was made a senator. He possibly returned to Egypt as a member of Caesar’s entourage. He later supported Augustus.
RAHOTEP (fl. 2600 BC). A prince of Dynasty 4, probably a son of Huni or Snefru. He held the post of high priest of Re at Heliopolis. His intact tomb was discovered at Meidum in 1871, and it is famous for the painted statues of the owner and his wife, Nefret, now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum. It is noteworthy that the moustache on his statue in the style of Old Kingdom males still survives, whereas this feature, which is usually painted on, has faded on other sculptures of the time.
RAMESSES (fl. 1279–1229). Second son of Ramesses II and eldest son of Queen Isitnofret. He appears in inscriptions during the early part of his father’s reign. He held the position of general and was crown prince from approximately 1254–1229 BC, but he died before his father. He was buried in KV5 in the Valley of the Kings. See also BINTANAT; KHAEMWESE; MERENPTAH.

RAMESSES I (reigned c. 1295–1294 BC). Throne name Menpehtyre. Son of a military officer named Sety. First ruler of Dynasty 19. He was vizier to the apparently childless Horemheb and succeeded to the throne upon the latter’s death. His reign was short, but he left a son, Sety I, to reestablish Egyptian prestige at home and abroad. He was buried in tomb KV16 in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy has not been recovered or identified. He is commemorated in the mortuary temple of his son at Qurna.
RAMESSES II (reigned c. 1279–1212 BC). Throne name Usermaatre setepenre. Epithet meryamun. Son of Sety I and Tuy, daughter of the lieutenant of the chariotry, Raia. As an apparently only son, he was named crown prince at an early age by his father and provided with the accoutrements of kingship, including a royal harem. Upon his accession, Ramesses II sought to restore Egyptian control in Syria but was defeated by the Hittites at the battle of Kadesh in year 5 (c. 1274 BC). In year 21 (c. 1258 BC), he signed a formal treaty with the Hittites ending the conflict. In year 34 (c. 1245 BC), he married Maathorneferure, the daughter of the Hittite king, to cement the alliance. He apparently later married a second daughter. Ramesses II emphasized Egyptian power through many construction projects, notably his new capital at Pi-Ramesses and many Nubian temples, including at Abu Simbel. His wives included Nefertari, for whom he had a splendid tomb built in the Valley of the Queens at Thebes, and Isitnofret. Ramesses II also married three of his daughters, the eldest Princess Bintanat, Meritamun, and Nebettawy. He had around 100 children, including his eldest son, Amenherkhepeshef, by Nefertari, and Khaemwese and his eventual heir, Merenptah, both by Isitnofret. Ramesses II reigned for 66 years and two months and is remembered in legend as a great conqueror. His tomb (KV7) in the Valley of the Kings has suffered severe damage and awaits a proper publication. An extensive tomb, which he had built for his many sons, has recently been uncovered in KV5. His mummy survived in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri and was recovered in 1881. His mortuary temple, known as the Ramessum, is well preserved. See also HENTTAWY; MEHY; MERYATUM; PREHERWENEMEF; RAMESSES; SETY.
RAMESSES II • 193



RAMESSES III (reigned c. 1186–1153 BC). Throne name Usermaatre meryamun. Epithet heka iunu. Son of Sethnakhte and Tiyemerenese of Dynasty 20. His reign was distinguished by his successful campaign against the Sea Peoples, whose invasion of Egypt he crushed. He was able to maintain most of Egypt’s Asian empire. His principal surviving monuments are his mortuary temple at Medinet Habu and his tomb (KV11) in the Valley of the Kings. Ramesses III was apparently assassinated during a conspiracy against his appointed heir, Ramesses IV, who successfully countered the plot and punished the conspirators as recounted in the Harem Conspiracy Papyri. His mummy was recovered from the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881. See also KV3; PREHERWENEMEF; SETHHERKHEPESHEF.
RAMESSES IV (reigned c. 1153–1147 BC). Throne name Usermaatre, later Hekamaatre. Son and successor of Ramesses III. He may be identical with a Prince Ramesses, son of Ramesses III, whose tomb (KV53) was prepared in the Valley of the Queens but obviously abandoned upon his accession. He successfully overcame the conspirators who assassinated his father and had them tried and punished. The Harris Papyrus recording the benefactions of his father was compiled during his reign. Ramesses IV appeared to have intended to undertake massive construction works in the Theban area, but he died when the work was barely begun. He doubled the number of the workmen at Deir el-Medina so his tomb KV2 in the Valley of the Kings would be completed. His body was recovered from the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898. See also DUATENTOPET.
RAMESSES V (reigned c. 1147–1143 BC). Throne name Usermaatre sekheperenre. Personal name Amenherkhepeshef. Epithet meryamun. Successor and possibly son of Ramesses IV. The principal document of his brief reign is the extensive Wilbour Papyrus outlining the possessions of the temple of Amun at Thebes throughout Egypt. He prepared tomb KV9 in the Valley of the Kings for his burial, but it was taken over by his successor, Ramesses VI, so it is not certain if he was buried here. His body was recovered from the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898.

RAMESSES VI (reigned c. 1143–1136 BC). Throne name Nebmaatre meryamun. Personal name Amenherkhepeshef. Epithet netjer heka iunu. Successor of Ramesses V and possible son of Ramesses III. He installed his daughter, Princess Isis, as God’s wife of Amun, apparently the first known virgin princess to hold the post. He was buried in tomb KV9 in the Valley of the Kings, which he had taken over from his predecessor. His body was recovered from the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898.
RAMESSES VII (reigned c. 1136–1129 BC). Throne name Usermaatre meryamun setepenre. Personal name Itamun. Epithet netjer heka iunu. Successor and possibly son of Ramesses VI. He was buried in tomb KV1 in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy has not been identified.
RAMESSES VIII (reigned c. 1129–1126 BC). Throne name Usermaatre akhenamun. Personal name Sethherkhepeshef. Epithet meryamun. Successor of Ramesses VII and possibly son of Ramesses III. His reign was brief, and no tomb has been identified for him.
RAMESSES IX (reigned c. 1126–1108 BC). Throne name Neferkare setepenre. Personal name Khaemwese. Epithet mereramun. A member of the royal family of Dynasty 20 whose exact origin is uncertain. Successor to Ramesses VIII. A large volume of documentation survives from his reign concerning the affairs of Deir el-Medina and the Theban area, notably the Tomb Robbery Papyri, which illustrates the gradual breakdown in law and order and the growing independence of the Theban area under its high priest. He was buried in tomb KV6 in the Valley of the Kings, and his body was recovered from the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881.
RAMESSES X (reigned c. 1108–1099). Throne name Khepermaatre setepenre. Successor and possibly son of Ramesses IX. The length of his reign is uncertain. He was buried in tomb KV18 in the Valley of the Kings, but his mummy has not been identified.

netjer heka iunu. Successor and possibly son of Ramesses X. His reign marked the end of Dynasty 20. Contemporary documents refer to civil war and tomb robberies in Thebes, which became increasingly independent under the high priest of Amun. The king’s tomb (KV4) in the Valley of the Kings was left unfinished. It is presumed that he spent most of his time in the north, but the circumstances of his death and the change of the dynasty are unknown. His body has not been recovered. See also HERIHOR; PIANKH.
RAMESSEUM. Modern name for the site of the mortuary temple of Ramesses II on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes near Deir el-Bahri. Originally named Hnm-W3st. The temple is noted for its fallen colossal statue of the king, which inspired the poetic work of Percy Bysshe Shelley. The inscriptions also detail the royal children and the king’s wars. The site was excavated by British archaeologist John Quibell in 1896. A Franco–Egyptian team has been in charge of the publication and excavation of the temple since the 1970s.
RAMESSIDE PERIOD (c. 1295–1069 BC). A term used to describe the rule of Dynasty 19 and Dynasty 20, when the most common royal name was Ramesses. The period marked the time of Egypt’s imperial power, with an empire encompassing Nubia and SyriaPalestine. It was also a period when Egypt was open to foreign influence, especially from Syria in language and religion. See also RAMESSES I–RAMESSES XI.
RAMOSE (fl. 1300–1240 BC). Chief scribe of the Deir el-Medina community. Son of Amenemheb and Kakaia. He previously served at the mortuary temple of Thutmose IV and was appointed to Deir elMedina in year 5 of Ramesses II. He was still in office in year 38. He appears to have been one of the wealthiest members of the community and had three tombs (numbers 7, 212, and 250) built for himself and his dependants. He and his wife, Mutemwia, were childless and adopted Kenherkhepeshef, who succeeded to Ramose’s office. See also HESUNEBEF; KHA; PANEB; SENNEDJEM.

RANEFEREF (reigned c. 2448–2445 BC). Variant transcription of the name also transcribed as Neferefre. Personal name Isi. Fourth ruler of Dynasty 5. Son of Neferirkare and probably Khentkaues II. His reign was short, and his funerary complex at Abusir was left unfinished. It was examined and excavated by a Czech expedition from 1978–2002. Several fine pieces of sculpture were recovered, as well as more Abusir papyri. See also NIUSERRE; SHEPSEKARE.
RE. The ancient Egyptian sun god whose main place of worship was at Heliopolis. The sun god became the principal god of Egypt beginning in Dynasty 4, displacing the sky god Horus, with whom Re is often combined in the form of the god Re-Harakhty. He was usually combined with other gods who were placed at the head of the pantheon, notably Sobek and Amun. During late Dynasty 18, the worship of Re in the form of the sun’s disk, or Aten, was promoted by Akhenaten but failed to displace Amun. Re is usually depicted as a human figure with a feathered headdress but can be represented with a hawk head. See also RELIGION.

REISNER, GEORGE ANDREW (1867–1942). American excavator. He was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, on 5 November 1867. A Harvard graduate, he then studied Egyptology at Berlin. He became director of archaeological work in Egypt, the Hearst Expedition, for the University of California, financed by the Hearst family, from 1899–1905 and then directed the Nubian Archaeological Survey for the Egyptian Antiquities Service from 1907–1909. He was appointed curator of the Egyptian Department of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts in 1910, and until his death he conducted excavations at various sites in Egypt, including Zawiyet el-Aryan; several sites in Nubia; and especially Giza, where he discovered the tomb of Queen Hetepheres, and Nag el-Deir, where he found the Reisner Papyri.

REKHMIRE (fl. 1425 BC). Vizier toward the end of the reign of Thutmose III and the beginning of that of Amenhotep II. Son of Neferweben and Bata. He came from a prominent official family, as his grandfather, Ahmose, and his uncle, Woser, had both held the post of vizier. He was buried at Thebes (Theban tomb number 100), and his tomb contains a major inscription that details the duties of the vizier as well as scenes of foreign peoples bringing tribute to the Egyptian court. See also AMENEMHAT I; AY; HEMIUNU; IMHOTEP; INTEFYOKER; KAGEMNI; MERERUKA; NEFERMAAT; PASER; PTAHHOTEP; PTAHSHEPSES; RAMESSES I.
RELIGION. For most of Egyptian history no attempt was made to develop a coherent religious theology for the entire country. Egypt consisted of many cities, each of which had a god or goddess to whom the inhabitants were particularly attached, along with the deity’s family represented in a local triad and often an animal or animals sacred to the local divinity. For example, Meretseger, the snake goddess of Thebes, represented a purely regional deity; however, some gods and goddesses, for example, Ptah of Memphis; Thoth of Hermopolis; or Osiris, the god of the dead, were worshipped on a national level throughout the country. The patronage of the king elevated others to the status of supreme deity, like the sky god Horus, the sun god Re of Heliopolis, the formerly obscure god Amun of Thebes, the Ptolemaic deity Sarapis, and the goddess Isis during the Roman Period.

More influential deities might absorb a local god or combine to form a composite god, like Re-Harakhty or Amun-Re. Various local temples as at Heliopolis or Hermopolis conceived different myths of creation in which their god naturally played the crucial role. The only attempt to impose a more uniform worship—that of the Aten disk—by Akhenaten ended in failure. In most cities, the gods were worshipped in major temples built or enlarged through the favor of the king and staffed with priests appointed by him. It was their duty to carry out the rituals to maintain maat and appease the gods. The bulk of the priests inherited their rank and were trained in their calling by temple schools and their relations, but the king could and did assign the top posts to royal favorites who could have been from priestly families but also from the royal family, the bureaucracy, or the military. He could also shift priests from one temple to another. Worship was not confined to the temples. Unlike the state temples from which the local population would have been largely barred, common folk would have access to small local shrines and chapels, sometimes in their own homes, as reflected in the religious practice at Deir el-Medina. Stelae and statues of the deceased with prayers giving their name were erected in the shrines, tombs, and temples to keep the individual’s memory alive. The ancient religion was eventually replaced by Christianity and evolved into the distinctive Coptic Church.

RENENUTET. Egyptian goddess of fertility. She was also regarded as a protector of the king and depicted as a cobra. She was worshipped in the Fayum, notably at the site of Medinet Madi. She was known as Termouthis during the Graeco-Roman Period and identified with Isis. See also RELIGION.
RENENUTET • 199



REPIT. Greek Triphis. A goddess whose principal place of worship was at the southern Athribis in Upper Egypt. She is attested from the Early Dynastic Period to the Graeco-Roman Period. She is associated with the god Min and Sokar-Osiris. See also RELIGION.
RESHEP. Canaanite war god worshipped in Egypt during the New Kingdom. He is usually depicted as a bearded man carrying military weapons. He is found associated with the Canaanite fertility goddess Qudshu and the Egyptian fertility god Min at Deir el-Medina. See also ANAT; ASTARTE.
RIB-HADDA (fl. 1350–1330 BC). Ruler of Byblos. He was a frequent correspondent in the Amarna letters. He complained bitterly about the encroachments of Abdi-Ashirta and Aziru, kings of Amurru to his north, and demanded Egyptian assistance. He was eventually driven from Byblos and sought refuge in Beirut. His ultimate fate is unclear.
RISHI COFFIN. This term is used to denote a type of anthropoid coffin used during the late Second Intermediate Period and early Dynasty 18. The body of the coffin was decorated in a feather pattern that was probably meant to evoke the goddess Nut to envelop the deceased in her protective embrace. See also SARCOPHAGUS.
ROAD SYSTEM. Although the most convenient method of travel was through navigation on the river Nile, marked desert tracks did exist along the Nile and Delta in the Eastern Desert and between the oases in the Western Desert. These were often bordered by pebbling and marked by cairns to give guidance to travelers. These roads could be traversed on foot or on donkeys. Water reserves seem to have been arranged at intervals on the route to the oases. The study of these roadways has only recently been undertaken and has resulted in the discovery of new graffiti from all periods.
ROMAN PERIOD (30 BC–395 AD). The term used by Egyptologists to designate the period when Egypt was under the direct rule of Roman emperors in Rome whose representative, the prefect of Egypt, was the effective governor of the country. Egypt was regarded as the
200 • REPIT



private property of the Roman ruler, and Roman citizens were not allowed to enter the country without imperial permission. Privileges were granted to Greek residents, but these were strictly defined and more limited than during the Ptolemaic Period. Construction work on Egyptian temples was undertaken, but there was no official recognition of the use of the Egyptian language, especially in legal contexts. After the court was moved to Constantinople, Egypt was ruled as part of the Eastern Empire during the Byzantine Period.
ROSETTA STONE. A bilingual decree of 196 BC built into the fort at Rosetta discovered by the French during reconstruction work in 1797. The same decree is written in the hieroglyphic, demotic, and Greek scripts. The importance of these texts for the decipherment of the Egyptian scripts was immediately realized, and copies were sent to Paris, where the stone was to be shipped. Following the surrender of French forces in 1801, however, the Rosetta Stone was given, with Turkish approval, to the British by the Treaty of Alexandria and assigned to the British Museum in 1802. Decipherment of the hieroglyphic writing proved difficult and centered on the royal names in cartouches. The major breakthrough was made by Jean-François Champollion in 1822, when he recognized the alphabetic and ideogrammatic nature of the hieroglyphic text. The Rosetta Stone has become the symbol of the key that unlocks mysteries. See also YOUNG, THOMAS.
ROYAL CACHES. During Dynasty 21, the royal mummies in the Valley of the Kings whose tombs had been plundered were gathered together and reburied in two separate locations, one group in a cliff tomb near Deir el-Bahri and a second in the tomb of Amenhotep II. The first group was discovered by local residents in the 1870s, who sold some of the equipment, leading to the discovery of the tomb in 1881. The second group was recovered in 1898 from KV35. The mummies include most rulers of Dynasty 18, Dynasty 19, and Dynasty 20, as well as some queens, princes, and princesses of Dynasty 18 and members of the family of the high priest of Amun of Dynasty 21. Most are identified by inscriptions, but it is not absolutely clear that all the identifications made by the priests of Dynasty 21 are correct. Modern attempts to distinguish relationships and ages
ROYAL CACHES • 201



through bone structure or DNA have so far proved inconclusive. The cliff tomb at Deir el-Bahri was reexamined by a German–Russian expedition from 1998–2003.
RUDAMUN (reigned c. 734–731 BC). Throne name Usimaatre setepenamun. Epithet meryamun. Younger son of Osorkon III of Dynasty 23 and successor of his brother, Takelot III. He is attested from a few monuments in Thebes. His daughter married Peftjauawybast, ruler of Herakleopolis. See also THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
–S
SABINA, VIBIA (d. 136/7). Empress of Rome. Wife of Hadrian and daughter of Lucius Vibius Sabinus and Matidia, niece of the previous ruler Trajan. She accompanied her husband on his many travels and visited Egypt in 130 AD when she went with her husband to view the Colossi of Memnon. The visit is recorded by her attendant, Julia Balbilla.
SADEH (fl. 2020 BC). A minor wife of Mentuhotep II of Dynasty 11. She was commemorated in a chapel and buried in a pit tomb at his funerary complex at Deir el-Bahri discovered during Henri Edouard Naville’s excavations at the site. See also ASHAYET; HENHENET; KAWIT; KEMSIT; MYT; NEFRU; TEM.
SAFT EL-HENNA. Modern name for the site of Pr-Spdw, located southeast of Bubastis in the eastern Delta of Lower Egypt at the beginning of the Wadi Tumilat. The remains date from the Late Period to the Graeco-Roman Period. It was excavated by Henri Edouard Naville from 1884–1885, and its cemetery was examined by Flinders Petrie in 1906. During the 1980s, it was surveyed by a team from the University of Liverpool, and it has been under excavation by an Italian expedition since 1988.
SAHURE (reigned c. 2487–2475 BC). Second ruler of Dynasty 5. According to the later Westcar Papyrus, he was a brother of his pred

ecessor, Userkaf, but he was more likely his son. He continued the policy of sun worship, constructing his own sun temple and a pyramid and temple complex at Abusir. The reliefs from the temple depict a trade expedition, probably to Lebanon. The area was excavated by the German Ludwig Borchardt from 1907–1908. Sahure’s only known queen was Meretnebty. See also NEFERIRKARE.
SAIS. Greek name for the Egyptian town Sau, modern Sa el-Hagar, on the east bank of the Rosetta branch of the Nile. Capital of the fifth nome of Lower Egypt. The chief deity of the town was the goddess Neith. The town gained prominence during the Third Intermediate Period, when it was ruled by local princes, one of whom, Nekau I, was installed by the Assyrians as ruler of Egypt and founded Dynasty 26. The city became the capital of Egypt at the time, but very little remains of the site today. Sais has never been properly excavated by archaeologists. In 1997, the Egypt Exploration Society began a survey of the area and found remains from the Prehistoric Period to the Roman Period with some notable gaps in the time sequence.
SAITE PERIOD (664–525 BC). A term used to describe the rule of Dynasty 26 from Sais. It marked the last dynastic period of Egypt’s greatness with political reunification of the country, revival in art that had begun during Dynasty 25 combining styles from the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom in deliberate archaisms, and Egyptian intervention in Nubia and Palestine.
SAKHMET. Egyptian goddess. Daughter of the sun god Re and wife of the god Ptah of Memphis. She is usually depicted as a lionessheaded human figure. She was regarded as fierce and bloodthirsty and a destroyer of the king’s enemies, but she also had a healing aspect. In Thebes she was identified with the goddess Mut, and her statues were erected in the temple of Mut in the city. See also RELIGION.
SALITIS. Greek name given by the Hebrew historian Josephus, who derived it from Manetho for the first Hyksos ruler of Dynasty 15. The Austrian expedition at Avaris recently discovered a fragmentary inscription with part of a royal titulary of King Seker-Hor, who may

well be identifiable with the first Hyksos ruler. See also APEPI; IANNAS; KHAYAN.
SALT, HENRY (1780–1827). British artist and diplomat. He was born in Lichfield, England, on 14 June 1780 and trained as an artist. He accompanied George Annesley, viscount valentia, as his secretary on a tour of the East, including Egypt, Ethiopia, and India from 1802–1806. He was sent on a mission to Ethiopia from 1809–1811. In 1815, he was appointed British consul general in Egypt, arriving there in 1816. Salt showed great interest in Egyptian antiquities and employed Giovanni Battista Belzoni and other agents to form a collection while the French consul, Bernardino Drovetti, was doing likewise. Salt also helped direct excavations at Giza and Thebes. He sold his first collection to the British Museum in 1823 after some haggling, apart from the sarcophagus of Sety I, which went to Sir John Soane’s Museum in London. His second collection went to the Louvre Museum in 1826, and his third was sold at auction in 1835. He died at Desuke near Alexandria on 30 October 1827.
SANAKHTE (reigned c. 2640–2638 BC). Horus name of a king of Dynasty 3 whose personal name is uncertain, possibly Nebka. He is known from a relief from Sinai, but his order in the dynasty is unclear. He is generally stated to be the first king, but it is probable that he was a later successor rather than a predecessor of Djoser.
SAQQARA. Modern name for the main necropolis of ancient Memphis in use from Dynasty 1 to the Roman Period. The area contains the tombs of the high officials of the Early Dynastic Period; the step pyramids of Dynasty 3, notably the pyramid complex of Djoser; the tomb of Shepseskaf of Dynasty 4; three pyramids of Dynasty 5, including that of Unas with the first inscribed pyramid texts; the pyramids of Dynasty 6; many private tombs from all periods; and the Serapeum, the burial place of the Apis bull. The area has been under continuous excavation since the late 19th century, and recent discoveries by Egyptian, British, and French excavators include the late Dynasty 18 and Ramesside Period cemeteries, notably the tombs of Horemheb as a commoner and the vizier Aperel.
204 • SALT, HENRY



SARAPIS. Egyptian god prominent during the Graeco-Roman Period. The name seems to have been derived from Osiris Apis, the deceased form of the Apis bull worshipped at Memphis. The deity was adopted by Ptolemy I and depicted with Greek features as a bearded man similar to the Greek god Zeus but with attributes derived from other Greek gods, like Dionysius and Aesculapius. Sarapis was promoted to the head of the Egyptian pantheon and considered the husband of Isis. He was regarded as a god of fertility and healing.
SARCOPHAGUS. The term used by Egyptologists to denote the stone coffins used in the burials of members of the royal family and high officials that contained the wooden coffin or coffins in which the mummy of the deceased rested. These first appeared during the Old Kingdom and were rectangular in shape, being plain or decorated on the outside with a palace facade or serekh motif. In some cases, the name and titles of the deceased were inscribed on the inside or outside. More lengthy inscribed prayers and decorations were in evidence from the Middle Kingdom. During the New Kingdom, anthropoid sarcophagi came into use with texts on the inside and outside. The sky goddess Nut was often depicted on the inside, especially in sarcophagi from the Late Period and Graeco-Roman Period. The term sarcophagus has also been loosely used to refer to wooden or cartonnage coffins, but it is now generally restricted to those made of stone. See also RISHI COFFIN; TOMB.
SATIRE ON TRADES, THE. A literary work composed by Khety during the Middle Kingdom. It purports to be his advice as a father to his son on the choice of profession. It points out the drawbacks to all professions, except that of scribe, of which it extols its virtues. See also LITERATURE.
SATIS. Consort of the god Khnum of Elephantine. She is depicted as a human female figure with a white crown with horns. She was principally worshipped at Elephantine and in Nubia. See also ANUKIS; RELIGION.
SATRAP. The Persian term for governor of a province. The Persian satraps of Egypt were generally members of the royal family or

nobility. The last Persian satrap surrendered to Alexander the Great, upon whose death the Macedonian general, Ptolemy, became the last satrap, as he eventually took the title of king. See also ACHAEMENES; ARSAMES.
SCARAB. Modern name for the dung beetle that was regarded as sacred by the ancient Egyptians as, according to one perception, the sun was pushed through the sky by a celestial beetle. The ancient Egyptian name for the beetle was kheper. The scarab was a popular form of amulet usually made of steatite and then glazed and pierced vertically to fit on necklaces or rings. The underside could carry a prayer or name when used as a seal. The larger heart scarab was unpierced and made of hard stone, like schist. It was placed over the heart of the mummy, as the underside carried a spell to enable the heart to act favorably toward the deceased during the weighing of the heart ceremony. Winged and smaller scarabs all made of faience were also placed amid the wrappings of the mummy. See also KHEPRI.
SCORPION (reigned c. 3200 BC). A major king of Dynasty 0 whose name is uncertain but was written as a scorpion hieroglyph. He reigned in Upper Egypt but is attested from an inscription in Nubia. His principal monument is a decorated macehead found at Hierakonpolis. He was buried at Abydos, and his tomb has recently been excavated by a German expedition.
SCRIBE. Ancient Egyptian Sesh. The title designates a literate man as well as a profession. The scribe was the essential backbone of the Egyptian administration and was essential for the the country to run smoothly. The range of tasks of a scribe varied from humble village scribes to key members of the elite. While general education was limited, scribal schools were believed to be attached to the temples and the court, although many scribes would have learned their skill from their fathers or relatives. It was rare but not impossible for a member of the nonscribal classes to join their ranks. Many high officials style themselves scribe to indicate their literacy, although presumably they left the writing of administrative documents to their underlings. The scribes tended to regard themselves as superior to the bulk of the population, as reflected in the The Satire on Trades.

SEA PEOPLES. A term used by the Egyptians for a group of allied foreign peoples who threatened Egypt from the middle of Dynasty 19 until the beginning of Dynasty 20. They first appeared as an entity in year 5 of Merenptah when, allied with the Libyans, they invaded Egypt but were driven back and defeated. The Sea Peoples are described as Ekwesh, Lukka, Shekelesh, and Sherden, some of whom had been noted separately in Egyptian texts from late Dynasty 18. The Sea Peoples returned in year 8 of Ramesses III after, according to the Egyptians, destroying the Hittite empire and several Syrian centers, including Ugarit. Their coalition was now described as Denen, Peleset, Shekelesh, Sherden, Tjekker, Teresh, and Weshwesh. Ramesses III claimed to have defeated and pushed them back from Egypt. The intention of the Sea Peoples was to settle in newly occupied lands, as they were accompanied by their families and possessions. Ramesses III stated that he agreed to the defeated forces settling along the Levantine coast in what was then the Egyptian empire, although he may have been obliged to do so since they could not be expelled. The Tjekker are later recorded there during late Dynasty 20, and the Peleset, later known as the Philistines, also settled on the coast. The origin of the Sea Peoples in unclear, but they may have originated in Asia Minor or the northern Aegean. Some groups may have migrated elsewhere, from Sherden to Sardinia, but this is speculative. See also WARFARE.
SEBENNYTOS. Greek name for the ancient Egyptian town of Tjebnetjer, capital of the 12th nome of Lower Egypt. Modern Samanud on the west bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile. The main temple was dedicated to the god Onuris (Anhur)-Shu and his wife, Mehit. Although some objects from the Old Kingdom to New Kingdom have been found in the vicinity, no remains have been found onsite earlier than Dynasty 30, whose royal family is stated to have come from Sebennytos, but the area has not yet been thoroughly excavated. The town remained prominent during the Graeco-Roman Period, its most famous citizen being the historian Manetho. It was surveyed by a British expedition from 1998–1999.
SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (c. 1795–1550 BC). The term used by Egyptologists to designate the period between the end of

Dynasty 12 or, according to some, the middle of Dynasty 13 until the accession of Dynasty 18. During this period, the kingship was weak and divided, and Egypt was occupied by the Hyksos until they were driven out by the princes of Thebes.
SEDMENT. The modern name for a cemetery site northwest of Herakleopolis consisting of cliff tombs and desert burials. The tombs date from the Early Dynastic Period to the Graeco-Roman Period, including important official tombs from Dynasty 19. The site was excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1920–1921.
SEKER-HOR. See SALITIS.
SEKHEMKHET (reigned c. 2667–2648 BC). Horus name of a king of Dynasty 3 and probable successor to Djoser. His personal name is uncertain, possibly Djoser Teti. His unfinished pyramid at Saqqara was excavated between 1951 and 1954 by Zakaria Goneim, an Egyptian archaeologist, but Sekhemkhet’s closed sarcophagus was found empty. His successor is uncertain. See also HUNI.
SEMERKHET (reigned c. 2915 BC). Seventh ruler of Dynasty 1 and successor of Anedjib. He was buried in an elaborate tomb at Abydos, but little is known of his reign, which may have been a time of unrest.
SEMNA. Modern name for a site in Nubia near the Second Cataract of the Nile where a fortress, temple, and settlement were erected during Dynasty 12 on the west bank, probably begun under Senusret I and completed under Senusret III, after who it was named SekhemKhakaure. Nearby was a second fort, now known as Semna South, ancient Egyptian Dair Seti. Semna marked the limit of Egyptian control during the Middle Kingdom. The site was excavated by George Reisner from 1924–1928 and again during the 1960s. The area is now flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake formed by the Aswan High Dam, but part of the temple was removed to safety. See also ANIBA; ASKUT; BUHEN; KUMMA; MIRGISSA; SHALFAK; URONARTI.

SENENMUT (fl. 1479–1455 BC). High official during the reign of Queen Hatshepsut. Son of Ramose and Hatnefer of apparently humble origin. He held the office of chief steward and tutor of Princess Nefrure. He was in charge of the queen’s building works, notably at Deir el-Bahri. Numerous statues of him survive, most badly damaged, although it is not certain when the damage occurred. There has been much speculation about his relationship with the queen. He may have fallen into disgrace before the end of the reign. No family of his is known. His major tomb at Deir el-Bahri was never completed and is defaced. See also THUTMOSE III.
SENNEDJEM (fl. 1280 BC). Workman in the community of royal tomb builders at Deir el-Medina. Son of Khabekhnet and Tahenen. He served in the workforce probably during the reign of Sety I and the early part of that of Ramesses II during Dynasty 19. His tomb (number 1) was discovered intact in 1886, including several mummies of his immediate family along with their burial equipment. Most of the material is now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum, but some has been dispersed to other institutions. The painted plaster scenes in his tomb are well preserved and remarkable for their vividness. See also HESUNEBEF; KENHERKHEPESHEF; KHA; PANEB; RAMOSE.
SENNEFER (fl. 1400 BC). Mayor of Thebes under Amenhotep II. He was the owner of the well-preserved Theban tomb (number 96), which includes scenes of his family and is noted for its grapevine decoration.
SENUSRET I (reigned c. 1965–1920 BC). Throne name Kheperkare. Son of Amenemhat I, founder of Dynasty 12. He was named coregent with his father c. 1965 BC to secure the new dynasty and succeeded to sole rule following his father’s assassination about 1955 BC. The circumstances are mentioned in the tale of Sinuhe, but the motive for the assassination and the means by which the conspiracy was crushed remain unclear. Senusret I maintained the policy of expansion in Nubia. His reign appears to have fostered literary composition, as evidenced by the production of the story of Sinuhe, the Prophecy of Neferti, and the wisdom text The Instruction of Amenemhat

I. An important example of his construction work at Karnak has survived in the form of a kiosk with intricately carved hieroglyphs. He also erected a pair of obelisks in the temple at Heliopolis, of which one survives. He was buried in a pyramid complex at Lisht, which was excavated by the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1908–1934 and 1984–1989. His principal wife was his sister, Nefru, and he was succeeded by his son, Amenemhat II.
SENUSRET II (reigned c. 1880–1874 BC). Throne name Khakheperre. Son of Amenemhat II. He continued the expansionist policy of Dynasty 12 with trade relations recorded with Palestine. He was buried at Lahun in the Fayum. His principal wife was Queen Khenemet-nefer-hedjet, and he was succeeded by his son, Senusret III.
SENUSRET III (reigned c. 1874–1855 BC). Throne name Khakaure. Son of Senusret II and Khenemet-nefer-hedjet. He undertook military expeditions in Nubia, where he strengthened Egyptian fortresses and attacked the town of Shechem in Palestine. He is credited with eliminating the provincial nomarchs who are last attested in his reign. Senusret III was buried in a pyramid at Dahshur, which was recently excavated by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. His military activities were later confused with those of Ramesses II to form the deeds of conquest of a mythical King Sesostris. His principal wife was Khenemet-nefer-hedjet the younger. See also WARFARE.
SEPTIMIUS SEVERUS (145–211 AD). Roman emperor. Full name Lucius Septimius Severus, son of Publius Septimius Geta and Fulvia Pia. He was born in Leptis Magna, Libya, around 145 AD. He had a successful military and senatorial career, finally occupying the post of governor of Pannonia. Severus was proclaimed emperor in 193 AD and eventually defeated his rivals in the eastern and western parts of the Roman Empire. He visited Egypt from 199–201 AD, granting Alexandria and other major cities municipal councils and ordering new building work in Alexandria and the restoration of one of the Colossi of Memnon, which was alleged to sing but did so no more after this work. The imperial family is depicted on a relief from the temple of Esna, although the image of the younger son was later

erased. He also admited Egyptians into the Roman senate, although the first Egyptian senator was not appointed until 212 AD. Severus died in York on 4 February 211 AD and was succeeded by his son, Caracalla.
SERABIT EL-KHADIM. Site in the Sinai used as a quarry for turquoise beginning in the Middle Kingdom, largely replacing Wadi Maghara, and also the location of a temple dedicated to Hathor, lady of turquoise, where many texts dedicated by the leaders of mining expeditions have been found. The site was first excavated by Major Charles Macdonald in the 1860s, Flinders Petrie from 1904–1905, and a French expedition from 1993–1996. See also HATNUB; MONS CLAUDIANUS; MONS PORPHYRITES; WADI EL-HUDI; WADI HAMMAMAT; WADI MAGHARA.
SERAPEUM. Greek name for the catacombs of the sacred Apis bull at Saqqara. The underground vault contained separate chambers for each burial in a massive sarcophagus, and on the walls were attached stelae of the workmen involved in the burials. The Serapeum was discovered by Auguste Mariette in 1851, but the continuous sequence of burials has only been traced from the Third Intermediate Period to the Ptolemaic Period, although a few isolated earlier burials have been located. Prince Khaemwese, son of Ramesses II, may have been buried here. See also MEMPHIS.

SETEPENRE (fl. 1336 BC). Sixth daughter of Akhenaten and Nefertiti. She is named in tomb reliefs from Amarna. She may be one of two princesses who appear on a painted fresco now in the Ashmolean Museum of Art and Archaeology in Oxford, United Kingdom. Her fate is unknown.

SETH. Egyptian god of thunder and the desert. Son of Geb and Nut. Brother of Osiris, Isis, and Nephthys. According to Egyptian legend, he murdered his brother, Osiris, in order to claim the crown of Egypt but was thwarted by Isis and her son, Horus. He was therefore regarded as an evil god and abominated in most parts of Egypt, although he was still worshipped in areas of the Delta. He was identified with the Syrian god Baal and hence associated with the Hyksos. In another myth, he appears as a protector of the sun god Re. See also RELIGION.
SETHHERKHEPESHEF. The name of several royal princes in Dynasty 19 and Dynasty 20. The first known was a son of Ramesses II, but it appears that this name was merely an alternate name of Prince Amenherkhepeshef. The tomb (number 43) of Sethherkhepeshef (fl. c. 1185 BC), son of Ramesses III, is located in the Valley of the Queens, and it appears from his depiction that he died as a child. A second Prince Sethherkhepeshef succeeded as Ramesses VIII and may well have been a younger son of Ramesses III of the same name.
SETHNAKHTE (reigned c. 1189–1184 BC). Throne name Userkhaure. Founder of Dynasty 20 of unknown origin. He overthrew the rule of Tewosret and claimed to have restored the land from the chaos that Bay had left when he fled the country. A recently discovered stela in Luxor is dated to his year 4, indicating that he reigned at least three full years. He was succeeded by his son, Ramesses III. He was

buried in tomb KV14 in the Valley of the Kings, which he had taken over from Tewosret. His body may have been found in the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898.
SETY (fl. 1279–1230 BC). Ninth son of Ramesses II. He appears in inscriptions during the early part of his father’s reign. He was buried in tomb KV5 in the Valley of the Kings, where some of his canopic equipment was discovered. See also AMENHERKHEPESHEF; KHAEMWESE; MERENPTAH; MERYATUM; PREHERWENEMEF; SETY.
SETY I (reigned c. 1294–1279 BC). Throne name Menmare. Son of Ramesses I and Sitre. Second ruler of Dynasty 19. He pursued a vigorous policy of reestablishing Egyptian control in Palestine and Syria. At home he undertook important construction works, notably the temple at Abydos with a detailed king list and his finely painted tomb (KV17) in the Valley of the Kings discovered in 1817. He established his son, Ramesses II, as his coregent. His mummy was recovered in the royal cache at Deir el-Bahri in 1881. His mortuary temple at Qurna on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes is well preserved and has been recently excavated, recorded, and restored by a German expedition from 1970–1984 and after flood damage from 1995–2000.
SETY II (reigned c. 1202–1196 BC). Throne name Userkheprure. Son of Merenptah of Dynasty 19. His claim to the throne was challenged by Amenmesse, and he only established himself after a civil war that weakened the dynasty. After a short reign, Sety II was followed by his son, Siptah, although power remained in the hands of his widow, Tewosret, and Bay. He was buried in tomb KV15 in the Valley of the Kings, and his body was recovered from the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898.

SEX. Unlike some Semitic peoples of the Near East, the ancient Egyptians had a rather relaxed view of sex and sexuality. While wisdom literature advised moderation in sexual life and also in drinking, sex
SEX • 213



was regarded as a natural and enjoyable part of the human condition. Men were certainly not expected to be monogamous in marriage, although discretion for the sake of the family in regard to other relationships was preferable. Women were expected to be faithful if married, but if not, divorce was available for the husband if he wished, and adultery was not normally treated as a major offense in ordinary life despite the fact that in literature faithless wives always suffer misfortune. Independent women could behave as they chose, as in the Tale of Truth and Falsehood. The repeated allegations of “rape” at Deir el-Medina imply that sexual relationships between individuals, whether married or unmarried, were not uncommon. Homosexuality is also mentioned in some texts, and it is clear that sexual relationships between men were regarded as abnormal but not of any great concern of the state or other individuals. It was the passive partner, who played the part of a woman, who was viewed with greater contempt. The Egyptians believed that sexual practices were the concern of the individuals themselves and were of no interest to the community unless sexual jealousy happened to arouse tensions that required the interference of the authorities.
SHABAQO (reigned c. 720–706 BC). Throne name Neferkare. Son of Kashta and successor of Piye. Nubian ruler who conquered Egypt around 720 BC, executing Bakenrenef of Dynasty 24 and establishing Dynasty 25. He maintained good relations with Assyria, whose empire had spread to the Egyptian border. He was buried in a pyramid tomb at el-Kurru in Nubia. He was succeeded by Shebitqo, whose relationship to him is uncertain.
SHABTI. The earliest royal burials of Dynasty 1 and Dynasty 2 were surrounded by the graves of royal retainers who had been sacrificed to accompany their master as servants in the next life. This practice was eventually abandoned, and models of servants appear in tombs in the Old Kingdom and Middle Kingdom. The deceased was expected to perform some manual activities in the afterlife, so from the late Middle Kingdom to the Ptolemaic Period burials included shabtis, or servant figures, with inscriptions naming the deceased and obliging the figure to carry out any work demanded of him or her.
214 • SHABAQO



Elaborate burials had 365 shabtis, 1 for each day of the year plus overseer shabtis for every 10 worker figures. The figures would be placed in shabti boxes in the tomb.
SHAI. Egyptian god of fate. He is represented as a human figure. See also RELIGION.
SHALFAK. Modern name for the site of a fortress in the Second Cataract region of the Nile in Nubia probably built by Senusret III. Ancient Egyptian Waf Khasut. See also ANIBA; ASKUT; BUHEN; KUMMA; MIRGISSA; SEMNA; URONARTI.
SHANHUR. Modern name for a site in Upper Egypt south of Coptos where a temple to Isis built during the Roman Period is located. It has been investigated by a Belgian expedition since 1992.
SHARUNA. See KOM EL-AHMAR SAWARIS.
SHEBITQO (reigned c. 706–690 BC). Throne name Djedkaure. Successor of Shabaqo of Dynasty 25. He faced mounting pressure from the expanding Assyrian empire and supported a rebellion of the Palestinian states against Assyrian domination. Egyptian forces under the command of Taharqo were defeated at Eltekeh in 701 BC, and Assyria remained a constant threat. He was buried at el-Kurru in Nubia. See also WARFARE.
SHENOUTE (d. c. 466 AD). Coptic abbot of the White Monastery near modern Sohag. He was born in the village of Shenalolet near Akhmim and entered the White Monastery in 371, where he served as a monk and later succeeded his uncle, Pjol, the founder of the monastery, as head of the community. His rule was quite strict and harsher than that of Pachomius, and Shenoute introduced a written profession of obedience. He was a staunch opponent of paganism and encouraged the destruction of pagan monuments. In 431, he took part in the Council of Ephesus with the patriarch Cyril. Many of his literary compositions, all on religious subjects, have survived, and he is regarded as the most original author of the Coptic Period. See also ABRAHAM; ANTHONY; COPTIC CHURCH.
SHENOUTE • 215



SHEPENWEPET. The name of two princesses who succeeded as God’s wife of Amun. Shepenwepet I, daughter of Osorkon III of Dynasty 23, and Karoatjet held office until the advent of the Nubian Dynasty 25, when she was obliged to adopt Amenirdis I, daughter of Kashta, as her heir. Shepenwepet II, daughter of Piye, succeeded Amenirdis I and adopted Amenirdis II, daughter of Taharqo, but in 656 BC she was obliged to adopt Nitocris, daughter of Psamtik I of Dynasty 26, who had ousted her family from power.
SHEPSEKARE (reigned c. 2455–2448 BC). Obscure monarch of Dynasty 5. He appears to have been either the predecessor or the successor of Raneferef, but no details are known about his reign.
SHEPSESKAF (reigned c. 2503–2498 BC). Ruler of Dynasty 4. Successor and possibly son of Menkaure. The waning power of the monarch is demonstrated by his failure to build a pyramid. He was buried in a large mastaba tomb near Saqqara.
SHESHI. Throne name Maaibre. Ruler of the Second Intermediate Period attested on many scarabs. He is generally considered to be a member of the Hyksos Dynasty 15 but may well belong to Dynasty 14.
SHESHONQ I (reigned c. 945–924 BC). Throne name Hedjkheperre setepenre. Epithet meryamun. Founder of Dynasty 22B. Son of the Libyan chieftain Nimlot and his wife, Tentsepeh, and nephew of King Osorkon the Elder. He succeeded to the throne despite opposition in Thebes and reestablished Egyptian prestige with a campaign in Palestine, being mentioned in the Bible as Shishak. A statue of him has been discovered at Byblos. Sheshonq I described his campaign on a victory relief carved in the temple of Karnak. He placed his sons in strategic positions, such as that of high priest of Amun, to strengthen his rule. See also WARFARE.
SHESHONQ II (reigned c. 890 BC). Throne name Heqakheperre setepenre. Epithet meryamun. Ephemeral monarch of Dynasty 22 who is known from his burial at Tanis in the tomb of Pasebakhaenniut I.
216 • SHEPENWEPET



He is usually identified with Prince Sheshonq, son of Osorkon I, and Maatkare, daughter of Pasebakhaenniut II of Dynasty 21, but he appears never to have reigned alone, only as coregent with his father.
SHESHONQ III (reigned c. 825–785 BC). Throne name Usermaatre setepenre or setepenamun. Epithet meryamun si-bast netjer heka iunu. Successor of Takelot II of Dynasty 22. It appears that during his reign the unity of Egypt was broken and a rival line of rulers was established as Dynasty 23, beginning with Pedubast I. Sheshonq III carried out building works at Tanis with material brought from PiRamesses. His intact tomb at Tanis was discovered in 1939. A King Usimaatre meryamun Sheshonq is known to have lived during this time in Thebes, and his name may be a variant of Sheshonq’s title or a separate king now to be known as Sheshonq VI. Sheshonq III may have been succeeded by Sheshonq IV.
SHESHONQ IV (reigned c. 785–773 BC). Throne name Hedjkheperre setepenre or setepenamun. Epithet meryamun si-bast netjer heka iunu. An obscure ruler whose existence has only recently been acknowledged. It is likely that he was a successor to Sheshonq III.
SHESHONQ V (reigned c. 767–730 BC). Throne name Akheperre setepenre. Epithet meryamun si-bast netjer heka waset. Son and successor of Pimay. His control appears to have been restricted to the Delta area. He celebrated his jubilee and carried out building works at Tanis but is otherwise little known. See also OSORKON IV.
SHIPWRECKED SAILOR. A literary tale from the Middle Kingdom known from one manuscript. It describes the adventures of a sailor shipwrecked on a mysterious island where he meets a magical serpent. See also LITERATURE.
SHU. Egyptian god of the air and sunlight. According to the creation myth from Heliopolis, he was created by Atum, and by his union with Tefnut, goddess of moisture, he produced Geb and Nut. He is depicted in human form as a kneeling man with upraised arms and a sun disk on his head or as a lion. See also RELIGION.
SHU • 217



SIAMUN (reigned c. 978–950 BC). Throne name Netjerkheperre. Penultimate king of Dynasty 21. Successor of Osorkon the Elder but of unknown origin. Little is known about his reign. He may have undertaken a campaign against Gezer in Palestine, but his identification with the unnamed ruler who took the city mentioned in the Bible is speculative. See also SHESHONQ I.
SICARD, CLAUDE (1677–1726). French priest. He was born in Aubagne, France, on 4 May 1677. He went to the Levant as a missionary and settled in Cairo in 1712. He made numerous exploratory journeys throughout the country and became the first known European to visit Upper Egypt, including the Valley of the Kings and Aswan in 1721 in the company of another priest, Pietro Lorenzo Pincia. His surviving papers were not completely published until 1982, and Pincia’s account only appeared in 1998. He died in Cairo on 12 April 1726.
SIHATHOR (fl. 1730 BC). A possible minor ruler of Dynasty 13. Son of the God’s father Haankhef and probably the lady Kemi. According to the Turin Royal Canon, he succeeded his brother, Neferhotep I, but his reign was brief, and he was followed by his brother, Sobekhotep IV. However, contemporary monuments only describe him as a royal prince, and he may have predeceased his elder brother and never reigned. The attribution of the throne name Menwadjre is dubious. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
SILVER. A precious metal not widely available in Egypt in its purest form, thus it had to be imported. It is attested beginning in the Old Kingdom in the royal burial of Queen Hetepheres of Dynasty 4 and in the Middle Kingdom in the Tod treasure. It was used in the funerary equipment of the royal burials at Tanis of Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22. According to Egyptian myth, the bones of the gods were made of silver. See also BRONZE; COPPER; GOLD; IRON.
SINUHE. Hero of a Middle Kingdom story set during the reign of Senusret I. Sinuhe flees the country upon hearing of the assassination of the king’s father, Amenemhat I, and the story outlines his adventures in the Palestine region. In old age, he longs to return to

Egypt and is pardoned and welcomed back by the king. The story reflects the strong attachment of Egyptians to their homeland. It is already attested at the end of the Middle Kingdom and was extremely popular during the New Kingdom, from which time many copies survive. See also LITERATURE.
SIPTAH (reigned c. 1196–1190 BC). Throne name Akhenre. Probably son of Sety II of Dynasty 19. He was proclaimed king with the help of Bay when he was still a child, but he died after a short reign. His mummy reveals that he suffered from a clubfoot. Nothing is known of the internal politics of his reign, but it has recently been revealed that Bay was executed in 1189 BC, presumably after a power struggle at court. The king died the next year. He was succeeded by his probable stepmother, Tewosret. He was buried in tomb KV47 in the Valley of the Kings, discovered in 1905, and his body was recovered from the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898. His mortuary temple at Thebes has not been preserved, but foundation deposits have been recovered. The site was excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1896.
SISTRUM. A musical instrument usually made of bronze consisting of a vertical handle with an open curved frame above. Bronze rods are attached across the frame, and small bronze roundels are threaded on the rods that produce sound when shaken. The instrument is depicted being shaken by priestesses at religious ceremonies.
SITAMUN (fl. 1525 BC). Egyptian princess. Probably daughter of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. She is attested in the reign of her father with the title God’s Wife and appears to have survived into the reign of her brother Amenhotep I. See also AHMOSE-SIPAIR; MERITAMUN.
SITAMUN (fl. 1355 BC). Egyptian princess. Daughter of Amenhotep III and Tiy. An item of furniture inscribed with her name was found in the tomb of Yuya, Tiy’s father. She was given the title of queen on inscriptions from her father’s reign and so probably married him, but her subsequent fate is not known. See also AKHENATEN; BAKETATEN.
SITAMUN • 219



SITHATHORIUNET (fl. 1875 BC). A princess of Dynasty 12. Probable daughter of Senusret II. Her tomb was discovered near her father’s pyramid at Lahun and contained a large of collection of jewelry now housed in the Cairo Egyptian Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
SITIAH (fl. 1460 BC). Wife of Thutmose III and daughter of the royal nurse Ipu. She is depicted in Thutmose III’s tomb (KV34) in the Valley of the Kings and presumably succeeded Nefrure as a royal wife. See also MERYETRE HATSHEPSUT; NEBTU.
SITRE (fl. 1290 BC). Queen of Ramesses I of Dynasty 19 and mother of Sety I. Her origin is unknown. She was buried in QV38 in the Valley of the Queens.
SIWA OASIS. An oasis in the northern part of the Western Desert just east of the present Libyan border. There is no direct evidence for Egyptian control until Dynasty 26, when the famous temple to Amun was built, although this does not preclude earlier Egyptian influence. The oracle of the temple became well known in the classical world. Cambyses was alleged to have tried and failed to conquer the oasis. The oracle was consulted by Alexander the Great and was believed to have confirmed his divine origin. There are a number of tombs probably from the Late Period and the Graeco-Roman Period, notably the tomb of Siamun, who is depicted in Greek fashion. A German expedition has been working there since 1993. See also BAHARIYA OASIS; DAKHLA OASIS; FARFARA OASIS; KHARGA OASIS.
SLAVERY. Slavery played a minor role in ancient Egypt, contrary to modern expectations. There was no large-scale exploitation of slavery. Most slaves were acquired as booty in war or to a lesser extent from the sale of criminals or debtors. Most slaves were used in a domestic context as local servants, although they may have been employed in certain industrial concerns, for example as slave women used for the preparation of textiles. Slaves seem to have been on the whole well treated and absorbed into the community in due course. There is the example of Hesunebef, who was freed by his patron and
220 • SITHATHORIUNET



found a position, and references to slaves who inherited the property of their master or mistress. The Biblical Israelites in Egypt were not technically slaves but were subject to indentured labor, as were all Egyptian subjects. The position of slaves undoubtedly worsened during the Graeco-Roman Period, when classical views on slavery prevailed.
SMATAWYTEFNAKHT (fl. 340–330 BC). A chief priest of Sakhmet from Herakleopolis. Son of the priest of Amun-Re, Djedsmatawyefankh, and Ankhet. He left a long biographical stela discovered in 1765 in Pompeii, Italy, and now housed in the Naples National Archaeological Museum in Italy, in which he mentions his presence in the battle between the Persians and the Greeks, presumably referring to the campaign of Alexander the Great.
SMENKHKARE (reigned c. 1338–1336 BC). Throne name Ankhkheperure. Mysterious and ephemeral ruler at the end of Dynasty 18 who was coregent and successor of Akhenaten. It has been suggested that this ruler was in fact Akhenaten’s widow, Nefertiti, or daughter, Meritamun, or a man who reigned with one of these women, but his existence remains obscure. It has also been suggested that his presumed body found in tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings was in fact that of Akhenaten, although the age of the skeleton renders this theory dubious. See also AY; HOREMHEB; TUTANKHAMUN.
SNEFRU (reigned c. 2615–2592 BC). First king of Dynasty 4 of unknown origin. His mother, Meresankh I, bore the title of queen mother but not queen, so his father is unlikely to have been Huni, last ruler of the previous dynasty. He built possibly three pyramids, two at Dahshur and possibly one at Meidum. Snefru undertook campaigns in Nubia and had trade relations with Lebanon. He was remembered in the later literature as a wise and just monarch. He was succeeded by Khufu, his son by his chief queen, Hetepheres. See also NEFERMAAT; RAHOTEP.
SOBEK. Crocodile god often depicted as a crocodile-headed human figure. His principal places of worship were the Fayum and Kom

Ombo. He was especially popular during the late Middle Kingdom and early Second Intermediate Period, when he is often equated with Re as the god Sobek-Re.
SOBEKEMSAF. The name of two kings of Dynasty 17. The more important was Sobekemsaf II, throne name Sekhemre Shedtawy, of whom several monuments survive, including a colossal statue now housed in the British Museum. He was buried on the western bank of the Nile at Thebes, and his tomb is recorded as being violated in Dynasty 20. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
SOBEKHOTEP. The name of several kings of Dynasty 13, the numbering of whom is not absolutely certain. The most successful appears to have been Sobekhotep III and Sobekhotep IV.
SOBEKHOTEP III (reigned c. 1740 BC). Throne name Sekhemresewadjtawy. Son of the God’s father Mentuhotep and the lady Iuhetibu. He is attested on monuments in Middle Egypt and Upper Egypt and on graffiti near the First Cataract. A papyrus from his reign documents the presence of Asiatic servants in Egypt.
SOBEKHOTEP IV (reigned c. 1730–1722 BC). Throne name Khaneferre. He was a younger son of the God’s father Haankhef and the lady Kemi and succeeded his brothers, Neferhotep I and Sihathor. He is attested on graffiti in the region of Elephantine and the Wadi Hammamat and on monuments in Karnak and Palestine.
SOBEKNAKHT (fl. 1560 BC). Governor of Elkab and possibly Hierakonpolis during Dynasty 17. He is known principally from his tomb, which was partially published in 1896. A vessel inscribed with his name has been found in a tomb at Kerma. A recent reexamination of his burial site discovered an inscription that recounts a raid by invaders from Kush in the vicinity of Elkab and thus explains the presence of the vessel in the Kushite capital as loot.
SOBEKNEFRU (reigned c. 1799–1795 BC). Throne name Sobekkare. Last ruler of Dynasty 12. Daughter of Amenemhat III and possibly wife of her brother, Amenemhat IV. She succeeded to

the throne presumably for lack of male heirs, but her reign was brief, and she was followed by the unstable Dynasty 13 beginning the Second Intermediate Period.
SOCIETY. Ancient Egyptian society consisted of two classes divided by the ability to read and write. The bulk of the population were illiterate peasants engaged in agriculture with a relatively small number of craftsmen who either lived alongside the rural communities or, like workers in faience, glass, or jewelery, were attached to wealthy private or government establishments. The literate population of not more than 5 percent comprised the royal court and the bureaucracy covering civil, priestly, and military. Although it was an Egyptian ideal for a son to follow in his father’s office, the major appointments were the prerogative of the king and the vizier, or high officials, for more minor offices, so posts often did not follow a hereditary line, although the sons of a literate official could find other positions. Thus it is inaccurate to speak of a member of Egyptian nobility. Rather there existed a hereditary bureaucratic class. It would have been difficult to rise from one class to another. Presumably an enterprising farmer who managed to build up a small estate, like Hekanakhte, might become literate or have his children educated so they could join the official class. Similarly the army might prove the vehicle for the acquisition of land and wealth for someone from a peasant background, but such cases appear to be rare. See also MARRIAGE; SEX; SCRIBE; SLAVERY.
SOKAR. Protective god of the necropolis of Memphis. He is usually depicted as a hawk-headed human. As a funerary god, he was often identified with Osiris, but he was also seen as a craftsman and maker of unguents and so identified with Ptah. The composite god PtahSokar-Osiris is attested during the Middle Kingdom but becomes more prominent during the Late Period, when statues dedicated to him become a standard part of funerary equipment. See also RELIGION; REPIT.
SOKNOPAIOU NESOS. Also known as Dime. A town site in the northeastern Fayum. It flourished during the Graeco-Roman Period and was abandoned in the middle of the 3d century AD. The ruins of

the houses, temples, and cemeteries are extant. The main temple is dedicated to the crocodile god Soknopaius. Numbers of papyri have been found here. It was briefly excavated by a British expedition from 1900–1901, a German expedition from 1908–1909, and an American team from the University of Michigan from 1931–1932. Since 2001 it has been investigated by an Italian expedition from the University of Bologna and the University of Lecce.

SOLEB. Modern name for a site in Upper Nubia where a major temple was erected by Amenhotep III dedicated to Amen-Re and the deified king himself as Nebmaatre, lord of Nubia. The site also includes the remains of a town and cemeteries. The area was excavated by an Italian-French expedition from 1957–1977. See also ABU SIMBEL; AMADA; BEIT EL-WALI; GERF HUSSEIN; KALABSHA.
SONS OF HORUS. The four deities who were associated with the protection of the internal organs removed during the embalming procedure and placed in canopic jars or packages. They were originally represented as human figures, but by the New Kingdom, three of them had acquired animal heads. Imsety, in human form, protected the liver; Hapy, with a baboon head, guarded the lungs; Duamutef, with a jackal head, safeguarded the stomach; and Qebehsenuef, with a hawk head, watched over the intestines. The gods appear as heads on canopic jars and on amulets placed on the mummy. See also RELIGION.

he murdered the queen, who was to be regent for her son, Ptolemy V, and took over power together with the late king’s mistress, Agathoclea, and her brother, Agathocles. Sosibios died in 204 BC. His associates were overthrown and killed in 203 BC, but his son, Sosibios was briefly guardian for the king. See also ARSINOE III; BERENICE II.
SOTHIC CYCLE. See CHRONOLOGY.
SOTHIS. Greek name for the Egyptian astral goddess Sopdet, the personification of the dog-star Sirius, whose time of best visibility marked the beginning of the Nile flood. The goddess is represented as a human female figure with a star on her headdress. See also RELIGION.
SPHINX. Greek name for the human-headed lion depicted in Egyptian art, especially large sculpture. The most famous example is the Great Sphinx at Giza, which was carved from a rocky knoll in the form of King Khafre. This sphinx was later identified with a form of the sun god Harmakhis. In particular, it was venerated and restored by Thutmose IV, who attributed his unexpected succession to its divine intercession. Monumental sphinxes were produced during Dynasty 12, although they were wrongly assigned to the Hyksos by early Egyptologists. The Great Sphinx was first cleared by Giovanni Battista Caviglia in 1817 and subsequently by Auguste Mariette in 1853, Gaston Maspero in 1889, and Eugene Baraize from 1923–1936. It has recently been restored.
ST. MENAS. See MENAS, ST.
STELA. Plural stelae. Greek word used by Egyptologists for a freestanding inscribed stone, often but not necessarily round-topped. A stela can vary in size from several inches to several feet. Most record prayers with dedications to gods on behalf of an individual, often naming members of his family, and they can run to several registers with both inscribed scenes and texts. Historical stelae record the deeds of kings. Some inscriptions on temple walls or cliffs have a surround in imitation of the freestanding stelae.
STELA • 225



STONE. Egypt is rich in a variety of stones used for both construction and art. Stone was first used for construction in Early Dynastic tombs at Saqqara and Abydos. The first fully stone building was the step pyramid of Djoser allegedly designed by Imhotep and built of limestone. Different types of limestone were used in the later pyramids and their associated temples. The finest limestone from the Tura quarries faced the pyramidal structure. Basalt was used for paving stones in the buildings. Granite was also used in the construction of the pyramids. Temples in the north were usually made of limestone, while many in the south were built of sandstone. Limestone could be melted down to make lime during the Roman Period, and as a result, very few temples made of this material survive; however, most domestic buildings and palaces were made of mudbrick rather than stone, so few survive. From the Predynastic Period onward, stone was also used to produce vessels, statues and jewelry. The various types included alabaster, anhydrite, basalt, breccia, gneiss, granodiorite, greywacke, jasper, serpentine, and later porphyry. Amethyst, carnelian, and turquoise were favored for jewelry. Only lapis lazuli appears to have been imported. Many of the quarries used by the Egyptians have been identified and studied. The most notable is the granite quarry at Aswan (Elephantine), but there were alabster and basalt quarries in the Fayum. Other quarries have been located in the Eastern Desert at Serabit el-Khadim and Wadi Maghara for turquoise and in the Western Desert at Gebel el-Asr, northwest of Abu Simbel, for gneiss, which was rediscovered in 1997.

SUCCESSION. The mechanics of the succession to the throne are never indicated in Egyptian sources. It is generally assumed that the eldest son of the king by his queen was the likely successor, but a more ambitious and politically competent son by a minor wife might have proven succesful. This lack of a clear law of succession appears to have led to various harem conspiracies, of which only a few are known. During Dynasty 12, the post of coregent was established whereby the designated successor was crowned as joint king during his father’s lifetime, but even this procedure did not prevent an un

successful attempt to dispose of both Amenemhat I and his coregent, Senusret I, in favor of a rival candidate. During Dynasty 19, the post of crown prince, or iry pct, was created, but this too seems to have lapsed during Dynasty 20. It is a curious fact that royal princes are rarely attested during the reigns of their fathers except during the later period of Egyptian history. See also HAREM CONSPIRACY PAPYRI.
SUPPILULIUMA I (fl. 1370–1322 BC). King of the Hittites. Son of King Tudhaliya III. He seized the throne after a succession dispute and embarked on an aggressive military campaign of expansion defeating Tushratta, king of Mitanni, and severely weakening his kingdom. He expanded into Syria occupying Egyptian territory, including Kadesh, and detaching the kings of Amurru and Ugarit from alliance with Egypt. He is a correspondent in the Amarna letters. An attempt to marry his son, Zannanza, to the queen of Egypt failed and led to increased warfare. He died of the plague c. 1322 BC.
SUPREME COUNCIL FOR ANTIQUITIES. The organization in charge of excavation and preservation of all archaeological sites in Egypt and all museums, including the Cairo Egyptian Museum. It was founded by Auguste Mariette in 1858 as the Egyptian Antiquities Service (Service des Antiquités). It was traditionally run by the French with a few foreign (British and German) curators and inspectors. During the 20th century, the number of locally trained Egyptians gradually increased, and the organization was completely Egyptianized after the revolution of 1952. It is the body that grants foreign expeditions the right to excavate designated sites in Egypt. Formerly foreign excavators were allowed to remove a certain amount of duplicate objects for museums outside Egypt, but this practice has now been suspended, and all finds are kept in Egypt.

TAHARQO (reigned 690–664 BC). Throne name Khunefertemre. Son of Piye and Abar. He was summoned from Nubia after the accession of his relation, Shebitqo, and he commanded his army in Palestine in 701 BC against the Assyrians. He succeeded Shebitqo and undertook extensive building works, especially at Karnak, where he installed his daughter, Amenirdis II, as prospective God’s wife of Amun. He defeated an initial Assyrian invasion but was driven out of Egypt by another invasion in 671 BC, in which his family was captured. He retired to Nubia, where he died in 664 BC and was buried in the royal cemetery at Nuri near Napata. See also TANTAMANI; WARFARE.
TAKELOT I (reigned c. 889–874 BC). Throne name Hedjkheperre. Son of Osorkon I and Tashedkhons. His reign is obscure. He has recently been identified as the king of this name buried at Tanis in the tomb of his son, Osorkon II, whose body was uncovered in 1939 by the French excavator Pierre Montet.
TAKELOT II (reigned c. 850–825 BC). Throne name Hedjkheperre setepenre. Epithet meryamun siese. Successor and probable son of Osorkon II. His reign is badly attested, but his attempt to install his son, Osorkon, as high priest of Amun in Karnak led to prolonged civil strife. See also KAROMAMA.
TAKELOT III (reigned c. 754–734 BC). Throne name Usermaatre setepenamun. Epithet meryamun siese. Son of Osorkon III of Dynasty 23 and Tentsai. He held the title of high priest of Amun before his accession. He is attested on monuments from Thebes. See also RUDAMUN.
TAKHAT (fl. 1270 BC). A royal princess and possible queen. She was the fourteenth daughter of Ramesses II. A later Queen Takhat is shown in possible association with either Sety II or Amenmesse. It has been assumed that she may be the same woman as the princess and the mother of Amenmesse and perhaps even the wife of Sethos II, although these conjectures are debatable.
228 • TAHARQO



TALATAT. Arabic name employed by Egyptologists for the small stone blocks decorated with relief used to build temples by Akhenaten during the Amarna Period. Following the destruction of Akhenaten’s temples, the blocks were reused as filling in temple contruction in Karnak, Hermopolis, Antinoopolis, and other sites and so have been preserved. A talatat block from Hermopolis is the only evidence that Tutankhamun was the son of a king.
TALE OF THE DOOMED PRINCE, THE. A story found in a single manuscript from the Ramesside Period written in the Late Egyptian form of the Egyptian language. The hero is an Egyptian prince doomed from birth to die at the hand of a dog, snake, or crocodile. The tale follows his adventures in Syria, marriage to a local princess, and escape from two of his fates. Unfortunately, the manuscript is lost at the end, but it is probable that he escapes his doom and returns to reign in Egypt. The story has some affinities to modern fairy tales, notably a princess in a tower. See also LITERATURE.
TALE OF THE ELOQUENT PEASANT, THE. A literary tale from the Middle Kingdom that describes the pleadings of the peasant Khunanup for justice at the hands of the Egyptian bureaucracy. His complaints were so eloquently worded that his case was prolonged by officials so they could hear his words until its eventual successful conclusion. See also LITERATURE.
TALE OF THE TWO BROTHERS, THE. A semimythological story found in a single manuscript from the Ramesside Period written in the Late Egyptian form of the Egyptian language. The hero, Bata, is the handsome younger brother of a farmer, Anubis, whose wife attempts to seduce him and when rebuffed accuses him of rape. After proving his innocence to his brother by castrating himself, his brother kills Bata’s wife, and Bata goes off to Syria where the gods provide him with a wife. She too proves faithless and deserts him for the king of Egypt. Bata eventually becomes king of Egypt, punishes his wife, and dies, leaving the throne to his brother. The tale paints a rather bleak picture of women’s motives. See also LITERATURE.
TALE OF TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD, THE. A story found in a single manuscript from the Ramesside Period written in the Late
TALE OF TRUTHAND FALSEHOOD, THE • 229



Egyptian form of the Egyptian language. The hero, Truth, is falsely accused of theft by his jealous brother, Falsehood. Truth is found guilty by a tribunal of the gods and blinded. Falsehood’s attempt to then kill his brother is frustrated, and Truth is vindicated and avenged by his illegitimate son. The story is notable for its admission that the gods are fallible and the depiction of the independent lifestyle of the mother of Truth’s son. See also LITERATURE.
TANIS. Greek name for ancient Egyptian Djane, modern San elHagara, a city in the northeastern part of the Delta in the 19th Egyptian nome of Lower Egypt. It came into prominence during Dynasty 21 as the residence of the royal family founded by Nesbanebdjed, mayor of Tanis. The town was decorated with monuments moved from other sites, like Pi-Ramesses. The town was excavated by Auguste Mariette in the 1860s and Flinders Petrie in 1884. A French expedition worked the site from 1929–1940, 1945–1951, and 1954–1956 under Pierre Montet; worked the area from 1965–1985 under Jean Yoyotte; and has worked the site since 1985 under Philippe Brissaud. In 1939, inside the temple complex dedicated to Amun, Montet found the tombs of the some of the rulers of Dynasty 21 and Dynasty 22.
TANTAMANI (reigned 664–656 BC). Throne name Bakare. Last ruler of Dynasty 25 in Egypt. He succeeded Taharqo and embarked on a reconquest of Egypt, defeating the ruler Nekau I, who was installed by the Assyrians. In 663 BC, the Assyrian army returned and defeated him, marching as far south as Thebes, which was sacked, and appointing Psamtik I as ruler. Tantamani retreated to Nubia but was recognized as ruler in southern Egypt until 657 BC. He died in 656 BC and was buried at el-Kurru. See also MENTUEMHAT; WARFARE.
TAO (reigned c. 1555 BC). Throne name Seqenenre. Penultimate ruler of Dynasty 17 and prince of Thebes. Son of Queen Tetisheri and possibly Senakhtenre. Likely a vassal of the Hyksos, he later led Theban forces against them in the north. A literary tale implies conflict between him and the Hyksos ruler Apepi. His mummy was recovered in the royal cache and shows that he died violently. He is of

TAPOSIRIS MAGNA. A city west of Alexandria between the Mediterranean Sea and Lake Mareotis attested from the Ptolemaic Period to the early Christian Period. Its principal ruins consist of a tower believed to be modeled after the Pharos, or Lighthouse, of Alexandria and a temple dedicated to Isis erected by Ptolemy II and used as a fortress during the Roman Period and later as a monastery. The site was excavated from 1905–1907, 1937–1940, and 1946–1948 through the auspices of the Museum of Alexandria and since 1998 by a Hungarian expedition.
TARKHAN. The site of a major cemetery dating from the Predynastic Period to the Roman Period south of Cairo on the west bank of the Nile near Kafr Ammar in the 21st nome of Upper Egypt. The bulk of the 2,000 tombs date to the foundation of the Egyptian state around 3000 BC. It was excavated by Flinders Petrie from 1911–1913.
TATENEN. Primeval god of the fertility of the enriched soil left by the Nile flood. He was later identified with the god Ptah of Memphis. He is represented as a human figure with plumes and is often painted green. See also RELIGION.
TAWERET. Egyptian goddess. Protector of women during childbirth. She is represented as a pregnant hippopotamus with female breasts and a crocodile tail. Her appearance was supposed to frighten off demons that might harm the pregnant woman or her child. See also RELIGION.
TEBTUNIS. A town of the Ptolemaic Period and Roman Period in the southwest Fayum. Ancient T3-nbt-tn, modern Umm el-Baragat/ Breigat. It flourished from the 4th century BC to the early Arabic Period. The principal god of the town was Soknebtunis, a form of Sobek. It was excavated from 1899–1900 by British papyrologists on

behalf of American heiress Mrs. Phoebe Hearst. Among the objects recovered were papyri and mummy portraits, all now housed in the Robert H. Lowie Museum of Anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. It was later examined by Italian archaeologists from 1929–1935 and has been excavated by a joint Franco–Italian expedition since 1988.

TEFNAKHTE (reigned c. 733–725 BC). Throne name Shepsesre. Prince of Sais. He is named as the main opponent of the Nubian ruler Piye during his invasion of Egypt, although he is not named there as a king. Despite his submission, it appears that Tefnakhte still assumed royal status and was succeeded by his son, Bakenrenef, of Dynasty 24.
TEFNUT. Egyptian goddess of moisture. Created by Atum, she produced Geb and Nut from a union with Shu, the god of air. She can be depicted as a lioness or a lioness-headed human figure. See also RELIGION.
TELL DAFANA. Modern name for a site on the eastern edge of the Delta of Lower Egypt. The remains date from Dynasty 26 to the Graeco-Roman Period. It is likely to be identified with the ancient Daphnae mentioned by Herodotus as a garrison town founded during the Saite Period to guard the frontier routes from the Sinai. Tell Dafna was excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1886.
TELL EL-BALAMUN. Modern name for the site of the northernmost city of Egypt situated near the Mediterranean coast of the northeastern part of the Delta. Egyptian Behdet, later Paiuenamun. Greek Diospolis Parva. The city is attested from the Old Kingdom until the Roman Period and was the capital of the 17th nome of Lower Egypt created during the New Kingdom, although little now remains. The principal gods worshipped here were Horus, lord of Behdet, and later Amun, to whom the main temple was dedicated during the New Kingdom. The site was briefly examined by Howard

Carter in 1913 and an Egyptian expedition from 1977–1978. Since 1991, Tell el-Balamun has been excavated by an expedition from the British Museum, which has traced the outlines of the main temple and subsidiary temples built during the Saite Period until Dynasty 30 and has discovered burials of the Third Intermediate Period within the temple walls.
TELL EL-BORG. A fortress site in the north Sinai east of Tell Hebua. It dates to the New Kingdom and contains a temple and tombs. It was surveyed during the 1990s and excavated by an American expedition beginning in 2000.
TELL EL-FARKHA. Modern name for a town site in the eastern Delta southeast of Mendes. The site contains buildings and graves that date from the Predynastic Period to the early Old Kingdom. It appears to have been founded during the Naqada II period. It has yielded pottery, seal impressions from the Early Dynastic Period, and in 2006 predynastic ivory figurines and decayed wooden statues covered in gold foil with inlaid lapis lazuli eyes from the Early Dynastic Period. Tell el-Farkha was discovered by an Italian expedition in 1987, which worked there until 1990, and since 1998 the site has been excavated by a Polish team. See also ADAIMA; GERZEH; KAFR HASSAN DAOUD; MINSHAT ABU OMAR; TELL IBRAHIM AWAD.
TELL EL-HERR. Modern name for the site of a fortress at the edge of the easten Delta in the 14th nome of Lower Egypt. It guarded the entry route into Egypt from the east. The remains, which include a cemetery, date from the 5th century BC to the 5th century AD, thus from the Late Period to the Graeco-Roman Period. Tell el-Herr has been under excavation by a French expedition since 1985.
TELL EL-MASKHUTA. Modern name for a site excavated by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1883 in the eastern Delta in the middle of the Wadi Tumilat just west of Ismailia. Remains dating from the Second Intermediate Period and the Saite Period to the Roman Period have been found at the site. The city has been identified in the past with ancient Egyptian Pr-Itm, or Pithom, capital of the eighth

nome of Lower Egypt, but this identification is no longer accepted, as Tell er-Rataba is the more likely site. It was excavated by an expedition from the University of Toronto from 1978–1985.
TELL EL-YAHUDIYA. Modern name for a site in the Delta where remains dating from the Middle Kingdom to the Graeco-Roman Period have been excavated. The site has given its name to a form of black pottery juglet decorated with incised designs painted in white that have been found throughout the Levant, although their exact place of manufacture is still unclear. Tell el-Yahudiya was excavated by the Egypt Exploration Fund in 1887 and Flinders Petrie in 1906.
TELL ER-RATABA. Modern name for site on the eastern edge of the Delta in the Wadi Tumilat. Objects found here date from the First Intermediate Period to Dynasty 23. There are the remains of a temple of Ramesses II dedicated to the god Atum. The site is now identified with ancient Egyptian Pr-Itm, or Pithom, capital of the eighth nome of Lower Egypt. Tell er-Rataba was excavated by Henri Edouard Naville in 1894 and Flinders Petrie from 1905–1906.
TELL HEBUA. Modern name for a fortified settlement site on the eastern edge of the Delta of Lower Egypt north of Ismailia. It dates from the Middle Kingdom to the New Kingdom. Inscriptions found there name the Hyksos king Nehesy. The area was excavated by an Egyptian expedition from 1981–1991, and the cemetery area of the New Kingdom has been examined by an Austrian team since 1995.
TELL IBRAHIM AWAD. Modern name for a site in the eastern Delta of Lower Egypt north of Minshat Abu Omar and southeast of Tanis. The remains date from the Naqada II Period of the late Predynastic Period to the Middle Kingdom. The finds include pottery and votive ivories. It has been excavated by a Dutch expedition since 1988. See also ADAIMA; GERZEH; KAFR HASSAN DAOUD; TELL EL-FARKHA.

TEMPLE. The site of worship for a deity or a series of deities located in each Egyptian center. During the New Kingdom and later, a major temple consisted of a pylon in front of an open courtyard followed by a hypostyle or columned hall and then a series of rooms leading to the naos, or sacred shrine, in which the image of the deity was contained. The general public was admitted only to the first courtyard, and only the priests and officials were granted access to the rest of the building. It was believed that for stability to be maintained, the sacred rituals had to be carried out daily. These ceremonies consisted of waking the deity in his or her shrine, clothing the image, and offering food regularly. The image might be carried into the courtyard or out of the temple on festive days on a sacred boat or barque. The temple also contained royal and private statuary, as the king and officials would hope that their names might be read by the priests, thus they would become immortal. Religious worship was not confined to the main temples but also took place more directly between supplicant and deity at various small local shrines. Mortuary temples for deceased rulers were initially associated with the burial site but during the New Kingdom were located some distance away. See also PYRAMID; RELIGION.
TENTAMUN (fl. 1085 BC). Wife of Nesbanebdjed, mayor of Tanis and later first ruler of Dynasty 21. She is mentioned along with her husband in the tale of Wenamun. There is no reason to doubt her identification with Queen Tentamun, daughter of the official Nebseny, thus she did not have a royal pedigree since it has been previously suggested that she might be a daughter of Ramesses XI. Her daughter, Henttawy, apparently married the high priest of Amun Pinudjem I.
TEOS. See DJEDHOR.
TETI (reigned c. 2345–321 BC). Founder of Dynasty 6 and son of Queen Mother Sesheseshet. His origin is unknown, and it is not clear
TETI • 235



how he came to power. He had a long and apparently successful reign. He was buried in a pyramid tomb at Saqqara, which was opened in 1882. Nearby were the tombs of his queens, Iput I, Khuit, and Khentet, whose complete name is lost. The area surrounding his pyramid was excavated by the Egyptian Antiquities Service under Victor Loret in 1893 and from 1897–1899, James Quibell from 1905–1907, and Cecil Firth from 1920–1922. It was also examined during the 1950s and 1960s by a French team, and the Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass has been working there since 1993. See also PEPY I.
TETISHERI (fl. c. 1570–540 BC). Possibly wife of Senakhtenre, the ruler of Thebes during Dynasty 17, and daughter of Tjenna and Nefru. She was the mother of Tao and grandmother of Ahmose I and Ahmose-Nefertari. She possibly acted as regent for her grandson and played a prominent role in his reign. A funerary temple in her honor was founded in Abydos.
TEWOSRET (reigned c. 1190–189 BC). Throne name Sitre. Wife of Sety II and stepmother of his successor, Siptah. She remained a powerful figure at court and may have benefited from the execution of the king’s protector, Bay. Upon the death of the king, she took the throne and counted her regnal years from the death of her husband. She was apparently overthrown by Sethnakhte. She prepared tomb KV14 in the Valley of the Kings for her burial, but it was taken over by Sethnakhte. Her mummy has not been securely identified. Her mortuary temple at Thebes, excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1896, has not been preserved apart from some foundation deposits. In 2006, an American expedition began a reinvestigation of the site.
THEBES. Greek name for the Egyptian city of Waset in the fourth nome of Upper Egypt. Also known as Diospolis Magna. The early history of the city is obscure, but during the First Intermediate Period, its rulers took the royal title. It became the capital of Egypt when Mentuhotep I reunited Egypt under Dynasty 11. While the rulers of Dynasty 12 were southerners, they moved the capital to Itjtawy in the north, although Thebes remained the most important
236 • TETISHERI



city in the south. It regained its prominent position at the end of the Second Intermediate Period when the princes of Thebes led the fight against the Hyksos rulers in the north and reunited Egypt under Dynasty 18. Its god, Amun, was elevated to the position of chief god of Egypt, and his temple at Karnak was enlarged and richly endowed. A second major temple was built at Luxor within the city. The royal tombs from Dynasty 18 to Dynasty 20 were constructed on the west bank of the Nile opposite the city in the Valley of the Kings. The queens, princesses, and some princes were buried in the Valley of the Queens, while the tombs of the officials were located in the nearby cliffs. Also on the west bank near the edge of cultivation such mortuary temples of the kings as Deir el-Bahri, the Ramesseum, and Medinet Habu were constructed.
During Dynasty 19, the king began to reside more frequently in the north, but the city remained the main religious capital and southern administrative center. It was often known simply as niwt, the city. Beginning at the end of Dynasty 20, Thebes and the southern region became increasingly independent of central rule under the high priests of Amun. The city was sacked during the Assyrian invasion of 666 BC and never recovered its prominence. It remained a bastion of Egyptian nationalism during the Ptolemaic Period and was held by various rebel kings. Following the Roman conquest, Thebes became a tourist center. After the adoption of Christianity, its temples were converted into churches or desecrated and abandoned, and it reverted to a minor provincial town after the Arabic conquest. The temples and tombs have been cleared and excavated during modern times, but few remains of the living quarters of the ancient city have been located.
THEODORA (d. 548). Byzantine empress from 527–548. Wife of Justinian. She was the daughter of Acacius, an animal keeper at the circus in Constantinople. After a disreputable youth, she married Justinian, then heir to the throne. She was a strong support to her husband, especially during the riots of 532, which nearly cost him the throne. Theodora was a Monophysite and opposed her husband’s orthodox line. She thus supported the Coptic Church and the rival Monophysite missionary work in Nubia. She died in Constantinople on 28 June 548.
THEODORA • 237



THEOPHILUS (345–412 AD). Patriarch of Alexandria. He was born in Memphis in 345 and became the secretary of the patriarch Athanasius. He then became archdeacon of Alexandria and succeeded as patriarch in 385. He was a vigorous opponent of paganism and was involved in the destruction of the Serapeum in Alexandria, over which he built a church. He played an active role in church politics and was partly responsible for the deposition of the patriarch of Constantinople, John Chrysostom. He died in Alexandria on 15 October 412. See also BENJAMIN; COPTIC CHURCH; CYRIL; CYRUS; DIOSCORUS.
THINIS. Greek name for a city in northern Upper Egypt, possibly in or near modern Girga. Ancient Egyptian Tjeny, capital of the eighth Upper Egyptian nome. The major god worshipped at the site was Anhur, later identified with the god Shu. The city is named by Manetho as the native town of the kings of Dynasty 1 and Dynasty 2, and the population may have been buried in the nearby cemetery of Naga el-Deir. Thinis is mentioned in texts of the First Intermediate Period, when it was fought over by rivals Dynasty 10 and Dynasty 11 until its final capture by Mentuhotep II. It is also mentioned in Egyptian texts during the Middle Kingdom and New Kingdom, and in the Third Intermediate Period it became the seat of the vizier of Upper Egypt. During the Ptolemaic Period, the capital of the nome was moved elsewhere. The site has never been securely identified.
THIRD INTERMEDIATE PERIOD (c. 1069–716 BC). The term used by some Egyptologists for the period between the end of Dynasty 20 and the beginning of Dynasty 26, although some end it with the inception of Dynasty 25. During this time, Egypt was again divided, with the south virtually independent for much of the time. Later local rulers sprang up in various cities, and Dynasty 22, Dynasty 23, and Dynasty 24 vied for recognition. See also NEW KINGDOM; LATE PERIOD.
THOTH. Greek name for the Egyptian god Djehuty. He is depicted in the form of an ibis-headed human with a moon’s disk on his head. His principal seat of worship was Hermopolis, and the ibis and baboon

were sacred to him. He was worshipped throughout Egypt as the god of scribal arts who wrote the judgement of Osiris at the weighing of the heart. See also RELIGION; SCRIBE.
THUTEMHAT (reigned c. 720 BC). Throne name Neferkheperre Kha-khau. Minor kinglet at the end of the Third Intermediate Period. He is attested as a ruler in Hermopolis, but it is not certain whether he was a predecessor or successor of King Nimlot of Hermopolis attested on the stela of Piye.
THUTMOSE (fl. 1375 BC). Royal prince. Eldest son of King Amenhotep III and presumably Queen Tiy. He held a senior position in the priesthood of Ptah at Memphis. Objects bearing his name have been found in the burial of the Apis bull in the Serapeum at Saqqara. He presumably died young since his father’s successor to the throne was his brother, Akhenaten. See also BAKETATEN; SITAMUN.
THUTMOSE (fl. 1330 BC). The name of a sculptor at Amarna whose house has been excavated and in which important royal sculptures, notably busts of Queen Nefertiti, have been found. He is one of the few Egyptian artists whose works can be identified.
THUTMOSE I (reigned c. 1504–1492 BC). Throne name Akheperre. Son of the lady Seniseneb by an unknown father. He succeeded the childless Amenhotep I and must have been related to the ruling family. Thutmose I continued Egyptian expansion south in Nubia and in Asia penetrating as far as the Euphrates River and defeating the army of Mitanni. He married his sister, Ahmose, possibly after his accession, and had two daughters, notably Hatshepsut, but his successor, Thutmose II, was the son of another wife, Mutnefret. At least two other older sons, possibly by Mutnefret, Amenmose and Wadjmose, predeceased their father. Thutmose I appears to have been the first ruler to be buried in the Valley of the Kings and is the first attested ruler at the village of Deir el-Medina where the tomb builders were located. The construction of his tomb is described in a text by his official, Ineni, and may have been tomb KV20, although his final burial might have been in tomb KV38 discovered in 1899, to which he
THUTMOSE I • 239



may have been moved later by his grandson, Thutmose III. His mummy has not been recovered.
THUTMOSE II (reigned c. 1492–1479 BC). Throne name Aakheperenre. Son of Thutmose I and Mutnefret. He may have been fairly young upon his accession, and he married his half sister, Hatshepsut. The length of his reign is uncertain. His forces put down a revolt in Nubia early in the reign. He left one daughter, Nefrure, by Hatshepsut, and a son and successor, Thutmose III, by a minor wife or concubine, Isis. His tomb has not been identified, but his mummy was recovered from the royal cache in 1881.
THUTMOSE III (reigned c. 1479–1425 BC). Throne name Menkheperre. Son of Thutmose II and Isis. He succeeded his father as a young child under the regency of his stepmother, Hatshepsut, who soon took the royal title. He remained in relative obscurity until year 21, when Hatshepsut presumably died, and he appeared at the head of his army invading Palestine-Syria. Thutmose III defeated the local princes at the battle of Megiddo and firmly established Egyptian rule in the area with a series of campaigns that led to the defeat of Mitanni. Later in his reign, he ordered the removal of all inscriptions concerning his stepmother. He was regarded in later times as one of the most effective rulers, and scarabs with his throne name were produced centuries after his death. It is not clear if he married his half sister, Nefrure, but he had at least three other principal wives, Satiah, Nebtu, and Meryetre Hatshepsut, not of royal birth, who was the mother of his successor, Amenhotep II, as his eldest son, Amenemhat, had predeceased him. Thutmose III was buried in the Valley of the Kings (KV34), which was discovered in 1898, and his body was recovered from the royal cache in 1881. He has been erroneously described as being very short, but this is due to damage to the lower part of his mummy. His mortuary temple, Djeser-akhet at Deir el-Bahri, next to that of Hatshepsut, has been largely destroyed by an earthquake and was rediscovered by a Polish expedition in 1982. See also WARFARE.
THUTMOSE IV (reigned c. 1400–1390 BC). Throne name Menkheperure. Son of Amenhotep II and Tiaa. He was apparently a younger
240 • THUTMOSE II



son and not destined to rule, but in his dream stela, he recounts that after hunting in the desert, he rested at the foot of the Sphinx and in a dream was promised the throne if he would undertake clearance and restoration of the monument, which he did upon his accession. Little is known of his reign, but he concluded peace with Mitanni and is the first ruler attested with a Mitannian princess, the daughter of Artatama I, as a wife. His principal wives were Nefertari and the Princess Iaret, who was either his sister or daughter. Thutmose IV was succeeded by Amenhotep III, his son by a minor wife, Mutemwia, whose origin is not known. He was buried in KV43 in the Valley of the Kings, which was discovered in 1903, and his mummy was recovered from the royal cache in the tomb of Amenhotep II in 1898. The remains of his mortuary temple on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes were excavated by Flinders Petrie in 1896.
TI (fl. 2450 BC). High official during Dynasty 5. He held the post of overseer of the pyramids of Neferirkare and Niuserre and the sun temples of Sahure, Neferirkare, Raneferef, and Niuserre. His mastaba tomb at Saqqara contains some of the finest carved scenes of daily life from the period. It was discovered by Auguste Mariette in 1860.
TIAA (fl. 1430–1380 BC). A wife of Amenhotep II and mother of Thutmose IV. She was buried in KV32 in the Valley of the Kings. Objects from her tomb equipment found their way into the nearby tomb of Siptah, so it was mistakenly assumed that he had a mother of this name. The name was used by several princesses during the New Kingdom.
TIMNA. A site in the Wadi Arabah that lies between the Red Sea and the Dead Sea alongside the south Negev desert. The area is rich in copper ore and has been mined since Chalcolithic times. The site was excavated from 1964–1970, 1974–1976, and 1978–1983 by a team from the Institute of Archaeology at Tel Aviv University. They discovered copper mining and smelting made by Egyptian expeditions during the New Kingdom during Dynasty 19 and Dynasty 20. The archaeologists found the remains of a small temple dedicated to the

goddess Hathor with votive offerings from Sety I to Ramesses V. The site also seems to have been worked under Dynasty 22. It may be the site Atika, which is mentioned in the Harris Papyrus from the reign of Ramesses IV.
TITULARY, ROYAL. The full style of the royal titulary consisted of five names and is attested in complete form beginning in the Middle Kingdom. During Dynasty 1, only two names were used: the Horus name, which identified the king with the sky god Horus, and the nebty name, which associated the king with the goddesses Nekhbet and Wadjet, the “two ladies,” mistresses of Upper Egypt and Lower Egypt. The Horus name was generally used on its own as the royal name during Dynasty 1, Dynasty 2, and Dynasty 3, so it is difficult to match these with personal names from other sources. The personal name, or nomen, becomes more prominent beginning in Dynasty 4, when it appears in a cartouche from the reign of Snefru, but it is clearly distinguished beginning in Dynasty 5, when there also appears the prenomen or throne name adopted upon accession and compounded with the name of the sun god Re. The Golden Horus name gradually evolved from a title and was also adopted upon accession. The Horus name was written in a serekh, a recessed palace facade, while the prenomen and nomen were written in the cartouche ring. From Dynasty 19 onward, epithets were adopted to be added to the prenomen and nomen.
TITUS (39–81 AD). Roman emperor. Original name Titus Flavius Vespasianus. He was born in Rome on 30 December 39, son of Titus Flavius Vespasianus, the future Emperor Vespasian, and Flavia Domitilla. Titus headed one of the legions that his father took on his campaign against the Jewish Revolt in 67. When his father was proclaimed emperor in 69, he then took over command of the expedition against Jerusalem. Titus captured Jerusalem in August 70 and returned to Rome via Egypt, where he was present at Memphis for the installation of an Apis bull. He became his father’s staunchest supporter in Rome and succeeded him in 79. He proved an effective and popular emperor but died after a short rule at Aquae Cutilae on 13 September 81.
242 • TITULARY, ROYAL



TIY (fl. 1400–1340 BC). Chief wife of Amenhotep III and daughter of Yuya and Tuya. She was already married in year 2 of the reign and is depicted prominently on many monuments. She was the mother of Akhenaten and probably his elder brother, the crown prince Thutmose, who predeceased his father, as well as several daughters, notably Sitamun, who married her father; Henuttaneb; Isis; and Nebetah. Tiy survived into the reign of her son and is depicted at Amarna with a Princess Baketaten, who may have been a daughter or granddaughter. Her original burial place is uncertain, and some of her funerary equipment was apparently reused in tomb KV55 in the Valley of the Kings. A previously unidentified female mummy in the royal cache has recently been suggested to be that of the queen.
TIY (fl. 1370–1323 BC). Wife of Ay. She first appears during the Amarna Period, when she is described as the nurse of Nefertiti. It has been conjectured that Ay was the father of Nefertiti, in which case Tiy would be her stepmother. She is later depicted as Ay’s queen after he ascended the throne, which makes it unlikely that he married Ankhesenamun. See also AKHENATEN.
TOD. Modern name for ancient Egyptian Djerty, a site in Upper Egypt just south of Thebes where there are remains of the temple of Montu from the Middle Kingdom to the Roman Period. The site was excavated by French archaeologists from 1934–1936. During the last year of the excavation, the Tod treasure consisting of silver vessels, bars of precious material, and cylinder seals dating to the reign of Amenemhat II and probably of foreign origin was discovered. The temple site has been the subject of recording by the French Institute again since 1999.
TOMB. The Egyptians were at first buried in simple pit tombs in the desert sand with such grave goods as pottery and slate palettes. This remained the normal state of burial for the bulk of the population throughout Egypt’s history, although the type of grave goods varied. However, the king and wealthier members of society demanded more elaborate burials, so the mastaba tomb was developed during the late Predynastic Period. This burial place initially consisted of a
TOMB • 243



rectangular mudbrick superstructure over the tomb shaft in which were a number of chambers for storage of grave goods and for use as a chapel. Beginning in Dynasty 3, the king began to use a pyramid burial built in stone, and his courtiers later followed his example using stone or stone-lined mastabas that enabled the production of carved reliefs of religious scenes and more particularly scenes of daily life. Some earlier private tombs, like those at Meidum, were decorated with painted wall reliefs, but these have rarely survived. While the use of freestanding tombs continued throughout history in such locations as Saqqara in Upper Egypt, it was more common for the elite to be buried in rock-cut tombs in the cliffs that lined the Nile Valley. The scenes in the tombs could be painted on a mud plaster base or more elaborately carved into the rock. The bulk of these tombs survive from the New Kingdom at Thebes, but earlier examples are known throughout the country in the Middle Kingdom tombs at Beni Hasan and elsewhere. The royal family adopted this method to hide their tombs in the Valley of the Kings and Valley of the Queens during Dynasty 18, Dynasty 19, and Dynasty 20. During later periods of Egyptian history, when the country was not so properous, many tombs were reused, and the royal family and priests were buried in tombs built within temple precincts for greater protection, like those at Tanis. During the Graeco-Roman Period, large communal cemeteries with mausolea containing individual family vaults were built at Alexandria and are only just being investigated. See also AFTERLIFE; KV–KV 63.
TOMB ROBBERY PAPYRI. A series of papyri dating from the reigns of Ramesses IX and Ramesses XI consisting of the official reports into claims that the royal tombs in the Valley of the Kings and elsewhere on the west bank of the Nile had been violated and robbed. After some dispute, the claims were investigated, and the culprits were severely punished. See also PASER.
TRADE. Egypt was largely self-sufficient in agriculture and raw materials; nevertheless, trade developed in the Levant beginning in the Predynastic Period for such luxury imports as wine, olive oil, lapis lazuli, and later for such necessities as copper and cedar wood. External trade was regarded as a royal monopoly and was controlled by the court. It was largely in the hands of foreign traders who were of
244 • TOMB ROBBERY PAPYRI



ficially stated to be bringing tribute to the king and then rewarded for doing so. Royal expeditions were occasionally sent to the south and the Levant, presumably to seize goods when able or trade for them if required, and by sea to the Levant in the search for cedar and other woods. Temples used agents for internal trade, and local markets flourished, but a thriving merchant class never developed. Foreign traders settled in Egypt during the New Kingdom in Memphis and Pi-Ramesse and later during the Saite Period when Greeks were assigned the town of Naukratis.
TRAVEL. The ancient Egyptians did not as a rule travel extensively, but the king and officials needed to traverse the country, and farmers needed to visit local markets. Then, as now, most people either walked or rode donkeys for local visits. An important official was often carried in a palanquin for short distances. For longer journeys, the most convenient way to move from place to place was by boat on the Nile and its canals. During the flood season, this was the most practical way to travel. The use of the desert road system for internal travel and journeys to the oases and mines is only now being studied and fully appreciated. The Egyptians were not very keen on foreign travel, as they regarded Egypt as the height of civilization. Their armies and trade expeditions marched on foot with officers later in chariots and supplies on pack mules, but maritime sailing expeditions are recorded to the Syrian ports mainly for purposes of trade. The Tale of Sinuhe and the Tale of Wenamun illustrate the distaste felt by Egyptians for traveling abroad. See also WARFARE.
TRIAD. A term used by Egyptologists to refer to the standard divine family of each city, which usually consisted of the chief god of the city, his wife, and his son. For example, the triad from Thebes consisted of the god Amun, his wife, Mut; and his son, Khonsu. That of Memphis comprised the god Ptah; his wife, Sakhmet; and his son, Nefertum. A triad could also have consisted of a god or goddess and two consorts. See also RELIGION.
TUNA EL-GEBEL. Arabic name for the necropolis of Hermopolis in the desert near the city. A boundary stela of Akhenaten marks it as the edge of his city at Amarna. The site is primarily known for its

decorated tombs from the Persian Period to the Roman Period, notably that of Petosiris discovered in 1920, and underground galleries for the burials of ibis mummies sacred to the god Thoth. The site was excavated by the Egyptian Antiquities Service from 1919–1920 and 1931–1952, a German expedition beginning in 1983, and a joint German–Egyptian expedition since 1989.
TURA. Modern name for the site south of Cairo of the principal limestone quarry used by the ancient Egyptians for fine stone, notably for the outside blocks for the pyramids at Giza. The quarries are still in use. See also HATNUB.
TURIN EGYPTIAN MUSEUM. The Museo Egizio, or Egyptian Museum, in Turin, Italy, was founded in 1824 with the purchase of the collection of the French consul general in Egypt, Bernardino Drovetti. The collection included 100 statues, particularly an extremely fine representation of Ramesses II, along with other Egyptian objects, many from Deir el-Medina, notably papyri and the important Turin Royal Canon. The collection was further enlarged by the director of the museum from 1894–1927, Ernesto Schiaparelli, who conducted excavations in the Valley of the Queens, Deir elMedina, where he found the intact tomb of Kha; Giza; Heliopolis; Qau el-Kebir; and Gebelein. The museum took part in the Nubian Rescue Campaign and was rewarded with the gift of the temple of Ellesiya. See also BERLIN EGYPTIAN MUSEUM; BOSTON MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS; BRITISH MUSEUM; CAIRO EGYPTIAN MUSEUM; LOUVRE MUSEUM; METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART.
TURIN ROYAL CANON. The only king list to survive on papyrus, although the text is now damaged and incomplete. It was written during the Ramesside Period. When complete, it was extremely detailed, listing almost every king with the years of his reign, all divided into dynasties. A similar text was used by the later historian Manetho.
TUSHRATTA (fl. 1342–27 BC). King of Mitanni. Son of Shuttarna II of Mitanni. He succeeded to the throne after a succession crisis in

which his brother was killed. His aunt was married to Thutmose IV; his sister, Gilukhepa, to Amenhotep III; and his daughter, Tadukhepa, to Amenhotep III and then Akhenaten. He was one of the correspondents in the Amarna letters. His kingdom was weakened by Hittite aggression under Suppiluliuma I and dynastic disputes that resulted in his assassination. His kingdom was then reduced to vassalage by the Hittites. See also WARFARE.
TUTANKHAMUN (reigned c. 1336–1327 BC). Throne name Nebkheperre, formerly Tutankhaten. Son of a king, probably Akhenaten. Still a child, he succeeded Akhenaten after the ephemeral rule of Smenkhkare, presumably under the tutelage of Ay and Horemheb. His reign is marked by the return to orthodoxy and the worship of Amun and the move of the capital back to Thebes from Amarna. He married his probable half sister, Ankhesenpaaten, who later changed her name to Ankhesenamun, but he had no surviving children. He was the last ruler of the family of Dynasty 18 and was succeeded by Ay, who buried him in tomb KV62 in the Valley of the Kings. His memory was suppressed under Dynasty 19. The discovery of his intact tomb by Howard Carter in 1922 has ensured his fame, although as he died young, he took no independent actions during his reign.
TUY (fl. 1300–1275 BC). Egyptian queen. She was the wife of Sety I and mother of Ramesses II. She came from a minor military family, being the daughter of the lieutenant of the chariotry Raia. She was buried in QV80 in the Valley of the Queens.
TYTI. A queen of Dynasty 20. She was the daughter, wife, and mother of kings, but her exact position in the royal family is not certain. She may have been the daughter of Ramesses IX, wife of Ramesses X, and mother of Ramesses XI. She was buried in QV57 in the Valley of the Queens.

became chief physician to Cambyses of Persia following his conquest of Egypt in 525 BC, and he claimed to choose the royal titulary of Cambyses. He left a long autobiographical inscription on a statue now housed in the Vatican Museum in Rome. He used his influence to benefit Sais and its temple. His tomb has recently been discovered at Abusir.
UGARIT. A major town and seaport on the eastern Mediterranean coast in modern Syria, modern Ras Shamra. Relations with Egypt are attested beginning in the Middle Kingdom, and the city became part of the Egyptian empire during the New Kingdom until it switched its allegiance to the Hittites at the end of Dynasty 18. It was destroyed by the Sea Peoples around year 8 of Ramesses III. Excavations by a French expedition began in 1928 and have yielded much material, including inscribed tablets. See also AMMISTAMRU I.
UNAS (reigned c. 2375–2345 BC). Final ruler of Dynasty 5 and successor of Djedkare. His name has also been transcribed as Wenis. He is principally known for his pyramid tomb at Saqqara, opened in 1881, which is the earliest pyramid to be inscribed on the inside walls with the religious texts now known as pyramid texts. The causeway to his mortuary temple was also decorated with fine reliefs. His pyramid complex has been the subject of excavations from 1899–1901, in 1903, and during the 1930s and 1940s. It has been examined more recently from 1971–1981 and 1986–1990 by succesive teams from the Egyptian Antiquities Service.
UPPER EGYPT. Ancient Egyptian Shemau. The area of Egypt comprising the Nile Valley from Memphis north to Elephantine during ancient times. The area seems to have evolved into a separate kingdom with its capital at Hierakonpolis during the late Predynastic Period and was united with Lower Egypt by Narmer, probably by conquest. It was one of the two lands ruled by the Egyptian monarch. In the royal titulary, the symbol of Upper Egypt was a bee, and its crown was the tall white crown. The term is sometimes used by modern Egyptologists with a more restrictive meaning, covering the area from Asyut south, the northern part being termed Middle Egypt.
248 • UGARIT



URAEUS. Name for the cobra, representing the goddess Wadjet, which appears on the brow of the headdress of the monarch and so signifies royalty and kingship. During Dynasty 25, the Nubian rulers of Egypt wore a double uraeus. See also NEKHBET.
URHI-TESHUB (fl. 1292–1255 BC). King of the Hittites under the throne name Mursili III. Son of Muwattalli II by a secondary wife. He succeeded his father but faced hostility from his powerful uncle, Hattusili II, who eventually deposed him after a short reign c. 1267 BC. He was banished to Syria and later Cyprus but fled to Egypt and was granted asylum by Ramesses II. His presence was undoubtedly used by the Egyptians in the negotiations over the Egyptian–Hittite peace treaty in 1258 BC. Despite Hittite protests, he was not handed over but rather allowed to depart to Palestine, where he may have obtained some territory to rule. His ultimate fate is unknown.
URONARTI. Modern name for a site in Lower Nubia in the Second Cataract region of the Nile where a fortress was constructed on an island under Senusret III as part of the Egyptian garrison. Egyptian Khesef Iunu. It was abandoned during the Second Intermediate Period. The site has now been flooded by Lake Nasser, the lake created by the Aswan High Dam. See also ANIBA; ASKUT; BUHEN; KUMMA; MIRGISSA; SEMNA; SHALFAK.
USERKAF (reigned c. 2494–2487 BC). First ruler of Dynasty 5. According to a later legend in the Westcar Papyrus, he was the eldest of triplet sons of Rededet, a priestess of Re. The story is fictitious but emphasizes the attachment of the new dynasty to the cult of Re. The king built a sun temple at Abu Ghurab near Abusir, which was excavated by a Swiss expedition during the 1950s, but he was buried in a pyramid at Saqqara, which was opened in 1881. His pyramid complex was excavated by various archaeologists from 1889 onward and more recently by a French team from 1966–1973, in 1979, from 1987–1988, and from 1993–1997.

VALLEY OF THE KINGS. Known in Arabic as Biban el-Moluk. A secluded desert area in the cliffs on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes consisting of two valleys chosen as the burial place for the kings of Dynasty 18, Dynasty 19, and Dynasty 20. There are 62 tombs there, mainly in the eastern valley. It is probable that the first ruler buried here was Thutmose I, and with the subsequent burials of the later monarchs, it became standard practice to inter royalty at the location. Apart from kings, there are tombs of some princes and favored courtiers. The tombs were constructed by a crew of royal workmen based at Deir el-Medina. The walls of the tombs were decorated with religious texts and contain very little in the way of historical information. The last tomb built was that of Ramesses XI, but it appears never to have been completed. Future rulers were buried in the north where they lived. Most of the tombs were plundered at the end of Dynasty 20 and beginning of Dynasty 21. Some remained open during the GraecoRoman Period and later periods, while others were rediscovered and excavated during the 19th and early 20th century, notably the tomb of Tutankhamun, the only royal tomb to be recovered intact. Most tombs still await full publication. The valley was first visited during modern times by the priests Claude Sicard and Pietro Pincia on 2 January 1721. The first plan was drawn by explorer Richard Pococke in 1738. Recent work has focused on the unexplored tomb of Ramesses II and that of his sons and a newly discovered tomb KV63. Following the desecration of the royal tombs, the mummies of many of the rulers were gathered in two secret royal caches from which they were recovered during the 20th century.
VALLEY OF THE QUEENS. An area on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes where the tombs of the queens and some princes of

Dynasty 18, Dynasty 19, and Dynasty 20 were constructed. The most notable is the tomb of Nefertari, wife of Ramesses II. The area was explored by an Italian expedition under Ernesto Schiaparelli from 1903–1905, and since 1970, it has been extensively examined by a French team who began excavations in 1984. See also QV.
VESPASIAN (9–79 AD). Roman emperor. Full name Titus Flavius Vespasianus. Son of Titus Flavius Sabinus and Vespasia Polla. He was born at Falacrina near Rieti, Italy, on 17 November 9,. He pursued a senatorial career, taking part in the conquest of Britain in 43 and governing Africa. He was put in command of the army sent to crush the Jewish revolt in 67. On 1 July 69, he was proclaimed emperor by the prefect of Egypt, Tiberius Julius Alexander and his forces and was supported by the Eastern and Balkan armies. He moved to Alexandria to cut wheat exports to Italy and is recorded as visiting the temple of Sarapis there. His forces took Rome in December 69, and he reached Italy in 70. Vespasian proved an effective ruler. He died at Aquae Clutiae near Rieti on 23 or 24 June 79.
VICEROY OF KUSH. Governor of Egyptian Nubia during the New Kingdom whose title was literally King’s son of Kush, although no royal princes ever held this office. The title was established in early Dynasty 18 and continued until the end of Dynasty 20 when Viceroy Panehsi became embroiled in the civil war in the Theban region at first by royal command but was eventually driven back to Nubia by Piankh. Egyptian control of Nubia seems to have lapsed at his death, but the title was used purely symbolically by descendants of Piankh.
VIZIER. Modern name based on the Arabic wazir for the chief administrative official of the Egyptian kingdom. Ancient Egyptian tjaty. The office appears to be attested since the Early Dynastic Period. It was the chief administrative office in the country, and the vizier was responsible for law and order. Beginning in the New Kingdom, the post was divided into two positions—one vizier for Lower Egypt and one for Upper Egypt. The post was the most powerful next to that of the ruler, and an ambitious vizier was often a threat to the king, as in the case of Amenemhat I.

WADI EL-HUDI. Site in the Eastern Desert used as a quarry for amethyst beginning in the Middle Kingdom during Dynasty 11, Dynasty 12, and Dynasty 13. The site was rediscovered in 1923, first surveyed in 1939, and explored by the Egyptian archaeologist Ahmed Fakhry from 1944–1945 and in 1949, when he copied surviving inscriptions. It was again surveyed by A. I. Sadek in 1975, a British team in 1993, and a German expedition in 1993.

WADI GABBANAT AL-QURUD. A desert wadi on the west bank of the Nile opposite Thebes in which a number of tombs of Dynasty 18 queens are located, including Manhata and other foreign wives of Thutmose III, and Hatshepsut’s first tomb and possibly that of her mother, Ahmose, and daughter, Nefrure. The site also yielded burials of baboons from the Ptolemaic Period.
WADI HAMMAMAT. Site in the Eastern Desert used as a quarry for siltstone (greywacke) beginning in the Old Kingdom. Gold mines were also located here. There are many inscriptions recording expeditions, notably those of Mentuhotep III and Mentuhotep IV of Dynasty 11. The desert wadi was the major access route to the Red Sea coast and its ports at Mersa Gawasis during ancient Egyptian times, Berenike and Myos Hormos during the Graeco-Roman Period, and the land of Punt and later India. The Roman bases along the desert route, like Krokodilo, were excavated by a French expedition from 1994–1997.

WADI NATRUN. Coptic Scetis. A valley in the Western Desert southwest of the Delta of Lower Egypt. It became a place of settlement for monks during the Coptic Period to the middle of the 4th century. The monks initially formed individual cells grouped around four churches rather than creating a tight monastic settlement as envisioned by Pachomius, but later unrest and bedouin raids encouraged the growth of fortified monasteries. One of the earliest was Deir alBaramus, whose original site was discovered by a Dutch expedition in 1994. Several monasteries still exist.
WADI SHATT ER-RIGAL. A wadi or desert gully in Upper Egypt near Aswan (Elephantine). Carved in the cliffs are predynastic rock drawings and an important relief from Dynasty 11 that names Mentuhotep II and his parents, Intef III and Iah.
WADI TUMILAT. A desert valley formed by a dry river bed that runs from the Eastern Delta in Lower Egypt to Ismailia. The area appears to have been uninhabited except during the Second Intermediate Period and the Late Period to the Graeco-Roman Period. The archaeological site of Tell er-Rataba is located at the Delta edge of the wadi and that of Tell el-Maskhuta in the middle. The area was probably known as Tjeku during the New Kingdom and was closely guarded as one of the desert routes into Egypt.
WADJET. Egyptian goddess of Buto, usually represented as a cobra. She was the tutelary goddess of Lower Egypt and as such appears as part of the nebty, or “two ladies,” name in the royal titulary and as the uraeus on the royal crown. During the Late Period, she is often represented as a lioness-headed goddess. See also NEKHBET; RELIGION.
WADJET • 253



WADJMOSE (fl. 1504–1490 BC). Egyptian prince of Dynasty 18. He was the son of Thutmose I probably by the lady Mutnefret. He is attested during the reign of his father and may have become heir to the throne after the death of his elder brother, Amenmose. Wadjmose predeceased his father, and a mortuary temple was built in his honor near the Ramesseum, in which he and Mutnefret were commemorated. See also THUTMOSE II.
WAHIBRE (reigned 589–570 BC). The Greek form of his name is Apries. Throne name Haaibre. Son of Psamtik II and Takhut. He embarked on a military expedition against Cyrene, which ended in failure. His troops mutinied and proclaimed Ahmose II as ruler. His forces were defeated, and he apparently perished then or after his capture. See also WARFARE.
WARFARE. Warfare appeared to have been endemic in the Nile Valley during the Predynastic Period until the unification of Egypt under Narmer, who is depicted with his captives. Military expeditions are known to have taken place into Nubia, notably under Snefru. The collapse of the Old Kingdom was followed by civil wars during the First Intermediate Period until the reunification of Egypt under Mentuhtep II of Dynasty 11. The bodies of soldiers slain during the conflict have been found buried at Thebes. During Dynasty 12, the Egyptian army conquered Nubia and built a string of fortresses to control the area. Little is known of the organization of the army during this time. The basic weapons were axes, maces, daggers, small swords, spears, and bows and arrows. The fall of the Middle Kingdom and the invasion of the Hyksos brought about the introduction of the chariot during the Second Intermediate Period, while the long sword is first attested during the New Kingdom. Under Dynasty 18, a more professional standing army emerged that campaigned successfully in Nubia and in the Levant under Ahmose, Thutmose II, and notably Thutmose III at the battle of Megiddo. The Satire on Trades gives a dim view of the life of a soldier. The rise of the Hittites led to reversals that Ramesses II of Dynasty 19 failed to stem at the battle of Kadesh. During the Third Intermediate Period, there were bouts of civil war followed by the conquest by Assyria. The rise of Dynasty 26 brought some

Egyptian victories in the Levant under Nekau II and in Nubia under Psamtik II, but Egypt was defeated by the Babylonians and later conquered by Persia. During the Ptolemaic Period, there were several attempts to annex Syria, but the state was weakened by civil wars and finally annexed by Rome. Roman rule was generally peaceful, but as it weakened, Egypt was invaded by the forces of Septimia Zenobia of Palmyra; later the Sassanian Persians; and finally the Arabs, who overran Egypt in 642 AD.
WEGAF (reigned c. 1795–1792 BC). Throne name Khutawyre. He is generally regarded as the first ruler of Dynasty 13, although his position in the dynasty has recently been questioned. He appears to have been of common origin, but the circumstances of his accession are obscure. His reign was brief. See also SECOND INTERMEDIATE PERIOD.
WEIGHING OF THE HEART. The main feature of the judgement of the dead when the heart of the deceased, regarded by Egyptians as the seat of intelligence, was weighed on a balance against the feather of maat, representing truth and righteousness. A virtuous heart would balance and admit the deceased to the afterlife, while a heavy heart would indicate an evildoer whose heart would then be devoured by a monster and hence denied an afterlife. The Book of the Dead was designed to fix the balance with magic spells to enable the deceased to enter the afterlife without difficulty. A heart scarab was often placed over the heart of the deceased with the same intention. See also RELIGION.
WENAMUN. Hero of a literary tale set at the end of Dynasty 20. The Tale of Wenamun outlines his adventures on a trip to Lebanon seeking wood for religious constructions at Thebes. The story reflects the loss of Egyptian influence in the Near East and the political divisions in Egypt. It survives in only one incomplete copy. See also LITERATURE; SINUHE.

WENNEFER (fl. 1320 BC). Also known as Parennefer. High priest of Amun at the temple of Karnak at Thebes. Son of Minhotep and Maia. He served at the end of Dynasty 18 probably in the reigns of Tutankhamun and Horemheb. He was initially wrongly dated to the reign of Ramesses II, but the excavation of his tomb on the west bank of the Nile at Thebes by a German expedition from 1990–1993 revealed his true chronology. His son, Amenemone, served in the army and was later chief of works in the Ramesseum for Ramesses II. See also BAKENKHONS; NEBWENNEF; PASER.
WEPWAWET. Egyptian god in the form of a canine, originally a jackal but later identified by the Greeks as a wolf. Chief god of Asyut. His name “opener of the ways” associated him with royal conquests and as a protector and guide of the deceased through the underworld. See also RELIGION.
WESTCAR PAPYRUS. A papyrus that contains a literary tale set during the reign of Khufu of Dynasty 4 but predicts the eventual triumph of Dynasty 5. The beginning and end of the text are missing. The king is entertained by tales of the feats of magicians, each told by one of his sons. The final magician foretells the end of the dynasty with Khufu’s grandson and the advent of Dynasty 5. The papyrus is named after its earliest known owner and is now housed in the Berlin Egyptian Museum. See also LITERATURE.

WILKINSON, SIR JOHN GARDNER (1797–1875). British Egyptologist. He was born in Little Missenden, Buckinghamshire, England, on 5 October 1797. Educated at Harrow and Oxford, he was persuaded to devote his studies to Egyptology, and from 1821–1833 he studied hieroglyphs and recording inscriptions in Egypt. He initiated the numbering of the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. Wilkinson can be regarded as the founder of Egyptology in Great Britain, and he wrote several books, including his best seller The Manners and Customs of the Ancient Egyptians (1837). He died in Llandovery, Wales, on 29 October 1875. See also CHAMPOLLION, JEANFRANÇOIS; LEPSIUS, (KARL) RICHARD.

WISDOM LITERATURE. A genre of Egyptian literature that consists of precepts by sages or kings to guide the reader in a virtuous life, known as sebayet, or lamentations on the failure of mankind to do so. Surviving examples date from most periods of Egyptian history. The earliest texts are alleged to have been composed during the Old Kingdom by Prince Hardjedef, which have not survived intact, and the viziers Kagemni and Ptahhotep. See also KHAKHEPERRESENEB; MERYKARE.
WOMEN. Women in Egypt had the most secure position of females anywhere in the ancient world. During the Pharaonic Period, women
WOMEN • 257



were recognized as having equal legal rights as men and therefore had the right to own, inherit, and manage property and appear in court in their own capacity and not with a male guardian. The wife had a valued position in any household and was normally in a monogamous marriage, although sexual fidelity on the part of the husband was not expected. Women found it difficult to exercise their legal rights unless they were backed by male protection, so their legal rights were often more theoretical than practical. During the Graeco-Roman Period, these rights were restricted in accordance with classical practice. The principal role of a woman of all classes was to be a wife and manage her household, so she was invariably known by the title nebet per, mistress of the house. She had to bear and rear children and feed and clothe her husband and offspring, thus a large part of their time was taken up with food preparation, including the grinding of wheat into flour, and textile manufacture. Wealthy women had servants, but even royal wives and princesses were involved in the weaving process. There is little evidence supporting the use of peasant women in agriculture apart from the winnowing process and in the harvesting of flax. Women were normally barred from administrative and political offices and so wielded their influence from behind the scenes, although there were powerful queens, like Tiy and Nefertiti, and queen mothers, like Merneith and Ankhesenmeryre. The few queens regnant in Egyptain history, for example, Nitocris, Sobeknefru, and Tewosret, were ephemeral stopgaps and marked the end of their dynasties. The only exception was Hatshepsut, who usurped the throne and reigned for a lengthy period. Only during the Ptolemaic Period did Egyptian queens wield real power, notably Cleopatra VII.

–X
XERXES I (reigned 486–465 BC). King of Persia and ruler of Egypt. Son of Darius I and Amestris, daughter of Cyrus. He is best known for his attempted invasion of Greece resulting in defeats at the battles of Salamis (480 BC) and Mycale (479 BC). Thereafter, the Greek states encouraged unrest in Egypt. He was assassinated in a court in

trigue in 465 BC and succeeded by his son, Artaxerxes I. See also WARFARE.
XOIS. Greek name for the capital of the sixth nome of Lower Egypt. Ancient Egyptain Khasuu, modern Sakha. Little is known about the site, which was briefly excavated by Howard Carter in 1912. It is alleged by Manetho to have been the seat of Dynasty 14 during the Second Intermediate Period.
–Y
YANTIN (fl. 1735 BC). Ruler of Byblos. Son of Yakin. He is attested on a relief dated to Neferhotep I. He uses an Egyptian title implying Egypt’s sovereignty over Byblos. He may be identified with Yantinammu, ruler of Byblos, and his father with Yakin-ilu, a contemporary of an earlier Egyptian ruler, Sehetepibre.
YAQUB-HER (reigned c. 1600 BC). Throne name Meruserre. Ruler during the Second Intermediate Period attested on scarabs. He is probably one of the Hyksos chieftains, but it is unclear whether he belongs to Dynasty 15 or is simply a minor ruler of Dynasty 14. His name is similar to the Biblical patriarch Jacob whose sojourn in Egypt might derive from an account of this king.
YOUNG, THOMAS (1773–1829). British scholar. He was born at Milverton, Somerset, England, on 13 June 1773. He studied medicine at the University of London and the University of Edinburgh and undertook further studies at the University of Göttingen and University of Cambridge. He was extremely precocious and gained a reputation as a polymath interested in both science and linguistics. He attempted to decipher the hieroglyphic language and was the first to recognize that it was in fact partly alphabetic. He identified several of the letters from the cartouches in the Rosetta Stone. He later abandoned his studies, but they were continued by Jean-François Champollion, who made the major breakthrough in the decipherment; however, Champollion never acknowledged his debt to Young, claiming
YOUNG, THOMAS • 259



inaccurately that he was unaware of his work. Young died in London on 10 May 1829.
YUYA (fl. 1390–1360 BC). High official. Father of Tiy and father-inlaw of Amenhotep III. He and his wife, Tuya, were given the honor of a tomb in the Valley of the Kings, which was discovered intact in 1905. Their mummies and funerary equipment are now in the Cairo Egyptian Museum.
–Z
ZANNANZA (fl. 1327). Son of Suppiluliuma I, king of the Hittites. He was sent to Egypt as the prospective husband of the widowed queen, who was probably Ankhesenamun, widow of Tutankhamun, after she had appealed for help. He died mysteriously on the way, and his father blamed the new Egyptian ruler Ay for his death.
ZAWIYET EL-ARYAN. Modern name for a site south of Giza where two unfinished pyramids are located. The older structure probably belongs to Khaba of Dynasty 3 and the other to Dynasty 4. There are also graves dating to the Early Dynastic Period, New Kingdom, and Roman Period. The site was excavated by the Egyptian Antiquities Service in 1903 and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts from 1910–1911.
ZAWIYET SULTAN. Also known as Zawiyet al-Mayetin and Zawiyet el-Amwat. Modern names for a site in Middle Egypt south of modern Minya on the east bank of the Nile. It has remains from the Predynastic Period to the Graeco-Roman Period, but its main features are a ruined step pyramid of Dynasty 3 and Old Kingdom and New Kingdom tombs. The site was investigated by a German expedition in 1976, 1977 and 1985, and by a joint Egyptian–British team beginning in 2000.
ZAWIYET UMM EL-RAKAN. The site of a Ramesside fortress built by Ramesses II on the Libyan border near Mersa Matruh as a defen

sive measure against Libyan incursions. It contains a small temple to Ptah and Sakhmet, chapels to the deified king, and storage magazines. It was discovered and partially excavated by the British archaeologist Alan Rowe in 1946. It has been under excavation by a team of archaeologists from the University of Liverpool since 1994.
ZENOBIA, SEPTIMIA (fl. 240–272 AD). Queen of Palmyra. She was the wife of Septimius Odenathus, king of Palmyra in Syria, and she took over as regent for her son, Vaballathus, upon her husband’s assassination in 268 AD. Her forces conquered Egypt in 270 and expanded throughout the Levant. She proclaimed her son as a rival emperor to Aurelian in Rome, but his forces recaptured Egypt in 272 and later seized Palmyra. Zenobia was taken captive to Rome. See also WARFARE.
ZENON (fl. 260–240 BC). Son of Agreophon of Kaunos in Caria, Asia Minor. Secretary and later manager of the gift-estate of Apollonius c. 256–248 BC and finance minister of Ptolemy II, located at Philadelphia in the Fayum. He is known from his volumious correspondence of more than 1,000 papyri, which give valuable insight into the administration of Egypt during the early Ptolemaic Period.

INTRODUCTION
This bibliography is not intended to be an exhaustive and complete reference tool to the vast literature on ancient Egypt. Details on many older books can be found in the more complete bibliographies of Ibrahim Hilmy, Ida A. Pratt, and Christine Beinlich-Seeber cited in this section. With few exceptions, only monographs have been cited to limit the bibliography to a reasonable size. Modern works, especially on archaeological excavations, have been preferred to older accounts. There has been bias in favor of books published in English, but German and French works have been noted where appropriate.
