Abstract
The Gundestrup Cauldron has remained enigmatic since the day it was discovered in a Danish peat bog near Borremosebog in May of 1891 . Many have wondered and pondered over the mysterious imagery and have tried to give it an interpretation. Some have proposed a Scythian or Vedic Indian origin to it, while others have recognized the dear cOimection to Celtic mythological themes and motifs. The following article is but abrief and detailed interpretative iconographical analysis of what is in truth a star chart such as those formerly conceived and maintained by the Celtic Druids of the La Tene cultural period .
Our understanding ofzodiacal stellar symbolism is but a "cultural construct." For instance, when one looks at the vastness ofthe night sky, all one sees is an infinity ofpin
1



point specks of light. Connecting the bright dots into a recognizable pattern is truly an exercise ofimagination. is what is meant by a construct. For example, when looking at the spots on the moon, the Chinese and Native Americans or Amerindians see a while the Europeans see a face prosaically referred to as "the old man in the Moon." Same spot, but interpretations. The same can be said for name attribution of star pattern designations. In the ancient past, when looking at the stars of Septentrion, particularly the circumpolar stars in the region of the Big Dipper, some these as a long tailed bear wbile during the agricultural they were seen alternately either as a pouring pot, a wain, or a plow. In time and space, each culture had its distinctive interpretation. This defining concept is what can be defined as a "cultural signature."
h"".-",h-,..."" the way stars and planets are grouped and charted is a strong cultural indicator on how the world is viewed and explained. It was lang thought that the Sumerian or Chaldean charts were the oldest models the western and eastern ones such as those of Greece, Persia, and India. Again, as it tums out, tbis is but another misconception. It is also true that some of the Classical Mediterranean and Sanskrit names for the stars and constellations were borrowed from the Chaldean But then tbis was not the case for the more archaic charts of the early and Celts. Nomenclature for astral bodies and star clusters varies not only with time and age but also from one linguistic to another. Henceforth, it is possible to and rank consteUations by their mythological themes and motifs.
There is a quote on Claudius Ptolemaeus by Jim Tester that very weH describes the COlnp4etellce of a "The astrologer, Ptolemy, should so understand the movements ofthe heavenly bodies that he can know 'the place ofany configurationl..."l
The consists of adefinite of star grouped in a band girdling the center along ecliptic. The zodiacal models had 8 or 10 constellations wbile others counted not more than 12 or Certain consteUations such as Libra and Scorpio comprised of many wbich included Ophiuchus the Snake-Bearer. Moon based astrology used the 27 or 28 day-night circadian rhythms (nychthemeron) ofthe month. Certainly, the Almanac is lunar and the Zodiac, solar, but of course, these are two different the relying on the yearly lunar (3 days) of approxinlately 12 the second, on the solar cycle (365.6 days). An important reminder is that moon visits the zodiacal constel1ations in but one month wbile the sun takes a full year to complete the same course. Worse still, the authors often fail to give their making it impossible to verifY them. In short, we can only conjecture on who it in the place. in tbis case, most evidently, all paths lead to Robert Graves.
Robert Graves, seeing the irnpossibility ofthe Zodiac being a "perpetual calendar," erroneously thought that the letter sequence ofthe Ogham could not reconcile the equinoxes and solstices with the twelve zodiacal constellations. He believed that the Zodiac emerged from the thirteen-month lunar calendar and he suspected that the
2



dual Gemini signs were fused into one in order to harmoruze the lunar-solar cycles. Graves has the tree order start on Christmas in December on the 24th; tbis is an impossibility since the Celtic lunar-solar year commenced in mid-fall around the October-November moon. Also impossible are bis fixed dates, we now know from archaeological data collected on the Coligny plates excavated in a smaU town near Lyon France, in 1897, that the Druids had reconciled in a most ingeruous way the discrepancies of the two cycles. Monthly dates followed the Moon phases with the Zodiacal months overlapping. Corrections were made by indexing the shorter lunar cycIe with the longer solar cycle by adding an extra month every two and three following a five years tum-around. Therefore, there were no fixed dates in the druidical scheme, just floating ones!
It is very unlikely that the Celtic Druids' system of astrology would diverge to the point expressed in the reconstructed models of Graves and followers such as Carol Carnac and Helena Paterson in therr Astrology, or again, in the Astrologie Gauloise Bliss. Did not Cassidorus say that the Celtic led Dacian Getae knew oftwelve zodiacal signs? Tbe name ofthe charioteer may change from culture to cuIture but the vebicle, the sun-chariot, remains firmlyon the sun path. A scrutiny of the Irish manuscripts reveals a system halfWay between the Hindu and Greek systems. This being that western astrology had its origins in the old Indo-European cosmological mindset. Also, the twelve of the Zodiac were already envisioned at the time of the Rig Veda hymns (composition dated 2000 in the Bronze Age).
Astrological imagery can be likened to a movie screen wbich sets the visual representations of the Zodiac in a very loose and narrow band. Tbe poets caUed it Eurydice's belt. Eurydice (Eurudike) was Orpheus' wife. Orpheus almost succeeds in bringing back Hades, the Underworld, and back to the Land ofthe Living. The same myth is found in the Celtic tradition. It was said that the first thing written in Ogham was the birch tree sign written seven times to prevent Dechtire,2 Lugh's wife, from being abducted into the Otherworld. She was thus saved in order to Lugh a son called Setanta,3 of the Path." This sets the motion ofthe Sun's path through the zodiacal
signs are always 12 to a number and measure at a angle. The sun moves at about one degree per day and it takes roughly 30 days, a tittle more than one lunar mondl, to move from one to another. Therefore, each morning the sun rises at a different point on horizon. In one year the sun will have covered 3600 taking 365.2422 days (365 days 5 hours 48 and 49.6 seconds) to return to the vernal point it began its cycIe. This value is almost the same as 2000 years ago (the Sonnocinxs took than days).
-Why is the tropical year longer than the zodiacal degrees? ... For three reasons mainly:
1* Because the circle-division into 3600 is an arbitrary mathematical convention having inspired by its approximation the estimated duration ofthe year in a number of days, and worked out in order to be divisible into twelve integers.
2* Because the time taken by the Earth's revolution around the sun is not an integer multiple of its own rotation,
3



3* Also, because its orbit is slightly elliptic thus resulting in a non-constant revolution speed, and because the estimated breath of the zodiacal consteUations is inaccurate (or approximate in conceptual measure). Tradition has it that certain asterisms (steUar archipelagos) or star clusters were so dense and others so sparse, that large consteBations would take over the two bordering signs while the smaller ones lost part oftheir astrological houses. Certain constellations also overlap during the part of certain months. To wit, in the period of Capricorn, the sun rises in the stars belonging to Aquarius.
Let' s face it, Druids, as were the other sages ofAntiquity such as the Mathematici, the Rishis, the Chaldeans, and the Magi, were certainly not "lunatics." That they should confuse the 13 monthly lunar cycle with the 12 months solar zodiacal cycle, speaks more ofthe state of confusion ofthese contemporary enthusiasts than on the state oftrue astral-science in Antiquity. As fme observers ofthe skies, the Druid-astronomers worked within the limits of "naked eye" astronomy. In light ofthis, they could only speculate on the observable planets moving within and without the consteHations, they cyclically visited. To name more than the five anciently known planets, including the two luminaries, is stretching things a bit much. This being said, Uranus was at tirnes perceived and known to a few astronomers. Again, the two luminaries were considered as planets since they moved accordingly. Lets be honest, Neptune and Pluto were unknown to the ancients. To include these newly discovered planets in a reconstructed Celtic Zodiac is downright dishonest!
The idea of a Zodiac was aIready very ancient when Hipparchus ofNicaea had cataloged the positions ofsome 1022 stars and 49 consteHations. By this time, the ancients were already in possession of a weB-documented sky chart. They also believed that their ancestral homeland was situated in the stars ofthe northern skies. That is, they truly saw themselves as "star children." This explains why the study of stars was irnportant to them.
Zodiacal consteHations, as we know them, were a thing long familiar to the seers of Antiquity. When in 174 BCE Hipparchus identified a new star in the consteUation of Scorpio, he was very eager to chart all the other visible stars he could observe. He had correctly suspected that the skies were not eternal. Hipparchus made himself famous by discovering the Earth's precession caused by the osciUation of the rotational axis every 25 600 years. This oscillation affects the position of the celestial poles by causing a slow shift ofthe equinoxes. Around 280 BCE, another Greek, Aratus ofSoles, gave, in Phenomenons and Prognostics, a very precise description of the skies for the practical use of navigators and farmers. Aratus, who was born in Cilicia, Asia Minor, sometime around 320 BCE, was drawing his information from the work ofEudoxus (circa 370 BCE). This study was the first true scientific work on astronomy. The old constellations identified by the ancients were just those that run along the ecliptic, those referred to as the Zodiac, and which serve to mark the passing of seasonal time. They also identified the circumpolar stars ofUrsa Major, then called the Great Wain, along with alpha Draconis as the Pole Star. That occurred just before 2500 BCE. Therefore, from the names hinted at in the Zodiac, i.e. Orlon and his dog
4



(Sirius), we are quick to grasp the general underlying pastoral theme. Most authors believe that the oldest proofs for the antiquity ofWestern Astrology are to be found in the Denderah planisphere artifact, dated before 1800 BCE kept at the Bibliotheque nationale Paris. It was observed that the uncharted skies without zodiacal representations run along the 36 latitude. The center ofthe band coincides with the position ofthe southern pole in 2500 BCE. Tbis astrologica1 tradition is contemporaneous with that of India, there indicating a and cultural continuum the Danube to the Indus valleys.
The scholar and astrologer, David Frawley, has found through an of the Brahmanas, the Yqjur, and Athan'a Vedas, that the vernal equinox was in the Krittikas (the Pleiades, early Taurus) and that the summer solstice (Ayana) was in Magha (early Leo), thus yielding a date ofaround 2500 for the Vedic model. Therefore, tbis proves that the Vedic system was contemporaneous with that of the Indus Harappan culture.
Furthermore, as David Frawley observed, the oldest Zodiacs dividing the sun's path into twelve equal signs were clearly lndo-European. This dividing ofthe zodiacal belt into twelve celestial zones is not universal and its conception can be traced back to 2500
in a region ofthe world weH above the 3en parallel corresponding to that ofthe Pontic Kurgan culture.
Most the astrologers of Antiquity, such as the Greeks, Alexandrian Greco-Egyptians, and Persians, initiated time cycles at the vernal point on the advent of the spring equinox. However, with the earlier parent lndo-European system, time cycles began in autumn the faH equinox. This was also carried on by the Celts and Vedic Aryans.
Peter Berresford Eilis had noticed, thanks to bis understanding of details found in various Celtic corpuses, that Celtic cosmology paraUeled Vedic cosmology. He there noticed that the ancient Celtic astrologers used similar systems as those ofIndia. Ibis system was based on the twenty-seven lunar mansions called Nakshatras in Sanskrit His main argument was found in the mythological theme of King Ailill' s circular palace wbich had twenty-seven windows through wbich he could observe the equally numbered "star maidens." Berresford EIEs also observed that Aitil! had similar traits to the Hindu Soma king. Tbis should not come as a surprise since AiliH's queen was none other than Medba, the lrish equivalent of the Vedic mead goddess Madhavi.

The horned seated god, Cernunnos, as serpent bearer representing the constellation of Ophiucus while the serpent represents the Serpens sub-constellation.
Indeed, as Joseph Monard remarked, the celestial region of Virgo was the most logical area to buckle the cycle since that it is the largest constellation on the zodiacal belt. The other constellations range in this order: Aquarius, Leo, Pisces, Sagittarius, Taurus, Libra, Gemini, Cancer, Scorpius, Aries, and finally Capricorn. The early Celtic name for Virgo was the Sidos, "the deer," and fittingly, Libra was called AntoscIo, "the antIer." This constellation was abbreviated as Ind. in the Book 0/Ballymote . The constellation following the Maiden was termed the Serpent bearer a10ng with the snake, later replaced by Scorpio. Sagittarius was originally presented by a cavalier or mounted archer. The Wolf was the old Gaelic name for Aquarius and is weil represented on the Gundestrup Cauldron. Then came the usual names for the zodiacal signs: the Goat for Capricorn, the Fish for Pisces, the Ram for Aries, the Bull for Taurus, and the Twins for Gemini. The Crab along with the Asses were later denominations, there replacing Ekwos, the constellation of the Horse, also represented by a winged horse. Ecui Prinnios, "constellation ofthe horse," was the old Gallic name for this constellation. While Leo was seen as an asterism of the Deer constellation and hence designated as Elembos, "the fawn." Monard then came to the conclusion that the prototype for the twelve sign Zodiac of the second millennium was comprised of eight loosely distant groupings.

The Gundestrup Cauldron comprises ofthirteen individual panels, seven on the outside, five on the inner side, and one at the bottom. The five inner panels each seemingly depict a region ofthe night sky while the one on the bottom describes the asterisms ofthe greater constellation ofTaurus. Whilst, the seven outer plates illustrate the planets or wandering stars. What is important to retain is that the mythological imagery depicted on the Gundestrup Cauldron is of a cosmological order. Let' s assume that the Gundestrup Cauldron is a star chart and areminder ofthe macrocosm.
The flamboyantly decorated Gundestrup Cauldron is a unique example ofthe La Tene period silver work. It was most likely crafted at around 200 BCE in Thracia for a Dalmatian Celtic client as a sacred religious object and ended up in Danemark as a Cimbrian war prize. History shows that these Germanie tribes sacked the Scordician kingdom in 118 BCE.4
Fittingly, according to lrish mythology, one ofthe four ritual objects ofthe godly Tuatha D6 Danann was brought from Murias (Land ofthe Black Sea?). Ifwe are to extract any astronomical information from the Celtic cultural database, the way to go is through an in depth analysis and exegesis oftheir art, specifically that of numismatics and that ofthe Gundestrup Cauldron.
As for most Indo-European texts and iconographical depictions, the correct reading order is from left to right and top to bottom, or in earlier times, boustrophedon, as the ox plows, from a left to right and a right to left motion.
Gallic coinage of tbe Triviri depicting tbe ecliptic, sun, solar wheel, stars, planets and three cosmic rays.

The Gundestrup Cauldron Astronomical Plates - Iconography
Inner Panel One
1. A bull representing the "heat of the day," and Samoindon, "summer' send"
2. The Stag for Sidos, "deer," the fall constellations ofVirgo and Libra. The torque necklace in the sitting horned-gods right hand for Cantos, "ring," represents Cantli prinnios, the constellation ofLibra, literally meaning: "arborescence, or constellation, ofthe circle, ofbuckling, ofthe song, ofthe commemoration pillar."
3. The horned seated figure, Cernunnos, with the deer antlers for Libra, Scales, holding the serpent (the sub constellations of Serpens caput and cauda) for Scorpio.
4. A lion or leopard atop a wolf for the winter solstice period of twelve days. Dumanni Prinnios, the constellation of Sagittarius, literally standing for "arborescence of darkening."
5. A boy riding a sturgeon or a dolphin for Capricorn.
6. Two opposing lions for the vernal point, or spring equinox. A buH representing the return ofwarm days.
7. In the background, trefoil plants for the threefold aspects of nature; plants ending their annual growth cycle for Giamos / giemos < gemos, "winter;" connoting
8



"shoots," for vegetative; Güemorotlio > geamhradh, "shoots-cycle;" dark half-year (Autumn + winter-time) or vegetative period.
Inner Panel Two - The Sun Goddess Driving the Solar Chariot along the Sun's Patb
1. Two elephants flanking the sky goddess Belisama, or Brigantia / Brigindo, riding the solar chariot (with sun wheels). The opposing elephants represent festivals, moon fests, the lunar aspects ofthe goddess who bears the new sun. The elephants in Celtic : Oillpheist < Ollouetsis, "whoie, entire, all encompassing, animal," with the implied meaning of"big beast." Uetsis means a yearling in wordplay with uestis, "festivity session," in general.
2. Below are two opposing griffons for the North West and North East winds and a wolf for Ambiuolcaia, "lustrations," punning with "Lupercalia." Ambiuolcaia, or Imbiuolcaia (> Imboie) in Goidelic, literally means "surrounding, all around, the wolf biteh."

1. Taranis, the thundering night sky god of the Great Cosmic Wheel (called Swastika in Sanskrit and Ramaca Reta in Goidelic) or Sextandiriones, the stars of the Septentrion, is flanked to his right by Mogus Retios (> Mogh Ruith) with a bull-homed heImet.
2. Two leopards for winter or two brindled wolves; the Gaelic January month of wolves, an Faoilleach < *Uailiaca (from Irish, faol, "wolf," ualos "bad," and uailos "howler").
3. Three Griffins and the ram-headed serpent: the late winter and early winds blow towards April, the month of Cutios, meaning both: "of rams" and "stormy, windy." A third westbound wind griffon hints at the warm spring winds of Simiuisonios, "of the "flighty breeze," (Irish, gaoth deas, "south wind") in June.

Inner Panel Four - The Taurine Acme of Days
1. Three wild cats jumping over bulls with sword yielding warriors accompanied by dogs. The tripling effect is indicative of the Beltaine < Belotennia, "fires of Belos," celebrations in May.
2. The cats represent the three main stars ofHyades, Catosdirai, "Cat stars."
3. The three bulls are the stars of Giamoni Prinnios, the constellation of sprouts," punning with gammos, "ox." Taruos, "the Bull," also caBed Donnotaruos, the Dun BuB."
4. The Warriors, latios, pI. latioi, puns with latis, pI. lateies, "nychthemeron, and calendar days." The sword, Smertus, was the old Celtic name for Deneb, the alpha star of Cygnus, the Swan constellation.
5. The dogs, Cunes, are the stars ofCanis Major (Cumaros), Sirius, and Canis Minor (Cubeccos), Canicula, also for "dog days."
11



Inner Panel Five - The Cosmic March of the Astral Rulers
And the BaUle of Trees
Prennos, "tree;" for a cusp, a mathematical point marked by the House's ascendant; also uidus in Goidelic. A Coligny Calendar notation: prin., abb. ofprinnios. prinnion, "branching;" a zodiacal consteUation, a zodiacaJ period.
This plate, no doubt, epitomizes the cosmological mythic battle oftrees as exemplified in Livy and in the Welsh Cat Godeu attributed to Taliesin.
Livy's description of the Cisalpine Gaulish tree alphabet called Litana Uidua (Broad Forest) in Book XXIll, 24:
12



"After the election of the magistrates, the dictator returned to his army, which was in winter quarters at Teanum, leaving his master of the horse at Rome, to take the sense of the fathers relative to the armies to be enlisted and embodied for the service of the year, as he was about to enter upon the magistracy after a few days. While busily occupied with these matters, intelligence arrived of a fresh disaster - fortune crowding into this year one calamity after another -that Lucius Posthumius, consul elect, hirnself with all his army was destroyed in Gaul. He was to march his troops through a vast wood, which the Gauls called Litana.4 On the right and left of his route, the natives had sawed the trees in such a manner that they continued standing upright, but would fall when impelled by a slight force. Posthumius had with hirn two Roman legions, and besides had levied so great a number of allies along the Adriatic Sea, that he led into the enemy's country twenty-five thousand men. As soon as this army entered the wood, the Gauls, who were posted around its extreme skirts, pushed down the outermost of the sawn trees, which falling on those next them, and these again on others, which of themselves stood tottering and scarcely maintained their position, crushed arms, men, and horses in an indiscriminate manner, so that scarcely ten men escaped. For most of them being killed by the trunks and broken boughs of trees, the Gauls, who beset the wood on all sides in arms, killed the rest, panic-struck by so unexpected a disaster. A very small number, who attempted to escape by a bridge, were taken prisoners, being intercepted by the enemy who had taken possession of it before them. Here Posthumius fell, fighting with all his might to prevent his being taken. The Boii, having cut off his head, carried it and the spoils they stripped off his body, in triumph into the most sacred temple they had. Afterward, they cleaned the head according to their custom, and having covered the skull with chased gold, used it as a cup for libations in their solemn festivals, and a drinking cup for their high priests and other ministers of the temple. The spoils taken by the Gauls were not less than the victory. For though great numbers of the beasts were crushed by the falling trees, yet as nothing was scattered by flight, everything else was found strewed along the whole line ofthe prostrate band."

1. Top of the disc plate: the hero of days (latios "hero," punning with latis, "calendar day") jumping with the sword ofthe northern skies (Cygnus) accompanied by Sirius, the dog days star, chasing Cat Palug < Cattos Pallucos, the defective or customary cat," ofHyades.
2. The buH ofthe consteHation ofTaurus (horns were broken and missing from this plate) with the Triskelion star of Aldebaran on his forehead.
3. The cat star, the devourer of days, falling below Taurus after it was attacked by the dog and finished offby the hero's sword.
4. Out branching vine like plants covering the ground for Giamonios < Giiemonios, "of sprouts, shoots;" moon of AprillMay, from April (or of early May, if after the Ciallosbuis leap-month).
15



The Outer Plates - The Planets or Wandering Stars
Outer Panel One - Planet Mercury
Luctos I Luxtos "bright, assembly, gathering, troop, party, burden;" Luxstos "wanderer," for, "bright wandering (star)"
}j~;.;» ?r,: ...~~3 :""~:4'tC'
1. Middle section: god figure with a druidic tonsure holding twin heroes (Gemini) handling a boar piglet (Ursa Minor) and a boar-sow (Ursa Major). The Boar constellation, Eburos was one of the Gallic names for the Bears of Ursa Major and Minor.
2. On the God's right shoulder, a dog (Sirius), or maybe a wolf (Lupus), and on his left shoulder a winged horse (Cancer or probably Pegasus). Note that Sirius, the alpha star of Canis Major is found in the vicinity of Gemini and Cancer.
16



3. The planetary mler for Mercury was the god-king Lugus, "Iuminous" / Lugios, "desired" > lrish Lugh / Welsh Lleu.
Outer panel two - Planet Saturn
Nucturos Uosiros, "nocturnalloiterer / Meinos, "sluggish"
1. A god figure wearing a torque and a dmidic tonsure grasping twin dragons, the northem and southern lunar nodes.
2. Twin heroes devoured by a double boar-headed serpent representing the ecliptic.
3. The planetary mler for Satum was the god Samonios / Semonios, "sower" > Samhain, a brother of Cian and Goibniu in the Irish myths.
4. The Celtic year pJaced at the autumnal equinox began on the advent of the Samonios moon in November thus initiating the sequence ofthe signs ofthe Zodiac. The end of the season was marked by the time of darkening at Samoidon, wruch literalJy stands for "summery end ." lt occurred just before the moon of Samonios, for "ofthe sower, ofthe gathering." The day ofthe Celtic year
17



corresponded to our All-Saints day. The Eve of Samonios was formerly called Uegilia Samoni and was the beginning ofthe festivities that lasted three weeks. Samonios is a clever pUD as onJy the Druids could make. In fact, sarnon / semon., for "seed," bints at samos "summer." Therefore Samonios has several meanings including all things pertaining to the growing season and summer's fall. At tbis moment, aportal opened between the two worlds, that oftbe souls ofthe deceased and that of the living mortals. During tbis event were commemorated the gods the fallen heroes, and the ancestral spirits.

1. Amidst a ring of fire, the golden torqued Sun Queen is flanked by her twin heroes. In devotional gesture, her hands crossed over her breasts form the sun grid sign.
2. On her right shoulder, one combatting the monstrous cat who attacked the bull of days, and to her left, Maponos Belenos, the young solar god emerges from the Underworld. The sun god was called Grannos, "bearded, radiant, bright, and sunny one," Belinos, the deified Sun, "the Morning Sun."
3. The sun goddess was also called Suliuia, "the well-colored," and Sulis, the "eye."

To conclude, The Gudestrup Cauldron is a visual representation of the annual cycle and the skies depicting and charting the major constellations, stars, and planets, known to the Celts in early Antiquity. Truly, it is a compendium of the astronomical science of the Celtic Druids. Trus can be further corroborated by the study of imagery and symbolism displayed on Celtic coinage. Again, the cauldron's iconography perfectly agrees with linguistic data recovered from the Gallic Coligny Calendar and lrish Book 0/ Ballymote. And, as Jean Haudry exposed in an article entitled General Characteristics o/Indo European Religion, the Indo-European ideological mindset was basically cosmologica1. 7
