Montesquieu says: "II y a des choses quo tout le monde dit, parce

anything "because it has been said once," it is better to accept the
results of conscientious investigation.

PRE-HiSTORic NATIONS.
L
INTRODUCTORY GENERALITIES.
THE origin of man, and the date of his first appearance
on earth, have always been subjects of speculation. We see this in the cosmogonic myths and legends of antiquity, and in the dogmatic chronologies that have been allowed
currency in modern times ; but, so far as we know, it is
only in very recent times that visionary speculation on these topics has given way to enlightened inquiry. The cyclical schemes of the ancient Eastern world, which computed by tens of thousands and hundreds of thousands the years of man's existence on earth previous to the regular beginnings of history, may be treated with small ceremony now ; but they are quite as scientific as Archbishop Usher's scheme of chronology, for the men who invented them were skilful astronomers ; and whoever undertakes to show that they are not quite as reasonable, may discover that some
thing can be said on the other side of this question. These cyclical estimates of the past may turn out to be as near the truth as Usher's system of chronology, but neither the one nor the other can now be accepted as an
intelligent and truthful exposition of the antiquity of the human race. The whole tendency of scientific investigation and discovery, at the present time, is to class them to



10 Prc-Historic Nations.
gether as alike unwarranted and worthless. We moderns have underrated the antiquity of man. This is shown
more and more clearly in two departments of inquiry, where the greatest results are yet to be realized geology and the science of language. Conscientious geologists are
forced to say, " The date of man must be carried back farther than we had heretofore imagined ;" and accomplished scholars and thinkers respond from the field of linguistic
science, " Late discoveries are showing us that the antiquity of the human race upon earth must be much greater
than has been generally supposed." These two sciences bring important aid to the study of
pre-historic times, by compelling us to throw off the trammels of false chronologies, and by showing us room hi the
past for those great pre-historic developments of civilization, and those long pre-historic ages of human activity and enterprise, which are indicated by the oldest monuments,
records, and mythologies. It is impossible to study faith
fully the ancient mythologies, or the results of exploration in the oldest ruins, or the fragmentary records in which tin* ancients speak of what to them was misty antiquity, with
out feeling that, to accept all they signify, we must enlarge the past far beyond the limits of any scheme of chronology known to modern times. If we luck strength and boldiu to break down the barriers of unreason and pursue inquiry
with unfaltering reverence for truth, we may find refuge in the oracular cave of historical skepticism, where little or
nothing is seen, beyond the first Greek Olympiad save barbarism, lying fables, and general chaos. But human intelligence cannot remain imprisoned there, especially in this age, when so much is constantly added to our knowledge of the past, and when increasing means for a careful and



I
The Oldest Writings. 11
hopeful study of antiquity so stimulate inquiry as to make
it irrepressible. The oldest writings in existence are inscriptions found in the ancient ruins of Egypt and Southwestern Asia. The
oldest books, leaving out those of China, are those preserved by the Indian and Iranian branches of the Aryan family
the Rig-Veda, a translated fragment of the Desatir, and portions of the works of Zoroaster ; next to these come the Hebrew Scriptures ; then follow the works of Homer, and some other books and fragments of books, in the Greek language, representing the culture of the lonians of Asia Minor. These books show us the civilization of the com
munities in which they originated, but they do not tell us
when or where civilization first appeared. The mytholo
gies, the ruins, the discoveries of linguistic science, and the general voice of tradition, lead us to the conclusion that,
so far as relates to the Cushite, Semite, and Aryan races, its first appearance was somewhere in the southwestern part of Asia ; but we can not describe the agencies and
methods of its first development, nor give the date of its
origin.
We nowhere find a continued and permanent advancement of any nation or community of these races, but we see a constant progress of civilization from lower toward
higher degrees, from the few to the many, and from limited
and special toward many-sided and all-embracing development. Nations rise, flourish, and sink again to obscurity. The Egypt of to-day is not that Egypt which we see in the monuments of its Old Monarchy ; Chaldea is not now the ancient Chaldea which we study in its ruins; to-day we inquire in vain onthe coast of Asia Minor for that Ionian
confederacy whose marvelous culture, passing over into

the Hellenic peninsula, illumed Athens, and made that city the glory of Hellas. It is long since Carthage and Rome ceased to exist. But, while communities and nations have
disappeared, this old civilization has remained ; sometimes checked and lowered for a succession of ages, but always
reappearing with new developments of its forces and new forms. The Reverend Dr. Lang, in his " View of the Origin and
Migrations of the Polynesian Nation," is led by the subject to make this observation :
" In Tuscany and in Egypt. in India and in China, and, I will add, even in the South Sea Islands and in both Americas, we behold the evidences
of a primitive civilization, which, in some instances, had run its course anterior to the age of Homer, but which, at
all events, acknowledged no obligation to the wisdom or
refinement of the Greeks." Few will question the fact he
states, so far as relates to Italy and Asia, although not many who carefully study the past will describe all that civilization as "primitive." Dr. Lang himself is not quite
satisfied with this description ; for, in attempting to explain the origin of the ancient civilization which had near
ly run its course in different countries previous to the time
of Homer, he adopts the notion of Bailly and others, that it was originated by the antediluvians, and brought through the Deluge to their successors by the family of Noah.
Without fully exploring it, he saw a fact that was much too large for his chronology a fact for which there was
not sufficient room in the past, as he measured it.
The great civilization, so apparent in various nations of antiquity that present themselves to view just beyond the borders of regular history, was not the work of a single !e nor of a single period of national existence. Those



Whence came Civilization? 13
nations were preceded by others no less great and important, although more hidden from observation by their great
er distance from us in time. The civilization of the Phoenician!, Egyptians, and other nations of the East passed to
the Greeks, the Romans, and the magnificent empire of the Caliphs, making some losses and receiving new developments. Without speaking of what we received from the
Kelts, whose civilization was greater than history has admitted, the civilization of modern Europe has grown partly out of that of Greece and Rome, and also out of that of the Saracens to a much greater extent than is generally
recognised. So has the mental and social cultivation, first
seen in Western Asia, flowed on through the ages, from
people to people, from the civilizers of Egypt, Chaldea, and India to Europe and America, never defeated entirely,
and always surviving the " dark Cages'' that obscured it.
We have the highest and widest development it has ever reached. To find its starting-point and write its early history, we must be able to explore the obscurest deeps of
antiquity. And yet what seems in these inquiries to be the obscurest antiquity becomes extremely modern when considered in connection with what geology says of the antiquity of man. Those familiar with the later discoveries of this sci
ence know how slowly, and against what persistency of
incredulity and doubt, geologists themselves have been brought to admit the evidence which shows the existence
of the human race in the latter part of the geological period which Lyell and others describe as Post-pliocene. This
period, which next precedes the " Recent," or that in which, we live, seems as modern as yesterday in relation to the countless geological ages that went before it; but some



14 Pre-Historic Nations. '
tentative efforts at computation make us feel how far away
it is from yesterday. Sir Charles LyelFs lowest estimate of the time required to form the present delta and alluvial
plain of the Mississippi is more than 100,000 years, It belongs almost wholly to the Recent period. The lower portion of the peninsula of Florida has been created by a constant growth of coral reefs toward the south, and this
growth is still in full activity. "The whole is of Post-ter
tiary origin," say Agassiz and Lyell, " the fossil zoophytes and shells being all of the same species as those now in
habiting the neighboring sea ;" that is to say, the commencement of the growth was later than the beginning of
the Post-pliocene formation, and probably not much older than the beginning of the Recent period. Agassiz, having ascertained as nearly as possible the average rate of this coral growth, estimates that the gradual formation of the southern half of Florida must have filled a period of not less than 135*000 years.
It is no part of my purpose to discuss geological questions. The questions presented in this volume, and the conclusions reached, do not in any way depend on geological estimates of past time. It may, however, be obse that the discoveries of geology show plainly that the pre
historic ages in Western Europe were not wholly barbarous. They show us the remains of a very remote "Age of
Stone," in which there is no trace of civilization; but they
also bring to light manufactured articles, sepulchral customs, and old structures, the remains of other remote ages
when civilized peoples inhabited that part of Europe; such are the monuments of the "Age of Polished Stone" and the "Age of Bronze." Western Europe has its an
cient ruins that invite careful study. Its antiquities of

this kind are not as grand as those at the East, although the old temple at Abury was not destitute of grandeur in
the days of its glory. They have nothing to rival the amazing architecture or the multitudinous inscriptions found in the old ruins of Egypt and Chaldea, but they
show us remains of civilized peoples of whom history gives no account. We must turn to Asia to discover the earliest manifesta
tions of civilized life, and ascertain how far they can be traced back into the past. Here we see two great devel
opments of ancient civilization, entirely disconnected from each other, and, so far as we can see, nearly equal in age. The origin of each is hidden by the shadows of very re
mote antiquity. At the East is China, with literary records claiming to be more than nineteen centuries older than the Christian era, and with a culture in science, in
dustry, literature, and the arts of civilized life scarcely inferior to that of the most enlightened nations that have appeared in history. Tried by the standards of modern Eu
rope, it takes a very high place in the respect and admiration of those best acquainted with it. Professor Whitney,
in his " Language and the Study of Language," says very
justly, "No race, certainly, outside the Indo-European and Semitic families, and not many races of those families, can show a literature of equal value with the Chinese." This Chinese culture is one of the most remarkable facts in the world's history. Instead of passing from nation to
nation, and taking new forces and new forms in a grand progress round the globe, it has neither wandered far from
home, nor shown any remarkable variety of development. It has remained chiefly in the country where it grew up,
and in the hands of the people by whom it was originated

dwelling apart from what we call history, as if China were a world by itself. At the West arose another civilization, that seems to hare originated somewhere near the waters of the Persian Gulf and Indian Ocean. Unlike the Chinese in character and
history, it was enterprising ; it went forth into the world ; it established communication with all peoples within its reach ; it colonized and occupied other lands ; its influence
became paramount " from the extremity of the East to the extremity of the West ;" it changed its seat from nation to
nation, ever developing, more and more, a wonderful power of life; it created India and Egypt; its light was kindled all around the Mediterranean ; and, finally, by way of Western Europe, it travelled to America, where it seems likely to have its widest and richest development.
It is not in our power to explain with certainty those primitive groupings of mankind which determined the origin of diverse races, and created distinct families of lan
guage. The diverse races exist, although, at the present time, there are not anywhere on the face of the globe many communities where any original race is found entirely free from mixture with some other; and the separate families
of language exist, so radically and absolutely unlike that we find it impossible to believe they all proceeded from a common source. The essential unity of mankind in all the
peculiar characteristics of humanity is an incontestable
fact which cannot be affected by any differences of race
or language. Whatever theory denies this fact, or makes
it uncertain, is false to human nature, as it appears and speaks for itself in every race and in every language. This is not questioned by those who attempt to solve the prob-, lem by adopting the hypothesis that the human race came



Hebrew Tradition concerning Three Races. 17
into existence, originally, at different points on the earth, by simultaneous or successive creations, each primordial
group being the source of a separate race and a separate
family of languages. Those primeval traditions of the Hebrews, which Moses deemed truthful and worthy of record in the sacred books
of his nation, relate almost entirely to the Semitic, Cush
ite, and Aryan families, which, on any hypothesis, must
have had a common origin. Their languages constitute three distinct families, for linguistic scholars are making
the discovery that the Cushite tongues are a family by themselves, although they more closely resemble the Semitic language than that of the Aryan race. Neither of
these families differs from the others as they all differ from
the Chinese. Between these three races there is no physiological difference whatever ; and their differences in other
respects are not so great as to exclude entirely the possi
bility of their having issued from a common primordial
source, and separated in the early infancy of their first dialects. They have played connected parts in the work of
human development ; and now the Aryan race, enriched with the acquisitions of their combined influence, seems destined to possess and rule the whole planet on which wo
live. The Cushite race appeared first in the work of civiliza
tion. That this has not always been distinctly perceived is due chiefly to the fact that the first grand ages of that
race are so distant from us in time, so far beyond the great
nations of antiquity commonly mentioned in our ancient histories, that their most indelible traces have long been too much obscured by the waste of time to be readily comprehended by superficial observation. In the earliest He

brew traditions, older probably than Abraham, and imme
diately connected with a description of the " land of Eden,"
where " the Lord God planted a garden" for Adam, Cush
(translated Ethiopia) is mentioned as a country or geographical division of the earth ; the" Hebrews saw nothing geographical more ancient than this land of Cush. In the
tenth chapter of Genesis, the names recorded are professed
ly used, for the most part, as ethnical and geographical des
ignations ; but this ethnical geography of Genesis, which,
excepting the interpolations, was probably more ancient than even the Hebrews themselves understood, must be referred to a period anterior to that great immigration of
Cushites from J\rabia into the valley of Mesopotamia, the primeval home of the Semites, which brought civilization and gave existence to the old cities of Chaldea.
It seems to me impossible for any free-minded scholar
to study the traditions, mythologies, fragmentary records, mouldering monuments, and other remains of the pre-historic ages, and fail to see that the people described in the
Hebrew Scriptures as Cushites were the original civilizers of Southwestern Asia ; and that, in the deepest antiquity, their influence was established in nearly all the coast regions, from the extreme east to the extreme west of the Old World. This has been repeatedly pointed out with more or less clearness, and it is one of those incontestable facts
that must be accepted. In nearly all the recorded investi
gations of scholars for the last two centuries, it lias ap
peared among those half-seen facts which dogmatic criticism
could treat as fancies without troubling itself to explain them. It could not be otherwise ; for, to see and fully
comprehend the significance of Cushite antiquity, we must have greater freedom in the matter of chronology, an I a

more accurate perception of the historic importance of Ara
bia, than have usuully appeared in such investigations. Neither Usher's chronology, nor the little country known to the Greeks and Romans as Phosnicia, will suffice to explain that mighty and wide-spread influence of the Cushite race in human affairs, whose traces are still visible from
Farther India to Norway. Here, as well as everywhere else in the' advancement of
learning from the old to the new, from the explored to the unexplored, the investigator must settle his relations with the professional conservatism of what passes current as
" orthodox" scholarship. This conservatism, like all other conservatisms, has its eminent oracles, whose influence is too frequently allowed to limit inquiry and shape its re
sults. It is less malignant than some other conservatisms, but no less self-assured, and no less ready to chastise bold
inquiry. In the history of mankind, it has been common to see wig mistaken for wisdom, while authority usurped the place of reason ; but nothing else has the force of truth ; it may wait for recognition, like Boucher de Perthes on the
field of geological science, and, while waiting, be rudely treated as a visionary ; yet it will surely sweep all obstructions out of its way, and constrain the oracles to pronounce
in its favor.
The influence of what is accepted as " orthodox" learning sometimes deals very summarily with both the work and the reputation of venturesome innovators, who flout its or
acles, question its wisdom, criticise its methods, and undertake to show that important additions can be made to its stock of knowledge. Controversies with such all-wise con
servatism, however, are incident to all inquiry by which progress is maintained. Each profession instinctively dis

allows and resists any interference with its established
creed, and becomes a castle where the old is vigorously
defended against the new. So it is in theology, in law, in
politics, in medicine, in science of every kind, and in every
department of learning. \Ve can not reasonably expect our archaeological and historical studies to escape this in
fluence; nor should we very much desire it. If conservatism needs movement, innovation needs to adjust its rela
tions with whatever truth is already established. The innovator proceeds by means of the sharpest methods of criticism; therefore he can afford to endure criticism.
Soon or late, whatever investigations sweep away venerable rubbish and open the way to progress in knowledge will enforce their claim to respectful consideration ; and
nowhere is this surer to be realized than among enlightened scholars,' where no ardor of feeling can become fanat
icism, nor any prejudice or pride of opinion be transformed into cureless bigotry. One purpose of this volume is to point out what may be known of the ancient Cushite people, and of the great part
they played in developing and spreading civilization. In doing this, it becomes necessary to criticise and discredit some influential theories, speculations, and methods of investigation, which I find to be obstructions in the path of
inquiry; and also to show that Usher's chronology is a very false measure of the past, that the antiquity of the human race is much greater than he supposed, and that
there can be no intelligent study of antiquity where his or any similar scheme of chronology, or any other dogmatic falsification of the past, is allowed to paralyze inquiry and
dictate conclusions. I do not write for learned archaeologists. They have

written for me. It is possible, however, that those most
deeply learned in archaeology and the science of language may find in this volume suggestions worthy of their attention. Perhaps it will enable them to discover a, more
satisfactory solution of certain ethnical and linguistic prob
lems with which they are familiar. It can hardly fail to
do this if it shall succeed in convincing them that the
original Ethiopia was not in Africa, and that the ancient
home of the Cushites or Ethiopians, the starting-point of their great colonizing and civilizing movements, was Arabia. I do not write for historical skeptics. Their use of
reason is so poor and their credulity so great, when they deal with antiquity, that no common influence is likely to
break the spell that makes them incapable of looking wise
ly into the past, and studying pre-historic times with any
hope of enlightenment. Their habit of accepting preposterous and monstrous absurdities, in order to deny the his
torical significance of myths and traditions, and discredit
the discoveries of linguistic and archaBological science, must be left to play out its comedy without interference.
Others, whose interest in these studies may be stimula
ted anew, or for the first time awakened, by reading this
work, will perhaps desire to pursue the subject in a more minute and elaborate way. If so, they can find in the
works of German, Danish, French, and English explorers and scholars abundant materials to aid investigation ; and
in the department of linguistic science, which in these inquiries is of the highest importance, there are very valua
ble works by several American scholars, such as Whitney,
Marsh, and others. On looking over what I have written, I find that I have criticised many of the linguistic and arch
aeological theories of that eminent and accomplished inves

tigator, Ernest Renan, without properly expressing my sense of his great services in these departments of science.
If his works relating to the subjects I discuss were not so
rich and attractive, or if his style of writing were not so
perspicuous and eloquent, it may be that I should have
given him less attention.

PRELIMINARY SUGGESTIONS CONCERNING THE CURRENT CHRONOLOGIES, THE RELATION OF HELLAS TO CIVILIZA
TION, AND THE MEANING OF PRE-HISTORIC TIMES.
HUMBOLDT says in his Cosmos, " What we usually term
the beginning of history is only the period when the later generations awoke to self-consciousness." It requires an enlightened view of the past and considerable mental free
dom to see and accept what this signifies; but the ten
dency of scientific studies at the present time is to make
it clear and establish it as a commonly accepted truth. Our studies of Ancient History have been embarrassed by two strong but not very wise influences a false chronology, and a false estimate of the Hellenic people in their re
lation to civilization. These influences have been sup
ported until lately by the theological training and the scholarship of modern times, and they have mutually supported each other; for those who maintain that enlight
ened civilization began in Hellas very easily accept the rabbinical notion that man was created only about 4000 or 5000 years previous to the Christian Era, while those
who uphold this unwarranted system of chronology very readily accept the belief that mankind did not get far away from barbarism previous to the literary and artistic devel
opment that brightened Athens. It is impossible to think correctly of the past, or to comprehend the testimony of its monuments, where these views are received as infallible



24 Pre-Historic Nations.
oracles and allowed to regulate investigation ; therefore it
seems necessary to make them the subject of few preliminary observations.
THE CURRENT CHRONOLOGIES.
Rollin, writing Ancient History, and giving his view of the time and greatness of Ninits and Semiramis, whom lie described as the immediate successors of the first founder of the Assyrian empire, made this confession : "I must own
that I am somewhat puzzled by a difficulty that may be raised against the extraordinary tilings related of Ninus and Semiramis, as they do not seem to agree with tin: near the Deluge; I mean such immense armies, such a numerous cavalry, and such vast treasures of gold and silver, all of which seem to be of later date." According to Rol
lin's chronology, the Assyrian empire began its great career 2234 years before Christ, or about 115 years after the Deiugc, and 235 years previous to the death of Noah. The
Hebrew Scriptures inform us that " Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years." Rollin never doubt
ed this record, and did not revise his chronology. Therefore he must have believed (although lie carefully avoided saying so) that Noah outlived the founders of that empire,
and saw its progress and grandeur during more than two centuries. It is not surprising that he was puzzled by
chronological difficulties. His system afforded no relief from them. It is true that in writing of Ninus and Semiramis he followed that ready fabler, the Carian physician
Ctesias, The first princes of the celebrated Assyrian mon
archy lived nearly a thousand years later. The great em
pire existing in that part of Asia at the date given by Rollin was Chaldean ; but there is nothing in this to re



Chronological Embarrassments. 25
move his perplexity, and later researches afford it no relief, for it is now certain that there were great monarchies in Asia much older than the year 2234 B.C. Such embarrassments as that felt by Rollin multiply as we increase our knowledge of ancient times by a more care
ful study of the mythologies and traditions of the ancients, by investigating the monumental records of the older na
tions, by exploring the oldest ruins (the oldest now, because others that were much older have gone to dust), by
comprehending the great revelations of linguistic science, and by searching intelligently the memorials of past time presented in the discoveries of geology. The absurd chro
nology by which they are created, not capable of serving as a guide, becomes an obstruction that must be removed. Could we have the literary records of all the pre-historic
nations, or even the lost libraries of the Phoenicians, Chal
deans, and Egyptians, its most confident supporters would become ashamed to urge its claim to respect, and scholars everywhere would hasten to disown the absurdities it has
introduced into Ancient History. As it is, enough is known,
without calling in the testimony of geology, to show that the period between the creation of man and the birth of Christ is much longer than any of the current chronologies are able to measure.
I can not wonder at the amazement, trepidation, and even rage with which some of the dogmatic chronologists behold the revelations of geology. My purpose, however, does not require an appeal to what geology says of the antiquity of man. It is manifest, without such aid, that the time between the beginning of the. human race and the Christian Era may have been, as Bunsen maintained in his
work on Egypt, five times 4004 years, and even much Ion

ger than Bunsen supposed. The great past was certainly long enough for all that human existence and activity iu
pre-historic ages of which so many traces are found. There
is nothing to require, indicate, or suggest that the current chronologies should be treated with the smallest degree of
respect, while, on the other hand, there is much that de
mands for the pre-historic ages the longest measure intel
ligent inquiry has ever proposed. The business of constructing systems of "biblical" chro
nology has furnished employment for a large amount of learned ingenuity which otherwise might have been led to
tvrite great folios on the word " Selah" in the Psalms, or
to expound the natural history of ancient giants, or to in
terpret in a very marvelous way the prophetic mysteries of the Apocalypse. It has been chiefly the work of monks and rabbins, and its relation to historical science is very
much like that of conjuring astrology to the science of as
tronomy. But it is not wholly useless. It lias undoubt
edly furnished many satisfactions to those whose calling
did not afford a more profitable occupation for intellectual activity, or whose learning had not introduced them to a
more enlightened study of antiquity. The authority of what is falsely called "biblical" chronology is no !<.
very potent. It can not maintain itself against thai progress of science which constantly increases our knowledge
of the past. It must soon disappear, and take its place in the rubbish of the ages with other legendary absurdities which in their time dishonored religion, oppressed the hu
man intellect, and misled honest people by claiming immortal reverence.
Any system of chronology that places the creation of man only about 4000 or 5000 years previous to the birth

of Christ is a mere invention, a scholastic fancy, an elaborate absurdity. There is nothing to warrant it, and not much to excuse it. Those who profess to find it in the
Bible misuse and falsify that book. We may as well seek
in the Bible for a perfected science of astronomy or chem
istry. It is not there ; and no such chronological scheme
ever grew out of scientific inquiry. Moreover, there is a remarkable want of harmony among those who have constructed such schemes. The various systems of "biblical" chronology claiming attention are at variance among them
selves. According to the Jewish rabbins, man was created 3761 years before Christ ; the Greek and Armenian churches have been taught to say 5509 years; Eusebius said
5200 ; Panadoras, a learned Egyptian monk, having solved the problem, with great care and exactness of demonstration, said 5493 ; we and the nations of Western Europe
have followed Usher, a romancing archbishop of Ar
magh, who maintained, with great particularity of dogmatic demonstration, that the human race began to exist on earth precisely 4004 years before Christ; others have*
argued, with ingenuity quite as marvelous, to establish the validity of figures different from any of these.
In all these attempts to construct systems of " biblical"
chronology, nothing is more apparent than utter lack of scientific method and purpose. The aim has been, not to
discover facts, allow their influence, and accept the result, but to compel facts to harmonize with a preconceived the
ory and support g^iven conclusions. A point has been as
sumed in the past beyond which the date of man's first appearance on earth must not be carried ; and this assump
tion, not having the support of science, has feloniously sought that of revelation. Thus chronological dogmatism

has perpetrated an atrocious outrage on the Bible by im
piously claiming for itself the reverence due to religion.
Even learned and religious men have sought to identify
this false chronology with Christianity itself, and have pur
sued their investigations of antiquity with a purpose, de
liberately expressed, to force every fact of science, and every date of ancient history, to agree with it. Maurice's "Indian Antiquities," and his "Ancient History of Hindustan," are valuable works. They were first published about eighty years ago, but no one can read them now without
respect for the author's learning and ability; yet the- style
in which he upheld this dogmatism of the " biblical" chro
nologists is nowise likely to be imitated at the present nimby any scholar having the same enthusiasm for archaeolog
ical researches. In his preface to the "Antiquities" he wrote thus :
"The daring assertions of certain skeptical French phi
losophers with respect to the age of the world (whose arguments I have attempted to refute arguments founded principally on the high assumptions of the Brahmins ami other Eastern nations in point of chronology and astrono
my), could their extravagant claims be substantiated, would have a direct tendency to overturn the Mosaic system, ami
with it Christianity." In his first volume of the ''His
tory," on page 2V6, he renewed the subject as follow
am not inclined violently to dispute any positions on this head (chronology) that do not tend to subvert the Mosaic
chronology, and I am decidedly for allowing the Eastern historians, as a privilege, the utmost latitude of the Septuagint chronology. It is not for a century or two, more or less, that we wage the contest with infidelity, but we cannot allow of thousands and millions being thrown into the scale."



A Crime against Christianity. 29
There was a time when it was deemed a sacred and in
contestable proposition that Hebrew, given by miraculous
inspiration, was the original language of mankind, and the primeval mother of all other languages. To assume, as a vital thing in religion, that linguistic inquiry must not be
allowed to show any thing contrary to this proposition, would be just as rational as this violent assumption of
Maurice in behalf of what he calls the " Mosaic" system of
chronology ; and yet with what lordly arrogance of au
thority his " Mosaic" system was set forth ! It would con
descendingly allow its own largest limits " as a privilege," but facts must take care to exist in submissive accordance
with its permission, or they would be treated as infidel
heresies, for inquiry can have no legitimate aim but to show
its infallibility !
What crimes against Christianity have been committed by some of its zealous friends ! and not the least $f these
crimes is that which makes it responsible for such follies as this. Nothing can be more unwarranted than to assume
that any scheme of chronology is " Mosaic" or " biblical ;"
nor does it seem possible to do infidelity a greater service
than to use Christianity as the antagonist of honest inquiry and intelligent progress in knowledge, or to talk as if she were not sufficiently great and comprehensive to Avear her crown of glory in presence of any development of science or any progress of civilization. Modern astronomical discoveries were at first treated as grave heresies that should
be supposed by the Inquisition. Geology, the most reverent of sciences, has been treated as an infidel. It is not
surprising that discovdtfes relating to pre-historic times, which set aside the current chronologies, have encountered
similar criticism ; but it would be very surprising if this



30 Prc-IRstoriG Nations.
unchristian dogmatism could maintain itself anywhere
much longer. At any rate, truth is not discovered by such methods as that indicated by Maurice. There are many considerations which should have checked the confidence with which dogmatic chronology lias
limited and falsified the past. The origin of nearly every
thing in our civilization is lost in the obscurity of ages that
go back far beyond the oldest historic period. The arts
of writing, building, spinning, weaving, mining, and working metals in a word, nearly all the arts and appliances of civilized life, came to us from pre-historic times. They
were brought to Europe chiefly by the people known in history as Phoenicians, or through their agency; but, as I have already stated, neither history nor tradition can tell us when or where they originated. Evidence of the riches and magnificence they had created in very remote
abound^ in the records, ruins, and other remains of antiq
uity, but neither Chaldea nor Egypt could give a clear ac
count of their beginnings and early history. One thing, however, is certain: they indicate the existence, in pro-historic times beyond the reach 'of tradition, not only of civilized communities and nations, but also of long periods of
civilized life; and they give special significance to such statements of the old writers as the following from Diodorus Siculus: "Asia was anciently governed by its own native kings, of whom there is no history extant, either as to any memorable actions they performed, or so much as their
names." He says this at the beginning of his attount of
Ninus, and applies it to the ages preceding Nineveh and
Babylon, The great antiquity of some of the sciences is incontestable. If there were no monumental records of ancient Chal



Antiquity of Civilisation and Science. 31
dea, Egypt, Arabia, and India, we should still have convincing evidence of their great attainments in that knowledge
which was " the excellency of the Chaldees" and " the wis
dom of the Egyptians ;" Euclid, an Egyptian, would still be recognised as one of the foremost writers on geometry,
and WTC should find it necessary to refer the origin of the science to an age more ancient than the oldest date of even
Egyptian chronology. At the same time, it could be shown by authentic quotations from the literary remains of antiquity that some of the scholars of Ionia, which preceded
Hellas in civilization, taught by the PhcBnicians, Egyptians, and Chaldeans, had a knowledge of astronomy and of other sciences that was not retained by the scholars of Hellas, and seems to have disappeared from the Grecian world with
the disciples of Pythagoras. The most ancient peoples of antiquity, at the earliest periods in which we can see and study them, show us thifc civilization was older than their time. It is apparent in
their architecture, in the varied possessions and manifesta
tions of their civilized life, in their riches and magnificence,
and in the splendor of their temples and royal palaces, that they had many of the arts and sciences, which we deem
modern. Meanwhile, we can not easily deny their great attainments in astronomy, in presence of the general admission that the sphere filled with constellations, and the zodiac with its twelve signs, are at least as old as the Chal
deans. Humboldt, stating the result of inquiry on this
point, says : " The division of the ecliptic into twelve parts originated with the ancient Chaldeans." They had the zo
diac, and gave it to the Western countries. So much is easily seen. But the Chaldeans themselves may have received the zodiac from the-more ancient civilizers of their country.



32 Pre-Historic Nations.
During the present century, much has been added to our
knowledge of the past by exploration in the ruins of Egypt and Chaldea, The researches in Egypt have given us dates as authentic as the monuments themselves, which confound the current chronologies, and open the past to our view somewhat as the discoveries of Columbus opened the world
to the geographers of modern*Europe. It is now as certain as anything else in ancient history that Egypt existed
as a civilized country not less than 5000 years earlier than
the birth of Christ. The monumental and sepulchral records of that country, marvelous! v abundant, have substan
tially confirmed Manctho's history of Egypt. Tin-re mm never any good reason for doubting the correctness of his
dynastic list, as prepared by himself, lie was an Egyptian of great learning and wisdom; he wrote with the libraries and monuments of Egypt before him; his dates are as au
thentic as those of any other historian; ar.d the only ob
jection to them, of any account, comes from the dogmatism of that false chronology which assumes with oracular con
fidence that the past has not room for such dates. We meet here, much less awful than formerly, the same blind
arrogance of old prejudice that could see nothing but heresy in the astronomical discoveries of Galileo. But prejudice
is not reason ; false chronology is neither science nor religion ; and the lesson of every age is, that sure defeat awaits
those who forbid progress in knowledge, and employ against it the menaces of any tribunal of intolerance.
The magnificent discoveries in Egypt, by confirming Manetho's history, have seriously troubled this dogmatism. How can it allow that Menes, who first united all Egypt
under one government, began his reign not less than 3893
years previous to the Christian Era? And where can it



Egypt and the Chronologists. 33
find respectable logic to discredit such dates against the
evidence by which they are supported ? It is amusing to observe the effect of these discoveries on certain eminent and admirable English scholars who have given much attention to studies of this kind, one of them being an accom
plished Egyptologist. They cannot deny the facts, and have no inclination to deny them ; but their Oxford and English Church associations seem to have interfered to
prevent a frank acceptance of the incontestable antiquity the Old Monarchy of Egypt. For a time they sought to reconcile it with the current chronology which orthodox
churchmen hold in great reverence. When this became
impossible, and compelled their acknowledgment of the impossibility, they adopted silence as the best policy under the circumstances, intimating that they could not solve this Egyptian problem in a satisfactory manner. Meaner men can sneer, deny violently, falsify the record, and, with
godless infatuation, denounce the whole investigation as "business fit only for infidels." Christianity must be di
vine, for it is able to survive the championship of these meaner men.
It will not be questioned that blind reverence for this
false method of chronology has been very powerful to discredit facts and dates against which there could be no val
id argument, solely on the ground that they seemed disastrous to its authority. It has controlled the judgment of learned and conscientious men more than they could admit to themselves more than will seem credible a few centu
ries hence, when its character will be explained chiefly by recollection of its absurdities. It comes into every archaeo
logical investigation, to mislead inquiry and hide the true
explanation of every fact that implies great antiquity, too

frequently sure of success because it has been incorporated
with the investigator's thought and imagination from the moment when he began to think and acquire knowledge. Its influence grows weaker every day, and yet those who
are sufficiently free in thought to disregard it entirely frequently find it moving them to utter apologies for doing so.
A free-minded and accomplished archaeologist, speaking of the dates furnished by the chronology of Egypt (Revue
des Deux Mondes, tome Ivi., p. 666), says : "I know how
appalling these figures are, and what grave apprehensions* they awaken. I have shared these apprehensions ; but
what can we do against the concurring lists furnished by
.Mmietho, Eratosthenes, the Turin papyrus, and the Egyptian tablets of Abydos, Thebes, and Sakkara V" This tone
of apology may have some good use, perhaps, but does it
express anything that can actually be found in his own conviction or feeling ? Such dates can alarm nothing but false chronology, for which he cannot feel much concern.
Instead of being hostile to any thing else in which a hu
man interest is possible, they are friendly and full of satis
factions.
It seems astonishing that the authority of false chronology should ever have been sufficient to secure toleration
for some of the absurdities it has originated. Take, for in
stance, its very surprising representations concerning the time of Zoroaster. It was necessary to recognise Zor
ter as a real personage, representing a great religious epoch of the Iranian people. It was seen that all accounts of him
placed the time of his appearance far back in the past, the Greeks saying that he lived 5000 years before the Trojan War, and 6000 years before the death of Plato. But facts
must not be stubborn, for here, as everywhere else, the cur



Absurdities of false Chronology. 35
rent chronology, being supreme, must read the testimony and construe the facts in its own way ; therefore it was assumed falsely that Zoroaster lived in the sixth century be
fore Christ, during the reign of Darius Hystaspes, or during that of his father, who, as we know, was not a king, and
never reigned at all. And this absurdity, already inex
pressible, was heightened by a miraculous operation of
" Mosaic" zeal, which transformed the great Iranian teacher into a Jew. The Rev. Drs. Hyde and Prideaux (the
former in his " Veterum Persarum et Medorum Religionis
Historia," and the latter in his " Connexions"), with sol
emn gravity befitting the wonderful announcement, represented Zoroaster as a native of Palestine, born of Jewish parents, who first appeared in Persia as a menial servant in the families of Ezra and Daniel. Here was brilliancy almost equal to that of a Rev. Dr.
Joshua Barnes, of the last century, who published an elaborate work to prove that Solomon wrote the Iliad.* It is not common to see Zoroaster transformed into a Jew, even by those wno refuse to see that he lived many ages before Abraham. Even a hundred and seventy years ago, when
Dr. Hyde wrote, not many " biblical" chronologists were
" Mosaic" to this extent. Anquetil du Perron, and others
who followed him, adhered to the incongruous chronological dicta already established, although larger information should have qualified them to apply the proper criticism
and present a more intelligent vlfew of Iranian antiquity.
* Scientific investigation is accustomed to the remarkable brilliancies of this kind of learned acumen. Dr. Hitchcock says in a work on Geol
ogy :
' ' Felix Plater, professor of anatomy at Basle, referred the bones of an elephant found at Lucerne to a giant at least 19 feet high, and in England similar bones were regarded as those of the fallen angels !"



'><> Pre-Historic Nations.
According to the Desatir, the Dabistan, and the old Iranian histories, there was a great king of that branch of the
Aryan people known as Kai Khusro, who was a prophet
and an ascetic. He had no children, and after " a glorious reign of sixty years" he abdicated in favor of a subordinate
prince named Lohorasp, also an ascetic, who, after a long
reign, resigned the throne to his son Gushtasp. It was during the reign of Gushtasp that Zoroaster appeared. Gushtasp was succeeded by Bahman, his grandson ; Bah
man by Darab, who was slain by rebels ; and Darab by Sekander, who restored order and became famous in Iranian
history. Tljese were not kings of Persia; they reigned at Balkh, and HVCM! many centuries before Persia became- an
independent kingdom. The Desatir calls their realm the
kingdom of Hiras, and their people the Hirasis, names that seem to be modifications of the word Arya. All this implied that the time of Zoroaster was far away
in the past. The current chronologies were " frightened" at the mention of its possible distance from us.| Such an
tiquity must be disallowed; therefore the kingdom of Hiras was transformed into the kingdom of Persia, Kai Khus
ro into Cyrus the Great, and Gushtasp into Darius II \
pes or his father. And why was this, done ? The answer
is, " Because this period is less subject to chronological difficulties than many others." This is the only reason that
can be given for a stupidity that is wellnigh matchless. The chronological system used does not allow room in the past for the true period. The time of Darius Hystas]>r< or his father is the best it can afford, although the true period may have been several millenniums previous to that
time. It was certainly many ages before either Media or Pgrsia was heard of as a distinct nation. The kingdom of



Our Chronologies and China. -J7
Hiras belongs to re-mote ages previous to Babylon and Assyria, and, it may be, previous to Chaldea and Egypt, so far as relates to its origin and the first periods of its history. The time has come when our current chronologies must more definitely adjust their relations with the history of China. This has already been attempted without satisfactory results, and there have been efforts to discredit the
great antiquity implied by the civilization and literary records of that country. It is nowise likely that a more complete acquaintance with Chinese historical literature will make the task easier. It seems evident now that actual
harmony between our chronology and Chinese antiquity is impossible. Heretofore we have seen China from a dis
tance, heard reports of its civilization from mariners and merchants who have been permitted to visit some of its ports, from missionaries who have seen something of the interior, and from embassies that have seen its magnificent roads and its royal court ; and Chinese books collected and
brought to Europe have engaged the attention of scholars. But the commercial intercourse with Eastern Asia now opening across the Pacific begins a new era in the history of the world, and China, withdrawn from a seclusion no
longer possible, will become as familiarly known to us as any other cultivated nation with which we have inter
course.
It is impossible to deny the vast antiquity of that country without using methods of criticism that would destroy
the credibility of all history. Litse, an eminent Chinese
historian, after describing the fabulous and mythical ages,
comes to " the reigns of men" during long periods of time of which there is no chronology, although some knowledge of those old rulers is recorded. One of them, named Sui

shin, " took observations of the stars, and investigated the
five elements." 'Next come the " Five Rulers," who are
mythical representatives of historical epochs in " the period before Yao." They arc named as follows : 1. Fu-hi,
who cultivated astronomy, religion, and the art of writing, and whose dynasty consisted of fifteen kings : he repre
sents a great epoch in Chinese history; 2. Shin-nung, who promoted agriculture and medical science, and had a line
of successors. 3. Hoang-ti, a great sovereign, who put down a revolt, and in whose time the magnetic needle was discovered, the written character improved, and many ap
pliances of civilized life carried to greater perfection ; the 4th and 5th of these "Rulers," or heads of dynasties, were descendants of Hoang-ti. The "Five Rulers" were followed by the second period, called "the period of Yao and
Shin." Next came the period of the " Imperial Dyna>
which be^an with the Emperor Yu, or Ta-yu, the great and good Yu. The great historical work of Sse-ma-thi-an, written about 2000 years ago, narrates events chronologically from the year 2637 B.C. to 122 B.C.
In the earliest times brought to view there appears a degree of civilization and culture which mu>t have U-eii
the growth of many previous ages. One fact stated is important in its relation to "the period of the Five Rulers." It is said that the Chinese cycle of 60 years was established
in the 61st year of Hoang-ti's reign. This being so, it follows, by mathematical demonstration, that Hoang-ti's reign began in the year 2698 B.C., for the 75th recurrence of this
cycle was completed with the year 1863 A.D. The time
of Fu-hi was probably 500 years earlier; and previous to
him were the more ancient rulers, some of whom cultivated
the science of astronomy. It seems impossible to avoid



Hellas and Civilisation. 39
the conclusion that Chinese civilization is as old as Usher's
date for the beginning of the human race, and, perhaps,
much older.. I assume, in these inquiries, that the current " biblical" chronologies have no warrant from either science or the Bible, and that they must not be allowed to pass for more than they are worth.
HELLAS AND CIVILIZATION.
The false chronologies, and slowness to admit that pre
historic times were not necessarily barbarous, have troubled our histories of the people called Greeks. Heretofore the
scholarship of modern Europe has too much fostered, a be
lief that enlightened civilization, science, and art all began with the people of Hellas, arid had their first great development at Athens. Hellenic egotism, inherited with Hel
lenic literature, has not served as the best qualification for
writing or reading histories of the Greek race. What be
longs to several families of this brilliant group of the great
Aryan people has been given to one, and that the latest in development ; and what they all received from the Phoeni
cian or Cushite culture, which immediately preceded them in the same regions, has not been well considered. This* influence has sometimes made it difficult to see that even
Babylon, Egypt, Assyria, and Persia had any thing higher
or more enlightened than a certain greatness of " barbaric
pomp and splendor."
That interpretation of antiquity which begins its history of civilization with the Hellenes and the Romans, and excludes every thing not recognized and celebrated by their
literary oracles, is not entitled to the highest degree of respect. Neither the Hellenes nor the Romans gave an in

telligible account of the beginnings of their own history. Their literature betrays no clear consciousness of the bril
liant civilizations that preceded them in Thrace, Asia Minor, and Etruria, and furnishes only confused and uncertain
notices of the Phoenicians, Egyptians, and Persians previous to Alexander the Great. This is not altogether true of Herodotus, who was an Ionian ; but it is true of what has heretofore passed current as most orthodox and authoritative in Greek literature, and has done most to regulate modern opinion.
In certain respects Mr. Grote's history of Greece is ad
mirable, so far as it professes to be a history of the Hellenic peninsula; but his treatment of what is usually termed tin"Legendary and Heroic Age of Greece" is chiefly remark
able as an elaborate display of unphilosophical skepticism. lie begins the history with the year 776 B.C., and finds
nothing but " interesting fictions" in the myths and U-gi -nd>
representing the previous ages. The history of Hellas did not go back into the past many generations beyond that date. Hellas was scarcely as old as Homer, who was n i a native of that country, and did not represent its culture.
Grote's positive and not always ingenuous skepticism may l>e as reasonable as that theory of Greek antiquity which finds in the myths and legends nothing more than a "legendary and heroic age" of the Hellenes. It is false to the
past, but not much more so than this theory itself. The Greek race settled around the ^Egean Sea, in Asia
Minor, Thrace, Macedonia, Thessaly, Epirus, and throughout the Grecian peninsula consisted of a group of tribes
or families as closely related in origin and language, probably, as the Scandinavian group in Northwestern Europe. They inherited the culture of their predecessors, the Pluu

nicians, or Cushites, and the Pelasgians, who, in more ancient times, established the oracle of Dodona, made Thrace
eminent as a seat of civilization and science, established enlightened communities in Asia Minor, andcarried their
civilizing influence into the Grecian peninsula itself. The
earliest and greatest known development of the Greek race was that which created the Ionian confederacy of Asia Mi
nor ; the latest was that of Hellas.
Very true it is that the Argonautic expedition, the legendary sieges of Thebes, the oracle of Dodona, the cities of Mycenae and Tiryns, and such personages as Orpheus, Musaeus, Olen, Linus, Cecrops, Cadmus, Pelops, and many others, have very little to do with the history of Hellas ;
but it is not true that they are all mere fictions or illusions.
Criticism that destroys narrow and false interpretations of the legendary lore of the Greeks deserves respect, but it should not be content with skepticism, and assume too
readily that " the curtain is the picture." It may be true, as Cousin says in his lectures on the History of Philosophy,
that skepticism is the first appearance of common sense in
our philosophizing ; but it is not the only appearance of common sense on that field, for skepticism is neither the middle nor the end of true philosophy. Historical criti
cism should be able not only to destroy falsehood, but also
to establish truth.
Mr. Grote might reasonably find in the Hellenic myths
and legends nothing belonging to the history of Hellas ; but, however brilliantly or weirdly arrayed by imagination, they are the children of Fact; they contain recollections, not of the first ages of Hellenic history, but of communities
and nations more ancient. True interpreters of antiquity see this ; it could not be seen by Mr. Grote, who adopted

what he describes as " the just position long ago laid down
by Varro," and wliicli he states thus : " First, there was the time from the beginning of mankind down to the first del
uge a time*vholly unknown. Secondly, the period from the first deluge down to the first Olympiad, which is called
the mythical period, because many fabulous things are re
counted in it. Thirdly, the time from the first Olympiad
down to ourselves, which is called the historical period^ he-cause the tilings done hi it are comprised in true historic."
According to this "position," mankind did nothing important, and appear not to have risen much above barbarism previous to the first Greek Olympiad. It assumes that actual history begins with the Hellenes ; and Grote appears
to take for granted that civilization, culture, and even language were in their infancy when Hellas rose. lie finds
in the mythical traditions nothing to indicate previous eiv
ilization or previous nationalities; he fails to recognise the influence of the Phoenicians and Egyptians ; and his eyes are blind to the fact that the civilization of Ionia was older
and greater than that of Hellas, lie finds "prodigious im
probability" in the legendary account Herodotus gives of the oracle of Dodona, not seeming able to comprehend that
no " prodigious improbabilities" can exceed those put forth in support of this scheme of confident skepticism, which sees nothing but "fictions" in the traditions and mytho
logical legends of antiquity, and attributes them wholly to
the " creative imagination" of the Greeks.
He states very justly that, in Hellas, or Greece proper,
" physical astronomy was both new and accounted impious in the time of the Peloponnesian war," and that even Plato
" permitted physical astronomy only under great restric
tions and to a limited extent." And yet he fails to notice,



The earliest Greek Culture was Asiatic. 43
in such a manner as faithful exposition of Greek history
demanded, that Thales, Pythagoras, and many other lonians had a science of astronomy which included correct knowl
edge of the solar system. It seems impossible to inquire carefully without perceiving that Hellenic culture was pre
ceded by a great development of civilization, science, and art, which it inherited, but could not wholly make its own,
and which, in Ionia, wr as superior to anything known af
terward at Athens, excepting, perhaps, in elegant literature,
sculpture, and certain forms of philosophical speculation. What is usually talked of as Greek culture had its origin
in Asia Minor, and was richly developed there long before its light appeared at Athens. The earliest intellectual
movement that found expression in the. Greek language
was wholly Asiatic. It appeared in Ionia, the country of
Homer, Thales, Pythagoras, and Herodotus, where, during many ages before the lonians and their language became
predominant, another people had richly brightened the land with their culture. The literature, language, and sway of that older people were superseded or absorbed by the Ionic family of the Greek race, just as in Italy, some centuries later, the speech, culture, and dominion of Etruria were superseded by the Romans. The cities of Ionia, and of the whole coast of Asia Minor, were built and occupied origin
ally by the race represented by the Phoenicians, followed by the Pelasgians ; and in that beautiful region, whatever
culture was known to Arabia, Egypt, Chaldea, and the East, received its most elegant development. The scholars of Ionia itself studied in the schools of Phoenicia and Egypt.
They Cached a degree of intellectual independence and of
progress in science never equaled by- any community on the other side of the ^Egean.



44 Pre-Historic Nations.
Only a small portion of the literature of Ionia has Leer. preserved ; but the earliest Greek writers known or mentioned were all natives of Asia Minor, or representatives of its culture. Homer was born and educated there ; He
siod's parentage and literary training were both Ionian ;
Archilochus, " the first Greek who composed iambic verses
according to fixed rules," was born on that coast in the
eighth century before Christ, and had a fame " second only
to that of Homer." There appeared the first development of what has been called the "Greek philosophy," and He
rodotus tells us that Thales, " the father of Greek philosophy," was "of Phoenician extraction;" he was born at Miletus in the seventh century before Christ. Pythagoras was a native of Samos, one of the most important Ionian
cities. All the early historians who wrote in Greek were born and educated in Asia Minor ; Herodotus was a native of Halicamassus ; Hecateus was a native of Miletus. Tyrtaeus, born at Miletus nearly 700 years before the Christian Era, was one of those who carried Ionian culture to Athens; and in the same century appeared, on the Asiatic side of
the ^Egean, Terpaixler, Airman, Alneus, Sappho, and other brilliant Grecian lyrists. In Asia Minor rose the most elegant and beautiful order of Greek architecture the Ionic.
At the beginning of the sixth century before Christ the Greek world had two matchless temples that moved all beholders with admiration and wonder : they were both in
Asia Minor, one being the temple of Hera, at Samos, the other the temple of Diana, at Ephesus. Artistic architec
ture had not then made its appearance in Hellas. The intimate relations of Athens with Ionia contributed
more than anything- else to make that city superior in culture to any other community on the Hellenic peninsula.



What the Greek Myths signify. 45
In this region, the people generally, like the Spartans, never reached a very high degree of cultivation ; but the Hel
lenic writers left no histories of literature to show what the
Greek race inherited from the enlightened civilization of
other and older peoples, or to point out distinctly their own relation to Ionia. Herodotus showed that religion, letters, and civilization came to the Greeks from the Phoenicians and Egyptians ; but in Hellas his statements were
severely attacked, Plutarch describing them as " the malignity of Herodotus ;" and, until recently, modern scholars, swayed by Hellenic influence, took a similar torie, and treat
ed him as an untrustworthy fabler. It is now understood that no Greek historian was more truthful or more intelli
genWt,e should study the Greek myths and traditions, not as
indications of a " legendary and heroic age of Greece" nor
with that stultifying skepticism which represents them as
nothing more than " interesting fictions," but as imper
fect, confused, and idealized recollections of civilizations, peoples, events, and persons that had become ancient before the time of the first Olympiad. Without the aid of regular history, w^e can see that ancient Thrace and Phryg
ia were enlightened and important nationalities, that flourished and declined several ages before the period to which
the Trojan War is usually assigned. To their time belongs the later period of the oracle of Dodona ; and con
temporary with them, probably, were MycenaB and " sacred Tiryns." It is quite as absurd to call Olen, Orpheus, Musaeus, Eumolpus, and Minos, Greeks ; as to call Livy, Virgil, Cicero, Pliny, Hannibal, and Scipio, Frenchmen. They did not belong to the nation or age of Plato, Euripides, Xenophon, and Socrates. Some of them were Thracians ; and

the Thrace of Orpheus must have been nearly as distant in
time from Hellas, as the Rome of the Caesars was from the
France of Philip Augustus. Between them were " middle
ages" to which belonged Troy, Argos, the origin of the oracle of Delphi, with the earlier periods of the kingdom of
Lydia and of the Ionian confederacy. The language of Thrace and Dodona must have been a dead language before the time of Homer; and the hymns of Olen, Orpheus, and MUSDDUS, preserved by use in celebrating the- Elcusinian Mysteries, must have needed translation in the time of
Onomacritus, even if the language in which they were writ
ten had been neither Pelasgic nor "Ammonian," but, instead, some ancient dialect of the Greek family. It is not a fortunate circumstance that our studies of antiquity have been so much influenced by Hellenic narrow
ness and egotism; nor is it m-ditable to the scholars of
Hellas that they said so little, and appeared to know ao little of the ancient history of that beautiful region around the .Kgcaii, Avhcre civilization was as old as the commer
cial enterprise that created Sidui. Their influence has giv
en us histories of Greece in which nearly everything in that
region is made subordinate to Hellas, which is set forth as
the beginning, middle, and end of all the enlightened culture it ever knew. It should be sufficient to appeal to the
Greek language itself against this method of writing ]
ries of the Greeks. The extraordinary development of this
language appears in its oldest literary monuments that
have been preserved, making us feel that they cannot be

cessive wisdom, that the mythical and legendary recollec
tions are merely " interesting fictions," and signify nothing. They will agree, however, that actual history begins with
the given epoch. The Hellenes are not the only people whose audacious egotism has assumed and believed them to be the selectest people on earth the matchless blossom and glory of humanity, while all others were outside barbarians; but it may well be doubted whether this weakness in any other
people ever had such a powerful and far-reaching influence.



48 Pre-Historic Nations.
I do not believe the history of America can be written,
three thousand years hence, as ignorant ly and meanly as I have supposed. The culture of the present time, with all
its defects, is so much larger and nobler, so much more observant of what is true and just, in its treatment of the
past and the present, than was evqr realized in Hellas, that it cannot transmit to future ages the same misleading in
fluence.
Bryant, in his " Analysis of Ancient Mythology," discusses the narrowness and self-conceit of the Hellenic spir
it with much intelligence and force. He points out ;_ mistakes in Ilrllenie writers on Mythology, and shows that
they were too ignorant of their predecessors, and too bigoted and egotistic, to treat this subject in a proper manner. He maintains that the most useful Greek writers on sub
jects relating to antiquity are those who did not reside
in Hellas, and names Lycophron, Callimachus, Apollonius
I Jlu xlius, Homer, Nonnus, who wrote " Dionysiaca," Porphyry, Proclus, lamblicus, Diodorus Siculus, Pausanias, and the Christian fathers Theophilus, Tatianus, Athenagoras, Clemens, Origen, Eusebius, Theodoret, Syncellus, and others. In such writers he finds a more unprejudiced reference to antiquity, and a more candid record of what was
known of the older nations. It would, however, be too
much to expect, anywhere in Greek literature, a just and cordial appreciation of the great civilization that prevailed around the ^Egean and the Mediterranean for ages before the Greek race came into history. It is not there. The
lost literature of Thrace, Phrygia, Ionia, Etruria, and Phoenicia would tell us more ; but its beginnings were in very remote times, and successive changes of race and language so wasted the early records and monuments, that a com

plete history had become difficult, if not impossible, to the
later generations. Some of the most important Grecian works on archaeo
logical topics are lost, or known only in preserved frag
ments of them. Who that is drawn to these studies would
not like to have a complete copy of the Ethnica of Stephanus of Byzantium ? or of the more ancient mythological
history of Pherecydes, who is said to have obtained his knowledge from the secret books of the Phoanicians ? or
of the genealogical, chronological, and historical works of Hellanicus of Mytilene ? or of that very ancient work of
Thymsetes, of "Asia Minor," written in a language older than the Greek, to which Diodorus Siculus and others re
fer in their accounts of Dionysus or Bacchus ? A vast li
brary of such lost works would fail to satisfy half our questions, but it would add much to our knowledge of the
past ; and how greatly would this knowledge be extend
ed could we add to it the lost mythological and historical
literature of Phoenicia, Arabia, Egypt, and Chaldea, with

PEE-IIISTORIC TIMES.
Those " ancient histories of Iran," long since lost, would
tell us much that we desire to know, not only of the early
history of the Aryan people, whose great antiquity it is
now impossible to deny, but also of the great people of ancient Arabia, whose civilization was much older and more enterprising, and who were known to the Hebrews as Cushites, and to the early Greeks as Ethiopians. It seems to
me impossible to inquire carefully without being led to the conclusion that Arabia, in very remote antiquity, was the

seat of a brilliant civilization, which extended itself through
out Southwestern Asia, and spread its influence from the extreme east to the extreme west of the known world. The wonderful people of ancient Arabia the revered and mysterious Ethiopians of ancient tradition seem to have filled the world, as they knew it, with their commercial activity, their maritime enterprise, their colonies, and the light of civilized life. Their traces are still found everywhere.
Their civilization may have originated in Southern Arabia; it may have been due to the influence of some older people. This problem cannot be solved; but those who are using the disentombed records of Assyrian and Chaldean
culture to reconstruct linguistic, ethnic, and political history, may see in them that "third race, neither Indo-European nor Semitic," which "laid the foundation of the culture which was adopted and developed there by the other
races, as they later, one after another, succeeded to the su
premacy." By pre-historic times I mean the ages between the crea
tion of man and the beginning of authentic history. If we
.irrupt the usual method, and begin regular history with the Greeks and Romans, we must exclude from it the history of China, and pretty much the whole of Rawlinsou's history of the "Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World ;" we must place in pre-historic times all that relates to the old Egyptians, since Menes as well as
before his time, not to speak of the older Aryans and Cu>h
ites, or Ethiopians, who belong there ; and we must find
nothing historical in any part of Western Europe beyond
the accounts given by the Romans. This method is open
to very effective criticism. The limit of history should be

should be allowed to some existing documents which it dis
regards; but it is unnecessary to engage in controversy
with those who begin history with the first Greek Olym
piad, provided they do not deny all previous civilization, and maintain that everything in human affairs previous to that date is either unknown or fabulous. We know much of the history of times more ancient.

ruins, amounting now to " whole libraries of annals, and
works of science and literature," shall be fully explored and deciphered, the veil may be partly withdrawn from the history of that great race which created Egypt and Chal
dca, and whose characteristic traces still show the extent
of its influence. The Cushite element is already clear to
the best interpreters ; and, apart from linguistic inquiry, what was known already, rightly studied, was sufficient to warrant a prediction that it would be found there.
The great period of the Cushite or Ethiopian race had
closed many ages previous to the time of Homer, although separate communities of that race remained, not only in
Egypt, but also in Southern Arabia, in Pho2nicia, in Africa, and elsewhere east and west. The distance in time from our age to that of Homer is much less than that from his age to the very remote period when the Cushites of Ara
bia colonized Chaldea. When we consider the exclusive
ness of the Hellenes, and their lack of disposition to study
and comprehend the past, it is not surprising that they
knew so little of the history of more ancient nations ; on the contrary, we can see more reason for surprise that their literature and traditions furnish so much to indicate the an

cient civilization and greatness of the people whom they
called Ethiopians.
We cannot write an authentic history of the ancient peo
ple of Arabia, nor of any other pre-historic people ; but we can study what is known of them, inquire at every new source of information, and draw such conclusions as the
facts may warrant. Inquiry concerning the condition of the human race in pre-historic times cannot now be avoid
ed. It is forced upon us by the constant and increasing
influence of progress in linguistic and j.liy-i. al science. That thi antiquity of man is much greater than our chro
nologies have allowed is coming to be an established fact.
Should the later reports of geology on this subject be fully confirmed by future discoveries, this inquiry will become
more active, and assume higher importance.
Advocates of what is called the " development theory,"
as well as champions of the narrowr chronologies, find it
convenient to assign the first appearance of civilization to
a very modern' date in the great pre-historic past. Their hypothesis, surest ed by speculation on the origin of species, and unsupported by any facts, sets forth that the "human race was evolved out of the most highly organized and
endowed of the inferior mammalia ;** and that " the farther
back we trace man into the past, the more shall we find
him approach, in bodily conformation, to those species of the anthropoid quadrumana which are most akin to him in structure." Brutes became men by virtue of the assumed
"tendency of varieties to depart indefinitely from the original type," brute instinct, meanwhile, by a like wondrous change, being transformed into all the great attributes of
the human soul. According to this theory, the first appearance of man on earth was followed by a vast period



The Development Theory. 53
of human savagery, which lasted until the ever-progressing
development had made the race capable of civilization.
It is mere hypothesis, accepted by its advocates as true, but, as they admit, not proved. Geology says nothing in
its favor, for the oldest human remains discovered by ge
ologists are those of men already capable of improvement, and most of them consist of arms, implements, and utensils of human manufacture. Sir John Lubbock and others mention only two human skulls that can be referred to the most ancient period of the Age of Stone, and the antiquity of one of these is doubtful. Of the other, known as the
Engis skull, Mr. Huxley says, in his " Man's Place in Na
ture," " There is no mark of degradation about any part of its structure. It is, in fact, a fair average human skull,
which might have belonged to a philosopher, or might have contained the thoughtless brains of a savage." Sir
J. Lubbock says " it might have been that of a modern
European, so far, at least, as form is concerned." This seems to be an explicit contradiction of the "development
theory." Moreover, it cannot be shown that communities more or
less civilized did not exist on some portions of the globe at the oldest period to which these remains can be assigned. Northwestern Europe is but a small portion of the globe we inhabit. To suppose the existence of such communities at that time is inconsistent with nothing but
this unproved hypothesis ; and to say they did not exist, because WT C have no record of their existence, is mere assumption, with no more claim to the consideration due to
ascertained fact than the supposition itself.
Archaeological investigation has brought to view civilized peoples much farther back in the past than history



~>-i l*rc-ILtxt</ric Nations.
has ever supposed possible. Linguistic science enables us
to trace others much older. Who can show that many
civilized communities and family groups of language did
not successively appear, run their course, and perish in the
veiled ages of pre-historic time ? Who can make it certain
that the first appearance of civilization in those ages was at a comparatively modern date? If we must have a hypothesis concerning the condition of mankind in the most
obecurc pre-historic ages, let it not be inspired entirely by
the generalizings of physical speculation, but rather K-t it come from the higher dictates of reason, and be honorable
to human nature. There is much to suggest such a hy
pothesis as I have indicated, not only in the nature of man, but also in the widespread traces of pre-historic civiliza
tion. For instance, we are not the first civilized inhabi
tants of North America, as the almost obliterated but still unmistakable evidence of an ancient civilization through
out the Ohio and Mississippi Valleys clearly shows. These reflections, however, are somewhat beyond the
scope of our present inquiry, which relates chiefly to the antiquity and character of the ancient people of Arabia, and their influence in promoting the civilization of the
Semitic and Aryan races; therefore I close them wilh the
following from Humboldt's Cosmos: "We will not attempt to decide the question whether the races at pn termed savage are all in a condition of original wildness,
or whether, as the structure of their languages often allows us to conjecture, many among them may not be tribes that have degenerated into a wild state, remaining as scattered fragments from the wreck of a civilization that was early
lost"

PRE-HISTORIC GREATNESS OF ARABIA.
IN our researches into the beginnings of culture in the
oldest nations mentioned in history, we perceive that they
did not originate civilization. It preceded their existence, and came from an older people. They gave it new forms,
each developing an individuality of its own ; but it came originally from abroad. On this point tradition is uniform
and explicit. In Eastern Africa, the civilizers proceeded from the south toward the Mediterranean, creating the countries in the valley of the Nile. The traditions of inner
Asia bring civilization from the south, and connect its or
igin with the shores of the Erythraean Sea, meaning the Arabian shores of the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf;
and these traditions are confirmed by inscriptions found in the old ruins of Chaldea. These inscriptions reveal also the fact that the first civilizers were neither Semites nor
Aryans, but a " third race," which ethnic and linguistic in
vestigators have been slow to recognise.
Meanwhile, it is distinctly apparent in the religions, mythologies, institutions, and customs of these ancient na
tions that they all had the beginnings of their civilization from the same source. The foundations of their culture
were all laid by the same hand, whose traces are still visible in its ruins in the remains of its most ancient religious
forms, its most primitive architecture, and its most archaic
styles of writing. This is so plain that some writers, not



5G Pro-Historic Nations.
able to see the vast extent of pre-historic times, or to com
prehend the possibility of human development in ages too remote for their chronology, have sought to show that some one of these nations gave civilization to all the others.
Some have suggested that it came from Egypt, a hypothesis which neither facts nor probability can allow. Some have said it went from India to all the other nations, which
is still more improbable. Other clever theorists have found
the primeval source of ancient civilization in Chaldea,
where, as both tradition and the ruins testily, it was n..t
original, but came in from an enlightened people belonging to more ancient times.
AX EARLY CIVILIZATION IX ARABIA.
In studying the influence of this more ancient culture, and seeking to discover the source from which it proceeded, wi' are led to Arabia, and to a people known in remote an
tiquity as Ethiopians and Cushites. It is evident that, in ages older than Egypt or Chaldea ages away in the Past, far beyond the limit of Usher's chronology Arabia wa^
the seat of an enlightened and enterprising civilization,
which went forth into the neighboring countries, and spread its influence "from the extremity of the east to the extremity of the west." At that time Arabia was the exalted and wonderful Ethiopia of old tradition the centre and light of what, in Western Asia, was known as the civilized world. There are traditions of the ancient eastern
world, which, rightly interpreted, can have no other meaning ; and modern research presents linguistic and ethnological problems that can have no other satisfactory solution.
The geographical position of Arabia, as well as the characteristics of the great race by which it was occupied, must



Arabia the ancient Ethiopia. 57
have given it this early pre-eminence. A peninsula of great extent, lying between the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf, having at command the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea, within easy reach of the valleys of the Indus and the Euphrates, the eastern coast of Africa, the Nile Valley, and the regions on the Eastern Mediterra
nean, and with an atmosphere and other physical relations that gave it cosmical importance, it had all those conditions
by which commercial and intellectual development are
most powerfully stimulated. It is not surprising to hear what the oldest traditions say of the wonderful Ethiopians, nor to find indications that they were the civilizers of Egypt
and Southwestern Asia. If, as Heeren says, " the first
seats of commerce were also the first seats of civilization," the civilization of Western Asia must have begun with the
people who, previous to the time of Alexander the Great, had, from time immemorial, monopolized commercial and
maritime enterprise.
AEABIA AVAS THE AXCIENT ETHIOPIA.
In the early traditions and literary records of the Greeks, Arabia is described as Ethiopia ; and this name was applied to other regions occupied or controlled by the Arabian Cushites. In modern times, it has commonly been
assumed, without proper inquiry, that the Ethiopians were of course Africans. This grave mistake has been the source
of much misunderstanding and confusion. Another fruitful source of misapprehension is that notable exercise in etymology which derives the word Ethiopia from the Greek words aidw and wi//, and makes it a designation for all the dark-colored races of Africa. Careful students of antiq
uity now point out that " the people of Ethiopia seem to
C2

have been of the Caucasian race," meaning white? men, and
that the word was, to the Greeks, " perhaps really a foreign word corrupted."* The Greeks themselves used the
appellation as a sacred term in the religious vocabulary they had received from the Phoenicians and Egyptians. It
is supposed to have been originated by what is called the
*
serpent worship" of the Cushites. To derive it from the Greek would be as little reasonable as to derive some Greek
name, such as Hellas, from modern Hungarian. Eustathius
(Schol. in Homcrum) says: "^Ethiops is a title of Zeus;"
rideTov Ai0io\f;. Lycophron describes Prometlu
HpopaQeiic AtOio^ ; Prometheus .Kthiops, the d:rmon
or tutelary deity. The appellation had a religious significance, but no reference whatever to complexion. Arabia was the original Ethiopia, or Land of dish. The countries on the Upper Nile were called Ethiopia because
they were at first colonies or dependent provinces of ancient Arabia. At a later period, when the ancient and
long-continued sway of the Ethiopians of Arabia declined, and gave way to the rise of great monarchies in Western Asia and India, the Oushite regions of Asia received new masters and took new names. Arabia itself was recon
structed by new forms of political organization; and, finally, the later Greeks and the Romans introduced the custom
of confining the name Ethiopia to certain African countries
on the Nile, above Egypt. In the Hebrew Scriptures Arabia is uniformly described as Cush, or the Land of Cush. In our English Bible, as in the translation of the Seventy, this term is usually rendered
Ethiopia. In the eighth chapter of Esther, where the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the Persian Empire
* See Smith's Classical Dictionary.



The Hebrews on Arabia. 59
are described as extending "from India unto Ethiopia," this word means Arabia ; and the Ethiopian wife of Moses
was an Arabian woman, being the daughter of a priest of the Midianites. In Ezekiel, that part of Northwestern
Arabia which approaches Egypt is called " the border of
Ethiopia," or Cush. The Arabian king, Tirhakah, who
marched against Sennacherib, is called an Ethiopian, or Cushite ; and the same ethnic name is applied to the Arabian Zerah, who waged war against Asa. That the Hebrew
Scriptures constantly designate Arabia as Cush or Ethiopia will not be questioned by any Hebrew scholar. Rev.
Charles Forster, in his work on the " Historical Geography
of Arabia," and Rev. Dr. Wells, in his work, " The Histori
cal Geography of the Old and New Testament," have placed this fact in the clearest light by collecting and examining many texts in which the name appears. Dr. Wells thinks it incontestable "that the nation of Cush did first settle in Arabia ;" and Mr. Forster says : " It is a matter of fad , familiar to the learned reader, that the names * Ethiopia'
and 'Ethiopians' are frequently substituted in our English version of the Old Testament where the Hebrew preserver the proper name ' Cush.' And the name ' Cush,' when so
applied in Scripture, belongs uniformly, not to the African, but to the Asiatic Ethiopia, or Arabia" (vol. i., p. 12).
The testimony of the older Greek literature is no less
conclusive. The fact is incontestable that, in the early
traditions and writings of the Greeks, this name, Ethiopia, seldom refers to any region in Africa. Strabo (bk. i., ch. ii.)
says : " I assert that the ancient Greeks, in the same way
as they classed all the Northern nations with which they
were familiar as Scythians, etc., so, I affirm, they designated as Ethiopia the whole of the Southern countries to

ward the ocean." This includes with Arabia all the adjacent regions between the Mediterranean and the Indian
Ocean, and all the coasts in that direction. Again, in the
same book and chapter, he says: "And if the moderns
have confined the appellation Ethiopians to those only who dwell near Egypt, this must not be allowed to interfere with the meaning of the ancients." The following is from
the treatise of Ephorus on Europe: "If the whole celestial
and terrestrial world were divided into four parts, the Indians would possess that towards the east, the Ethiopians that towards the south, the Kelts that towards the
and the Scythians that towards the north." Of course, this
classification refers to a period long subsequent to that
when the Ethiopians controlled not only India, but
the regions occupied by the Kelts, and a portion of the
countries assigned to the Scythians. Ephorus says also : "This family of Ethiopians seems to me to have extended themselves from the winter tropic in the east to the extremity of the west."
Homer describes the Ethiopians as " divided," and
" dwelling at the ends of the earth, towards the setting and
the rising sun." Strabo favors the following explanation
of Kphnrus: "The Ethiopians were considered as occupying all the south coasts of both Asia and Africa, and as 'divided' by the Red Sea (aneiently ealled the Arabian Gulf) into Eastern and Western Asiatic and African." It is added that "this is an ancient opinion of the Greeks." This
is undoubtedly true, as far as it goes. Arabia was the
original Ethiopia, and its name was applied to all its col
onies and affiliated communities, whether established at
the west by the people called Pho2nicians, or at tin from the southern and eastern shores of the peninsula.



The Greeks on Ethiopia. 61
They appear to have had colonies in Northwestern Africa
at a very remote period. Strabo himself (bk. ii., ch. v.)
mentions " Western Ethiopians, who are the most southern
of the nations below Carthage ;" and his description locates them on the Atlantic coast of Africa.
At one time, as the early Greeks say, the term Ethiopia was used to describe not only Arabia, but also Syria, Armenia, and the whole region between the Mediterranean and the Erythraean Sea, which means the Indian Ocean and the Persian Gulf. Tradition celebrates Kepheus as one of
the great sovereigns of this ancient Ethiopia. The follow
ing can be found in the fortieth " Narrative" of Conon :
" The kingdom of Kepheus was in the country afterwards
called Phoenicia, but then lopia, from Joppa ; and it extended originally from the Mediterranean to the Arabians
who dwell on the Erythraean Sea." Quotations showing how the appellation Ethiopia was used by the older Greeks can be multiplied. Prof. Rawlinson has abundant warrant for his statement that "the uniform voice of prim
itive antiquity spoke of the Ethiopians as a single race
dwelling on the shores of the Southern Ocean," and " from India to the Pillars of Hercules."
It appears to have been understood, also, that the earliest civilization appeared in Arabia. This was manifestly the belief of the most ancient Hebrew writers, who described
its first inhabitants that had cities and civilized life as
Cushites. They recognised no country as older than Gush or Ethiopia, which was intimately associated with the oldest traditions and recollections recorded in their Scriptures.
A belief of the ancient Greeks was expressed by Stephanus of Byzantium as follows :
" Ethiopia was the first estab
country on earth; and the Ethiopians were the first



G-J l*/-e-IIistoric Nations.
who introduced the worship of the gods, and who estab
lished laws." This was probably a recollection of what,
in earlier times, had been historical. The same belief ap
pears in those glowing passages of the older Greek litera
ture where the Ethiopians, and especially those dwelling on the Erythra?an Sea, are described as the greatest and most admirable people ever known. Heeren was strongly
impressed by this fact, and in his " Researches" spoke of it thus: "From the remotest times to the present, the Ethiopians have been one of the most celebrated, and yet the most mysterious of nations. In the earliest traditions of nearly
all the more civilized nations of antiquity, the name of this distant people is found. The annals of the Egyptian priots \vciv full of them; the nations of Inner Asia, on the Eu
phrates and Tigris, have interwoven the fictions of the Ethiopians with their own traditions of the wars and conqueMs
of their heroes ; and, at a period equally remote, they glim
mer in (Jivck mythology. When the Greeks scarcely knew
Italy and Sicily by name, the Ethiopians were celebrated in the verses of their poets; and when the faint gleam of
tradition and fable gives way to the clear light of history,
the lustre of the Ethiopians is not diminished. They still
continue to be objects of curiosity and admiration, and the
pen of cautious, clear-sighted historians often places them in the highest rank of knowledge and civilization."
To Heeren the ancient Ethiopians were " mysterious" as
well as "celebrated," because, not having made a clear di covery of the Cushite race, he was preoccupied by the as
sumption that Ethiopia was entirely an African country. If he could have released his mind from this assumption,
and inquired, with his usual sagacity, what the old tradi



Heeren on Ethiopia. 63
tions and records mean by the term Ethiopia, he would
have seen the mystery dissipated in a clear light of intelli
gence, and the record of his " Researches" would present a knowledge of the old Cushite race, and of their native coun
try, which it does not now contain. As it was, no investi
gator of his time showed more penetration, or approached
the truth so nearly. He saw that a single race (which he
calls Semitic), speaking one language divided into various
dialects, " at an epoch beyond the reach of history, occupied the extensive plains between the Mediterranean Sea and the Tigris, the most southern point of Arabia, and the Caucasian Mountains." He thinks the Phoenicians belonged
to this race, and says " it appears likely that they came originally from Arabia." .He also finds it probable that the Arabians gained extensive control in India in pre-his
toric times, and that " distinct Arabian colonies may have
been settled on the coasts of Hindustan." Inquiring at
the present time, he would comprehend the Ethiopians, and discover the historic importance of Arabia. The ancient Ethiopia, or Land of Gush, of Greek and Hebrew antiquity, is clearly described in the oldest geographical writings of the Sanskrit people of India. This
testimony, no less remarkable than conclusive, shows the
existence, in very ancient times, of a great Cushite empire or people, occupying Arabia and other regions in Western
Asia ; and it is noteworthy that the old Sanskrit, books, like
the Hebrew Scriptures, describe the country occupied by
this people as Cusha-dwipa, the Land or Country of Cush.* The old Sanskrit scheme of geography, as found in the Pu

ranas and other ancient writings, divides the world into
:-wen parts, or dicipas, to wit : 1. Jambu-dwipa, the centre of the world and ancient home of the whole Aryan race ;
2. Anga-dwipa, in Northeastern Asia, the seat of a groat
Manchu or Mongol people, probably, who, in later times,
successfully invaded China ; 3. Yama-dwipa, or the ancient
Chinese empire ; 4. Yamala-dwipa, which included the peninsula of Malacca, with the many important islands of
Southeastern Asia, anciently occupied by that great and enterprising Malayan empire, which still existed, in a state of weakness and decline, when the Portuguese first went to the Indian Ocean ; 5. Sanrha-dwipa, which meant Africa in
general; 6. Cusha-dwij-a, the Land of Cush, which comprised Arabia and other regions extending from tin
ders of India to the Mediterranean; 7. Varaha-dwipa, or Europe. In this geography Cusha-dwipa appears as one <>f the great divisions of the world, not on account of its position, which alone could not have given it such importance, but
evidently on account of the importance and power of the
civilized people by whom it was inhabited. A later divi
sion of the world added MX new dwipas, or, rather, subdwipas, contained within the seven great dwipas. Anmu
these we find a second Cusha-dwipa, situated in Africa In
yond the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and called Cusha-dwipa without, or the exterior Cusha-dwipa, because it had been created by emigration and colonization from the original
Cusha-dwipa, now called Cusha-dwipa within, or the inte
rior Cusha-dwipa. The great or primal Cusha-dwipa is de< scribed as extending" from the shores of the Mediterranean and the mouths of the Kile to Sirhind on the borders of
India."



The Sanskrit CusJia-dwipa. 65
The old Sanskrit geographers applied the term Cusha
dwipa to very nearly the same regions which the ancient Greeks described as Ethiopia. It included Arabia, Asia
Minor, Syria from the mouths of the Nile, Armenia, the countries on the Euphrates and Tigris, a large part of the region north of the Persian Gulf, and, finally, an extended region in Africa. In remote pre-historic times it was the
richest, most populous, and most enlightened portion of the
world. Cusha-dwipa was in two parts ; so, according to
Homer and the Greeks, was Ethiopia " divided" into two parts, one being Asiatic and the other African. All ac
counts agree in stating that this African Cusha-dwipa was created by emigration from Arabia and from countries connected with it, and it seems to have extended not only northward, but also down the southeastern coast of Africa,
and so far into the interior as to include the Soma- Giri, or
Mountains of the Moon, and the lake regions around the sources of the Nile.
The geography found in the old Sanskrit books is mani
festly that of the Aryans before they entered India, and not that of the more enterprising and traveled Cushite race. It describes the world as a circular plain, with a
slightly convex surface, sloping gently on all sides to a surrounding ocean. Beyond this ocean, which inclosed the world in a vast river-like circle of waters, was a circular
range of mountains supporting the ocean, called the Loca
loca Mountains, beyond which none but the most powerful gods could pass. In the centre of the world, at the high
est point of its surface, stood Mount Meru, with Jambu
dwipa, the primeval home of the Aryan race, spread out around it, bordered with the other six dwipas or grand divisions of the earth. At a later period the Hindu scholars



<;; Pi-e-Historic Nations.
obtained more correct notions of the world. Ages before
Copernicus, Aryabhatta taught in his writings that " the earth is a sphere, and revolves on its own axis." He
learned this, probably, from the Cushites. That the other scheme was the ancient geography of the Aryan race is shown by the fact that it was carried to the Mediterranean by those families of the race who migrated westward before the Sanskrit people occupied Northern In
dia. We find it in Homer and Hesiod, and it is mentioned
and ridiculed by Herodotus, who says (bk. iv., ch. xxxvi., Rawlinsmfs translation) : "I cannot but laugh when I see numbers of persons drawing maps of the world without
having any reason to guide them, making, as they do, the ocean stream to run all round the earth, and the- earth itself to be an exact circle, as if described by a pair of coinpasses." This is said to have been the geographical scheme of the Greeks in their early times ; Herodotus seems to say
it was prevalent among " the Greeks who dwell about Pontus." Its existence in both India and Greece shows that it mustbe older than the period when these branches of the
Aryan family separated. It would be unreasonable, in my view, to deny or doubt that, in ages farther back in the past than the beginnings of any old nation mentioned in our ancient histories, Arabia
was the seat of a great and influential civilization. This
fact, so clearly indicated in the remains of antiquity, seems
indispensable to a satisfactory solution of many problems that arise in the course of linguistic and archaeological inquiry. It is now admitted that a people of the Cushite or
Ethiopian race, sometimes called Hamites, were the first
civilizers and builders throughout Western Asia, and they

ture, and the influence of their civilization, on both shores of the Mediterranean, in Eastern Africa and the Nile valley, in Hindustan, and in the islands of the Indian Seas. These people had a country which was the home of their
civilization. These civilizers, this " third race," now so dis
tinctly reported by scientific investigators, but not yet well explained, must have been very different from a swarm of
nomads, or a flood of disunited tribes moving from region
to region, without a fixed country of their own. Those wonderful builders, whose traces reveal so plainly the
habit of fixed life and the spirit of developed nationality, were not a horde of homeless wanderers. They had a
country of their own, from which their enterprise and culture went forth to other lands, and this country must have been Arabia.
It is apparent that no other race did so much to devel
op and spread civilization ; that no other people had such an extended and successful system of colonization ; that
they seem to have monopolized the agencies and activities of commerce by sea and land ; and that they were the lordly and ruling race of their time. The Arabians were the great maritime people of the world in ages beyond the reach of tradition ; as Phoenicians and Southern Arabians
they controlled the seas in later times, and they were still the chief navigators and traders on the Indian Ocean when Vasquez di Gama went to India around the Cape of Good
Hope.
IGNORANCE AND MISAPPREHENSION CONCERNING ARABIA.
It can be objected that the common estimate of the Arabian peninsula does not accord with such views of its an
cient history as I have indicated. The reply is, that no

part of the globe has been so little known or so greatly misapprehended in modern times as Arabia. It is commonly assumed that the whole interior of the country is a
dreary waste of deserts, and that the only portions of it where civilized communities can exist are certain districts
on the coast, the. rest of this great peninsula being given
up to nomads, or " wandering Arabs." This assumption, though very old and very confident, is wholly incorrect; its picture of Arabia is a fancy sketch to which the reality has no resemblance. That lack of knowledge which makes such pictures possible is due partly to the extreme isolation
of the Arabian peninsula, since the rise of Western Europe changed the route to India, and took away its commanding importance as the central country between India and the West, and partly to Mahometanism and the decline of civilization in Western Asia. But its isolation from the West
ern countries began earlier. The later Greeks knew but little of Arabia, the Romans knew less, and in modern times intelligent travelers have journeyed along the coast
in some districts of the Hedjaz, Yemen, Hadramaut, and Oman without making an actual discovery of the coun
try. Lieut. Wellsted surveyed nearly the whole coast-line of
Arabia, and traveled extensively in Oman, and yet so little did he know of Central Arabia that the printed record of his travels begins as follows: "Arabia has been aptly compared to a coat of frieze bordered with gold, since the
only cultivated or fertile spots are found on its confines, the intermediate space being filled with arid and sandy
wastes." Even Humboldt, relying on the old assumption
and the reports of travelers, supposed " the greater part of the interior of Arabia was a barren, treeless, and sandy

waste." Ptolemy, living at Alexandria, gained some knowl
edge of the country, which appears in his geography, where cities and towns are located in the interior; but in Mr.
Forster's work it is pointed out as a very grave mistake
that " the Ptolemaic map prepared by Mercator" repre
sents the " uninhabitable desert as clothed throughout with towns and covered with inhabitants." In the same way modern ignorance has criticised and discredited the Ara
bian geography of El Edrisi, because, as it alleges, through
" invincible dislike to large blanks in a map," he filled up
" the uninhabited country" of the interior with towns and
villages. Mr. Forster's notion of the extent of this " uninhabited country" may be seen in his account of one of its
deserts, which, according to his description, fills two thirds of the whole peninsula. Meanwhile it remains true that Ptolemy and El Edrisi had a much better knowledge of Central Arabia than is possible to the invincible assurance
of such imaginative constructors of its geography. In 1862-3, Mr. William Gifford Palgrave, whose long residence at the East, intimate knowledge of the Mahometan
world, and perfect knowledge of the Arabic language gave him admirable qualifications for such a tour of observation,
spent six months in Central Arabia, traveling through it from west to east. He tells us that he began this journey
" supposing, like most people, that Arabia was almost ex
clusively the territory of nomads." His preparations for
" traffic and intercourse with the natives" were made in ac
cordance with this supposition, which, he adds, was " a grievous mistake, of which we soon became aware." In
stead of nomads and " uninhabitable wastes," he found a
rich and beautiful country, a settled and civilized popula
tion, and, throughout nearly the whole of his journey, cities,

towns, tillage, and regular government, " where Bedouins stand for little or nothing." The nomads, found chiefly at the north, constitute scarcely one seventh of the population ; and he seeks to impress upon his readers that the wandering Bedouins must not be taken as representatives of the
Arabian race, for " they are only a degenerate branch of that great tree, not its root or main stock." In a word,
they are a debased and roving population, "grown out of and around the fixed nation," and nowise like the fancyformed "sages and noblemen of the desert" shown us in the portrayals of romance. Mr. Palgrave discovered that Central Arabia is an in
tensive and fertile table-land, diversified by hills and \ al
leys, and surrounded by a circle of waste and desert soil.
He estimates that, this great plateau comprises nearly half of the whole peninsula, or about 500,000 square miles, which is twiee the extent of France. He found it occupied
by two kingdoms, Shomer and Nejed ; the former contain
ing five provinces, Djebel Shomer, Djowf, Kheybar, Upper Kasseem, and Teyma ; and the latter eleven provinces, 'Aared, Yenianiah, Ilareek, Alia], Wadi Dowfisir, Seley'yel, Woshem, Sedeyr, Lower Kasseem, Ilasa, and Kateef. In reality, there seemed to be but one nation there ; and, in times not very distant, when Kasseem and Sedeyr were
metropolitan provinces, there was, probably, but on>
preme government. The industry, culture, and general condition of the people seemed to be above what is found
in the neighboring countries of Asia. " The soil belongs
in full right to its cultivators, not to the government, as in Turkey ; nor is it often in the hands of large proprietors, like the zemindars of India or the wealthier farmers of
England." He noticed that the show of civilization in

creased as he proceeded eastward. In the province of Sedeyr, where Mr. Palgrave seems to have had very cordial
communication with the people, he found " elegant and co
pious hospitality," with much dignity and politeness in the
manners of the people. He says, " The dominant tone of
society, especially in Sedeyr, is that of dignified and even
refined politeness." He touched the kingdom of Shomer first at Wadi Serhan,
and came soon to the Djowf, an oasis or valley belonging to that kingdom, described as the western vestibule to the
central country. It is fertile and very beautiful, and has, besides many smaller towns and villages, two cities con
taining over 30,000 inhabitants. Hayel, the capital of Shomer, "surrounded by fortifications twenty feet high,
with bastion towers, some round, some square, and large
folding gates at intervals," had from 20,000 to 22,000 in
habitants ; but " its area would easily hold 300,000 or more, were its streets and houses close packed like those of Brus
sels or Paris." It has spacious gardens and pleasuregrounds within the walls, while the plain "all around the town is studded with isolated houses and gardens, the
property of wealthy citizens." All along the route he
traveled were towns and villages, " clean and pleasant, and not unlike those of Jafnapatam and Ceylon."
Coming to the plain of Lower Kasseem, he saw it as follows :
" Before us*, to the utmost horizon, stretched an immense plain, studded with towns and villages, towers
and groves, all steeped in the dazzling noon, and announcing everywhere opulence and activity." Kasseem is an ancient seat of Arabian civilization. Two of its cities which he saw contained, one over thirty thousand inhabitants, and the other over twenty-five thousand. Riad, the



72 . Pre-Historic Nations.
capital of Nejed, is " large and square, with high towers and strong walls of defense, a mass of roofs and terraces,"
with " edifices of remarkable appearance here and there
breaking through the maze of gray roof-tops ; and " for full three jniles over the surrounding plain waved a sea of palm-trees above green fields and well-watered gardens, while southward the valley opened into the great and even
more fertile plains of Yemamah, filled with groves and
villages, among which Manfoohah, hardly inferior to Riad
itself, was clearly distinguished."
Such, in reality, is that " uninhabited country," that "
and dreary wojd" of "arid and sandy wastes." that iinng
iiH-d land >f " treeless and waterless deserts'" Central Ara
bia. The extent of the fertile countries along the coast had already become known. The whole peninsula contains over a million square miles, and probably three fourths of
it are now excellent for cultivation. In the great days of
Kthiopian supremacy a still larger portion of Arabia was used for agricultural purposes, and for the various wants
of a settled population. Even now a sufficient supply of water for irrigation would transform most of the <1
districts into luxuriant fields and gardens. The ancient Arabians provided for this want by means of immense tanks similar to those still existing in "Ceylon. Mr. Pal
grave speaks thus of the Syrian desert :
" These very lands, now so utterly waste, were, in old tirrtcs, and under a bet
ter rule, widely cultivated, and full of populous life, as the numerous ruins strewn over their surface still attest." The same may be said of other desert districts in and near Arabia. There is no reason to doubt that very consid
erable portions of the desert region between Nejed and
Hadramaut, usually called "the Dahna," were formerly

cultivated, and occupied by towns, villages, and plantations.* This remarkable country had no lack of fitness to be the home of a great people, and in the days when Balbec and Petra were flourishing cities, and Arabia was the busy commercial centre of the civilized world, it could have sup
ported a hundred million people as easily as France now sustains forty million. It had no lack of resources for the
great part played by its people in human affairs. If England and Spain could colonize and fill the whole Ameri
can continent in the space of two or three centuries, what might not be done by the ancient Arabians in the course
of twenty centuries ? The great power and far-reaching activity of this people had declined many ages before the
time of Ptolemy, and yet he enumerated 170 cities, ports, and large towns existing in his time within the region described by him as Arabia Felix.
THE TWO RACES IN ARABIA.
At the present time Arabia is inhabited by two distinct
races, namely, descendants of the old Adite, Cushite, or
Ethiopian race, known under various appellations, and
dwelling chiefly at the south, the east, and in the central
parts of the country, but formerly supreme throughout the whole peninsula ; and the Semitic Arabians Mahomet's race found chiefly in the Hedjaz and at the north. In some districts of the country these races are more or less
* According to Arabian tradition, Ad, the primeval father of the pure Arabians, settled in the region occupied by this desert, where he built a city that became great and powerful. The Mahometans say the city and people were destroyed on account of the unbelieving wickedness of the

mixed, and since the rise of Mahometanism. the language of the Semites, known to us as Arabic^ has almost wholly
superseded the old Ethiopian or Cushite tongue ; but the two races are very unlike in many respects, and the dis
tinction has always been recognised by writers on Arabian ethnology. To the Cushite race belongs the oldest and
purest Arabian blood, and also that great and very ancient
civilization whose ruins abound in almost every district of
the country. To the Semites belong the originators and first preachers of Mahometanism, and also the nomads. The Semites claim to be descendants of Ishmael, and
they first appeared in Arabia at a period comparatively modem, probably not much older than the time of the Hebrew settlements in Canaan; the Cushites are connected with the oldest traditions of the country. For this reason, the Semitic Arabs, who settled at the north and in the
Iledja/, have always given precedence to the Arabians of the central and southern districts, and conceded their su
perior antiquity. In Arabic speech the Arabians of the old race are called Aril.ah, that is to say, Arabians of pure* blood, Arabians par excellence, while those of Mahomet's
race are described as Jtroustarribca* people of foreign origin, who were grafted on the pure stock by the marriage of Ishmael with a princess of the Cushite race. Heretofore both tradition and the Oriental historians
have agreed in saying that in ancient times a language was spoken in Arabia wholly different from the Arabic of Mahomet. Modern research has confirmed this statement. That old language has been discovered. "NVe have it in
what are called the Hiinyaric inscriptions ; and modern dialects of it are still spoken in two or three districts of the peninsula, and to a considerable extent in Eastern and

Northern Africa, where it is written as well as spoken. It is found, also, in the ruins of Chaldea ; and, in remote an
tiquity, it seems to have been spoken throughout most of Western Asia, and also in Hindustan, where it is probably
represented at the present time, in a corrupted form, by the group of languages called Dravidian. It cannot properly be classed in the same family with the Arabic, but is
closely related to the old Egyptian. It has been called " a new form of speech," because it was new to those who first
discovered it; but it is very ancient, existing now only in disentombed inscriptions, in sentences preserved, without history, on the stones and rocks of old ruins, and in frag
mentary and obscure communities representing the great pre-historic people by whom it was used. In the termin
ology of linguistic science, this language is called Ethiopia, Cushite, and sometimes Hamitic. Mahometan fanaticism applied the term "Djohal," or
" Ignorants" (or anti-Christ, as Christians might say), to all who dwelt in Arabia previous to the advent of its prophet ; and the fierce blaze of this fanaticism consumed the old
Cushite or Ethiopian literature, in which it saw nothing
represented but accursed thoughts and feelings of the previous ages of" heathenish wickedness." The strange tongue
of the " godless Djohal," which gradually fell into disuse, made this destruction easy; but, as we can see in Ma
hometan literature, there remained a prevailing conscious
ness of the great eminence, influence, and antiquity of tie old race ; and the wealth of the old culture in Arabia, Plioe
nicia, and Syria is seen in the superior development of the Arabic language, in the civilization that gave such lustre
to the empire of the caliphs, and in the knowledge of sci
ence and philosophy brought to Western Europe by the

Saracens. This ineradicable consciousness of a great an
cient history of the Arabian Cushites appears in the studi
ed attempts of Mahometan historians and traditionists to connect with them the origin ofMahomet's race. Mahomet,
they say, inherited the purest of the " blue blood" through the marriage of an ancestor with a princess of Yemen ; and
one tradition, which has been issued in many editions, represents that Joktan, son of Heber, recognised for this purpose as the most ancient father of the Semitic Arabians, was identical with Kahtan of Cushite history, described a the first king of Yemen. These Mahometan inventions have confused and falsified the traditions of Arabian antiquity. William Muir, in the introduction to his learned and elaborate life of Mahomet, says: The identification of Joktan with Kahtan "is one of
those extravagant fictions which the followers of Islam, in their zeal to accommodate Arabic legends to the Jewish
Scriptures, have made in defiance of the most violent im
probability and the grossest anachronisms." lie ad-Is: "It is no better than that of the Medina party, who tried to prove that Kahtan was a descendant of Ishmael, and therefore had no connection with Joktan." The Joktan invention is treated in the same way by Caussin <le Perceval. These fictions are not as old as Mahometanism ; and their chief purpose was to connect the founders of this religion with the prestige of the more ancient race, Avhieh
still lived in the popular mind throughout the peninsula. The connection of the Arabian Semites with the Hebrews,
to whom they had claimed relationship through Ishmael, was older than Mahomet, and had made them acquainted with the Hebrew Scriptures. When, under the lead of Ma
homet, they first emerged from obscurity, and aspired to

lordly supremacy in the whole country, they began to appropriate to themselves the antiquity and the great names
of the old Ethiopians, or Cushites, whose grand career had long since closed. Then arose the legends that sought to ennoble Mahomet's race by giving it the oldest Arabian blood, and even attempted to Semitize the Cushites by transforming the ancient Kahtan of that race into their
imagined or traditional ancestor, Joktan.
In reality, neither history nor tradition has knowledge of more than two races in Arabia the very ancient Cush
ites, who were a great and enterprising people in remote
prc-historic times, and the Arabian Semites, who were not there during the grand periods of Arabian ancient history, and did not appear there until many centuries after the
extended empire of the Cushites, or Ethiopians, had declined and become disunited. These Arabic Semites, who
have chiefly occupied attention, and whose history has been allowed to obscure the ancient and true Arabians,
were an unimportant, and probably a nomadic people, when they first appeared in the country, and they remained very obscure until the beginning of the seventh century
after the Christian Era. They are generally called Mous
tarribes by their own writers, wT hile those of the ancient race are called Aribah, or Arabians of the oldest and se
lectest blood. Ibn-Dihhyah, an Arabic historian, keeping up the fiction about Joktan, in a modified form, describes three distinct classes of Arabians the Aribah, the most
ancient tribes of Arabian tradition ; the Moutarribes, cre
ated, though not clearly defined, by the Joktan fable ; and the Moustarribes, or descendants of Ishmael. His Mou~ tarribes may be dismissed from consideration. Mahometan writers cannot be safely trusted when they touch this ques

tion of Arabian ethnology, discourse about Joktan, and seek to connect the race of their prophet with everything ancient or great in Arabian history.
COXCEEXIXG THE OLD RACE.
According to Arabian tradition, the old race, or the Cushconsisted originally of twelve tribes, with the follow
ing designations Ad, Thamoud, Tasm, Djadis, Amlik, Oumayim, Abil, Djourhoum, Wabar, Jasm, Antem, and IIa>hen. Some writers mention only nine ancient tribes of pure, unmixed Arabians; others mention more than twelve. As these t radii ions were not created by Mahometan assump
tion, they may preserve recollections of ancient nam
tribal communities, or of cities and districts organized as
separate municipalities, and governed by hereditary chiefs subordinate to the supreme authority. I shall end*
to show that this method of political organization -\\ marked peculiarity of the Cushitcs. One of the names
Amlik, is biblical, being the same as Amalek. The saying, "old as Ad," is used in Arabia to designate the remotest period in the past ; but we have no means to determine ei
ther the antiquity or the historical facts that may be indi
cated by these traditional names. In the traditions, the
ancient people to whom they are applied are described as
wonderful builders, who were rich in gold, silver, and precious stones. They have glowing descriptions of the magnificent cities and sumptuous palaces of the Adites and the Thamoudites. But, as I have shown, we have more conclusive testimony than Arabic tradition to indicate that Arabia was the land
of Cush, or Ethiopia ; and the great and extended influence of tlr.1 Cushite race in distant pie-historic times is now ad

milled by all careful investigators. The Arabic Semites
were a foreign people, very modern in Arabian history, and had nothing to do with the country in the ancient times
concerning which we inquire. That old Cushite race, so great and influential in its time, and so intimately connected with the most ancient civilization of which we have any
knowledge, has almost wholly disappeared from the earth by mingling with other races in the widely-separated regions where it established colonies and civilization ; with
the Aryans, and perhaps with an aboriginal population, in Southern and Western Europe ; with Semites and Aryans in Western Asia ; with Semites in Arabia, and with a dark brown race found by the ancient Cushites in India and Africa. But few communities of pure Cushite blood can now be found even in Arabia. Its great mission was ful
filled in the grandest way centuries before the beginning of what is called authentic history, and now we have only scanty remains of either the race or its language. The
great natural superiority of this race is still manifest wher
ever it is found with a tolerable approach to purity of blood. Some communities of the old race found in Arabia claim
to have unmixed blood. They strongly impressed Mr. Palgrave, who invites attention to them. At the northwest, where the Semites settled, there has been a greater decline
of civilization than elsewhere. Mr. Palgrave points out that the show of civilization increased as he proceeded
through the peninsula from Ma'an towards the east ; and, after much communication with the inhabitants of cities
and towns along his route, he recorded and published his
opinion of the people as follows : " After having traveled
much, and made pretty intimate acquaintance with many

races, African, Asiatic, and European, I should hardly be inclined to give the preference to any other over the genuine
unmixed clans of Central and Eastern Arabia." He say*
they represent " one of the noblest races earth affords,"
but does not appear to comprehend the real significance of these fragments of the old Cushite race, once so grand and powerful, now almost hidden from observation among
living races. He says again, in another part of his book,
"I am inclined to regard the Arabians, taken in themselves
and individually, as endowed witli remarkable aptitude for
practical and material science, and liardiy le.-s adapted to the railroad, to the steam-ship, or to ::ny other nineteenth century invention or natural research, than the native- <>i
Sheffield or Birmingham themselves; but lack of communication with other countries has kept them back in the intellectual race." It would not be reasonable to doubt
the natural capacity of a race whose people were anciently
represented by the marvelous manufacturing skill and commercial power of Sidon and Tyre. Arabia, once foremost, has been made the obscurest of countries by great changes
in the seats and routes of commerce. The C'ushite race lias
not been "kept back" from a givat part in human affairs; it has declined from a great position, and was made obscure by that influence of time which brought the world's
great changes and made another race imperial.
ANCIENT ARABIAN RUINS AND INSCRIPTIONS. .
Ruins representing ancient civilization exist in every part of Arabia, from Balbec and Petra to Mareb and Zha
far. They have not been carefully explored, and only a
few of them have been visited. No excavations have been made, but a considerable number of Cushite or Ilimyaric



First Discovery of Inscriptions. 81
inscriptions have been secured that furnish important in
formation concerning the language and race of the ancient inhabitants of the country. None of the ruins already vis
ited belong to the earlier periods of Arabian ancient histo
ry, and it is nowise likely that ruins representing times so very remote still exist for examination ; nevertheless, some of those to which attention has been drawn are very old.
The discovery of these antiquities, especially the inscriptions, seems to have been connected incidentally with measures taken by the English to facilitate communication with
India through Egypt and the Red Sea. About thirty-five years ago, nearly the whole coast-line of Arabia was sur
veyed or carefully explored by naval expeditions fitted out by the British East India Company. Some of the accom
plished officers engaged in these surveys traveled in Oman and Hadramaut, and visited ruins in Yemen and along the shores of the Red Sea. Among those wTho made important discoveries were Lieutenants Wellsted and Cruttenden, Dr.
Hulton, and, later, Captain Haines. Carsten Niebuhr had
previously reported the existence of inscriptions, and two or three had been very imperfectly copied by Dr. Seetzen. Wellsted and Cruttenden made the first discovery of
Himyaric inscriptions that were carefully copied. Wellsted visited important ruins at Nakab-el-Hadjar, between Hadramaut and Yemen. He found there the remains of
an immense wall, originally from thirty to forty feet high, and ten feet thick at the foundation. It was built around a hill of considerable extent, on a line above the base, and
was flanked by square towers standing at equal distances from each other. The blocks of grayish marble, of which it was built, were hewn and fitted by the builders with

tion of a high order. Within tiic inclosurc were the remains of edifices by which the slopes of the hill had been covered. Wellsted says of the wall: "The magnitude of
the stones used, and the perfect knowledge of the builder's art exhibited in the ctylc and mode of placing them to
gether, with its towers and great extent, would give this structure importance in any part of the world." Describ
ing one of the ruined buildings, IK- says :
" That it o\v
origin to very remote antiquity is evident by its appearance alone, which bears strong re- nnblance t<> Mmilar edi
fices found amidst Egyptian ruins. We have the same inclination of the walls as in them, the same form of entrance,
and the same Hat roof of stones." Important inscriptions in the old language and diameter, found on the smooth
liicc of the great blocks of stone at this place, were copied.
M. Fulgcnce Fresnel, in the Journal Asiatique, diseuWdlsted's discoveries at \akab-el-IIadjar, is sure, and with good reason, that these ruins mark the site of the ancient
city of Meyfah, which, lie thinks, is the same as the "' Mem
pha" of Ptolemy. It is undoubtedly the same as the old dty of "Mepha," not "Mempha," which Ptolemy places in the valley of Meyfah, where these ruins are found.
Among the ruins visited by Wellsted are those at lli>'n
(iliorab, on the coast in the same region. Ilis'n or Hawaii
Ghorab is a hill about five hundred feet hiirli. It is now connected with the main land by a low, sandy isthmus, but was formerly an island. All around it, and scattered over
its slopes to the summit, are ruins of houses, walls, an. I towers. It is a remarkable field of ruins, some parts of
which are almost inaccessible. Everything indicates that a commercial emporium formerly stood here a city which i:i ancient times must have been of the first importance.



The Ruins at Zhafar. 83
It is doubtless, as Fresncl and others suppose, the site of that celebrated commercial emporium anciently known as
the city of Kana. Here, too, Himyaric inscriptions, engraved on the smooth face of the rock, were discovered
and copied by the English visitors.
On the coast, in the northern part of Hadramaut, are the
ruins of a great commercial city called Zhafar, the Sapphar of Ptolemy, and supposed to be the Saphar of the Hebrew
Scriptures. The name Zhafar is now applied to a series
of villages situated on and near the coast. It is supposed
that the ancient Zhafar, or Saphar, stood at some distance from the sea, and was connected with it by a port or second
city at the place called El Belid in Arabic, and Kharekham in the Ehkkili or Himyaric tongue ; but these ruins, said
to be very remarkable " splendid ruins" Fresnel calls them
have not been explored as carefully as their importance demands. Perhaps what have been mentioned as sites of
the city and its port are in reality sites of an old and a
new town, a Paelus-Zhafar and a New Zhafar. Both are
now desolate. The " splendid ruins" are found at the place called El Belid, where the blocks of stone used by the arch
itects, cut with geometrical precision, show marvelous perfection in the workmanship of the builders. It is evident that the whole district now called Zhafar would yield rich
results to careful investigation by competent explorers. In July, 1 843, Thomas Jos. Arnaud, a French gentleman, visited the ruins of the very ancient city in the interior of Yemen known as Saba, and also as Mareb and Mariaba.*
* Abulfeda says: "There are some who say that Mareb was the surname of a king who reigned over Yemen ; but others say that Mareb was the royal arsenal, and that the city was Saba," which seems most
probable.

He is the first European who has visited those ruins in modern times and returned in safety. Arnaud went to Saba from San'a, remained there four days, and returned to the coast by the same road. He was five days on the road from San'a to Saba. "Within a day's journey of Saba he found very extensive and noteworthy ruins of a great
city, which he could not examine carefully. They occupy "a spacious site" on the great plain of Kharibah. lit- was told of other ruins in that part of the country, which he did not see, and particular mention was made of ruins of an ancient city situated about a day's journey northea>hr
ly from Kharibah. A village called Mareb, surrounded by extensive ruins, is all that now remains of the ancient
and celebrated Saba, once the populous and magnificent capital of Southern Arabia. At one period the whole country was known to the Greeks as Saba (called Sheba in the Hebrew Scriptures), and the people as Sabaeans ; and
language scarcely sufficed to express their conception of
its riches and magnificence. At Mareb Arnaud examined what remains of the "Great
Dike," or tank, so famous in Arabic tradition, but he does
not describe it satisfactorily. The embankment appears to have been a very long and exceedingly massive structure, and he tells us that the basin of the tank or reservoir was a depression between two mountains called "Balak." This dike is probably one of the oldest structures in Ara
bia of which we have any knowledge. The history of its origin was lost before the time of Queen Belkis, who is supposed to have lived in the age of Solomon, but may have
lived at an earlier period. It was then so very ancient
that the solid and vast embankment was going to decay

through age.* Queen Belkis repaired it, but her repairs
did not restore its original strength, for, a few ages later, it burst with such disaster to the whole district as made
the event an epoch in the history of Yemen.
Some writers, whose facility in reading Oriental languages is far superior to their capacity for comprehending
archaeological facts, and studying antiquity with penetrating intelligence, have allowed themselves to talk in a
doubtful, hesitating way in support of the strange and most incomprehensible vagary that this dike was not built earlier than the beginning of the Christian Era. They for
get that it was incontestably as old as the ancient city of Saba, if not much older, and that both the city and the
dike had decayed long before Christ. Mahometan assumption itself never invented a more unwarranted, a more ex
travagant, or a more senseless fiction.
Wellsted mentions the ruins of Kilhat, on the southern
coast of Oman, which " cover an extensive tract," and he was told of other ruins in the interior which he could not
visit. Strabo, Pliny, Ptolemy, and others, as well as the Hebrew writers, speak of great cities in Arabia which no
longer exist. We can not well doubt that diligent explo' ration would bring to light numerous ruins of great impor
tance to archa3ologists which at present are entirely unknown, and which the present inhabitants of the country cannot explain. The Mahometan natives residing near the
* Ilamza of Ispahan says : " The Himyarites relate that Belkis, having become qeeen, built in Saba the dike called Arim. The other inhabitants of Yemen dispute this, and maintain that the dike Arim was constructed
by Lokxnan, the second son of Ad ; and they say that time having brought it to a condition of decay, Belkis, on becoming queen, repaired the damage it had suffered." See UUnivers, vol. x., p. 53.

ruins visited by Wellstcd said, in reply to his inquiries,
that these old cities were built by their " infidel" ances
tors. He pointed out to them that their " infidel" ancestors
must have been vastly superior to the present generation of Arabians, and capable of much greater works; to which
1 hey answered that their ancestors were assisted by " Jins,'' or "Devils." Wellsted's suggestion has more significance than lie himself seems to have appreciated. AVhether we
study Arabia in its traditions, i:i its ruins, in the remains of its old language, or in the present characteristic* and condition of its people, we cannot easily evade the conclu
sion that this country was anciently the seat of a irivat civ
ili/ation, that declined from its highest condition long before the Christian Era, and of which only traces <f its im
pression on the country, and confused recollections of its
greatness, still exist. The old Arabian or Cushite inscriptions found in Kl llar
rah, a part of the region justly described as " the remarka
ble country south of Damascus," belong to Arabia. Mr. Cyril 0. Graham Lrave an account of them in the fci Asiatic Journal" for 1800. El Ilarrah is southeast and east of llaurau, where ruined or deserted cities exist with the
houses still nearly perfect. In El Ilarrah 3Ir. Graham
found similar remains of cities, with abundant inscriptions.
He tells us that when copies of the inscriptions were 1 laid
before the Royal Asiatic Society, " a high authority" declared them to be "the most ancient form of Phoenician
writing yet seen." Also, " Earth was immediately struck with their great similitude to the inscriptions of the Tou
aricks." He mentions reports of similar inscriptions in Jebel Shammar, and adds that "Wallin secured two in
scriptions r.t Belad Sof, in Central Arabia," like tlu

El Harrah, and that "lie found these characters constantly
recurring." One of the alphabetic characters in these in
scriptions is found nowhere else saA^e among the Runic letters, and another only in the Etruscan alphabet. Such
antiquities abound in the mysterious land of Cush, but they have not been explored, and in many respects Arabia
is still an undiscovered country.
Mr. Palgrave's lack of opportunities to study Arabian antiquities, and perhaps a not very active interest in this department of study, did not enable him to add much to our knowledge of the ruins and other remains of the ancient condition of the country. But, in his account of the
old castle at Menamah, on the largest of the Bahreyn isl
ands, we can see how strongly that venerable structure
invites attention. He points out the ruins in the Syrian
Desert, and he notices in the construction of the old castle
at the Djowf evidence of its very great antiquity. This castle has been several times rebuilt in part, or repaired, so
that only the south wall now preserves its first line of con
struction. In this wall, " the huge size and exact squaring of the stones in the lower tiers indicate the early date of the fabric, while several small windows, at a height of ten or twelve feet from the ground, are topped by what is
called the Cyclopean arch, a specimen of which may yet be seen in the so-called palace of Atreus at Mycena3." In Kasseem he found the remains of an ancient structure sim
ilar to Stonehenge in England, and he learned from his Arabian companions that two others like it could be found
in districts not far away from his route, which they named.*
He says, " There is little difference between the stone wondor of Kasseem and that of Wiltshire, except that one is

in Arabia, and the other, more perfect, in England." The huge stones, standing on end, about fifteen feet high, were arranged in a circle like those of Stonehenge. These structures evidently had the same purpose, and the builders in each case were directed by the same thought.
THE ANCIENT ARABIAN LAM ; V A i K.
Iii some respects, the most important discovery made in Arabia is that which brings to light the old language of
the country, and shows its affinity with that of Egypt and of Western Asia in the earliest times. In these studies
nothing is more reliable than the historical revelations of
tlu- science of language. They present facts which no ro
mancing of tradition or mythology can obscure. It lias
been determined by scientific inquiry that the people who first established civilization in Western Asia used a lan
guage that has been called Cushite, or Ilamitic. rvmie
scholars, like George Itawlinson, attracted by the fanciful linguistic scheme of Bunsen, have suggested a derivation
of this language from the "Turanian," a designation that has no very definite meaning in the science of language,
and which at first was used loosely to include nearly all
languages that could not be clawed as either Aryan or Semitic. Hence Mr. Rawlinson sometimes talks of the ear
liest speech of Western Asia as " Turanian," but points out that it was developed there as the Hamitic, or Cushite tongue, which in the most ancient times prevailed "from the Caucasus to the Indian Ocean, and from the shores of the Mediterranean to the mouths of the Ganges." Among
the ancient peoples who spoke this language he cl.
"the Southern Arabians, the early Canaanites, the early Chaldeans, and the Susianians." lie might have add--.-.



Cushite Speech found in Mahrah. 89
what is now well known, that dialects of this tongue were
spoken in Egypt, and throughout Northern and Eastern
Africa, The best linguistic scholars, those whose judgment is least affected by fanciful theorizing, explicitly reject the
" Turanian" speculation, and incline to the belief that these Hamitic or Cushite dialects must be classed by themselves
as a distinct family.
It is now beyond question that this Cushite tongue, found in the Chaldean ruins, and traced throughout West
ern Asia, was the ancient language of Arabia. No other
language was spoken in the country until, at a late period, the Ishmaelitish Semites went there. The Himyaric inscriptions show conclusively that tradition and the Eastern historians are correct in saying that the old language of Arabia was entirely different from what is known as Ara
bic. We learn from Arabic writers that dialects of the
Himyaric or Cushite tongue were spoken in Hadramaut, Mahrah, and some other parts of Eastern and Southern
Arabia, as late as the fourteenth century. They are still
spoken in Mahrah, an extensive region in Eastern Arabia, including the district where Mirbat and Zhafar are situated, and in the mountainous districts of Cape Mesandum ; and the Arabic used in many of the other eastern and southern communities is so filled with the vocabulary and forms of the old tongue that Semitic Arabs from the north can
not understand it. Dr. H. J. Carter, in the Bombay Jour
nal of July, 1847, said :
" The Mahrah dialect, as spoken by the Mahrahs themselves, is the softest and sweetest language I have ever heard." El Edrisi called this language
" the language of the people of Ad, which is ancient and unknown to the Arabians of our day."
It was formerly a saying of the Semitic Arabs that " who



90 Pi'c-Historic Nations.
ever enters Zhafar Ilimyarizes," which indicates thut the old language maintained itself there long after it had been
superseded in most of the other districts. In the Journal
Asiatiqua for June, 1838, Fresnel stated that the Ilimyaric language then spoken at Zhafar and Mirbat was some
what different from the dialect spoken in Mali rah, adding that, according to the best information he could obtain, the only difference was that "the Mahri contained a larger
proportion of Arabic words." Fresnel (not aware, probably, that Wellsted and his companions had found Hiin
yaric inscriptions somewhat earlier) claimed to be the dis
coverer oi'the Ilimyaric language. But his first perception of its importance was not very clear, for he announced this discovery to his scientific friends at Paris as follows :
"I
have discovered the language spoken at the court of the
Queen of Shcba, which is still spoken by the savages of .Mah rah !" He did not comprehend Arabia, and perhaps his chronology would not allow him to go much farther
back into the past. Dr. Forster, in the appendix to his
work on Arabian geography, glowed over the Ilimyaric inscriptions in a somewhat different way, finding in them
"the oldest language in the world," and "the first alphabet of mankind."
Neither the dialect nor the alphabet of the Himyaric in
scriptions already discovered can be regarded as extreme
ly ancient in the history of Cushite development, certainly
not as ancient as the cities which the ruins represent. We have older forms of both. The alphabet carried to Greece, Italy, and Western Europe by the Phoenicians belongs to a much older period, as we "can see in the number and form of the letters; and the characters of some inscriptions and
writings found in Western Asia evidently belong to an



Age of Himyaric Inscriptions. 01
earlier age. The dialect of the Himyaric inscriptions, however, is ancient and difficult to decipher, and the contents of many of them show that they are much older than Christianity, if not older than those found at Sidon". In publish
ing the Himyaric inscriptions preserved in the British Museum, Mr. Birch notices the suggestion of M. Caussin de Perceval that they may belong to a period of Arabian his
tory beginning not earlier than 100 years before Christ, and adds this criticism :
" As the later kings were greatly inclined to Judaism, it is possible that monuments such as these, full of invocations to idols, may belong to earlier
times of the empire." The Himyaric alphabet, described as the Musned, had been preserved by several Arabic writ
ers, and was easily understood. The difficulty in translat
ing arises chiefly from the antiquity of the dialect, which, nevertheless, is much later than that of the Chaldean in
scriptions.
CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF ALPHABETICAL WRITING.
It is found necessary to admit that the various styles of
alphabetic writing used by the nations of antiquity were all derived, directly or remotely, from a common source,
from a single form of writing, originated by some older people in the course of their own development. They all
belong to the same family, just as genetically related dialects and forms of speech constitute one family group, and furnish demonstration that they all proceeded from a single
primeval language. According to the Phoenicians, the art
was invented by Taautus, or Taut, " whom the Egyptians call Thouth ;" and the Egyptians said it was invented by
Thouth, or Thoth, otherwise called " the first Hermes ;" in which we see clearly that both Phoenicians and Egyptians



(J'2 Pre-Historic Nations.
referred the invention to a period older than their own
separate political existence, and to an older nation from which both peoples had received it.
Sir William Drummond, in his " Origines," said on this
point :
" There seems to be no way of accounting either for the early use of letters among so many different nations, or for the resemblance which existed between sotfie
of the graphic symbols employed by those nations, than by
supposing hieroglyphic writing, if I may be allowed the term, to have been in use among the Tsabaists in the first
ages after the flood, when Tsabaism (planet worship) wa> the religion of almost every country that was yet inhabit
ed." Sir Henry Kawlinson, directed by the influence of scientific inquiry, and with the facts before him in a clearer
light, says: "So great is the analogy between the first
principles of the science (of writing), as it appears to have been pursued in Chaldea, and as we can actually trace its
progress in Egypt, that we can hardly hesitate to assign the original invention to a period before the Hamite race
had broken up and divided. A system of picture-writing, which aimed at the communication of ideas through the
rude representation of natural objects, belonged, as it would si'cm, not only to the tribes who descended the Nile from
Ethiopia, but to those .also who, perhaps, diverging from the same focus, passed eastward to the valley of the Iv.i
phrates." (See Rawlinson's Herodotus, vol. i., p. 443.) It seems reasonable, therefore, to infer that Taut or Thoth represents the origin of the art of writing among the Hamitic or Cushite people in the earlier ages of their
existence, when they still dwelt together as a single united people, before the time of Egypt and Chaldea ; but the home of their civilization, from which their colonies



The oldest Forms of Writing. 03
went forth east and west, was not an African country, as Sir Henry Rawlinson appears to assume ; it must have been Arabia, as I have shown.
Alphabetic writing wrould naturally have its earliest development in the country where the hieroglyphic or picture style originated ; and, this country being Arabia, the
development of the simpler and more practical alphabetic style must have been hastened by the commercial habits and wants of the people. The nation that became mistress of the seas, established communication with every shore, and monopolized the commerce of the known world, must have substituted a simple phonetic alphabet for the hiero
glyphics as it gradually grew to this eminence; while isolated Egypt, less affected by the practical wants and tendencies of commercial enterprise, retained the hieroglyphic
system, and carried it to a marvelous height of perfection,
deriving from it, however, two simpler forms of writing first the hieratic, and at length the demotic.
The ruins of Egypt are covered with hieroglyphics, the
perfected Egyptian style appearing on the oldest monuments. That this form of writing was laid aside very early by other branches of the Cushite or Hamitic race is evinced by the fact that the only fragments of it found in remains
of other peoples of this race appear on a broken tablet
'from the Mesopotamian ruins, now in the British Museum. Sir Henry Rawlinson finds in the writing on this tablet
" several of the primitive forms of natural objects from which the cuneiform characters wT ere subsequently elabo
rated." There are not less than six different styles of the cuneiform writing,,that found in the Chaldean ruins seem
ing to be the oldest. There is nothing to show how many
forms of hieroglyphical writing came into use before this



.94 Pre-Historic Nations.
style was perfected in Upper Egypt, and superseded else
where by alphabets. The oldest Cusliite alphabet known to us is that which the Phoenicians carried' to Southern and Western Europe,
which, however, was not preserved without modification. The names of its letters, and some of their forms, show that
it was derived originally from- hieroglyphics. Aleph means an ox ; Bit, Bith, or Beth, a house or temple ; and Ganu-1
or Gimcl, a camel, an animal very naturally represented in ancient Arabian hieroglyphics, but not likely to appear in
a hieroglyphical system originating in any country where the camel is not found.
The invention of this alphabet, from which all the alphabets of modern Europe have been derived, was attributed
to the Phoenicians. Pliny (lib. v., ch. xii.) ascribes to the
Phoenicians "the great glory of inventing letters1 ' u
//'*'/
gens Phoznicum in gloria magnet litcrarum inventionis." This appears to have been commonly said among Greeks and Romans. They could have said, more correctly, that
letters originated in the country of which anciently Phti-nicia was one of the more important districts. Anwhen Pliny described the Phoenicians as "the firM d;
erers of the sciences of astronomy and navigation," he would have been more accurate if, instead of "the Phoenicians," he had said the ancient Ethiopians or Cushites of
Arabia. The original country of the CY.shite race, to which
the Phoenicians belonged the original home where this culture had birth, and from which the Cnshite colonies and
influence went forth in every direction to spread civiliza
tion, and create such nations as Egypt and Ohaldea, was not merely the little district of Phoenicia it was the whole
Arabian peninsula.



Arabian Antiquity Remote. 95.
ANCIENT HISTORY OF ARABIA.
I can imagine nothing that would shed so great a light on the pre-historic ages as an accurate history of Arabia from the beginning of its civilization. Histories of that
country were undoubtedly written before and after the time when Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt under one government, for in that old time, so far away from us
in the deepest antiquity, Arabia was the foremost country of the world. The people that originated the art of writing did not fail to have writers of their own annals. Never
theless, their ancient history cannot HOW be produced, for not only their own literature perished, but also that of the
next succeeding nations, and, for more than twenty-five hundred years, no other country with which our civilization is connected has been so completely withdrawn from the observation of what we call history. It has been a
mystery, an unreal country, and failure to see its historic
importance has left many important problems of Ancient History without proper solution. And yet a weird influence of its great past is felt whenever inquiry turns to its ancient history ; and now and then
a writer wonders that " a nation whose history ascends without interruption to so remote an origin, and whose
name has been so celebrated, should have its political infancy shrouded in so thick a mist of doubt and oblivion." Even .from this writer its grandest ages are hidden under
that phrase " its political infancy." These ages are shrouded in doubt and oblivion, partly because they are so re
mote. We consider Egypt and Chaldea very old, but the culture and political organization of the Arabian Cushites
were much older; they belong to what both Egyptians



96 Pre-Historic Nation*.
and Chaldeans regarded as antiquity. Time, that wastes all things human, and buries nations out of sight, has not
spared the primeval history of this oldest of civilized peo
ples. Add to this that the distance from us in time of the
beginnings of the Cushite civilization is so vast as to frighten the current chronologies into absolute lunacy, and we shall cease to wonder that the early histoiy of Arabia has been so buried in oblivion, and so discredited by the chro
nologists that it has failed to command much attention, or
even to be thought of as a reality. This antiquity of civilization in Arabia is necessary to
explain the facts that, in the oldest recorded traditions, Arabia is the land of dish, the celebrated Ethiopia of vcry
remote times, and that, according to the testimony of lin
guistic and archaeological science, the first civilizers in Western and Southwestern Asia and in the Nile Vallcy were a people described as Cushites or Hamites. These
facts are incontestable; but, while it is necessary to accept what they signify, we have no chronology for the scheme
of Arabian history which they suggest. Guided, however, by what we know of the antiquity of civilization in Egypt
and Chaldea, we may suppose as probable that the history of the ancient Cushite civilization was somewhat as
follows :
1. There was the primeval period of first development and growth. Did the original culture of the Cushite civ
ilizers come to them from a still older civilization? or was
it originated entirely by themselves, without assistance
or stimulus from abroad ? We cannot answer these ques
tions. Man was created capable of improvement, and no very long period could have elapsed before the use of reason
and the almost spontaneous activity of the aptitude for in



Was it 8000 Years B.C.? 97
vention in providing for the wants of life began to create
civilization. This development would necessarily be greatest and swiftest in the most highly gifted families and under the most favorable circumstances. If the first appearance of the human race on earth be as far back in the
past as it seems necessary to believe, the Cushite civilization could not have been the oldest development of civil
ized life in human history, It is, however, the oldest of which we have any trace. It may have been original ; and
therefore the period of its beginning, and its growth to the condition out of which grew its eminence in commercial
and colonizing enterprise, may have been very long. 2. The period of colonizing enterprise, commercial greatness, and extensive empire. Early in this period Cushite colonies were established in the valleys of the Nile and of
the Euphrates, which in subsequent ages became Barbara, Egypt, and Chaldea. Its beginning could not have been later than 7000 or 8000 years before Christ, and it may
have begun much earlier. The Cushites occupied India, Western Asia to the Mediterranean, and extensive regions
in Africa. In this period they brought to full development that knowledge of astronomy and of other sciences, fragments of which have come down to us through the nations they created and by which they were succeeded. The vast
commercial system by which they brought together " the ends of the earth" was created, and that unrivaled emi
nence in maritime and manufacturing skill was developed, which the Phrenicians retained down to the time of the Hellenes and the Romans. In this period were the grand
est ages of the great empire of Ethiopia, or Cusha-dwipa. 3. The period of disintegration, when Egypt and Chaldea became separate countries, and the Sanskrit branch of

the Aryan race invaded and occupied Northern India. This period may have begun about 5000 years before the Christian Era. But the Arabian Cushites, having control of Arabia, Southern India, many colonies on the Mediterra
nean, and extensive districts in Africa, were still unrivaled in power and commercial dominion. At length came a
time, for which there is nothing to suggest a probable date, when, under control of the people called Phoenicians, Northern Arabia, Syria, and the -connected communities on the Mediterranean became a separate dominion. There is
some reason for supposing (as I shall presently show) that the rest of the peninsula was divided into two kingdoms, not later than from about 3000 to 3500 B.C. one includ
inir Yemen, Hadramaut, the Hedjaz, and other western districts; and the other consisting of Oman, the districts to\\anK the Persian Gulf, and the whole region known as
Irak Arabi to the Euphrates, of which Zohak, celebrated in
Iranian history, was a famous ruler.
4. The period of continued decline, which finally brought
the Arabian peninsula to its present condition. Much of what is usually written as "the History of Arabia before
Islamism'' belongs to this period. The country was di
vided into five or six separate kingdoms, of which that de
scribed by the Greeks as Saba was the most important.
The Phoenicians, finally restricted in Asia to the little dis
trict immediately connected with their great cities, and
the rich and still enterprising people of Southern Arabia, called Sabeans and Himyarites, continued to represent what remained of the old Cushite civilization down to a period comparatively quite modern. But the ancient glory of the
country departed previous to the rise of the Assyrian empire, in the thirteenth century before Christ; and, not long



The Greeks on Arabia. 99
before the beginning of the Assyrian period, the whole northern portion of the peninsula was invaded and over
run by Semites, chiefly nomadic, who occupied the Hedjaz,
became permanent inhabitants, and finally originated Mahometanism. The Land of Cush was transformed. In the absence of regular historic annals, any scheme of
Arabian history that takes in all its periods must be chiefly
hypothetical. Beyond a few important facts that may be used to guide supposition, there is nothing to enlighten us.
We learn something from the traditions of antiquity ; the
Hebrew Scriptures tell us something ; the old ruins of the East furnish some light ; and in Mahometan histories of Arabia there are passages that seem to present a few confused recollections of what was written in the lost annals
of the country ; but a regular and accurate historical ac
count of ancient Arabia is no longer possible. If the Greeks had studied the country carefully, and written its
history with such intelligence as the libraries of Egypt and Phoenicia then made possible, it would have had a prominent place in our studies of ancient history. But to them
Arabia was already very obscure, and their knowledge of the peninsula was nearly as vague and visionary as that which has prevailed in modern times.
GREEK NOTICES OF ARABIA.
Herodotus, writing more than twenty -three centuries
ago, had no perception of the historic importance of Arabia. To him it was a land of rare and marvelous productions, but he seems to have had no knowledge whatever of the great commerce with India and other countries at the East, still monopolized by the Southern Arabians. He says: "Arabia is the farthest of the inhabited countries



100 Pre-Historic Nations.
towards the South ; and this is the only region in which
grow myrrh, frankincense, cinnamon, and ledanum. All
these, except myrrh, the Arabians gather with difficulty." Then follows a rehearsal of certain cunning stories, worthy
of the " Thousand and One Nights," put in circulation by the Arabians to hide their commerce from the Western
nations. It was understood that all spices and perfumes, and most other rich and royal products, came from that
country; and Herodotus, like others of his time, supj.nM.-d they were all produced there. His knowledge and appreciation of the country seem to have been fully expr
in his exclamation, " There breathes from Arabia a divine odor!" He knew no more, and nowhere else in the Greek litera
ture of that age, or of any subsequent age, do we find a
more intelligent account of Arabian history, geography, or commerce. Enough was known of the country to create a
feeling of something rich and strange, something iincom
prehended and mysterious, and Greek writers who gained some general knowledge of Southern Arabia were moved to exhaust the power of language in attempts to describe
its riches. There may have been something more in the
lost geographical work of Artemidorus of Ephesus, although the extract in Strabo indicates little more than vis
ionary ignorance ; but nothing beyond this has been preserved. Diodorus Siculus, after an extravagant description of" the perfumes of Arabia, which ravished the senses,"
and " were conveyed by the winds to those who sailed near
the coast," proceeded (bk. iii., ch. iii.) as follows :
" Having never been conquered, by reason of the largeness of their country, they flow in streams of gold and sil
ver; and likewise their beds, chairs, and stools have their

feet of silver ; and all their household stuff is so sumptu
ous and magnificent that it is incredible. The porticoes of their houses and temples, in some cases, are overlaid with
gold. The like wonderful cost they are at throughout
their whole buildings, adorning them, in some parts, with
silver and gold, and in others with ivory, precious stones, and other things of great value, for they have enjoyed a
constant and uninterrupted peace for many ages and generations."
Agatharchides is quoted thus : "The Sabeans surpass- in wealth and magnificence not
only the neighboring barbarians, but all other nations whatsoever. As their distant situation protects them from all
foreign plunders, immense stores of precious metals have
been accumulated among them, especially in the capital.
Curiously-wrought gold and silver drinking vessels in great variety ; couches and tripods wTith silver feet ; an incredi
ble profusion of costly furniture in general ; porticoes, with large columns partly gilt and capitals ornamented with wrought silver figures ; roofs and doors ornamented with gold fretwork set with precious stones ; besides an extra
ordinary magnificence reigning in the decorations of their houses, where they use silver, gold, ivory, and the most precious stones, and all other things that men deem most valuable. These people have enjoyed their good fortune from the earliest times undisturbed."
These descriptions bring out one important fact. The Greeks believed Arabia had been a seat of enlightened civ
ilization and of a great commerce " from the earliest times ;" and yet, so far as we know, it never occurred to any Greek
scholar to study the history of this land of marvelous
wealth, and trace " from the earliest times" the develop



102 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
ment of its civilization and commercial enterprise. The Greeks of the Hellenic period knew less of distant countries than was known in the time of Homer. Their geo
graphical knowledge was confined chiefly to the regions around the JEgean and the Eastern Mediterranean. The
prevalent ignorance of more distant regions is shown by a statement of that insatiate reader and collector of informa
tion, the Elder Pliny, who says (lib. vi., ch. xxiv.) :
" Taprobane (Ceylon), under the name of the 'land of the Autochthones,' was long looked upon as another world ; the age and arms of Alexander the Great were the first to give
satisfactory proof that it is an island/' Telling what he
had learned concerning the Arabians, he says, "Arabia is in
ferior to no country throughout the whole world." Speak
ing of the "Omani," or people of Oman, he refers to " their once- famous cities," which "at the present time are wil
dernesses." He mentions " Homna and Attana, which, our merchants say, are at the present time the most famous towns on the Persian Sea." His estimate of the Arabians is summed up as follows : " Take them all in all, they are the richest nation in the world."
ARABIAN RECOLLECTIONS OF THE PAST.
Mahometan writers on the history of Arabia give us a lew vague recollections of the ancient condition of the
country ; but the old Cushitc literature, locked up in a
strange tongue, and fiercely cursed by their religion, had all disappeared long before they began to study the subject. Moreover, their first writings on the history of Arabia were several centuries later than the time of Mahomet. The Arabian Semites were probably the rudest and least
civilized inhabitants of the peninsula. Most of them were

nomads, although they had some settled communities, and
some knowledge of reading and writing. The first Mahometans were not a literary people, and no attempt was made to write even the life of their prophet until more than a century after his death, towards the close of the Ommiade dynasty of caliphs. The culture for which the caliphate was celebrated did not come from Koreish Arabs,
nor did it greatly affect them, but it affected the Arabic
language ; and the literary activity it created produced
not only poetry, philosophy, and science, but also biographies of Mahomet and histories of Arabia. Among those who wrote on Arabian history and geography with most care and ability were Al Tabiri of Tabreez, who wrrote in the 10th century of the Christian Era; El Mas'udi, who died about 957 A.D. ; Nuwayri, surnamed Al Kendi, who died
about 1340 A.D. ; Abulfeda, prince of Hamah, in Syria, who died in 1345 A.D. ; Hamza of Ispahan, who died about 968 A.D. ; and El Edrisi, who was born about 1099 A.D. The time of Mahomet was becoming ancient when these men wrote. They had no materials for a regular and in
telligent history of even the later periods of the country, and, if they had been supplied with such materials in abundance, the overwhelming influence of Mahometan
prejudice and assumption would have made a proper use
of them impossible. Mahometanism, treating everything Arabian but itself as antichrist if it could not be made
tributary to the Prophet and his race, was incapable of being a faithful historian of the old Cushite civilization.
Nevertheless, Mahometan writers give us traditions and facts, in which successive periods of the ancient history of
Arabia are clearly indicated. They all agree that Kahtan, celebrated in the most authentic traditions, represents a



104 Pre-Historic Nations.
great epoch, which was preceded by the misty ages of Ad and other representative persons or names, and followed by historical periods beginning with great political changes, represented by Saba and Himyar. The Mahometans, by substituting the Semitic Joktan for Kahtan, and by attempting to reconstruct all Arabian history around the
Ilimyarite kings, have entangled the subject in great confusion. This was quite sufficient; but the rabbinical spirit
and chronological dogmatism of modern times have <Lr<>ne
farther, and made this confusion a hopeless jungle of ab
surdities. To see anything clearly, wo must put aside 1 IK-SI
perverting interpretations, and consider the traditions and facts for ourselves without regard to what has been said of them by Mahometan egotism, rabbinical ignorance, or
(also chronology. 1. The traditions quoted as authentic by all Mahometan writers on Arabia describe a period of civilization before
the time of Kahtan. To this period are assigned Ad,Tha
moud, and the representative names of persons and peoples associated with them. Arabian tradition knows nothing older than Ad. It associates with him and with his time
the beginnings of civilized life. It represents the Adites,
Thnmoudites, and their contemporaries as enterprising, rich, and powerful, says they had great cities and wonderful
magnificence, and declares that they finally disappeared from the earth under the curse of heaven on their pride and arrogant idolatry. Mahometan ardor tells romantic stories of their marvelous cities, and of the miraculous judgments by which they were blasted. This traditional lore evidently preserves faint and confused recollections
of a great period of civilization that had decaying monu
ments, ruined cities, and mysterious antiquities before the



KaJitan in Arabian History. 105
time of Kahtan. Its wondrous creations and grand politi
cal supremacy disappeared, not in fiery storms of wrath from heaven, but under the influence of time and change.
2. In Arabian tradition Kahtan occupies a position similar in some respects to that of Kaiamors in Iranian history.
It is pointed out that there were ages of civilization before his time, and yet he is described as the ancestor of nearly the whole Arabian people. According to the traditions as reconstructed by Mahometanism, his descendants repeopled the country with the race known as the Aribah, or Arabians of pure blood, and he is celebrated as the primal personage of the Arabian world. Laying aside the Mahom
etan fables, we may suppose, not unreasonably, that Kahtan represents the time when the old Cushite communities
in Southern, Eastern, and Central Arabia were politically separated from those at the north. That must have beeft
a very important epoch in Arabian history. Egypt and Chaldea had already become separate empires ; the Aryans had entered Northern India ; other important changes had occurred ; and now what remained of the old Cushite em
pire was divided, by a line running through Arabia itself, into two separate dominions one at the north, under Phoe
nician supremacy, the other at the south and cast,, reorgan
ized, we suppose, by Kahtan. Whether Kahtan actually
represents the beginning of this new era must, however, be left to conjecture ; an accurate history of that time
might give- the historical significance of this personage a
diflerent explanation. He belongs to a remote age, and could not have been later than the time when Martu or
Marathus, mentioned in the earlier Chaldean inscriptions, was the ruling city at the north.*

3. In the traditions, Saba, described as a descendant of
Kahtan, is the next personage who represents an important historical epoch. The legends connect him with the south
western quarter of the peninsula, and with a kingdom that seems to have included Yemen, Hadramaut, the Hedjaz, and other districts. That very ancient Cushite temple the oldest temple in existence known as the Caaba was
situated in the Hedjaz, and for this reason, it may be, the
traditions say much more of this kingdom than of any other part of Arabia. Saba may represent the time when the provinces included in the kingdom of Saba and the
I limy a rites were separated from those in the opposite quarter, including Oman and the districts on the Persian Gulf. It is known that such a division existed long before the Christian Era, and that the southwestern kingdom, less affected by the great changes in Western Asia, and more largely devoted to commerce and maritime enterprise, preserved its existence much longer than the other. Saba
was probably the first sovereign of this monarchy alter the separation. Xuwayri makes him its founder and first
ruler; and Djennabi, who wrote in the sixteen! li century of the Christian Era, gives it a duration of three thousand
years. 4. Himynr, a descendant of Saba, is another royal per
sonage to whom special but unexplained historical importance is attached. He begins the line of Himyarite kings,
and Mines of Gems" is the following: "There are two famous places on earth, the Iwan (of the Kosrous at Ctesiphon), and the Ghomdan (of the kings of Yemen) at Sana ; and there are only two great royal families, the
Sassanians and the Khatanites. " We have not been accustomed to see in Arabia one of the greatest and most ancient royal families. It was different in El Mas'udi's time.

and his name has been given to both the people and lan
guage of the country. Nuwayri places the beginning of his reign in the year 1430 B.C., and says there were sixteen sovereigns between him and Queen Belkis, whose reign began in the year 991 B.C. This makes Belkis con
temporary with Solomon. According to Hamza of Ispa
han, the Himyarite monarchy was divided " during fifteen
generations," at a very indefinitely dated period after the time of Himyar. This division was the result of a feud between the descendants of Himyar and those of his broth
er Kahlan. During the time of this division, one family
reigned at Saba, while the other reigned at Zhafar. Other writers mention this fact. The kingdom was finally re
united under Harith-el-Raisch. He was called Tobba, as
the Egyptian kings were called Pharaohs, " because," it is
said, " the united people followed (tabbahou) his laws ;" and all his successors bore this title. This explanation of
the title, however, may not be correct; -it is not shown that it was not in use before the separation. The rule of
the Himyarite kings was terminated nearly a century and a half before the time of Mahomet by an invasion from
Abyssinia.
The varying and contradictory dynastic lists of kings after the time of Saba, constructed by Mahometan writers,
would be masterpieces of confusion and absurdity if they were not outdone by the insane chronology, and worse than Mahometan assumption, of those learned Orientalists who
place Himyar only 381 years before Christ, and bring Belkis into the first century after Christ. It seems necessary to remind these astonishing chronologists that the Hebrew
Scriptures make it certain that a " queen of Sheba" ruled this kingdom in the time of Solomon. This must be ac

cepted as an established fact ; but, while the dates of the Mahometan historians are more credible and respectable than those of some modern scholars, who have applied a,
false chronology to the history of Arabia, it is necessary to admit that neither their dates nor their dynastic lists can be trusted. Their dates lack the evidence that would make
them authentic, and their lists of Sabean and Himyarite
kings include sovereigns who evidently belong to ages more ancient, while in other respects they are confused, arbitrary, and unwarranted. Nevertheless, among the mate-rials collected by these writers there are royal names and
brief historical fragments that engage attention.
i KA,MI:NTS OF OLD ARABIAN HISTORY.
An ancient Arabian sovereign, usually called -Zohak, is mentioned in the traditions as an enterprising and power
ful conqueror. He is sometimes connected with the most
ancient people of the country, but there is nothing in Ara
bic literature to make certain the time of his reign. It is
stated in the chronicle of Tabiri that " Zohak was in pos
session of the whole of Irak Arabi, with Tabristan, Khezlan,
Gurgan or Jurgan, and, in short, of all the territory in this direction to the very borders of Hindustan, which he (and
his successors) governed with paramount sway during a period of 260 years." The Iranian historians give a more
particular account of Zohak. According to some of them, he was the son of an Arabian king named Mirtas. Others add that his mother was a sister of Jemshid. All acjree that he was an Arabian. It is stated that he dethroned Jemshid, and made himself master of the kingdom of Iran
or Hiras ; that " he slew and partook of all animals indifferently, whether destructive or harmless" (which was in



Iranian History on Zohak. 109
violation of the religious code of Iran), " so that the detesta
ble practice became general ;" and that, long afterwards,
" when Feridun had purged the land of Zohak's tyranny,"
the " detestable practice" could not be entirely overcome. In the Iranian books Zohak is described as Deh-ak and
Dizakh, "the Tasi," usually translated "the Arabian." A
note in the Desatir says, " Taz is the supposed father of the Tasis (or Arabians)." The word Taz reminds us of the original Arabian tribe of Tasm. Zohak probably claimed descent from Tasm. The commentary on the Desatir tells
us that " Zohak was of the race of Taz," and that " he paid
assiduous worship to Yezdam (the Supreme Being) and to the stars, on which account Yezdam granted him his wishes ; but, during his reign, he annoyed harmless animals." He is also charged with grave crimes. Much of the accusing execration bestowed upon Zohak is probably due to the fact that his religion was that of the Arabians, and not that of the Iranians or Hirasis.
According to Berosus, a foreign dynasty of kings, called "Median," ruled Chaldea during 224 years. This dynasty
was probably the result of a conquest of the country by
Zohak. The term " Median" has occasioned much doubt
ful speculation; some supposing it to "mean Turanians or
Magians, and others, in despair, suggesting a corruption of the word actually used by Berosus. But Madian or Midian was the name of an important branch of the Arabian people; and in Irak Arabi there was a district and a great city called Madain. Sadik Isfahani said in his geography,
" Madain was a celebrated city of Irak Arabi. It was called Madain because it' was the largest of the seven Madain, or cities of Irak." Wherein is it unreasonable to suppose
that Zohak, having conquered Chaldea, selected from his



110 Pi'c-Histuric Nation*.
immediate followers a Madian prince to be its ruler? Or
that he annexed it to the Madam territory of the prince or king who ruled under him in Irak Arabi, with which C'hal
dea was immediately connected ? I shall show, in another
place, that the " Median" dynasty of Berosus could not have begun in Chaldea much later than about 3000 years be I'm v
Christ; and an average of the varying statements of Irani
an writers gives this as very nearly the d.-ite of Jemshid and Zohak.
An Arabian sovereign called Schamar-Iarasch, rim al><> Srhamar-Iarasch-Abou-Karib, is described by Hamza, Nuwayri, and others, as a powerful ruler and conqueror, who carried his arms successfully far into Central Asia. It is said that he became master of all the countries in that di
rection, occupied Samarcand for a long time, and even invaded China. In proof of the conquests of this sovereign, llamza states that an edifice formerly existed at Samar
cand bearing this inscription in the Himyarite or Cushiulanguage and characters: "In the name of God, Schamarlarasch has erected this edifice to the sun, his Lord." Ami
Abulfeda says in his Geography, "Ibn-IIankal states that
he saw on one of the gates of Samarcand, called KescJt, an iron plate bearing an inscription said by the inhabitants to be Himyaric ; and they told him that the gate was built by the king or Tobba of Arabia." Ibn-IIankal added that this gate was destroyed during a sedition that arose while he
was there. Langles states in a note on Norden's " Travels" that such inscriptions still existed at Samarcand in the four
teenth century j and Humboldt, referring to these facts. U sure that "some connection existed between ancient Ethiopia and the elevated plain of Central Asia." At what time in the past did these extensive Arabian



Ancient Arabian Conquerors. Ill
conquests take place ? Not during the time of either the Assyrian empire, or of the Persian empire established by
Cyrus the Great, and, certainly, not at any later period. It was previous to the period of the Assyrian empire, which, according to the best estimates, began in the year 1273 before Christ. The History of Berosus informs us that, during
the 245 years previous to the rise of Assyria to imperial power, Chaldea was governed by an Arabian dynasty of nine kings. The time of these Arabian kings extended
from 1518 to 1273 B.C., and this is the latest period to which the conquests of Schamar-Iarasch can be assigned. He, or some other Arabian monarch, conquered Chaldea at
the beginning of this period. We may, therefore, reasonably suppose that the occupation of Central Asia, and the invasion of China by Arabians, was connected with this
conquest. There is mention of Arabian monarchs who marched far into Africa and waged war with " Maghrib ;" and one of them, called Afrikis or Afrikin, is said to have marched his army to the Atlantic Ocean. Maghrib is an ancient name
of Mauritania, which is sometimes called Maghrib-ul-Aksa. The old Arabian Cushites, in the great days of their empire,
occupied or controlled the larger part of Africa, as I shall endeavor to show in another place. Doubtless their establishments in Central Africa were retained down to the first
period of the Himyaric kings. Under these circumstances, wars with Maghrib were not unlikely ; and a march through Africa by a monarch occupying its central countries could
not have been a very difficult afiair. Harith-el-Raisch, by
whom, it is said, the divided kingdom of Hadramaut and
Yemen was reunited, is celebrated as a sovereign of remarkable genius and character. He made the reunion

complete and permanent, greatly enlarged the power of the kingdom, and extended his conquests to India.
None of these historical fragments and traditions, however, refer to the earlier periods of Arabian civilization and
greatness ; none of them reach back to the ages previous to the epoch when the northern provinces and colonial possessions of Arabia were politically separated from the rest
of the peninsula; but they show distinctly that the coun
try was very great and very powerful, even in its periods of disintegration and decline. The Greek and Sanskrit tra
ditions and mythological narratives relate to more anc'u-nt
tinu-s, and give us the names of some of the earlier rulers of
the Land of Cush, such as Dionytos, Kepheus, and others. It is unreasonable not to see what is signified by the tradi
tions concerning Dionysos. He was one of the greatest and most influential sovereigns the world has ever known, if we
may judge by that ineffaceable impression of his great m-ss left behind him in Egypt, India, and throughout A\YsU-rn
Asia. In Egypt he was deified as Osiris, and I shall speak of him more at length in what I have to say of the Cushite
origin and civilization of that country.
THE CUSHITE SYSTEM OF POLITICAL ORGANIZATION.
The ancient Arabians had a peculiar system of political
organization, which went with them to every land they col
oni/.ed. The traces, remains, and, sometimes, nearly perllvt forms of it still remaining in countries where their influence was most powerful and permanent, should be classed witli
the characteristic and suggestive antiquities of that legendary race. "We see the Phrenicians come into history with
a political system radically different from that of any other people of antiquity, excepting those peoples on the Meditcr

ranean who were originally formed by their influence. Their
cities, with connected districts, were separate municipalities, completely organized, and controlled more or less by popular influence. They established the same system in Greece, and along the coast of Asia Minor, long before either Greeks
or Pelasgians were mentioned in those -regions. They carried it to Italy and Northern Africa. It prevailed anciently in Arabia from Phoenicia to the Indian Ocean, and it ex
ists there still. We see it in Mr. Palgrave's account of the
political organization of the kingdom of Oman. He says :
" Oman is less a kingdom than an aggregation of muni
cipalities ; each town, each village, has its separate existence and corporation ; while towns and villages, in their turn, are subjected to one or another of the ancestral chiefs, who
rule the provinces with an authority limited, on one side, by the traditional immunities of their vassals, and, on the
other, by the prerogatives of the crown. These prerogatives [of the crown] consist of the right to nominate, and (on complaint) to depose local governors, although the office remains always in the same family ; to fix and levy port and custom-house dues ; to have exclusive management of the navy ; to keep a small standing army of six or seven hun
dred men ; and to transact all foreign affairs, for alliance or treaty, peace or war. The administration of justice and the decision of criminal cases are reserved to the kadis and the
local royal judges. In short, the whole course of law is
considered to be entirely independent of the sovereign, except in very extraordinary circumstances. Again, the taxes levied on land or goods (sea-port commerce excepted) are fixed and immutable save by local or municipal authority ; the sultan enjoys, but can not change them." Here we have the remains of that ancient political system



r re-Historic Nations.
of the Arabian Cushites which regulated the organization of the Pho3nician communities, created similar communities in Asia Minor and around the ^Egean Sea, and thus determined
the conditions that, in later tunes, brought into existence
the Ionian confederacy, and the " fierce democracies" of the Grecian peninsula. Some of the best preserved forms of this system ar.e found among the African Berbers, such as the McZabs and the Touaricks ; but remains or traces of it
appear, with other antiquities of that old race, in India, as well as in Africa, and even in Western Europe. The local
municipalities, or "village republics," as they have been called, still existing in India, were noticed by Arrian. ami they are described in English accounts of the country ; but
I shall speak of them more particularly in another place. The "free cities" of the Middle Ages of Europe, which were recognised but not created by the governments of the new
ly-organized nations, must have had their origin in this old system, especially those of France and Spain.* They were
organized municipalities long before Spain and Franc. isted, as we know them. The same system has been universal among the Basques from time immemorial ; and their right to live under their own laws, and manage their own
affairs without dictation, was not interfered with until, un
der the late sovereign of Spain, Queen Isabella, their muni
cipal prerogatives were suppressed because they took the
side of Don Carlos in the civil war. Could we have a complete and authentic history of the

Remains of the Cushite System. 115
various municipalities of Phoenicia from the time of Martu
to the beginning of the Carthaginian period, the actual character of this old Cushite system might be seen more
clearly. Probably it was not very democratic. Very like
ly there were " principal classes" who controlled the commonwealths. There may have been a more or less exclusive system of citizenship. At the head of each munici
pality there appears to have been a hereditary local prince or chief. Among the Phoenicians, as we see them in his
tory, the general organization seems to have been a loose fraternal confederacy, much looser probably than circumstances made possible under the great kings of ancient Arabia, much farther removed from consolidation than the pres
ent governments of the Arabian peninsula. But a people so active and enterprising, and so largely devoted to manu
factures, commerce, and maritime undertakings, would naturally demand and secure a political system based on mu
nicipal organizations that would allow them to manage
their own aifairs.
The traditions of the Cushite race in Arabia indicate
that they had this system from the beginning. Their traditionary myths and legends, unlike those of most ancient peoples, do not describe a national beginning when they
were formed and organized by a great sovereign who taught them civilization, overwhelmed their enemies, and gave them national existence. On the contrary, they tell us that this Cushite nation first appeared in Arabia in nine
or more tribes or communities, separately organized, and governed by chiefs whose names are given. At the head of these chiefs or princes was Ad, who appears to be rec
ognised as the first ruler of the nation. The significance
of these traditions is unequivocal. They show us that, in



116 Pre-Historic Nations.
the earliest times, the Cushite system made the nation con
sist of an " aggregation of municipalities." There is no recollection of any other system, and we find no other that can be traced to this race in any part of the world where
their colonies and their influence were established.
CU6HITE SCIENCE, ASTRONOMICAL AND NAUTICAL,
There is a passage in Aristotle's De Coelo, lib. iL, cap. xii., frequently cited or mentioned, which reads as follow-:

o/y.sv rvations of other stars are described by the Egyptians
and Babylonians, who anciently, and for many ages, made
astronomical observations, and from whom many things worthy of credit have come to us conc< rnimj the stucral con
ttdfations. Aristotle might have given, from the records sent him by Callisthenes, a more extended account of the great at
tainments of the Chaldeans in astronomy, unless we are to
suppose he lacked a competent knowledge of the language in which those records were written. The priests of an
cient Egypt were skilled in astronomy. During many ages they were accustomed to make and record observa
tions. According to a statement of Diogenes Laertius, he had ascertained that they had preserved records of 373



Chaldean and Egyptian Astronomy. 117
solar and 832 lunar eclipses. Bunsen assumed, too readi
ly, that the eclipses observed were all total, or nearly so, and therefore "must have extended over 10,000 years."
The assumption being unwarranted, the inference fails ; in Egypt, however, the study of astronomy was very ancient ; there, as well as in Chaldea, in the more ancient times, we must suppose it reached higher results than were attained
in later times. In Egypt, and " other countries at the
East," Pythagoras and other Greeks found the heliocentric
system, which we call Copernican a system which they accepted without fully comprehending the science that produced it, and which the Greek world, more remarkable for literature and art than for mathematical and astronomical
science, could not retain.
It is folly the folly of prejudice and preconceived criticism to deny, against the testimony of all antiquity, that the Chaldeans and Egyptians, especially the former, had great knowledge of astronomy. I need not cite the familiar passages in Greek and Roman literature which show this ; but it may be said with confidence that, if there had been at Athens a great observatory similar to that in the temple of Belus at Babylon, associated in the same way with reports of eminent attainments in astronomy, our in
quiries concerning it would not be regulated by doubt and
incredulity. On the contrary, if we now obscure the wiser peoples of antiquity with clouds of incense oifered blindly
to the Greeks, we should, in that case, believe extravagantly, and might lose our wits beyond recovery in the vehemence of our adoration.
We must give attention to one fact that has peculiar
significance. The zodiac, representing the apparent path of the sun in the heavens, with the names and symbolical



118 Pre-Historic Nations.
figures of its signs substantially the same, was common to Chaldea, India, Egypt, and Arabia. Sometimes eleven
signs were counted, the claws of the scorpion representing the sign known as Libra. Sextus Empiricus and others stated that the zodiac, as we have it, came directly from the Chaldeans. The great similarity of the zodiacs used in Egypt, India, and the countries of Western Asia shows that they must have had a common origin, and to find their origin we must go to the older people who gave all these
countries civilization, and prepared them to become grea^t nations.
The science of astronomy prevalent in Chaldea, Egypt, and other old nations, so generally, although imperfectly noticed by Greeks and Romans, and of which so many fragments have come down to us, must have been originated by the ancient Arabians in the earlier periods of their civ
ilization. The starry heavens naturally engage attention
even among barbarians, and a systematic study of the stars has so many practical uses that astronomy must have
one of the earliest sciences. Add to this tin- peculiar genius of the old Arabian race and their favorable atmos
phere, with the fact that they were pre-eminently planet worshippers, who, from the earliest times, had been largely devoted to maritime enterprise, and we cannot reasonably fail to see that they must have originated the science of astronomy, and carried it into all the communities that
grew up under their influence. The zodiacs so closely re
sembling each other, found in different countries, whose origin must be traced to Arabian or Cushitc influence, must have come originally from Arabia.
The Egyptians regarded Taut, or Tlioth, as the originator of astronomy ; the Phoenicians and other Cushitc peoples



Ethiopians Invented Astronomy. 119
traced letters and science to Taut. In the work on As
trology attributed to Lucian, the author says :
" It is com
monly understood that the Ethiopians were the first who invented astronomy, being led to this science by their cloud
less sky and favorable climate, and by their surpassing in
tellectual sagacity, subtilty, and force." I have shown what country the ancient Greeks described as Ethiopia. The Greeks indicated not only the great antiquity of the
sphere, but also the people by whom it was invented, by connecting its origin with Atlas and Hercules. There was astronomy in Arabia when the book of Job was written, but the great ages of Cushite civilization closed at a period which at that time was very ancient. The Arabians were eminent for their knowledge of astronomy and mathematics while any influence of the old culture remained ; but in the later times, the old books had
perished not only in Arabia, but also in Egypt and Chaldea. The astronomy of the Arabians, after the time of
Mahomet, was not the system learned by Pythagoras and his followers of the Chaldeans and Egyptians. It was that
of Ptolemy. They brought it to Europe, and they brought with it something better, namely, mathematical science,
giving Europe even the nine digits, or " Arabic figures," with algebra, of which the old Greeks knew nothing. The
word Al-manac, like the word Al-gebra, is Arabic. It is easy to deny an ancient civilization when its records have perished and its remains have become scanty, and demand something as conclusive as mathematical demonstration, but it is not reasonable to do so. The astronomical science of the Chinese is generally admitted ; but, if China were now as far back in the past as Chaldea, with no more
record or remains of its civilization left to enlighten UP,

stupid skepticism, feeling very wise, would deny everything. Its denials, however, could neither destroy the fact nor lessen the significance of such traces of it as might remain for study. Inquiry tends more and more to show that we must give up the vain assumption that not much was known previous to the rise of Greece, and not much at any tune out
of Greece, until Western Europe became enlightened. There was much more in the past than we have been accustomed to admit ; but this is seen only when the aim of our inquiry
is to discover, and not merely to deny. The nautical science of the old Arabians must have IHVII
equal to tin- wants of their great commercial enterprise ; for
tin- faculty to invent what was necessary did not wait until our time to make its first appearance in the human mind. It is seen that the Phoenicians, when they came out of the
obscure pre-historic ages into history, were immeasurably
superior to every other people in maritime skill. No other people had such naval constructions ; 110 other people were
so much at sea, or made such long voyages, or had such skill
in navigation. Some ages later, the Athenians had ships ; but they had nothing like the great Phoenician ships that
came regularly to Athens in the service of commerce, and were always regarded there as marvels of naval architecture. What the Phoenicians were on the Mediterranean, the Southern Arabians were on the Indian Ocean, although
history, necessarily, has much less to say of them ; and these
peoples representing in the later ages of its decline the great race that had been, for not less than six millenniums probably, foremost in human affairs, give us some notion of what must have been the attainments of that race in the ages of
its highest development and power. The marvelous skill of the Phoenicians in manufactures would have been impos

sible without unusual intellectual activity, aided by great attainments in- science. Is it reasonable to believe that the
nautical science of such a people, with whom maritime en
terprise was a chief business, could have been poor and
mean ? Such a belief is possible only to the prodigious in
credulity of egotistical skepticism. It has been usual to assume that nautical science never
existed anywhere much previous to the beginning of the fourteenth century, and that such things as the mariner's
compass, the astrolabe, and other scientific instruments to
aid navigation, were not heard of previous to that age. The mariner's compass, it has been said, was invented by Flavio
Gioja, at Pasitava, near Amalfi, in Italy, in the year 1302. Unfortunately for the prestige of orthodox wisdom, it has been shown that the manner's compass was in use long
previous to this date. Raymond Lully, in his " Fenix de
las Maravillas del Orbe," published in 1286, states that the
seamen of his time used " instruments of measurement, seacharts, and the magnetic needle Tenian los mareantes in
strumento, carta, compas y aguja" A Latin letter or essay of Peter Adsiger, dated in 1269, and cited in Rees's Cyclopaedia, speaks of the mariner's compass as if it had been in
use for a long time, gives a very particular description of it, and says :
" Take notice that the magnet, as well as the needle that has been touched by it, does not point exactly
to the poles ; the south point declines a little to the west,
and the north point to the east." In the year 1180, the mariner's compass was very fully described in a poem of
one of the Proven9al Troubadours, named Guyot de Provins.
He described the magnet, the method of preparing the nee
dle, and the certainty with which it points to the polar star? qid ne se inuc.t. He stated that the needle, fixed to

bits of straw, was made to swim on water in a dish. Then it turned steadily to the pole and could not lie, but was a sure guide to the mariner in the darkest night.
"Puis se tourne la pointe toute Centre 1'estoile, si sans doute Que j'a mis horn n'en doutera Ne ja por rien ne faussera."
Guyot de Provins was at the court of Frederick Barba
rossa, at Mentz, in the year 1181. The date and authenticity of his poem are both undoubted. To him the mariner's compass was one of the common things which had been in use for a long time, and might have existed from time immemorial. Some have supposed that Marco Polo brought
tlie magnetic needle from China in 1295, and taught Flavio
Gioja how to produce the mariner's compass; but Guyot de Provins wrote that poem long before Marco Polo was bom. It is known that the early Venetians used the com
pass, making the needle swim on water by fixing it to 11
piece of cork. Plautus, in his Mercatore, act v., scene 2, has the following: Hue secundus vcntus est^cape modo vorsoriam. The word vorsoriam has been interpreted to mean the mariner's compass, although some critics have tried to
see in it a rope, or the helm of a ship. Pineda and Father
Kircher argued earnestly to show that the compass was used by the Phoenicians and Hebrews in the time of Solomon, which was much more reasonable than the claim that
it was first invented in Europe. It is found necessary to admit, and therefore Humboldt
(Cosmos, chapter on the Period of Oceanic Discoveries) states as a fact, that the mariner's compass was brought to Europe by the Arabians. He says :
" The Arabic desig

Vincenzius of Beauvais, in his ' Mirror of Nature,' to the
two points of the magnetic needle, indicate, like many Arabic names of stars which we still use, the channel and the people from whom the Western countries received their knowledge." Humboldt suggests that the Arabians may have received the compass from the Chinese, who appear to have used the magnetic needle in the time of Hoang-ti, more than 2700 years previous to the Christian Era. Could we
have a complete history of Arabia previous to that date, it might appear that the Chinese themselves received it from the Arabian Cushites. Be this as it may, we cannot
reasonably suppose that such a people as the ancient Ara
bians, endowed with remarkable aptitude for making sci
ence practical, constantly engaged in navigation, and 'perpetually incited to contrive nautical instruments and improve nautical science, were less likely to invent the mari
ner's compass than the Chinese. To believe this requires
greater credulity than reason can tolerate.
Flavio Gioja represents the age when nautical instru
ments first came into general use among the present peoples of Western Europe, but he does not represent the age
when they were first invented. The people we call Moors, Saracens, and Arabians inherited the remains of the old
Cushite civilization. They had the mariner's compass, but
they did not claim to have invented it. They had " al
ways" used the compass, and we must suppose (for no other supposition is probable) that it had come down to them from the Phoenicians. When Yasques di Gama went to India round the Cape of Good Hope, he found the mariner's
compass, the astrolabe, and other important nautical instruments in general use among the Southern Arabians, who controlled maritime enterprise on the Indian Seas. Bar

low, in his "Navigator's Supply," published in 1597, state* that he had ascertained by personal inquiry and observa
tion that " instead of our compass they used a magnetic
needle about six inches long, suspended on a pin, in a white China dish filled with water, in the bottom of which were two cross lines marking the cardinal points." This method
of using the needle is the same as that employed by the Arabian race on the Mediterranean. It indicates that they all had the compass from the same source.
We have some very plain indications of the cxisun
the mariner's compass among the Phu>nicians. The 111:11;
lu-t was described as " the stone of Hercules ;" and we have
very significant accounts of "the cup of Hercules," which reminds us of the cup in which the later Arabians iloated
the needle. Hercules, it is said, departed on hi< great maritime expedition to the West with a cup which lie had received from Apollo. The cup is associated with Hercules
not only in the myths, but also in sculptured and other
representations, which show him with a cup in his hand. -Nothing could have been more natural to the Phoenician mariners than to associate the magnetic needle with the
gods, and regard it as a divine oracle. When not in u>e,
the place of the compass would be in a temple, apart from
familiar approaches. The Bajtylia, or " stones having life," which, we are told in Sanchoniathon, were made by Otiranos, are supposed to indicate ancient experiments with the
magnet. Knowledge of the properties of the magnet existed in
very remote times. We find traces of it everywhere. It appears in the old Sanskrit myths. Wilford says: In the
{ 'hatur-vctrga-chint&ndni) it is said that when the daitayas, being defeated, fled before the gods and found no shelter,



The Cushites invented the Compass. 125
Sucrdchdryya created an immense magnet, like a mount
ain, by which the iron-tipped arrows of the gods were attracted ; whereupon Indra struck the mountain-like mag
net with his thunder, shivering it into numberless splinters, which fell upon the land and into the sea, existing thereaf
ter as magnetic rocks.
The credulous skepticism that believes the old Arabians,
with their practical spirit, their penetrating intellect, and their nautical wants, could have the magnet and under
stand its properties without producing the magnetic needle, greatly needs the wholesome discipline of reason. It is certain that the mariner's compass was not originated in Europe, nor among the later Arabians from whom we re
ceived it. Where did it originate ? How shall we reason
ably explain its origin if we refuse to believe it was in
vented by the greatest maritime people of antiquity the great people who monopolized maritime enterprise for so many centuries, not to say millenniums, and who created the ancient civilizations? Its history, so far as we can
trace it, leads us directly to this explanation ; no other is
so obvious, so probable, or so necessary to a just compre
hension of antiquity itself.
But, it is said, " If the Phoenicians and their predecessors had the mariner's compass, why did not the Greeks and
Romans make a full record of this fact ? and how did it
happen that all knowledge of the compass was lost ?" Knowledge of the compass was not lost by those who used it. Perhaps the Greeks and Romans knew more of it in a general way than they have told us ; and if they did not
know enough of the compass to explain it, or if, knowing something of it, they regarded it merely as a thaumaturgical instrument of no practical importance, they would

not be likely to make it a topic in their writings. The Greeks must have known much concerning the history, manufactures, enterprises, and nautical science of the Phoe
nicians which they did not write down in their books.
They did say something. Strabo, referring to the opportunities afforded by the cities of Phoenicia for studying ge
ometry, astronomy, and other sciences, says : " The Sidonians are said by historians to excel in various arts, and they
cultivate science, and study astronomy, arithmetic, and night saUiny, each of which concerns the merchant and the
seaman." Night sailing ! What does that mean ? It wa< a,
science peculiar to the Phoenicians. We hear of it nowhere
else. Strabo himself, probably, could not have explained it. It should be remembered that, among the enlightened peoples of antiquity, the methods of communication were dill'erent from ours. The current knowledge of their time
was not published every morning in newspapers. The progress of science was not regularly announced to the public either in monthly bulletins or annual reports; and, what is more, the higher studies in science and philosophy were not conducted openly before the public so much as in
secret societies. Pythagoras found it necessary to undergo a very severe ordeal of initiation before he could be al
lowed to pursue his studies in Egypt. In the matter of
learning and its mysteries, exclusiveness and secretive-ness were much more common among the ancient peoples than
publicity and frank communication. No ancient people hastened to communicate to all others its wisdom in the
arts and sciences ; on the contrary, the rule was to conceal and hold it as the exclusive possession of those to whom
it belonged; and, to a great extent, the highest and boldest developments of science and philosophy were carefully shut up in secret societies.



Secrecy of Phoenician Commerce. 127
It is well known that the Phoenicians, as far as possible, drew the curtain of secrecy over the whole business of their commerce; and we see in the statements of Herodotus that the Southern Arabians pursued the same policy. Can it be supposed, or even imagined, that these wonderful navi
gators and traders, having the mariner's compass, would go into all the public places of the known world, and there an
nounce it, explain it, and, giving it to all other peoples, invite them to become their commercial rivals? JSTo; they would have hidden it from observation with the most jeaL ous care. Nothing else connected with their business
would have been kept in profounder secrecy. A means of
maritime supremacy so sure, and to other peoples so mysterious, would have been withdrawn from the scrutiny of Greek and Roman curiosity as carefully as the most sacred
things of their religion were secured against the blaspheming impertinence of its enemies. The people who braved shipwreck to hide the Cassiterides from the Romans were
not likely to make it possible for Greeks and Romans to understand and describe their greatest treasure, the mari
ner's compass. Therefore, when the mariner's compass has
been fairly traced to the Pho3nicians, it is preposterous to object, seriously, that the Greeks and Romans have given us no account of it. A good old lady living in one of the most secluded valleys of the Green Mountains was visited one day by a
little company of romantic' pleasure-seekers. She asked them where they lived when at home ; and on being told that their homes were in Boston, she exclaimed with raised
hands, "How can anybody be willing to live so far off!"
It is to be feared that some persons contemplate antiquity with intelligence very similar to that of this most excel



128 Pre-Historic Nations.
lent old lady. They find it difficult, if not impossible, to believe there could have been anything worthy of atten
tion in ages " so far off." They are sure that nothing of
much importance could have existed previous to our time.
This style of intelligence is always preposterous ; but it reaches the superlative degree when allowed to guide the
judgment of scholarly gentlemen whose chief aim is to es
tablish a reputation for " critical discrimination."



IV.
THE PHCENICIANS.
HEEREX, pursuing his inquiries concerning the nations
of antiquity, was constrained to say, " The severest loss
Ancient History has to mourn a loss irreparable is the destruction of those records that would inform us of the
affairs, the government, and the enterprises of the Phoenicians." Heeren's "Researches" have great value. His eth
nic assumptions are not always correct, and his conception of antiquity was not sufficiently extensive to take in the whole career of the old Cushite race, to which the Phoeni
cians belonged; but he wrote more than fifty years ago, without aid from the later discoveries. The lost records of this whole race would indeed shed a great light on the
past ; nevertheless, it will be readily admitted that a com
plete history of the people known as Phoenicians, or even a complete record of Sidon or Tyre, giving a history of its maritime operations from the beginning, its manufactures, its commerce, its colonies, and its commercial and political relations with the rest of the world, would be an invaluable
acquisition. The term Phoenicia is of Greek origin. The Greeks ap
plied it to a small district on the Mediterranean, which appears to have been the only Asiatic territory controlled by the people called Phoenicians after the date of the first
Olympiad. This was only a fragment of their more an
cient dominion, and they themselves were only a fragment
F2



130 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
of the still more ancient empire of the Arabian Cushites. The term Phoenicia did not come into use until long after the Phoenician dominion in Asia Minor, on the Black Sea, and on the islands and coasts of the JEgean and Eastern
Mediterranean was broken. We call certain people Moors who never knew themselves by the name we give them. So did the Greeks and Romans describe a certain people
of antiquity as Phoenicians. We can not have a regular history of this people ; but we know that the early Greeks called them Ethiopians. Notices of them are found in Greek literature ; tradition gives some account of them ;
traces of their character and civilization are found in the
many regions where they had colonies or commercial es
tablishments ; and there is something for study in the un
explained yet unavoidable impression of their greatness felt by every student of ancient history.
ORIGIN OP THE PHOENICIANS.
Herodotus, beginning his record of historical events
among the " Greeks and barbarians," states, on the author
ity of " the learned among the Persians," that " the Phoenicians migrated from the shores of the Erythnran Sea to the Mediterranean." The Greek writers frequently mention
ancient historical works, relating to Western Asia, that
would tell much we desire to know. Strabo mentions " an
cient histories of Persia, Media, and Syria ;" and we know
from statements in Oriental books that there were " ancient
histories of Iran." It is probable that Herodotus had some knowledge of such works. He states that the Phoenicians
themselves had the same tradition concerning their origin.
Tn book vii., ch. Ixxxix., he repeats his first statement thus :
" The Phoenicians, as they themselves say, anciently dwelt



What the Immigration means. 131
on the Erythraean Sea; and, having crossed over from thence, they settled on the sea-coast of Syria." Eratosthenes found the same tradition in certain islands of the Persian
Gulf, named Aradus and Tyrus or Tylus, supposed to be the same as the Bahreyn Islands of modern times, one of which is still called AracL These islands are on the coast of Arabia, in a bay that extends from the Persian Gulf. It will appear that the people called Phoenicians were a branch of the great Cushite race, and that the country
they occupied was originally a part of that empire of Cusha-dwipa which extended from the Erythraean Sea to the Mediterranean. At that very remote period, when the first Cushite settlements were established on the Mediter
ranean, there was undoubtedly a great movement of the Arabian Cushites in that direction from all parts of the
peninsula, and especially from the commercial districts on the southern and eastern coasts ; and probably there were
other migrations, at subsequent periods, whenever a new
city was founded, or some new commercial opportunity stimulated enterprise to seek that coast. The tradition re
ported by Eratosthenes appears to signify, at least, that, when Tyre was founded, its builders from Sidon were joined by immigrants from the Bahreyn Islands and the Arabian coast with which they are so closely connected. Political
considerations may have done something to incite this migration, for the unity of the ancient Cushite dominion must
have disappeared before Tyre was built, and the independent nationality of the Phoenicians must then have reached that great condition of prosperity which it maintained for
centuries afterwards.
Linguistic and archaeological research have made two points very clear : first, that the oldest traces of a civilized



132 Pre-Historic Nations.
people found in Asia Minor, especially in the coast regions, are those of the Cushites, or Ethiopians ; and, second, that there was a very close relationship between the Phoenicians and the ancient people of Southern Arabia, or, to translate
the words of a distinguished French explorer and philolo
gist [Ernest Renan] : " It must be admitted that singular relations exist between the ethnographic, historic, and linguistic position of Yemen and that of Phoenicia." These points are now so generally admitted by those familiar with the evidence on which they rest, that an elaborate discussion of this evidence is not required.
Mr. Rawlinson, in his essay " On the Ethnic Affinities of the Nations of Western Asia," states the admitted re Milt of investigation to be that Karaites or Cushites preceded
Semitic and Aryan civilization throughout that whole re
gion ; and he names " Arabia, Babylonia, Susiana, Philistia,
Sidon, Tyre, and the country of the Hittites" as points where their traces are especially noticeable. His essay is by no means all that can be desired on this subject, while
his Turanizing speculation cannot be very satisfactory to himself. Any theory that classes the languages of the
Egyptians, Himyarite Arabians, early Chaldeans, and early Canaanites as "Turanian languages," should not expect
much success. Nevertheless, he says: "The primeval Ca
naanites, indeed, were of the race of Ham (/.<?., they were
Cushites), and no doubt originally spoke a dialect closely akin to the Egyptian." In another place he points out
that Hamites, or Ethiopians, " were the 'original founders of most of the towns" occupied by the Phoenicians, includ
ing even Sidon itself, and starts these questions : " Are we to identify the Phoenicians with the Canaanites, and understand a Hamitic migration from Chaldea or Susiana in



Rawlinsorfs Speculations. 133
times long anterior to Abraham ? or are we to distinguish between the two races, and to regard Herodotus as describ
ing a long subsequent immigration of Semites into these parts a settlement of Phoenicians, as we know them in
history, among the Canaanites, a people of quite a different character ?"
This is creating difficulty where none exists, and where none can be felt save by those who are predetermined to class the Phoenicians as Semites, and whose untenable chro
nology forbids a just comprehension of the past. The Phoe
nicians, " as we know them in history" written under these influences, are very poorly understood. Should Mr. Raw
linson study the case with entire freedom of mind, he could not allow himself to doubt that Herodotus meant a Cushite immigration " in times long anterior to Abraham" not
" from Chaldea or Susiana," which is pure invention, but
" from the shores of the Erythra3an Sea, from Southern Arabia." It may also be suggested that the Phoenicians meant
by Herodotus, according to his own statement, founded Tyre about 2760 years before the Christian Era, and car
ried letters and civilization to Hellas (or to the country that afterwards became Hellas) long previous to the date
fixed for this imagined " immigration of Semites into those
parts," to become the Phoenicians.
We have seen, in another place, that the whole Asiatic
region on the Mediterranean was anciently a part of Ethi
opia, or the Land of Gush, and that Joppa (lopia), one of the most ancient Phoenician cities, was the royal city of
" Kepheus the Ethiopian." Among the notes to Hamilton and Falconer's version of Strabo are the following :
" We
have before remarked that the Ethiopia visited by Mene
laus was not the country above Egypt, but an Ethiopia ly



134 Pre-Historic
ing around Jaffa, the ancient Joppa." Again :
" The name
of Ethiopians, given by Ephorus to fugitive Canaanites, confirms what we have before stated, that the environs of
Jaffa, and possibly the entire of Palestine, anciently bore the name of Ethiopia." The most ancient Greeks, in their
writings and traditions, knew nothing of that name, Phoenicians, but they did know and use such names as Ethio
pians, Sidonians, and Aradians. Ethiopia was the term most commonly applied to the country afterwards called
Phoenicia; and this term, as an appellation to describe smiie of the communities and districts that were under Pha-nician control, did not pass out of use until after the
beginning of the Christian Era.
Jerome, in his catalogue of ecclesiastical writers, meiv
tions that St. Andrew preached the Gospel in towns on the
two Colchic rivers, Asparus and Phasis, and calls the peo
ple Ethiopians: "Ubi est irruptio Aspari et Phasis illic
incolnnt ^Ethiopes interiores." He says the same of Mat
thias: "In altera ^Ethiopia, ubi est irruptio Apsari et Ilysi portus, pnxnlicavit." This ancient name, lingering still in later times, is sufficient to determine the ethnic character of the Phoenicians. They were Arabian Cushites the Ethiopians of Greek antiquity who came to the Mediterranean and established that "multitude of flourishing com
mercial cities," which, as Heeren Bays, " adorned the countries of Phoenicia and Asia Minor, and formed an almost unbroken line from the Straits of Byzantium to the confines of Egypt." In most of their communities there seems to have been a remarkable mixture of races, but there is no reason to doubt that their dominion over this whole region was maintained for a long time after the decline of the
great Cushite empire in Western Asia, the "great Sidon"'



Concerning "that remote Period" 135
being, at an early time, their metropolitan city, preceded, however, in ages still earlier, by Martu or Marathus. It
finally gave way, and their Asiatic territory gradually shrunk to the small district in which authentic history found them.
THE IMMIGRATION DOUBTED.
Some writers, in discussing what Herodotus says of the Phoenicians, have discredited such an immigration as im
probable in the highest degree, if not impossible. They
have said, " The great difficulties of such a migration from
the Erythraean Sea to the Mediterranean, at that remote
period, made it utterly impracticable." Those who have
used, in this connection, the phrase " at that remote period," have deemed it very powerful and conclusive. They
have assumed, and supposed everybody else would admit as a matter of course, that all men were ignorant barbari
ans " at that remote period," destitute of the arts of civil
ized life. " That remote period," they are quite sure, was
not far from the dreary " Stone Age" in the unwritten history of Western Asia, when the noblest naval structure was a loose raft of logs, and hunting and fishing with the rudest stone and bone implements the most serious under
takings of the people. The confident critics who raised this objection have
seemed deliciously unconscious of its absurdity. They are not as numerous now as formerly ; but those who believe
there never was any civilization worth taking much account of previous to the time of the Greeks are liable to
such magnificent flights in the dark. That brilliant skep
tic, Voltaire, writing on this subject with more wit than
wisdom, supposed the migration must necessarily have



Pre-Historic Nations.
been impossible without a sea voyage around Africa ; and he ridiculed this supposed sea voyage with immense satis
faction to himself, therein making plain that brilliant wit
is not sure to save a man from stupidity.
Movers, in his elaborate work on the Phoenicians, urges
two arguments against the migration described by Herodotus. In the first place, he is sure it cannot have taken place because it is not mentioned in the Bible a style of argument not well considered. The Bible does not de
scribe the building of Pctrii ; it does not relate the history of Balbec ; it does not toll us when Sidon was founded ;
it fails to explain either the origin or the ethnic chunu-u r
of the Philistines. Moreover, the first settlements of the Ethiopians on the Mediterranean were made many centuries before the time of Abraham, and were no more likely to be discussed by Moses or his successors than any other
event of general history far away in the past. In the sec
ond place, Movers urges that, according to Sanchoniathon, the Phoenicians we- re the original people of the region where
they dwelt, and the human race itself appeared first in their
country. But the authorities tell us that "it is now
erally agreed among scholars that the work attributed to SaiR-honiathon was a forgery of Philo Byblius." It is very
true that what "is generally agreed among scholars" in such cases like some of the judgments in which church
men, or medical scientists, or representative men of other
professions are, from time to time, both agreed and disagreed are not infallible. The work may be a forgery; but is it not quite as probable that an ancient Phoenician should have written such a work, as that an eminent schol
ar of Philo' s time should have forged it? The general
judgment of scholars, however, should have due weight ;



Movers on the Phoenicians. 137
therefore Sanchoniathon cannot be safely used to prove
anything, although many scholars, entitled to great respect, have believed the work authentic. At the same time, should the work in question be gener
ally accepted and used in these investigations as a genuine production of an old Phoenician writer, it would not sustain the argument of Movers. The immgrants who built the old Phoenician cities did not go out of their own coun
try ; they did nothing more than extend its borders and its population to the Mediterranean Sea. Their country
was Ethiopia or Cusha-dwipa, and the new settlements were as essentially a part of it as the older communities on the Erythraan Sea. The Cushites who settled on the Mediterranean might justly claim that their ancestors were
part of the original people of the ancient Ethiopia, without meaning that they were the original occupants of that particular portion of it. The argument of Movers had some force in his own mind, because he assumed that the little district called Phoenicia was all the country ever known or
claimed in any age by the ancient people known in history as Phoenicians.
KENAN'S THEOKY.
Ernest Renan, in his work on the Semitic Languages
(bk. ii., ch. ii.), after showing that, in the time of the Hebrews, the Phoenicians called the district then occupied by them Chna or Cna* and that the Hebrews designated the
whole Phoenician people as Canaanites, making them a dif
ferent race from the Semites, speculates on the subject as follows :
* Stephanus of Byzantium, and also Hecateus, states that the country was called Chna.



138 Pre-IIistonc
"As the Phoenicians spoke a Semitic language, the phi
lologist is invincibly borne to the conclusion that they were themselves Semites. The historian, however, sees
grave difficulties in the way of this conclusion, and is in
suspense in regard to the real origin of this people, who played a part so important in the history of civilization. From the first the Hebrews obstinately spurned all fraternity with Canaan, and connected him with the family of
Ham. For a moment criticism is tempted to be of their
opinion. We said at the beginning, the peculiar characteristic of the Semites is to have neither industrial enter
prise, political spirit, nor municipal organization; i:;. tion and colonization seem repugnant to them ; their action has remained purely Oriental, and has entered the current
of European affairs indirectly only, and by repercuHere (among the Phoenicians), on the contrary, we find an industrial civilization, political revolutions, the most active commerce known- to antiquity, and a nation incessantly
spreading abroad its influence, and mixing itself with the whole life of the Mediterranean world." Communities have sometimes changed their langu
but for one race to borrow, at will, the essential peculiari
ties of another race, is impossible. With his belief in profound and ineradicable distinctions between races a belief which in him is emphatic and sometimes extreme he might have seen that the civilization of the Phoenicians made it
impossible to class them with the Semitic family ; and also
that it, at any comparatively modern period of their history, they were found using a Semitic dialect, it was because
unexplained influences had enabled that dialect to super
cede their original tongue. Xo hypothesis should have been permitted to set aside a fact so plain as the manifest



Eenan's Ur of the Chaldees. 130
distinction of race. But with him, as with some others, it was a foregone conclusion that the Phoenicians were Semites, and he saw nothing to do but to remove the difficul
ties as cleverly as possible. The emphatic testimony of the Hebrew Scriptures that the Phoenicians or Canaanites did
not belong to the Semitic race he treats as follows :
" The affinity established by the Hebrews between Ham
and Canaan seems at least to signify that, in their view, the Canaanites came from the south. Perhaps the part taken by the Hebrews to make Canaan an accursed race
influenced their ethnography, and led them, notwithstand
ing the evident similarity of language, to withdraw the Phoenicians from the elect race of Shem, and place them in
the infidel family of Ham."
To solve the problem without yielding his assumption, he resorts to the mountains of Kurdistan, where he finds Ur of the Chaldees (as will be -shown in the chapter on the Chaldeans) and his Aryan Chaldeans (les Kasdes ou Chal
deens primitifs, que tout porte a rattacher a la race ari
enne). These mountains now become " the common cradle of the Semitic race," from which the Phoenicians went forth first into the great world and traveled to Babylonia, where
they remained an indefinite number of ages, long enough to become civilized and undergo a profound change of character. These Semites from Kurdistan were transform
ed into a kind of" Semitico-Cushites," and " became to their
unchanged pastoral brethren objects of execration." They left Babylonia and settled in Canaan about 2000 years
B.C., he thinks long before his chronology finds Abraham there, and five centuries before the Israelites entered the
land from Egypt ; and yet, during all this time, and through all these changes, these two closelv related Semitic families



140 Pre-Historic Nations.
preserved, unchanged and inviolate, the language, common to both, which they brought from the Kurdish mountains.
The similarity of language remained, for the Hebrews were
still Hebrews of the old style in this respect, and, " more faithful to their language than to their faith and their man
ners, the Phoenicians were still Semites in speech." It is
due to Renan to say he did not originate this hypothesis ; he borrowed it from M. Guigniaut, who gave it to the
world in his " Religions de 1'Antiquite." Its improbability, from beginning to end, is so great and so palpable, that a formal attempt to refute it would be as absurd as the hy
pothesis itself. It is nowise likely that Abraham ever spoke Hebrew, a
language that seems to feave been developed after his time,
probably by some Semitic community in Syria that may have become, for a time, sufficiently powerful to control the whole region known as Canaan and Palestine. His family
belonged to the nomadic Semites of Mesopotamia; and it
is not improbable to suppose he spoke a Semitic dialect
that was exchanged for Hebrew, in Palestine, by his descendants perhaps by the family of Jacob, perhaps at a later period. It maybe affirmed with confidence that He
brew was not the original language of the people called
Phoenicians ; they were Cushites in race, language, and civilization; and if, in the later ages of their existence as a
people, they did actually speak Hebrew (which is not quite
so clear as some have assumed), the Kurdish mountains
can furnish nothing to explain the fact. Such linguistic changes are possible ; history shows us how to understand
them ; and the ethnologist who does not take proper account of them is liable to go astray.



Cushite Religion and Architecture. 141
THEIR CUSHITE RELIGION AND ARCHITECTURE.
If the Cushite or Ethiopian origin of the Phoenicians
were not so distinctly apparent in the records of antiquity, in their civilization, and in the other evidence of the Cush
ite character of the first civilizers of the region they occu
pied, it would still be convincingly manifest in their religion, and in the architectural remains of their ancient cities. The Hebrew Scriptures show us their religion, and enable us to see its identity with that of all other peoples of the
'same race. They worshipped "the host of heaven," the
planets, as representatives of the Supreme Being ; and among these, Baal and Astarte, or Ashteroth, represented
the generative and productive powers of nature. It was the Cushite system found not only in Phoenicia and Arabia,
but also in Egypt, Chaldea, India, and wherever the influence of this race was established in ancient times. It is
brought to light in the old Phoenician ruins. Ernest Renan, who directed an exploration of the ruins of that very ancient Phoenician city which the Greeks called Marathos, and described the results in his "Mission de Phcenicie,"
says on this point :
" The Egyptian aspect of these monuments should not surprise us. More and more, in the course
of this work, we shall see Phoenicia, in a religious point of
view, become a province of Egypt." He might have said,
more correctly, that, in a religious point of view, Egypt and Phoenicia were both provinces of their mother country, the
ancient Ethiopia or Cusha-dwipa. The Cushite origin of the Phoenicians is shown no less
distinctly by the architectural remains of their oldest cities.
In every country and on every shore, where the old Cushite settlements are traced ? are found the remains of vast



142 Pro-Historic Nations.
constructions that astonish and perplex beholders. They
are found in Egpyt, Nubia, Arabia, India, Greece, Italy, Great Britain, and Phoenicia. In Chaldea, where there was
no stone, there were immense structures of brick. The stone-work shown by some of these constructions is amazing, and nowhere more so than in Syria and Phoenicia. Since Maundrell published the record of his travels and
observations, we have been familiar with this peculiarity in the ruins of Balbec. One particular in the description
of these ruins is that, at one place in a remaining wall, twenty feet above the ground, three vast blocks of stone,' twelve fret deep and twelve feet wide, and each more than
sixty feet long, are seen lying end to end. The hand of old Cushite architects is seen in the wondrous rock con
structions of Petra, and it is visible in the ruins of ancient
Phoenician cities that have been explored.
For instance, at Ruud, tin- Ar\ ad of Genesis, known in remote Cushite times as Arad, the French explorers found the ancient wall that encircled the island city. It was constructed of immense blocks of stone, nearly eleven feet
square and fifteen or sixteen long. The beautiful antique
reservoirs, hewn out of the rock, are still used by the peo
ple of Ruad. The report in the " Mission de Phoenicia" says : "The wall is a work of the old city, without doubt, and a work truly Phoenician. Nowhere more than at Kuad
is one impressed by those gigantic rock-works which constitute a dominant trait of Phcenica and Palestine." Ruad
is an island very near the Syrian coast. On the main land
opposite, and intimately connected with it, were five other
cities Paltus, Balanca, Carne, Enhydra, and Marathos, the "daughters of Arvad" whose ruins exist. Probably
there were others. The French explorers say : " The grand



Chaldean Inscriptions on Martu. 143
totality of what may be called the Arvadite civilization is
represented in our day by a vast mass of ruins, which cover the coast on a continuous line of three or four leagues.
Carne, Antaradus, Enhydra, and Marathos must have nearly touched each other, it being now very difficult to say where one began or another ended. Marathos alone, among
these centres of population, had an individuality distinct
from the insular city." Antaradus, built on the ruins of
an older city, was comparatively modern, not being older
than the Roman period. It was not mentioned by Strabo,
and appears first in the geography of Ptolemy. Marathos was more ancient than Arvad, and seems to
have had a great history of its own before Arvad and " the
daughters of Arvad" appeared, or, at least, before the insular city became important. In the more ancient Chaldean
inscriptions there is frequent mention of a region on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean called Martu. It is usually understood to mean Phoenicia.* Was Martu an ancient Cushite name of the Pho3nician citji called Mara
thos by the Greeks, and now, in its ruins, known as Mrith
or Amrit ? and was this city, older in importance certainly
than Sidon, sufficiently great and powerful, at some period of its history, to give its name to that region ? These questions must be answered in the affirmative.
* A note to George Rawlinson's Essay on the Phoenicians says : " Mar
tu was probably the original form of Marathos, and is the ordinary term in the early Cushite or Hamitic Babylonian for 'the West,' and is espe
cially used of Phoenicia and the Mediterranean. " Sir Henry Eawlinson finds the name in the oldest inscriptions at Ur, in connection with one of
the most primitive kings, and says: "It was applied by the primitive Hamitic Chaldeans to Phoenicia." This makes Phoenicia as old as Chaldea, and effectually disposes of the theory that the Phoenicians were Semite?, and first appeared as a people in the thirteenth century before Christ.



Pre-Historic Nations.
3Irith or Marathos " is the central point of a field of
ruins nearly a league square." In the thirteenth century these ruins were visited by the Dominican Brocard, who used the strongest terms of admiration in speaking of
" those pyramids of surprising grandeur, constructed of
blocks of stone from twenty-six to twenty-eight feet long, whose thickness exceeded the stature of a tall man." Six
hundred years can work great changes even in ruins, but these are still very remarkable. The city was built partly
on a plain and partly on a chain of rocky hills. Some of
the most important monuments of its ancient great m->s are the remains of structures hewn out of these rocks. In Kenan's report on the ruins of Marathos there is some
account of an edifice called " el Maabed," the Temple, which
shows " a vast court, 156 feet wide and about 180 feet long, scooped out of the rock in such a manner as to be level
with the soil of the valley." Wonderful traces of skill in
rock-sculpture appear in the finish and appurtenant this temple. .*' The aspect is Egyptian, with something
original." Another structure, named " Burdj-el-Bezzak,"
now a retreat for brigands, he describes as a mausoleum
of enormous dimensions, and says :
" This is the most con
siderable and best-preserved building of ancient Phoenicia still existing. It was constructed of immense blocks of
stone, and was^formerly crowned with a pyramid, of which
we found nearly all the materials." Another structure, hewn out of the rock, he describes as "an immense stadium, about 738 feet long by about 100 feet wide. Ten rows of seats surrounded the arena, and the stadium terminated
in a circular amphitheatre, from which two parallel passages communicated with the outside, probably to let in the chariots and horses."



The Phoenicians very Ancient. 145
Other remains of rock-sculpture and Cyclopean building were noted at Marathos ; and so it is throughout Phoenicia. The Cushite origin of these cities is so plain, that those most influenced by the strange monomania which .transforms the Phoenicians into Semites now admit that the
Cushites were the first civilizers and builders in Phoenicia.
Those old builders, whose sculpture produced such astonishing effects in coarse rock, resorted to wood and metal for the finish and ornamentation of their work. The stone they used was not Parian marble, therefore they covered
it with ornaments of another material ; and " what remains of their monuments is not the monument itself, but the gross support that served to bear the whole system of decoration under which the stone was concealed."
ANTIQUITY OF THE PIIG3XICIAXS.
The doubts and perplexities that have troubled inquiry
concerning the Phoenicians are due chiefly to the influence
of chronological dogmatism. Investigators have created most of them by assuming that the commonly accepted scheme of Ancient History must not be disturbed. To ex
plain the facts presented for consideration, we must disregard this influence, and be entirely free to admit any conclusion that shall seem necessary. The great antiquity of the people called Phoenicians was acknowledged by the
ancients. Herodotus, evidently, did not suppose it could
be denied. Josephus, while pointing out that " almost all which concerns the Greeks happened not long ago," mentions as a fact generally understood that th*e antiquity of the Phoenicians was as great as that of the Chaldeans and
Egyptians. He says, writing against Apion : The Greeks
acknowledge "that they were the Egyptians, the Chal

deans, and the Phoenicians, who preserved the memorials of the most ancient and most lasting traditions of mankind."
In the tenth chapter of Genesis, the Hebrew belief in the
antiquity of the Canaanites (called Phoenicians) is shown by the statement that Canaan, Cush, Misraim, and Phut were brothers. These names are made to represent the beginnings of the several branches of the Hamite race. This
important chapter, which preserves the earliest ethnol* traditions of the Hebrews, is, in a geographical and ethnical
point of view, of great value. George Rawlinson, while a* signing his imagined Semitic Phoenicians to a comparatively modern period, can not deny that civilized Phoenicia it
self was very ancient. He says, in his Herodotus, vol. iv.,
p. 245 " Hamitic races seem to have been the first to people Western Asia, whether starting from Egypt or from
1 Babylonia it is impossible to determine. These Hamitcs were the original founders of most of the towns, which sometimes retained their primitive names, sometimes ex
changed them for Semitic appellations." This admission, however, really yields the whole question, and overthrows the chronology he desires to save.
The arrival of the Israelites in the land of Canaan, from
Egypt, is usually placed in the fifteenth century before the Christian Era. At that time the Phoenician cities wore very old. Some of them had declined. Arad or Arvad had superseded Martn or Marnthns. Many ages had gone
by since Joppa or lopia was a royal city. The great days of Phoenician dominion in that part of Asia had departed.
It does not appear that any great city was built in Phoeni
cia after this date; some of the old cities may have had new extensions, but no new city was founded. From that



Scheme of Phoenician History. 147
time onward the history of Phoenicia was the history, not
of young vigor and rising greatness, but of development
already mature and of progress towards decline. And yet Mr. Rawlinson makes his Semitic Phoenicians begin their
residence there in the thirteenth century before Christ
two centuries later than the Israelites! To speak very
moderately, and as respectfully as possible, this astonishing hypothesis is unreasonable.
THE PERIODS OF PHOENICIAN HISTORY.
There are some dates and facts which constrain us to believe that the Phoenician settlements and cities, on the east
ern shore of the Mediterranean, were quite as old as Egypt. Herodotus gives us the age of Tyre, one of the latest of
those cities ; and it is clear that cities much more ancient than Sidon were the earlier seats of the commerce and pow
er of that people, such as Joppa or lopia, Berytus or Berut, Byblius or Gebal, and Marathos or Martu. The history of the people called Phoenicians can be divided into four
great periods ;* and the first of these periods, as described
in the "Allgemeine Encyklopadie," may be subdivided into three or more. The elaborate and learned article on
the Phoenicians, published in that great work, arranges Phoenician history as follows : 1. The ante-Sidonian period,
or the time previous to the rise of Sidon to supremacy ; 2.
The period of Sidon ; 3. The period during which Tyre
was the ruling city ; 4. The period of the Assyrian, Babylonia, Egyptian, and Persian invasions, to the final decline of Phoenicia. The first, second, and third of these periods are greatly crowded and confused by the writer's deference

to the popular chronology ; and, in other respects, the article is more valuable for the learning it shows than for clear views and just conclusions ; but the division adopted is ob
vious and useful. In using this natural arrangement of
the history, I shall divide the first period into thive. and
the fourth I shall describe as the Carthaginian period. 1. The ante-Sidonian period. This period begins with the first commercial settlements of the Hamitic or Cushito people on that part of the Mediterranean coast with the time when the Arabian Cushites began to occupy that coast for maritime purposes. That this time was in very remote
antiquity is made manifest by the uniform testimony of lin
guistic and arch^ological investigation, which shows that the Cushites preceded the other races in that part of Asia,
and were the first to establish civilization there. Accord
ing to an old tradition, the first cities built were Gebal or
Gebeil, which the Greeks called Byblus, and Berut, or Berytus as the Greeks made it, now called Beyrut ; but oth
ers may have been older.
The time previous to the supremacy of Sidon must have been divided by events into several distinct historical periods. 1. There was a time when Kepheufl, king of Ethio
pia, reigned at Joppa, and his kingdom is described ; tending from the Mediterranean to the Indian Ocean. Phoe
nicia or Canaan was then an integral part of the great kingdom of the Arabian Cushites ; but we cannot suppose the time of Kepheus to have been during the first ages of the
maritime settlements in that district. 2. There was a time when Berut or Berytus, with its Poseidon and Cabiri wor
ship, was the great city, and the principal starting-point for commercial and colonial enterprise. The earliest colonists may have gone forth from this city. Poseidon-wor

ship seems to have been a peculiarity of all the colonies previous to the time of Sidon. 3. There was a time when
Martu or Marathos was the metropolitan city, and gave its name to the whole region. The ruins of Marathos show it to have been a city of great importance. Diodorus Siculus describes it as a city
celebrated for the religious objects guarded in its sanctuaries. It is mentioned in the older Chaldean inscriptions,
which shows its great antiquity. Like Byblus and Berytus, it had ceased to be a chief city long before the time of Joshua.* It was then secondary to the later island city known as Arad or Arvad, which, however, may have been as old as Sidon. Arad, which inherited the political and commercial importance of Marathos, may have been older
than Sidon, to which it finally became secondary. The Arvadites are prominently mentioned in the tenth chapter of Genesis, and Arvad had evidently been a chief city for a long time when that chapter was written or compiled. 2. The period of Sidon. There is no record to tell us
when this period began. It belongs to the time when the Phoenician cities, with their many colonies on the islands
and shores of the Mediterranean, had become a separate
* There are indications that Marathos was one of the most primeval cities of Phoenicia, and that the Marathos whose ruins now exist was a new city, built near the site of an older Marathos. This new city was already a mass of rains in Strabo's time. The French explorers say its structures were much older than the Greek epoch, and yet they found in them materials taken frcm remains of older structures that had become
ruins before they were built. Throughout the vast walls of the building called Burj-el-Bezzak, blocks of stone were found, evidently taken from the ruins of more ancient structures. Dr. Gaillardot, of the French exploring party, in the "Mission de Phoenicie," discusses the evidence cf this fact at length, and shows it to be conclusive.

and independent dominion. This separation, which was
probably more political than commercial, may have commenced when Martu or Marathos was the great city, and when the ancient Chaldean inscriptions described that whole region as Martu. In Homer, Tyre is not named, but Sidon and the Sidonians are mentioned in such a way as
to make two facts apparent first, that, in ages previous to
his time, " the great Sidon" had been the ruling city ; and, second, that the cities in Asia Minor and around the A^-A\\
Sea had recognised its controlling influence. Kcnrick Bfcyfc very justly: "This exclusive mention of Sidon cannot re-p
resent the actual state of things when the poet wrote, for
in that age Tyre had already assumed the ascendency ; but
it indicates his traditional knowledge of the time when the
power of Phoenicia centred in Sidon, and Tyre was insig
nificant."* Movers, shackled by submissive reverence for the popu
lar chronology, suggests that the supremacy of Sidon may have begun about the year 1500 B.C. At that date it Mas
already in a state of decline. It must have begun more
than a thousand years earlier. We know from the Hebrew
Scriptures that, in the fifteenth century before the Christian
Era, " the great Sidon" was already a very ancient city. Its greatness was mature and old ; its origin was hidden from the Israelites in the mist of remote ages ; and they
spoke of it as one of the earliest cities of the land. The Hebrew writers could not have spoken of Sidon in this
way if at that time its days of great power and influence

sway, but there is nothing to suggest the date of this sepa
ration beyond the fact that, after this period, Phoenician
enterprise and influence went chiefly in other directions, while throughout that region, and on both sides of the
JEgean, grew up an independent political organization of the Pelasgians, old acquaintances of the Phoenicians. This
was foliowed by subsequent organizations of other peoples, of the same race doubtless, until, in the eleventh century before Christ, we may suppose the famed Ionian confeder
acy came into existence.* Sidon, whose importance had
depended largely on its power and commercial sway in this part of the Mediterranean world, very naturally began to decline under the influence of these changes several centu
ries previous to the year 1500 B.C.
3. The period of Tyrian supremacy. Herodotus informs us that Tyre was founded about 2760 years before the Christian Era. He learned at Tyre that the city was found
ed 2300 years previous to the time of his visit there. This
date, taken from the annals of the city, is just as authentic
* Ernst Curtius, in his "Die lonier vor der lonischen Wanderung," shows that the lonians and other Greeks previous to this time dwelt chiefly in Asia Minor. \Vhen Ionia was created, many of those who had passed over into Greece returned to Asia. This is all there is to excuse the absurd representation of Hellenic egotism that the cities of Asia Minor were colonies established by emigration from Hellas, which was politically a
much younger country. In concluding his essay, Curtius says : "In Asien sahen wir die Griechen von der phrygischen Nation sich ablosen als ein besonderes Volk ; in Asien sesshaft, bilden sie aus, was an Sprache und Sitte als der gemeinsame Typus des Heilenischen anerkannt werden muss. Sie gliedern sich in zwei Hauptstamme ; aus dieser Gleiderung wird eine Spaltung ; der eine der Stamme bleibt in Asien und besetzt die ganze Westkiiste, der andere wandert aus durch Thracien und Macedonien."

as any other historical date. It excited in Herodotus neither doubt nor surprise. It implies more past time than
the chronologies of modern times can afford; therefore
some attempts have been made to bring it into discredit, but without any show of good reason, and without success.
When we fairly consider what is known of the history of
Tyre, the date given by Herodotus appears not only K u
sonable, but even moderate. As known to us in history, it consisted of an ancient town on the main land, called P;i
Ije-Tyms, or Old Tyre, and a later city, or extension of the city, built on an island very near the shore, called
Tyre. Herodotus, after careful inquiry, recorded the :i
the old city. Those who would discredit the date hi- irivi-s
put entirely out of view the building of the ancient c;
the main land, and begin the existence of Tyre with the
building of the new city. According to Josephus, the in
sular city, or Xew Tyre (for it was to this ho referred), was
240 years older than Solomon's Temple; that is to bay, it
was built in the thirteenth century before Christ. Two hundred years earlier, when the Israelites settled in Cana
nn, the old city, described by them as "the strong city,
Tyre," had evidently existed for ages. There is nothing
extravagant, nothing improbable, nothing that should be doubted, in the explicit statement of Herodotus that its first foundations were laid about 2TGO B.C.
Tyre was built by a colony from ,Sil>n. When it grew
to be important, its enterprise seems to have been directed chiefly towards the west, and to countries that could bo reached by sailing down the Red Sea. It established relations with Spain, and with the northern and western
coasts of Africa, where the Arabian Cushites estal)li>lu 1

tory on the Mediterranean, probably as early as the time when Byblus and Berut were the chief cities. Those early communities, which in Northwestern Africa and Spain may have been as old as Egypt, grew to be important na
tions, as appears in the myths, became independent, and assumed control of their own commerce. After a long his
tory, indicated by the myths, they must have declined
greatly, for Tyre was able to resume, in those regions, the occupation and influence which the Cushite cities on the
Mediterranean had lost many ages earlier. The Tyrians
secured complete possession of all those countries, and went beyond them to Britain for tin, and to regions near the Baltic for amber.
Without being able to determine precisely when Tyre became the ruling city, we can see that it had reached this
condition previous to the Hebrew times. Its greatest em
inence is apparent in the biblical history of David and Sol
omon. With an admirable degree of enlightened civiliza
tion, with marvelous skill, in manufactures, mining, and commerce, and with a range of traffic that included most of the known world, the Tyrians became a mighty, renown
ed, and magnificent people, such as history found them such as we can see so distinctly through the lurid storm of prophetic denunciation poured forth in the 27th chapter ofEzekiel.
The Tyrians built Carthage on the site of an older town
which had more than once been renewed. A statement of
Philistus the Sicilian, preserved by Eusebius, says it was
founded " by th'e Tyrians, Zorus and Carchedon, fifty years
before the Trojan war." This makes it as old as New Tyre. It is usual to assign a later date, but not with much cer
tainty. It is probable that the sites of both Carthage and
G2

Utica were occupied by the people called Phoenicians at a
very early period, and that the reports of their having been built at various dates, in later times, refer only to subse
quent enlargements of the old towns by which they be

syrians, Egyptians, Babylonians, and, finally, the Persians. which troubled its Asiatic commerce, and at last destroyed its independence. On the commencement of these troub
les, many of its wealthiest and most enterprising citizens
removed to Carthage; and this important migration may have given rise to the common representation that Carthage was built about 813 B.C. After this time the old security and importance of Phoe
nicia disappeared. The country was repeatedly ravaged and subjugated by invading armies of the great powers of inner Asia. The ancient condition of Phoenician greatness,
no longer possible on that coast, was henceforth represent
ed by Carthage, which succeeded Tyre in the supremacy over Northern Africa and Spain, and became one of the
most celebrated cities of its time. The period of its supremacy lasted about 500 years, and was terminated vio
lently by the Romans, who, after a long and malignant warfare, overthrew its power and destroyed the city. Carthage had over 700,000 inhabitants e\en at the time
of its destruction. Its vigor had not declined ; for more
than a thousand years longer it might have played as grand a part in the Mediterranean world as the greatest of its
predecessors, if Rome had not risen to become its rival. But the great career of the Cushite race was finished.

civilization. The time had come when peoples of the Aryan race were to stand foremost in civilization and power,
possess the world, and make its history. They can be great enough to see clearly, and with becoming admiration, what they have inherited from their Cushite predecessors. Ernst Curtius suggests that the order in time of the many Phoenician colonies around the Mediterranean may
be traced in the particular form of religious worship established by the first settlers. The colonies of Sidon carried with them the worship of Astarte, while those of Tyre were distinguished by the worship of Melcarth or Hercules. This guidance is not sure ; but we may add to his suggestion that the ante-Sidonian period can be traced in the colonies by the worship of Poseidon and the Cabiri. Bery
tus, which, according to all tradition, was the earliest metropolitan city, was the chief seat of this worship ; and we find that it was carried to Spain and to Northern Africa,
but most abundantly to Italy, to many of the islands, and to the regions around the ^Egean Sea. In Thrace, Posei
don, and also the Cabiri, were worshipped in the earliest times.
The mysterious Cabiri, called sons of Sydyk the Just, and also sons of Vulcan, were peculiarly Phcenician, or more probably Arabian ; but their worship, as well as that of Poseidon, belonged to the more ancient period of Phoenician
or Cushite civilization, the Cabiri being divinities that pre
sided over navigation, metallurgy, and mining. Traces of the worship of Hercules, nowhere wanting, are most abundant in the western regions on the Mediterranean and beyond the Straits of Gibraltar, where it was established in times far more ancient than either the Tyrian or the Sido
nian period.

THE IJUILDIXG OF GADES.
The city of Gades seems to have been founded by the Tyrians about 1]00 years before the Christian Era, in pursuance of measures they had taken to occupy the country
which had long been politically separated from the Phoe
nician cities, although commercially connected with them. \Vr are told that their aim was to establish themselves in
the most western- region occupied by Hercules. That is to
say, they sought to regain a country which, in the most ancient times, had belonged to the ancestors of their coun
trymen. This reference to Hercules distinctly recognises that early occupation of Spain and Northwestern Africa by the Arabian Cushites, which to the Tyrians themselves must have seemed very ancient. Gades was built near the old city of Erythia, famed in the myths in connection with Hercules and Geryon ; and
north of it, on an island at the mouth of the Tartessus, now the Guadalquiver, was the equally ancient city of Tartessus, which no longer existed in the time of Strabo, for he
says : " They say that on the piece of land inclosed between
the two outlets of this river there formerly stood a city
named, like the river, Tartessus." When Gades was built
Spain had long been an old country, full of old cities, and rich in the monuments of an old civilization, then probably, like the political condition of the country, in a state of de
cline. Before the time of Gades, not only the colonizing enter
prises and other great events signified by the legends concerning the Cushite Melcarth or Hercules, but also many subsequent ages of the Cushite civilization in Spain, had
become mythical. The Temple of Hercules, at Tyre, was

then nearly 1 700 years old when Gades was built, while in the myths of both Phoenicia and Egypt he was much old
er. One of the first edifices built at Gades by the Tyrians
\vas the Temple of Hercules. Before going to the island
on which Gades was founded, they sought a location for
their city on another island, nearer the straits, which, from time immemorial, had been consecrated to Hercules. The whole region was filled with memorials of the ancient
Cushite influence that gave it civilization. We can see all this in the old records and myths of the Greeks; and yet
some writers have blindly assumed that the first colonizing
settlements of the people called Phoenicians, in that part
of Europe, were made by the Tyrians. This denial of the past is due mainly to that besotted influence of dogmatic
chronology which has done so much to obscure antiquity. The more ancient times must be covered with darkness and left unseen, because its scheme of human history cannot afford to recognise them. This chronojogical infatuation is
not respectable ; no deferential forbearance or compliance of eminent scholars can make it so.
Strabo said of Gades, " Its inhabitants equip the greatest
number of ships, and the largest in size, both for our sea and the exterior ocean." The best materials for ship-building appear to have been very abundant in that part of Spain. Gades, and Tartessus at the mouth of Guadalquiv
er, were probably noted for their naval constructions, and especially for the construction of large ships suitable for
use on the great " exterior ocean." If we suppose Tartessus to have been the Tarshish of the Hebrew Scriptures, may
we not find in the great ships for which that locality was famous an explanation of what was meant by the celebrated
" ships of Tarshish ?" Some of the ancients placed the



15S Pre-Historic Nations.
" Pillars of Hercules" near Gades, identifying them with the
" Gates of Gades ;" by others they were placed as far north as the entrance to the Baltic. These mythical pillars were supposed to be columns set up by Hercules to mark the most western point reached by his expedition; and the
Tyrians, it is said, went forth to find them when they sought a location for their new city in the west. El Mas'sudi
speaks of these columns as " the idols of copper."
EXTENT OF PHCENICIAN INFLUENCE.
In presence of the manifold traces of their influence, and
of the uniform testimony of tradition, it could not be denied, with any show of reason, that the Arabian Cushites, called
Phoenicians, were the first civilizers not only in Western
Asia, but in Thrace, in Thessaly and Epirus, in the Grecian Peninsula, in the Mediterranean Islands, throughout Southern Europe, and in Northern Africa. In all these regions
the Phoenicians are #pparent in the oldest architectural re
mains, the earliest culture and modes of writing, and the
methods of political organization. Such antiquities as the Cyclopean structures at Mycenae and Tiryns, and those in
Calabria and Sicily, show at once their origin. Scarcely an
alphabet has been known, during the historical period, that did not arise from that of the Phoenicians. But, if there
were no other evidence, a controlling Phoenician influence, at the beginning of civilization around the Mediterranean, could be inferred from the Phoenician or Arabian method
of political organization everywhere prevalent an organization in which everything else was subordinate to separate
municipalities, completely organized, and more or less con
trolled by popular influence. What -could be more indubitably Phoenician than the political methods of the Ionian

confederacy, of Italy in early times, and of peninsular Greece as known in history ? The Phosnician establishments in Scandinavia, where so many traces of their influence are found, could not have
been later than the early part of the Tyrian period ; and the earliest Cushite-Arabian establishments there must have been much older. The letters and literary culture of the ancient Scandinavians were incontestably Phoenician. It is freely admitted that the Runic letters of the Norsemen, sixteen in number, found in the old inscriptions on the rocks
and stone monuments of Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and the neighboring districts of Germany, and used in Norse
literature, could have no other origin. A circular of the
" Royal Society of Northern Antiquaries," published in the Journal of the Bombay branch of the Royal Asiatic Socie
ty for January 1842, says: "From a remote antiquity commercial relations existed between Asia and the north
of Europe. Abundance of Citfic coins, and other matters, are frequently discovered in excavations, which lead to the inference that such commercial intercourse had no unimportant influence on the north, and also on the countries by
which it was originated." The great article of commerce in Northwestern Europe was amber. The Pho3nicians can be traced far down the western coast
of Africa, where it is well known they had cities and trading
stations. They occupied the Canary Islands, and left there a dialect of the Cushite tongue closely related to the lan
guage of the Berbers, which may indicate that their settlements in these islands were older than the period when the
language of Phrenicia is said to have been Semitized. Traces of their traffic are found on the coast of Guinea. Some suppose that " sika," as the name of gold, was carried



100 Pre-Historic Nation*.
to that coast by the Phoenicians. Be this as it may, the remarkable "Popoe beads," found there in the soil, are evidently remains of their wares. Travelers in Western Africa have frequently called attention to these "bea<K"
which are mysterious to the natives, who prize them be
yond gold, and which no manufacturing skill in Europe can imitate. They are described as "semi-mineral beads of
many kinds." John Duncan, in his "Travels in Western
Africa," vol. i., p. 106, speaks of them thus, in a description of Popoe, and of "the famous market-town of Gregapojee," three and a half miles distant from Popoe: "The Popoe beads are found sometimes in digging the earth in and around the town. They arc generally from half an inch to
an inch in length, and of a tubular form, much resembling a stout pipe-handle broken into small pieces. They are of
a light red coral color. I believe they have been minutely
examined by scientific men in Europe, but the result has
not proved satisfactory." The only reasonable explanation is, that those wonderful
manufacturers, the Phoenicians, had a* trading station at Popoe in remote times, where they trafficked witli the na
tives for gold and ivory. Vr<|uliart, in his "Pillars of Her
cules," describes articles found among Phoenician relics in
Morocco, which, he says, are similar to those dug from the earth at Popoe. It was estimated that the Phoenicians had three hundred towns and cities on the Atlantic coast of Africa ; and Strabo mentions an account of a ship from Gadeira, or Gades, that was wrecked on the eastern coast in older
times. When Necho, king of Egypt, as Herodotus relates, ordered a vessel to sail round Africa and return to Egypt
through the Straits of Gibraltar, he knew such a voyage was possible. Nothing can be more probable than the ex

istencc of a Phoenician trading station on the coast of Guinea. Heeren shows that there was a great overland commerce between the Black Sea and "Great Mongolia" in early
times ; and he mentions that a " Temple of the Sun" and a great caravansary in the desert of Gobi seem to have been connected with this commercial* intercourse. It is not im
probable to suppose this caravan commerce began very early, and that it did something towards creating the north
ern portion of that unbroken line of Phoenician cities " from
the Straits of Byzantium to the confines of Egypt." Prob.
ably the civilized life and activity it infused into " the
tribes of the north" gave political and historical existence
to that people of many races, known to the ancients as
Scythians.

scribes very important ruins near the eastern shore of the
Caspian Sea, at a place called Goim'ishtepe. Connected with them are the remains of a great wall, which he fol

these ruins are like those at Balkh.* Between Gomiishtepe and the Little Balkan he found other important ruins,

vast aqueduct, extending 150 miles to the Persian Alonntains. These are not works of Tartars or Mongols, as we

THE PELASGIANS.
There is evidence to show that at one period very re
mote certainly, more than 2000 years before Christ, we
may suppose a people known as Pelasgi, or IMasuiai Lran an organized dominion which included Asia Elinor, the Grecian Peninsula, and the whole of Northern Greece. The historical traditions of the Greeks relating to this people refer chiefly to the time when the Pelas^iaiis were broken into many separate tribes or communities under various names. But there are references to the older time, previous to the breaking up of their extended dominion known
as Pelasgia, Strabo says (bk. xiii., ch. iii., sect. 3) " that
the Pelasgi were a great nation; history, it is said, furnishes other evidence, for Menecrates of Elea, in his work on the foundation of cities, says the whole of the present
Ionian coast, beginning from Mycale and the neighboring islands, was formerly inhabited by the Pelasgi." Again (bk. v., ch. ii., sect. 4), "Almost every one is agreed that
the Pelasgi were an ancient race, spread throughout the whole of Greece;" and "many have asserted that the nations of the Epirus are Pelasgic because the dominions of
the Pelasgi extended so far." In bk. vii., ch. vil, sect. 10, he
says : "The oracle of Dodona, according to Ephorus, was established by Pelasgi, who are said to be the most ancient people that were sovereigns in Greece." Herodotus >a\ s
(bk. viii., ch. xliv.), " The Athenians, when the Pelasgians
possessed that which is now called Hellas, were Pelasgiaus."



Sanskrit Notice of Pelasgia. 163
A knowledge of this Pelasgian nation seems to be recorded in Sanskrit literature, which shows considerable information relative to Europe and Western Asia, and a better acquaintance with Western Europe in ancient times than we find in Greek literature. Wilford, in the 8th volume of "Asiatic Researches," describing what old Sanskrit books say of certain sub-dwipas, quotes and comments as follows :
" The third [sub] dwipa is Placsha, or the coun
try abounding in fig-trees. It is called Palangshu by the mythologists of Bootan, and included the Lesser Asia, Ar
menia, and other countries. The name still remains in
Placia, a town of Mysia, whose inhabitants, with those of
Scylace, had a peculiar language (according to Herodotus), which was the same as that spoken by the Pelasgi at Orestone or Crotone in Italy, and by the Pelasgi who lived on the shores of the Hellespont. Thus the appellation Placsha, or Palangshu, appears to be the same with Placia and
Pelasgia." We have no means to determine whether the Greek or the Sanskrit word most resembles the old name
used by the Pelasgians themselves, but this Sanskrit subdwipa, or country of Placsha or Palangshu, formed in the northwestern part of the more ancient Cusha-dwipa, can mean nothing different from that ancient nation of the Pe
lasgians, which, according to the Greeks, occupied the same
territory. Research has shown very conclusively that the Pelas
gians belonged to the Aryan race. Their language seemed "barbarous" to Herodotus, because it differed so much from the dialect he used that he could not understand it.
The Greeks, who, it is said, were c< insignificant in the ear
lier times," were undoubtedly a family group of this people, with which many other Pelasgian tribes or communi



104- Pre-Historic Nations.
ties were finally incorporated. The Pelasgians doubt less represented a mixture of several branches of the Aryan
family, and, to some extent, a mixture of races, for in later times there were, in the cities of Asia Minor, lonians like Thales, who claimed to be "of Phoenician extraction." There was probably a mixture of races in the Phoenician
cities of Asia Minor in the earlier periods of their existence. The national organization known as Pelasgia or Phu>l.a could not have lasted many ages. AY hat Ilcsiod said of
the Leleges, an important branch of the Pelasgian p< was doubtless true of the whole; they were "a people gathered from among the nations of the earth." Straho
says: "The Telasg'ians were a nation disposed to wanner, ready to remove from settlement to settlement, and tlicy c-xperienced both great increase and sudden diminution of their number." It is nowise surprising that these IVlasgians went in such large numbers to Italy and Southwest
ern Europe, leaving the Greek family predominant in Ionia and Hellas.
Clinton (Fasti Hellenic!, vol. i., p. 5-10) says: "A dynasty of Pelasgic chiefs existed in Greece before any other
dynasty is heard of in Greek traditions. Excepting in this
line, none of the genealogies ascend higher than the ninth, or eighth, or seventh generation before the Trojan War. Danatis is in the ninth, Deucalion in the eighth, Cadn the seventh generation before that epoch. But in th
lasgic branch of the nation, Phoroneus is in the eighteenth before the Trojan \Yar ; the founder of Sicyon is his con
temporary ; and the Pelasgic chief who planted the Pelasgians in Thessaly is five generations earlier than Deucalion.
Inachus, the father of Phoroneus, was the highest term in Grecian history." The lists name nine Pelasgian kimr*

who reigned previous to the time of Danaiis, beginning with Inachus. But none of these lists can be received as
accurate in all respects, nor can it be reasonably assumed
that Phoroneus, like some of the later kings named in them,
reigned at Argos. The extensive Pelasgian kingdom established by Inachus and Phoroneus must have begun to break up before the
time of the expulsion of the Hyksos from Egypt, which appears to have sent several Cushite leaders and colonies into Greece. Clinton seems to favor the chronological estimates which give the year 1875 B.C. as the first year of
the reign of Inachus, and places that of Phoroneus twentyfive years later. It is probable that the realm of the king
of Argos who was displaced by Danatis was a fragment only of what had been the kingdom of Phoroneus. Ac
cording to Eratosthenes, the probable date for Danaiis at Argos is 1466 B.C. ; and he gives 1753 B.C. as the date of Phoroneus.
MINOS AND HIS CONQUESTS.
There is neither a record nor a tradition relative to the
date of Minos that has sufficient probability to deserve attention. His time may have been older than any date that has been assigned for it. To claim him as a Dorian
Greek is improbable and absurd. He and his people were Phoenicians or Arabian Cushites, for Crete was an important
part of the territorial possessions of that people. He may have lived at the close of the Sidonian period, when, as a successful revolutionist, he may have driven the Sidonians from the islands and other regions around the ^Egean ; or
he may have been the successful conqueror who broke up the kingdom of the Pelasgians. Tradition connects Minos



166 Pre-Historie Nations.
with the Phoenician race. He was, perhaps, the first ruler
who gave Crete a separate and independent government.
This appears to be signified by the statement that " the
Cretans traced their legal and political institutions to Mi
nos." The oldest traditions celebrate him as a just law
giver; and one, of later date, makes him a brother of Kluul
amanthus ; but Ephorus, quoted by Strabo, says :
" Minos
was an nnitator of Rhadamantlms, an ancient personage, and a just and wise man." There is an old tradition that Uhadamanthus was a king of Arabia. Herodotus says:
"31 inns wa< a great conqueror, and prospered in all his wars."
According to the uniform testimony of antiquity. Civil-, in the time of Minos, was a powerful maritime state; ami it is said that ho not only suppressed piracy, but also made himself master of the ^Egcan Islands. Many traditions connect Cretan supremacy with the cities of Asia Minor.
For instance, the building of Miletus is assigned to Civtans, while the more correct representation, according to Pausanias, seems to be that a body of Cretans, led by Mile
tus, took possession of the city and changed its name. " Before their arrival the place was nairn-d Anaotoria, and more
anciently Lelegis." It appears most probable that Minos waged war against the Pelasgians, and that he gained control of all the maritime regions around the ^Egean. Like that of the Pelasgians, the empire he established seems to have been of short duration. It must have terminated sev
eral centuries previous to the beginning of the Ionian con
federacy. An authentic history of Minos and Pelas^ia would show us something of the lost history of Phoenicia, and make clearer the "Legendary and Heroic Age of Greece."



No Phoenician Book remains. 167
THE PHCEXICIAX LANGUAGE AXD LITEEATUEE.
According to the uniform and explicit testimony of Greek
and Roman antiquity, the art of alphabetical writing was brought into existence, or first diffused, by the Phoenicians. This art was evidently originated by the Arabian Cushites
in ages older than Egypt or Chaldea. It is said, also, that the Phoenicians had an extensive literature. It could not
be otherwise with the most enlightened people of antiquity a people celebrated in all the nations of their time for
intellectual activity, and skill in the art of writing ; but
their literature has perished. Not one book, or fragment of a book, in the Phoenician language, has been preserved.
t\re have a Greek translation of Hanno's record of his
voyage down the west coast of Africa, and translated frag
ments of a " History," imputed to an ancient Phoenician
author named Sanchoniathon, but supposed by some to be
a work of the later times, and perhaps a forgery. We have
also extracts, preserved in Greek by Josephus and others, from Phoenician histories by writers whose names are given
as Dius and Menander. In quoting them, Josephus stated
as a fact well known that " there were (in his time) records
among the Tyrians that took in the history of many years, and that these were public writings kept with great exactness." Phoenician writers were eminent for works on sci
ence, philosophy, and theology. Strabo states that, in his time, they were eminent for culture in astronomy, mathe
matics, and " night sailing" that astronomy and arithmetic came from Phoenicia and adds :
" At the present time, these cities afford the best opportunities for acquiring a knowledge of these and of all other branches of philoso
phy."

It is generally assumed that the Phoenicians spoke Hebrew, or a dialect almost identical with the Hebrew. The
correctness of this assumption, however, has not been clearly demonstrated, while modern researches have shown that the earliest language of the country was Hamitic or Cush
ite. If we suppose, what seems necessary, that the lirst. settlements in Phoenicia were quite as old as Egypt or Chaldea, we must suppose, also, that the ancient Cushite
tongue first used there underwent important changes with
t!u- progress of time, and was more than once developed in new forms during the thirty centuries previous to the rise
of Assyria. We have no specimen not even an epigraph to show any form of the language during that period, excepting the words that have been preserved by ge< phy and mythology, which are not Hebrew. Various epigraphs and a few inscriptions, none of them older than the sixth century before Christ, and most of them several centuries later, furnish the most important linguistic remains of Phoenicia. .V groat number of medals, coins,
and epigraphs have been recovered, chiefly in Cyprus, Crete, Cilicia, Sicily, Malta, Southern Spam, and Northern Africa, These, with an inscription discovered at Marseilles,
all belong to the Carthaginian period, when Phoenicia had declined, and when the Cushite speech of the Phoenicians,
if not already superseded by a Semitic dialect, must have become so corrupted in its vocabulary, and in some of its
forms, by Semitic influence, as no longer to resemble it
self.*
* Sir Henry Rawlinson mentions Phoenician inscriptions, found in As
syrian ruins, that are as old as the reign of Tiglath Pileser, 744-726 B.C.
I Ir says, " They are among the most ancient specimens we possess of Phoenician writing." See the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, New



Phoenician Inscriptions. 160
The first attempt to explore the ruins of Phoenicia was made in 1854, at Sidon (or Saida),by the French. Gold coin of the age of Alexander the Great was found, and,
also, an important sepulchral inscription on a royal sarcophagus. This inscription, now in the Museum of the Louvre, tells us that the sarcophagus contained the mortal
remains of Ashmunazer, a king of the Sidonians. Ernest
Renan, who has had charge of the explorations, thinks it belongs to the sixth century before the Christian Era. In 1860, excavation in the ruins of Phoenicia was renewed by
direction of the French government. Several fields of operation were selected ; and excavations were made at Ruad
or Aradus, Tortosa or Antaradus, Martu or Marathos, Gebal or Byblus, Sidon, Tyre, and a place now called Oum-clAwamid. Several other inscriptions have been found, and gome important remains of ancient Phoanicia have been
brought to light. In the fourth edition of his work on the Semitic Ian
guages, Renan gives some account of the linguistic discoveries made at Sidon in 1854-5. He assumes, like others,
that the Phosnicians spoke a Semitic language closely allied
to the Hebrew, but finds that "a great number of passages in the Phoenician texts cannot be explained by such He
brew ^is we are acquainted with," and presumes that, " in the separate development of the two peoples so opposed in character and manners, the two languages, although identical at the beginning, became different." He finally takes
this view of the linguistic question :
" There is but little doubt that the Phoenician, indepen
dently of its similarity to the Hebrew, had its own forms,
Series, vol. i., p. 243-4. He points out only that the characters are Fhcs

which gave it an individuality of its own in the bosom of the Semitic family ; but Phoenician studies are not yet suf
ficiently advanced, or, if you will, the Phoenician texts are not yet sufficiently numerous to allow us to determine
those forms with precision. The epigraphists, who, by means of readings more or less conjectural, create grammatical forms on their own authority, or combine arbitra
rily those which they find in neighboring dialects, use a method that is much too convenient."
It is possible that, in the latest period of their history,
when the great ages of their intelligence and enterprise had gone by, the people of the little district called Phoenicia used a Semitic dialect. The language of Chaldea was
changed in this way during the Assyrian period. A thick veil of obscurity covers the history of Northern Arabia, Syria, and the neighboring countries of Asia Minor for more than a thousand years previous to the invasions by which
all those countries were subjected to the sway of Assyria.
Important political and linguistic changes may be supposed of which we have no record. If we allow that the
Phoenicians, during the ten centuries previous to the fall of Carthage, used a Semitic dialect, it by no means follows
that this was their original tongue. The change did not extend -to Northern Africa, where Cushite dialects representing the ancient Phoenician language of that region are still used by the people called Berbers.
There are some facts which appear to show that the lan
guage of Phoenicia, at the time of the Assyrian invasions, near the close of the ninth century, had become notably different from that of the Phoenician communities in Africa
and Spain. The great emigration from Tyre to Carthago, about the year 813 B.C., seems to have earned to the lat



Two Classes of Inscriptions. 171
ter city a language quite different from that of the native
Carthaginians. It is very significant that Gesenius and others have found it necessary to recognise two classes of
inscriptions in Africa : (1.) Those found at Carthage, which resemble all others that represent the direct influence of
Pho3nicia in its later ages ; and, (2.) The inscriptions found in Africa at a distance from Carthage, with which those discovered in Southern Spain must be classed. The differ
ences in the writing are marked, and the fact suggests that
the Tyrians who migrated to Carthage took with them a style of writing, and probably a dialect, different from those carried to Northern Africa and Spain by the Phoeni
cians in earlier times. It may be added that Sallust (Ju
gurtha, cap. Ixxviii.), mentioning Leptis, a city between the Syrtes founded in later times by the Sidonians, observes
that, although its laws and worship remained the same, the language of its inhabitants had been recently changed by their intermarrying with the Numidians (Ejus civitatis lingua tnodo conversa connubis Jfatmidarum).
It is not certain, however, that there was an actual change
of language in Phoenicia, previous to the Christian Era, from Cushite to Semitic. There may have been great corruption of the Cushite tongue used there, which filled it with
Semitic words and affected many of its forms, and this may
explain that Hebrew physiognomy of the Phoenician epi
graphs and inscriptions which has engaged so much attention. If we had no knowledge of modern Persian beyond a few brief sentences that could be selected from its liter
ature, it might be suspected of Arabic affinities ; and mod
ern Turkish, tested in the same way, might raise a dispute between Persian and Arabic claims that would obscure its
actual relation to the Turanian or Scythic family. We

cannot reasonably be very positive in regard to the linguistic significance of the few Phoenician words and sen
tences that have been recovered. As Renan says, " Phoenician studies are not yet sufficiently advanced" to bring
the question to a satisfactory settlement.



V.
ARABIAN ORIGIN OF CHALDEA.
HISTORICAL skepticism, standing rigidly by the first Greelc Olympiad, and refusing to see beyond that anything but a dark realm of unmeaning fiction, must at times find it dif
ficult to maintain self-respect. It cannot be entirely blind. It must now and then turn to the great past, which is not
so completely shut up in darkness as it pretends and tries
to believe, with a feeling that its bold denials have nothing in common with the excellency of wisdom. The historical
skeptic must at times feel stirring in his mind the painful emotions of doubt when his philosophy stands looking, with the helpless stare of foolishness, at the undeniable
facts that confound its reasonings and shame its credulity.
For instance, how is it possible for this skepticism to con
sider honestly what is known of Egypt, India, and Chaldea, and still maintain that nothing can be seen in remote an
tiquity but fables floating in darkness ?
The fact that Chaldea, in very ancient times, was a seat of enlightened civilization, has been admitted and discussed
from the beginning of what is usually called the historic
period. We see it also in writings older than this period the Hebrew Scriptures. The discoveries made in that
country by the Greeks, after the conquest of Babylon by Alexander, gave the Western world some knowledge of the science and general culture of the Chaldeans. Their civil
ization became an ascertained fact, which subsequent ages



174 P rc-Historic Nations.
have been constrained to recognise and respect. Chaldean science has furnished one of the most important and gener
ally respected dates of ancient history, while, at the same time, Ancient History, as heretofore written, has talked of Babylon, and described the wonderful Babylon of the com
paratively modern time of Nebuchadnezzar, without noticing the much more ancient kingdom of Chaldea, and even without admitting the existence in that part of Asia of any
monarchy older than that of the Assyrians.
But Chaldea, so distinctly seen through the age-. ;;n<l io constantly misunderstood, is at length brought more fully to our observation by recent discoveries in the ruins of
some of its older cities. We can see now that the As.-yri
an empire was preceded by a much older kingdom of Chaldea, which existed during a much longer period of time, and, in the matters of race and language, had little or nothing in common with the Assyrians. This should have been discovered by the Greeks of Alexander's time, when there were books as well as monuments to aid inquiry ; but the Greeks failed to make a clear report of this fact, because
neither their culture nor their spirit qualified them for such
investigations ; but they saw and admitted the great ex
tent of Chaldean civilization, and the history of Berosus, written nearly a century later, was never discredited in Greece.
CHALDEAN CIVILIZATION AND LEARNING.
At the present time, some writers, enlightened by the repults of recent investigation, and not taking due account of the older Cushites and Aryans, have a tendency to exaggerate or overstate both the originality and the influence
of ancient Chaldean civilization. George Rawlinsion, in



Greek Discoveries in Chaldea. 175
his valuable work "The Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World" speaks of it thus :
" Chaldea stands as the great parent and inventress of Asiatic civili
zation, without any rival that can reasonably dispute her claims." This awards to Chaldea what belongs to the Cushites and Aryans. The much more ancient Cushite
civilization created Chaldea, and that country was origin
ally, for centuries, merely a province of the great empire of Cusha-dwipa. It appears to have become, at a very early period, one of the most important representatives of the civilization of that pre-historic empire. Beyond this there
is nothing to warrant the exaggerated representation of Mr. Rawlinson. Millenniums must be counted between the
origin of Chaldea and the beginning of human development in Asia. Nevertheless, the beginning of Chaldea was in
very remote times.
Among the discoveries made at Babylon by the Greeks there was one of great importance, which in better hands would have been of far more service to the world ; but in their hands it has served as a light to show the extent of Chaldean science. Mr. Rawlinson speaks of it as follows :
" We are informed by Simplicius that Callisthenes, who accompanied Alexander to Babylon, sent to Aristotle from that capital a series of astronomical observations which he
had found preserved there, extending back to a period of 1903 years from Alexander's conquest of the city. Epigenes related that these observations were recorded in tablets of baked clay, which is quite in accordance with what we knowr of the literary habits of the people. They must
have extended, according to Simplicius, as far back as 2234 B.C., and would seem to have been commenced and carried on for many centuries by the primitive Chaldean peo



176 Pre-Historic Nations.
pie. We have no means of determining their exact nature or value, as none of them have been preserved to us, but we have every reason to conclude that they were of a real and
substantial character. There is nothing fanciful or (so to
speak) astrological in the early astronomy of the Babylonians."
The Rev. Dr. Roger Long, a learned and enthusiastic astronomer, who wrote on this subject about the middle of the last century, remarked on the astronomical tablets sent
from Babylon as follows: "How much it is to be lamented
that the observations of 1903 year.-, lran>mittc<l to Aris
totle by Callisthenes from Babylon a treasure in prac
tical astronomy which was probably inestimable, and <>(' which Aristotle was not acquainted with cither the use or the value did not happen to fall into the hands of his
contemporary, Eudoxus !" The regret lie expressed was very natural. Others have
felt it, and given it similar expression. It is certainly lamentable that those important records, after being examined, talked of, reported to the world for the entertainment
of curiosity and wonder, should be laid away to become rubbish, and perish without farther use. Perhaps unac
knowledged uses of those records brought some benefit to
the science of astronomy in Greece, where all that was known of this science came from Egypt and the East ; but they should have been transcribed and studied; Chaldean books and records should have been explored for addition
al information; and a complete account of the inve> tion should have been preserved in the works of Aristotle.
Evidence of great proficiency in the science of astronomy is found in the oldest Chaldean ruins, and doubtless similar records of more ancient date could have been found in the



Chaldean Astronomy. 177
older cities and temples of the country. Aristotle, in his
De Ccelo, lib. ii., cap. xii., describing his observation of an occultation of Mars by the moon, refers to the records sent
to him by Callisthenes, in a general way, as follows :
" Similar observations have been made for many years on the
other planets by the Egyptians and the Babylonians, many of which have come to our knowledge."
Ideler, quoted and indorsed by Humboldt, says :
" The Chaldeans knew the mean motions of the moon with an exactness which induced the Greek astronomers to use their calculations for the foundation of a lunar theory." Ptole
my, as may be learned from his Almagest, made use of that portion of the Chaldean observations which extended back
to the year 721 B.C., obtained, doubtless, from an independent source. In Alexander's time, Chaldean culture was
fast declining ; its great era was in the past ; the great observatory of the Temple of Belus was in ruins ; but there were .eminent mathematicians at Babylon, the report of whose names is recorded by Strabo, and there were schools
of astronomy. That the Chaldeans had great knowledge of astronomy was admitted by the Greeks and Romans. The Greeks, and through them the Romans, had means of being well informed on this subject. The Greeks evidently had knowledge of Chaldean books and records in which the astronomical attainments of that people were abundantly shown. The campaign -of Alexander formed a great
epoch in the history of Hellenic culture by opening to it a
wider view of the world, and bringing it into closer rela
tions with the civilization and science of the East. The
gain was great, and it was to some extent acknowledged. Diodorus Siculus says the Chaldeans attributed comets
to natural causes, and could foretell their reappearance.

He states that their recorded observations of the planets
were very ancient and very exact. According to Seneca, their theory of comets was quite as intelligent and correct as that of the moderns. He says they classed them with
the planets, or moving stars that had fixed orbits (cometas in numero stellarum errantium poni-d Chaldceis^tencriyuc cursos eorum. Natur. Quest., lib. vii., 2). Their methods for the use of cycles and other astronomical appliances, in
arranging and measuring time, showed a correct and profound knowledge of this science. Astronomy implies mathematics ; and the Chaldeans, like every other people of Cushite origin, had great knowledge of mathematics.
Much progress in astronomy requires the telescope, or something equivalent ; and it seems necessary to believe that the ancients had such aids to eyesight. Layanl and oth
ers report the discovery of "a lens of considerable power"
in the ruins of Babylon.* It certainly would be surprising
if necessity, " the mother of invention," had not brought 8ii eh aids to the astronomers of ancient Arabia, Chaldea,
Ivn'ypt, and India. I have already shown that the genius which made such attainments in astronomy must have been able to contrive whatever instruments were necessary to
progress in the science. Thought and invention did not begin with the moderns. It was then quite as possible as now to sec and devise what was necessary. Even the Greeks and Romans, with lower attainments
* Layard says this lens was found, with two glass bowl?, in a chamber of the ruin called Nimroud. It is plano-convex, an inch and a half in diameter and nine tenths of an inch thick. It gives a focus at 4 inches
from the plane side. Sir David Brewster says, " It was intended to be used ns a lens, either for magnifying, or condensing the rays of the sun."

in astronomy, had aids to eyesight. They arc mentioned
in De Placitis Phil., lib. iii., c. v., attributed to Plutarch;
also in his Vita Marcdli ; and by Pliny, Hist. 2Tatur., lib.
xxx viL, c. v., where he says that, in his time, artificers used emeralds to assist the eye, and that they were made concave the better to collect the visual rays (smaragdi eidem
plerumque et concavi lit visum colligant). He adds that Nero used such glasses when he watched the fights of the gladiators. There is frequent mention of concave and con
vex glasses used for optical purposes, and they evidently came from Egypt and the East. lamblichus tells us, in
Ids life of Pythagoras, that Pythagoras sought to contrive
instruments that should aid hearing as effectually as " optic glasses"* and other contrivances aided sight. Plutarch speaks of mathematical instruments used by Archimedes
" to manifest to the eye the largeness of the sun." Pythagoras and Archimedes both studied in Egypt and Phoeni
cia, and probably in Chaldea; for Pythagoras, who lived in the sixth century before Christ, is said to have visited
"Egypt and many countries of the East" in pursuit of knowledge ; and Archimedes, who lived after the time of
Alexander, spent much time in Egypt, and visited " many other countries." It appears that, in the time of Pythag
oras, " optic glasses," contrived to increase the power of
vision, were so common as not to be regarded as objects of curiosity, and there can be no reasonable doubt that they were first invented and used by the great men who created
that profound science of astronomy for which people of
Cushite origin were everywhere so pre-eminently distinguished, and which was so intimately connected with their
religion.

HISTORY OF CIIALDEA BY BEROSUS.
The Greeks failed to give the world such an account of
Chaldea as its importance required. Much, however, may have been written on this subject which has not come down
to us. Callisthenes wrote a history of Alexander's great
campaign against the Persians, which has perished entirely ; and there were narratives by Megasthenes, Xearchus, and Aristobulus. Others undoubtedly wrote something on the
countries he occupied, but nothing in the literature' of the ancients, as we have it, indicates that any Greek undertook
to write a history of Babylon and of the country to which
it belonged, although much is found in some portions of that literature relating to the Babylonians. Nevertheless, nearly 300 years before Christ, a regular history of Chaldea, in nine books, was written in Greek by Berosus, a Chaldean priest of Belus. The materials for this work were supplied by archives then existing in the temple of Belus at Babylon. Like many other works of the
highest importance, it was allowed to perish. What we know of its contents is found in extracts from it, f and thus preserved by writers whose works still exist. Berosus gave the oldest traditions of the Chaldeans con
cerning the origin of the human race, described Chaldea and its people, related their history, and furnished a list of
Chaldean sovereigns down to the beginning of the Assyrian empire, about the year 1273 B.C. Its chief feature was
a history of the kingdom of Chaldea previous to the time of that empire a kingdom that may have counted more millenniums than the Assyrian empire counted centuries. Of course this work could not be properly accepted by any modern system of chronology ; therefore it has been set



Ancient Kings of Chaldea. 181
aside as of no account by those schemes of ancient history
which modern chronology has indorsed as orthodox; but it was not discredited either by the Greeks for whom it
was written, or by the early Christian fathers, who gave it much attention; and modern exploration in the old ruins of Chaldea has confirmed its statements as substantially
correct. Fragments of this wrork of Berosus have come down to
us in the writings of Josephus, Eusebius, Syncellus, and several of the Christian fathers. It does not appear that
he gave a particular and complete account of the early ages of the Chaldean kingdom, nor is it certain that his list of
the kings goes back to its earliest times. It may be that
his enumeration of actual sovereigns begins with that g^eat epoch in the history of the country when the whole vas
first united under one government. Nevertheless, the list, as it stands, is quite too long to please unreformed chro
nologists. The extract from his history in which it is found
describes the long cyclical antediluvian ages, in which ten
fabulous kings reigned 432,000 years. Then, coming to what he considered history, it enumerates 163 kings of
Chaldea, who reigned successively from the time when the list begins to the rise of the Assyrian empire. Berosus
begins with a dynasty of 86 kings, of whose time he knew nothing. He gave the names of these kings, which are
lost. He had no history or chronology of their time, there
fore he subjected it to a cyclical calculation, which gives it more a look of myth than of history. In the religious,
political, and linguistic changes of the country, the records of the first dynasties had been lost. They had suffered the
usual waste of time. The extracts from his work, in pass
ing through the hands of many copyists, have necessarily



182 Pre-Historic Nations.
become more or less imperfect. His list, as we have it, is
as follows :
First, 80 Chaldean kings history and time mythical.
Second, 8 Median " during 224 years.
Third, 11 Fourth, 49 Chaldean ' ;
Fifth, 9 Arabian i; during 2 15 years.
The rulers of the Assyrian Empire were next added as a
sixth dynasty, and the history was brought down to the
capture of Babylon by Cyrus the Great. The blank spaces in the list are doubtless the result of careless copying, and
of imperfections created in manuscripts by use and time.
A great amount of resolute ingenuity has been employed to bring Berosus into harmony with the popular chronolo
gy, especially since archaeology has begun to remove the obscurity in which ancient Chaldea has been shrouded.
Sir Henry Rawlinson, without having himself originated devices for this purpose, has embarrassed his own investigations by using some of the cleverest and boldest of those
contrived by others. Admitting freely that " each succeeding discovery has tended to authenticate the chronology of Berosus, and to throw discredit upon the tales of Ctesias and his followers," he has nevertheless looked with too much favor on the efforts of those contrivers of "chronological harmony" who have treated Berosus somewhat as
Ctesias treated the facts of Mesopotamian history. He
gives prominence to an " emendation" proposed in a pamphlet by Dr. Brandis, entitled "Rerum Assyriarum Tempora
Emendata" and describes it as " a most ingenious suggestion of German criticism."
The purpose of this brilliant ingenuity is to make tho old kingdom of Chaldea begin with the year 2234 !>.(' ;



Chronologists on Berosus. 183
therefore its first step is to declare, in the boldest way, that
the first part of the list of Berosus is " fabulous." The first
86 kings are struck out with the best air of historical skep
ticism, although nothing requires it or justifies it save the "necessities of chronological harmony." It is the same
unscrupulous method that was employed against the an
cient history of Egypt. Next, the Median dynasty is " left out of consideration," as representing a Magian race who ruled in Babylon before the Cushites went there a neces
sary but most unwarranted hypothesis. To these " emendations" two others are added ; the next dynasty in order
is described as " Chaldean" (which may be correct), and its time is given as 258 years; and a number is devised for the dynasty of 49 Chaldean kings, which makes the whole time of its duration no more than 458 years a desperate
manoeuvre, which secures the date required while it insults common sense. The scheme of Chaldean history devel
oped by this operation would amaze Berosus. It is as follows :
First, 11 (Chaldean kings), (258) years, from 2234 to 197G.
Second, 49 " " (458) years, from 1976 to 1518.
Third, 9 Arabian " (245) years, from 1518 to 1273.
The hundred and sixty-three kings of Berosus are re
duced to sixty-nine, the popular chronology is rescued
temporarily from a great embarrassment, and " ingenuity"
wears a crown of laurel. A scheme very similar to this is quoted in George Rawlinson's "Five Monarchies" as
" Gutschmidt's revision." In each case it is admitted that
astronomical calculations began at Babylon in the year 2234 B.C. It follows, of course, that the great Chaldean
culture, the temple of Belus with its observatory, the city of Babylon, and the organized schools of Chaldean science,



Pre-Historic Nations.
were all in existence at the very beginning of the Cu shite occupation of the country, which is incredible. Such at
tempts to establish a compromise between Berosus and
false chronology must necessarily be failures. They are
false and mischievous in all respects.
The hypothesis that the country was occupied by a
" Magian" or Aryan race before the Cushites went there
is explicitly contradicted not only by Berosus, but also by the testimony of records disentombed from the ruins, which show incontestably that the race which first occu
pied Lower Mesopotamia and introduced civilization was neither Aryan nor Semitic. Rawlinson himself admits this
without qualification. That "Median dynasty" was preceded by long ages of Chaldean supremacy and culture,
and, according to Berosus, whose testimony cannot now be
invalidated, by a line of 86 Chaldean kings. Those who are not frightened by such amounts of past time as this
implies will not be in haste to discredit the testimony by
which it is supported. Exploration has found some of the older cities of the country, but the oldest structures and
first foundations of those cities were probably long siiu-e
beyond its reach. We cannot doubt that the discovery
of ancient Chaldea will be made still more complete by farther exploration in the ruins and among the records al
ready recovered.
That " ingenious suggestion of German criticism" (not the most intelligent German criticism, however) invents one number which is in itself too unreasonable to win favor.
According to its revision, the 49 Chaldean kings reL

nounces " quite impossible in a settled monarchy like the Chaldean." Nevertheless, instead of censuring this reck
less invention of " ingenuity," he proposes to reduce the
number of the kings ! and that, too, without the slightest warrant for doing so, beyond the desire to reach a given conclusion. Writers of ancient history have usually paid great respect to the year 2234 B.C. The astronomical rec
ord found at Babylon began with that date; but this
was not the beginning of Chaldean history, and any attempt to make it so is preposterous. Rawlinson himself mentions a Cushite or Hamitic inscription, found in Susiana, in which there is a date that goes back nearly to the
year 3200 before Christ.
CHALDEAN ANTIQUITIES AND TRADITIONS.
Ancient Chaldea consisted of the lower part of the rich
alluvial region between the Euphrates and the Tigris, al
though it seems to have included, or to have been very in
timately connected with, other territory on the opposite sides of both rivers, especially the important district known as Susiana. The name Chaldea comes to us from Semitic languages the Aramaic and the Hebrew through
the Greek. In their inscriptions the people are called Akkadim. Whether described as Cushites or as Hamites in
linguistic reports on the inscriptions, the people represented by the Chaldean ruins were all of the same race. The
uniform statement is that " all the kings whose monuments are found in ancient Chaldea used the same language and
the same power of writing, professed the same religion, and followed the same traditions." Tljere are traces of intercourse with other races ; Aryan, Semitic, and Turanian elements are noticed : and, in later ao;es of the kingdom,

there seems to have been a remarkable mixture of races at
Babylon. There appears to be some evidence that the Cushite dialect of Susiana was a little different from that
of Lower Chaldea, and, probably, other differences of dia
lect will come clearly to light as the investigation goes forward.* Berosus stated, as an old tradition of the Chaldean peo
ple, that their ancestors and their civilization came origin
ally from a region on the Erythraean Sea, which is confirmed by discoveries in the ruins. By the Erythraean Sea the ancients usually meant the waters of the Indian Ocean and
Persian Gulf. He gives, also, an old Chaldean tradition,
which seems to preserve a recollection of the first impres
sion made upon the rude aboriginal inhabitants of the country by the beginning of their intercourse witli the
maritime people of Arabia who gave them civilization. In
our day, some of the South Sea Islanders supposed the first
ship they saw to be a living creature. This tradition, as stated by Berosus and quoted ly Alexander Polyhistor, is as follows :
"In the first year there appeared from that part of the Erythraean Sea which borders on Babylonia an animal des
titute of reason, by name Oannes, whose whole bod} that of a fish; and under the fish's head he had another
* The desire to make the Turanian the most ancient ethnic element in Western Asia comes from the wholly untenable theory that Chinese is the oldest language in the world ; that Turanian speech was the first devel
opment from it ; and that the Cushite, Semitic, and Aryan languages were developed from the Turanian. This is romance, not science. Meanwhile, the most ancient ethnic element is so clearly Cushite, that tlioitheorists resort to the device of classing the Hamite or Cushite group of tongues as a branch of the Turanian family.

head, with feet also similar to those of a man. His voice,
too, and language, were articulate and human ; and a representation of him is preserved even unto this day. This being was accustomed to pass the day among men ; and he gave them an insight into letters and sciences, and arts of
every kind. He taught them to construct cities, to found
temples, to frame laws, and explained to them the princi
ples of geometrical knowledge. He made them distinguish the seeds of the earth, and showed them how to collect the
fruits ; in short, he instructed them in everything that could
tend to soften their manners and humanize their lives.
And, when the sun was set, this being, Cannes, retired again
to the sea, and passed the night in the deep." This is plainly a mythical reference to the first remem
bered appearance in the Euphrates of ships from a civilized country, and of the first introduction into Chaldea of the
arts of civilized life. The ship, Cannes, described as a
wonderful being and transformed into a sea-god, appeared
in that part of the Erythraean Sea which borders on Babylonia ; that is to say, it came from the coast of Arabia.
The enlightened Cushites or Ethiopians of Arabia, the maritime adventurers, the princely merchants, the enlightened masters in science, the wonderful colonizers of remote an
tiquity, brought civilization to the barbarous Semites of
Mesopotamia. They came in, established colonies, and oc
cupied the whole country, giving it their religion, their science, their manners and customs, and all their arts of civil
ized life. Even their language was made supreme, exclud
ing the Semitic dialects everywhere, excepting perhaps at the West, and in that part of the country afterwards known
as Assyria.

THE CHALDEAN EUINS AND INSCRIPTIONS.
Lower Chaldea, now a desolation thinly inhabited by
nomadic tribes, was formerly the most populous region on
the globe. AY illiam Kennett Loftus, in his record of " Travel s and Researches in Chaldea," makes this statement :
" In
no other part of Babylonia is there' such astonishing proof of ancient civilization and denseness of population. Some
lofty pile is generally visible to mark the site of a once im
portant city, while numerous little spots, covered with broken pottery, point to the former existence of villages and of a rural population." George Rawlinson names the ruins
of twenty-five great cities within that small territory, be
sides the cities of Ur, Nipur, Larsa, Erech, and Babylon, whose ruins have been explored. He says, in the first vol
ume of his u Ancient Monarchies of the Eastern World,"
" Farther investigation will probably add largely to this catalogue, for many parts of Babylonia are still, to some extent, unexplored. This is especially true of the tract between the Shat-el-IIie and the Lower Tigris, a district
which, according to geographers, abounds with ruins."1 The most ancient ruins in Chaldea are those toward
south, such as Ur, Erech, and Senkereh ; and here, in the
neighborhood of the Persian Gulf (which at that time reached inland nearly 150 miles farther than at present).
the explorers place the primitive seat of Chaldean civilization. Mr. Loftus gives the following account of the present condition of the country: "The ruins ofWarka (the same as Freeh) are in latitude 39 19' X., and longitude
45 40' E., and are four miles distant from the nearest point
on the eastern bank of the Euphrates. An elevated tract of desert soil, ten miles in breadth, is slightly raided above

a series of inundations and marshes caused by the annual overflow of the Euphrates. Upon this are situated not only the ruins of Warka, but also of Senkereh, Tel Ede, and
Hammam all unapproachable except from November to
March, when the river assumes its lowest level." How different from what Chaldea was in the great days of her
glory, when populous and flourishing cities stood where we now find these almost inaccessible ruins ! Neither the soil
nor the atmosphere is the same. The ruins of four of the older Chaldean cities have been
explored, to some extent, with very notable results. These four are, 1. Mugheir, the same as Hur, or "Ur of the Chaldees," Mugheir being the modern Semitic name of the ruins; 2. Larsa (now called Senkereh), the same as Ellarsa of the Bible ; 3. "Warka or Hurruk, the same as Erech or
Orech of the Hebrews ; 4. Niffer, or Nipur, or Nopher, as the Talmud has it. The Talmudists conjecture, without good reason, that this last-named city was the same as
Calneh of the Hebrew Scriptures. We may, with much
better reason, suppose it to be the BtXfirj of Ptolemy, and the Babel of the tenth chapter of Genesis. Sir Henry Raw
linson says of it,
" This city had originally the name of the
god Belus, and is, perhaps, the BtX/3// of Ptolemy." He
thinks " the Greek traditions of the foundation of a great
city on the Euphrates by Belus refer to this place rather
than to Babylon." Reports of these investigations have appeared from time to time in the various European journals devoted to Orien
tal and archaeological subjects, and in the publications of English, French, and German scholars engaged in such inquiries, among which none are more important than those
of Sir Henry Rawlinson. A good summary of what has



190 Pre-IIitstoric Nations.
been found in the ruins of the Chaldean cities I have named is given in the first volume of George Rawlinson's "Five Great Monarchies of the Ancient Eastern World." Among
the important facts discovered are the following :
1. The ruins furnish what appears to be conclusive evi
dence, that civilization was brought to Chaldea from Ethi
opia that is to say, from Arabia. In the inscriptions, the two countries are connected in such a way as makes any other conclusion impossible. Their vernacular name for
Ethiopia is Mirukh, and its maritime enterprise is very dis
tinctly recognised. 2. The oldest city and first capital of the country was Ur. It seems to be understood that the settlement of the
country began with the building of Ur. At a later period. Erech was for a time the royal city ; but the great city of
the country, after it became independent and before the
rise of Babylon, was the city which, in Semitic speech, is called Nipur and Xiffer, and which tradition descril
the city of Belus, or the most ancient Babylon.
3. It is shown, as already mentioned, that the language of ancient Chaldea, found abundantly in these ruins, and that found in the ruins of Southern Arabia, belong to the same family, and that they are radically different from the
Semitic tongue of the Assyrian empire. This is the n-port
of all the best investigators who have studied the inscrip
tions. A Scythian or Turanian theory was started, which made Xiinrod a Turanian, and sought support in the }!(->
potamian -inscriptions. It was never anything more than
a very improbable theory. 4. As already stated, the ruins confirm Berosus by show
ing that Chaldea wr as a cultivated and flourishing nation,
governed by kings, long previous to the time when the city

known to us as Babylon rose to eminence and became the seat of empire. During that long time there were several
great political epochs in the history of the country, representing important dynastic changes, and several transfers of the seat of government from one city to another. Such epochs in Chaldean history are indicated by the list of Bc
rosus. The history of Berosus is confirmed and made authentic beyond reasonable question. There was never anything to discredit his account of Chaldea save the natural tendency
of false chronology to discredit literary records, and even the testimony of contemporaneous monuments, which cannot easily submit to its revisions. The oldest Chaldean cities were in the neighborhood of
the Persian Gulf. Ur, or Hur, represented as the first city
built by the colonizing Cushites, was situated at the mouth of the Euphrates, with the open sea before it. Its ruins are
now at a long distance from both. Sir Henry Rawlinson, in
the 27th volume of the Royal Geographical Society's Jour
nal, says: "When Chaldea was first colonized, or, at any rate, when the seat of empire was first established there, the emporium of trade seems to have been at Ur of the Chaldees, which is now 150 miles from the sea, the Persian Gulf having retired nearly that distance before the sedi
ment brought down by the Euphrates and Tigris." A little reflection on the vast period of time required to effect
a geological change so great as this will enable us tp see
to what a remote age in the deeps of antiquity we must go to find the beginning of civilization in the Mesopotamia!!
Valley. No discoveries made in the old ruins of the East
are more interesting or more important than those which unveil to us the enrlv history of Chaldea.



192 Pre-Historic Nations.
THE ORIGIN OF CHALDEA.
The linguistic and archaic obscurities in which some of the questions raised by these discoveries are buried, shut
them out from general discussion. Only those scholars
whose peculiar acquirements remove this difficulty, and whose profound linguistic studies of the cuneiform records have made them familiar with the intricacies in which
these questions are involved, are qualified to speak on the
subject with any degree of authority. All the best qualified investigators agree that the evidence already obtained
shows conclusively the Cushite or Ethiopian origin of Chal
dea. A note which Sir Henry Kawlinson appends to his
essay on the " Early History of Babylonia" speaks on this point as follows :
"All the traditions of Babylonia and Assyria point to a
connection, in very early times, between Ethiopia, Southern Arabia, and the cities on the Lower Euphrates. In the
geographical lists, the names of Minikh (Ethiopia) and Makkan are thus always conjoined with those of Ilur and
Akkad. The building of Hur, again, is the earliest historical event of which the Babylonians seem to have had any
cognizance; but the inscriptions constantly refer to a tra
dition of the primeval leader by whom the Cushites were
first settled on the Euphrates, and one of the names of this leader is connected with Ethiopia in a way that can hardly be accidental."
He finds, also, that the early Chaldeans were largely devoted to maritime pursuits in close connection with the
Ethiopians. He says, in the volume of the Royal Geo
graphical Society's Journal already quoted, " The ships of Ur, at any rate, are constantly mentioned (by the inscrip



How Ethiopia is misplaced. 193
tions) in connection with those of Ethiopia ; and there is
abundant evidence, among the remains of the city (Ur), of the worship of the sea-god, which alone would indicate
a maritime people, and wThich, moreover, is in exact accordance with the early traditions preserved by Berosus." Is it not absurd to seek at Meroe, or anywhere else on
the Upper Nile, for the maritime Ethiopia of these Chal
dean inscriptions? If every competent investigator would allow himself to see and comprehend the country which the ancients designated as Ethiopia and the Land of Cush, there would be no failure to recognise Arabia as the mother country of Chaldea ; and there would be a more intelli
gent appreciation of the large amount of ancient tradition which brings the Cushites into that part of Asia, and some
times describes it as a part of Ethiopia. It was Ethiopian
in race, language, and civilization, and constituted a portion
of the wide-spread territory occupied by the Cushites,
" from the extremity of the east to the extremity of the west."
Mr. Loftus states the common opinion of investigators
as follows : " Recent researches made in the interpretation of the cuneiform inscriptions have led to the belief that,
in the earliest ages previous to the historic period which began with Nimrod, the region north of the Persian Gulf was inhabited by a Semitic race, which was gradually dis
possessed by a powerful stream of invasion or colonization from the south. The Hamitic (or Cushite) element which prevails in the most ancient cuneiform records throughout
Babylonia and Susiana points to Ethiopia as the country of these new settlers." The evidence of an immigration
from the south seems unequivocal, and the immigrants are everywhere called Akkadim; the terms Akkad and AkkaI



104 Pre-Historic Nations.
dim are constantly used as ethnic designations, and Hebrew knowledge of them appears in the Akkad or Accad of Gen
esis. Tradition says these settlers came first in ships, and made their first settlements at Ur and Erech ; but Mr.
Loftus, having no just comprehension of Arabia, and fol
lowing the " common opinion," brings the Cushite immigrants from the Upper Nile Valley, across both the Red Sea and the Arabian Peninsula,
THE CUSHITE LANGUAGE IX CHALDEA.
The ruins found in Southern Arabia belong chiefly to
the period of the Himyaric and Sabean nationalities, which
were long subsequent to the great ages of Cushite supremacy. Some of them are very old, but they have not been
so carefully explored as their importance demands. The inscriptions secured by the researches of Wellsted, Arnaud, Fivsnel, and others, have furnished important materials for
linguistic investigation important especially in connection with studies of the cuneiform records. Among those who have given them careful examination are Jules Oppert and
other French Orientalists, who express in strong terms the result indicated by Sir Henry Rawlinson. They see clearly
that the language of the Arabian inscriptions is genetically related to that of ancient Chaldea. Modern dialects of this old Cushite tongue are still spoken in some districts of Arabia and Eastern Africa. Fresnel is sure, on philo
logical grounds alone, that the original Cushites of Chaldea \\ civ immigrants from Arabia. These investigations have interfered with Ernest Kenan's
theory of the Semitic languages and people, as set forth in
the first edition of his " Histoire Generale des Langues Se~
mitiques" At first he did not appear to recognise the ex



Renan on the Cushite Speech. 195
istence of a family of Ethiopian or Cushite languages. In this omission, however, he was not original. This family
of languages has not stood so directly in the path of inquiry as to command immediate attention. Renan had not stud
ied carefully the linguistic peculiarities of every branch of the people whom he classed as Semites. Like many others,
he had failed to recognise the profound diiference between the old Cushite race of Arabia, so celebrated in the olden time, and the modern Semitic Arabs a difference not like
ly to be forgotten when once fairly observed. In the preface to his second edition he had become aware
of this mistake; probably Oppert's Chaldean investigations had now effectually engaged his attention ; at any rate, he noticed the result of these inquiries, and promised
his readers an essay, in which he would " attempt to estab* lish that it is necessary to admit into the history of the civilization of the ancient world a third element, which is neither Semitic nor Aryan, and which may be called Ethi
opian or Cushite." It was quite important to notice Hamlet's part in the play ; but others before him had failed to discover and describe it. In a revision of the text of his
book he referred to the explorations and studies of Arnaud,
Fresnel, and Oppert, and said : " If these hypotheses shall be confirmed by a more complete investigation, it will become necessary to establish a group of Semitico- Cushite
languages, including the Himyaric, the Gheez, the Mahri,
and the language of the Babylonian inscriptions." Semitico-Cushite ! something might be said in behalf of Turano- Cushite ; and even Aryo- Cushite might find sup
porters. Renan and others will probably advance beyond all these prefixes ; and when they fully discover the great race that did more than any other to originate and spread

the civilization of the ancient world, they will probably
drop them all, and include the Egyptian, the Berber, and
some of the dialects of Southeastern Africa, w jth the others
named, in a family group of Cushite tongues a family great in the past, but of which we now have only the perishing remains.
POLITICAL CHANGES IN ANCIENT CIIALDEA.
In the very long period that must be allowed for the
duration of Chaldea, there were great epochs of political change and reconstruction of which no history can be written. These epochs are indicated in the list of Berosus by
the changes of dynasty, made sometimes by "successful invasion from abroad and sometimes by internal revolution, and in the cuneiform records by evidence of changes of
dynasty and of transfers of the seat of government from
one city to another. Should an average of only 20 ; each be allowed to the 163 kings who reigned in Chaldea
previous to 1273 B.C., excepting the Median and Arabian dynasties, whose time is given, this would carry back the beginning of the Chaldean kingdom of their time to the year 4662 B.C. It would make Chaldea as old as
Egypt, which cannot be deemed improbable. Great ep< x-lis
of political change would necessarily occur during so long a period of time.
The first 86 kings doubtless represent several dyna-but the past was already hazy around them in the time <f
Berosus, and had been so, probably, during many ages previous to his time. The succeeding "Median" dynasty rep
resents a successful invasion from abroad, not, however, by the " Medes" of our ancient histories, who belong to a much later period. There have been various conjectures concern

ing this word " Median," which may be a corrupt form of the designation used by Berosus. Some have supposed
these invaders were " Magians" of the, Aryan race, from
the north; with a greater show of probability, I may suppose they, came from the south (led by the celebrated Arabian king Zohak), where "Madian" or "Midian" Avas the name of an important branch of the Arabian Cushites. Did the prince and people of Susiana take the lead in ex
pelling this "Median" dynasty?- and was Susiana represented by the next dynasty of eleven kings, which stands in the list of Berosus, as AVC have it, without national des
ignation ? The region known as Susiana Avas politically connected with Chaldea from the earliest times. It Avas occupied by people of the same race, Avho, in the course of time, may have developed a Susianian dialect of the common lan
guage. This region AA^as probably included in the district
first colonized by the Cushites. Its ruins are of great an
tiquity, and shoAA^ plainly their Cushite origin. Old inscriptions have been found in the ruins of Susa. Sir Henry Rawlinson mentions some of them, giving the dates accord
ing to the chronology he follows. He says : " The inscriptions of Susa, for the most part, belong to the 8th century
B.C., the kings named in the legends being contemporary AATith Sennacherib, Sargon, and their immediate predecessors. There is, however, what appears to be a date in the long inscription of Sutruk Nakhunta on the broken obelisk at Susa two sets of numbers occurring, Avhich may be read as 2445 and 2455. If these numbers are really chronological, the era referred to will be nearly 3200 years B.C."
The political changes that made Erech a royal city, and finally transferred the seat of gOAr ernment to Nipur, must



Pre-IIistoric Nations.
have occurred during the time of the first 86 kings. The
inscriptions show that Erech was the capital during two reigns that of a king whose name is given as Sin-shada, and that of his father. There seems to have been a Sin
dynasty ; perhaps all the kings belonging to it reigned at Erech. Probably the kingdom of Chaldea, like most other
Cushite nationalities, was a union of separate municipalities, each having a distinct local government and prince of its own, as it is now in the Arabian kingdom of Oman. Occasionally one of these local princes, elevated to com
manding importance by his genius, or by some favoring condition of public affairs, may have taken supreme power
into his own hands.
One thing is shown clearly by the records explored. Nipur, the great city which had originally the name of Belus, and which Greek tradition frequently confounded with the later city of Babylon, was the capital of the king
dom during the most important period of its exist emv, and perhaps the longest. Sir Henry Rawlinson thinks the
Tower of Babel was at Nipur, where, at the present time, "the remains of a brick tower rise, in a conical form, enty feet above the plain." He connects Nimrod with this city, and says one of its ancient names was Td-An". Did Nimrod cause or direct the political changes that
t ransforred the seat of government to Nipur? The inscriptions have not yet answered the question, and there is no
authentic history to give us the desired information. Let
me repeat, however, that all this was long ages previous to the time when the later Babylon became the royal city. Nimrod, under various names, is celebrated in dislike and Semitic traditions in such a manner as makes it cer
tain that he was one of the greatest personages in early



Nivwrod in Chaldean History. 199
Chaldean history. All we know of him with certainty is what is told us in the tenth chapter of Genesis. There we
learn that he was a personage who rose to great reputa
tion, which became proverbial :
" Even as Nimrod, the mighty hunter before the Lord." He is set before us as a
great sovereign; and the record says, "The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh." It is not said that he built these cities, but that they
were " the beginning of his kingdom." It is usually assumed that Babel here means Babylon. This, however, is
conjecture, founded on supposed identity of names. The natural inference from this biblical record, taken in connection with what has been learned from the inscriptions, is that Nimrod caused a political reconstruction of Chaldea ; that he began the work by taking control of the cities
named; and that he won supreme authority throughout the whole country. Another verse in the same chapter intimates that he showed special favor to the Semitic por
tion of his subjects, and gathered them together in cities.
" Out of that land went forth Asshur," or, as the marginal reading has it, "he went forth into Asshur," and built
the Semitic cities Nineveh, Rehoboth, Calah, and Resen. This was the beginning of Assyria. It may be that Nimrod was the first king who reigned at Nipur. Some iden
tify him with Belus, reasoning thus : " As Ifcl (Baal), signifying lord, may have been the general title of the earliest kings, so Belus and Nimrod can easily have been one per
son." THE YEAR 2234 B.C.
I have already called attention to the great respect paid to the year 2234 B.C. by our writers of ancient history. It may be added here that this date has had a singular, if not



200 rre-Historic Nations.
unaccountable influence on the minds of some learned and
eminent archaeologists who have sought to comprehend and explain the Chaldean and Assyrian antiquities. Their aim has been to make everything in that part of Asia begin with this year 2234 B.C. That particular record of astronomical observations made in Chaldea, found at Baby
lon, and sent by Callisthenes to Aristotle, began with this date, therefore Chaldean history must begin with it ; no monument of that land must be more ancient ; the dynastic list of Berosus must not be allowed to reach farther back
into the past; we must reverently accept this date as the
chronological limit of human inquiry. Ix-ynnd which tin iv is nothing but thick darkness haunted by a few sluq
phantoms of fable. No hypothetical scheme of the ancii nt
history of Chaldea, that seeks honestly to comprehend the monuments and the list of Berosus, can be liable to such absurdities as have been occasioned by this infatuation in
regard to the year 2234 B.C. If Callisthenes could have discovered and sent to Greece tlu- records of astronomical observations made at the city of Belus, the more ancient Babylon of Greek tradition
(which in its ruins is called Nipur),the royal city of Chaldea in the great ages of Chaldean civilization, our studirs of antiquity would not be troubled by this infatuation.
Tin- city we know as Babylon was not important until the
closing period of the old kingdom of Chaldea. It i sumed as probable, rather than shown clearly, that it was, even in this period, a royal city; therefore to assume that the t-arliest date we have of the beginning of astronomical observations in that city is the oldest date in the hi
of the country is preposterous beyond expression. The great city of that old kingdom, the grand metropolis in the

ages that saw the highest condition of its civilization, learn
ing, and general culture, must have been the city whose ruins are called Nipur ; and the most brilliant age of this city must have been as far beyond the year 2234 B.C. as
this date is beyond the first Greek Olympiad ; and yet the beginning of astronomical observations at Nipur it
self was necessarily later than the beginning of the kingdom, for this was not one of the oldest cities of Chaldea.
As a royal city of the country, it seems to have been preceded by at least two others Ur and Erech. The Greeks tell us what the later Babylon was in the time of Nebuchadnezzar. They describe its marvelous ex
tent and magnificence when captured by Cyrus the Great. The Hebrew Scriptures describe the city. But Nebuchadnezzar was one monarch of a brief anc1 troubled dynasty of kings, whose whole time was only 87 years, and the first
of whom did not appear until the close of the Assyrian period, about 650 years after the old kingdom of Chaldea had ceased to exist. Neither history, nor anything discovered
in the ruins, tells us when this city of Babylon was founded. Stephanus of Byzantium, in his work on celebrated cities, indorsed the following statement of an older writer:
" Babylon was not built by Semiramis, as Herodotus says, but by Babilon, a wise man, and the son (or descendant) of the all-wise Belus ; and this Babilon lived, as Herinnius states, 2000 years before Semiramis." I cite this statement on account of its significance in one respect, which should
not escape attention. It assumes, as a matter of course, that the great antiquity of civilization in Chaldea was gen
erally recognised by those to whom it was addressed. For the rest, as Semiramis was supposed to have lived about
1250 years before Christ, this old record, if it should be ac

cepted as authentic, would show that Babylon was founded about 3250 B.C.
Could we have a complete copy of the Chaldean History
of Berosus, it would probably make clear many things now involved in obscurity. It might enable us to see when,
and under what circumstances, Nipur, the ancient city of Belus, was made the seat of government. It could hardly fail to explain the circumstances that interrupted the Chal
dean succession, and brought in the dynasty called " .Me
dian." We might or might not learn from that history that the more modern Babylon became the capital at the
beginning of the dynasty of 49 kings, not less than 2500 B.C. Meanwhile there is not a trace of evidence to show
or suggest that any king of Chaldea began to reign in the year 2234 B.C., or that anything Chaldean began with this date save the records found by Callisthenes.
CONCERNING AN OLD CHALDEAN TEMPLE.
One fact revealed by the cuneiform inscriptions awakens some sense of the great antiquity of Chaldea. The most
ancient royal name discovered is given doubtfully, M
Urukh, Urkham, or Orchamus. The inscriptions eelelrate. this king as a worshipper of Beltis and a builder of tem
ples. In the ages previous to his reign, when the great temple of Kreeh was built, that temple was consecrated to
the worship of Ana, and Ana was the {.residing deity of
the city. But time works changes. At length the worship of Ana in that temple was superseded by that of ln-1
tis, the temple still retaining, as one of its names, the appellation Bit-Ana, house of Ana, and in later inscriptions
1 nil is being called " the Lady of Bit-Ana," which continued
to show its original consecration. There is nothing to give



A Quotation from Ovid. 203
us the date of Urukh's reign ; but he was one of the great
kings of Ur, it is said, and therefore belonged to an early
period of the kingdom. That change in the temple worship at Erech must have taken place in his time, or at some
period previous to his reign; but it could not take place during the first day, or year, or century after the temple was built. Many ages of experience, thought, and change were undoubtedly required to make such a religious revolution possible; therefore it shows plainly that a very
long period in the history of Chaldea must have passed previous to the beginning of Urukh's reign. In connection with what the ruins say of this king, two lines are quoted
from Ovid's Metamorphoses (iv., 212, 213), in which an Orchamus is described as the seventh successor of Belus :
" Rexit Achaemenias urbes pater Orchamus, isque
Septimus a prisci numerate origine Beli. "
Is this a confused reference to the Orchamus, or IJrukh, whose name and something of whose history is shown us in the old ruins of Chaldea ? Very doubtful. Ovid's Met
amorphoses are not history, and it may be added that very queer results must have followed any attempts of that author to write history; but Ovid had some rare learning, and in early life he traveled in Asia. In his time there
were Asiatics, and some centuries previous to his time there were Greeks, who could have collected ample materials for a correct outline of the history of Chaldea previous to the rise of Babylon. The annals and archives of the
old kingdom were, to a great extent, still preserved in existing temples. In the third century before Christ, the temple of Belus at Babylon, partly in ruins, furnished such materials for that work of Berosus, which the Greeks and Romans allowed to perish.

ASSYRIA AND THE SEMITIC RACE.
The Assyrian empire began with the expulsion of the
Arabian dynasty from Babylon in 1273 B.C. A small king
dom of Assyria existed previous to this time. An Assyr
ian canon, found by Sir Henry Rawlinson, and also the canon of Ptolemy, carries back the history of Assyria to
the year 1650 B.C., which is 132 years previous to the Ara
bian invasion. The obvious explanation is, that " Assyria as an independent kingdom was the natural antecedent of
Assyria as an imperial power." In the earlier ages. Aftsyria was a province of the old Chaldean empire, governed by satraps, four of whose legends, bearing their names and
titles, have been found at Kileh-Shergat. The " Arabian"
dynasty doubtless represented princes of one of the separate kingdoms into which Arabia had become divided. Its
territory probably adjoined that of Babylonia. We may
suppose that Assyria Jed the movement by which the Ara
bians were expelled, and from this beginning went on to
become an empire. Babylonia was a province of the A syrian empire for 650 years, sometimes in rebellion, and
never held in very rigid subjection, its vassalage at limes being little more than nominal. Sennacherib's inscription
at Bavian shows that, in the year 1110 B.C., its princes waged successful war against Assyria, and defeated Tiglath-Pileser in a great battle.
It seems every way probable that Mesopotamia, and perhaps the whole region from Susa and Assyria to Syria, was occupied by uncivilized Semites when the Arabian Cush
ites first appeared there. They were very likely a nomad
ic people, divided into tribes, who yielded without a. strug
gle to the enterprising and powerful race that

them civilization. They were dispossessed, crowded into a few isolated communities, or incorporated with the inva
ders. Their language disappeared, to a great extent, before the Cushites from the south, and the Aryans from
Central Asia who came later, being preserved only in the
" Land of Asshur" and in some districts farther west. The Assyrian empire, which was great in extent and
very powerful during nearly seven centuries, wrought another change. It restored the Semitic language, creating
the Aramaic form of it. Rawlinson, speaking of the Cush
ite character and language of the old Chaldeans, says :
" It
can be proved from the inscriptions of the country that between the date of the first establishment of a Chaldean
kingdom and the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, the language of Lower Mesopotamia underwent an entire change." The
Cushite tongue disappeared, and the Aramaic took its place.
The influence of this Semitizing transformation proceeded
westward, encountering effective resistance only where it reached established communities of the Aryans. The marvelous vigor of the Cushite race was passing away ; the
Aryan race was becoming imperial, and preparing to fill the world with its influence.
A THEORY OF THE CHALDEANS.
I must not leave the Chaldeans without noticing a sin
gular theory touching their origin and character, which has found supporters, and is repeated in Ernest Kenan's work on the Semitic languages. This theory locates Ur of the Chaldees in the mountains of Kurdistan, and describes the Chaldeans as a tribe of bold and vigorous n&oun
taineers, who came into Babylonia as mercenary soldiers or favored immigrants used for protection, and speedily



206 Pre-Historic Nations.
rose to be an aristocratic class of" philosophers, naturalists,
or soothsayers, whose principal employment was the study of mathematics and astronomy." They were simply a caste in the nation, says this hypothesis, not the nation itself. Renan thinks the Chaldeans belonged to the Aryan race, and describes the Kurds as modern Chaldeans. See
his volume published in 1863, book first, chapter second. Those who begin history in that part of Asia with the
Assyrians, placing them at Babylon in the year 2234 B.C., very naturally find the Chaldeans involved in a mystery
difficult to explain. Their culture and knowledge were so superior to those of the Semites that they could not cease to furnish the foremost scholars and teachers even when
the political supremacy of Chaldea yielded to the Assyrian empire. Therefore, to those who have failed to see the
older nation they represented, they have seemed to be a
distinct class, a learned and powerful caste in the Baby
lonian or Assyrian nation of later times. Not aware of
the old kingdom of Chaldea, and eager to solve the mys
tery, they see nothing preposterous in this theory. To undertake a formal refutation of it cannot be necessary. In
the light of our present knowledge of Mesopotamiaii antiquity, it seems more like the production of a fantastic dream
t liaii the work of thoughtful inquiry. All antiquity shows us Chaldea and the Chaldeans in Lower Mesopotamia. The Hebrew Scriptures place "Ur of the Chaldees" in that region; and the ruins inform us that this city was situated on the Euphrates, near the Persian Gul
CONCERNING CHALDEAN ANCIENT HISTORY.
According to Berosus, there were 163 kings of Chaldea
previous to the year 1273 B.C., when the Assyrian empire



Chaldean Chronology. 207
rose and made that country one of its tributary provinces*
Eight of these kings formed a " Median" dynasty, which lasted 224 years ; and nine of them formed the Arabian dynasty, which ruled Chaldea 245 years. Now, if we allow
each of the remaining 146 kings a reign of twenty years, the whole time of all the dynasties will be 3389 years previous to 1273 B.C.; and the beginning of their time will
be placed in the year 4662 B.C., when Upper and Lower
Egypt flourished as separate and independent countries, Menes not yet having appeared to unite them. This esti
mate is moderate ; the average is below that of the " Me
dian" and " Arabian" dynasties of kings, whose number and time are both given. It will not be denied that, ac
cording to the testimony of Berosus, the 86 kings of the first dynasty represent a great period of very ancient history in Chaldea ; the Old Kingdom of the country, the firstages of national existence, of which he could give no his
tory. A complete copy of his Chaldean History might show that he had not only their names, but also a chro
nology of their time ; and perhaps it would explain what was meant by the cyclical additions which, included in
their time, extended it to 34,080 years. Bunsen finds the point of separation between the mythical and the earliest historical periods by deducting from
the 34,080 years the nine complete sari (astronomical cycles of 3600 years each). The remaining 1680 years he regards as the actual historical time of the 86 kings, to which the nine sari were prefixed. These 1680 years, being the
fragment of a sari, have no cyclical significance, and, therefore, cannot be any part of the cyclical contrivance. They
give the 86 kings an average of nearly twenty years each. It must be observed, however, that during the time of these



208 Pre-Historic Nations.
kings the Chaldeans computed by lunar years ; after the time of the "Median" dynasty they reckoned by solar
years. In dealing with a later period of Chaldean history, Bunsen's methods are less reasonable and his conclusions
much less satisfactory. Even Bunsen did not wholly es
cape the glamour of the year 2234 B.C. He saw clearly, and said strongly, that Chaldean civilization was much older than this date ; yet, unlike most other writers on Chaldean chronology, he constrained the "Median" dynas
ty to begin with it, and thus crowded the subsequent dynasties within still narrower limits. This has no warrant
of probability. It is inadmissible. Dismiss all this, strip
the year 2234 B.C. of its preposterous pretensions, and giye the later Chaldean dynasties such space in time as tin
number of kings on the list of Berosus so plainly demands,
and the beginning of the first dynasty cannot, on any
ground, reason, or probability, be placed later than 4500 B.C. We can see, in what Berosus says of the history of Chal
dea, that it was divided into two great periods, very dis
tinct from each other, and as completely M-p.iruted as tin
Old Monarchy and the Xew Monarchy of Kirypt. The first is the period of the 8G kings, which beiran with the
royal city at Ur, and was brought to a close alter the seat
of government had for a long time been at Xipur, by an invasion from abroad, which overthrew the government and established that "Median" dynasty. The next d
ty of eleven kings may have represented the princes of Susiana, elevated to supreme power by their successful lead
i-i ship in expelling the " Median" power. The second great
period of Chaldean history, the "Xew Monarchy ofChaldi-a," so to speak, may have begun with the dynasty .

kings. It was terminated by a powerful invasion of the
" Arabians," who ruled the country until the rise of the
empire of the Assyrians.
HYPOTHETICAL SCHEME OP CHALDEAN HISTORY.
A hypothetical scheme of the history of Chaldea, based on the list of Berosus and the results of modern research,
may serve to aid the mind in tentative efforts to realize and
reconstruct the past. Of course, it will not claim to be au
thentic history ; but it will have more to command respect, and be every way more credible than any scheme that
trifles with what is known by beginning the national exist
ence of Chaldea in the year 2234 B.C., with the city we
know as Babylon for the seat of government. Every reader will understand that the following scheme is hypothesis,
and judge of its probability for himself. 1. At the beginning of Chaldean national existence, and
in the first ages of the country, the royal city was Ur, or Hur. This city was then situated at the mouth of the Eu
phrates, but now, in its ruins, is a hundred and fifty miles above the mouth of that river, the Persian Gulf having been filled up to this extent by accumulations of alluvium.
During the previous colony and provincial times Ur had become a great commercial emporium a grand centre of
power. At this early period the more important cities and communities were at the south, between the rivers and in
Susiana. Ur very naturally became the political as well as the commercial metropolis, and must have remained so
for a long time, until the northern part of the country was
filled with inhabitants, and its relations with the interior countries of Asia became important. Ur may have contin
ued to be the royal city during some twenty-five reigns, or



210 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
until about 4150 B.C., when some great political change may have transferred the seat of government to Erech. 2. At Erech there may have been ten reigns, from 4150 to 3950 B.C. The names of two kings who reigned at Erech, one after the other, have been found in the ruins of that city. They were father and son. One of their names is given as Sin-shada ; the other has not been phonetically
rendered. We may reasonably conjecture that, for some
reason, to be explained only by circumstances of which we have no knowledge, Erech -was made the royal seat of a
dynasty to which these kings belonged. The period, after the seat of government left TTr and before it was estab
lished at Nipur, may have been unsettled and changeful, so far as relates to the ruling dynasty. There may have
been more than one change of dynasty during this period, and more than one royal city ; but, whatever may have been the political condition of the country at that time,
there came a great epoch of change and reconstruction, which established the seat of government at Xipur. The
personage called Nimrod in the Hebrew Scriptures, and
the " beginning" of whose kingdom " was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh," may have flourished at this time.
3. At Nipur, the city of Belus, we may suppose there
v.-i-re fifty-one kings, in several dynasties, previous to the "Median" invasion; that is to say, from 3950 to about 2950 B.C., a thousand years. In this period must have
been the great ages of Chaldean civilization, culture, and power. It was the period of the first eight or nine dynasties of the Old Monarchy of Egypt, when the civilization
of that country reached its grandest development. Other civilized countries of great importance must have been contemporary with the Chaldea of that period, not only in Ara



End of the Old Monarchy. 211
bia, Africa, and on the Mediterranean, but also in India, and
in the neighboring parts of Asia, where a people of the Aryan race, in very remote times, had a great kingdom, of which Balkh was the capital. Many of the Greek traditions con
cerning Chaldea, inherited probably from the older peoples whom they succeeded, must refer to this period, and to the great city, now called Nipur, still so remarkable in its ruins. About the year 2950 B.C. this old Chaldean monarchy was brought to a close, probably as other monarchies have
reached this fortune, after some ages of decline. The coun
try was invaded, the government was broken down, and the nation submitted to the sway of a dynasty of foreign kings described as "Median."
4. These " Median" rulers filled a period between ancient
Chaldea and the later kingdom, which is usually called Bab
ylonia, just as the Hyksos in Egypt filled the time between
the Old and the New Monarchies. Berosus says their do
minion lasted 224 years. It was still in existence long after all those were dead who had seen the time of the last native
king. There must have been differences, to some extent, between the later Babylonian Chaldea and that more an
cient kingdom. We cannot reasonably suppose that the Chaldean people, under the first king in the next dynasty
of native sovereigns, still used precisely the same form of
their language in which the latest annals of the old kingdom had been written. If the successful invaders did not
destroy the Chaldean books, and seek to obscure all recol
lections of the great history of the country, time and lin
guistic change must have so altered the current speech of the people that the old writings had become unreadable
to all save adepts at the beginning of that dynasty of 49
kings, which, there is some reason to believe, established



212 Pre-Historic Nations.
the scat of government at Babylon. There must have been
other changes that gave the period of these kings a dis
tinctive individuality ; it was the same people, but not the
same nation. Some writers, not finding a suggestion for any other hypothesis, have supposed the "Median" kings represented invaders from the north Turanians, Aryans,
or some other northern people. This ethnic term, supposed by some to be a corruption of the word used by BIT
was probably used by him to describe some branch of the
Arabian people, or some princely family of Arabia, who governed Chaldea under the sway of the celebrated Ara
bian conqueror, Zohak, as I have already explained. 5. The next dynasty of eleven kings, on the hypothecs of 20 years to each king, must have lasted 220 years, or from about 2726 to 2506 B.C. If it represented princes of Susiana, who led a rising of the people that overthrew and
expelled the "Median" power, the scat of government during the time of this dynasty must have been at Susa. The supposition that these eleven kings were Susianian princes
i< the most probable I can suggest. In the list ofBerosus, as we have it now, they are without ethnical or national
designation; but they stand by themselves, entirely separate from the preceding k - Mediant and the following 49
Chaldean sovereigns. We may, therefore, suppose they represent a distinct period of the transition from the downfall of the old Chaldean monarchy to the permanent establishment of the new monarchy under native Chaldean
princes, with the scat of government at the city known to
us as Babylon. 6. The 49 Chaldean kings on the list ofBerosus ar
s.x-iated with the second great period in the history of
Chaldea. An average of twenty years to each of these



Time of the later Kingdom. 213
kings gives 980 years ; and the time from 2506 B.C. to 1518 B.C., the year in which the rule of the Arabian dynasty
began, is 986 years. Berosus must have given a complete history of this period, for he himself states that the mate
rials for his work were the old archives and historical rec
ords deposited in the temple of Belus at Babylon, where annals had been written from age to age, and carefully preserved by the priests. He was one of the priests of that temple, and had unobstructed access to all these docu
ments. How could the Greeks receive his work with so
little attention, and allow it to perish ! During the time of these 49 kings, Babylon seems to have been the centre of a great commercial intercourse with Upper Asia, India, Arabia, and the countries on the Mediterranean. It became the metropolitan city of Southwestern Asia, and had in it a remarkable mixture of races and tongues Cushite,
Semitic, Aryan, Turanian, and others, perhaps in which most of their dialects and varying shades of difference were represented. Chaldca was still a grand and famous coun
try, eminent for its culture, wealth, and influence; but
finally the sceptre departed, and Chaldean supremacy was broken down by an invasion from Arabia.
7. The Arabian dynasty of nine kings lasted 245 years, from 1518 to 1273 B.C. During this time Assyria and Su
siana were probably separate and independent, though not
of great importance. An uncertain Greek tradition speaks of an Ethiopian prince, called Memnon, and described as son of a king of Susa, who is said to have led an army to
aid his uncle Priam in the Trojan War. Much more trust
worthy is the testimony of Sir Henry Rawlinson, that an Assyrian canon found by him carries back the independent
existence of Assyria to the year 1650 B.C. I have already



214: Pre-Historio Nations.
suggested that this second conquest of Chaldea was probably made by an Arabian sovereign known as Schamarlarasch, who is said to have extended his conquests far into Central Asia, and whose inscriptions at Samarcand are mentioned by certain Mahometan writers. I find no reason
to modify this suggestion, and have no doubt of its correctness.
The most probable explanation of the rise of Assyria, from the condition of a small kingdom to that of an extensive and powerful empire, is, that about 1273 B.C. the Arabian kings were dispossessed and driven out of Chaldea by a
revolutionary movement stimulated and support CM! by the
princes of that country. It is certain that the Aral*iar.>
were expelled at that time, and that there were great polit
ical changes which made Assyria an empire, and gave it control of that part of Asia for nearly seven centuries.
Those who may be disposed to accept this scheme for a hypothetical reconstruction of Chaldean history as sub
stantially warranted by probability, will very likely gest important modifications. The more they reflect ^\\
the subject, the more will they see that something like tins
general outline is required by what has been learned of tinantiquity and ancient condition of that country from Bero
sus, and by means of archaeological investigation. T!ie who may allow themselves to object, criticise, and discredit this scheme, should turn their attention more carefully
to the absurdities, incredible theories, audacious " emenda
tions" and " revisions" of facts, and unwarranted assump
tions which they must indorse if they reject it. The
scheme I have presented is more reasonable, and, I will add, much more truthful, than any arbitrary scheme that

INDIA, SANSKRIT AND ANTE-SANSKRIT.
THE Greeks and Romans described as India the whole
region beyond the Indus, including in it Hindustan, Burmah, Cochin China, Siam, and Malacca, with the islands of
the Indian Archipelago. Their knowledge of that region was very imperfect; but then, as in later times, it had strange power to enchant imagination, seeming to marvelous land of riches, magnificence, and everything rare and wondrous. Even in modern times, the influence of this enchantment has led some learned and enthusiastic
writers to describe India as the primal source of all knowl
edge and culture, the radiant morning-land of human civilization.
The name India, however, ia most commonly restricted
to the great peninsula known in our geographies as Hindustan ; and it is this land that has presented so much both
to incite the genius of romance and engage the attention
of scholars. It is separated into two great divisions by a
chain of mountains running east and west, called the Vind
hya Mountains. Strictly speaking, the northern division, including the vast and fertile valley of the Ganges, is Hindustan, the land of the Hindus; while the southern divis
ion is known as the Dakshin, the south country, a name which the English have transformed into Deccan. The conquests of Alexander the Great gave the Greeks some knowledge of the northern division of the country. At



India not chiefly Sanskrit. 217
that time its civilization was very old, and presented clear
indications of a long and important history.
We are accustomed to associate India with the Sanskrit race and the Brahmanical system of religion ; but this gives
a very imperfect knowledge of the country. The Sanskrit literature, the superior culture of the Brahmans, and the prominence of their race among the Indian peoples, have naturally drawn attention chiefly to the Hindus or IndoAryans ; and yet it may be doubted whether the unmixed Indo-Aryans were not always a small minority of the whole population of India. All over the country, at the north as well as in the south, there are communities and dialects that do not belong to the Sanskrit race. The people of this race were a long time in Northern India, and had a
long history there, before they attempted to establish themselves in the country south of the Vindhya Mountains j they have never at any time occupied the south country as
they occupied the Punjab and the .valley of the Ganges. The old race constitute the great majority of the population of the Dakshin as well as of many districts of North
ern India, and they still use dialects of a language radically different from the Sanskrit. The languages of Southern
India, called the Dravidian family, and the aboriginal dia
lects throughout Central India, cannot be classed in the same family with the Sanskrit. The old books of the Hindus recognise the two distinct races ; and they tell us that
the original Indo-Aryans were white, while the people they found in India were "dark-skinned." There are now no white Aryans in India save the English and other European residents. The original Sanskrit whiteness was mixed with the darker color of the native inhabitants long before
Alexander's timo.

THE IXDO-ARYAXS PEECEDED BY THE CUSHITES.
It can be seen distinctly in the antiquities of India, and in the religious ideas, customs, and symbols of the peoples who represent the oldest inhabitants, that when the IndoAryans entered that country, it had for a long time been occupied by the Arabian Cushites. There are strong reasons for believing that the Cushites found the country in
habited by a dark-colored race, similar, perhaps, to the .Malays, and to the people found on most of the islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. It was not the policy of the
Cushite race to exterminate peoples found in countries which they colonized and occupied. Their policy w;
conciliate, civilize, and absorb them. The present phv characteristics of the people of India indicate that they
pursued this policy in that country. Let me state some of the indications that they occupied India long before the
Indo-Aryan immigration. In the first place, it is in the highest degree probable that the Arabian Cushites occupied India. It is unreason
able to suppose otherwise. A great commercial, maritime, and colonizing people, sm-h n tin- old Arabians were in the remotest antiquity, could not fail to go as colonizers to India, and to many of the islands of the- Indian Ocean. It
was an ordinance of nature itself that any people controlling the navigation and commerce of that ocean should establish very close relations between India, Ceylon, Southeastern Africa, and Southern Arabia. It has been well observed that there are probably no other extensive and
separated regions on the globe where so many causes incite to a mutual commerce. While the older Greeks assoc: " the sacred wave and coraled bed of the Erythraean Sea"



Ancient Arabian Enterprise. 219
with the wonderful Ethiopians, there was neither trace nor
tradition of any other controlling maritime people in that part of the world. They must have occupied all those re
gions ; for it is undeniable that they had uninterrupted su
premacy on the Indian Ocean from time immemorial, from
ages away back in the deeps of antiquity, until the people of Western Europe found their way to India around the
Cape of Good Hope. Vincent, in his work on the Periplus of the ErythraBan Sea, without distinctly recognising ancient Arabia, found himself constrained to speak thus :
" The commerce of the Arabians has arrested our attention throughout the whole
progress of our inquiry, from the first mention of imports in Scripture to the accounts of the present day. Their
connection with the countries in their neighborhood is equally obvious. In the Indian Ocean they are found upon
every coast and upon almost every island." There may have been some older civilization than that of the Arabian
Cushites, from which they learned their skill in commerce and navigation ; but tradition does not go beyond them.
It followed, necessarily, that they occupied all desirable regions within their reach. Not only Ceylon, the Spice Isl
ands, and all other important islands in the Indian Ocean, but also the shores, southern districts, and central regions
of the continent. Ephorus stated expressly that " the
Ethiopians occupied all the southern coasts of both Asia and Africa ;" and this accords with the universal testimony
of ancient tradition.
In the second place, the ancient occupation of India by the Arabian Cushites is seen in the revelations of linguistic
and archaeological research ; in the religious ideas, customs, and symbols found there ; in remains of the oldest architcc



220 Pre-Historic Nations.
ture ; in all the antiquities of the country ; and even in remains of ancient municipal organizations that seem to have been peculiar to the Cushite race.
Professor Rawlinson, in his work on Herodotus, book i.,
Essay il, says :
" Recent linguistic discovery tends to show that a Cushite or Ethiopian race did, in the earliest times, extend itself along the shores of the Southern Ocean from
Abyssinia to India. The whole peninsula of India was peopled by a race of this character before the influx of the
Aryans ; it extended along the sea-coast through the modern Beluchistan andKerman; the cities on the northern shores of the Persian Gulf are shown by the brick inscrip
tions found in their ruins to have belonged to this race."
Archaeological exploration and research in the East is un
veiling the past, and careful inquirers are gradually getting eyes to see it.
Thp ancient people of Arabia doubtless went first to In
dia by sea, for they were adventurous navigators and traders, who traveled more by sea than by land. Professor Rawlinson is one of the scholars who misunderstand Ara
bia, lie seeks in Africa that Ethiopia from which proceeded such mighty streams of colonization ; but he has learned
to see the ancient Cushite occupation of India. Heeren.
who tailed to discover the original Ethiopia, maintained,
nevertheless, that " a very ancient connection existed between India and Arabia, and between India and the oppo
site coast of Africa, which was dependent on Arabian princes;" and also that "from time immemorial the Arabians bad monopolized the carrying trade of the Indian Ocean/'
Investigation has brought to light traces of the C'ushite religion in every part of India. Their significance was pointed out by Signer Gorresio, who edited and translated

the Ramayann. Tie believed the ante-Sanskrit people of
Southern India to be of " Hamitic origin ;" and, in proof of this, he cited the fact that their religious symbols and
devices are serpents, dragons, and the like, all peculiar to the ancient Hamitic or Cushite religion ; and that the god
they prefer to all others, and whom they especially honor
in their sacrifices, is " the terrible Rudra or Siva," certainly a Cushite divinity, called by the Cushites Baal, and by oth
er names. Siva is not a Vedic god. He did not belong
to the religious system of the Indo-Aryans ; but he was a great divinity of the older people of the country ; and the later Brahmanism, seeking to absorb everything that could give it strength and influence, adopted him, and introduced him into its system by means of a conveniently invented avatar. Siva is not mentioned in the Rig-Veda. The legend of Daksha, in the Vishnu Purana, shows that he did not originally belong to the Brahmanical system, and makes him
say, " My priests worship me in the sacrifice of true wis
dom where no officiating Brahman is needed." Rev. Dr. Stevenson has published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, and in the Journal of the Bombay Branch of
that society, several papers on the religious peculiarities
of the Dekhan. He discusses this point, and urges, on the
strongest grounds, that neither Siva nor the Phallus wor
ship, of which traces are so prevalent in India, came into that country with the Aryan race. They existed there
long before the Aryan immigration. He says :
" The Lingayats are well known to have a bitter hatred towards the Brahmans, to neglect Brahmanical rules about
purification for dead bodies, etc., and to have priests of their own called jangams. On the other hand, the Brah

mans call them Pakhandt, or adherents to a false religion.
And although Acharya, or whoever established that com
promise of sects called the worship of Panchaitana, or the five principal divinities, has admitted Mahadeva (Siva), under the form of the Linga, into the number, still the person
who attends to dress this image is not, as is the case with all the rest, a Brahman, but a Sudra of the caste Gurava." The intense and exclusive fanaticism of the early IndoAryans described the old inhabitants of the country, with
their different religion, as Dasyus, Rakshasas, fiendish creatures, demons, and monsters. Rakshasas was a constant
appellation for the people south of the VindhyaMountains. Dr. Stevenson says: "I observe in Tumour's documents relative to the religion of Ceylon that the whole of that island was overrun with devil and serpent worship previous to the arrival of Buddha ; and I think analogy may lead us to conclude* that the same was the case in India be
fore the arrival of the Brahmans." To the ancient Hindus,
Ceylon was a land of very terrible Rakshasas. The " devils" and "demons" of the Buddhists are easily understood.
The serpent worship is full of significance : this was a great feature of the old religion of the Cushites; but the word
"serpent" will convey a very poor notion of its meaning to those who do not understand what it was. The serpent
was regarded as a symbol of intelligence, of immortality, of protection against the power of evil spirits, and of a n newal of life or of the healing powers in nature. It is evident that Brahmanism was never established in Ceylon. The people of that island retained their old religion until they were converted by disciples of Buddha. In the same spirit and to the same effect is the statement of Fa-hian, a Chinese Buddhist who traveled in India, where he speaks



The Worship of Vetal.

of Ceylon as " originally inhabited by demons, genii, and dragons, who had, nevertheless, a taste for commerce, and in time became civilized."
Dr. Stevenson describes the festival of Holi, or " the worship of Holika Devata," and says it has a close resemblance
to the English festival of the May-pole, which originated in a religious ceremony or festival of the Cushites (called
Phoenicians) who anciently occupied Western Europe. As cairns, like those in Western Europe and in other Cushite
countries, are abundant in the Dekhan, we may suppose the cairn fires also were formerly known there. Dr. Stevenson and several other writers have described
the "worship of Vetal," which still exists in the Dekhan, in which traces of the old Cushites are very plain. It is remarked that Vetal has no image in the shape of any creature whatever ; therefore his worship must have been
introduced " previous to the custom of likening the gods to men and animals." Vetal has no temple, but is worshipped in the open air, generally under the shade of a wide
spreading tree. " This circumstance connects his worship
with that of the Canaanites, who, in the time of Moses, had
no temples." The place where Vetal is worshipped is a kind of lesser Stonehenge. It is a stone circle, or inclosure
of stones, generally circular in form, varying from fifteen to forty feet in diameter. This antique worship is not con
fined to the south of India ; it is found in Konkan, Kanara,
Gujerat, Cutch, and other districts. The Brahmans call Vetal a demon ; he neither belongs to their Pantheon nor
requires their services. The old Keltic Druids, probably, would have seen in him something very different from a demon. The great resemblance of certain customs common to

Leslie, as will be seen in his work on the " Early Races of Scotland." It is manifest to those who have studied the subject closely, that both modern Brahmanism and modern Buddhism (for Buddhism is much older than the Buddha ot the Ceylonese records) have absorbed many elements
of the old Cushite religion. We may suspect, although we have no historical records to show, that the most am-iuit
form of Buddhism began the first development of its distinctive peculiarities under some influence of the Cushite faith. Mr. James Bird, in his work on "The Buddha au<l
Jaina Religions," speaks on this subject as follows :
" The more intimately we become acquainted with the
principles of the Buddha religion, the stronger will be our conviction that such principles have their origin in physical
and metaphysical opinions, made applicable to explain the phenomena of the world and of human nature; and that such opinions were closely connected with the worship of the heavenly bodies and the Sabean idolatry. This Saba
ism, too, instead of being ingrafted on the Buddha system, appears to have preceded it, and to have been the source from whence it sprung."
The earliest religion of India of which we have any trace'
is planet worship, with its usual symbols and ci-remonii's. The remains of its influence are found everywhere. In
Ceylon and Southern India, the Bali means planet worship. The stone circles and Cyclopean fanes mean this. Its symbols are abundant in the rock temples. It used no idols in its purest form, but inculcated adoration of "the h<t
of heaven." In Ferishta's Introduction to his u Mahomedan
India," he tells us that before idols were used by the peo

pie of India in their worship, they, " like the Persians, wor
shipped the sun and the stars." On this the translator has
the following note : "There appears every day stronger reason to believe that the worship of the Bull, the Linga, and the Yoni is the same as the Phallic worship of Egypt, and as that of the calf and the pillar, emblematic of Baal or the sun, by
the nations surrounding the Israelites ; that this worship was founded originally on Sabaism ; and that the emblems
are types of fructification. Abundant proof exists in India
of the antiquity of Tauric and Phallic worship over that
of idolatry and demi-god heroes. All the temples of thb latter are modern compared with those dedicated to Mahadeva," that is, Baal, called Siva by the Brahmans. I must class with the Cushite antiquities of India the lo
cal municipalities still existing in many parts of the country. They remind us of similar organizations left by that race in all the countries they occupied. These remarkable municipalities were noticed by Arrian and other Greek writers who followed Megasthenes. Attention is called to
them in Elphinstone's History; and Sir Charles Metcalf described them as follows :
" The village communities are
little republics, having everything they want within themselves, and almost independent of any foreign relations. They seem to last where nothing else lasts. Dynasty aftei dynasty tumbles ; revolution succeeds to revolution ; Hii>
du, Patan, Mogul, Mahratta, Sikh, English, are all masters in turn, but the village communities remain the same."
An article in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1865, after citing what was said of them by Diodorus Sic
ulus, Arrian, and Quintus Curtius, says :
" There are no
data to determine the exact form of these constitutions,

though they are seen to have been far beyond any mere intramural municipality. The city clearly dominated over
the country around, and constituted, to all intents and purposes, a state." This was the Cushite method in Arabia,
in Phoenicia, in Northern Africa, in Spain, in their settlements all around the Mediterranean. These municipal or
ganizations were not originated by Brahmanism ; they are foreign to its spirit, by which they have been modified and
mutilated, but not entirely extirpated. The Sanskrit race found them in India, and they must be classed with the
oldest antiquities of the country. But there are other antiquities in India which reveal the
Cushite occupation. It would now be preposterous for any one familiar with the subject to deny that the remains
of a civilized people who preceded the Indo-Aryans in every part of the Indian Peninsula. The actual state
of the case is presented by Lieut. General Briggs, in a pa
per on "The Aboriginal Race of India," published in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society for 1852, as follows : "There an' incontestable proofs of the aboriginal race
having once occupied every part of India; and that, ere the Hindus came among them, they had made sufhYient
progress in civilization to form large communities, estab? lish kingdoms, and become merchants and extensive' cultivators of the soil. There are distinct remains of old
ties, extensive excavations, and other monumental ruins. Several of their principalities have continued to the present day ; and history has transmitted to us, from the earliest period of which any authentic record ional
proofs of the power this race once possessed." The writer goes, on the wings of fancy, to the Scylhs iii:d Tatars for the origin of this aboriginal race. The char

acter of these antiquities very plainly suggest a much more
probable hypothesis. Professor Benfey finds " the whole Dekhan covered with remains of a nation of which, it is
highly probable, the several parts were connected by affin
ity," and says, " we know with certainty" that this nation
preceded the Sanskrit-speaking people. These remains of an ante-Sanskrit race in India consist
of ancient temples which Europeans call pagodas, Cyclopean excavations in mountains of rock, Cyclopean fanes, barrows containing human remains, cells formed of large
slabs, stone circles, cairns of every kind, cromlechs, dolmens, and many other antiquities of the same class all similar
to those found in Arabia, Syria, Phoenicia, Northern Africa, and the western and southern countries of Europe. In presence of these remains, it is unreasonable to talk of
Scyths and Tatars. They show plainly the race to which they belong. Their character and significance cannot be mistaken when carefully studied and fairly understood. Such monuments could not be found in India if the Arabian Cushites had not gone there in very remote times, oc
cupied the country, and filled it with the influence of their
religion and their civilization. Lieut. Col. Forbes Leslie describes and discusses such antiquities of the Dekhan as appear to him incontestably the same in character and
origin as those of Syria and Western Europe. He points out clearly that these monuments in the Dekhan appear
" in all the varied forms in which they are to be found in
France and Britain," and in all the countries where the influence of the Arabian Cushites was established an influ
ence which he does not appear to comprehend. He says :
"It will not be disputed that the primitive Cyclopean monuments of the Dekhan were erected prior to the arrival of the present dominant race, the Hindus."



228 Pre-Historic Nations.
THE ROCK-CUT TEMPLES OF INDIA.
The marvelous and long-deserted temples, formed by excavating mountains of rock, must be considered by them
selves. Heeren, admitting that Arabian colonies may have been established on the coasts of Hindustan in very early times, allowed himself to make this very singular observa
tion : " And yet, up to the present time, no traces,! believe, of Arabian architecture have been discovered in India sim
ilar to those found in many parts of Spain." What have the old Adite Ethiopians to do with the Saracens of Spain, from whom they were so distant in time, and so different
in religion and civilization ? Nothing whatever. But Heeren did not know that Arabia itself has ruins which show
nothing in common with the Saracenic style of archictect
ure. The Cushite Arabians left, throughout India, some wonderful specimens of their architecture ; not Saracenic in
style certainly, but remarkably characteristic of their own
spirit and civilization. The rock-cut temples at Elephant a, Salsette or Kanaria, Ellora, Ajunta, and elsewhere in the
Indian peninsula, together with many of the old temples called pagodas, show their style, and remind us of similar structures of that race in other regions. Both pen and pencil have described them so often that I need not here
attempt another elaborate description. Niebuhr was the first, in modern times, to call attention to these architectural excavations ; but his personal observations were confined to Elephanta, where is found one of
these rock-temples a hundred and thirty feet deep by about a hundred and twenty-three feet wide, exclusive of the va
rious rooms attached. The roof is supported by twenty

six pillars and sixteen pilasters. The walls were once cov
ered with a beautiful stucco ; if they ever had inscriptions,
these have entirely disappeared. In the neighboring island of Salsette, or Kanaria, a mountain of rock is excavated in every direction. Some of the finest of these rock-temples are at Ellora, in Central India, where a semicircular range of rock mountain contains a series of them, more carefully finished and ornamented than those at Elephanta and Salsette. The rock excavated at Elephanta is described as
clay porphyry, so hard that no ordinary steel can work it. It must have been worked by means of the celebrated In
dia steel called wudz. These wonderful structures are found in many other localities. The ruins at Mavalipura show the remains of a
city that was chiefly hewn out of solid rock. A consider
able portion of these ruins has sunk into the sea. There are remains of heavy walls, built of immense blocks of
stone piled one above another, after the style called Cyclopean. These excavations must be very ancient. That they belong to a remote antiquity is shown by the fact that there is in India no record or recollection of their origin. They may have been changed and reconstructed in some respects, from age to age, until they were disused ; but
they are very ancient, and owe their origin to that race whose traces are everywhere unmistakable. To the same race must be attributed the origin of the
pyramidal temples of Cyclopean construction called pagodas, the walls of which were made of immense blocks of
stone placed together in the usual style of this method of building. All these old structures remind us of similar remains of remote antiquity found in Arabia, Syria, Phosni
cia, Greece, Italy, Sicily, Egypt, and the Upper Nile valley.



23(1 Pre-Historic
Rock excavations are nowhere else so extensive as in India ; but similar rock architecture and Cyclopean constructions found in the other countries are in the same style, and show unmistakable traces of the same hand. The most
ancient architects of Calabria, Mycense, Petra, Ruad, Marathos, Nubia, and India all learned in the same school.
Some writers on these architectural remains have sought to deny their claim to antiquity, not because they have
good or even plausible reasons for doing so, but chiefly through the influence of that amazing chronological lunacy which aims so obstinately to obscure the past, and begin
the history of civilization with an age comparatively modern. One writer, whose pretensions as an architect are not
supported by respectable qualifications for archreological inquiry, affirms, with great confidence in his own opinion, that the structures at Mavalipura were built just previous to the year 1300 A.D. Others have maintained that none of these rock-temples can be older than the ninth century
of the Christian Era. We have historical evidence that
shows the falseness of these representations. Near the beginning of the Christian Era, envoys weiv
sent to the Roman emperor Antoninus by a king of one of the Indian countries. In the fragment of a lost work of
Porphyry, preserved in the 10th Eclogue of Stobaeus, a statement of Bardcsanes is quoted as follows: "The In
dian messengers report that there is in India a large grotto, under a lofty hill, in which is to be seen an image from ten to twelve ells high, with arms folded across the breast, the right side being man and the left side woman." This ap
pears to be a description of the image of Siva in the rock
temple at Elephanta ; and, at that time, evidently it v completely deserted, unused, and mysterious as it is



Early mention of Rock- Temples. 231
Bardesanes was born about the middle of the second century, and the rock-temple mentioned must have been de
scribed by the Indian messengers, or envoys, previous to the year 200 A.*D.
By general consent of geographical writers, Mavalipura, the rock city on the Coromandel coast, has been identi
fied with the Maliarpha located there by Ptolemy, and by him described as a commercial emporium. Ptolemy was older than Bardesanes. His geography, however, was a revision of an older work by Marinus of Tyre ; and there is
no good reason to doubt that, in locating the city he calls
Maliarpha, he depended entirely on Phoanician geographers, who had given this city the same location at a much earlier date than could be claimed for the geography of Ma
rinus itself. At any rate, here is evidence that the city of
Mavalipura existed more than 1100 years previous to the time when certain writers say it was built ; and that the
rock-temple at Elephants was forsaken and incomprehensible at least 700 years previous to the earliest date that can be allowed for the oldest of these structures by some writers who speak on the subject with that tone of assurance
which belongs only to positive knowledge. It is surprising that anybody should deny the great antiquity of these works in presence of so many indications
of their age, with tradition either standing speechless or
muttering nonsense to show its inability to explain them. Their origin could not be so completely forgotten if they did not belong to ages previous to the Aryan immigration.
Maurice, in his " Indian Antiquities," says very justly :
" One would have supposed that the construction of such
astonishing works, which have been called the eighth wonder of the world, would have fixed in any country an era



232 Pre-Historic Nations.
never to be forgotten." He is sure they belong to the re
motest antiquity, and that " a species of worship totally different from that now prevailing in India was anciently practiced in these caverns." They are now deserted. The people of the country cannot tell when or why they were deserted. Some of them, if not all, were in the same con
dition 1700 years ago, when, to the Indian messengers, natives of the country, the rock-temple they described was
merely " a grotto," with a big image in it ; for if it had then
been used for temple worship, their description could not have failed to say so.
It is preposterous to talk of these structures as no older than the ninth or tenth century of the Christian Era. At that period such constructions were no longer possible- in India, even if their style of architecture had still been current. The great days of the Sanskrit race had gone by, and new influences were preparing to take possession of
the country. In the year 637 A.D., during the califate of Omar, the crusading Mahometans began their invasion of
India by sending a fleet from Oman to the Malabar coast. Not much was effected ; but in the year 696, a Mahometan
army, led by " Muhammed, son of Cassem," occupied the valley of the Indus, overturned a powerful Indian kingdom,
and penetrated as far as the country of the Kajputs. Xo one familiar with the history of India from this date to the reign of the great Akbar can allow himself to a i-n the-e marvelous works to any age within the period in question.
The only semblance of argument against the great antiquity claimed for these structures comes from an assumption that they represent some of the later forms of Hindu
worship, especially that of the Buddhists. In nearly all
the rock-temples there are sculptured figures, reliefs, and

decorations that are assumed to represent their original
consecration; but the interpreters of these images and decorations do not agree in their conclusions, nor have
they attempted to show that the images and symbolical devices are all as old as the temples. Most of the inter
pretations have been the work of fanciful conjecture. It has been confidently asserted that the temple at Salsette was a Buddhist temple ; but close and careful examination
shows that, it was certainly a temple of Siva or Baal, for the Linga and Yoni appear everywhere in its interior recesses. Lieut. Col. Sykes, who has given much attention
to the rock-temples, says :
" There is not anywhere a rocktemple excavation dedicated to Brahma or Vishnu ;" and
" Siva is the only god to whom honor is done at Ellora."
[See vol. v. of the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society.] Some of these temples may have been used by the Buddh
ists during the time of their supremacy, and for this pur
pose they may have been changed in some respects. The inscriptions found in them are much later than the beginning of the Buddhist period. Scholars who have studied
these antiquities %dmit that "the larger inscriptions at Ajunta may be long posterior to the excavations." [See Bombay Journal, vol. ii.] Similar constructions in Nubia have bas-reliefs and other decorations in the highest style of old Egyptian art, while the architecture of the original
structures is entirely diiferent. Rameses the Great found
them existing as mysterious antiquities in his time, and used them to display his devices and record his glories as a conquering hero ; but neither there nor in India is the
vast antiquity of these structures in any way affected by
the later addition of inscriptions, decorations, or images. The supposition that the Buddhists originated these rock



23^ Pre-Historie Nations.
temples is made highly improbable, and therefore inadmis
sible, by several facts that appear against it. 1. In the first place, these structures appear to have been
in existence long before the Buddhism of Sakhya-Muni be
came the established religion of Magadha. They existed at the time of his death. The Buddhist books give an account of three great convocations of his disciples. The
first was convened by his favorite disciple Ananda immediately after his death. The Journal of the Royal Asiatic
Society [vol. vi., p. 303] has the following statement con
cerning it :
" The Chinese work, the Foufa-thsanfj-ynanJcing, contains the following remarkable notice respecting
Ananda :
' After the death of Buddha, he collected 500
pious men in the CAVERN of Pi-pho-lo [the tree of Photi], and jointly with them collected the Vinayas.' Of Kassaj >o, another of Buddha's disciples, the same work says :
' He
collected a great assembly in the CAVERN of Pi-ho-lo and in other places, and arranged the Abidharmas.' From these passages it appears that cavern-excavations must
have been contemporary with, or even prior to, Buddha
[Sakhya]." 2. In the second place, these excavations are most nu
merous, in India, away from the region on the Ganges that
was the birthplace and immediate home of Buddhism. A note in the volume of the Asiatic Journal just quoted takes notice of this fact as follows: "The remains of Buddhism in the Dekhan are even more magnificent and extensive than in its native seats on the Ganges. The cave-excavations are well known as wonderful monuments of art."
Buddhism was never very extensively influential in the Dekhan, and in many districts its influence wa< scarcely
felt. Iliiian-Thsang, a Chinese Biuldliu-t who visite^l India



Buddhism and these Temples. 235
in the beginning of the seventh century, tells us what he
saw in the Dekhan. In Kalinga, he says, " there were few of the orthodox and many heretics ;" but there were rock
temples. In the same part of the country he passed through
a small state " where a peculiar language was spoken and Buddhism was not practiced." In another district, where
the people were " black and savage," he notices " an excavated mountain ;" if it had been used as a Buddhist tem
ple he would have said so. It seems apparent that these rock-temples, which were not coincident with the established domination of Buddhism, and do not anywhere measure the extent of its influence, must have existed long pre
vious to the time of Sakhya-Muni, and had their origin
in something entirely independent of his religion. The Buddhists may have used them and perhaps remodeled some of them, but they did not originate them. 3. In the third place, the Siva-worship, to which these
rock-temples were mainly devoted, had but little in common with Sakhya-Muni's type of Buddhism, w^hich became the state religion of Magadha ; therefore this state relig
ion could not have originated these Saivite excavations. Eugene Burnouf was sure that nothing in the teaching of Sakhya could have produced the Saivite Tantras of the
Nepaulese collection of Buddhist Scriptures. It is equally certain that nothing in his religion can be held responsible for the Saivite rock-temples ; and it was only in behalf of
such Buddhism as he and his disciples preached that the
power and resources of Magadha were engaged ; therefore no other school or sect of Buddhists and, certainly, no one so different from his as that of the Saivas, which had
most in common with the old religion of the country could have had means to accomplish such stupendous

works. They were originated in times more ancient, by another race, for the uses of that older system of religion of which Hindu Saivism was born. Buddhists of all sects may have used them ; but the history of Buddhism has nothing to explain their origin, or to account for their pe
culiar and very significant style of architecture.
No part of India has more abundant traces of the old Cushite occupation than Ceylon. In addition to rock-temples, traditions of the ancient Bali and serpent-worship,
Cyclopean fanes, and other antiquities of the same cla>s, it has immense and very remarkable structures called tanks, which have been well described by Governor Ward in the 27th volume of the Journal of the Royal Geographical Society. After giving some account of the ruins of two great cities, and pointing out that the east side of the
island was anciently occupied by a very numerous and in
telligent population, he says :
" All we know positively, or can collect from ancient records, is that there must once have been a large population on the west side of the island, in the neighborhood of .Alanaar and Aripo; that the causes which prompted the selection of this barren coast for a commercial emporium
probably determined the choice of Anaradhspnra as the
seat of government ; that other causes, equally obscuiv t<
us, forced back this teeming population (leaving everywhere traces of its industry and skill) to the neighborhood of Pollinarua, where its second capital was founded; that this second capital, like the first, is now a wilderness ; and
that nothing remains to bespeak its ancient magnificence save the long line of tanks that unite it with Tamble^am Bay and Trincomalee."
These tanks are artificial lakes of great size (some of



The Tanks in Ceylon. 237
them over twenty miles in circumference) formed between
hills by embankments of wonderful masonry " that seems to defy the hand of time." They were agencies of a vast
system of irrigation ; but " there is no visible outlet at the point from which the stream issues, yet the stream is per
ennial. * * * No doubt the run of water is regulated by
those ancient sluices, placed in the bed of the lakes, which
answered the purpose so admirably, although modern engineers cannot explain their action." The ruins of similar tanks are found in Arabia and Southern India. Wrede found such ruins in the Arabian valley of the Doan ; and
Arnaud has described the ruins of the celebrated " dike" or tank near the ancient city of Saba. The tanks of Ceylon may not be as old as most of the other Cyclopean an
tiquities of India ; some of them may be comparatively modern, that is to say, not much older than the Christian
Era ; but they belong to a class of structures that must
have been originated by the Arabian Cushites. Maurice,
in his " Ancient History of Hindustan," speaks of these an
tiquities as follows :
"At that period, when the daring Cushite genius was
in its full career of glory, it was the peculiar delight of
that enterprising race to erect stupendous edifices, excavate long subterranean passages in the living rock, form vast lakes, and extend over the hollow of adjoining moun
tains magnificent arches for aqueducts and bridges. * * * It was they who built the tower of Belus and raised the pyramids of Egypt ; it was they who formed the grottoes near the Nile, and scooped the caverns of Salsette and Ele
phanta. Their skill in mechanical powers to this day astonishes posterity, who are unable to conceive by what

and from twelve to twenty feet in breadth [and depth], could ever be raised to that wonderful point of elevation at which they are seen in the ruined temples at Balbec and Thebais. Those composing the pagodas of India are
scarcely less wonderful in magnitude and elevation." [Vol.
ii.,p. 241-2.]
THE DRAVIDIAX RACE AXD THEIR LANGUAGE.
The fact that languages exist in India radically different from that of the Indo-Aryans, and that these langu
represent the aboriginal speech of the country, was admitted and discussed by the old Sanskrit writ ITS tl Mr.Muir has taken some pains to show this in his*' krit Texts." The native writers apply the term Desi to
this aboriginal tongue, and point out that, to a greater or lesser extent, it enters into all the existing dialects or lan
guages of the peninsula. At the north the influence of Sanskrit has been much greater than at the south, but the
old language is largely present in all the northern dialects, "especially among the lower orders of the people, and in the business of Common life;" and it is admitted to be the oldest clement in these dialects. In the south tl;
speech is represented by a family of cultivated langi; spoken, says Rev. Dr. Caldwell, in his Comparative (J rammar, by thirty-one millions of people, not including the numerous uncultivated "hill tribes" and retired communit'u s
of Central India, who use dialects closely related to this
family. It is admitted by Lassen, and by all others who
have given them any attention, that these language fundamentally different from the Sanskrit, and that "their
grammatical forms and primary words cannot by an; sibility have been drawn from that source."



The Dravidian Languages. 239
The five cultivated languages classed as the Dravidian
family are used by peoples occupying the most southern part of India. They are the Tamil, spoken by people occupying the extreme southeastern extremity of the peninsula and nearly the whole of Ceylon ; the Telug.u, or Telinga, used in a larger region north of the Tamil people ; the
Karnatika, or Carnarese, spoken in the interior region west of the Tamil and Telugu ; the Malayalam, or Malabar tongue, found in a narrow district on the western coast, extending north from Cape Comorin ; and the Turn, in a
smaller territory north of the Malayalam. Linguistic scholars have not studied these languages
closely. Not much is known of them beyond the information furnished by Dr. CaldwelPs excellent Comparative
Grammar of the Dravidian Languages, and Mr. A.D. Camp
bell's Telugu Grammar, with the accompanying note or es
say of Mr. Ellis. No very profound study is required to see their radical unlikencss to the Sanskrit. Linguistic
investigation has not yet authorized us to go beyond this ;
and, for the present, we must be content to see that this
Dravidian speech, so far as relates to its distinctive charac
ter, must, like the Cyclopean remains of the more ancient race, be classed with the ante-Sanskrit Antiquities of India,
They belong together, and whatever explains the one will explain the other.
Dr. Stevenson, in the Bombay Journal for April, 1842, describes the Tudas, the chief tribe of the Nilgiri Hills, and
says :
" The language of the Tudas is a sixth Indian penin
sula language. All these languages have but one origin ; an intimate relation in grammatical construction and voca
bles runs through them all." He finds that the language of the other hill tribes has a strong resemblance to that of



240 Pre-Historic Nations.
the Tudas. It is known, also, that a form of speech closely related to the Dravidian family is used by certain peoples in Beluchistan. Dr. Stevenson calls attention to one
peculiarity of these languages that has some significance.
He says the word " Mag," son, is used in personal appellations as the term "Mac," son, is used in Gaelic, and adds,
" Surely, after this, the M'Phersons and M'Gregors of our Highland glens need not hesitate to claim as Scotch cousins the inhabitants of the Indian peninsula." There is more in this than he saw. The African Berbers use this term
"Mac" in the same way. Mr. Urquhart takes notice of this
fact in his " Pillars of Hercules," and infers from it an an
cient relationship between the Berbers and the Scotch High
landers. The Sanskrit is not now represented in India by any
spoken tongue, as the more ancient speech is represented by these Dravidian languages. Its influence is seen every
where; its words are found in all the vocabularies; some of the dialects grew up under its direct influence, and are
supposed to have proceeded from it, but their formation was so powerfully influenced l>y the old languagi' that the Desi element appears in them as an essential part of their
structure. What scholars represented by the Bombay Journal have said of the Desi element of the Mahratti cannot be said of the Sanskrit element of any existing dialect,
namely, that it is more used " among the lower orders of tin- people, and in the business of common life," than any other element. Between the Mahratti, the Hindi, the Ben
gali, and the (iu/erati there is a close relationship. They
come chiefly from the Sanskrit through intervening tongues called Prakrits, or" derived," which, through the continued use of Sanskrit as a literary language, were left almost

wholly unwritten. Only one of them, the Pali, or language of Magahda, the birth-place of Buddhism, has been preserved in a distinct literature. These Prakrits doubtless grew up in mixed communities
at the north, composed of the Sanskrit-speaking people and that portion of the aboriginal population that had come under their control. Thus, for the uses of common life,
there came into existence, in presence of the literary Sanskrit, new forms of speech, in which the tongues of the two
different peoples were assimilated, and, to a greater or lesser degree, amalgamated. This is not the history of the
Dravidian languages. The primeval mother of the Dravidian languages, and of the Desi element throughout India, was much more ancient
than the Rig-Veda quite as old, probably, as* the original source of the whole Aryan family. It may have been a
composite language, formed by a fusion of the speech of the ante-Sanskrit civilizers with that of the ruder aborigines
found in the country. If as I believe, and as the antiquities of the country so clearly show these ante-Sanskrit civilizers were Cushites from Arabia, the primal source of the Dravidian or Desi speech must have been a very ancient form of the Cushite tongue, modified by amalgama
tion with the speech of the aborigines, or by such use as was made of it in the communities created by the civilizing
influence of the Cushites. Through how many changes
and successive linguistic forms the Dravidian languages came down from that original source cannot be told, nor
is it possible to know how many successive dialects and
family branches of that old tongue appeared, flourished,
and perished during the many ages of that long period.
These languages have been taken in hand by the " Scyth

iun" infatuation, but without success. The old language
of Arabia has sometimes been called " Scythian" and " Turanian." It would be pleasant to see those who have been carried away by this infatuation undertake to define clear
ly what is meant by the " Scythian family," and write com
parative grammars of the " Scythian" languages. The
truth is, these terms, " Scythian" and " Turanian," represent, in great measure, a mysterious limbo that symbolizes the mythical Babel, and into which are crowded, with a few
things that are partially understood, all the vague, uncom
prehended, and doubtful peoples and tongues that linguist
ic science is not yet qualified to explain and classify. The Dravidian languages are too little known to com
parative philologists, and linguistic studies are too little advanced in this direction to allow any scholar to place
them in any other family with conclusive reasons for doing so. The first civilizers found in India a dark-colored race.
The " Scythians" may claim the original speech of this race if they will. I shall not attempt to discredit their claim,
for it will be amusing to see them support the right of that
primeval tongue to a place in the "Scythian family." No doubt it belongs there. But the languages of the Dravidian family must for the present be allowed to stand
by themselves. Probably the most competent linguist itscholar, if profoundly versed in the Dravidian tongues, and furnished with all possible aid to inquiry, might find it im
possible to class them with any other family. With a
composite language for their original source, and several millenniums between them and that source, the genetic re
lations and distinctive peculiarities of the ancient speech from which they came must now be too much obscured for
easy recognition.



The oldest Aryan Dynasty. 243
ARYAN HISTORY AND ANTIQUITY.
All inquiry concerning the origin of the Sanskrit race and their first appearance in India has been greatly embarrassed by the refusal of investigators to accept the meaning of the old Iranian histories. They were histories
of the Aryan people in Asia for many years before either Media or Persia became separate kingdoms. But the in
quirer, with his imagination occupied and his mind bewildered by historical assumptions and dates, which he does
not allow himself to disturb, fails to see this, and puts ridiculous invention in the place of truth. While the ancient
history of the Aryan people, reproduced in the old Persian books, is treated as a history of Persia merely, confusion
and absurdity will be inevitable. It is no more a history of Persia than a history of the ancient kingdom of Turan
or Rum, of which it says so much, would, if it still existed,
be a history of modern Turkey. According to the old chronicles of Iran or Hiras, the his
tory of the Aryan people began with the reign of the great Abad, who was succeeded by thirteen kings, his descendants. These constitute the Mahabadian dynasty. After
the close of this dynasty there came a period of wild disor
der, and " everything went to ruin." At length Jai Afram, a descendant of Abad, restored order, and began a second
dynasty, that was long and prosperous. Shai Giliv began
a third dynasty, called the Shayian, which was " happy,"
and lasted many ages. A fourth dynasty, begun by Yasan, and called the Yasanian, had a line of wise and excellent
princes ; but at its close, " the state of mankind fell into
utter ruin," and there was a long period of frightful disorder and bloodshed. Finally, Gilshah, known in Iranian his

tory as Kaiamors, " restored the institutes of justice, gave
battle to the vile race," and had an illustrious reign. His
successors are called the Gilshayan monarchs, and divided
into four dynasties : the Peshdadian, the Kaianian, the Ashkanian, and the Sassanian. The Dabistan says there were long intervals between the several dynasties previous to
Kaiamors; and " between Yasan and Gilshah there must
have elapsed 'multiplied and numerous generations." Those who can see nothing but Persia in this" ancient his
tory coolly dismiss the dynasties previous to Gil shah as fabulous, do nothing, or worse than nothing, with the Pesh
dadians, and begin the history with the Kaianian dynasty,
transferring to it all the more distinguished Peshdadian
monarchs. And then, by means of " emendations" in the
usual style of the manufacturers of " chronological har
mony," they contrive to make it begin about 600 years before the Christian era. By this process it all becomes Persian history, and Zoroaster is made to live in the time of
Darius Hystaspcs. We are told that Anquctil du Perron
treated this matter with remarkable " ingenuity," as follows: "The reigns of the Peshdadian primes, as recorded
in the ancient books of of the Persians, are true, or at probable, when considered in a proper point of view ; that is, the reign or dynasty of Jemshid as the Chaldean dynasty of Julius Africamis; that of Zohak as the Arab dynasty of the same author; and that ofFeridun as the dynasty of
BeK'tanm, ending with Sardanapalus." [See the Notes to
Shea's translation of Mirkond's History of Persia.] A
stroke of genius, no doubt; but excessive brilliancy is imt
always pleasant. It was said in the old Iranian books that the Peshdadiana
governed the kingdom of Hiras, of which Balkh was the

capital. The Dabistan (which mentions twenty or thirty such ancient books that are now lost) places the beginning
of the reign of Gilshah, or Kaiamors, 5371 years before Christ; Ferdousi's estimate was 3529; and Sir William
Ouseley, in his "Epitome," taken from the Jehan Ara, states the mean of various dates referred to in that work to be 3436 B.C. There is no authentic date, but the time
was far back in the past. The Greeks, who said Zoroaster appeared 6000 years before the death of Plato and 5000
years before the Trojan War, placed it farther back than either of the dates here named.
We must put away confusion and accept the fact that,
in ages long before Persia appeared as a nation, the city of Balkh, or Bactria, was the capital of a great kingdom of the Aryan people called Hiras, Hiran, and Iran. The date given in the Dabistan is more likely to be worth attention than the others named. The territory included within this kingdom, when it was greatest, may be indicated by the Fourteen Aryan Settlements or provinces described in the
Yendidad, among which appears Bactria " with the lofty banner," indicating its metropolitan importance. These
" Settlements" (following Haug's exposition) are named as follows: 1. Sughdha, or Sogdiana; 2. Mourn, or Margiana, called also Merv : 3. Bakhdi, or Bactria, with Balkh for its chief city ; 4. Nisaya, or Northern Parthia, the Nisaia of Ptolemy ; 5. Haroyu, or Aria, the Hariva of the cuneiform
inscriptions ; 6. Vekereta, or Segestan, the home of Rustem, so famous in the old Iranian histories ; 7. Urva, or Cabul,
as Ilaug has shown; 8. Khnenta, or Kandahar; 9. Haraquaiti, or Arachosia; 10. Hetumat, or the district of Hilmend ; 11. Ragha, or Northern Media, where Ptolemy and
Strabo place a city of Rhaga3; 12. Kakhra, or Khorassan;



24:6 Pre-Historic Nation*.
13. Varena, or Gliilan; 14. Haptu-Hindu, or the Punjab. Ilaptu-Hindu was in India, being the region between the
Indus and the Sutlej, " the land of the seven rivers," called
in the Veda, also, the country of the seven rivers, and some
times the country of the five rivers. It probably included territory west of the Indus.
The Iranian record of kings" and dynasties previous to Gilshah, or Kaiamors, doubtless preserves recollections of the history of the Aryan people during their residence in Upper Asia before the family separated. Kaiamors and
his successors, with the great kingdom of Hiras, must represent the period when the Zend and Sanskrit branches of
the family still lived together as one people and used a
common language. In the later ages of this kingdom the Vedic and Zend dialects were developed. There may have been both political and religious division ; but we cannot explain the circumstances that led the Vedic branch of the
race to invade India beyond the Sutlej, and establish them
selves in the valley of the Upper Ganges. Kings must have continued to reign at Balkh, over a lessened kingdom,
long after this movement took place; but it is plain that, previous to the movement of the Vedic family to occupy Northern India beyond the Sutlej, they dwelt a long time
in Haptu-IIindu, then a province of the kingdom of Iliras. The refusal to see anything more in the old Iranian rec
ords than Persian history is so preposterous, and has created so much confusion and absurdity, that it is not easy to understand how it has been possible. Nearly a hun
dred years ago, it led an ardent scholar, John Richardson, in his "Dissertation on the Languages, etc., of the Eastern Nations," to deny the truthfulness of Greek history, and speak of it as pure romance. Having dismissed as fabulous



Richardson^ Perplexities. 247
all the ages of Aryan history previous to the Kaianian dynasty, and identified the first king of that dynasty with the Median Cyaxares, he read everything in the old chronicles as Persian history after that date ; but he was per
plexed to find it so totally different from Persian history as written by the Greeks ; he declared them to be as much
unlike as " the annals of England and Japan." In what he
assumed to be Persian history, there was " no mention of Cyrus the Great," nor of any king who could be forced to
resemble him; " not a vestige of the famous battles of Mar
athon, Thermopyla3, Salamis, Plata3a, and Mycale," nor a single trace of "the most splendid facts of the Greek histo
rians." Therefore Mr. Richardson, instead of correcting his own falsification of Persian history, accused the Greeks of
falsehood and discredited their histories. This is more logical than the "harmonies" attempted by some others who have treated Iranian history in the same way, but it is no less absurd.
THE VEDA AND THE VEDIC AGE.
The Rig-Veda shows us that the earliest seat of the In
do-Aryans was in the upper valley of the Indus, on both sides of that river. This was Haptu-Hindu in Zend, and
Saptu-Sindhavas according to the Vedic speech. It was
chiefly that country in Northwestern India now called the Punjab. They must have dwelt there a long time. The earliest songs of the Rig-Veda must have been written in
Haptu-Hindu while it was a province of the kingdom of
the Hirasis, or not long after the separation. The Veda shows their long residence there, and also the progress of
their invading march from the Sutlej to the Sarasvati, in the upper valley of the Ganges, where they were estab

lishcd during the first great period of their purely Indian
history. These invading Aryans were intense and fanatical relig
ious enthusiasts. In the Veda they are described as " the
twice -born," " the righteous," "the sacrificers," and the like ; while the people they found dwelling in India are
impious " Dasyus," demons, devil-worshippers, a vile race,
" who observe no sacred rites." Their right to subjugate
the country is explained thus : " Indra subjects the impious
to the pious, and destroys the irreligious by the religious." They pray to Indra, "Hurl thy shaft against the Dasyn, and increase the might and glory of tin* Arya ;" and Indra,
" armed with lightning," moves about, " shattering the cities of the Dasyus," and is described as the destroyer of
" the godless cities" of the Dasyus," from which we may infer that the old inhabitants of India, described as Dasjr
us, had cities, settled life, and civilization. "Ancient cit
ies" of the Dasyus are mentioned ; also cities built of stone,
and cities which the invading Aryans attacked by block
ade or siege. The Dasyus, or native inhabitants of India, were not like
their invaders either in race or religion. Moreover, they
were " black-skinned," while the Aryans were white. This
is frequently mentioned. The Aryans arc " the bright
race," while the Dasyus are. described as " the dark i . and "the host of black descent;" and Indra is praised be
cause "he destroyed the Dasyus and protected the Aryan color." These expressions are used to mark the difference in color and race between the white Aryans and tho abo
rigines, or native inhabitants, whom they found in p< sion of the country. They can mean nothing else. Of course, the Veda undertakes no formal description of the



The Phallic Worship noticed. 249
aboriginal inhabitants. It has no formal discussions of ei
ther their religion, language, or social condition ; but their
unlikeness to the Aryans is plainly indicated. " Wealthy
Dasyus" are mentioned in the Mahabharata, who lived " in
a prosperous condition," and tempted Aryan saints to associate with them ; but this was at a later period, when the
" twice-born" children of the Veda were beginning to humanize that intense and terrible fanaticism which had reg
ulated their treatment of the Dasyus at the beginning. There are some passages of the Veda that seem to indicate that these intense Aryan invaders saw, in the religion
of the Dasyus, either Phallus worship or something akin to
it, for they express a feeling like what might naturally be aroused in them by observing the rites and symbols of that
worship without comprehending their significance. In the
Rig-Veda, vii., 21,5, the worshipper prays, " Let not the lascivious wretches (or those who make a god of the sisna,
i. e.j of the membrum virile) approach our sacred rite ;" and
in x., 99, 3, we read, " When smiting the [city] with a hundred portals, the irresistible [Indra] overcame the lascivi
ous wretches." Mr. Muir, in his " Sanskrit Texts," calls attention to these expressions, and also to the Vedic word
sisnadeva. He observes that " Roth thinks the word [sis
nadeva] is a scornful appellation for priapic or sensual de
mons." The Phallus-worshipping aborigines were natural
ly called demons by the " twice-born" Aryans. Mr. Muir
expresses some uncertainty ; but it cannot be disputed that the Phallic worship connected with Baal or Siva prevailed throughout India in the ante-Vedic ages. The Aryans
certainly found it there, and we may reasonably presume that these passages of the Veda express their execration
of its rites.

250 Pre-Historic Nations.
Scholars who have carefully studied the Yedic liteia
turc agree in the opinion that the Indo-Aryans paused in the valley of the Upper Ganges a long time probably several centuries before proceeding to occupy the country
farther east, and that " there the Brahmanical institutions
must have been developed and matured, and, perhaps, the. collection of the Vedic hymns, completed, and the canon closed ;" or, as Lassen has it, the germs imported from
without were first planted, cultivated, and brought to maturity in Hindustan, in the country adjacent to the Sarasvati River. There must have been a long distance in time, between the Veda and the Brahmanas. In the matured Brahmanical system Indra is dethroned by Brahma, who does not appear in the Veda as a deity, and the leading Vedic divinities have either disappeared or been trans
formed. In the literature of that system the Vedic lan
guage itself is superseded by Sanskrit.
There is neither history nor chronology of the long i >e
riod required for these changes, but their character, and what we know of the process by which snch changes aiv
effected, indicate its exte'nt. I cannot suppose that the Brahmanical system matured on the Sara>vati was the same
as that known to us as modern Brahmanism, which mu>t lie a late reconstruction of the old system ; but it was so ditU-r
on t from the simpler religion of the Veda, both in its divin
ities and its organization, that many ages mu>t liave been
required for the gradual growth of the changes by which this difference was produced. In the next a_res, that Aryan country on the Sarasvati was the holy land of the Brahmans. They called it Brah
nfivartta. The following is from a frequently quoted j.a::iLr o <>f Maim: "The tract fashioned by the gods, which



A Mixture of the Races. 251
/ies between the two divine rivers Sarasvati and Drishad
vati, is called- Brahmavartta. The usage relating to castes and mixed castes, that has been traditionally received in that country, is called the pure usage." He describes as
Aryavartta a region north of the Vindhya Mountains, frorp the valley of the Indus to the mouth of the Ganges, saying
that beyond its limits lay " the country of the Mlechhas," or Dasyus. "Twice-born men" were required to remain
within the limits of Aryavartta, " but a Sudra may dwell
anywhere." We see, therefore, that Manu appeared later than this first development of the Brahmanical system, and that when he wrote, the Indo-Aryans had left Brahmavartta to occupy the whole lower valley of the Ganges down
to the Bay of Bengal. Previous to this movement they had occupied but a small
part of India, and probably they were at all times much
less numerous than the aboriginal population. It may be presumed that fanatical exclusiveness was beginning to re
lax its severity when they took possession of the country on the Lower Ganges, and that closer relations were estab
lished between the Aryas and the Dasyus ; for at this period, or at a period not much later, must have begun that mixture of the two races in which the white Aryan color
finally disappeared. This mixture is an incontestable fact, but nothing indicates that it could have begun at any time
during the Vedic age. It must, however, have begun at a
very early period, for it was complete, even in the Punjab, long before the time of Alexander the Great, who found
there but one color, and apparently but one race. We
learn from Megastheries and Arrian that " the natives of India and Ethiopia are not much different in their features
or complexion." It was noticed, says Megasthenes, that



252 Pre-Historic Nations.
the people of Southern India were darker in color than
those at the north, and also that " the Astaceni and the
Assaceni," two Indian peoples dwelling on the west bank
of the. Indus, were " not altogether st) swarthy" as those east of that river.
It may be inferred from passages in the Sanskrit books
that after the Indo-Aryans occupied the country on the Lower Ganges known as Maghada and Behar, but more anciently as Kikata, Brahmanism was affected by some great and successful influence of the aboriginal inhabitants
and their religion. Kikata was probably a civilized and
important country of the Dasyus, and most of its people may have become incorporated with the Aryans who con
quered and occupied it. At any rate, after the Aryan oc
cupation of that country, the " twice-born" Sanskrit worshippers connected with Brahmiivartta did not regard it as
a land of faultless Brahmanism, but rather as a country in
which the true religion had lost the holy flavor of orthodoxy. But it was not wholly excluded from the pale of
the faithful, as may be seen in the following passage from
the Bhagavad Purana, quoted by Mr. Muir in his " Sanskrit
Texts," part ii., p. 363 : "In every place where those who are devoted to me, who are calm, who regard all things as
alike, and who are holy and virtuous, are born, the men
[of that country] are purified, even if they be KlkataV Professor Weber, noticing the doubt expressed by some concerning the origin of these Kikatas, shows, what the
Sanskrit books make plain, that they wnv Aryans who did not faithfully observe the Brahmanical rites. IIu thinks
" they may have been Buddhists, or the forerunners of Buddhism." It is well known that Kikata, or !Marhad:i, was the birth-place of both Buddhism and the Pali Ian

guage ; and the inspiration of Buddhism came largely from the doctrines of the Cushite system of planet worship, which
had prevailed in India previous to the Aryan invasion, and with which the phallic and serpent worship were intimately associated.
At a later period the Sanskrit race went beyond the
Vindhya Mountains into Southern India. An invasion of
that country, and a war with Ravana, king of Ceylon, furnish the subject of the Ramayana ; but they never occupied the Dakshin as they occupied the valley of the Ganges. The Sanskrit did not supersede the aboriginal tongues in the Dekhan, and the invaders found it necessary to absorb, or to reconstruct and modify, the old religion, which they could not exterminate. It may be doubted whether the
pure and stainless orthodoxy matured in the holy land of
the Brahmans, Brahmavartta, entirely escaped the modifying influence of the old religion in any other part of India. If its. modern representative could be submitted to the
judgment of the great Brahmans of the Sarasvati, they
would unquestionably regard it as a fallen creature, defiled and transformed by unlawful association with Rakshasas.
RELIGIOUS HISTORY OF SANSKRIT INDIA.
Some Oriental scholars have argued with much earnestness and ingenuity to show that Buddhism and the Pali language are older than Brahmanism and the Sanskrit lan
guage. They are mistaken in their conclusions, and yet
not entirely wrong. .They show conclusively that Buddhism must be older than modern Brahmanism, but they do not show that there was not another and much more ancient Brahmanical system, developed and matured while



25-i Pre-IIistoric Nation*.
the Sanskrit was in the brightest age of its history as a
spoken language, and long before the Pali made its appearance. What we know as the Brahmanism of India cannot
be very ancient. It is full of elements foreign to the San
skrit race ; it worships gods whom they did not bring into India, and who were unknown in the Pantheon at Brahmftvartta. Like the modern tongues of the country, it is full
of materials borrowed from the "Dasyus" or " R&kshasas,"
in mixture with whom the Indo-Aryans themselves lost their white color. This cannot be the Brahmanism to which Manu gave laws in the "divine country" on the Sarasvati, nor of any age while Sanskrit was still learned of mothers and nurses, and still used in all the intercourse of
common life.
Neither the Sanskrit nor the Pali books give us anything
like a regular history of religious development, change, and reconstruction in the various countries of India; but they rnable us to see that original and pure Brahmanism the Brahmanism of the time of Manu came into existence before the Sanskrit race established their supremacy in the lower valley of the Ganges, and that Buddhism did not appear until the kingdom of Klkata, afterward called Ma
gadha and Behar, became important and influential. At first, and for a long time, the two systems must have exited as two differing schools in the same religious commu
nion ; Buddhism being a visible but undeveloped heresy,
with a very distinct and positive individuality in its ele
ments and tendencies, but not yet sufficiently matured and
organized to create actual separation. Buddhism was much older than Gautama, or SakliyaMuni, the Buddha of the Ceylonese records. He was only
one of its prophets. A passage in the Raja Taringini, a re



Buddhism and the Buddhas. 255
iigious history of Kashmir, translated by Mr. Tumour, shows (for it plainly has this meaning) that in China, Thib
et, and Nepal, " six Arhatas, or mortal predecessors of Gautama" (Buddha), are recognised; and this accords with the
fact that the Jainas, whose religious system originated in Buddhism, celebrate Kasyapa, one of these predecessors, as their great prophet, claiming that the Buddhists themselves followed him before Gautama appeared.
Eugene Burnouf found it difficult to comprehend the very intimate relations between Buddhism and Siva wor
ship. Perhaps a clearer perception of the real significance of this worship, with a more careful consideration of the circumstances under which Buddhism came into existence,
might have lessened the difficulty. He recognised the an
tiquity of this system of religion by speaking of Sakhya
Muni as " the last of the seven human Buddhas of whom
tradition has preserved recollections." Buddhism was the
growth of many ages preceding that in which Sakhya-Muni appeared. Its system of doctrine and practice was com
pletely developed before his time, and this fact explains why the various Buddhist sects have differed and disputed
so much concerning the date of his appearance. Professor H. II. Wilson, finding among these sects not less than twenty different dates for the time of his birth, varying from 2420 B.C. to 453 B.C., made this a reason for
doubting whether such a person ever existed. We may reasonably deny that he was the original founder of Buddh
ism, but he was undoubtedly one of its great teachers. Burnouf thinks his teaching was oral, and doubts whether
he left any writings. Fa-hian, a Chinese Buddhist who spent several years in India between 399 and 414 A.D., stated his personal knowledge of Buddhist sects there that



256 Pro-Historic Nations.
specialty honored the names of three Buddhas, immediate
predecessors of Sakhya-Muni, but refused to honor him as a Buddha.
The successful development and final supremacy ot Buddhism in India were due, in great measure, to the
power and influence of the kingdom of Magadha. In that
kingdom its gradual grr wth was protected ; and when it came to an open warfare with Brahmanism, Magadha was supreme throughout Northern India. Brahmanism was defeated and driven into obscurity, and for ten or eleven centuries Buddhism was the dominant religion of the land.
It is probable that both Magadha and the religion it protected had much greater influence with the aboriginal in
habitants than Brahmanism, and were strengthened by their support; for Buddhism opposed the arrogance of caste, and preached equality. It drew much from the re
ligion of the primitive inhabitants, while it won their sympathy and support against the Brahmar.s. Buddhism appears to have had a somewhat larger influence in Southern India than had been possible to Brahmunism; and it took possession of Ceylon, where Brahnianism never found entrance. It was established in the countries of Farther In
dia; it crossed the Indus; it passed over the Himalaya, Mountains into Thibet ; it went to China ; and, although it
wa< subsequently expelled from India, it is still the religion of nearly one third of the human r;i In the seventh century of the Christian era Magadha no
longer existed as an all-powerful kingdom. There were
great political changes, and with them eame religious ehunges. Buddhism was declining, and Brahmanism was
gaining strength and influence. The reigning princes were no longer all Buddhists; the Brahmans were coming int<>

power. The inscriptions began to mention them, at first
with respect, as a class on whom royal favor was bestowed ;
then as " lords of the earth ;" and at last their position is in
dicated by the terms used in an inscription at Chatapur, dated in the year 1016 A.D., which describes them as those
" whose feet earthly kings adored." The downfall of Buddhism seems to have been effected by a combined and persistent attack of the Brahmans, the Saivas, communities repre
senting the ante-Sanskrit religion of the country, and all
the Buddhist sectaries who rejected Sakhya-Muni, or mado his teachings subordinate to other features of the more ancient Buddhism. The Buddhism of Sakhya was finally expelled from India; but the Brahmanism developed by this
successful crusade was no longer that of Maim and the great teachers of the ancient Bi;ahmavartta.
Sakhya-Muni, instead of being the founder of Buddhism, was merely the representative of one particular and very popular development of that system. The Jainas, who still remain in India, are really Buddhists who profess to follow
the teachings of his immediate predecessor. The Saivas, a numerous and powerful sect, probably had their origin in Buddhism, and represented features of that system which did not appear very distinctly in the teachings of Sakhya
and his disciples. We must suppose there may have been
much in ancient Buddhism that did not appear prominent
ly in that particular development of it which Asoka made the established religion of his empire.
The sect called Saivas may have been anciently a Buddhist school in which the elements drawn from the ante-San
skrit religion of India were more fully represented than in any other. It had risen to great influence when the Buddh
ism of Sakhya-Muni was overthrown ; and after this event

it seems to have been absorbed by the reconstructed Brahmanism that took the place of the fallen system. Like the Buddhists, the Saivas rejected the Yedas ; and Burnouf re
fers to " a considerable number of gods and goddesses, ver
itable Saivite divinities, such as Mahakala, Yamantaka, Bhairava, Durga, Mahakali, and others that were really borrowed from the popular religion of the Indians."
MODERX BKAHMANISM.
Dr. Stevenson says : " Three different systems of belief have contributed to the formation of modern Hinduism [or
Brahmanism], namely, ancient Brahmanism, Buddhism, and the ante-Brahmanfcal religion of the country." He is sure
that the worship of Siva was " an aboriginal superstition of the country," and that tjie Brahmans adopted it to gain influence with people of the old race. It is plain, however, that they adopted it because the Saivas were a power in
the land. As Dr. Stevenson observes, wherever the Brahmans found among the people a god whom they deemed it
politic to reverence, they straightway made him an avatar
of one of their own gods. He says innumerable local ava
tars of gods have thus sprung up throughout the country, and found celebration in maiiuiartuivd legends or Mahdtmyas of the Pui'anas. The later Brahmans aimed to conciliate and absorb evervthing; but there arc many districts where they have never l>een able to supersede the old religion ; and even the amalgamation of Brahmanism with Siva worship is not per Dr. Stevenson states, from his own extensive observation, that, he can vouch for the fact that, in the Marat hi country,
where Saivas greatly prevail, no Brahman officiates in a
linga temple. The same appears to be true in the Dekhan ;



Indian Ilist-ory falsified. 259
and here it may be stated that the ante-Sanskrit origin of
Siva worship is plainly signified by the fact that its chief seats and most sacred places are in those parts of the country where the influence of the Sanskrit race, whether as Brahmans or Buddhists, has always been weakest in the north-east and at the south, where the worshippers of Siva are far more numerous than those of Vishnu. The Brahmans could not have been wholly without or
ganization and influence during the Buddhist ages, for
they kept the Sanskrit language in use as a literary lan
guage, and they carefully preserved the old Vedic and Sanskrit books ; but their endeavor to connect the origin of modern Brahmanism with the oldest traditions of their class, and make it appear to be the same system that was
developed in the early times at Brahmavartta, has led them to destroy some of the books, revise and interpolate others, and to do all in their power to hide or obscure the inter
vening religious history of India. It cannot well be doubted that the Puranas have been reconstructed to a certain
extent. While, as Colonel Wilford pointed out, they contain much that bears internal evidence of great antiquity, there are other portions of their contents that cannot be
very old. Wilford said :
" I am sometimes tempted to be
liuve, from some particular passages in the Puranas which have the true historical style, that the Hindus have de
stroyed, or at least designedly consigned to oblivion, all
genuine records militating against their system." Mr.
Wathen believed that, " on the Mussulman conquest of
India, the Brahmans destroyed all previous historical doc
uments," and said, "they seem, nevertheless, to have care
fully preserved, invented, or adapted such compositions ia Sanskrit as attested their own religious supremacy."



260 Pre-Historic Nations.
While the Puranas undoubtedly contain genuine records
of great antiquity, we cannot safely trust those portions of them that relate to the connection of modern Brahmanism with ancient times.
INDIAN HISTORY AND CHRONOLOGY.
There is nothing in the monuments or literature of India
that affords materials for a chronological history of the
country, or that furnishes a basis for any hypothetical scheme of such a history. There is in the Pali language a
history of Ceylon, deemed authentic, that goes back to the year 543 before the Christian Era ; and there is a history
of Kashmir, the Raja Taringini, of which Professor Wilson
spoke as " the only Sanskrit composition yet discovered to
which the title of history can with any propriety be applied." It is "difficult to believe that written annals of
Magadhi, Oude, and other Indian kingdoms never existed.
The Jainas accuse the Brahmans of having destroyed " all the historical books in existence wherever they gained the
ascendency ;" and they assert, also, that the Puranas were originally historical works, and that Parasurama, Ramchan
dra, Krishna, and others, celebrated as divine heroes, wi-iv
merely great kings who reigned in Oudc and other Brahmanical countries in ancient times. It seems very clear that these charges against the Brahmans are true. The
lost history cannot be recovered; but certain facts appear,
in the course of these inquiries, that engage attention, and furnish important suggestions.
We see in the Veda itself that the people found in India by the Sanskrit race were a civilized people, who had im
portant cities, and, of course, settled life and political or
ganization. It is preposterous, and utterly unwarranted



The ante-Vedic Civilization. 261
by any fact whatever, to approach this investigation with the mind and imagination preoccupied by the assumption that the people of India were all savages before the Aryans
went there. Nothing to justify this assumption can be found in the Veda, for the terms of religious hatred and execration bestowed upon the native inhabitants by the fa
naticism of the invading Aryans cannot have this meaning.
When we read in the Veda that the Dasyus, Rakshasas,
and demons, as they were called, had important cities,
*' cities built of stone," " ancient cities," cities that were at
tacked by siege and blockade, we see clearly that the aboriginal inhabitants of India were civilized.
It is probable that the highest condition of their civilization existed in the kingdoms of the southern country and on the Lower Ganges ; but civilization was found in that
part of India first visited and occupied by the Sanskrit race. Fa-hian, the Chinese traveler, learned in India that the an
cient " Rakshasas" and " demons" of Ceylon were a civilized and commercial people. In the Ramayana, the people of the Dekhan are called not only Rakshasas, but also
" monkeys ;" but there is mention of their kings, kingdoms,
wealth, golden ornaments, and rich gifts to Rama, which
very distinctly indicates their civilization. We see it, also,
in those antiquities of the country, which must be referred
to ages before the Aryan immigration, and which so clearly connect that ante-Sanskrit civilization with the Arabian
Cushites. Civilization must have come from Arabia to In
dia at a period that was already in the misty deeps of antiquity when the oldest hymns of the Veda were written. The history of the Aryan race in India may be divided
into four distinct periods. 1 . The Vedic age, which began
when the Indo-Aryans were dwelling in Haptu-Hindu, and

closed at some period after their settlement at Brahmavart
ta on the Sarasvati. During this period they occupied but a small part of the country. 2. The ancient Brahmanical
period, which began at Brahmavartta, and terminated when the supremacy of Buddhism was established. This was the period of the Sanskrit language. The Vedic tongue had ceased to exist save in the old books, arid there were im
portant changes in the Vedic Pantheon. A very long period of time was required for such changes, t<> which mu>t

systematic perversions, had recourse to, since the time of
Megasthenes, by the Hindus, to work out their religious impostures, and that they in no degree originate in barbarous ignorance, or in the imperfect light that has glimmered
on a remote antiquity." And yet these unpardonable falsifiers have not been able to hide the fact that Buddhism,
including all its various schools, has had a far more pow
erful and permanent influence in India than Brahmanism, nor to conceal the comparatively modern origin of their
own composite system.
THE ANCIENT MALAYAN EMPIEE.
El-Mas'udi, in his work on history and geography, en
titled " Meadows of Gold and Mines of Gems," says : " In
dia is a vast country, having many seas and mountains, and borders upon the empire of ez-Zanij, which is the kingdom of the Maharaj, the king of the islands, whose dominions form the frontier between India and China, and are
considered as part of India," He represents that " the
splendor and high civilization" of this island empire, called
cz-Zanij, were greatly celebrated. Farther on he adds:
" The Maharaj is lord of the sixth sea," and " king of the islands from which drugs and spices are exported;" and
says, " the population and the number of the troops of his kingdom cannot be counted; and the islands under his
sceptre are so numerous that the fastest sailing vessel is not able to go round them in two years." [See Aloys
Sprenger's translation, p. 176, 187, 355-6, and 397.] The people of this great island empire, he tells us, were black. Five hundred and fifty years after the time when El
Mas'udi wrote, the Portuguese made their first appearance in the Indian Seas, having sailed around the Cape of Good

Hope. At that time this celebrated empire was still in ex
istence, much weakened, and in a state of decline. It in
cluded, with the peninsula of Malacca, the great islands of Sumatra, Borneo, Java, and Celebes, and all the other islands between Australia and the China Sea. Renaudot
gives the reports of two Mussulman travelers who visited that part of the East in the ninth century, previous to the time of El-Mas'udi. At that time it included Arracan,
Chittagong, the Gangetic provinces, and considerable territory on the Coromandel coast. They called it the empire
of Zapage, or Zabiija, probably a corruption of the name of the island of Java, or Jtiba, which is also an old name for the island of Sumatra, called Ja-ba-diu by Ptolemy and Marco Polo. These travelers gave an account of wars be
tween the Maha-Raja of Zabaja and the king of Al-Comr, or Comorin, and other kings in Southern India. Zaba, on
the peninsula of Malacca, was a famous emporium in the time of Ptolemy; and Zabaja, as a great maritime power, was probably much older than the Christian Era.
This was an empire <>f the people whom we know us the Malay8, who, like the modern inhabitants of Yemen, Mauri
tania, and Asia Minor, no longer represent the civilization that made their nation great in ancient times. It may
reasonably be presumed that in the Malays we see the race found in India by the Arabian Cushites. Mr. Marsden, who
has given some attention to their literature and language, is inclined to connect them ethnically with the people of Chinese Tartary. Their color and other physiological pe
culiarities forbid this classification, and probably their lan
guage will do so strongly whenever it shall be thorough
ly understood and intelligently described. It has been ascertained that dialects of the Malayan tongue are used



The Malays and America. 265
by the people inhabiting nearly all the islands from New Zealand to the Sandwich Islands, from Madagascar to For* mosa, and from the Indian Archipelago to Easter Island, on the American side of the Pacific Ocean; and that they
all have certain rites and customs, which, like their related
dialects, indicate a common origin. These points are discussed in a volume published at London in 1834, which was written by Rev. Dr. Lang, and en
titled " The Origin and Migrations of the Polynesian Na
tion, Demonstrating their Ancient Discovery and Progressive Settlement of the Continent of America." Humboldt and others have stated their belief that America was visit
ed iii pre-historic times by people from the Asiatic world, who went there across the Pacific Ocean ; the Chinese and Japanese have recorded traditions that say this ; and the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg points out that the ancient Peruvians had traditions of the arrival in their country of foreigners, who came by sea, and landed on the western
coast.
The ancient Malayan civilization, like that of India and
so many other ancient peoples, came originally, we may suppose, from the old Arabians. Java and the other large
islands have antiquities, including ruins and inscriptions, that have not been explored and studied. The Malays read and write, and have many of the arts of civilized life.
They use the Arabic characters, it is said ; but formerly, it
appears, they used another alphabet. Lieut. Col. Sykes stated, in the Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society, that
" there are ancient inscriptions in Java" written in a character like that of" the old inscriptions in the Dekhan." If
the antiquities of that old empire of Zabaja (which Dr.
Lang, in the ardor of his enthusiasm, believed to be as old
M

as the Empire of China) could be intelligently and faithfully explored, something important might be added to our knowledge of the East something that might give us a better notion of the character and importance of the Malayan people in ancient times, and aid our endeavor to make clear some of the difficult problems of Indian history.

EGYPT PREVIOUa TO MENES.
ANCIENT Egypt is now a, fact that cannot be discredit
ed, but a fact, nevertheless, which the current chronologies cannot accept. It has always been visible, though scarcely ever fully recognised by those who have written history. Greek scholars who visited Egypt toward the close of the
New Monarchy, studied in its schools, explored its libraries, observed its monuments, and had access to abundant
materials for writing its history, were not incited to write on that country, even as imperfectly as some of them wrote
about Persia. They were more disposed to appropriate Egyptian science and philosophy without due acknowledgment ; and we find many Greeks censuring Herodotus scornfully because he admitted that Greek thought and
culture came largely from the Egyptians and Phrenicians. Hellenic egotism and exclusiveness could not allow the scholars of Greece proper to write candid histories of" out
side barbarians," and show, by clear and formal recogni
tion, that the civilization of any " barbarian" nation, or of
any older time, was or could be superior to that of Hellas ;
and their spirit has been allowed too great influence on the scholarship of modern times. Greek scholars had before them records and monuments of the Old Monarchy of
Egypt. Had they investigated carefully, and recorded the result of their investigations in Candidly-written histories of the country, our notions of the great past would



268 Pre-Historic Nations.
be regulated by a scheme of chronology more in accordance with truth than that of Usher or of any other rabbinical speculator, and it would be much easier to accept the facts concerning Egypt which modern discoveries have made undeniable.
MANETHO'S HISTORY OF EGYPT.
So far as we know, the only history of Egypt ever written in Greek was that of Manetho of Sebennytus, an Egyp
linn priest of the highest reputation for learning and wisdom, who wrote about 300 years before the Christian Era. His aim was to give, in the Greek language, a full account
of the religious and philosophical wisdom of his country,
with a complete record of its history and chronology, basing his work on the ancient annals and sacred books of
Egypt. The history was arranged in three parts. In the first part he gave what was known of the history of Egypt
previous to the time of Menes, with the first eleven dynasties of the Old onarchy, which Menes established. The second part closed with the nineteenth dynasty, and the third continued the history down to the overthrow of Nectanebus II., the last native sovereign, by the Persian-.
According to Manetho, as usually understood, the time from the first year of Menes to this conquest of Egypt by the Persians was 3555 years. During this time there were thirty successive dynasties, and the account o them sug
gests a division of Egyptian history into three great periods the Old Monarchy, the Middle Monarchy, or period
of the Hyksos, and the New Monarchy, which began witli the eighteenth dynasty, and terminated with the reign of Nectanebus II. Manetho states that the rule of the Hyk
sos lasted 511 years. The reign of Menes began in the



Manetho's Egyptian Dynasties. 269
year 3893 B.C., reckoning Julian years, or 3895, reckoning
Egyptian years. This important work of Manetho is lost ; but fragments of it have come down to us in the works of Julius Africa
rius, Eusebius, Syncellus, Josephus, and others. Certain passages in Plutarch's treatise de Iside et Osiri are sup
posed to be extracts from that part of it in which he ex
plained the Egyptian doctrines concerning the gods. The most valuable portion of the history thus preserved is the
list of Egyptian dynasties. None of the transcribers, however, have preserved it entirely free from error ; but in
Julius Africanus, copied by Syncellus, and in the Armenian version of Eusebius, we have copies of it so nearly correct
that we can see what it was. Our dogmatic chronologists have not been able to receive this list with cordiality ; in
fact, they have treated it very unworthily ; but its correctness has been revealed more and more clearly at every
step in the progress of modern discovery in Egypt, which, instead of reducing the time given for the duration of
Egypt under all the dynasties, has led some acute investigators to believe it should be considerably increased by additions to the time of the Old Monarchy. Manetho's eminent character and great reputation made
his work an authority in his own time. It was universally accepted as authentic. It does not appear that its accu
racy was questioned for 600 years after it was written, or until the beginning of the fourth century of the Christian Era, when certain Jewish Rabbins and Christian writers
fell into an obstinate chronological controversy, the Chris
tians aiming to establish certain millennial theories, and the Jews to oppose them. Manetho's chronology found its way into this controversy, but neither Jew nor Chris

tian was in a mood to accept it without revision. Both parties sought to compel his dates to harmonize with the system they profanely called biblical ; and the rabbinical
dogmatist, who had not scrupled to falsify the genealogies and alter the dates of his own sacred Scriptures, could not be expected to treat Manetho with much reverence. Ma
netho's earliest chronological date, 3893 B.C., could not be
tolerated; therefore it must be denied; and they proceeded to mutilate and falsify his list of the dynasties. This villanous endeavor of falsehood, which was as false to
the real chronology of the Hebrew Scriptures as to that of Manetho's history, was conducted in the most systematic and elaborate manner possible to those engaged in it. Manetho's lists and numbers were altered, abbreviated, and transformed in the most unscrupulous way, so as to compress them within such limits as suited the dogmatism of rabbinical theories.
This studied operation of fraud produced two spurious
works the "Old Chronicle" and the " Sothis1' which have, since, more than once deceived and misled honest in
vestigators. To these spurious writings which almost entirely omitted the Old Monarchy and otherwise fals'itu-d the true list is due most of the confusion introduced into
the inquiry concerning Egyptian chronology and anck'iit history. Their real character is now more general!}
derstood; and yet, since the year I860, a large and elaborate octavo volume has appeared in England, devoted to a
discussion of Egyptian chronology, in which that ihlse "Old Chronicle" is used as the highest authority on this
subject. But it does not belong to my present purpose to eii^ in this Discussion, or to give a history of modern explora

tions and discoveries in Egypt. My inquiries relate to more ancient times. For all that belongs to the history of Egypt since the time of Menes, I must refer my readers to the works of eminent Egyptologists whose names
are familiar to all, and especially to the very thorough
and complete essay of Professor Lepsius on " The Chronol
ogy of the Egyptians," and to the publications of M. Mari
ette in France. Lepsius shows how constantly the monuments confirm the history of Manetho ; and he observes
very justly that "the investigation of Egyptian history will gradually exercise an extensive influence on all branch
es of archaeology on our whole conception of the past history of man."
ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF EGYPT.
Before the time of Menes, Egypt had a civilization which must have seemed old to those acquainted with it. This is apparent to all who have studied the antiquities of that
country. Sir Gardner Wilkinson refers to " the great mathematical skill of the Egyptians in the time of Menes," evinced by the change he made in the course of the Nile,
and says : " It may be inferred, from their great advancement in the arts and sciences at this early period, that
many ages of civilization had preceded the accession of
their first monarch." Upper and Lower Egypt had previ
ously existed as separate countries, each being governed by its own princes. Menes was a prince of Upper Egypt,
the oldest of these separate countries. He was bom at the city of This or Thinis, which appears to have been the royal seat of a Thinite dynasty of the upper country. That
he was a man of remarkable force of mind and character may be inferred from the fact that he was able to unite the



272 Pre-Historic Nations.
" Two Countries" under one government, and lay the foundations of a great monarchy whose monuments are still studied with admiration and wonder.
There is neither history nor chronology of Egypt previ
ous to the time of Menes. We have only the fact that civ
ilization, letters, science, political organization, and kings existed there long before he appeared, with such knowl
edge of the early history of the " Two Countries" as may
be gleaned from legends, traditions, and mythological narratives. Annals of those early ages were undoubtedly written and preserved in the temples, but they seem to
have perished long before the time of Manetho. When we consider that a civilization like that of Egypt in the time of Menes is not the work of a year or of a century, we
see distinctly that Egypt had a long existence previous to his reign. Most of the great monuments of civilization now found in Egypt belong to the period of the Old Monarchy, some of the grandest of them being as old as the
time of its earlier dynasties.
According to the uniform testimony of tradition, civilization was first established in Egypt by colonies of Cush
ites, or Ethiopians. The old civilization throughout the whole upper valley of the Nile had the same origin. It came originally from Arabia, and went onward into Egypt, in very early times, before the Cushite race had changed its color by mixture with the dark race of Africa. Accord
ing to Pliny, King Juba II. stated, in his work on Africa, that the people in the valley of the Nile, from Syene to ]Men>e, were Arabians. Those who have studied ancient
Egypt carefully generally agree in the opinion that the Egyptians must have come originally from some country on the Asiatic side of the Red Sea. Sir Gardner Wilkin
son says on this point :



Origin of the Egyptians. 273
" Every one who considers the features, the language, and other peculiarities of the ancient Egyptians, will feel convinced that they are not of African extraction, but that, like the Abyssinians and many inhabitants of the known valley of the Nile, they bear the evident stamp of an Asi
atic origin." And, "In manners, language, and many other respects, Egypt was certainly more Asiatic than African ; and though there is no appearance of the Hindu and Egyptian religions having been borrowed from one another, yet it is not improbable that those two nations may
have proceeded from the same original stock, and have migrated southwards from their parent country in Central Asia."
How many difficult problems, or problems that seem difficult to many learned investigators, become clear imme
diately when we recognise the pre-historic greatness of ancient Arabia ! Sir Gardner Wilkinson goes to Central Asia to find the origin of the ancient Egyptians, and endeavors to connect them with the Aryan race, which linguistic science forbids. Professor Rawlinson and others go over into
Africa, and down the Nile to Meroe, to find the original colonizers and civilizers of Chaldea, which is preposterous. These gropings in the dark will be discontinued when such
inquirers have learned to comprehend Arabia, the ancient mother of nations. Sir Henry Rawlinson sees the common
origin of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, and finds it even in
the character of their writing, which, he thinks, must have been in existence before the two peoples separated; but
he does not see Arabia, although he understands very well
the impossibility of connecting the origin of either the Chaldeans or Egyptians with any people of the Aryan race.
Lcpsius draws the same conclusions from the resemblance

of Egyptian and other Cushite writing, and thinks the
Egyptians may have brought the first elements of theirs
" from their original home in Asia."
The ancient Arabians, being what they were, could not fail to occupy the Nile valley, and place colonies in Upper
Egypt. It is very easy to see the course taken by their
colonizing and civilizing forces. They crossed the Straits of Bab - el - Mandeb, and created a second Land of Cush.
They occupied the Upper Nile valley, creating the civilized country long known as Barbara, and afterwards filmed as Meroe. At length they went on to the lower valley of
the Nile, and planted colonies in Upper Egypt. Sir Gard
ner Wilkinson says : " That civilization advanced northwards from the Thebaid to Lower Egypt is highly prob
able." The hieroglyphic legends which give precedence to Upper Egypt, and show that its early cities were the
oldest in the country, place this beyond doubt. Civilization certainly came from the south.
Memphis, in Lower Egypt, founded by Mines, has around its ruins the great pyramids, and many other wonderful remains of the Old Monarchy, which astonish beholders ;
but This, or Thinis, in Upper Egypt, was a royal city, where kings reigned long before the time of Menes. The Egyp
tian name of Memphis was Misr. When another royal town rose on the east side of the river, this new city was
also called Misr, and it still retains this name among the
people, for Alkuhirn, the Conqueress, vulgarly called Cairo, is merely an epithet of the Mahometan Arabs. Ilosea calls
the city Moph; the Chaldean paraphrase calls it Maplu-s ; Rabbi Kimchi says Moph and Noph were the same town.
The Septuagint calls it Memphis, which the Copts and Arabs pronounce Menuf or Menf. Misr was the



Egypt once a Bay of the Sea. 275
name of Egypt ; and Misraim, the plural or dual, means
literally the Two Misrs, Egypt being described on its mon
uments as the " Two Countries." It is stated that, when civilized communities were first
established in Egypt, the lower part of the country was
entirely sea and marsh. Herodotus, who investigated this point and discussed it at length, believed that Egypt was formerly a bay or arm of the sea. In his second book, he speaks thus of its physical condition in the time of Menes :
" They say that in the time of Menes all Egypt, except the
district of Thebes, was a morass, and that no part of the land now existing below Lake Myris was then above wa
ter. To this place from the sea is a seven days' passage
up the river." So it was written substantially in the annals of Egypt, and so it wras stated by the voice of tradi
tion. Menes drained a part of Lower Egypt by changing the channel of the river. Diodorus Siculu^ rehearsing, in his third book, what he had learned from Ethiopian sources, makes this statement : "The Ethiopians say that the Egyptians are a colony drawn out of them by Osiris ; and that
Egypt was formerly no part of the continent, but a sea at the beginning of the world, but that afterwards it was made land by the River Nile."
Rennell, in his work on the Geographical System of He
rodotus, observes that " the configuration and composition of the low lands leave no room for doubt that the sea once washed the base of the rocks on which the pyramids of
Memphis stand, the present base of which is washed by the inundation of the Nile at an elevation of seventy or eighty feet above the Mediterranean ; but when we attempt to carry back our ideas to the remote period when the foundation of the delta was first laid, we are lost in the con



276 Pre-Historic Nations.
templation of so vast a period of time." That Egypt is
geologically a " gift of the Nile" cannot reasonably be doubted, and yet, old as it is, Sir Charles Lyell points out
conclusively that it is much more modern than the " stone age" of Europe, as revealed by deposits found in the ancient gravel of the valley of the Somme. Diodorus Siculus adds to his statement that the laws,
customs, religious observances, and letters of the ancient
Egyptians closely resembled those of the Ethiopians, " the colony still observing the customs of their ancestors."
Egypt, for several millenniums previous to his time, had
been a " colony" of which the Ethiopians or any other people might feel proud without being unreasonable. It is
true, however, that the origin and close relationship of the various communities established by the old Cushites were
everywhere shown by the similarity of their mythologies, religious ceremonies, and social usages. These, quite :is
surely as comparative philology, or records found written on old ruins, still reveal to us the ancient connection of the
Cushite race with Egypt, India, and Asia Minor, and with many other countries at the East and around the Medi
terranean. The very great resemblance between tli
Egyptians and the Cushites, extending to their languages, which belonged to the same family, makes it undeniable that one of these two peoples owed its civilization to tinother. But we see clearly, in all the records and traditions
of antiquity, that the civilization of Cusha-dwipa, the Land of Cush, was much older than that of Egypt much older than any other of which there is the slightest trace in the
mythologies, traditions, records, or old ruins of antiquity, of which we have any knowledge. The Aryan civilization may have been nearly as old, but



The Puranas on Egypt. 277
in early times it was not greatly developed ; and it was
not so widely prevalent, nor so powerfully controlling in the ancient world. Certainly it had nothing to do with the formation and development of Egypt ; that was en
tirely a work of the Cushites, or Ethiopians. This is why the annals of the Egyptian priests were so full of the Ethiopians, who not only played a foremost and wonderful part in the affairs of the world, but who had been playing that part long before Egypt became the abode of a civilized
community.
THE OLD SANSKRIT BOOKS ON EGYPT.
Many references to the pre-historic ages of Egypt arc found in the old Sanskrit books, which contain remarkably accurate notices not only of Africa, but also of Western
Europe. What the ancient Aryans knew of distant re
gions came to them probably through the more enterprising Cushites, who preceded them in India, and with whom they must have maintained a constant intercourse. That
the account of Egypt, given by their Puranas and other
legendary narratives, is based on actual knowledge of a very early condition of the country, is evident, for it is ac
companied by accurate descriptions of the Nile, of the re
gions through which it flows, and of adjacent regions in Africa; and it is just as clear that these mythical and legendary narratives of the ancient Aryans of India have a
historical basis. They may have been shaped, more or less, by the influence of that enchantment which distance
in time and place usually works in the imagination of such a people. So it was with similar mythical stories of the
Greeks, and so it has been everywhere, from the beginning of time, in all communities placed in like circumstances.



278 Pre-Historic Nations.
The facts communicated must flow in the same stream of
narration with the feelings, fancies, and prejudices of the narrators ; but the facts are not on this account less real, and frequently they stand out with all the clearness of un
obscured reality. Some account of what is told by the Sanskrit Puranas, or mythical stories, can be found in the very elaborate pa
pers of Major Francis "Wilford, published in several of the early volumes of "Asiatic Researches." They establish the fact that in very remote times there was a great communication between India and Arabia, and the countries on the Nile, and most of them relate to events that occurred in the ages when the countries of Hindustan were still
subject to the sway of the Cushites, who seem to have begun their occupation of India before they went to Egypt. Here is the old Sanskrit description of the Nile :*
" That celebrated and holy river [the Nile] takes its rise from the Lake of the Gods, thence named Amara or Deva
Sarovera, the region of Sharma or Sharma-st'han, between the Mountains of Ajagara and Sitanta, which seem part of Soma-giri, or the Mountains of the Moon, the country round the lake being called Chdndri-st'han or Moonlainl : thence the Call [Nile] flows into the marshes of Padma-van, and through the Nishadha Mountains into the land of Barbara
[Nubia, still known to the natives as Barbara], whence it
* Some of Wilford's papers, published in volumes of the "Asiatic Re
searches" previous to the 8th, cannot be fully trusted, he tells us, b> lie was deceived by his pundit. But this cannot apply to their account of the Nile, for knowledge of the source and character of this river was prevalent in India and Arabia in very early time*. Moreover, Ptolemy, who studied the Phoenician and Arabian geographers carefully, stated that the Nile rose in certain Mountains of the Moon,y/-om two lakes lying east and west of each other, near the equator.

passes through the Mountains -of Hemacuta into Sancha
dwipa proper [i. e. Upper Egypt proper] ; there, entering the forests of Tapas [or Thebais], it runs into Cantaca-desa, or Misra-st'han, and through the woods named Arauga and Atavi, into the Sanc'habdhi."
In this description we see an actual knowledge of the source of the Nile, of the lake region of Africa, and of the country near the Mountains of the Moon knowledge which we have lacked until within a few years ; and we still know much less of those regions than was known in
India when these Puranas were originally written, especially of the Mountains of the Moon, whose very name comes
to us from Arabia and India. We have learned recently from explorers that the main source of the Nile is a lake
which they call Victoria Nyanza, and that it certainly has connection with another lake, now called Albert Nyanza.
They tell us, also,' that the country around the lakes, at and near the sources of the Nile, is now called U-nyamuezi
or Moonland; and Speke says: "U-nyamuezi Country
of the Moon must have been one of the largest kingdoms of Africa." The Mountains of the Moon, whose name is as
old, probably, as the first Cushite occupation of that country, have not yet been explored. Traditions of that Cushite invasion and occupation, as well as other traces of it, remain there to this day. The country which the Puranas designate as Barbara
was situated between Upper Egypt and Abyssinia, or, ac
cording to Wilford, it included " all the country between Syene and the confluence of the Nile with the Tacazze, which is generally called Barbara and Barba at the present time." In this name, perhaps, we see the origin of that term Barbary, which has been applied to Northern Africa,



280 Pre-Historic Nations.
and also of the term Berbers, used to designate numerous tribes that occupy the interior of Northern 'Africa.
According to the Sanskrit books, the first settlers in
Egypt were the Sharmicas, who went from Cusha-dwipa.
It is said, " they found the country peopled by evil beings,
and by a few impure tribes of men who had no fixed habitation." They were followed by other tribes and emi
grants, from various parts of Cusha-dwipa within, among
whom the most numerous and important were the Pallis, who are shown to have been Cushites, and who, as Wilford points out, were of the same race as the Phoenicians. The
term Sancha-dwipa, which became a designation for the whole eastern part of the continent, was originally applied to Upper Egypt. There are legends referring to other emigrants who are said to have gone to that region from Cusha-dwipa and from India, in which we see, woven into beautiful fictions, traditional reports of occurrences there after the first settlements became established communities.
Of course, they give us neither history nor chronology ; and there is usually nothing to indicate clearly either the distance or the relation, in time, between the events used for narration in one legend and those used in another. The
Pin-anas describe the reign of " King It" (or "Ait," as he is often called), whose rule seems to have marked a great
epoch in the history of Upper Egypt. He belonged to a very remote period. In the Greek traditions he is called ^Etus. The Puranas say he came forth from the waters of the Call, or Nile, and they speak of him as a subordinate incarnation of the god Mrira. He put an end to a period
of frightful war and devastation, overwhelmed the Daityas
or evil beings, protected the Devatas or good people, restored order, and ruled those countries with honor and

glory. Stephanus of Byzantium says he came from India,
which the Puranas do not claim. He may have been a Cushite or Arabian prince who had been employed in India, then
largely occupied by the Cushites, and who was afterwards sent to the countries on the Nile to suppress disorder and rebellion, or to defend the settlements against invasion from the interior. He may have remained there a long time as
governor of those countries.
The Puranas mention several kings of Arabia, or " the interior Cusha-dwipa," with whom the countries on the
Nile had a very intimate connection, and to whom they were subject or tributary. One of these Cushite kings
was Divodasa, pronounced Diodas in the popular dialects.
It is said that he reigned over the " western districts" of Cusha-dwipa within, which extended from the shores of the Mediterranean to the banks of the Indus and the shores of the Indian Ocean. Wilford remarks that "he seems to have been the Hercules-Diodas mentioned by Eusebius, who flourished in Phoenicia." The story of another king of
Cusha-dwipa is told with variations, and with more than
the usual activity of imagination, indicating that at some remote period in the past he had a wide-spread fame, and was a favorite theme of popular eulogy. One version of
his story is substantially as follows : On the Mountains of Jwalamuc'ha, in the interior Cusha
dwipa, reigned a virtuous and religious prince, named Charvanayanas, whose son, Capeyanas, had . a controlling passion for arms and hunting. At length Capeyanas, being more devoted to his favorite pursuits than to religious
observances, was exiled by his father, went to a prince whose territory was in the western part of Arabia, and married his daughter. He distinguished himself as a he

roic warrior, rose from the position of a subordinate prince,
became the supreme ruler of Cusha-dwipa, governed justly, subdued rebellious tributary princes east and west, made great conquests, and ruled his vast kingdom in glory. He had a daughter named Antarmada, and a son Bhateyanas, who succeeded him on the throne and conquered the King of Meru. Bhateyanas and his sister finally became devotees, and retired to the forest of Tapas, in Upper Egypt.
Here Antarmada was sorely persecuted by Mayadeva, who at length chained her to a rock on the sea-shore, from which she was delivered by a young hero named Parasira,
whom she married. After death they were seated among
the stars, with Capeyanas and his wife CasyapL Wilford, having detected his pundit in deceptions and fraudulent copyings from the manuscripts, was for a time in doubt concerning the authenticity of this Sanskrit ver
sion of the story of Kepheus, Cassiopeia, Perseus, and Andromeda. But, on careful investigation, the doubt was removed, and different versions of the story were found in
the Yantra-raja and other books, " with a most ample account of the thirty-six Deccani so famous in Egyptian astronomy, and called Drcscan in Sanskrit." In the Yantra
raja, Perseus is called Pretasira ; Andromeda, Vejara ; Cassiopeia, Lebana ; and Kepheus, Nripa or AV// 1

what is so evident elsewhere, that the Land of Cush furnished both the Greeks and the ancient Aryans of India, with materials for their mythological narratives, and therefore had a civilization much more ancient than any other known
to them. And a large part of these materials was furnish
ed by personages and events belonging to that period in the history of Cusha-dwipa when Egypt was a colonial de
pendency or tributary province of that country. . It reminds one, as has been observed, of Lord Bacon's remark,
that "the mythology of the Greeks, which their oldest writers do not pretend to have invented, was no more than a light air, which had passed from a more ancient people into the flutes of the Grecians" [and of the old Aryans and
other peoples also], " which they modulated to such descants as best suited their fancies." All such narratives are
" founded on fact," and reveal an ancient history that gave
them birth, else they could not exist.
DIONYSOS, CALLED OSIRIS AND BACCHUS.
The narratives relating to Dionysos known in Egypt as Osiris, and sometimes called the Indian Bacchus refer
to a period more ancient, probably, than that of Kepheus. All the legends of Egypt, India, Asia Minor, and the older Greeks, describe him as a king, very great during his life, and deified after death. The history of Dionysos seems to have been a favorite topic with some of the older Ionian
writers ; and it was, undoubtedly, still more prominent in the lost literature of Egypt, Arabia, Thrace, and Asia Minor. Diodorus Siculus mentions one old work on this subject that appears to have come down from the ages pre
ceding Ionia, and with which he had some acquaintance.
He states that it was composed by ThymaBtes of Asia Mi

nor, describes it as a history of Dionysos given in a poem
entitled " Phrygia," and says it was written " in a very old language and character." It is added that Thymaetes took pains to secure the most accurate and complete information
relative to Dionysos; that he visited Nysa, in Arabia,
where he was educated, inquired of records and traditions,
and studied the subject carefully. The chief particulars in his account of Dionysos are as follows :
Amon, king of Arabia or Ethiopia, married Rhea, sister
of Cronos, who reigned over Italy, Sicily, and certain coun
tries of Northern Africa. Nevertheless, Amon was greatly in love with the beautiful Amalthea, and Dionysos was the child of this love. Rhea, in a violent excitement of anger,
separated herself from Amon, returned to Cronos, and be
came his wife. Dionysos was brought up at Nysa, a city of Arabia, and diligently instructed in the most learned arts and sciences. He was endowed with remarkable genius, and developed wonderful force and brilliancy of mind and character. The relations between Cronos and Amon were
constantly hostile, and at length the former became successful in a war against the latter, defeati <1 his armies, and
attempted a conquest of his kingdom. With this end in view, he marched against Nysa; but now Dionysos took the field, defeated the army of Cronos in a great battle,
drove him out of the country, pursued him to his own capital, dethroned him, and enthroned his son Zeus in his place.
It is added that Zeus reigned nobly and won a great fame.
The great career of Dionysos followed this beginning. He succeeded his father, and became the greatest of sovereigns.
He powerfully extended his sway in all the neighboring countries, and completed the conquest of India, where he spent several years, and built a city called Nysa. lie aft

erwards seems to have given much attention to the Cush
ite colonies in Egypt, greatly increasing their strength, in
telligence, and prosperity. In classical tradition, Cronos and Saturn are treated as the same personage ; but the character of the Roman Saturn is quite different from that of the Greek Chronos. In the mythical legends of Rome, Saturn was celebrated as a
very ancient king of Italy, who introduced agricultural industry, social order, and the habits of civilized life. His
reign filled the land with plenty, and created the golden age of Italy. He was suddenly removed to the divine abodes and became a god. These legends were ancient,
in Italy, long before Rome was built. The Greek, Egyp
tian, and Ethiopian legends made Dionysos contemporary with Saturn, or Cronos, and his sons. In the legends of
Egypt, Osiris, or Dionysos, was a glorious king of that country, who came to a violent death at the hands of his brother Typhon, and whose death was revenged by his
wife Isis and his son Orus. He was King of Egypt just as the sovereigns of Great Britain are sovereigns of Canada ;
Egypt formed a part of his empire. But the Egyptians, in their mythology, appropriated him entirely to themselves, making him the originator of civilization, and espe
cially of the arts of agriculture. Fresnel, in the Journal Asiatique, maintains that the Dhou-Nouwas of Arabian tradition is the same as Dionysos.
He quotes Pococke, who has pointed out the resemblances between the Arabian Dhou-Nouwas and the Dionysos of
ancient tradition, and says "Pococke was perfectly right in seeking Bacchus in Arabia." Fresnel attempts to locate
the city of N"ysa " about forty leagues from Zhafar," where there is a mountain which Edrisi calls Lous, although the



286 Tre-Historic Nations.
people of Mahrah call it Nous; but Dionysos and the citv of Nysa were many centuries older than Menes, and no
such attempt to locate that city can be satisfactory. The very mention of its distance from us, in time, is sufficient
to give any dogmatic chronologist a very disagreeable emotion. Fresnel finally comes to the conclusion that the
great colonizing and civilizing conquests, which Arabian tradition ascribes to Dhou-Nouwas, must have been the
work of several great princes ; and he names " Dhou-ons
or Dhou-nous, Dhoul Karnayn, Afrikis, Lokman," and others. The fact that traditions of events of such remote an
tiquity can still be found in Arabia is noteworthy ; but the ancient Arabian books that would give us an authentic
history of Dionysos had perished long before the Hellenes knew how to read and write.
We naturally expect to find references to Dionysos in the old Sanskrit Puranas. It is not to be supposed, how
ever, that the Sanskrit legends will correspond literally to any of those constructed in Egypt, Asia Minor, or ancient Greece. Saturn and Cronos, undoubtedly the same personage, and by the Greeks and Romans admitted to be so,
are differently portrayed in their mythical narratives. We must be prepared to find in all such legends not only the very ancient facts that made them possible, but also the
peculiar spirit, genius, and hero-worship of the composers. Some Oriental scholars have sought to identify Dionysos with the Sanskrit Rama, but with no satisfactory result ;
for Rama was undeniably a native of India, and a prince
of the ancient kingdom known to us as Oude. He was much more modern than Dionysos. The most probable identification is that of Wilford, who finds Dionysos in the great and heroic sovereign celebrated in the Puranas as



Dionysos in India. 287
Nahusha, or Deva-Nahusha, and evidently referred to times more ancient than the Aryan immigration. Wilford points
out that Deva-Nahusha is connected with " the oldest history and mythology in the world." He is said to have
been a contemporary of Indra, king of Meru, who was also deified, and who appears Jn the Yeda as a principal form or representation of the Supreme Being. The warmest
colors of imagination are used in portraying the greatness of Deva-Nahusha. For a time he had sovereign control
of affairs in Meru ; he conquered the seven dwipas, and led his armies through all the known countries of the world ; by means of matchless wisdom and miraculous heroism, he
made his empire universal. Wilford says : "It is declared in the Puranas that, when Deva-Nahusha
had conquered the world, he visited the seat of his grand
ancestor, Atri, on the Lesser Meru ; and, being uneasy to see it neglected, he sent for Yivasa-Carma, the chief engineer of the gods, and ordered him to build on the spot a superb city which he called after his own name, Deva-Na
husha-Niagara, which is accurately rendered Dionysipolis in Greek. It is called, also, Nahusham, Nahusha, and Nausha, from which the Greeks made Nysa. Nahusha is better known in Hindustan by the emphatic appellation of
Deva-Nagara, the divine city. Not a single vestige remains of this ancient Nahusha or Nysa." In the fourteenth
volume of the " Asiatic Researches" is the following quo
tation from Sig. Bayer relative to a passage in a Sanskrit
geographical work :
" Mention is made of the town called Nisadaburam in the Tamul dialect, but in Sanskrit Nahushapur or Naushapur, from an ancient and famous king of that name, more generally called Deva-Nahusha and
Deo-Naush in the spoken dialects. He appears to be the



288 Pre-Historic Nations.
Dionysos of our ancient mythologists, and reigned near Mount Meru."
Wilson, the English Orientalist, writing on the Dionys
iacs of Nonnus, after showing that Rama was not Dionysos, attempts to discredit the view set forth by Wilford, but without producing any substantial reason for doing so. He urges that "the history oiT^ahusha has nothing in common with that of Bacchus ;" and he might have added
that the Bacchus of the Greeks, to whom he refers, had
nothing in common with Dionysos. A just appreciation of Hellenic mythology should qualify any scholar to make a proper use of this fact. The Greeks distorted the story of Dionysos, and transformed him into their Bacchus, the son of Semele, whom they celebrated as the rollicking and drunken god of wine. It was their custom to reconstruct and misuse the old Cushite mythology whenever they foil
ed to understand it, or sought to appropriate it entirely to themselves. Why should Deva-Nahusha resemble the Greek Bacchus ? Professor Wilson should not have made it necessary to :isk this question. He should have seen without effort that such a resemblance would have made it impossible to iden
tify him with Dionysos. Moreover, no one who studies
and comprehends the mythical legends of different nations will expect to find exact resemblances in different portrayals of the history and character of the same personage. But in this case there is no such lack of reseinblan will justify Professor Wilson's criticism, while in certain
respects the resemblances are very striking. It may be added that Wilford had made the Puranas his chief study,
and had gained a more extended and thorough knowledge of the mythical legends of India than any other Oriental



The Indian Myths. 289
scholar of his time. It could not fail to bring important aid to our studies of antiquity if some other competent Sanskrit scholars would emulate his enthusiasm for this
kind of investigation. In Wilford's view, these passages in the Sanskrit books, and many others of similar purport, were important. He saw in them actual recollections of the earliest period of
Egyptian history. That they show actual knowledge of the country is very plain, and I can find no good reason to
deny that their historical significance is equally incontest
able. It would be more satisfactory to have an authentic history of the times to which they refer; but this is im
possible. We must be content with such light as can be found in traditions and myths, and may feel safe in believ
ing, with Humboldt, that " myths, when blended with his
tory and geography, cannot be regarded as pertaining wholly to the domain of the ideal world."
We can see in the old Sanskrit books that the Indo-Ary
ans borrowed extensively from the aboriginal inhabitants of India materials* to enlarge their own Pantheon, and en
rich the legendary lore that supported and glorified their religious institutions. Thus Siva became one of their chief gods ; thus came into their Puranas and Epic Poems old
legends, traditions, and mythical personages that did not belong to their history, and had, originally, no connection with their race. This borrowing must have begun very
early ; not later, certainly, than the beginning of that mixture of the two races in which the "Aryan color" was lost.
It appears in the great Epic Poems ; we find it everywhere in the Puranas ; it is one of the most important and signifi
cant facts in the religious history of the Indo-Aryans ; and,
unless it is fully appreciated, a proper understanding of
N



290 Pre-Historic Nations.
their mythical lore is impossible. In many cases, this appropriation was carried so far as to include the aboriginal
inhabitants themselves. Manu, describing certain aborig
inal peoples, maintains that they were originally Khastri
yas, or people of the military caste, who had sunk to be
Urishalas, or Sudras, "through the extinction of sacred rites, and from having no communication with Brahma us."'
He Specifies the " Paundrakas, Odras, Dravidas, Kambojas, Yavanas, Sakas, Paradas, Pahlavas, Chinas, Kiratas, Daradas, and Khasas." The Mahabharata adds to this list the
Kalindas, Pulindas, and others, as people who were formerly Khastriyas, but "have become Sudras from seeing no Brahmans." [See Muir's Sanskrit Texts, vol. i., p. 177.] This doctrine was inspired by the policy that aimed to
bring the Dasyus, or native inhabitants, especially those w"ho had been admitted into the caste of Khastriyas, to reverence Brahmanism and submit to its authority.
We can see in the legends that Puriiravas, Xahusha, and others, had no connection with Sanskrit history. They arc referred to ages very long anterior to the Sanskrit immigration, and must have been great personages celebrated
in the traditions of the natives, or Dasyus. It was not to
glorify these personages that they were introduced into the Sanskrit legends, but rather to show that, great as
they were, terrible punishments fell upon them because they failed to reverence the Brahmans. Brahmans did not
exist in their time, but this made no difference. The na
tive legends were reconstructed, and the Brahmans were made to figure in them as supreme lords of the world, to
whom the mightiest must submit, whether Aryan or Da
syu. Puriiravas was a king " of great renown, who ruled over thirteen islands of the ocean." Being "altogether



Antiquity of Dionysos. 291
surrounded by inhuman (or superhuman) persons," he engaged in a contest with Brahmans and perished. Nahusha, mentioned by Manu, and in many legends, as famous for hostility to the Brahmans, lived at the time when Indra
reigned on earth. He was a very great king, " who ruled
with justice a mighty empire," and attained the sovereign
ty of three worlds. Being " intoxicated with pride," he
was arrogant to Brahmans, compelled them to bear his palankeen, and even dared to touch one of them with his foot, whereupon he was transformed into a serpent.
According to Herodotus, the Egyptians placed Dionysos, by them called Osiris, near the close of that period of their
history which was assigned to the gods. Conversing in a temple with the priests, he was told that 341 kings had
reigned in Egypt previous to the time of his visit, and their images or statues were shown in a chamber of the temple.
He was told that, at first, " gods had been rulers of Egypt ;
and that Orus, son of Osiris, whom the Greeks call Apollo,
was the last. Now Osiris, in the Greek tongue, means
Bacchus." It is explained, also, that Osiris, or Bacchus,
" was not one of the eight gods called original," nor one of the four subsequently added to these ; he was of the third
order, being one of those in the early unrecorded ages (cer
tainly without record, and very mythical in the time of
Herodotus), "who were sprung from the twelve gods;" that is to say, he was a human sovereign to whom divine honors w^ere awarded after death. In all this we have, at
least, the fact that in Egypt the time of Dionysos was
placed at a very remote period, at a very early age, in Egyptian history, which agrees with the Indian and other Asiatic legends that made him contemporary with Indra and Zeus.

MYTHOLOGY AXD MYTHOLOGICAL PERSONAGES.
Ernest Renan, in his work on the Semitic Languages, assumes that "monotheism sums up and explains all the
characteristics" of the genius of the Semitic race, and that
this race gave monotheism to the other races. Even " In
dia," he says, " which has thought with so much originality and profoundness, has not yet reached monotheism." Tins
theory, which is encouraged by certain tendencies of our
education, may be very convenient for use in eloquent generalizations ; but it does not accord with facts. It plainly contradicts what we know of the Aryan race. For instance, Professor Rawlinson, in his account of the ancient
religion of the Persians, recognises clearly that it presented a very admirable form of monotheism. He says :
" Evidently the Jews and Aryans, when they became known to
each other, recognised mutually the fact that they were worshippers of the same Great Being. Hence the favor of the Persians towards the Jews, and the fidelity of the Jews towards the Persians. The Lord God of the Jews being
recognised as identical with Ormazd, a sympathetic feeling
united the peoples." [See his " Five Monarchies."] The Desatir, or fragment of the Dcsatir, found among
the Parsees, is certainly very old, whatever may be thought of it in other respects; and its claim to antiquity is supported by internal evidence. The first books inculcate the
purest monotheism, with a very simple and inartificial sy>tem of religious worship, while the later books show this
religion considerably modified by the influence of planet worship. Monotheism was never taught more distinctly, in any age or by any race, than in the first book of the
Desatir, called " the Book of the Great Abad."



Ancient Aryan Monotheism. 293
Mythology implies monotheism, and cannot be intelli
gently explained without it. How can anything be reverenced or thought of as a manifestation of the Supreme Be
ing where there is no faith in a Supreme Being ? It does
not follow that peoples of the Aryan race are incapable of
seeing the unity of God, because they have brought to religion the highest and most active faculty for poetry and philosophy. Can Renan find anything more distinctly present in the oldest hymns of the Rig-Veda than belief
in God and perception of right and wrong ? One of these
hymns, referring to the Supreme Being, speaks of him as
follows : " They call [Him] Indra, Mitra, Yaruni, Agni ; then he is the well-wr inged heavenly Garutmat ; that which
is One the wise call in many ways ; they call it Agni,
Yama, Matarisvan." We read in the Orphic Fragments that all the gods were one alone :

which means that one god are Pluto, Persephone, Demeter, Venus, Cupid, Triton, Nereus, Tethys, Neptune, Hermes, Vulcan, Pan, Zeus, Hera, Artemis, and Apollo. Mythology was brought into existence by recognising the sun, the stars, the forces of nature, and great heroes and sages, as manifestations of some attribute or activity of this one
God. No form of religion had a wider or more powerful
influence in the great pre-historic past than planet worship,

with its phallic and orphic accompaniments ; and yet it would have been impossible without monotheism. It was based on the idea of one Supreme Being, who was symbol
ized or manifested in the sun and the stars, and from whom
proceeded the vital forces of nature. It was easy to include among these divine manifestations great heroes and
sages, whose influence as deliverers, civilizers, reformers, or rulers, seemed to regulate the destiny and determine the
history of peoples where they appeared. A great king or sage, whose life and influence filled and swayed nations, seemed to stand far above ordinary mortals, and thus, after his death, easily became honored as a form or manifestation
of the Supreme Being, or of some recognised and greatly venerated form of that Being. lie was a man, and, at the same time, more than man ; he was an incarnation, an avatar, a special embodiment of divine wisdom and power. Thus were men deified; thus was mythology created.
The Dabistan, citing old Iranian books, gives part of a conversation between a celebrated sage, named Dawir I larva r, and another person, in which they inquired whether prophets were higher in dignity than the sun. Dawir inaintaineil that they were not. They were superior to the
rest of the human race, but not greater than the sun. " Be
hold," said he, " what an amount of light is diffused by the solar globe, whereas the bodies of your saints are de>ti
tute of splendor; therefore rest assured that his spirit i<
more resplendent than theirs. Know, besides, that the sun is the heart of the heavens; if he existed not, this world of formation and dissolution could not continue ; he brings
forth the seasons and the productive energies of nature; 7 ' therefore the sun was the highest and brightest manifestation of God known to mortal <.



Monotheism precedes Polytheism. 295
Polytheism can appear only where mythology has become so confused, corrupted, and debased, that the idea in which it originated has disappeared or become obscured. I cannot suppose that polytheism ever was, or ever could
be, the first form of religion among any people, for in every case where there are records or monuments to show the
earliest religious faith of any people, we find in it the least
obscured form of monotheism, with the simplest system of religious worship. Compare the oldest hymns of the RigVeda with the later developments of Brahmanism, or the religion of the oldest Iranian books with that of the later age, when Ecbatana stood with its seven differently colored
walls, symbolizing the religious system of its inhabitants, or the oldest religion that can be traced in Egypt with
that of later times.
But Dionysos, or Osiris, has led me to a discussion of mythology, which requires a volume rather than a few par
agraphs. What I have said may serve to explain how he
became a personage of mythology. The Egyptians, and all others who speak of him, tell us he was a human sover
eign, the greatest known when he lived, and reverently deified after his death. "We have no right to take any other view of him. Dionysos was a great monarch of the Cushite Arabians. He seems to represent the epoch when the
Cushite race, extending their conquests, gained entire control of the northern 'and central countries of India. This
occurred long ages before the Aryans went there, and many ages lay between that time and the period when
Menes began the Old Monarchy of Egypt. When Dionysos reigned in Arabia, both India and Egypt were prov
inces of his empire. He has been introduced here because his power seems to have been used in the wisest and



Pre-Historio Nations.
most beneficent manner to develop the civilization of the
Egyptians, for this must be the reason why, as Osiris, lie
was so intimately associated with the religious thought
and feeling of that country.
THE AGES BEFORE MENES.
It is not certain that Menes was the first king of united Egypt His name heads all the lists, but there is no conclusive reply to those who maintain that this happens merely because he is the earliest king whose name has been
preserved on the monuments still existing, and, consequently, the earliest known to the later Egyptian annalists; for we have neither record nor inscription to show that lie was actually the sovereign who united Upper and Lower Egypt, or that he was not preceded by other sovereigns
of the " Two Countries." We must, however, accept Menes
as the first king, for Egyptian chronology begins with him, and, according to Manetho, the regular history of united Egypt began with his reign. From his time onward then?
is nothing mythical, nothing improbable, nothing that is not supported by inscriptions found in the ruins. Ernest Renan, reviewing the discoveries of M. Marietta
[Revue des Deux Mondes, tome 56], points out that Egypt at the beginning appears mature, old, and entirely without mythical and heroic ages, as if the country had i known youth. Its civilization has no infancy, and its art
no archaic epoch. This was true of Egypt in the time <>f Menes. The civilization of the Old Monarchy did not le
gin with infancy. It was already mature. But Egypt did not begin with the age of Menes. There was already a very
long past in the history of the country when it was united
under one government, which consisted, first, of the



The Date of Dionysos. 297
during which the " Two Countries" existed under separate
governments ; and, second, of the vaguely indicated mythical ages, when, it is said, Egypt was governed by gods and demigods. The first colonists settled in Egypt were
undoubtedly civilized; but the country had an infancy, and its art an archaic period, which would be found if
there were history to take us back far enough beyond the Old Monarchy and its monuments to reach them.
Megasthenes, reporting Indian traditions, stated that Dionysos founded the first ^regular monarchy in India, and that he was revered as the sole ruler of the country during the three years he remained there. It is added that, when he left, he established on the throne Spartembas, one of the princes who attended him, and who was most honored
with his regard and confidence. Spartembas, having reign^ ed fifty-two years, was succeeded by his son Budyas, who reigned twrenty years, and was succeeded by Cradevas; and this dynasty continued to flourish in regular lineal
descent for many generations. He reckoned 6042 years between Dionysos and Alexander an estimate that is more likely to be too small than too large. Could we go back to that age, and visit the countries on the Nile, we^
should be likely to find Egypt in its infancy. Many inves
tigators, however, are usually more frightened at the mention of such dates than disposed to accept and comprehend
the antiquity they indicate. There is always a tendency to reduce dates and contract the past, even when investi
gators are guided by a free spirit and an honest purpose, because there is always some failure to realize and appreciate the whole extent of remote ages that have become
more or less mythical.
Although we have neither history nor chronology of
N

298 Pre-Historic Nations.
Egypt previous to Menes, yet we can not avoid the ten
dency to inquire concerning those earlier ages. They cannot be measured ; but the records tell us of a dynasty of
ten Thinite kings who reigned in Upper Egypt, and of one or two dynasties that reigned in Lower Egypt, before
Menes appeared ; and the previous history of the " Two Countries" appears to have been very long. There were
still earlier ages, in which demigods and men were rulers ;
and at the beginning, a vast period created by cyclical invention, in which "the gods reigned." Bunsen believed
the history of Egypt previous to Menes was longer than that after his time. Without accepting Bunsen's belief, we
can see plainly that the previous history was very long, and understand very well why the civilization of the coun
try was mature, and even old, at the beginning of the Old
Monarchy. Learned and thoughtful Egyptologists generally agree
that the empire of Menes in his own time " evidently rest
ed on a basis of previous centuries," during which there had been gradual and great development of civilization
and national character; for the people of that country, al
though previously divided into separate communities, were
essentially the same in religion, ideas, character, and enlightenment. Under Menes they were already a numerous, enlightened, and powerful people, and not at all a barbarous nation just emerging from the darkiu >< and disorder
of savage life. They had letters, science, and art. Lepsius
.
" We learn from the historical accounts relating to
the first dynasties, which are still preserved, that even at
that time they had ' Annals of the Monarchy? " Some of the greatest remains of the Old Monarchy, that chow the
highest style of Egyptian art, and still engage the wonder



Antiquity of Egyptian Civilization. 299
of mankind, belong to those first dynasties. Under the fourth dynasty, when the two great pyramids were built, the nation seems to have approached the highest glory of that wonderful development of intelligence and power to
which, after the flight of nearly 6000 years, the ruins still bear witness, and to which they will continue to bear wit
ness for ages to come. The foundations of this greatness were not the work of miracle, therefore they were not laid in a day or a year. They were the result of many ages of preparation in the
life, growth, culture, and general condition of the people. It is very true that the Cushite colonists who settled in
Upper Egypt brought letters and civilization from their
native country, and that their growth to great eminence as a nation was not like that of a people that rises from bar
barism by the energy of its own genius, and develops a great civilization. It is not certain, however, that any people, since the first ages of the world, has risen in this way
without the aid and incitement of external influences. No
people that has become enlightened, since the first ages, was left unvisited by such assistance. But the civilization of Egypt in the time of Menes had assumed a striking in
dividuality of its own. It had become essentially Egyptian. It was already what we find it in the monuments and
ruins. This transformation, necessarily gradual and almost
imperceptible in its progress, required a long period of time ; therefore centuries of Egyptian life and development must have preceded the beginning of the Old Mon

relations, and influences of the physical nature in which
they lived, was manifest in everything. Ages of gradual and unconscious development had established harmony be
tween people and country. It appeared even in their admirable system of monumental writing, which, without
explanation of its origin, showed already its highest perfection in the oldest ruins. Professor Lepsius says of it :
" From the choice of the pictures in the hieroglyphics,
and from other reasons, it appears entirely justifiable to suppose that this wonderful picture-writing of the Egyptians was formed, with reference to its peculiar character
istics, in Egypt itself, without any other influence from
abroad, although they may have brought the first beginning of it from their original home in Asia. But that a
people should produce anything so perfect as this system of writing, which embraces at once all the stages of human
writing, from the* most ideographical symbolic writing through syllables, to the equally direct notation of sound by means of vowels and consonants, certainly indicates a
long previous development." [Introduction to " Die Chronologic der JEgypter.]
ANTIQUITY OF WRITING IN EGYPT.
In no other old nation of which we have suflicient knowl
edge to form an opinion on this point was the art of writ
ing so perfect or so largely used as in Egypt, especially for memorial and historical purposes. "Their temples
were almost covered with inscriptions ; all buildings erected to the gods, to the kings, and to the dead, had repre
sentations and inscriptions on all the walls, ceilings, pillars, architraves, friezes, and posts, inside as well as outside." And their book literature seems to have been correspond

tian history that still remain. Diodorus Siculus, i., 49,
describes a great library of Rameses the Great, whom he calls Osymandyas, whose time was in the fourteenth century before the Christian era. The rooms of this library were in the temple of Rameses at Thebes, and they have
been found, recognised, and described by Champollion and
by Lepskis. The latter says, in his " Letters from Egypt :"
" The description of this splendid building given by Diodorus may still be traced from one chamber to another among its ruins. At the entrance behind which, accord
ing to Diodorus, the library was situated Champollion
perceived, on both sides, the representation of Thoth, the god of wisdom, and of Saf, the goddess of history ; then, behind the former, the god of hearing, and behind the lat
ter, the god of seeing. Several hieratical papyri which we
still possess are dated from the ' Rameseion,' and it is also
frequently mentioned in the so-called historical papyri. I found in Thebes the tombs of two librarians of the time
of Rameses .the Great, and therefore probably belonging to the library described by Diodorus. They were father and son. The father was called Neb-nufre, the son Nufrehetep, and they both bore the titles of her scha tit,
' Superior over the Books,' and naa en scha tu9
' Chief over the Books.' We have good reason to believe this library, of
which we have incidentally still farther mention, was not the first nor the only one. Thoth and Saf bear among their fixed titles, not only here, but on other monuments of all classes, the former that of Master, and the latter that of Mistress of the Hall of Books ; consequently the idea of
gods of libraries had long been familiar to the Egyptians. "



302 Pve-IIistoric Nations.
Books, and collections of books, in Egypt, were undoubt
edly, like the art of writing itself, much older than Menes. Among a people whose monuments show such an eminent
degree of the " historical sense," we may suppose that his
torical productions in the form of Annals, written and pre
served in the temples, were the first writings. That old
literature has all, or nearly all, perished, Nevertheless
there still exist some Egyptian manuscripts that were writ

Then Egypt had books and libraries in abundance ; the old Annals still existed in the temples, and a priest at Sais said to Solon, with entire confidence in the truth of his statement, "You Greeks are novices in knowledge of antiquity. You are ignorant of what passed, either here or among
yourselves, in days of old. The history of 8000 years is deposited in our sacred books ; but I can ascend to a much higher antiquity, and tell you what our fathers have done
for 9000 years I mean their institutions, their laws, and their most brilliant achievements."
Neither Solon, who listened to this statement, nor Plato, in whose writings it has been preserved, considered it improbable. They saw no reason why it could not be true. Neither can we. It would have been surprising if the
Egyptians, at that time, had not still preserved old records of the early periods of their history ; and whatever we, in
presence of excited chronological dogmatism, may allow
ourselves to think of the " 8000 years," we cannot reason
ably bring ourselves to deny that the early history of that country extended through many centuries beyond th> of Menes.



Mr. Hornets Investigations. 303
ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE EGYPTIAN ANTIQUITY.
In modern times attempts have been made to throw
light on the antiquity of Egypt by determining the age of the alluvial deposit that forms the Nile Valley, of which the most important is that of Mr. Leonard Horner, between the years 1851 and 1854. These attempts have proceeded
on the hypothesis that the age of the deposit, at any given point, could be discovered by first ascertaining the average depth of the accumulation in a single century, and then measuring the whole depth of the alluvium. Mr. Horner
undertook this work at the suggestion of the Royal Society of London, and the necessary funds were furnished by this
society and by Abbas Pacha, the viceroy of Egypt. Having secured the most competent assistants, he penetrated and explored the alluvium in different places by means of
ninety-five pits or shafts and artesian borings. Fifty-one of these shafts and borings were on a line crossing the valley from east to west, between the Arabian and Libyan deserts, in the latitude of Heliopolis, and twen
ty-seven of them on the parallel of Memphis. The character of the deposit was uniform from top to bottom. The
bones of quadrupeds were found, such as the ox, hog, dog,
dromedary, and ass, all belonging to living species, which shows that the formation of the Nile belongs to what ge
ologists call the Recent Period. Jars, vases, pots, a small
human figure in burnt clay, a copper knife, burnt bricks, and other articles of human manufacture, were found, some of them near the bottom of the alluvium. Brick and pot
tery were found everywhere and at all depths, sometimes sixty feet below the surface, showing that men who used such things must have occupied that valley as soon as any

part of it became habitable. It is not improbable, however, that some of the articles brought up from the lowest depths may have found their way into the sediment from
boats and other water-craft from the upper country, float
ing above it, when that part of the valley, or a large portion of it, was still covered with water.
New and interesting facts were brought to light by these
explorations, but they failed to settle accurately and conclusively the age of the Lower Nile Valley. The nearest approach to obtaining an accurate chronometric scale for
ascertaining the age of the first deposits of sediment at a'
given point was made near Memphis, at the statue of King Rameses. It is known that this statue was set up about the year 1260 before Christ. In 1854 it had stood theiv 3114 years, and during that tune the alluvium had accumulated around it to the depth of nine feet and four inches above its base, which was at the rate of about three and u half inches in each century. Mr. Homer found that the alluvium below the base of this statue was 30 feet deep. His excavations went down 32 feet, but the last two feet were through sand. Assuming the rate of accumulation previous to the erection of the statue to have been the same
as afterwards, it follows that the formation of the alluvium
began, at that point, about 11,660 years before the Christian Era. Bunsen places entire confidence in this est imuU-,
suirije-sting only that the period named is too short, because
the lower part of the deposit was more pressed together and compact than the upper part. At the statue, pottery was found within four inches of the bottom, and within sixteen inches of the bottom at another point 354 yards
distant from it. One thing is very clear, and does not need entire accu

racy in such measurements and estimates to make it more
so. These explorations show beyond question that the great structures of the Old Monarchy of Egypt, as well as
those of the New Monarchy, were built on a soil which had
been previously occupied, for a very long period, by a peo
ple who manufactured pottery, used copper, burnt brick, and had other appliances of civilized life ; and also that a very large part of the alluvium which forms the valley was accumulated between the beginning of that occupation and the building of those wonderful structures. Whether the first colonists went to Egypt more than 11,000 years before the Christian Era, as Bunsen supposes, which many will regard as romantic theory, or whether they went there at a later period, which appears more probable and more in accordance with other facts, it is nevertheless certain that the communities they established had a very long ex
istence, and, without doubt, an important history before
the " Two Countries" they created were united under one government, and began that great career of which we have an authentic chronology, and which can still be studied in its abundant monuments.

AFRICA AND THE ARABIAN CUSHITES.
In the popular estimation, Africa is almost wholly a con
tinent of savage negroes. Even intelligent people, who know something of Egypt, Abyssinia, and the Mediterranean coast of Africa, have entertained much the same notion of the whole interior and southern portions of the African continent. Until recently the inner regions were mostly unvisited by Europeans. They were covered with a veil of mystery. Their inhabitants were described by fancy, or were assumed to be the same in race, condition,
and character as those found, or, rather, those degraded and brutalized by slave-traders, on the coast of Guinea. In recent times Africa has been extensively explored by
t ravelers, and much has been dene to correct this misap
prehension. The means of gaining a better knowledge of both the geography and the inhabitants of that great and hitherto uncomprehended division of the globe are now abundant. Nevertheless, the difference between Africa as
portrayed by romancing ignorance, and Africa as described
by intelligent travelers, is not yet clearly understood by
many persons who claim to be enlightened. The old notion that Africa is chiefly a land of black savages arose from ignorance of the country, which could not
be removed, but, on the contrary, was heightened by slavetrading communication with the Western Coast. Slave
traders, whose operations were confined to the coast re



The People of Central Africa. 307
gions on the Gulf of Guinea, very naturally fostered this notion. They could not describe truthfully what came un
der their own observation, but they sought to excuse their
own frightful savagery by describing Africa as a land of negroes in the darkest and most hopeless condition of de
basement. When this had been repeated many times, they ventured to represent their kidnapping villanies as mis
sionary agencies, intent on transferring savages to Christian countries for their own good. It was absurd to expect valuable information from this source.
Moreover, but little knowledge of the African continent can be acquired by communication with that part of the Western Coast. There has been no exploration of the interior table-land from the coast of Guinea, and only one or
two travelers have penetrated the continent from any oth
er point on the Atlantic. All the great and successful ex
plorations of Central Airica have proceeded from the east and the north.
/
THE RACES IN AFRICA.
In point of fact, the great majority of the people inhabiting this grand division of the globe are not negroes. Peo
ple of the negro race meaning those described as " typ
ical negroes," with all others who closely approach this type occupy but a small part of Africa. They dwell chiefly on the low coast-lands around the Gulf of Guinea, but are found in a few other narrow districts in different parts of the continent. Whether their habitat was more
extensive and their number greater in remote pre-historic times cannot now be determined, although this seems implied by the extent of an evident mixture of this negro element with the blood of other African races. It is manifest



308 Pre-Historic Nations.
that Africa at a remote period was the theatre of great movements and mixtures of peoples and races, and that its interior countries had then a closer connection with the
great civilizations of the world than at any time during
the period called historical.
Africa, away from the coasts, is generally an elevated
table-land, mostly well watered, fertile, and healthy. The great body of its people consists of a brown or olive-col
ored race, occasionally described as the " Red Race," in which some travelers and ethnologists find a resemblance to the Malays ; but in Africa this race is seldom found en
tirely pure ; in every part of the country it shows very clearly the signs of intermixture with other races, both white and black. These signs of mixed blood have been noticed by travelers who have described this race, as I shall
presently show under another head. Dr. Livingstone calls attention to them while describing the brown race as he
found it at the south, and insisting that the " true type" of the African people is not that found on the "Western Coast. The Arabian Cushites appear to have found this dark brown or olive-colored race in India and on the islands of
the Indian Seas. In its original condition it may have
been primitive in both regions, but there is nothing to ex
plain either its origin or its history. Certain writers have maintained, with great confidence and some ingenuity, that the negroes of Africa are an ex
ceptional people, and not a distinct race. The theory is. that tribes of the brown race, settling in the low districts of the Western Coast, or in other malarious regions, will
gradually assume the negro type, being changed by peculiar physical influences permanently operating in such localities j or, to state it in the words of Mr. Reed, one of its



Theory on the Negro jRace. 309
advocates, "The true Africans, a red -skinned race, descending from the table-land into the swamps, become de
graded in body and mind, and their type is completely
changed." He describes a brown tribe, called "Fans,"
who have lately approached the coast of Guinea, and gives a lively picture of the change that awaits them. In the
course of a few generations, he imagines, their fine forms
will become ugly, their long, curling black hair will become
short, crisp, and woolly, and their fine, olive-colored com
plexion will turn to a coal black. This is pure hypothesis,
very entertaining, it may be, to its inventors, and full of friendship for another unsupported hypothesis that undertakes to explain the origin and early condition of the human race, but with no support save the ingenious devices
of fancy. The reply to its advocates is obvious, and sober reason must regard it as unanswerable.
In the first place, it must be said that for a long time
there has been quite too much exaggeration and extravagant over-statement relative to the assumed natural inferi
ority and degradation of the negro race in Africa. The
Negroes are chiefly on the Western Coast, where for ages they have felt the savage influence of slave-traders. De
basement could hot fail to be the -result; and yet, in the
portrayals of the most unscrupulous blackguard that has ever written in the interest of slave-traders, we can see that the negroes of the Guinea Coast are nowise inferior to
any other coast population of the country, where this brutalizing influence has controlled all intercourse between
the natives and Europeans. Nor can it be said. that, even as we know them, they are not superior to some of the more degraded families of the brown race, such as the
Saabs or Bushmen. When these Bushmen are under con



310 Pre-Historic Nations.
sideration, their physical and social degradation is not treated as an essential characteristic of their race ; nor is it
said by anybody that the great degradation of this family of the brown race has produced a new type of mankind. In the second place, if the negroes were not a distinct
race, the negro type would not be permanent. If they were, in reality, nothing more than tribes of the brown race, transformed by physical influences of the localities
where we find them, they could escape from this negro type and recover the lost traits of the race to which they
really belong by leaving the low lands and returning to
the upper country. Removal from the unfriendly regions
of swamp and miasma, where they have become " typical negroes," to the wholesome lands of the interior, or to other countries, would certainly be followed by a return
of the physiological peculiarities they have lost. The natural characteristics of the brown race would reappear;
the fine form, the long, curling hair, and the olive-colored complexion would come back to reveal and vindicate the race which the bad locality had obscured. Hut this never happens. No such return from the negro type to the brown type is ever seen, either in Africa or any
where else; therefore it is certain that the physiological peculiarities of the former are natural and permanent, and that they indicate a positive distinction of race. In the third place, such a law of transformation as this theory assumes would not confine its operations to the low
districts on the Gulf of Guinea. A natural law cannot be
capricious. Its operation is uniform. It is steady, sure, changeless, with nothing uncertain or doubtful in its influence. If there were a natural law by virtue of which the brown people of Africa are sure to become negroes if they



Muller on the Hindus. 311
settle near the coast on the Gaboon River, all similar regions would be inhabited by negroes. The same trans
forming power would be felt in the great valleys of the Amazon and the Oronoco, and there would have been more negroes in South America than in Africa. The red or
brown aborigines of the country could not have escaped
that influence. A negro race would have filled those val
leys in the earliest times, and they would have been found there in great numbers when the Spaniards discovered and
occupied the country. But they were not found there; they have never existed there as an aboriginal race.
A BKIEF ESSAY ON RACES.
Max Miiller, in his work on the ancient Sanskrit Litera
ture, speaks as follows :
" What authority would have been strong enough to convince the English soldier that the same blood was running in his veins and in the veins of
the dark Bcngalese ? And yet there is not an English jury nowadays which, after examining the hoary documents of language, would reject the claim of a common descent
and a legitimate relationship between Hindu, Greek, and Teuton."
This is in a strain that has been common since the dis
covery of the Sanskrit language ; it shows, however, that
in Mr. Htiller's mind hypothesis had not carefully adjusted
its relations with fact. The claim of " a common descent"
for Hindu, Greek, and Teuton might have been well founded, or at least not open to serious criticism, had it been urged four or five thousand years ago, while the Sanskrit
was still a spoken language, and the Indo-Aryans were not yet changed in race by intermixture with the dark-skinned people of India. It cannot now be admitted without im



312 Pre-Historic Nations.
p'ortant qualifications. The English soldier who rejects it
is more nearly right than the scholar who believes " the hoary documents of language" would constrain an English jury to uphold it. The scholar falls into mistake by attributing to the Hindus of our time what was peculiar to
the unmixed, Sanskrit-speaking Aryans of a former age. The native inhabitants of India now present, in their physi
ological characteristics, a remarkable mixture of races, in which Aryan blood is not the chief element; and this manifest mixture of unlike races extends, in some degree, even to the present dialects of India. In the matters of common blood and intimate ethnic relationship, the people of Hindustan now have more affinity with the Malays of the Indian Archipelago, and the Arabian people of Oman and Yemen, than with the British soldier. When we consider carefully the various peoples who inhabit the earth and constitute the human family, we cannot easily avoid the conclusion that great primal races
must be recognised, whose origin goes back to the first period of human existence. It is no part of my purpose to write a scientific essay on this topic, and undertake an
exact classification of the many varieties of mankind; but
there are physiological traits presented for consideration, so different and so strongly marked, and families of lan
guage so radically unlike, that their origin must have preceded even the first humble beginnings of civilization.
This is so plain, and appears to be so incontestable, that some eminent investigators have resorted to the hypothesis that the human race was originally brought into existence by the creation, in different parts of the earth, of several
independent and separate family groups, unlike in physical traits and in the conditions that determined the character



Original Races of Mankind. 313
of their language, but essentially and ineradicably the same in all the distinctive attributes of human nature it
self. This simplifies the question, and makes explanation
easy ; but in scientific inquiries such simplifications should be used with some caution, for they do not invariably furnish the safest way to just conclusions. It is, however, the
most reasonable hypothesis yet furnished by science, for it
recognises distinctly the " one blood," or natural fraternity of all the different families ofjnankind, and it does not,
like the " development theory," dishonor human nature by
denying the independent creation of man, and assigning
the origin of the human family to a " progressive development" of lower orders of the animal creation.
When we study, closely and reflectively, typical representatives of the unmixed Chinese, Malay, Negro, and
Aryan or Indo-European families, the conclusion seems inevitable that, while they all have the same human nature,
they represent very distinct primordial races. If they did
not, according to the simplest and readiest hypothesis, proceed from separately created family groups, they must have been completely separated and subjected to very unlike conditions of existence previous to the earliest movements of that development which produced even the lowest
forms of civilized life. This is clearly implied not only by the unlikeness of their physical traits, but also by such facts as the profound difference between the Chinese and
the Aryan languages. Whether science will at length fur
nish a clearer explanation, or, without farther explanation, leave the matter to such hypotheses as it has already suggested, I shall not undertake to say. It has rescued the question from the control of myth and fable ; it makes us
see that certain venerable assumptions have no foundation
O

in truth and no claim to respect; but the origin of the distinct races that constitute the human family is so covered with the darkness of ages beyond the reach of both history and authentic tradition, and presents so much that is now
entirely beyond the sphere of human experience, that science may never be able to substitute demonstration for its
most reasonable hypothesis. Moreover, the problem has some other difficulties. For
instance, the physiologicqj differences that separate the primitive races are not always coincident with radical dif
ferences of language. The families of mankind usually
classed as Aryans, Cushites, and Semites, with some of the peoples classed as Turanians or Scyths, in their original,
unmixed condition, are physiologically so much alike that the physiologist cannot show why they should not be
classed together as one race. And yet they are separated by three or four families of language, so radically different
that .1 common origin seems impossible. Linguistic science suspects, and may yet be able to show, that the Cushite and Semitic tongues are related, and that they may have proceeded from the same original source. But it finds n< such relationship between the Semitic and the Aryan fam
ilies, or between either of these families and the language
of the Magyars. Must the linguistic differem-rs in these
cases be made to signify original distinction of race? We turn away from this conclusion to find some other solution
of the problem ; we suggest that some of these peoples
may have changed their original speech, or that they sepa
rated from a common stock while their speech was yet un
formed, and developed language amid associations and controlling influences that had little or nothing in common; but there can be no such demonstration as will sat
isfy any close inquiry.



fiaces seldom found Pure. 315
Renan and some others have sought to show that the Semites have manifested a striking uiilikeness to the Ary
an and Cushite families in their development of religious ideas and civilization, but a great deal more is assumed than can be shown ; and Kenan's hypothesis that the Sem
ites originated monotheism is explicitly contradicted by what is known of the history of other races.
At the present time, the great primitive races of the human family are seldom found entirely pure. In the many countries of Asia and Europe, where the influence of civil
ization has been felt to any extent, it is not common to find communities where the blood of any of these races is found unmixed with that of one or more of the others. Throughout Southern Europe we find a mixture of two or three of the light-colored races, in which there is a considerable infusion of blood from the dark-skinned people of
Africa. Mixture of races is the rule throughout Central
and Western Europe. Russia is a country where peoples of one or two other races have been added to the aboriginal Finnic element. The Russian language belongs to the
Aryan family, but in the Russian people there is a very large infusion of blood which it does not represent. In Southwestern Asia, from India to the Mediterranean, the Aryan, Cushite, and Semitic races have lost or shaded their white color in mixture with the dark-skinned race that
seems to have been aboriginal in India and Eastern Africa.
It is now scarcely possible to find anywhere even a small community of unmixed Cushites the greatest, most influential, and probably the most numerous race of remote antiquity, whose home wns Arabia. But in no great division of the globe is the mixture of races more general or more remarkable than in Africa,



316 Pre-IRstoric Nations.
That it exists in the Valley of the Nile, from Abyssinia to
Egypt, and throughout Northern Africa, is well understood. The fact that a mixture somewhat different in
character, and more or less distinctly manifest, prevails throughout the interior, has not engaged so much attention. I shall speak of it more fully in another place, in connection with the many traces of their influence left in Africa by the old Arabian race.
Humboldt, in his Cosmos, speaks of "the distressing distinction of superior and inferior races." Certain dogmatic
writers on this subject, whose doctrines concerning "inferior and superior races" are revolting to reason and unsup
ported by fact, finding criticism and rebuke in these words of the eminent German whose science they cannot tion, have sought to break their force by treating them as
an " unfortunate" gush of " sentimentalism." Ilumboldt's Cosmos, however, is not a sentimental work, and nowhere
in it do we find a sineerer expression of his thought, <>r a
more deliberate criticism of an offensive method of treat
ing a great question. The doctrines relative to superior and inferior races, as
usually inculcated, arc not the product of serene science, nor of any calm influence of reason. They have sprung either from the arrogant egotism of the race that assumed
superiority) or from zeal in behalf of some institution, or of
some form of social or political organization, by which undeveloped races or humiliated peoples are maltreated and
tyrannously oppressed.
An elaborate and ingenious French work on the "Ine
quality of Human Races," written in the interest of the re
actionary party in Europe, sets forth the doctrine that the
downfall of nations is effected, not by luxury and enerva

tion, not by corruption of morals nor by any disastrous influence of misgovernment, but solely by the intrusion of in
ferior races into the positions of political influence that be
long exclusively to the superior governing races. This infallibly brings on degeneracy and ruin, because the blood of the proper governing class no longer flows in the veins of those who govern, or is debased by mixture with inferi
or blood. The subject classes, in the nations of Europe,
are the inferior races, and the old governing classes the superior races. They are useful to each other while each
keeps its proper place; but when the lower orders rise and a mixture of races takes place, the dangerous doctrines
of human brotherhood and equality in rights immediately appear, and the nation becomes degenerate.
" With the exception of what has passed in our time,"
says Count de Gobineau, " the idea of a natural, original, and permanent inequality of races has been the basis of
nearly all theories of government. The system of heredi
tary Castes, nobilities, and aristocracies has its origin in
this idea ;" but " when a mixture of the races takes place,
this idea is at once disputed, natural superiority is insulted, the right of the superior race to inherit dominion is denied,
and this dominion is stigmatized as a tyrannical usurpation of power. The mixture of castes obscures inequality, and
gives rise to the political axiom that all men are equal, and, therefore, entitled to the same rights. Indeed, since there
are no longer any distinct hereditary classes, none can just
ly claim superior merit and privileges." And " the political axiom that all men are brothers, and therefore equal,
which, like the bag of JEolus, contains so many tempests, is soon followed by the scientific."
Whereupon the gulf opens, and every thing sinks into

the bottomless pit of ruin. He means to say, chiefly, that
the governed people of Europe are inferior races, whose
claim to equality of rights must be sternly denied, and who must be rigidly excluded from any assumption of political influence. It is evident that, in his view, the an
cient order of things, with all that is included in what the
monarchies, the aristocracies, and the Church call civiliza
tion, is seriously threatened by that progress of republican ideas which aims to make the people supreme in the poli
tics of Europe. It is wholly the result of "ethnical chan
ges," which have been " slower and less considerable1 ' in
England than in any other European country, for England has preserved "to this day the basis of the social system of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries," while "in France the ethnical elements are more numerous, and the mixtures
more varied." This degeneracy, he thinks, is fearfully man
ifest in Paris, " whose population is a motley compound of all the most varied ethnical elements." Having no longer
any love or respect for ancient traditions, and bein prepared by the influence of inferior races, meaning the peo
ple, for " a complete rupture with the past," Paris has " hurried France into a series of political and social experiments, with doctrines the most remote from, and the most repulsive to the ancient customs and traditional tendencies
of the realm/' It seems expected that this doctrine, imi
tating the dignity of science and the speech of philosophy, will shame, confound, and paralyze the liberal tendencies
of Europe. The doctrine of superior and inferior races, in a different form, has been used to justify human slavery, and here the question is confined chiefly to the whin- ami the- black
races. The black race, it is assumed, is wholly incapable



The White and Black Races. 319
of developing civilization in any form, therefore the supe
rior white race, having a natural right to be its master, may enslave it, or subject its existence to any conditions
of serfdom which the governing wisdom of the natural
master may see fit to impose. It is no part of my purpose to discuss this doctrine at length. I may observe, how
ever, that ethnical speculations which aim to establish a
given conclusion are necessarily vitiated by this aim, and therefore cannot be trusted ; and that those who seek to
give this ethnical hypothesis the authority of science can
not avoid showing that they proceed " with a purpose," and never get beyond the sphere of violent opinions. Count de Gobineau, whose purpose did not require him to depreciate the black race, takes a very different view of it.
He maintains that, in the great civilizations of antiquity, the inspiration of poetry and art came from the black race.
The white race organized those civilizations, and estab
lished their laws and governments ; but " the source from whence their art issued was foreign to the instincts of the
organizing civilizers ; it lay in the blood of the blacks.
That universal powder of imagination, which we see envel
oping and penetrating the primordial civilizations, came entirely from the ever-increasing infusion of blood from the black race into that of the whites." Again: "The negro
possesses, in a high degree, the faculty of emotion from the senses, without which art is not possible." Once more :
" It will be said that I am placing a beautiful crown upon the deformed head of the negro, and doing him a very great honor by thus associating him with the harmonious choir of the Muses. But the honor is not so great. I have not
associated him with the highest, those in whom reflection
is superior to passion." And, finally, " Certainly the black



320 Pre-Historic Nations.
clement is indispensable to the development of artistic ge
nius in a race." [See De Gobineau's work, " Sur L'lnegalite
des Races Humaines," book ii., chap, vii.] It will be noticed that this view of the black race is different from that used to authorize enslavement of the
blacks ; but De Gobineau, who finds the influence of infe
rior races in European liberalism, did not study th black race to excuse scornful disregard of its rights, nor witli any view to the interests of slavery. Those who take a
Different course are not likely to agree with him, nor to acc'l-j t any other view save their own. Should we admit all that is claimed l>y certain writers
concerning superior and inferior races, it would not follow that we must also accept the logic by wrhich they undertake to show that inferiority has deprived the black race
of all right to any position in the human family above that of serfdom. Rights cannot properly be made to depend on a discrimination of this kind. In a justly-organized
state, the most imperial intellect can have no more rights before the law than the humblest. There is a duty of the
strong to the weak which requires something very differ
ent from the pretensions of mastership and the parade of
superiority, and there is some great deficiency in the civilization of that race or community by whii-h it is not prop
erly recognised. The logic of superiority that sets aside this duty would justify the enslavement of the weak, hum
ble, and unenlightened classes, in every state where they exist, without regard to race, and show that neither slavery, serfdom, nor any condition of abasement under the domination of privileged classes should be abolished anywhere.
But difference in faculty does not necessarily imply in
feriority. We are accustomed to assume, without he>ita

tion, that our race is of course superior to all other races
that differ from it in faculty or development ; in this, however, there may be quite as much egotism as reason. On what grounds can we safely assume that any race, no mat
ter how powerful it may seem to be, comprehends in the highest degree all the possibilities of human nature ? Probably we shall find it necessary to revise our conception of
what constitutes the superiority of a race. Wonderful
force to attack, subdue, and sway other peoples, distinguishes the faculty of our race, and this force is celebrated
in song and romance. But is this really the highest and
most admirable development of human nature ? We can
not reflect seriously without feeling that there, is something
nobler, something more beautiful, something more richly
fraught with blessing that increases the possibilities and heightens the charm of human existence, something that must necessarily revise our ideal of what is superior in
peoples and races. Reason requires us to believe that each race and each
distinct family of mankind has some peculiar gift of its
own, in which it is superior to others, and that the Allwise Creator may have designed that each race and family shall bring its own peculiar contribution to the final com
pleteness of civilization. A race or family is not necessarily inferior to others because it comes into the history
of civilization latest, nor superior because it appears there first. It was not our own proud Aryan race that created the great civilizations of Arabia, Chaldea, and the Old
Monarchy of Egypt. . Our race was preceded in development by others, and it was in times quite modern that our own family of the race took its place among the foremost.

able to comprehend. The marvelous force, energy, and
activity of our particular family of the Aryan race are establishing intercourse and the feeling of neighborhood
between " the ends of the earth." We are bringing the
races and peoples of the human family to that condition of mutual intercourse and appreciation which will teach all
races and families to dismiss the old talk of " outside barbarians," allow them to assume harmonious relations, and
prepare them to play connected parts in the grand work
of realizing the full-orbed, all-comprehending development of the whole united family of man.
THE ARABIAN CUSIIITES IX AFRICA.
That the ancient people of Arabia would pass over into
Africa nearly at the beginning of their colonizing movements is so probable that we readily accept it as true. They could not fail to do so. They would move across
the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, and advance not only northward down the Valley of the Nile, but also towards the
central and southeastern portions of the continent; for
t IK-SI- regions were attractive to enterprise, and would
necessarily add greatly to the resources and power of the
rising commercial people on the Erythraean Sea. The ancient Greeks inform us that what was so probable actually took place. They recorded the fact that the eastern countries of Africa became part of Ethiopia, and that they had been so described from time immemorial.
This designation is still used, somewhat indefinitely, to indicate regions in Eastern and Central Africa, although it is no longer applied to Arabia. The old Sanskrit books
f'irnish similar information. They tell us that the people
passed over into Africa, took possession of

the country, and established there a subordinate country of the Cushites, which they called the exterior Cusha-dwi
pa; agreeing with the Greeks, who say Ethiopia included
both Asiatic and African territory. Add to this that the Cushite race created Egypt, and carried their colonies and
civilization into every part of Northern Africa, and we can
see that its influence on this continent in pre-historktimes must have been very extensive.
We see this, also, in the fact that a majority of the inhabitants of Africa use dialects of the old Cushite or Ethi
opian languages. To this family belong the Berber dialects, spoken and written in all the provinces of Northern Africa, as far down as the southern border of the Sahara,
The old Egyptian tongue, and the languages used throughout the Valley of the Nile, in Abyssinia, and in Somaulia, have the same origin. It is known, also, that not only the
language, but, along with it, the religious ideas of that important people in Eastern Africa known as the Gallas, came originally from the Arabian Cushites. Dr. Krapf
states that the Gallas number " six or eight millions." He
says the word " Gallas" means " immigrants," and signifies their recent migration towards Abyssinia and the coast.
They call themselves " Orma," or " Oroma ;" therefore Dr.
Krapf designates the country they; occupy as "Ormania." It is very probable that dialects, derived from or modified by old forms of the ancient Cushite language, are used by
African peoples in the central and southern portions of th<
continent. Some linguistic scholars claim that the south
ern dialects 'belong to this family, and I see no reason to
doubt the correctness of their opinion. No form of any other language known to civilization, ancient or modern . has been found in Africa, save the modern Arabic. Tlu

prevalence of Cushite dialects is incontestable, and thig shows how extensively Africa was occupied by the Cush
ite race in the great ages of its power. The people of Arabia have been accustomed to traverse
Africa in every direction, from ages of which neither his
tory nor tradition can make any report. They are found
everywhere, east, west, north, and south ; usually as traders, ready to deal in slaves or in anything else that gives
a hope of profit, but frequently as a part of the settled population. Dr. Earth states that not less than 250,000 Arabians were settled in Bornou when he visited that king
dom, and that " this Arab population appears to have come
from the east at a very early period." In that part of Africa their policy is to conciliate- the favor of the Fulans.
To other peoples the interior of Africa has for ages been an unknown region, a land of mystery, of which nothing could be told beyond some Arabian notices of its geography. The only reasonable explanation of this extensive and long-continued intercourse of tin- Arabians with
the interior countries of Africa is that which assumes that
it was established by the ancient Cushite occupation, has never been discontinued.
"We do not always realize the whole significance of the fact that some of the most highly civilized nations of remote antiquity were in Northern Africa and in the Valley
of the Nile. The Old Monarchy of Egypt, to which belong
the grandest ages of that country, was brought to a close about 2100 years before the Christian Era, alter a duration
of 1 800 years. Meroe, very ancient, though not as old as the great Egyptian monarchy founded by Mcncs, was preceded by a much older and greater kingdom, described as
Barbara, a name still preserved in that part of Africa. It

is well known that, " from the earliest times, Meroe was the seat of a great commerce carried on by caravans from all parts of Northern Africa." The Cushite Arabians, who created these countries, continued to occupy Africa down to the latest days of their power. Is it reasonable to believe that neither these Arabians, nor the people of the
Nile Valley, explored Central Africa ? Nothing is more
improbable. On the contrary, it is evident that the an
cient Arabians occupied the lake regions, and carried their influence into the central countries as far west as Soudan ; and that they were accustomed to communicate with the
northern coast through the interior. Until lately, all we knew of Central Africa came to us through Arabian geographers. They could describe the sources of the Nile; and they told us of the Mountains of the Moon, which the moderns have not yet explored, nor even located with cer
tainty. The fact that ancient kings of Arabia marched armies through Africa to the ocean, and carried on wars with
Maghrib or Mauretania, is not left entirely to the historical traditions of Arabia for support. Strabo says in his first book, "It was mentioned as a tradition among the people of Tartessus that the Ethiopians once traversed the regions of Africa quite to its western limits, and that some of them came and settled at Tartessus." This must refer to times long before Gades was built. Central Africa, fer
tile, beautiful, and, in many respects, attractive in itself,
abounded in ivory, gold, and other productions adapted to engage the attention of a commercial people. If there were great navigable rivers flowing from Soudan to the
Indian Ocean, or if there were great gulfs extending from that ocean far into the central regions, the ancient history



3JO 7
of Africa would have been much more important. But the
Arabian Cushites, occupying the great lake regions, and
controlling the central countries, would naturally communicate with the coasts to any extent required by the inter
ests of their commerce ; and it is no more improbable that they were from time to time engaged in wars with "Ma
ghrib," than that, in more recent times, Muley Hamed, emperor of Morocco, should be engaged in wars with the
great Songhay Empire, which ut one time controlled near
ly all Central Africa.
TRACES OF AFRICAN ANCIENT HISTORY.
Modern exploration has shown clearly that the present condition of the great body of the African people is not that of normal barbarism, but rather a state of decline from
a better knowledge and use of the arts and appliances ot
eivili/ed lill>. The facts reported by modern travelers in
that part of the globe require us to believe that, in prehistoric times, some great influence of civilization was felt throughout nearly the whole African continent for many
ages, and that a large portion of the primitive African people were raised by this influence to some knowledge of the ways of civilized life. Traces of this influence are vi
ible everywhere; and, if there were nothing to indicate its origin, we could hardly fail to see that it must have come from Arabia.
Arts and methods of civilized life are common throughout Central, Southern, and Eastern Africa, that cannot be accounted for by anything in the present condition of the
people. The art of smelting ores and working metals is
not an accomplishment of savage life. It did not originate among barbarians. And yet this art is in common use in



Iron-working in Africa. 327
almost every part of Africa. Dr. Livingstone, giving an account of what he found in the regions near Lake Nyassa, makes this statement :
" At every third or fourth village
we saw a kiln-looking structure, about six feet high, and two and a half and three feet in diameter. It is a clay,
fire-hardened furnace for smelting iron. No flux is used,
whether the specular iron, the yellow hematite, or magnetic iron ore is fused, and yet capital metal is produced. Native manufactured iron is so good that the natives de
clare English iron ; rotten' in comparison ; and specimens of African hoes were pronounced at Birmingham to be nearly equal to the best Swedish iron." The method here described is almost precisely like that used in Southern In
dia. Dr. Barth makes similar reports of the prevalence of this art in Central Africa. He describes similar smelting furnaces found in Soudan, where they are common ; and those travelers who have explored the sources of the Nile
tell us that blacksmiths, workers of metals, and remarkable
skill in other manufactures, whose origin implies civilization, are common in that region.
Dr. Livingstone, in the account of his " Expedition to the Zambezi" already cited, describes articles manufactured
by the African people, and specifies " hammers, tongs, hoes, adzes, fish-hooks, needles, and spear-heads, having what is termed ' dish' on both sides, to give them the rotary motion
of rifle-balls." He admires their skill in spinning and weav
ing, and in manufacturing certain kinds of pottery similar
to pottery found in India. He points out that they have
admirably-made fish-nets " nearly identical with those now used in Normandy ;" a blacksmith's bellows like that used
in Central India; "fish-baskets and weirs like those used
in the Highlands of Scotland ;" and other implements like



328 Pre-Historic Nations.
those found in Egypt and India. He is sure that this
striking similarity of manufactured articles in widely-sep
arated countries articles " from identical patterns widely
spread over the globe" makes it very probable that the arts and usages of these different peoples were derived from the same source. Not seeing any other explanation, he
suggests that they may have been given by direct revela
tion from God. This hypothesis is reverent, but the very interesting fact to which he calls attention can be explained
without resort to miracle. The original instructor in these arts was the ancient Cushite civilization, which went into Africa from the east and the north, and was felt for a very
long period of time in all its central countries.
No less important are the facts relating to the social and
political condition of Central Africa, reported by Dr. Earth and other explorers. Throughout that extensive central
region called Soudan there is very effective political or
ganization, an active trade, and, in some districts, a remarkable condition of manufacturing industry. Here, in many places, Dr. Earth found the manufacture of cotton and LIT.-I.-S
clothes, very fine leather-work, and the working of metals, carried on very skilfully, and to a notable extent. Tlu simanufactures find markets not only throughout Central Africa, but also in the cities on the Mediterranean. lie

latahs. A remarkable condition of industrial enterprise was noticed not only in the city, but throughout the whole
district. Dr. Earth describes important kingdoms in Central Af



Central Africa has Written Histories. 329
rica whose history can be traced back nearly to the begin* ning of the Christian Era, and which are doubtless much
older. These kingdoms have had considerable civilization, that is shown to have been greater in ancient times than
it is at present. In Ghasr-eggomo, anciently the capital of Bornou, but now a mass of ruins, the principal buildings
were made of brick ; but " in the present capital not the
smallest approach is made to this more solid mode of ar
chitecture." Dr. Barth adds : " It cannot be doubted that the old capital contained a great deal of barbaric magnificence, and even a certain de
gree of civilization, much more than is at present found in
this country. It is certainly a spectacle not devoid of in* terest to imagine, in this town of Negroland, a splendid court, with a considerable number of learned and intelli
gent men gathering around their sovereign, and a priest writing down the glorious achievements of his master." Written chronicles of Bornou, and of some of the other
kingdoms, still exist, although the Fulans have sought to destroy them. Dr. Barth says :
" Books containing a com
prehensive history of the kingdom of Katsena have been destroyed intentionally by the Fulbe or Fulans since their
conquest of the country. One tradition connects the origin of the kingdom of Bornou with the Himyarite kings of Arabia. Other traditions say it was founded by white Ber
bers, which, of course, means that it was created by influences proceeding from the old Cushite or Phoenician com
munities of Northern Africa. The records state that Selma, the first black or dark-colored monarch of Bornou, began
his reign in the year 1194 A.D., many centuries (no record
tells certainly how many) after the kingdom was founded. That the central countries of Africa were occupied or



330 Pre-Historic Nations.
controlled in ancient times by a civilized white race is
shown by the physiological peculiarities of the present inhabitants. The people of those countries present everywhere a remarkable mixture of races. The blood of the
original brown race, with its fine forms, long curling hair, and dark olive complexion, predominates in this mixture, and sometimes it is found nearly pure. It is, however, common to find it mixed with that of both the white and
the negro races. I am'not speaking of the Berbers, the na
tive Egyptians, the Nubians, the Abyssinians, nor even of the Gallas. I refer only to that great body of the native
population of Africa represented by the Fulans and tho Bechuanas. All these people show traits of a common ori
gin. They are divided into classes or nationalities, and
called by different names, although the difference between
them is less than is often created among people of the same ethnic family by time and circumstances. The Abyssin
ians, Egyptians, and Berbers are white men mixed with the brown race of Africa. The Fulans, Bornese, and Bechuanas are this brown race, more or less mixed with the oth
er races. Traces of white blood in the African people, more or
less distinct, are found everywhere, away i'mm the We>tern Coast. They have been noticed by all travelers,
though not always clearly explained. Dr. Barth, being at a village in Adamwa, wrote thus of this mixture of races:
"I was struck by the symmetry and beauty of their forms,
and the regularity of their features; but I was still more
astonished at their complexion, which was different in <li!'
ferent individuals, it being in some a glossy black, and in others a light copper." He adds, "The same variety has been observed in many other tribes, as well on this continent as in Asia."



Mixture of Races in Africa. 331
Dr. Livingstone's attention has been drawn to the same
physiological peculiarity in the people farther south, where not only mixture with the black race is apparent, but also striking traits that must have been inherited from a white
race. He points out carefully that the true type of the
African people " is not that found on the West Coast, from which most people have derived their ideas of the Afri
can," and, in his descriptions of the brown race, shows us traces of the mixture of races so manifest in other parts
of the continent. Speaking of Chinsamba, ruling chief of the Manganjas, he says: "He has a Jewish cast efface, 01 rather the ancient Assyrian face, as seen in the monu
ments brought home by Mr. Layard. This face is very common in this country. The majority of the heads here are as well shaped as those depicted in the ancient As
syrian and Egyptian monuments."
The same variety of complexion, with other physical characteristics denoting mixture, is described by those who have visited the lake regions near the sources of the
Nile. For instance, Mr. Burton says of the Wagogo: "Many of them are as fair as Abyssinians; some of them are as black as negroes;" and he describes the Watosi as
"tall, comely, and comparatively fair." The ruling and aristocratic class in the countries near these lakes, called
"the Wahuma," greatly resemble the Abyssinians, although some of them have a darker color ; and there is no reason to doubt that the Wahuma, like the Abyssinians and the
U alias, represent the ancient Cushite Arabians, mixed in a,
greater or lesser degree With the dark-colored people of
.Africa. The Wahuma have a tradition that Africa former
ly belonged to white men, and they claim to represent the blood of these ancient white rulers of the land.



332 Pre-Historic Nations.
At the present time, the most numerous and powerful
people in Central Africa, south of the region occupied by the Berbers, are the Fulans, a people remarkable there for
their intelligence, skill, and restless ambition. Their influ
ence is already established at many of the more important points, from Senegambia to the Nile, near the western bor
der of Abyssinia, and especially in Soudan. They seem likely to become supreme in all the central countries.
Every traveler in that part of Africa describes the Fulans,
and speculates vainly concerning their history. They re
semble, substantially, the great body of the brown race of the continent, and show the same traces of mixture with
other races. Dr. Barth says of them :
" If any African tribe deserves the full attention of the
learned European, it is that of the Fulbe (sing. Pullo), or
Fula, as they are called by the Mandingoes ; *Fellani (sing.
Bafellanchi) by the Hatisa people, Fellata by the Kanuri,
and Fulan by the Arabs. No doubt they are the most in
telligent of all the [Central] African tribes, although in bodily development they cannot be said to exhibit the
most perfect specimens. It is their superior intelligence that gives their chief expression to the Fulbe. But as to
their outward appearance, which presents various con
trasts in complexion as well as bodily development, we must first take into account that the Fulbe, as a conquer
ing tribe, sweeping over a wide expanse of provinces, have absorbed and incorporated with themselves different and quite distinct national elements."
The Fulans, on account of their prominence and impor
tance, have been a topic of much speculation. One or two writers have assumed that they were not originally
an African people. M. Eichwaldt published an essay in



Origin of the Fulans. 333
the Journal de la Societe Ethnologique for 1841, in which
he sought, by cleverly managed assumption and hypothesis, to connect them with the Malays by way of Meroe. Dr. Barth says :
" I myself am of opinion that their origin is to be sought in the direction of the east ; but this refers
to an age which, for us, is enveloped in unpenetrable dark
ness. * * There may be some remote affinity between the Ftilbe and the South African tribes, but this refers to an age probably not later than the rule of the Pharaohs."
The Fulans, nevertheless, are only a branch of the race found everywhere in Central, Eastern, and Southern Africa. Whatever shall explain their origin will explain that of the whole race.
Within the historical period, and since the beginning of the Christian Era, there has been more civilization in Africa than exists at the present time. Dr. Barth shows that Bornou, in Central Africa, has declined from a higher condition of civilization. The ruins of its former capital,
its historical literature, and other facts still apparent to
those who observe that country carefully, make plain, that not many centuries have passed since there was in Bornou
a higher knowledge and practice of the builder's art, a
more effective political organization, considerable literary culture, and a better condition of manufactures and commerce. That old tradition of the people which connects
the origin of this kingdom with the Himyarite sovereigns of Arabia, whether correct or incorrect, is not without sig
nificance. There is much in the history of Arabia, as well
as in the present condition of Africa, to show that the Cushite Arabians occupied Central Africa in very remote
times.
There is a great difference between the present condi



334 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
tion of Eastern Africa and that in which it was found by
the first Europeans who visited the Indian Ocean. Vas
quez di Gama wrote an account of his first voyage, but the manuscript was lost, probably in a dust-hole of some old library. One or two narratives of the voyage, written by
other persons, have been printed. We know that the Por
tuguese found in that part of Africa two important kingdoms, Quiloa and Monomotapa, which excited their admiration and their covetousness ; and also that there was constant commercial intercourse between that coast and India. When Di Gama arrived at Mozambique in 1498, he found
there cities not inferior to those of Portugal. A narrative
of the voyage says of Melinda, one of these cities :
" The city was large, with handsome streets, and houses built of stone, several stories high, with terraces on the top."
In the ports of all these cities he found "many ships" quite
equal to his own; and the officers in charge of these ships used the mariner's compass, the astrolabe, and other nautical and astronomical instruments. Here, as everywhere else in that part of the Indian Seas, the Arabians were foremost in commercial enterprise.
That African civilization has disappeared; those cities
and kingdoms no longer exist. ' The superior military appliances of the Portuguese enabled them to occupy that region, and this Portuguese occupation has brought to the country nothing but debasement and ruin. In place of the flourishing communities and active commerce found there
in 1498, we have only barbarism and smii-barbarism, man
aged in a characteristic way by Portuguese brutality.



An old African Civilization. 335
NORTHERN AFRICA IN PRE-HISTORIC TIMES.
Enlightened states and cities existed in Northern Africa
long previous to the beginning of history. Many considerations make it evident that the origin of these civilized communities must be referred to a very remote period in
the past. A very ancient and influential civilization in
Northwestern Africa and Spain is plainly signified by the old myths and legends concerning Atlas and the Atlantides. It must have been established there in the first ages
of Cushite maritime enterprise on the Mediterranean, if not
earlier; and its beginnings must have been very ancient so ancient as to be mythical at the commencement of the
Tyrian period. Its chronological relation to the building of Gades and the rise of Carthaginian supremacy must have been nearly the same as that of the Old Monarchy of Egypt to the building of Alexandria and the Egypt of the Ptolemies.*
The city of Carthage, which, in the days of its highest power and prosperity, controlled most of Northern Africa and Spain, must have contained more than a million inhab
itants. It numbered over 700,000 when destroyed by the Romans. The malignant hate of these conquerors and de
stroyers, seeking to exterminate every vestige of Carthaginian power, civilization, and even history, destroyed all the books and manuscripts of the country, except an elaborate treatise of Mago on Agriculture and Botany,
* Sallust (Jugurtha, cap. 18), deriving his information from "Punic
sources," tells us that, according to the traditions of the African people, Hercules died in Spain, and that after his death his followers settled in
Northern Africa. Hercules, or more properly Melcarth, belongs to very ancient times.



336 Pre-Historic Nations.
which they translated into Latin and appropriated to themselves. So we are informed by Pliny.
Carthage was the latest development of the Cushite race in Northern Africa, but it was not the greatest. In earlier
times, that region, from Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean, had
been still more important, and evidently more populous. Previous to the beginning of Tyrian supremacy, Northern Africa and Spain were old in civilization. During the
Tyrian period, Northern Africa was full of cities and alive with the busy movements of commerce and agriculture. It continued to be one of the most attractive of civilized countries down to the time of the Mahometan invasion.
Tacitus, writing of Germany, its rude people, and ungenial
climote, exclaimed " Quis, Asia aut Africa aut Italia re
licta, Germaniam peteretT who would relinquish Asia, Africa, or Italy for Germany ! Roman ruins, now found in the interior, show us how attractive that African coun
try was to the Romans, even in its decline. The old cities and civilization of Northern Africa came
from the people known to us as Phoenicians, and some of their settlements in that region must have been much olK r
than the time when Martu, or Marathos, was the rulinL!; city. Those old myths, common to Romans, Greeks, and
Phoenicians, are destitute of significance if some of the Cushite communities in that country, and especially in Northwestern Africa, were not many ages older than those on the Black Sea.
The country is still covered with ruins, although every trace of some of the more ancient cities has undoubtedly
disappeared. An interesting account of some of these ruins can be found in the work of Mr. X. Davis on "The
Ruined Cities of Africa." His explorations, however, were

confined to the districts immediately connected with Carthage ; but he refers to other ruins not yet described nor
even visited. The old city of Moroco, or Maghrib, was a
ruin in the time of Leo Africanus. He speaks of it as " the
great and famous city of Maroco," describes it as " a huge
and mighty city," anciently remarkable for its magnificent
temples and schools of learning, and says " it had four-and
twenty gates, and a wall of great strength and thickness." Describing one of the great temples, he makes this state
ment : " Under the porch of this temple, in the olden time, it is said, there were nearly an hundred booksellers' shops, and as many on the other side ; but at the present time I think there is not one bookseller in the whole city, and scarcely a third part of the city is now inhabited." The Romans were succeeded in Africa by the Goths, who were followed by the Mahometan Arabs. The intolerant and fierce Mahometans waged war against the remaining influences of the Pho3nician civilization, and, to a large extent, drove the old inhabitants from the coast.
Leo Africanus tells us that " they burnt all the African
books, for they were of opinion that the Africans, so long as they had any knowledge of natural philosophy, or of any other good arts and sciences, would every day more and more contemn the law of Mahomet." But the old
culture was not all destroyed immediately ;
" the Moors" of Spain are famed for their learning and elegant culture ; and some of the African cities, under Mahometan sway,
were for a long time equally eminent. All this, however, disappeared finally, and down to our own time Northern
Africa was closed against Europe by the inappeasable hostility of Mahometan fanaticism.
P



338 Pre-Historic Nations.
THE BERBERS.
All that now remains of the old Phoenician communities
in Northern Africa is found in the people called Berbers,
who are spread throughout the inland portions of the country from Egypt to the Atlantic. The origin of the Ber
bers appears in what we know of their history, as well as
in their language, which belongs to the Ethiopic or Cushite
family, being genetically related to the ancient speech of Arabia, and to the modern dialects used in Abyssinia and Somaulia. Those who assume that the Phoenicians were never anything more than a few communities of manufac
turers and merchants, occupying a little district on tlueastern shore of the Mediterranean, are necessarily unable
to comprehend this fact, and they are no more able to explain the vast extent of the colonial and commercial sys
tem of that people. The assumption has no warrant. In ancient times that
system was supported by Arabia, and not im-rcly by the
little district known as Plm-nicia. The name and traditions of the country show us that the Cushite coloni/ors of Northern Africa, came from the Upper Nik' valley as well as from Phoenicia and the Arabian peninsula. It is
probable that the earliest civilized communities on the
Mediterranean, away from its eastern shores, w.-iv in North
ern Africa, and that these communities played a .great part
in human affairs, of which there is no record, although it is
dimly visible in the mythologies and cosmogonic legends
of the ancient world from Rome to India. Leo Africanus, in the first book of his work on Africa,
states that the people of North Africa, in his time, all us<--l one language, although divided into many tribes and fain

ilies. He says the Mahometan Arabs called their speech
" barbarous," and adds that, in his view, it was " the true
and natural speech of the Africans," although some would infer from its character that the Northern Africans or Ber
bers " came by lineal descent from the Sabeans, a people of Arabia Felix." The genetic relation of the Berber language to that of the Himyaric or Cushite Arabians seems to have been noticed distinctly by the Mahometan invad
ers, whose speech was the Arabic of theHedjaz. In Leo's time the Berber language was universal in Mo
roco, and in all the North African countries, excepting
that " over against Tunis and Tripoli" the Arabic of the
invading Mahometans was " spoken very corruptly." He says the Berbers called their language "Aquel Amarig, the noble tongue." In his opinion, the Berbers or Africans
anciently " had an alphabet peculiar to themselves," which had given place to the Arabic letters used by their in
vaders ; and they had histories, which were destroyed and forgotten. The Cushite origin of the Berbers is shown
in his account of their ancient religion. He says : " These
Africans had in times past magnificent and stately temples, dedicated to the sun and to fire;" and they wor
shipped the planets, offering prayers and sacrifices. Leo
had no clear comprehension of the origin of " these Africans," but his account of their language and religion shows
it very plainly. Neither ethnology nor linguistic science has yet given such attention to the Berbers as their historical importance
deserves, although we have a better knowledge of them than was possible when Leo wrote en Africa. They are found as far south as the southern border of the Sahara, and they seem to have been connected with some of the



340 Pre-Historio Nations.
important political movements of Central Africa, The
Berbers, it is said, established the old kingdom ofBornou, and also founded the city of Timbuctu. They undoubtedly controlled the kingdom ofBornou for a long time previous to the beginning of the twelfth century. But the land of the Berbers is Northern Africa, between Egypt
and the Atlantic, excepting the districts immediately on the coast-line. They have towns, cities, agricultural dis
tricts, political organization, and many of the arts of civilized life. They generally read and write, and have schools and books. Nearly all the tribes now use the Arabic alphabet ; but the Touaricks of the Sahara the
purest, proudest, most numerous, and most lordly family of the Berbers have an alphabet of their own, for which
they claim great antiquity, and they have also consider
able native literature. We have some account of the Berbers from travelers
who have partially explored Northern Africa; and since
the French took possession of Algeria, a lew scholarly French officers employed in that country, such as MM. Ilanoteau and Boissonnet, have given sonn- attention t t his remarkable people. In the Journal Asiatique for Max , 1847, M. Boissonnet gave an interesting account of the
Touarick or "Timing" alphabet, with an impression of the characters, showing it to be nearly identical with that used by the Phoenicians in later times. The characters
were printed in a comparative table, with the Hebrew let
ters and those of the Libyan inscriptions. Their identity with the Phoenician alphabet is too manifest to be questioned. That Journal called attention to their close n
?u'inl>lanee to the characters of certain ancient Libyan
inscriptions, particularly those of the bilingual stone of



Account of the TouaricJcs. 3ttl
Thugga. There is no room to doubt that this alphabet of the Touaricks is substantially the same that was used by the old Phoenician or Cushite communities throughout Northern Africa. Captain Hanoteau promised to furnish for publication a volume of selections from the Touarick
literature, with a French translation.
We have some accounts of the Touaricks, and of other Berber communities, in the volumes of modern travelers.
In the months between August, 1845, and April, 1846, Mr. James Richardson visited Ghadames, Ghat, Mpurzouk, Sockna, and Misratah. He met the Touaricka first at Ghadames, where a large company of them had arrived for
traffic. Writing in his journal while in that city, he said :
" This afternoon I had a visit from Touarick women, and was astonished to find some of them almost fair. It is evident that the men are dark simply from exposure to
the sun." An Arab merchant expressed to him the com
mon estimate of the Touaricks by saying, " The maharee
[desert camel] always assumes the mastery over the coast camel, just as the Touarick assumes to be lord over the Arab." In the Sahara, which is much less a desert than fancy has sometimes portrayed, the Touaricks have towns, cities, and an excellent condition of agriculture. They are very skillful in the cultivation of fruit. Their method of
political organization is democratic, somewhat after the fashion of the old Cushite municipalities. Mr. Richardson
says : " Ghat, like all the Touarick countries, is a republic ;
all the people govern." And, " The woman of the Touaricks is not the woman of the Moors and Mussulmans gen
erally. She has here great liberty, walks about unveiled, and takes an active part in the affairs and transactions of
life."



Prc-IIistoric Nations.
In a letter published in the Journal Asiatique for August, 1845, M. Boissonnet stated that a native traveler told him
that w the Touaricks are very white, go always clothed, and wear pantaloons like Europeans." This reminds us of the
description given in the 13th century by Ebn-ed-din El
Eghwaati, in his " Notes of a Journey :" " The Touaricks
are a very powerful people, of very white complexion ; they wear pantaloons like Christians."
Captain G.F.Lyon, whose volume was published in 1821, met a company of Touaricks at Mourzouk, and spoke of
them as follows : " They are the finest race of men I ever
saw; tall, straight, and handsome, with a certain air of in
dependence and pride that is very imposing. They arcgenerally white, that is to say, comparatively so, the dark brown of their complexion being occasioned only by the heat of the climate. Their arms and bodies, where con
stantly covered, are as white as those of many European-.'* He gives the following account of a community of white Berlin's in Fez/an: "The inhabitants of Zucla are nearly
all white, and they are particularly careful about intermar
riages with Arabs. They are certainly the most respect
able, hospitable, and quiet people in Fez/an; and their whole appearance (for they are handsome and very neatly
dressed) bespeaks something superior." Rev. II. B. Tristam, whose book, entitled "Wanderings South of the Atlas Mountains," appeared at London in 1860,
describes the Kabyles, the M'Zabs, the AVareglans, and the
inhabitants of the Wed R'hir chain of oases, who are all Berbers, and use Berber dialects. The H'Zabs have a re
public or confederacy consisting of seven cities and districts. Gharda'ia, the capital, has 13,000 inhabitants. This

are connected with it. Beni-Isguen, another of these cities,
has 10,000 inhabitants, and not far from it are the ruins of
its still more ancient predecessor. At Berryan these M'Zab
Berbers told Mr. Tristam that " their nation came hither from Moroco, to which place their ancestors immigrated from Egypt or South of Egypt ; but their imauns knew all their story, and it is written in their sacred books, which
are preserved in manuscripts at Gharda'ia." Being at Guerrara, another of these seven cities, Mr.
Tristam writes : " The Guerrarans really understand and
apply the arch, a proof certainly of more than modern Arab civilization. In many places the resemblance to Egyptian architecture is interesting, especially when combined with
the similarity in shape of their vessels, jars, and household utensils to those of ancient Egypt." Speaking of his de
parture from the city of Beni-Isguen, he says : " When we were about to depart, the djemmaa requested our names
and addresses, as they have a register containing all the events of the city, and a record of its visitors for nine hun
dred years. The book was produced." The M'Zabs are not the only Berbers who have books
and manuscripts. It is probable that all, or nearly all, the tribes have annals and other literary records like those pre
served at Ghardaia, for they all read and write. The Tou
aricks appear to be the most cultivated branch of the family ; their literature has attracted the attention of French
officers in Africa. When it can be explored carefully, im
portant historical records may be discovered, although it is nowise likely that much relating to their ancient history
has been preserved. The Berbers, their language, and their books ought to
be fully explored and studied. Archeology and linguistic

science have lavished enthusiastic and toilsome study on
subjects much less worthy of attention, for these Berbers present the remains of a great civilization much older than
Rome or Hellas, and of one of the most important peoples
of antiquity. Here are " ruins" more promising, and, in certain respects, more important than the buried rums of
Nineveh; but they have failed to get proper attention, partly because a false chronology has made it impossible to see their meaning and comprehend their importance. The Berbers represent ancient communities whose importance was beginning to decline before Rome appeared, and which were probably contemporary with ancient C'haMea
and the Old Monarchy of Egypt. Some of them, I repeat it, may have been established by the Arabian Cushites before Menes united Upper and Lower Egypt under one government. Additional suggestions relative to the earliest civilized communities in Northwestern Africa will become nece
in what I have to say of Western Europe in pre-historic times, for there seems to have been a period in the remote past when these regions were intimately connected. Meanwhile it must, I think, be admitted that the civilized communities, established so extensively in Africa by the Ara
bian Cushites in the pre-historic ages, occupied, controlled. or influenced to a large extent nearly the whole continent. The Cushite origin of these communities would be con
clusively manifest in the dialects' they left in Africa, if there
were nothing else to show it ; and their influence explains what we see in the present condition of the African people, which is so unlike that of normal barbarism, and in which
there are so many traces of former acquaintance with civ
ilization.



The old Cushite Settlements. 345
NAVIGATION AROUND AFEICA.
We have good reasons for believing not only that the Arabian Cushites in the early times, but also the Phoeni
cians during the Tyrian period, were familiar with every part of the coast of Africa. The old Cushite settlements were extended far down the eastern coast, nearly to the
Cape of Good Hope; and, so late as 1498 A.D., when jthe Portuguese first sailed to India, there were important cities as low down as the Mozambique Channel, in the latitude
of Madagascar. We have the testimony of antiquity that the Tyrians had "ancient settlements" on the Atlantic
coast of Africa, " which consisted of not less than three
hundred cities." It is added that they " were destroyed by the Pharusii and the Nigrita?." Strabo doubted be
cause he could not appreciate either the greatness or the
antiquity of the people called Phoenicians. He frequently doubted incontestable facts because his limited view of the world did not enable him to understand them, as in the
case of Pytheas and his voyage to the arctic regions. In
the present case, his hesitating doubt itself confirms the
testimony which he was not quite able to reject.
The Cushites, or Phoenicians, so placed on the Eastern and Western Coasts, could not have failed to sail around Africa, and become familiar with the coast of Guinea, in
the days of their greatest enterprise. The contrary supposition is every way improbable. Could we have a complete history of the Phoenicians and Southern Arabians from the twentieth to the middle of the ninth century be
fore the Christian Era, it would probably appear that their navigation was more extensive than any of the moderns
have supposed. The knowledge that Africa could be cir

cumnavigated, so prevalent in countries connected with the Eastern Mediterranean at the beginning of the sixth century before the Christian Era, must have come from recollections and traditions of the navigation of the Phoenicians and Southern Arabians in the earlier ages.
About the year 600 B.C., Necho IT., an enterprising king of Egypt, fitted out an expedition, which he ordered to sail down the Red Sea, go around Africa, and return to Egypt
through the Straits of Gibraltar. He knew very well that
such a voyage was possible. The same knowledge existed among the Persians, when Sataspes, one of the Achaemeni
da?, guilty of a great crime, was offered escape from capital punishment if he would sail around Africa in the opposite
direction, but lacked resolution to complete the voy;i'_r .
Herodotus, who gives a particular account of the successful expedition sent out by Necho, adds that the Carthaginians knew that Africa was surrounded by the ocean, and
could therefore be circumnavigated. The Carthaginians sent forth several expeditions, to renew, along the African coast, the old navigation and commerce of the Phoenicians ; and there seem to have been several Hannos by win mi such expeditions were commanded. AVe have the "Periplus" of one, who made an extensive voyage along the coast, sailing from the west. Pliny mentions another Hanno, who sailed from the Straits of Gibraltar to Arabia, and
wrote an account of his voyage in a " Commentary." Posidonius and others give accounts of the voyages of Eu
doxus of Cyzicus, "a learned man, much interested in the
peculiarities of different countries." It is stated that hehad great enthusiasm for exploring the coast of Africa on the exterior ocean, and that he found on the Eastern C the Cape of Good Hope and Arabia, remains of

the wreck of a ship from Gades. Strabo doubts what is
said of Eudoxus, but it is not, for this reason, to be dis
credited. Phoenician commerce at the East was interrupted, and the independence of the great Phoenician cities on the Eastern Mediterranean was destroyed, in the ninth century before Christ, by those Assyrian invasions that reduced to subjection all the countries in that region. In the latter
part of that century there was a great migration of Phoenicians from the Eastern Mediterranean, and especially from
Tyre, to Carthage. Phoenician navigation around Africa was discontinued. The Carthaginian efforts to renew it were made three or four centuries later. It had been discontinued more than two centuries when the voyage or
dered by Necho was undertaken; but it was remembered, as we can see in the general knowledge that such navigation was possible ; and the wreck of a ship from Gades on the eastern coast of Africa shows that voyages around Airica had formerly been made from the west as well as from
the east.
It is known that the Arabians had an accurate knowledge of the configuration of the southern and southwest
ern part of the African continent, and that, through knowledge derived from them, this portion of the coast of Africa was accurately drawn on maps before the time of Bartholomew Diaz and Yasquez di Gama, and then what we
call the Cape of Good Hope was described as " Cape Diab" [or Dsiab in Arabic].* It seems also to have been

called " Cape Agisymba," if we may believe Ferdinand Co
lumbus, who said the name Cape of Good Hope " was sub. stituted for the older name Cape Ageringua" which is a corruption of the word Agisymba, as Humboldt shows.
Ten years previous to the voyage of Vasquez di Gama, Pedreio de Covilhan, who had visited Calicut, Goa, and Sofala, in Southeastern Africa, wrote from Sofala to John L, king of Portugal, that he had learned from the Arabians that Africa could be circumnavigated; and he described
the course by which Portuguese ships could sail round Africa to Sofala and Madagascar. Rev. Dr. Krapf, and one or two German scholars of
reputation, have supposed that the " Ophir" of the Hebrew Scriptures may have been on the eastern coast; but this
does not seem probable. Max Mtiller is sure that it must have been somewhere in India, because he thinks the
names of gold, ivory, and the other articles brought from Ophir by the ships of Hiram and Solomon were Sanskrit ;
but his attempt to show this is not satisfactory. More
over, if we are to seek Ophir in India, it will be much more natural and reasonable to suppose the names of t ho articles of commerce mentioned came from the old lan
gcnois, que le Comte Baldelli a fait connaitre ; dans le Planisferio de la
Palatina, de Florence, de 1417, discute par le Cardinal Zurla; et surtout dans le fameuse mappemonde de Fra Mauro, trare'e chins les anne'es 1 I .".7 t-t 1 i:>9. C'est cette derniere carte surtout, anterieure de quarante ans

[Ilumboldt's Examcn Critique de 1'IIistoire de la Geographic di< JY Continent, etc., vol. i.] Near the close of the same volume he pointed
out that the later opinions of antiquity relative to the circumnavigation of Africa were much more incorrect than those of preceding ages :

guage of the country, and not from the Sanskrit. Could it really be shown beyond question that these words are actually found in the Sanskrit language, it would be necessary to show, also, that their relation to it is not like that
of the word " camel" to English, and " camelus" to Latin words which, as we know, came into Latin and English from the old Arabian name of the animal they are used to
designate. Mr. Miiller says, very justly, that the names of the articles brought from Ophir are as foreign to Hebrew as guttdrpercha and tobacco are to English ; but this does
not make them Sanskrit. It is more reasonable to assume that they came either from some native dialect of the
country where they were found, or from the language of the navigators and traders who made them articles of commerce. The word " Ophir," as used in the Hebrew Scriptures,
means " the West," and is the same as the words Aphar,
Apar, and Aupir. Wilford says very justly, in the 8th
volume of the " Asiatic Researches :" " In Scripture, Parvaim and Ophir mean countries at the east and at the west ; but these terms are not deducible from the Hebrew. Apar and Aparica are the same as Ophir, Aphar, and Africa."
Bishop Lowth pointed out that Ophir, Aupir, and Auphir were all different forms of the same word, from which he derived the name Africa. It is the same word that was
used, in ancient times, to describe 'Mauritania, Spain, and
other countries on the Western Mediterranean, as " the West." Therefore, when it is said that the ships of Hiram and Solomon went to Ophir, the meaning is that they went
to the countries of " the West ;" and, probably, all the countries beyond the Cape of Good Hope were so described. The Ophir visited may have been the region on the coast of Guinea, where r;ol<l and ivory were .-.b indant ;



350 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
and in making these voyages, the ships went not only down the Red Sea, but also through the Straits of Gibraltar, and down the Western Coast. This appears to be the
meaning of the following statement :
" The king's [Solomon's] ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Hurani :
every three years once came the ships of Tarshish, bring
ing gold and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks," or perhaps
" Guinea fowl" [2 Chron. ix., 21]. That is to say, the ships went to Tarshish or Tartessus, on the coast of Spain, and sailed for Ophir from that place, as well as from Ezion
geber, on the Red Sea. This location of Ophir seems to me more probable than
any other that has been suggested. To seek it in India,
or anywhere else at the East, when its name tells us that it was connected with "the West," is not the most rcasona^ ble method of inquiry, and does not take proper account
of the fact that, according to the Hebrew Script in
could be reached from Tartessus, in Spain, quite as easily as from Ezion-geber on the Red Sea. If the great extent
of Phoenician navigation had always been recognised, there would have been less doubt, and that part of the African
coast, near Liberia, to which gold and ivory have given their names, must have been accepted as the Ophir of Solomon and the Tyrians. At any rate, the old Arabian race, that occupied the central countries of Africa so extensively, and established settlements so far down both the Eastern and the Western Coast, must have been familiar with
every coast district of the country that produced anything to attract commerce, and must have been accustomed, in the great ages of their power, to make voyages to the Gold Coast from ports at the West, both on the Atlantic and within the Straits of Gibraltar, as well as from the Red Sea and Southern Arabia.



IX.
WESTERN EUROPE IN PRE-HISTORIC TIMES.
OUR histories of Western Europe begin with what the Romans tell us of the occupation of Spain Iby the Carthaginians, and of their own occupation of the Keltic coun
tries. The historians generally can see nothing beyond this. What the Romans have not described or reported is not deemed worthy of serious attention, and minds con
trolled by Roman and Greek authority have found it easy to slide into a belief that the people of Western Europe
generally were never, at any time, much above the condition of barbarians before they were brought under the in
fluence of Roman civilization.
It is a pleasant thing, no doubt, to have reputation for critical discrimination, but it is well to take some account of the fact that ambition to establish such a reputation
sometimes paralyzes the faculty of perception. It is more honorable to see wisely what is presented for observation, than to believe there can be anything worthy to be called
sound judgment in refusing to see it. Even in the Roman accounts of the Keltic countries of Western Europe, it is manifest that they had an old civilization when the Romans went there. Julius Csesar tells us that they had
the art of writing, and that they used what he called " the
Greek letters." Their cities, their arts and manufactures,
their knowledge of metallurgy, and their habits of life, indicate their condition. It is to be regretted that the Ro

mans did not describe them more carefully, study their literature, and tell us all that could then have been learned
concerning their history. But they were, not accustomed
to deal justly, in this respect, by the peoples they conquer
ed. Major Wilford, expressing in the " Asiatic Researches" his opinion that the historical records of India had been
destroyed by the Brahmans, added :
" In this manner the
Romans destroyed the books of Numa, consigned to de
struction the historical books of the Etruscans, and, I sus
pect, those also of the Turdetani in Spain." He might have added a reference to their treatment of the Cartha
ginian books.

It may well be doubted whether the Kelts were much
inferior to the Romans in anything save unity and milita

possessed great wealth, "used silver goblets and c, were "polished and urbane- in their manners," and showed remarkable elegance and refinement in their manner of life. Polybius states that in the time of the second Punic AVar the Romans discarded the swords they had been a
tomed to use for such as were in use among the Iberians,
which were superior to the Roman weapon. Ireland, then and afterwards, was held in great repute for its culture
and its schools of learning. Mosheim states that in Oie
ninth century its culture was nneqiialed by any other in
Europe. Tacitus tells us that in his time it was widely
known through its commerce, which attracted the merchants of other count i



Cushite Antiquity at the West. 353
An important and very ancient civilization in Western
Europe is brought to light by the revelations of geology,
in what they show us of the " Ages of Bronze and of Pol
ished Stone," whose unquestionable testimony supports that of the old myths and traditions of the Greeks.
In the historical and mythical literature of Greece there
is mention of two distinct and widely separated periods of civilization in Spain and Northwestern Africa, or in the regions near the Pillars of Hercules.
1. The oldest of these periods was entirely mythical. It is indicated by the myths concerning Hercules and the
Cronidre, by the representations that Hyperion, Atlas, Sat
urn, and other great personages of mythology were kings who reigned over countries on the western shores of the Mediterranean, and by the accounts given of the island of Atlantis. The legends that connect Hercules with North
western Africa, Spain, and other regions at the West, evidently refer to the most ancient times. They may represent the first occupation of those countries by the Arabian
Cushites, in ages older than Egypt, when the first great cities of that race appeared on the Mediterranean. The story of the Atlantic Island which came from Egypt was believed by Solon and Plato. Solon, it is said, knowing
that the Egyptians had records of very ancient times, sought to get an account of them from the priests at Sais. They assured him that the Greeks had no knowledge of
antiquity, and knew nothing of what had happened an
ciently in their own country; and then they gave him a
history of the ancient times from their own annals. He
brought this history to Greece in manuscript notes, intending to make some important use of it, which circumstances, however, prevented. Plato produced some particulars of



354 Pre-Historic Nations.
it in his " Timacus" and " Critias" by giving the story of the "Atlantic Island." In the remotest age mentioned in the Egyptian annaJs, there was, in the Atlantic Sea, over
against the Pillars of Hercules, " an island larger than
Libya and Asia put together." The people of this island, who had great wealth and an admirable condition of civil
ized life,
" extended their empire to all the country as for
as Egypt and Tyrrhenia;" and once "a mighty, warlike power, rushing from the Atlantic Sea, spread itself with hostile fury over Europe and Asia." It is added that the Atlantic Island afterwards sunk in the sea, which, in con
sequence, was no longer navigable. Other legends tell us of kings who reigned in Spain and Northern Africa. There is but one reasonable explanation. These legends
preserve the recollection of a great and enterprising people who in very remote times occupied those Western countries, and had communication with America. The At
lantic Island must mean America, and its disappearance in the ocean must mean the discontinuance of communication with it. 2. The second period presented in the Greek records is
more historical. It is the period when, after Tyre ro
supremacy, the Phoenicians reoccupied Spain and Northwestern Africa, and established an extensive commerce with Western Europe, going to Britain for tin, and to the
Northwestern countries for amber. To this period belongs the building of Gades ; and it has been usual to assume that it shows us the first appearance of the Phoenician race
in those regions, although this assumption is contrary to both fact and tradition. Strabo seems to have entertained
it, for he says in his third book : " I repeat that the Phoenicians were the discoverers [of Mauretania, the Fortunate



Ireland colonized from Africa. 355
Islands, and Spain], for they possessed the better part of Iberia and Libya before the time of Homer." This de
scribes the second period of which I am speaking ; but it does not say that civilization in those countries was not older than the tune of the Tyrians. In fact, Strabo himself shows that it was older, in what he says of Tartessus in
connection with Geryon and Hercules, and in his representation that the Tyrians went forth to find and reoccupy the most western countries reached by Hercules. Nothing
tells us how early the Tyrians began to assume possession of Spain ; but they were probably established there, and in
Mauretania, before the city of Gades was built. The first settlements of the Arabian Cushites in Spain and Northern Africa cannot have been later than 5000 years before the Christian Era. The Egyptian date connected with the story of the Atlantic Island makes the time much earlier. Menes was about 4000 years older than tjie birth of Christ, and his time cannot be as old as that
indicated by the myths concerning the- expedition of Hercules in the West. Spain and Northwestern Africa must have been independent countries before his time, if the
myths have any significance whatever. According to the Irish records, the oldest people mentioned in Ireland, the Formorians, came from Africa ; and it is said that they had
powerful fleets, and were distinguished for maritime enterprise. Probably the Cushite race, religion, and civilization first went to the ancient Finnic people of Britain, Gaul, and the Scandinavian countries from Spain and Africa. The beginning of the Bronze Age in these countries was much older than the period of Tyre. The Tyrian establishments in those Western countries seem to have been later than the Aryan immigration that created the Keltic

peoples and languages; and it may be that the Tyrians in trocluced the "Age of Iron" not long after their arrival, for it was evidently much older than the time of the Romans. I have alluded to the ancient myths and mythological legends which indicate the existence of civilized and im
portant countries at the West, near the Pillars of IlercuK-,
in the deepest antiquity. They certainly mean this if they
mean any thing ; and nothing seems to me more preposterous than to assume that they are entirely destitute of
significance. The rationalism of Euhemerus could not be popular in a community where Socrates was put to death on suspicion that he cherished scientific tendencies hostile to the blind
assumptions of the prevalent religion; nevertheless, that rationalism proceeded from truth and reason. The wi>cst persons among the ancients understood that most of the
gods in their mythology were deified men. Diodorus Siculus and others point out that the ancients held two opin
ions concerning the gods; some saying they were always heavenly and incorruptible, and others that they were originally <>f earthly origin, being deified men who were wor
shipped as forms or representations of the Supreme Being. It is easy to imagine the mental characteristics of the dis
putants on each side of this question. A clear intellect, where reason was not overborne by the feeling of wonder
or the tendency to illusion, could not very easily see an original, self-existent divinity in a deified hero or Men like Euhemerus could understand why great kings,
heroes, and sages had been deified and worshipped after
death ; but no pious worship of the gods of Olympus, nor any classical consecration of this worship, could hide from
them the fact that Saturn and Jupiter were originally kings



Mythical History of the West. 357
who reigned over countries on the Western Mediterranean
in the oldest times known to tradition. Even the classical
dictionaries tell us that " Saturn was a mythical king of
Italy." One account of these personages runs as follows : Hy
perion, Atlas, and Saturn or Cronos, were sons of Uranos, who reigned over a great kingdom composed of countries around the western part of the Mediterranean, with certain islands in the Atlantic. Hyperion succeeded his father,
but was killed by the Titans. The kingdom was then divided between Atlas and Saturn, Atlas taking Northern Africa, with the Atlantic Islands, and Saturn the countries on the opposite shore to Italy and Sicily. Plato's account
of the legend says: The Atlantes (successors of Atlas)
reigned over the island of Atlantis, and also, on one side, over all the countries of Northern Africa to Egypt ; and, on the other, all the way from the Atlantic to the limits of
Tyrrhenia. This version of the story, which came from Egypt, makes Saturn a successor of Atlas. According to some accounts, Saturn was dethroned. ThymaBtes said he was dethroned by Dionysos. The common statement is
that Jupiter, his successor, became one of the greatest of monarchs. Another version makes Atlas the son of lape
tus, and the nephew of Saturn and Hyperion. It must be that these ancient myths, however arrayed
by fancy, or varied by local prejudice or tradition, rest on a basis of fact. They cannot be pure inventions ; this is
impossible ; there is history in them ; and I should feel that I was rejecting light and trifling with reason if I could refuse to see that they preserve recollections of the lost
history of very ancient countries in those regions of Africa
and Europe to which they refer. The traditions declare



358 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
explicitly that such countries existed there. There is nothing whatever to make this improbable ; and when we con
sider the great antiquity and enterprise of the Cushite civ
ilization that created Egypt, we feel that the general tes
timony of these traditions must be true. But, to see it clearly, we must dismiss all narrow views of the past.
THE AGE OF BROXZE IX WESTERN EUROPE.
Let us now turn to a consideration of some of the facts
brought to light within a few years by the investigations of geologists. These facts show that the antiquity of the human race in that part of the globe is much greater than even the boldest geologist had allowed himself to suppo-i-. Human remains have been discovered in the geological formation known as "the drift," and in other subsequent formations down to the present time. In the older format ions
these remains consist chiefly of articles of human manufacture, such as arms and utensils of various kinds. They arc
all made of stone ; at first, and for a long time, of Hint, but
finally, when greater skill had been developed, various kinds of stone were used, and a higher style of workman
ship was displayed. At length there is a sudden transition from arms and implements made of stone to those made of bronze. The
arms, cutting instruments, and other bronze articles, wero beautifully manufactured. In form and ornamentation they arc very similar all over Western Europe. In his work on
the subject, entitled " Pre-Historic Times," Sir J. Lubbock says: "The similarity to each other of the bronze weapons
found in very distant parts of Europe implies a rnon tended intercourse between the different countries than
existed in post-Roman times," or in the centuries inuncdi

ately after the Roman occupation of Gaul. This Bronze Age seems to have been of very long duration. Bronze,
however, was superseded by*iron long before the Christian Era, for iron was in use in all those countries before the
Romans went there. A very long time must have intervened between the beginning of the age of iron and the first invasion of the Romans. But I do not propose to undertake an elaborate discus
sion of these discoveries, which have been very carefully described and discussed in many volumes already publish
ed in English, French, Danish, and German. They have been made in nearly all the Western countries of Europe,
and particularly in France, Switzerland, England, Ireland, Germany, and Denmark. My purpose is to draw attention chiefly to what is described as the Age of Bronze. The
preceding age of Stone, according to competent geologists, must have endured for a great length of time ; but it was, in part, an age of civilization. Professor Worsaae divides
this age into .three periods : First, the period of the stone
implements found in the drift and in caves, with remains of the mammoth and other extinct animals ; second, the period of the stone implements found in the Danish Kjoken
moddings [or shell heaps] and coast-finds ; third, the later Stone Age, or the period characterized by arms and im
plements of stone beautifully worked, and by large tumuli or buried tombs. Sir John Lubbock divides the Stone Age into two periods : that in which the stone implements were rudely manufactured of flint, and that in which they were made with much skill ; the former he calls the Paleolithic
period, and the latter the Neolithic period. The Age of Polished Stone manufactures evidently had
a considerable degree of civilization. The beautifully



360 Pre-Historic Nations.
worked stone arms and implements, the gold and amber ornaments, and the large tumuli or buried tombs, with massive stone walls carefully constructed, show that age to have been very different from an age of barbarism. The people who manufactured these artistic stone implements, who constructed such sepulchral tumuli as that at West Kennett, England, and those on the Danish island of Moen, and who cultivated wheat, barley, and flax, and wove tissues of linen, were not barbarians. They may have been much farther removed from barbarism than some peoples of our time, who, without merit or effort of their own, have
received from civilization all the metals, with many of its useful arts. It appears that they had domestic animals
and agriculture; and among the remains of their age, implements have been discovered which are supposed to be
stone ploughs. [See "Hora3 Feralcs," p. 43.] The Age of Bronze, by which the Age of Polished Stone
implements was immediately succeeded, has left a great variety of interesting monuments. It lias been studied
with special interest in the Danish peat-bogs and in the
ruins of lake dwellings in Western Switzerland; but a careful examination of the many tumuli connected with Stonehenge and with the ancient ruins at Abury, in : land, shows clearly that these structures belong to the
of Bronze Abury to its earliest period, and Stonehenge to a period much later. Abury was the most extensive and
imposing of these pre-historic temples. Mr. Lubbock re
marks that, according to Aubrey, Abury " did as much exceed Stonehenge as a cathedral does a parish church."'
When in perfect condition, the temple at Abury contained an area of 28 acres. If originally used as a temple, as i<
commonly supposed, it may also have been used for great assemblies of the people for other grave purposes.



The Danish Peat-beds explored. 361
The remarkable peat-beds of Denmark have been formed,
during a long series of years, in hollows or depressions in
the " drift," varying in depth from ten to thirty feet. During the ages that have elapsed since these peat formations began, the trees of many successive forests have fallen into
the growing deposits of peat, and been buried out of sight vas the accumulations increased. In the lowest strata the buried trees are of the species known as Scotch fir (Pinus
sylvestris). This tree is now unknown in Denmark, and will not thrive there. In the peat formations next above
the Scotch firs the buried trees are oak, described as " the
sessile variety ;" and these, in turn, are succeeded by oaks
of the " pedunculated variety." In the upper strata beechtrees are found. The beech is now the common forest tree of Denmark, and it was so in the time of the Romans.
It will be seen that a very long period of time was re
quired for the growth, decay, and final disappearance, first, of the successive forests of firs, and next of the successive forests of oaks ; and yet no record or memory in Denmark knows anything of the time when the Danish forests were not beech. In the lower part of the peat-beds, with the firs and the first layers of oak, human remains are found be
longing to the later periods of the Age of Stone. In the
strata with the oaks are found swords, shields, and other articles, made of bronze, with the bones of men and domestic animals. The beginning of the Age of Iron coincides
very nearly with the first appearance of fallen beech-trees. Remains of the Bronze Age are abundant in the ruins of the pile-works or lake dwellings of Western and Central
Switzerland, where there have been some attempts to estimate the antiquity of these memorials of the distant past,
and large collections of bronze articles have been mad*

from mortuary tumnli. It is manifest in these antiquities that the Age of Bronze was an age of civilization. The bronze itself implies this, not to speak of the beautiful form
and workmanship of many of the articles. Bronze is a
manufactured product, consisting of copper and tin, and implies skill in metallurgy ; it must have been introduced
into Western Europe by a foreign people. There have been tentative efforts to estimate the antiq
uity of some remains of the Age of Bronze, especially of certain pile-works in Switzerland ; but these calculations
are necessarily imperfect, and cannot produce satisfactory results. One Swiss geologist estimates that certain structures of the Bronze Age in Switzerland are "from 3000 to
4000 years old." They are doubtless much older, and the
beginning of the Bronze Age in that country may have been more than 1000 years older than the particular struc
tures used in making this estimate. It is not extravagant
to suppose the Age of Bronze began in Britain, Gaul, and perhaps Denmark, where it was older than in Switzerland, more than 3000 years before the Christian Era ; nor is it
worth while to quarrel with any archaeologist who may be
inclined to add considerably to these figures, for on this
point nothing can be said or assumed with certainty. We are sure only that the beginning of the Age of Bronze
must be sought far back in the past. Nevertheless, there are certain facts relating to this age that furnish something
like historical intimations.
In the first place, during that age, or a large part of it, the countries of Western Europe, where its remains are found, must have been subject to the influence of a single
government or ruling people. Everything indicates remarkable similarity of customs, ideas, and methods of life ,



The Bronze Age in Switzerland. 363
there was a striking uniformity of civilization ; the swords,
cutting instruments, tools, utensils, and other bronze articles, all seem to have been made after the same patterns, as if these bronze manufactures came originally from the same source ; and there was evidently a more intimate and constant communication between these countries than existed when they were first visited by the Romans. In the second place, it is seen that the use of bronze arms and implements must have begun on thefslands and the coast, and been extended to the interior from the West. It seems evident that the Age of Bronze was older in Ireland, Britain, and the islands of Denmark than in Germany and Switzerland. That the use of bronze was spread into the
interior from the West is shown very clearly by the dis
coveries in Switzerland. Remains of the Bronze Age have not been found in the eastern part of that country. It is only in Western and Central Switzerland that these bronze
antiquities are discovered. Sir J. Lubbock, stating the re
sult of investigation in that country, says : " Lake habitations of the Bronze Age have as yet been found only on
the lakes of Geneva, Luissel, Neufchatel, Morat, Bienne, and Sempach ; none in Eastern Switzerland. It has been
supposed from this that the Age of Stone lasted longer in the East than in the West, and that flint and serpentine were in use on Lake Constance long after bronze had replaced them on the Western lakes." These facts make it necessary to believe that bronze came to Switzerland from the West, and was introduced into those districts only which became intimately connected with the other countries where the remains of bronze manufactures are found. It may be added here that no remains of the earliest period of the Stone Age are found in the Scandinavian

countries, which leads some geological archaeologists to believe that these countries were not inhabited until after
the beginning of the Age of Polished Stone. Also, it does not appear that either the Age of Stone or the Age of Bronze can be studied in Spam or Italy, or in any part of
the territory occupied by the old Iberians, where, as I suppose, the Cushite civilization was established much earlier
than the beginning of the Age of Bronze farther north. I will not undeftake to say what discoveries geological
archaeology can make in these regions, but the distinction between them and the northern countries is manifest, and
it must be due to a much earlier civilization in Italy and
throughout the Iberian territory. In the third place, the sudden transition from stone to
bronze indicates that the change wasproduced by the in
fluence of a foreign people, to whom bronze, and the art of
manufacturing bronze arms and implements, were already
known. A knowledge of copper and tin, and the art !'
working these metals, must have preceded the appearance of bronze, an article produced by combining them in certain proportions. There must have been necessarily a con
siderable period of time between the first discovery of both copper and tin, and the development of that knowledge of the peculiarities and uses of these metals which
suggested the possibility of producing a more useful matevial by combining them, and led to the skillful and artistic manufacture of bronze articles, such as now represent the Age of Bronze. If bronze had been an original production of Western Europe, it must have been preceded by an age
of copper and tin. Therefore it is necessary to believe,
with the most competent archaeologists, that bronze is one of those great discoveries which Western Europe owes t<

the East. Professor Nilsson states that the oldest bronze
articles show the most perfect workmanship, seeming to have come from abroad; while inferior workmanship ap
pears in those of later date, indicating that they were manufactured in the countries where they are found. It is
certain that bronze had been carried everywhere throughout the East long before the beginning of the historical period by the commercial enterprise of those marvelous manufacturers and traders, the Arabian Cushites, and also
by their representatives, the Phoenicians. What we call
brass, an article made of copper and zinc, was unknown to the ancients ; but they had bronze, which must have been introduced by the Arabian Cushites, who may have discovered and worked the tin mines of Banca at an early
period in their history, before they had sailed to the Cas
siterides.
In the fourth place, there is much in these antiquities which appears to show in a very conclusive manner that the Bronze Age in Western Europe was introduced by a for
eign people of the Cushite race, culture, and religion, and that for a very long period it was controlled and directed
by their influence. Professor Nilsson, whose learning, ex
cellent judgment, and thorough study of the subject have made him the highest authority on most questions relating to it, is sure that bronze was brought to that region by
the Phoenicians, meaning the race they represent. The Arabian Cushites, or the communities they established in
Spain and Africa, are the only people of antiquity who can be supposed to have done this ; but he sees their presence and influence throughout the Bronze Age in the peculiar character of the manufactured articles, in the ornaments
on the bronze implements, in the engravings found in tu

muli of the Bronze Age, in the indications of peculiar methods of reaping and fishing, in the general use of warchariots, and in the many clear traces of the worship of
Baal. He calls attention to two stones from a tumulus
near Kivik, on which are representations of human figures
that even Sir J. Lubbock admits " may fairly be said to
have a Phcenician or Egyptian appearance." An obelisk symbolizing Baal is represented on another of the stones. The festival of Baal, or Balder, celebrated on midsummer
night in the upper part of Norway, reveals the Cushite
race, for the midnight fire in presence of the midnight sun did not originate in that latitude. This festival of Baal
was celebrated in the British Islands until recent times.
Baal has given such names as Baltic, Great a*nd Little Belt,
Belteburga, Baleshaugen, and the like. Professor Nilsson calls particular attention to two vase carnages, one found
in Sweden and the other in Mecklenburg, which arc strik
ingly like the " vases" made for Solomon's Temple, and de
scribed in the first book of Kings. But, to appreciate the whole force of his statement of the case, one must read it
carefully, without abridgment.
Sir J. Lubbock urges " two strong objections" to t views of Professor Nilsson, which in reality an- very weak.
He states them as follows : " The first is the character of the ornamentation on the bronze weapons and implements.
This almost always consists of geometrical figures, and we
rarely, if ever, find upon them representations of animals or plants ; while on the ornamented shields, etc., described by Homer, as well as in the decorations of Solomon's Tem
ple, animals and plants were abundantly represented. Secondly, the Phoenicians, so far as we know them, were well acquainted with the use of iron ; in Homer we find the



Lubbock's Objections criticised. ;>(*> 7
warriors already armed with iron weapons, and the tools used in preparing the materials for Solomon's Temple were
of this material." These objections assume too much. It does not accord
with either reason or probability to suppose the materials, methods of manufacture, or styles of ornamentation peculiar to the Phoenicians in the time of Homer and Solomon
were in all respects precisely the same as those used by another people of the same race more than two thousand years earlier.* The Phoenicians may have had iron in the time of Homer, and they may have introduced the Iron Age of Western Europe, but the older Cushite peoples
had bronze long previous to that date. Moreover, these objections do not undertake to deny that people of the Cushite race are directly connected with the Age of Bronze
by the religious significance of its remains. What other people could have brought the worship of Baal to West
ern Europe in pre-historic times? We see them in the
stone circles, in the ruins at Abury and Stonehenge, in the festival of Baal that lingered until our own times ; and there is something for consideration in the fact that Ara
bia has still the ruins of ancient structures precisely like
Stonehenge. It is probable that the Arabians, or their
representatives in Spain and North Africa, went northwrard and began the Age of Bronze more than 2000 years before Gades was built.
* In his Introduction to Professor Nilsson's "Primitive Inhabitants of Scandinavia," Sir John Lubbock adds this suggestion: " If Professor Nilsson be correct, the bronze weapons must belong to an earlier period in Phoenician history than that with which we are partially familiar." The
suggestion is important. He is not likely to deny that the beginning cf the Age of Bronze is much older than Gades.



368 Pre-Historic Nations.
THE ANCIENT KACE OF WESTERN EUEOPE.
What race of the human family was found in Western Europe by the people who introduced the Age of Bronze?
This question has engaged much attention. The inhabitants of those countries had created the Age of Polished Stone, therefore they had risen from barbarism to a con
siderable degree of civilization. It is generally agreed among those who have inquired most carefully that the race now represented in Europe by the Finns and the
Hungarians was anciently spread throughout nearly all the European countries. It is seen that the Finns ha\v re
tired or been driven towards the north since the opening
of the historical period; and it seems probable that the branch of this race now represented by the Finns and the Esthonians occupied all the countries of Western Europe before the Arabian Cushites went there, and all the countries so far south as to include nearly the whole of France, at the beginning of the Age of Bronze. Doubtless the old Iberians and Ligurians, with the Siculi and Sicani of Italy,
belonged originally to this race, but they were formed l>y the Cushite civilization at a much earlier period. This Finnish race is the oldest in Europe of which we have any

bly before the time of the Bronze Age, Spain, with a narrow district of Southern France extending to Northern Italy, was separate and distinct from the countries farther
north, not because it was inhabited by a different race, but
evidently because, in the earliest times, some great influence from abroad had modified the character and condi
tion, and perhaps the speech of the people. It appears tt> show the first occupation of Southwestern Europe by the Cushite Arabians in ages quite as old as Egypt, as signified by the myths relating to Hercules. Before the Finnic
race, farther north, had passed from the Age of Stone to
the Age of Bronze, Spain and Italy, as well as Northern
Africa, came under control of the most enlightened people of what, at that time, was known as the civilized world.
The original inhabitants of Spain (meaning by original
the oldest of whom we have any trace) were the Iberians,
represented in our time by the Basques who occupy the
western slopes and valleys of the Pyrenees in Spain and France. They are the most remarkable, and, in some re
spects, the most mysterious communities in Europe, for
they represent a people who have disappeared, and of
whom no other fragmentary group remains on the face of the earth. This people may be, like the Dravidians of
India, the only remaining representatives of a very ancient mixture of the Arabian Cushites with the aborigines of the
country where they are found. Their language, like that
of the Dravidians, seems to have no genetic relationship
to any other known language, so far as comparative philology has been able to ascertain. In its structure it has more in common with certain American languages than any others. Some resemblances to languages of the Finnish family have been traced, but nothing that makes it Q2



370 Pre-Historic Nation*.
possible to class the Basque tongue with languages of that
family. It appears to represent a very ancient group or family of languages, of composite origin probably, that had passed away before the beginning of the historical period, leaving only this fragment of the group in a narrow district on the Bay of Biscay, where it has maintained its existence with wonderful tenacity.
It has been shown, by a careful collection and analysis
of local names, that the Basques or Iberians anciently occupied the whole of Spain, and also the southern part of
France, where the Acquitani belonged to this race; and they arc traced to Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia, where the
aboriginal population, or the people found there in the most ancient times, seem to have belonged to the same
family, for there are many old names of rivers, places, and tribes that evidently came from the Iberian language.
This philological testimony is not without historical support. Thucydides and several other Greek writers who had carefully explored the old records and traditions of their time tell us that the most ancient inhabitants of
Italy and Sicily were the Sicani, and that the Sicani were
Iberians. Nevertheless, we cannot suppose Thucydides was able to give an authentic account of the oldest times.
The people found in this part of Europe by the ancient
civilizers must have been greatly changed by the mixture of races and languages. So it was farther north at a later
period, especially in Gaul and the British Islands. In all these countries the aboriginal inhabitants were originally of the Finnish race, we must suppose. It is very certain that they were neither Aryans nor Semites, and that the remote age when they first came under the control of the
Cushite influence had become mythical long before the first
irrival of the Pelasffinns in Italy.



The Pelasgians in Italy. 371
THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF ITALY.
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, justly described as one of the most diligent and accurate antiquaries of his time, states that the first Pelasgian immigrants who settled in Italy went from Arcadia "seventeen generations before the Trojan War." Their leader was CEnotrus; on this account they were called CEnotrians. There is no record or
trace of the appearance in Italy of any people of the Aryan race previous to this date, and yet the Pelasgians ma} have gone there earlier. Dionysius says : "Antiochus, an ancient historian, relates that the CEnotrians were the first
[Pelasgic] settlers known to have come into Italy ; that one of this race, called Italus, was a king ; and that Italus was succeeded by Morges, from whom the CEnotrians were
called Morgetes and Italians." The CEnotrians were fol
lowed by other Pelasgian colonies from Thessaly, and probably from other districts of the wide region occupied by
the Pelasgic race.
Italy was known to the Pelasgians as Tyrrhenia, and Unpeople were called Siculi, Umbrians, and Tyrrhenes. It is said that long and bloody wars ensued between the Pelas
gians and the Tyrrhenes ; the Pelasgians " pressed the Sic
uli [or Tyrrhenes] on all sides ;" they seized Croton, " ji town of the Umbrians, a very ancient people dispersed over many parts of Italy prior to the arrival of the Pelasgians ;" and "driving out the Siculi, they took many towns of the Tuscans, the Siculi passing over into Sicily, at that time
possessed by the Sicani, an Iberian tribe." But "the Pe
lasgians, having established themselves in Italy, fell into great calamities." The native inhabitants rose against them, overthrew their dominion, and resumed control oi



372 Pre-IIistoric Nations.
the country. The Pelasgi, it is said, greatly declined; some of them returned to Greece ; some may have fol
lowed others of the race who had previously gone farther west. Neither Kelts nor the Keltic tongue appeared in Italy through their influence. Those who remained after
these troubles were settled chiefly in Latium, and " afterwards founded Rome."
There is no good warrant for believing that any people
of the Aryan race appeared in Italy as immigrants except the Pelasgians, who doubtless went there not only from the Hellenic peninsula, but also from Asia Minor. Among
the various opinions expressed by scholars and archaeolo
gists concerning the original inhabitants and ancient his
tory of Italy, none deserves more respect, or has stronger support from reason and probability, than that of Professor Lepsius, who is sure there was no invasion or occupation
of Italy by any foreign people after it was conquered by the Pelasgians. After a duration of several centuries, probably, the Pelasgian power was overthrown by a succv rising of the original inhabitants. This restoration of the
Siculi, Umbrians, or original Tyrrhenes to power created what is known to us as Etruria. At a later period, the
Pelasgians of Latium rose successfully against the Tyrrhenian race, and established Rome. Nielmhr's theory that the Etrurians were a tribe from the Rhaetian Alps is not
supported by any record of antiquity, and it overlooks the
more obvious and probable explanation of the origin of Etruria. Doubtless there was a close ethnic relationship between the tribes of the Rhaetian Alps and the original inhabitants of Italy, but Etruria did not owe its existence
to their agency.
We know by their language, preserved in the Euguvine



Origin of the Tyrrhenes. 373
tablets and in other inscriptions, and by their religious and
social customs, that the original inhabitants of Italy did not
belong to the Aryan race. This was manifest to Dionysi
us of Halicarnassus, who says :
" That the Tyrrhenes and
Pelasgi were different peoples is proved by their languages, which had no resemblance; neither do I think the Tyrrhenes were a colony of Lydians, for there is no resemblance
here in language. These two people differed in laws, in
manners, and in institutions." The religious ideas and cus
toms, and the institutions of the Tyrrhenes, had a striking resemblance to those of the Eastern nations that had been
formed by Cushite influence. This has led many writers
into attempts to show that they came to Italy from the
East; but,. when Cushite antiquity and enterprise are properly recognised, it becomes much more probable that this unmistakable resemblance is due to the fact that the Siculi,
or Tyrrhenes, were civilized, and formed, socially and politically, by the Cushite people called Ethiopians. Their civilization appears to have been superior to that of the
Pelasgian race. The founders of Rome, in comparison with them, were little better than semi-barbarians ; and it may be doubted whether Rome, which far transcended Etruria
in political and military power, could justly claim any other superiority to the Etruscan civilization. I have pointed out that the original inhabitants of Italy,
whom Dionysius calls the "Aborigines," were a branch of
the Finnic race, anciently spread over nearly the whole of
Europe. To the same race probably belonged not only the Iberians and the Ligurians, but also perhaps the most ancient Illyrians, before they were intermixed with tribes of the Aryan race. If the various branches of the Finnic race
separated before they were civilized, a very close identity

of language and customs, at the period when they first engage the attention of history, would not be possible. The earliest establishments of the Arabian Cushite race in Italy, Spain, and Northwestern Africa may have been more than 3000 years older than the first arrival of the Pelasgians in Italy. Their aims were commercial, their methods of communication with other peoples were peaceful, and we must suppose that the civilization of the Tyrrhenes was origin
ally created by their influence. So far as appears at the
present time, the civilization of the Etruscans was much
higher than that of the Iberians. But, in this case, appear
ance is not a safe guide to reality. The Basques do not show us the whole extent of the ancient civilization of their
remote ancestors, and it requires no small amount of gratu
itous assumption to believe that the pre-historic civiliza
tion of Spain was inferior to that of Italy.
The Etruscan language, like that of the Basques, presents a problem which no philologist has been able to solve. It has engaged much attention, and from time to time there have been confident announcements that this and the
other ingenious scholar had penetrated the mystery, and found the clew to its genetic relationships, but it remains
still without an interpreter. Otfried Mtlller's learned
illations on the ancient dialects of Italy are worth no more than the curious and very amusing attempt of Sir William
Betham to translate the Euguvine tablets ; and Bethanf s
translation, which fills them with directions for night-sail
ing to Ireland, is quite as confident, and perhaps nearly as
correct, as that which finds on these tablets " the prayer^ and ceremonial rules of a fraternity of priests." The Umbrian and Etruscan inscriptions show us what remains of
the language of a people who were developed and formed



The word Africa explained. 375
by the Cushite civilization many ages before the Aryans
entered Italy, and, it may be, before the Pelasgian tribes
came from Inner Asia to the Mediterranean. Of course,
this language underwent many changes during the long
and eventful history of the ancient people by whom it was
used. How much the original tongue of this people was changed or influenced by the Cushite speech of their civ
ilizers, and to what extent it was aflected by other influences, can not be known.
WESTERN EUROPE, ANCIENTLY CALLED AFRICA.
Major Wilford's investigations led him to remark, in the
8th volume of the " Asiatic Researches," that " it is well known to the learned that, at a very remote period, Europe and Africa were considered as but one of two grand
divisions of the world, and that the appellation Africa was even extended to the western parts of Europe, all along the shores of the Atlantic." His fact will not be questioned ;
there may, however, be some question relative to its sig
nification. He points out that the word Africa comes from
Apar, Aphar, Apara, or Aparica, terms used, in times almost
forgotten by tradition, to signify " The West," just as we now, continuing the ancient method of designation, call
most of the Asiatic world " The East." It is only since the time of the Romans that the word Africa has become a name for one of the grand divisions of the globe. In the most ancient times the eastern part of
that grand division was called " Sancha," a term that still
remains in the wr ords Zengh, Zenghbhar, Zanguebar, Zingis, and the like ; while the northern, and especially the
northwestern part, was designated as Apar, Aparica, Afari
ca, and finally Africa. We must suppose that, in early pre



376 Pre-Historic Nations.
historic times, Northern Africa and Western Europe had strongly engaged the attention of civilized nations in Asia ;
that in Asia they were described as " The West ;" and that this remote Western world had risen to such eminence be
cause it was, to a large extent, occupied by civilized peoples who had made it important. Spain, as Heeren re
marks, " was the Peru of antiquity;" but in that Western world there was much besides gold and silver to command attention and attract commercial enterprise.
It seems to me impossible to study the Greek literature
carefully without perceiving that the people on the eastern shores of the Mediterranean knew more of Western Europe in the time of Homer than in the time of Strabo, and much more in the ages previous to IlonuT than when he wrote. I have discussed the fact that many of the old
est myths relate to Spain, Northwestern Africa, and other
regions on the Atlantic, such as those concerning Hercules, the Cronida?, the Hyperboreans, the llesperides, and the Islands of the Blessed. Strabo, while admitting that Homer described the Atlantic region of Europe in his account
of the wanderings of Ulysses, shows, nevertheless, a very remarkable ignorance of that region, which comes out in
what he says of Ireland, and especially in his ill-tempered and coarse attack on Pytheas of Massilia, an eminent astronomer and navigator, who, about the time of Alexander the Great, sailed to Thule or Iceland, and to a point in Northern Europe where, from a mountain, he Leheld the midnight sun. In the ages previous to the decline of Pho3
nician influence in Greece and around the ^Egean Sea, the people of those regions must have had a much better knowl
edge of Western Europe than prevailed there during either the Ionian or the Hellenic period, when actual information



Diodorus on the Hyperboreans. 377
seems to have given place to imperfect recollections of what had been known in the earlier times. Diodorus Sicu
lus (bk. ii., ch. iii.) records some of these recollections as
follows : "Among those who have written old stories that sound like fables, Hecataeus and some others say there is an island
in the ocean, over against Gaul, where the Hyperboreans dwell, so called because they are beyond the north wind.
The soil is very rich and fruitful, and the climate temper
ate. They say Latona was born there, and that Apollo is
worshipped in that island above all other gods. In very ancient times the Hyperboreans had a special kindness for the Greeks, especially for the Athenians and the Delians ; and in those times some of the Greeks visited the Hyper
boreans and left presents, and Abaris, from the Hyperboreans, traveled into Greece, and renewed the ancient league
with the Delians." It is said, also, that in this island Apollo
" had a stately grove and a renowned temple, of a round form, beautified with many gifts."
The story of Abaris is told by other writers, and there are repeated accounts of sacred embassies and offerings from the Hyperboreans to the temple at Delos. Some of the Irish antiquarians, whose facts are frequently better than their judgment, cite an old Irish poem which describes a journey of Abhras and others from Ireland to Greece, and they claim that this Abhras was the Abaris of Hecataaus. Probably the British Islands were all known as Hy
perborean Islands ; but that supposition seems most probable which identifies the circular temple of Apollo described
by Hecataeus with the great temple at Abury, in England. The Arabian Cushites, who created the Age of Bronze on the western shores and islands of Europe, must have had



378 Pre-Historic Nations.
an accurate knowledge of that region many centuries be
fore the Aryan people became important in Asia Minor
and Greece, and, through their influence in both regions, sacred embassies from the Hyperboreans to Delos were
quite possible. Apollo, according to Herodotus the same as Orus of the Egyptians, was a Cushite deity, borrowed from the Cushites by the Greeks with nearly all the rest of their gods and their mythology, or rather received with
many other great gifts of the Cushite civilization. Sun
worship, represented by Apollo under various names, was likely to appear in some form wherever the influence of
this people was established.
THE OLD SANSKRIT BOOKS ON WESTERN EUROPK.
This ancient knowledge of Western Europe cxtendi'd to India. Recollections of it are recorded in the old Sanskrit books, of which Major Wilford gave an account in the eleventh volume of the Asiatic Researches. The Brahmanical
mythology, as we have it, combines the gods and mythological legends brought into India by the Aryan race with those of the Cushites which the invading Aryans found there. This may explain why the Sanskrit records tell us
so much of Africa and Europe. According to the Puranic
traditions, there was, in very remote times, much communication between India and the western part of Europe. The Varaha Purana describes that region with the accu
racy of actual knowledge. AVilford, quoting this description, and reproducing an old Puranic map of AVi>t( rn
Europe, says: "Here we may trace the Bay of Biscay, the German Sea, and the entrance into the Baltic ; but, above
all, the greatest resemblance appears in the arrangement of the British Islands and Iceland ; this surely cannot be
merely accidental.''



Sanskrit Names of ITeland. * 379
England is variously designated, but is usually called Sweta or Swetam :
" Sweta-Saila, or the White Cliffs, is often used, which is literally the Leucas-Petra of Homer, and Al-Fionn in Gaelic." Homer placed his Leucas-Petra at the extremities of the earth, in the ocean, near the settino
f -J O
sun. The Argonautics, ascribed to Orpheus, call England Leucon- Cherson, the White Country, and it is placed in the
Western Ocean, with lerne or Ireland. The Sanskrit " Su
varna-dwipa, the land of Suvarna or of gold, is also called Hiranya, a denomination of the same import. Hiranya and
Suvarneya are obviously the same as lerne, Erin, and Juvernia, ancient names of Ireland. Another name for Ireland is Surya-dwipa, Island of the Sun [or the land of sun
worship] ; and it was probably the old garden of Phoebus
of the western mythologists." England, " the White Island, is considered as the abode of the mighty; Havana, in the
Ramayana, inquires where the mighty ones dwell, and is told by Narada that they dwell in the White Island. The most ancient inhabitants of Britain, in their romances,
called it the White Island, and Ynys-y- Ceideirn, the Island of the Mighty Ones."
In the Sanskrit books the British Islands are described as " The Sacred Isles of the West." The White Island, or
England, was " the land of Tarpana" or of " libations to the Pitris ;" and it seems to have been the Therapnse of
the Argonautics. It is called the land of Tapas, or the
most proper country for performing tapasya (religious austerity), which Wilford identifies with the blessed Theba or Thebai of the ancient Greeks. "In the Santiparva, one of the greater divisions of the Mahabharata, Narada goes to
Sweta-dw.ipa, in the far northwest, to worship the original form of Narayana, which resides in that island." Wilford

stated that, in modern times, Hindu pilgrims have attempt
ed to visit the " Sacred Islands of the West," and added :
"A Yogi now living is said to have advanced with his
train of pilgrims as far as Moscow ; but, annoyed by the great and troublesome curiosity of the Russians, he turned back. He would probably have been exposed to similar inconveniences in the Sacred Isles, not excepting Breta
sfhan, or the place of religious duty." Before Old Tyre was founded before Martu or Marathos became the ruling city of the people called Phoeni
cians, it may be in the ages when Beirut, Byblos or Gebal, and Joppa or lopia, were the chief cities of that people on the Eastern Mediterranean, or oven previous to the time
of their greatness an important civilization had grown up in Northwestern Africa, in Spain, and in some other places on the Atlantic coast of Europe, under Cushite influence, with which the great civilized peoples of Southwestern Asia were well acquainted. There was constant communication with that region until this intercourse was inter
rupted by political changes throughout the Mediterranean world, of which history can give no explanation. All this was very much older than Assyria. Traces of it remain in
the oldest myths and records of Greece, India, and Egypt,
which, however, do not fully reveal their significance to those who cannot see the antiquity and importance of the
Cushite civilization of Arabia. Its origin and history wt-iv doubtless fully described in the* ancient Phoenician records, but the language in which these records were written must have become a dead language before the Assyrian empire
appeared.



The old Keltic Civilization. 3S1
THE ANCIENT HISTORY OF IRELAND.
The Keltic countries of Western Europe, when first invaded by the Romans, were all civilized countries. In
this respect their condition was much higher than history, directed by Roman influence, is accustomed to admit. It
would be unwarranted and improbable assumption to suppose they had, at that time, the highest condition of civilization they had ever known. They must have declined with that decline of Phoenician power and commercial enterprise which interrupted their communication with the
East. But they still had intelligence, wealth, and import
ance. We can see that their skill in many of the arts of civilized life was nowise inferior to that of the Romans
themselves. They had a literature which, in some of the
countries, was abundant and important, although the Romans give us no account of it. If Roman scholars had
carefully studied the Keltic language, literature, and an
tiquities, and faithfully recorded the result of such studies, we should not now begin our histories of Great Britain with the invasion of Caesar, nor would the most presuming historical skepticism fail to treat the ancient history of
that part of Europe with some respect. In the time of Julius Caesar, Turdetania and Ireland appear to have had the most advanced condition of the Keltic
civilization. Turdetania, like most of the Keltic countries
in Spain and elsewhere on the Continent, became entirely Romanized. The Turdetani forgot their language, lost
their literature, changed their manners, and were so entirely transformed by the conquerors that Strabo said of them,
" they have, for the most part, become Latins." The Ro
mans did not go to Ireland, although, in their time, its com

merce, wealth, and culture made it the most important of
the Keltic countries. On this point Tacitus says, in hi?
life of Agricola: "Melius (Hiberniae quam Britannia?) adi
tus portusque per commercia et negociatores cogniti ;" that is to say, "the ports of Ireland are better known through
commerce, and more frequented by merchants, than those of Britain."
Ireland escaped the destructive influence of a Roman invasion, outlived the Roman empire, and maintained its in
dependence until the time of Henry Second of England more than 1200 years after the invasion of Britain by Ju
lius Caesar, and about 750 years after the Romans retired
from that country. It retained its Keltic institutions, laws, and literature for more than 1200 years after all the other Keltic countries had been subjugated and transformed. There was but little internal change in Ireland for a long
time after the princes of that country, with their king, submitted to the sway of Henry Second. The old Irish lan
guage has not yet wholly disappeared from the country,
an<l it is not very long since it was the prevalent speech
in all the provinces. This explains why the Keltic antiquities and ancient writings have appeared to be so much more abundant in Ireland than elsewhere, and why Toland was able to say.
with so much truth, " There remain [in Ireland] very main
ancient manuscripts undoubtedly genuine," and the Irish '* have incomparably more ancient materials of that kind
for their history, to which even their mythology is not un
serviceable, than either the English or the French, or any other European nation with whose manuscripts I have any acquaintance." In Gaul and Spain the destruction was

which was not wholly transformed by the Roman occupa
tion, no remaining literary monuments of any importance escaped the influence of the fierce and successful Anglo
Saxon invasion. Gildas, who wrote in the sixth century, stated that the old Keltic histories of Britain no longer ex
isted in his time, all the ancient books having been de
stroyed by the ravage of war, or taken to foreign countries and lost by self-exiled or banished natives of the island.
The Welsh books are comparatively modern, and of no great account so far as relates to British antiquity; but
the Irish books show us, to some extent, the history, institutions, and culture of that country in very ancient times ; and we can see in them the truth of Toland's statement,
that " the most valuable pieces [of the Irish], both in prose and verse, were written by their heathen ancestors, whereof some, indeed, have been interpolated since the introduction
of Christianity, which additions or alterations, nevertheless, are easily detected."
If we had nothing more than that important collection of laws known as the Senchus-Mor or Brehon laws, there would be enough to show the antiquity of the old Irish civilization and literature. This collection is older than the Christian Era, yet it must have been the growth of
many previous ages of civilized life. The language in which it was written seems to have become a dead lan
guage in the fifth century, when it was revised, "purged of heathenism," and rendered into the current Irish of that
age, under the superintendence of Bishop Patricius, usually called St. Patrick, although the true St. Patrick lived more
than three centuries earlier.* This expurgating Patricius,

or some other fanatic, did more ; he collected and committed to the flames a vast number of the ancient books, desiring, with barbarous fanaticism, to wipe out and hide from remembrance everything that related to the Druid
ical learning and religion. The language of this revision of the Senchus-Mor was itself antiquated and dead in the time of Henry Second, but the work was studied and used long after that time. It has lately been translated into
English. The Irish historical books have preserved a regular list of the kings of Ireland from the earliest times, with brief
annals of each reign; 136 kings previous to the arrival of
Bishop Patricius in the year 432 A.D. are enumerated, all
royally descended except one, who " was a plebeian called Carbry Caithean. Brief annals, kept regularly from year to year, seem to have been very abundant in the olden
times, for every local prince, as well as the king, had his
Ollamh to write such records. Keating says, in his history of Ireland, "It is evident that in former times there wore
constantly more than 200 principal annalists and historians in the kingdom, who had handsome revenues. Every nobleman of any quality retained a number of these learned men." The old annals, reproduced and continued from age to age by these men, were used by writers of more ex
tensive histories; but in the year 1630 A.D. they had suffered greatly by the waste of time. In that year a learned Irish nobleman, Ferall O'Gara, took measures to secure a careful compilation of such as then remained. The work was done by four Irish monks. This compilation, known
the Irish Church, which was three centuries older than his time. Some antiquarians doubt his existence ; but he was probably the same Patriciu* who was afterwards bishop of Auvergne.

as "Annals of the Kingdom of Ireland, by the Four Mas
ters," has been printed in seven quarto volumes, with the Irish text on one page and an English translation opposite.
All the histories of Ireland give substantially the same
account of the early times, and of the kings who reigned previous to the Christian Era. The greatest event described in Irish ancient history is the conquest of the island by "the sons of Milidh" or Milcsius, who came from Spain
with a large fleet and a strong army. According to the
chronology of the " Four Masters," this took place about the year 1700 B.C.; but more probable accounts fix the date nearly four centuries later. These Milesians had been
preceded by other successful invaders. The earliest com
pany o'f invading immigrants are described as "Parthalon's
people," who found in the island a people called Fomho
raicc, Fom'oraig Afraic, and Formoragh, rendered into English as Formorians. These Formorians are sometimes
described as " natives," and sometimes it is said that they
came in ships to fight Parthalon's people and subsequent invaders. The uniform representation is that they came
originally from Africa. It may be supposed that they represent the first communities established or civilized in Ireland by immigrants from the Pho3nician or Cushite settle
ments in Africa or Spain. They treated Parthalon's people
with invincible hostility. After about thirty years, Parthalon died of a wound received in battle with them, and
his colony became extinct.
The next invading immigrants were led by Neimhidh,
who captured a stronghold of the Formorians ; but after a short time the fortress was retaken by More, the Formo
rian leader, who had " a fleet of sixty ships, and a strong
army." This defeat was so overwhelming to Neimhidh

that most of his people fled from the island to Britain. A long period elapsed about 400 years some of the accounts say before there was another invasion. Then came the
Fir-Bolgs, a strong people divided into three tribes, and called Fir-Bolgs from the name of the principal tribe.
They conquered the whole island, and divided it into five
provinces; a division, say the Irish writers, that has never
been seriously disturbed, excepting that what is now Minister was then divided into two provinces. But the rule
of the Fir-Bolgs lasted only 37 years, during which time they had nine kings, who appear in the lists as the first
nine kings of Ireland. They were displaced by the Tuatha
de-Dananns, a people evidently more advanced in civilization than any of the previous invaders, who came 'with a
powerful army, and overthrew the Fir-Bolgs in a great battle that is famous in the Irish Annals. Nuadha, king of
the Tuatha-de-Dananns, lost his hand in this battle, and
" Creidne, the artificer, put a silver hand upon him." All accounts agree in saying the rule of the Tuatha-de-Dananns lasted 197 years, and that they had nine kings, of
whom the last three reigned jointly. Their dominion wa.> overthrown by the sons of Milidh.

peoples in the island. These Milesians were Kelts; but some of the earlier invasions must have taken place pre
vious to that Aryan immigration into Western Europe which, by absorbing the civilized Finnish and Cushite peo
ples found there, in Spain, Gaul, and the British Islands, created the Keltic race. Perhaps the Milesians were the
first Kelts that appeared in Ireland. It is not creditable to English scholarship that those who represent it have given no more attention to the old
language and literature of Ireland, but the explanation is
not difficult. We find it in that invincible scorn and dis
dain of the English for everything Irish by which the relation between the two countries has been made so unprofit
able to both, and so injurious to Ireland in all respects.
Without friendly and careful investigation, it has been rudely assumed that the Irish language and literature were not worth attention ; therefore they have been neg
lected. It is to be lamented that this important field was not worked carefully two or three centuries ago, when the old manuscripts were more abundant and the language was in general use among the Irish, for much has been
lost. Without accepting either the dates, the glosses, or
the ethnical speculations of the later Irish writers, we must admit that the general outline and main facts of Irish history furnished by the old records of the country cannot
reasonably be discredited nor shown to be improbable.
On the contrary, they are in harmony with what we know>
or may reasonably presume, concerning Western Europe in p re-historic times. The monuments of the Age of Bronze, as well as v, ^d{i we know of the antiquity and the
colonizing enterprise of the Arabian Cushites, make this Irish claim to antiquity probable, and forbid us to treat it



388 Prc-Historic Nations.
with such contempt as has been so largely bestowed upon
it. This is a case where contemptuous skepticism dishon
ors those only who indulge it.
We know very well, without reading the Irish Annals, that Ireland was an independent nation, having its own kings, institutions, and civilization more than two thousand years ago, and that it remained so until its princes,
moved by papal influence, submitted to the English. It was an independent monarchy in the time of the Romans.
Ptolemy described its cities ; Tacitus mentioned its import
ance ; and it is prominently mentioned by writers of earlier
ages. We cannot reasonably discredit that portion of the Irish Annals which relates to the ages since the Romans
began their subjugation of the Keltic countries; nothing but the intolerance of contemptuous prejudice is capable of doing this. It is no more reasonable to reject the Irish claim to antiquity, and treat with disdain the older annals
of the country. The Irish people seem to have reached the highest con
dition of their civilization and culture in the time of the
great sovereign known in their annals as Ollamli Eodhla, who reigned long before the Christian Era ; but they were eminent for culture in times ablate as the \<>rman Con
quest of England. No one familiar with what is recorded
of the history of England between the time ofllenirist and that of William the Conqueror has failed to observe that
Ireland at that time was the most enlightened country of Western Europe. It had the best scholars and the most advanced condition of learning. Mosheim says in his Ec
clesiastical History, "The philosophy and logic taught in the- European schools in' the ninth century scarce!;. served such honorable titles, and were little better than

empty jargon. There were, however, to be found in various places, particularly among the Irish, men of acute parts and extensive knowledge, who were well entitled to be called philosophers." Among the learned Irishmen of that age was the celebrated Scotus. Gildas, according to his bi
ographer, went to Ireland for education, and studied in its
schools " the highest forms of philosophy and literature ;"
and Camden tells us that " the Saxons, from all places, flocked to Ireland as the emporium of letters." If the Nor
mans had failed to conquer England, the language and culture of the English race would now be different, and we
should have been taught greater respect for the language, antiquities, ancient history, and old literature of the Irish
race.
THE KELTIC LANGUAGE.
Philologists arrange the known Keltic tongues in two divisions : the Gadhelic, embracing the Irish, the Gaelic of Scotland, and the dialect of the Isle of Man ; and the Cym
ric, comprising the Welsh, the Cornish, and the Armorican of Brittany. There may have been other branches of this
family that became extinct under Roman influence. The
language of the Kelts after much doubt concerning its
character, that has been removed by careful investigation is now classed as a branch of the Aryan family. Its Ary
an characteristics were not immediately obvious. Profess
or Craik, in his " Manual of English Literature," says :
" Probably any other two languages of the entire multi
tude held to be of this general stock [Indo-European or Aryan] would unite more readily than two of which only one is Celtic. It would be nearly the same case with that of the intermixture of an Indo-European with a Semitic



390 Pre-HistoTiG Nations.
language. It has been suggested that the Celtic branch
must, in all probability, have diverged from the common stem at a much earlier date than any of the others."
An accomplished American scholar, Professor Whitney speaking of Professor Schleicher's scheme of relationship for all branches of the Aryan family, observes that the po
sition assigned in it to the Keltic languages repels rather
than attracts assent. According to Professor Schleicher, their development was later than that of most other branches of the family, and they are more closely related to Latin
than to any other Aryan tongue. This close relationship of the Aryan elements of the Keltic speech to that of the Latins cannot be denied ; the more carefully and thorough
ly the two languages are compared, the more clearly will this fact be presented to the investigator. It suggests that the Aryan people, whose influence in Western Europe created Keltica and the Keltic tongues, were Pelasgians from Italy. These Pelasgians found in those Western countries
a people of another race, who, long before their arrival, had been civilized by the Arabian Cushites. What hap
pened in England at a later period, when the Saxons and
Norman French were brought together in that country, must have occurred in this case, with results still more re
markable, for here the peoples were not of the same race. There was a fusion of two races, and of two languages that did not belong to the same family. This fusion developed
the Keltic tongues. The Pelasgian language, while retaining most of its fundamental characteristics, and thus pre
serving its relationship to the Aryan family, was, to a great extent, transformed. It became the Keltic tongue. The decay and new growth that obscured its Aryan features may thus be explained, without assuming that the Keltic

tongues constitute a branch of the Aryan family, which
" separated from the common stem at a much earlier date than any of the others."
Keltica consisted only of Gaul, Spain, and the British
Islands. According to the Irish records, the Keltic people and language went to Ireland from Spain, and from Ireland to Scotland. They may have gone to England and "Wales from Gaul. In Spain and a portion of Southern France the fusion of races and tongues was never complete. Large communities of the old Iberian people, now
represented by the Basques, were entirely unaffected by it. This may have been due not only to the position of the districts they inhabited, but also to some difference in blood
and language, caused by important changes in the othei Iberian communities, which did not reach the Basques, but
left them to represent more accurately the speech and blood
of the earlier ages. An authentic record of the ancient
times would explain much that is now left to conjecture. Even a history of1 the Keltic tongues would give us important historical information. But we have no such history, and no trace of any Keltic dialect that does not be
long to either the Gadhelic or the Cymric family. It may
be that the Gadhelic family represents the language as it was spoken in Spain, and the Cymric the form in which it
appeared in Gaul ; but our knowledge of the Keltic speech, which is limited to the Irish and Welsh, with a few kindred
dialects, does not allow us to speak on this point with any
degree of certainty. There was no such fusion of tongues in any other country of Western Europe. The other branches of the Aryan
family kept their language free from corrupting mixtures. In some cases they fiercely expelled the old inhabitants of



302 Pre-Historic Nations.
the countries where they settled. So it was in Scandina* via, where the old Norse immigrants treated the Finns
with perpetual hostility, and described them as " jotuns," demons, beings of an accursed race. There is no record or
tradition that tells when the first group of the Aryan race
appeared in Central or Western Europe. The people represented by the Lithuanians and the Letts appear to have
been the earliest immigrants ; the old Prussians belonged
to this group. Next probably came the Slavonians, who settled in Poland and other countries of Central Europe.
The Teutonic family, including several distinct groups, came later to the countries where history found them. It
may be that all these immigrations preceded that of the
Pelasgians into Spain and Gaul, but it does not seem probable that any group of the Teutonic family appeared in
Sweden, Denmark, or even Germany, previous to the beginning of the Keltic age. It is more likely that this family came latest, and that it arrived in Germany and the more Western countries but a few centuries in advance of
the Roman invasion, or at a period considerably later than the beginning of the Age of Iron. All these families of the Aryan race, however, may have been in Eastern Europe a long time before any of them appeared at the West.
ANCIENT COMMUNICATION WITH AMKKICA.
Was America known to the ancients? I shall not undertake here a full discussion of this question, wli id, requires a careful consideration of the monuments and literary remains of the ancient civilizations found in America
when this continent was discovered by Columbus. What
I have to say on the subject will be limited to a brief statement of the grounds on which those whose inquiries have

been conducted with most care and intelligence believe there was communication between the Old World and America in very remote times. They find the evidence of this communication in the ruins and traditions of the an
cient American civilizations, as well as in the traditions
and myths of classical antiquity. We will begin with what is found in America. 1. The antiquities of Mexico and Central America reveal
religious symbols, devices, and ideas nearly identical with those found in all countries of the Old World where Cush
ite communities formerly existed. They show us planet
worship, with its usual orphic and phallic accompaniments. Humboldt, having traveled in America, and observed remains of these civilizations, was convinced that such communication formerly existed. Pie found evidence of it in
the religious symbols, the architecture, the hieroglyphics, and the social customs made manifest by the ruins, which he was sure came from the other side of the ocean ; and, in his view, the date of this communication was older than
" the present division of Asia into Chinese, Mongols, Hin
dus," etc. [See his "Researches concerning the Institutions and Monuments ofthe Ancient People of America."] Humboldt did not observe symbols of the phallic worship, but the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg shows that they were described by Spanish writers at the time of the Conquest.
He points out that they were prevalent in the countries of Mexico and Central America, being very abundant at Colhuacan on the Gulf of California, and at Panuco. Col
huacan was a flourishing city, and the capital of an im
portant kingdom; "there," he says, "phallic institutions had existed from time immemorial." At Panuco phallic symbols abounded in the temples and on the public mon

uments. These, with the serpent devices, the sun worship, and the remarkable knowledge of astronomy that existed in connection with them, show a system of religion of which the Abbe is constrained to say: "Asia appears to have
been the cradle of this religion, and of the social institututions which it consecrated." The Abbe Brasseur de
Bourbourg has studied American antiquities more pro
foundly than any other investigator. He has a very important collection of the books of the ancient people of .Mexico and Central America, one of which, "The Popol Vuh," he has translated into French ; and he has written
in the same language, and published in four octavo vol
umes, a " History of the Civilized Nations of Mexico and Central America during the Ages before Christopher Columbus," the materials for the work being taken from the old books he has collected or examined.
2. The traditions of these countries are still more explicit. Their uniform testimony is, that the ancient Amer
ican civilization came originally from the East across the
ocean. In Sahagun's history, it is stated that, according to the traditions of the people ofYucatan, the original civ
ilizers came in ships from the East. A similar tradition was communicated to the Spaniards by Monte/uma. The Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg, speaking of the earliest civ
ilization of the Mexicans and Central Americans, says :
" The native traditions generally attribute it to bearded white- men, who came across the ocean from the cast." The native histories he has examined describe thr
of ancient inhabitants. First, the Chichimecs, who to have been the uncivilized aborigines of the country;
second, the Colhuas, who were the first civilizers, and ly wliom the Chichimecs were taught to cultivate the earth,



Ancient American Traditions. 395
cook their food, and adopt the usages of civilized life ; and, third, the Nahuas or Toltecs, who came much later as peaceable immigrants, but after a time united with un
civilized Chichimecs, caused a civil war, and secured power. The Colhuas were the bearded white men, who came in the earliest times across the Atlantic. They built Palenqu > and other cities, originated the oldest and finest monuments of the ancient civilization, and established the great
kingdom of Xibalba, which is celebrated in the histories
and traditions. It comprised Guatemala, Chiapas, Yucatan, and probaJbly other countries. Desire Charnay, speaking of the ruins at Mitla, points out that the most ancient
architecture, paintings, mosaics, and artistic designs are ii
the highest style, and show "marvelous workmanship,"' while the later additions are in a much lower style, and seem to be the work of a people less advanced in cultuiv and skill than the original founders of the city. The finest and most remarkable monuments in these countries seen; to be remains of that ancient kingdom of Xibalba. It i; said repeatedly that "the Colhuas came from beyond the sea, and directly from the east." The Abbe makes this statement also: "There was a constant tradition amon<.' the people who dwelt on the Pacific Ocean that peoplt from distant nations beyond the Pacific formerly came to trade at the ports of Coatulco and Pechugui, which b(
longed to the kingdom of Tehuantepec." The traditions of Peru told of people who came to that country by sea, and landed on the Pacific coast. The reader will remen; ber that there was anciently a great maritime empire of
the Malays, and that dialects of the Malay language ni < scattered across the Pacific Ocean as far as Easter Island.
Such, very briefly stated, are the chief points in the ti-s



396 Prc-IIistoric Nations.
timony of the antiquities and traditions found in America.
We will now turn to the ancient myths and traditions of the Old World.
In the traditions, legends, and mythical geography of the ancients, there is much that has no meaning if it does not preserve vague recollections of very ancient knowledge of America. The mythical references to a great con
tinent beyond the " Cronian Sea," meaning the Atlantic. Plutarch's mention of a great Cronian or Saturnian continent, the Atlantis of Solon and Plato, and the Merope
of Theopompus, all belong to a circle of very ancient tra
ditions, with which many are familiar. There is nothing in the history of the human mind that allows us to treat
them as pure fictions. The mythical story of the Atlantic Island which Solon brought from Egypt was not entirely new in Greece. The invasion of the East, to which it re
fers, seems to have given rise to the Panathensea, the old
est, greatest, and most splendid festivals in honor of Athena celebrated in Attica. These festivals are said to have been established by Erichthonius in the most ancient times remembered by the historical t radit ions of Athens. Bocckh
says of them in his Commentary on Plato : "In the greater Panathena3a there was carried in proces
sion a peplum of Minerva, representing the Avar witli the giants and the victory of the gods of Olympus. In the lesser Panathenaea they carried another /";//'//// [co\
with symbolic devices], which showed how the Athenians, supported by Minerva, had the advantage in the Avar with
the Atlantes." A scholia quoted from Proclus by Hum
boldt and Boeckh says, " The historians who speak of the islands of the exterior sea tell us that in their time thenwere seven islands consecrated to Proserpine, and three



Atlantis and Xibalba. 397
others of immense extent, of which the first was consecrated to Pluto, the second to Ammon, and the third to Neptune. The inhabitants of the latter had preserved a recollection
(transmitted to them by their ancestors) of the island of
Atlantis, which was extremely large, and for a long time held sway over all the islands of the Atlantic Ocean. Atlantis also was consecrated to Neptune." [See Humboldt's
Histoire de la Geographic du Nouveau Continent, vol. i.]
The knowledge of America signified by these myths and traditions must be referred to a very remote antiquity to a period as much older than the time of the Tyrians as that of the first civilization of Spain and Northwestern Africa was older than the building of Gades. If, as seems prob
able, this knowledge was a reality, the people who communicated with America must have gone from the great nation created on the Western Mediterranean by the earliest Cushite communities established in that region. If that communication lasted a thousand years, the age in which it was discontinued would have been mythical long before the time when the Tyrians began to establish settlements at the West. What we know of the rise and de
cline of important nations, and of the great political changes to which such nations are liable, suggests how it may have been interrupted. The Goths and Vandals did not continue the great enterprises of the Romans. There may have been dark as well as bright ages in the history of these great countries at the West. De Bourbourg, in one of the notes of the Introduction to
his translation of the Popol-Vuh, which gives a mythical
history of very ancient times in Central America, presents for consideration a remarkable analogy between the kingdom of Xibalba and the mythical account of the island of
Atlantis. He says :



398 Pre-Histomc Nations.
"Without seeking to advance any particular opinion
on the subject, it seems to me useful to call the reader's
attention to the analogies presented between the empire of Xibalba and that of Atlantis as described in Plato's
Critias. Both countries are magnificent, exceedingly fertile, and abound in the precious metals ; the empire of At
lantis was divided into ten kingdoms, governed by live
couples of twin sons of Poseidon, the eldest being supreme over the others; and the ten constituted a tribunal that
managed the affairs of the empire. Their descendants gov
rrm-d after them. The ten kings of Xibalba, who reigned [in couples] under Hun-Came and Vukub-Came [and who together constituted a grand council of the kingdom], cer
tainly furnish curious points of comparison. And there is
wanting neither a catastrophe [for Xibalba had a terrific
inundation] nor the name of Atlas, of which the etymol* ogy is found only in the Nahuatl tongue ; it comes from </'/, water, and we know that a city of .4&m,Xear the AVaill ( '\i-ted on the Atlantic side of the Isthmus of Panama at the time of the Conquest." In Peru, as in the countries comprised in that ancient
kingdom of Xibalba, the oldest civilization was the most advanced, and had the highest style of art and mechanics] skill. Here, too, the oldest structures were attributed to bearded white men, who, it is said, worked stone with iron
implements brought from their own country. The tradi
tions call them " sons of the sea." It is a remarkable fact, not generally known, that the Incas worked iron mines on the east side of Lake Titicaca. [See Introduction to Po
pol-Vuh, p. 224.] Planet worship, temples of the sun, and great knowledge of astronomy existed in Peru at a very early period. Montesinos and De Bourbourg say th



Phoenicians find America. 399
ruvians had an accurate measure of the solar year, and a
knowledge of the art of writing, together with paper made
of banana leaves, " at least 1800 years before our era." De Bourbourg thinks large numbers of Colhuas may have migrated from Central America to Peru.
There is in Diodorus Siculus, book v,, chap, ii., an im
portant passage concerning America which is not mythical, and seems to be given as a historical fact rather than
as a tradition. He says :
" Over against Africa lies a very
great island in the vast ocean, many days' sail -from Libya westward. The soil is very fruitful. It is diversified with mountains and pleasant vales, and the towns are adorned
with stately buildings." After describing the gardens, orchards, and fountains, he tells how this pleasant country was discovered. The Phoenicians, he says, having built
Gades, sailed along the Atlantic coast of Africa. A Phoe
nician ship, voyaging down this coast, was, " on a sudden, driven by a furious storm far into the main ocean ; and,
after they had lain under this tempest many days, they at length arrived at this island." There have been attempts
to believe that the great land of civilized people thus dis
covered was either the Cassiterides or one of the Canary Islands. Look on the map, and judge whether such a belief is possible to a reasonable mind. The land reached by
the Phosnicians of that tempest-driven ship is more likely to have been some part of Central America or Yucatan, where at that time stood the great cities now in ruins. There is a similar statement in a work attributed to Aris
totle (de Mirab. Auscult.), in which the discovery is ascribed to the Carthaginians ; but the statement of Diodorus
is most particular, and evidently most correct. Humboldt
[La Geographic du Nbuveau Continent,]). 191] cites a pas'



400 Pre-Historic Nations,
sage of Plutarch, in which he thinks, with Ortelius, that not only the Antilles, but the American continent itself,
is described, for it is the " Great Continent" of which lie
speaks beyond the ocean ; and one of the speakers in the dialogue gives an account of what was told of the Satin-nian Continent by a stranger who came from it to Car
thage. The extract from Theopompus relating to America is fa
miliar to scholars, but not, perhaps, to general readers.
Julian, in his " Varia Historia" [book iii., chap, xviii.], tells us that Theopompus related the particulars of an interview
between Midas, king of Phrygia, and Silenus, in which Silenus reported the existence of a great continent beyond
the Atlantic " larger than Asia, Europe, and Libya togeth
er." He stated that a race of men, called Meropes, dwelt there, and had extensive cities. The statement of Theo
pompus went on to say that the Meropes were persuaded that their country alone was a continent. Out of curiu>ity, some of them crossed the ocean and visited the Hyper
boreans. De Bourbourg, referring to those who talk of
these distinct references to America as " fictions," says very
justly, "If the story of Theopompus is a fiction, it is, like 'The Incas' of Manumit el, founded on fact."
It is now a historical fact that the Northmen, sailing from Iceland, not only discovered America in the tenth century, but also established colonies on the coast of Ne\v KiiLrland, and that they preserved communication with these colonies for two centuries. Most readers are familiar witli the story of these discoveries and settlements of the
Northmen. It is not so well known, but is, nevertheless
quite true, that they were preceded in Iceland by the Iri>h, and in voyages to America by the Irish and the Basques



Eastern Asia and America. 401
The Basques, being adventurous fishermen, and extensively engaged in the whale fishery, were accustomed to visit the northeast coast of America long before the time of Colum
bus, and probably " from time immemorial." [See Michel's
"Les Pays Basques," and De Bourbourg's Introduction.] There is no scarcity of reports and traditions of Irish voyages to America, but I will do no more than cite a fact recorded by the Abbe Brasseur de Bourbourg in a note to
his translation of the Popol-Vuh. He says :
" There is an abundance of legends and traditions concerning the passage of the Irish into America, and their habitual communication with that continent many centu
ries before the time of Columbus. We should bear in mind that Ireland was colonized by the Phoenicians [or by peo
ple of that race]. An Irish saint, named Yigile, who lived
in the eighth century, was accused to Pope Zachary of having taught heresies on the subject of the antipodes. At first he wrote to the pope in reply to the charge, but aft
erwards he went to Rome in person to justify himself, and there he proved to the pope that the Irish had been accustomed to communicate with a trans-Atlantic world." This fact seems to have been preserved in the records of the Vatican. It is known that knowledge of the American continent existed in China and Japan long before the time of Columbus. The Abbe de Bourbourg says in his Introduction to
the Popol-Yuh, " It has been known to scholars nearly a century that the Chinese were acquainted with the American continent in the fifth century of our era. Their ships
visited it. They called it Fu-$ang, and said it was situated at the distance of 20,000 li from Ta-Han" M. Leon
de Rosny has ascertained that Fasang is the topic of " a



402 Pre-Historic N-atiom.
curious notice in the WaJcan-san-tai-dzon-ye" (which is the name of the great Japanese Encyclopaedia). In that work Fusang is said to be situated east of Japan, beyond the
ocean, at the distance of about 20,000 li (7000 miles or
more) from Ta-nan-kouek. De Bourbourg, who quotes the
notice, adds : " Readers who may desire to make compari
sons between the Japanese description of Fusang and some country in America will find astonishing analogies in the countries described by Castaneda and Fra Marcos de Xiza, in the province of Cibola."
The Chinese and Japanese do not give us myths ; they tell us what they have actually known for many centuries. The Welsh prince Madog, about the year 1170 A.D., was
just as certain of the existence of America when " he sailed
away westward, going south of Ireland," to find a land of refuge from the civil war among his countrymen. The Welsh annals tell us that he found the land he soiurht.
Having made preparations for a settlement, he returned to Wales, secured a large company that "filled ten ships,'' and then sailed away again, and "never returned." In
1GGO, Rev. Morgan Jones, a Welsh clergyman, seeking to go by land from South Carolina to Roanoke, was captured by the Tuscarora Indians. He declares that his life was spared because he spoke Welsh, which some of the Indians understood; that he was able to converse with them in Welsh, though with some difficulty ; and that he remained with them four months, sometimes preaching to them in
Welsh. John Williams, LL.D., who reproduced the state
ment of Mr. Jones in his work on the story of Prince Ma
dog's emigration, published in 1791, explained it by assuming that Prince Madog settled in North Carolina, and that
the Welsh colony, after being weakened, was incorporated



Ancient America still undiscovered. 403
with these Indians. If we may believe the story of Mr.
Jones (and I cannot find that his veracity was questioned
at the time), it will seem necessary to accept this explanation. It will be recollected that, in the early colony times, the Tuscaroras were sometimes called "White Indians." The Northmen had settlements in New England long before Prince Madog's colony went to America. But I must leave this topic, which requires a volume instead of a few pages. The Abbe de Bourbourg thinks
ancient America " is still to be discovered." Perhaps he
will advance the discovery by finding means to interpret the inscriptions at Palenque. Certainly there is nothing unreasonable or improbable in the supposition that the countries on the Western Mediterranean, associated in the myths with Atlas and the Atlantides, communicated with
America in very remote antiquity; nor is it improbable that there was communication across the Pacific. The objec
tions raised against it come chiefly from the gratuitous as
sumption that such enterprise was impossible in ancient times, and from the influence of thought and imagination
preoccupied, perhaps unconsciously, by an invincible determination to deny it.
