The monograph deciphers two V ̥rṣṇi coins of 1st cent.BCE, with inscriptions in 3 scripts:
Indus script, Kharoṣṭhī, Brāhmī, dul ayo karba, kol, meḍ, goṭā, vajra, āra kammaṭa 'mint for metal casting, alloys, meḍ 'iron' smelter, gold braid, weapons, brass' (वृ)ष्णी राजञ गणस्य त्रतरस्य . The name of the issuer of the coin: mint of V ̥rṣṇi kula पण्य , paṇya traders' guild is written in syllabic scripts of Kharoṣṭhī, Brāhmī, while the nature of the metalwork done in the mint is decribed in Indus Script hypertexts, metalwork catalogues.

An identical ancient silver coin (perhaps produced from the same ancient mint) of Vrishni janapada ca. 10 CE with kharoṣṭhī, Brahmi inscriptions and Harappa Script hieroglyphs was sold in an auction in Ahmedabad (August 2016) for Rs. 27 lakhs.

Hiranyaksha had a younger brother named Hiranyakashipu, who tried to persecute and abuse his son Prahlada for being a faithful devotee of Lord Vishnu. While Hiranyaksha was slain by Varāha (the boar avatar of Lord Vishnu), his younger brother Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha, the man-lion avatar of Lord Vishnu. It is significant that both Asuras are described as with the prefix hiranya, to signify them as 'gold' workers. Thus, Varāha and Narasimha are related to the evolving gold-standard for barter transactions related to wealth resources.

Lakshmi, divinity of fortune venerated on Azileses' coin and Sanchi, Bharhut stupas
Wilfried Pieper, (2014) “Earliest Garuḍa and Vaiṣṇava deities on ancient Indian coins”, Numismatic Digest, 38, pp. 36-59. Bhāgavata tradition was prevalent in these regions ca. 3rd century BCE. Bhagavata (a vrddhi formation from Bhagavanta, meaning "devotee of Bhagavanta", the Lord, i.e. God), is a devotee, worshipper or follower of Bhagavanta namely God in his personal aspect. The form of worship is called bhakti which has the meaning of 'adoration'. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhagavata

Main inscription of the Heliodorus pillar, circa 110 BCE.
On Heliodoros pillar inscription, the Greek declares himself to be a Bhāgavata, 'devotee of

the Supreme Divine'. The pillar was dedicated to Vāsudeva, devadeva byu Heliodoros son of Dion, ambassador of the Great king Antialkidas (Amtalikita) to the local king Bhāgabhadra, the Saviour (trātāra). The text of the inscriptions is in the Brahmi script of the Sunga period, the language is Central-western epigraphic Prakrit, with a few Sanskritized spellings. The first inscription describes the private religious dedication of Heliodorus (Translations: Richard Salomon):
Line 1. This Garuda-standard of Vāsudeva, the god of gods Line 2. was constructed here by Heliodora (Heliodoros), the Bhagavata, Line 3. son of Dion, a man of Takhkhasila (Taxila), Line 4. the Greek ambassador who came from the Great King Line 5. Amtalikita (Antialkidas) to King Line 6. Kasiputra Bhagabhadra, the Savior, Line 7. prospering in (his) fourteenth regnal year.
The second inscription on the pillar, in the same script, recites a verse from the Hindu epic Mahabharata:
Line 1. (These?) three steps to immortality, when correctly followed, Line 2. lead to heaven: control, generosity, and attention.

Nagari, where Ghosundi inscription was found
Hathibada Ghosundi Inscriptions, sometimes referred simply as the Ghosundi
Inscription or the Hathibada Inscription, are among the oldest known Sanskrit inscriptions in the Brahmi script, and dated to the 2nd-1st-century BCE. The Hathibada inscription were found near Nagari village, about 8 miles (13 km) north of Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, India, while the Ghosundi inscription was found in the village of Ghosundi, about 3 miles (4.8 km) southwest of Chittorgarh. They are linked to Vaishnavism tradition of Hinduism.

Their earliest worship is attestable in the clan of the Vrishnis near Mathura by 4th-century BCE. Legends are associated with these deified heroes, some of which may be based on real, historical heroes of the V ̥rṣṇi clan.

In Vaishnavsm, Aniruddha is associated with the boar, which is his theriomorphic aspect, also known as Varaha. Aniruddha appears as a boar in some of the Caturvyūha statues, where he is an assistant to Vāsudeva, and in the Vaikuntha Chaturmurti when his boar's head protrudes from the side of Vishnu's head. https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Aniruddha

"When negotiations between Pandavas and Kauravas break down with Krishna as the Pandava messenger, Krishna declares that he is more than human and displays his cosmic form to the Kaurava leader Duryodhana and his assembly. Vishvarupa-Krishna appears with many arms and holds many weapons and attributes traditionally associated with Vishnu like the conch, the Sudarshana chakra, the gada (mace), his bow, his sword Nandaka. The inside of his body is described. Various deities (including Vasus, Rudras, Adityas, Dikapalas), sages and tribes (especially those opposing the Kauravas, including the Pandavas) are seen in his body."https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Vishvarupa

Vishvarupa Vishnu, Kingdom of Kashmir, Jammu & Kashmir, 6th century CE
Head of Vaitunkta Vishnuca. 6th century Northern Pakistan (Brahmanical post-Gupta) Head of Vaikuntha Vishnu, seemingly dates later, but in reality may be close in date to the Head of Shiva. It is arguably one of the earliest renderings of a new Vishnu iconographic type, the three-headed Vaikuntha Vishnu in which the anthropomorphic Vishnu has the faces of the boar (Varaha) and lion (Narasimha) manifestations (avatars) emanating left and right. Here the boar is intact, the lion largely missing, but both emerge from the shoulders, not from the side of Vishnu’s head as seen in later Kashmir’s classic versions. This feature, seen also in the earliest dated version of this subject known—a late 5th century bronze from northern Pakistan—and a 6th century version now in the Museum of Indian Art, Berlin, points to our stone version dating from this first known phase of the iconographic-type’s appearance. A second feature allows us to post-date the work to a specific historic event, the Sasanian invasion of northern Pakistan in the early 7th century. The legacy of this contact is witnessed in the crown worn by Vishnu. No longer is it the Gupta-type, with a tripartite crown often with lion and pearls décor, but rather a mesh-patterned crown with diadem and ribbons as seen in crowned Sasanian ruler portraits, combined with a distinctive crest inherited from Gandharan art. Yet, a comparison of the physiognomy and others features of the Vishnu

face—the moustache, presence of identical ear-clips—all point to these works being broadly contemporary.

Vishnu and his avatars (Vaikuntha Chaturmurti): Vishnu himself or Vāsudeva-Krishna in human form, Narasimha as a lion, Varaha as a boar. Art of Mathura, mid-5th century CE. Boston Museum Saṃkarṣaṇa (Saṃkarṣaṇa, "The Plougher") later known as Balarama, was a son of Vasudeva Anakadundubhi, king of the Vrishnis in the region of Mathura. He was a leading member of the Vrishni heroes, and may well have been an ancient historical ruler in the region of Mathura. The cult of Saṃkarṣaṇa with that of Vāsudeva is historically one of the earliest forms of personal deity worship in India, attested from around the 4th century BCE.
The cult of Vāsudeva and Saṃkarṣaṇa was one of the major independent cults, together with the cults of Narayana, Shri and Lakshmi, which later coalesced to form Vishnuism.According to the Vaishnavite doctrine of the avatars, Vishnu takes various forms to rescue the world, and Vāsudeva as well as Saṃkarṣaṇa became understood as some of these forms, and some of the most popular ones.This process lasted from the 4th century BCE when Vāsudeva and Saṃkarṣaṇa were independent deities, to the 4th century CE, when Vishnu became much



23
more prominent as the central deity of an integrated Vaishnavite cult, with Vāsudeva and Saṃkarṣaṇa now only some of his manifestations.(Curta, Florin; Holt, Andrew (2016). Great Events in Religion: An Encyclopedia of Pivotal Events in Religious History [3 volumes]. ABC-CLIO. p. 271.) In epic and Puranic lore Saṃkarṣaṇa was also known by the names of Rama, Baladeva, Balarama, Rauhineya or Halayudha, and is presented as the elder brother of Vāsudeva.
Initially, Saṃkarṣaṇa seems to hold precedence over his younger brother Vāsudeva, as he appears on the obverse on the coinage of king Agathocles of Bactria (circa 190-180 BCE), and usually first in the naming order as in the Ghosundi inscription. Later this order was reversed, and Vāsudeva became the most important deity of the two, (Austin, Christopher R. (2019). Pradyumna: Lover, Magician, and Scion of the Avatara. Oxford University Press. p. 22.)https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Saṃkarṣaṇa
