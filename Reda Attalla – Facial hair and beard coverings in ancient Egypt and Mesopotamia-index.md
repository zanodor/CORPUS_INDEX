[EN]Facial hair and beards were known in the ancient Near East in general, ancient Egypt and
Mesopotamia in particular. However, the process of covering facial hair and beard in both civilizations is
one of the topics that still need extensive study about the name, its appearance in scenes and texts, and
the reasons for rising and the motives for covering it in both civilizations. In this paper, the scholar has
adopted on a descriptive approach based on a critical analysis of the various shapes. She also relied on
the analytical descriptive approach of presenting the facial hair and beard coverings in different contexts.
Finally, the study touched on the most important results, such as the beard and its covering were known
by many names and linguistic connotations in the Egyptian, Sumerian, and Akkadian languages. The
shape of beard in Egypt, and Mesopotamia were developed through the ages. Through the shape of the
beard, it is possible to distinguish between the Egyptian, Iraqi, Libyan, or Syrian race, the ancient
Egyptian distinguished between a king and an individual through the shape of the beard. The ancient
Iraqi also distinguished between the Assyrian writer and the Aramaic writer in terms of rising or shaving
it, the motives for growing a beard varied between being a measure of: masculinity and maturity,
judgment and authority, parenthood and old age, power and prestige, and religiosity. The motives of
covering the beard varied between fixing the beard and mustache, preventing them from being exposed
to dirt and dust, concealment and incognito, feeling warm, expressing mourning and sadness, as a
measure of holiness and purity. The types of beard coverings varied between the covering for a quarter of
the face, for a third of the face, for half of the face, and for the entire.

I. INTRODUCTION
Since pre-dynastic times, facial hair and beards1were known in the ancient Near
East, especially in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, although historical sources have not
defined an explicit time limit for growing beards in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia,
especially at that early age during the Pre-dynastic era. Small numbers of ivory statues
discovered lately in the city of «Nekhen»2 and «Naqada II»3 in Egypt, and the city of
«Ur»4and «Eridu»5 in Mesopotamia, are mostly portrayed as gods or people with loose
clothes, beards, and sometimes with a helmet like a hooded head, which Dellaporte
considers symbols of ancient heroes6.
While the great majority of the ancient world’s people were growing their beards,
some men used to shave their beards under the pretext of personal cleanliness and to
avoid dirt and insects7, and others covered them with covers or Lytham (veils) for either
purity, ritual or religious purposes, a community tradition of manliness, or to express
sadness in some Ancient near East peoples such as the Jews8.
Some previous studies have dealt with the beard, such as Burch’s9 study, in which
he dealt with the beard as one of the vocabularies of the Bible, Dunn’s10 study, which
talks about wigs in general, and the fake beard in particular, Hardy's11 article, which
talks about a short study of the history of the beard and its forms, as well as the study of
Naomi and Demond12, which talks about the fake beard of the Pharaoh, and finally the
study of Mahrān 13, which talks about the chin and beard, its types, and shapes.
1 The beard «lihya» in the dictionaries of the Arabic language is the hair growing on the face of an adult man, and may refer to the mustache and beard is a name that collects from the hair that grows on the cheeks and chin. The beard is on which the hair grew, and the plural of the beard «luha», «liha». To Burch, it represents: «All hair that grows around the chin area, including or without the mustache». BURCH 2000: 15; IBNMAKRAM 2003: 185. 2 The city of Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) is in the south of Luxor about 140 km, between the cities of Esna and Edfu. HOFFMAN 1982: 1; HOFFMAN 1986: 175–187. 3 Naqada II is the center of the Qena governorate. It is located on the western shore of the Nile, and it overlooks the Nile River. Naqada is 31 km south of Qena and 25 km north of Luxor. HISHMAT 2016. 4 Ur is the archaeological site of a Sumerian city located in Tal al-Muqeer, southern Iraq. It was the capital of the Sumerian state in 2100 BC. It was an oval city located on the mouth of the Euphrates River in the Persian Gulf near Eridu. LIOYD 1993: 4. 5 Eridu, now known as Tal Abu Shahir, is an ancient Iraqi city located 7 miles southwest of Ur. Archaeologists believe Eridu was one of the Sumerian's oldest towns, dating back 5000 years BC. CAMPBELL 1920: 44–101. 6 DELAPORT 1997: 196; BIGOT 1913: PL.

As for the current study, it deals with the name of the beard and its cover in the
Egyptian, Sumerian and Akkadian languages, and the mention of the beard in the
archaeological and textual evidence in both ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, as well as
the material and moral motives for growing the beard and covering it. It also deals with
types of beard covering and their various forms.
The hair of the head and beard were one of the most important features of ancient
Egyptian art, for the ancient Egyptians showed a great interest in their hair of the head
and beard, and how to care for it14.It is shown through paintings as well as sculptures
that the Egyptians meant to cut and trim their hair, and also used wigs and fake beards
to garnish during celebrations and holidays15.
Cutting hair and shaving beards are old as the Egyptian civilization itself, and this
expression appeared in the pyramid texts in the Old Kingdom, and some scenes of hair
cutting from the Middle Kingdom, and the tools used to cut hair and shave beards also
appeared in the pyramid texts of the Old kingdom16.
Nevertheless, the habit of cutting hair and beards was not dominant feature in the
ancient Near East countries in general, and in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia in
particular, the keeping and growing of beards was one of the ancient customs known to
those civilizations, in addition to most of the ancient East Asia peoples17, many finest
works add beards of a particular and authentic nature to the features of their
characters18.
The facial hair and beards in the ancient Near East in general, and ancient Egypt
and Mesopotamia in particular, have been known since the pre-dynastic times;
although historical sources have not specified an explicit time limit for growing beards
in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia at that early age during the Pre-dynastic era. Small
numbers of statues made of clay, ivory, or wood, were discovered late in the city of
Nekhen (Hierakonpolis) and «Ur», where some scholars believe that they may have
represented the god of fertility: Min19 in ancient Egypt or Anki in Mesopotamia, and
among those statues is a stone statue dating back to the era of the Naqada II civilization
(i.e. around 3500 BC) 20[FIGURES 1–2]

From the early archaic period [FIGURE 3]21 male kings and sometimes even queens
were portrayed in many statues and paintings in men’s shape with false divine
beards22.They grew their beards as a sign of the king’s greatness and power.
Furthermore, for the kings of the age of establishment, growing beards was the
dominant feature of the royal personality of the time23.

Moreover, growing beards is a distinctive feature of differences between peoples
and races, especially between the ancient Egyptian people and other peoples of the
ancient Near East, or ancient Asians 24 [FIGURE6]
21 There are many archaeological studies proving this such as: on the top of his limestone scepter, the king Scorpion has both a beard and a chin as well [FIGURE4], and on the stela of Nacr-mer, the king and his follower the «Vizier» or the royal sandal bearer, have beards and chins [FIGURE5]. 22 COTTRELL 1955: 21. 23 REDFORD 2002: 36. 24 COTTRELL 1955: 33; For example, one of the «Aamu» people who are painted on the walls of the tomb of the Khnumhotep II at Beni-Hasan appears in distinctive clothes, and he painted his skin with a light color very different from the skin color of those around him. He had his hair long until he reached behind his neck. There is a short beard on his cheek and chin like that of Aamu people. KAMRIN 2009: 26, FIG.4.

Although Hornblower believes that the statues and scenes depicted with beard
covers refer to the human race, they may be not Egyptian but Sumerian25. This is
confirmed by Baumgartl that the difference in the representation of the beard on these
small statues only indicates the difference in the human race also 26[FIGURE8]. While
others argue that these statues refer to the emergence of certain deities that appeared
during this early period. Then it appeared clearly in the subsequent periods.
The habit of growing beards was generally common in the old world’s art27 and
especially in Mesopotamia; nonetheless, many paintings show the Assyrians having
strange and unfamiliar beards that did not appear very much in the Assyrians art28.
During the Old Kingdom, many statues of kings [FIGURE9] and individuals
showed facial hair and beards29, and in the First Intermediate Period, beards appeared
widely on the masks of mummies30, then in the Middle Kingdom31, the habit of keeping
beards was known in rare cases such as mourning or on an exploratory trip32.
25 HALL 1985: 73. 26 VANDIER 1952: 421. 27 It is apparent too that caring about chins and growing beards was a habit of Punt land peoples since old ages; the ruler of Punt land appears on one of the wall paintings of the Temple of Deir al-Bahari with a hanging beard with a sharp end, it is the same form that the delegations of Punt land had appeared since the reign of king Khufu of the fourth dynasty, almost a thousand years ago. COTTRELL 1955: 171. This asserts that growing beards was one of Punt land’s peoples’ features. Moreover, Syrian people were recorded in many ancient Egyptian paintings with several types of chins and beards. 28 In one of the scenes, a group of Assyrians appear with their known Semitic features and have been portrayed in a profile position, while iris-eye has a sectorial line that first appeared in works of art dating back to the reign of King Sargon (about 72 –705 BC).

BM226 - some individuals are sitting on a chair without a backrest, while the chin and prominent jaw area were decorated with the hanging beard [FIGURE 10].

In the New Kingdom, Egyptian kings used to grow their beards or put on artificial
false ones33 to shape gods. The queen Hatshepsut (Ca. 1500 BC.), for instance, put on a
beard as a symbol of manliness34,cruelness, and force35[FIGURE11]. Growing beards,
perhaps, was one of the matters that affected many of the following civilizations in
Egypt, especially during the Greek and Roman ages36.It was the same in Mesopotamian,
where the king NebuchadnezzarBaal (Ca. 884-860 BC.) was portrayed in one of the wall
paintings in his palace in Nimrud37, with a very normal beard combed in lines with
braided curls38.

[FIGURE11]. Head of a statue of Queen Hatshepsut with the royal beard of men. EGYPTIAN MUSEUM GUIDE 1999: 65.
The beard is portrayed as well on a wall sculpture39from the reign of the Assyrian
king Sargon (Ca. 721-705 BC), on the chins of two writers recording the numbers of
prisoners and spoils. A striking thing about this inscription is that the writer who writes
on the parchment is bearded, while the writer who writes on the clay tablet appears to
have shaved facial hair and mustache. This does not necessarily mean that the bearded

It was founded in the thirteenth century BC. In the ninth century BC, it became the capital of the modern Assyrian empire during the reign of king Ashur Nasir pal II and was destroyed in the year 612 BC by the Chaldeans and the Medes, 2020. 38 TARBELL 2002. 39 This sculpture may have is likely to date 715 BC.

writer, who appears in the Assyrian paintings, is an Assyrian writer; nor is the one who
has a shaved beard and a mustache Aramaic40.
Growing beards by some characters in ancient Egypt as it appears in religion and
art remains a mystery that needs further clarification and explanation. In ancient Egypt
shaving41the beards and cutting the facial hair were signs of respect and reverence, as
was the case in Mesopotamia42.Nevertheless, growing beards was one of the matters
that connected a person to the ranks of the great gods, whose beards were made of lapis
lazuli and were depicted, braided, raising the king to be like a god on earth43.
[FIGURE 12]. Barbers in the Egyptian market.
YWSĪF 2012: FIG.32.
While the great majority of the peoples of the ancient Near East were keeping their
beards, some men used to shave the maunder the pretext of personal cleanliness,
priesthood, or ritual scruples44.Furthermore, some others used to cover their beards
with covers, Lytham (veils), or a piece of cloth for either purity, ritual, or religious
purposes, a community tradition of manliness, or to express sadness in peoples of the
ancient Near East, such as the Jews45.
II. THE BEARD AND ITS COVERS IN EGYPTIAN, SUMERIAN AND AKKADIAN LANGUAGES
The facial hair and beards were known in the dictionaries of the ancient Egyptian
language by many words, including: ( ) «xbswt»46, ( ) «ina»47, ( )
40 SAAI 1997: 16; RUSSELL 1998: 137; AL JUMAILY 2005: 201. 41 The ancient Egyptian Barber used razors, often made of copper or bronze, and had wooden, metal, or gold handles. They used stones for sharpening them. They also used combs in hairdressing, similar to those that had been used until recently, including wide combs with double edges, and some with fine teeth for cleaning, and the combs were used for decorating their hair too [FIGURE 12]. YOUSSEF 2013: 270-271, FIG.100. 42 The registrars of war spoil’ records during the campaigns of king Taglat Blazer ІІІ (745-727 BC) appear a haircut, of Aramaic origins.

difference between a natural beard and a false beard from its determinative. The natural
beard has a natural beard determinative: ( ), while the false beard has a fiber beard

The covers were referred to by many words such as: ( ) «ndb» meaning:
«to cover»52, ( ) «Hbs» meaning: «to cover or hide using clothes or Fabrics»53,
( ) «Hbsw»: meaning: «to cover with clothes»54, ( ) «Hbs-Hr» which give
the meaning: «to cover or hide the face»55, ( ) «Hbs» meaning: «to cover with the
clothes»56, and ( ) «smA» meaning: «the hair cover that covers part of the head,
the scalp, or the side»57.
Still, other words have the meaning of: «enclosing or surrounding something to
cover and hide it« such as: ( ), ( ), ( ) «Sni»58, and: ( ) «kAp» meaning:
«to cover himself to hide like Lytham (veil)» 59.

In the Sumerian language, the word: ( ), ( ), ( ),
( )60«NUNDUN- LÀ»61 means: «Beard62; While the word: «beard» is mentioned in
Akkadian Language: (Zaqnu) «Zaqǡnu»63.
The word: «SA» meaning: «strand» or «cue»; While the words:«šētu» and «riksu»,
always come in the form of an adjective for the syntactic, which is either «hair» or
«ropes» or «nets».64 As for the covering or the process of covering with clothes or
fabrics, it was mentioned in Sumerian as: «liwitum» meaning: «cover», or «wrap», and
«iliwtim» meaning: «covering», «wrapping»65.
III. THE BEARD AND ITS COVERS IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL AND TEXTUAL EVIDENCE
Bearded statues have been known in ancient Egypt since the era of «Naqada I»
and the beginning of Naqada II, and they are mostly, according to Hornblower opinion,
representing carved pieces imported from the countries bordering Egypt66 in general
and Mesopotamia in particular67.
This was evidenced by the presence of the head of a god made of burnt-colored
clay with an oval shape, and he had been found broken in the Marmadat Bani Salama
area68. The chin of this head was decorated with a group of holes in which ribbons or
ropes were attached (a metaphor for the beard), which was only hung during the
celebrations69.
Petrie mentioned that those statues, which depict men with shaved heads while
they were provided with beards, are of people who came before the Egyptians70. He
found a similar statue in the «Naqada» area depicting a statue of a man with holes in
his chin hanging from, which four black bands may be a metaphor for the beard if the
statue is of a man71, or with holes in the chin area only [FIGURE13].

The beard was, in some cases, depicted with its lower part widening slightly from
the top, as is the case in the statues of the king Menkaure, a model that was prevalent in
the official depiction of kings in the Old Kingdom 72[FIGURE14].They instead, wear flat
and synthetic beards that are attached to ropes around the ears or head. Soon, it
developed into the form of the Osird Beard73, in the form of a braided plait of several
strands, while its end was bent slightly forward, resembling Wsir, the god of the dead74,
which linked the wearer to the ranks of the gods75,while individuals wear a short beard
of one lock76.

In Mesopotamia, male statues were naked, with a snake-like face, a conical-shaped
crown, and long beards77, and male statues made of mud-colored with a light beard
were also discovered in the city of «Ur» and «Eridu»78. Later on, the Sumerians were
distinguished by shaving their beards; while the Babylonians kept their beards long and
cropped in square shapes79, in the Assyrian era, the hair and beard were wavy, curled
and braided80.The men of the ancient Greek81 and Mesopotamia civilizations wore

beards, and treated them with incredible respect and care, using wax, oils, and
moisturizers that helped them maintain the appearance of their beard in their best
condition at all times82.
It is clear from one of the frescoes of the Assyrian king Tjellat Blazer III83 (Ca. 745
727 BC) in Tell Parsib84, by two writers, where the first with a beard, an Assyrian writer,
is depicted; the second is portrayed as a shaven-bearded, an Aramaic writer85.Perhaps
these two writers represent the two styles of writing (cuneiform and Aramaic) during
the modern Assyrian era (Ca. 911-612 BC)86.
Bearded scribes may appear regularly during the reign of Tjellat Blazer III and
beyond87. Researchers disagree regarding these two writers, as Reade believes that the
shaved writer is an Aramaic writer who writes in Aramaic88; while, Mazloum argues
that the clean-shaven writer was not an Aramaic writer, but an Assyrian painter.89
Often, this beard was provided with an accurate representation of the beard's hair,
or a brief representation of the lines and grooves of the sides of the chin[Figure 16],with
grooves and ornaments covering the entire chin[FIGURE17], or it might be provided
with holes indicating the beard hair90[FIGURE18].

Since most of these beards in both Egypt and Mesopotamia civilizations were not
provided with grooves or ornaments, this confirms that most of these statues, if not all,
were provided with beard covers, and that most of these beard covers were depicted on
primitive statues carved from ivory91 or alabaster92 in particular [FIGURES22-23], which
according to the material of manufacture and the technique of manufacture go back to
pre-dynastic times93.

If we consider the exaggerated shape of the beard, the lack of details, notches, or
braids expressing the strands of the beard's hair, and its elongation outside the bounds
of the chin area, we may conclude that it does not reflect a natural beard.
Rather, they represent the covers containing the beard as if they were like a veil
[FIGURES24-25], where the features of the face and eyes appear naturally; While the
features of the mouth or nose sometimes disappear completely under the hood or the
veil, or appear in the form of simple lines under the veil at other times.

Beard hoods are unusual for the inscriptions and statues of men who are depicted
with a beard, as these hoods appeared in their most straight forward states of
elongation parallel to the size, shape, and length of the chin94, especially in most statues
and decorative combs [FIGURE26] during pre-dynastic ages in both civilization, which
were mostly made of small ivory pieces. The masculine bodies are characterized by an
exaggerated elongation of the chin, which some described as: «a long pointed
beard»95.The writer believes it represents a beard or veil.
[FIGURE 26]. A comb in the form of a bearded man.Brooklyn Museum
Perhaps most of the beard covers took the shape of a triangular tapered end with
straight sides. The chin covering was a clear example of those statues with a very long
tapered triangular beard, which might reach close to the chest96, waist area, or
sometimes even to the navel area [FIGURES27/a-b], which is distinguished by being
convex hoods, so that the entire beard is wrapped and covered with it97.

The habit of covering the lower part of the face with a cover in general, or covering
the chin and beards with a hood in particular, has been a known habit since the late
«Naqada I» era (stages 50-60). When small pendants were found, made of seashells

It is worth noting that it was possible to find one of these pendants fixed in its
place on the skull of one of the dead, which certainly proves how they were decided
and the purpose of their use. Perhaps the reason for not finding many examples of these
pendants is that the most of them were probably made of perishable and mortal
materials, which explains their rarity in tombs and on mummies. Otherwise, we would
have found many and sufficient numbers to study99.
IV. MOTIVES FOR THE BEARD’S RAISING AND COVERING
The beard and its covering are very important matters in the ancient Egyptian and
Mesopotamia civilizations, because they give us an impression of the social status of a
person, whether he is a king or a regular person, Egyptian, Iraqi, or foreigner, god or
human. And since the habit of covering the beard is one of the few things to depict and
model, despite its primitive origin. So the reasons that prompted some ancient
Egyptians and Iraqis release their beards on the one hand, and the motives for covering
them, on the other, are varied. The following is an enumeration of the most important
of these reasons and motives.
1. Motives for raising/ growing a beard
A.A measure of masculinity and maturity
Although the ancient Egyptians had an original beard that was growing normally,
they preferred the false beards out of great concern for hygiene, as they considered long
beards, mustaches, and thick eyebrows to be signs of lack of hygiene100, so the ancient
Egyptians were careful not to remove only facial hair, but also the full-bodied hair101.
98 CATALLAH 2005: 171. 99 CAPART 1905: 104, FIG.21, CATALLAH 1995: 40ff. 100 HARRIS 2012. 101 STEELE 2009: 13.

DOI:10.21608/jguaa2.2021.83442.1069. 122 JGUAA2 vol.7/1, 2022: 018-110
The beard in ancient Egypt was indicative of the level of strength, manliness, and
fertility. Raising the beard usually gave an impression of the characteristics of those
with experience and wisdom in the tribal community due to their old age, which is the
same reason that prompted the ancient Egyptians and Iraqis to release their beards102.
The concern of the king of Assyria, «the father», with his son, the ruler of the city
of «Mary», is expressed in one of the cuneiform writings, which were contained in one
of the letters through the «royal delegates103»:«You are still a child and you are not a
man. Has the beard not grown on your chin yet? Have you not yet succeeded in
achieving maturity, and have you not established a house for yourself yet?»104.
B.A Measure of Beauty
In one of the poems about the spinning between the goddess «Inana» and the god
Damouzi, we read about the beauty of the beard of Damouzi, which Inana likened to lapis
lazuli: «How charming is his lapis lazuli beard, that shepherd that Anne created for
me»105.
C.A Measure of the Legendary Hero
Where a statue106 of a bearded, prolific man, animalistic, wicked-smiling, red
skinned, was found, his face was marked by a slanting tangle that was deliberately
executed, starting from the top of the nose, passing through the right cheek, and ending
at the root of the abundant curly beard around the sides of his face. It probably
represents a statue of a mythical warrior hero whose face was left behind by wars and
battles 107[FIGURE30].

D.A Measure of Judgment and Authority
In ancient Egyptian art of all kinds, we usually find the ancient Egyptians who
were viziers and officials
108
with shaved beards, and they were what prompted them to
use «false beards»
109
; to follow the example of the ruling class, where the beard
was,according to Emery's
110
point of view, a symbol of rule and authority, which was
evident in their statues, inscriptions and colorful drawings as a feature of kings and
pharaohs, who can be easily distinguished through them
111
. This was also evident from
their texts:
Ina n P pn m xnt.t-Xrtxm
«This beard of King P is among the elite stars of xm (Letopolis)
112
».
It is worth noting that the king
113
, even after his death, used to wear the royal
beard, which Maspero believes that they and the nails are fixed to the royal mummies
due to their importance, after treating them chemically
114
. Whether the beard was
natural or artificial, its mission was not only to play the role of the beard. It refers to its
author with high social positions, an example of kings
115
[FIGURE 31].
This may differ from the situation in ancient Mesopotamia, as the beard was not
one of the most important symbols and insignia of the royalty
116
, as a statue was found
inside a vessel of the master of the city of Warka[FIGURE32],which showing him with a
hood that is pulled to the forehead and neck together with a padded tie, and was
provided with an unnatural beard of abundant in hair, fluted horizontally, as one of the
artistic features of that era, which made a kind of heavenly holiness conferred on the
statue
117
. This made the beard appear to be covered in a grooved cover.

E.A Measure of Parenthood and Old Age
For the ancient kings of Mesopotamia, the beard was a symbol of fatherhood and
old age. It was not used for priestly purposes, as was the case in ancient Egypt. While
the beard of the Assyrians in Mesopotamia, as well as the Persians, symbolized
wisdom, similar to that in ancient Egypt, in which the beard was an important sign of
authority118.
F.A Measure of Power and Prestige
Ancient Egyptian history highlights the extent of the Egyptians’ interest in having
their heads and beards trimmed119. While many texts refer to the importance of raising
a beard and growing it during different periods as an expression of power and prestige,
in the story of «the drowned sailor», which dates back to the Middle Kingdom, we see
how a huge snake with a beard more than two arms long greeted the sailor upon his
arrival on this remote island:
120

«I found that what was coming to me was a huge snake whose length was 30 cubits,
and it had a beard that was longer than the two arms121»; Which indicates the role of
the beard in maximizing a person’s strength and prestige, so that the good deceased
speaks to his soul as an analogy to «Wsir» to reach the end of his beard in a sense of
power and prestige[FIGURE33].
«May you reach even the hairs of my beard, let you reach me
even my feet122».

One of the favorite subjects in Akkadian engraving art is also the depiction of the
king surrounded by symbols of divinity, such as the sun and moon123 as an image of a
mighty hero with a curly beard and strands124 as a symbol of strength and prestige125.
Rather, pulling a person’s hair126 or beard 127was a sign of humiliation128.

G.A Measure of Immortality and Survival
The Egyptian pharaohs always imitated the god of the dead in the other world,
Wsir even in his beard, after their departure from this world and transfer to the other.
Especially since the kings of Egypt wore a false beard after their death, and they were
also depicted on the roofs of the coffins wearing the beard, especially the slender divine
beard that ends with a folded edge towards the front129, while the ancient Iraqi did not
link between the beard, on the one hand, and his later life, the rites of death or burial,
on the other hand.
Chapter 170 of the Book of the Dead refers to the role of the beards as one of the
secrets of the king’s survival, not only on the throne of worldly life. Rather, but on the

H.A Measure of Religiosity
Although wearing beards was not the primary criterion of masculinity in ancient
Egypt. But it linked its breeder to the ranks of the great gods as well. Hence, the
Pharaohs wore beards for this purpose. The prevailing style of the beard was by
braiding a group of strands in the form of a thin and narrow braid, a pattern that
connected them to the ranks of the gods. Perhaps goat hair-according to Freedman
was the main component of this type of beard, which is usually wide at the top and
slender at the bottom. The great Pharaohs put on a false beard during the celebration to
express its importance on one hand, and to emphasize their divine lineage on the other
hand132.
Ancient Egyptian art also depicts, indeed, the arts of neighboring countries in
general and Mesopotamia in particular, how their deities similar to the features and
characteristics of the Egyptian gods, and their religions were provided with beards of
many shapes133.
Raising the sacred natural beard is one of the things that lost its popularity early in
the history of ancient Egyptian civilization, and perhaps the reason behind this is due to
its replacement by the divine beard of the gods and the fake human beard of the king,
which also goes back to the ancient Egyptian civilization’s concerns about cleanliness
and purity. There were certain types of legal restrictions on all groups of people, which
made the poor wear beards continuously and regularly134.
Beards are very interestingly depicted in ancient Egyptian art, which indicates that
the natural life of the individual outside the fanatical religious system has imposed the
presence of beards for many members of the people of the ancient Near East, and the
artists of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia have expressed their opinion about raising
their neighborhood enemies to their beards with its various types and forms [FIGURE
35], which may explain the reason for the popularity of raising the beards of most kings

and individuals of the ancient Near East countries when they travel outside the
country135.
Even most of the Egyptian and Mesopotamia gods had a beard indicating holiness
and purity, including the god Ra with a divine beard136, and the god Bes137, who is
depicted in the form of a funny dwarf138, whose face has curly hairs139 with two long
strips of hair in cheeks and a curly beard140[FIGURE 36], the god Khnum who is depicted
in the form of a raised ram with two horns extending upwards, and his chin adorned
with a beard indicating his sacred nature141[FIGURE 37], and the god Ptah who appears
mostly in the form of youth142, his chin adorned with a long straight beard143.

In Mesopotamia, many gods also knew the importance of having a beard, such as
a god Baal who wore a triangular Asian beard 144[FIGURE 38], the god Shamash who was
depicted in a human form with a long beard145,as well as the god Inana who depicted in
a form of a bull With large horns and a blue lazuli beard, and was worshiped in «Ur»146.

a long beard, a hat with horns, and a long robe with folds148.

The god Sin is also depicted as an old man with a drooping beard and a crown
with four horns topped with a crescent149. The same applies to some other sacred
symbols such as the Mashkhoshu dragon, whose statues came from China150.
I.A Measure of Fertility and Virility
Keita believes that some Egyptian and Iraqi fertility deities, such as «Min» in
ancient Egypt and «Anki» in Mesopotamia, are among those bearded statues, which
were found in both civilizations and dating back to pre-dynastic times151. Especially,
some of these statues represented the erect penis as a sign of fertility and virility.
[FIGURES39-40]

We can realize that raising beards for the people of Egypt and Mesopotamia is one
of the basic habits they have, which belong to a social motive of masculinity, fertility,
and virility, or a tribal motive of old age and wisdom, or a religious motive for the gods,
or a sacred payer of purity and honor, or other motives whose purpose is to
communicate with royalty authority or divine authority. It is one of the matters that
neither the rulers nor the people can disavow. If there is no beard for a person, then
wearing it as a borrowed may suffice the purpose.

1. Motives for Covering/ Wearing a Beard
A. To Protect from Dirt and Dust:
Growing hair and shaving beards were among the old habits that indicated the
extent to which a person would elevate his appearance and take care of it152. Beard
hoods were also used to confirm the beard to prevent it from flying off or becoming dirt
and dust. Covers of beards were known to hold beards during different historical
periods153.
B. To Concealment and Incognito
The usage of a hood or veil to cover the beard indicates the desire of its owner to
hide, conceal, and incognito; to camouflage the enemy, or hide the features of his face,
or the truth of his personality in front of the undesirable; to preserve life or ward off the
damage that may result from the recognition of his enemies.
C. To Feel Warm
Facial hair kept pre-dynastic men warm as well as protected their mouths and
noses from exposure to cold154. When was one of the answers of Senmut155 in response
to one of Qin Amun questions about the nature of the Syrian mountains and their
height? Senmut answered that it is: «The lands that God Horus decreed to be cold, and
he is the reason why their people wear these heavy clothes and release a beard to keep
their faces warm156».
D. To Express Sadness and Mourning
In the days of mourning and sadness, the ancient Egyptians used to release their
hair and beards, and this is one of the habits that are still followed today. In the story of
«Sinuhe»157, when the king allowed him to return to Egypt, he made sure to shave his
beard and cut his hair158. After many years of alienation159:

This is what some tried to compare to the habit of growing the beard at the time of
grief or covering it with that custom known to the Jewish163, where Jewish cover their
beards as a metaphor for grief and mourning at funerals and obsequies164, which
indicates growing a beard or covering it may indicate a state of sadness, melancholy or
mourning.
D.A Measure of Holiness and Purity
The presence of the beard refers to the sacred nature of the bearded person or
god165, as the presence of the beard is one of the things that may bestow a kind of
holiness to the owner of this beard and his statue166[FIGURE 41], Perhaps the purpose
behind covering the beard may be to ensure purity during various religious ceremonies,
following the custom of Egyptian priests who were required to shave their heads and
beards. Even the hair of the whole body before performing the various religious rituals
to avoid the dirt that may arise as a result of raising hair and beards or preventing the
emergence of hair insects167. This prompted some to grow light beards that do not
exceed two lines decorating the side frames of the chin area168.

Most of the bearded statues were in the form of artifacts of old men or gods as an
indication of their sanctity, and they were depicted wrapped in long coats covering the
entire body170. As for their beards, they were triangular shape with straight ribs and
angles, and these statues were pierced and hung as amulets to take advantage of its
sanctity. These holes were made at the bottom of the statue [FIGURE42], provided with a
ring on the top [FIGURE 43], or with two holes in the place of the chest [FIGURE44].

These statues were sometimes equipped with grooves to fix the hang ropes in the

V. TYPES OF BEARD’S COVERS
1. Quarter-Face’s Cover (Chin and Beard)
The beard covers varied between a beard covering for a quarter face, covering
only the chin and beard area; So that the cover is fixed behind the ear contains the
beard. [Compare withFIGURE49]. In some statues, the beard appeared to be covered
with long, transmitted lines interspersed with holes that represent the gaps between the
strands of the beard, according to Okasha's viewpoint173; in which I see a beard cover
with long decorations and textile gabs that match with the style of the decoration of the
garment worn by the statue [FIGURE50]

It is noted in the following statue [FIGURE51], in which all facial features are
shown includes the eyes, nose, mouth, and ears, as well as a large beard that may have
been covered. The tapered end of the elephant’s tibia features a long headdress, while
the lower part represents the statue’s body wrapped in a mantle without detail. The
presence of a hole in the upper part of the statue confirms that it was used as a pendant

that was hung around the neck, but the use and the true meaning of this statue are not
yet known174.
It also appears in the statue of king IkuShamajan175[FIGURE52]his beard is
decorated with square motifs intersecting and intertwining with each other. In reality,
this does not match with the nature of the beard and its locks which always appear in
the form of drop-down lines or spiral circles. This makes the idea of cladding or
covering it with a patterned cover is the most correct opinion.

2. Third-Face’s Cover (Chin, Beard, and Mouth)
It is a cover that hides a third of the lower face, contains only the chin, beard, and
mouth, so that only the nose and eyes appear from the face of the statue. This cover is
usually fixed behind the ear as well (Compare with FIGURE53), where the features of
the statue were unreal, such that the nose was huge and the lip was prominent

VI. CONCLUSION
Many previous studies dealt with beards and beards, such as the study of Amal
Mahrān: Beards and chins in Ancient Egypt, in which he dealt with the names, shapes,
and types of beards without being exposed to the coverings of beards, types, shapes, or
purpose.
The study of cAbdullah: Foreign Captives in Ancient Egypt, In which the General
Authority of Foreign Detainees dealt with the nature of hair, its length and the shape of
the beard, and its impact on the ethnic nature of the captive, without being exposed to
its cover or the purpose of its release and coverage. Moreover the study of Mustafa
Atallah: Uncommon forms of men and women on the antiquities of prehistoric and
early ages in Egypt, In which he dealt with the uncommon forms of men and women, in
which he briefly addressed in one phrase between the lines the shape of a beard of one
of the pre-dynastic statues, without discussing their forms, types, and purpose. This is
what the current study addressed.
The custom of raising the beard was known since pre-dynastic times in both
Ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, The bearded statues were found in many
archaeological sites in Egypt: Naqada I & II, Meramadat Banī Salama ..., and
Mesopotamia: «Ur, Eridu ...». The beard and its covering were known by many names
and linguistic connotations in the Egyptian, Sumerian and Akkadian languages. And
the ancient Egyptian distinguished between the natural and the prosthetic beard in
terms of its name and its determinative. While the ancient Iraqi also distinguished
between the name of the beard in his Sumerian and Akkadian languages.
The shape and type of beard in Egypt and Mesopotamia were developed through
ages, the shape and type of beard in Egypt were developed from the natural and small
beard to natural and triangular beard, the linear borrowed, and the divine Osiris
metaphor beard. While in Mesopotamia the shape and type of beard were developed
from the long to triangular naturalness, the grooved natural, the curly, and spiral
natural bread. The viewer can also distinguish between people and their races through
the beard. It is only through the shape of the beard that it is possible to distinguish
between the Egyptian, Iraqi, Libyan, or Syrian race.
The ancient Egyptian distinguished between a king and an individual through the
shape and appearance of the beard. The ancient Iraqi also distinguished between the
Assyrian writer and the Aramaic writer in terms of rising or shaving it.
The sources of bearded man statues, both archaeological and textual, are multiple
in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. While the lengths of the beard varied between the
short covering the chin area, the long one up to the chest area, and the very long even

the navel area. The sources of bearded male figures also varied between regular statues,
combs, and amulets. The materials for making bearded statues are varied including
stone, fiancée, ivory, and alabaster. The materials for making ornaments used fix the
covers are varied also between nacre and copper. The motives of growing a beard
varied between being a measure of masculinity and maturity, a measure of judgment
and authority, a measure of parenthood and old age, a measure of power and prestige,
and a measure of religiosity. The motives of covering the beard varied between fixing
the beard and mustache and prevent them from being exposed to dirt and dust, to
concealment and incognito, to feel warm, to express mourning and sadness, and as a
measure of holiness and purity. The beard is one of the most important divine symbols
that are indispensable to the Egyptian and Iraqi deities alike. The types of beard
coverings varied between the covering for a quarter of the face (chin, and beard), the
covering for a third of the face (beard, chin, and mouth), the covering for half of the face
(beard, chin, mouth, and nose), and the covering for the entire face (excluding the two
eyes openings).
