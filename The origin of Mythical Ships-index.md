The origin of Mythical Ships
THE MYTHICAL ORIGIN OF THE SHIP
When you are dealing with ancient stories, symbols, and ritual
structures, you have to interpret the story telling and the
archaeological findings mythological. Otherwise you will be left
guessing and your interpretations will be short of common and
explainable sense. But even so, you also have to connect the
symbols and the story telling to some modern plausible scientific
and recognizable facts.
Of course our ancestors have noticed that the stars are revolving.
That is, except from the point in the heaven where no movement
seems to take place. The seemingly rotating figure on the northern
hemisphere symbolizes the Greatest male deity in the Mythological
Story from all over the World. This figure symbolizes for instants
Chronos, Zeus, Odin, Saturn (not the planet) and several other
names.
But the figure are also symbolized with several other phenomenon's,
of which the Heavenly Ship and a White Horse, a Bull or a great
Serpent are the most common.



Looking at the many Rock Art carvings of the so called "Ship" you
will observe that the specific carvings of the shape of the Ships has
been very differently carved. Now, if you were to carve a shape into a
hard rock surface with just stone tools, you soon have to consider
how much effort you will use. The results afterwards depends on
how precise you observe the desired object and how precise you
carve it.
Different efforts and different observed object details of the artist,
gives different carving specifics. From just an effort to carve the Ship
as a single line, to carving a Ship with double lines and the so called
frame ribs, towards an effort where the artist have carved the whole
surface of the Ship.
Regarding Ships with frame ribs, scholars often relate these Rock Art
Ships directly to a much later Viking Ship and even to the modern
ship. Without any thoughts of the time period in which these
symbols was made. That is of course to putting the cart before the
horse. The idea comes naturally before the material shape!



THE MILKY WAY SHIP
From all over the World, the telling of a large Ship (and of a Great
Flood) is very common. But it is also a common fact that this telling
either have been totally forgotten or have been confused or reduced
to having other more "obvious" meanings, of which the Mythical Ship
is confused to be "a ship carrying the Sun trough the night" which is
a totally impossible thing to say! How on Earth can anyone living
human accept such an idiosyncratic idea?
Talking mythological about "great ships", for instants Hringhorne in
Norse Mythology and Noah Arch in the Bible, in connection with "a
Great Flood", one has to look for "the greatest object in the
mythological world, and no object is greater than the white Milky
Way Band encircling the Earth.
In order to understand the many mythological symbols and
mythological telling of the Milky Way, it is necessary to imagine the
figure going around a centre point i. e. the north and the south
celestial poles. It is also necessary to imagine that the figure
mythological changes meaning in different positions around this
centre.
Milky Way Symbolism
If symbolized as a male or female deity, the figure can be symbolized
"standing up"; flying in the heaven" "falling down in the Sea"; "going
under the Earth"; "from where the deity rise gain"; "reborn and
returning" - describing all the stories of the major "gods and
goddesses" - an remarkable likeness to the story of Jesus really isn't
it? But getting the right key, it's possible to explain the major deities
mentioned in cultures all over the World. They are all symbolized with
white colour and they are all "the greatest"; overseeing everything on
Earth; located in the Sky, etc. etc.

you will discover the point where the Stars seems to stand still. In
ancient times, our ancestors marked this point with a Wheel as
inserted above on the Star Atlas. (See North Pole Centre)

The Solar barge/Sun chariot confusion.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_barge
A "solar barge" (also "solar bark", "solar barque", "solar boat", "sun
boat") is a mythological representation of the sun riding in a boat.
The "Khufu ship", a 43.6-meter-long vessel that was sealed into a pit
in the Giza pyramid complex at the foot of the Great Pyramid of Giza
around 2500 BC, is a full-size surviving example which may have
fulfilled the symbolic function of a solar barque. This boat was
rediscovered in May 1954 when archeologist Kamal el-Mallakh and
inspector Zaki Nur found two ditches sealed off by about 40 blocks
weighing 17 to 20 tonnes each. This boat was disassembled into
1,224 pieces and took over 10 years to reassemble. A nearby
museum was built to house this boat.[1]
Other sun boats were found in Egypt dating to different pharonic
dynasties.[2]
Examples include:
Neolithic petroglyphs which (it has been speculated) show solar
barges
The many early Egyptian goddesses who are related as sun



deities and the later gods Ra and Horus depicted as riding in a
solar barge. In Egyptian myths of the afterlife, Ra rides in an
underground channel from west to east every night so that he
can rise in the east the next morning.
The Nebra sky disk, which (it has been speculated) features a
depiction of a solar barge.
Nordic Bronze Age petroglyphs, including those found in
Tanumshede often contains barges and sun crosses in different
constellations.
A "sun chariot" is a mythological representation of the sun riding in a
chariot. The concept is younger than that of the solar barge, and
typically Indo-European, corresponding with the Indo-European
expansion after the invention of the chariot in the 2nd millennium BC.
Examples include:
Trundholm sun chariot of the Nordic deity, Sól, drawn by Arvak
and Alsvid
Greek Helios riding in a chariot,[3] (see also Phaëton[4])
Sol Invictus depicted riding a quadriga on the reverse of a
Roman coin.[5]
Vedic Surya riding in a chariot drawn by seven horses
The sun itself also was compared to a wheel, possibly in Proto-Indo
European, Greek hēliou kuklos, Sanskrit suryasya cakram, Anglo
Saxon sunnan hweogul (PIE *swelyosyo kukwelos).
- The "Solar Barge" has nothing to do whit the Sun! The
Barge/Boat/Ship has everything to do with the crescent Milky
Way contours of both Earth hemispheres, hence a Female Boat
in the southern ("underworld") hemisphere, and a Male Boat in
the northern hemisphere.



These Barge/Boat/Ship "sails" around the respective polar
center points/wheels on both hemispheres.
CHURCH-SHIP AND WORSHIP.
Mythically and historically in Denmark we have had a tradition
concerning in which side the woman and men should be placed
when visiting the Church. Historically we also have the tradition of
mention the interior of the Church as a "Ship".
It is my believe that the tradition have its origin in old mythological
rituals to follow the heavenly ideas of the Great God and Goddess.
Above you can see the idea from the star map Milky Way contours of



the Heavenly Couple over the schematic ship-like drawing, to the
picture of a stone row ship and to the drawn collage on picture 3
with the whole idea concept connected.
When sitting in the church, the male side to the North in the Church,
was mentioned at the "Sword" side and the female side to the South
was mentioned the "Spinning" side. Now, most churches are aligned
in the east/west direction with the so called side ships or the rows of
benches to the north and south.



Looking at the Contours above at picture 1 and 2 it is easy to see
why the northern side was mentioned the sword side. But what could
then be the reason to call the female and southern Milky Way the
"Spinning" side? Well, as mentioned in "The Milky Way Spiral Centre"
the most specific feature of the southern Milky Way contours are,
that it's here, in the direction of the star constellation of Sagittarius,
you can find the centre in our Galaxy and the spiral arms with the
whole Galaxy spinning around itself once every approximately 210
millions of years. That spinning fact could very well be the origin to
the myth and tradition.
Noah's Ark
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopaedia
A painting by the American Edward Hicks (1780–1849), showing the
animals boarding Noah's Ark two by two.



Noah's Ark (Hebrew: תיבת נח , Tevat Noach; Arabic: سفينة نوح , Safina
Nuh) is the vessel, which, according to the Book of Genesis, was
built by the Patriarch Noah at God's command to save himself, his
family and the world's animals from a worldwide deluge. The story
features in a number of Abrahamic religions including Judaism,
Christianity and Islam.
The biblical account, told in the Book of Genesis 6-9, tells how God
sends a great flood to destroy the earth because of man's
wickedness and because the earth is corrupt. God tells Noah, a
righteous man in his generation, to build a large vessel to save his
family and a representation of the world's animals. God gives
detailed instructions for the Ark, and after its completion, sends the
animals to Noah. God then sends the Flood which rises until all the
mountains are covered and every living thing died. Then "God
remembered Noah," the waters abate, and dry land reappears. Noah,
his family, and the animals leave the Ark, and God enter a covenant
to never again send a flood to destroy the earth.
The narrative has been subject to extensive elaborations in Judaism,
Christianity and Islam, ranging from hypothetical solutions to
practical problems (e.g. waste disposal and the problem of lighting
the interior), through to theological interpretations (e.g. the Ark as
the precursor of the Church in offering salvation to mankind).
[1]
Although traditionally accepted as historical, by the 19th century the
discoveries of archaeologists and biblical scholars had led most
people to abandon a literal interpretation of the Ark story.
[2][3][4]
Nevertheless, biblical literalists continue to explore the region of the
mountains of Ararat, in eastern Turkey, where the Bible says the Ark
came to rest.

[edit] Narrative (Genesis 6-9)
The Subsiding of the Waters by Thomas Cole
(Quotations from the English Standard Version)
God observes that the Earth is corrupted with violence and decides
to destroy all life. But Noah "was a righteous man, blameless in his



generation, [and] Noah walked with God," and God gives him
instructions for the construction of an ark, into which he is told to
bring "two of every sort [of animal] ... male and female," and their
food.[6]
God instructs Noah to board the ark with his family, and seven pairs
of the birds and the clean animals, and two pairs of the unclean
animals, and "on the same day all the fountains of the great deep
were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened, and the
rain was upon the earth," and God closes up the door of the ark. The
flood begins, and the waters prevail until all the high mountains are
covered fifteen cubits deep, and all the people and animals and
creeping things and birds of the heavens are blotted out from the
earth, and only Noah and those with him in the ark remain."[7]
Then "God remembered Noah," and causes his wind to blow, and the
fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens are closed,
and the rain is restrained, and the waters abate. In the seventh
month the Ark rests on the mountains of Ararat, and in the tenth
month the tops of the mountains are seen. Then Noah sends out a
raven and then a dove to see if the waters have subsided, and the
dove returns with a fresh olive leaf in her beak. Noah waits seven
days more and sends out the dove again, and this time it does not
return.[8]
"In the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of
the month, the waters were dried from off the earth, and Noah
removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the face of
the ground was dry." God tells Noah to leave the ark, Noah offers a
sacrifice to God, and God resolves never again to destroy the earth,
"for the intention of manʼs heart is evil from his youth."[8] God grants
to Noah and his sons the right to kill animals and eat their meat, but
forbids meat which has not been drained of its blood. Nor is blood to



be shed except for this purpose: "For your lifeblood I will require a
reckoning: from every beast I will require it and from man...Whoever
sheds the blood of man, by man shall his blood be shed, for God
made man in his own image." Then God establish his covenant with
Noah and his sons and with all living things, and places the rainbow
in the clouds, "the sign of the covenant that I have established
between me and all flesh that is on the earth."[9]
The Ark in later traditions
In Rabbinic tradition
The story of Noah and the Ark was subject to much discussion in
later Jewish rabbinic literature. Noah's failure to warn others of the
coming flood was widely seen as casting doubt on his righteousness
—was he perhaps only righteous by the lights of his own evil
generation? According to one tradition, he had in fact passed on
God's warning, planting cedars one hundred and twenty years before
the Deluge so that the sinful could see and be urged to amend their
ways. In order to protect Noah and his family, God placed lions and
other ferocious animals to guard them from the wicked who mocked
them and offered them violence. According to one midrash, it was



God, or the angels, who gathered the animals to the Ark, together
with their food. As there had been no need to distinguish between
clean and unclean animals before this time, the clean animals made
themselves known by kneeling before Noah as they entered the Ark.
A differing opinion said that the Ark itself distinguished clean animals
from unclean, admitting seven each of the former and two each of
the latter.
Noah was engaged both day and night in feeding and caring for the
animals, and did not sleep for the entire year aboard the Ark. The
animals were the best of their species, and so behaved with utmost
goodness. They abstained from procreation, so that the number of
creatures that disembarked was exactly equal to the number that
embarked. The raven created problems, refusing to go out of the Ark
when Noah sent it forth and accusing the Patriarch of wishing to
destroy its race, but as the commentators pointed out, God wished
to save the raven, for its descendants were destined to feed the
prophet Elijah.
Refuse was stored on the lowest of the Ark's three decks, humans
and clean beasts on the second, and the unclean animals and birds
on the top. A differing opinion placed the refuse in the utmost storey,
from where it was shovelled into the sea through a trapdoor.
Precious stones, bright as midday, provided light, and God ensured
that food was kept fresh. The giant Og, king of Bashan, was among
those saved, but owing to his size had to remain outside, Noah
passing him food through a hole cut into the wall of the Ark.[10][11][12]
In Christian tradition
From the first century, Christians interpreted the story to fit the new
religion. In the First Epistle of Peter those saved by the Ark from the
waters of the Flood are said to prefigure the salvation of God's Elect



through baptism,[13] St. Hippolytus of Rome, (d. 235), seeking to
demonstrate that "the ark was a symbol of the Christ who was
expected", stated that the vessel had its door on the east side - the
direction from which Christ would appear at the Second Coming
that the bones of Adam were brought aboard together with gold,
frankincense and myrrh - symbols of the Nativity of Christ - and that
the Ark floated to and fro in the four directions on the waters, making
the sign of the cross, before eventually landing on Mount Kardu "in
the east, in the land of the sons of Raban, and the Orientals call it
Mount Godash; the Armenians and Persians call it Ararat".[14] On a
more practical plane, Hippolytus explained that the ark was built in
three stories, the lowest for wild beasts, the middle for birds and
domestic animals, and the top level for humans, and that the male
animals were separated from the females by sharp stakes so that
there would be no cohabitation aboard the vessel.[14]
From the same period the early Church Father Origen (c. 182–251),
responding to a critic who doubted that the Ark could contain all the
animals in the world, countered with a learned argument about
cubits, holding that Moses, the traditional author of the book of
Genesis, had been brought up in Egypt and would therefore have
used the larger Egyptian cubit. He also fixed the shape of the Ark as
a truncated pyramid, square at its base, and tapering to a square
peak one cubit on a side; it was not until the 12th century that it
came to be thought of as a rectangular box with a sloping roof.[15]
Early Christian artists depicted Noah standing in a small box on the
waves, symbolising God saving the Church as it persevered through
turmoil, and St. Augustine of Hippo (354–430), in City of God,
demonstrated that the dimensions of the Ark corresponded to the
dimensions of the human body, which is the body of Christ, which is
the Church.[1] St. Jerome (c. 347–420) called the raven, which was
sent forth and did not return, the "foul bird of wickedness" expelled



by baptism;[16] more enduringly, the dove and olive branch came to
symbolize the Holy Spirit and the hope of salvation and, eventually,
peace.[15]
In Islam tradition
Ibn Battuta, 1304–77, the Moroccan world-traveller who passed by
the mountain of al-Judi, near Mosul, resting place of the Ark in
Islamic tradition.
Noah (Nuh) is one of the five principal prophets of Islam. References
are scattered through the Qur'an, with the fullest account in surah
Hud (11v27–51). As a prophet, Noah preached to his people, but with
little success; only "a few"[11v40] of them converted (traditionally
thought to be seventy). Noah prayed for deliverance, and God told
him to build a ship in preparation for the flood. In answer to Noah's
prayer that this evil generation should be destroyed seventy idolators
were converted and entered the Ark with him, bringing the total
aboard to 78 humans (these seventy plus the eight members of
Noah's own family). The seventy had no offspring, and all of post
flood humanity is descended from Noah's three sons. The flood
destroys all of Noah's people; his son Canaan was among those
drowned, despite Noah pleading with God to save him.
In contrast to the Jewish tradition, which uses a term which can be
translated as a "box" or "chest" to describe the Ark, surah 29v14



refers to it as a safina, an ordinary ship, and surah 54v13 as "a thing
of boards and nails". `Abd Allah ibn `Abbas, a contemporary of
Muhammad, wrote that Noah was in doubt as to what shape to make
the Ark, and that Allah revealed to him that it was to be shaped like a
bird's belly and fashioned of teak wood. Noah then planted a tree,
which in 20 years had grown enough to provide him all the wood he
needed.[17]
Abdallah ibn 'Umar al-Baidawi, writing in the 13th century, gives the
length of the Ark as 300 cubits (157 m, 515 ft) by 50 (26.2 m, 86 ft)
in width, 30 (15.7 m, 52 ft) in height, and explains that in the first of
the three levels wild and domesticated animals were lodged, in the
second the human beings, and in the third the birds. On every plank
was the name of a prophet. Three missing planks, symbolising three
prophets, were brought from Egypt by Og, son of Anak, the only one
of the giants permitted to survive the Flood. The body of Adam was
carried in the middle to divide the men from the women. Sura 11v41
says: "And he said, 'Ride ye in it; in the Name of God it moves and
stays!'" takes this to mean that Noah said, "In the Name of God!"
when he wished the Ark to move, and the same when he wished it to
stand still.
Noah spent five or six months aboard the Ark, at the end of which he
sent out a raven. But the raven stopped to feast on carrion, and so
Noah cursed it and sent out the dove, which has been known ever
since as the friend of mankind. The medieval scholar Abu al-Hasan
Ali ibn al-Husayn Masudi (died 956) writes that God commanded the
earth to absorb the water, and certain portions which were slow in
obeying received salt water in punishment and so became dry and
arid. The water which was not absorbed formed the seas, so that the
waters of the flood still exist. Masudi says that the Ark began its
voyage at Kufa in central Iraq and sailed to Mekka, circling the Kaaba
before finally traveling to Mount Judi, which surah 11v44 states was



its final resting place. This mountain is identified by tradition with a
hill near the town of Jazirat ibn Umar on the east bank of the Tigris in
the province of Mosul in northern Iraq, and Masudi says that the spot
where it came to rest could be seen in his time.
Noah left the Ark on the tenth day of Muharram, and he and his
family and companions built a town at the foot of Mount Judi named
Thamanin ("eighty"), from their number. Noah then locked the Ark
and entrusted the keys to Shem. Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179–1229)
mentions a mosque built by Noah which could be seen in his day,
and Ibn Batutta passed the mountain on his travels in the 14th
century. Modern Muslims, although not generally active in searching
for the Ark, believe that it still exists on the high slopes of the
mountain.[10][11]
In other traditions
The Mandaeans of the southern Iraqi marshes practice a religion that
was possibly influenced in part by early followers of John the Baptist.
They regard Noah as a prophet, while rejecting Abraham (and Jesus)
as false prophets. In the version given in their scriptures, the ark was
built of sandalwood from Jebel Harun and was cubic in shape, with a
length, width and height of 30 gama (the length of an arm); its final
resting place is said to be Egypt.
The religion of the Yazidi of the Sinjar mountains of northern Iraq
blends indigenous and Islamic beliefs. According to their Mishefa
Reş, the Deluge occurred not once, but twice. The original Deluge is
said to have been survived by a certain Na'umi, father of Ham,
whose ark landed at a place called Ain Sifni, in the region of Mosul.
Some time after this came the second flood, upon the Yezidis only,
which was survived by Noah, whose ship was pierced by a rock as it
floated above Mount Sinjar, then went on to land on Mount Judi as



described in Islamic tradition.
Historicity: The Ark and science
Various editions of the Encyclopedia Britannica reflect the collapse
of belief in the historicity of the Ark in the face of advancing
scientific knowledge. Its 1771 edition offered the following as
scientific evidence for the ark's size and capacity: "...Buteo and
Kircher have proved geometrically, that, taking the common cubit as
a foot and a half, the ark was abundantly sufficient for all the animals
supposed to be lodged in it..., the number of species of animals will
be found much less than is generally imagined, not amounting to an
hundred species of quadrupeds... ." By the eighth edition (1853
1860) the encyclopedia says of the Noah story, "The insuperable
difficulties connected with the belief that all other existing species of
animals were provided for in the ark are obviated by adopting the
suggestion of Bishop Stillingfleet, approved by Matthew Poole...and
others, that the Deluge did not extend beyond the region of the earth
then inhabited..." By the ninth edition, in 1875, there is no attempt to
reconcile the Noah story with scientific fact, and it is presented
without comment. In the 1960 edition, in the article Ark, we find the
following, "Before the days of "higher criticism" and the rise of the
modern scientific views as to the origin of the species, there was
much discussion among the learned, and many ingenious and
curious theories were advanced, as to the number of animals on the
ark..."[18]
16th-18th centuries
The Renaissance saw a continued speculation that might have
seemed familiar to Origen and Augustine. Yet at the same time, a
new class of scholarship arose, one which, while never questioning
the literal truth of the Ark story, began to speculate on the practical



workings of Noah's vessel from within a purely naturalistic
framework. Thus in the 15th century, Alfonso Tostada gave a detailed
account of the logistics of the Ark, down to arrangements for the
disposal of dung and the circulation of fresh air, and the noted 16th
century geometrician Johannes Buteo calculated the ship's internal
dimensions, allowing room for Noah's grinding mills and smokeless
ovens, a model widely adopted by other commentators.[15]
By the 17th century, it was becoming necessary to reconcile the
exploration of the New World and increased awareness of the global
distribution of species with the older belief that all life had sprung
from a single point of origin on the slopes of Mount Ararat. The
obvious answer was that man had spread over the continents
following the destruction of the Tower of Babel and taken animals
with him, yet some of the results seemed peculiar: why had the
natives of North America taken rattlesnakes, but not horses,
wondered Sir Thomas Browne in 1646? "How America abounded
with Beasts of prey and noxious Animals, yet contained not in that
necessary Creature, a Horse, is very strange".[15]
Browne, who was among the first to question the notion of
spontaneous generation, was a medical doctor and amateur scientist
making this observation in passing. Biblical scholars of the time such
as Justus Lipsius (1547–1606) and Athanasius Kircher (c.1601–80)
were also beginning to subject the Ark story to rigorous scrutiny as
they attempted to harmonise the biblical account with natural
historical knowledge. The resulting hypotheses were an important
impetus to the study of the geographical distribution of plants and
animals, and indirectly spurred the emergence of biogeography in
the 18th century. Natural historians began to draw connections
between climates and the animals and plants adapted to them. One
influential theory held that the biblical Ararat was striped with varying
climatic zones, and as climate changed, the associated animals



moved as well, eventually spreading to repopulate the globe. There
was also the problem of an ever-expanding number of known
species: for Kircher and earlier natural historians, there was little
problem finding room for all known animal species in the Ark, but by
the time John Ray (1627–1705) was working, just several decades
after Kircher, their number had expanded beyond biblical
proportions. Incorporating the full range of animal diversity into the
Ark story was becoming increasingly difficult,[3] and by the middle of
the 18th century few natural historians could justify a literal
interpretation of the Noah's Ark narrative.[4] An uneasy
rapprochement was reached by thinkers such as Edward Stillingfleet,
a late 17th century English theologian and scholar who suggested
that mankind at the time of Noah had inhabited only a small portion
of the world, so that a purely local Flood would square the bible with
science; the idea gained popularity in intellectual circles in the 18th
century, but was increasingly abandoned as the century wore on and
the scientific evidence mounted.

19th century



In 1823 William Buckland interpreted geological phenomena as
Reliquiae Diluvianae; relics of the flood Attesting the Action of an
Universal Deluge. His views were supported by other English
clergymen naturalists at the time including the influential Adam
Sedgwick, but by 1830 Sedgwick considered that the evidence only
showed local floods. The deposits were subsequently explained by
Louis Agassiz as the results of glaciation.[19] In 1862 William
Thompson, later Lord Kelvin, calculated the age of the earth at
between 24 and 400 million years, and for the remainder of the 19th
century, discussion was not about whether Kelvin was right or
wrong, but about just how many millions were involved.[20] The field
of Geology had a profound impact on attitudes towards the biblical
Flood and Ark story: without the support of the biblical chronology,
which placed the Creation and the Flood in a history which stretched
back no more than a few thousand years, the historicity of the Ark
itself was undermined. The influential 1889 volume of theological
essays Lux Mundi, which is usually held to mark a stage in the
acceptance of a more critical approach to scripture, took the stance
that the gospels could be relied on as completely historical, but the
earlier chapters of Genesis should not be taken literally.[21]
In the 19th century biblical scholars were beginning to examine the
origins of the Bible itself. The Noah's Ark story played a central role
in the new theories, largely because, using the newly developed
tools of source criticism, scholars discovered in the Ark narrative two
complete, coherent, parallel stories. It is stated twice over, for
example, that God was angered with his creation, but the reasons
given in each telling are slightly different; we are told that there was a
single pair of each animal aboard, but also that there were seven
pairs of the clean animals; that the source of the water was rain, but
also that it came from the "windows of Heaven" and the "fountains of
the Deep"; that the rains lasted forty days, but that the waters rose



for 150. This, they decided, was how the entire Pentateuch (the first
five books of the Bible) had been written: the work of many authors
over many centuries, combining separate sources into a single
whole.[22]
The 19th century also saw the growth of Middle Eastern archaeology
and the first translations into English of ancient Mesopotamian
records. The Assyriologist George Smith achieved world-wide fame
with his translation of the Babylonian account of the Great Flood,
which he read before the Society of Biblical Archaeology on
December 3, 1872; the audience included the Prime Minister William
Ewart Gladstone, the only known instance of a serving British
Premier ever attending a lecture on Babylonian literature.[citation
needed] Further exploration and discoveries brought to light several
versions of the Mesopotamian flood-myth, with the closest to
Genesis 6-9 in a 7th century BC Babylonian copy of the Epic of
Gilgamesh: the hero Gilgamesh meets the immortal man
Utnapishtim, who tells how the god Ea warned him to build a vessel
in which to save his family, his friends, and his wealth and cattle from
a great flood by which the gods intended to destroy the world.
[edit] The Ark and Genesis 1
As the Flood rises it wipes out the work of Creation, each month of
the Flood corresponding to the matching day of Creation. As God on
the second day created the firmament to separate the Earth from
waters above and below, so in the second month God opens the
floodgates of Heaven and the fountains of the Deep and allows the
waters to return; as the work of Creation was completed on the sixth
day when all living things were ready for man, so the Flood rises for a
further five months (the 150 days of Genesis 7v24) until "everything
that had the breath of life in its nostrils, everything that was on the
earth, died"; and as God rested on the seventh day, so the Ark rests



on the seventh month. The world is then re-created: the firmament
and the "fountains of the Deep" are closed, the mountain peaks
appear (in the tenth month, equivalent to the third day of Creation
when God commanded "Let the land appear"), Noah sends out birds
(in the twelfth month, equivalent to the fifth day of Creation when
birds were made), the waters dry from the land, and in the fourteenth
month, equivalent to the seventh day, men and creatures exit the
Ark, and Noah enters into the first Covenant with God.[23]
[edit] Ark and Tabernacle
The Ark is 300 cubits long, 50 cubits wide, and 30 cubits high, and it
has three decks. Each deck thus has the same height as the
Tabernacle and three times the area of the Tabernacle forecourt.
Claus Westermann has therefore suggested that the dimensions of
Ark and Tabernacle indicate that the biblical authors saw both
structures serving the same purpose, the preservation of mankind
for God's plan.[24]
[edit] The chiasmus (palistrophe) in the Ark story
A chiasmus (or palistrophe if it has more than four elements) is a
literary device in which one half of a story or poem is a mirror-image
of the other, giving a form A1BA2 etc. Several variations have been
proposed, (Gordon Wenhamʼs analysis (1978), with some 15
elements, is probably the most elaborate), but all follow Wenham in
placing "And God remembered Noah" at the centre:[25]
A1. Noah and animals enter the Ark
B1. Flood increases on the Earth
C1. Mountains covered, all living things die



D1.Waters cover the Earth
E. God "remembers" Noah, God's wind blows
over the waters
D2. Waters begin to recede
C2: Mountain-tops become visible, Ark rests on the
mountains
B2: Flood recedes from the Earth
A2: Noah and animals leave the Ark
These analyses have been criticised by J. A. Emerton on the
following grounds as being essentially subjective and inclined to
arbitrary results: (a) there is no symmetry in the length of the paired
units, which varies from half a verse to several verses; (b) the
schemes are selective, omitting phrases and sentences which are at
least as significant as those which are included; and (c) some of the
pairings are forced. He therefore rejects the literary analysis as too
subjective: although such analysis deals with the text in its final form
rather than with its hypothetical antecedents, it does not, in practice,
deal with, and account for, the whole text.[26] Nevertheless, the
chiastic structure of the Ark narrative continues to be widely quoted
in scholarly literature, even by scholars who are not inclined to a
historicising reading of the story.
Literalism and the search for Noah's ark
Biblical literalists continue to believe in a literal Ark, advancing
arguments not so different from those in the earliest editions of the
Encyclopedia Britannica.[27] They feel that finding the Ark would
validate their views on a whole range of matters, from geology to



evolution. "If the flood of Noah indeed wiped out the entire human
race and its civilization, as the Bible teaches, then the Ark
constitutes the one remaining major link to the pre-flood World. No
significant artifact could ever be of greater antiquity or importance...
[with] tremendous potential impact on the creation-evolution
(including theistic evolution) controversy."[28] Searches for Noah's
Ark continue on and around Mount Ararat in Turkey.
