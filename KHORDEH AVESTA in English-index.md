FOREWORD
The Khordeh-Avesta, with text and translation in Gujarati, had been prepared in the year 1880 A. D. by the celebrated Avesta Scholar, the Late Ervad Kavasji Edulji Kanga. This work is known as Khordeh Avesta BāMāyeni. The value and the utility of this book could be perceived from the fact that even after more than a century, It has remained a standard work in the Parsi Community for the purpose of prayers, and as well among the scholars as an indispensable reference book. The demand has been such that it has subsequently been, published into thirteen editions.
In recent times, however, it has been noticed that a fairly large number of Zoroastrians have been migrating to the Western countries, and hence have difficulty in following the Gujarati language. Moreover, the younger generation in India are also nowadays not familiar with the Gujarati language. A serious need was felt, therefore, to have a Khordeh-Avesta in English on the lines of the Khordeh-Avesta Bā-Māyeni in Gujarati by the late Ervad K. E. Kanga.
The Trustees of the Bombay Parsi Punchayet entrusted the work of rendering the said Gujarati Khordeh-Avesta Bā-Māyeni into an English version (Text in Roman Script with English Translation) to the well-known Scholar of Iranology, Prof. Ervad Maneck Furdoonji Kanga who had completed this work diligently, but did not live for his work to see the light of day, as he passed way in October, 1988. For the proof-reading and correction of this publication, thanks are due to Ervad Ratanshah Rustomji Motafram who is the Head-Master of the M. F. Cama Athornan Institute, Andheri, and an erudite scholar of Avesta Pahlavi.
The Trustees of the Bombay Parsi Punchayet have great pleasure in publishing this invaluable book and presenting the same in the service of the Parsi Community.
Dr. Aspi F. Golwalla, Chairman, Board of Trustees, Parsi Punchayet Funds and Properties, Bombay. Bombay, 15th January, 1993.

Foreword to 2013 corrected edition.
The English edition of Ervad Kangaji’s popular classic was first printed in 1993. Unfortunately, the printed edition has since become very scarce. Ten years later, it was digitised and put on the avesta.org web site through the tireless efforts of Ervad Soli Dastur. It quickly became one of the most viewed and downloaded documents on the website – currently over 170,000 times – a staggering amount in view of the small number of practising Zoroastrians.
In 2011, in view of its popularity, and the fact that “the Parsees look upon Ervad Kanga’s editions as the standard prayer-books in point of pronunciation,” I undertook the task of preparing an ebook version of the classic, which could be viewed on smart phones and tablets. At the same time I took the opportunity to correct the frequent printer’s errors which that edition suffered from. Given the technical difficulties, it has taken nearly two years to complete the task. I am sure the scanning process has introduced new defects, and I welcome all feedback so I can make further corrections.
For those who are interested, a list of the corrections can be found at http://www.avesta.org/kanga/ka_english_kanga_errata.pdf

Preface to the English Edition of the Khordeh Avesta-Bā-Māyeni
The oldest Zoroastrian religious scripture, as preserved at present, is known as the Avesta. A section of this Avesta is known as the “KhordehAvesta’ which means the “Smaller (i.e. Selected) Avesta”. This is the book of daily prayers of the Zoroastrians. It is a cherished possession of every devoted Zoroastrian household. The Khordeh Avesta is a collection of prayers selected from other major works of extant Avesta literature such as Yasna, Vispered, Vendidad, and the Yasht Literature. For instance, the Atash Nyāyesh is taken from Yasna Chapter 62, and the Āvān Ardvisur Nyāyesh is taken from Yasna Chapter 65, and so on.
The book “Khordeh Avesta”, therefore, contains daily prayers including the Kusti prayers, Hoshbam, Five Gāhs, Five Nyāyeshes (praise, litany), the Āfringān (benedictions, blessings) containing invocatory prayers and blessings dedicated to Ardāfravash, Dahmān, Srosh, Gahambar, Gatha, Rapithwin, etc., besides some prayers in Pazend.
The “Khordeh Avesta,” intended for the use of the devotees, is a collection of the forms of prayers most required by them at various seasons and in the various circumstances of their lives. As such, it is not a book of uniform content and fixed arrangement. Thus, all the Yashts are also included in the “Tamām Khordeh Avesta;” but because of the convenience of printing facilities, only a few Yashts, known as the shorter Yashts, and also those which the publisher considers as being necessary or popular, are generally included in the Khordeh Avesta. The Hormazd Yasht, the Ardibehesht Yasht, the Srosh Yasht Hādokht, the Srosh Yasht Vadi, the smaller Hom and Vanant Yashts, Haftan Yasht, and the Bahram Yasht are generally included. However, different editions contain a varying number of Yashts. For the convenience of the devotees, even the Five Gathas of the Holy Prophet Zarathushtra, which form a part of the Yasna section, are included in some of the editions of the Khordeh Avesta.
Zoroastrians recite their prayers in Avesta which is a sacred language. Among several words for “prayers” in Avesta, one is called “mānthra”, which means “thought (force), word, holy word”. It is similar to the Sanskrit “mantra”, and the Sanskrit translation is rendered as “mānthravāni” which is also significantly called “ādesha”: “Divine Command”.
Among other Avesta words for “prayer”, the “Mānthra” therefore, occupies a very important position, According to the Yasna Chapter 29.7 (Gatha Ahunavaiti), “mānthra” is the Holy Word of Divine Origin, and the Holy Word of Ahura Mazda. One of the collections of these “mānthras” is known as “Mānthra Spenta” in Avesta which means “the Holy, beneficent Word”, and which is “effective and full of glory”. It is stated in the Fravardin Yasht (paragraph 81) that “Mānthra Spenta is the soul of Ahura Mazda”.
iii



iv Khordeh Avesta
According to Hormazd Yasht, the Holy Names of Ahura Mazda mentioned therein, form a section of the Mānthra Spenta.
In Siruze Yasht, in the “Khshnuman” (propitiatory formula) of the Mānthra Spenta (Mārespand), it is stated: “We revere the much glorious Mānthra Spenta, we revere the law against the demons, we revere the creed of Zarathushtra, we revere the long-standing traditions, we revere the good Māzdayasni Religion”. These are some of the foundational beliefs of the Zoroastrian religion.
Avesta being a sacred language, it is incumbent upon every Zoroastrian to recite his/her prayers in Avesta. At the same time, any person would like to learn about the general meanings of the prayers which he/she recites. For this, there are several translations available in different languages though very often, such translations do not bring out the spirit of the original.
In the year 1880 A.C. then, a pioneering work in this field was carried out by the celebrated Avesta scholar, the late Ervad Kavasji Edulji Kanga, of revered memory. He brought out a translation of the Khordeh Avesta in Gujarati in a scholarly and systematic manner, transliterating and translating each paragraph simultaneously, and giving a number to each word for the benefit of the readers following the translation with accuracy. He also gave footnotes, wherever necessary, in the light of modern research based on philology. This work is known as the Khordeh Avesta-Bā-Māyeni: “Khordeh Avesta with meanings”.
The late Ervad Kavasji Kanga was an inspired soul. Not only did he bring out this translation of the Khordeh Avesta, but he went on to accomplish the monumental task of translating the entire Avesta scriptures available to us at present, besides bringing out an Avesta-English-Gujarati dictionary, and also a treatise on Avesta grammar.
Though a century has now elapsed, this translation of Khordeh Avesta has stood the test of time, and has remained a standard and authentic piece of literary work, both for the scholars and for the laity. As many as thirteen editions of this translation-work have been brought out successively, the last one being in 1976.
The original translation of the Khordeh Avesta by Ervad Kavasji Kanga was in the Gujarati language. Even though there is much demand for work of this kind and utility, readership in the Gujarati language is gradually diminishing in the Parsi community, particularly among the younger generation, as well as among a very large number of those who have migrated to Western Countries in recent years. Though some English translations of the Khordeh Avesta have been attempted, and are available, a great need has been felt for an English version of Kangaji’s classic Gujarati translation of the Khordeh Avesta.



PREFACE v
The Trustees of the Parsi Punchayat of Bombay therefore took upon themselves to carry out this fundamental duty, and decided to get the Gujarati translation of Khordeh Avesta-Bā-Māyeni of Ervad K. E. Kanga rendered into English. This task they then entrusted to another celebrated scholar of international repute, namely, the late Prof. Ervad Maneck Furdoonji Kanga, who was incidentally a relative of the late Ervad Kavasji Kanga. Prof. M. F. Kanga has written innumerable articles on Iranian subjects for various journals, books, memorial and commemorative volumes throughout the scholarly world.
The terms of reference of this work entrusted to Prof. M. F. Kanga were to carry out a faithful word-by-word translation into English language from the original Gujarati of Ervad K. E. Kanga, and also to include the text in the Roman script, without any alteration. Prof. M. F. Kanga completed the work with meticulous care and brought to bearing on it his vast knowledge and experience. By Divine Grace, Prof. M. F. Kanga not only carried out this work, but also transliterated and translated into English Kavasji Kanga’s two other works, namely, Gātha-Bā-Māyeni and Yasht-Bā-Māyeni before his sad demise in October 1988 at the age of 80 years.
The Trustees of the Parsi Punchayat of Bombay deserve to be complimented for the publication of this work, and it is earnestly hoped that they will also authorise the publication as early as possible, of the two other works, namely, Gātha-Bā-Māyeni and Yasht-Bā-Māyeni, completed by the late Prof. M. F. Kanga, for the benefit of the Parsi Community.

PREFACE TO THE ELEVENTH EDITION.
The last edition of this book was published in January 1926. Since then various small Avesta prayer-books were published by cheap-rate dealers. Nevertheless there was a demand as usual for the present edition make by the co-religionists which proves still the high degree of their zeal and devotion for the recital of Avesta prayers in correct orthography and for understanding the sense thereof.
There may be numerous editions of prayer-books with incorrect pronunciations prevalent among the Parsees, yet the demand for Ervad Kavasji Kanga’s publications with correct pronunciation has remained constant, inasmuch as the Parsees look upon Ervad Kanga’s editions as the Standard pray



vi Khordeh Avesta
er-books in point of pronunciation.
The final proofs of the last edition of this book as well as of recent edi tions of Yasht Ba Maeni and Gatha Ba Maeni of my late revered grandfather were gone through by our well-known Avesta Pahlavi scholar Ervad Bomani Naserwanji Dhabhar, M. A. who has always obliged me by his help. This time he was not able to help me owing to cataracts in his eyes. Another Avesta Pahlavi scholar was approached by me who willingly complying with my request at the sacrifice of his time went through all the final proofs of this edition, for which act of his courtesy and kindness my thanks are due to him.

PREFACE TO THE FIFTH EDITION.
The first edition of my Khordeh Avesta was issued in 1880 and the last in 1896. The rapid sale commanded by those editions is an unmistakable proof of the general desire on the part of my co-religionists to recite their prayers according to the correct and authenticated texts and to know their meaning. In placing this fifth edition before the public, I have thoroughly examined the texts and interpretations given in my former editions, and made alterations and modifications, where necessary, in the light of my continued studies. The present revised edition has been enlarged by the addition of the Sirozāh Yasht, the Afringāns and the Pazend Nirang recited at times after the prayers, and a Monājāt by the late Moolla Feeroz with their translations.

PREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.
This, the fourth edition of my Khordeh Avesta has been enlarged by the addition of two new Yashts, viz. Khorshed and Māh and the Avesta and Pazend chapter (Kardēh), recited in memory of departed relatives, has been inserted with its translation. The translation and notes throughout have been carefully revised in the light of further study and research. I have carefully perused the latest edition of Professor Darmesteter’s French version of the Avesta, and gleaned from it useful matters and inserted it in this work in the shape of footnotes. The passages of the Gathas, occurring in the Khordeh Avesta, have been reproduced in the form of verse. Besides, many other matters which can suitably find a place in a work of this kind have been added. In short, an earnest endeavour has been made to improve and enlarge the work and bring it up to date. With a view, however, to place it within the reach of all classes of my coreligionists, no increase has been made in the price of the book, which, as in the case of the last two editions, has been fixed at Rs. 2-8 ans, per copy.



PREFACE vii
I beg to acknowledge the obligation I owe to the esteemed Trustees of the Sir Jamsetjee Jeejeebhoy Translation Fund for their support by subscribing for sixty copies of this Work.

PREFACE TO THE THIRD EDITION.
The rapid sale, in the short space of two years and a half of the second edition revised and enlarged of this Work affords evidence at once satisfactory and gratifying of the utility and appreciation of the book, and of the growing taste for a correct and intelligent reciting of prayers among the Parsi community. In the present edition, two Yashts, viz., Tir and Gosh have been added to the ten given in the second edition; the number of Yashts in this edition being thus twelve in all.
I may add that, following the new edition of the Avesta Texts published by Dr. Karl F. Geldner, I have altered, in many places, certain Avestaic words, which appeared to me in the course of my study of that book to admit of corrections; and with the view of affording facility of reference to Avesta students, I have numbered the paragraphs in my text and translation as Dr. Geldner’s text. The translation has also, in some places, undergone revisions and improvements, suggested by further study and consideration of the Avesta literature.

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION.
The first edition of this Khordeh Avesta was issued in 1880. To judge from the favourable reception accorded to it, (a thousand copies having been sold off and a new issue called for ), the work may be assumed to have supplied a want and to be well adapted to the needs of the community for which it was intended. * * * Passages of Avesta and Pazend, which were omitted in the first edition, after they had been once cited, have been repeated in the present issue, on every occasion on which they recur. This and the addition of three Yashts has somewhat increased the bulk of the volume; yet the price has been greatly reduced, in order to place it within the reach of all sections of the community. KAVASJI EDALJI KANGA. Bombay, December, 1887.
PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.
More than 60 years ago a translation of the Khordeh Avesta was for the first time published by the late Dustoor Framji Sorabji Meherji Rana. A few months later on another translation of the same was issued by the late Dus



viii Khordeh Avesta
toor Edalji Dorabji Sanjana. These translations did not materially differ from each other; but for all practical purposes, the latter, up till now, has been most in use – it having passed in the meantime through several editions with but few important alterations. Thanks, however, to the rapid, but immensely satisfactory, progress made in comparative philology during the last half century by the indefatigable savants of Europe, considerable light has been thrown, not only on the ancient Zoroastrian religion, but on the interpretation of many a difficult passage in the Zend Avesta. Facts unknown before and excellences quite buried in obscurity have, by its aid, been brought to the surface; while some portion of the Zend Avesta, so ambiguous before, has been correctly interpreted and translated into Gujarati.a These made the want of a translation of the Khordeh Avesta, according to the most correct rules of grammar and philology, keenly felt; and I therefore undertook to supply it, at the suggestion of many educated and intelligent Zoroastrians.
The whole of the translation is based on Professor Westergaard’s excellent Zend text. This it was at first intended to publish in Zend characters, but being aware of the inability of a great portion of my co-religionists to peruse it in Zend, I deemed it expedient to abandon the original intention, and make the Work more convenient and accessible by transliterating the original text into correct Gujarati. In so doing, I have had to undergo the trouble and expense of getting cast some letters, the corresponding ones for which were not to be found in the Gujarati alphabet.
The text is divided into a number of convenient paragraphs, and each paragraph has subjoined to it, its translation; and to prevent confusion types in black pica have been throughout employed for the text and ordinary pica for the translation. In the translation the two-fold end is observed of making it useful both to Zend students and to general readers. It is kept, as much as practicable, close to the text, each word of which is distinguished by a number, corresponding with that placed over its translation immediately below. Words not occurring in the original, but necessary to complete the sense of the translation, are placed in parentheses. In many cases the substance of one or more paragraphs is summarized by way of explanation and placed below the literal translation.
Besides the correct text and its translation referred to above, the following important points are attended to:- (1) Careful attention is paid to punctuation, for want of which gross mistakes often arise. (2) Zend text is, in order to avoid confusion, separated and pointed out distinctly from the Pazend text, and the text composed at a later period. (3) Special care is taken to point
a (1) Vendidad translated into Gujarati with explanatory notes, and a complete philological and grammatical glossary of all the words contained in the texts by Kavasji Edalji Kanga (K. R. Cama’s Prize Essay). (2) Ten yashts, translated by Dustoor Eruchji Sorabji Meherji Rana and Ervad Muncherji Shapoorji Vachha. (3) Aban Yasht, translated by Ervad Tehmulji Dinshaw Ankleshvaria.



PREFACE ix
out the passages taken from the Yasna, Vispered and Vendidad. (4) Pazend passages are, as far as practicable, compared with their corresponding Zend passages. (5) Subjects cursorily treated in the Khordeh Avesta, but discussed at great length elsewhere, are here amplified with fuller information from other sources. (6) Technical terms of Zoroastrian ceremonials and ethics, such as hom, jeevām, barsam, zor, chinvat bridge, &c, are fully explained. (7) Passages treating of the excellence and efficacy of the prayers Yathā and Ashem are culled and fully explained. (8) Pahlavi translation is sometimes indented upon, as in the case of Atash Nyāyesh. (9) References to parallel Zend passages, as in the case of the translation of Patet Pashemani which is wholly in Pazend, are given with their meanings and explanations; and in several places, where it was found necessary, additional information from Pahlavi commentators is given in footnotes. (10) Certain ceremonials, required to be observed in several places during prayers, are explained. (11) Requisite information is given about the Gahambars and their proper seasons, on the authority of the Avesta. (12) The Pazend Confession of Faith, which is generally recited at the end of the prayers, is substituted by a far better one, and that too found in Zend, which, I trust, will be appreciated by my co-religionists. This Confession of Faith constitutes the twelfth Hā of Yasna.
In conclusion, I offer my deep and most grateful thanks to Mr. Khurshedjee Rustomjee Cama, our respected citizen and well-known oriental scholar, and my own learned preceptor. With that kindness and good nature which are so characteristic of him, and which have invariably won him the esteem and affection of his private pupils, he has most cordially rendered me, in the preparation of this Work, as in that of my previous ones, very valuable assistance. My obligations are due to him also for his many sensible and practical suggestions for the improvement of this Work.
Lastly, I trust to the indulgence of the reader to overlook any inaccuracies or defects which may have crept in the translation, notwithstanding all the care and attention conscientiously bestowed on it. A list of the several oriental works which proved useful to me during the progress of the Work is given elsewhere.

GLOSSARY
Bāz (baj): Indicates passages which are recited in a low tone or murmur.
falān: Indicates a place-holder in the text where the appropriate name should be inserted.
kīks and karaps: Kīks i.e. those who have eyes but would not see; karaps i.e. those who have ears but would not hear; its significance is, that they are neither paying attention to nor acknowledging the doctrines of the holy Zoroastrian Religion. For them words employed in Avesta are Kaoyām and Karafnāmcha; see Hormazd Yasht, para 10.
mānthra: Mānthra Spenta, i.e. beneficent or holy spell. The original meaning of mānthra (Sanskrit mantra) is “secret mysteries of the Zoroastrian Religion”, “mysterious excellences of the Zoroastrian Religion”. A reference about this we find in Vispered Kardāh 13, first paragraph, thus: “Ashem vīspem mānthrem yazamaide: Zarathushtrem hadhamānthrem yazamaide”, i.e. we worship the entire mānthra as holy; we worship Zarathushtra who is one with mānthras or the composer of the mānthras. In several later books it is stated that some writings of the Prophet Zarathushtra were so mysterious that even the great sages could not comprehend their meaning. Moreover, many famous Persian writers call him, “Paegambare Ramz-gu” (i.e. Prophet who reveals the secrets). We have no certain evidence at present as to how many these mānthras were originally given by him. See also preface.
Saoka: The original meaning of the word “Saoka” is sharpness, activity of the mind, brightness of intellect, splendour - brilliance of wisdom (root such = Sanskrit shuch = to shine): profit, prosperity, happiness (root su = Persian sud = to profit). Metaphorically it should be understood as the yazata presiding over these virtues.
Vanant: Vanant is, the central star in the West and the most brilliant. This star Fomalhaut are generally regarded as the same. It is called the opponent of the planet Jupiter.

Translation: Righteousness1 is4 the best3 good2 (and it) is6 happiness.5 Happiness7 (is) to him8 who9 (is) righteous12 for the sake of the best11 righteousness.10
Explanation:- The significance of the term “Righteousness” is to be understood as truth, holiness and pristine purity. In our Holy Avesta “Righteousness” is highly praised. For this the words “Staomi ashem”: (i.e., I praise Righteousness) are introduced. Purity of the mind and the body is the most excellent wealth and happiness of this world. That happiness which is highest in the matter of truth is attained to that person. The foremost thing which mankind ought to acquire after having born in this world is Truth, (see Yazishn Hā 48, stanza 5). Some references written in Avesta itself about the amount of meritorious deeds acquired by that reciter of Ashem Vohu Prayer on various occasions sincerely and with proper understanding is found in the first fargard-chapter of the Hādhokht Nask.c It is mentioned in it that one recital of Ashem Vohu recited with proper comprehension should be truly regarded as worth ten thousand recitals on other occasions, when a person waking up and rising up from sleep recites Ashem Vohu by relinquishing all wicked thoughts from the mind. Its significance is this that in the early morning while getting up from sleep one should acquire truth-Righteousness, and holding fast to it should carry on his daily affairs and business. It is futile to recite Ashem Vohu on one hand and to utter falsehood and deceive on the other hand. One must act according to it after reciting it. Moreover in the very same Nask another fact is mentioned that one recital of Ashem Vohū is worth the entire region Khvaniratha, which is the greatest and most excellent amongst the Seven Regions of the Earth. When a person at the end of life recites one Ashem Vohu prayer sincerely, he forsakes all wicked thoughts from his mind.
b These two prayers Ashem Vohu and Yathā Ahū Vairyō are pre-Zarathushtra in age and are the sacred Verses of the Creator Hormazd Himself. (See Yasna Hā XIX, paras 1-4 and 14; Yasna Hā XX.3). Yenghe Hātām is the sacred Verse of the Prophet Zarathushtra (See Yasna Hā XXI, para 1). These three well-known prayers are adored with their specific names. Yasna Hā XIX is an Avestan commentary on the Yathā Ahu Vairyō; Yasna Hā XX gives the commentary on Ashem Vohu and Yasna Hā XXI gives the commentary of the Yenghe Hātām. These three Hās chapters are known as Baghān Yasht. These three prayers, specially “Yathā” and “Ashem” are frequently recited in our holy Avestan Scriptures. Those Zoroastrians who do not know any oth er prayer are enjoined to recite “Yathā” and “Ashem” with a view to gaining a share of meritorious deeds. c See my Yasht Bā Maeni. Yasht XXI, pp. 386-393.

Translation: Just as1 a eKing2 acts according to his will3, so4 does the fDasturān Dastur5 by means8 of righteousness6 getc.7 (acts according to his own will). The gift10 of Vohu-manah9-11 (i.e. Good mind) is for those working12 for Hormazd14 of this world;13 he who18 hconstitutes himself20 to the protector21 (or the nourisher)21 iof the poor19 (accepts) the sovereign rule15 (of the entire world) (as it were) of Hormazd16.
Explanation:- Both, the Sovereign King ruling over the countries and the Pontiff of the Religion are of the same Status and worthy of respect. Those who are performing good deeds for pleasing Hormazd attain Heaven after death. He who gives help unto the poor virtuous brothers, regards, as it were, Hormazd as the Lord of the entire world.

d As regards Ahunavar it is stated in Yasna Hā XIX that the Creator Hormazd had created the hymn Ahuna Vairya prior to the creation of the sky and the world. Moreover, in the very same Hā it is further stated that he who recites the Ahunavar prayer in the proper metre with full comprehension and intoned without interruption and without omission attains to such meritorious deeds equivalent to hundred other holy chants. It is enjoined to chant this most ancient and excellent prayer of the Avesta in the proper metre with proper intonation and for this verb employed is Srāvaya (Skt. Srāvaya), i.e. to chant. This mantra consists of three lines in poetic form. First line ends at hachā, the second at Mazdā and the third line ends at Vāstārem. Moreover this Ahunavar consists of 21 words corresponding to the 21 Nasks of the original Avesta texts, most of which has been destroyed. We get the contents of each of these twenty-one Nasks from Pahlavi and Persian books. The detailed account of these is given in Pahlavi Denkart Book VIII and IX. In addition to all the matters pertaining to Religion these Nasks contain subject-matters relating to philosophy, medicine, ethics, astronomy, and astrology and all other sciences. For the beauty and excellence of this poetical prayer Ahunavar, see the translation of Srosh Yasht Hādhokht Kardāh I in this book; for further information see the explanation given under the translation of Ahunem Vairim tanum pāiti in Srosh Bāz Prayer. e Original meaning “The Lord who looks after worldly affairs.” f Original meaning “The Lord who looks after religious affairs.” g Righteousness etc. mean righteousness and other virtues associated with it.
h Original meaning “appoints himself” “settles himself”. The last line of Ahunavar resembles to some extent to the last line of Yasna Hā 53, Stanza 9. i The Latin and English equivalent for Avesta word Vāstār is pastor.



NIRANG-I-GOMEZ MĀLIDAN 3
Hormazd12 pirozgar13 pāk;14 ashaone Ashem Vohū 1. (To be recited thrice).
Note: After having recited this Nirang three times one should recite Srosh Bāz, and whilst reciting five Ahunavar one should apply nirang or bull’s urine at every Ahunavar to the right and left hand, to the face, to the right and left leg respectively. One should perform then Pādyāb-Kusti after completing the Srosh Bāz.
Translation: (May) the Satan3 (be) defeated1 and destroyed2! (may) the works and workers6 of Ahriman4 the accursed (be) destroyed5! may not7 works and workers9 of (that) accursed (Ahriman)8 reach7 (me)! Thirty-three10 Holy Immortals (Ameshaspands)11 and the Creator Hormazd12 are victorious18 and holy.14
Explanation: This Nirang seems to have been composed at a later period, as its language is Persian. Moreover it is surprising that the number of Ameshāspands mentioned in this Nirang is thirty-three. Perhaps the motive of the composer of this Nirang is to regard thirty-three Ameshāspands as thirty-three angels. According to the ancient books of our religion Ameshāspands are six in number and Ahura Mazda is counted as the seventh. It is clearly stated in the Pahlavi Nām Setāyeshne incorporated in the Denkart that the Creator Hormazd created six Ameshāspands. In the portion of “Nipāyōish Mashim” occurring in Hormazd Yasht the Creator Hormazd speaks to the prophet Zarathushtra thus: “I created six Ameshāspands from Bahman to Amurdād.” In the introductory portions of the Hormazd Yasht and Ardibehesht Yasht the Creator Hormazd Himself referring to Ameshāspands says thus: “We Ameshāspands”. In the Haftan Yasht (small) para 12 there occurs a reference to “Seven Ameshāspands”.

j This entire hymn Kem-nā-Mazdā is made up of four parts. They are as under:- (1) The first portion consisting of lines 1-5 from the beginning to the word frāvaochā is taken from Gatha Ushtvaiti-Yasna Hā 46.7 known as “Kām Nemōi Zām”. (2) The second part commencing from Kē verethrem-jā to the words vashi kahmāi-chit is borrowed from Yasna Hā 44, Known as Tatthwā-peresā stanza 16, (3) The third part beginning from pāta-nō tbishyantat up to the words Astvaitish ashahe is taken from Vendidad fargard VIII para 21. (4) The fourth part viz. nemaschā yā Armaitish izhāchā is taken from the Gātha Spentā Mainyu Hā 49.10.

Explanation: O Hormazd! When wicked persons torment me and my followers, who is our protector from such a torment? There is none other than Thee, who will grant family happiness and peace of mind. The possession of body and mind in healthy condition increases righteousness. There is no protector other than Thee, O Hormazd! do Thou evoke, give rise to such a thought in my mind so that I may get courage and strength in executing any work.

q This prayer from its beginning to the words “Pa sē gavashni pa patet hom” is in Pazend language; the remaining final portion is in Avesta.
r There is a custom amongst some of our Zoroastrians to utter “awākhsh Pashemān” whilst showing contempt of certain matter or whilst manifesting a thought of such significance as, may God keep one away from such immoral actions, or whilst repenting and atoning for any unworthy and wicked deeds which have been committed. Its meaning is “I return having repented, keep myself away having regretted”. These word are of Pazend language. s The meaning of avādashān can be “wicked ruler.”
t Kīks i.e. those who have eyes but would not see; karaps i.e. those who have ears but would not hear; its significance is, that they are neither paying attention to nor acknowledging the doctrines of the holy Zoroastrian Religion. For them words employed in Avesta are Kaoyām and Karafnāmcha; see Hormazd Yasht, para 10.
u Āshmog, i.e. distorters of truth and expounders of falsehood. For it there is an Avesta word Ashemaogha; see Ardibehesht Yasht para 7.

Explanation: Hormazd is the Creator of the entire world and is the ruler over it, there is none equal to Him. May Ahriman and all his daevas, drujas, sorcerers, tyrants, etc., be shattered, smitten and defeated! O Holy Protector! For whatever sins have been committed by me. For whatever wicked thoughts I have harboured for whatever wicked word I have spoken and for whatever wicked actions I have done or have been executed by me unknowingly - for all these types of sins I sincerely repent and atone for.

I praise12 the true-conceived13 thought,14 I praise15 the truespoken16 word,17 I praise18 the well-done19 deed.20 I praise21 the excellent23 religion22 of Mazda-worship,24 (which is) quarrel-removing,25 weapon-lowering,26 self-dedicating27 (and) holy,28 which29 of those that are30 and of those shall be31 (hereafter) (is) the greatest,32 and the best33 and the most excellent,34 which35 is the religion of Ahura36 revealed-by-Zarathushtra.37 I acknowledge41 all39 good40 (things) (which are) from Hormazd.38 Such42
v Here Ahriman stands in opposition to Hormazd. This idea should be understood of later period of Avesta. In the ancient period of the Avesta, i.e. during the period when the Gathas were com posed, Hormazd has been regarded as the Creator of the entire world and its destroyer. He has no rival, but under His sovereignty Spenā mino and Angra mino carry out some work pertaining to this world.
w The entire passage except the words Jasa me avanghe Mazda is taken from Yasna Hā XII. This Yasna Hā XII is the Zoroastrian Creed. See the Zoroastrian creed (in Avesta) in this book. The words Jasa me avanghe Mazda occur in Hormazd Yasht, para 27.



JASA ME AVANGHE MAZDA 7
is43 the praise46 of the religion44 of Mazda-worship.45
Explanation: Some essential features of the Mazda-worshipping Religion are noticed from the above passage. Besides this, many other excellent features of this pure religion we find in Vendidad, Yazishna and Vispered as well. In the Vendidad fargard V paras 22-24 it is stated that just as the sea Vouru-Kasha is greatest of all other seas and just as the great tree overshadows other small plants and just as the sky encompasses the entire earth around, in the same way Zoroastrian Religion in its greatness, goodness and excellence, covers all other religions. See Yasna Hā 44, stanza 10.

y The original meaning of ashem is equivalent to Persian ārd i.e. flour, powder. In such a meaning this word occurs in Vendidad Fargard V as regards the treatment of a woman who has been delivered of a still-born child.
z In the Persian Rivayets of Darab Hormazdyār these Persian words “gunesh shekasteh sad hazār bār” is not written for recital; but in it is mentioned to recite only one Yathā ahū Vairyō instead, whilst passing urine or answering the call of nature.

af Note that from Roz Hormazd Month Awān up to Gatha Vahishtoisht Rapithwan Gāh is not recited, but in its stead there is Second Hāvan. During this period in the Khshuman of all prayers, Rapithwan Gāh is not recited, but it is enjoined to recite Hāvan Gāh. For the remaining seven months i.e. from Roz Hormazd Māh Fravardin up to Roz Aneran Māh Meher, five Gāhs are re cited. The reason is that during these five months (according to original correct calculation) of winter, hours during the day-time are shorter than those of the summer months. Moreover, during winter there is less heat during noon-time. The Gāh pertaining to summer-season (Rapithwan) therefore is discarded. About these winter days in the Persian Rivayets it is figuratively written that heat during those days is buried underneath the earth.
ag The portion from “pa nāme yazdān” up to “pa patet hom” is in Pazend language. Similarly it is to be understood in every Niyāyesh and Yasht.

ah “Fravarāne Mazdayasnō Zarathushtrish Vidaēvō Ahura-tkaeshō” is the shortest Zoroastrian Creed. This is a sort of a Creed as regards the kind of religion the reciter observes.
ai The word “dev” which is called “daeva” in the Avesta has four different meanings according to the opinion of Sheth Kharshedji Rustomji Cama, or in other words we learn of four types of dev from the Avesta: (1) daevas having the appearance of man; (2) daevas producing diseases; (3) immoral daevas (4) daevas decreasing prosperity: (1). These persons who produce wickedness by increasing diseases or by decreasing prosperity or by ruining morality, are called the daevas having the appearance of men; e.g. Zohak, wicked people of Gilān and Māzandarān, etc. (2). Those who emit diseases and untimely death by whatever means or objects are also called “daevas,” e.g. a statement is made in Vendidad frakart VII about some daevas residing in the tombs. Here the meaning of daeva is to be understood as impure. They produce diseases while coming out of the tombs. (3). Whatever incites us to follow the path of wickedness is also termed “daeva”, e.g., slander, deceit, heresy, evil eye, impurity, etc. (4). Whatever causes disturbance in the spread of prosperity is also known by the term daeva, e.g. the demon Apaosha prevents rain i.e. the causes responsible for the prevention of rain are known by the name “apaosha”. Excessive cold is regarded as the queen of demons. See Sheth K.R. Cama “Zarthosht Nāmu” VI... “Who is daeva”.

Explanation: The words from “Yathā Ahū Vairyō Zaotā” up to “vidhvāo mraotu” which are recited in every Niyāyesh, Gāh and Yasht after “fravarāne mazdayasnō” are borrowed from the yasna. Rāspi, i.e. the assistant priest sitting opposite the Zaotar, addresses him thus: “Yathā Ahū Vairyō zaotā frā me mrute” implying that Zaotar may explain the excellences of “Yathā Ahū Vairyō” and the Religion of Zarathushtra to him. The Zaotar then replies. The Rāspi after having fully comprehending the excellencies and grasping the essence of the Religion of Zarathushtra would now put them into practice and expound them to others.

Explanation: The significance of Ahunavar. To understand the verse of Yathā Ahū Vairyō. By remembering the Creator Hormazd, by keeping full faith in the verse of Ahunavar, by chanting and reciting it properly, we become powerful and to some extent we get strength to avoid the difficulty or impending calamity. Regarding the efficacious excellence of Ahunavar we get some explanation from the beginning portion of Vendidad XIX fargard and from the first Kardāh of Srosh Yasht Hādhokt. In the Vendidad fargard XIX it is stated that when Ahriman and the entire army of daevas and drujas came to kill the holy Zarathushtra, amongst the remedies applied by the holy prophet in order to destroy them, the foremost was that he recited and chanted aloud the most powerful verse of Ahunavar. Besides, some Zoroastrians while commencing any work or during any calamity say, “Athā thy help”, “athā” is originally “Yathā” and “Yathā” is the first word of “Yathā Ahū vairyō”.

bg The portion beginning from “satāyem zbāyem” up to “Ādel pādashāhi bizavāl bāshad” appears to be a later addition because in the beginning of every Nyāyesh and Yasht there occurs in this way “Pa nāme yazdān Hormazd Khodāe awzuni gorje khoreh awazāyād”, but in this place after adding some epithets of the Creator Hormazd there occurs “Hormazd Khodāe Awazūni”, etc. Another reason is that in the portion beginning with “Satāyem zbāyem” up to “Ādel pādashāhi bīzavāl bāshad” some Arabic words occur, such as, khāleke makhluk, ar-razzāk kāder, etc., which do not occur in the Pazend introduction of other Avestan texts.

bw Tishtar is the name of the most brilliant star in the constellation Canis Major in the East. This star is compared to Sirius or Dog Star in English.
bx The meaning of “those related to star Tishtar” is, other stars associated with Tishtar, i.e. all other stars of the same constellation in which Tishtar (Sirius) comes. This constellation is called Canis Major. “Rains produced by Tishtrya” (Darmesteter).
by Vanant is, the central star in the West and the most brilliant. This star Fomalhaut are gener ally regarded as the same. It is called the opponent of the planet Jupiter. bz or steadfast, of straight forward morals (khvā+ stāiti).
ca Avesta word Sura as compared with Sanskrit shula is translated by me as “weapon”. According to my view, a reference here is made about the weapon of Meher yazad or Srosh yazad. In its corroboration we get actual Avestan writing from other places. In para 96 of the Meher yasht it is stated that, in order to smite the wicked and the sinful persons, Meher yazata keeps a heavy mace in his hand. Moreover, it is stated in karda 12 of Srosh yasht large and in para 15 of Vendidad 8 fargard 19, that Srosh yazata keeps a powerful weapon in his hands for smiting the skulls of demons. The original meaning of Zarenumantem is “wrathful” and I have derived the meaning “terrible, horrible” from it. Avesta word Zarenu = (German) Zorn = wrath, anger.
cb Fravashi and soul are two quite different things, they are not one and the same as most of our Zoroastrians think. This will be clearly seen from this paragraph as well as from para 149 of Fravartin yasht and from yasna Hās 26 and 55 respectively. Fravashi, i.e. a spiritual element showing the path of goodness and heaven to the soul about Fravashi in the Avesta it is mentioned that the Fravashis of all living beings, of those dead and those that shall be born hereafter, are different and varied. In support thereof see yasna Hā 24, para 5. Moreover, another meaning of “Fravashi”, (similar to English Prototype), is also “Original specimen, original form, original root” of anything, e.g. the Fravashi of trees and plants is its root, seed. There is a spiritual ele ment in the body of man which is responsible in the world beyond, for good or bad deeds done by him in this world; its name is “soul”. The soul attains heaven or hell in accordance with the deeds done by it in the world, see my translation of Vendidad, fargard 19, paras 27-32.

Explanation: In order to reach the earth the light of the Sun and the Moon it is necessary to have air and “ether”. Without air and ether the light of the Sun and Moon cannot fall on this earth. Mithra, i.e. Meher, means the light; “Ram Khvāstar” is equivalent to “ether” and “Vayu uparō-kairyō” is the wind, air between the sky and the earth. Like the close relationship of light, air and ether, we find in the Avesta, allegorically, yazatas; it is the Khshnuman or propitiatory formula of Mithra, i.e. Meher yazad. “Rām Khvāstar” is associated with Meher
cc For its explanation, see Srosh Bāz, page 16.
cd The portion from here up to the word, “Yasnemcha” is taken from the Khorshed Yasht. It is noticed that this entire Yasht and various paragraphs of Yasna, as mentioned above, are incorporated in the Khorshed Nyāyesh.
ce Taking hvare-raokhshni as a compound, if the reading according to Geldner, “hvare raokhshne” is taken, it means, “When the Sun warms with its light”.
cf In the original Avesta this word is found as dative singular (tongue), its original meaning is the body. Darmesteter translates, “germs”.



KHORSHED NYĀYESH 23
yazad. Moreover, there occurs, “Rām Khvāstar” in the “Khshnuman” of Mino Rām. Besides, in the Khshnuman of Mino Rām there occurs “Vayu uparokairya” along with “Rām Khvāstar”. As per this allegory “Rām Khvāstar” and “Vayu uparō-kairya” and other yazatas stand to help the light of the Sun and the Moon to reach the earth. Without the help of these angels, natural light cannot fall upon the earth.

cg All living things of this world enjoy their existence from the light of the Sun. Without it man, animal, bird, tree, etc., cannot subsist. Here the meaning of the word, “daevas”, as mentioned in the notes is “Srosh Bāz”, pp. 15-16, should be understood as “foul air, miasma, producing plague, means of disturbing prosperity”.
ch According to Avestan writing, the entire Universe is divided into seven regions which are called “Keshvar”. Their names are:-(l) Arezahi (to the West), (2) Savahi (to the East), (3) fradadafshu (to the South-West), (4) vidadafshu, (to the south-east), (5) Vouru-bareshti (to the North-West), (6) Vouru-Jareshti (to the North-East), (7) Khvaniratha (in the centre of the abovementioned six regions). Moreover, this last region called “Khvaniratha”, is stated to be the largest and most splendid of all other regions. Even at present we call the entire universe as, “Hafte Keshvar Zamin”.
ci or the power of repelling (the daevas) (Sanskrit pratishthā). Darmesteter translates the word by, “cannot withstand the daevas and oppose them.”
cj Dr. Geldner from here up to “urvānem” takes as a poem of three lines, each line begins with “yazaite”.

ck If the meaning of Meher is taken as light, origin of light, body of light, as stated previously the significance of “the ponderous mace of Meher yazata for smiting the skulls of Demons” is to be understood figuratively as sharp rays of the Sun for destroying disease and plague-producing foul air. The meaning of Daeva in this place, as explained in the notes on pages 15-16 can be taken as “foul air”. Whatever foul air is accumulated owing to the absence of the Sun during the whole night, is destroyed by its brilliant light after the sunrise.

of the Haoma-ceremony1), (coworship the Sun) with milk,2 Baresman,3 skill of tongue,4 with the Holy Spell,5 and with (good) word,6 (good) deed,7 oblations8 (offerings) and rightly spoken9 words.10
Explanation: (From the writings of the Avesta we have seen that the ceremonies of Haoma and Baresman, which are current at present in our holy Religion, were from the very ancient times, even prior to the advent of Zarathushtra. In the yasna Hā 9 (Havanim) it is stated that Vivanghāne, the father of King Jamshid; Āthawyan, the father of Faredoon; Asrat, the father of Keresasp, and Pourushaspa, the father of the Prophet Zarathushtra, performed the Haoma ceremony. Haoma twigs (Sanskrit Soma) are the twigs of a plant. These twigs are brought from Iran where they grow in large quantities. As a rule, fresh and green Haoma twigs should be used in the ceremonial act so that while pounding in the mortar (Hāvanim) juice will come out. These Haoma twigs should be regarded as strength giving and healthy medicine like several tonics used at present. We get the description of its excellence from Yasna Hā 9 and 10. In ancient times, prior to the advent of Zarathushtra, there existed a prophet by name Haoma, the discoverer of the method of extracting the Haoma-juice by pounding the Haoma twigs and of the introduction of the Haoma cult.
Like Haoma, the baresman, too, are the twigs of a certain kind of tree. This tree grows in Iran. Each twig is known as “Tāy”. Nowadays, brass or silver wires are used in place of the original baresman twigs in our ceremonies. The number of these wires is not always used uniformly, but it varies ac cording to the ceremony to be performed. It is not positively known who founded the baresman ceremony, but its ceremony, too, like the cult of Haoma is most ancient and this is ascertained from the Rām Yasht. In the second “kardāh” of this yasht it is stated that King Hoshang of the Pishdadian Dynasty worshipped Mino Rām yazata by means of Baresman on the Mount Alborz. In the first “kardāh” of Srosh Yasht Vadi (Large) it is stated that Srosh yazata was the first to worship the Creator, Ahura Mazda, by means of Baresman.
With some special process and by reciting certain sacred verses of the Avesta, in the yazishn Gāh (Gāh = place), the priest (yaozdāthregar) draws milk from the she-goat in the purified goblet which is called “Jivām”.

co The above verb, “yazamaide” should be taken here again. “Haomayō” is first person plural of the word “haomi” (the performer of Haoma Ceremony). If the words “haoma yo” are taken separately they can be translated as: (We worship the Sun) with Haoma which is with milk (and) barsam (and that Haoma) which is with the thought, word and deed, with the skill of the tongue, and (with that Haoma which is prepared) with rightly spoken words9 for the ceremonial oblation.8 cp For the explanation of Yenghe Hātām, see note p. 1.

(I begin to recite this) with1 (the help of) the name1 of the Almighty2 Hormazd,3 Lord4 (of the entire world) and the Increaser.5 May His grandeur6 and glory7 increase!8 May Meher yazata,9 the Lord of wide pastures,10 the cyjust Judge11 come12 (to my help)!

cx There are various meanings of the word Meher, who is called in Avesta “Mithra” light, origin of light, the harbinger of the Sun, twilight; a contract, promise, an agreement, truth, justice, friendship, love; the yazata presiding over light and truthfulness; the yazata helping the just and virtuous persons and punishing the liar and wicked persons; the judge at the Chinvat Bridge of the souls of the dead. We have the full details about the functions of Meher Yazata and his praise from the Meher Yasht. In former times the worship of Meher yazata was spread more than that of the other yazatas. Some hint about it is seen from the later portion of Meher Nyāyesh and Meher Yasht. For further details, see a booklet in English on “A Lecture on Mithraic Worship”, by Sheth Kharshedji Rustomji Kama.
cy Meher yazata is called the just Judge. Its reason is that after the passing away of a person he proceeds towards the Chinvat Bridge on the fourth day at dawn, where Meher Yazata, Srosh Yazata and Rashne Yazata, after weighing all the actions committed by him in this world, assign him the proper place (Heaven, purgatory or hell).

Explanation: (The purport is that virtuous and benevolent deeds are orginated by men of good intelligence, but a man of wicked intelligence performs wicked deeds. The end of a good, virtuous and religious man is good. To such a person, during his own life-time as well as at the time of death, there arises a great satisfaction that he spent his life in causing prosperity to the world, in doing good to his own companions and, in rendering help to the poor and needy persons. On the other hand, he who commits sinful, immoral deeds suffers the punsihment of hell, (see my Yasht Bā Maeni, fargard II and III of Hadokht Nask).

dt i.e. most invisible - that can never be seen by anyone. There is no word avanīd in the Pahlavi Nām Setāyeshne found in Dinkard. Instead of avanīd, va dād (meaning, and gave) is found in the Nām Setāyeshne, in the prayer book of the Kadimi Sect. Having derived the word avanīd from a = a, i.e. to, towards and root van = to vanquish and applied to Hormazd, it can mean “destroyer”, “bringer of the end”.
du In this para after “roshan behesht garothmān” every word has “o” and its meaning is “and, as well as”. According to the rule of the Gujarati language, I have not inserted “and” after every word, but I have inserted “and” before the last word (men). dv Originally this word is in the imperfect tense. dw The Word “Dev” has been explained earlier.

(2) (The Creator) Ahura Mazda2 spoke1 unto eySpitamān3 Zartosht4:
O Spitamān8 Zartosht!9 Mayest thou praise5 her7 who10 is My6 Ardvi Sura11 the undefiled,12 wide-flowing,13 health-giving14 (River), opposed15 to the ezDemons; faacting16 according to the Law of Ahura Mazda, worthy of worship17 for the people18 of the material19 world, worthy of prayer20 for the people21 of the corporeal22 world, life (or vivacity) increasing,23 righteous,24 fbherd-increasing,25 righteous,26 fcrendering the world prosperous,27 holy,28 wealth-increasing,29 and rendering the countries prosperous,31 the righteous32 (Ardvi Sura of these characteristics).
Explanation:- Ardvi Sura is the name of the river flowing from certain quarters of the provinces of Ancient Iran. This river was longer and broader than all other rivers known at that period. It is compared with the River Āmu or the Oxus. The source of the present Oxus River is from the Pamir mountains. The Mount Hukairya is known as the source of Ardvi Sura. This river was not only praised in the whole of Iran from very ancient times, but was well known in certain parts of Europe and many other places. In later times it was recognised widely, and the angel Anahita presided over it. As mentioned in the Seventh fargard of the Vendidad, its original name is “Ardvi”. The description of this river, as seen in the Pahlavi Books is derived from the Ardvi Sura (or Āvān) Yasht. According to the description in the Pahlavi Book called Dadistan i Denik, this Ardvi Sura River, where the tree called, “Harvisp-Tokhmi” is situated, and where all kinds of trees and various medicinal plants are found, mingled with the source of the trees mentioned above and, with the fallen branches etc., spreads her water to all other places. On account of this, too, the water of this river is considered

ey “Spitama” was the illustrious name of the ancestor of the ninth generation of the Prophet Za rathushtra. From this, Holy Zarathushtra is known as pertaining to the family of Spitama or Spitaman Zartosht.

Explanation:- (in this paragraph some excellent properties of the water of Ardvi Sura are mentioned). Its original significance is, that in the waters of this river there was the quality of purifying the blood, and of giving strength to the body, like a tonic, for digesting the food easily. For older people fresh air and pure water are very important, to obtain sound health and good digestion.

fr Staota yasnya - is the Avestan name of one of the 21 Nasks of our Holy religion. In Pahlavi it is called “Satud yasht”. Its praise is mentioned in Yazishna hā 71. The literal meaning of “Staota yasnya” is “praise-worthy of Yazishna”. Generally this name is applied to the Hās (or Chapters) of the Five Gathas and Seven Hās (or Chapters) of the Yasna Haptanghāiti. fs Original meaning, “in good intonation,” (locative singular of husravan.)

gb About this Fire it is stated in the commentary of the Pahlavi version that it presides over the Mobeds, Dastoors and saintly persons. It is also called “Adar Farāh”. In the Pahlavi Book Bundahishn it is stated that this Fire was first enthroned on the Mount, “Gadman-Homand” situated in the province of “Khvārzam” on the shores of the River Oxus. After the death of king Jamshid, it was saved from the clutches of Zohāk. During the time of king Gushtāsp it was removed from the Khvārzam, and brought to the Mount, “Roshan” situated in Kabulastan, where this very Fire was existing up to the period of Bundahishn.

gd In the Pahlavi Commentary the King Kaikhusrou, after conquering “Beheman Diz” enthroned this Fire. It presides over the heroes and soldiers. It is also known as the Fire of Lightning. ge In the Pahlavi Commentary. gf i.e., of that lake where king Kaikhusrou prayed standing.
gg It was the abode of the Fire, Ādar Gushasp enthroned by king Kaikhusrou on the Mount situated near the Lake Chaechast.
gh Some of our Dasturs have understood the “Chaechasta” as the name of the Cave, but it is the name of a lake, and not a cave. This fact is clearly seen from the Āvan Yasht, para 49; Gosh Yasht, para 18, and Ashishvangh Yasht para 38. For both these Avesta words, “Vairi” (i.e. lake) and “vara” (i.e. enclousure, cave) there is only one and the same equivalent “var” in Pahlavi; hence this seems to have been mistaken. According to the statement in Napekh-ut-tawārikh, King Kaikhushrou, till the time he passed away from this material world, was fully engrossed in the prayers of God on the Mount Nihāvand. The Lake Chaechasta is situated in Azarbaizān and at present it is compared with the Lake Urumiyah.
gi In the Pahlavi Commentary this Fire presides over Vāstryosh, i.e. agriculturists, and “Adar Burzin Meher” is also known as “Adar Meher Burzin”. About this Fire it is stated in the Pahlavi Bundahishn and Persian Rivayets that Holy Zarathushtra brought this Fire in the court of King Gushtasp, and its excellence was that the Fire was always kept buring bright without fuel, san dalwood and frankincense, incense, and was not extinguished by anything. gj There was the place for the Fire “Ādar Burzin” on this Mount.
gk Fire is powerful weapon against the demons, impurity, uncleanness, etc. Besides, the persian Rivayets we get such writing in the Avesta itself; see Vendidad, Fargard VIII. para 80.
gl Neryosang is the name of the Fire as well as an Angel. As Fire, it resides in the heart of kings and assists them in the management of their state. As an Angel, he is the Messenger of the Creator, Ahura Mazda.

The words “thrishum asnāmcha khshafnāmcha” seems to be a commentary of “akhvafnyām”. Watergaard has inserted these words in ( ) and Geldner has taken them in footnotes. gq “Quick to rise up from bed” (Darmesteter): “ Speed in walking “ (Harlez). gr Sovereignty, Empire (Prof. Darmesteter); one’s own country (Dr. Harlez)

ha The significance of the sentence “fuel examined in the light and purified” is that the fuel is selected after examining in the light and after removing the bark wherein small insects and polluted things may not be covered. The fuel, sandalwood and any other incense which may be put on fire should be absolutely dry and cleansed. Any kind of wet and dirty fuel should never be put on the fire.

iv This whole Patet is in Pazend language. Of these some subject matters are taken from Avesta and some from Pahlavi Books.
iw From this it appears that the sinner confesses his own sins and makes suitable atonement in the presence of the High-priests fully-versed in the Zoroastrian Religion. After the composition of this Patet even from the Persian Rivayets written in later times similar writing is found, that a sinful person should confess his sins and atone in presence of the just, learned, well-versed person in Religion, in Dastur, of that period.

jh It is understood that the reciter of the Patet may be a man or a woman.
ji i.e. by treating unlawfully in any way with the above mentioned persons or by exercising oppression on them. jj See the translation at the end of the second Kardāh above.
jk Hair and nails removed from the body of a living person are called “heher” or dry dead mat ter. In Avesta it is called “hikhra”. The entire body of the dead or any part of it is called “dead matter” or “wet dead matter”. The original meaning of “Nasā” is “corpse”, “carrion”, “contaminated thing.” The word is derived from root nas (Sanskrit nash - to destroy). jl In the Pahlavi commentary. jm In the Pahlavi commentary: i.e. not to bury lawfully in the earth.
jn The matter contained in this fifth kardāh is also found in Avesta itself. In Vendidad, to eat dead matter or to throw it in water or in fire is strictly forbidden. The person performing such an act is regarded as impure till the end of his life. Never throw dry dead matter (nasā) in water or in fire: not only that but if we notice it fallen in water or in fire, it should betaken out immediately, (see Vendidad fargard VI, paras 26-29; frakart VII, paras 23-27; frakart VIII, paras 73-82). After removing hair or nail from the body, they are not to be scattered but they are to be buried in a separate place after digging a pit. (For further details, see Vendidad fargard XVII).

jq The significance of sins committed against Fire is that it was not kept burning by feeding fuel, sandalwood, incense from time to time, with care and precaution, but was allowed to extinguish or was placed on a dirty and defiled place, or some dry dead matter (nasa) was thrown on it. A strict prohibitive order as regards this is enjoined in our holy Avesta. Various kinds of Fires are referred to here, and its significance seems to be an indication about various professional fires, e.g., fire of the blacksmith, fire of the potter, fire of the factory, fire of the bakers, etc. The writing about this is given in Vendidad, Fargard VIII, see paragraphs 81-96.
jr The import of the sins committed against metals is this: metallic utensils have to be kept clean, and not allowed to remain dirty or rusty. Health is spoiled by eating the food kept in dirty and rusty utensils. If we examine minutely the commandments of the Zoroastrian Religion, its original aim is to make the world prosperous, by means producing diseases and plagues and taking care of the health. It is enjoined to keep the health free from unhealthy and to apply suitable remedies before and after the deterioration takes place. This is ordained to be the most important duty amongst other duties. By not fulfilling this we stand as sinners in the eyes of the Creator, Hormazd.

ke i.e. whatever atonement and punishment is to be borne for not acting according to the orders of the Religion.
kf In the Pahlavi commentary, for the explanation about this, see my Yasht Bā Māeni, Hādokht Nask, Fargard III. kg i.e. whereby my life be pleased by doing truthful and virtuous deeds.
kh i.e. the yazishn in honour of Srosh for three days. According to the Religion of Zarathushtra, for three days after the death of a person, the soul hovers about the same place where the body was laid after necessary ceremonies and on the dawn of the fourth day after death, it goes towards the Chinvat Bridge. For these three days the soul remains under the protection of Holy Srosh yazata it is enjoyed: therefore, to consecrate the yasna with the Khshnuinan of Srosh for the dead person. For these three days the soul remembers all good or wicked deeds performed during his lifetime, and thinks of the place he will get in the next world. To the soul of the righteous man immense joy arises in the hope of gaining the reward of his goodness during that period and the soul of the wicked gets frightened with fear of being punished for his wicked actions.

On the dawn of the fourth day the soul goes towards the Chinvat Bridge, where Meher yazata, Srosh yazata and Rashna yazata, the most just, assign to him the proper place (Heaven, Purgat ory or Hell) after weighing all the deeds done in this world. For further details about this, see my translation of Vendidad 19 fargard, paras 27-32 and its explanation; and my Yasht Bā Māeni, Yasht 22.
ki i.e. on these three ceremonies I have my full faith, and I order to perform them in my name after my death.
kj Getikharid. The original meaning of the word getikharid is “to purchase this world”, i.e. to acquire meritorious deeds from this world, so that after death the soul may get happiness and comfort. But generally to have performed this act of getikharid, means to consecrate the yasna in honour of the soul of the dead for nine days. Like the Zindeh-ravān ceremony this ceremony can also be performed for living persons. We find such a writing in the later books on the Zoroastrian Religion.
kk If anyone recites the Patet for the dead person, the words falān “jādehrā” may be added after each “hvarsht” and “duzhvarsht” words: i.e. the name of the person in whose honour the Patet is performed should be uttered with “jādehrā”. The original meaning of the word “jādeh” is “open road” and from that it means “salvation, release”.

Explanation:- The above-mentioned names of the Five Gatha-Gahambars are derived from the names of the Gathas of Zarathushtra. When five days were added to 360 days of the year, names of any five best things from amongst the Zoroastrians were discovered which could only be applied to these additional five days. As they could not find more revered names except the names of the Five Gathas of Zarathushtra, they were assigned to these five days.lp Besides, these five Gatha Gāhāmbārs are known by more names than one:-(1) Panje Andarangān, i.e. five intermediate days, i.e. five days between the last month of a year and the first month of the year after that. (2) Panje Meh, i.e. understood as five big days. Out of the ten days of the Fravartikān the first five days are regarded as Panje Keh, and the other five days, i.e. five days of the Gathas as greater. (3) Panje ashoān, i.e. the last five days of coming of the Fravashis of the righteous people in this world.

1. Maediozarem. 2. Maedioshahem 3. Paeteshahem. 4. Ayāthrem. 5. Maedīārem. 6. Hamaspathmaedaem.
(Note: The explanation of the above mentioned Gāhāmbārs and their seasons according to Avesta are to be understood as under:-)
1. Maedīozarem - This Gāhāmbār or Seasonal Festival begins with the Roz Khorshed of the Month Ardibehesht and ends with the Roz Dae Pa Meher. The meaning of this word is “full verdure” or “the period of mid-spring”. On the occasion of this Gāhāmbār fertility or essence in the trees and plants is on the increase.
2. Maedīoshahem - This Gāhāmbār or (Seasonal Festival) begins with the Roz Khorshed of the Month Tir and ends with the Roz Dae Pa Meher. The meaning of this word is “the period of Mid-Summer”. On the occasion of this Gāhāmbār the fields or farms are full of corns.
3. Paeteshahem - This Gāhāmbār, Seasonal Festival, begins with the Roz
lp Zartoshti Abhyās, No. 11, pages 200-201.



98 KHORDEH AVESTA
Ashtad of the Month Sheherevar and ends with the Roz Anerān. The meaning of this word is “the harvest-season” During the departing summer corns and fruits are ripe and the period of gathering the harvest approaches. This period is called “Paeteshahem Gāhāmbār”.
4. Ayāthrem - This Gāhāmbār begins with the Roz Ashtād of the Month Meher and ends with the Roz Aneran. The exact meaning of this word has not been still ascertained. In its context in Yasna Hā 1, 2, and 3, as well as in Vispered Kardāh 1 and 2, words like “fraourvaēshtrem varshniharshta” occur. Dr. Spiegel translates these words as “increaser (and) strength-giver”. Sheth Kharshedji Rustamji Kamaji translated it, “bringing to an end (of summer), and the spender of the seed of males of the rutting season”, when the male animals are in heat; i.e. on the occasion of this Gāhāmbār the Summer would end. And the rutting season of some animals take place.
5. Maedīārem - This Gāhāmbār begins from the Roz Meher of the Month Dae and ends with the Roz Bahrām. It literally means the period of perfect rest owing to slack business and trade due to excessive cold and heavy rains.
6. Hamaspathmaedaem - This Gāhāmbār is the name of the five days of the Gatha Gāhāmbār immediately following the completion of the month Asfandārmad. The meaning of the word is “the equal proportion of heat and cold, and the division of 24 hours of the day into two equal parts of 12 hours.”

lt This Jashan was performed every four year with great pomp and splendour during the times of our Iranian Kings. According to the movement of the Sun, generally every year isof 365 1/4 days. (If calculated accurately, it is365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes and 49 seconds). For filling the gap owing to the diminution of 1/4 day every year, which comes to one full day at four years, our Zoroastrian ancestors used to add one day every four years after the completion of Five days of Gatha. The additional day was called “Avardād Sāl gāh”, on which one big Jashan ceremony was performed. Besides, in the Khshnuman, or propitiatory formula of this Jashan any special yazata was not worshipped, but, especially, all the divisions of the year used to be remembered. The significance of this Jashan can easily be noticed thereby, and its importance as the “Gatha of the year” gets fixed more and more. The meaning of “Gāh” in addition to “Gatha” is “time, period”, too). Owing to the discontinuance of the usage of adding the additional day at every four years, the Jashan is at present performed on the Roz Khordad of the Month Asfandarmad. For further details, see Zarthoshti Abhyas by Sheth K.R. Cama, pp. 523-528.
lu On this day, Holy Zarathushtra, in order to convince the truth of His Prophetship, demonstrated to King Gushtasp the validity of his Religion by performing miracles. lv “Khur” should be understood as “Khorshed”. lw “Ard” should be understood as Ashish, i.e. “Ashishvangh”. lx Ardāfravash should be understood as “Farvardin (the day of the holy Fravashis).

Explanation: Mānthra Spenta, i.e. beneficent or holy spell. The original meaning of mānthra (Sanskrit mantra) is “secret mysteries of the Zoroastrian
mc “Hameshtagehān” is known as a place between heaven and hell. For those persons whose good deeds and sins are equal, the fixed place in that world beyond is called, “hameshtagtehān”. According to the suggestion of Dr. Roth (as communicated by Darmesteter) reference to Hameshtagehān is found in the Gathas (in Yasna Hā 33.1), see my Gāthā Bā Māeni, yazishn Hā 33, Stanza 1 and its explanation. The original meaning of Hameshtagehān, which is called in Avesta “misvāna gātu” is the place of “mediocre profit”. These words occur in Vendidad fargard 19, para 36, and in the khshnuman of Mino Anerān. In this khshnuman, the word “Hameshtagehān” occurs along with “Endless Lights”, Garothmān Heaven and the Chinvat Bridge. Here the words, “misvanānhe gātvo khvadhātahe” presumably seems to have been added later on. Prof. Westergaard and Dr. Geldner have not given these words in the text in their Avestan Editions, but have taken them in the footnotes: Drs. Spiegel, Harlez and Darmesteter have therefore left these words untranslated. md Removing or dismissing (the wicked) thought, (Darmesteter).

A reference about this we find in Vispered Kardāh 13, first paragraph, thus: “Ashem vīspem mānthrem yazamaide: Zarathushtrem hadhamānthrem yazamaide”, i.e. we worship the entire mānthra as holy; we worship Zarathushtra who is one with mānthras or the composer of the mānthras. In several later books it is stated that some writings of the Prophet Zarathushtra were so mysterious that even the great sages could not comprehend their meaning. Moreover, many famous Persian writers call him, “Paegambare Ramz-gu” (i.e. Prophet who reveals the secrets). We have no certain evidence at present as to how many these mānthras were originally given by him.

ns The Mount “Ushi-Darena” is situated in the province of “Sajestan” in the Eastern direction of Iran, which is called in Avesta “Vaekereta”, and it was called by the ancient Greek people as “Drangiana”. In Pahlavi this Mount is known as “Hush-dāshtār”. The original meaning of this word is “keeper of intelligence”. This name was given for the reason that from that Mountain Holy Zarathushtra received the Divine intelligence; on that mountain the Holy Prophet conversed with Ahura Mazda as regards religious matters.

nt This paragraph is complicated. Instead of “upa thwā azem maire anudadhayāt”, Prof. Darmesteter approving the reading “Zamerena duye” given in the footnote translates as under; “O sinner!

nv The name of “Asmo-khvanvant” comes first amongst those famous men and women whose Fravashis are revered in the Fravartin yasht, kardas 25-27. Prof. Darmesteter regards this personage as one of the first disciples of the Prophet Zarathushtra.

on The original meaning of “aspō kehrpem” is the “shape of a horse”, see Tir yasht, karda 5, para 8.
oo The translation of this entire Karda does not seem to me to be satisfactory. A better transla tion than this should be made. I could not translate the portion from “ ātare vitare” up to “aojangha” of paras 13-14.
op Eight kardas of this yasht are taken from yasna Hā 35 to Hā 42. This part is called “Yasna Haptanghāiti”; and it is believed that this part is written between the age of the Gathas and the yasna. Its composition is poetic prose. The meaning of “haptanghāiti” is seven Hās ( haptan + hāiti). Hā 42 seems to have been added as an appendix.
oq As it occurs in every Gatha, this paragraph of “humatanām” comes at the end of Kardāh 7 of the same yasht (which in fact should be at the end of this yasht); from this Prof. Darmesteter

Explanation: (Like the wind and the water, the fire also is a source of purification. Besides, the words “Fire” in English and, Pur in the Greek Language are derived from Sanskrit root pu=to purify).
oz The locative singular of the word mana becomes manaya, manayā (Gathic form).
pa Spiegel; Harlez also has translated more or less similarly. Prof. Darmesteter translates this para as:- O Ahura Mazda! Thy praise is superior to the praises of Asha. Vohu Manah and the Good Khshathra, rather superior to every (other) praise. The sacred verses which are addressed to Thee as an appeal are superior to all other sacred verses, and the gift which is dedicated to Thee is superior to all other gifts. pb This paragraph is quoted in Vendidad fargard 11, para 4. pc “Through the service of the fire”, (Spiegal and Harlez)
pd For better impression, the word “thee” seems to occur twice. Professor Darmesteter has referred the First “thee” to the visible Fire and the second “thee” to the spiritual fire in the proximity of the Creator Hormazd on the basis of the Pahlavi translation.
pe Sanskrit root dā means “to give”: Sanskrit ā-dā means “to take away, to remove”. “Thou (O Fire!) ill-treats him who ill treats the Fire”. (Darmesteter), “Who brings pollution to this (Thy flame) wilt Thou cover him with pollution (in your turn).” Dr. Geldner has taken “akhtōyōi” instead of “akhtōyō”.

pp By praising water and singing its excellence we acquire many advantages; for all living creatures water is the most essential thing. Reverend Mills has translated the various types of waters occurring in the third paragraph as under:- You that are showered down, you that stand in pools and vats38, you that bear forth (our loaded vessels)39, you that serve us all in helpful ways42, well-forded43, full flowing45, effective or effective for bathing”. For further details, see the note at the end of the translation of the fourth paragraph.
pq Sometimes in the Gathas as an honorific the pronoun for Ahura Mazda comes in plural in stead of in singular. Dr. Spiegel and Prof. Harlez apply the word “vao” (= you) to the water.
pr I do not understand the portion from “apaschā vāo azishchā vāo” up to “mātarō jitayō”. Translation by others do not seem to me to be satisfactory. Prof. Darmesteter on the basis of the Pahlavi Bundahishn and from the standpoint of its translation given considers some words occurring in the third and fifth paragraphs of this Hā as seventeen kinds of waters and fluids in all; such as maēkaintishcha = waters or juices that are in the plants; hebavaintischa = water that flows from the mountains; fravazahghō = rain water; ahuranish = well water and still water, etc. The above meanings are not derived from Avestan words.

qv This prayer, Airyamana should be understood as the fifty-fourth Hā of the Yasna called “ Ā Airyema Ishyō”. When it is recited as a benediction to the married couple, only half the portion of the Hā is recited.

(But) he who heals by means of reciting the mānthra33 (is) the best amongst (all) the healers40, (because) from the inner part of that44 righteous46 man45 he cures49 (him). Amongst (all) the physicians53 he50 indeed51 is52 the best healer54.
Explanation:- The meanings of the word baēshaza occurring in this paragraph are “healer, curer, restorer to healthy condition by purifying the body and mind”. Such five types of healers are mentioned. First - one who heals by means of purificatory rites. He is to be regarded as the purifying priest, giving ablution to polluted persons and the giver of Barashnum, whose function is to give purification by driving away the pollution of the person. Second - one who heals by law and justice should be regarded as the Judge, whose function is to give justice as he deems fit, for both the plaintiff and the defendant, by giving proper decision to the matters in dispute. Third - the surgeon is the doctor who knows the work of surgery.
Fourth - one who restores to health by means of herbal medicines should be regarded as a physician, who by means of herbs or by means of drugs derived from various kinds of plants cures the ailing person. Fifth - one who heals by recitation of mānthra should be regarded as the physician giving peace and ease to the mind by certain fixed sacred verses of the Holy Avesta and giving comfort to the body. Moreover, of all the physicians, he who gives relief and peace of mind to the ailing person by reciting the holy spells is regarded as the greatest healer. The reason stated to be is that the person who purifies the inner part of the righteous man, brings comfort to his body and mind, and gives happiness by reciting near him, and explaining the

qx Here, the object of the verb “janaiti” is in the genitive plural. For destroying the malice of Angra Mainyu the prayer named Airyaman is the most effective weapon; so also the yazata called Airyaman. We find a reference about this in the Vendidad fargard XXII.

ra The prayer called “Asha Vahishta” should be regarded as Ashem Vohu. Through the charm of these prayers - Ashem Vohū, Yathā Ahū Vairyō and Yenghe hātām, i.e. by. the recitation of these prayers with proper understanding sincere heart, the influence of Ahriman, daevas-demons, dru jas and wicked men will vanish from the presence of the reciter. We find the writing of similar significance in yasna Hā 61 known as Ahunem Vairim. “Bagha Ashahe Vahishtahe” instead of “bagha Asha Vahishta” which is given by Prof. Westergaard in the footnote seems to be better. The meaning of “bagha” equivalent to Sanskrit “bhaga” is “divine power”: e.g. stārām baghō dātanām, i.e. of the stars created by the divine power (see Vendidad fargard XIX para 23). But in this place I have thought it proper to take the word “bagha” equivalent to Sanskrit bhāga meaning “portion” share, fortune. Similarly, for the piece of Ahunavar, the words “bagha Ahunahe Vairyehe” occur (see Yasna Hā XIX para 23). Moreover, the meaning of the phrase “āvōya me bagha” (which Ahriman speaks) can also be this: Woe unto my luck! In conformity with this the subject of the verbs “Janāt” and “Tbaēshayāt” can be “Asha Vahishta”. In lieu of “Āvōya me bagha” if we take “āvōya me bāvōya”, according to Dr. Geldner, its meaning than can be Woe unto me! Asha Vahista will smite the bringers of illness. Bāvoya, i.e. Woe!

Explanation:- (Its significance is, what is the difference between the paths of the virtuous, religious people and the sinful people?)
Then18 (the Creator) Ahura Mazda20 spoke19: If21 (any person) recites aloud24 My23 holy spell23 (and becomes) the memorizer25 or26 the reciter27 (of that Holy Spell), or28 whilst reciting30 draws32 “Kash”31 (or furrows)31, (that person) protects35 his own33 body34 (from the attacks of the demons and drujas and from the path of wickedness).

rj Darmesteter’s English translation; distress, calamity (Darmesteter’s French translation); from the demon called urvista (Justi); from every attack (Harlez).
rk Instead of the words from “Kāmchit” up to “airyābyō pādhaēibyō” in some former prayer books the text runs as under:- “hatarem haenem kāmchit thwāmcha drujemcha nōit vaināne humatem kāmchit thwamcha drujemcha arethaēibyō perethaēibyō”. This text Professor Westergaard and Dr. Geldner have given in the footnotes. The text which I have given above comes out quite similar in the modern prayer books.

(6) (The Creator Ahura Mazda speaks): I accept66 (the man who) draws65 three “Kash” (or furrows)64 as the righteous68 man67; I accept73 (the man who) draws71 six69 furrows70 as the righteous75 man74; I accept79 (the man who) draws77 nine furrows76 as rmthe perfectly78 righteous81 man80.
Explanation:- In this paragraph there occurs a subject regarding the drawing of “Kash” (the furrows). One should understand that he should not remain at ease after drawing the furrows only, but after this, certain ceremonies are enjoined to be performed, the details of which are not given here i.e. the act of operating the ceremony by drawing these furrows. Prior to performing the “Pav Mehel” ceremonies of the Zoroastrian Religion, a “Kash” or a circle is drawn round the place where that ceremony is performed; its significance is that during the performance of the ceremony no pollution, impurity or filth can exercise its evil influence over the place.

rp Instead of “Maremnāshaiti” I have kept the reading “marem nāshaiti” taking two words separately like Professor Justi. Mara + Sanskrit maraka - plague; Sanskrit nash = to perish.
rq For further explanation see Beherām yasht, para 46 and its footnote. The sentence from “Zarathushtra” up to “thrāyaona” also occurs in Beherām Yasht, Kardāh XVI. rr i.e. a boy having a brother or sister.
rs Perhaps “haosra” may be an abbreviation of “haosravangha” (= good renown). Possessing suitable qualities” (Professor Harlez); Professor Justi has not translated the word haosrō-gaonō”.
rt Persian word similar to “rāmaya” is “ram kardan” (i.e. to subdue). Taking “vīspa kareshō rādhayeiti” according to Dr. Geldner’s text, Professor Darmesteter translates “they spread peace and happiness in all the councils or assemblies”.

His opponent is the demon Apaosha (the demon of drought); see paras 20-21 of this yasht. Moreover, as a star he is compared with the Dog Star or Sirius. This entire paragraph is rather complicated. sd Shōithra = Skt. khshetra; any place. Its meaning is country also.

sm Kaeta = Vedic keta = wish; Besides if we compare kaeta with Sanskrit kita (=insects, worms), it can be translated as under: for whom (i.e. for the coming of the rains) insects become grieved (root drush) (because they will be destroyed).
sn Original meaning “going with anger” (Sanskrit Manyu “through the heavenly space” (Darmesteter).
so Professor Darmesteter gives the following explanation about the archer named Erekhsha:This person is known in the Pahlavi books as “Aresh Shivātir”. The Pahlavi word Eresh is of the Avesta, “Erekhsho”. Shivatir (or Shipāktir) is the Pahlavi translation of the Avesta Khshviwiishu (the swift archer). This person was the best archer in the Iranian army. When the Emperor Minocheher and Afrāsyāb determined to make peace and fix the boundary between Iran and Turan, it was stipulated that Erekhsha should ascend the Mount Khshutha (i.e. Damavand), and discharge an arrow towards the East; the place where the arrow would fall should form the boundary between the two kingdoms (Iran and Turān). Erekhsha shot an arrow accordingly the flight continued from dawn to noon, when the arrow fell on the Mount Khvanvant (i.e. Bāmyāna), from where a branch of the River Jihun (the River Balkha) starts. Later, the word Aresh was applied to the best archer. The meaning of “Tire Areshi” hence became, i.e. the best arrow.
sp Professor Darmesteter regards Khshutha as a part of the Mount Damāvand and supposes the Mount Khvanvant the same as the Mount Bāmyāna.

(2) (xgWe worship Dravāspa) who yokes teams of horses15, keeps the fastmoving chariot16, with resounding (or shining) wheels17, prosperity-giving18, pure19, powerful20, beautiful21, conferring benefit on one’s self22, healing23, xhstanding firm24, giving powerful support25 for the help26 of the righteous28 men27.
xc i.e. For the worship, etc., of the powerful and holy Dravāspa created by Ahura Mazda (see Khorshed Nyāyesh).
xd The original meaning of drvāspa (= drva + aspa) is “giving health to the horse”, hence the yazata giving health to all the animals; as his collaborator there occurs “Gēush urvan”, the meaning of which is the soul of the cattle, source, the “soul of the universe”. Moreover, the yazata Dravāspa is in the feminine gender like Āvan, Din, Ashishvangh. Dr. Haug from the last part of this paragraph compares “Dravāspa” with the Milky-way, thus: with many eyes (pouruspakhshtīm); with distant roads (durāt pathana), self-shining (khvāthravana) and with long constellation or with the cluster of stars (dareghō-hakhedh-rayana).
xe If we derive the word “urvathām” from the Sanskrit root vardh = to grow, then the meaning of “drvō urvathām” having followed by “r” and preceded by the redundant “u” becomes “urvadh” = urvath.
xf Or guarding fully from afar the roads, with comfortable, long-standing friendship. If we take this word “pouru-spakhshti” instead of “pouru-spakhshtīm” according to Geldner’s text and the last three words in the instrumental singular, then it can be translated as:- We worship Drav āspa giving health to children, who guards fully10 from afar” with wide12, long-standing friendship14 accompanied by happiness13. Original meaning is “with full watch”. xg Here “yazamaide” occurring in the first para is to be employed. xh From “drvō-stāiti” the Persian word “dorosta” (sound) is derived

yt Root khvidh = Sanskrit svid = to perspire, to sweat, to excite. This passage is rather obscure. I do not regard this translation quite satisfactory. European scholars having taken “ashtaaurvanta” as proper name have considered urvi-khaodho, urvi-varethra, stvi-manothri as epithets and have translated them as “having a projecting helmet”, having a projected shield and of thick neck or of big head. It is true that these words have these meanings. Prof. Darmesteter translates as follows:- “O Dravāspa! grant me this boon that I may put to flight Ashta-aurvant, the son of Vispa-thaurvō-asti, the all-afflicting, .... and the attacks of those seven hundred camels with plundered goods behind him”.

yu Prof. Darmesteter gives some explanation about this:- The Khvyaonas seem to have been the Chionitae, a bellicose tribe near the land of Gilan, often at war with the first Sassanides.
yv The name of the Varedhakas reminds one of the Vertae who are mentioned once in company with the Chionitae; but their geographical situation is not ascertained. In any case the proximity of the Daitya shows that both the people must have inhabited the Western Coast of the Caspian Sea.

(1) We praise9 the holy6 Srosh1 beautiful3, victorious4, bringing-prosperity to the world5 (and) righteous2, (who is) the lord8 of righteousness7. O Zarathushtra14! prayer10 (is) good11 for the people of the world15 (i.e. for the benefit of the people of the world), it (is) best13.
Explanation:- (The reason of the fact that prayer is most excellent is mentioned below).
(2) It16 (i.e. the prayer) (is) a shield20 against the powerful19 and wicked17 that21 (prayer) (is) covering all around31 the eyes24, intelligence25 (and) the ears26 of the wicked male22 and female23 (and) acts as a fetter30 for (their) hands27, feet28 (and) mouths29. The prayer33 which32 is perfect34, performed with the conscience and zafar away from wicked intention36 (is) a protection38, a shield40 against the druj39, (and) the repeller (of that druj).
Explanation:- (The prayer performed with sincere heart and pure intention serves for us a very powerful weapon against the wicked, and against superstitious and frightful thoughts. True prayer produces in us a sort of heroism and thereby we become powerful to prevent, to a great extent, hardships arisen against us. When all the daevas and drujas came to kill the Holy Zarathushtra, with an evil intent, the greatest remedy which was applied by the Holy Prophet at the time was to recite and chant aloud the efficacious hymn, “Yathā Ahū Vairyō”).

(3) The holy Srosh (yazata)1 (is) the nourisher4 of the poor1, and (is) victorious6 smiting8 the druj7; He12 (who) is the most righteous10 man9 pronouncing words of blessing11 (or the Holy16 Spell15) (is) driving away the most19 the invisible17 zbdruj18. Amongst (all) prayers21 (the prayer called)
za Original meaning is “Benevolent” and not “malevolent” or away from prejudices.
zb If the druj has entered into the mind of someone, i.e. if restlessness of mind or calamity of heart has occurred, it is removed by means of the recitation of “M ānthra Spenta”; “Mānthra Spenta” is, as it were, a good weapon of driving away the thought of ghost, witches, magic, etc., from the body.

(4) O Zarathushtra2! Whoso ever1, a man7 or8 a woman9 should pronounce6 this3 hymn5 of prayer4 (i.e. Ahunavar) with holy thought12, word14 (and) extremely holy15 deed16. Explanation:- (On what occasion should he recite is stated below).
Either18 on high17 waters19 or21 in great20 fear22 (or zdin terror22) or24 in the dark25 night23 overcast with mist26, on30 the bridge31 of canal (or river)29 waters27, over34 the zigzag paths35 of the roads32, or37 in the assemblies39 of the holy38 men36, or41 in the zegatherings43 of wicked persons40, demon worshippers42, (5) or45 at any47 (calamity), at any (bad period),zf if anyone (would have fallen) into dangers50 (or get) terrified51, (and if he would recite Ahunavar with true faith), on that55 day56 (or) on that58 night59 (i.e. at the time when he recites) (any) wicked60, oppressor61, tormentor62 (or) doer of injury63
zc If we take the word yahi as locative singular of yah instead of taking as an adjective nominative singular of yahin, its meaning can be “in the work”, “in the enterprise”. Taking in this sense, the translation of the sentence is (That) truthful word (i.e. the Hymn of Ahuna Vairya) (is) “most victorious in every enterprise.” The root of the word yahi is yah = Sanskrit yas = to try, to endeavour.
zd If we take thwaeshō equivalent to the Sanskrit tvisha (i.e. to shine, to glitter), the meaning of masō vā thwaeshō will be or “at the time of great brilliance”, i.e. to say, when streaks of light ning take place.
ze In Avesta a double vocabulary has been developed and a distinct set of terms is employed for the good and wicked beings, and for daevas:- e.g. hanjamana, i.e. an assembly of good and virtuous men; “handvarana”, i.e. gathering of the daevas and of wicked men; zasta, i.e. the hand of good man; gava i.e. the hand the demon or wicked man vaghdhana, i.e. the head of the good man; kameredha i.e. the head of the demon or wicked man; pādha, i.e. the foot of a good man; zangra, i.e. foot of the demon or wicked man; vach, i.e. to speak (of a good man); du, i.e. to howl (of the demon).
zf Arathya = bad event or ill-ominous event (Prof. Justi and Harlez); Prof. Darmesteter trans lates it, “by law, commandment of the religion, doctrine”.

aac This yasht is taken from yasna Hā 57, and like other yashts the origin is not different. In this entire ha, matter pertaining to Sraosha yazata has occurred. From this its name “Srosh yasht Vadi” is kept by separating this Hā like other yashts and by adding in it the initial and final Pazend passages. In the Darab Hormazdyar Persian Rivayets, in some places the name “Sarosha yashte yazashne” (i.e. Srosh yasht of the yazashne or occurring in the yazashne) to this yasht is given. Since it is recited for the first three nights in honour of the departed ones, this yasht is also known by the name “yashta se shab” (i.e. yasht of the three nights) from that. Amongst our Zoroastrians there is a custom of reciting this yasht only at night. The import of reciting this yasht at night is that Sraosha yazata protects that reciter in sleep from the attacks of demons, drujas or other wicked creations. Truly speaking there is no objection whatever if the yasht is recited at any time. During the day-time when yozdathragar Mobed performs the yazashna, he does not leave off that entire Srosh yasht (which as stated above is yasna ha 57 but recites the entire yasht. As regards the explanation and notes of this entire Srosh yasht, see my translation of Yazishn and Vispered”, Ha 57.

Explanation:- (Nowhere the verb “recite” occurs for the Gathas and Ahunavar, but the verb “srāvaya” Sanskrit sravaya i.e. to chant occurs. It will be clearly seen from this that the Gathas as well as the Ahunavar prayer should not be recited as we Zoroastrians recite other Avesta at present, but they should be chanted like songs. The meaning of the word Gāthā is equivalent to Sanskrit Gāthā “Holy Song”).

abv The original meaning as adverb is “above”, “up there”.
abw Darmesteter. “Woven cloth” derived from Sanskrit root ve “to weave” (Harlez). Its ordinary meaning is “bird”.
abx Darmesteter. Original meaning “in the three-thirds”. In the matter of dimensions this earth is stated to be divided in seven regions, according to Avesta; besides this, the three equal parts of thickness or density of the earth are mentioned. First one-third is the surface of the earth; second one-third is the portion of the interior of the surface of the earth; the third one-third is the low est, i.e. bottom portion. The significance of the word thrishva occuring in this para seems to be the first one-third, i.e. the surface portion. aby Root stā = Sanskrit sthā = to be, to exist, to remain. abz Root han-derez = to lighten, to bind. aca Darmesteter. Original meaning “made56 of pure57 iron58”.
acb Original meaning “following” (Ahura Mazda). Its significance seems to be that the above mentioned three yazatas were also associated with this task. acc Pari-vaēnōithe - potential mood third person dual parasmaipada.
acd Meaning: On account of the brilliance and glory of those (Fravashis) I maintain the Aredvi Sura, the undefiled. For the translation of the remaining portion, see first five paragraphs of Āvān yasht.

ach The exact meaning of vyāhva has not been ascertained. It seems to be the locative plural of the word vyā (see yasna Hā 48.7). Here this word can perhaps be vī + āhva; vī (prefix); āhva = demonstrative pronoun locative plural feminine; meaning “in them”. aci Or to flourish; to nourish; to rear. acj Based upon Bundahishn; “skin” (Darmesteter). ack Stō (= Sanskrit stah) - present tense third person dual parasmaipada; root ah.

The first ni - prefix occurring in this para should be taken with hazdyāt and the second ni with the word vaonyāt.

Windischmann stated that the word nāidyāongho which is associated with Gaotemahe is proper name. From this Dastur Darab concludes that “Nāidyāongha Gaotema” of Avesta is the same as “Gaotama Nodhas” of the Rig Veda. Besides Professor Max Muller fixes the age of Rushis to 1500 B.C.; from this the age of the Farvardin yasht can also be estimated. Also the meaning of nāidyāongh becomes “weaker, more needy” and “treated with contempt” (see yasna Hā 34.8, Hā 57.10.)

aga Original meaning “shows”; i.e. help for the good growth of the trees.
agb khvawrira = khva + ira (suffix); root bar = to bear = to produce, hu + awra + ira = made fresh well with watery clouds. agc Original meaning “showed”.

agh The reason of keeping watch over the Sea called, Vouru-kasha is that Gaokerena or White Haoma grows in it, which is used for drinking on the Day of Resurrection, in order to be immor tal. For further details, see my translation of the Vendidad, fargard XX, para 4, note.
agi Haptoiringa is the chief of the stars of the north. It is compared with Ursa Major. This star along with its companions, guards the gate and passage of hell, in order to prevent 99,999 demons, drujas, fairies, etc., coming out from hell, and for its authority 99,999 Fravashis come for help (See English translation of Minok i Kherad by Dr. West, Chapter 49, para 15).
agj The hero Keresaspa is one amongst the famous personages mentioned in later books of the Zoroastrian Religion. According to Bundehesh he lies in the plain of Peshyansai. The glory of heaven guards him, because when Zohak will be unfettered, he will rise and slay him. Moreover, innumerable Fravashis of the righteous people also guard him. According to Minok i Kherad, near the Mount Damavand where Zohak is bound with a chain, the hero Keresāspa lies asleep in the place called Poshta Gushtāspān (see English Translation of Dr. West).
agk Because from that seed Saoshyant - the future Benefactor will be born. According to later books, from the seed of the Prophet Zarathushtra, Hoshedar, Hoshedar-Māh and Soshyosh will be born from the wombs of Srutat-Fedhri, Vanghu-Fedhri and Eredat-Fedhri, respectively.

alx Original meaning, “in calamities”; āzahu is the locative plural of the word āzangh. aly Aomna - present participle nominative plural; root av = Sanskrit av = to help.
alz As an abstract noun, the meaning of “mānthra spenta” is, “Holy Spell”, “sacred verses of the religion”; as a genitive noun its meaning is, “the yazata Mārespand”, who is the transmitter of the sacred verses of the religion from the Creator Ahura Mazda to the Prophet Zarathushtra. Holy Zarathushtra had reverence for him for this reason.
ama If we consider the word vidaēvahe as an epithet of Mazdāo Ahurahe, it would mean “opponent of the daeva”.
amb The original meaning is: Whom18 Zarathushtra19 considered worthy of respect20 like Himself21.
amc Before these words yāo, yāoscha occur and the meaning is, “who, and who”, respectively. If we take the meaning, word by word, it is translated thus:- (you) who (are) waters, and (you) who (are) trees and (you) who (are) Fravashis.
amd Fravashis in this world are pleased to remain amidst water and fragrant flowers, and for this reason during the holy Fravartikān days, fresh water and flowers are kept in a sanctified place.
ame i.e. in this house. Original meaning is, “lower, nether”; it is the comparative degree of ava avara = aora (by dropping the middle a).
amf i.e. Except goodness and righteousness no other thoughts are brought in the mind. The significance of this sentence seems to be, that religious teachers of various Iranian countries, and virtuous priests who had come out for propagating the religion of Zarathushtra, have stayed in this house after their return.

anx Root fra-ju = Skt. pra-ju = to go forward, to hasten. If we take “aētahe” like Dr. Geldner instead of “hitahe”, it can be translated as:- He has the piercing look which can penetrate afar in the dark night.
any The meaning of “hu-khshnaothra” is also “very pleased”. But in the third kardāh of Srosh yasht Vadi the word ākhshnushcha in the sense of “knee” has occurred. I have felt it proper to take that meaning here. In these two places “khshnu” and “khshnao” instead of “znu” have oc curred. Amongst the characteristics of a good camel the strong knee and stout legs are very essential.

aqi Chatangrō - the exact meaning of this word is not settled; two, both (Harlez); four (Darmesteter). “Do thou spread that feather on the way of both (the armies)” (Harlez); “do thou throw four feathers on the way” (Darmesteter). In the text of Westergaard there is jatangrō instead of chatangrō. Spiegel has left out the meaning of this word.
aqj “Drive away to the right flank, to the left flank from all directions”. (Darmesteter). Dr. Geldner has taken the reading “adhvōzen, vidhvōzen, fradhvōzen”.
aqk The sentence from “Zarathushtra” up to “thrāyaone” (except the word anyat) of para 46 also occurs in the 9th para of Khordād yasht.
aql “Let not this Holy Spell be taught to anyone, except by the father to hisson,or by the brother to his brother from the same womb, or by the Athravan to his pupil” (Prof. Darmesteter). This Holy Spell should not be taught to anyone except to his father, to his son, to his own another brother from the same womb, or to the appointed priest of his own house (i.e. unto that appointed priest getting remuneration from the house). aqm i.e. a brother who has another brother or sister.
aqn The significance of “three religious orders” can be Herbad, Mobed, and Dastur. If the word thrāyaone be derived from the root thrā (to nourish) instead of taking thrāya, meaning “three”, then the meaning of “āthravanāi thrāyaone” can thus be “the priest nourish (the poor)”.

Explanation:- (The libations consecrated in the honour of Beheram yazata should not be taken or eaten by the persons mentioned below).
(51) Let not92 the sinful person94 hold in hand95 that (consecrated thing) nor96 (let) the courtesan97 (hold it in hand) or the violator of righteousness99, one who recites the Gathas without chanting100, the destroyer of the world1 (or) the opponent2 of this3 religion4 which5 is of Ahura Mazda6 revealed by Zarathushtra7 (i.e. the enemy of the religion) - (all of them need) not98 (hold in hands that consecrated thing). (52) But if the sinful person9 or12 the courtesan11 or14 the violator of righteousness13, one who recites the Gathas without chanting15, the destroyer of the world16, (or) the opponent17 of this18 religion19 which20 is of Ahura Mazda21 revealed by Zarathushtra22 holds it in hand10, Beheram yazata25 created by Ahura Mazda26 then arbsnatches away24 the healing virtues23.

arg Haperesi and nemetka should be some kind of green and bad wood unfit for bringing into use for burning on the fire. The meaning of the word nemetka is seen from its root nam (Persian nam = wet). According to Zoroastrian religion the fuel for burning should be quite dry and wellexamined in the light (see Atash Nyāyesh). arh Root sad = Sanskrit shad = to attack. ari Root hadh = Sanskrit sadh = to kill.

Explanation: Its significance is, men should protect the cattle, should give them sufficient food, take care of them at the time of extreme cold and extreme heat, and they should not be made to work with cruelty; because they are very useful for our happiness and benefit. The ox serves us in the work of tilling the fields and in carrying heavy burden; the cow gives milk from which several things are prepared for our food.

arz i.e. for the worship etc., of Hom yazata, giving strength of righteousness (see Khorshed Nyāyesh). Spiegel, Darmesteter and Justi translate this word ashavazanghō by the “holy origin, born pure” deriving it from ashavan and zangha =root zan. Harlez gives three different meanings of this word (1) of holy knowledge; (2) bom holy; (3) originator - bringer of righteousness. But I have thought it proper to translate this word by “giving strength of righteousness”, deriv ing it from asha = righteousness and vazangh = strength. asa For its translation, see para 21 of this yasht. asb i.e. was purifying the throne of the fire vase. asc i.e. take out the juice for drinking by pounding then Hom twigs.
asd The meaning of “Saoshyantō” is giving light to the world, indicators of the path of morality, piety and divine worship to the people, persons well-versed in the precepts of religion, the re storer of the religion in its original pure state by wiping off impurities. In the singular case its meaning is the prophet who will be born of the mother Eredat-fedhri at the time of ResurrectionRistākhiz.

Moreover, in some books, he is even designated as a prophet.

auz This entire Nirang appears to have been composed at a very later period; its wording is rather complicated. Also Arabic words, are employed in it along with Pazend words:- e.g. Kul, bala, dafe, seheran, shaitan, etc.

SIROZĀ YASHT
Explanation: In the Sirozā yasht the remaining 28 small and large Khshnumans - propitiatory formulas are included - except the Khshnumans of Srosh and Farvardin and the small and large Khshnumans of Barjo, Hom and Daham, as Khshnumans as well as the Chapter of Stoom to be recited in honour of the departed souls (yasna Hā 26). The reason for dropping out the Khshnumans of Srosh and Farvardin:
The Bāz of Sirozā can be consecrated by 4 drons - sacred unleavened bread made of wheat flour - whilst in the Bāz of Srosh 6 drons are required. For this reason from the Bāz of Sirozā the Khshnuman of Srosh is dropped out. The Khshnuman of Srosh from the Sirozā yasht is also dropped out. Besides, after the recitation of the Khshnuman of Daham there comes at the end the Khshnuman of Farvardin (ashaunām fravashinām .......... nabānazdishtanām fravashinām); the Khshnuman of Farvardin is therefore, not recited in the middle.
Moreover, it is necessary to note that the translation of the Khshnumans which has occurred in various yashts of this book, was not given again, but references to the pages of that Khshnuman as well as its translation are mentioned. The translation of the rest of the Khshnumans is given. Khshnaothra Ahurahe Mazdāo. Ashem Vohū 1.

awx The entire portion of this Doa Tandarosti (paras 2-7) is taken from yasna HS 60. Moreover the same Avesta is recited also as Āfrinagan Dahmān.
awy i.e. in order to give proper protection of wealth, etc., to virtuous and just persons, and in or der to defeat wicked persons by destroying them. awz The meaning of savascha is benefit, profit and prolific as well. axa The meanings of khvarenascha khvāthremcha are “glory and splendour”.
axb The original meaning of asishta is “rapid of all”; its another form is āsishta, (see Hom yasht Large, karda 1, para 15). Prof. Darmesteter explains this word as:- Without name (a + sishta); root syanh. From this root Prof. Darmesteter takes paiti syōdūm as “you cut it” (see yasna Hā 48, para 7).

religious sense can be like the word in English, “fervent” (the original meaning according to the root of which is “to effervesce, to boil”).
axt Original meaning “with the cattle”. In ancient times the property of the people was in terms of cattle. The word for “money” in English is derived from the word pashu:- Pecuniary, Fee.
axu i.e. Even though harm may reach my body or my life be forfeited, I will not cause damage of any kind whatsoever to the Mazda-worshippers.
axv For its comparison, see yasna Hā 49, Stanza 3. The meaning of Avesta mru (Sanskrit bru) is to “speak”; but when this root is used with different prefixes, its meaning is changed:- e.g. nīmrū means “to request”, “to demand”; paiti-mru means “to answer”; “to reply”; ā-mrū means “to call, to invoke”; vī-mrū, antare-mrū means “to abjure, to deny, to forsake, not to accept, to renounce”.
axw The meaning of the word anā which is derived from the Sanskrit e, resembles to Latin idem (= likewise) as an adverb. Generally, ana, anā (Sanskrit anen) is demonstrative pronoun masculine and/or neuter third person singular.

axx Anāish is a pronoun standing for the noun daēvāish.
axy The root khshi = Sanskrit khshi = to order, to command. If we follow the reading adhakhshayaeta according to Dr. Geldner’s Avestan edition, it would mean then “instructed”; root dakhsh, ā-dakhsh = Sanskrit ā-dish, upa-dish = to instruct.
axz In the original Avesta some words of this paragraph are repeated twice (to be more effective):- e.g. “vīpaēshū frashnaēshū; vīspaēshū hanjamanaēshū, yāish aperesaētem Mazdāoschā Zarathushtraschā;” however I have translated these words Zarathushtrō vyamravītā only once.
aya Yā = Sanskrit yā = what; varana, varena = faith, belief, creed, a religious doctrine or custom; besides varana = Sanskrit varana = choice, desire; the original meaning of yavaranao is, “of what choice”.
ayb Saoshyantām - the meaning of this word is, “beneficent to the world” and, “givers of light to men”, i.e. bringing the people from darkness into light and pointing out the divine, moral path. When this word comes in the plural, it is used for the prophets prior to the advent of the Prophet Zarathushtra (viz. Gayamard, Hoshang, Tehmurasp, Faridoon, Kai Khaosrau, etc.) and when employed in the singular number, it stands for the Saoshyant - the future benefactor.
ayc Farashostara and Jāmāspa were two brothers of the family of Hvova; for further details see my translation of Yasna and Vispered, Hā 12th, para 7, and my Avesta dictionary.

A SHORT SYNOPSIS OF DĪN-NO KALAMO (i.e. THE ZOROASTRIAN CREED).
I am the hater and destroyer of all the daevas, and idol-worship. I am the praiser of the Ameshaspands or Holy Immortals and their glorifier. I am the worshipper of the Creator of the entire world who is Omnipotent and Omniscient, Ahura Mazda. I accept to remove the distress and difficulty from the houses of the Mazda-worshipping people and to protect the cattle and beneficent animals from thieves and robbers. I hate to live under the authority of lying and wicked men, and of the sorcerers. I aspire to act in accordance with the religion and custom which the Prophet Holy Zarathushtra, Kava Vishtāspa, Farashostara and Jāmāsp followed, and which other truth-speaking (truthful) righteous men have acted upon. I am a Mazda-worshipper. As a Mazda-worshipping follower of Zarathushtra I like to be the praiser of the Zoroastrian Religion and to keep full faith on that good Religion. I praise good thought, good word and good deed. I praise the good Mazda-worshipping Religion which is, promoting peace and concord, fostering brotherhood and just. The religion of Ahura Mazda revealed by Zarathushtra is the best amongst those religions that are, that shall be hereafter, and I accept it with sincere heart.

(12) Ze tō jumleh khūbī ba man baratāst, Ze man āncheh āyad sarāsar khatāst.
(12) From Thee there is the gift of entire goodness on me; but from me there is (nothing) to (offer to) Thee except sin and transgression.
(13) Nagūyam khodāyā zaram bakhshō sīm, Gunāham babakhshā ke hastam asīm.
(13) O Almighty Lord! I do not say that Thou dost grant me gold and silver (i.e. do Thou enrich me with wealth); only this much I ask of Thee: forgive my sins, because I am a sinner.
(14) To gar befganī dast keh gīradam, To ham gar berānī keh bepzīradam.
(14) If Thou wilt deprive me, who will grant me support? If Thou wilt drive me out, who will accept me?
(15) Ketābe siyeh kāriām dar baghal, Furu māndeam hamchū khar dar vahal.
(15) Having the book with notes of my wicked deeds under the arm-pit, I repent like an ass plunged in the mire.
(16) Keh juz tō bar ārad marā zābō gel, Ba ābō gelam dast gīrō mahel.
(16) From the water and the mud, (i.e. from ignorance) who will draw me out (O Merciful Lord!) save Thee? Be Thou Helper unto me for drawing me out of it and do not let me remain therein.
(17) Agar pur-gunāham mane sharmasār, Ze ehsān baram ābe rehmat bebār.
(17) If shamefully I am replete with sins, do Thou (O God!) sprinkle upon me water of mercy through Thy grace (i.e. have mercy on me).
(18) Agar nātavānī fetad zīre pāy, Chū girand dastash bekhīzad ze jāy.
(18) If any weak person would fall down and if anyone would help him holding his hands, that person would stand up again.
(19) Man ān nā-tavānam fetādeh asīr, Khodāyā! se rehamt marā dast gīr.
(19) I am that weak, fallen captive of Thine. Therefore, O Lord! mayest Thou be my helper by showing mercy on me!

azq JHP note: Masani was a proponent of the “Khshnoomist” movement, considered heterodox by many. His explanation reflects those teachings: (Explanation of Ervad Masani as regards the above-mentioned Kardāh). This Kardāh which is known as “Yātu zi Zarthushtra” should be recited seven times. In the Zoroastrian Religion is explained the Law of Vibrations producing ef ficacious effects of the recital of the Holy Spells and according to this Law of Vibrations the effect of this Kardāh is most powerful and beneficial. Specifically, this Kardāh is regarded as most efficacious for resisting against the magic of any person like “yātu”, “black magician”. Owing to the entire “Fshushō-mānthra” embodied in it, a lucid interpretation cannot be easily comprehended by us by translating it word by word. But the explanation of this Kardāh in short is this: When the force of wickedness comes against that person who is most advanced in spir ituality, and who belongs to the position of either “āthravan” or “Rathaeshtār”, owing to the law of dualism, then, the “Stot” pertaining to seven Ameshāspand within the “Kehrpa” or the astral body provide protection against it; i.e. If the Holy Spells which have been included into this Kardāh are recited continuously, there will be the defence of the “Kehrpa” of the person highly advanced in spirituality. Many mysterious matters, especially “ā-tare” are embodied in this Karda; i.e. an attitude inclining more to sins of commission, known as “freh-būtīh” in Pahlavi, and “vī-tare” i.e. an attitude which keeps continuously further away from divine influences, i.e. sins of omission, known as “aibi-būtīh” in Pahlavi. These spells are given to save continuously from two types of sins, which cause disturbance in the development of the soul in accordance with the law of “mithra”. Remember that as a shield of powerful defence against the sins of “mithra” possessed of magical effect and “ā-tare” - excess and “vī-tare” - deficiency pertaining to “mānthra”, as well as for keeping continuously in the “kehrpa” vibrations, (i.e. vibration-col ours), this “Kardāh” is most exalted and excellent. It will be helpful in maintaining the proportion of righteousness within the reciter.
