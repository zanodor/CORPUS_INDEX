A celestial observation related to K ̥rṣṇa-lore &
Kaliyuga in ह्मब्रवैवतर्पुराणम् indicates the date of 3102
BCE (DOB Śrī K ̥rṣṇa 3112 BCE)
This is an addendum to: Śrī K ̥rṣṇa, (DOB 27 July 3112), 11 year young kiśora kills Kaṃsa, emphatic evidence of avatāra -- skymaps, texts, sculptural
gallery https://tinyurl.com/vpyvhp9c
For ready reference, I attach the article of RN Iyengar which deals with some Celestial Observations Associated with Krsna-Lore.
Indian Journal of History of Science, 41,1 (2006) 1-13 R.N. Iyengar
R.N. Iyengar dates the MBh war as 1478 BCE. Clearly, he does not deal with any Kaliyuga related celestial observations in the MBh text.
I find the most emphatic reference to the arrival of Kaliyuga is in ह्मब्रवैवतर्पुराणम् which
provides jyotiṣa pramāṇa for the start of Kaliyuga.
गोलोकं गच्छ शींघ्र ंत्व सांर्ध गोकु लवाससस िः । आरात्कलेरागमनं कमतमूलसनकृ न्तनम् ।। ११ ।। (ब्रह्मवैवतर्पुराणम् /खिःण्ड ४ (श्रीकृ ष्णजन्मखिःण्ड ).11)
Note that the citation occurs in श्रीकृ ष्णजन्मखिःण्ड and the context is an exhortation to Gokula residents.
Translation of this textual evidence by Rajendra Nath Sen:
The approach of Kali, the destroyer of the germs of good deeds, is impending or near at hand. On the approach of Kali, there will be no distinction between persons of different castes. (Translation by Rajendra Nath Sen, 1920) https://archive.org/details/brahmavaivartapu04allauoft/page/548/mode/2up
I find this evidence compelling that KaliYuga arrival is IMPENDING.
आरात्कलेरागमनं This expression is a compound of two terms: आगमनं āgamanam (of Kali)
PLUS आरा्र् ārāt. The reading, translation is: Kali arrival is IMMEDIATE.
ā-gamana means ‘arrival’; ā-gamana n. (ifc. f(ā). , Kathās. ) coming, approaching, arriving,
returning, KātyŚr. ; MBh. āgamana n. ʻ arrival ʼ MBh. [√gam]Pa. āgamana -- n., Pk. āamaṇa n., NiDoc. loc. agamaṁnaṁmi.dvirāgamana -- .Addenda: āgamana -: Brj. Āgaun; dvirāgamana n. ʻ the second entry of a bride into husband's house ʼ lex. [dvíḥ, āgamana -- ]N. durān (< *durāgamana -- ?).(CDIAL 6684)
आरा्र् ārāt means 'immediately, directly’ (Apte) ārāt ‘directly,immediately’, Prab.; Kathās.;Śak.131a (Monier-Williams)

If Goloka period of Krishna's life is as a kiśora, he should be about 11 years of age when the
indication is emphatically stated that arrival of Kali is direct, immediate. I submit that this
arrival is in 3102 BCE when Krishna, kiśora is 11 year youth (DOB 3112 BCE).
In the context of this text and the references from MBh cited earlier, I do not understand the repeated reference by some MBh astronomers to Krishna's death as the start of Kaliyuga.
Kaliyuga skymap-
jyotiṣa pramāṇa
is a celebration by Siddhantins of the start of a Yuga, totally unrelated to the death of Krishna but related to the proof of an extraordinary event in Krishna avatāra when a 11 year youth kills Kamsa-- restores dharma in the Mathura kingdom.
