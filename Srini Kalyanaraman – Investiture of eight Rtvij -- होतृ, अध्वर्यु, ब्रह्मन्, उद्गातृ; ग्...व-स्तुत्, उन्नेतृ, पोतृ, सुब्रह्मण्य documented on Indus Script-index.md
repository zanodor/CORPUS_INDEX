A fine metalworking tradition appears to have developed in western Central Asia in the late third to the early second millennium B.C. Based on comparisons with excavated pottery types and with finds in the so-called Fullol hoard of objects from northern Afghanistan,1 a number of gold and silver vessels have been attributed to Bronze Age Bactria. Perhaps the most exceptional are cylindrical silver vessels with elaborate figural scenes executed in low relief with incised details, all of which may come from a single workshop.
On this example,2 bearded and moustached male banqueters wearing fillets in their bound long hair are seated in a row above men and boys plowing a field. The main personage in this upper row, who faces left, is distinguished by an elliptically shaped bead on his fillet; he also wears a necklace and bracelet with similar beads, all bearing hatched patterns that might suggest veined stone such as agate. A robe with very clearly rendered individual tufts covers one arm entirely and envelops the rectangular form of his lower body. The man's exposed right arm is raised to hold a tall footed beaker to his mouth (this is the only figure to have a defined mouth). In front of him are a footed fruit bowl, a pair of tall vessels, and a second seated figure wearing a robe with a herringbone pattern. The proper right arm of this figure is raised toward the main personage. Also part of this banqueting scene are five other seated male figures, their garments distinguished alternatively by individual tufts or horizontal rows of hatchings that form herringbone patterns. Some figures hold beakers and one rests a hand on a large altar-like rectangular object with a crosshatched pattern.

In the scene below, two plows are held by long-haired men wearing short kilts with herringbone patterns. Before them, nude youths holding branches attempt to keep two pairs of oxen under control. Another male figure holds a square object-perhaps a box or even a drum-under one arm, and raises the other one. The figures stand on freshly seeded earth; between the animals is an object with a wavy-line pattern and seed-like elements along the top edge. Although difficult to interpret, this could indicate landscape in viewed from above or a vessel in profile.
While iconographic elements such as the garments connect the imagery on this cup to the art of Mesopotamia and Elam, certain aspects of style are very distinctive. In particular, a strong interest in the placement of human and animal figures in space is manifest. The oxen in the background are darkened with hatched lines to clearly distinguish them from those in the foreground.3 The muscular shoulders of the human figures may be depicted in profile or in threequarter view, and they may have one rather than two nipples showing. The two plows, one seen from the front and the other from the back, are placed behind one and in front of the other nude youth. An interest in the use of patterning to define the textures of garments and objects is also evident.
In style, this cup is closely related to a silver vessel in the Levy-White collection.4 The main personage in a hunting scene there bears a close resemblance to the main figure on the present cup. He is bearded, with a well-delineated mouth, and has elliptical beads both in his hair and around his neck. A figure with similar features appears on another cup, which depicts the aftermath of a successful hunt.5

1. Amiet 1988b, pp. 136, 161, describes this hoard (like the "Astrabad treasure" from Iran with related material) as a contrived collection of objects from clandestine excavations in northern Afghanistan; see Tosi and Wardak 1972, pp. 9-17.

Designs are incised into an upper and lower register on the walls of this silver cup, with the upper register showing a ritual scene and the lower register showing a farming scene with oxen. The upper register scene has also been thought to be a banqueting scene, but of the eight seated figures, only the figure on the far right facing to the left is shown with food before him and raising his cup to his mouth. This figure is also shown with his head, neck and wrists wearing jewels that appear to be onyx, and higher grade of clothing, both clearly symbols of his high rank. The figure directly in front of this high ranking figure is shown in a position of obeisance, and he has jewelry only on his head. The other six figures have no jewelry. These



6
devices clearly are thought to indicate the respective ranks of these figures. This offertory or welcoming posture can also be seen in the last two figures in this row.
·
· The two oxen in the lower register are shown pulling plows during a tilling and planting scene. The small naked figure wields a stick to urge on the oxen, and there are clear divisions drawn between the figures holding onto the plow and those sowing seeds. There are similar examples of silver cups from this period with hunting scenes, and in the same manner, those who are thought to be high-ranking figures are shown adorned with jewelry thought to be made of onyx. This body expression with short kilted skirt and emphasized musculature was characteristic of the western Central Asia through Eastern Iran from the 3rd millennium BC through the 2nd millennium BC. The arranged hair expression on the forequarters of the oxen and the musculature of the back legs are also unique to Bactrian culture. The ruins of a massive Bactrian fort of this same period have been excavated, along with temples inside the fort and large numbers of weapons, and we can thus imagine the existence of a ruler who was powerful both in politics and in military might, all while acting as the head cleric of the religion. These people did not have writing, but this vessel clearly depicts one aspect of their society.

The hair of the priest is parted in the middle. Hair is secured by a fillet.whose long ends hang from behind the head. Gold fillet have been found including one with the hieroglyph of 'standard device'.
“The figure is draped in an elaborate shawl with corded or rolled-over edge, worn over the left shoulder and under the right arm. This shawl is decorated all over with a design of trefoils in relief interspersed occasionally with small circles, the interiors of which are filled in with a red
pigment...there is a shallow pitting in the middle of each foil and roundel suggesting the point of a drill... ”(Mackay, 1931, I, pp. 356-357).

"Priest King" Forehead
The central ornament worn on the forehead of the famous "priest-king" sculpture from Mohenjodaro appears to represent an eye bead, possibly made of gold with steatite inlay in the center.
"Priest King"
Seated male sculpture, or "Priest King" from Mohenjo-daro(41,42,43). Fillet or ribbon headband with circular inlay ornament on the forehead and similar but smaller ornament on the right upper arm. The two ends of the fillet fall along the back and though the hair is carefully combed towards the back of the head, no bun is present. The flat back of the head may have held a separately carved bun as is traditional on the other seated figures, or it could have held a more elaborate horn and plumed headdress.
Two holes beneath the highly stylized ears suggest that a necklace or other head ornament was attached to the sculpture. The left shoulder is covered with a cloak decorated with trefoil, double circle and single circle designs that were originally filled with red pigment. Drill holes in the center of each circle indicate they were made with a specialized drill and then touched up with a chisel. Eyes are deeply incised and may have held inlay. The upper lip is shaved and a short combed beard frames the face. The large crack in the face is the result of weathering or it may be due to original firing of this object.

Straight and curved gold fillet. Mohenjodaro (Kenoyer)Gold and agate ornaments includes objects found at both Mohenjo-daro and Harappa. At the top are fillets of finely burnished hammered gold that would have been worn around the forehead. Each end of the top fillet is decorated with a punctuated design depicting the ritual offering stand that is common on the unicorn seals. The third ornament from the top was probably worn with the center point at the



12
top of the forehead and the sides curving down over the eyebrows. The hole at the center and on the ends were for holding a cord.
The other ornaments include bangles, chokers, long pendant necklaces, rings, earrings, conical hair ornaments, and broaches. Such ornaments were never buried with the dead, but were passed on from one generation to the next. These ornaments were hidden under the floors in the homes of wealthy merchants or goldsmiths. (See Kenoyer, Ancient Cities, p. 200) https://www.harappa.com/blog/ornaments-and-jewelry
Male head (back and side) Mohenjodaro http://www.harappa.com/indus/40.html
Male head probably broken from a seated sculpture. Finely braided or wavy combed hair tied into a double bun on the back of the head and a plain fillet or headband with two hanging ribbons falling down the back (40).
The upper lip is shaved and a closely cropped and combed beard lines the pronounced lower jaw. The stylized almond shaped eyes are framed by long eyebrows. The wide mouth is very similar to that on the "Priest-King" sculpture. Stylized ears are made of a double curve with a central knob.
