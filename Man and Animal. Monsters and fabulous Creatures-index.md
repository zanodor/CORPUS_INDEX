Man and Animal. Monsters and fabulous Creatures
GOD, MAN AND ANIMAL
Originally our ancestors must have had some very mixed feelings
about animals. Some animals was directly life-supporting and others
was directly life-threatening. But Mythological, our ancestors had no
problem with mixing names and figures between man and animal.
Anthropomorphic figures are well known from all original mythology
and religion. And those religions who don't have anthropomorphic
figures to day, have just repressed and excluded both the natural and
mythological meaning.
Many of the Anthropomorphic figures represent Gods and
Goddesses in the Sky. Looking at the Milky Way contours in the night
Sky, you will se and notice different details, depending on your
eyesight power and on the time of the year you are observing.
The Northern Milky Way contours was often carved and pictured as
a man; a man with concentric symbols; a man with erection; a man
with horns, and even as a winged man. Beast or Human? Angel or
Devil? God or Human? The answer is Yes!



But with normal eyesight and in perfect weather and season
conditions, you can see most accurately the same figure and details
as on the rubbing-pictures above from Sweden, Bohuslen, on both
sides of the star map picture. The Atlas-picture 4 shows in close-up,
how accurately the artist of picture 3 has observed and carved the
detail of what easily could be pictured as an erected penis on both
pictures. Even the detailed fact that the penis is not placed in the
right anatomic place, is right on both the Star atlas and on the
carvings.
In pictures 1 and 3 above, You can see a contour sticking out in the



back of the figure. This is interpreted by scholars as a sword
sheathe. Logically this is nonsense. Would an obvious naked man
bear a sword? But anyway, the artist have carved a very detailed
picture of what You can observe from the white Milky Way contours
on a favourable night. In fact, this figure is the most detailed picture
of the Northern Milky Way contours.
An approximately 6.000 year old stone from Horsens, Denmark and a
Rock Art motif from Sweden compared to the Egyptian god Seth. All
very similar - of course as they depicts the contours of the northern



Milky Way.
The Set animal
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(mythology)#The_Set_animal)
In art, Set was mostly depicted as a mysterious and unknown
creature, referred to by Egyptologists as the Set animal or Typhonic
beast, with a curved snout, square ears, forked tail, and canine body,
or sometimes as a human with only the head of the Set animal. It has
no complete resemblance to any known creature, although it does
resemble a composite of an aardvark, a donkey, and a jackal, all of
which are desert creatures. The main species of aardvark present in
ancient Egypt additionally had a reddish appearance (due to thin fur,
which shows the skin beneath it). In some descriptions he has the
head of a greyhound. The earliest known representation of Set
comes from a tomb dating to the Naqada phase of the Predynastic
Period (circa 4000 BC–3500 BC), and the Set-animal is even found
on a mace-head of the Scorpion King, a Protodynastic ruler.
The simplest marking of the northern Milky Way figure and the
celestial north pole.



Because of the Earth rotation, You will observe the Milky Way
contours in different positions. In vertical position the contours very
easily can show a human. In horizontal position, the contours can
show an animal. Mythological the story telling goes on a God mowing
in the Sky and change to an animal or a God diving into the Sea or
down in the Underworld. The Uffington White Horse in England and
other places, could very well represent the white Milky Way contours
observed in the horizontal position. The same could very well be the
case with the cupmark carvings on the Palaeolithic figure to the
right, symbolizing the shining stars and light in the Milky Way.



The Northern Milky Way contours is often observed, pictured and
carved on the rocks as a man; a man with concentric symbols; a man
with erection; a man with horns; and even as a winged man. Beast or
human? Angel or Devil? God or Human? The answer is Yes!
