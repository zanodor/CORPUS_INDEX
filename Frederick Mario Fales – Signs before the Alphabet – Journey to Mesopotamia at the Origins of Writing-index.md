Giancarlo Ligabue Fondation President
The Revolution in a Sign In my decades of dialogue with the works of art in the Ligabue
collection, one subject seemed to remain suspended – that of the tablets and seals which, simplifying for the sake of clarity, we will call Mesopotamian.
The little stone cylinders bear - along with figures of persons, animals, deities, and vegetation - messages that are brief and apparently simple, like the twitters we use today; while the clay tablets, with their labyrinthine wedges, continue to convey messages to men and gods.
I have frequently travelled with my father Giancarlo, who formed this collection decades ago, over the paths indicated by those signs.
And each time, first orienting myself, then losing my way again; attempting to understand the idea contained in those messages, transmitted in such original manner. There were pictographic symbols, numbers, motifs of celestial gods and of inferno in that age-old world.
Never before had I fully understood the true and immense human value, the amazing cultural import and the modernity of that most ancient world.
In working with the ‘Giancarlo Ligabue Foundation’ – to make visible to the public hundreds of the seals and tablets in the Collection – my thoughts returned to the first times I had viewed those imprints on clay and stone; and I saw with other eyes the messages that these objects continue to bring with them.
Those voices still locked within them belonged to people and populations that we might call ‘our contemporaries’, insofar as they present stories, symbols and gestures of a daily life still practiced and elaborated today: lists that sanction the first property rights, medical prescriptions to ease the pain of childbirth, homage paid to the deities and their intercession, contracts for purchasing animals, or tools for constructing buildings.
Mesopotamia (almost in parallel with Egypt and – at a great geographical and in part historical distance – with China, Mesoamerica and South America) has enriched the human adventure by the invention of writing.
Writing or not writing was not a chance occurrence.
My father used to explain this phenomenon to me by saying, ‘It was cultural evolution that began, at that time, to mark the rhythm of genetic evolution. Two million years before, Homo Habilis had extrapolated from nature instruments foreign to its structure, “choppers’, to be used for both prey and predators. Then came an exceptional technological development, agriculture and its accompanying



phenomena: sedentariness, urbanism, newly organised social and economic relationships, demographic development, and centralised authority.”
Today I can fully comprehend how this human revolution, that of the written word, was not only the child of an intellectual and scientific process, and of a need - but also a choice of identity and culture that has produced order, civilisation and the certainty of rights, combining social relationships in permanent and visible manner.
Our own existence lies already in the world of the Land between Two Rivers.
It is in that cultural dimension that the Western World was born. In that world and in those times, the numbers and symbols that would develop into the alphabet were ‘invented’.
Again in the words of Giancarlo, “that time, where thoughts became drawings, then signs and symbols, was humanity’s great road to Damascus.”
We still stand amazed before these objects, created over four thousand years ago, which continue to launch messages of singular, exalting beauty.
As the ‘Giancarlo Ligabue Foundation’ we have decided to bring back to life this enormous Mesopotamian library, which had remained dormant for over 40 centuries.
I have had no doubt as to who should serve as guide among those shelves, and interpreter of those labyrinthine studies conducted on books, objects, narratives, journeys, and conversations, retracing and enriching a path already taken thirty years ago with the book ‘Prima dell’alfabeto’ [Before the Alphabet].
Frederick Mario Fales, curator of the exhibition and author of this catalogue – whom I thank for his patient diligence, his keen, discerning discourse and profoundly scientific outlook - has renewed the encounter with many objects already familiar to him. And supplementing them with others, he has given us today, in collaboration with Roswitha Del Fabbro, a new and priceless testimonial to the world of Mesopotamia.
I would like to thank him even more from the human viewpoint, for having brought to fruition a cultural journey begun decades before with my father Giancarlo; a journey in which I share and am committed to divulging.
In the spirit of the first nineteenth-century ‘readers’ of those mysterious languages remained buried for millennia, this exhibition – held at the Biblioteca di Palazzo Loredan, seat of the Istituto Veneto delle
Scienze, one of our city’s vital fulcrums of knowledge and culture - is also a new cultural challenge for Venice, a city that, on each occasion, delves more deeply into its special role as interpreter of modernity. A city that was destined to be the ‘Capital of Culture’.
Moreover, this exhibition is a fine example of cooperation with various scientific institutes in Italy and abroad. Noteworthy among the many are the Musei Reali di Torino with its director Enrica Pagella, for the crucially important loan of the relief carving of King Sargon II, and the Museo Archeologico di Venezia and its director, Annamaria Larese, for the loan of some of the objects that Austen Henry Layard brought to Venice from Nineveh, the city he discovered, in the nineteenth century.
Lastly, in a note of personal gratitude, I would like to acknowledge my appreciation of Massimo Casarin and Adriano Favaro, for the great commitment they have dedicated to the cultural projects of the Foundation, and for their ardent enthusiasm in paying homage to the memory of a friend.



instantly. To address the breadth and complexity of the seals, unpublished until now, in view of the exhibition we both chose to involve Dr. Roswitha Del Fabbro, an archaeologist from Udine/ Berlin,with her invaluable experience of excavations in Syria, Turkey, and Kurdistan. We also decided to give the exhibition the same name as the previous work, Before the Alphabet. Under the wise guidance of the editor Adriano Favaro, I was given great freedom to design the descriptive system of the catalogue according to interwoven and innovative perspectives, without sacrificing the ease of understanding the whole.
So was everything that easy? Not exactly. The aging translator of cuneiform tablets soon had to realize that the archaeological publishing world was nowadays undergoing a new, gigantic boom due to IT tools; that the speed of implementation was a diktat in this world; and that texts and illustrations could be subjected to changes, shifts, and multiple revisions leading to the most appropriate result for a catalogue such as the one we had designed. However, thanks to the tireless activity of study, classification, and analysis by Roswitha Del Fabbro - who has constantly accompanied and supported me –, to the preliminary archival work by Dr. Marta Dal Martello, to the constant creative suggestions on editorial design by Adriano Favaro, to Federico Dei Rossi for the technical and graphic aspects, along with the Ubis Three team, to Lucia Berti for her precious liason work with the Foundation, and, last but not least, to the amicably perceptive and consistently strong guidance of Dr. Inti Ligabue, the President of the Foundation, the result, in my view, has exceeded all expectations.
So I offer a sincere and warm thanks to all; although we are now physically distant from Mesopotamia, the Land of the Twin Rivers can relive in the pages that follow, primarily thanks to the uniqueness, variety, and beauty of the antiquities collection of the Ligabue Foundation, and secondly, thanks go to the prodigious team work that led to the creation of this catalogue and to the exhibition that this catalogue reflects.
And finally, I am - in unison with the whole 'team' just mentioned - extremely grateful to the Presidency of the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, the academy of which I am honoured to be a member since 1998, for having generously agreed to host, in its highly cultured rooms of noble simplicity at Palazzo Loredan, the exhibition of which this catalogue will be the mirror, yes, but above all its projection: not only concretely as regards the wonderful three-dimensional antiquities on display, but also beyond, in the computer spheres of virtual and expanded reality, as additional assistance for their full enjoyment and first-hand perusal.
Today, the Near East has become surprisingly distant from us: for Realpolitik, for the human and cultural relations between the peoples of the Mediterranean area, as well as for me personally. Nowadays it only on television that I ever see the street signs of the places along the Upper Tigris and the Upper Euphrates where I had directed excavations, where I had found housing and machinery for rent, where I had conversed with people every day. Mosul, Jerablus, Kobanî: my memory evokes lively and cheerful marketplaces, cordial visits in people's homes, and endless negotiations – one tea after another - to obtain workers for the archaeological activities. At the time, we deluded ourselves that our stressful career paths in Italy would have benefitted from a healthy break in routine with the annual 2-3 months of physical work in Mesopotamia, in contact with the local population who placidly accepted the 'different' people who had come by airplane from the West, with their ever new instruments and their obsessions about excavation techniques...Today, I try searching in vain among the faces on TV for those I once knew amidst the refugees who are fleeing on foot in family groups, I no longer recognize their habits in the myriad of smartphones accompanying their cardboard suitcases, and I do not understand exactly how that world, kept for so long in a fatalistic sleep by iconic and paternalistic dictators, so quickly became an inferno of everyone against everyone, with missile strikes, mass conversions, and human shields. The Near East now seems to have turned into a remote planet, senseless and unfathomable, like Tlön and Orbis Tertius imagined by Jorge Luis Borges.
And us? Banned from our excavation sites, today the destinations of profit-greedy predators, we have returned to observing ancient Mesopotamia only from our libraries, although enriched by the work of interpreting its history and culture from the many impressions of its territory - vegetation, roads and distances, climates - that those decades 'in the field' have left in our mind's eye. And thus it came to pass that I walked once more along the paving stones of the Venetian streets leading to the Erizzo Palace, where Giancarlo Ligabue in the Eighties had generously opened up for me his magnificent collection of cuneiform tablets, allowing me to publish them in the form of a richly illustrated book, entitled Before the Alphabet. Alas, Giancarlo was no more the person awaiting me, but his son Inti, who is just as affectionate, passionate, and determined, and ready with an idea of great novelty and charm: to present his father's collection of Mesopotamian antiquities in an exhibition in Venice, also including the collection of cylinder seals, invaluable as to their historical and artistic value. The offer was irresistible: I agreed, gratefully and

The exhibition Before the Alphabet, presented by the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti, is a happy occasion for different reasons. Obviously it is a pleasure to have played a role in the first initiative addressed to a broad audience by a young foundation that is taking its important initial steps with a highly cultural and refined commitment. When we are faced with new undertakings of this kind, they are always measured with likewise highly positive events, but especially so in the periods for cultural initiatives that sometimes seem to not enjoy favorable conjunctures. If this is in itself cause for satisfaction, it is all the more so in remembering that Giancarlo Ligabue, after whom the new Foundation is named, was a member of our Institute since 1985.
It will be necessary then to remember that the new Foundation, despite its youth, came from afar, previously having had the experience of the Ligabue Research Centre, founded in 1978-1979. It is precisely this 'young maturity' that has enabled the Foundation to achieve the highest level of its first major public appearance with an exhibition of special interest. The title indicates a path, in some ways quite unusual, that has come to propose a series of research studies and materials that cover a broad time span of almost three thousand years following the thread of writing common to an area such as that of Mesopotamia, so rich with centuries of extraordinary civilization.
The exhibition, whose catalogue has been curated by our member Frederick Mario Fales, presents nearly 200 pieces including cuneiform tablets, cylinder seals, and other works from ancient Mesopotamia, which Giancarlo Ligabue collected at a time when slow and dedicated collection was an important value for specialists in the field. Precisely today, when the Middle East is subject to cultural destruction by acts of war, revising the masterly collection of antiquities Ligabue carried out for decades with wisdom and patience to document the written communication and legal endorsement through the finely carved seals, along with other valuable Mesopotamian artworks, can be an effective balm for humanists and scientists, as well as being capable of attracting the interest of children and young people.
Starting with the first writings and its antecedents, from the Sumerians and the cuneiform system we reach the stage in which those amazing ancient testimonies become a substantial part of modern culture, beginning with the pioneering writings such as those in the seventeenth century by Pietro Della Valle, up to the discovery in 1975 of Ebla, with its language and studies that continue to be effected. The field of investigation is broad and the materials illustrating it have an undoubted charm. For these reasons, the Istituto Veneto di Scienze, Lettere ed Arti is pleased that the exhibition will take place in the halls of its headquarters in Palazzo Loredan.
Seeing a child's hand holding a pencil that is moving for the first time on a sheet of paper in search of a kind of writing, is like watching dancing, flying, or running; which is then followed by moments of rest, reflection, and almost even anxiety.
If I have to imagine a young scribe struggling with cuneiform writing and other expressions that have been etched for thousands of years on clay and stones, I think of a tiny being who is creating. Imitating and creating, for that breath by the nerves in a hand are describing a reality of an existence that someone else will have to reinterpret.
This catalogue, and the exhibition it illustrates, was created with the same awe and with the desire to listen to the stories belonging to a child, or a teenager. These pages that Frederick Mario Fales and Roswitha Del Fabbro have wisely and patiently filled - along with Stefano de Martino, Paolo Matthiae, Pier Giorgio Odifreddi, and David I. Owen - are like a map, or watermark, of our Western feeling towards an understanding and an outlook on life.
These documents on clay or semi-precious stones, in fact, act as the voices of poets who also recorded what they have seen, the epics of their myths and heroes;togetherwiththelistsofgoodsthatwillendupondiningtables,ofmaterials forbuilding a house, and amulets forinvoking the gods' benevolence. There had been other times that I had travelled along the route of this map that 'Before the Alphabet' now proposes in a new and modern vision. I have done so with Giancarlo Ligabue who every once in a while would share a journey with a few friends that delved into ancient times: he knew how to interpret signs and symbols that seemed - in his narratives – to have been awakened from their millennial torpors to return to dialogue with us humans.
This catalogue – which the Giancarlo Ligabue Foundation has printed with Giunti Publishers, to whom we are very grateful for their intelligent collaboration - wants to revive those moments: a rediscovery of civilizations and cultures that return to having full contact with their heirs. At last, civilization is equipped with new words that historians and archaeologists have been able to discover and offer us. Those who have the time and the desire to come to know about a distant world that existed more than five thousand years ago, will be surprised because they will learn, quite vividly, of the matrix of events that they already know about, they will explore and envision those worlds that were recounted in the Bible or Greek mythology. Thinking back to those historical roots also means understanding the initial forms of those cultures that have passed through our world, developing themselves, as the great French historian Jean Bottéro explained in his essay 'The Birth of the West', reminding us that the texts of the Mesopotamian world contain “the first serious draft of that which, recovered, amplified, furthered, and organized later on by the Greek thinkers, will become the 'scientific spirit'; the first draft of the very sort of science and reasoning which still we hold dear”.

and ending in the Arabian-Persian Gulf - the aridity is extreme, with actual risks of desertification. Remedying these risks is the annual regime of the two rivers, which have courses in a north-south direction that are more or less parallel and with comparable water supplies. With the springtime melting of snow in the high mountains of Anatolia from which both the Euphrates and the Tigris originate, the water volume increases several scores of times compared to that in the hot season, and in their flow, the two rivers convey a mass of muddy sediment and mineral content. But whereas in the hilly area of north-cenral Mesopotamia, the rivers' precipitous descent has excavated over time deep gorges and narrow canyons in the limestone terrain, the slope becomes minimal (less than 20 meters above sea level) in the last 500 km of the alluvial valley. The consequence of this state of things is that, when the two streams are at full height, they excavate mighty natural levees in the land they flow through in this southern area; the land that collapsed from the levees themselves then makes the riverbed itself rise, so that the rivers flow virtually at the same height as the banks, thereby rather easily leading to a flooding of the surrounding lands. In fact, every three to four years, an extensive area of "high water" is created all around the river basins in the southern sector for the entire duration of the flood period (March-May), and the fertile river silt spreads for many square kilometers on flat clay soil. Basically, if the Greek historian Herodotus could say that "Egypt is the Nile's gift", it could equally be said with good reason that the Mesopotamian valley was actually created by the flow of the twin Rivers and their alluvial flooding during tens of thousands of years, before rushing (now merged into a single course, the Shatt el-Arab), through a marshy area and delta, into the Arabian-Persian Gulf. Therefore, the annual flooding of the two rivers was the essential premise and the main cause of the great development of agriculture (especially cereals and date palms) and of livestock breeding (mainly
Where and when: Mesopotamia
Frederick Mario Fales
The name Mesopotamia, or "land between the two rivers", is Greek and dates back to the historian Arrian (II cent. A.D.); arising possibly along the lines of antecedents in the Aramaic language, the term refers to the entire area between the river basins of the two major rivers, the Euphrates (to the west) and the Tigris (east). The region, which geologically is a tectonic basin created by contact between the Arabian shield and the Asian landmass and then filled by huge amounts of river sediments carried by the two rivers themselves, is bounded on the north by the Taurus and Anti-Taurus mountain ranges, on the south by the Arabian-Persian Gulf into which the two rivers flow, on the west by the low rise of the vast rocky desert Shamiya (or Syro-Arabian desert) and on the east by the many parallel ranges running northwest-southeast of the Zagros mountains, which ultimately end with a flat deep-set area called Khuzistan. Therefore, ancient Mesopotamia corresponds to today's political realities of the entirety of Iraq and Iraqi Kurdistan, as well as northeastern Syria and to a lesser extent in southern Turkey, western Iran and Kuwait. The inhabitants of Mesopotamia designated this region especially with reference to two territories of the oldest historical period (2700-2000 BC), when the country of Sumer - in the southern part of the alluvial valley created by the two rivers – was comparable to that of Akkad, to the north. In this sense, Mesopotamia offers the oldest example of a cultural region recognized and consciously defined by the local culture itself. The double name "Sumer and Akkad" remained in the tradition for millennia to indicate Mesopotamia as a whole and its fundamental unity of language and culture, even when the names of the principal states had changed by then: in the south, ever since 1900 BC there was Babylonia, with its homonymous religious and political capital Babylon on the Euphrates River, while in the north, in the same era Assyria arose, centered in the religious and political capital of Assur and subsequently in other political centers (including Nineveh) on the Tigris River. Assyrian-Babylonian civilization, as a set of common cultural traditions in their political, religious, and social reflexes, was ruled continuously by locally-born kings until the sixth century BC; then it still survived as a simple linguistic-cultural whole under foreign rulers (Persians, Seleucids, Romans) until disappearing for good in the first century. A.D.
Physical features
Although with obvious differences due to a North-South extension of almost 2,500 km, Mesopotamia as a whole has an arid continental variant of the Mediterranean climate, with winter rainfall between scarce and average and long warm and dry seasons (from March to November). In the northern areas – of piedmont, hills, and steppes – of Assyria, the presence of regular winter rainfall (and even snow) can guarantee a medium to high supply of rainwater, albeit with a fair degree of variation from one year to another. Instead, in the southern half of the area - the real flood plain covering approximately 700 km

sheep and goats) which made southern Mesopotamia an area that was prosperous and famous in antiquity, with well-developed cities and powerful states in times of both peace and war. This once again calls to mind Herodotus, who considered the Babylonian cereal farming to be a product of exceptional quality and yield. However, it will be necessary to take into account different physical-geographical problems that could be caused by the very flooding; and that only an intense and constant work by humans in defense of and for the development of the environment could hold it in check. To begin with, in spite of the common area of origin and the direction of flow, the two rivers have very different hydraulic systems. After emerging from the mountains of central Turkey, the Euphrates runs more slowly and meanders broadly across the arid steppes of Syria, joined by only two northern tributaries and losing a large proportion of its volume through evaporation. Instead, the Tigris, rising in the Taurus Mountains (Eastern Turkey), has a steeper, straighter course, receives additional water contributions from various tributaries originating in the Zagros Mountains and flows into climatically cooler areas, probably having a dense forest cover in ancient times. This very difference in regime of the two rivers has an effect on the timing of the flooding, with uncoordinated full riverbeds: the Tigris is the first to flood Lower Mesopotamia, because of its more rapid and impetuous flow, while the Euphrates can flood several weeks later. But in any case, it must be noted that the flooding takes place in spring, therefore too late to benefit crops and, in fact, precisely in the phase in which excessive water can damage the summer crops (March-September). Due to the flooding, a large part of human labor was therefore involved in controlling the water and its distribution for agricultural use in the following months. For example, on the main course of the rivers, it was essential to prevent or reduce the formation of meanders and spontaneous branching. If today the site of the great city of Akkad is not to be archaeologically retrieved, this could be due to a shifting of the bed of one of the two rivers - perhaps the Tigris - which caused its erosion and then obliteration over the millennia (Wall-Romana 1990). Moreover, the increasing heat which followed the spring floods
threatened to produce a rapid evaporation of the wet layer left on the countryside: to offset any harmful drying up (with the formation of a "veil" of salt on the surface of the ground), the water thus required means of transport , with the creation of canals of varying scope and length, catch and drainage basins, and a system of dams or locks for the progressive outflow, using the slight gradient of the plain (cap. 1, cap. 3). Thus water could be brought down to individual fields, which were often elongated and divided into deep furrows: once the percolation of water into the ground was over, seed was scattered regularly into these furrows by a seeder plow (apin in Sumerian texts, epinnu in Akkadian), using animal traction (cap. 148). The device allowed saving considerable labor, because by means of a funnel, the seeds fell directly into the furrow freshly dug by the tool, in time for the winter crop (from October until spring). All these works of macro- and micro-hydraulic engineering, which involved accurate excavations and constant efficiency controls, were carried out using the raw material found in the alluvial valley: the clay soil itself with which the Euphrates and the Tigris had been filled over millennia. Instead, massive stones, completely absent in the alluvial valley and only obtainable through long-distance trade, could not be used; and in place of flint, both expensive and hard to fashion, the ancient Mesopotamian people even came to even make their own agricultural scythes out of clay, until the diffusion of metals in a later era. As for wood, the only thing was to make use of the abundant and sturdy reeds, (for fences, roofing, baskets, mats, and various uses, even boats and huts; cap. 4; cap. 6; cap. 5; cap. 2), of the tree species growing beside the water (willows, poplars, etc.) and of the tall, sturdy date palms, full of useful parts for building (trunk and branches, bark, leaves, etc.) and as food. (cap. 10, cap. 7). Any other kind of wood - and especially the precious trunks of tall trees (spruce, cypress, cedar, pine, etc.) to be used for the beams of the largest buildings – had to be imported (or directly taken) from the outer regions and brought by overland or river transport (cap. 8). Thanks to extensive work undertaken by the individual communities or in collaboration for the management of flood waters and fertile silt, the whole plain of Lower Mesopotamia came to be covered by a

dense network of canals, which extended water supply to the many rural villages surrounding the cities, thus ensuring regular harvests year after year, and with them, a range of resources that were essential to their agro-pastoral livelihoods. And this agricultural hinterland, sufficiently prosperous in itself despite high labor costs, laid the economic and social foundations for the formation of the city and the state during the fourth millennium BC, with a revolutionary leap forward. But Mesopotamian man was always alert with regard to the dangers posed by the particular nature of the Land between the twin Rivers. Thus, in the mythical Babylonian poem Atrahasis, a famine sent by the god Enki causes terrible consequences in a short time for the people of the southern plain, including lack of flooding, crop failure, and widespread salinization of agricultural land:
« The flood did not [rise] from the depths. The womb of earth did not bear, Plant life did not come forth. People were not seen about, The black fields whitened, The broad plain was filled up with salts »
Irrigation by means of canals was also carried out in stretches, and with many more technical difficulties, in areas close to rivers within the current countries of Syria and Iraq, where people struggled to wrest farm
land from the surrounding steppe. But on the other hand the fringe areas far from the rivers and from the Mediterranean Coast of the so-called Fertile Crescent, including the northern part of the steppe between the Twin Rivers (the area known as Jezirah in Arab, "the island") and the adjacent areas of northwest Syria, as well as the foothills of the northeastern Mesopotamia, practiced dry farming instead, which used only the rainfall for the cultivation of cereals and horticultural products (olives, pistachio nuts, legumes), also allowing viticulture in the highest areas. The minimum requirement for a successful harvest of barley is 200 millimeters of annual rainfall. However, the largest settlements are located mainly within areas that get at least 300 mm of rainfall. In essence, for long millennia prior to the recent industrial era, the agricultural system of Mesopotamia suffered structurally from the extensive rainfall fluctuations that could characterize climatically different years, and the ancient texts very often tell of entire regions marred by famine, which forced farmers to indebtedness or, alternatively, to abandon their fields and houses, and undertake a nomadic lifestyle.
A “bird's-eye” view of ancient Mesopotamia (ca. 3000-300 BC)
The proto-urban society that, around 3200 BC, produced the first form of writing in Mesopotamia, was already set up as a social and economic whole of remarkable structure and development, as we know from archaeological data. It brought to fulfilment a wide range of technical and social transformations that developed during the Neolithic period (VII-IV millennium): from the first results of irrigated agriculture, to the domestication of many animal species for domestic use, to the creation of craftsmanship for many different practical and ceremonial purposes, to the formation of the village as a site for community identity and as the nucleus of the working and cultural collectivity, with its small houses with a simple tripartite floor plan - in rectangular adobe bricks of clay mixed with straw - arranged according to a mutual protection scheme. The first and most important city in this period was Uruk, located on the Lower Euphrates, which extended over an area of 250 hectares and could accommodate up to 50,000 residents. It was organized into two official quarters at its center: to the west was the area of the so-called "White Temple", to the east lay what will be later called "Eanna", sepa

In the marshes of southern Mesopotamia, there were impressive structures built with reeds, which are frequently represented on seals and other art forms, such as the stone vessels. Their modern counterparts are called mudhīf, typical of the southern Iraq. These are large collective buildings, used by guests or as venues for weddings, funerals, etc. The larger reeds are tied together to form columns and then bent to create arches, which constitute the load bearing structure.

- Shuruppak). Socially, the city-states would appear to have developed from the oldest tribal communities, to which a political structure was superimposed; a certain sense of "clan" would thus have remained rooted in the population, although already subservient to functions imposed by the state. This would also explain why, at the religious level, each of these states “belonged” to a local god, who resided in the main temple (cap. 9); through its representatives, the priests, the deity appointed a ruler for the management of public affairs, especially for the control of the subsistence agriculture and the boundaries with other territories. In essence, the positions of king or supreme priest likewise appear to have arisen alike from the elite of a landed aristocracy of patriarchal foundations. Moreover, from an economic point of view, the city-states can be seen as "great organizations", which gained resources from the confiscation of agricultural surpluses in the surrounding countryside, and then took care to redistribute such goods to the class of the court specialists. On the whole, one can speak of a phase of generalized development for Mesopotamia in the Early Dynastic period including territorial expansion, increased work and technological subdivision, population growth, and the overall increase in revenue. The most famous cities of this period, from the historical or archaeological point of view, are primarily Kish, which fought against Uruk and challenged Elam on the east. Then we know of Ur, the site of the famous royal tombs, with its rich pottery, carved seals, furniture, musical instruments, and chariots; these tombs attested to the custom, almost unknown elsewhere, of collective burials. There was also Lagash, a land of vast extent (17 cities and 8 secondary settlements, with about 100,000 inhabitants), which under King Ur-Nanshe started a conflict with neighboring Umma over the possession of the rich pastures of the Gu'edenna district, with a first solution achieved through arbitration by Mesilim, king of Kish. As for the kings of Lagash, we know of Eannatum (ca. 2450 BC) who waged war all the way to Mari on the Middle Euphrates and conquered Elam; his famous "Stele of the Vultures" was the first public monument of historical narrative in bas-relief depicting the victory over Umma. Lastly, Urukagina was the king known for his enactment of a group of edicts of social reform, in which - for self-legitimation purposes - the pre-existing negative order was countered with a more "just" one, inaugurated by the current ruler (cap. 114). The text thus deals with the revocation of the former kings' usurpations which were harmful to the city's god;
rated by high walls from the rest of the urban complex. The buildings of Eanna were vast, with very diverse floor plans; innovative construction techniques and elegant décor came to embellish the complex, which brought together many adjacent structures from different periods, often rebuilt or expanded. The Eanna was initially identified merely as a place of worship, but today it tends to be seen as the first expression of a distinct political power, i.e. as the oldest palatial building in Mesopotamia. Therefore, The urban spaces of Uruk suggest all the features of an assemblage centered on administration and on the local economy and commerce, where the population had mostly given over agricultural production to the village outskirts and surrounding rural villages, diversified according to the need for irrigation or the transportation routes for commodities. Uruk is the oldest seat of political power, exercised with heterogeneous instruments (from peaceful annexation to war) and managed through a class of adepts (civil or military) according to an already complex social stratification; it can essentially be seen as the prototype for many later “royal” or capital cities of the Mesopotamian world (Liverani 1986). The subsequent history of Mesopotamia unfolds for over three thousand years; precisely this vast chronological extension makes it very difficult to render concise and understandable summaries. Nevertheless, here below, in the sections divided accordingly for the three millennia BC (13), we will attempt to show how the texts in cuneiform handwriting illuminate ever broader geographical and political horizons for each of the successive chronological phases.
The third millennium BC
The texts following the Late Uruk era, dotted with scattered archives from the pre-dynastic or Pre-Sargonic era (ca. 2700-2300 BC), have a politically fragmented and still rather small geographical horizon: Lower Mesopotamia (from present-day Baghdad to the Persian Gulf) with its many neighboring city-states and their surrounding agricultural areas, while areas further north along the Twin Rivers or to the east, beyond the Tigris appear, at least initially, as mere appendages of this area. In this culturally and religiously unified "land of Sumer," the various citystates formed a political horizon with peer-polity interactions, although individual states could attain temporary hegemonies or preferential groupings (eg. the "Hexapolis" of Uruk - Adab - Nippur - Lagash - Umma

However, Lugalzaggesi was in turn overthrown by a usurper, possibly from his own court, who deliberately bestowed upon himself the significant name of "legitimate king", Sharrum-kinum (Sargon in common usage) and resided in the city of Akkad or Agade, not far from Kish. In accordance with his name, Sargon was able to present himself in his texts as a monarch blessed by the gods and the proper successor of his defeated enemy. With the rise to power of the Akkadian dynasty, of Semitic language (ca. 2330-2150 BC), an imperial structure regarding territorial planning and forms of control came to be created for the first time in Mesopotamia: there was a central core and its external provinces, provided with a unitary scheme of administrative management. The military and economic expansion of the State outside of Mesopotamia by Sargon and then continued by his grandson Naram-Sin – to Susa in Elam, in Upper Mesopotamia on the Tigris (Assur, Nineveh), and in the steppe along the Habur River, even with raids in western Syria, in Ebla and in Arman (modern-day Aleppo) - led to the creation of some permanent nuclei of Akkadian settlers and perhaps also to a first colony of merchants that settled in Susa. The dynasty of Akkad fell around 2150 BC due to the invasion of populations from the north-eastern mountains: the Gutians (defined in Sumerian texts as subhuman barbarians) and perhaps other political-military groups from Iran, such as from Anshan. A brief period followed when local "principalities" appeared to flourish in the southern part, such as the able ensi (ruler) Gudea of Lagash, who inspired a vast legacy of statuary and texts (cap. 11). Shortly after the principality of Gudea came the formation of a new polity of imperial character, less extensive but economically far more intense than the previous one: the third Ur dynasty (ca. 2110-2004 BC). The founder of the dynasty, Ur-Namma, hailed from Uruk (cap. 12). But the actual construction of the Ur empire was the work of his successor
with the control of abuses against the lower classes, the weak, and the underprivileged; and with the exemption from tax obligations and debts decreed for the people of Lagash. In this sense, the actions of Urukagina were the forerunners of similar measures of reform and amnesty equally implemented for purposes of political propaganda by the kings of the second millennium (eg. The “Code of Hammurabi”). However, Urukagina's state suffered a serious military and political setback by the ruler Lugalzaggesi of Umma (mid-century 24th), who destroyed Lagash, devastating the Ningirsu temples. Then Lugalzaggesi went on to occupy Uruk and subjugated many other centers, such as Nippur, Ur, Larsa, Adab, and Eridu, and depending on the case, took on various royal or priestly titles. We also know that he led commercial expeditions to the Mediterranean, bringing back valuable timber, which was rare in his land. The ambitions of this king were clearly of a pan-regional order.

Shulgi (2094-2047 BC). Having avoided the risk of an ideological crisis of the subsequent dynasty after his father died and having steadily consolidated his throne, also with shrewd political marriages (i.e. giving his daughters in marriage to foreign kings or high-ranking members of the local élite), the king effected rapid territorial expansion of the kingdom starting with the 20th year of his reign, especially to the east of the Tigris and southwestern Iran, beginning to incorporate those territories in the State of Ur. Already in the 21st year of his reign, the king then introduced some social measures that in fact made the entire population dependent upon the Crown. That change, in turn, brought about a deep economic and administrative reorganization of the kingdom. Shulgi died at the end of the 48th year of his reign, also leaving a rich literary tradition, full of hymns of praise to his own person, which was also deified. Under the reign of two of his many children, who followed one another onto the throne of Ur, first Amar-Su'en (2047-2039) and then Shu-Su'en (2038-2030), their father's imperial policy was continued, although there were increasing external threats to the empire, especially by the semi-nomadic bands of the Amorites coming from Upper Syria and upper Mesopotamia. Shu-Su'en came to erect a wall between the Tigris and the Euphrates (muriq Tidnim) against them, as we know from a dating formula related to this king (cap. 13). But the region of Susiana to the east also created political problems: therefore trusty Zarriqum was named its governor in order to deal with them. The two sons of Shulgi continued the organizational work of administration begun by their father, in the main center of Umma on a canal to the east of the Euphrates, in the more northerly Puzrish-Dagan (today Drehem), in Lagash, and in other sites. The decadence of Ur began and became complete under their successor Ibbi-Suen (2029-2006): for internal reasons and hostile pressures from outside, from year to year a progressive defection of the main provincial centers took place, and the letters exchanged between the king and Ishbi-Erra, commander of the city of Isin, record the acquisition of an increasingly autonomous status by the latter, while in the background there was increasing pressure from the social groups of the Amorites, people of pastoral origin. Finally, Ishbi-Erra became king of Isin, thus inaugurating an independent dynasty; meanwhile the ruler of Ur also lost
Nippur, an important cultural and religious center. At the end, Ibbi-Suen remained solely at the head of the region surrounding the capital; but in 2006 BC, Elam undertook a punitive expedition against Ur, which was completely destroyed, while the king was taken prisoner.
The second millennium
The next millennium began with a radically changed situation: the fragmentation of the third Ur empire brought back to center stage the political rivalry among the kingdoms in southernmost Mesopotamia. Thus, Ishbi-Erra undertook various construction activities in his royal palace in Isin, and with the expulsion of the Elamites from Ur, extended his dominion over central and southern Mesopotamia. But the dynasty of Isin, while proclaiming to represent the imperial continuity with that of Ur, was not the only one in this new phase of political disintegration and territorial fragmentation (“intermediate period”) following the fall of the third dynasty of Ur. In parallel, a dynasty founded by a certain Naplanum came to power in Larsa, on a tributary of the Euphrates in the area between Uruk and Eridu. The dynasty of Larsa, like that of Isin, would play an important role in the Mesopotamian scenario until the eighteenth century. Other dynasties also had their origins in this same phase, in Eshnunna in the center-north and in Der, in the area bordering Elam. Thus began the political growth of the city-states located in areas on the borders of the traditional Mesopotamian playing ground, from Mari in the Middle Euphrates to Ashur/Assur on the north-central Tigris. A re-consolidation of the political spectrum around a small number of states progressively took place between the nineteenth and eighteenth centuries BC. At Larsa, the old ruling dynasty of Gungunum was subverted by an Amorite, called "sheikh of Yamutbal", even though his name was Elamite, Kudurmabuk (Steinkeller 2004: 30-34): he put his son on the throne, who was succeeded by his brother Rim-Sin. His reign, lasting sixty years (1822-1763), was the pinnacle of the political and cultural development of Larsa. Under Rim-Sin, many irrigation work were executed and significant territorial conquests were achieved. Uruk fell in 1801; Isin was subjugated in 1793. Thus, in this phase, Larsa had taken complete control of southern Mesopotamia. However, once more, its development

Gudea (2144-2124 B.C.), son of Ur-Baba, is one of the best-known figures in Mesopotamian history by virtue of the multitude of historiographic and celebratory texts drafted by him, which the French excavations at Telloh unearthed by chance. His inscriptions, also engraved on diorite statues representing Gudea himself in the round, attest to a variety of public works undertaken in Lagash (and specifically in the 'holy city' of Girsu): excavations of canals and hydraulic works; urban adjustments; the manufacture of cultic objects and apparel and, above all, the erection of shrines. The chief effort by the ensi was the reconstruction and inauguration of the eninnu, the temple of Ningirsu, main god of the city. For this deed, Gudea claimed to have entertained business relations with many surrounding areas, some of which were considerably far away: from Dilmun in the Arabian Gulf to Anshan and Elam on the high plateau to the east of Mesopotamia; from south-central Kimash to Barme in today's Kurdistan; from the Middle Euphrates up to northern Syria (Urshum and Ebla); and from the Amanus mountain range to that of the Taurus. In addition, he traveled extensively in the areas adjacent to his own to consult the gods of other Sumerian cities on the feasibility of his building project. On the other hand, any mention of bellicose activities is absent from the many inscriptions by Gudea, which have moreover been preserved in numerous duplicates. The dynasty of Gudea continued for several decades, until the absorption of Lagash as a province in the Ur III period.

raid against Babylon by the Hittite king Murshili I (ca. 1620-1590). The Hittite state had already reached a high level of military efficiency, which allowed for expeditions and raids even outside the borders of Anatolia. The expedition against Babylonia does not seem to have had particular consequences for the Hittites themselves. But it had implications on the south-central Mesopotamian scenario, where the Kassite dynasty settled and remained throughout the following "middle age", until 1160 BC. Around 2000 BC, after the fall of Ur, and of which it had just been a remote provincial town, the city-state of Assur, built on a steep spur on the middle Tigris and centered on the worship of a deity of the same name, intercepted trade routes that were still in progress, by organizing the redistribution of raw materials and/or finished products from its western
to the north was blocked by two other major kingdoms: the state of Eshnunna on the Diyala river, an old ally of Elam and considered dangerous by Assyria, by Mari, and even by Yamkhad (Aleppo); and the state of Babylonia. It was actually the latter that caused the final fall of Larsa under its most effective king, Hammurabi. The rise of Hammurabi (1794-1750) took place in two main phases: first of all, he obtained the neutralization of Rim-Sin, with the capture of Uruk and Isin, making himself in fact master of the southern sector of the floodplain; in the late part of his reign, he then made his move against a weakened Eshnunna and expanded his borders beyond central and southern Mesopotamia. This rise is reflected, albeit in a nutshell, in the "dating formulas" that comprised the chronological backbone of the kingdom for administrative purposes, and as such, were attested on every practical document of the period. These short sentences thereby bear witness to the fortification of the Babylonian cities in 1776; to the defeat of a coalition including Elam, Assyria, and Eshnunna in 1764; to the final conquest of Larsa after a siege of several months in 1763; and to the destruction of Mari and the defeat of the local king Zimri-Lim, who had come to power after the end of the Assyrian domination in 1759. Even in his later years, Hammurabi tried in vain to conquer Assyria: that was ruled by the mighty Shamshi-Adad I (1810-1782 BC), who - with the title of "King of all" - had formed a comprehensive political and territorial structure between the northern Tigris and Euphrates, that was continued after the his death by his weak son Ishme-Dagan. However, at the height of its power, the kingdom of Babylonia controlled virtually the whole of Mesopotamia, up to areas quite remote from the capital such as Mari and Tuttul on the north-central Euphrates, and substantial parts of the upper Tigris. Under Shamshi-ditana, one of Hammurabi's successors (1625-1594), came the sudden political collapse of the dynasty. Due to a set of factors and events that are not fully understood, the beneficiaries were the Kassites, a population coming from the Iranian plateau and which had slowly gained strength in the north-eastern part of Mesopotamia. The Kassites' conquest of the state of Babylonia was further helped by a victorious

It may be noted that the findings in the Luristan deposits also included inscriptions (equally on metal cups) much older than this one; in fact, known are texts related to the kings of the Akkad Dynasty, such as Naram-Sin (2254-2218), Sharkalisharri (2217-2193) and, later on, from the Gutian period, such as Elulu (2192-2190) and Shu-turul ( 2168-2154).
Ur-Namma was from Uruk and perhaps came from a cadet branch of the royal family; he assumed the title of 'King of Sumer and Akkad', typical of his city of origin, and established his dynasty in the city of Ur, aiming to free himself from the power of Elam in the more northern and southern areas. He was a fervent devotee of the gods and the executor of great temple constructions in various cities as well as extensive work on the canal system, but he did not seem to have greatly expanded the territory of his country. The 'Sumerian King List' (cf. ch. 7b) assigns 18 years of reign to him, of which at least 13 are well documented by administrative texts. Instead, a literary text (The death of Ur-Namma) recounts his death in battle and that his body was not recovered for burial, an event considered seriously inauspicious (Frayne 1997; Dahl 2007).

Gulf, under Ulam-Buriash (1496-1474); later, it began a long and complex 'standoff' with the nearby Assyrian power. During the 15th and 14th centuries, the Kassite kings established various relations at the international level: Kurigalzu I (1435-1406) was responsible for remarkable achievements in the sphere of foreign policy by concluding inter-dynastic marriages with the Egyptian pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty and the Elamite kings, and important achievements in the construction sector, especially regarding the founding of a new capital, Dur-Kurigalzu, built to control the roads leading to the Iranian area. However, the dynasty's military and political activities were later limited to Mesopotamia and nearby Elam: although Kurigalzu II (1351-1327) resisted Assyrian oppression and defeated the Elamites by storming their capital Susa, the Assyrian king Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243-1207) managed to conquer Babylon twice, deporting the Kassite king Kashtiliash IV. The last fifty years of the Kassites' dominion was marked by a recovery of power and by public works (under Melishipak, ca. 1180); but the Elamite king Shutruk-nakhkhunde took advantage of the lull in warring with a rapid invasion and seized the major cities, putting his son on the throne, and gradually conquering the country (ca. 1160). The military ups and downs of the Kassite kingdom were mirrored by those of Assyria where, after a period of anarchy following the reign of Ishme-Dagan, for much of the fifteenth century the ruling dynasty was a vassal of the Hurrian empire of Mittani, which came to control, directly or indirectly, the vast area between the Mediterranean and the Upper Tigris. It was only after the victory over the state of Mittani by the Hittite king Shuppiluliuma I (1380-1346), that Assyria gradually emerged as a member of the "club of great powers" (Liverani 2000) in competition with each other in the Near East scenario. The backbone of the kingdom was a new ruling class with military and administrative functions, which drew its supremacy precisely from large landed property (cap. 15), under the aegis of a king newly endowed with strong political, religious, and legal powers. Having warded off the attempts of the last kings of Mittani to regain lost power, under Assur-uballit (13631328), the Assyrians inaugurated a phase of diplomatic and political relations on an international scale; Adad-nirari I (1305-1274) ushered in a period of military expansion, confronting the populations of the Iranian highland, the nomads of the Syrian steppe, and the Kassite neighbors. Then, on the occasion of the emergence of the Hurrian state of Khanigalbat, the successor to Mittani, Adad-nirari went as far as Carchemish on the Upper Euphrates, taking the enemy king prisoner and freeing him only upon the promise of vassalage. However, during a subsequent rebellion Khanigalbat was reduced to a province of the Assyrian kingdom, by then in the process of significant expansion. Territorial expansion continued under Shalmaneser I (1273-1244), who led victorious wars throughout the neighboring area, against the rising power of Nairi-Urartu, the new nomadic groups of the Akhlamu and a Hittite-Hurrian coalition. His successor Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243- 1207) brought the Middle Assyrian kingdom to its zenith, developing a system of provinces placed both to the east and the west of the Tigris, from which abundant offerings rained down with regularity - in the form of taxes and donations – to the royal palace and the temple of Assur. He led successful campaigns against the Hittites and their Syrian allies (Amurru, Ugarit, etc.); although, at the end, the Euphrates remained as a mutual boundary. Likewise prestigious was his double conquest of Babylon (see above), over which Tukulti-Ninurta ruled for seven years. However, shortly after the Kassites regained independ
neighbor Iran or from Babylonia to the lands to the northwest, and in the Anatolian region of Cappadocia. Thus, a broad commercial network came into being, gravitating around the “entrepot” (karum in Akkadian) of Kanesh - today Kültepe, near Kayseri - where the Assyrians settled, developing an unceasing caravan traffic along the approximately 800 km of routes from their country of origin for about two centuries, and founding a number of other commercial colonies, set in a radial pattern, in the Anatolian territory. Written sources concerning this phase have come almost exclusively from Kanesh: about 23,000 tablets of letters and commercial or legal documents were unearthed in the excavation of the entrepot a century ago. The texts indicate that the homeland Assur (called alum, "the city" par excellence), which had gradually become very prosperous from the proceeds of Anatolian trade, was ruled by a king with administrative functions on behalf of the tutelary deity and urban assembly, formed by the owners of the major merchant houses; the King and the Assembly also imparted directives to the Kanesh settlers. Through their warehouses in Anatolia, the Assyrians aimed at getting closer to the sources of metal which characterized the micro-Asian plateau and especially the silver and gold mines; they also imported Anatolian wool in abundance. In return, they provided the Anatolians with elaborate clothing and, above all, precious tin – a metal not found in Asia Minor – to be alloyed with copper for bronze objects. There are many kinds of documents attesting to the complexity of trade management, from transportation contracts to letters entrusting sums of silver (cap. 14), to correspondence relating to commercial lawsuits in the Assyrian courts (cap. 16). The period of Old Assyrian occupation of Kanesh extended over two separate phases. One much older set of Assyrian tablets refers to approximately 80 years in the nineteenth century BC. The site of the entrepot, outside the indigenous village of Kanesh, was later destroyed and rebuilt 30 years afterward: in fact, associated at corresponding levels are texts from the reigns of Shamshi-Adad I and his son Ishme-Dagan. However, the later period was little more than a pale shadow of the previous commercial flowering: and, moreover, the imperial attempt made by Shamshi-Adad I floundered under his successor Ishme-Dagan, who was soon reduced to ruling only the territory of Assyria. The central and final centuries of the second millennium BC had a much broader panorama than in previous ages: the political, economic, and cultural relations would then take place on a scenario that went beyond Mesopotamia and Syria and that included the entire Near East, from the Egyptian delta to the Anatolian and Iranian plateaus. This vast system of factual and ideological interrelations is reflected in the various sources of documentary archives, in different scripts and languages: there are different perspectives and information on the period from Boghazköy/ Hattusha, the Hittite capital, from the urban locations dominated by the Hurrian state of Mittani (from Nuzi to the east of the Tigris up to Alalakh on the Mediterranean), from the diplomatic archive of the Pharaohs in the Egyptian site of Tell el Amarna, and finally, from the Hittite dependence of Emar on the Euphrates and from the coastal city of Ugarit, as well as numerous smaller towns, which require careful data correlation for the complete reconstruction of this "international age". By contrast, the two states of Mesopotamia were above all devoted to local interests and reduced to a minor diplomatic prestige, especially during the early part of this period. In Babylonia, the Kassite dynasty first of all took possession of the whole region, up to the Persian

Tukulti-Ninurta II (890-884). But the passage to a real pre-imperial formation took place during the ninth century BC with the reign of Ashurnasirpal II and Shalmaneser III (cap. 19). After the death of Shalmaneser III, his son Shamshi-Adad V (823-811) finally got the better of an internal revolt, also thanks to Babylonian support. However, he later raged militarily against the throne of Babylonia, plunging that area into a long period of political chaos. In the early years of the reign of the very young king Adad-nirari III (810-783), the helm of the state was taken by his mother Sammu-ramat (who became legendary as Semiramis), with the help of some of the kingdom's Magnates. This king and his three sons and successors (up to Assur-nirari V, 754745) continued the expansionist drive against the feisty Aramaic states of Arpad and Damascus. Meanwhile, Urartu dangerously expanded its sphere of influence in northern Syria. Tiglath-Pileser III (745-727) ascended to the throne after a coup and a rebellion in Kalhu in 745, and moved quickly against the most difficult fronts. After a victorious pitched battle with the Urartian army for hegemony in Syria, he marched against Arpad, which was conquered in 740 after a three-year siege. The Syrian area and the Levant still remained a hotbed of anti-Assyrian revolts, requiring more retaliatory expeditions: first against the Phoenician cities, then to help Judah which was attacked by Israel and Damascus, and then to destroy the latter. On the eastern front, the king carried out sorties in the land of the Medes, bringing back rich spoils; but above all, he threatened Urartu right in its own territory, laying siege to the capital Turushpa on Lake Van. In Babylonia, the king led extensive campaigns against the Chaldean chieftain Mukin-zeri, even
ence, the able ruler was killed in a palace coup. After a period of dynastic crisis, the Middle Assyrian kingdom had one last blaze of power under Tiglath-pileser I (1114-1087 BC) who went beyond the Euphrates and reached the Mediterranean with his army. However, later on the Assyrian kings had to fall back entirely from the steppe of the Jezirah, where numerous armed formations of the Akhlamu-Aramean people, of clearly nomadic origin, were advancing.
The First Millenium
Starting in the late thirteenth century BC, a social and economic crisis of vast proportions had led to the fall of the system of empires and citystates that had characterized the ''international age": the Egyptian empire retreated from the Asian chessboard, the Hittite empire was fragmented into a series of small ("Neo-Hittite") states in southern Anatolia and upper Syria, while the Levant reorganized itself around new political and cultural groupings, such as the allied coastal cities of Phoenicia and, further south, the Philistines (a population of recent arrival among the "sea peoples" described by the Egyptians). The crisis - possibly linked to climate issues - would seem to have struck Mesopotamia with some delay: certainly, for about two centuries Assyria was reduced to its original territories around the Tigris, while many small Aramaic states were formed on the plain between the Tigris and the Euphrates. Resumption of offensive and expansion began under Adad-nirari II (911891), thanks to victories in both the north-east and to the west almost up to the banks of the Euphrates; his conquests were consolidated by

The sources already mention Sennacherib (704-681 BC) dating from from 715 or so, when the twenty-year old Crown Prince assisted his father in domestic and foreign policy. Once he sat on the throne, he had to cope with a perceived cosmic negativity connected to the death of his father within the palace and, in the Empire, with the outbreak of numerous anti-Assyrian rebellions. In Babylonia, he had to deal with tough Marduk-apal-iddina, until he finally defeated him in 700. In the Levant, the states not yet reduced to provinces were the theater of many uprisings. In 701, the king marched against Ashkelon, which was at the head of the uprising, placing new dynasties in power; the same fate befell Ekron, whose inhabitants had delivered up their pro-Assyrian king to Hezekiah of Judah and appealed to the Egyptian forces. The latter were defeated in a pitched (yet difficult) battle at Eltekeh and Ekron was returned to its king Padî. Lachish was besieged and Jerusalem was subjected to a military bloc until the surrender of Hezekiah, who gave in to renewed vassalage, upon payment of a massive tribute. Having reestablished the imperial situation which had been accomplished by his father, Sennacherib turned to building works in the Assyrian homeland and especially around Nineveh, where he had moved the imperial capital. Construction of the “Palace Without Rival" began there around 700 and ended almost a decade later. Even more impressive was the engineering feat of conveying water from the surrounding region for the city's water supply (Fales - Del Fabbro 2014). But the Chaldeans had by now reached widespread hostility: in 694, they captured the crown prince Ashur-nadin-shumi, who had been on the Babylonian throne for six years. Harsh reprisals followed that culminated in the siege, fall, and destruction of Babylon: an event which was considered sacrilegious by contemporaries. The end of his reign - also marked by revolts in mountain areas and in the Levant, backed by Egypt - was precipitated by the dynastic choice in favor of his youngest son Esarhaddon, which led to a revolt by his other sons, culminating in the assassination of the king - an event that was even remembered in the Old Testament.
taking up at the end the crown of the southern country himself, with an institutional innovation. The reign of his son Shalmaneser V (726-722) was short and marked by internal revolts against the king's tax policy. In the wake of this discontent, another son of Tiglath-Pileser usurped the throne, with the important dynastic name of Sharru-Kinu, like the ancient king of Akkad; he is traditionally indicated according to the biblical version of the name (Sargon). This king (722-705 BC) completed the siege begun by his predecessor in Samaria, the capital of the kingdom of Israel, and also reduced the status of the Aramaic state of Hama to province. Then his attention turned towards Urartu, where the king Rusa was trying to extend its influence on the scenario of the Zagros Mountains. After restoring dynastic legitimacy in the land of the Manneans as an anti-Urartian measure, Sargon organized a defensive line of Assyrian strongholds in the southern Zagros; then, in 714, he led an extensive campaign directed against the eastern vassals of Rusa, and then against the Urartian forts on Lake Urmia. During the return march, he ransacked the buffer state of Musasir where the Urartians had their main temple. There were extensive north-west campaigns in the following years, tuening into provinces the territories that were already tributaries, especially Carchemish. In Babylonia, the resumption of military intervention (710) opened a conflict against the Chaldeans and Elamites that would continue uninterrupted for forty years or so. After a series of lightning victories over the head of the Chaldeans, Marduk-apal-iddina, Sargon resumed the crown and resided in the region until 707, personally supervising the local administrative reorganization. Upon his return home, Sargon was present at the entrance of the deities in the temples of the new capital Dur-Sharruken ("Fortress of Sargon"), whose foundations had been placed in 717 and which had cost the entire empire an enormous amount of energy. Then the city was inaugurated and the New Year's Feast of 705 took place there in great pomp. But a few months later the king fell during an expedition in Anatolia and his body was not recovered to be returned to the homeland.

Meanwhile the division of the empire, which had brought Shamashshumu-ukin onto the Babylonian throne, collapsed after fifteen years, because the state of the south did not have a completely independent status, but at best, was a privileged vassal kingdom, or an important protectorate, of Assyria. So in 652, Shamash-shumu-ukin rebelled; both the "Sealand", where a nephew of the head of the Chaldeans, Marduk-apal-iddina, reigned, and Elam – the theater of various dynastic struggles – as well as diverse western polities (Syria, Nubia, the Arabs) allied themselves with the rebel. On the contrary, the Assyrians' allies included the southern cities of Ur and Uruk, as well as a part of the Chaldeans, the Arameans and the old "Akkadian" population in the region. After initial losses, the Assyrian counterattack focused on Nippur (reconquered by Ashurbanipal at the end of 651 BC); Babylon itself then came under siege (late 650). In 649, the progress of the war began to turn in favor of the Assyrians, and all the major rebel cities were placed under siege. The fall of Babylon took place in the summer of 648, and Shamash-shumu-ukin perished in the fire of his own palace. Punishment of the rebels was extremely severe: in particular, the heart of Elam was struck by the destruction and systematic plundering of its capital Susa, and even the desecration of the royal tombs. Thus fell a plurimillennial kingdom that had always been hostile to Mesopotamia. But other political entities of the Iranian plateau were ready to take its place: not only the Medes, hitherto mere vassals of Assyria, but also Parshumash, ruled by Kurash (maybe Cyrus I, ancestor of the founder of the Achaemenid dynasty, Cyrus II), which for the moment preferred to send tribute to the Assyrian king. After the defeat of his rebellious brother, the final part of Ashurbanipal's reign is poorly documented, both in official materials and in everyday documents. The reign of this king supposedly lasted 42 years, or up to 627 BC; but there is mention of him in texts from Nippur only until the 3rd month of 631. Therefore, it is possible that he had abdicated in favor of Ashur-etel-ilani, perhaps retreating to Harran. Perhaps as early as 630, three figures appear to have disputed the Assyrian throne: Ashur-etelilani, most certainly the son of Ashurbanipal, Sin-shumu-leshir, a chief eunuch, and Sinsharishkun, another son of Ashurbanipal who was on the throne at the time of the fall of Nineveh in 612. Emerging from this quarrel was a Babylonian soldier, Nabopolassar, who, after a series of
Esarhaddon ascended to the throne, supported by his mother Naqi'a/ Zakutu, after having defeated his brothers in pitched battle. His reign (680-669 BC) was marked by the work of massive reconstruction of Babylon and the surrounding major sacred cities to appease the wrath of the Chaldeans. There were only a few foreign policy interventions, and these were mostly regarding containment or control: so rebellious Sidon was destroyed and the king made a treaty of friendship with the King of nearby Tyre. A more massive military effort was aimed at extending the borders of the empire in Egypt in 673-672, ended with the chief enemy Taharqa escaping from Memphis and the division of territory between the Assyrian governors and local rulers, but triggered an immediate reaction in attempts at rebellion. Under the impetus of this substantial failure, or other personal and political factors, in 672, Esarhaddon decided to divide his crown between his two sons, designating Ashurbanipal at home and Shamash-shumu-ukin in Babylonia; the whole empire - governors, vassals, and categories of dignitaries - was called to sign an oath of loyalty to them in front of Ashur and the other great gods of Assyria; copies of this long text were found both in Assyria (Assur and Nimrud) and in the provinces (Kinalua on the Mediterranean). Perhaps as a reaction to this institutional innovation, in 670 there was a conspiracy by several Magnates, who were put to death by the king. Then Esarhaddon took once more the road to Egypt, where Assyrian rule was weak, but he fell ill and died on the journey in the late months of 669. A few weeks later, Ashurbanipal ascended to the throne, with the political support of his grandmother Naqi'a. The new ruler (668-627 [?]) normalized the situation in Egypt in the early years of his reign, ensuring the end of its dominance over the Nile Delta until 655, when Psammeticus I forced the Assyrians, by force of arms, to withdraw permanently from Egyptian territory. In the mountains around Mesopotamia, nomadic groups of Cimmerians (or Scythians) forced the rulers of Tabal and Hilakku (Cilicia), and also Gyges, king of Lydia, to ask Assyria for help; and the Manneans pressed against the Assyrian fortifications on the eastern fringes of the empire. Finally, a particular thorn in the side was Elam, which broke its good relations with Assyria and - under King Teumman - unleashed an attack in Babylonia, with the help of the Gambulu tribes on the Aramaic border. Ashurbanipal proceeded against Teumman in the 653, defeating him in a bloody battle on the Ulay River.

Foreigners residing there were granted extraterritoriality, and were legally dependent on their mother country while paying various taxes to the royal palace of Kanesh. In the Assyrian capital, not only the agents of the major merchants operating in Anatolia, but likewise the financiers behind the commercial enterprises themselves resided. The system involved the collaboration of many people (often linked in pools based on kinship or not) for the preparation of caravans at Assur, and once they had reached their destination after various legs of their journey, for the management of business in Kanesh.

news of Nabopolassar's death in Babylon on August 15, 605 BC reached his son on the Syro-Palestinian field of operations. Having returned to the capital by forced marches, Nebuchadnezzar "ascended the throne of the kingdom of Babylonia" and was recognized King on September 7 (cap. 18). Only a few months later, he set out once again for the western front, where he was constantly engaged in the following years. His commitment in Syria-Palestine, where the vassal kingdoms ranged between loyalty to the Babylonian king or to the Egyptian pharaoh, increased when the king of Judah Yehoyaqim refused to recognize Babylonian authority and to pay tribute in 598 BC. His response was harsh: Jerusalem was besieged and the young king Yehoyakin, who had succeeded his father after his death that same year, was defeated. The city fell on March 16, 597 BC and suffered heavy looting; the king, his family, and his court were deported to Babylon, along with part of the population and Zedekiah was placed on the throne of Judea. However, in 589 BC, the new Pharaoh Apries gave his support to a vast anti-Babylonian coalition including Phoenicians, Ammonites, and even the kingdom of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar's reaction was immediate: Jerusalem was besieged again and fell in 587 BC. The city was destroyed, the walls razed, and the city gates burned. Solomon's temple was set on fire and its furnishings plundered. The population suffered heavy deportations (known as "the Babylonian exile", which would last seventy years). Finally, in 568 BC, taking advantage of an internal crisis in Egypt, Nebuchadnezzar invaded the Nile Delta. His campaign, which was probably just demonstrative, nevertheless yielded the result of establishing the mutual border in Gaza, in Palestine. In essence, in the 43 years of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, the Neo-Babylon kingdom reached its greatest territorial expansion, extending over much of the Near East, "from the Upper Sea to the Lower Sea". The capital city Babylonia, also celebrated
skirmishes with the Assyrian forces, ascended to the throne of Babylonia in 626, ushering in a "Chaldean" dynastic line that would last for 87 years, until the Persian conquest. News regarding the end of Assyria have come to us from a single text, the so-called Babylonian Chronicle: in 616, Nabopolassar went up the Euphrates, leading raids all the way to the Balikh. It is likely that in this same period, the first functional alliance with the Medes arose. In the summer of 614, after an abortive attempt to attack Nineveh, the army of the Median ruler Cyaxares, son of Phraortes, descended the Tigris and reached the gates of Assur, and before the arrival of Nabopolassar from the south, managed to overcome the city. The Medo-Chaldean coalition still gathered in 612 and laid siege to the imperial capital Nineveh for three months; perhaps on the occasion of an Assyrian defensive sortie, a pitched battle led to the defeat of the besieged and the death of Sinsharishkun. His successor Ashur-uballit fled with his court to Harran, the last Assyrian stronghold in Upper Mesopotamia, but the city fell in 610 BC. Nabopolassar rightly boasted about it in an inscription, thus: “The Assyrian who ruled all the people from time immemorial, and who tormented the people with his heavy yoke; I (Nabopolassar) ....blocked him from Akkad and there I raised its yoke." The new Chaldean dynasty rapidly occupied Mesopotamia and Syria-Palestine; however, taking advantage of the political vacuum created in the latter region, the Pharaoh Necho, whose father Psammetichus had bequeathed him an Egypt that was reorganized and strong, attempted an Asian policy again, going as far as the strategic stronghold of Carchemish on the upper Euphrates, where a garrison was installed. Therefore, the clash with Nabopolassar was inevitable: in 607 BC, the two armies faced each other, but Carchemish fell only in 605 BC, when the Babylonian King gave the crown prince Nebuchadnezzar command of the army.

and the Fertile Crescent. However as this may be, in 543 BC the king returned to Babylon. But the political landscape had changed: the Persian King Cyrus II, who in around 550 BC had defeated the Medes, had become a real and present danger, having made conquests from Lydia up to the Indus Valley. And the Babylonian priests, hostile to Nabonidus, opened the gates of Babylon to Cyrus without a fight in 539 BC. Classical sources disagree on the fate of Nabonidus; but it is certain that, from then on, Mesopotamia would no longer be dominated by a king born in the country, nor would it be the primary focus of the imperial groups in the following centuries and in the millennia to come.

in some classical sources, reached a level of unusual splendor, with magnificent temples and palaces. The king died in 561 and ephemeral successors followed one another on the throne for five years. Finally, in 556, Nabonidus ascended to the throne. He did not belong to the Babylonian royal line and his family was originally from Harran in Upper Mesopotamia, where the Assyrian court had retreated after the fall of Nineveh. Having sought refuge in Babylonia after the end of Assyria, the family of Nabonidus must have achieved a prestigious position at court, which might not have been alien to the career of the future king; he appears to have also received a high-quality education at the scribal schools of the court (by the way, his name praises the god Nabû, patron of writing). Nabonidus ascended to the Babylonian throne when he was rather old and according to procedures that were not completely clear; however, he made reference to his predecessors in his commemorative inscriptions and his usurpation was legitimized as a manifestation of the will of the national god Marduk. He expanded his building activity in Southern Mesopotamia; it is interesting that he restored the temple of the moon god Nanna/Sin in Ur, consecrating his daughter as a priestess there. Even his military campaigns in the West in the early years of the kingdom were in the wake of the Chaldean tradition. But the references to his "Assyrian" origins were not lacking; and he gradually elevated the god Sin of Harran to the rank of supreme god. This move earned him the declared hostility of the clergy who were linked to the temples of Eanna and Ebabbar at Sippar. For this and other reasons, Nabonidus left Babylon in the fourth year of his reign, entrusting the management of the kingdom to his son Bel-sharusur, and went to the North Arabian oasis of Teima where he remained for seven years. Recent excavations have revealed large construction projects there (fortifications, a hydraulic system, etc.), which could indicate that the city was considered a true royal residence. His stay could have had foreign policy purposes, related to a deeper Babylonian penetration of Hijaz, aimed at control of the trade routes between Arabia

Brick with inscription in Akkadian cuneiform script
The inscription presents the royal titulary of Shalmaneser III of Assyria (859-824 BC) with mention of his father Ashurnasirpal II and his grandfather Tukulti-Ninurta II, and specifies that the brick itself comes from the support wall of the great ziggurat of Nimrud/Kalkhu, built by the king in the northwest corner of the citadel.
Provenience Kalkhu (Nimrud) Neo-Assyrian period (ca. 830 BC) Clay 16 cm x 34 x 6 cm
“Shalmaneser (III), great king, mighty king, king of totality, king of Assyria, son of Ashurnasirpal (II), great king, mighty king, king of totality, king of Assyria, son of Tukulti-Ninurta (II), king of totality, again king of Assyria: (Brick of the) support for the temple tower (ziggurat) of Kalkhu.”
The inscription specifies that the brick came from the supporting wall of the great ziggurat of Nimrud/Kalkhu, built by the king in the northwest corner of the citadel, for an extension of 60 square meters, with walls of stone (at the bottom) and baked brick (at the top). The building is still visible in its basic form and dimensions; it was not destroyed in the recent devastation at Nimrud/Kalkhu carried out by the Islamic State (2015-2016).
The king and his father, mentioned here, mark the passage of the Assyrian kingdom to an actual pre-imperial phase during the 9th century BC. Ashurnasirpal II consolidated his control of the borders already gainedv on the Upper Tigris and subjugated Zamua, the region east of the river, to protect trade routes to the Iranian area. However, his best efforts were lavished on the large bend in the Euphrates - strategically crucial for access to Syria where the armed resistance had its hub in the Aramaic state of Bit-Adini, governed by the skilful ruler Akhuni. The king eventually moved the political capital to Kalkhu, leaving the traditional center of Assur as the national religious capital.
His son Shalmaneser III accomplished the final defeat of Akhuni, and then - after acts of intimidation against the growing power of Urartu to the north-east – he invaded the Transeuphratic area with a huge army (853). Here he was stopped in the pitched battle of Qarqar by an equally large coalition led by the Aramaic states of Hama and Damascus. Successive campaigns in the Levant did not lead to the conquest of Damascus, the new focus of power in the area. In his later years, an internal revolt broke out in which the largest cities of the kingdom took part.

millennium BC, aided the penetration of the Mesopotamian floodplain in Syria not only by the Amorites, but also by the Hurrians. The presence of Hurrians in Syria became even more numerous after the collapse of the kingdom of Upper Mesopotamia founded by Samsi-Addu. Texts from the Old Assyrian, Old Babylonian, and ancient Hittite periods document the existence of polities held by rulers with Hurrian names: a king by the name Hurrian of Kuwari appears in the tablets of ancient Shusharra = Tell Shemshara (Eidem 2014); the mythological composition about the fall of the city of Ebla, known as the "Song of Liberation", mentions three rulers of Ebla who bore Hurrian names: Arib-Ebla, Paib-Ebla, and Eshebu-Ebla (Wilhelm 1997). Tablets from the archive of Kültepe, ancient Kanesh/Nesa, record a king with a Hurrian name, Anum-Hurbi, who reigned over the city of Hashshum, located in the region of the modern city of Gaziantep (Miller 2001). Sources from phase VII of Alalah testify to a substantial presence of Hurrians, who became even more numerous in the following phase IV. Hittite texts from the Old Kingdom tell us that the Hurrians, always called only with the ethno-linguistic character name Hurri in these sources, offered a continuous and fierce resistance aimed at stemming the advance of Hittite armies towards Syria.
The Kingdom of Mittani
The kingdom of Mittani was the main Hurrian polity; the first mention of Mittani comes from an Egyptian source, and dates from the time of Pharaoh Thutmosis I (at the beginning of the 15th century BC), but, presumably, this kingdom had been formed some decades earlier. The name Mittani means "(the country) of Mitta" and refers to the eponymous founder of the Mittani dynasty. This dynasty had originally acquired control of a polity in the upper Habur river valley; after the collapse of all the political structures of western Syria conquered by the first Hittite kings, and due to the inability of the latter to establish a stable form of domination over the conquered territories, the Mittani kings extended their dominion also over most of western Syria (de Martino 2014). Kings of the Mittani dynasty bore Indo-Aryan names. This aspect of the Mittani monarchy has attracted the attention of scholars for a long time; we can assume that Indo-Aryan groups directed towards the east stopped in the upper Habur area. Some leaders of these clans may have been hired as mercenaries by Syrian potentates fighting against the Hittites, thus acquiring financial resources and control of the territory; then they became assimilated with the Hurrians inhabiting the area and adopted their language (de Martino 2014). The choice to keep even later their Indo-Aryan dynastic names, one of the few fossil relics of the ancient ethno-linguistic origin of that dynasty, may have been motivated by a desire to emphasize a specific identity and a higher rank than those of the Hurrian rulers of the polities located in western Syria. Parattarna I was the first ruler of Mittani for whom we have documentary evidence; his successor Saushtatar was the Hurrian king who fou

The oldest evidence of a political entity ruled by a Hurrian dynasty has come from the Syrian site of Tell Mozan, in the upper Khabur River valley; this is where there was the ancient city of Urkesh, home to the most important sanctuary of the Hurrian god Kumarbi. Tupkish, the king of Urkesh, dating from during the XXIV century B.C. and documented by some seal impressions unearthed at Tell Mozan, had a Hurrian name (Buccellati - Kelly Buccellati 1996; 2001). He was succeeded by Tish-Adal, who left the oldest document in the Hurrian language (Wilhelm 1998). The fall of the reign of the Third Dynasty of Ur, at the end of the third

ght against the troops of Pharaoh Thutmosis III at Megiddo. At the time of Saushatar's reign, the Mittani kingdom controlled a vast territory that included the upper Habur – where lay the capital Washshukkanni, near the site of Tell Fekheriye (Bonatz 2014) – , southeastern Anatolia (Kizzuwatna), western Syria (Aleppo, Alalakh, Karkemish, Tunip, Nukhkhashshe, Qatna), and southern Syria (Terqa). These were not contiguous territories, but a network of mutually connected points of administrative and military control (von Dassow 2014). Under Artatama I, a contemporary of the Pharaoh Thutmose IV, began a phase of detente with Egypt, resulting in the first of three inter-dynastic mar
riages between Mittani princesses and the Pharaohs, aimed at strengthening the alliance signed between Mittani and Egypt. The Egyptian archive of Tell el Amarna preserves part of the correspondence between the Hurrian king Tushratta and the Pharaohs Amenhotep III and Amenhotep IV (Liverani 1999). In the mid-thirteenth century B.C., the Hittite king Shuppiluliuma I moved against Mittani and conquered it. He placed one of Tushratta's sons, prince Shattiwaza, on the throne. Mittani thus became a kingdom subordinated to the Hittites, and the other Syrians countries that had been part of the Mittani confederation also ended up under Hittite control. At the time of Shattuara I, the successor of Shattiwaza, the first conflicts began between Mittani and Assyria which, with King Shalmaneser I, took possession of a large part of Mitannian territory, taking it away from the Hittite kings and turning it into an Assyrian province (Wilhem 1989; de Martino 2006). With the end of the second millennium BC, and with the economic, political, and ethnic upheavals occurring in the eastern Mediterranean in the twelfth century BC, Mittani and the Hurrians disappeared from the political and ethno-linguistic landscape of the Near East.
Hurrian Mythology
The archives of the Hittite kingdom have preserved long and complex mythological compositions of Hurrian tradition, attested both in their original versions in Hurrian and in Hittite translations. The best known of these compositions is the one that relates the conflict between different generations of gods, represented by Kumarbi, deity of the oldest pantheon, and by the Storm God (Tešob), head of the new generation's gods. This cycle consists of several episodes: the Song of birth, which describes the miraculous birth of the Storm God who emerged from Kumarbi's skull, the Song of the deity LAMMA, the Song of the Silver God who wanted to replace the sun, the Song of the Sea, the Song of the Dragon Hedammu, and the Song of Ullikummi, the stone monster. In their original version in Hurrian, these narratives were written in verse and offer fabulous descriptions marked by highly inventive images. Some episodes of the Kumarbi Cycle show close similarities with the archaic Greek literary tradition and, in particular, with Hesiod's Theogony. We do not know if an echo of Hurrian literature had reached the Mycenaeans through the Hittites already in the second millennium B.C., or whether it survived in the first millennium B.C. and was spread throughout the Mediterranean by the Phoenicians (de Martino 2013).

(Iranian plateau and the Indus Valley) and to the West (Egypt), and even an actual colonisation on the Anatolian and Syrian Upper Euphrates and in South-western Iran, with settlements of remarkable sophistication and artifacts of a certain wealth, which had substantial and lasting effects on the local culture (see fig. 1). Well investigated archaeological sites such as Habuba Kebira and Jebel Aruda (Syria) show a development of the colonization phase over approximately two centuries, resulting in architectural, funerary and commercial outputs that have suggested the existence of a real "Uruk empire" (Algaze 1993), a perspective that is now considered an overstatement. The earliest traces of writing that can be defined proto-cuneiform (through the use of drawings representing different objects and numbers) were found in the most recent archaeological levels of Uruk (levels IV and III of the Eanna, ca. 3200 BC). The characteristics of society, administration and economy of the Late Uruk period would seem per se sufficient to justify the beginning of writing in Mesopotamia. This would have been dictated by primary and practical reasons related to accounting and day-to-day administration. In effect, given the considerable complexity of the Uruk society, it is almost obvious to assume that it simply equipped itself with instruments suited to deal with the recording of vast and varied information without relying on one’s memory and for future reference. This basic idea can generally still be considered valid. However, it is based on a perspective centred on the continuity with subsequent periods, when writing would be developed into a complete system; it does not frame the actual mechanism

Early writing (late Uruk and Jemdet Nasr)
« Since the messenger’s mouth was heavy and couldn’t repeat the message, the Lord of Kullaba flattened some clay and placed the words on it, like a tablet. Up to that moment there had never been one who would place words on tablets.» (from the Sumerian epic poem Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta)
From the beginning of the proto-urban age (3700 BC) - also called Uruk period after the leading site in lower Mesopotamia – substantial technological advances brought the valley between the Tigris and Euphrates to the forefront of Asiatic societies. These changes, which Gordon Childe described as a whole as an “urban revolution”, included first and foremost the formation of cities as central seats of power. These cities were marked by monumental buildings – high above the plain and of vast dimensions – for religious purposes, but also as evidence of a social and political control that was in the making from within, and with respect to the vast universe of the surrounding farming villages. Ambitious projects of canalisation could be organized through the central political power, so as to defeat the aridity of the land and increase the farming area of the alluvial plain. They were based on the core elements of division of labour and social hierarchies; that is, a system of power and assets management based on the existence of groups and classes differentiated from a political and economic point of view. On these same foundations, Uruk society also completed a network of long-distance commercial exchanges towards the East

and oral language is nowadays cast in serious doubt. As we will see further on, as early as a few centuries after the Late Uruk period, Mesopotamian writing began to represent an underlying language (Sumerian) through an organized set of symbols and signs – the cuneiform writing system – as it would continue to do over the following millennia, even when applied to different languages. However, no longer credible nowadays is a linear evolutionary scheme, which would directly lead from the representation of words through rudimentary drawings to the subsequent breakdown of words into phonological snippets via word-signs and syllable-signs, for the sake of representing the reality of spoken language with increasing precision (Gelb 1952). Nowadays, with the support of studies on the cognitive systems of ancient man, it is believed that writing oftentimes represented a mode of human communication that was parallel to language rather than subservient to it. To clarify this point, we may note first of all that the proto-cuneiform writing systems do not follow in any way the structure of oral languages: the documents of the time were organized above all in spatial rather than sequential hierarchies. The most archaic texts were sub-divided in vertical columns within which were rectangular boxes (cap. 20, cap. 21); inside these boxes, however, the various symbol were arranged according to the available space instead of following a reading order based on language. Moreover, the hub of these archaic texts are numbers (cap. 22) rather than other entities such as people, places or institutions. In other words, the spheres of meaning of the various signs, other than numbers, are few and
of the “birth of writing” in the Land of the Twin Rivers – of writing in the making – from a comparative and functional perspective. In the first place, it should be recalled that writing – both as concept and practical realization – was generated almost simultaneously in Mesopotamia and Egypt. From this epicentre comprising the two flood valleys of Western Asia and Northern Africa, writing spread elsewhere on a vast radius: in Elam (South-western Iran) where – still around the year 3000 BC – we find the proto-Elamite characters; in the second half of the third millennium, in the Indus culture (present day Pakistan); at the end of the third millennium in Crete (Minoan writing) and in large part of Anatolia (Hittite cuneiform), then in China at the end of the second millennium (Shang culture) and finally in Mesoamerica (first millennium BC). Some maintain that this distribution of different forms of writing over time and space demonstrates features of a slow but decisive diffusion of technology; in truth it highlights the lack of any connection – formal as well as typological – between the writing systems that were created in these different environments (fig. 2). The idea of a mono-centric development of writing in antiquity is almost completely discarded, while on the contrary the tendency is to claim that the writing systems of Mesopotamia (and Egypt), China and Mesoamerica were completely independent and, above all, were born as an answer to specific and totally different local requirements. In any case it is today difficult to establish an “universal” equation between the birth of writing and irrepressible bureaucratic-administrative needs. Moreover, the relationship between the earliest forms of writing

quadrangular shapes made of raw clay. To recall the content of these ‘envelopes’ without having to break the container, the required number of tokens would have been imprinted on the surface of the bullae in the fresh clay. In a theoretical further development this sort of double recording would have seemed redundant: the tokens would become obsolete, and the bulla would lose its three-dimensional volume to become a flat and compact tablet, with thin edges. The content to be communicated would then be engraved on it. This evolutionary reconstruction – from token to bulla and then the proto-cuneiform archaic tablet – is currently widely argued (Michalowski 1993). First of all, some of these tokens were discovered in a burial context, even in children’s graves; in these cases it is unlikely that these objects had a numbering function. In addition, the vastness of the documentation itself, over time and place, leads to doubt that all these objects could have the same uses, convey the same meaning, occupy the same position in a (hypothetical) evolutionary chain that led to writing. No doubt, in some cases these items might have been used to count or identify certain product categories; but in other cases, certainly more frequent, they could have been objects of religious-symbolic, or ritual, significance. As for bullae, if it is true that in many archaeological contexts they seem to precede the proto-cuneiform tablets, on the other hand this is not true in the city of Uruk, where they appear to come from the same levels as archaic tablets. In short, the bullae would be a device still in use simultaneously with the first occurrences of writing, perhaps by different social classes. And finally, a third category of documents has emerged from Uruk itself and from some of its colonies: the ‘numerical-ideographic tablets’, comprising numerical symbols and one or two signs representing different objects. Could this have been the “missing link” between the tokens, the bullae and the later tablets in cuneiform script? Further research will allow us to learn more on the subject. However as this may be, all these different aspects - technical, formal and contextual - indicate that writing was not a constituent factor of the complex bureaucracy of archaic Mesopotamia, rather - at most - one of its developments, as formalisation of a series of systems for symbolic notation that were already in place and used for various purposes, from play to ritual and business. Writing borrowed a series of pre-existing symbolic structures, for instance, some signs derive directly from tokens (Cooper 2004),
not easily identifiable, also because these present odd statistical patterns: very few of the signs appear frequently, while most are seldom found. This opens up a further possibility: the most archaic tablets might not yet have had a precise internal code, instead they possibly had to be accompanied by an oral explanation to the side. In short, even maintaining the idea that the proto-cuneiform Mesopotamian tablets had a primarily economic-administrative function, it seems like their use was largely confined to people “in the know”, who had a detailed knowledge of the context of the transactions or movements of goods being recorded. For these experts a written “memorandum” might have been sufficient to understand or remember the content carried by the tablets as for their data and related implications (Damerow 2006). To better understand, let's jump back not just in time but above all from a formal and typological perspective, in order to review the documentation that is traditionally classified as prior to writing: viz., the so-called tokens and the clay bullae. Some ten thousand of tokens were found in various archaeological sites in the Near East of Neolithic date (from 8000 to 3000 BC). They were made of clay or other materials, such as stone, and represented, on a very small scale, geometric or naturalistic shapes, such as cones, spheres, discs, tetrahedrons, cylinders, triangles, vessels, animals and more; some tokens were marked with engraved dots and lines. It has been said in the past that the tokens represented “the adaptation of an archaic way of counting, a so-called concrete counting which predates the invention of abstract numbers”, in the sense that for instance the symbol shaped as a bull’s head would represent “one bull”, that is, the object and its quantity combined (Schmandt-Besserat 1989). The clay bullae (or envelopes) would develop later, with the birth of urbanisation and more complex societies: homogeneous groups of tokens would have been contained inside hollow roundish or fig. 10

Sumerian mathematics in a 5000 year-old accounting clay tablet
Before 3000 BC, when Early Sumerians etched the images of their ‘tokens’ on clay tablets, various kinds of goods were represented by different symbols, and multiple quantities by repeating these. Three units of grain were represented by three grain signs, five oil jars were indicated by five oil signs and so on. The system had two main limitations. First of all every kind of commodity to be recorded needed its own identifying sign; this implied the need to memorise a myriad signs. The second problem concerned quantity: recording three oil jars with three identical signs was easy, but how to deal with 256 oil jars? A different system was obviously needed. The first great innovation in the development of writing was the separation of the quantity of an item from the symbol identifying it. That is, representing three units of grain with one symbol for ‘3’ followed by one for ‘grain’, and the same to write 3 sheep or 3 cows. Such a system is called a metrological numbering system, and the development of this concept in the course of the third millennium is still only partially understood. Let’s turn to other numbers: at the beginning we find some sixty different numerical signs; these can be grouped in a dozen metrological systems, for instance, a specific system to count livestock, a different one for liquid volume etc. Luckily for us Sumerian metrology has indicated all the different conversion factors, although they were all simple fractions of 60. In the sixty-base system used the unit is identified as a small cone. Ten small cones correspond to a small circle, six small circles correspond to a large cone, ten large cones to a large cone with a circle within, six of these to a large circle and ten large circles to a large circle with a small one within. The latter unity thus corresponds to 10x6x10x6x10 = 36.000.
A double sixty-base system was used instead to measure rations; this had conversion factors 10, 6, 2, 10 and 6, so that the symbol indicating the large quantity – this time a large circle containing two small ones – corresponded to a 6x10x2x6x10 = 7.200 base unit. Yet another system was in use to measure wheat. The conversion factors for this are 5, 10, 3 and 10, in such a way that the largest unit – a large cone containing a small circle – had a value of 10x3x10x5 = 1.500 units. During the third millennium these signs were gradually replaced by the equivalent Cuneiform, so that numbers could be written with the same stylus utilised for the words within the text The final phase of this development took place at the time of Ur III and consisted in the introduction of a sixty-based with ‘positional’ values. The number of signs was reduced to two: a vertical wedge derived from the small cone often employed as a base unit, and an angled wedge, derived from the small circle. The angled wedge had the value of ten vertical wedges. In the sixty-base system described above, the next unit up was the large cone. In the Ur III system this unit was represented by a vertical wedge like the base unit. In practice the couple of symbols could be repeated to infinity, always maintaining the same conversion factors of 10 and 6. Consequently a vertical wedge could could be worth 1 or 60 (6x10), or 3600 (60x60) and so on. Its exact value was determined by its place within the symbolic-numeric sequence.

modifications in the graphic system itself, both of a technical and conceptual nature. The first of such shifts concerns the shape of signs, in the sense of their progressive ‘de-naturalisation’ . A series of horizontal, vertical and oblique segments gradually came to replace the curved and sinuous lines of the primitive signs. The reed stylus used to etch the signs in the clay gave them elongated endings in angled or wedged shapes. Very soon lines and angles were used systematically in this more agile form of writing – cuneiform – destined to influence vast areas and diverse cultures of the pre-classical Near East. A change in direction of the writing also took place in the Early Dynastic period: from the original arrangement in sequential boxes within vertical columns, a 90o rotation led to the creation of horizontal lines readable from left to right, with the signs ‘lying on their side’ counter-clockwise when compared to their original concept and shape. An innovation of a radically different kind – implemented in the first half of the second millennium – led to the classification of signs and their values. Since the dawn of writing we may witness the forming of a scribal culture and environment, one that would leave a deep mark in all aspects of the intellectual life throughout pre-Greek Mesopotamia. If it is legitimate to state that in this, as in other parallel regions (Elam, Indus Valley, Crete), writing developed to facilitate the recording of goods or land assets for bureaucratic and economic purposes, it is also undoubtedly true that the class of professional writers quickly understood and employed the potential of the graphical tool for creating texts of different and varied nature, from religious or celebratory, up to decidedly literary compositions. Hence the need to have a growing number of individuals able to use this new technique was born, and professional scribes were trained to master the skills required to deal with the texts’ complexity. The scribal profession began establishing itself in society from the very early appearance of writing. However, up to the end of the third millennium BC, the Sumeric title dub-sar appears to have been used essentially to identify low or mid-level bureaucrats, although they were trained at a young age in the é-dub-ba, the school, or perhaps better (using a medieval Latin term) the scriptorium. As an example: in the many tablets from the third Ur dynasty, several officials seem to have had the function of ‘sealing officer’, but the inscription on their seals, which appear on the same tablets, describe them simply as dub-sar. In any case, by contrast, it will be observed that the ability to read and write was definitely widespread in this administrative environment, especially under King Shulgi, who opened schools at Nippur and Ur. It is certain, in any case, that the é-dub-ba of Ur III times appears to have been primarily an institution for the formation of subjects destined to work in civil service; it was a place where a common basis of ideas and attitudes were learned and exchanged between teachers or students (Michalowski 1987). In later times, dub-sar, then rendered in Akkadian with the equivalent tupsharru, indicates specifically the ‘scribe’. What we know about the scribes’ educational curriculum comes, instead, from the Old Babylonian period (19th-23rd century BC). It is found in written sources from Nippur, Ur, Isin and Sippar. In this context – where archaeology shows us that schooling was hosted in modest buildings, possibly simple ‘boarding schools’ – the public administration seems to have played a limited and secondary role. In fact, initial education consisted of exercises to become familiar
but it added many new ones; eventually all of these were integrated and codified in a technical and conceptual framework, one that diverged substantially from those where the individual elements had been conceived. We will thus continue to acknowledge the extraordinary place the Late Uruk period has in this revolutionary communication development; but we will attribute to this period only the earliest steps in the process

« What kind of scribe is a scribe who does not know Sumerian? » (Sumerian proverb)
What was the progress of writing after the Late Uruk period? As said before, the earliest signs etched on the tablets at Uruk, levels IV and III, as well as those of more or less coeval sites such as Jemdet Nasr (for a total of around 6000 documents) were substantially pictorial. Thus, a fish is represented in a profile view, the male and female sex is rendered with schematic but precise traits, the date palm is outlined with its trunk, leaves and branches; on the other hand there are many signs from this phase that we cannot interpret. This writing form of archaic Mesopotamia was often described as ‘pictorial’ or ‘ideographic’, but in fact it presents a single and precise structural characteristic: it is effectively based on the correspondence of each sign with a word – be it describing an object, a number, or a person’s name – it is then, essentially, ‘logographic’. This system, precisely because of that characteristic, was however destined to a rapid internal mutation, one that would allow it to act as an expressive vehicle for a society that was already articulated in its social, juridical and political relations and needs (fig. 3). The evolution from the most rudimentary form of logography - the expression of simple concrete data through writing – to the rendering of associative elements of various kind, could have taken place already within the Uruk civilisation (strata IIIb, ca. 2800 BC). In fact in the name of a person from this period, en-líl-ti, “the god Enlil gives life”, we find the first example of an application of signs on clay that was intended to convey phonetic values. To express the Sumerian word ‘life’, ti, which is difficult to represent from a graphical point of view, the sign with the homophonic value ti(l), ‘arrow’ was used instead. In essence, this first ‘word play’ demonstrates that already at this stage the language underlying Mesopotamian inscribed tablets was a form of Sumerian. Once introduced, the principle of phonetization in writing must have spread at great speed: the large local archives of the following centuries - Fara/Shuruppak, Abu Salabikh, Adab, Lagash, ca. 2500 BC (cap. 23) – already show a mature application of signs with syllabic values, representing elements of linguistic relationship (verbal actions, endings, adverbial suffixes, etc.) interposed amidst signs representing whole words, albeit subject to large semantic extensions (e.g. ‘SUN’ meaning 'sun' but also ‘glow, white, day’). Writing started spreading outside of southern Mesopotamia, reaching even remote areas: the city of Mari on the middle Euphrates, Ebla in western Syria, Tell Beydar and Tell Brak in the northern Syro-Mesopotamian steppe. There is no doubt that this vast diffusion of Mesopotamian writing must be related to further important

Tablet with a contract for the purchase of a house
The deed provides for a dual mode of payment: a sum in metal, divided in turn into the 'price of the house' and a 'supplement', and a quantity of various kinds of goods (products made from barley, amounts of fat and wool, clothing).

This text is divided into 36 boxes of writing, distributed in six columns placed vertically side by side. Already a century before the important archives of Early Dynastic Lagash, the documents from Nippur and Shuruppak show us the mechanisms of land sales in the private sector of society. Our tablet documents this practice of buying and selling quite clearly, and has a further aspect of interest in the double method of payment: a sum in metal – divided in its turn between the "price of the house" and a "supplement" – , and an amount of various commodities in kind (mostly products based on barley, but also quantities of fat and wool).
This practice is well documented in this period, but also in later centuries of the third millennium BC: for example, a contract from the Akkadian period presents, after the price in silver, the formula "additional payment for the house", followed by amounts of barley, oil, wool, clothes and tools: thus showing a still wider range of goods than in our document.
Our text also presents a large number of individuals who were at hand for the legal deed: "Ur-eshbar, Uda-urra, Mimi (?), Umma-TUR, Ur-Sud, Lugal-USH.SIM, (are) those who have taken in the price. Ur-Nusku, the scribe; Bakhar, elder of the city; AN-lu-makh, herald; Lugal-edenne-si: (these) are the witnesses. Kinimuzu is the one who bought the house."
power with Sargon of Akkad (ca. 2350 BC). Akkadian is, as opposed to Sumerian, polysyllabic (im-me-ru = ‘sheep’; li-ša-nu = ‘language’ etc) and – just as our languages – of a inflected kind in the nouns and verbs. It has been proved (Cooper 1973) that linguistically Akkadian personal names were to be found side by side with the Sumerian ones in Mesopotamia from the earliest archives; thus, while Sumerian was culturally prevalent in the Early Dynastic age, possibly also due to demographic factors, it acted on the basis of bi-lingual population. The prevailing of Akkadian as official language due to a choice made by Sargon and his successors thus came into being because of social and political factors, but it was not the product of invasions or other external factors, as was previously believed: the Semites had long been well established in Mesopotamia and were integral part of the population, on par with Sumerians, particularly in the most northern areas. The maintaining of the existing script, albeit applied to a very different language, from the original one, was not – as it was once believed – a phenomenon exclusively peculiar to Akkadian; more or less at the same time of Sargon the scribes from Ebla, in Syria, had adopted the cuneiform script to represent the local Semitic language (‘Eblaic’) which is itself a distant relative of Akkadian (Rubio 2006). Further, in the course of the second and first millennium BC cuneiform writing was applied to yet more diverse and varied languages. In short, cuneiform is a form of writing – as the alphabet will be later in all its different manifestations, from our writing of Latin origin to the eastern scripts such as Ethiopian Ge'ez or ornate Brahmi – rather than a language (van de Mieroop 1999). Born to be applied to Sumerian, cuneiform had its first secondary adaptation for the Semitic languages. We can judge the results of this adaptation process, and without a doubt we can be astonished by the complexity that is intrinsic to it. Since, as we said earlier, the signs of cuneiform writing comprised two values, as logogram (word-sign) and syllabogram (syllable-sign carrying phonetic value), specific interventions were applied to these two types. For the Sumerian logograms the scribes applied a simple method: they kept them unchanged in their basic meaning, but attached to them Akkadian translations. As an example: the sign expressing the
with the cuneiform signs; from here, students would go on to learn the many different textual typologies – from hymns devoted to the kings or gods to disputations in the realm of wisdom, to letters of literary character up to myths and epic texts – mainly in Sumerian, at least in the south. In short, these é-dub-bas in cities that had represented the ancient foundations of Sumerian culture, resembled more a "grammar school" than a "high school" (rare were the mathematical exercises), and they were in any case functional to professional training. For us moderns, in any case, they have a value comparable to that of European medieval monasteries, in their extraordinary role of custodians of Sumerian culture, which was already alien to the common man of their times. (Robson; George). As discussed above, cuneiform writing represented since ancient times the vehicle of expression for the Sumerian language. This is a type of agglutinative language (like Turkish, Finnish, Korean and Japanese), with a predominant monosyllabic structure (for instance: udu = sheep, a = water, eme = language, du = to go). The exact kinship of Sumerian language remains unclear (as is the case for languages such as Ainu in Japan, ancient Etruscan, Basque or Burushaki of Pakistan); nowadays a possible Uralic origin has been proposed again with a new approach (Parpola 2016), placing it in the context of the linguistic group from which Finno-Ugric languages (Hungarian, Finnish, Estonian) are historically derived, together with a number of idioms spoken in Lapland and northern Russia. In any case all theories of a non-Mesopotamian origin of Sumerians (some think of India etc.) would imply a mass arrival of people from outside the valley between the Twin Rivers: but how and when this presumed arrival of Sumerians would have taken place remains a mystery. We also ignore if they overlapped a pre-existing population (called hypothetically ‘proto-Tigridian’) to which some –definitely non-Sumerian – names of the main Mesopotamian cities (Ur, Uruk, Eridu, Shuruppak etc) might refer. The second ancient language of Mesopotamia belongs instead clearly to the Semitic group (like ancient Hebrew and Arabic, from the Quran to present-day dialects): we call it the Akkadian language since it became the official language under the new dynasty that gained

graphic characteristics. However, on closer inspection, the potential of the seals’ analysis is much wider: in fact they can reveal how, why, when and by whom they were employed, allowing thus the acquisition of precious information on the administrative and judicial organisation of Mesopotamian civilisations. Not only is it possible, in some cases, to determine the function of a specific seal, but also – thanks to the large amount of available specimens – to survey the variation of the seals’ application over time. The seals imprint on cretulae, bullae, clay tablets or labels, inform us on the sealing practice itself too. As far as we know the property rights were initially recorded via the use of seals engraved with a peculiar depiction, intended to easily identify who used it. Obviously property rights existed long before the invention of writing. Mesopotamian seals belonged both to kings and dignitaries of the palace administration, and to private citizens and even slaves; the latter used the sealing system in mechanisms of control not necessarily related to public management. Seals represented an object of great importance in a framework of collective management of resources. Findings from the preand proto-historic age include many more clay cretulae with seal impressions than the actual seals themselves. Cretulae were clay globes used to seal jars (fig. 3) and other containers (baskets, cloth or leather sacks) employed to carry goods or for the short-term storage of a variety of products, thus corresponding to the present-day use of sealing wax or lead seals. After imprinting the seal, the fresh clay would be let to dry. The impression of one or more seals on the cretulae guaranteed, from an administrative point of view, the correctness of opening, content removal, and re-sealing operations ; it allowed precise tracking of all handling operations and control of the assets contained within. Cretulae have an obverse and a reverse, the former side bearing the seal’s impression, the latter with the mark of the sealed object, whoich has oc casionally come down to us. The study of the backs of cretulae allows in several cases to establish what kind of object had been sealed, and to deduce the use it was intended for. The use of cretulae is known since the Neolithic period, more precisely from the seventh millennium BC at Tell Sabi Abyad, a site on the Balikh river in northern Syria. At this very early stage the main purpose was to simplify, in the absence of writing, operations of control and accounting related to the stored goods and the distribution of the common assets (mainly cereals but also other commodities). After opening the containers, the detached sealings were kept for a certain period of time near the place of distribution of the goods, to be used to compile
Sumerian word lugal, ‘king’, was equated to the corresponding Akkadian sharru, king’. For the syllabograms, Akkadians instead found themselves with a small repertory, which for the most part did not meet the requirements of their phonetic system; they thus put in place a generalized expansion of values. For the consonants, for instance, the sign ba also came to be equivalent to pa (voiceless/voiced exchange), the sign ad also stood for at and aṭ (=voiced/voiceless/ emphatic). Similarly, the ‘spectrum’ of vowels was expanded with ah that came to mean also ih and uh, or the signs in -i that also took on the value of –e. In some instances some values were apocopated (tam > ta; utu > tu) or, on the contrary, endings were added (bu > bum; ru > rum). With such differentiated interventions the cuneiform system of writing ended up acting as a functional vehicle for rendering Akkadic, while leaving unaltered its original structure in word-signs and syllable-signs. However, the adaptation process was long and complex, and resulting from several different traditions, needs and cultural interests, even partially in some contrast. Akkadian slowly established itself all over Mesopotamia, even though Sumerian was in use in the empire of the third Ur dynasty as a bureaucratic and administrative instrument up to 2000 BC. Two sets of Akkadian dialects developed over time, one in the South (called ‘Babylonian’) and the other in the North (‘Assyrian’): their relationship can, in very general terms, be compared to that of British and American English, both as for general proximity and for the presence of peculiar usages. Both dialects underwent significant evolutions over time, so as to allow us a precise distinction in parallel, starting from 2000 BC up to the fall of the Assyrian empire (612 BC); after that only Babylonian survived, gradually being replaced by Aramaic and Greek, up to its final disappearance shortly before 100 A.D. The collective perception of what had been written on ancient Mesopotamia’s tablets was born again only seventeen centuries later, in the mid-nineteenth century.
Early seals and their use. Rights and ownership
The use of cylinder seals developed side by side with the birth of urban civilisation and seems partially connected with writing technology. According to the data available today, cylinder seals engraved on stones of various kind (often precious) and the proto-cuneiform signs engraved on clay were born at the same time; their success and decline was also parallel. Traditionally glyptic studies were limited to the historical-artistic field and, consequently, focused essentially on stylistic and icono

checked by them at the time of shipping. The integrity of goods was thus guaranteed up to its delivery, when the recipients would examine the content and, if needed, could compare it to what was listed on the external bulla. Any interference that might have taken place in transit could then be easily detected, thanks to the fact that the cretula would be found broken upon arrival. Seals were thus invented to answer a practical requirement well in advance of the birth of writing. One use that emerged in the course of historical periods, with the advent of writing, was that of placing them on cuneiform tablets (cap. 24, cap. 25), as a guarantee of the authenticity of the message. In earlier periods the seal would be impressed on the tablet before it was written out while, starting from the age of Ur III, the exact opposite would occur: writing first and seal later. Seals were used specifically to authenticate receipts, ration lists, legal documents such as conveyances or loan contracts, or other official documents, for instance treaties and letters. On treaties and international agreements usually the involved rulers’ seals were impressed. For legal transactions the seals of various witnesses were required, often those of a scribe and an official as well. The function of the cylinder and stamp seal impressions on the clay tablets equated what, in our days, is represented by a signature associated to an official stamp on any public and administrative document. Thus, their value was as an authentication of a written document and they guaranteed the property of an individual, his involvement in a transaction, and the latter’s legal status. Sometimes, rather than impressing one’s own seal directly on a tablet, it would be impressed on the clay envelope that contained it (cap. 89). In the case of legal documents, the envelope generally held a summary of the content (or its whole text), including the indication of the involved parties and the seal impressions. Envelopes fell out of fashion in the first millennium BC.
the final accounting. In fact, they acted as receipts, testifying the delivery and the withdrawal of the goods stored in the container. The impression of the seal on clay or other materials probably represents the evolution of an older system that was used to identify individuals and groups via a distinctive hand-drawn sign; this would have been always the same and used to mark goods and products, so as to tell them apart from those belonging to others. The need to re-draw the same symbol several times may have encouraged the invention of an instrument like the seal, characterized by a chosen design, always identical, difficult to imitate and easily recognisable. The great ease of use of such a system offered, with the passing of time, an adaptable instrument suitable for a variety of needs of a society in continuous evolution, thus becoming integral part of an administration of growing complexity. The cretulae, when attached to doors with strings, would work as ‘locks’ employed to seal store rooms in public or private spaces. The doors would be secured with a string connected to a knob on the door frame; the string would be wrapped around the knob and covered with fresh clay, on which the officials in charge would then impress the seal. Access to the storeroom could only be possible by breaking the seal or cutting the string (fig. 6). Their main function was to guarantee against any kind of tampering; The integrity of the cretula testified the fact that the content had not been tampered with, acquiring a legal function similar to that of the modern seals with sealing wax. The use of several seals testified cross checks in the operation. The development of more complex and hierarchically-based societies led, in the course of time, to a functional evolution of the cretulae, which were applied to goods in transit as well. The officials in charge would imprint their personal seal on the goods to be traded: this way they indicated that the objects in the containers had been

In the Uruk period the sealing was essentially an institutional practice. Individuals would put a seal on behalf of the administration. It is not easy to establish when seals began to represent their owners as individuals, not just in terms of their relationship with an institution. The first inscriptions of personal names appeared on cylinder seals during the Early Dynastic II period, at the time of Fara. However, seals from that period still seem very much linked to the institutions, first to the temple and, starting from Early Dynastic IIIa, to the palace. In any case, the inscription represented a further guarantee for the acknowledgement and validity of financial transactions and administrative practices. For us, uch inscriptions provide precious information on the seal’s owner. Thanks to the inscriptions on the seals we know that some people owned several such objects, using them at the same time. The first seals that show an inscription are known only thanks to the impressions on tablets and other objects found at Ur, Jemdet Nasr and Uruk, dating to the first part of the third millennium BC (Jemdet Nasr period and Early Dynastic I). Some groups of signs and symbols seem to hint to names of cities and, for this reason, this particular category of seals is known in academic literature as ‘city seals’. Slightly later we begin to find names of gods in the inscriptions, and the first seals belonging with certainty to individuals, even though the inscriptions only contain the name of the owner, or his name and title. Hand in hand with the spread of cuneiform writing, inscriptions on the seals became longer and more complex, with the addition of family relations and the profession of the owner, who often described himself as the “servant” of a king: this information allows us to date an artefact with precision. Starting from the Ur III period inscriptions on seals could be very long and detailed. During the Old Babylonian period inscriptions became shorter, but they were more frequent compared to previous times: usually they consisted of three lines, the first one stating the name of the owner, the second his filiation, and the third describing the owner as the servant
of a deity or, less frequently, of the king. The professions, common until the Isin/Larsa period, all but disappeared. At the end of the Old Babylonian period the first prayers appear on seals, these are elaborations of a kind of inscription in which only gods' names were provided. Prayers and incantations became more common and longer in the following Kassite period, and usually the name of the owner was omitted. Starting from the Mittanian period we witness a sharp drop of inscriptions on seals. When found, these were, with few exceptions, relatively short. It is during this period that we find expressions like «seal (of) NAME» or «(seal) of NAME». The inscriptions were almost always written from top to bottom and from right to left, in such a way that the imprint had to be rotated 90° to be read. In the second half of the second millennium horizontal inscriptions appeared on the upper part of seals, even though the vertical ones did not disappear completely. Cylinder seals always had a direct link with the cuneiform writing on clay tablets, and the diffusion of these two important innovations progressed side by side. The presence of inscriptions on cylinder seals makes the relationship between these artefacts and cuneiform writing even stronger. What is often noticed is an inverse relationship between the length or relevance given to the inscription and the originality of the figurative motif on seals: the less distinctive the seal is from an iconographic point of view the more the inscription becomes necessary as a means of identification. When alphabetic writing on parchment, or other perishable materials, began replacing cuneiform, cylinder seals too were replaced by stamp seals, which were easier to be impressed on clay cretulae attached to documents. The intrinsic value of cylinder seals lies in the fact that they were usually made of semi-precious stones, which had to be imported, often from very remote areas. For this reason the re-use of such artefacts must have been very frequent and could take on various forms. The new owner could adopt the seal without changing its design nor the inscription, when present. The witnesses to a transaction sometimes made use of seals that were

Clay cone with cuneiform inscription
Commemorative inscription of Sin-kashid, king of Uruk (18651835 BC), with a dedication to the city gods Lugalbanda and Ninsun. The king presents a 'price list' of his kingdom: following a proven political propaganda scheme, he states that his kingdom has been particularly prosperous, as documented by the low prices of products and goods.
Origin Uruk Isin/Larsa period (19th century BC) Clay 9.2 x 5 cm
“For Lugalbanda, his god, and for Ninsun, his (divine) mother, (from) Sin-kashid, king of Uruk and (of the tribe) of Amnanum, which provides for Eanna (from) Sin-Kashid, king of Uruk and (the tribe) of Amnanum, which provides for Eanna: when he built Eanna, (also) E-kankal, their temple (and) place of heart's delight, he built for them. During his (text: their) kingship, 3 gur of barley, 12 minas of wool, 10 minas of copper, 3 measures of oil, were indeed sold for a shekel of silver the market rate in his country. May his years truly be years of prosperity!”
Celebratory inscription by Sin-kashid, king of Uruk (1865-1835 BC), with a dedication to the city gods Lugalbanda and Ninsun, also known as the parents of the hero Gilgamesh: the king compares himself with the latter in the designation 'mother' in addressing Ninsun. A topical piece follows (ll. 5-8), commemorating a building in the city.
Finally, Sin-kashid presents a 'price list' used in his kingdom: by following a proven political propaganda scheme, he states that his kingdom was particularly prosperous, as shown by the low prices of products and goods: barley, wool, copper, and oil in large quantities could be obtained by paying just a shekel of silver.
The inscription is relatively common: it is known from cones, tablets, even a diorite stele. The normal arrangement consists of 23 lines, thus about twice the present text; this also shows a copying error in line 1.8 ('they', as in the previous line, instead of the expected 'his'), not attested elsewhere. The document definitely had a certain popularity, and was copied on several occasions: thereby, the version of the stele found in Ezida, the temple of the god Nabu in the city of Borsippa, and here it was transcribed by apprentice scribes until 600 BC.
not theirs. In ratifying treaties the king could well use his predecessor’s seal, without altering it in any way. By using an earlier royal seal, the new king would without a doubt convey a strong signal of legitimation of his power. Generally, however, the new owner would make some changes to the seal he inherited or acquired in other ways. The inscription was obviously the part of the design that would most often be modified: it could be totally erased, but not necessarily replaced. In the case of more refined seals, often an inscription relevant to the new owner was engraved. The most drastic form of re-use implied the abrasion of the whole surface of the seal, in a way to make it possible to engrave a completely new motif. Beside their main functions, the bureaucratic-administrative and the judicial, seals could also be used as amulets – a magical value was attributed to specific stones and some decorative motifs as well, especially those depicting deities – or as ornaments and votive objects. These were drilled lengthwise (although in the Jemdet Nasr period a V-shaped perforation became popular: cat. 1691), allowing their owner to wear them using a string or necklace. They could be hung around the neck as necklace pendants, mounted on pins that were used to secure the clothes, or be part of a string of pearls tied to the pins themselves, as shown by an shell inlay found in the city of Mari (modern Tell Hariri), on the Syrian Middle Euphrates, and dated around 2500 BC. The inlay depicts a woman wearing a string of pearls attached to the pins securing her dress. The last of these is of cylindrical shape (fig. 7). On the basis of archaeological findings from the royal cemetery of Ur, where several seals were found associated with skeletons, it was suggested that this cylindrical pearl might have been a seal. According to E. Porada the main scope of the seal’s design was precisely apotropaic: the scene represented was conceived with the intent of having a favourable influence on the life of its owner. In this respect it is opportune to note that many seals seem to have been carved by non-professional engravers, possibly by
scribes – who were probably priests – for specific ritual uses. This would imply that behind the seal designs a certain ideological or spiritual conception was hidden. To sum up, Mesopotamian seals, of any type and in any period, appear to have been used, first of all, to mark belongings and, by extension, to protect what had been marked. This last feature gave the seal a more general apotropaic value: the legitimate owner and bearer, wearing the seal, felt protected. Long prayers recorded on Kassite period seals also refer back to this context.
Weights and measures
In a pre-monetary economy such as the Mesopotamian one, based on the exchange of goods, the role of weights and measures was obviously of primary importance in order to establish standards related to copper or silver, both for private merchants and for the State. The weight units have not been clearly identified in the archaic texts of the beginning of the third millennium BC yet. They are documented with certainty only from the Fara period onward. Nevertheless, measurements with weights were certainly carried out even in ancient times. Inscribed (or somehow marked) exemplars are known since Pre-Sargonic times. Very different standards seem to have been in existence since the Akkadian period.
The standard Akkadian-Old Babylonian system was thus the following (with approximate values): • barley grain ~ 0.04629629 g. • small shekel (Sumerian gin-tur, Akkadian šiqlu .sa ̆hru) ~ 0.13888 g.
• small mina (Sumerian ma-na-tur, Akkadian manu .sa ̆hru) ~ 2.777 g.
• shekel ~ 8,333 g. • mina ~ 500 g. • talent ~ 30 kg. Specimens of Babylonian weights, which have survived in considerable quantities since they were frequently found in the excavations

(many of which are to be found in museums, whereas only a few were studied), provide evidence of a somewhat haphazard technological precision. These weights were certainly not conceived to provide universal standards, but rather for everyday purposes of practical measurement. In the first millennium BC the Akkadian and Old Babylonian norms remained the basis of the weight system. For instance, the inscription on a weight of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon (605-562 BC), relates that it was a copy of a weight of Shulgi, the second king of the Third Dynasty of Ur (2094-2047 BC according the middle chronology). In the Neo-Assyrian system the most significant difference is represented by the use of the double mina (ca. 1000 g) next to the traditional mina (ca. 500 g), as testified by weights that can be dated between the ninth and seventh century BC The precise moment when the double mina was introduced - thus becoming the implicit standard in Neo-Assyrian texts, except when otherwise specified – is not clear. The terms ‘mina of the king’ and ‘mina of the Land’ were found on a series of Assyrian weights from the seventh century BC. These are in the shape of bronze lions and the texts indicate official weighing standards. They are written both in Assyrian cuneiform and Aramaic alphabetic script. Perhaps the ‘mina of the Land’ is the one known from the texts as ‘mina of Carchemish’, that is, corresponding to measures in use in the western part of the Assyrian empire (Fales 2016). Both terms are applied to the ‘light’ mina and to the double, or ‘heavy’ mina.syrian and Aramaic – seventh century BC. Ancient Mesopotamians thus used groups of weights of various shapes and weight value in the conduct of their affairs, as a counterpart for exchanged goods (silver or cereals). Very strict penalties were imposed on those (especially merchants) who used false or altered weights . The weights could be made in various stones; very frequent are those in hematite. The simple barrel shape was the most common one, but weights in the shape of a duck at rest, with the neck and
head resting along the back, were widespread as well (cap. 28). Weights and measures were also rhetorically used to show the country’s wealth: texts from various different rulers tended to highlight the fact that, under their reign, the value of silver corresponded to large amounts of other goods. One example is given by a clay cone (cap. 27) displaying a celebrative inscription of Sin-kashid, king of Uruk (ca. 1865-1835 BC) with twelve lines in Sumerian.

products or goods, because they were used to record the amount of transported objects. This was a control system for the goods or objects brought from one place to another. There is evidence of them among the Sumerians. But also in Elam - the 'land of God' - where, starting from the 4th millennium, an urban revolution began and where archaeologists have found hollow 'spherical bullae' , with traces on the outer surface of cylinder seals. These bullae contained 'tokens' of the conventional value corresponding to the quantity and quality of foodstuffs, animals, and objects. Writing did not exist yet. The need to count animals, goods, and things was strong, even vital: 7,500 years ago, the accounting system was already coded with the use of tokens and bullae modeled in clay. After two centuries or so, and, to avoid having to break the bullae they began to be marked on the outside by engraving the designs of the tokens that were inside: this way, the bullae did not have to be broken (except in exceptional cases) in order to control the amount of goods in transit or in arrival. It was soon realized (a few decades had gone by, and we are now around 7,250 years ago) that it was no longer necessary to use the bullae with tokens inside, but simply use loaves of clay with inscriptions that were, in practice, the prototypes of numerical digits. The 'loaves of clay' then became tablets and at the turn of the 6th millennium before the present, the digits became flanked by thousands of letters. Proto-Elamite and proto-Sumerian script - both would undergo certain phases of transformation over the centuries - developed in almost in parallel. The use of numbers and figures were more or less contemporary in both the Iranian coast of the Persian Gulf and the area between the Tigris and Euphrates, which we now call Mesopotamia and where the Sumerians (4,700 years ago) went from a pictographic writing system, which involved the use of thousands of signs, to a phonetic cuneiform method, where the use of few dozens of signs sufficed. For their calculating procedure, the Sumerians choose a compression system of '60'. They preferred it to what might be the more logical method based on 10, thereby introducing a 'sexagesimal' system based on 60 and its multiples. The Babylonians also used this method, the same one that we still practice for measuring angles and time. Probably in analogy with the revolution of the sun around the earth, completed in about 360 days, the “turn” angle is 360 degrees. Hours are composed of 60 minutes and the minutes contain 60 seconds, for a total of 3,600 seconds every hour. The sexagesimal system required naming all the numbers up to 60; so, in order not to deal with too many different names, they named the decimal units up to 10, and the tens up to 60, as we do now. This caused a mixed system of counting, sexagesimal and decimal, capable of providing importance not only to powers of 60, such as 3,600, but also to the decimal multiples, such as 600 and 36,000. In other words, a sexagesimal numbering built on the alternating basis of 10 and 6. In the Archaic period, the unit was made with a simple notch, a group of 10

Calculi. That is to say, stones. Calculus, i.e. stone. The word calculus comes from the diminutive of calx, calcis, or 'construction rubble'; 'pebble'. We still use this term for kidney stones nowadays. Or in the bile. For numerical calculations, it is a term that has now become a metaphor. The word had an amplified semantic field also in Greek: psephos meant both 'pebble' and 'count'. Just as psephos tithenai meant both to 'lay a stone' and 'make an account'. Thus, lumps of clay modeled as cylinders, cones, and spheres of various sizes were found in the excavations sites in the Near East; in Turkey and India. The dates in which this counting system started are different: from the 9th millennium to the 2nd millennium BCE. And starting in the 4th millennium, these stones were collected and packed in clay containers called bullae. Our accompanying bolle (waybills) that are in use even now, derive their name from the bullae that once served as transport documents for

was a small circle, sixty was a thick mark, and the number 600 was a notch, equal to 60, which was contained in the circle used to indicate 10 (60x10). A large circle was used for 3,600 (60x60), and for 36,000 (3,600x10) the same large circle with a small circular sign the same size as the tens inside of it. These forms underwent a counterclockwise rotation of 90 degrees, and afterwards, there was also a transformation of the Sumerian characters (in the pre-Sargonic period - Sargon of Akkad was king from 2335 to 2279 BC), almost certainly due to a change of material for engraving the clay (from a point to a small stick, a quill of bone or ivory) which allowed to produce signs that were more visible and precise, segments of straight lines that formed more angular characters. The unit became a small vertical nail, the number ten was a punch, sixty was a large vertical nail, 600 was a large nail with a punch, the number 3,600 was four nails that formed a polygon, and 36,000 a similar polygon with an arrow. Shuruppak, a town on the Euphrates River, is the location where archaeologists found the oldest evidence of an arithmetic calculation that is is not at all trivial: a tablet that bears a division with the dividend, divisor, and remainder. Practically, this is a problem asking to divide the amount of barley contained in a barn when giving “seven sila of barley each, with the remainder of three” to a certain number of men. How many men are there? To resolve the 'school exercise' question, it turns out that it is 164,571 men, workmen to be exact. The sila (unit of measurement) was a size of just over eight-tenths of a liter and the barn contained about 970,000 liters; those numbers indicated the units of measure/capacity for both. 4,666 years have gone by since the time of that division problem - which the scribe almost certainly resolved by using the calculi in rather interesting progressive steps. The numerical cultures of the Sumerians and Elamites used an additive system, pretty much the same as the one subsequently used by the Egyptians, Greeks, Romans, and Aztecs, and many other ancient peoples. It was a system that had some advantages but also many disadvantages. The Sumerians sensed the negative aspects of the mechanism to the point that they began to introduce a notation for 10 in their sexagesimal system. But the big step in mathematics was to get to the 'positional' system, which was a rather slow and gradual path. The tablets found at Mari, a city destroyed by Hammurabi 3,761 years ago, indicate that the numbers up to a thousand were written in a 'positional' way of units-tens-hundreds. And those above this figure remained in the ancient Sumerian system. It was thus the Babylonians' turn, at a time close to that of the destruction of Mari, to change the mixed system into a definitive positional system, the first one in history. For instance, the numbers between 1 and 59 were indicated with combinations of only two symbols; a vertical nail indicated the units and a horizontal punch stood for the tens. It was necessary to differentiate between 2,300, 2,030, 2,003, 230, 203, and 23: the Babylonians chose to leave an empty space in the appropriate places. But it was not easy
to make out, and only the context or the very nature of the problem helped to interpret the numbers correctly. It was only after the Assyrian conquest and imperial restoration - that is, roughly between the ages of Nebuchadnezzar and the Seleucids (2,600 and 2,300 years ago) - that people became aware of the need to indicate not only the presence but also the absence of a basic power. And the 'empty seat' was indicated by the inclination of a double nail, a symbol already used in ancient cuneiform script to divide the text from a comment, or to indicate the transition from one language to another. Only in the 2nd century, Ptolemy began to use the initial 'o' of 'ouden', meaning empty, as a symbol; a symbol that was also used in the terminal position of a number. The numerical adventure of the cultures living in the area commonly called “Assyro-Babylonian” is full of particularities and stories related to archaeological finds, although the decisive contribution to the study of the mathematics on the tablets will take place between the '30s and '60s of the last century, over a hundred years after the interpretation of the ancient cuneiform writings. As in the case of a tablet of the Yale Babylonian Collection (YBC 7289), on display some years ago in an exhibition in New York, that has a small clay disc (dating 1900/1600 BC) bearing a square with diagonal lines. In the center, there is a number: 1,24,51,10, a sexagesimal number that corresponds to 1,41421296, the decimal number, which is the square root of 2 approximated to the millionth. From what is known of the Babylonians, they had not discovered 'the Pythagorean theorem' 1,300 years before Pythagoras himself; and moreover, the archeological finds have not brought to light any tablet which might contain the equation of Pythagoras. But they knew calculi, and they knew them quite well indeed.

technology, a comparable complexity of logical and practical steps is faced daily, from the challenging use of computer keyboards to enter alpha-numeric data which replicate writing, with their myriad of tactile and linguistic combinations for encoding and decoding information; not to speak of the universe of different programming languages, with their complicated vocabulary, syntax and semantics, completely apart from the actual spoken and written language ... From this perspective we may be less surprised by the consideration that Cuneiform remained in use over three full millennia, and that it survived deeply relevant historical, linguistic and administrative mutations, as well as substantial variations in the applications of writing. Also, despite the introduction of more “democratic” systems of alphabetic script – such as those of Greek and Aramaic – it survived for many centuries more. In particular, cuneiform gave rise to various subsystems, some of which were extremely complicated, others quite straightforward and easy to learn. In a nutshell, cuneiform had very different meanings for completely different users; its extreme longevity

Cuneiform script was a flexible and versatile system, one that offered an efficient instrument for communication purposes and record-keeping practice, but it also produced a complex symbolic system, one that pushed ancient intellectuals to explore and investigate the representational potential it contained. Cuneiform script was in itself quite intricated with its many signs (more than 600, with a “basic packet” of some 150 for the average scribe); each of which was associated to a variety of meanings and different readings – something that, at first sight, may undoubtedly seem excessively cumbersome and impractical to us “moderns”. We could question how to distinguish syllable-signs and word-signs, determinative signs (not to be pronounced) indicating specific semantic categories, and numerical signs, keeping in mind that some signs belonged to several among these categories. How to deal, in any case, with a system whose signs could be polysemic (i.e. with two or more syllabic values) or homophonic (i.e. with two or more signs that could represent the same syllable)? In point of fact, however, in today’s world, strongly influenced by digital

The text is of considerable historical interest for the local calendars in force in different parts of the empire of the Ur III Dynasty. For this phase of history we know of four different series of month names: the calendars (l) of Ur itself, also in use at Puzrish-Dagan; (2) of Lagash, (3) of Nippur (the series that will become 'canonical' in the Akkadian translation from the Old Babylonian period onward, and which will provide the basis for the Jewish calendar), and (4) of Umma. All the series were of 12 months on the basis of lunar cycles (= 354 days) Therefore, they required the addition of an 'intercalary' month, even though such a correction appears to have been implemented with considerable irregularities in the different areas and periods, until around the 7th century BC.
Our document is related to the monthly series of Umma. It is conceived as a list of rations (the latter indicated by g u r, the measurement of capacity for barley) with internal partitions, according to the sequence of months. However, perhaps because it was a text which served as a model for the drafting of other similar documents, indications of the amount of g u r for the individual months are left 'blank'. Therefore, what remains are only the g u r signs followed, every other row, by the names of the months of Umma.
Partially damaged, the tablet retains the signs of the 4th - 8th months on the obverse, and the 9th - 12th months on the reverse. The entry for the 7th month is particularly interesting: in fact, its usual name is 'the month of the two shrines', but our document has 'the month of the (religious) festival of Amar-Suen'. This monthly event was already known, albeit sporadically attested; however, it had not yet found a 'place' in the sequence of months from Umma. From this text, therefore, we learn that the 'month of the festival of Amar-Suen' occupied - starting from a certain point during the reign of that king – the seventh place in the sequence, although without entirely or stably replacing the 'month of the two shrines'.
Finally, it should be noted that both Amar-Suen and his father Shulgi presented the 'determinative' sign for a god: they had in fact been deified, according to a practice started by Naram-Sin of Akkad (cf. ch. 7a).

Signs Before the Alphabet
and to do so over nearly three thousand years of history, makes Mesopotamia totally unique from a documentary point of view. It is worth noting that the opposite is true for the Greek and Roman civilisations, both completely laconic – albeit with some significant exceptions – especially regarding the finest details of bureaucratic and administrative organisation, thus leaving historians in the dark about several aspects of the social and economic development of these historical horizons. On the contrary it is precisely these administrative records from ancient Mesopotamia that allow, through patient and meticulous mining of the archives, a fairly accurate reconstruction of many aspects: from primary production l(agricultural produce and animal husbandry), to secondary production (food, textile, metallurgical industries and so on). In fact these documents were often made out to justify to the authorities in charge that no irregularities or unallowed appropriation of funds and goods had taken place, no matter the amount, on a daily, monthly and annual basis. From these documents we can draw detailed snapshots, e.g. of the delivery of raw materials to individual departments or workshops, of the allocation of materials to craftsmen and specialists, of the supply of finished products and their delivery for specific purposes (building activities, transport, public works of various kinds), but also for community activities such as offerings to the gods, religious festivities or war. To be sure, Mesopotamian administrative archives especially illustrate the complex activities pertaining to the power centres of the palace and the temple, with their élites including the rulers, clergy, subordinate officials operating in specific departments an offices, or at times located in capital cities and provincial districts. However, some archives, although less frequently, provide an insight in the reality of farming villages and even of pastoral communities living in the uninhabited areas of the steppe insofar as these social groups could claim the attention of the political or religious centre.
can therefore be explained by the fact that it was able to respond to varied and diversified needs, both in content and language (Veldhuis 2011). In this chapter we will attempt to give an idea of the variety of uses to which the immense corpus of texts in cuneiform script were put to, over the course of some 3000 years. We will start with a glance at the main typologies of texts in Sumerian and Akkadian from Mesopotamia and surrounding regions, such as are represented in the collection we are here dealing with, including materials from the simplest to the most refined. We will next move on to the constellation of languages that utilised cuneiform writing beyond Mesopotamia’s boundaries, in a geographic span covering all mountainous areas surrounding the Land of the Twin Rivers. Then we will look at the brief phase of the Late Bronze age, when Akkadian enjoyed the role of international and diplomatic language, much as French did in the nineteenth century and English in our time. Finally, starting from the city of Ugarit of the Late Bronze age, when the first experiment of a cuneiform alphabet took place, we will move on to the earliest results of linear alphabetic writing, in Phoenician and Aramaic: in that area of the Levant where the cuneiform universe found its deadliest rival, also because clay suitable for engraving signs was scarcer than in the Land of the Twin Rivers.
Accounting and administrative texts; juridical texts
The earliest function of cuneiform writing was the recording of administrative and accounting transactions. It is therefore not surprising to note that -at the end of the day - the "hard core" of Mesopotamian documentation of all ages consists of registers of personnel, animals and everyday consumer items; these range from the mosr simple and casual to those requested and organized by central bureaucracies of the State or the temples. This constant ability to keep a written record of realia, even in extremely varied environmental and economic circumstances,

Sumerian text of the group of the 'tablets of the messengers': a very detailed list of rations which includes beer of various qualities, bread, fat, olive oil, and flour of different types. The recipients of the rations are individuals or groups: of the former, the professional function is often specified, of the latter, the provenience. The type of the text shows that this tablet came from Lagash.
The 'messengers' are an administrative class of the Ur III Dynasty, perhaps of not particularly high rank, whose duties to a large extent appear to be of a temporary type, such as to be sent on missions to distant sites. In this sense, it is likely that the tasks assigned to the 'messengers' had to do with the sphere of communications between cities, or with the safety of the road network. Both options certainly apply well to the regions of Lagash and Umma, archival locations where the texts regarding this group of administrators were found: in particular, in this period, Lagash seems to have had the function of the caravan city for the urban locations of Elam, arranged in the arc of a circle on its eastern front.
In concrete terms, the 'messengers' are known to us only through the long lists of food rations, divided as to 'items', relating to individuals or small groups. The rations are in fixed amounts, and moreover generally scanty (i.e. just above the subsistence limit), and related to a few essential staples: we find beer, barley bread, onions, oil, and mixed spices, while dried fish is listed, but not continuously.
The beer must have been of the usual type in the Sumerian age, that is, obtained by the combination of barley and water with the addition of malt to give it flavour; different qualities existed ('light', 'normal', 'strong', 'royal'), of which, however, only the poorer types seem to have been assigned to the 'messengers'. Bread also had a series of internal differentiation (for example, there was 'royal bread'); onions were apparently provided in a sort of 'braid'. Overall, we are dealing with extremely basic types of food, which, however, were prepared against perishability, in direct relation to the mobility of this particular administrative group.
Moreover, they open even wider research horizons of great interest, from precise chronological reconstructions (through the dating formulae within the texts), to historical geography (reconstruction of the topography or physical peculiarities of specific areas), to prosopography (by relating names and professions, which form a wider socio-historical mesh), to metrological evaluations (weights, measures and, where possible, prices of goods and services at different times and places). All these areas of research related to the historiography of the ancient Near East are nowadays evolving fast; in fact, they owe their existence
In any case, however detailed or nuanced, the snapshots provided by the administrative documents have the advantage of being realistic, and above all immune from the pompous and self-aggrandizing propaganda that often characterizes the official documents issued by kings and rulers. Indeed they are records of everyday life, which provide the historian with endless glimpses of the technologies and materials employed, of the organisation of the workforce, both individually and collectively, and finally of the various possible ethno-linguistic identities involved in the productive and commercial processes.

as offerings for the temple, or as due tax from the provinces or loot/ audience gifts from foreign states, e.g. Subartu in Upper Mesopotamia or Shimashki in neighbouring Iran (cap. 31). Among the animals transiting via Puzrish-Dagan we find cattle, goats and sheep --wild as well as bred--, but also gazelles, deer, bears, pigs, wild boars from the marshes and various species of birds. From Puzrish-Dagan, the animals were redistributed to the shrines, to the Royal Family, and as salary to government officials and military. Such a complex management required a number of bureaucrats, dedicated to collecting the animals and to providing to their well being and finally to their distribution. The central archive also kept the records relevant to the peripheral centres of collection and preliminary destination. The officials working at these peripheral centres were entrusted with very detailed record keeping; these records included the loss of animals, their natural death or stillbirth, the increased numbers of heads due to births, all elements that appear transcribed on the tablets (cap. 32). Other neo-Sumerian texts of the Third Ur dynasty come from Umma, present day Jokha They are more concerned with agriculture, canal maintenance and other matters (cap. 33, cap. 29, cap. 35). Yet more documents come from Lagash, such as texts on the “messengers” (cap. 34) who trod the communication routes with Elam. The Neo-Babylonian period (spanning the sixth and fifth centuries BC) has yielded three large accounting archives coming from the main temples of the land: Ebabbar dedicated to the god Shamash in the city of Sippar in Northern Babylonia, with around 30.000 tablets, Eanna in Uruk, dedicated to Inanna/Ishtar, with 9,000 texts and, finally, several hundred documents on clay tablets from the major temple in Babylon, the Esagila, still partially unpublished (Jursa 2004). Typologically, the tablets from these archives record the transfer of goods (cap. 36), or at least the transfer of responsibility between individuals, with the temple implicitly involved in the trans
to the exceptional availability of accountancy and administrative documents written in the cuneiform script. Virtually every stage of the historical development, and every geographical niche, of Mesopotamia have provided textual materials of administrative character. However, some specific contexts have left us totally exceptional archives, such as to enable a particularly wide-ranging and in-depth reconstruction of the socio-economic mechanisms on which they were based. A glance at these major archives may here be limited to two phases, far between in time: the age of the Third Ur Dynasty (twenty-first century BC) and that of the Neo-Babylonian empire. It is interesting to observe that they were both short-lived phases in the overall context of Mesopotamia’s political history, yet similar insofar as administrative activity, in their short duration, was extremely rich and detailed. Some 90,000 documents of economic and administrative nature illuminate the development and complexity of the state structure of the Third Ur Dynasty (Streck 2010, 53): this represents the highest number of cuneiform texts for a single century of Mesopotamian history at our disposal. From this body of evidence we can extrapolate endless indications on the different sectors of public administration of the time, and specifically on the management of agricultural resources, metallurgy, animal husbandry, river navigation and much more. We are hereby going to examine one of the two major archives from those days. The centre of Puzrish-Dagan, present-day Drehem, not far from Nippur, acted as the headquarters for the gathering and distribution of animals, an item that made up a sizeable part of Ur III state revenues. Puzrish-Dagan was founded by Shulgi in the late years of his reign (Sallaberger – Westenholz 1999:147) and continued under the rule of his sons Shu-Su'en and Amar-Su'en; Puzrish-Dagan was the centre for the gathering of a wide range of animals: wild animals, livestock and poultry delivered both as gifts to the royal family, or

necessarily record it, taking instead refuge mostly behind well-worn formulas to describe the different phases or details of the transaction. Surely a myriad of transactions (perhaps the most occasional or minute) were only stipulated verbally; but the ones we have indicate that writing was a founding element, viz. that jurisprudence was expressed through the written act. Maintaining, as it has been done (Westbrook in Westbrook [Ed.] 2003), that Mesopotamian contractual texts were, in large majority, mere protocols of verbal transactions made in front of witnesses, means disregarding first of all the fundamental “testimonial” value of calling into question the great gods, who are often invoked in the texts themselves; it also ignores the importance of personal seals, sometimes added to the tablets by the witnesses to the stipulation of the act – to testify their presence – and, finally,fails to take into account the possibility, often expressly indicated, of breaking the tablet once the deed had exhausted the function for which it had been drawn up. In short, orality (any cultic act, the legal defence of the parties, even solemn oaths) certainly was part and parcel of the “ceremonial” that accompanied the legal act, but the text that was the end result, however bare and essential, had a binding value.
Lexical lists
The Mesopotamian scribal school (edubba) is clearly documented for the first time in the late third millennium BC, as functional to the learning of Sumerian with the aim of transferring traditional Mesopotamian culture from one generation to the next. However, the focus of teaching was placed on the study and copying of lexical lists of various kinds: this is a type of text that appears well established from the times of the earliest archives of Southern Mesopotamia (Uruk and Jemdet Nasr, then Fara, Shuruppak etc.). The lexical lists can, at their basic level, be distinguished between lists of signs and lists of words. The sign lists were designed to document and teach the complete inventory of signs and their correct use, organized according to the signs’ shape, in an order of growing complexity (signs with horizontal,
action. There are cases of multiple items collected in a single account. Legal documents are another category spanning the full extent of Mesopotamian history, from the Early Dynastic period onward. We will exclude here the texts of international law (such as pacts or treaties) and also the so-called “law codes”, in fact all those normative acts which had as their object one or more communities; we will concentrate instead on the huge available documentation of “transactional” nature, i.e. relevant to specific transactions involving individuals and groups in their private or sometimes corporate interests. Mesopotamian legal documents characterize every archive that has come down to us, from the vast collections found in public buildings to the modest sets of documents kept at home. They document land sales, loans with interest (cap. 37), aspects of family law (inheritance, adoption, donations of family members to the temple, etc) or the rarer records of lawsuits discussed in court; they were written on clay or, less frequently, on stone; the sentences could be of a pecuniary nature or involving indentured servitude, at times even the ordeal to settle a litigation. Their interest is thus at the same time diachronic and synchronic for the historian: on one hand he can witness the evolution of one judicial custom or another over time, on the other hand he can compare the legal documents within a single period of time to obtain a cross-section of social trends in progress. At the end of the day, the main point is that juridical Mesopotamian texts, in their variety and quantity, are a record of law in the making, seen through eyes that are strictly contemporary to the events, without secondary distortions of a literary of ideological nature. On the other hand, what we have are not deeds that “make the law”, but rather that operated within theframework of existing jurisprudence, deriving from the commonly accepted regulatory custom. And it is therefore solely by inner comparison between different contemporary deeds, with their different legal outcomes, that we can try to re-enact the “shared feeling” that could have been behind them. The Mesopotamian legal deed that has come down to us is in the shape of written text; it presupposes orality as its source, but does not

Clay cylinder with a list of names and professions
The document is a copy of an earlier Sumerian text, i.e. from the period of Fara or Abu Salabikh (ca. 2600-2500 BC). The original inscription is known as 'the list of names and professions'; it was found in the Abu Salabikh archives as a standardized list made into multiple copies for training the scribes of this center of southern Mesopotamia in the Early Dynastic period.
Ur III period Clay 8 x 9.8 cm
Cylinder of reddish clay, preserved for about one half. A vertical split delimits (a) a 5-column text, which in turn is divided into boxes, and (b) about half of the top lid. Drawn on the latter is a rectangle containing a further inscription, also divided into lines separated by horizontal rulings. A second, horizontal, split has damaged the individual columns of text: also on this side, therefore, the document is reduced to about half of its original length, as can be ascertained by the existing parallels.
The text engraved on this clay cylinder can be dated palaeographically as from the beginning of the Ur III period (21st century BC), although some of the signs were no longer in use at that time. Instead, from the point of view of content, the document is a copy of a Sumerian text from a more ancient period, i.e. the period of Fara or Abu Salabikh (ca. 2600-2500 BC).
The criteria for the order of the list known as “names and professions list” - attested on large square tablets with 12 columns - seem to have been a sequence of three elements: a personal name, a professional title, and a place name, although the complexity of the Sumerian language in this archaic phase gives rise to some doubt. Moreover, we do not know just how much the list of Abu Salabikh reflected cases taken from the real world (i.e. actually existing human or geographical entities), and how much, instead, could have been the result of random juxtapositions, for the sole purpose of promoting the ability of the compilers in the scribal art.

Signs Before the Alphabet
With the full establishment of the Akkadian language in spoken and written use, and thus well aware of the risk of obsolescence for Sumerian, the scribes of the first centuries of the second millennium (Old Babylonian period) proceeded to make out a vast series of bilingual lexical lists. Such lists were compiled, in their simplest form, on the model of the earliest mono-lingual Sumerian lists, with the simple addition of further columns containing the equivalents in Akkadian: for example, the list called (from its incipit) IZI=ishatu was ordered according to the shape of Sumerian signs, both simple and composite. Other bilingual lists presented greater complexity: the 32 tablets (ca. 10,500 entries) from the SIG7.ALAN = nabnitu series were based on the Sumerian correspondences with verbal or nominal Akkadian roots, according to an organisation “from head to toe”, related to the parts and functions of the human body; while erim-hush = anantu (7 tablets) was centred on the multiplicity of Akkadian synonyms to render a given Sumerian term. This said, we must however note that the main difference between the horizon of monolingual Sumerian texts and that of Old Babylonian times does not reside so much in the addition of a second language as in the organisation of a true learning curriculum for the scribe: in fact, scribes from the Hammurabi period structured the sequences of lists to be studied in the edubba in a way that would introduce students, step by step, to aspects of growing complexity in the writing system. To sum up, the lexical lists represent an important product of Sumero-Akkadian culture. By themselves they demonstrate that “words are things”, i.e. that giving/finding a name for each aspect of reality, and thus being able to put it down in writing, represented one of the most effective and precise means to appropriate that aspect. These texts have obviously little in common with dictionaries the way we conceive
angular, vertical lines, etc., with elements in growing number). Word lists were instead organized mostly by meanings, thus opening the way for thematic breakdowns, such as lists of professional names, birds, stones, place-names, etc. These lists are among the earliest known; in some cases – such as names of professions – there may be some internal groupings in a hierarchic light, but elsewhere their order is more casual and, at most, simply provided by lexical and semantic similitude. Such lists were copied over and over in the course of millennia: naturally what did change was the ductus (the way signs were written) in the various periods, but not the content that gradually became more archaic and remote from practical contemporary use (cap. 38). In some lists primary words (such as “sheep”) were not the only ones listed, but their qualifying attributes appeared as well, for instance “fattened sheep” or even “sheep eaten by a lion”: from this we can understand that the pupil not only would find entities attested in administrative and account-keeping documents, but also in narratives of a literary nature. The thematic principle was not, however, the only one behind the lists” organisation. Some combined sign lists could be organized according to an acrographic principle, that is, an organisation starting with the first sign: for instance, all combinations of words or sentences, where the sign a, “water”, came first, like in the following example:
a šu min bal “second irrigation” a šu eš5 bal “third irrigation” a bal-bal “irrigation water” a bal-bal-bi-še3 “water for libation” a-bal-e “to pour water” illu (=A.KAL) “flood water” (Veldhuis 2013, 9).

Commemorative inscription of Gudea, recalling the construction of the temple of the god protecting the city, Ningirsu, which was called é-ninnu. The sanctuary is provided here with an additional name, 'bright anzubird', with reference to the lion-headed eagle frequently attested in Sumerian mythology and contemporary figurative art. The deity is also presented with an epithet, 'strong hero of the god Enlil', thus, as an important divine figure in the presence of the absolute head of the Sumerian pantheon.

Signs Before the Alphabet
the military feats now leads to yearly reports: thus the modern historian manages to capture the rhythm of annual war campaigns, from departure to return, even managing to evaluate the kilometres travelled daily by the Assyrian army (Fales 2001). In parallel, royal self-aggrandizement increases as well, by now mercilessly: the Assyrians never lose a battle, in the field or through siege; enemy kings are all to be blamed for serious character faults, from insanity to wickedness (as opposed to natural and exceptional moral qualities of “our” sovereign); foreign landscapes to be conquered are all extremely harsh, for their inaccessible rocky or desert nature; and, ultimately, world order cannot be achieved except by a humble adherence to pax assyriaca. In short, the Assyrians created an overall system of historiographical discourse, which included and circumscribed the reality of the time and place in which they lived. There remain, however, some unresolved elements that give rise to a host of problems for the modern historian: what was the intended audience for these texts, written in multiple copies in a literary Babylonian dialect, that decorated limestone slabs, clay tablets and sometimes precious metal artefacts found throughout the Assyrian empire? And why, in addition to the abundance of literary depictions and topical propaganda employed, did these texts never find space for a detailed description of the military techniques that were the "flagship" of the Assyrian power, leaving instead the illustration of the most minute details of sieges, pursuits, pitched battles with the enemy to the astonishingly realistic bas-reliefs on the walls of the royal palaces? Could it be that these bombastic military conquest texts were to be read while at the same time contemplating the sculpted 'films' engraved on the walls of the Throne Rooms?
Diffusion of the Cuneiform system: Anatolia, Elam, Urartu
Anatolia
The early instances of the cuneiform system of writing in Anatolia date to the nineteenth to eighteenth centuries, when Assyrian merchants established their main commercial entrepot in Kanesh, Cappadocia. However, despite the large number of clay tablets written there and which have survived to our days, there is no trace leading back to possible seats of teaching of writing for the benefit of the local inhabitants of Kanesh; presumably these communicated among themselves and with the Assyrian using the indigenous idiom, Hattic. After the middle of the second millennium the Hittites – one of the many Indo-European populations reaching Anatolia from the East around 2000 BC – took control of the Anatolian productive and commercial systems; they were based in the more central and convenient location of Hattusa (present day Bogazköy) on the river Kizilirmak, starting to attain the same level as the other Western Asian great states (Egypt, Mittani, Babylonia and Assyria). From the middle of the fourteenth century, finally, after the defeat of Mittani, their main political and military adversary, the Hittites took possession of several Syrian cities and established a viceroyalty in Karkemish, on the Upper Euphrates. The peculiar orthography of cuneiform Hittite texts comes from the contact with scribal environments from Northern Syria, these number ca. 30,000 exemplars, primarily from the archives of Hattusa: this is one of the few archives of which scriptorial and administrative practice can be followed over various centuries. Some documents have reached us in various copies: these include historiographic
them nowadays, essentially for the great variety of ordering principles established in one or the other list; but also, because the role of memory in the practical-scholastic training for the mastering of cuneiform and the relevant texts was paramount, while modern dictionaries (especially the pocket ones) compensate for memory by reducing its exercise. However, it must be clear: without the bilingual Sumerian-Akkadian lexical lists, with their equivalences including whole sentences, Western scholars of the late nineteenth century would have faced a longer and more difficult struggle to find a “key” to Sumerian, a language without known kinship. At least initially then, the mechanisms of Sumerian were explained to us by the edubba texts, and we should be grateful to the Mesopotamian school for this gift.
Texts of historiographic intent
Mesopotamian historiography was born, and found its primary and constant track of development, out of self-celebratory intents. In the basic textual form of this kind we may range inscriptions where a king celebrates – for an internal audience, aiming at prestige – his activities in public and monumental building, accomplished in the light of a superior personal efficiency and great divine favour. Such inscriptions could be publicly displayed or else become part of the “foundation deposits”, that is destined to the innermost recesses of the new buildings; thus being visible to the gods, but not to human eyes, at least until – centuries away – the building would be reconstructed by a “future prince” (cap. 39). Elsewhere, beyond a sense for the future, such inscriptions supply a glance on the past: for instance, when the self-celebrating king is also the one who discovers earlier inscriptions while renovating the building, whose mudbricks (albeit plastered and strengthened with fired bricks and some stone) had surrendered to the elements over time. It is Assyria, of the two “halves” of Mesopotamia, that has left us the richest and most complex trove of historiographic texts. Here, in fact, the tendency of rulers to annex narratives of military feats which took place “at that time” to building inscriptions slowly developed: a trend that definitely became rooted in the Middle Assyrian period (from the thirteenth century onwards), when the northern Mesopotamian state presented itself in a renewed light compared to its past, more oriented towards a theocratic and militaristic vision. It can be argued whether this “change of pace” took place under the influence of the previous Mittani domination (of which however scarce documentation remains) or as an imitation of communication and historiographic models established among other members of “club of great powers” of the Late Bronze age. In effec t, however, the Middle Assyrian period marks the beginning of a historiographic narrative where the king celebrates himself – strictly in the first person singular – especially in his cosmic righteousness towards Ashur and other important Assyrian deities, while glorifying his military feats abroad; at the same time, the accounts of building work tend to move towards the end of the inscriptions, which grow in length and are written out on a variety of materials (stone, clay, metal) in several parallel copies, scattered all over. In the passage to the neo-Assyrian period (first millennium BC) the formal system of royal inscriptions becomes consolidated: the itineraries of the royal campaigns become more detailed (so as to allow their projection on modern maps: Parpola-Porter 2001), as are the names of the vanquished enemy kings.

under the influence of cuneiform in use in Mittani. Finally, in the thirteenth century, a third scriptorial style shows analogies with Assyrian-type signs; probably this is not by chance, since it is at this time –after the demise of Mittani – that the Hittites and the Assyrians faced each other directly on the Upper Euphrates. In essence, given the long life of Hattusa archives, it is now possible – also thanks to the use of digital technologies – to reconstruct the palaeographic “stemmatics” of many types of cuneiform texts in use at the Hittite court; this way we can notice the interesting permanence of some signs over time, while others were more subject to diachronic changes (Weeden 2011, 2016). Linguistically, the adaptation of cuneiform to express forms of an Indo-European language presented some complexity, but it was as a whole successful. Moreover, thanks to the vast number of copies of the same texts - some of which with syllabic spellings - we know how to read in Hittite many s logograms: so, for example, the Sumerian sign A = “water” corresponds in syllables to wa-a-tar. Overall, the Hittite cuneiform corpus represents the oldest Indo-European linguistic ensemble; it thus has imposed a total rethinking of historical paradigms and Indo-Europeistic classifiers, counter to the belief that viewed Greek and Sanskrit as the most archaic manifestations of this language family.
Elam
Texts in the Elamite language come from the modern province of Khuzistan and Fars, in South-western Iran. The largest part comes from the city of Susa and the surrounding Khuzistan plains, from Persepolis and Anshan (present day Tall-i Malyan) in the high Fars valleys, or from
texts, instructions for administrators and soldiers, laws, hymns and prayers, rituals, astrological omens, mythological texts and even teachings related to the care of horses (hippology texts). On the contrary only single copies remains in the sectors of correspondence, land acquisition deeds, lists and registers, depositions in law courts, cultic inventories, oracular reports and non-astrological omens. In practice, both types are documents that represented the exclusive expression of a dominant élite and their direct subordinates, who chose the Hittite language as their internal means of communication, despite being also able to use another variety of Indo-European – Luwian – or even non Indo-European Hattic for their everyday needs or other requirements (Van der Hout 2006). The orthography of Hittite texts in essence took on the forms of the Old Babylonian ductus from Syria, possibly since the time of the military campaigns of king Hattusili I in the area (ca. 1600 BC).Since we know of many cases of travelling scribes in the second millennium BC, moving from place to place to educate the ruling classes in the art of cuneiform writing, we can thus assume that this was the mode of acculturation in the case of Hittite. In fact, several scribes going by an Akkadian name are attested in the Hattusa archives and elsewhere. Naturally, a class of native Hittites scribes, who seem to have been aware of the philological complexity of Akkadian (not so much of those of Sumerian), rapidly formed; also Hurrian and Luwian came to find transcriptions in Cuneiform, although much less than Hittite. But the Hittite ductus also shows an evolution in the course of time: from an earlier phase (from 1600 onward), a middle one follows (fourteenth century) in which some shapes of the signs have changed, maybe also

Signs Before the Alphabet
I of Persia in Behistun, the term “Elamite” was chosen, after long discussions, in Oriental studies of the nineteenth and early twentieth century, against other references to “Scythians”, “Medes” or “Medo-Scythians” in a Classicist vein, also because the toponym “Elam” appears in the historical books of the Bible (Basello 2004). It must however be noted that the above mentioned “high place” or Elam does not appear in the Mesopotamian texts before the middle of the third millennium BC Hence, even if archaeological evidence on this area considerably predates that period (especially from the future capital Susa, which preceded Uruk by a millennium), the beginning of Elamite history is fixed by convention towards 2600-2500. In this earliest phase, two south-Iranian polities, Elam and Awan, make their appearance: the "Sumerian King List" indicates that the king Enmebaragesi of Kish (ca. 2675 BC) attacked Elam, and later Awan attacked Ur, and ended the dynasty of Mesannepadda (ca. 2500 BC) taking its place until the kingship returned to Kish. In practice, Elam and Awan (perhaps located in the highlands north of Susa) are considered in this text as states so close to Mesopotamia to even share its dynastic history. Shortly after, also Eannatum of Lagash assimilated Elam to Sumerian cities in the list of his military conquests. Differently, at the time of Urukagina, Lagash seems to have entertained commercial dealings with Elam, as demonstrated by administrative texts from the period. In the twenty-fourth century this fluid state of affairs seems to change: in fact, Sargon of Akkad repeatedly attacked Susa and conquered surrounding areas in the context of building his Mesopotamian empire; Rimush and Manishtushu followed in their father's footsteps. This conquest effort, with the appointment of military governors in various Elamite cities, came to incorporate Susa and its region in the political universe of Akkad, spreading Mesopotamian culture in the area. After the fall of Akkad by the hands of the Guteans, probably coming from more northern areas of the same Zagros Mountains, and their brief interregnum in Mesopotamia, an inscription by Ur-Namma of Ur mentions one Puzur-Inshushinak as king of Awan, whom we can therefore date to 2100 BC ca. He was already ensi – ruler - of Susa, was the first native king to attack Mesopotamia, particularly in its central-eastern sector, including the Diyala and the central Tigris, with Eshnunna (modern Tell Asmar) and Tutub (modern Khafajah) as
sites on the main route between Susiana and the Persepolis-Anshan area, or finally from the Fars coast. Multilingual rock inscriptions of Achaemenid age (ca. 520-450 BC) with Elamite versions can also be found in central-western Iran, in the vicinity of Hamadan, and in Eastern Turkey, near Van. Elamite texts on clay tablets, dated around 600550 BC were found in the ruins of the Assyrian city of Nineveh, and elsewhere in North-eastern Iraq, in the Urartian fortress (cf. c, below) of present-day Armavir Blur in Armenia, and finally in the Old City of Kandahar in Afghanistan. Dating of Elamite texts ranges from 2300 BC to 350 BC (Stolper 2004). Three kinds of writing characterize the linguistic expressions of Elam: a pictographic proto-Elamite, very close to proto-Sumerian cuneiform, so far undeciphered; a hieroglyphic script (syllabic, but with some logograms as well) from the end of the third millennium BC, subject to still hypothetical and mutually diverging decipherments; and finally cuneiform writing in two distinct graphical versions, the first one definitely based on an Akkadian model (between the third and second millennium BC) and the second of more simplified kind (neo-Elamite, first millennium BC). Apart from inscriptions, documentation regarding the Elamite language comes form individual words, mainly names of professions, appearing in texts written in Akkadian and Old Persian. The possible relationships of the Elamite language - which is an agglutinative language, like Sumerian and Hurrian-Urartian - are uncertain. A hypothesis that Elamite could be connected to Dravidian languages has been circulating in studies for more than a century and a half, and is still being advocated (see for instance Khačikjan 1998); in contrast, although it never received a thorough critique, other scholars have simply ignored this assumption. The linguistic study of Elamite does not seem, at least so far, to have been affected by the problem of origins. Elam is, in itself, largely an artificial historical and geographical construct, coined by the Mesopotamian scribes with reference to the South-western highland regions of Iran (today's Khuzistan and the central ranges of the Zagros Mountains) and its inhabitants; the name perhaps referred to the idea of a generic “high place” both in Sumerian and in Akkadian, while a self-definition of the country by the indigenous population seems to be lacking. By virtue of the presence of this language in the important trilingual inscription of Darius

For this reason, I built a temple with a brick vault, a temple. .., and I gave it to the god Inshushinak of the sacred place. I raised a ziggurat to heaven. May what I have built, and what I have worked on, be pleasing to you, Inshushinak!”
Building inscription by the king of Elam, Untash-napirisha (ca. 1275-1240 BC), the representative of the new Elamite dynasty that settled there in the late 19th century, to commemorate the erection of the ziggurat at Choga-Zanbil, not far from the historic capital of the Elamite kingdom, Susa, on the Ulay river. Untash-napirisha is known because of his attack on Babylonia, launched competitively with the attack by the Assyrians under Tukulti-Ninurta I (1243-1207), in which the Elamite king withdrew, allowing the Assyrians to lay claim to victory.
A divine statue inscribed in Akkadian found at Susa also testifies to this raid in southern Mesopotamia. The deity mentioned in our text, Inshushinak, is the main figure of the pantheon of Susa, and is attested as a component of many personal names of Elamite kings.

had a meaningful influence on the “Amorite” States of the Euphrates and up to Syria. This phase ended with the reign of Hammurabi; the Babylonian king led several successive campaigns for the conquest of Eshnunna, and then against Elam itself. Fig. 3. Elam, corresponding to Khuzistan, East of the Tigris and of the central ranges of the Zagros Mountains, in present-day South-western Iran (from https://iranologie.com/) After some silence of our sources the “Middle Elamite” period (15001100 BC) is marked by successive dynasties of “kings of Anshan and Susa”; this period appears among the best documented in Susa and other sites through 175 official cuneiform inscriptions by the kings. Of special importance here was the central phase, during which king Untash-napirisha founded his new and grandiose capital, on the site of present-day Choga Zanbil; it has an imposing ziggurat dedicated to the gods of the highlands and the lowlands. During the final phase (twelfth century BC) came the defeat of the Babylonian Kassite dynasty at the hand of Shutruk-nakhkhunde, with the pillage of southern Mesopotamian cities: he was who the king who took to Susa the stele with the Hammurabi code, the victory stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad and many more monuments celebrating Mesopotamian history. His son Kutir-nakhkhunde went as far as to remove the statue of the god Marduk from its temple in Babylon. A military revenge however took place under the Babylonian king Nebuchadnezzar I (1225-1104 BC), who defeated his contemporary Elamite king in a field battle on the river Ulay, even though he did not manage to invade Elam. Another pause in the sources takes us to the eighth century, when we witness the first moves of military and political collaboration be
major cities; however, the founder of the Third Dynasty of Ur relates of having defeated him. The region and other neighbouring areas (such as Anshan) was placed under the control of the Ur empire, with inter-dynastic marriage policies, but also with military conquests (implemented by Shulgi); However, a new dynasty in the land of Shimashki (perhaps in Fars) began a hard opposition against the excessive power of the Mesopotamian empire. This phase ended with the fall of the Ur III empire, in which - in addition to the gradual detachment of various provinces and the increased pressure of the Amorites - military attacks by he Shimashki and Elam against the capital played a key role in the 24th year of King Ibbi-Su'en. The following period (nineteenth-eighteenth centuries) marks the pinnacle of Elam’s power; it was able to establish multiple relationships with the new States in the making, such as Eshnunna, Larsa, Assyria and Babylonia. The royal dynasty of Shimashki was possibly overturned by the kings of Susa, who took on the title of sukkalmakh (originally “grand vizier or minister”, in use e.g. in Larsa ). It is possible that there was a “triumvirate” political structure, with the sukkalmakh at the top, followed by the simple sukkal (‘minister’) of Elam and Shimashki and then the sukkal of Susa, in a succession line for the sukkalmakh that was ensured by the upward rotation of the other two and the appointment of a new “minister” in Susa. The period of the reigns of Isin-Larsa shows the deep influence of the Elamite sukkalmakhs over various Mesopotamian States ; and after the death of the strong Assyrian king Shamshi-Adad I (1781 BC) Elam had the opportunity of conquering Eshnunna, possibly even making it its royal seat. Judging by the Mari diplomatic correspondence, the sukkalmakhs might even have

after the establishment of a new polity, the amount of international contracts made it necessary to be equipped with a system of writing and to use a language of a neighbouring country with its own cultural tradition; while the ability to write one’s own language in the writing system just learned would follow quite soon. In Urartu, after borrowing the Assyrian cuneiform system, interest for Akkadian waned and, on the contrary, texts composed to express the Urartu language – a late branch of Hurrian language – prevailed, employing an accessible form of cuneiform, mainly syllabic. The oddity of the Urartian case should in any case be noted, since the popularity peak of cuneiform had already faded in the first millennium BC, while the expressions of writing based on the innovative alphabetic system were advancing. Moreover, the usual baggage of cultural and literary traditions that were normally associated with the cuneiform system did not accompany its adoption in Urartu. But perhaps both these apparent anomalies can be explained insofar as cuneiform was used mostly with a specific function in Urartu: that of celebrating the exploits of kings (Zimansky 2006). The corpus of Urartian texts (Salvini, 2008, 2012) consists of c uneiform inscriptions coming from all of ancient Urartu, which included Eastern Turkey, Armenia and Iranian Azerbaijan, and reached as far as Iraqi Kurdistan. The majority consists of inscriptions chiselled on stone (stelae or stones included in later buildings. etc) or on rock faces; then we find inscriptions on bronze objects (cap. 42), on clay (tablets, cretulae, ceramic vases) or other materials and, finally, inscriptions on seals. The texts record the feats of the various Urartian kings, in the age of the apex of the State’s power, from Sarduri I (834-828 BC) to Ishpuini (828-810), Menua (810-785), Argishti I (785-763), Sarduri II (763-735)
tween the Elamite State and Babylonia, in the attempt to face the exceeding power of Assyria. From this moment on, Elam’s history is inextricably interweaved with the military activities of Tiglath-pileser III, Sargon II, Sennacherib and then Ashurbanipal in Babylonia against the Chaldeans, and in Elam itself. The final conquest of Susa by Ashurbanipal in 646 BC led to the destruction of temples and the city’s ziggurat, to the pillage of royal and divine statues, to the opening of Elamite royal tombs with the destruction of the remains, and to a mass deportation of the population. The looting operation lasted 55 days, according to the Assyrian king. From this moment on Elam ceased to exist as an autonomous State; the affirmation of Medes and then, above all, of the Persians as dominating powers on the Iranian horizon also caused its ethno-linguistic decline, with the inclusion amidst a myriad of other peoples in the Achaemenid Empire, even though the Elamite language would still be used by kings for their commemorative rock-inscriptions (Potts 1999).
Urartu
The arrival of cuneiform writing in Eastern Anatolia, and then in the neighboring Armenian area, was strictly associated with the supremacy of the polity of Biainili-Urartu, around 830 BC. This event was a latecomer for the Near East, since Assyrians and Hittites had utilized this writing system for about a millennium in neighbouring areas just to the South and West. It must be however taken into account the fact that a sufficiently populated and of complex organisation had not hitherto developed in the area. This said, the modality of the adoption of cuneiform in Biainili-Urartu followed a familiar pattern seen elsewhere:

an period – with subsequent amendments– which was then exported to other regions outside Mesopotamia itself. Proceeding from compositions made with elementary signs up to increasingly complex ones drawn up in the Akkadian language, but without excluding Sumerian - the most ancient learned language, and an indispensable tool to dominate the whole of the cuneiform writing system -, scribes from all over the Near East learned the Mesopotamian scribal techniques and, with them, the texts from the traditional culture of this area (through recopying of proverbs, literary narratives, letters, religious texts etc.). Perhaps a good modern parallel for this extraordinary international acculturation is the learning of Russian and cyrillic script in the schools of all countries of the Warsaw Pact from 1945 to 1989; but this case was the result of political imposition, while in Western Asia before the Late Bronze Age the adoption of Akkadian and cuneiform script for international relations took place freely, as a practical choice dictated by convenience of communication between very different languages, developing even during phases in which the Mesopotamian states (Babylonia and Assyria) were declining in prestige. Educational institutions (including family-based ones) for the learning of Akkadian therefore arose in various external areas, from Hattusa in Anatolia, to Ugarit on the Mediterranean coast, to Emar on the Upper Euphrates - all places connected in various ways to Hittite dominion (Fincke 2012) - but also at El-Amarna in Egypt (Izre'el 1997). The latter

Overall, we know of several hundred texts, which are often characterized by fixed clauses unendingly repeated. Worthy of note are the annals of Argishti I, engraved on the southern side of the citadel of Van; the annals of Sarduri II, on a stela, and on the walls of a niche on the north side of the citadel itself, and an inscription of Rusa II, whose full text was identified in 1998. Of the four existing bilingual inscriptions (Assyrian-Urartian) , all associated with the Musasir buffer state, the most important is one on a stela at the pass of Kelishin, on today's mountainous border between Iraq and Iran.
Akkadian as international language of the Late Bronze Age
The final centuries of the second millennium BC (between 1500 and 1200 BC) were marked by a peculiar cultural phenomenon: the adoption of Akkadian (in cuneiform script) as the diplomatic language of communication between the different powers on the international political scene of the time: Egypt, Mitanni, the Hittite Empire, with their respective vassals, especially in the Syrian-Palestinian area. The solid tradition of the Mesopotamian scribal school was behind this diffusion, with its more or less fixed curriculum developed in the Old Babyloni

In it, the sender informs his colleague of the arrival of a messenger to receive a specific substance, most likely fragrant and valuable, in Ugarit, 'as much of it as you can' as compensation. As such, the document is inserted among the textual material on the international relations of various kinds between the Syro-Palestinian states in the late 2nd millennium BC, relationships that often involved requests for commodities, sendings, 'gifts', etc.

Reverse (of it) as is at your disposal. I will give you its price. And may he take it from the head-merchant!"
The text is a letter sent by the prefect (shaknu) of Amurru - a state located between the heights of Jebel Bishri and the lower Orontes in Syria – to his counterpart in the city-state of Ugarit, on the Mediterranean coast. In it the sender notifies a colleague about the arrival of a messenger to receive a specific substance (parriskhu), probably fragrant and valuable in Ugarit, “as much of it as is at your disposal”, promising compensation. As such, the document fits within the abundant textual material on the international relations of various kinds of the Syro-Palestinian states in the late 2nd millennium BC: relations that often involved requests for commodities, dispatches, 'gifts' for diplomatic and political reasons, etc.
In addition to the interest of the letter itself, is the fact that it is the "twin" of a previously known message, RS 17,152: but the latter, although written with similar phraseology and for the same
purpose, was sent by the king of Amurru to the king of Ugarit. The two texts could thus have been sent simultaneously; or else the failure to conclude the negotiations between the prefects could have been followed by an intervention 'from on high'. The word parrishkhu appears only here and in the 'twin' letter in the Akkadian lexicon: it was obviously part of the local late-Amorite technical jargon, common to both Syrian states (cf. the Chicago Assyrian Dictionary, vol. 12 (P), Chicago 2005, pp. 191-192).

(today Tell Kazel) on the coast not far from Ugarit; small archives of letters or administrative documents have reached us from 12 different cities in the Palestinian area, including especially Aphek, Hazor and Taanach. Of particular interest here are the epistolary documents, because they bring into prominence the foreign centres with which the Levant was in written correspondence: Ugarit exchanged information with Carchemish and Emar to the northeast, and then on the coast with Alalakh, Tyre, Birutu (now Beirut), Sidon, Byblos, to the south with Qadesh; while the Palestinian cities were receiving letters from various areas - some of which are not represented in the vast archives of El-Amarna – such as Qatna on the Orontes, and again Byblos, Beirut, Sidon, Tyre, Hazor, Acre, Megiddo, Shechem, Gezer, Jerusalem, Ashkelon and Lachish. In essence, the use of Akkadian in this period had brought about a blossoming of correspondence written for political or commercial purposes, such as we do not find even in later ages, when the alphabet came to make writing more immediate and accessible.
The Ugaritic alphabet; the Phoenician/Aramaic/Hebrew alphabet The first alphabet was born in Ugarit. At this site, now known as Ras Shamra (“the fennel promontory”), on the Mediterranean coast of present-day Syria, the fortuitous discovery of some stone blocks by a farmer, led to the decision of the French authorities to open archaeo
(halfway between Memphis and Thebes on the Nile, ancient Akhetaton, the capital city of Amenhotep IV / Akhenaten) is best known for an epistolary archive that documents to the highest degree the practical affirmation of Akkadian as lingua franca used by international chancelleries in the Late Bronze Age: there are in fact about 300 letters written by some forty Syro-Palestinian “minor kings” to Pharaoh, as well as letters from the “Great Kings” of the time, from Mesopotamia, from Mittani, the Hittite Empire, Cyprus and, finally, some drafts of letters in Akkadian coming from Egypt itself. From the El-Amarna texts in Akkadian, relevant to acts of war, the fate of caravans departing and arriving, and inter-dynastic marriages, it is possible to broadly reconstruct the complex web of political relations of the period, made of conflicting interests disguised in the trappings of courteously formal, diplomatic language. These texts further allow us to highlight several interesting cases of an ambiguous use of Akkadian: whether unintentional, under the influence of the writers” native languages (West Semitic, Hurrian, etc.), or with the intended purpose of latently influencing the royal recipient on matters of particular political interest (Liverani 1998-1999). In parallel, more or less recent discoveries indicate that Akkadian was in regular use in various centres of the Levant. The largest archives of “everyday” documents written in cuneiform come from Ugarit (cap. 41), Alalakh at the outlet of the Orontes in the Mediterranean and Emar. We have small archives also from Ras Ibn Hani, Siyannu and Sumur

The text is a contract allowing a couple to adopt a third individual who is said to be from 'the country of Khatti', i.e. Hittite, even though his name is Semitic. The clauses contain numerous parallels to both Emar itself and elsewhere in the Akkadian area in the mid-2nd millennium BC. For as long as the adopters are alive, the adoptee will have to 'honor' them; after their deaths, he shall be entitled to participate in the sharing of their assets. Then there are two symmetrical clauses of termination in the event of repudiation by one or the other contracting parties, with the same pecuniary penalties. The contract ends with the names of witnesses, part of them Semitic and partly Hurrian, such as in Alalakh and Ugarit in the same period.

logical excavations in 1929, which were developed with almost perfect punctuality until 2011. From the very beginning of the vast archaeological excavation endeavour, clay tablets, inscribed in a cuneiform script until then unknown, came to light: these employed only 30 graphemes, compared to nearly 600 of the Sumerian-Akkadian system. A few years after the discoveries, these texts, now clarified in their formal aspect, were tentatively (but correctly) identified as belonging to the Semitic language family, and in particular to the north-western group of which ancient Hebrew is part. Once this 'key' was found, readings were not long in coming, and in 1931 the decipherment of the new language, called “Ugaritic” was announced. In the following years, the notion that Ugaritic was an “ancestor” of Hebrew was pursued with vigour; Ugaritic was used as a crucial interpretative key for many difficult passages in the Old Testament. However as this may be, various aspects of the Bible, especially religious and theological, can find clarification in Ugaritic texts in general: it is certain, for example, that in the period before the monarchy, the religion of Israel was sharing many aspects with the “Canaanite” one of Ugarit. Over the years of archaeological campaigns on the site, many tablets have been added to those initially found: today we count at least 2,500 texts, written both in Ugaritic and in the international Akkadi

Whatever item of my heritage that Itti-Sharri-piya had taken, I gave to my daughter Sin-kime. Itti-Sharri-piya against Sin-kime will not bring legal action'.”

The text comes from Emar (today Tell Meskeneh), an ancient Amorite city located on a large bend in the middle of the Euphrates River in north-eastern Syria. Many texts were found at the site, dated between the 14th century BC and the fall of Emar in 1187 BC From both documents and archaeological data, Emar proves to have been an important center of trade in the Late Bronze Age, thanks to its position between the powerful centers of northern Mesopotamia, Hittite Anatolia, and Syria itself. The tablets of Emar, mostly in Akkadian script and dating back to the 13th century BC, are not of royal or official type, but 'everyday' recordings of private transactions, legal deeds, relationships regarding real estate, weddings, wills, and formal adoptions. Another group of Emar texts is, instead, of scribal and scholarly character (literary and lexical texts).
This text is a contract whereby one Qibi-Dagan makes his own daughter, Sin-kimi, simultaneously both 'son' and 'wife', that is, the heir of all his assets. The operation appears to have been accomplished at the expense of an actual son, Itti-Sharri-piya, who was deprived of all substances, and who is admonished not to make legal complaints. The text, like many others of the late 2nd millennium, is of considerable legal interest in light of the complex procedures that characterize hereditary law in that period: a law that arises and is implemented as the reaction of the private sphere against precise 'thrusts' by the coeval public sphere (waning of the firstborn privilege implemented in the palatial sphere).
In detail, the text highlights the presence of two key characters in the texts of Emar, even though there is not much evidence of them in the archive itself. The first is Khishmi-Teshub, in a text (Emar Vl/3, no.19) said to be the 'son of the king (of Emar)' and at the same time 'brother' of the king Ini-Teshub of Carchemish (cf. also ibid. no.18): the latter is a well known character in both Hittite and Ugaritic texts, the great-grandson in the cadet line of the Hittite king Shuppiluliuma II and a contemporary of king Tudkhaliya IV (approx. 1250-1220). As for Pukhi-Shenni, he shows the same title as that in the Emar document no. 181, another text with the 'son of the king' as witness: although in that case, it applied to Tuwata-zitti, another representative of the 'Hittite' dynasty of Emar.
Finally, the 'seal of the son of the king' is attested in the fragmentary text Emar no. 182. Abi-kapi, son of Khurasi, is frequently mentioned in the legal deeds of the site: see especially Emar text no. 194, in which this individual is the owner of land registered on a tablet 'sealed with the seal of the king of Carchemish'. In conclusion, the present text is full of interesting parallels in the legal tradition of Emar.

an of the Late Bronze Age (cf. f, above), but the total number could be much higher, thanks to most recent discoveries. These texts are to be added to various specimens in other languages in use at the time (from Hittite to Luwian, Hurrian, Egyptian, and Cypro- Minoan) and, at least in part, subject to study in the local scribal school. The texts come from various libraries of the coastal city, attached to temples and the royal palace, but also from private homes of high-ranking individuals.
Ugarit fell at the hands of the “Sea Peoples” around 1180 BC and was never rebuilt. However, a similar fate did not befall other cities that dotted the Mediterranean coast and carried out parallel trading activities to those of the Syrian centre. This point leaves open the question of a possible partial overlapping of the Ugaritic alphabet with writing developed in the Phoenician cities on the present-day
coast of Lebanon. In any case, it should be noted that internal comparisons within the Semitic language group that can be established starting from the Ugaritic alphabet, do not always correspond to those of the subsequent linear alphabets. Moreover, the phonological inventory of the two systems is very different: while Ugaritic has partial vocalization, through the use of the three signs [ʼa], [ʼi], [ʼu], the Phoenician alphabetic system (“Canaanite”) has only the consonant sign [ʼ] (= aleph) without attached vowels. Overall, then, the Ugaritic and Phoenician alphabets are largely different when compared: If we then notice that Ugaritic, following the practice of cuneiform Akkadian, was written from left to right, while Phoenician is written from right to left (like all Semitic alphabets to this day) and, in addition, that the Phoenicians signs are not derived in any way from the cuneiform, but are linear, it must be assumed that the “invention” of the Phoenician alphabet took a very different path from the
one developed by the scribes of international 'calibre' from Ugarit. It is commonly believed that a precursor of the Phoenician alphabet (“proto-Canaanite”) might have already been invented in the first half of the second millennium BC by people who had some knowledge of Egyptian hieroglyphs (where we find a number of signs with phonetic value); that it originally had around 27 phonemes, then reduced to 22 over time; that the signs were initially pictographic, mostly with the value derived from the represented design (acrophonic value: e.g. n for nun, “fish”, for a sign in the shape of fish); and that the pictographic idea – as as the case in most archaic Sumerian - allowed to write freely in every direction, from right to left or vice versa, as boustrophedon, or vertically (Naveh 1982: 43). The Phoenician alphabet would appear towards the eleventh century BC, at the end of this long chain of attempts, which left traces in the Sinai and in various sites of the Levant, but also in the Mediterranean area, with the fixing of 22 consonant signs, to be read from right to left (Lemaire 2008). In any case, there is no doubt that the realization of the Phoenician alphabet came to be combined with the substantial commercial prestige of the Phoenician city-states along the Levantine coast and up to Cilicia in the north; this enabled this writing system to spread rapidly, beginning with the early centuries of the first millennium BC, to the surrounding populations of Semitic language, both to the south (Hebrews and peoples of Transjordan) and internally (Arameans). How deep may the degree of diffusion of this form of writing have been, is impossible to establish, since the linear alphabetic signs could be penned with a simple brush on any surface; and most of the writing media employed (papyrus, parchment, wood, etc.) might have been lost to the wear of time. From Phoenicia itself and from Palestine and surrounding regions, we are therefore left essentially with alphabetic testimonials engraved on stone, or penned on pottery sherds (ostraca). Aramaic instead, due to its ‘situational’ proximity with the Assyrian empire – of which it had become the vernacular language - came to use clay tablets for the preparation of their texts; both in parallel to cuneiform texts and for monolingual documents. From Mesopotamia and Syria, therefore, tablets with texts in Aramaic painted with brush on hardened clay have come down to us, as tangible evidence of a deep technical and cultural shift taking place, although still on the same writing media as “before the alphabet”.

tamia. As with the majority of cuneiform texts from the Third Dynasty of Ur, the Garshana Archives are devoid of an excavated context whose location, considered to be somewhere in the Sumerian province of Umma, remains unknown; thus their collection and publication remain controversial. Previously, similar cuneiform discoveries for this historical period came from the major cities of southern Mesopotamia. However, the source of the Garshana Archives is from the estate of Shu-Kabta, a general and physician, married to the princess, Simat-Ishtaran, the daughter of the king of Sumer, the first such archive discovered so far. These, mostly well-preserved tablets, record the daily, detailed accounts of the estate’s construction of a brewery, flour-mill, textile-mill, kitchen and compound wall, along with numerous additional dwellings in the countryside. Descriptions of the building processes from the making of mud-bricks, digging of foundations, erection of walls, roofs, plastering and waterproofing provide the first contemporary portrait of the creation of an estate complex perhaps to be compared to the later Roman and medieval “latifundia”. In addition to the smaller households and villages within the property, the estate contained tanning and leather-working facilities that produced elaborate goods for the estate’s residents. Agricultural fields, sheep, goats and cattle, and a piggery provided food for the household’s large kitchen to feed the family and the numerous workers on the estate. Boats and sailors were on hand to provide transport and to ship goods to and from towns and villages near and far. Of particular significance is the extraordinary role that women played on the estate, particularly after the death of Shu-Kabta, when his wife, the princess Simat-Ishtaran, became the head of the household. Elaborate records of the funeral banquet for Shu-Kabta provide lists of the varied dishes served and even recipes for different kinds of soup fed to guests and workers alike. Numerous women, servants and hired workers, participated fully in the construction work, brick-hauling, supervision of work gangs (with equal or even higher wages), and many other tasks hitherto documented only for men. Of particular interest is the evidence for the underlying Semitic-Babylonian language on the written agglutinative-Sumerian language of the texts. It revealed the substantial influence of the Babylonian language, the apparent spoken
The Garshana and Irisagrig Archives
David I. Owen Cornell University
During the last decade, two unique, but unprovenanced, archives from Mesopotamia were published. The Garshana Archives were first identified in the late 1990’s by Dr. Rudi Mayr, assistant curator at the Rosen Collection in New York City who, together with Professor David I. Owen of Cornell University, began the study of the archives. In 2000 the tablets were gifted to Cornell University with the establishment of the Jonathan and Jeannette Rosen Ancient Near Eastern Studies Seminar and Tablet Conservation Laboratory. After a period of intensive conservation and continued study, the Garshana Archives, consisting of ca. 1400 tablets, spanning a 20-year period during the final decades of the Third Dynasty of Ur (2100-2000), appeared in a series of four volumes. The recovery of this unique corpus, more or less as a complete unit, constituted a major discovery in the history and culture of late third millennium BCE Mesopo

language of the mixed, local Sumerian and Semitic population, which is reflected also in the many Babylonian personal names recorded on the tablets. For the first time the cuneiform record reveals an intimate portrait of daily life in a rural community in Sumer in the last decades of the 21st century BCE.
In 2006 cuneiform tablets dated to a 20-year period during the last decades of the Third Dynasty of Ur, characterized by their unique calendar, began to appear for sale on Internet sites. They caught the attention of Professor David I. Owen who began to record and study the photos posted on these sites. For the following six years, he was able to identify and “reconstitute” an archive of ca. 1500 tablets associated with the city of Irisagrig (along with some from Garshana), located somewhere in the general vicinity of the Sumerian religious center of Nippur. Just as the discovery of the Garshana Archives added a unique perspective for Sumerian society during the Third Dynasty of Ur, so too did the discovery of the Irisagrig Archives that came from an important city governed by Urmes for over twenty years. Irisagrig was the gateway to the northeastern frontier and was situated on a major trade route to the cities of Elam (Iran) with which it had close relations. The tablets were probably plundered in the remains of governor Urmes’ palace and thus provide details on a complex system of royal administration that included hundreds of messengers, who were dispatched from various branches of government offices, to undertake a wide variety of local administrative tasks and diplomatic missions to cities in northeast Mesopotamia and western Iran. An elaborate system of rations consisting of generous portions of meat, fish and soup were provided to the messengers along with onagers to facilitate travel. Evidence for the existence of many temples, including those for deceased kings of Ur, foreign contacts, military officials, visits of the kings and royal family members, and numerous new political and military details hitherto unknown from previously published archives - together constitute an unparalleled discovery.
In sum, these recently published archives preserve detailed and complimentary portraits of two related, albeit different, contemporary communities. They provide rich data that is enhancing the study and understanding of late Sumerian and early Babylonian society a few short years before the Sumerians vanished as an ethnic and political entity in Mesopotamia and the Babylonians emerged as the major ethnic, linguistic, and political group to dominate Mesopotamia for the remainder of its long history. The discovery and rapid publication of these archives
provided an expanded view of the complex political, religious, social, military, and economic affairs of two cities whose exact locations may one day be revealed and excavated properly.

The craft of the seal engraver






to us, the experience level of the craftsmen could vary considerably. The most expert ones worked for high-ranking customers and employed semiprecious stones. Given the scarcity of textual and archaeological data the organisation of a stone engraver’s workshop in Mesopotamia is difficult to reconstruct. In some cases the style of a group of seals is so distinctive and peculiar that we can assume with some certainty that they came from the same workshop (those from Sippar and Aleppo are good examples). The raw materials employed in the seals’ production were first modelled in a cylindrical shape, refining and smoothing them with sand. Having achieved the cylindrical shape the next stage was its longitudinal perforation, starting from both ends to avoid the drill bit overheating at the risk of breaking the stone. This is particularly noticeable in some specimens whose two holes are slightly out of alignment. The procedures in other production areas, such as Crete and Egypt, indicate that the seals were fixed to a sort of frame or adhesive block to be engraved, making a rough sketch on the surface first, so as to allow the craftsman to position the drawing correctly. However, unfinished Mesopotamian cylinder seals often show just a single element of the figurative scene, as if the modelling or engraving were limited to one element of the composition at a time. The etching of the decorative motif was generally the last step in the making of a cylinder seal. The drawing on the seal was engraved in “negative”, so that when it was pressed on fresh clay it appeared in relief or “positive”. Observing the iconographic motifs of the seals it is possible to distinguish two main groups: seals where human and animal figures are rendered in a realistic manner, showing even the most minute details; to achieve this a variety of different size tools was employed, drills and chisels made of metal or flint, whose marks were then polished to give the drawing a smooth appearance. Seals with schematic figures and stylized geometric patterns, which were made with completely different tools, particularly with a drill. A strict correlation between tools employed and style may be noted at least for the oldest examples, where the most refined seals were always made, or at least finished, with fine tips and chisels, while the simpler schematic ones were always executed by drill. During the Middle Uruk period a hand drill with a rounded tip was commonly in use, and this produced very coarse designs (baggy style). In the Late Uruk period, such motifs were polished and refined using fine tips and chisels, which also allowed for the creation of smaller shapes and more densely decorated compositions. The drill soon became the most common tool, and the fastest one for the etching of glyptics. It was essentially a bow drill (fig. 1), whose drilling tip, attached to a wand, could be rotated at high speed using the bow to which it was attached .
The craft of the seal engraver
Roswitha Del Fabbro
The craft of the bur-gul
We know very little about the seal engravers, whose Sumerian name was bur-gul and in Akkadian purkullu or parkullu. A Babylonian text dated around the sixth century BC during Cyrus’s reign tells us they had apprentices. The duration of the apprenticeship can be imagined if we think of the challenge the craftsman was facing in the execution of a minute drawing on the surface of a tiny cylinder and engraved in negative, almost with no visual aid. It is difficult to comprehend how these engravers could carve such small scenes without the help of magnifying instruments. Recent studies are beginning to reveal that the disabled might have been employed in ancient Mesopotamia, and engravers affected by myopia might have been among these, employed in somewhat the same way as scribes who were charged with compiling tablets in minute handwriting. The seal engraver’s technique was possibly the most complicated among those applied in the ancient arts, comparable to that of the “Little Masters” decorating Greek vases. Inscriptions played an important role in the seal’s design at various times. It seems probable that they would be produced by scribes who had been trained not only to carve inscriptions in stone, but specifically to do so on a very small scale and in reverse, so that the inscription would be readable in the seal’s impression on clay. In some cases it is quite obvious that the inscription was made by someone not properly trained, since it looks unclear or some of its cuneiform symbols are oriented in different directions. During the Old Babylonian period it would seem that the figurative motif was carved first in the majority of seals. The customer could choose the design he preferred and then ask for the inscription to his liking to be added in the space provided for the purpose. The concept of adapting a design to a curved surface and develop it so that it could be repeated with no restrictions was totally new and revolutionary vis-a-vis the well defined area in stamp seals. The fact that in the same period we find bas-reliefs on the curved surface of stone vases is not likely to be a coincidence. The appearance of cylinder seals coincides with the resurgence of fashion for refined stone vases, which in turn was linked to improved stone-working techniques. E. Porada (1977) suggested that the development of cylinder seals could be attributed to the makers of stone vases. The second syllable of bur-gul, the Sumerian name for the seal engravers, might refer to an activity associated with stone pottery (Edzard 1959-1960). The stone engraver could have thus been originally a craftsman both carving seals and working on reliefs and stone vases. In Diqdiqqeh and Ur, C.L. Woolley discovered some stone fragments that were presumably used by the seal engraver, or his apprentices, to test and produce a drawing on a flat surface before executing the “fair copy” on the curved surface of a cylinder. Judging by the diverse quality of the seals that have come down

difficult, hence the transformation of this operation from vertical to horizontal marked a noticeable progress. It is likely that both the horizontal drill and cutting wheel were motioned by a bow, like the vertical drill. This innovation made the engraving of hard stones much simpler.
It was previously thought that drills and cutting wheels mounted horizontally were in use as far back as the late fourth millennium BC (Nissen 1977). M. Sax demonstrated on the contrary that these important technological innovations did not make their appearance until the late Old Babylonian period. There is no evidence of use of the cutting wheel earlier than approx. 1750 BC. Before that time, soft stones were by far the preferred material and drawings were carved, engraved and smoothed with copper, flint or wooden tools. An essential element completing the stone carvers’ toolbox was the abrasive. Emery (corundum) powder was introduced at the beginning of the Old Babylonian period and this abrasive was still the most popular in late antiquity. It came from the island of Naxos or from India, although other materials such as quartz and iron oxide, albeit rougher if similar in function, were more easily available. Abrasives were also used in the surface finishing phase, called polishing. The cutting wheel consists of a circular grinding wheel tool fixed on a horizontal rotary axis held by two supports (fig. 2). Scholars generally accept that a cutting wheel could only be used if mounted on a horizontal axis. This tool increased engraving speed and clarity; moreover, it could be controlled more easily, since it allowed for the desired pressure to be exerted in a specific point. This invention merely required a sideways rotation of the bow drill and a support at both ends of the axis. The discs could be of various sizes. The vertical drilling of a smooth and curved surface was extremely

obtaining a long rectangular imprint. The practical advantage of this innovation was that of eliminating the need to imprint a seal several times, thus simplifying the sealing operation and reducing the time it required.
Cylinder seals: styles
The success obtained by this implement is demonstrated by the wide diffusion of cylinder seals over a large swath of the Eastern Mediterranean, in all areas touched by the cuneiform culture, where they remained in use for over three millennia. The technology was so easily adaptable and pervasive that it became an essential aspect of various areas of Mesopotamian life: administrative, legal, personal, social and religious. Seals of the Uruk period were often drilled from top to bottom, as it became customary in later periods; others were not and sported a small handle at the top instead, shaped as an animal or sometimes similar to a crest (cap. 47): this, according to some scholars, was fashioned after the distal end of the metapodial bone. It is indeed possible that the prototypes of cylinder seals were made of perishable materials such as bone, and that this peculiar shape of the handle referred to their typical morphology. The cylinder seals of this period are, for the most part, made of fairly soft limestone and, considering their dimensions, are among the largest, at least as far as the diameter is concerned. In a later phase harder stones began being utilized, and the appearance of lapis lazuli is witness to the existence of long distance connections with the mines of the Badakhstan district, in present day Afghanistan. The Late Uruk period is characterized by a great variety, not only from a stylistic point of view but also for the iconography of subjects depicted on the seals. Among the most frequently employed themes were the parades of prisoners filing in front of the king, contest scenes between heroes and beasts or among wild and domestic animals (often a lion approaching and grabbing its prey from behind; cap. 46), rows of animals (cap. 47), processions of offering-bearers to the temple, the feeding of animals, scenes of social conflict or war, and finally scenes of daily life, particularly work activities. The cylinder seals of the Jemdet Nasr period, between the fourth and third millennium BC show subjects and styles that are completely distinct from those of the Late Uruk period, despite being
In a nutshell, the shift from a stone to a metal (copper/bronze) tool set coincided with the introduction of hard stones for the production of seals. It seems likely that the difficulties of engraving hematite first and an even harder material such as quartz (hardness 7 on the Mohs scale) later stimulated the technological progress that was not needed for the production of seals in softer stones. Other related innovations were the use of the cutting wheel mounted horizontally and probably that of emery as an abrasive.
Artistic forms and styles of the seals over the ages
The seal impression not only identifies its owner, being generally a personal item of his, but it also allows us to highlight how taste, figurative symbolism and techniques of miniature engraving could vary in the course of different periods, in all of which the images depicted on seals can be typologically traced back to a limited number of standard scenes. In essence, the iconographic repertoire of the seals diversified and developed over time, changing according to region and style. The engravers did not need a source of visual inspiration to make the carvings; the recurrence and sometimes the monotony of the images produced were the fruit of a consummate art, which reused the patterns that proved most successful and of greater visual impact, constantly revising them. The most ancient type were stamp seals and appeared in Northern Mesopotamia. Their shape, especially during the Neolithic, varied considerably, possibly to counter the repetitivity of the geometrical carved motifs. It was only in the late Chalcolithic that an increase in figurative complexity can be recorded. The first scenes presenting a more complex narrative structure date to the fourth millennium BC; they refer back, through emblematic episodes, to some mythological themes known from written documents. The cylinder seal was invented in the Middle Uruk period, halfway through the fourth millennium BC; it originated in Southern Mesopotamia or Western Iran. This kind of seal, from its inception, acquired a specific structure and narrative functions, and enabled the development of iconographic motifs of greater complexity. The earliest cylinder seals were used to seal bullae, the hollow clay spheres, which contained so-called tokens. Compared to stamp seals the cylinder-shaped ones allowed extending the decorative motive for any chosen length, and to cover a larger surface when rolled over a cretula or on a tablet, thus

Ninurta /Ningirsu, the god of agriculture and war, who recovered the tablet and returned it to its rightful owner. However, there are different versions of this myth. The banquet scene is another theme that appears during the final stages of the Early Dynastic I period. There are versions with figures drinking from cups or with straws from large jars (cap. 149), typical of Southern Mesopotamia, or eating, the latter more specifically Syrian. This theme will have wide circulation during Early Dynastic II and even more so in Early Dynastic III, in compositions of almost narrative character, bearing strong kinship with similar representations to be found on small plaques and inlays, like on the Ur standard. At the end of this period the ordering in registers became popular. During the Early Dynastic II period the so–called Fara style developed, deriving its name from a city in lower Mesopotamia whose ancient name was Shuruppak. The scenes depicting fights between animals or animals and humans are characterized by a larger proportion of shapes and composition. The figures are distinguished by strong verticality, with animals standing up on their hind legs, while the bodies, for instance those of the lions, intertwine in crossed positions. This change of axis in the composition resulted in the development of more complex configurations. Frequently figures such as the bull-man and that of the hero with curly hair (cap. 123) are depicted. The bull with human head probably represents a frontal stylisation of the bison. The human figures assume a heroic status; they are often naked, in the throes of ferocious beasts, fighting bare-handed or armed with the characteristic dagger with a crescent-shaped hilt. During the Early Dynastic III A a stylistic and compositional evolution can be witnessed, whereby figures become more full-bodied (cap. 53) and their positioning is freer compared to those of the previous period. At the end of this period heroes’ faces are presented in frontal view, bearded, with the characteristic hairstyle in two or three curls arranged on both sides. Seals from the Akkadian period (23th-22nd centuries BC) are distinguishable from those of earlier ages particularly for the at
coeval. The two styles are not sequential, they existed simultaneously. The Jemdet Nasr seals are smaller, chunky and marked by rather schematic compositions, made by drill. The stones utilized are darker and sometimes harder. The most usual themes are depictions of squatting women, the so-called “pigtailed ladies”, most probably craftswomen engaged in various work activities, among which production of pottery and weaving; architectural depictions of temple façades; stylised geometric motifs such as fish-bone, concentric circles and diamond patterns; animals processions, particularly goats, gazelles and fish, the latter at times so stylized as to be hardly recognizable (cap. 51). These were usually arranged in horizontal rows on one or more registers. The seals depicting animals moving towards the temple façade (cap. 9) originate mainly in the region of the Diyala river, North-East of Baghdad, but also from Syria. On the Jemdet Nasr stamp seals depictions of animals, produced by drill, are very common (cap. 52, cap. 86). The lapis lazuli seals often belong to the later Early Dynastic period, albeit with a range of distribution limited to Southern Mesopotamia, particularly in Ur. During the Early Dynastic period most common are the scenes with fighting animals, presented in linear horizontal compositions: predators (usually felines) attacking another animal (generally a goat) frontally from one or two sides. Sometimes a human figure is included, or the bullman, portrayed in the act of attacking the beasts or defending the domestic animals. These so-called “contest scenes” carried a deep symbolic meaning and became one of the main themes recurring on cylinder seals. The motif with the lion-headed eagle Imdugud (Anzû in Akkadian) appears, even if in a schematic shape, in a late phase of Early Dynastic I to be then developed in the Early Dynastic III (cap. 72). According to an Akkadian myth this monstrous creature of divine origin was charged to watch over the so-called "tablet of destinies", the symbol of divine power and heavenly order. Covetous of power, Imdugud stole it from the god Enlil (in the Akkadian version, or the god Enki in the Sumerian one) and was killed by

dian aristocracy made an effort to merge the Sumerian symbolic and ideological heritage with their own, and this is reflected in the utmost care given to the representation of mythological scenes and of the whole complex pantheon of the time, from the main deities to the minor ones. The reorganisation of the pantheon took place by merging the terrestrial Sumerian deitiets with the Semitic astral ones. The gods thus become protagonists of Akkadian glyptics (cap. 56). Many of the divine beings common on Akkadian glyptics remain obscure, due to our incomplete knowledge of the mythological apparatus of the time. An exception are the sun-god Shamash, the one most frequently portrayed on Akkadian seals, and Ea/Enki, the water god, both of whom are easily identifiable thanks to their peculiarities, with which we will deal in depth later. These lesser known gods probably belonged to the sphere of popular belief, while what has come down to us – thanks to written sources – are merely the most important myths of official religion, generally in versions from later periods. The exponential increase in Akkadian glyptics of minor deities – which had a role as mediators between the human and divine worlds – well reflects the growing complexity taking place in parallel in the Akkadian state. The characteristic themes of previous periods, such as the contest scenes, continue being reproduced – although in mechanical form – in neo-Sumerian times, or the Third Dynasty of Ur (21st century BC). However, the trend is to simplify the complex and articulated narration of mythological and heroic background of the Akkadian age, making them into more streamlined scenes, repeated with minor variations. A tendency to standardisation develops, with recurring characters and schematic motifs, traceable to the ritual sphere. The inscription takes on an increasing weight within the composition. The most popular theme of the period (cap. 57) was without a doubt the introduction of the faithful in the presence of a deity seated on a throne. The faithful is represented wearing the typical
tention that engravers were paying to a naturalistic rendition of the human and animal bodies (cap. 91). The narrative aspect was also given more careful consideration, adding movement to the scene. Another distinctive character of seals from this period is the explicit research of symmetry and balance in the representation (cap. 55). Two of the themes that were already common in the Early Dynastic period and that continue being developed in Akkadian times are the banquet scenes and the contest scenes. The latter became the favourite depiction of the Akkadian palace élite. In the contest scenes the pairs of fighters are characterized by increasingly standardized human and animal figures. The interweaving of human and animal bodies loosens and the compositions gain a wider breadth. From the relatively chaotic fights of the Early Dynastic period the tendency to represent individual human-animal duels is established. The decorative continuity of the scene is sacrificed in order to dramatize the depiction of the individual fight. Prevailing is the symmetrical arrangement of two pairs of fighters. A linear style, with highly schematic subjects, is flanked by a naturalistic style, characterized by great care for the realism of the subject represented, for instance in the rendition of muscles and other anatomic details. Serpentine was the preferred stone for contest scenes, but more precious materials were employed as well, such as red and green jasper, rock crystal, spotted black and white diorite and even lapis lazuli, although the latter appears to be less readily available than during the Early Dynastic period. The so-called presentation scenes developed in a more mature phase of the Akkadian age. These scenes had already appeared albeit sporadically – at the end of the Early Dynastic III. They tend to replace the banquet scenes, still popular at the beginning of this period. The presentation theme would enjoy considerable popularity in the following neo-Sumerian period, under the Third Dynasty of Ur, when it assumed considerable institutional importance. Deep religious changes were taking place at this time; the Akka

The scene of presentation (or “mediated audience”) is also typical of the Isin-Larsa period, but in this phase some meaningful variations develop. The interceding goddess Lama is portrayed with both hands raised, and she does not lead the subject or official by the hand any longer, she now stands behind the latter, who then is placed exactly in front of the divinized ruler sitting on a stool (non-mediated audience). Fill-in elements are often included, such as a ball, rod and vase. Other fill-in motifs that are typical of this period are the club with a double lion head, a decapitated human head, a monkey, a bow-legged dwarf, a triton, birds, dogs, flies, porcupines, mullets. The use of hematite becomes widespread at this stage: it will be one of the most widely used stones for the seals in the first half of the second millennium BC. In the Old Babylonian period mediated and non-mediated audiences were gradually replaced by scenes where only standing figures were represented. The two main characters were the king
rolled-brim turban, well known also from the statues of the time, or with a shaved head and beardless; his left arm is held by an interceding goddess who leads him towards the main deity, while his right arm is lifted in a reverential gesture or left dangling by the side. There are no specific markers which help us to attribute a precise identity to the seated divinity, who wears a horned tiara and, usually, the typical flounced wool dress. The seated deity can be replaced by a divinized king, wearing the characteristic headgear of the time and seated on a flounced wool-covered stool. He holds a goblet or small vase in his right hand, representing the symbol of the protection granted to his subordinate and with some relation to the banquet theme. This was an integral part of a ceremonial system intended to consolidate the central authority and the recognition of the established hierarchy. The scene thus carries a precise ideological and political meaning. These seals likely belonged to high rank officials.

The so-called 'naked goddess' - in the classic Babylonian iconography, or that is, full frontal nudity - is represented on a pedestal, thus indicating its function as a statue or in any case, a simulacrum, and it is smaller in size than the other persons depicted. Many hypotheses have been put forth concerning the possible functions of this figure, which often appears in the seals of the Old Babylonian period and the Kassite period (during which the body is depicted frontally and the head in profile): as a deity, a divine simulacrum, or the counterpart of the Naked Hero.
From the iconography of the female frontal nude figure, it is possible to presume her identification with Ishtar in her specific aspect as goddess of love and sexuality. Ishtar was an extremely complex deity, with features as both goddess of war and goddess of love. This dual nature. also evident in the mythological corpus, might correspond to a double representation of the deity. If the 'naked goddess' is the representation of Ishtar as goddess of love and sexuality, her representation next to Ishtar in warlike garb – as in some seals - intended to show the goddess in all her functions and all her powers.
The 'naked goddess' is flanked by the suppliant goddess Lama on the right and, on the other side, by a figure in a martial posture, probably a king, holding a mace with his left hand. To the right of the goddess Lama, there is a 'bull-man' with a human head and torso in frontal view and a lower half with taurine legs depicted in profile. The figure is holding a goat in his arms. Two birds complete the scene, in the upper part of the seal. In the seal space, there is also a cuneiform inscription in three lines:

Edith Porada subdivided the glyptic production of the Mittani period in two styles, the common and the elaborated ones. The seals in the common style are characterized by the repetition of decorative motifs. These were made out in easily fashionable materials, such as steatite (soap stone) or sintered quartz (often described, less accurately as faience; cap. 62), which made mass production possible. Sintered quartz made its appearance in this period. Animals laying down, placed facing each other, were depicted on their own or as part of a composition. A stylized tree is often the focus of the depiction. The most common kind is the so-called bouquet tree. By the two sides of the tree recumbent animal or human figures are arranged in a strongly symmetrical composition. Other scenes frequently depicted are rows of marching men (cap. 82), fish or birds (cap. 175). The elaborate style shows a wider range of themes and the materials employed in the production are different too, generally semi-precious stone. Some of the motifs are directly derived from the Babylonian tradition, such as the deities wearing the typical dress with flounces and the praying figures. Others yet are typical of the Assyrian repertory, such as the trees and winged figures. This style is typified by a veritable horror vacui, wide use is made of fill-ins. The seals from the Kassite period can be classified into four separate styles. The first Kassite style (end of fifteenth century BC to first half of thirteenth century BC) originates from the previous Old Babylonian glyptic tradition, simplifying it. Characteristic is the presence of a vertical inscription occupying most of the figurative area, leaving little space to the drawing. They are generally prayers, often addressed to a personal god, which reflect the new religious climate of this period. The figures (up to a maximum of three) are shown standing or sitting and are more elongated, to adjust to the available space, or the scene is divided in two registers. The identification of the protagonists of the scene is problematic as they are often isolated while the background is filled with a growing number of symbolic elements. The pseudo-Kassite style is derived from the first style and is
and the suppliant goddess, sometimes the only two protagonists on the scene. It is the beginning of a reduction and simplification of the glyptic repertory. At this stage religious themes linked to templar environments were developed. The most frequently represented deities are the sun-god Shamash, walking on a stylized mountain and holding a saw in his right hand; the goddess of love and war Ishtar, armed and with a foot placed on her animal symbol , the lion; and the storm-god Adad holding symbols recalling atmospheric phenomena. Frequent is the depiction, in front of the goddess Lama, of a royal hero. He wears a rolled-brim turban and a triangular dress (probably a warrior garb), he is characterized by a martial posture and by a club or scepter held in the left hand, a symbol of his authority (cap. 60). During the reign of Samsu-iluna (ca. 1750-1712 BC), successor of Hammurabi of Babylonia, seal engraving techniques underwent a radical change: we find evidence of the use of the horizontal drill and the cutting wheel while previously seals were engraved with manual tools. The new technology allowed a faster production of the drawings, but resulted in an impoverishment of the artistic quality in the scenes represented. Starting from the fourth quarter of the eighteenth century BC a distinctive style and iconography developed in Syria (cap. 58). Such characteristics most probably reflect at first the political stability ensured by the powerful kingdom of Yamkhad (Aleppo). Several seals of the Syrian group have all or a part of the drawing laid horizontally, as in cap. 101 belonging to the second Syrian group. This seal shows a figure that became very popular in the Old Syrian seals (during the Middle Bronze age) and Middle Syrian (Late Bronze age), that is the naked goddess represented in the act of disrobing. The scheme with auxiliary motifs separated by guilloche or more complex braids into two rows is particularly common (cap. 67). A winged solar disk is often depicted above a stylized tree.

scenes, even of mythological character, with an archer (cap. 125) in kneeling position, or standing or on a wagon; 3) banquet scenes, sometimes sacred (cap. 69); 4) schematic representations, often characterized by a heraldic scheme, as in the case of kings, winged genies and animals arranged by the sides of the sacred tree, topped by the winged disk, symbol of the god Ashur; 5) devotional scenes (to be defined 1) with representations of the various gods of the Assyrian pantheon. Towards the end of the ninth century BC the motifs were engraved using the drill and cutting wheel (linear style). Stamp seals reappear at this time and – starting from the eighth century BC – gradually replace the cylinder ones as the main kind of seal. The most notable are certainly the so-called “royal seals”: circular in shape, they are known only thanks to the impressions on cretulae and tablets with royal edicts. It is possible that these seals were made of gold and that none reached us as they were likely melted to reuse the precious metal. They sometimes show a short cuneiform inscription and depict on the left the king stabbing by sword a rearing lion before him and symbolizes the enemy. The seal utilised for the administration of the queen’s goods instead show the king and queen facing the goddess Ishtar seated on a throne placed over a lion. On the upper part of the seal is depicted a scorpion, the queen’s symbol. The most direct influence on the Neo-Babylonian glyptic is the Middle Assyrian one. The use of the cutting wheel and the drill resulted at this time in a schematic style similar to the linear one of neo-Assyrian period. The contest scene between heroes and beasts or mythological creatures remains one of the most common themes, as well as the presentation scenes, which sometimes have the king as main actor. The contest scenes could also be made in a modelled style. Some stylistic and iconographic details of this style are typically Neo-Babylonian: for instance the tall headgear with feathers worn by gods and semi-divine creatures and the horned tiaras, the cherubs' wings which - unlike the neo-Assyrian ones – are always of equal length (cap. 63), the duplication of figures, the animals in contorted postures and small plants resembling cacti. Moreover, compared to the Neo-Assyrian seals, the Neo-Baby
distinguished by a lower quality of both execution and materials employed, and a greater level of decoration. The figurative repertory is the same while the inscription is shorter and more standardized. The second Kassite style (ca. 1350-1200 BC) partially overlaps the first style chronologically . New iconographic themes appear, such as the scenes of daily life (for instance hunting and plowing) as well as new characters, like chthonic deities with gushing vessels and hybrid creatures. The scene - often characterized by a tripartite structure - becomes more lively and horizontal inscriptions make their appearance. The third Kassite style starts developing in the thirteenth century BC and fades around 1150 BC, at the end of the Kassite age. Heraldic patterns are formalised at this time, with two animals (or mythical creatures) arranged symmetrically on either side of a plant element. The scenes become more natural and lively. Over time, there is thus a progressive distancing from the Old Babylonian model and an approach to the Middle Assyrian one. Characteristic of the Middle Assyrian period are the contest scenes between heroes, animals and hybrid anthropomorphic creatures (for example, the winged lion, the griffin and the winged bull). A new motif that is introduced in this period, is that of an animal walking or jumping toward a tree. The trend of the time, with the continuing quest for symbolic forms, is towards a form of abstract representation, especially starting at the end of the thirteenth century BC. Other typical elements of glyptic production for the period are the presence of arboreal vegetation and architectural elements (particularly places of worship, in front of which ritual scenes or devotional manifestations directed to the deity who lived in them were held). The latter theme is possibly linked to the fact that building activity becomes more intense in the thirteenth century BC, starting with the reign of Shalmaneser I. The inscriptions, where present, are engraved horizontally in the upper portion of the scene. In the cylinder seals of the neo-Assyrian period the scene is often framed by a horizontal line at the two ends of the seal. The popularity of inscriptions declines. The main themes of the intaglios are as follows: 1) narrative compositions, depicting sieges of enemy strongholds or battles on chariots; 2) hunting

cides with the period of most intense administrative use of this practice in the ancient Near East, that is the first centuries of the second millennium BC, when hematite became by far the most favoured material for the seals. The large concave seals of the Akkadian period (cap. 55, cap. 124, cap. 111, cap. 73) were particularly difficult to unroll on the clay surface, and it is not for a chance that there is little evidence of their administrative use. The seals of this period were, however, engraved on a great variety of beautiful semi-precious stones such as jasper, lapis lazuli, diorite and rock crystal. It is thus possible that some seals of this time were owned more as status symbol than for any practical scope. The use of seals as a status indicator is marked, starting from the Akkadian period, by the frequent addition of ornamental metal capsules attached to both ends of the seal by means of an adhesive that, in Babylonia, was usually bitumen. These capsules leave characteristic parallel grooves along the top and bottom of the impression. In the following neo-Sumerian period, some seals were carved including a stone pseudo-capsule at the ends in imitation of metal prototypes. In the Levant or in Egypt a different system for mounting the seals was developed, it was a metal ring fastened to the cylinder at both ends and allowing its rolling. These supports were made in different ways, in any case starting from a thin metal wire which was inserted through the perforation of the seal and then braided into a ring, otherwise the ends of the wire could be inserted via two through holes at the ends of a thick ring and then wrapped around it (cap. 64). These rings were not simply a handle, but they also allowed to hang the seals on strings or chains and to be worn as rings. It is likely that the idea of the signet rings (of the stamp type) of later periods was born from these prototypes. However, these holders are not necessarily contemporary with the seals, but could have been added at a later time, even much later, and could even be modern.
lonian ones are characterised by a greater dynamism. The hero is almost invariably presented in the act of placing a foot on the body of a creature he is fighting with. The heraldic scheme becomes predominant, with a winged genius at the centre overlooking two animals or mythological creatures to the sides, or the animal at the centre with two genies by its sides. Another typical subject of the Neo-Babylonian period is the priest, beardless and with shaved head, paying homage to the symbols of various divinities. This theme, common on both stamp and cylinder seals, will continue to be present in the Achaemenid period, when this kind of seal was frequently reused. At the end of the Neo-Babylonian period, the iconography of seals becomes increasingly free, with less motifs and much more empty space on the figurative surface. This tendency is even more noticeable in the Achaemenid period. It is undoubtedly an influence of the stamp seal, which – with the disappearance of the cuneiform writing and the introduction of the alphabetical one – becomes again the tool of choice, as it had been before the invention of the cylinder seal. Cylinder seals: shapes and media. Many of the most ancient cylinder seals had a concave surface. This is probably due to the fact that contemporary tablets were convex on their surface. These were shaped in the guise of a soap bar, with rounded edges. In later times the tablets, especially the larger ones, became almost flat on both sides, with thin and straight edges. For this reason a seal that was perfectly cylindrical was best suited to this shape and became commonly used. Starting from the Old Babylonian period we have the first examples of convex cylinder seals (cap. 117), or barrel-shaped. When small enough these could be mounted on a ring. The dimensions of a cylinder seal are a good indication of how widespread the use of sealing was. Sizes could vary from a few centimetres to seals big enough to almost fill the palm of a hand, their shape from short and stocky to thin and long. Smaller seals and the larger ones were difficult to roll, and the ideal size coin

Seals: a particular chapter of Mesopotamian art
Mesopotamian artists thought on a small scale, and their main vehicles of artistic expression were portable objects: vases, clay tablets, seals. As we have seen, the latter are particularly important, because many samples showing different styles and subjects survive for each period. While having a practical application, these finds represent a unique body of artefacts prior to Greek and Roman gems. Furthermore, by preserving images that no longer exist in other figurative representations, they serve as a visual chronicle of style and iconography, for instance, for clothing and peculiar headgear (cap. 68), religious symbols (cap. 69) and so on. Seals represent a unique source of information on the conditions of life in ancient Mesopotamia. No other corpus of images, in fact, offers such an abundance of documentation spanning over a comparable period of time. Glyptic production is undoubtedly one of the most characteristic outputs from the cultures of the ancient Near East; it uses a totally unique figurative language that distinguishes it from other art forms, (see for instance the arrangement of figures in different orientations – vertical and horizontal – cap. 70). It most peculiar aspect consists in the fact that the themes of the chosen representations does not seem to derive from the repertory of Mesopotamian sculpture: the seals’ iconography is almost completely independent from the large sculptural art. To cite just one example: the subjects depicted in the bas-reliefs that decorated Assyrian palaces are often completely different from what we find in neo-Assyrian seals, e.g. some curious hybrid creatures of great decorative impact, as the snake-dragon (cap. 71). As E. Porada suggests, the political circumstances could influence a period’s style. As “miniature art”, the iconography of the seals was, from an ideological and political point of view, consistent with the artistic forms of larger scale such as sculpture, reliefs and wall paintings, while having different themes and subjects. Moreover, it integrated other aspects, such as mythology and religion. The portability of this art enriched its ideologi
cal value, since it was ubiquitous, omnipresent, and lasting. The wish to commemorate significant events and the idea of pictorial representation of a story existed since prehistoric times, but it is only startring with the late fourth millennium that the Mesopotamian artists began to carve on seals what can be defined narrative scenes, even if these particular themes are few compared to those with purely decorative or symbolic aims. From the beginnings of Babylonian narrative art two methods of representation were employed. The preferred one was more indirect than explicit, using the most representative scene - a particular time in history, or the culmination of a series of events - to indicate the whole story. This was undoubtedly meant to awaken in the viewer’s mind the memory of the complete story, a bit like the crucifix in our society, which serves to evoke

the entire passion of Christ and to symbolize the redemption of mankind through his sacrifice. The second method displays the consecutive episodes of a story, often juxtaposed with no clear demarcation: a group of scenes, generally two or three, sums up the whole. Very often narrative scenes refer to mythological tales. An example is represented by a seal depicting the myth of Etana (cap. 74), of which there are several comparisons in seals of the Akkadian period. According to the "Sumerian King List”, Etana, "the shepherd who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign lands" was the thirteenth king of the first dynasty of Kish. On seals, Etana is depicted ascending to heaven carried by an eagle. This image strongly resembles that of the abduction of Ganymede by Zeus (in the form of an eagle), represented in numerous paintings (Correggio, Rubens, Rembrandt), but also in bas-reliefs of Roman age. A drawing by Michelangelo bears a strong resemblance with the iconography of Etana, also due to the presence of a dog. The original drawing has been lost, but several copies and engravings exist.

The seal clearly refers to the myth of Etana, also indicated in the 'Sumerian king list' (cf. ch. 7b) as the thirteenth king of the first dynasty of Kish.
Legend has it that the ruler of Kish, distressed by the fact of not being able to have an offspring due to the infertility of the queen, set off in search of the 'plant of birth', which had appeared to him in a dream. He appealed to Shamash, the sun god, who sent him to seek an eagle. The bird of prey had been thrown into a well with its wings torn by a snake, as revenge for the fact that the eagle had devoured its young. Etana freed the eagle, which out of gratitude decided to carry him to heaven in search of the 'plant of birth'. As for the ending, there are several versions: according to the tragic one, Etana began his ascent transported by the animal and reached his destination but, for reasons that are not clear, at some point they fell to the ground. In the version with a happy ending, instead, Etana was brought before Ishtar. The goddess gave him the 'plant of birth', which he was to eat together with the queen. Thus Etana had a son.
On the seal, the king is depicted as he is being carried to the sky by the eagle. His shepherd dogs lying down, watch him from below by lifting up their heads, along with a person in erect position. In the figurative space, there are also other scenes that recall the pastoral sphere: a herd inside a pen, a seated figure intent on milking a goat with two vases that were probably used to hold the milk, the preparation of cheese in a large bowl by another seated figure, and cheeses placed to dry on a roof.
These dairy preparations, although not described in the myth, are probably a reference to the fact that in the 'Sumerian king list', Etana is defined as 'the shepherd who ascended to heaven and consolidated all the foreign lands'.

was considered the most precious stone of the ancient Near East. In Sumerian and Akkadian literature the comparative expression ‘like lapis lazuli’ implies great luxury. Given the difficulty of sourcing this stone and its particular value, it was generally employed to make small objects: seals, personal ornaments such as beads and amulets, while in statuary it was used to fashion the eyes, hair and beard. Furthermore, for the same reasons, this material was systematically hoarded - both as a raw material and in the shape of processed objects - and recycled. This is proven also by the progressive decrease in the size of cylinder seals in the third millennium BC and their re-use as beads. The great prestige and the magical value attributed to lapis lazuli gave the stone a special role in cult activities: it was used, for example, for the foundation inscriptions of religious buildings. Aside from rare cases, such as that of lapis lazuli, it is not easy to identify the precise places of origin of the stones, but their availability must have influenced fashion, and we can gain a great deal of information on the evolution of commerce through the study of the types of stones used for the seals in different periods. The most popular stone in the Akkadian period was without a doubt serpentine (cap. 77), usually in shades of dark green, almost black. The seals could also be made of green stone (cap. 78); sometimes black and white speckled diorite and the cores of large shells (aragonite) were used, as well as quartz crystals of various kinds, especially jasper (red and green) and rock crystal (cap. 55). Lapis lazuli appears to be less readily available than in the Early Dynastic period. In the post-Akkadian and Ur III periods, serpentine was almost completely replaced by visually similar, although slightly softer, chlorite. Towards the end of the third millennium BC a new material appeared: hematite. It is a iron oxide, dark steel-grey in color, and has a sheen that makes it similar to metal, creating a bright surface iridescence. It became the ultimate material for the production of seals in the Near East during the first four centuries of the second millennium BC (cap. 79). One of its main features is the good rendition of the visual motif, which is clearly visible on the stone and not only on the imprint of the seal itself. Hematite is undoubtedly the most characteristic material of the Old Babylonian period, but in this period also other iron oxides appear, such as goethite and magnetite, which came from the Anatolian volcanic regions accessible via the upper Euphrates . Goethite was used in Mesopotamia, but probably not in Syria and Turkey. Magnetite appeared towards the end of the nineteenth century BC, but was used for less than a century. The softer stones used were mainly black limestone (calcite). A wider variety is found among the hard stones: rock crystal, chalcedony, obsidian, mottled white and red jasper, and, later in the period, amethyst (probably from Egypt). Carnelian and agate (cap. 117) were

Raw materials for the seals: stones and faience.
Seals were generally made in stone, but could also be made in faience, glass, clay, shell, bone, ivory and possibly wood, although the latter did not survive time. The stones in use were generally relatively soft, to ease engraving and processing. The fact that the majority of seals that reached us are mainly in stone does not necessarily reflect – if not in general terms – the actual distribution of the source materials employed in their making. Seals engraved in easily breakable materials, such as clay or glass, had little chances to reach us because of their fragility, while those made of perishable materials – for instance wood – did not survive because of Mesopotamia’s pedoclimatic conditions. As for the shell seals, they are often found worn, chipped or burnt. The kind of stones in use for the seal making were diverse: lapis lazuli, hematite, carnelian, chlorite, marble, quartz, serpentine, jasper (red or green), diorite (white and black), magnetite, chalcedony, agate, steatite, rock crystal, limestone, obsidian. The popularity of stones changed according to place and time. It depended primarily on the availability of raw materials and on the technology employed in the seal’s production. By far the largest part of these stones were not local to Mesopotamia and surely not from the southern flood plain, which had no natural stone resources. The stones where thus mostly imported via long-distance trade in a multi-regional context. It is not surprising then to observe how the artifacts made with materials coming from remote regions were highly prized by the ancient, and represented true status symbols. The technical evolution surely dictated the choice of stones to be used. When the first cylinder seals appeared, the materials used for the perforation – aided by abrasives – were micro-tips in chipped stone and wooden tips. A marked tendency towards a greater use of precious stones was recorded in the more advanced stage of the third millennium BC; this must have required a change in the materials used for the drill bits, i.e. a shift to copper or copper alloys, still using abrasives (possibly oiled emery). The cylinder seals of the Uruk period are, for the most part, obtained from relatively soft limestone. In a late phase harder stones started being employed, and the appearance of lapis lazuli is witness to the existence of long-distance trade. Compared to the Uruk seals, during the Jemdet Nasr period darker and sometimes harder stones (such as rock crystal) were used. Lapis lazuli (cap. 76) started being imported in large quantities and enjoyed great popularity in seal productions during the second quarter of the third millennium BC (Early Dynastic II). These came from a distant land, that is Badakhshan, a region situated in the north-western part of modern Afghanistan and in the south-eastern part of Tajikistan. The lapis lazuli mines of Badakhshan were famous in antiquity. Marco Polo described them too. Lapis lazuli

in Ugarit, on the Syrian coast. The Mittanian seals in “elaborate style” instead continued to be made in semi-precious stones, such as hematite, agate, carnelian, chalcedony and jasper. Chalcedony and jasper were also used for the Kassite seals in the south and for the Middle Assyrian ones in northern Mesopotamia. Chalcedony (cap. 85) clearly predominates among the materials of Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian seals. The range of softer stones employed at this time includes serpentine (especially used for the Neo-Assyrian seals in the linear style of the ninth century BC), various kinds of limestone, chlorite, calcite, and soapstone. At the end of the eighth century BC, when stamp seals began to return in use in Mesopotamia, they were carved in a large variety of stones. However, when forms and motifs became strictly standardized, as in the Neo-Babylonian period, chalcedony of various colors was the most commonly used, with shades of blue being highly prevalent. This preference for chalcedony persisted even in the Achaemenid period, when stained glass became more and more popular for the manufacture of seals, especially in Syria, usually in dull colors that recalled the most favorite harder stones. Limestone was the favorite among soft stones. Sometimes it was black limestone, perhaps imported from Fars in Iran, where this stone was used for the sculptures of Persepolis. From the second half of the sixth century BC, for about two hundred years, the Persians controlled a huge empire. This allowed them easy access to raw materials. They made extensive use of barrel-shaped agate for seals (cap. 83), probably imported as beads and sometimes dyed artificially, but, surprisingly enough, the seals in lapis lazuli from this period are very rare. The taste for colored or exotic materials in the production of seals clearly indicates that there were aesthetic considerations not only about their imprint, but also with respect to how they could appear when they were worn on the chest with pins or around the neck as elements of a necklace (cap. 84). The earliest seals were sometimes in the shape of animals (cap. 86) and often came from a funerary context; these have been interpreted as amulets which ensured protection and luck to their
imported as barrel-shaped beads from the west coast of India (Gulf of Cambay), while the much rarer amazonite (cap. 80) came from the Urals and Kashmir. Clay seals were used occasionally in all periods, but particularly in the Old Babylonian period. Carnelian (cap. 81) is a variety of chalcedony. If we give credit to the textual evidence, and evaluating some Mesopotamian archaeological discoveries in the countries bordering the Persian Gulf, it seems to come from Iran and sub-continental India, via the sea route - the Persian Gulf itself - or following the land route, at least during the third and the second millennium BC. In the series HAR-ra = hubullu (XXII 35), Meluhha, which should correspond to the current Indus Valley, is poetically called ‘the country of carnelian’. The Old Babylonian lexical series abnu shikinshu, a ‘dictionary of the stones’, offers a description of the stones by analogy and specifies their practical use; the outward aspect of carnelian is described as similar to berries of boxwood, making clear reference to redness (Schuster-Brandis 2008, p. 34: 5). This stone was used to make seals, amulets, necklace beads of different shapes and to decorate tiaras and brooches. Carnelian was much appreciated in the Mesopotamian world, and represented, along with lapis lazuli and agate, one of the three most commonly used ornamental stones in the ancient Near East. Towards the middle of the second millennium BC it became possible to mass-produce an opaque material, known as faience (cap. 82), although it would be more accurate to call it sintered quartz, since it has no relation with the terracotta objects decorated with glaze and enamel, such as Faenza ceramics, whence the name. It is a term that has been improperly used for a long time to describe a type of composite material consisting of a crystalline body constituted by a layered structure of sintered quartz and at times glazed on the surface. However inadequate, the term is too deeply rooted in the literature to be abandoned. Sintered quartz was simple to engrave and the seals could therefore be easily produced in large quantities. This led to a decrease in artistic quality and to the repetition of some popular motifs. A workshop for the production of sintered quartz seals and other objects was excavated

manufacture of the tablet could be simply achieved by kneading a single lump of clay, or with a more sophisticated technique, with small strips joined one to the other by wetting them: the external ‘envelopes’ (used to contain texts inside) were made this way. Sometimes a core of coarser clay was lined with finer material (Taylor – Cartwright 2011). The drawbacks associated with the use of clay as a writing medium were considerable: corrections could be made only instantaneously, and once the surface was dry, adding to it was impossible. The shape and the size of a tablet had to be planned in advance, in relation to the length of text to be written on it; in this respect some problem could surely arise when (not a rare case) the message was dictated to the scribe on the fly, such as the epistolary messages destined to immediate forwarding (Charpin 2004:41). The largest number of tablets were rectangular, with writing on consecutive lines along the short side (only in Late Babylonian it was along the long side). After the Obverse, the lower edge was inscribed, then the Reverse and, finally, possibly the upper edge; the tablet was scrolled along its horizontal axis, not rotated front to back like our pages, although some rare examples of this kind of use exist. As for sizes, on average a tablet could fit in the palm; on the other hand some specimens had sides that could reach 30 or 40 centimetres and be up to 8 centimetres thick (Taylor 2011: 6). Moreover, the great plasticity of clay allowed making a great variety of shapes on which to apply writing; if in Sumerian times cone or nail-shaped texts were frequent (cap. 90), in the first millennium BC large multi-sided prisms or cylinders were shaped (cap. 17), bearing the deeds of Assyrian and later kings, while coeval loan contracts could also be written on small triangular tablets. Inscriptions could even be carved on architectural decorations, in the shape of a stretched hand, with a row for each finger (Frame 1991) and, finally, on realistic replicas of sheep livers as a ‘practical guide’ for extispicy techniques. Administrative and epistolary texts were sometimes enclosed within an envelope made with a thin strip of clay (cap. 89) to
owners. A text of the Neo-Assyrian period (KAR 185) clearly illustrates some of the magic powers (not always positive) that were attributed to the precious stones:
« A seal of hematite (portends) that the man shall lose what he has acquired. A seal of lapis lazuli (portends) that he shall have power; his god shall rejoice over him. A seal of rock crystal (portends) that he shall enlarge profits; his name shall be good. A seal of ZU.TU.UD.AŠ* (portends) that he shall walk in joy of heart. A seal of green marble (portends) that (until he comes) to the grave, favor upon favor shall be bestowed upon him. A seal of carnelian (portends) that the ‘persecutor’ shall not be released from the body of the man. » (Goff 1956, p. 27)
* the word refers to an unidentified stone
The magical significance attributed to certain stones must have guided the choice of raw materials to be used for the seals. Protective properties, linked to fate in general or to health, could be attributed both to the material itself and to the decorative motifs (Reiner, 1995: 127).
The scribe’s tools: clay, reed, metal, wood
The primary material for the production of tablets was clay, readily available in the damp Mesopotamian flood plain (on the banks of rivers and canals) and prized for its plasticity. However, this material had to be carefully polished, to purge it of impurities or encased small stones, straw, shells etc. before it could be inscribed: in some texts from Mari (eighteenth century BC) we find complaints by someone who has run out of clay, and the reference is to the supply of structured material ready to be used.

copies, with an amount yet to be published possibly just a little lower (Streck 2010). Perhaps reed is, after clay, the defining element of ancient Mesopotamia. Two distinct species, Phragmites australis and Arundo donax, are well attested in the Mesopotamian flood plain for different purposes, but the second, the so-called ‘giant reed’, appears to be the one used to make the stylus (in Akkadian qan tuppi, literally ‘tablet reed’) with which cuneiform writing would be made our. A part of the stem was cut with a saw, and then split with a chisel. The external surface of the reed, shiny and
protect the texts from damage, or to keep the content hidden and, as necessary, to allow the affixing of a seal on the casing. The exterior had an inscription that was a summary of content or information on the identity of the writer. To prevent the tablet and envelope from sticking together, it is likely that the scribes waited for the text to be completely dry before preparing the envelope (Taylor in Radner-Robson 2011: 20). The archiving of the clay tablets (e.g. baskets, cap. 88) followed rules of storage space and times of preservation, related to contingencies and content: surely the libraries of tablets, which included materials to be repeatedly consulted, were planned for a long-term permanence, whether they were of scientific, predictive, literary, lexical or even historiographic nature; these tablets could also be oven-baked to make them last longer and, in any case, often new copies were made. On the contrary, the archives of common use (including accounting, administrative, legal texts and letters) were not normally designed by their authors for a long life (on average ca. 30 years), even if they were related to public institutions (Pedersen 1998); once their bureaucratic or communicative function was exhausted, the tablets could be thrown in mass into landfills, if not reused as ‘tiles’ to line a floor and raise its level. Another possibility was that of ‘recycling’ the tablets, which was obtained by soaking the surface and reformatting the clay for a new writing job (Faivre 1998). After all, because their drying was done by air (but not in the too strong sun), even when well-compacted and solid, clay surfaces could, under certain environmental conditions, be exposed to a gradual corrosion, or to fragmentation due to accidental falls or even deliberately (e.g. contracts were cancelled by breaking the tablet they were written on). However, as we know, the burning of public Mesopotamian buildings caused by enemy fury reduced to ashes many types of objects, but not the tablets, which indeed received a ‘biscuiting’ - in the potters’ lexicon – which proved very useful for their long-term conservation. This essentially explains why the number of tablets that reached down to us (and so far published) amount to more than half a million

deer, an abundant animal species in the highland areas such as Anatolia: not surprisingly, the texts in Hittite cuneiform do not show traces of residual organic reed as sometimes found in those written in Mesopotamia (Cammarosano 2014). On the other hand, clay was not the only material used as a surface for writing in Mesopotamia and neighboring regions: extensive use was in fact also made of wooden, bone or ivory boards covered with wax. As we know from the texts themselves and especially from archaeological discoveries (from the Uluburun shipwreck of the late second millennium or from Nimrud and Assur in the Neo-Assyrian period), small boards with raised edges and filled with beeswax to be written (and then to be erased and re-used) were often joined in pairs to form a diptych – or perhaps even more extended ‘triptychs’ or ‘polyptychs’ - and widely employed for short-term notations, plans and drawings, or even temporary texts to be later copied in their final form on clay tablets. The discovery of bronze styluses that ended with a sharp tip (and at the opposite extreme with a sort of spatula) in the Hittite
waterproof, prevented the absorption of moisture from the clay and its sticking to the writing surface, exempting the scribes from cleaning and drying, which would be required with a wooden stylus. The length of the stylus is estimated at around 5-6 cm, but could have been shorter. As for the writing technique, one may ask: was the stylus held in the palm of the hand or sticking out of it? And was the palm facing up or down, or maybe somewhere in between the two? Physiologically, the supine position (palm down) seems easier when moving from horizontal to vertical sections, especially in the case of a short stylus to be held in the palm. But the problem is still open, although 3-D digital photography techniques are taking research closer to the understanding of this ancient technique. Next to reed other materials for the making of the writing stylus on clay were in use in the ancient Near East: archaeological finds from various periods demonstrate the use of bone (especially in Syria) and literary texts mention the existence of gold and silver styluses, which might also have existed, but should only have had ceremonial or cultic functions. It is currently believed, also through experimental archaeology, that horn and bone were used too, specifically of

Finally, cuneiform writing was also used on corrosive-resistant materials such as metal and stone. In these cases (cap. 75) the cuneiform signs were to be scratched or engraved with completely different techniques from those used for clay or wax; e.g. for metal an iron punch could be used, which in subsequent rounds produced the ‘wedge’ and then the ‘line’ typical of cuneiform signs. Although the signs kept their three-dimensional shape on these hard surfaces, their appearance was radically different from their counterparts on soft media.

more) animals, and also the major Mesopotamian demons, the hideous hybrids Lamaštu and Pazuzu, were of divine substance. But this is not all: identified as divine were also numerous elements that today we would classify as inanimate, such as stars, planets, and other celestial bodies, as well as mountains and rivers and even man-made objects (temple and city gates, cultic platforms, crowns, beds, weapons, musical instruments, and war emblems) and even some illnesses (such as epilepsy, which also in the Greek world was long considered the 'sacred disease' par excellence). However, many of these identifications with the 'divine' seem to be only occasional or to change with the different periods: thus the Tigris River is often deified, but not always, whereas the Euphrates almost never is, unlike its two tributaries, the Balih and Habur. And finally, in a few cases, we find a type worship that was deliberately aniconic, such as for the 'cult of the empty throne' attested at Mari and Ebla in the late 3rd millennium; here the numinous element is constituted by the iconographic absence of a divine figure, or its replacement with a symbol, e.g. during the periodic ritual offerings of foodstuffs (Durand 2005). However, in order to emerge from the veritable 'jungle' of divine attributes in so many, and so different, aspects of ancient Mesopotamian reality, it may be worthwhile to reflect on the fact that a numinous aura of power was largely attributed to all those forces that were thought to have an impact,for better or for worse, on everyday life: therefore, not only the great anthropomorphic deities (e.g,. the god of justice Shamash), but also secondary or peripheral divine figures (cap. 96). Another characteristic of Mesopotamian deities was that of instilling a 'reverential' fear - a mixture of actual fear, fascination, and a humbling sense of mankind's limits - as in the case of the deified cosmic forces, from heaven (Anu) to the sun (Shamash), from the moon (Sîn) to the storm (Adad), but also as for tangible forces operating in the world, such as Truth and Justice; and naturally, as for forces totally opposite to them, such as the agents of chaos and destruction. Another aspect of the divine is linked to awe: its brightness or radiance, so as to amaze, stun, or fascinate the onlooker by virtue of its power, not only as a prerogative of the anthropomorphic gods but also of the astral forces. One last point to note is that a deification by association could take place: thus even the doors of a god's house of worship or the platform where its statue was placed could be deified; and the latter, insofar as it 'contained' the god in effigy, was believed to emanate the same radiance as the divine figure itself.
Mankind and the gods in Mesopotamia
Frederick Mario Fales - Roswitha Del Fabbro
The divine was all-pervasive in the society of ancient Mesopotamia, yet despite the abundance of literary references (myths, hymns, prayers) and iconography (seals, bas-reliefs, statuary) in which it figured, it is still largely indefinable from the conceptual point of view (cap. 93, cap. 94, cap. 92, cap. 97). The divine sphere was extremely broad and fluid: to the extent that even the answer to the fundamental question, "What was a god in Mesopotamia?", is likely to be neither simple nor short (Porter 2009). Certainly, all the cultures of the ancient Near East accepted the polytheistic system as a shared form of their religious identification (Biga - Capomacchia 2008). Polytheism, based on an intrinsic perception of the gods as active agents with specific functions and roles according to their own structural, collective, and institutional dynamics, allowed for the entry of more and more new cults and divine figures, even though the local practices and theological superstructures were framed by local or regional traditions (Pongratz-Leisten 2011). But to what extent was a god perceived as 'ours' and therefore venerable with a sense of exclusivity and when, instead, was it considered as a god 'of others' or - as a further solution - regarded as a figure accepted as the heritage 'of everyone'? There does not seem to be a single or fixed 'rule' on the plurality of forms of perception and veneration of the divine. However, an effort to sum up the aspects that represent the definition of a deity in Mesopotamia, at least from the mid3rd millennium BC, has established that there were three: (a) the deity has its own distinctive name, marked by a particular prefixed sign (the 'determinative', which is DINGIR in Sumerian, and ilu in Akkadian); (B) it is explicitly defined as a 'god' or may behave in the manner of a deity, such as giving blessings or receiving prayers; (C) it may receive, as an exclusive prerogative, an offering of foodstuffs from the faithful at its sanctuaries. The latter criterion certainly applies to the perception of the god by the ruling class through official cults held in various cities. The common people must have also participated in mass in the annual festivities in honor of the gods, but for now, we know little or nothing about this aspect (Oppenheim 1980). On the other hand, it may be noticed that a god did not always have exclusively anthropomorphic characteristics; for example, there are representations that show gods with a human torso with lower parts that depict natural elements (mountains, water, etc.) or that blend anthropomorphic parts with symbols (such as the winged sun disk, etc.). In addition, some deities were depicted as hybrids between humans and animals or between two (or

spread 'cultural network' between the Mediterranean and Western Asia (especially in the 1st millennium BC). In most cases, on the other hand, the distinctive elements of Mesopotamian mythology are numerous and profound. First of all, it has been shown (Jacobsen 1986) that each of the Sumerian city-states of the 3rd millennium BC had its own specific tutelary deity, based in a central sanctuary; however, this correspondence (one city = one god) did not prevent the entire country of Sumer from possessing a unified pantheon, even beyond political divisions, which were at times bitter, between the cities themselves. Just how this dual arrangement came to be created is not clear, but there you have it: certainly, major Sumerian gods personified forces/natural aspects of collective interest, such as the sun (Utu / Shamash), wheat (the goddess Nisaba), love and beauty (Inanna /Ishtar), and the cosmic water that is believed to exist under the earth and, as such, they were for everyone. The gods were connected through relationships and genealogies, mostly within three generations; different local variations were then slowly eliminated over the course of the 3rd millennium, also as a result of political changes (W.G. Lambert). The 'rule' of one city = one god functioned mainly in the sense that the chief god gave his patronage and protection to its urban location; this did not exclude other gods, considered to be of lesser rank, from also being worshiped in his temple. A case of double patronage reigned in Uruk, home to both the father of the gods Anu and the goddess Inanna: perhaps the original subdivision of the town into two villages can explain this diarchy. In other cases, it is possible that ethno-linguistic affiliation may have created distinctions: thus the Sun-god Utu was revered in the Sumerian city of Larsa, while its Semitic counterpart Shamash was the patron of Sippar, further to the north. In conclusion, we can talk about some contiguity (clan kinship - generations - functional differences) between the Greek pantheon on Olympus and the one in Mesopotamia, but not of any real matches. A key reason for the differences lies in the fact that Homer's Iliad and Hesiod's Theogony reflect individual po
In a nutshell, in Mesopotamia the deity was viewed as the sum of its parts: and the larger the number of its parts, the greater the 'density' of the deity in question. All this, as has been said, is implemented according to a perspective of 'addition'; there is no Mesopotamian text that has left us with any image of the divine figure according to a comprehensive and coherent synthesis, such as to satisfy our Western mindset. The deities were present in many forms and in multiple locations at any time: thus, Shamash was present both in the sun, in his temple, and in the various manifestations of worship dedicated to him (e.g., in his actions of divine justice, such as his approval given to the 'code of laws' written by Hammurabi of Babylonia). What is clear, nevertheless, is that each deity operated in its own sphere of primary attributes provided with limits that could not be crossed: the moon god Sîn could not invade or cover the sphere of the sun god Shamash and vice versa, and Marduk was not the primary god in Assyria, as on the contrary, Ashur was not the primary god in Babylonia.
Accustomed as we are since having read the Iliad in school to the notion of a Greek pantheon consisting of many gods and goddesses, in which the major gods of Mount Olympus stand out often passionately capricious -, we inevitably tend to search the entirety of divine figures in Mesopotamia for a structure that may be somewhat comparable, perhaps as a prototype or archetype of the divine horizon illustrated by Homer (and by Hesiod). In some cases, this kind of research has provided positive feedback; for example, the Epic of Atrahasis narrates that the gods drew lots with their names for the division of the cosmos: Anu got the sky, Enlil the earth, and Enki the barrier blocking the ocean, and this partition of lots between related gods was taken up with several similarities in the Iliad with regard to Zeus (sky), Poseidon (sea), and Hades (Hell), although there the Earth was considered common to all the gods (Burkert 1999). So here we have a small piece of evidence of how common conceptual and ideological patterns, including ideas about the gods, circulated in a vast and wide

cient populations may have also found some difficulties in this sense. Therefore, to make their identification easier, the deities began to be represented wearing a headdress with one or more pairs of horns, which appear for the first time at the end of the Early Dynastic period. However, this rule was not always observed, and the gods sometimes appear devoid of any distinctive element. In these extreme cases, in order to define a figure as divine, it is necessary to find more clues, such as its formal role within the scene and its relationship with the other characters or elements depicted. The carvers of seals had to deal with a complex pantheon consisting of many gods with very different characteristics on the one hand, and on the other, with a small space that did not allow them excessive iconographic detail. Therefore, they were forced to establish the minimum number of persons to display, adopting a limited figurative apparel and leaving the task of revealing the identity of the protagonists in the scene to their so-called 'attributes' (objects, symbols, or particular animals relating to the deities) and to the action depicted.
Gods of creation and gods of war: Enlil and Marduk; Ashur and Ishtar
The god Enlil was one of the highest deities of the Mesopotamia pantheon, in that he decreed fates and assigned kingships; he is sometimes referred to as the 'King of Heaven and the Netherworld'. The god, mostly quoted as the son of the forefathers of the gods, Anu and the goddess Aruru, is attested since the most archaic texts. An accredited Sumerian etymology of his name is 'Lord of the Wind/Air', thus making him the central element of a possible 'vertical' cosmological triad, composed of Anu (sky) Enlil (atmosphere) - Enki (earth). However, this hypothesis is not accepted by everyone.
etic voices (although probably assembled from various earlier traditions), while the Mesopotamian pantheon encompassed a vast mass of (a) lists of gods, (b) prayer texts, and (c) works of literature, created in different times and environments, between the 3rd and the 1st millennium BC. In short, the pantheon of Sumer and Akkad is documented through a collective theological thinking that was complex and at times contradictory, even with partisan tendencies; it constituted an important sector within the massive effort of ancient Mesopotamian man to describe the world (visible or not) through the written word in all its details. Be this as it may, the extensive Babylonian list called An = Anum, which lists approximately 2,000 deities and was compiled in the late 2nd millennium, allows us to deduce a first inner hierarchy as follows: Anu - Enlil (with Ninurta) - Ninhursag - Ea (with Marduk) - Sîn - Shamash - Adad – Ishtar. Listed for each deity were the name of his wife (or husband for the goddesses Ninhursag and Ishtar) and those of the couples' children; then there were the names of the different divine subordinates officially connected to the main deity (not just the various divine viziers, but even the gods of the individual specializations going back to the chief god, such as the metalworker-gods for Ea). With time, this vast theological framework would undergo some simplifications, often through mergers of many gods into a smaller number of figures. In light of this complexity, the problem of the possibilities and limits of the identification of Mesopotamian deities in iconographic representations arises, especially regarding the vast number of (cylinder or stamp) seals that portray them, but also in other figurative art forms (cap. 95, cap. 98). In general, the inhabitants of ancient Mesopotamia represented the major gods of their pantheon in human form. The visual similarity between gods and men has obviously complicated the efforts of modern observers to understand the scenes represented, and sometimes even to distinguish between the deities and the mortals.

The figure, standing with his hands clasped on his bare chest, is dressed from the waist down in a flounced woolen skirt (the so-called kaunakes). On the front of the statue are the outlines of two feet, while the sides and back of the stone are smooth, so as to form a broad uncarved area.
A text in Sumerian cuneiform script – which presents abrasions and breaks - is engraved on the right arm from the shoulder to the elbow, in three lengthwise lines with a further division in boxes within the lines: “Lugal-bad? -, son of Ur-é-gibil?, by profession (??) ..., for the [life] of his wife [and children], [has dedi]cated (this statue).”
Given the conditions of preservation, the translation provided is to be considered largely hypothetical. The very structure of the text is open to different hypotheses: we might have to do with a totally private dedicatory inscription, or with a text written by a courtier in favor of his king as well as of his own family. But of course other reconstructions of the context, differing from the two suggested here, are also possible.
The origin of the statuette is also open to interpretation, on the basis of known figurative and textual data. While the text has some points of contact with the private inscriptions of southern Mesopotamia, and especially with those of Nippur, it should also be said that the iconography finds a good parallel with the statuary from the Middle Euphrates region, and particularly with that of Mari (modern Tell Hariri). Around the middle of the 3rd millennium BC, Mari was a major center of economic and cultural connections between Mesopotamia and Syria; therefore, in essence, it cannot be entirely ruled out that the piece may come from Mari itself or neighboring areas.

poem 'Enlil and Ninlil' which tells of the seduction of the goddess by a highly lustful Enlil and the birth of their offspring, which included Ningirsu, the moon god Nanna (Su'en in Semitic), and Nergal, the god of war, death, and plague (also mentioned in the legends on seals, cap. 79, cap. 126). With the rise of the Babylonian dynasty, Enlil gradually lost his importance with respect to Marduk; but the myth of Anzu also tells of the growing cult of his son Ninurta. Nevertheless, the Code of Hammurabi indicates that the king had been designated by Enlil. Finally, in Assyria the preeminence of Enlil went on for centuries, gradually merging with the figure of the local god Ashur.
The god Marduk was the supreme god of Babylon, where his temple, Esagila, and the temple tower Etemenanki (whose size and opulence is commemorated in the biblical story of the Tower of
At all events, the power and the preeminence of Enlil may be grasped in a series of epithets related to nature, to humanity, and to the gods themselves: 'Great Mountain', 'Father of mankind (literally, of black-headed people)' , and 'Father of all the gods'. In the Akkadian myth of Anzu, which is part of the poetic cycle dedicated to his son Ninurta, and which was also part of the theology and annual cultural activities of Nippur, Enlil holds the 'tablet of destinies', the possession of which involves the command of the whole world; while in the self-celebratory inscription by King Lugalzaggesi, it is Enlil who gave him kingship, as he then likewise did for Ur-Namma. Enlil's command was unalterable, without remission; even though in the Babylonian myth of Atrahasis, he had to review his initial decision to destroy humanity through famine, plague, and the Flood. His wife was Ninlil, as we know from the mythological Sumerian

precise theological-political purposes; the poem served to disseminate, proclaim, and justify Marduk's 'rise to power' as the chief deity of Babylonia, so as to even supplant Enlil at the head of the local pantheon. In essence, the text glorifies the rise of Marduk, first through the reconstructed family genealogy of the god, then through the story of his victorious battle against Tiāmat, and finally, through granting him fifty 'names' or epithets, taken up from the existing lexical lists of deities, which placed the new god solidly within the traditional pantheon (Seri 2006). Precisely this list of names should have ensured that the fame of Marduk would be imperishable, for as long as mankind would still able to read and write (7: 143-48):
« With the name 'Fifty', the great gods proclaimed him whose names are fifty and made his way supreme. Let them be kept in mind and let the elder (scholar) explain them. Let the wise and the intelligent discuss them together. Let the father repeat them and thus instruct his son. Let them be known (even) to the shepherd and the herdsman. » (translation by Michalowski 1990)
In seals that depict him, the figure of the god Marduk is sometimes replaced by one of his symbols, a pointed spade (marru in Akkadian), such as in a scene of worship of the god, also showing the winged disk which is the symbol of the god Ashur (cap. 100; cf. also cap. 69, where we find both the divine symbols). The animal associated with the god is the mythological mushkhushshu, a composite dragon (scaly skin, bird-like hind legs, feline front paws, long neck and tail, with a horned snake's head), which is depicted, for example, on the Ishtar Gate in Babylon, built by Nebuchadnezzar II in 575 BC (now in the Berlin Museum).
The god Ashur, the deity who would become the mirror counterpart and the maximum rival in heaven and on earth of Marduk, was actually born as the simple patron god of the homonymous city built on a rocky outcrop on the middle stretch of the Tigris River. Thus it is a case of a real numen loci, who appears to have had no direct counterpart in ancient Mesopotamia: at most, one could cite the parallel of Athena for Athens in later times (Livingstone 1997). Since the 21st century BC onward, when it was a mere provincial centre in the reign of the Ur III Dynasty, the city of Assur (also Ashur) made itself independent and the temple of the local deity began to be built on its highest area, well visible above the river. The deity was fed with first-fruits from a large agricultural hinterland surrounding its urban seat. In the few official documents that have reached us regarding this first phase (Old Assyrian period, ca. 2000-1800 BC), there is nothing to denote an aggressive religious ideology, based on war and territorial conquest focusing on the god Ashur; and, indeed, in some texts of the rulers at that time, who were considered as mere
Babel) were located. This god is primarily known to us by way of the epic poem Enūma Elish (from the introductory text, Enūma elish la nabû shamāmū, 'when the sky above did not yet have a name'), better known as the 'Epic of Creation'. The text has survived in copies from the first half of the 1st millennium BC, but it was probably composed at the end of the 2nd millennium (the Kassite period) and also shows older materials. It was recited every year at the New Year's Feast (akitu, celebrated around March 15th) in Babylon, according to a tradition that arose in Ur at the end of the 3rd millennium (Sallaberger 1993). During the several days of the Akitu, the ritual and especially the recitation of the poem, were intended to emphasize the restored cosmic order and the renewed institutionalization of the local and supraregional cult for the current year, as a sort of renewed enthronement of the god. The poem is essentially a hymn to Marduk and describes his rise to the top of the Mesopotamian pantheon. Beginning with the creation of the world, when only the divine beings Apsû and Tiāmat, i.e. the fresh terrestrial waters and the salty marine waters, existed. the poem narrates, first with a genealogical and then with an epic approach, how the god Marduk became eventually king of the gods and how his order was finally established in the universe. Apsû was killed by his son Ea, who assumed the crown as the head of the gods himself, with an action that was reproduced in part in the primordial Greek mythology described in the Theogony by the poet Hesiod (8th-7th centuries BC). However, it was Tiāmat who possessed the fundamental 'tablet of destinies', and she entrusted it to her son Kingu. Tiāmat then rallied the older cosmic powers while the younger gods elected as their champion Marduk, who then challenged the goddess-sea monster: in essence, the true epicentre of the narrative is the primordial battle between Marduk and Tiāmat (Col. 4, ll. 93-103): Marduk's victory thus saves the gods and opens the way for the construction of the cosmos, and finally, for the creation of man as a servant working for the gods themselves. The etymology of the divine name 'Marduk' was much discussed (Jacobsen 1968): one might think of an original Sumerian form * amar-utu-(ak) as 'Son of the Sun' or 'Son of the Storm'. Of these, the latter seems the interpretation most appropriate to the deity, as described in Enūma Elish itself. So when Marduk is armed for battle, he is preceded by lightning and fills his body with burning flames (4. 39-40). When speaking of his birth, the text says that he possessed and controlled the Four Winds, bequeathed to him by his grandfather Anu (4.41-44 and 1.105 ff.). He himself produces further natural phenomena: he generates the storm, the whirlwind, the hurricane, and the wind of '4 limbs', the wind of 'seven limbs', the sandstorm, and the 'wind without rivals' (4.45- 46), and his greatest weapon is the 'cyclone' or the 'storm of the Flood' (abūbu, 4.49). However as this may be, Enūma Elish proved to have also had

have known the first development of an ideology of retaliation, perhaps fueled by the experience of armed war in which the Hurrians themselves excelled. What is certain is that after this phase, the religious and political scenario centered on the god Ashur changed radically. And at that stage, and especially at the end of the 14th century BC, we find the first formulation of the idea of kingship on theocratic foundations, according to which Ashur (and other gods of the local pantheon) held the cosmic power and the legitimate authority to incite the king and his people to conquer the surrounding regions. The first hint of this lies in the words addressed to the king by the High Priest during that Middle Assyrian coronation rite:
« May Ashur and Mullissu, the lords of your headdress, cover you with it for a hundred years! May your foot be acceptable in the Ekur and your hands in the bosom of Ashur, your god! Before Ashur your god, may your priesthood and that of your children be acceptable. With your just sceptre, enlarge your land! May Ashur grant you the capacity to command, to listen, to answer prayers, of truth, and of peace » (translation by Fales 2015)
It is this transfer of powers from the god Ashur – risen to the top of a veritable pantheon in the Middle Assyrian period – to the king who, without abandoning his previous role as 'representative', now also assumed personal traits of moral virtue and attributes of physical prowess, thus placing himself within an intermediate cosmic space between the divine and pure and simple humanity, which achieved the elevation of Assyrian kingship to the highest levels in history. In essence, starting in the 14thcentury BC, the vision of a single political and ideological centre, the 'land of Ashur'
'representatives' of the deity, it is rather difficult to distinguish the outlines of this local god from Enlil, the beneficial pan-Mesopotamian figure. A relatively dark phase followed for a century and more, when the city of Assur was subjected to vassalage under the Hurrian state of Mittani, and even its temple was looted; this phase may

- will increasingly take on the role of 'Holy See' and privileged place of pilgrimage for the whole of Assyria. The theological growth of the god Ashur is precisely fixed in the Middle Assyrian period through his equivalence with Enlil, the Sumerian 'king of the gods'. In paral
lel, Ninlil, the wife of Enlil, will become the wife of Ashur, under the local dialectal name of Mullissu; the city of Assur will take on the nickname Libbali, the 'inner city' (or the citadel par excellence), borrowing this designation from Nippur, the ancient religious capital of Sumer; and the central temple will be named Esharra ('home of the universe'), like the sanctuary of Enlil at Nippur. The sacred city thus becomes a new Nippur, on which to build the 'destiny' of the king as the conqueror of the world. One of the most coveted objectives for the political and ideological ideal of unifying all the surrounding territories under Assyrian rule, was actually represented by the conquest of Babylonia itself, with its ancient 'holy cities' and those cultural prerogatives of antiquity, sacredness and knowledge for which the southern region was famous. Crucial in this respect will be the theological rise of Ashur to equal and surpass Marduk, the god of the second generation who had replaced Enlil in the mythological-epical Babylonian complex. This orientation began with Sargon II (722-705 BC), who decreed the equivalence of Ashur with (the similar-sounding) Anshar, one of Marduk's ancestors in the Poem of Creation, and reached its climax with Sennacherib (704-681 BC), who razed to the ground the southern capital in 689. However, the clearly anti-Babylonian policy of Sennacherib - who had moved the New Year's Feast to the religious capital of Assur - was followed by a precise 'counter-reform' of Esarhaddon (680-668 BC), aimed at fully restoring the cults and festivities, as well as the political prerogatives, of Babylon.
The goddess Inanna (in Sumerian) or Ishtar (in Semitic) is one of the most complex divinities of ancient Mesopotamia, with contradictory and even paradoxical traits; she has been described as
began to be established, leading to the development of the practice of a military conquest (seen as the imposition of the 'yoke of Ashur') with regard to a vast periphery, conceived as 'other' and 'different' (Postgate 1992). The iconography of the god Ashur is often expressed through a series of individual or composite symbols: a winged disk, sometimes provided with horns, from which rippling sunrays radiate (cap. 99); a circle or a wheel, suspended from the wings, enclosing a warrior in the act of shooting an arrow with a bow. The symbols of the figure are likewise common to other gods: a rod (curved or maybe soft) and a ring, interpreted as measuring emblems. Other interpretations are based on a pastoral staff (or ferule) and a nose ring. The overall characteristics of the Assyrian ideological agenda were repeated by all the successive kings, although with a number of minute variations, until the violent and definitive fall of the last imperial capital, Nineveh, in 612 BC. Two examples of this may suffice: at the end of the 12th century BC, King Tiglath-pileser I already stated clearly that:
« The god Ashur and the great gods who exalt my kingship, who granted as my lot power and strength, commanded me to extend the borders of their land. They placed in my hands their mighty weapons, deluge in battle.»
While, a few decades before the end of the imperial experience of the Neo-Assyrian period (9th -7th centuries BC), the long-lived King Ashurbanipal (668-631 BC) could still repeat the formula of enthronement of the previous centuries, attributing to the god Ashur's power the essence of his own huge cosmic, political, and military power;
« Ashur is King – indeed Ashur is King! Ashurbanipal is the representative of Ashur, the creation of his hands. May the great gods make firm his reign, may they protect the life of Ashurbanipal, king of Assyria! May they give him a straight sceptre to extend the land and its people. May his reign be renewed, and may the gods consolidate his throne forever! May they bless the king every day, month, and year, and protect his rule! In his reign, may there constantly be rains from the heavens and floods from the underground sources! May our lord Ashurbanipal be granted long days, copious years, strong weapons, a long reign, years of abundance, a good name and fame, happiness and joy, auspicious oracles, and leadership over all (the other) kings! »
Therefore, over time Ashur would evolve from a mere numen loci to an actual 'total god' for the community that he aims to protect, in isolation vis-à-vis the other 'great gods'. The latter are honored in temples and chapels throughout the country, but Ashur is revered only in the eponymous city, which - especially after having lost its original function of political capital under King Ashurnasirpal II (858-824 BC)

Inanna and Enki). However, in other traditions she is defined as the daughter of Anu or of the moon god Nanna/Su'en/Sîn and the latter's wife, Ningal/Nikkal; yet elsewhere, she is the sister of the Sun god Utu - Shamash. The latter god grants Inanna/Ishtar in marriage to the shepherd (and god of vegetation) Dumuzi without her consent, but she then convinces her husband to court her properly. These aspects are contradicted by the figure of the goddess in the Epic of Gilgamesh, written at a later date; here Inanna/Ishtar, taken by the young hero, invites him to become her lover, but Gilgamesh rejects her, accusing her of having had a series of past lovers whom she had abandoned or destroyed. One trait that is common to the various manifestations of this figure is her sexuality and sensuality; not surprisingly, Inanna/Ishtar was the recipient of prayers to solve symptoms of impotence or cases of unrequited love (Leick 1994). The role of the goddess in the legitimization of sexual potency was also expressed in the ceremony of the 'sacred marriage', which celebrated the marriage of the goddess with her husband Dumuzi - represented respectively by the high priestess and by the king – during the New Year's Feast, as a means of ensuring prosperity and the abundance of crops. Even the iconography of Inanna/Ishtar is remarkably intricate. Originally Inanna was the goddess of earth and fertility, an aspect highlighted by the bunch of dates that she often holds in her hand in artistic representations. Her naked representation, linked to fertility, became especially popular in Syria, where the goddess was variously identified with Astarte, Anath, Asherah, and Ashtaroth in West Semitic and Canaanite religion (cap. 108). She is sometimes
'ambiguity incarnate', constantly straddling the barrier between
male and female, between adult and child, between Good and
Evil, between virgin and whore, between rich and poor, and be
tween man and animal (Harris 1975). In Sumerian poetry, she is
sometimes represented as a endowments of 'heroism, strength,
and justice' as well as of wisdom and patience, and finally, the arts

The lower part of this object has been lost. The warrior god is depicted wearing a high cylindrical headdress and equipped with two quivers. The goddess holds a bow and arrow in her left hand, while her right hand is raised in a gesture of greeting. Tied to her left wrist is a rope with the other end tied around the neck of an ibex. The work techniques were embossing and the use of a burin.

Rectangular votive plaque with a warrior goddess
Judging from the horned headdress and quiver she carries on her back, this is a female warrior goddess; at the top of this quiver there is a pomegranate, which recalls Assyrian prototypes. In fact, starting with the reign of Sargon II (721-705 B.C), one of the two sides of quivers had an extension crowned by an element very similar to a pomegranate. The deity, perhaps Ishtar/Shawushka, is holding a rectangular banner in her hands.

representation of Inanna/Ishtar. Finally, Ishtar was also an astral deity. The Semitic Ishtar is characterized more specifically as the goddess of love and war, and as an astral deity associated with the planet Venus. Together with Shamash, the sun-god, and Sîn, the moon-god, Ishtar formed an astral triad in support of justice and divination, to which the Storm god Adad,was also partially associated. As stated in a passage from the Old Babylonian text of the Prayer to the gods of the night:
« The gods and goddesses of the land - Shamash, Sîn, Adad, and Ishtar – have entered into the womb of the sky; they do not make judgments, do not render verdicts. The night is veiled.” » (Reiner 1985: 68; Cooley apud Lenzi 2011: 71-85)
Another aspect that has been linked to the goddess is her being on the threshold between life and death, deriving from her function of descending into the Netherworld and returning from it (as we know from the Sumerian poem, Inanna's Descent to the Netherworld and its counterpart in Akkadian). Thus, Ishtar, angry at the refusal of Gilgamesh to her amorous advances, threatens the god Anu that if he does not send the Bull of Heaven to destroy the hero,
« If thou openest not the gate to let me enter, I will break the door, I will wrench the lock, I will smash the door-posts, I will force the doors. I will bring up the dead to eat the living. And the dead will outnumber the living! » (Gilgamesh VI, 97-100; translation by Pettinato 1992: 174, and cf. George 2003: 695)
depicted while raising both hems of her skirt (cap. 101), revealing her nudity, thereby creating a curious image in which it looks like the deity is jumping rope. It is possible that this particular iconography is an intimation of the story of the descent of Inanna/Ishtar to the Netherworld for love of the shepherd Dumuzi, when the goddess took off the 'seven veils' she wore. According to the myth, Inanna/Ishtar passed through seven gates, and at each one, she was required to take off a garment or an ornament, so that by the seventh gate, she was completely naked. But Inanna/Ishtar was also a goddess of war: this aspect of hers seems to express itself above all in politically meaningful contexts, where the deity is praised in relation to royal power and military force, already by Naram-Sin of Akkad, who calls her 'the warlike Ishtar' and then much later by the kings of the Assyrian empire. It might be said that although the sexuality of the goddess is unquestionably feminine, her nature also shows ample masculine traits. Starting with the Old Babylonian period, the warrior aspect of Ishtar is especially emphasized in the iconography through the battle apparel that she wears, with quivers full of arrows hanging on her back (cap. 103, cap. 104), holding a mace with a double lion's head in her raised right hand (cap. 102) and a scimitar in her lowered left hand. The goddess is depicted frontally in an ascending posture, with a foot resting on the back of her animal-symbol (cap. 106), the lion, sometimes holding onto its leash, or onto a bird with a lion's head. This iconography survived with limited variations for more than a millennium in Mesopotamia and also in the surrounding regions (cap. 105). It is thus likely that the well-executed and imaginative terracotta plaque, of unknown archaeological context - acquired in 2004 by the British Museum - known as 'the Queen of the Night' is a

Fragment of a chariot model, of which only the parapet with the representation in relief of Ishtar in her warrior aspect has been preserved.
Isin/Larsa or Old Babylonian Terracotta 15 x 7.5 x 2 cm
The goddess holds a bow in her raised left hand and another weapon, perhaps a scimitar, in her lowered right hand, kept at her side; her feet are placed on her assigned animal, probably a lion, though it is poorly preserved. The face and torso of the goddess are in frontal view, while her legs are depicted in profile. The deity is wearing a high conical headdress and a long robe with vertical pleats cascading to her feet, held in place by a belt around her waist. Two 'stars of Ishtar' are engraved at the top of the parapet.
Chariot models represent one of the most common kinds of craft production in the Mesopotamian world from the late 3rd millennium until the end of the 2nd millennium BC. However, the greatest concentration of production was restricted to a period of time ranging, in terms of absolute chronology, from ca. 2112 to 1595 BC, i.e. the periods of the Ur III dynasty, of Isin/Larsa, and until the end of the Old Babylonian period.
With rare exceptions, the surface of the parapet bearing the embossed decoration (usually obtained by a mold) is the internal one. The outer face is often not even flattened.
These small models represented the two-wheeled chariots for which A. Salonen (Die Landfahrzeuge des Alten Mesopotamien, Annales Academiae Scientiarum Fennicae 72 (3), Helsinki 1951) reconstructed the Sumero-Akkadian terms of their various constituent parts. The two-wheeled chariot (narkabtu in Akkadian) was formed by a high parapet, i.e. a rigid part which extended at the front of the chariot. The double camber on the parapet-top (often perforated in two places to allow the passage of the reins) served as a reinforcement and as a handhold for the charioteer. The chariot body (= bit narkabti) of our exemplar has been lost.
A model closely comparable to this artifact was found at Kish (M.T. Barrelet, Figurines et reliefs en terre cuite de la Mesopotamie antique, Paris 1968, pl. 59 n. 623). In addition to presenting the same type of figure, it also shows a close stylistic kinship with the present one. Based on this comparison, this artifact can be dated to the Isin-Larsa period (ca. 2000-1800 BC).

tamian burials contain references to this liminal quality of Ishtar: from rosettes (or 8-pointed stars) to iconographic motifs including lions and lionesses in decorations with red carnelian (at times coupled with lapis lazuli, symbolizing Dumuzi). There are numerous allusions to these 'funerary' aspects of the goddess, from the Royal Tombs of Ur to the 'frit' glazed masks of the Mari period up to the Neo-Assyrian tombs of Ashur, and the decorations on the golden crowns in the tombs of the queens from Nimrud. Ishtar was associated with the cult in various cities and - in each one - seems to have taken on different personifications (or hypostases). In Sumerian literary texts, it is said that, for her mission to the Netherworld, she abandoned all her positions in the temples of several cities in the south of the country, from Uruk in Bad-tibira to Zabalam, in Adab, in Nippur, Kish, in Akkad, in Umma, in Ur, in Kissik, in Girsu/Lagash, in Isin, in Akshak, in Shuruppak, and in Kazallu; the goddess was also worshiped in Babylon (cap. 112). In the Neo-Assyrian period, we know of several local hypostases, such as 'the Assyrian Ishtar' (or: of the city of Assur)', the 'Lady of the Palace' (Belet-ekalli), the 'Queen of the Rising Star' (Sharrat-Nipha), 'Ishtar of Nineveh' and 'Ishtar of Arbela'. Of the latter two, the Nineveh figure had wide circulation (even reaching the Hittite and Hurrian worlds with the name of Shaushka), while the Ishtar of Arbela (today Erbil, in Kurdistan) was connected to the activity of a number of priestesses who, in her name, produced spontaneous utterances, prophetic in nature, much feared and heeded by kings such as Esarhaddon (680-668 BC). The goddess had a divine vizier (sukkal), of female but sometimes male sex, named Nin-shubur (Wiggermann 1998-2001), who could also act as an interceding deity for the faithful, and is also mentioned as such in the inscriptions of the seals from the first half of the 2nd millennium BC (cap. 109,cap. 115, cap. 116, cap. 80) and on mace heads (cap. 113).
In this context, it has been suggested (Barrett 2007) that the

deities of the storm and its accompanying phenomena (thunder, lightning, clouds, rain and wind) held a preeminent place in the local pantheons, or were even considered divine rulers, foremost among the gods, and bestowers of kingship on the human monarch. The most important Storm gods were the Semitic *Hadda (in Akkadian, Adad or Addu, in Western Semitic, Haddu or Hadad), the Syro-Palestinian god Ba'lu or Ba'al (cap. 107), the Hurrite Teshub (and the Urartian Teisheba) and lastly the Hittite /Luwian Tarhunt (Schwemer 2008). Apparently unrelated to any of these are the Sumerian god Enlil, his son Ninurta and lastly the head of the Babylonian pantheon Marduk, who show only partially the same characteristics, and who, moreover, express the world of irrigation that depended on storms only to a certain extent. On the other hand, considering the link between the ‘storm’ and rain-fed agriculture in areas where it was sufficiently abundant, it is unsurprising to notice that the Mesopotamian god Adad/Addu was also worshiped as the propagator of floral life. The Akkadian god Adad had, to be sure, a Sumerian ‘ancestor’, known as Ishkur, written with the logogram im = ‘wind, storm’, whose cult is known especially at Lagash and Adab in the Pre-Sargonic period and later in several other cities (Girsu, Umma, Nippur, and Uruk). In some traditions he is a further child of Enlil,

In between the two figures is a crescent moon. The other pair consists of an offering-bearer carrying a goat in her arms advancing towards a deity who is holding a stick with seven balls in his right hand. This is probably the god Shamash: at the end of the Old Babylonian period, in fact, the saw that had distinguished him in the previous phase was replaced by the stick with seven balls.

heaven and earth, my helper, deprive him of rainfall from the sky and of water from the springs of the earth! May he destroy his land (=of the violator) through famine and pestilence! May he thunder furiously over his city, and transform his land in a ruin left over from the Flood! » (Code of Hammurabi, Obverse, col. XXVII, ll. 64-80)
The abode of Adad is obviously ubiquitous. In the Epic of Gilgamesh he is said to reside on the high mountains in the forest of cedars where the monster Huwawa/Humbaba lived. Due to his obvious connections with the weather and the harvest, but also perhaps as god of the winds, Adad also became in time the god of divination, in association with Shamash; and this role spread also to Syria and Anatolia. In the Middle Euphrates city of Mari (18th cent. BC), Adad/Addu was the head of the pantheon, along with Dagan – the father of the gods in Syrian tradition and Itur-Mer, the local dynastic deity. The cult of the Storm god is attested all over Syria in the ‘Amorite’ period, along the Upper Euphrates (Tuttul, Terqa) as far as Qatna beyond the Syro-Arab desert, and later in the coastal cities, from the Hurrian city of Alalakh to Ugarit. The temple of Hadad at Aleppo was also held in great reverence. It has been excavated in recent decades, yielding a rich store of sculpture and epigraphs (Gonnella et al. 2005), from the 2nd millennium to the period of the Aramean states in the next millennium. In Anatolia, lastly, the Myth of Kumarbi indicates this deity (often confused with Dagan) as the father of Teshub, the Hittite Storm god. In Old Babylonian seals, the Storm god is depicted in various
sometimes the twin brother of Enki/Ea, responsible for the celestial waters. The cult of Adad/Addu is unusual in that it extended – like the Semitic languages themselves – throughout the Near East. The first documentation of the god’s name (as 'a-da) came from Ebla in northeastern Syria (23rd cent. BC), but it probably referred to a an even older deity from the Syro-Mesopotamian area. In Mesopotamia proper, the cult of Addu/Adad flourished in coincidence with the coming to power of the dynasties of Amorite origin in the early 2nd millennium BC. From the Old Babylonian period on, this figure was included among the ‘great gods’ whose cults extended throughout the land, from the south to the region of the Diyala River northeast of the Middle Euphrates and lastly to Assur on the Middle Tigris (where a temple to the god stood since the Old Assyrian period). Under Shamshi-Adad I (18th cent. BC) the original temple of Adad in this city was transformed into a dual sanctuary, dedicated to the Storm god but also to the king of the Heavens, Anu. The figure of Adad is an ambivalent one. On the one hand, he is the rain-god, who also controls the underground waters, ensuring fertile fields and the survival of the population; while on the other he can endanger the harvest with storms, flooding or their opposite, drought (Schwemer 2008). An epithet of the god calling him ‘Lord of lightning, the splendor that illuminates the universe’ clearly shows this ambivalence. Even better, it is clarified by a curse found in the final section of the Code of Hammurabi, addressed to any future sovereign who might violate the sense of the text:

Cylinder seal with offering to a deity and inscription
The god Shamash receives the offering of a goat from a figure that is in front of him, while the interceding goddess Lama watches the scene.
Old Babylonian Hematite 2.5 x 1.3 cm
The seal is slightly concave with the hole filled by a copper loop. Given the particular shape of the seal, we may assume that there were capsules in gold (or other precious metal) at the two ends, which were probably removed to be fused and to reuse the raw material.
The decoration presents, at the far right, an image of the sun god Shamash (cf. ch. 6b), standing and dressed in a long robe and wearing a typical divine headdress with horns. His foot is placed on a stylized mountain and he is easily identifiable thanks to one of his most frequent attributes, a knife with a serrated blade brandished in his lowered right hand, with which - according to myth – he cut his way through the mountains in order for the sun to rise at dawn. The god is receiving the offer of a goat - probably destined for sacrifice - from a figure that is standing directly in front of him, with the characteristic round cap with upturned brim and a foot-length ceremonial robe. Behind him is the goddess to whom he is praying, Lama, in her classic iconography with both hands raised to chin height.
Three lines of cuneiform script inform us of the name and the function of the owner of the seal. There is also mention of a minor deity, Nin-shubur, vizier of the goddess Ishtar, who could also act as a god by interceding for the faithful.

« Great wild bull of the sacred heavens, young Utu, stable as a torch, who offers his own gaze, the sunlight of the earth » (Shulgi Q, l. 7)
But since the sun is a star that moves through the sky all day long, lighting up the earth without a pause, the deity that represents it can see everything that happens; and this link between astral function and observation of human behaviour led Shamash to become the protector of the voyager by land and by sea. The same link between illumination and observation is the key to understanding the role of Shamash in exercising justice, often acting in common with Adad, but more often as the unrivalled god of the sector. This essential role of Shamash, as the benevolent god of justice – sometimes in conjunction with other astral gods, such as the Moon and Venus – began to emerge forcefully from the Old Babylonian period on; and as such it is the Sun god who is celebrated in the prologue of the Code of Hammurabi. It is through his close association with Shamash that the King of Babylonia conducts his task of establishing justice through a set of basic rules governing the private and public spheres of law. And it is expressly the image of this god – with the characteristic rays of light emanating from his shoulders – that stands before the reverent sovereign in bas-relief in the upper part of the tall stele in polished black diorite that bears the text of the Code. The stele was found by French archaeologists at Susa in1902,
ways, which undoubtedly refer to two different traditional conventions. One of these is based on the tradition on the Akkadian period, when the Storm god’s symbolic animal was a hybrid creature, a lion-griffin or – according to other scholars – a leonine winged dragon. In the other tradition, that of the western populations of Anatolia and Syria, which emerged strongly in the second millennium BC, the god was represented, with few exceptions, standing on a bull. Here he appears with a hairdo falling to his back in a long curl, a horned tiara with a point or knob at the top, and a short skirt. A dagger hangs from his belt and he brandishes a mace, while holding a whip and the reins of the bull. Another of the storm god’s most characteristic attributes was the stylized lightning bolt held in his hand (cap. 10). Shamash. This deity, known in Sumerian as Utu, represented the bright light of the sun, which returns each day to shine on the Mesopotamian plain and illuminates human activities. As such, Shamash is the chief figure of a celestial triad including the Moon god Sîn and the star Venus (Inanna/Ishtar), sometimes joined by the Storm god Adad. But a further characteristic of this figure, closely linked to its daily appearance above the Zagros mountains, was that of determining destinies, which led to a specific function in the practice of divination (see below). His most frequent images in Sumerian literature are those of a ‘wild bull’, a ‘bison’ or a ‘young hero’, as in a hymn of Shulgi addressed to the god:

but had been brought to the capital of Elam in the 12th cent. BC as the spoils of war from the Mesopotamian city of Sippar, site of the god’s greatest temple, Ebabbar. As the god of justice, Shamash enjoyed great prestige for the entire duration of Mesopotamian civilisation. Lastly, Shamash was one of the chief patrons of divination, and especially of extispicy. Here too, some of the functions pertaining to this role were shared with other deities, notably the storm god Adad, especially in the Old Babylonian period (Charpin 2013). Nonetheless, in the Neo-Assyrian period, it was to Shamash that the rulers of the empire turned. It was Shamash who, through the ‘manual of extispicy’, helped to count the auspicious and inauspicious features to be found in the entrails of the sacrificed goat or sheep, expressing in the end a lapidary judgment: either positive or negative (Starr 1990). In the seals of the Akkadian period, Shamash is the deity most frequently depicted. The god is often shown in the act of rising from the eastern mountains (cap. 127) – as in the Sumerian and Akkadian poetic texts, where he is compared to mountain animals – while two attendants open the gates of the heavens. Alternatively, Shamash is depicted seated (cap. 111) or standing, his foot resting on a stylized mountain (cap. 115, cap. 116) or on a recumbent bull, while he receives a worshiper wearing a round beret with a turned-up brim and a long gown open in the front, revealing his nude leg. The worshiper is holding an animal in his

Contest scene between animals and heroes. A bull-man faces a lion, while two naked heroes face two animals with human faces and bull bodies (some scholars believe these are stylized depictions of bisons, whose frontal view of the head is always presented as a human face, because it was more familiar to the engraver than the animal's muzzle), which are arranged symmetrically. The naturalistic rendering of the human body and of the animal body and the explicit search for symmetry and balance in the representation are characteristic of the glyptics in the Akkadian period.

2013). A simple half-moon would have indicated the new moon, that is, the beginning of the month. In cases where the crescent moon was associated with the solar disk (the astral symbol of the sun-god Utu/Shamash) it would have indicated the only time when the two heavenly bodies were visible in the sky together, i.e., the days of full moon, around the fifteenth day of the month, when the moon rises fully in the east while the sun is setting in the west. To these two lunar phases were associated specific festivities, most notably the esh-esh festival, which was celebrated on the first and the fifteenth day of the month, in coincidence with these two important astral events that occurred each month and that regulated the life of the community. Another symbol of the god, frequently found in the Old Babylonian period, was the bull, due to the resemblance between its horns and the crescent moon. Enki (in Akkadian and in Babylonian mythology Ea) was the god of freshwater, of underground waters (abzu, in Akkadian apsû, from which our term ‘abyss’ seems to derive, through Greek) and of wisdom. He was the son of the god Anu and the brother of Ish
kur/Adad. The god’s main cult centre was the E-abzu in the city of Eridu, near the Persian Gulf. His act of providing freshwater made him a benevolent god in the eyes of Mesopotamian man. Accordingly, his role in the mythological texts – from the epic of
arms, which he offers to the god, and is followed by the interceding goddess Lama. The identification of this god with Shamash is also aided by the rays of light that at times shine from his shoulders, representing the warmth of the sun (as in the Code of Hammurabi). Starting from the Ur III period, Shamash is symbolized by the solar disk and later, under Syrian influence, he is represented by a winged disk. To the god in his symbology of winged sun, mythological creatures of half-human, half-animal appearance were at times associated, placed at the gates of the most important public buildings, to symbolise the entrance and departure of the sun in its daily journey.
The Moon god. The two main cult centres of the Moon god Nanna (in Akkadian, Suen, then Sîn) were located in geographically opposed cities along the axis of the Euphrates: at Ur, in the lower Mesopotamian alluvial plain, which was the site of his first temple, Ekishnugal (cap. 12) and at Harran on the Balikh tributary in northern Mesopotamia. Nanna was the son of Enlil and of his consort Ninlil; his wife was the goddess Ningal (later pronounced Nikkal) and their children were the sun god Utu and Inanna, while at a later period their son, the god Nusku, was the god of fire. The importance of this deity in the Sumerian period is clearly shown in the text The Journey of Nanna/Suen to Nippur, where the Moon brings abundant offerings of first fruits to Enlil, head of the pantheon, receiving gifts in return from him. In the 1st millennium BC instead, the triad Sin-Nikkal-Nusku enjoyed vast prestige with the Aramaic populations in the area around Harran. The temple of Sin at Harran took up a renewed prominence in the post-Assyrian period thanks to the special devotion for the lunar cult of the last Neo-Babylonian king, Nabonidus (556-539 BC), whose mother Adda-guppi was a a priestess and whose daughter became the chief priestess of the sanctuary. The puzzling stay of seven years by Nabonidus far from his throne at the oasis of Teima' in northern Arabia, could, among other things, have been motivated by religious reasons, considering the importance of the Moon cult among the pre-Islamic Arabs, as demonstrated by the lunar emblems found in recent excavations conducted at Teima'. Surprisingly, the representations of this deity in Mesopotamian art are scarce, although the symbol of the lunar crescent, a halfmoon with the bulge turned downward – a standardized representation of the moon that may have replicated its real shape at the latitude of the land of Sumer – appears on innumerable seals from the Akkadian period onward. During the Ur III period, the crescent moon begins to be omnipresent in scenes of intercession. Some scholars have associated this new motif with the widespread dissemination of the lunar calendar at that time. In addition to its value as the astral symbol of the god Nanna/ Suen, the image of the crescent moon could also indicate precisely when the intercession depicted on the seal took place, i.e., on one of the two most favorable days of the month (Pizzimenti

ated with the hybrid animal sukhurmashu, having the head and forelegs of a goat and the body of a fish. This symbol was to pass down to the Hellenistic and Roman age as Capricorn, still present in our zodiac (Black-Green 1992: 93). Enki/Ea appears frequently in mythological scenes in the art of the Akkadian period, but unlike Shamash – more rarely in later times. He can be easily identified in seals by streams of water, represented by parallel wavy lines, flowing from his shoulders or adorning his throne. In other art forms as well, Enki/Ea is recognisable thanks to the presence of water, as in the case of the plaque decorated in relief (cap. 122) from the Urartian period (middle of the 7th cent. BC) depicting a divinity standing on a ram, the animal symbol of Ea. His association with freshwater links him to fish as well; whether by chance or not, vast amounts of fish remains were found on level VI (from the end of the Early Ubaid period) of the temple of Eridu, associated with this god (Lambert in Finkel-Geller 1997:5).
Personal and interceding deities
In the vast, complex relationships between man and the gods in ancient Mesopotamia, a special role was played by the ‘personal deity’. This was a god or goddess perceived as especially close to the worshiper, guiding his interests and his fate and ready to answer the prayers offered to him/her in private cult. Hence this deity was not a part of the public, official polytheistic religion, but played an indispensable role in the special, unique (henotheistic) relationship with his/her protégé (cap. 114). This is clearly shown by the texts that refer to ‘my god’ or ‘his god’, and the positive experience of ‘acquiring a god’, that is, the piety specifically felt by the worshiper, prepared for divine wrath in case of sin or on the
Atra-hasis to the Poem of Gilgamesh – is that of concretely aiding mankind in its escape from the Flood, also by recurring to expedients for eluding the strict precepts established by the pantheon as a whole. In other Sumerian literary works (Inanna and Enki, Enki and World Order) the deity serves the function of organiser and regulator of human life in its manifold aspects. For this role of his, Enki/Ea formed part, along with Anu and Enlil, of the divine triad that gave a name to the celestial ‘paths’, three vertical bands into which the astrologers (from 1000 BC on) divided the sky, for the purpose of placing the planets and stars within 18 zodiacal constellations, precisely identified (and observed in their motion, over the course of 12 months lasting 30 days each). A Neo-Assyrian astrological tablet describes the journey of the Sun over the various ‘paths’ through the seasons:
« From the 1st of Addaru/XII [= approx. February 15] to the 30th of Ayyaru/II [= approx. May 15], the Sun marches on the path of Anu: breezes and mild temperature. From the 1st of Simanu/III [= approx. May 15] to the 30th of Abu/V [= approx. August 15], the Sun marches over the path of Enlil: harvesting and heat. From the 1st of Ululu/VI [= approx. August 15] to the 30th of Arahsamnu/VIII [= approx. November 15], the Sun marches over the path of Anu: breezes and mild temperature. From the 1st of Kislimu/IX [= approx. November 15] to the 30th of Shabatu/XI [= approx. February 15], the Sun marches in the path of Ea: cold weather. » (Fales 2001:253)

« My ill luck has increased, and I do not find the right. I called to my god, but he did no;t show his face, I prayed to my goddess, but she did not raise her head » (Lambert 1960: Ludlul, II, 3-5)
The role of mediation or intercession with the great gods is especially clear in the iconography of cylinder seals from the Third Dynasty of Ur (21st cent. BC), which frequently show audience scenes. At the centre of the scene we find an Assyrian deity seated on a throne, dressed in a tufted woollen gown and wearing a multi-layered horned tiara, who thus constitutes the focal point of the representation and can sometimes be identified by his attributes (for example, sacred weapons or flowing streams of
contrary expecting compassion and pardon after having repented. As has been noted, this personal piety should be seen within the context of a family- and (small) community-based religion. The attitude of the worshiper to his own god resembles that of an infant to its parents. It is a relationship of the primordial type, practically indissoluble and based on faith in the divine elements throughout the different stages of life of the individual and his household. It is hard to know, however, whether the personal deity was more helpful with physical problems (perhaps also in the important sphere of reproduction) or with psychological matters and adaptation (as a sort of ‘guardian angel’). It may be no coincidence that the state of misfortune on all fronts described in the Babylonian poem of the ‘Righteous Sufferer’ also contemplates temporary abandonment of the unlucky man by his personal deity:

placed as guardians at the doors of temples and palaces. The best-known case of these hybrid beings is that of the alamdimmu (in modern times often called lamassu, which are however another thing), the winged bulls (but also lions) with bearded human heads that served – in sculptures in the round up to 4 metres' height – as custodians at the entrance to Assyrian royal palaces. They were then replicated in the monumental iconography of the Achaemenid period. We know them from the palaces of Ashurnasirpal II (883-859 BC) down to the time of Esarhaddon (680-668 BC). From the Assyrian bas-reliefs themselves we also learn that the colossal statues of the alamdimmu were sculpted directly on the walls of the limestone quarries on the upper Tigris and were patiently drawn by squads of workers on sleds pulled by ropes, then transferred to sturdy rafts and floated directly downstream to the capitals of the empire, where they were set up in pairs at the entrances to the palace. (Fales 2001). As protection for the entrances of public buildings, also as accompaniment to the alamdimmu at the gates of Assyrian palaces (such as that of Khorsabad, erected by Sargon II in the late 8th cent. BC), stood the figure of the so-called ‘lord of animals’, which comes from a much more ancient tradition, especially common in Mesopotamian seals. This figure was depicted in various ways, although the best-known type is undoubtedly that of the nude man, bearded and wearing an elaborate coiffure stylized in elegant symmetrical curls (usually three per side). His body is depicted in profile, while the face appears in frontal view (cap. 121). This typology – typical of the Akkadian period – seems to derive from a more archaic one (exactly from Early Dynastic II), where the figure has a beardless face shown in profile, with the hair standing up on his head but curving backward at the ends to form a sort of eyelet (cap. 123). This character was commonly called a ‘hero’, a conventional term for a figure whose real identity remains uncertain. Numerous attempts – often frustrated – have been made to identify the figure of the ‘lord of the animals’, based on Sumerian and Akkadian literature, which however provides no detailed physical descriptions of the protagonists of mythology and epical texts. In the past, and in popular literature, he has often been identified with the epic hero Gilgamesh, although with an obvious lack of any concrete match between literary texts and images. And in fact, it is not sure whether the iconography of the nude, bearded hero refers exclusively to a specific personality; hence it is quite useless to attempt to establish a precise, univocal identity for this figure. It should have rather represented a figurative convention that referred, on different occasions, to different figures appearing in mythology and epos, probably of semi-divine rank. Highly interesting among these – considering the obvious connection in numerous seals between the nude hero and the god Enki/Ea – is a group of deities, the Lahmu, who were responsible for watching over Apsu (Abzu), the residence of the freshwater
water in the case of the god Ea), by the heavenly bodies represented, by his symbolic animal or by the shape of his chair (which at times shows a structure symbolizing the facade of a temple). An advancing figure, who represents a worshiper or a priest dressed in a simple fringed gown, draped over one shoulder, his arm bent at the elbow, his hand extended at shoulder level approaches the divinity, led by the hand by another figure who precedes him. This is the interceding female deity, often identified with the protective figure of the goddess Lama or Lamma/ lamassu (Spycket 1980-1983), who is usually dressed in divine robes less luxurious than those of the main god, except in special cases (the garments of a priestess or other figure). The iconography of the intercession scene changed in the Isin-Larsa period (ca. 2000-1800 BC), with the worshiper facing the greater god, behind whom stands his personal deity, often shown with arms raised at face height in the attitude of supplication. In the Old Babylonian period, audience scenes with the god seated on a throne or the king seated on a stool were gradually replaced by much simpler scenes with fewer figures, shown in standing position. The two main characters were the ruler and the supplicating goddess, who were at times the only figures in the scene (cap. 117, cap. 118). In further variations, within an overall vast range of seal production, the goddess appears in central position between the worshiper and the main deity (cap. 119).
In another significant variation of the scene, the main figure does not wear a tufted gown but a fringed one, it remains seated on a stool or chair and most important, does not wear the horned tiara but a round cap, known also from the statuary of the period. This figure can be identified as a ruler (cap. 120), also due to the frequent presence of the bearded face. It is still open to question, however, whether or not this image represents a king subjected to divinization, following a tendency attested in this period, which entailed a cult of statues portraying the rulers and the building of temples in their name. The interceding goddess disappears more or less entirely from Mesopotamian iconography after the Old Babylonian dynasty. The examples, very rare in the Kassite period, terminate in the 9th cent. BC with a tablet in bas-relief for Shamash, in which the Babylonian king Nabû-apal-iddina is led before the god by the city’s highest priest, with the goddess Aya in the role of interceding deity. However, this motif was to remain in use in the bordering countries, from Cappadocia to Mittani to Syria and Ugarit, throughout the 2nd millennium BC.

defense of domestic animals is the bull-man (or bison-man), also erroneously identified in the past with Enkidu, Gilgamesh’s companion in adventure. In the bison-man, the lower part of the body (cleft hooves and tail) is taurine, while the head (with bovine ears, although wearing horns) and the torso are clearly human; the erect position also is typical of man (cap. 124). This creature appears throughout the span of Mesopotamian history and also in neighboring civilizations (at Tell Halaf/Guzana, in Syria, in the 1st millennium BC). The Sumerian name of the bison-man, gud. dum.dutu (in Akkadian kusarikku), seems to identify him as the offspring of the sun god Shamash/Utu; in Akkadian texts, the kusarikku were the seven guardians of his home. In later periods the bison-man became increasingly identifiable as the custodian of gates, at the entrances and exits of public places in relation to the time of day, that is, to the motion of the Sun god. In the Neo-Assyrian period, it is frequently portrayed holding up the winged solar disk. From the texts and iconography of this period, we know that,
deity. The root lh ̆m can be translated as ‘thick-haired’ and this
term undoubtedly recalls the flowing hair that is the most obvious characteristic of the nude hero in Mesopotamian glyptic art. At times the hero appearing on the seals might be identified with a ruler, thanks to an exchange that recurs often in the culture of the Land of the Twin Rivers. Beginning with the Middle Assyrian period, the hero is usually winged and is often to be seen as one of the so-called genies, perhaps images or symbolic evocations of the legendary Seven Sages who lived before the Flood, known as apkallu (Black – Green 1994: 163-164; Green in Finkel-Geller 1997: 140). The series of genies, highly developed in the Neo-Assyrian period, included figures of hybrid nature (such as the demon-griffin, by some seen as a vulture) but more often anthropomorphic, such as male figures wearing a horned tiara, either standing or kneeling, carrying a bucket and a ‘pinecone'- sprinkler (in Akkadian mullilu) with a magical-apotropaic function, which may have been related to a stylized tree of life (cap. 129). The contests between heroes and animals are of basically symbolic nature. This representation emphasizes the superiority of man – the emblem of order and civilisation – over the chaotic animal and floral realm, a superiority acquired thanks to the favor shown by the gods to mankind. In other words, what is defined is the dominion of man (represented by the nude hero) over the animal world. Mankind, by utilizing animal resources, is able to draw from them the wealth that allows it to establish an organized civilization, subordinated to the cult and to the gods. Hence scenes of this kind have, from the very beginning, subtle religious meanings (cap. 55). The hero’s chief ally in his struggles with wild beasts and his

archers (sometimes winged cherubim, sometimes centaurs) shooting their arrows at hybrid creatures (griffins, lion-dragons, snakelike monsters, or winged creatures with a human head and a scorpion’s body, the so-called girtablullû). In the Sumerian
poem Lugal-e, the Asag (Akkadian asakku) is a monstrous demon that is defeated by the god Ninurta/Ningirsu (in another version, by Adad/Ishkur). Asag was born from the coupling of An and Ki (heaven and earth), and Asag himself mated with kur (the mountains) to produce offspring. He was accompanied by an army of allies made of stone (the stones of the mountains). The defeat of Asag/asakku by Ninurta might be represented on the reliefs erected in the 9th century BC by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II on both sides of the main entrance to the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu (today Nimrud). Here a god (Ninurta or Adad) holding stylized lightening bolts is attacking a leonine bird, perhaps Anzû or Asakku. A correlated scene is found on seals of the Neo-Assyrian period, where Ninurta – portrayed as an archer – shoots his arrows at the demon (cap. 125).
Divination and the sense of man’s future
The divination of omens consists of a group of techniques for observing terrestrial and celestial phenomena (mainly of casual or exceptional nature) and interpreting their reflexes on the future of human events. Interpretation is based on systems for inferring a consequence from a specific cause, formulated in hypothetical terms (if this phenomenon occurs, then the consequences are the following), in a positive or negative key. Divination is attested in Mesopotamia since the 3rd millennium BC From here it migrated to the neighboring regions (Elam, Syria, Anatolia), developing in various ways, and continued up to the last examples of literature in cuneiform script, at the dawn of the Christian era (Fales 2001: 244). The world of techniques developed over this long period is remarkably rich. Various forms of deductive divination, deriving from
among the hybrid creatures playing a role in the mythology linked to the god Shamash, only three of them held up the winged disk: the bison-man, the fish-man and the scorpion-man. The fish-man has human form in the upper part, with a bearded head, and a body with the scales and tail of a fish; the tail was sometimes curved as a symbol of swimming. The scorpion-man has the feet and legs (and sometimes) the wings of a bird, but the rest of its body is that of a scorpion with uplifted tail, ready to sting; here too the head is human and bearded. The Epic of Gilgamesh (Pl. 9: II, 1-9) narrates the arrival of the heroes at the mountain Mashu, “which daily protects the exit of Shamash”, with scorpion-men “whose aura is frightful, whose gaze is death itself”, which protect the sun god “from dawn to dusk”. Giants are only rarely depicted on seals. This is probably due to the fact that it is extremely difficult to render the idea of an enormous body size on such a small artifact and, at the same time, to create a well-balanced composition. When they are represented on seals, the expedient used is that of portraying them crosswise, or horizontally (cap. 70). In most forms of religion, various types of supernatural beings exist, on a level midway between gods and men. The term 'demon', in its original Greek meaning (daimōn 'supernatural being', 'spirit') is an approximative translation of the Akkadian term rābis.u (Sumerian maškim), which can refer to either a good or an evil demon. Demons appear only rarely in Mesopotamian mythology. In general, the ‘evil’ demons seem to have been conceived as simple executors of the will of the gods. Their role was that of implementing a punishment ordained by the gods for some sin that had been committed. The customary method of attacking mankind consisted of inflicting diseases, as in the case of the Lamashtu-demon (cap. 130). Demons were not often portrayed, perhaps in the belief that their images could endanger someone. Demons and monsters, in fact, combine both human and animal features, usually blending the most frightful or potent elements of different creatures. More frequently, however, a human head, which represents intelligence, is superimposed on an animal’s body. The bull-man is the best-known example of this type and – as we have seen – it was the ally of the (human) hero in contest scenes. Bird-men are rare, except during the Akkadian period, but wings are often added to men and animals. Parts of various animals are then combined to create entirely hybrid figures, or Mischwesen. The most ancient combination of this type is the lion-headed eagle Imdugud (Anzû in Akkadian), which appears on the seals of the Early Dynastic period (cap. 72). Combinations of birds, lions and reptiles have produced various kinds of dragons, which became the symbolic animals of various deities, the most famous of them being the mushkhushshu of the god Marduk. On the seals of the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian period, mythological hunting scenes (cap. 125) are very frequent, with

astrologists grouped for “vigils” of the sky, or from the elaborate apotropaic rituals that protected the sleep of kings and the fate of peoples, common man must have also perceived the numinous nature of the stars with their influence on mankind (cap. 128) or – in other geographical or linguistic horizons – must have attempted to ward off evil with amulets (cap. 131) or good-luck charms hung over doors or elsewhere (cap. 132). It is most likely, then, that even among the general population, the beliefs enunciated in the erudite Babylonian “Diviner’s Manual” from the 7th cent. BC were widespread:
« The signs on earth, like the signs in the sky, give us signals. [...] The sky and the earth also produce portents; even if they appear separately, they are not separate (since) the sky and the earth are related. The sign, which is negative in the sky, is negative on earth as well; the sign that is negative on earth is equally negative in the sky. » (Fales 2001: 245)
observation of the real world, included astrology, ornithomancy, teratology and physiognomy. Other methods, based on the examination of offerings or sacrificial materials, included hepatoscopy or extispicy, palmomancy, lecanomancy (drops of oil poured into water), libanomancy (incense smoke) and aleuromancy (forms assumed by flour when poured out). Lastly, in the 1st millennium BC we find a smaller series of divinely inspired expressions, either verbal or not (interpretation of dreams, and prophetic enunciations, such as those of the priestesses of Ishtar at Arbail). Divination was thus an activity applied to the whole universe of society and intellectually esteemed in every period of Mesopotamian history, to judge by the many collections of omens that have come down to us. Its utilisation as a tool of prediction in the public sphere, up to the highest official levels, appears unique in the ancient world as a whole. This ensemble of techniques was thus destined to leave conspicuous traces in memory and in the collective imagination of other ancient civilisations (the world of the Bible, the Greco-Roman world) as a characteristic peculiar to the Babylonian cultural horizon. Alongside this ‘scientific’ horizon, which rotated around groups of sages assembled at the courts of Babylonia and Assyria (scribes and scholars of traditional lists of predictions; astrologers, haruspices, exorcists, physicians, etc.), the practice of divination also exerted an influence on common man in Mesopotamia and its neighboring regions.

Fragment of an amulet with Akkadian cuneiform inscription (a spell) on one surface; and on the other, a scene in bas relief representing the female demon Lamashtu.
Neo-Assyrian Steatite 3.7 x 2.8 x 1.5 cm
The fragment bears on the Obverse 6 lines of Akkadian cuneiform script, partially preserved (approx. two-thirds). The Reverse is devoid of any inscription but is covered with a scene in bas-relief, also partially preserved: visible is the lower part of the body of a standing anthropomorphic figure standing whose feet (of theriomorphic type) are resting on the back of a crouching donkey. From above the scene a small mammal and a serpent seem to “hang down”- but they are actually supported by the figure or attached to it. The scene presents a remarkable attention to detail, especially as regards the donkey's head.
The text, divided by horizontal rulings after each line, is the final part of a well-attested incantation to be found in Babylonian literature against the demonic figure Lamashtu. The visible signs are part of ll. 3-8 of the standard inscription on these texts (for a total of eight lines), of which a full translation is here provided:
“Incantation: he who has exceeded the length of my bed, who frightened me, who made me quake on the ground, who has related frightening dreams, may he be delivered to Nedu, the great gate-guard of the earth; by the order of the god Ninurta, the eldest son, the beloved offspring, by the order of the god Marduk, who dwells in the temple Esagila and in Babylon. O door and latch, know that I am protected by the divine order of my lords. Spell.”
Both the iconography and the text on our piece allow us to be reconstructed entirely, on the basis of many existing parallels. The standing figure is that of the female demon Lamashtu, which had a lioness' head, a human body, and an eagle's feet, which are placed on the donkey instructed to lead her into the desert; the animal in turn is crouching in the boat that leads to the underworld. Both the serpent and the small mammal are duplicated on the left side of the figure: the reptiles squirm in the demon's fists, while the two mammals bite the demon's hip. The scene could be on a large scale, with the addition of upper registers concerning a sick man cured by exorcists, and processions of demons with beasts' heads, such as in the exemplar Louvre AO 22205, lacking any inscription.

The kings and their deeds






that were the exclusive prerogative of the king, as well as the ritual functions which he was also called upon to enact for the welfare of his kingdom. In essence, the king had innately the unique ability to be able to 'dialogue', at all times and under all circumstances, with the gods and with men at the same time. That said, in the ancient Near East the king was, and remained, a man - the foremost and most remarkable of men, of course, but still a representative of mankind. It may suffice to recall the central notion of the Poem of Gilgamesh, concerning the desperate and unsuccessful search for immortality by the protagonist, the almighty king of Uruk with a semi-divine nature by birth, to obtain a sense of the insurmountable limit between man and God that deeply resonated in Mesopotamian culture. Unlike Egypt, where there was a very close relationship between the Pharaoh and the organization of Maat - the principle of cosmic order - and therefore the deified kingship was “the locus of convergence between anthropological and cosmic spheres” (Assmann 2016), Mesopotamia and the regions adjacent to it did not conceive of the divinization of the king before the reign of Naram-Sin of Akkad (ca. 2200 BC) and only occasionally later on.
« Because he had ensured the foundations of his city (Agade) against danger, (the citizens) invoked Ishtar in Eanna (= Uruk), Enlil in Nippur, Dagan in Tuttul, Nikhursag in Kish, Ea in Eridu, Sin in Ur, Shamash in Sippar, and Nergal in Kutha, so that he (= Naram-Sin) would be made god of their city, and then they built a temple to him within the city of Agade » (Frayne 1993: pp. 113-114, n. 10, ll. 20-57)
None of the later kings of Akkad was divinized. However, the tradition was revived by King Shulgi of the Ur III dynasty, perhaps as a move to limit the (ideological) damage caused by the death of his father Ur-Namma in battle (cap. 133, cap 134), which could have indicated the displeasure of the great gods. As in the preceding period, divinization had a largely political significance: it identified the ruler with the core values of the surrounding society, for example, through the erection of the statue of the king beside those of the gods in the major sanctuaries and with the creation of temple farms in the name of the deified king. Finally, hymns to the divinized king became part of the school curriculum as a celebration and propaganda tool (Michalowski 1987). As mentioned, if we assume that Sumerian civilization, from the Late Uruk period forward, worked on three social levels (authorities in power – high officials - common people), the divinization of kings was another way to establish royalty as fourth dimension, which was superior to all the local particularities, external or internal (Winter 1987). The tradition of divinizing kings continued with the successors of Shulgi (cap. 29) in the dynasties of Isin and Larsa (20th - 19th centuries BC); moreover, kings – such as Lipit-Ishtar of Isin - were revered
The kings and their deeds
Frederick Mario Fales
« The well-known proverb says: “Man is the shadow of God”; but man is (just) the shadow of man (himself): (Only) the king is the perfect image of God » (From an Assyrian letter, ca. 670 BC; Fales 2001.42)
As is well known, kingship - the dominion of a single individual (and his supporters) over people by virtue of a claimed (but generally accepted) superiority or uniqueness sanctioned by divine or natural forces - is probably one of the most enduring institutional forms of human history. As is well known, it has left traces in archaeological and artistic data, in textual expressions, and in the ethno-anthropological traditions of a great variety of cultures across time and space. In Mesopotamia, the political power of the absolute type had its base and application beginning with the formation of the city and the state, albeit initially with uncertainties and fluctuations between diverse terms and/or powers. Thus, for a large part of the 3rd millennium, the Sumerian titlles en, ensi and lugal were alternated with diverse meanings and hierarchies in the southern city-states (and even in polities as distant as Ebla in Syria), while it appears that no ambiguity ever surrounded the Semitic term sharrum, already present in the proper name of Sargon of Akkad, and from then on, for over two thousand years, translatable as king'. The numerous written sources of information on the kings are invaluably complemented by a visual culture of various types. Thus, the iconographic representations of the Mesopotamian kings in bas-reliefs and sculptures in the round, in the (unfortunately scarcely preserved) wall paintings, and in various branches of the minor arts, contribute to our understanding of the assessment and representation that the rulers of the ancient Near East conveyed of themselves in their physical features and their attributes (tiaras, crowns, robes, ornaments). The sense of the impressive power of a Mesopotamian king can then be obtained, although less directly, through the major building projects that have come down to us, such as palace and temple complexes, works of fortification or of hydraulic engineering, up to the foundation of entire cities. The importance of the person of the king is also made explicit in all of these sources of information (and often in a combination of written and archaeological data) by virtue of the efforts of the king himself to preserve his actions and fame for posterity. So, beyond the data, which was not always continuous over time and sometimes very fragmentary, it is certainly possible to draw a multi-faceted picture of royal power in different periods and regions in the history of the ancient Near East, from the early Sumerians to the last transformations of Babylonia under the Persians and Seleucids. A dual relationship with the king at the center can frequently be observed, even in very different chronological contexts of Mesopotamian history: on one hand, between the kings and the gods and on the other– symmetrically – between the king and humanity. Placed on the axis of this dual relationship are the actual political powers

But beyond this aspects, the list unequivocally indicates that only one city at a time was to be endowed with kingship, with a dynastic succession 'by turns' that denies and contradicts the actual existence in parallel of several royal locations, and of dynasties simultaneously in power in southern Mesopotamia in the 3rd millennium BC, as evidenced by all the other contemporary sources. What could have been the reason be for this particular historical view? Noting that the text ends with the kings of Isin - whose ruling line was founded by Ishbi-Erra through secession from the Ur III dynasty, which fell in 2004 BC – it has been claimed that these kings thus wanted to justify their full historical legitimacy: after that of Ur, it would have been the turn of kingship of Isin (Michalowski 1983). Also shorter and more succinct king lists (cap. 137) shed light on the full and direct continuity between the kings of Ur III and those of Isin; and the literary text of the Lamentation on the fall of Sumer and Ur (in Sumerian language, but from the Old Babylonian period) clarifies the reasons for the 'turn-taking system', in the words of the god Enlil:
« “Ur was given the kingship, but it was not given an everlasting kingdom. From ancient days, when the earth was founded, until now when people have multiplied, who has (ever) seen a kingdom reign forever?”»
Thus, even with its many mythological-literary aspects, the 'Sumerian King List' is an interesting indicator of Mesopotamian mentality regarding the descent of royalty from the sphere of the divine. Even more, the text points out the central role of the royal institution in the history of humanity, marked by a very distant past, and - except for the hiatus represented by the legendary Flood - by a linear and continuous flow of time, coinciding with the sum of the various kings' regnal years. In conclusion, one can still agree with the basic idea expressed by the archaeologist Henri Frankfort: “The ancient Near East considered kingship as the very foundation of civilization” (Frankfort 1948, 3).
Ideals of kingship
Sargon and Naram-Sin of Akkad (2350- 2250 BC). Sargon of Akkad, and then his grandson Naram-Sin, brought about an innovative conception of kingship compared to that of the rulers who had preceded them in southern Mesopotamia. Written and figurative monuments in celebration of the dynasty were placed in the major temples; furthermore, royal laboratories made multiple copies of them to be sent to various centers in the country.
« Sargon, king of Agade, conquered the city of Uruk, and was victorious in battle. Further, he personally captured 50 governors and the king (of Uruk). As for the one who will remove this inscription, may the gods Enlil and Shamash tear out his foundations and destroy his progeny » (Frayne 1993, p. 21 n. 7)
« Naram-Sin the mighty, king of Agade: when the four quarters of the world revolted against him, through the love which the goddess Ishtar showed him, he was victorious in nine battles in one year, and those kings that they ( = the rebels) had raised against him, he captured » (Frayne 1993, p. 113, n. 10, ll. 1-12)
In both the texts and the official iconography which has come down to us, the two major kings of Akkad describe themselves as leaders at the
as the siblings or children of the great gods, and often, as lovers or husbands of the goddess Inanna/Ishtar.
Kingship as an institution: the sense of the past and the flow of time
Mesopotamian kingship was conceived as a civilizing institution, that men had obtained from the gods. This is clearly explained by the so-called 'Sumerian King List', which in fact is a mixed composition, part literary text and part actual list, which relates the history of the kingship in Mesopotamia from its beginnings up to the early centuries of the 2nd millennium BC (Jacobsen 1939; Michalowski 1983; Marchesi 2010). Below is the beginning and some salient passages:
« After the kingship descended from heaven, the kingship was in Eridug. In Eridug, Alulim became king; he ruled for 28,800 years. Alaljar ruled for 36,000 years. 2 kings; they ruled for 64,800 years. Then Eridug fell and the kingship was taken to Bad-tibira. In Bad-tibira, En-menlu-ana ruled for 43,200 years. En-men-gal-ana ruled for 28,800 years. Dumuzid, the shepherd, ruled for 36,000 years. 3 kings; they ruled for 108,000 years .... (Total,) in 5 cities 8 kings; they ruled for 241,200 years. Then the flood swept over. After the flood had swept over, and the kingship had descended from heaven, the kingship was in Kish. In Kish, Gushur became king; he ruled for 1200 years ... (Total,) 23 kings; they ruled for 24510 years, 3 months, and 3 1/2 days. Then Kish was defeated and the kingship was taken to Eanna (= Temple of Uruk). In Eanna, Mesh-ki-ag-gasher, the son of Utu, became lord and king; he ruled for 324 years. Mesh-ki-ag-gasher entered the sea and disappeared. Enmerkar, the son of Mesh-ki-ag-gasher, the king of Uruk, who built Uruk, became king; he ruled for 420 years ... Gilgamesh, whose father was a phantom (?), the lord of Kulaba, ruled for 126 years. Ur-Nungal, the son of Gilgamesh, ruled for 30 years. .... (Total), 12 kings: they had ruled for 2,310 years. Then Uruk was defeated and the kingship was taken to Ur ... » (ETCSL 2.1.1, ll. 1-134)
As may be seen, according to this list, kingship 'descended from heaven' so as to be the prerogative of a specific urban venue until its defeat, after which the royal institution moved to another city, and so on for the rest of the long text. The initial section (ll. 1-40) relates to the antediluvian age: at this time, in a certain sense 'before history', the rulers had very long lives. Subsequently, kingship returned to earth and continued its passage from one city to the next; however, the 'post-diluvian' age is characterized by progressively shorter kingdoms. However, both phases present legendary characters – for example, Gilgamesh - or even mythological ones, such as Dumuzi and Meshkiaggasher, said to be the son of the sun god Utu. It is only later on that rulers known from other documents will begin to be mentioned and their years of reign will drop to quite normal and exact lengths. In practice, the text outlines a comprehensive history of kingship in Mesopotamia that proceeds diachronically from a 'dawn of time', absolutely amazing in the durations of the kingdoms and in its personages, up to the ages closer to the drafting of the text, with kings that were well-known and precisely recorded in administrative documents.

head of their armies, with the aim of conquering the world. In this same vein, Naram-Sin boasted that he had reached the Mediterranean coast to wash his weapons in the sea. 'King of totality' or 'king of the four parts of the world' were their innovative and beloved titles. This was a significant ideological change compared to the utterances of earlier Sumerian kings, merely tied to the Mesopotamian horizon; and the language of these conquering kings, marked by the centrality of Akkad on a very vast horizon, would serve as a model for the imperial feats of 'universalistic' type by kings in later millennia (Liverani 1993). In particular, posterity would report their deeds with adventurous and heroic terms and images that may be compared with those used in the Gilgamesh epic. The main achievements of the dynasty of Akkad not only included the unification of Mesopotamia under a single dominion, but also the establishment of a socio-political organization capable of coping with crises such as those that had caused the sudden fall of the previous kingdoms,

This inscription was also written on stone tablets, as well as on bronze canephore figurines. The presence of such a text on a foundation brick could be explained by the use - firmly established since the age of Gudea of Lagash - of making small brick capsules containing tablets of stone and metal figurines with the same inscription, as a sort of deposit placed under the foundations of a building.

The text goes on to mention the 'restoration of justice' carried out by the king with a clear reference to the promulgation of a code of laws in his name and ends with the mention of a building called the 'house of justice' for which the text was drafted.

such as Lugalzagesi of Umma. Power over the individual cities of the Akkadian empire - left on purpose without defensive walls - was delegated to a number of ensis ('princes' or 'city-heads'), who acted as local administrators on behalf of the state and took charge of tributes from agricultural revenues as well as military conscription; even the capital had its own ensi. The economic hierarchy of the kingdom was family-based, with the subjects as managers of their own 'households'; the high officials of the kingdom, including the ensi, enjoyed agricultural estates granted by the king, who had acquired them through conquest or expropriation. In summary, for the first time, the agrarian regime of Akkad broke away from the previous local particularism by redistributing land to the employees of the Crown in many different areas. As for the local communities, individual families had quotas in various fields for a fair distribution of risks, work activities, and income, thus resulting as members of the 'extended household' of the king, even if not as dependents. Hammurabi of Babylonia (1792-1750 BC). Hammurabi represents the culmination of the 'intermediate' period in which the small kingdoms of Mesopotamia were in the hands of rulers of Amorite origin. The Amorite people, of pastoral and tribal origin, had been definitely advantaged in their penetration by the political fragmentation and the collapse of urban life following the fall of Ur III. They appear to have found different arrangements in Mesopotamia: in some places as an integral part, and also leaders, of the 'sedentary' city and state formations, but elsewhere maintaining to a certain extent their original identity as populations of gentilic structure, primarily practicing pastoral transhumance (such as around Mari on the middle Euphrates). Essentially, then, the Amorites slowly became the socio-political protagonists of this 'new' Mesopotamia. Their Amorite origin was repeatedly emphasized by the rulers of Larsa and other locations with various titles, for example, 'Sheikh (rabianum) of the Amorites' or, as in the case of Sin-kashid of Uruk (1865-1835 BC), 'King of the tribe of Amnanum'. This type of genealogical indication, with reference to a nomadic and tribal past - thus in fact antithetical to any link with urban kingship as outlined in the 'Sumerian King List' would extend until the 18th century BC. Thus Shamshi-Adad of Assyria, stated that his most remote ancestors included '17 kings who lived in tents', while in his genealogy, Hammurabi indicated a succession from 'the dynastic time of the Guteans', 'of the Haneans' and finally, 'of the Amorites' (with Amnanum as oldest ancestor) which led to himself (Finkelstein 1966). Fictitious or inaccurate as they may have been, these genealogical indications show consciousness of a 'new beginning' in terms of an ethnic and linguistic identity that marked Mesopotamia after the fall of Ur III; but that did not prevent all of these 'Amorite' kings from quickly appropriating for themselves the cultural and religious foundations of most ancient Mesopotamia. With the new reunification of Mesopotamia carried out during his reign, which mainly concerned the 'land of Sumer and Akkad' of the earlier tradition of Ur III, but with a broader geographical scope like that of his antecedents in the empire of Sargon of Akkad, Hammurabi gave rise to an innovative political and territorial entity: Babylonia, a region dominated by the eponymous town (Babylon) on the Euphrates. The significance of the unified political framework built by Hammurabi, - and the organizational model that accompanied it - was handed down, ideally, by all successive rulers for over a millennium, until the coming of the Persian age. Hammurabi is particularly known thanks to the discovery of his renowned 'Law Code', the antecedents of which were already in the socalled 'reforms' of Urukagina of Lagash and Ur-Namma of Ur, and later fig. 39

on of Lipit-Ishtar of Isin. Like the latter king in particular, Hammurabi did not enact legal measures to be put into effect (shown by the contrast between many of his penalties and those imposed in contemporary legal deeds): in point of fact, his 'code' is a long list of customary rules of a self-celebratory nature, in which Hammurabi appears as the one who 'restored justice and equity' in his own country, especially by canceling in one stroke private and public debts. Undoubtedly at the base of the 'code' was the king's concern for a series of socio-economic failures that plagued the period (the breakdown of family structure, cyclically occurrence indebtedness without remedy, scarcity of agricultural wages). A similar practice was also adopted by one of his successors, Ammi-Saduqa (1646-1626), of whom we possess a draft of his edict of remission. Tiglath-Pileser III. Historians agree in assigning Tiglath-Pileser III a key role in the formation of the Assyrian Empire. In fact, this king managed to revive the fortunes of the Assyrian kingdom, weakened for more than half a century, and managed to make it become the power which between the eighth and seventh century BC ruled unopposed over the 'four parts of the world' then known. At the end of his reign, Assyria had acquired a precise imperial profile and, with his successors, would come to dominate the Near East from the Zagros Mountains to the shores of the Levant - also exerting political influence on Cyprus – and from the border with Egypt to central-eastern Anatolia and to the Persian Gulf, even establishing commercial relations with the oases in the Arabian desert. Starting with Tiglath-Pileser III, the conquered territory was organized according to a mixed system, where polities entrusted to pro-Assyrian rulers were subjected to the traditional tribute in alternation with actual provinces, ruled by governors appointed by the king, who were responsible for military and civil management (including the coordination of tax revenues). Vast deportations were implemented to eradicate and disperse the defeated upper classes throughout the empire. The defense of

tive hub of Puzrish- Dagan (today Drehem). and the reform of weights and measures, as well as of the calendar, which became the same for the whole kingdom (Steinkeller 1987). But Shulgi has also left us an image of himself as a king who was educated and proud of his achievements in the field of writing and knowledge in general. He had happy memories of his youth – to quote from his self-celebratory hymns - in the scribal schools (edubba) and claimed to have been the best student in the class.
« As a youth, I studied the scribal art in the edubba, From the tablets of Sumer and Akkad, Of all the nobles, none was able to write a tablet like me, In the place where people attend to learn the scribal art. Sums, subtraction, counting and accounting, I completed all (the courses); The beautiful Nanibgal, the goddess Nisaba, Generously endowed me with wisdom and intelligence » (Klein 1981:15)
Surely, as king, he became an enthusiastic patron of the arts and letters; he himself founded the Sumerian science academies in Ur and Nippur, although he certainly adapted them to his objectives, speaking of them as his 'libraries'. In these academies, officials from highly placed families learned to read propaganda texts concerning the dynasty of Ur, including hymns to Shulgi himself, for a proper political education which also included the figure of the king as an excellent 'scribe'. However, on a more basic level, Shulgi became interested in the standardization of writing (choice of signs and formulas) in the administrative texts of his time: and this goal was achieved, as can be seen from an overview of the texts of the period. Ashurbanipal. In addition to his military exploits, the last great Assyrian king is remembered for the formation of his own 'library', i.e. the huge collection of texts of the Sumerian-Akkadian learned tradition in the palaces in Nineveh. But this work was innovative only in the sense of its size: in fact, interest in techniques and works of ancient Mesopotamian wisdom can already be attributed to Middle Assyrian kings such as Tukulti-Ninurta I and Tiglath-Pileser I , who established extensive collections of literary and divination tablets in their palaces. And in the 1st millennium, Sennacherib had already presented Nineveh as the “abode of reserved wisdom, where every memorable works of artistic production, all the cults and secrets of the god Lalgar are gathered together” (Frahm 1997, 280). And Esarhaddon had already started gathering, copying, and archiving documents of Babylonian libraries to collect them in the Assyrian capital. But Ashurbanipal - in addition to continuing vigorously his father's work (Frame - George 2005) - viewed his interest in ancient Sumerian-Akkadian scribal culture also in a practical sense, by actually learning to read and write tablets. He thus ended a text of his own, a compendium of extispicy:
« “Tablet of Ashurbanipal, great king, mighty king, king of Assyria, the beloved of the great gods, to whom Shamash and Adad granted a broad understanding, and who learned and mastered extispicy, the secret of heaven and earth, the wisdom of Shamash and Adad.

the extensive imperial spaces was secured by internal and frontier forts and by the formation of a permanent army, also made up of contingents drawn from the vanquished populations. Tiglath-Pileser also marked a new period for the Assyrian kingdom, not only by personally engaging in the annual military campaigns and in the restructuring of the administrative system, but by also reining in any claim of internal autonomy on the part of the Magnates, who had reached peaks of autonomy – at the limits of insubordination - under his predecessors. With the early appointment of his son Shalmaneser (V) as crown prince, the king also identified who would have to take care of the internal administration of the state while he himself was engaged in military operations abroad. This model would be followed by his successor, Sargon II, with his son Sennacherib. Finally, Tiglath-Pileser was the Assyrian king who managed to maintain the best relations with the Babylonian region, divided between the inhabitants of the ancient cities, the Aramaic tribes, and the bellicose Chaldean groups. The ideological, political, cultural, and religious prestige of Babylonia led the king to allow the city special treatment, different from that accorded to the other provinces of the empire. In fact, after defeating the Chaldean rebel chief Mukin-zeri, the king rejected the appointment of a loyal vassal to the throne of Babylonia and made his own triumphal entry into the city, choosing the innovative formula of a dual monarchy ('King of Sumer and Akkad') linked to his own person (albeit with a different dynastic name, Pulu); in this capacity, he took part in the New Year's Feast in 729 and 728 BC. This move proved to be successful: Tiglath-Pileser was acclaimed by the population as legitimate king and Shalmaneser V, who succeeded him in 727, enjoyed the same status, under the dynastic name Ululayu.
Kingship as wise management
The ideology of kingship in Mesopotamia tended to present the king as a perfect representative of the gods for the maintenance of divine order on Earth. Thus, the ideal king was a combination of physical perfection and mental balance. In an Assyrian literary composition on the creation of man, the king appears to have been a being quite distinct from common man. Nonetheless, it is likely that most of the Mesopotamian kings had not developed their 'cultural' side to perfection; and in fact, that very few of them were able to read (and still less to write) the many texts that they dictated, promulgated, or promoted, by delegating these activities to their trustworthy scribes. Although it is impossible to settle this matter thoroughly for lack of precise information, we know, on the contrary, of two famous cases (distant in time from one another) in which the rulers claimed to have mastered the art of reading and writing: Shulgi of Ur and Ashurbanipal of Assyria. Shulgi di Ur. This long-lived king (2094-2047 BC) was known for his work in profoundly restructuring his state, which centered on the city of Ur and later expanded throughout southern Mesopotamia, to the Middle Tigris, and north-eastern areas, from Eshnunna to Gasur (Nuzi). The state of Ur III under Shulgi (cap. 138, cap. 139, cap. 140) was bureaucratically divided into different specialized centers, for the collection for primary products and for secondary industrial production under strict central control. His main reforms include: the creation of a standing army, the reorganization of the temple farmsteads, the creation of a single administrative system for the north and south of the country, the introduction of the bala system of taxation in favor of the state, centered on the administra

Elsewhere Ashurbanipal drew up his own 'autobiographical' profile, in which he claimed to have learned the art of Adapa, the first of the legendary Seven Sages (apkallu) who had flourished before the Flood (and his courtier blandished him, defining him a descendent “scion of an apkallu, in fact, of Adapa himself”). Alongside the different martial techniques (archery, use of the spear, driving a war chariot), as a young prince his education had also been broadened by the study of languages and disciplines that formed traditional Sumero-Akkadian wisdom. In particular, he stated:
« I have observed and discussed the signs of heaven and earth in the assembly of teachers. I debate with divination experts (the work called) 'the liver, picture of heaven'; I can resolve reciprocals and calculate complex problems that lack solution. I have read sophistcated texts in obscure Sumerian, and in a barely understandable Akkadian; I have studied inscriptions on stone from the time before the Flood, which are a mixture of impenetrable wisdom (kakku sakku) » (Villard 1997, 137).
But was everything the king boasted about true? Recently, emphasis has been placed on some letters in which the court scholars comment on particular words to be explained to the king or in which, on the contrary, the king himself poses questions to his experts, indicating that some concepts are not clear to him. Finally, there is a letter that seems to have been written by the king himself, but with an uncertain 'calligraphy' and an elementary choice of signs (Zamazalová in Radner-Robson 2011). In any case, in the late Neo-Assyrian Empire, it would seem that it had become customary for the royal princes to learn to read and write. This is what Sherua-etirat, the eldest daughter of Esarhaddon, wrote as a

of the Amorites, it has been suggested that widespread famine (perhaps due to climate change) may have made agriculture impossible. As a result, families and small communities from Syria or Upper Mesopotamia gradually moved further south, eventually forming a quite consistent group of migrants that caused the kings of the Ur III dynasty to erect a wall in the territory to keep them out (cap. 13). During this period, the Sumerian writers referred to the Amorites come from afar in satyrical but concerned tones, as in the myth of the Marriage of Martu:
« Look, their hands are destructive, their countenances like monkeys! They eat what is taboo for the god Nanna, they have no reverence at all! ... They are an abomination to the temples of the gods, their minds are confused, they are people who cause only disturbance. ...

Nomadic and sedentary populations. The Ancient Near East has left much information on the nomadic way of life. Ancient Near Eastern nomadism was a complex phenomenon combining distinctive characteristics. Social organisation was of the gentilic type, binding the individual to an extended family or clan, then to a tribe or tribal confederation. The predominant form of occupation was shepherding with sheep and goats, although with some recourse to agriculture at certain times and places. Mobility ranged from seasonal transhumance over the steppes or on the hills, riding donkeys, to the full penetration of desert zones after the domestication of the dromedary (the one-humped camel) in the 1st millennium BC. Today we tend to consider nomadism from the viewpoint of economic adaptability, as one of the possible life choices available to ancient man, under the pressure of various contingencies and with many operational variations. The traditional theories positing the arrival of nomadic peoples from the desert, moving to conquer fertile Mesopotamia in successive waves from the 3rd to the 1st millennium, have all been discredited. At most, in the case

places (tents) next to houses built of mud bricks, as also demonstrated by some modern anthropological cases. Another significant factor was that of political and institutional interaction. It is customary to indicate the many cases in which membership in a tribe – a communal structure par excellence – implied opposition to the social and political organization of the State, with its power-sharing hierarchies. Here too, however, complex situations could arise. In the archives of the middle Euphrates city-state of Mari (18th cent. BC), we find various forms of interaction – at times collaborative, at times oppositional – between the monarchy and the tribal groups of Amorites that occupied the surrounding steppe (Heimpel 2003: 13-37; Fleming in Szuchman 2009). City and country: village life. Along with the dichotomy between nomadic and sedentary peoples, the relationship between city and country has been much debated. Did actual rural communities, with their own productive, economic and administrative features, exist? Or were the farming villages little more than offshoots of the cities, useful only for providing agricultural products and men-at-arms to the urban ruling classes that operated through bureaucrats and governors? This question has become more urgent in recent decades, when archaeological excavations in areas far from the major urban centres (Northern Iraq, Syria and Kurdistan) have revealed the widespread presence, on the regional level, of small villages and
who eats raw meat, who has no house of his during his lifetime, and who will not be brought to any burial place when he dies! » (Klein 1997; Jahn 2007)
What is certain is that nomadism in Mesopotamia and the surrounding areas, especially in the 3rd and 2nd millennia BC, was of the so-called ‘enclosed’ type, entirely unlike the ‘open’ type, free of barriers, characteristic of nomadic peoples in Central Asia, from the Scythians to the Mongols (Rowton 1974). Within the Fertile Crescent instead, the itineraries of the Ancient Near Eastern nomads were restricted to areas not devoted to agriculture or occupied by settlements. With their animals, used for pasture and transport, the nomads could not remain entirely, or even at length, in desertic zones (such as inland Syria) but were forced to roam across the steppes bordering the rural villages and cultivated fields of the sedentary population. Accordingly, agricultural land and fields used for pasturage were closely linked; shepherds frequently shared the land they roamed over with farmers. Obviously, such interaction between nomads and sedentary peoples gave rise to frequent conflict, but also to more complex modes of cohabitation. For instance, nomads sometimes settled in agricultural villages and owned their own land, but without foregoing their bonds of tribal kinship; or they kept their temporary dwelling

The text consists of a list of cereal rations in two columns: on the left appears the quantity, in emâru, sutu, e qa(ʼu), on the right the recipient (either an individual, a group of persons or a sector of the palace). This list concerns the personnel of the royal palace. The amounts provided at the end of the text are much larger than the sum of the individual ‘items’ in the document. To ‘balance the books’, the scribes’ note on the obverse is essential. This is in fact a ‘carryover’ relevant to the quantities missing on the tablet. The document in question was thus part of a longer series listing rations for the palace.

si-feudal productive unit, populated only by servants – the village enjoyed a community structure that provided for common goods and services, with relationships of mutual support, joint stratagems of security and lastly, the tendency to self-perpetuation in the best possible conditions (Liverani 1999).
Life and work in rural areas
Although, as previously mentioned, cuneiform tablets and cylinder seals provide a good picture of productive activities in the urban milieu (temples and palaces), information on daily life in the rural zones of Mesopotamia and around it is not entirely lacking, for all the historic phases of Antiquity. Mainly in the texts but also in figurative scenes, various operations or aspects of the agricultural seasonal cycle are described and illustrated. A text from the Neo-Assyrian period, dealing with barley, describes harvesting operations (cap. 147), while a document from the Middle Assyrian (or the early Neo-Assyrian period) lists rations of cereals (cap. 144). Ploughing scenes (cap. 148) are common in seals from various periods, as proof of the widespread use of the seeder plough, documented for the first time at the beginning of the 2nd Early Dynastic period. Stock raising was also a fundamental resource for the ancient Mesopotamians. Pastoralism may be defined as a subsistence system based mainly on the products (meat, milk and by-products) of domesticated animals. It has been supposed (Sherratt 1981) that a ‘revolution in secondary products’ took place in the ancient Near East during the Neolithic period (5th and 4th millennia BC). Before this time, animals are thought to have been raised mainly for meat.
hamlets. Here, unlike the much more densely populated agricultural hinterland of Southern Mesopotamia – where the countryside seems to have been actually urbanized, especially under the Ur III Dynasty (Steinkeller 2007) – the rural centres seem linked to the city only by long trails over the steppe, probably used to transport foodstuffs or other goods; but apart from this, they must have been fully self-sufficient, albeit at a low subsistence level. An important feature in the historical evaluation of the city-countryside relationship is security, or the ability of the rural communities to defend themselves against hostile thrusts from nomads or invasion by foreign armies. This is demonstrated by a number of fortified farms (dimtu in Akkadian: Kolinski 2001) built on the steppes of northern Mesopotamia, from the Mittanian to the Middle Assyrian period; and later, from the early 1st millennium onward, by the fortification of small villages all over this area and beyond the Euphrates in the Levant, as defense against Assyrian invaders who – as we know from the inscriptions of their rulers – frequently pillaged rural villages to find provisions for their armies. Summing up, much still remains to be done to understand the economic, social and administrative dynamics of the Mesopotamian rural areas in different historical periods, both in themselves and in relation to the nearby cities, The Near Eastern village was undoubtedly a complex phenomenon. Encapsulating diverse activities and specializations, it also comprised varying social components; moreover, it could interact in various ways with different political-economic agents (the royal palace above all, but sometimes the temple as well). It is however probable that, for most of its history – when it had not yet been transformed into a qua

– who not only hunted them but also referred to them as comparison for their own strength and aggressiveness – and thus must have been relatively abundant on the steppes, such as the Jezirah of northern Mesopotamia. Other Near Eastern bovids, present at least in the piedmont or plateau environment, were the bison (bison bison caucasicus), which probably give rise to the hybrid figure of the man-bison in art. The written texts mention animals that were ‘fattened on grass’ (cap. 13) or ‘on barley’ (cap. 145). In the figurative arts we find various scenes linked to this practice, for example, domestic animals led by men in processions and probably going to be sacrificed (cap. 154), or milking and cheese-making activities, usually linked to the myth of Etana (cap.73, cap. 74). Scenes of this kind were probably related to concepts of fertility and prosperity. The subject matter of the seals shows how a population closely bound to agricultural and pastoral activities as its source of sustenance, based its favorite legends on heroes intent on taming wild animals and protecting domestic ones. The motif of the contest between animals and between men and animals, as we have seen, has remote origins in Mesopotamian seals. The earliest cylinder seals, especially those of the Jemdet Nasr period, also depict scenes of work and craftsmanship, such as the production of pottery by women (cap. 49). Since making terracotta vases (cap. 155, cap. 181) did not require highly sophisticated tools or real workshops, this activity was probably carried out in houses or courtyards. Obviously, making stone vases (cap. 156, cap. 159) instead called for special utensils and more complex procedures, which likely took place in palaces or temples. Another very familiar subject in Mesopotamian is the banqueting scene, showing persons intent on eating or drinking from vases and cups (cap. 157, cap. 158, cap. 161) or using straws to drink from large jars that must have contained beer (cap. 149). The pre
Utilizing domestic animals for their sub-products – leather, wool, milk and perhaps bones – thus represented a fundamental change, with reflections on eating habits when milk began to be consumed and used to make such dairy products as butter, cheese and yoghurt. Another related innovation, dating from Neolithic times, is the use of cattle as work force, that is, for plowing the fields yoked to a cart – and as local means of transporting foodstuffs; donkeys were also used for the latter purpose. Raising small animals (goats and sheep, which in Akkadian are called by the same word, senu) was more common, since they were better suited to the semi-arid conditions and markedly seasonal rainfall typical of the entire Near East, and to the alternation of valleys or plains with hilly areas. Goats and sheep, both belonging to the Ungulate family and, individually, subject to a wide range of fertile hybridization (although not to cross-breeding, perhaps for anatomical reasons) could graze in the same ecological zones, although sheep favor level fields with low-rising vegetation while goats prefer the steep hills that are safer from predators. Both of these species, however, although feeding mainly on grass in pastures, can also consume leafy vegetation, such as undergrowth in the forests (Gilbert 2002). Bovids, on the contrary, had to be raised near permanent sources of water, since they drink more than sheep and goats; and they could be kept near the village or city where they were stabled, allowing better overall control (of the number of head born/dead each year, of feeding, butchering, etc.) as compared to sheep and goats. Domesticated bovids were crucially important economically in every period of Mesopotamian history, for two different reasons: they pulled the plough, and they provided meat for precious offerings to the temples and the gods. Although definitively extinct four centuries ago, the wild bulls (bos primigenius, in Akkadian rimu) were frequently mentioned by Mesopotamian kings

ture, animals shared with human beings such attributes as youth, old age and mortality; pride, anger, aggression, sorrow and fear; domesticity, discipline and vulnerability. Some animals became symbolic of, or synonymous with, human qualities; among these were the lion and the bull, which denoted courage and aggression, and the bat, symbol of a fluttering shiver of fear. Like human beings, animals could be either indigenous or foreigners, they could have personal traits and emotions, families and even their own names (cap. 146). As property, animals could be brought to life or killed, could be bought and sold. They could bring wealth, prestige, protection or healing. The animals were protected by the gods but owed them no service, unlike men. Each individual animal was representative of its own group, in contrast to the human being’s specific individuality. Accordingly, the ‘serpent’ is indicated in magic spells as a genus entirely hostile to man:
« It (the serpent) came in by a crevice, It went out by a drain. It struck the "gazelle" (human infant?) while it slept, It secreted itself in a withered oak. The serpent lurks in a beam, The serpent lurks in the wool. »
In a sharp-witted dispute between the Bird and the Fish, the latter is quick to describe the annoying behavior and sounds of birds:
cise meaning of this ceremony is still obscure, although it almost certainly represented a communal gathering of political nature. Sharing food and drink with other individuals of the same social class served to reinforce existing bonds. It cannot be ruled out, however, that this scene may have represented the banquet held during funeral ceremonies, the kispum ritual mentioned in texts from the second millennium BC.
Wild and domestic animals
The texts written in cuneiform show various reactions to the presence of animals as well as the influence of animal life on human experience and in the collective imagination. The literary texts, in both Sumerian and Akkadian, sharply distinguish animals from human beings, demons, and deities. In the lexical texts, long lists of names and typologies of animals were compiled. In divination, which represented an important scientific endeavor in Mesopotamia, the physical characteristics of animals and their behavior were subjected to observation. An omen series (Shumma alu) was based on encounters between man and various animals, ranging from the most common ones (birds, cattle, sheep and goats) to reptiles (lizards, geckos), mongooses, mice, shrewmice, insects of various kinds, worms, crickets, grasshoppers, and chameleons, with either favorable or unfavorable outcomes (Freedman 1998).

of artistic representations. One of man’s first requisites, in fact, was that of exactly depicting what he saw around him, things whose beauty surprised him and filled him with awe. Moreover, through hunting and fishing first and domestication later, animals provided one of the main sources of food for ancient man, and as such were the most suitable repertoire for a rural population. Scenes of hunting, probably having magical and propitiatory significance to ensure the success of the undertaking, were always especially prevalent in figurative art. As concerns the figurative representations of animals, it is fundamental to distinguish between two levels of semantic attribution. The first level reflects the real world, that is, an animal means exactly what it seems to mean. But man also found symbolic and allegorical significance in the animal world. Animals, for instance, could serve as symbols of a deity or represent its specific aspects. The attributes of a god could appear beside it or could take its place, as an entirely zoomorphic manifestation. Thus, in Mesopotamian art, the deities were sometimes replaced by their symbolic animals (for instance, the dog for the goddess of medicine Gula). Animals were also represented for their intrinsic characteristics, such as strength, fierceness, speed or dignity. In the first millennium BC, for instance, the scorpion – which in Mesopotamia was associated with fertility, but also with an apotropaic function, to ward off evil – represented the queen, while the lion confronted by the Assyrian king in the characteristic stamp seals (or in hunting scenes on Assyrian bas-reliefs) was the valiant enemy fated to succumb. At times, the bodies of one or more animals and the human body were blended together, to form a hybrid being, possessing both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic features. The motif of animals in heraldic confrontation appears frequently in ancient art (cap. 162). In the field of art, a composition formed of two figures confronting each other forms what is commonly known as a heraldic motif. From a purely geometric viewpoint, this kind of representation obeys the laws of the simplest form of symmetry, termed bilateral mirror symmetry. In Mesopotamian seals
« Bird, you know no shame; you fill the courtyard with your droppings, The sweeper-boy, who cleans the courtyard, chases you with ropes. By your call the household is disturbed; they flee from your din! ... With your ugly screech you disturb the night; no one sleeps well »
But the Bird’s answer is no less venomous, ridiculing the physique and smell of the Fish:
« Your mouth is a heap; though your snout goes around in a circle, you can't see behind you. Your hips are amputated, not to mention your arms, hands, and feet— try to tell your neck from your feet! Your stench is revolting, you make people gag, they wrinkle up their noses at you! No trough would hold the kind of slops you eat, And he who has carried you hates to let his hand touch his skin! »
Domestic animals or those in some way connected to man (such as dogs and pigs), but also wild animals, are often made anthropomorphous in Mesopotamian literary compositions as symbols or examples of human conduct. The following Sumerian ‘fable’, with the fox appearing as the exemplification of shrewdness, is a forerunner of the Greek and Latin compositions of Aesop and Phaedrus, and even recalls the eighteenth-century work of La Fontaine, although without conveying any moral:
« Once there were nine wolves, but ten sheep, one too many to divide among them. When the fox came upon them, he said, "Let me divide the shares. For you, being nine, there is one. I, being one, will take nine. That is my preferred share”. »
Since prehistoric times, animals have always been a favorite subject

have been as widespread as their representations in art (cap. 160) and in literature would make it seem. Lions were also considered an appropriate decoration for the heads of ceremonial maces (cap. 170). The dedications inscribed on some of them clearly show that the lion was not the emblem of any particular god, but indicated the warlike nature latent in the character of most of the gods. The lion was also a symbol closely linked to regal power. Among the animals most frequently represented, the ungulates predominated. Their images can sometimes be identified as goats, rams (cap. 166), antelopes, gazelles (cap. 50), deer, oryxes, mouflons or ibexes, based on the shape of their horns, but is often hard to determine the species with certainty (the animal depicted in cap. 182, for example, could be either a mouflon or an ibex) due both to stylistic differences (in some periods, animals are highly stylized; see for ex. cap. 173, cap. 172) and to the minute size of the seals. In the Iron Age, horses appear as well (cap. 180). Less frequent are representations of wild boars, which lived in the marshes of southern Mesopotamia. The bull was the original victim of the lion in the conflict between wild and domestic animals. At first, it is the bull that the hero is called upon to protect. Later, in contest scenes, it also became an enemy. The bull is commonly found in all periods. It appears not only on cylinder seals but also on stamp seals, which in the Jemdet Nasr period are frequently shaped in the form of this animal; and in other artistic expressions, such as stone vases (cap. 183), amulets (cap. 163; in this case the animal depicted is probably a calf) and objects made of ivory (cap. 171). The creature commonly indicated in studies on seals as a bull with a human head is more probably a bison from the Zagros mountains. For a brief time during the Akkadian period, bisons were represented very realistically, making them easy to distinguish. Zebus instead appear only very rarely. A seal from the Achaemenid period (cap. 83) depicts a zebu advancing to the right. Note the exceptional skill of the seal-maker, who renders the musculature and other anatomical details with consummate ability. For its refined incision and spa
the iconographical motif of two animals in heraldic confrontation sometimes displays a central figure, which could be the so-called “ lord of animals” (cap. 150) or a winged genius (cap. 151), or at other times the sacred tree (Giovino 2007) occupying the centre of the scene. In these cases, the central figure or the tree served as axis of symmetry. The scene with animals appearing on either side of a central plant was widespread during later periods as well, appearing in Persian, Muslim and Byzantine art; in the latter periods, this motif, having lost its original religious significance, was based on the concepts of symmetry, abstraction and decorative preciousness that are its salient artistic features. Felines began to appear very early on Mesopotamian seals (cap. 164). They usually symbolized the dangerous, threatening aspect of wild nature, while horned animals evoked the peaceful side of nature, domestication and fertility. The motif of the lion attacking a domestic animal appears very frequently in the Late Uruk period (cap. 48), showing how this animal was seen by the ancient stock-breeders as a serious threat to their herds. Note, however, that struggles between animals alone without the involvement of human beings also held intimations to Mesopotamian astronomical concepts. The predators most often appearing in contest scenes are undoubtedly lions, which represent the chief adversary of the hero (or the bull-man) and a constant threat to domestic animals in every period. From the end of the Early Dynastic II period, their heads began to be represented as if seen from above (cap. 53, cap. 76, cap. 54), while starting from the Akkadian II period, they are always shown in profile with gaping jaws, in a threatening attitude (cap. 152). In the Akkadian period (ca. 2350-2200 BC), animals were represented with extreme scientific precision and remarkable naturalistic attention to anatomical details such as musculature. More rarely found are leopards (cap. 182), which appear in contest scenes only for a limited time, more precisely in the Early Dynastic II period (cap. 153). Lions and leopards became extinct in the Near East only about a hundred years ago. However, they do not seem to

the animals in their most typical attitudes, using stereotypes, the artists attempted to reduce the various components of the world to single concepts. This was most likely a subconscious phenomenon. Lastly, it should be noted that seals have often provided the only proof of the existence of a particular faunal species. As previously mentioned, no other means offers such a rich, diversified source of images as seals. Even when their significance remains largely enigmatical, the scenes are dominated by representations of animals. In spite of the difficulty of precisely identifying certain species, the attention to detail and to anatomical features characteristic of certain periods makes it very tempting to utilize these data to enrich our knowledge of ancient Mesopotamian fauna.
Life expectancy. Human health and healing
« Life is connected to death, death is connected to life. Man does not live forever; the days of his life are numbered. Since terrible diseases plague humanity, if man were immortal would it not be torture for him? » (Hittite prayer of Kantuzzili, 15th cent. BC, from Singer – Hoffner 2002, 32) It is recognized today (Fales 2016) that our knowledge of the health of the peoples of ancient Mesopotamia is still far from any precise historical-scientific analysis. Only the latest results of palaeo-anthropological analysis, and specifically palaeo-pathological examination of the skeletons found in archaeological excavations, could change this picture in the near future. It is certain, however, that the enjoyment of a long life, healthy in body and mind was an ideal in Mesopotamian culture; to such a point that the priestess Adda-guppi, mother of King Nabonidus of Babylonia, who reached the venerable age of 104 between the middle of the 7th and the middle of the 6th century BC, proudly declared:
« My eyesight was good, my hearing excellent, my hands and feet were sound, my words well chosen, food and drink agreed with me, my health was fine and my mind happy. »
cious background, this image is reminiscent of Greek gemstones from the 5th century BC. Birds, including wading birds (cap. 167, cap. 175) and raptors (cap. 168, cap. 165), are naturally linked to the celestial sphere, while snakes (cap. 182) – appearing from time to time in every period refer to the chthonic world of subterranean waters but also to the idea of danger, death and the cycle of rebirth. Many scholars have noted a funerary aspect in the representation of some animals, especially serpents and raptors. Fish, often associated with the god of the subterranean waters Ea/Enki, are used as a filler motif and, mainly on the Jemdet Nasr seals (cap. 51) and those of the Mittanic Period, as designs in themselves. As for the arachnids, scorpions – which are closely related to the erotic and procreational sphere – were popular in most periods, especially in Syria (cap. 176), while spiders are found only on Jemdet Nasr seals (cap. 174), where they are sometimes associated with the so-called ‘pigtailed ladies’ and may represent Uttu, the goddess of weaving in Sumerian mythology. Insects, such as the flies serving as filler elements on Isin-Larsa seals, are only rarely represented. Other animals appear less frequently and sometimes their interpretation, considering the scarcity of the available material, remains dubious. This is the case of monkeys (cap. 120), which were imported to the Near East in various periods and became a symbol of prestige in the 3rd and early 2nd millennium BC. A fossil tooth of an animal carved in the shape of a bear, resembling other examples found in the Middle Euphrates city of Mari (the modern Tell Hariri), dates from the time of the shakkanakkus (second half of the 3rd millennium BC), while another figurine of a seated bear (cap. 169) comes from Tell Brak, in the Upper Habur region, and is datable to the 4th millennium BC. Except for Assyrian art, the representation of animals in the various artistic forms is never of narrative nature. The artists did not attempt to depict animals for decorative or naturalistic purposes. On the contrary, they chose some species which they represented with special care and attention, emphasizing, for example, the horns of bulls, goats and deer, the open jaws of lions (to suggest their terrifying roar) and the connection of reptiles to the earth.

ate seeds, members of the pea/bean family, cucumbers and melons, green and root vegetables, along with a great variety of spices (cumin, coriander, fenugreek, etc.). In contrast to the overall good quality of the food, both in itself and in relation to health, the ancient Mesopotamian peoples were exposed to a broad range of potential health hazards. These risks kept the infant mortality rate high, both at birth and in early childhood (cap. 188, cap. 185) and the life expectancy of an adult must have been very short by modern standards. Disease was often recorded in texts dealing with daily life. The possible causes were attributed to nutritional deficiencies, inadequate food preservation, or hazards from water, parasites, animals (e.g. scorpions, snakes, or rabid dogs), and lastly, infections contracted by chance. For instance, tetanus (shashshatu) must have been widespread due to the custom of walking barefoot in an environment abounding in tetanus spores. A definition of this disease is found in a Late Babylonian medical text from Uruk:
« Shashshatu afflicts that one’s limbs like a snake whose head a man has beaten. He (=the sick person) does not drink good bread, he does not drink good water, he does not sleep good sleep. He spends every day in woe. He cannot turn his limbs; they (feel as if they) had been cut apart the way a lying rush bends it neck. »
Lastly, an Assyrian incantation (derived from an original from the preceding millennium) describes the mythological ‘genesis’ of the ergot – the dangerous fungus named Claviceps purpurea – within the whole cycle of the creation of nature and agriculture:
« Incantation. In the beginning, before creation (itself), the rural work-song (alala) came down to the land. The seeder-plow bore the seed furrow, the furrow bore the germ, the germ the rootstock, the root-stock the node, the node the ear, the ear the ergot. The Sun-God reaped (and) the Moon-God gleaned; when the Sun-God was reaping (and) the Moon-God was gleaning, the ergot entered into the eye of the man. Stand by, Sun-God and MoonGod, so that the ergot may come out! »
A specific connection between nutrition, regular diet and good health was also recognized (as in the modern saying, ‘an apple a day keeps the doctor away’). This can be seen in the following letter from the exorcist Adad-šumu-us.ur to the Assyrian King Esarhaddon (680-669 BC), who was in poor health – or perhaps merely a hypochondriac:
« Eating of bread and drinking of wine will soon remove the illness of the king. Good advice is to be heeded: restlessness, not eating and not drinking disturbs the mind and adds to illness. In this matter the king should listen to his servant. »
Conversely, in a psalm by Ashurbanipal I of Assyria (1070-1032 BC) dedicated to the goddess Ishtar of Nineveh, a description of the sovereign’s many disorders includes the inability to appreciate food, accompanied by music:
« I do not go near the meal I am to eat, [ ] / Beer, the support of life, has become disgusting to me, / I loathe the sennet and sounding of strings, which are kingship’s due, / Thus am I deprived of the joys of living! »
However, looking beyond the rulers’ attitudes toward nourishment and health (as are reflected in figurative scenes, see for example cap. 161), we find an extremely rich and varied taxonomy of nutritional substances emerging from the texts and from bone deposits found in archaeological excavations. The nutritional panorama of ancient Mesopotamia includes cereals (especially barley but also wheat, spelt and wild species used to make all kinds of bread) as well as beer, animal products (milk and butter from goats and sheep, honey from bees), meat from butchered animals (again, sheep and goats, with the every-present mutton) and from bovids, wild and domesticated swine, poultry, ducks, geese, gazelles, birds, fish and shellfish. Plant residues found on archaeological sites indicate the presence of chickpeas, lentils, fava beans, apricots, dates (also employed for beer), figs, grapes, olives, walnuts, sesame seeds (used to make oil), vetches, acorns, onions and garlic, capers, pomegran

institutionally ‘religious’ ones, as instead would become the case for later civilizations, beginning with the Graeco-Roman age. Many of the chief gods in the vast Sumero-Akkadian pantheon, as well as personal deities linked to the patient, his family and his ancestors, represented ‘hands’, and thus were identified as responsible for physically ‘touching’ (or at times ‘seizing’, even ‘striking’) the body and thus causing physical and mental affliction. This action was due to the god’s displeasure or anger with the patient, whether he had violated a taboo or transgressed the social order, even unwittingly.
« If he was wounded on the skull and (consequently) his ears do not hear – “hand” of Ishtar. »
Other agents of disease – possibly belonging to a lower rank in the ‘hierarchy’ of the supernatural – consisted of a wide array of malevolent demons, active especially at nighttime, interfering in the mechanisms of sleep, along with ghosts and spirits of the dead. The demons, who – unlike the gods – were uninterested in receiving worship or prayers, could be countered only by powerful activities of magical nature. Apotropaic practices, exorcism, and transferring the evil elsewhere, at times through the friendly intercession of a propritiated god, were employed alternatively to ward off, or if possible overcome, these influences. Such activities were carried out by exorcists, priests and physicians. (cap. 187).
« If his temple afflicts him so that he continually cries out, his temporal blood vessels (feel like they) are pulsating greatly, and the seam of his head (feels like it) is open – “hand” of a ghost. He (=the patient) will die »
Most of the information on the Mesopotamian approach to health comes from a vast repertory of medical texts handed down to us from the Assyro-Babylonian civilization. Indisputably, these texts are highly useful for perceiving how poor health, disease and suffering were understood in Mesopotamia, as well as the methods adopted to survive or coexist with these problems. At the basis of this repertory, accumulated over the centuries (and known to us mainly from records from the 1st millennium BC), we find a ‘personalistic’ approach to the causes (aetiology) of diseases. They were seen as provoked by the active, purposeful intervention of one or more agents against the patient – who was thus seen as a victim – with little or no room for accident or chance in the process of contracting an illness. The signs and symptoms of many and diverse afflictions were referred back to specific agents (‘hands’) originating from outside the person and physically entering in contact with his body, albeit invisibly. Now, of course, this external etiological sphere for the attribution of observable symptoms and its outcomes pertains to what we (on the basis of our Western cultural heritage) term the nonhuman, the supernatural or the metaphysical; however, it must be firmly underscored that the Mesopotamians viewed it as a fully constituent part of reality. This broad domain was ‘empirically’ perceived as swarming with divinities, demons, ghosts and spirits, divided into complex groups by rank and function, although free to operate chaotically or at random on human health. With these premises, obviously, any method for countering the ‘hands’, from the use of pharmacological substances to magical practices, was employed by the healers specialized in different fields. And in the end, no rift was considered to exist between ‘magical’ activities and

dums, describing medical substances and their preparation, and (3) the three ‘manuals’ of the šhikinšhu series, constructed according to the explanatory scheme ‘(the element x) – its appearance (is like the element y)’, which correspond to the lapidaries, herbariums and bestiaries of later traditions. Included in the latter group is the abnu shikinshu series, a ‘lapidary’ that lists the names of stones based on their apparent resemblance to other natural elements (for example, ‘the stone whose appearance is like a carp in a river – alabaster is its name’), with sub-specifications in color, design, and texture. The medical importance of these stones often is barely hinted at (as ‘for childbirth’) or remains implicit. Lastly, a third category consists of lexical lists, usually bilingual (in Sumerian with Akkadian beside it) of names of body parts and names of diseases.
Pharmacopeia
The materia medica of the Mesopotamian healing specialists was consistent with worldwide folk tradition of natural medicine, based on centuries-long practice in the observation, selection and functional processing of specific plant products, animal parts, and mineral elements. In this domain, moreover, a series of fixed choices may be presumed on the basis of the local biological inventory and of Near Eastern environmental conditions, especially as regards the availability of the main component, plants. Mesopotamia however, unlike Graeco-Roman antiquity, has left us no theoretical work or treatise on the manner of extracting and preparing these natural ingredients, or combining them into recipes. What we know of this subject can only be deduced from the multiple descriptions of
Texts. The Mesopotamian medical texts comprise a vast number of documents of different kinds, coming mainly from Assyria and Babylonia in the 1st millennium BC, but with earlier antecedents and branches extending elsewhere (Syria, Anatolia), for a total of several thousand tablets. Accordingly, these texts contain incomparably greater and more varied information on medical knowledge than can be found in Egyptian papyri, despite the fame of the latter. Pre-eminent is the collection of symptomatology for the whole body (titled Sakikkū, ‘symptoms’), which was originally compiled by the erudite Esagil-kīn-apli of Borsippa in southern Mesopotamia around the middle of the 11th century BC. Over the course of time it became a ‘canon’ of 40 tablets with over 3000 entries. Sakikkū – of which two passages are given above by way of example– appears fully in line with the Babylonian tradition of divination, having an observational-deductive nature with an a-b-c pattern: first of all (a) the symptoms shown by the patient are described in detail ‘from head to foot’ in hypothetical form (‘if...’); from them (b) a diagnosis is derived with reference to the ‘hand’ responsible for these symptoms, and lastly (c) a prognosis is offered, in terms of healing or death. A second corpus consists of collections of therapeutical texts (bultu), divided into sub-groups dealing with the different parts of the body, from head to feet. Basically, both of these collections can be classified as texts concerned with initially describing the clinical signs, and deducing from them ulterior consequences in terms of the patient’s healing or death (cap. 178, cap. 179). A second category consists of texts devoted mainly to listing specific therapeutical means, either isolated or with reference to their main usage. These include (1) lexical lists of substances with parallel linguistic information, (2) therapeutic repertories or memoran

the applications themselves – i.e. from the individual case-studies, which could be written out at length, or not, possibly even depending on individual scribal whims. Plants – which also included herbs, trees and bushes, spices, grasses, algae, aromatic species, and even fungi of numerous types were used dry or fresh, and their parts (roots, shoots, stems, leaves, seeds, blossoms, fruits) or even by-products (flour, powder, chips, and ashes) could be ground, sifted, soaked, boiled or grilled. For oral or anal administration, inert carriers or diluents such as water, beer, vinegar, honey, milk were used. Mesopotamian pharmacopoeia also included numerous mineral substances (various types of plaster, bitumen, salts, alum, nitre, verdigris, crushed stones, specific types of mud, etc.) also formed Mesopotamian pharmacopoeia. However, the nature of such mineral ingredients is especially difficult to determine, as is their precise therapeutic use, in relation to the purity, or viceversa to their nature as compounds (e.g. sulphur, arsenic, etc.), and finally to their quality as precious stones or not. Finally, further healing ingredients were represented by animal matter, although it is difficult to assess exactly which and how many substances of animal origin were used for healing purposes. Alongside body parts and fluids/organs (blood, bile) of domesticated animals such as sheep, goat, pig, cow, and donkey, also parts of wild fauna such as birds, fish, reptiles, and amphibians, as well as insects, arachnids, crustacea, and molluscs, with their products, secretions or constituents (honey, eggshells and animal shells, coral, etc.), could have found employment in healing alongside a purely culinary utilization.

memorate war are decidedly numerous. This may be seen starting from the pre-Sargonic period and the images of Naram-Sin of Akkad, up to the hundreds of limestone slabs carved in bas-relief that decorated the Assyrian royal palaces, where the theme of violent conquest predominates with great detail and crude realism. The offers of weapons to the gods (cap. 189) also clearly indicate that warfare was an integral part of a widespread sense of urban and territorial defense, in Assyria and Babylonia (cap. 195, cap. 196) as well as in the bordering regions (cap. 197, cap. 193, cap. 190). This defensive feeling included protection of the local cults from invasion by enemies, and the plea for divine aid in battle (cap. 177). Today, while detailed and in-depth analysis of traditional military history continues (type of weapons, of battles, tactics and strategies, etc.), a new stage of research has begun, focusing on the social, economic and cultural aspects, and most notably on the ideological and religious facets, of war in the ancient Near East. (Vidal 2010; Fales 2011) Documentation of a of a condition of peace, or at least of the hope of peace, appears instead mainly in the written texts. In keeping with a recent approach (Foster 2007), peace in ancient Mesopotamia may be examined from various points of view: (1) as the aim of formal pacts and treaties establishing agreements among different groups and/or individuals; (2) as a result within an individual group, thanks to a good and wise political management; and (3) as the subject of intellectual reflection on the order of the world. Pacts and treaties stipulating peace among individuals or different social groups have come down to us in forty or so examples, from the 3rd to the 1st millennium BC, with differences that reflect chang
All of these were subjected to chopping, crushing, mincing and pulverizing. As for the implements used, a recipe prescribes to grind drugs in a lead mortar (esittu); while for mineral substances, a mortar called ursu, probably made of stone, was required. Preparation was laborious in case of extraction of the active components (e.g. plant alkali). The methods utilized were maceration, decoction and digestion (placing substances in ovens at a temperature of 40°-50° C). The patient received these administrations in liquid form with the use of various carriers – as potions or as enemas – or else in solid form, through pills, suppositories, and various powders. Ointments or creams and liniments, as well as poultices and pastes, required semi-liquid dosage. Ointments were meant to soften or soothe the skin; carriers containing ghee, oil and oil extractions, suet, wax, or animal fat, constituted the base of a special form of ointment for the eyes. Oily carriers were also essential components of liniments to treat muscle complaints through massaging, as well as of creams for external use. Pastes, bearing a higher proportion of solid items, such as powders, were presumably used in dilution with oily components and plant pulps and spread onto strips of wool or other fabrics, for introduction into delicate body parts (ears, nostrils, vagina, or anus). Fumigation was also known. Here the medicinal ingredients were put into a censer or burned over a fire, alone or mixed with oily carriers or plant saps (cap. 184).

tions on the weaker party, entirely to the advantage of the stronger one (Liverani 1994). A second kind of peace corresponds to the harmony reigning within a group (tribe, region, or State). The self-celebratory propaganda of the Mesopotamian kings expresses this concept in many different ways, depending on the period. In the 3rd millennium BC, the concept of social harmony established by the rulers implies the return to a primeval condition in which wickedness, misappropriation,
es in the political situations of the individual periods (Canfora et al. 1990; Grayson 1997). Obviously, in these cases “peace” is a concept of diplomatic and political nature, which almost always reflects the long- or short-term advantages of the stipulating parties, in relation to the ‘contractual strength’ of each of them. The examples range from parithetic agreements, based on reciprocity, to flagrantly unbalanced treaties, where the cessation of hostilities and/or freedom of exchange underscore a unilateral decision imposing heavy condi

Tablet in Akkadian cuneiform
Although the overall subject is childbirth, the tablet consists of two quite different halves: a text of medical prescriptions for a woman in childbirth afflicted by pain is followed by an incantation against the pain of giving birth and a second one, of mythological nature, to be recited at the moment of birth as a magic aid.
Middle Assyrian Clay 11.5 x 7.6 x 1 cm
Mesopotamian pharmacopoeia, in all its nuances and complexities, is behind this important and rare text, given below in an updated translation; it may be defined as a scholarly compilation on medical matters, that perhaps came from the library of the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I (12th century BC). The tablet is a copy of previous or parallel exemplars (as clarified in the text itself on the Obverse, l. 32), and as such, presents some errors of scribal transmission. Although the overall subject is childbirth, this compilation consists of two different halves, and of unequal topic. On the Obverse in its entirety, and up to 1.6 (=ll. l-32) on the Reverse, we have a text of medical prescriptions for a woman in labor (alittum) afflicted with colic.
Obverse
(l )"When a pregnant woman has colic ...., her intestines are blocked, her water and blood turns.... . To bring about her release, you mix together fir-turpentine (kukru), juniper (burashu), ata'ishu-plant, sumlalu-spice, sweet reed, ballukku-spice, myrrh (murru), the odorous plant (?)-bushanu, resin of the abukkatu-plant, resin of the baluhhuplant, the root of the ata'ishu-plant, these 11 substances. Then you will put thorn fire in an earthenware jar, you will place these substances on the fire, she will sit over it, and you will rub her down with a woolen cloth. Then you will mix wormwood (sihu), the conifer resin-argannu, the bariratu-balm, watercress (sahlu), and beer bread (billatu) with pure olive oil and pure beer. You will make a compress and you will insert it into her vagina. You will perform this day and night and she will get better. (14) On the second day you will boil it ...., then take it away (from the fire), you will seat the woman over it, and you will rub her down with a woolen cloth. You will sprinkle beer on bitumen (?), And this bitumen (?) will enter her mouth and nostrils. You will anoint with sweet oil, and she will not have flatulence (sehu) and she will get better. (19) If she does not get better, you will fill a cauldron with water and beer, and you shall put in it together: cedar (erenu), cypress (surmenu), juniper drupacea (dapranu), fir turpentine, juniper-burashu, sumlalu-spice, ata'ishu-plant, wormwood, the conifer resin-argannu, the bariratu-balm, mustard (kasu), licorice seed (zer susi), you will boil these 11 substances, and pass them through a sieve. You will sponge her down, (then) get (the woman) up and anoint her with oil. You will bring her to an infirmary (? bit pagri) and she will have flatulence, but it will dissolve.
Reverse
(27) These are all the substances. You will mix the the bariratu-balm with fresh beer bread, you shall place (all) in a jar, you will shut it in the oven, then you will take it out and spread it on her with a woolen cloth. You will bandage her hypogastric regions (emsu) and her buttocks (suhhu) and her kidneys (rapa/tu) and she will be healthy again. (32) This tablet is all copied, but it is not (yet) finished.”
Instead, the rest of the Reverse has a spell for the pains of childbirth (= ll. 33-50), also with very effective images of the physical state and behaviour of a woman in the grip of severe pain (e.g., who no longer wears a veil, common for married women in this period): the mercy of Marduk himself is invoked. Then there is a second spell with a mythological slant: the story of the moon god Sin - whose symbol was the bull (cf. ch. 6b) - and a cow, their mating and the subsequent pregnancy. This myth, known from contemporary copies found at Assur, Nineveh, and in Anatolia, was recited at the time of the birth itself as a magical support for birth (= ll. 51-62).
(33) “The woman who gives birth has pain at delivery; at delivery she has pain, the child is stuck fast, the child is stuck fast: the bolt is fastened to end a life. The door is firmly closed, not letting the baby out...The mother is enveloped in the dust of death: like a chariot, she is enveloped in the dust of battle, like a plough, she is enveloped in dust of the w.oods
(40) Like a warrior in battle, she is cast down in her own blood. Her eyes are diminished, she cannot see; her lips are covered, she cannot open them. The signs of death and destinies (si-mat mu-te u si-ma-ta) become strong; her eyes, and her ... lives in constant fear. Her ears no longer hear, her breast is not longer high (?), her curls are scattered. She no longer wears a veil, she is no longer ashamed. O merciful Marduk, be present (?) and ...: 'This is the time of the battle: I am surrounded, join me!'. Bring forth what is sealed inside, creature of the gods, although a creature of man! That he can come out, that he may see the light!”

theme of order/disorder in the world (Machinist – Sasson 1983). It has a ‘happy ending’ when the angry god is placated and reenters the ranks of the gods in the pantheon. In the following passage, we find Erra announcing his evil intentions:
« [The life] of the just man, who acts as good intercessor, I will cut off. The evil man, who breaks off lives, I will raise to the highest posts?. The heart of mankind I will change, so that the father will not listen to his son, (And may) the daughter speak hatefully to her mother. I will make their speech evil and they will forget their god (And) against their goddess they will speak with great insolence. I will make the [th]ief rise up and I will block the road. In the city everyone will steal the goods of the others. The [li]on and the wolf will bring down the catt[le] of Sakkan. ... I will make (him) angry and he will put an end to childbirth. I will deprive the nurse of the shout of the baby and the child. I will subvert the (jubilant) cry of alala in the fields. Shepherd and watchman will forget the sheltering roof. I will tear off the clothes from the man’s body And I will make the youth go naked in the environs of the city » (Cagni 1969: 93, tav. III, ll. 7-20)
Poverty and wealth
The rich man and the pauper are ‘classic’ figures in the Middle Eastern human panorama, as we know also from their later appearance in the events narrated in the New Testament (as in the parable of
and private violence can no longer thrive. Gudea, Prince of Lagash, boasts of this perfect state of things at the time when a temple to the god Ningirsu is erected by the people:
« The ruler issued orders to the city, as to one single person, making the land of Lagash of one accord as if they were sons of the same mother. They took tools in hand, they weeded shrubs, raked the cut weeds together. (Gudea) barred (unnecessary) words and he sent crime back to its “home”. He undid the “tongue” of the whip and the goad and (instead) he laid the wool of ewes in the hands (of the overseers). No mother would have words with her child, and no child would disobey its mother. No master would hit (his) slave on the head when he had blundered, and no mistress would slap the face of a handmaid who had misbehaved towards her » (Edzard 1997: 76-77)
Lastly, a third concept regards peace as an element of the cosmos. This aspect, of a general cosmic order, which included the serene personal lives of the population, regularity in the conduction of assigned trades, fertility in both human beings and animals, constant respectful attention to the deities and their cults, is frequently expressed in precepts of wisdom to the good and just sovereign, or by paternal figures to their children. It also emerges, however, in quite spectacular and contrary manner, in the epic poem on the feats of the god Erra, composed in Babylonian, perhaps in the 1st millennium BC. This deity is described in the poem as ceaselessly engaged in creating and fomenting disorder, chaos and violence on every level of social life, with no respect for people or things. The scope of the text should have been a broad reflection in poetic form on the

parched have been anointed with oil, the needy have been covered with garments » (Fales – Lanfranchi 1992: 95)
For the people of Mesopotamia, poverty, obviously linked to annual weather conditions, decisive for the success or failure of the crops, was a punishment sent by the gods. This is clearly shown by several other texts issued by kings (Lion 1998) invoking divine clemency against poverty. On the other hand, since the late 3rd millennium BC the rulers had been attentive to the problem of ongoing impoverishment of relatively large sectors of the population (caused by famine, indebtedness, but also by the human losses deriving from war and disease, which left many families in dire poverty). This gave rise, especially in the Old Babylonian period, to the idea of the king as guarantor of justice and restorer of equity (shar kittim u misharim). The concept of justice was concretely expressed in provisions for amnesty, especially the cancellation of debts (except for mercantile ones), which caused the freedom for debtors who had been reduced to bondage, and the revision of sales contracts, with goods returned to their former owners on occasion. These measures taken by the sovereigns to improve the lives of the people as compared to the past were expected to last for all time, as Hammurabi explains in the epilogue to his Law Code: In the future, forever, let every King who shall exist in the country respect the words of justice that I have inscribed on my stele. Let him make no changes in the judgments that I have rendered in the country, nor the verdicts of the country that I have issued. (Charpin 2004: 310) The ‘poor’ have left many traces in Mesopotamian archaeological records from every period, in sets of pottery of great simplicity or terracotta figurines of plain workmanship (cap. 185, cap. 186, cap. 188). Such traces have received special attention in the last thirty years, when Middle Eastern archaeology began to focus not only on palaces and temples but also on rural villages and even nomadic encampments. The traces left by the ‘wealthy’, although fewer in number, are always clearly evident,
Lazarus the beggar and Epulon the rich man: Luke 16:19-31). A precise and effective portrait of the condition of poverty appears at the beginning of the Assyrian story known as The Poor Man of Nippur:
« There was a man of Nippur, poor and humble, Gimil-Ninurta was his name, a miserable man. In his city of Nippur wearily he sat. He had no silver, the pride of his people, he possessed no gold, the pride of mankind. His store-room thirsted for pure grain. With craving for bread his liver was oppressed, with craving for meat and beer his face was disfigured. Daily for lack of food he used to lie hungry. He was clad in garments for which he had no change » (Gurney 1956)
The tale of the Poor Man of Nippur continues in a humorous vein as a satire of social custom. Due to a naive act of Gimil-Ninurta, he is punished and robbed by the Mayor of Nippur, a man ostentatiously rich, arrogant and violent. But the poor man will obtain his revenge more than once, and just as violently, by utilizing the weapon – comically well thought out – of successive disguises. Thus, Gimil-Ninurta will appear before the hateful Mayor first pretending to be equally powerful in wealth or nobility – riding in a brandnew wagon lent him by the king – and then disguised as a scholar arriving from the temple of the goddess of medicine of the city Isin and therefore ranking high in professional status. The ‘moral’ of the story is that barriers between social classes exist and are insurmountable. A “leap upward” along the social ladder can be attained only by trickery, or by accepting the benevolence of kings. Exactly this benevolence is stressed by an exorcist at the Assyrian court, Adad-shumu-usur, in a letter heaping praise on the new king, Ashurbanipal (668-626 BC), not only as one blessed by the gods but also for his great works of social assistance:
« Those who were guilty and have been condemned to death, the King my lord has revived; those who had been imprisoned for many years, you have released; those who had been sick for many days, are now well. The hungry have been sated, those who were

Arrowheads with inscription
The inscription in Akkadian cuneiform mentions Nabû-mukin-apli, king of the Eighth Dynasty of Babylonia (978-943 BC).
ca. 950 BC Bronze 6.6 x 1.5 cm 8.2 x 1.6 cm
The inscription mentions a king of Babylonia, Nabu-mukin-apli (= 'Nabu established a legitimate heir'), who reigned for 36 years (978-943 B.C.), founding a new dynasty in the southern Mesopotamian region, more precisely the 8th dynasty of Babylon. The origins of Nabu-mukin-apli are obscure; from his titles, 'king of Babylonia' and 'king of totality' (as in the present texts) one may deduce his desire to place himself in the traditional line of kingship over the region.
The reign of Nabu-mukin-apli occurred in the middle of the so-called Babylonian "dark ages" and consequently the ancient sources concerning him are particularly scarce. The ruler is mentioned in the 'Eclectic Chronicle' (a tablet preserved in the British Museum; BM 27859), but without any historical information concerning him. The 'Religious Chronicle' provides most of the details about his kingdom: it appears to have been characterized by strong pressure from the semi-nomadic groups (Arameans), who managed to prevent the celebration of the New Year's Feast in the city of Babylon, and forced the king to establish his residence further to the south. The Akitu festival or New Year's Feast of Marduk and Nabu was interrupted several times and for a period of nine consecutive years because 'the Arameans were belligerent'. Moreover, during his reign, a tribe known as the Kaldu (later called Chaldeans) invaded southern Mesopotamia and settled there.
In light of a situation of strong political instability such as this, it is certainly interesting that the inscription of this Babylonian king is engraved on a specific type of weapons.

being found in specific grave goods or in particular residential structures, both private and public. Hence we have, for example, furnishings from royal palaces, with the name of a ruler or high official engraved on them as a ‘signature’ of ownership (cap. 195), or fragmentary ensembles of precious materials, such as ivory (cap. 171), which the Assyrian kings assembled in great numbers in their palaces (and especially at Nimrud, in the 9th-8th centuries). The question has nowadays been raised (Herrmann – Millard 2003; Reade 2004) as to the reasons behind these ancient collections, containing items of widely varying provenance (Egypt, the Levant, Iran). Did they indicate real preferences of aesthetic nature – as was long believed in the case of the finely carved ivories – or did they reflect, more basically, imperialist satisfaction in boundless possessions?

Fragment of decorated helmet
Front part of a bronze conical helmet in Assyrian style, with embossed and engraved decoratio.
Neo-Assyrian or Urartian Bronze 12 x 18 cm
Fragment of the front part of a conical bronze helmet in Assyrianizing style with a partially preserved brim (height 12 cm, width 18 cm.). The brim is made up of protruding horizontal lines or rings, delimiting at the bottom a band 2.3 cm high, occupied by six chiselled figures of bareheaded dignitaries armed with long swords, some of whom are bearded and others not, advancing toward the left.
In the upper zone, the right half of a scene, also chiselled, with larger figurative dimensions is preserved centered on a Tree of Life topped by a winged sun disk. To the right of the tree is the figure of a king with his right hand raised in reverence, followed by two bearded officers armed with swords; based on Assyrian and Assyrianizing parallels from Urartu, it may be assumed that the residual traces of a figure on the left of the tree also represented a king, symmetrical to the visible one.
To the right of the king and his attendants, and partly overhanging, a well-known 'serpent' decoration is partially preserved, with three raised ribbings that rise in parallel and then curve inward and downward. Only one of the three ribbings - the one to the left - has remained intact, ending in the head of an animal, probably a male sheep, with ornate neck fleece (in lines, dashes and dots). The serpents are surrounded by a line of dots made using a tool with a very thin tip.
Scenes of worship of the tree of life are also to be found on some Urartian helmets from Karmir-blur, dated, thanks to the inscriptions they bear, to the reign of Argishti I (780-756 BC ca.) and Sarduri II (764-735 BC ca.). This suggests that the motif must have been widely represented on Assyrian helmets: in point of fact, on the one hand, it constituted a theme that was often recurrent and extremely familiar to Neo-Assyrian figurative repertoire. On the other hand, the Urartian conical helmet was undoubtedly borrowed from the Assyrian world: not only in the shape of the helmet itself, but also in the figurative repertoire, albeit with its own stylistic renderings. The typological development of Assyrian helmets, once only found in depictions on bas-reliefs from the 9th century BC onwards, has now also found confirmation in a series of updated publications of specimens and fragments of archaeological origin. The decorative repertoire does not seem to have been very varied and complex, but limited to a set of stereotyped motifs.
The chronological positioning of the fragment obviously cannot make use of the crucial element which is the shape of the helmet. However, the stylistic aspects and some iconographic details lead to the conclusion that the fragment in question should be placed between the late 9th century and the early 8th century BC. Typologically, the winged sun above the tree of life appears very similar to specimens known from the stele of Ashurnasirpal II and the black obelisk of Shalmaneser III. Little can be gleaned from the clothing save that in the main it also indicates the 9th century, when placed in comparison with some depictions on tiles and ivory plaques found at Nimrud and assigned to this century by M.E.L. Mallowan. Further tending to confirm this dating, are the hairdo, swept back with a clearly oblique line, and the rich ornaments of the swords of all the depicted officials. Finally, the mace held by the king, whose figure on the left of the tree of life is only partially preserved, is also of the type that was used in the 9th century BC.

The decipherment of mesopotamian writing






that a queen named Shammu-ramat did indeed rule – and wisely – the state of Assyria on behalf of her son Adad-nirari III in the early 8th cent. BC. The legendary hanging gardens were, however, probably great parks overlooking the Tigris at Nineveh, laid out by her successors in the 7th century BC (Dalley 2013). But all of this information has come to light only very slowly, after centuries of work and study. As will be seen, by a strange twist of fate, the languages written in Mesopotamian cuneiform script were deciphered by explorers and linguists in inverse order to their antiquity. The first languages to be deciphered were the most recent, gradually followed by earlier ones: from Old Persian of the mid-first millennium BC to Babylonian of the previous two millennia, and then further back to Sumerian, the oldest language in the Land of the Twin Rivers (3rd millennium BC). To the contrary, amateurish attempts to decipher texts written in cuneiform – aided only by intuition – ended in resounding failure, as had happened with Egyptian hieroglyphs before Champollion’s decipherment of the Rosetta Stone. Thus, the first cuneiform monument to arrive in Europe (1786), the so-called Michaux stone – from the name of its discoverer, the botanist André Michaux, sent to the Near East by the French Government (fig. 45) – spurred the most fanciful interpretations, based on a presumed ‘army of the sky’. Today we know that this black basalt stele (called kudurru in Babylonian) merely records a father’s gift of farmland to his daughter as her dowry (ca. 11th cent. BC), with fascinating representations of the Mesopotamian gods appearing on the upper part.
Pietro Della Valle
The Roman polygraph Pietro Della Valle (1586-1652) was the first European to journey to Mesopotamia, as extension of a pilgrimage to the Holy Land that lasted twelve years (1614-26). Thanks to his knowledge of Turkish, Arab and Persian, he established contact with the local cultural milieu (fig. 46). He travelled to Babylon, where he admired the alleged Tower of Babel (fig. 47), and then to Persepolis, where he described the monumental inscriptions of the Persian kings ‘in unknown characters’ (that is, cuneiform). The information he collected was widely disseminated thanks to a publication in 4 volumes (The Travels of Pietro Della Valle, the Pilgrim) in epistolary form, which was translated into French, Dutch, German and English. ‘His observations and judgments were biased in many ways by the limited or non-existent knowledge of the time, but in their ardent commitment they laid the bases for the future development of Near Eastern archaeology’ (Invernizzi 2010, 58).

Frederick Mario Fales
After the cuneiform script and the Assyrian-Babylonian language fell definitively into oblivion, the rediscovery of Ancient Mesopotamia by the Western world took a long time, and became the exclusive privilege of the learned classes, especially from the 15th to the 19th century. Although Arab historians and geographers of the Middle Ages had not entirely forgotten the past of the Land of the Twin Rivers, they were little read in the West from the Renaissance onward. The numerous travels in Mesopotamia, thoroughly described by Jewish mystics searching for the tombs of the Patriarchs (such as Benjamin of Tudela, ca. 1168 A.D.), remained restricted to their own religious tradition. For the post-Renaissance Western World, the names of places and individuals were handed down mainly by the Bible and the Greek, Latin and Byzantine historians, in largely legendary terms. This is the case of the Garden of Eden and of the majestic cities of Nineveh and Babel (whose Tower was the subject of much speculation). Outstanding among the persons were Nebuchadnezzar II, who destroyed Jerusalem and deported its inhabitants (as recalled in Verdi’s opera Nabucco) and Semiramis, the queen fabled for her power, cruelty, and the ‘hanging gardens’ of Babylon attributed to her by Herodotus.

Signs Before the Alphabet
In 1835 Henry C. Rawlinson (1810-1895) was stationed in Persia as a representative of the British East India Company to the Shah of Iran (Fig. 51). Fascinated by cuneiform writing, he systematically copied, suspended 70 metres above the ground, the trilingual inscription of Darius I on the rocky wall of Bisutun. Starting from the results of Grotefend’s readings and armed also with information provided by Herodotus on the sequence and names of the Achaemenid rulers, Rawlinson published a first synthesis on Old Persian writing and edited the Bisutun text in 1847. He managed to identify the Persian cuneiform alphabet almost entirely. The decipherment of Old Persian was then used as the basis for understanding the other two languages appearing in the Bisutun inscription: Akkadian (and Babylonian in particular) and Elamite, an agglutinant language whose kinship to others is still uncertain today (Khačikjan 1998).
The discoveries of Layard and Botta in Assyria
The story of the nineteenth-century discovery of the great Assyrian capitals – and of the ensuing birth of historical and archaeological studies on the Ancient Near East – unfolded against a background of keen rivalry between Napoleon’s France and the British Empire for the territorial control of Mesopotamia, as a potential strategic ‘bridge’ to India, controlled by the British. In this context, a first representative of the East India Company, Claudius James Rich, was sent to Baghdad in 1808 to evaluate French relations with the local authorities. As a geographer by profession, Rich extensively explored first Babylon and then Nineveh, drawing the first reliable topographical map of the latter before dying of cholera in 1821 at the age 34. But the presence of Rich was only the start of a long Anglo-French ‘fencing match’ in Mesopotamia which, although conducted in civil terms, was to leave its mark on the following decades. In the first years of the 1840-50 decade, the young French Consul Paul-Emile Botta (Italian by birth and son of the historian Carlo Botta; fig. 52) and the even younger explorer Austen Henry Layard, an Englishman of Huguenot origin with a good cosmopolitan education who had escaped from the dull career of a London barrister, met in Mosul
1761, the expedition was decimated by disease, and Niebuhr remained the only survivor at Bombay, from where he started home journeying through the Near East. He visited Persepolis all alone, drawing the inscriptions that had been reported by Pietro Della Valle, and saw the rock inscription of Bisutun in 1763-64 (Fig. 49). In these texts he identified three different systems of cuneiform writing, all of which were to be read from left to right. Moreover, he suspected that the simplest writing system, using only forty signs – one of them merely indicating a separation between words – was a type of alphabetic script. He managed to reach Constantinople and then Europe only in 1767. Niebuhr’s discoveries served as basis for the work of the German philologist Georg Friedrich Grotefend (1775-1853), who effectively initiated the decipherment of Ancient Persian cuneiform script (fig. 50). After having studied philology at the University of Göttingen, he became Director of the Hannover lyceum in 1821. Grotefend chose two brief inscriptions copied by Niebuhr at Persepolis, which contained numerous sequences of identical signs, presuming that these were texts written by the Achaemenid kings (6th-4th cent. BC). He surmised that the first groups of signs stood for the names of kings, followed by a title, more or less long, and then by genealogical information. He thus was able to identify the sequences ‘NAME1, King, son of NAME2, King’. Through comparison with Greek sources and basing himself on the forms of the names as transcribed in the Iranian sacred texts of the Avesta (6th cent. A.D.), already well known to the philologists of his day, he managed to read the names of two ancient rulers. In addition, he identified a group of recurrent signs as the word for ‘king’, xashayathaiya (archaic form of the modern Persian shah); these signs appeared both isolated and in a stereotyped titulary. ‘Sovereign / King of Kings’. (I) Darius, the great king, King of Kings, ... son of Istaspe (II) Xerxes, the great king, King of Kings, son of Darius, the King. Grotefend’s readings are remarkably similar to those still adopted today for the Old Persian alphabet. But the decipherment of Old Persian took a great leap forward with the reading of the rock inscription of Bisutun, in today’s region of Kermanshah, carved on the face of a high mountain overlooking the royal road of the Achaemenid kings between Ecbatana and Babylon.

group of texts written in cuneiform script. his return to the Ottoman capital at Constantinople, the British ambassador Stratford Canning, informed of his journey, hired him as assistant. To Canning, Layard confided his dream of conducting excavations in Assyria. The British diplomat supported his initiatives, which also offered a chance to oppose French claims to Mesopotamia after Botta’s successful archaeological ventures. For Layard too, excavation at Kuyunjik was prohibited, but he tried his luck at a site further south on the Tigris, known as Nimrud. Here Layard, between 1845 and 1847, operating with the crude digging methods then available (that is, by perforating the tell using techniques similar to mining) replicated if not exceeded the success of his French colleague. This site too contained a vast royal city of the Assyrian Empire, abounding not only in monumental architecture and statuary but also in cuneiform inscriptions on stone and clay. Thus, within a very short time, two different Assyrian capitals were brought to light, which both of the excavators believed (mistakenly, as it turned out) to be the Biblical Nineveh. In the same year, 1847, the two teams tried to remove the monuments and other objects they had found, transporting them on barges to the mouth of the Tigris at Basra, where capacious ships brought them by sea to Europe for the glory of the French and English national museums, the Louvre and the British Museum. The ‘competition’ was won by the Louvre by several months, but in Britain the popularity of the discoveries was much greater, with enormous crowds flocking to see the monuments of an ancient empire brought to light by ‘their’ empire, that of Queen Victoria. Moreover, when Paris was caught up in a tumultuous revolution in 1848 and king Louis Philippe had to leave the throne (while his protégé Botta was relegated to the Consulate of Jerusalem), Layard was enjoying a well-merited success and writing Nineveh and Its Remains (1849). This richly illustrated work in two volumes was to become the first archaeological best-seller in history (being published a good 25 years before the Trojanische Altherthümer, Schliemann’s famous book on Troy!). In the meantime, Layard corresponded with Rawlinson, who was eagerly at work on the great mass of written documents coming from Nimrud, while his discoveries began to challenge the traditional British education, based on the literal acceptance of Scriptural teachings. In the meantime, the art historians were hotly disputing the aesthetic values of the sculptures as compared to the marbles from the Parthenon, brought to London in long-ago 1811. Layard returned to Mosul in 1849 with Hormuzd Rassam, a young Iranian Christian (of the ‘Assyrian’ faith) as his assistant. Here he concentrated on the site of Kuyunjik, having finally obtained Ottoman authorisation to excavate it, and brought to light the immense treasures of the ‘Palace without Rival’ of the Assyrian king Sennacherib. At the same time, his workers were making further discoveries at Nimrud, among them the temple of the Assyrian god Ninurta, which contained numerous cuneiform inscriptions. But quarrels with the British Museum over financing and a failed attempt to excavate in Babylonia finally dampened Layard’s enthusiasm for Near Eastern archaeology. In April 1851, at the age of only 34, the discoverer of Assyrian antiquity left Mesopotamia forever, to devote himself to a long, quarrelsome and disjointed political and diplomatic career (fig. 54) that was to bring him in the end to a serene old age in Venice (Fales – Hickey 1984).

(Fig. 55). Regardless of the policies of their governments they became good friends, sharing the belief that the great hills rising from the plain of Mosul were not of natural origin, but should conceal the remains of the region’s most ancient civilization, there where medieval Jewish travelers had sought the tombs of the Patriarchs. More specifically, the vast hill facing Mosul from the other side of the Tigris, known as Kuyunjik but also called Nuniya by the locals, promised to conceal the remains of the city of Nineveh, celebrated in the Bible and by the Classical authors as vast and powerful. The suspicious attitude of the Ottoman government authorities and of the local Pasha gave no easy promise of exploration. However, Botta attempted to excavate the site, but without results. His workers then told him of another vast mound (tell in Arabic) a few kilometers to the northeast, known as Khorsabad. Here the Frenchman was lucky; starting in 1844 he unearthed an Assyrian citadel filled with palaces and temples, with monumental statues, bas-reliefs in naturalistic and narrative style, and lastly a first

published his own translation – already announced – of the same text. The Society then asked both Hincks and Oppert to participate in this comparison of translations, bidding them to send their own versions of the same text in sealed envelopes. The envelopes were sent by the four scholars to the President of the scientific association, J. Wilson, who officially opened them on May 25, 1857. The four translations were read on the same day by a specially appointed committee, and, since they all agreed on the basic points, the committee declared itself fully satisfied with the results: Akkadian cuneiform script had been deciphered. From this moment on, the activity of reading and interpreting Assyrian and Babylonian texts that are the perquisite of the scientific discipline still nowadays called “Assyriology” entered a stage of frenetic activity.
The discovery and decipherment of Sumerian
While working on the tablets from Nineveh, Jules Oppert (fig. 56) realized that certain signs did not represent syllables, but whole words. He suspected that these ideograms had been created to reproduce a non-Semitic language even older than Akkadian. Through this intuition he opened the way to deciphering Sumerian, realizing that it was a monosyllabic agglutinative language with a sign for each noun, adjective or verb, as well as signs for various grammatical elements. Oppert thus laid the bases for understanding Sumerian in its principles of homophony (words pronounced more or less the same, but having different meanings) and polyphony/polysemy (the possibility that the same sign might have entirely different phonetic values and meanings). Subsequently he worked on Elamite, the second native language of Iran inscribed on the rock-face of Bisutun and on the monuments of Persepolis. The archaeological discovery of the Sumerians began in 1877, when E.
ical publication Punch (7 April 1855). The last chapter in the endless Anglo-French rivalry in Mesopotamia took place some years later (1852-55). Among numerous quarrels and recriminations over excavation rights, which also involved the local nomadic population, a new generation of archaeologists (the Consul Victor Place for the French, and Hormuzd Rassam for the British) resumed work, the former at Khorsabad, the latter at Kuyunjik. Under Rassam's direction, there emerged the first proofs that this tell was indeed the site of the one and only Nineveh. A final truce between the two teams led to a joint expedition of archaeological materials transported down the Tigris by a French ship in 1855. But by great misfortune the ship with its precious cargo of statuary, most of it destined to the Louvre (Larsen 1994), sank in the Shatt el-Arab after being attacked by rebellious tribes. After this tragedy, the French never again returned to excavating in Assyria, while the British did so only sparingly up to 1949, the year when excavations using modern methodologies began again at Nimrud under M.E.L. (‘Max’) Mallowan, accompanied by his wife, the writer Agatha Christie (Mallowan 1966).
Deciphering Babylonian cuneiform
In the years following Layard’s discoveries and his important contribution of texts to the British Museum, several scholars were independently trying to decipher Akkadian (or Assyrian-Babylonian) in cuneiform script, by patiently studying the several hundred syllabic signs of which it was made up. Outstanding among these scholars was Henry Rawlinson, a man of action and thought, possessing great linguistic talent and a profound knowledge of the Middle East, who had already deciphered Old Persian. Among the others were the Rev. Edward Hincks (1792-1866), pastor of the town of Killyleagh in Ireland and a brilliant linguist, who guessed that the Black Obelisk discovered by Layard mentioned the tribute to the Assyrians paid by Jehu of Israel, known to us from the Bible; the German (later naturalized Frenchman) Jules Oppert (1825-1905), who explored Assyria and Babylonia as a philologist in the years 1852-54, correctly identifying the ruins of Birs Nimrud with the ancient city of Borsippa; and lastly, the brilliant polygraph W. H. Fox Talbot (1800-77), an amateur but highly gifted linguist, known first for his invention of a method called calotype or talbotype, used to obtain several positive images from a single negative one, and later for his development of techniques that would lead to photogravure. In 1857, it was in fact Talbot who sent a sealed envelope containing his translation of an inscription by the Assyrian King Tiglath-pileser I (1113-1074), discovered by Rassam at Assur to the Royal Asiatic Society in London, requesting that it be opened only when H.C. Rawlinson had

knowledge of Sumerian. Finally, the German excavations at Uruk, carried out in the 1910s, although interrupted by the World Wars, yielded the most ancient tablets of all, dating from the end of the fourth millennium BC.
Twentieth-century decipherments: Hittite, Ugaritic, and the language of Ebla
While the most important languages written in cuneiform script had been deciphered by the end of the nineteenth century, the next century was to reserve new surprises of various kinds, pertaining to linguistic typology and to the use of cuneiform script for various purposes. The first case is that of the Hittite language. While the vast site of Boğazköy in central-northern Anatolia – later recognized as the seat of the Hittite capital Hattusa – had been identified since the first decades of the nineteenth century, it was only in 1906, with the start of systematic excavations by Hugo Winckler, that a wealth of cuneiform tablets from the 2nd millennium BC began to emerge. Although the signs on the clay tablets of Boğazköy were easy to read, their interpretation immediately appeared arduous, since the language they expressed differed sharply from Akkadian and Sumerian. And even more important, the philologists of the time were not culturally prepared to accept the idea that they these signs might express an Indo-European language. It was only in 1915 that the Czech philologist Bedrich Hrozný, attracted almost by chance to the texts, applied to them the comparative method used in linguistic studies on Indo-European languages, and began to understand their meaning. His work, first greeted with skepticism in the field of Middle Eastern studies, gradually came to be fully accepted. The new Indo-European language revealed by the Boğazköy tablets was given the name Hittite, based on the mention of a people called Hittim in the Bible and on the ‘land of Hatti’ cited in Assyrian texts, although the Hittites themselves used a term linked to this etymology (hattili) to indicate the language and culture of the indigenous people of Anatolia who had preceded them (“Hattic”). From the very first texts deciphered, the comparative/historical classification
de Sarzec, vice-consul of France at Basra, decided to explore the site of Telloh, the ancient Lagash/Girsu, unearthing tens of thousands of inscribed tablets and other objects. Some of these were sent to the Louvre (for example, many statues in the round, with epigraphs of the local ruler Gudea). In these inscriptions, the epigraphists recognized the non-Semitic language that they had begun to decipher starting from the bilingual texts of Nineveh. But the documents coming from southern Iraq were much older than those known at the time. Dating from the 3rd millennium BC, they were written exclusively in Sumerian. The different stages of this language represented at Telloh allowed to establish the evolution of the signs and their notation. At the close of the nineteenth century, A. Amiaud and E. Schrader produced copies, transcriptions and translations of Sumerian royal inscriptions. In 1905, F. Thureau-Dangin continued this work in his book Les inscriptions de Sumer et d’Akkad. To distinguish the different homophonic signs of Sumerian, he developed a system of numeration for the signs, with progressive numerical indices (for example, du, du2, du3, du4, etc.) that are still used today. Throughout the twentieth century, the increase of archaeological campaigns in southern Iraq added to the number of texts available, allowing linguists to perfect their

b, g, d...). One tablet, however, lists the same signs in a different order, which is that of the ancient South Arabian language – demonstrating in this way the vastness and variety of Ugarit’s economic and cultural relationships with the entire Levant, as well as with Mesopotamia. The most recent case concerns the language of Ebla. In 1975 an archaeological expedition from the University of Rome headed by P. Matthiae, which had been operating since 1964 at Tell Mardikh, a vast site in northwestern Syria, unearthed a well-conserved archive of some 20,000 cuneiform tablets (see below). All of these texts (administrative, literary and historical) seemed to have been compiled in Sumerian, perhaps taught to the local people by scribes coming from the South-Mesopotamian city of Kish. More detailed study, however, has shown that they were most likely read and recited in the Semitic language of the place (Eblaic), a distant cousin of ancient Akkadian and its contemporary (cf. Rubio 2006). The publication of a bilingual Sumerian-Eblaic vocabulary, with each term matched word for word, reinforced this complex linguistic scenario of so-called ‘alloglottography’, as e.g. paralleled in documents from the Japanese Nara period (700-800 AD) written in Chinese characters but to be read aloud in Japanese. Other sites in Syria, where Sumerian cuneiform script had been exported during this same period, but which utilized a local Semitic language close to Akkadian for reading, were Tell Beydar, the ancient Nabada, on the Syrian steppe, and Tell Hariri, the ancient Mari on the Middle Euphrates. In practice, as has been said (Rubio 2016) Sumerian was the ‘writing catalyst’ for establishing the most ancient literature of this Semitic cultural horizon in Syria.
Is there anything left to be discovered and deciphered?
With nearly a million tablets coming from every part of the Near East, discovered in over a century and a half of excavations in the field or purchased on the antiquities market, we might be tempted to think that most of the work of deciphering the many languages recorded in cuneiform script is now behind us; and this is quite probable, although unexpected discoveries such as that of Ebla might happen at any moment. Moreover, the museums of different countries are still full of tablets yet to be examined or definitively evaluated, which may have further surprises in store for us, of unforeseeable linguistic and philological impact. In this sense a ‘mixed’ case, of recent date, consists of the tablets in Assyrian cuneiform with epigraphs added in Aramaic alphabetical characters, which had already been brought to light by Layard, who however believed them to be ‘Phoenician’ writings. Subjected to rereading and updated interpretation by the museums that possess them (Fales 1986), these bilingual and bi-grapheme texts have greatly increased in quantity, thanks to archives discovered at various archaeological sites of modern Syria in the last thirty years (Lemaire 2001; Fales et al. 2005; Röllig 2014). In any case, there still remain many gaps in our knowledge of the languages compiled in cuneiform. Especially notable are the cases of Amorite and Kassite. Amorite is a West Semitic language which, at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BC, was certainly spoken by the populations of ancient nomadic origin that assumed political control of Mesopotamia. Their coming to power coincided with their ‘Babylonization’, that is, the adoption of Akkadian as their main vehicle of communication. The language of the Amorites has thus survived in the vast
of Hittite – dating from much earlier than the basic Indo-European languages then known, Greek and Sanskrit was, and to some extent remains, the subject of heated debate. At present, three stages of the language are recognized, dating from around 1600 to 1200 BC: Old Hittite (up to about 1450), Middle Hittite (up to about 1320) and New Hittite (up to 1190 BC, when Hattusa was abandoned and the imperial bureaucracy ceased to function). The texts from the Hittite archives, numbering about 30,000 today, display a wide array of types, comprising historical, diplomatic, administrative, juridical, lexical, literary, and mythological documents as well as cultural and religious materials in general. The new archaeological discoveries that have been made for a century now at Hattusa and other political seats of the Hittite Kingdom (then Empire) have added to the quantity year after year, so that Hittitology has now been recognized in many countries as an autonomous scientific and teaching discipline (de Martino 2010). An equally interesting case – though on a smaller scale – is that of Ugaritic. The site of Ras Shamra, on the Mediterranean coast of today’s Syria, was excavated by French archaeologists starting in 1929 and investigated practically uninterruptedly up to 2010. This site, the seat of a city-state with the ancient name of Ugarit, rich in palaces, temples and private residences built of stone, has yielded thousands of cuneiform tablets dating from the 13th century BC, the last century before the city was violently and totally destroyed by raiders arriving by sea (the so-called Sea Peoples). About half the texts found at Ugarit are written in syllabic Akkadian. Other tablets, however, are unusual in having only thirty or so cuneiform signs, very simple in form and quite different from the Akkadian syllabary (fig. 57). They have been identified since 1930 as alphabetical signs, each of which represents a consonant. These signs refer to a local Western Semitic language, which we call Ugaritic (cf. Bordreul – Pardee 2009). At Ugarit, the juridical tablets and texts of international correspondence were written in Akkadian, while the scribes restricted the use of the alphabet and the Ugaritic language to particular types of documents: accounting and administrative texts, local correspondence, religious texts, and lastly the myths and legends of Ugarit itself, such as poems dedicated to the god Baal. Ugaritic alphabetical writing is read from left to right like the other cuneiform texts, with few exceptions –perhaps to be dated during the city’s final stage of life – of a ductus from right to left. A dozen or so tablets are inscribed with ‘abecedaries’, that is, lists of the signs in a fixed order, coinciding almost entirely with what is found in the Phoenician and Hebrew alphabets of some centuries later, which was inherited by the Greeks from the Phoenicians (ʼ,

number of grammatical elements that may be deduced from the personal names of this period (for example, ‘Hammurabi’ was an Amorite name; cf. Gelb 1958) and to a minimum degree, from some isolated Amorite words emerging here and there in the Babylonian texts (most notably in the correspondence of the royal archives of Mari, ca. 1800 BC), which find parallels in later archives (such as the cuneiform and alphabetical texts from Ugarit). The patient search for these words is still in progress, and in this field the future will undoubtedly yield new knowledge. As for Kassite, the original language of a population coming from the Zagros Mountains that conquered Babylonia in the late 16th cent. BC and that then – as in the case of the Amorites – fully absorbed the culture of their new political seat, where they remained up to the 12th century, its kinship is still uncertain. Cuneiform documentation of Kassite is extremely rare. What survives is only a fragmentary bilingual vocabulary (Kassite-Babylonian), with 48 main entries, some lexical entries handed down in Babylonian scribal texts, and a series of names of persons whose significance is at times obscure (Ancilotti 1980). In this case too, any future discoveries of texts made during archaeological excavations, or resulting from the in-depth study of materials in museums, could provide more knowledge of this language, which remains barely above the ‘dead language’ threshold today.

taken Armanum and Ebla ... the god Nergal opened the road to Naram-Sin, the strong, and gave him Armanum and Ebla: he also offered him also the Amanus, the Cedar Mountain, and the Upper Sea. Thanks to the weapon of the god Dagan, that exalts his kingship, Naram-Sin, the powerful one, conquered Armanum and Ebla, and from the bank of the Euphrates up to Ulisum struck down the populations that Dagan delivered into his hands and they carried the breadbasket of Aba, his god, and he wielded dominion over the Amanus and the Cedar Mountain”. The excavations were expanded in 1974, while keeping other sectors of the excavation open. But it was in 1975, after the discovery of the first cuneiform tablets, that the decision was taken to suspend research activities in all the other areas of excavation in order to concentrate the maximum operational effort on the re-emerging structures of what promised to be a discovery of particular importance, since the walls, protected by the slopes of the Old Syrian Citadel and immune to significant overlays later on, appeared to be more than 7 meters high. The 1975 campaign at Tell Mardikh, which would remain in the history of Near Eastern Archaeology, soon led to the discovery, in early September, on the southern side of the corner tower of the Audience Hall, of the so-called Small Archive L.2712, where various hundreds of tablets with cuneiform script, which had fallen to the floor at the time of the destruction of the city from two shelves inserted into the two adjacent walls of the small room, were brought to light along with the discovery of the Monumental Portal, which clearly appeared as the entrance to the palatial complex. Since the Small Archive, located at the northern end of the east side of the Audience Hall, stood a few meters northwards of that imposing entrance, the excavation strategy imposed on us to advance with the excavation southwards – also for the presence of rare tablets scattered about that did not seem to have come from the newly-discovered archive – in order to verify the possible presence of a second archival room symmetrically located with respect to the first Monumental Portal. In the second half of September, even the most optimistic hopes were surpassed by the identification, actually to the south of the Monumental Portal, of a second room larger than the first one, with outer walls preserved, despite their thinness, to a height of 2 meters, and which was none other than the so-called Great Archive L.2769. After a few days, by deepening the excavation along the northern and eastern walls of the room, the tops of piles of large tablets that looked driven into ground came to the surface, at a remarkable height with respect to the ground level of the already known Audience Hall. The appearance of that which, almost like an unreal mirage, has remained in our memory as a sea of tablets in soil dense with the debris and ashes of the terrible fire that ended the life of the mature High Early Syrian towns, made everyone understand that this was the beginning of an epochal discovery. At the end of an exciting campaign, more than 15,500 inventory numbers of written documents and fragments of documents were the treasure that had been collected in two weeks
The discovery of the Royal Archives of Ebla
Paolo Matthiae
Professor of Archaeology and History of Art of the Ancient Near East in the University of Rome
In the early seventies of the last century, there was the curious certainty among scholars that it would be impossible to write a history of Syria in the third millennium BC - in the sense of the events, but also the culture - for one simple and, at that time, incontrovertible reason: that region, the traditional bridge between Mesopotamia and the Mediterranean, knew no writing in those centuries and so one would never be able to count on original written sources. Exactly in those years Europe's greatest Assyriologist, Wolfram von Soden, became an authoritative spokesman for that widespread opinion: there were no hopes of revealing military and political events, economic and social structures, institutional realities, religious beliefs, and ideological attitudes of those centuries crucial for the final formation of the urban civilization of both Syria and Anatolia, of the western and northern outskirts of the regions of Southern Mesopotamia that, with the creation of the first cities in the second half of the fourth millennium BC, in the same decades as Egypt, had pursued the great phenomenon of the first urbanization in human history. That pessimistic and bleak prediction began to be disproved first by a discovery of 42 cuneiform tablets, made in the summer of 1974 at Tell Mardikh, about 60 km south of Aleppo, by the Italian Archaeological Mission in Syria of the Sapienza University of Rome when it was expanding a survey opened the previous year during the briefest of the excavations at Tell Mardikh, due to the Mission's concurrent involvement on a smaller site in the Euphrates valley, Tell Fray, recognized by UNESCO, so as to participate in the international rescue campaign of archaeological sites threatened by the construction of the large Tabqa Dam on the Euphrates. The survey opened on the slopes of the Acropolis of that vast archaeological site in inner western Syria, practically unknown until the beginning of the Italian excavations, where Sapienza University's Mission had begun to operate back in 1964, allowed us to reach, just a few centimeters below the surface, the summit of what proved to be the high and massive corner tower of the large Audience Hall of the Royal Palace of the Early Syrian town in the 24th century BC, a monumental center of the Administrative District of the large palatial complex. In fact, after the identification in 1968 – following the discovery of the basaltic bust of Ibbit-Lim king of Ebla – of Tell Mardikh with the ancient city of Ebla, mentioned in the triumphal Akkadian inscriptions by Sargon and Naram-Sin of Akkad, in the Sumerian building inscriptions by Gudea of Lagash, in the lists of Egyptian conquests by Thutmis III, and in fragmentary Hittite inscriptions by Hattusili I or Mursili I, the Italian Mission undertook a number of attempts to reach the most ancient levels of the urban settlement that flourished approximately from at least the mid-3rd millennium to the mid-2nd millennium BC. The survey in 1973 unexpectedly led to the discovery of important rooms, in an excellent state of preservation, of that powerful city of Syria, the conquest of which Naram-Sin of Akkad had celebrated as an extraordinary event: “Ever since the foundation of humanity, no king among kings had

tion of those tablets could be reconstructed the Syro-Mesopotamiatogether with the structure and, above all, the physical organization of the Great Archives, which must have housed no fewer than 4,000 documents. On the epigraphic level, it was quite clear from the early days of the discovery that what had been found was not the archive of a somewhat large administrative or palatial structure, or temple, as had often happened since the mid-nineteenth century, but rather the Central State Archive of an important kingdom in a crucial age in the history of the Syro-Mesopotamian area, significantly called Proto-Imperial, insofar as it existed right on the threshold of the formation of the Empire of Akkad by the great Sargon. Starting with the earliest years of studies on the unexpected discovery made hundreds of kilometers from the heart of the land of Sumer, it was possible to undertake an initial preliminary reading of all the texts and so to identify the nature of the documents preserved in the Royal Archives of Ebla. Thus it was possible to ascertain that a very large majority of them obviously regarded economic and administrative accounting, for not less than 90% of the total, but that a considerable number, equal to several dozens of tablets, often in excellent condition, were of a lexical nature and that some of these various lists were bilingual, in Sumerian and Eblaic - the oldest bilingual dictionaries of the history of humanity - and, finally, that a few tablets were literary texts, hymns, and above all, incantations. In the international political situation, and particularly, the regional one, which was very difficult at the time, a fiery controversy had raged for several months, especially in the United States of America and to a lesser extent in Europe, concerning alleged and totally false difficulties posed by the cultural authorities of the Syrian Arab Republic regarding the publication of the tablets for alleged and non-existent relationships with the Biblical texts of the Old Testament. These controversies – for a full and transparent explanation of the real situation of the studies on the immense epigraphic treasure of Ebla–, were ended in 1977 by the very authorities in Damascus on the one hand, with the repeated affirmation of full rights to complete publication of the texts of the Royal Archives to be carried out by the Expedition of the Sapienza University of Rome, as the protagonist of the discovery, and on the other, with the appointment of an International Committee of major philologists from different countries worldwide that, as an entity independent from the Expedition, would guarantee the full autonomy and the progressive development of research on the tablets –which would clearly take several decades for a complete and comprehensive scientific publication, as had happened for other major discoveries of cuneiform archives in the twentieth century. While hundreds of articles with partial publication of the texts from the Archive and a growing number of studies on the many diverse historical and linguistic problems arising from the discovery in Ebla have appeared in major international scientific journals, the official series of text editions by the Sapienza University of Rome - “Royal Archives of Ebla. Texts,” alongside the series “Royal Archives of Ebla.
of uninterrupted exhausting recoveries, day and night, so that nothing of what the destroyers of the Royal Palace, after relentless looting, had left under the rubble of the burned complex would be lost. Before returning to Damascus, there were 99 boxes of tablets lined up in the courtyard of the Expeditions's house before embarking on the trip to deliver the spectacular finds to the Archaeological Museum of Aleppo. In 1976, using the same strategy followed in 1975, the concentration of the excavations in the eastern side of the Audience Hall led to both the completion of the excavation of the larger archival room, L.2769, and the vestibule, L.2875, which was also the entrance to the Administrative District, and to the discovery of the Trapezoidal Archive L.2764, located inside the District itself. The discovery of cuneiform tablets in the as yet unexcavated limited southern sector of the Great Archive L. 2769, in the vestibule L.2875 that must have also had a function as a scriptorium, in the Trapezoidal Archives L.2764, and also in the Audience Hall in front of the Monumental Portal, meant that about 1,500 other inventory numbers were added to the extraordinary spoils of these epigraphic discoveries. In the following years, new epigraphic discoveries were sporadically made, in both the Southern District south of the Administrative District, and in some small rooms arranged against the eastern wall of the Throne Room L.2866, which brought the total amount of tablets recovered to around 17,050 inventory numbers. On the basis of the complex and prolonged work of recomposition of the tablets damaged by the destruction and subsequent collapse of the structures of the Audience Hall and the Administrative District, which was continued in the museums of Aleppo and Idlib in all the subsequent campaigns of excavation and restoration until 2010 by the Expedition's philologists and restorers, it has been possible to reconstruct that originally, at the time of the destruction of the Royal Palace G, the tablets in the Royal Archives must have been an indeterminable number, between about 4,000 and 5,000 written documents. At the time of the discovery, the tablets found intact or with very limited peripheral chipping numbered just under 2,000. All the other inventory numbers are related to large fragments, even with many columns and lines of writing, amounting to 5,000/6,000 pieces, while the remaining inventory numbers concern minor fragments or superficial flakes with a few traces of lines of writing. If one considers that the total amount of cuneiform tablets relating to the period of the Akkad Dynasty, immediately following the destruction of the Royal Palace of Ebla and regarding more than 125 years, of very disparate provenance from the many sites in the countries of Sumer and Akkad, is considered to be about 5,000 documents, one may get an idea of the extraordinary importance of the discovery of the Royal Archives of Ebla. The value of the discovery of the Ebla Archives is all the more remarkable, on the archaeological level, because the situation of recovery the tablets in the various rooms was such that, for the first time in the history of the discoveries of n archives in the Syro-Mesopotamian world, the original systems of preserva

ries and finally venturing on a complex military operation against the powerful city Mari which controlled access to the countries of Akkad and Sumer. This expedition ended in a major victory after a pitched battle near Terqa, but there was no conquest of the large city on the Euphrates and, a few years later, despite an impressive network of dynastic marriages that placed it at the center of a vast network of diplomatic relations, Ebla fell and suffered a total devastation. presumably in the years of the full affirmation on the political scene of the great Sargon of Akkad, who was most likely, directly or indirectly, the author of that conquest. In those years, Ebla had a very broad extension of political and diplomatic relations, from Afghanistan to Egypt, as evidenced first by the 42 kilos of raw lapis lazuli which came from the remote mountains of Badakshan, discovered among the treasures in the Royal Palace which had escaped looters, and secondly, by the precious vases of alabaster and clear diorite of Egyptian production, two of which bore hieroglyphic titles: one of Chephren, the famous builder of the second pyramid of Giza who lived a little less than two hundred years before Ishar-Damu, and the other of Pepi I, the third Pharaoh of the 6th Dynasty of Egypt, who was certainly a contemporary of Sargon of Akkad and Ishar-Damu of Ebla. These precious gifts sent by the great Pharaohs of the Old Kingdom, even many years before the apogee of Ebla's political power shortly before its eclipse, indicate that even several dozens of years before, the city had been powerful and feared: and further important evidence of the antiquity of Ebla's power, its continuity, and its institutional and political traditions is provided by the presence of a King List of Ebla with more than twenty predecessors of Igrish-Khalab, found among the texts of the Archives. The discovery of the Royal Archives of Ebla, which occurred during the eleventh and twelfth excavation campaigns out of the 47 conducted continuously by the Expedition of Sapienza University of Rome from 1964 to 2010 on the large site in Western Syria, was certainly an event of exceptional archaeological and historical importance that deeply renewed and enriched knowledge of the history of archaic urbanization in the 3rd millennium BC in Western Asia, and created a great impression even beyond scientific circles throughout the world. The potential impact of the discovery of Ebla on the interpretation of centuries that were crucial especially for the economy and society of the ancient East in the 3rd millennium BC was clear to the greatest scholars of those years. Already in 1977, Igor M. Diakonoff, the undisputed Master of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, who had the first studies on the Ebla discoveries immediately translated into Russian, stated that the discovery had brought an extraordinary revolution of knowledge, and in the same months, Ignace J. Gelb, the dean of Assyriological Studies at the Oriental Institute of Chicago, declared that "at Ebla, the Italians had discovered a new language, a new culture, and a new history”.

Studies”- saw the light with the publication of approximately twenty volumes to date, accompanied by an extensive photographic and graphic documentation, in which all the texts were repeatedly collated with the originals. The intense progress of publications of texts and sectoral studies has brought to light, on the one hand, the initially unsuspected wealth of information of all kinds - historical, social, institutional, religious - beyond the purely accounting and economic aspects contained in the administrative documents. On the other hand, the extraordinary lexical treasure, both Semitic and Sumerian, of the bilingual lexical lists – with about 1,500 entries in both languages, often not easy to interpret - opened up broad discussion and a critical evaluation of the historical position of Eblaic within the oldest documented Semitic languages, and also on the reconstruction of the prehistory and history of those Semitic languages in the 3rd millennium BC. The initial pioneering readings, the various publications of texts that had almost always not been collated, and the many historical and linguistic interpretations, often exceedingly bold and sometimes decidely adventurous, by Giovanni Pettinato, the Expedition's first epigraphist, and the powerful and accurate publishing work and study of hundreds of texts by Alfonso Archi, by Maria Giovanna Biga, and, especially for the chancellery texts and the interpretations of the Eblaix language by Pelio Fronzaroli, have made an increasing number of the vast complex of texts of the Royal Archives of Ebla, which is now a sector of primary importance, in all respects, of Sumerology, Assyriiology, and Semitic studies, available to the international scientific community. Although, as mentioned, a large majority of the texts of the Ebla Archives are economic in nature, the numerous detailed studies by the Expedtion's epigraphists have recently brought to light that they also contain a great deal of information concerning political, diplomatic, and military events, religious and institutional ceremonies, the most various episodes of social and economic life from weddings to travel, up to festivals, which allow us to reconstruct in detail not only the sophisticated mechanisms of a centralized administration spread over a wide area of inner western Syria, from the Taurus Mountains in the north to the region of Homs in the south, but also many aspects of the political history of a period less than fifty years during the reigns of three kings of Ebla. Athough the Royal Archives include mostly documents of the last two or three decades, they regard the times of the kings Igrish-Khalab, Irkab-Damu, and of Ishar-Damu, who must have been the last ambitious but unlucky king to reign with the invaluable and highly efficient collaboration of two viziers, Ibrium and Ibbi-Zikir, and who must have witnessed the conquest, the plunder, and the destruction of the city probably in the years immediately following 2350/2340 BC Just before that tragic event, Ishar-Damu, under the guidance of Ibbi-Zikir and with the alliance of Nagar in Upper Mesopotamia and Kish in Lower Mesopotamia, had launched an impressive series of military campaigns, first in the Euphrates region to the north, then to the south in central Syria, conquering ample territo

Idols
“Eye idols”, typical of the site of Tell Brak (ancient Nagar, in the Upper Khabur region, in northeastern Syria). These artifacts were found in large quantities in the so-called "Eye Temple" by British archaeologist Max Mallowan. The specimens with holes for the eyes (dated to the Late Uruk period) were perhaps used for weaving. Idols with engraved eyes (of the Middle Uruk period) were probably votive offerings.
