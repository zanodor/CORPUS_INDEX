[quote] Mohenjo-Daro (Fig. 7.1) was primarily comprised of brick platforms topped by fired-brick structures and traces of enclosure walls. The highest mound (Fig. 7.2), which is often referred to as the Mound ofthe Great Bath, was the locus of a number of unusual buildings that Wright (2010, 117–22) has referred to asnon-residential structures. These include the so-called ‘Great Bath’, the ‘Granary’/‘Great Hall’, the ‘College of Priests’, the ‘Assembly Hall’/‘Pillared Hall’, and a structure traditionally described as a Buddhist stupathat has long been presumed to date to the Early Historic period (Possehl 2002). The ‘Granary’/‘Great Hall’ at Mohenjo-Daro is often compared to the similarly named structure at Harappa, though the architecture of each is distinct (e.g. Wheeler 1968, 33–5, 43–4; seeFig. 7.3). A mud-brick forti cation or enclosure wall with at least one gateway surrounded at least part ofthis mound (Fig. 7.2; Wheeler 1968, 40, Pl. VIb, VII,VIIIa–b; Alcock 1986, 500–1). Many of the apparentlynon-residential buildings on the high mound may have been public and/or elite structures (e.g. Kenoyer 1998, 62–5, 100; Possehl 2002, 193), though it is notable that several contained evidence for craft activities in later phases, including lapidary, shell and leather working (Marshall 1931; Possehl 2002; Vidale 2010, 62). – contd.

--contd. There has been a speculative reassessment of the so-called Buddhist stupa and associated monastery on the highest mound at Mohenjo-Daro that suggests evidence for Indus religious architecture may not be as elusive as previously thought. The placement and layout of these structures align with the neighbouring Indus period structures, and a reassessment of their architecture, construction techniques, and associated finds has indicated they may be the remains of substantial Indus period structures that stood at the highest and most visible part of the city (Verardi 1987; Verardi & Barba 2010, 2013; also Wright 2010; Petrie 2013). Other structures are likely to underlie this building (e.g. Kenoyer 1998, 62; though see Possehl 2002, 149),indicating earlier phases of construction. The precisefunction of this building remains unclear, but Verardi& Barba (2010, 2013) have suggested that it may have been a sacred building with repositories containingdiscarded votive offerings. The close proximity of the non-‘stupa’ to the Great Bath and the ‘Granary’/‘GreatHall’ suggests that the northern end of this mound may have been topped by a cluster of important buildings.These buildings appear to have included two structures related to ritual activities, separated by what may have been an elite residence (College of Priests) and flanked by some type of Great Hall. The degree to which any of these ostensibly non-residential structures were public or had access to them was restricted, however, remains unknown. [unquote]

"Remarkable as it may seem, the [700 estimated] well locations at Mohenjo-daro seem to have been laid out when the original platforms were built and were maintained over the history of the city with almost no changes. Some were abandoned, but we know of no wells newly sited and constructed after the initial platform building," writes Dr. Gregory Possehl, which he sees as supporting the contention of another archaeologist, Dr. Michael Jansen, that the wells locations throughout the city were planned from the beginning. "Wells are lined for two reasons. First the bricks support the earth and guard against cave-ins and erosion, especially of the well opening. Brick-lined wells also deliver clean, sweet water with a minimum of silt and other large particlecontaminants.. Properly dug and maintained brick-lined wells can deliver perfectly clear water, even on a river floodplain." He continues: "The area served by each well and the mean distance between wells is remarkably consistent in the Lower Town; another reflection of the planning that went into Mohenjo-daro from the very beginning. A few wells were abandoned during the life of the city. [Excavator Ernest] Mackay suggests that this took place because someone jumped into
them." (Gregory Possehl, The Indus Civilization: A Contemporary Perspective, p. 101).

A rarely seen image of deep diggings at Mohenjo-daro in 1950 gives some sense of the density of urban construction in the city. This is in the citadel area, with the so-called Great Granary or large hall in the background, "gradually engulfed by a clutter of later Indus buildings," although we do not know the stratigraphic relationship between these buildings and the large hall. This is close to the Great Bath, off-screen to the left. The two circular structures are wells.

meters square (90 feet square) with twenty
square brick pillars arranged in four rows, only
two of which are still preserved. Strips of paved
floors sloped from south to north and each strip

both sides. The cross wall in the foreground was built later and divided the hall into smaller rooms.

[quote]]What was this enormous building in Mohenjo-daro used for? "The northern portion of Block 4 (Image 1)," in the L Area wrote the archaeologist John Marshall, "was originally a large hall of the Intermediate Period which appears to have been entirely covered ink the roof being supported by twenty rectangular piers averaging 5 feet by 3 ft. 4 in. in thickness. Owing to alterations which were made later, not all these piers can be now traced, but we have undoubted evidence that originally there were five piers in each row; two rows n the western side of the hall are intact. The two eastern rows are not so well preserved, but traces of the two piers still remain in the row on the extreme east, which are slightly thinner in the E._w. direction i.e. 3 fee thick instead of 3 ft. 6 in. The distances between the piers in the same row average 9 ft. 7 in., the variation never exceeding 3 inches. This remarkable accuracy was not observed in the spacing of the rows; for the three western aisles vary in width from 14 ft. 2 in. to 15 feet, where the two easternmost rows are 13 ft. 6 in. apart. This lay-out is, on the whole, very satisfactory, and argues great proficiency on the part of the masons. Gypsum as well as mud-mortar was used in erecting these columns, as elsewhere in the building. The bricks were laid out in alternate headers and stretchers, closers being used to break the perpends where required. The masonry, however, does not show the same skill as the lay-out, the joints between bricks varying considerably (4). The sizes of the bricks used were: –11 by 2.25 by 5.5 inches; 11.25 by 2.25 by 5.5 inches; 10.74 by 2.5 by 5.4 inches. The bricks used in the later portions measure 10 by 2.75 by 5 inches and 11 by 2.5 by 5.5 inches. "Each row of piers rests on a footing, or continuous foundation wall, running N._S. which averages 1 ft. 2 in. high, and projects 6 inches beyond the eastern and western faces of the piers (3). The footing has only been examined beneath the northernmost piers, for to lay the foundations bare as far as the southern end of the hall would necessitate destroying the pavements between the piers, to be described later. – contd.

--contd. "The foundation walls are very roughly built, each course projecting slightly beyond the course below; and the courses themselves are irregular and undulate considerably, owing to the fact that the ground was not properly leveled before they were laid. Their number also varies with the inequalities of the ground. "The best preserved piers are those on the western side of the hall. Owing to weathering, the remains of the piers become shorter and shorter, the farther they are to the east, until the tops of two surviving columns in the easternmost row have almost disappeared. "During the late period, this pillared hall was partitioned off in places by building walls between the piers (45). The columns to the east of the aisle marked 24 were linked together by two facing walls, each one brick (i.e. 11 inches) thick, the space between which was filled with broken brick and general debris; and the eastern of these two wall-faces was buttressed to strengthen it. Though the outer surfaces are good, the inner surface of each wall is very rough. No mortar was used to bind the filling. The hall was also partitioned at the south by a wall of the late Period, 2 feet wide, with a doorway 3 ft. 2 in. wide at the eastern end. The eastern jamb of this doorway was rebated, presumably to take a wooden door. The sill is well-preserved and the western jamb is 13 inches high."
