Items of Mesopotamian clothing
4-5 minutes
The flared hat (headdress):
Early Dynasty banquet scene. Enlarge.
On the right, two lords simultaneously drink beer through long straws
from a communal pot, while one of them passes an absurdly large fish to
the other, presumably for eating. A dog crouches beneath the chair.
Although this bas relief is commonly ascribed to be Sumerian, it is actually
Akkadian because the skirts and the flared hats match those of the Kish
inlay shown below. The same flared hat is worn by some of the soldiers on
the Standard of Mari, who have the same long hair as the lords at the
banquet.

Kish inlays showing a soldier escorting a bound prisoner. He is
identifiable as an Akkadian because he carries the broad-bladed battleaxe
favored by the soldiers of Kish, like those seen on Sargon's victory stele. It
is also seen on the victory stele of Naram-Sin. Sumerians,
on the other hand, used a narrow bladed battleaxe. This soldier has the
same kind of skirt
shown above. It looks like one leg exposed, which would seem ridiculous,
but the skirt
is shown in profile to show its shape. It is actually short in the front and
long in the back. The soldier wears a flared hat like those on the Standard
of Mari. The hat is Akkadian in origin
and it is symbolic of rank.

Sumerian bas relief showing a religious ceremony (see the rest of the
plaque). The naked priest pouring libations from a spouted pitcher is
typically Sumerian. The king or nobleman on the right, however, seems to
wear the same flared hat shown above and he also has long hair
on the back of his head. This could mean that he is actually an Akkadian
king or perhaps a Sumerian king under the suzerainty of an Akkadian
overlord.
Cloaks and sashes:
The Sumerian soldiers on the Standard of Ur wear a spotted cloak.

An Akkadian soldier wearing a sash. This soldier is from a later period,
but the sash is similar to those worn by the soldiers on Sargon's victory
stele. Sargon is circa 2350 B.C., which is only about a hundred years after
the Standard of Mari, so it is reasonable to assume that Akkadian soldiers
in the ED III period also wore sashes.
The uniform of the soldiers on the Standard of Mari is a combination of
the Sumerian and Akkadian styles. It has a spotted sash:

A Mari soldier carries his prisoner's skirt draped over his spear. It seems
that the prisoner is a fellow Akkadian because his skirt is short, split in
front, and has an angled fringe, which is typical Akkadian attire. It could
be argued that it is two skirts, rather than one split in the middle, because
the belt does not go all the way across the top. However, a similar mosaic
shown below has a split front and a single belt.
Sometimes the Sumerians and Akkadians wore the same clothing. It
shows a blending of the two cultures. I call it "Mesopotamian cross
dressing".
Many shell inlays were found in Mari, like the one below, which shows a
man carrying an unidentified item (possibly a pan flute?):

He wears a Sumerian skirt and an Akkadian hat.
Is he an Akkadian wearing a Sumerian skirt?
Or is he a Sumerian wearing an Akkadian hat?

of Akkadian and Sumerian styles. The skirts and the helmets are
Sumerian, the sashes are Akkadian. This is the new
coalition army of a Sumerian King of Kish, the ruler of Sumer and Akkad.
A Sumerian King of Kish. His helmet is Sumerian, but it has a knotted bun
in the back, the hairstyle of Akkadian royals. His shoulder armor is
Sumerian. His skirt is Akkadian.
