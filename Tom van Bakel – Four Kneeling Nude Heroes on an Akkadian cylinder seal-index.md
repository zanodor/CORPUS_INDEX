Four Kneeling Nude Heroes on an Akkadian cylinder seal
Number 1
Enlil Ea Suen Tammuz
This is the imprint of the extremely interesting cylinder seal of Shatpum, the son of Shallum. It depicts four identical gods and only by means of the four symbols on top we can determine them. They all turn out to be sons of the sky god Anu, because they are Enlil (also called Bel), Ea, Suen and Tammuz (see page 8).
From the following table we can see that these four gods are the presiding deities of the three spring months and the first summer month:

In the following pages we will study these gods one by one.



Number 1
Enlil
We start with Enlil, Lord Wind, who is called 'Bel' in the table above:
Bel (/ˈbeɪl/; from Akkadian: bēlu), signifying ‘lord’ or ‘master’, is a title rather than a genuine name, applied to various gods in the Mesopotamian religion of Akkad, Assyria and Babylonia. The feminine form is Belit 'Lady, Mistress'. Bel is represented in Greek as Belos and in Latin as Belus. Linguistically, Bel is an East Semitic form cognate with the Northwest Semitic Baal with the same meaning. Early translators of Akkadian believed that the ideogram for the god called in Sumerian Enlil was to be read as Bel in Akkadian. Current scholarship holds this as incorrect, but one finds Bel used in referring to Enlil in older translations and discussions.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bel_(mythology)
Because he is the god of the wind, he brings rain that overflows the rivers. In the story about the building of Ninĝirsu's temple we can therefore read that Enlil's heart, a river in flood, overflowed with joy:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple The heart overflowed with joy, Enlil's heart, a river in flood, overflowed with joy. The heart
overflowed with joy, and just as the Tigris brings sweet water, so Enlil, whose will is an enormous flood, sparkling and awe-inspiring, came to a sweet decision:
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
Then, in the same story the goblets turn out to be the Tigris and the Euphrates, continually carrying abundance:
The building of Ninĝirsu's temple
Large bronze plates (?) offered all sorts of food (?). In the good house ...... were cooked in shining bronze vessels (?). Its pure bowls standing in the great dining hall were troughs in various sizes that never lack water, and the goblets beside them were the Tigris and Euphrates continually carrying abundance.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
And so the goblet indicates that the first naked god is Enlil, the god of the wind who brings in rain and causes the rivers to overflow.



Number 1
Enlil
From the table on page one we can conclude that Anu and Enlil (Bel) are the presiding deities of Aries. The seal was probably made around 2160 B.C. and at that time the new spring and the new year began exactly in this constellation:
Mathematically a Zodiacal Age lasts 2.160 years (72 x 30 = 2160) The Zodiacal Ages rendered the Ages thus (all dates B.C.):
Lion (Leo) 10860 to 8640, Crab (Cancer), 8640 to 6480; Twins (Gemini), 6480 to 4320; Bull (Taurus), 4320 to 2160. Ram (Aries), 2160 to 0;
then Fishes (Pisces), 0 to A.D. 2160.
According to Berossus, , the zodiacal Ages were turning points in the affairs of gods and men.

So, at that time, the sun went through Aries in March/April and on the following table shows that March was the rainiest month of the year and that may have been the reason why Enlil was the presiding deity of this month.

Abu Kamal is a city in Syria situated close to the border with Iraq.



Number 1
Ea
The second god is Ea (Water House). The name makes it immediately clear that he is the god of water. He is indicated by the carp above him, because in the myth: 'Enki and the world order' he gave various species of carp to the marches.
Enki and the world order: c.1.1.3 He called the marshes and gave them the various species of carp, he spoke to the reedbeds and bestowed on them the old and new growths of reeds. (2 lines missing)
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
In addition, he is also indicated by the snake next to him. He appears to be related to these reptiles as we can see in the next drawing:
Number 2
In this drawing of a Babylonian cylinder seal the inscription reads: ‘Marduk is the god who looks after me.’ Marduk is the son of Ea and in the drawing his winged father has his legs in the form of coiling snakes.



Number 3
This imprint shows the water god with fish and streaming water, standing above a cow and the following table shows that Ea is the presiding deity of the 'month of the Bull'.

Araḫ Nisānu 'Month of the Sanctuary'
Anu and Bel KU (Aries) Nisan March/April
2 Araḫ Āru
'Month of the Bull' Ea Iyar April/May
In Sumer Ea was called Enki and in the myth 'Enki and the world order' he is like a bull (because of Taurus) or like a wild cow that filled the Tigris with water:
Enki and the world order
After he had turned his gaze from there, after Father Enki had lifted his eyes across the Euphrates, he stood up full of lust like a rampant bull, lifted his penis, ejaculated and filled the Tigris with flowing water. He was like a wild cow mooing for its young in the wild grass, its scorpion-infested cow-pen. The Tigris ...... at his side like a rampant bull. By lifting his penis, he brought a bridal gift. The Tigris rejoiced in its heart like a great wild bull, when it was born ....... It brought water, flowing water indeed: its wine will be sweet. It brought barley, mottled barley indeed: the people will eat it. It filled the E-kur, the house of Enlil, with all sorts of things. Enlil was delighted with Enki, and Nibru was glad. The lord put on the diadem as a sign of lordship, he put on the good crown as a sign of kingship, touching the ground on his left side. Plenty came forth out of the earth for him.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
It is clear that Enlil and Ea are believed to be responsible for the rising of the rivers in March, April and May. In this period, the Tigris and Euphrates do indeed begin to rise, but this is actually caused by the melting of the snow in the mountains:
‘Both the Tigris and Euphrates rise many feet each spring, and overflow their banks in various places. The rise is caused by the melting of the snows in the mountain regions from which the two
rivers and their affluent spring. The Tigris commonly begins to rise early in March, and reaches its greatest height in the first or second week of May, after which it rapidly declines, and returns to its natural level by the middle of June. The Euphrates first swells about the middle of March, and is not in full flood till quite the end of May or the beginning of June; it then continues high for above a month, and does not sink much till the middle of July, after which it gradually falls till September.’

Number 1
Suen
The third god is Suen, the god of the moon, which is of course indicated by the crescent above him. The table of the Babylonian calendar shows that he is the presiding deity of May/June.

Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.



Number 1
Dumuzid
According to the Babylonian calendar the god at the right should be Tammuz alias Dumuzid.
Above him is a star that does not symbolize the sun but Inanna as we can see in the next imprint. So here Tammuz/Dumuzid is indicated by the symbol of his wife.
When this star is positioned above Dumuzid it will no doubt imply that in this month Inanna and Dumuzid will unite with each other. When gods unite with each other, this naturally has consequences. The result here is that Shatpum, the owner of the seal, is begotten by the two gods and is born about nine months later between Aries and Taurus as the son of Shallum.
Number 4
At the top centre is the star equal to the star on the previous imprint: here it is immediately clear that this is Inanna's star.



Number 1
Enlil, Enki and Nanna, another name for Suen, are called Anunnaki, sons of the sky god An and the earth goddess Ki:
The name Anunnaki is derived from An, the Sumerian god of the sky. The name is variously written ‘da-nuna’, ‘da-nuna-ke4-ne’, or ‘da-nun-na’, meaning ‘princely offspring’ or ‘offspring of An’.
The Anunnaki were believed to be the offspring of An and his consort, the earth goddess Ki.
Samuel Noah Kramer identifies Ki with the Sumerian mother goddess Ninhursag, stating that they were originally the same figure. The oldest of the Anunnaki was Enlil, the god of air and chief god of the Sumerian pantheon. The Sumerians believed that, until Enlil was born, heaven and earth were inseparable. Then, Enlil cleft heaven and earth in two and carried away the earth while his father An carried away the sky.
The earliest known usages of the term Anunnaki come from inscriptions written during the reign of Gudea (c. 2144–2124 BC) and the Third Dynasty of Ur. In the earliest texts, the term is applied to the most powerful and important deities in the Sumerian pantheon: the descendants of the sky-god An. This group of deities probably included the ‘seven gods who decree’: An, Enlil, Enki, Ninhursag, Nanna, Utu, and Inanna.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anunnaki
According to the following text, Ama-ušumgal-ana, another name of Tammuz/Dumuzid, is recreated every month by An, like he recreates Suen:
A tigi to Inana
My lady, Ama-ušumgal-ana trusts in you. He cloaks his body as if in your royal robe of office. Monthly at the crescent moon An recreates him for you like Suen. People praise King Ama
ušumgal-ana, the beloved of your heart, like Utu as he rises.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
This means that Ama-ušumgal-ana/Dumuzid can also be called a son of An and thus four sons of the sky god are depicted next to each other on the above imprint.



The Dumuzid seal
Number 5
Tammuz Nergal Ea Enlil
This is the imprint of another interesting cylinder seal. There are again four gods depicted on it and by means of the objects they hold we can determine who they are.
It appears that Nergal is one of them and he is a son of Anu, just like Enlil, Ea and Tammuz. From the following table we can see that he has taken the place of Suen:

In the next pages we will again study these four gods.



Number 5
Tammuz/Dumuzid
The god on the left is Tammuz/Dumuzid. In a dream he is attacked and captured:
Dumuzid's dream
‘Unless the old woman is aware of Dumuzid's whereabouts, she is indeed looking frightened! She is indeed screaming in a frightened way! Come, let us go to the house of Old Woman Belili!’ They caught Dumuzid at the house of Old Woman Belili. The men surrounded him and drained the
standing waters. They twisted a cord for him, they knotted a net for him. They wove a reed hawser for him, they cut sticks for him, the one in front of him threw missiles at him, the one behind him ....... His hands were bound in handcuffs, his arms were bound in fetters. The lad raised his hands heavenward to Utu:
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
We can recognize the following actions in the imprint:
o The men surrounded him and drained the standing waters.
o They knotted a net for him.
o The one in front of him threw missiles at him.
o His hands were bound in handcuffs.
We will examine these actions and the gods that perform them one by one.
.



Number 5
Enlil
According to the myth, missiles were thrown at Dumuzid. These missiles will in reality have been the lightning of wind god Enlil:
A hymn to Ninurta
Ninurta, before whose roaring the mountains tremble, hurricane, south storm that flashes with lightning, you belong to Enlil! May it therefore ......, may Ninurta's city, the shrine Nibru -therefore ....... He is indeed its beloved, is indeed its beloved; the lord is indeed the beloved of Ekur.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
He is indicated by the wild cat he is standing on, because he despatches it towards Ereš along with other many animals:
Enlil and Sud
...... made ...... feel good, brought great rejoicing in Enlil's heart. He raised his head ......, and animals came running. ...... herds of four-legged animals that graze together in the desert. He caught ...... living in the mountains, he made wild bulls, red deer, elephants, fallow deer, gazelles, bears, wild sheep and rams, lynxes, foxes, wild cats, tigers, mountain sheep, water buffaloes, monkeys, and thick-horned fat cattle jostle together noisily. Cows and their calves, wild cattle with wide-spread horns, ...... rope, { ewes and lambs, goats and kids, romping ...... } { (1 later ms. from Susa has instead:) ...... and fighting }, large kids with long beards, scratching with their hooves, lambs, ......, and majestic sheep were despatched by Enlil toward Ereš.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.



Number 5
Ea/Enki
Many snakes are engraved on this imprint. Dumuzid is related to these reptiles because he turned into a snake himself:
Inana's descent to the nether world
Utu accepted his tears. { (1 ms. adds 1 line:) Dumuzid's demons could not keep hold of him. } Utu turned Dumuzid's hands into snake's hands. He turned his feet into snake's feet. Dumuzid escaped his demons. { (1 ms. adds 1 line:) Like a saĝkal snake he ....... } They seized ....... (2 lines fragmentary)Holy Inana ...... her heart.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
In the imprint, Dumuzid is surrounded by standing snakes. I suspect that these snakes symbolize these standing waters:
Dumuzid's dream
‘Come, let us go to Ku-bireš.’ { (1 ms. adds:) ...... like a net ....... } They caught Dumuzid at Ku
bireš. The men surrounded him and drained the standing waters. They twisted a cord for him, they knotted a net for him. They wove a reed hawser for him, they cut sticks for him, the one in front of him threw missiles at him, the one behind him ....... His hands were bound in handcuffs, his arms were bound in fetters. The lad raised his hands heavenward to Utu:

In the middle the water god Ea/Enki holds a trident of snakes as he is the related to these coldblooded animals:
Number 2
Again, in this drawing we see the water god with legs in the form of coiling snakes.



Number 5
Nergal with a battle-net
In the myth ‘Dumuzid's dream’ is written that they knotted a net for him. When I have understood the following text correctly, this net is Nergal's awesome radiance:
An adab (?) to Nergal for Šulgi (?)
Nergal who ......, ...... great awe, who ...... the underworld -- its awesome radiance ...... the battlenet, its awesomeness has filled heaven and earth.
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
Nergal is the eldest son of Anu:
History: Nergal is the eldest son of Anu, the ruler of an extra-dimensional race of beings known as the Annunaki, who were worshipped as gods by the various empires and tribes of Ancient Mesopotamia, and his wife, Mami, goddess of motherhood.
http://enenuru.proboards.com/thread/329/nergal
And he is a sun god:
I am convinced that Nergal is the netherworld aspect of the sun-god, on the basis of late mystical texts which I had looked at in the Erra thread. One text states: dšamaš u nergal(U.GUR) istēn(1)en Šamaš and Nergal are one
Another text (Sumerian GEN) states that Utu opened a hole in the Netherworld to bring up Enkidu. In the Akkadian translation, the name of Utu is replaced by Nergal (U.GUR).
http://enenuru.proboards.com/thread/329/nergal
According to the next table Suen is the presiding deity van Gemini:

Now the case is that the sun god and the moon god are the two gods of Gemini and the above imprint just shows one of them: the sun god Nergal with his battle-net.



About the so called ‘star spades’
Number 5
An engender the seal owner
We come back to Dumuzid who has been captured: his hands were bound in handcuffs.
A so-called 'star spade' is depicted next to him. It symbolizes that the sky god An and the goddess of the earth Ki unite: An is symbolized by the star and Ki is represented by the womb. This is further elaborated on the basis of the following imprints.
An and Ki engendered the four deities and they are also the divine parents of the seal owner who is created in June/July, the month of Dumuzid, and born in March/April, the month of Enlil.
Number 6
It is clear this imprint shows a so-called 'star spade'. But no farmer will work with a star as a 'handle'. So it must have a completely different meaning.
o I think this star symbolizes An or Anu. o At the bottom of the so-called spade is a V-sign. This sign symbolizes a womb or a valley.
Now we can say the following: the husband of the god of the sky is the goddess of the earth, 'Uraš' (early Sumerian) or 'Ki' (later Sumerian), so:
o The An, the god of heaven, above. o And Uraš' or 'Ki' the goddesses of the earth is below. o The line between them symbolizes that they are connected and thus they are 'united'.



Number 8
Here is another so-called 'spade'.
o Above is the star of An or Anu, the god of heaven. o And below is the womb of ‘Uraš' or 'Ki', goddesses of the earth. o An and his spouse 'Uraš' or 'Ki' solomize a Sacred Marriage in Cancer. o About nine months later 'Uraš' or 'Ki' give birth to a child in the E-ana.
In ‘the House of Heaven’ children may be born like in the Keš temple countless people and kings are born. This temple is an important fierce bull (Taurus):
The Keš temple hymn
10-20. Nisaba was its decision-maker (?); with its words she wove it intricately like a net. Written on tablets it was held in her hands: House, platform of the Land, important fierce bull! House Keš, platform of the Land, important fierce bull! Growing as high as the hills, embracing the heavens, growing as high as E-kur, lifting its head among the mountains! Rooted in the abzu, verdant like the mountains! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?
Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature.
It is founded by An:
31-43. House, great enclosure, reaching to the heavens, great, true house, reaching to the heavens! House, great crown reaching to the heavens, house, rainbow reaching to the heavens! House whose diadem extends into the midst of the heavens, whose foundations are fixed in the abzu, whose shade covers all lands! House founded by An, praised by Enlil, given an oracle by Mother Nintur! House Keš, green in its fruit! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur?

And it gives birth to countless peoples, seed which has sprouts! It gives birth to kings,
58A-58Q. House ...... inspiring great awe, called with a mighty name by An; house ...... whose fate is grandly determined by the Great Mountain Enlil! House of the Anuna gods possessing great power, which gives wisdom to the people; house, reposeful dwelling of the great gods! House, which was planned together with the plans of heaven and earth, ...... with the pure divine powers; house which underpins the Land and supports the shrines! House, mountain of abundance which passes the days in glory; house of Ninḫursaĝa which establishes the life of the Land! House, great hillside worthy of the purification rites, altering (?) all things; house without whom no decisions are made! House, good ...... carrying in its hands the broad Land; house which gives birth to countless
peoples, seed which has sprouts! House which gives birth to kings, which determines the destinies of the Land; house whose royal personages are to be revered! Will anyone else bring forth something as great as Keš? Will any other mother ever give birth to someone as great as its hero Ašgi? Who has ever seen anyone as great as its lady Nintur? }

Number 7
And at the left is another’ star spade’ which symbolizes that An, the god of heaven, unites with Ki, the goddess of the earth. In June/July, when the sun passes through Cancer, the seat of An, they engender a child who is born in March when the sun passes through Pleiades, (the heavenly gate), a small constellation in Taurus .

Number 3 British Museum number: 89115 Title: The Adda Seal Description: A hunting god (full-face) has a bow and an arrow (?) over his shoulder; a quiver with tassel attached hangs on his back. On the left-hand mountain stands a small tree and Ishtar (full-face) who is winged and armed with weapons including an axe and a mace rising from her shoulders. She is holding a bush-like object, probably a bunch of dates, above the sun-god's head. The sun-god Shamash with rays, holding a serrated blade, is just beginning to emerge from between two square topped mountains. The water god Ea stands to the right with one foot placed on the right-hand mountain. He stretches out his right hand towards an eagle, probably the Zu bird who stole the tablets of destiny. A couchant bull lies between his legs and streams of water and fish flow from his shoulders. Behind him stands his two-faced attendant god Usimu with his right hand raised. All wear the multiple-horned head-dresses of deities. The male figures are bearded and Usimu has a double beard and wears a flounced skirt. Ea and Ishtar both wear flounced robes and the fourth complete figure wears a striped skirt which either has a cod-piece or is hitched up in front. This god wears his hair in a long curl down the left side, reminiscent of those worn by bull-men and Ishtar has two similar curls hanging down, one on either side, while Ea and Shamash wear their hair in a triple bun. The scales of the mountain are continued in a horizontal band all-round the lower part of the seal and it is on this band that the figures are standing. There is a two-line inscription in a frame and below it a lion is pacing towards the right and roaring. The cylinder is slightly concave in shape.
