An introduction to The Princess Wife
5-7 minutes
A Sumerian princess
Tablet BE 31,28 was found by the Babylonian Expedition of the University
of Pennsylvania
in 1893. The first attempt to translate it was by Stephen Langdon in 1914.
He thought
it was a Dialogue between Two Women, but he was unable to offer a
complete translation
of the tablet so he did not publish it.

For the next hundred years many prominent Sumerologists also tried their
hand at translating this tablet, but to no avail. Individual words and
phrases hinted at many possible meanings for the story, but the tablet
could not be read.
Until now.
This is my translation of BE 28. It is not a Dialogue between Two Women.
It is actually the story of the young prince Mulu, otherwise known as The
Great Fatted Donkey. It is similar to Tablet #36, the story of The Great
Fatted Bull. Both stories are political satires about great lords and kings.
Since mocking the nobility was a dangerous thing to do, both tablets were
deliberately encoded to keep their meaning secret. Puns, “trick signs”, and
clever wordplay were used to disguise the meaning of the tablets, making
them almost impossible to decipher. That is why modern Sumerologists
had so much difficulty reading them. Not even another Sumerian scribe
could easily read these tablets.
Many of the same events occur in both stories, and many of the sentences
in The Great Fatted Donkey seem to have been lifted word-for-word from
The Great Fatted Bull. In addition, both stories include murder mysteries
that the readers must solve for themselves using the clues provided.
You may be wondering why I keep referring to the Fatted Donkey when
this story is called
The Princess Wife. That's because the donkey prince is the central
character in the story,
but in my opinion, his wife is the star of the show.
In the story of The Great Fatted Bull, the wife is deliberately hidden in the
background to enshroud her in mystery and to conceal her part in the
conspiracy. She doesn't even have a speaking role; she doesn't say one
word throughout the entire narrative. I doubt many readers would realize
the wife’s importance to the story unless I pointed it out to them.
In the story of The Great Fatted Donkey, the wife is front and center. She’s
the one doing
all of the talking and making all of the decisions. She’s clearly the boss,
even in the presence of her husband (the prince) and his father (the lord).
Apparently there were several versions of The Great Fatted Donkey
making the rounds in scribal circles (see my translation of The Great

Fatted Jackass). BE 28 is a later variation of the original donkey theme,
but unlike the others, it is written from the woman's point of view. While I
was translating this tablet, even though I didn't know all of the signs, I
kept thinking, "That's a woman talking." It was like hearing a faint voice in
the distance. I couldn't hear
what was being said, just a few words here and there, but I knew it was a
woman's voice.
The other Sumerologists who attempted to translate this tablet were
wrong about the
context of the story, but they too heard a female voice.
For these and other reasons, I believe that BE 28 was written by a woman.
Female scribes
were a rarity in ancient Mesopotamia, but many noblewomen were taught
to read and write
so they could be the high priestesses of important temples (a high
priestess was always
a noblewoman). A notable example is Urukagina’s wife Shasha, who was
the high priestess and chief administrator for the temple of the goddess
Ba-u. Another example is Enheduana, the daughter of Sargon the Great.
She was the first female author in history. Perhaps the author of The
Princess Wife was herself a princess, and hence her affinity for the part.
In this regard she would be just like Shasha or Enheduana – a woman, a
scribe, an author,
a princess and a priestess.
It may be too much to hope that the author was a princess, and it isn't
really necessary.
Perhaps she was merely the daughter of a wealthy merchant (only rich
people and the
nobility could afford scribal school because it was very expensive). She
may have
become a scribe to help take care of her father's business in a family that
had no son.
Nor is it necessary that the woman who wrote this story even knew how to
read and write. Even if the scribe who actually wrote the signs on the
tablet was a man, like most scribes,
the author of the story was certainly a woman, possibly his wife. She's the

one who came up with the storyline. Here’s how I see it happening: A
scribe is reading the story of The Great Fatted Donkey to his wife. It has
the usual ending, like that of The Great Fatted Bull, where the women are
hidden in the background. They both have a good laugh about the story.
Then the wife says, “That’s funny . . . but you know what would be even
funnier? At the end, the wife of the prince starts talking. She tells him . . .
Are you writing this down?”
In effect, the husband was just taking dictation. It was likewise for me
while I was translating
this tablet. I was merely transcribing it the way she wanted me to write it,
from the woman's
point of view.
This tablet is all about the women.
You've heard the story of The Princess Bride, now read the story of The
Princess Wife.

The story opens in Mulu's palace. He and Zuzu have recently returned
from a campaign of plundering the countryside. The scene is Mulu's
banquet hall. He has just sat down to enjoy his victory feast. A servant girl
waits in attendance.
[x,x] . . . with sweet words on her lips
the servant without equal bows down before Mulu, the powerful
[x, x].
Keep your eye on the servant girl. She is up to something.
She says, “Earth and the heavens feel worried when the strong
man is not near.” It sounds like the servant is reassured by Mulu's safe
return, but she is just flattering him,
lulling him into a false sense of complacency. Although she flatters him,
her "sweet words"
are actually a veiled insult. Mulu is right in front of her when she bows
down and tells him,
"the strong man is not near".
Mulu is named for the role he plays in the story. Mu-lu is Emesal dialect
for lu2, meaning "man, person, ruler". It can also mean "someone or
anyone". Any of these definitions
could apply, but his identity remains a mystery until his name is literally
translated. Mu-lu literally means "man-abundant" (in size and
possessions). Mulu is the Abundant Man,
fat and rich.
Zuzu, with much plundering, has become a wealthy man.So...
Zuzu is a man of plunder. You should keep your eye on him too.
He says to Mulu, “Behold the lord! You are a satisfied man of
riches.
“You are a trusted man of authority, a man generous with his
rations
and his verdicts.”
None of which is true, of course. Mulu will never be satisfied with his
riches, he will always want more. No one really trusts him, and he's not at

all generous. He's just greedy.
Rations refer to the system of allocating rations of food, beer, and other
necessities
for workers in lieu of wages. The Sumerians lived in a time before money
was invented
so they didn't have metal coins or printed currency. Instead, wages were
paid in rations,
and business was conducted through bartering. This story is all about
rations and barter.
Like the servant girl, Zuzu is flattering Mulu with the same kind of veiled
sarcasm, lulling him into the same kind of false security. Meanwhile, Mulu
is only hearing what he wants to hear, that he is a great and wonderful
prince, much beloved and admired.
Flattery has always been the language of a royal court, but in Mulu's court,
the flattery is honey laced with venom.
It's easy to feel sorry for Mulu. He has just sat down to dinner and he is
already surrounded
by conspirators.
Mulu eats his food like a pig. He divides his captured fodder,
and with his hands
he crams it into his mouth and chokes it down.
His true nature is suddenly revealed by his deplorable table manners. He's
quite the glutton.
Notice that Mulu is eating his captured "fodder", the food of animals.
That's because Mulu
is not just a wealthy prince, he is also a donkey (jackass). He is The Great
Fatted Donkey, just like Lu-mah, The Great Fatted Bull.
The titled characters in the two stories are part man, part animal.
Sometimes Mulu is a man, sometimes he is a donkey, and sometimes he is
both at once. On the other hand, the women in both stories are just
normal women; real women, as you will soon find out.
“My flanks grow fat!” he brays, while eating all the food his

hands can grab.
When Mulu talks he brays like a donkey. Lu-mah bellows like a bull.
Mulu is happy, without a care in the world.
Night comes. His rivals wander in by themselves. One of the
men is stealing
a bowl of malted cakes.
The bowl of malted cakes is a clue.
{Someone in the darkness calls out to Mulu}
“The people’s rations will make you bray with great burning
indigestion!
So now we hear that the Great Fatted Donkey has been stealing the
people's rations. This is
a very serious charge, and it's about to give him an upset stomach ...
“Permanently!”
Permanent, as in death. Someone is going to murder Mulu.
Nose to his fat nose, the “man not his servant” {rebel, enemy}
throttles the lord. In The Great Fatted Bull, Lu-mah and his assailant
throttle each other. It's a reciprocal thing, because Lu-mah fights back, he
attacks his attacker. In the story here, the enemy is the
only one who does the throttling. The fat prince does not manfully defend
himself.
In this way, both men stay true to their animal natures. A bull is violent, a
donkey is not.
So... who is trying to kill Mulu? And why?
Mulu opens his mouth and swears two oaths to his adversary.
He gasps, “All this malt and fodder ... to abandon! This great
eating to diminish!”
Mulu manages to save his own life by promising to give up his gluttonous

ways, but it is already too late. He is about to lose everything else.
In the people’s judgment he is not lordly. The god Enlil does not
support him.The people don't like it when someone steals their rations.
They don't like it at all.
Enlil is the chief Sumerian god, so it's pretty bad when Enlil himself turns
his back on Mulu.
His wife decides to split his grain between her female servants
and his slave women.
He gets one single twig of his henbur grain. It's the wife's way of
saying, "Consider this a divorce."
“Why? For what reason?" he cries out. His stomach knows a
great hunger.
All this has come as a big shock to Mulu. He can't imagine why anyone
would do this to him. After all, he has always been a wise and beneficent
ruler, in his own mind at least. Mulu's problem is he always believed
people when they told him how great and wonderful he was,
even when they didn't mean it.
Filled with wine, he clutches his henbur grain while his heaps of
plunder
are spread out before the happy slave women.
So the Great Fatted Donkey is not just a glutton, he is a drunkard as well.
In this sentence it's impossible to tell if Mulu is grasping his single twig of
henbur, or if he
has flung himself on his plundered heaps of grain, hugging them as the
dwindling piles
are swept toward the happy slave women.
Either way, it's one of the best lines in all of literature.

Mulu goes away acting like a man defeated. How the mighty Mulu
has fallen!
Outside, he walks in the manure of the country. He has become
a pauper.
While the women live in abundance, he is a man without power,
without women,
and without virtue.
This is bad, really bad. The Great Fatted Donkey is completely defeated.
He lost his wife
and his women, his food, his wealth, and his kingdom. He also lost the
love of the people
and the respect of the gods. Now he stumbles around in the pasture
through piles of sh*t,
literally, just like any other barnyard donkey.
In the story of The Great Fatted Bull, things turn out pretty good for Lu
mah, even though he committed worse crimes than Mulu. Within a few
sentences Lu-mah is back on Easy Street, but Mulu continues to suffer. Oh
how he suffers! The story of Mulu is like the Story of Job,
and it's about to get much worse.
Like a storm, Mulu flies to his father Bantu, the Supreme Lord.
Prince Mulu goes running to his daddy for help.
His father says, “This will open her pure heart. Behold these
jewelry beads of stone.”Princess Pureheart? We shall see about that.
“These you can barter for baskets of food.”
Sumerians didn't have precious gems like rubies, diamonds, and
emeralds. Instead, their jewelry is made of carved stone beads, mostly
agate, carnelian, and lapis lazuli. Although simple in design, Sumerian
jewelry is quite beautiful, as shown in the Jewelry section.

{Mulu returns to his wife. He shows her the beads and he tells
her . . . }
“Behold the great gifts I made for you! I fashioned them to be
so splendid
and magnificent. They are not from the marketplace.”
Full of false hope, Mulu attempts a reconciliation with his wife. We know
this because he presents the beads as handcrafted gifts, and not just items
to barter for food. He might have met with some success if he hadn't lied
about it. So now we know that Mulu is a liar, and
not a very good liar at that. It was foolish of him to add the unnecessary
detail that the beads were not purchased in the marketplace, since he
already said that he made them himself.
It's like he's trying much too hard to be convincing. So his wife, who has
heard him lie
many times before, immediately becomes suspicious. She's thinking,
"Marketplace?
Who said anything about a marketplace?"
A princess knows all about jewelry. It's easy to imagine that she takes one
look at the beads,
then she looks at Mulu and says:
"Really? You really thought you'd get away with
that?"
The wife does not give her princess heart to the hero.Things don't
always turn out the way they do in fairy tales.
As we will soon discover, the wife is not a fairy tale princess; and as we
already know, Mulu
is no Prince Charming.
The word "hero" is meant sarcastically, by the way.
She says, “You planned to [x,x ...]
“but my trusty maidservant has told me all about your lack of
character.

This is the same servant girl seen at the beginning of the story, bowing
before Mulu and whispering sweet nothings. I told you she was up to
something. The "servant without equal" has been spying on Mulu all
along, reporting every sordid detail back to the princess wife.
In this story, and in the story of The Great Fatted Bull, all of the women
are quite formidable, including the servants and the slave women.
Getting back in good with the wifey could solve all of Mulu's problems, but
at this point, Mulu is beginning to suspect that his scheme for a
reconciliation is starting to unravel.
“The selling price for each bead also reveals that the lord gave
you these stones. Something about the price of the beads has confirmed
to the wife what the servant girl has already told her – that Mulu got the
beads from his father, who in turn got them from the marketplace. She's
not fooled by any of this. She knows the true value of the beads, so now
she's ready to make a counter offer.
“I will purchase them for a half basket of [x,x...] It sure would be
nice to know what's in that basket, or rather, half basket. Unfortunately
the signs in the rest of the sentence are badly damaged, so the contents of
the basket cannot
be known with any certainty. However, the signs are clear enough to show
that it isn't food.
In any case, the baskets of food will later be given to someone else. I
believe the half basket contains some worthless commodity, with some
ironic symbolic meaning that is now lost
due to damage on the tablet. I wouldn't be a bit surprised if it was a half
basket of pig slop.
The wife is driving a hard bargain. Mulu initially asked for a basket of food
for each bead, but the princess offers a half basket of something worthless
in exchange for all of the beads.
It's an insulting low-ball offer that would humiliate Mulu if he accepts it,
which he must.
He has no other choice.
"So you don't know beads . . .Mulu was unwise to think he could fool

a woman about jewelry.
“And you don’t know women!" [x, x...]
These are the last words heard by many a man, right before the door is
slammed in his face.
It's the wife's way of saying, "We are still divorced!"
Only a few lines are left in the story, so you’re probably thinking you are
almost finished
reading these annotations. Unfortunately for you, at this point in the
story, things become
darker and more ambiguous, so by necessity my comments will be longer
and more detailed
(just so you know). This is The Big Dénouement, where everything is
explained.
{The wife continues . . .}
“To men who rob and plunder, all women are prostitutes [x,
x...]”
That’s an odd thing for the princess to say.
This is a very important sentence, and everything depends on how you
read it. Ra is the
sign meaning “to” or “for”. The words are often used interchangeably, like
in English.
For instance, “to you” and “for you” mean essentially the same thing in
both languages.
But the meaning of this particular sentence changes dramatically
depending on which word you use. “To men who plunder” suggests that in
the men’s opinion all women are prostitutes, or so it seems to the men. On
the other hand, “for the men” means that women are willing prostitutes
for men who plunder − because they’re the men with all the money. In this
way,
all women are prostitutes for rich men because the women “sell” their
sexual favors

(within and without marriage) in exchange for money. Whichever
interpretation you choose
will change the meaning of the next sentence and it will also change the
ending of the story.
(I know I said the Sumerians didn't have money, but you know what I
mean.)
“So I decree that the baskets of food will go to the person [x,
x...]”
The sentence is damaged, so it is impossible to tell who gets the baskets of
food, but I’m betting that it’s the servant girl. This is her reward for the
part she played in the conspiracy.
The baskets of food are certainly not going to Mulu, that’s for sure. Nor is
there a reason for the wife to give the baskets to Mulu’s father Bantu, the
Supreme Lord. However, it's possible that the baskets of food will be given
to Zuzu (remember Zuzu?). Although this is possible (anything is possible
in this story) it seems unlikely because Zuzu will later be rewarded
in a different way for his role in the conspiracy. So the only one left is the
faithful servant girl, and we expect to see her getting paid for her services.
Unfortunately, the last sentence casts the servant in an unfavorable light,
intentionally or not. The wife talks about women being prostitutes, then
segues into rewarding the servant girl.
There seems to be an implied meaning or connection.
Perhaps it refers to the way that the servant girl (young woman) was
treated by Mulu. He is
a man of plunder. To him, all women are prostitutes. As a royal prince,
Mulu believes it is
his god-given right to have sex with the female help, both servants and
slave women alike. Whether or not he had any success with this particular
servant, he surely made the attempt, in his own slovenly way.
On the other hand, maybe it isn’t the way she was treated, maybe it's the
way she acted.
Perhaps she used her sexual favors to gain Mulu’s confidence, to keep the
strong man near,
so she could keep her eye on him. I’m just saying.

It has to be considered. I wouldn't mention it at all if the wife hadn’t
brought it up first.
Like I said before, it's a very odd thing for the princess to say.
The damaged portion of this sentence would have explained everything.
Unfortunately, it is
too damaged to read the signs. Perhaps the sentence originally said, “the
baskets of food
will go to the person who is the purest one of us all”, which would
exonerate the servant.
Then again, the sentence may have said, “the baskets of food will go to the
person who
really is a prostitute”, who needs to be paid for her services. It’s
impossible to know which
of the meanings apply, so you are left to make up your own mind about it.
For his elder brother’s possessions, Zuzu brays like a happy
replacement donkey.
Whoa! What’s this? Zuzu is Mulu’s brother? This comes as a complete
surprise to us because we weren’t told about it until right here at the end
of the story. It means that Zuzu, like his brother, is also a donkey, which
was shockingly revealed by his sudden braying.
A replacement donkey, as the name suggests, is a fresh donkey that is
rotated into a
yoked team to replace another donkey that is worn out. Zuzu is the
replacement donkey.
Mulu is the donkey that is worn out.
Wait a minute... That means the man who tried to assassinate Mulu was
his own brother!
Yes, Zuzu is the one who tried to strangle Mulu, which soon will be proven
beyond a shadow
of a doubt. Modern criminal investigators have a saying, “follow the
money”. Follow where the money goes, it will lead you to the culprit. As we
are about to see, the money will soon drop right in Zuzu’s lap.
It’s not known if Bantu, the Supreme Lord, is present at these
proceedings. Bantu is Mulu’s

and Zuzu’s father. The princess wife is his daughter-in-law. Apparently
Bantu thinks highly
of the princess and "her pure heart", so perhaps it’s best if he isn't around.
He would be
quite traumatized if he knew what was really happening in this highly
dysfunctional family.
So for the sake of his own happiness, the less he knows, the better.
To Zuzu she gives Mulu’s abundant fields of grain.
There it is. This is the payoff for Zuzu’s role in the conspiracy. There’s no
other reason for
the wife to give Mulu’s abundant fields of grain to Zuzu, and it isn't
because she was in a
generous mood. This was the plan all along. It is Zuzu’s reward for doing
the dirty work, i.e., strangling his own brother.
Mulu, the man of plunder, has just been plundered by his wife.
Poor Mulu. He's left with nothing, absolutely nothing, not even his pride
and dignity. It's easy
to feel sorry for Mulu. Sure, he is a thief, a liar, and a glutton; and yes, he
is also a drunkard and a philanderer, but he's not mean like the Great
Fatted Bull, and he is not violent. Lu-mah is a man of violence. He
personally captures women and makes them his slaves. He also
lays the lash to the back of the shepherd brother. On the other hand, Mulu
is never violent,
not even when he is attacked. Unlike Lu-mah, Mulu is more of a fool than
a villain.
Lu-mah got away scot free with his crimes, but Mulu continues to suffer.
The story of Mulu is like the Story of Job, but without the happy ending.
Mulu gets absolutely no mercy from his wife. She rakes him across the
coals, up one side and down the other. First she tries to murder him, then
she divorces him. She humiliates him and then takes all of his stuff. Many
ex-husbands can probably relate to the story of Mulu.
For all you men out there, the moral of the story is clear: "Don't piss off
the wifey."

{She exclaims to Zuzu . . . }
“Long may you live! You are the man of great abundance!
So now Zuzu is the new Abundant Man, just like his brother was. The
court ladies say Zuzu
is quite handsome, “though tending towards fat.” They say that Zuzu
reminds them of Mulu,
who at one time was also very handsome, just like his brother.
"You will be the Lord of the Cakes, of all the cakes!
Remember the malted cakes at the beginning of the story? There are only
two times when the cakes are mentioned. The first time is when they were
stolen, and then now, when Zuzu
is so conveniently named the Lord of the Cakes. This is proof that Zuzu
stole the cakes.
It puts him at the scene of the crime, so it also proves that he’s the one
who strangled Mulu.
See, I told you it was a clue.
Why did he steal the cakes? Did he steal the cakes so he could return
them to the people?
After all, the cakes are part of the people’s rations. When he called out to
Mulu and said,
”The people’s rations will make you bray with great burning indigestion!”,
Zuzu sounded
very democratic, quite egalitarian.
Is he a new kind of prince, one who actually cares about the welfare of the
common people?
I doubt it. I believe he stole the cakes simply because he has a sweet tooth,
with a fondness for malted cakes in particular.
Here's what I think happened: Imagine Zuzu lurking in the darkness,
waiting to strangle
his own brother. You’d think he would be very tense and nervous, with his
stomach in a knot,
but Zuzu is thinking, “Mmm, malted cakes. I think I’ll have a little snack.”

It seems that Zuzu is another Mulu in the making.
So far as Zuzu is concerned, the people be damned. He obviously doesn't
agree with the saying by Marie Antoinette, "Let them eat cake." Zuzu
wants all of the cakes for himself. That's why he is named the Lord of the
Cakes, "of all the cakes!"
There is something else that needs to be considered:
This is more than just an ordinary murder plot. It’s not merely a case
about a woman trying to knock off her husband. Nor is it a case of simple
assault when two brothers are fighting.
It's a coup d’état, an abrupt change of government. It is a matter of state. A
reigning prince
has been deposed and almost murdered. He has been stripped of his
wealth and kicked out
of his kingdom. Now a new prince has been named as his “replacement”.
One government
has been violently overthrown and another has been put into its place.
Now someone new
will dispense the royal verdicts and allocate the people’s rations.
This coup d’état was the result of a risky plot that required secret
meetings, careful planning, and covert surveillance − all leading up to a
sudden and violent attack in the still of the night.
In this conspiracy, Zuzu is the muscle of the operation, the servant girl is
the spy, and the young princess is the mastermind.
Make no mistake, this was the wife’s plan all along. She is the mastermind
of the operation. She set the plot in motion, and everything turned out
exactly the way she planned it.
She is still running the show right now. She’s the one doing all of the
talking. She's the one making all of the decisions.
So there's no doubt about it, this tablet was definitely written by a woman.
"And I will be the Princess of the Fodder, for ever and ever
again!”
“Princess of the Fodder” may sound like a hokey title to some people, but
in this kingdom,
grain and fodder mean wealth and power.

“Again” is the operative word in this sentence. She was the Princess of
Fodder once before when she was married to Mulu. She'll be the Princess
again after she marries Zuzu.
Yes, she will marry Zuzu, her husband’s brother. Zuzu will be the prince
and she will be the prince’s wife. Zuzu has just bumped his elder brother
from the line of succession, so now
he is the heir apparent to Bantu, the Supreme Lord. Zuzu is rich, but
Bantu is far richer,
and vastly more powerful. When Bantu passes away (or meets with an
unfortunate accident, god forbid), Zuzu will become the Supreme Lord,
and his wife will become the Queen.
So now the question is: Were Zuzu and the princess wife having an affair?
Of course they were.
Did the affair lead to the plot, or did the plot lead to the affair? In either
case, with the added excitement of being co-conspirators in a dangerous
murder plot, a torrid affair seems like a foregone conclusion. After all,
human nature hasn’t really changed too much in 4,000 years.
“For men who rob and plunder, all women are prostitutes.” The wife’s
sentence now comes back to haunt her. Remember, Zuzu is also a man of
plunder. The wife has gotten rid of one man of plunder, and now she is
marrying another. This raises serious questions about her motivations.
Was she talking about herself when she said that? It seems that perhaps
her motives were more financial than political.
Of course, all of this is my own interpretation of the events. I have no
proof that the princess had an affair, and I have no proof that she intends
to marry Zuzu. This tablet is open to a
variety of different interpretations (it was deliberately written this way) so
you should
make up your own mind about the princess wife.
On the one hand, she could be The Good Princess. Maybe she really is
Princess Pureheart,
a kind woman working selflessly to rid the kingdom of a greedy and
gluttonous tyrant that is plundering the countryside and stealing the
people's rations. Then on the other hand, maybe she is The Bad Princess,
an evil and conniving woman who cynically manipulates everyone

in her single-minded pursuit of wealth and power. You decide which
version to believe.
Let’s take one more look at the “happy couple” as they eye each other
warily, here on the august occasion of their betrothal . He is a strong man,
she is a strong woman. In a way,
it seems like they're made for each other. This could be a match made in
heaven.
So... do they live happily ever after?
Probably not. After seeing what happened to Mulu, Zuzu is now thinking,
“Uh-oh. What did I
get myself into?” The princess is thinking, “Zuzu is not an easy pushover
like his brother."
Zuzu has readily shown that he's capable of violence, even against his own
family members.
The princess is wondering, “If it comes right down to it, how can I get rid
of Zuzu?”
Meanwhile...
The servant girl has got her eyes on him already. She's watching his every
move.

Transliteration for The Princess Wife
23-29 minutes
Some of the cuneiform signs on tablet BE 31,28. (CDLI record P345102).
In 1914, Stephen H. Langdon wrote a scholarly paper about an obscure
cuneiform tablet
called BE 31,28. The tablet is owned by the Archaeological Museum in
Istanbul, Turkey. Langdon classified it as a literary tablet, as A Dialogue
between Two Women, but he never published a complete translation of it.
That’s because he couldn’t read the entire tablet, so most of the writing
remained untranslatable. BE 28 is officially entitled “Dialogue between
fPN and fPN”, where fPN means female Personal Name, which shows how
little of the tablet was translated since even the names of the two
protagonists wasn’t known. Langdon was a world renowned Sumerologist,
an expert in the field. He could translate complicated literary tablets, and
yet he could not read this one simple tablet.
Throughout the years BE 28 made the scholarly rounds. Many prominent
Sumerologists attempted to translate this tablet, but without success. They
speculated on the meaning of various sentences, but they could not make

any sense of the tablet as a whole. The sentences never coalesced into a
single cohesive story.
The same is true for Tablet #36 in the Library of Congress. It had been
around for 100 years and the experts couldn’t translate it either.
In December 2008, I posted a translation of Tablet 36, the story of The
Great Fatted Bull.
The very next day, December 7, a date that will live in infamy, Bendt
Alster, a world famous Sumerologist, announced that Tablet #36 wasn’t
really about a great fatted bull. He said
it was actually a missing part of the Dialogue between Two Women, based
on Langdon’s
incomplete, unpublished translation and Alster’s own “somewhat
incomplete manuscript”
that had also never been published. We had a big fight about it (via email).
So I posted a new page on this website where I challenged him to a
“Sumerian Showdown!”, my translation against his. I hoped to provoke
Alster into attempting to disprove my translation, and failing that, he
would be forced to confirm it. I said if these tablets are
indeed a "Dialogue between Two Women", then they are of great historical
importance, here in the Feminist Era, and he needs to publish them. I said
this because I wanted to see why he thought the two tablets were related.
Was BE 28 a continuation of The Great Fatted Bull?
I also asked him to publish the line-drawing of the tablet, but he refused.
Needless to say, Alster could not convert the story of The Great Fatted Bull
into a Dialogue between Two Women, and neither was he able to offer a
complete translation of BE 28.
That was seven years ago. Just recently I finally saw a copy of the line
drawing for BE 28,
and I immediately knew why Alster thought the tablets were two separate
parts of the
same story.
Many of the sentences occur word for word on both tablets. In addition,
both tablets use
many of the same "trick signs", such as mahX and gemeX (explained
below) to disguise the meaning of the texts. That's because both stories are

political satires about lords and kings. Since ridiculing kings was a
dangerous thing to do, the scribes deliberately made the tablets difficult to
read – to keep their meanings secret. That is why the professional
Sumerologists were unable to decipher the tablets. The tablets were meant
to fool even other Sumerians.
I was able to translate this tablet only because I had already "decoded"
Tablet #36, so I
wasn't fooled by the trick signs. As soon as I saw tablet BE 28 I knew it
was a story about
the Great Fatted Something, though at first I didn't know what. Soon
afterwards, when I saw anše in line r4, I quickly realized that it's the story
of The Great Fatted Donkey. However,
I entitled it The Princess Wife because she is the star of the show. If you
want to read
a version of The Great Fatted Donkey, you can always check out my
translation of SEM 114,
the story of The Great Fatted Jackass.
When I first published my translation of Tablet #36, the story of The
Great Fatted Bull,
it was quite the anomaly because there were no other tablets like it.
Tablets BE 31,28
and SEM 114 prove that my reading of the signs was correct all along.

The sign inim is partially damaged, with just the “head” of the sign

Guru3 is often used as a modifier meaning “to bear, carry, to be imbued

Zuzu's name could be interpreted as Zuh-zuh (the same signs but with
different definitions and pronunciations) meaning "steal-steal".

man rations verdict-his
I went crazy looking for a sign that looked like the first one in this
sentence. Then I realized
it was actually two signs joined together, igi and umun (ES, en). Four of
the signs in this sentence are joined together in this same way, some of
which are merged across each other. There are so many joined signs that I
thought maybe they were some sort of “ligatures” (signs that are "tied"
together and pronounced in reverse order, like lugal, which is written gal
lu2 but pronounced lu2-gal). As it turns out, they are just normal signs.
Perhaps they are merged together to save space on the line because there
are so many signs crowded into the sentence. On the other hand, perhaps
they were written this way to help obscure the context of the tablet, to
disguise the secret meaning of the story.
Speaking of which: U (umun) is a seldom-used alternative sign for en,
meaning “lord”. It is definitely used to obscure the fact that the story is
mocking great lords and kings. In this way, it is like Lu2-mahX on Tablet
#36, which is used to disguise the “king” context in the story of The Great
Fatted Bull, as described in the Transliteration.
o5 šaḫ2 ka-a gu7 gu7 zi2 mur-i ka-a šu eš2-la2-a

Many sentences on this tablet also occur on Tablet #36, the story of The
Great Fatted Bull, and on tablet SEM 114, the story of The Great Fatted
Jackass. In this transliteration, I don’t point out all of the occurrences
because there are so many of them. I mention them only when they are
relevant to the discussion at hand.
This line is lacking a verb meaning "to place" the food in his mouth, so I
used the verb from
the corresponding line on Tablet #36 (r4). Du3 means "to drive in", which
in the context of the sentence is interpreted as "to cram". He crams the

The first part of this sentence is written da-ĝu10, “my flanks” but I
translated it as da-ĝu10 lu, “my flanks grow fat” because that’s the way it’s
written on Tablet #36 (line r5). The lu sign is missing in the above
sentence. On both tablets, lu (defined as “abundant”) means
“to be fat”.
Gu3: “to cry out, often said of animals”. The definition of this sign changes
depending on which animal is mentioned. A bull bellows, a lion roars, a
donkey brays, etc.
o7 ĝi6 dim2 sa2-sa2 ni2-ba nigin na-ta utul2 gug2-munu4 ir-ir

Ir = plunder/steal. The sentence is written “a man is plundering a bowl of
malted cakes”, but I translated it as “a man is stealing a bowl of malted
cakes”. “Plundering” is more meaningful
in the context of the tablet, but “plundering a bowl of malted cakes” would
be confusing for a first-time reader.

MahX (AL/mah2) is the trick sign on Tablet #36, the story of The Great
Fatted Bull. It is used to obscure the “king” context of the story, as
explained in line o3 of the Transliteration. It is also used on SEM 114, The
Great Fatted Jackass, in line o1.

For a description of all the trick signs on the tablets, see Sumerian Trick
Signs.
o8b kiri3 kiri3- mu5 la-ba-ni-ur la2-la2-{e}
nose nose- fatted not-his-servant throttle
Variations of this sentence occurs on all three tablets (SEM 114, r8 and
Tablet #36, r8). On Tablet #36 the phrase is written kiri3 kiri3, “nose to
nose”, but in the above sentence it is written kiri3 kiri3-ni, where ni is the
suffix for “his”, meaning “nose to his nose”. This would be the normal way
to translate the phrase. However, ni is completely unnecessary because
both noses are “his nose”, as it were, since two men are fighting. In this
sentence, NI is actually mu5, meaning “good, beautiful, pleasing, plump”,
and rarely, “fatted”. The scribe had to get “fatted” in there somewhere.
After all, this is the story of the Great Fatted Donkey. But the scribe uses
the lesser known definition of NI (mu5) to get the message across, rather
than the usual niga (fatted), which would be too obvious.

gaba-ri, "enemy", as written on
this tablet and on Tablet #36.
This line appears word-for-word on Tablet #36, but on BE 31,28 it has a
slight difference.
There is a small vertical mark added to gaba. It’s a very minor difference,
but it’s enough to change the definition of the sign. With the added mark,
gaba becomes isin, meaning “stalk”. Stalk doesn’t make any sense in the
sentence, making it confusing for the reader. It also “hides” the enemy
(gaba-ri). In a way, the enemy disappears completely behind that one
single stalk. Now there’s no enemy in the sentence, only a stalk, so the
reader would not guess that la2 in the previous sentence actually means
Transliteration for The Princess Wife about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/534001.html
7 of 16 8/18/2020, 3:40 PM



“to throttle”. In a normal sentence,
la2 has a dozen other meanings that would make more sense in the
context of a stalk
(“small, light, hold, carry”, to name just a few). So, without an enemy in
this sentence,
it’s unlikely that anyone would correctly guess the meaning of “throttle”
for the sign la2. Fortunately, I was able to easily read the above sentence
because it is written correctly on Tablet #36. Otherwise it would have been
a struggle to decipher this sentence if I was reading it for the first time.
Without an enemy in this sentence, there is no conflict. Without a conflict,
the overall context of the tablet becomes difficult to discern, making it
harder to translate the tablet. When I was trying to translate Tablet #36, a
big breakthrough occurred when I realized there was a
conflict in the story, so I was able to correctly interpret the signs by using
this context.
On this tablet, the conflict is obscured by the simple addition of one little
mark.
It's not like the scribe didn't know any better. He wrote the same sign
(du8) correctly at the end of line o14.
o10 munu4 šu4 gu7 ĝeš-ur3 ne ? [maḫX gu7-ka be6] ud?!

I drove myself crazy looking for a sign that looked like the first one in this
sentence. Then I realized it is really just two signs joined together. The
first sign is actually a simplified version of munu4, "malt", as shown on
CDLI P392795. The second sign is U (šu4, "totality, all").
It seems I would have learned my lesson the first time, as explained in line
o4 above.
I translated the rest of the line as, “This great eating to diminish!” because
that’s the way it is written on Tablet #36 (line r10). The last sign in this

o13 ta-a-aš šag4 ba/zu! mahX lugud2

zu, as it appears in line r2
zu!: A variation of this sentence occurs on Tablet #36. It is written šag4
zu mahX lugud2,
“his stomach knows a great reduction”, meaning "a great hunger". In the
above sentence, zu seems to be written as ba, but it is actually zu. The
scribe uses a very simplified version of zu in line r2, with only one interior
vertical line, as shown on the above left. The scribe omits the vertical line
for the sign in the above sentence so that it looks like ba.
As explained in o9, the scribe adds a mark to gaba so that it looks like isin.
Now the scribe omits a line on zu so that it looks like ba. The scribe does
this several times on the tablet. That's why many signs in the line-drawing
are denoted with a "!", meaning "written wrong".
Of course they could all be scribal errors, but I believe they're done
deliberately to obscure
the meaning of the text. Sometimes the scribe adds a mark, (gaba o9, dim2

o20, and še r9). Sometimes he omits a mark (zu o13 and zuh r6). They are
all signs that are written correctly elsewhere on the tablet.
It's just a little something something here and there to keep the reader off
balance.
The scribe of Tablet #36 does something similar. On four out of five
occurrences of gu4 (bull), the sign is missing the vertical mark,

o17 u4-da-am3 mu-lu ab-ba ba-an-tu dal/dirig en
storm-like PN father PN fly/supreme lord
RI = dal/dirig = fly/supreme.
Dal is a verb meaning “to fly”. If used as such, the verb is awkwardly
placed in the sentence, almost at the end of the line with just one sign
dangling after it. Another interpretation is that the sign is a seldom-used
Transliteration for The Princess Wife about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/534001.html
10 of 16 8/18/2020, 3:40 PM



alternative definition for dirig, an adjective meaning “supreme”.
In this case it would apply to en (lord), meaning “supreme lord”. But if it’s
used this way,
then the sentence is lacking a verb.
I doubt that it’s a scribal error, that the scribe simply forgot to add the
verb. I believe the sentence was deliberately written this way to make it
difficult to read. I also think the scribe fully intended for the sign to do
“double duty” as both a verb and an adjective, so that’s
the way I used it: “Like a storm Mulu flies to his father Bantu, the
supreme lord.”
In Sumerian, if a syllable begins with the same letter that the previous
syllable ended with, then the syllables merge together. Thus, Ba-an-tu
becomes Ban-tu.

In o16, nunusX-a is written with the sign a compressed between nunusX
and lu, as if it had
originally been omitted and then squeezed in afterwards (as shown in the
third sign from the left, denoted by the ! ). As a result, the sign a looks like
three vertical strokes. These same vertical strokes appear after the sign
kar! (te-a), even though there is plenty of room to draw the sign a
correctly. I don't know if was carelessness on the part of the scribe or if it
was done to obscure the meaning of the sign kar.

translates as “the lord
gave you these stones (beads)”.
.
Sam2/še-am3: The sign sam2 is composed of the sign ninda, which forms
the outer shell, and the internal signs of še-am3, as shown below. In the
above sentence, only the signs
še-am3 appear. Perhaps the scribe omitted the ninda portion of the sign,
intentionally or not. On the other hand, the corresponding line on SEM
114 reads "še 1{diš} sila3", which translates as "grain 1 unit" (še is the sign
for grain) as the selling price for each bead. So perhaps the above line
should read "1 each [unit of] grain" for each bead. Take your pick.
r4 bi sam2-sam2 aĝ2-(ES, niĝ2)-ne pisan-sur3# [x,...]

At the end of the corresponding line on SEM 114 (r7) there appears to be a
damaged and compressed version of šaḫ2, meaning “pig”, which leads me
to believe that the half basket contains “pig slop”. Mulu "eats his food like
a pig" and so does Lu-mah on Tablet #36.
r5 u3 za-e zu- nu nunusX e-ne-[eĝ3#? (ES, inim)] [...]

I translated this line as, "You don't know women", but with the trick

nu-nus, this line could easily be translated as, "You don't know beads."
Both translations fit perfectly in the context of the story, and I believe both
versions are the intended meanings
of the signs. That is why I used both versions in the translation..

written as lu2 gu3 ir, “man who cries out (bellows) for plunder”. In the
above sentence, it is clearly written as
lu2 saĝ ir. It is also written this way on r10 of SEM 114. With saĝ it could
be translated as “he who is a person who plunders”, which is awkward
sounding. So I translated it as zuh, which means “to steal”, i.e., “man who
robs and plunders”, because it sounds better and it does not change the
meaning of the sentence. The sign was probably miswritten to obscure the
meaning of the sentence. KA (gu3,zuh) and saĝ are essentially the same
sign, except ka
has a few more interior marks. As mentioned before, the scribe adds or
omits marks on a sign to keep the reader off balance.
Munus-kin: Munus means “woman”, kin means “work”. I suggest
munus-kin means “prostitute”. This is described in detail on a separate
page. See Munus-kin on this website.

Še/mu: In the line-drawing, this sign is clearly written as mu: “Mulu

which suggests that the princess wife is giving Mulu’s fields to both Mulu
and Zuzu.
I find this to be highly unlikely. There’s no way that the wife is giving
Mulu half of his fields;
she barely wants to give him a half basket of pig slop. Plus, it doesn’t make
sense that the
wife is giving back to Mulu what he already owned, which she has already

taken from him.
Besides, this would shortchange Zuzu, who is her co-conspirator, and who
clearly expects
to get all of the fields. On the other hand, if you ignore the horizontal line
in mu, the sign
looks like ŝe (grain), so the sentence would read Mulu gana2- ŝe-lu Zuzu,
which translates
as “Mulu’s abundant fields of grain” that are given to Zuzu. This makes
sense because Zuzu
is being given Mulu’s fields as a reward for his part in the conspiracy. It is
written this way
to obscure the meaning of the sentence, just like all the other instances
where the scribe
slightly alters the signs with the addition of a single mark.
r10 libir za-e lu2 mah#? lu me en

Mah, "great": This damaged sign may be a compressed version of mah,
but I'm not too sure about it. In the meantime, it is simply a "place saver"
until I figure out a different interpretation of the sign, if indeed there is
one.

The use of three identical signs in a row (with different meanings) occurs

Tablet #36. They also occur three times on this tablet, twice in this
sentence alone, and once
in r8. They are intended to make the tablet difficult to read. This is the
only instance where three signs in a row mean three different things
(instead of just two, like other examples).
Mur means "fodder", hur means "forever" and "ever again". The "ever
again" adds a nice
twist to the end of the story, suggesting the events have happened before,

Sign list for tablet BE 31,28
4-5 minutes
Princess Wife
This page provides citations to support my transliteration of tablet BE
31,28. The page is intended for anyone interested in cuneiform studies
who wishes to verify that my translation
of tablet BE 31,28 is correct. There's nothing of interest on the page for the
general reader,
so you can skip it without hurting my feelings.
This is an abbreviated sign list. I didn't include an example of every sign
on the tablet,
as I did for the Tablet #36 Sign List. There are a couple of reasons for this.
First, Tablet #36
was my first translation, so I needed to prove my abilities in terms of "sign
recognition".
BE 31,28 and SEM 114 are my second and third translations respectively,
so I have already demonstrated my abilities and there's no need to belabor
the point. Second, on this tablet there are not many "compressed signs",
like on Tablet #36 (the signs are simplified to make them easier to write,
and shortened to save space on the line). Compressed signs

are difficult to recognize for someone who is only familiar with the classic
cuneiform script.
On this tablet, most of the signs resemble their ePSD fonts and they are
easy to read.
For this sign list, I include only the compressed signs and a few others that
are written
in a very simplified, abstract way. The scribe often doesn't include all the
details of the signs, which makes them somewhat difficult to read.
For each sign, I provide a picture of the ePSD font, followed by an example
from the tablet.
I also provide an example (or two) from other tablets on the CDLI.
Click on the given line number (e.g., o2,4 for obverse (front of the tablet)
column 2, line#4, or r5 for reverse (back) line 5) to see a line-drawing of
the tablet with the sign highlighted in red. To check on the transliteration
of a sign, click on the CDLI's “P” number, which links to the
tablet’s page on the CDLI, and it will show the sign name in the given line
number. It may be necessary to click on “View line art” to see the line
drawing of the tablet. Note: on the CDLI, š is written as sz, ĝ is written as
just g, and ḫ is just h.

gemeX (geme2) = female servant or slave. GemeX is a trick sign. It is
written with just two reverse cunei, instead of the usual three, so that it
looks like gu, "cord". This was done to help disguise the meaning of the
text, as explained in Sumerian Trick Signs. GemeX also appears in line o2
of SEM 114, the story of The Great Fatted Jackass, and on Tablet #36, the
story of The Great Fatted Bull, as shown by the two signs on the right.
lum = satisified, manure. Only in Sumerian could you find a sign that
means both "satisfied" and "manure". P368394 o10 P252228 o2
nu-nus (nu-nuz) = woman. It would be difficult to write this sign within
the narrow lines of a tablet, so the scribes found a simpler way to write it. I
was unable to find a line drawing of
nu-nus on the CDLI. On the right is nuz (nus) by itself, as seen on CDLI
P227751, line o4,12.
Nu-nus is the trick sign on BE 31,28. For an explanation, see Nu-nus.

sam2 = purchase, barter. I was unable to find any line-drawings of sam2

Sumerian Trick Signs
27-34 minutes
Methods used by Mesopotamian scribes to conceal the context
of political satires
MahX
Introduction:
Three unusual cuneiform tablets were discovered about a hundred years
ago. Many of the
best Sumerologists in the world attempted to translate the tablets, but
without success.
I suggest they were unable to read the tablets because the scribes didn't
want them to.
The scribes deliberately encoded the tablets to make them difficult to read.
That's because
the tablets are actually political satires. At the time, Mesopotamian kings
were worshiped
as living gods, so making fun of them was a risky proposition. The scribes
therefore needed
to be very careful about it. In this article, I willl describe the many
ingenious ways that the
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
1 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



scribes concealed and obscured the “secret context” of the satires, making
the tablets
very difficult to decipher (but not impossible). These methods include, but
are not limited to,
puns, “trick signs”, and clever wordplay.
A trick sign is a sign that is written to deceive. Its purpose is to make a
tablet difficult to read, to hide the secret meaning of a satire. Trick signs
appear on three different tablets:
Tablet #36 The Great Fatted Bull
BE 31,28 The Princess Wife
SEM 114 The Great Fatted Jackass
Tablet #36 was acquired by the Library of Congress in 1929 and labeled
“incomprehensible”.
Tablet BE 31,28 was found by the Babylonian Expedition of the University
of Pennsylvania
in 1893. Stephen Langdon first attempted to translate it in 1914. He
thought it was a
Dialogue between Two Women, but he could not offer a complete
translation of the tablet
so he did not publish it. Edward Chiera first attempted to translate tablet
SEM 114
in the early part of the twentieth century, but he could not read the tablet.
Modern Sumerologists can read anything written in the Sumerian
language, and yet they
could not read these three simple tablets. That's because the scribes didn't
want anyone
to read them. Modern Sumerologists, trying to resurrect an ancient dead
language, are not the only ones who would have difficulty trying to
decipher these tablets. Even a Sumerian scribe could not easily read them.
These tablets were deliberately designed to be difficult to read because
they are political satires about great lords and kings. Tablet #36 is the
story of
The Great Fatted Bull, the bull who would be king. BE 31,28 is The
Princess Wife, the story of the Great Fatted Donkey and his wife, and SEM
114 is The Great Fatted Jackass.

The stories are variations of the same theme and they have many of the
same sentences
in common.
Mocking the ruling class was a dangerous thing to do (and it’s still a
dangerous thing to do
in most of the world today). Sumerian kings were worshiped as living
gods, so they were not the least bit amused when people made fun of
them. In the story of The Great Fatted Bull,
the shepherd gets flogged when he ridicules Lu-mah for wanting to be
worshiped as a god.
In the ancient world, ridiculing the nobility simply wasn’t tolerated. Back
then, a lord knew
that if he allowed himself to be publicly ridiculed he would not remain a
lord for long -
because it undermined his authority. A ruler could not run his kingdom if
he was the object of public ridicule. So anyone who openly insulted a lord
or a king was severely punished, and possibly killed, as an example to
everyone else. There was no talk about “freedom of speech” or “civil
rights”. There were no legal niceties. Punishment was swift, violent, and
merciless. History is littered with the bodies of men who thought they
could get away with mocking the ruling class. (from The Scribe on this
website)
So if a scribe wanted to write satirical story about great lords and kings, he
had to be very circumspect about it. He didn’t want anyone to causally
read the story and then report him
to the authorities. To prevent this from happening he needed to somehow
disguise or obscure the context (subject) of the satire. This was done
through the use of trick signs, puns, and clever word play.
This kind of encoding was easier done in Sumerian than in English. In
Sumerian, “context
is everything” because all the signs have multiple meanings and
pronunciations. In English, written words are instantly recognizable. This
wasn’t true for Sumerian writing. A scribe
did not read a line of text, he translated it. He first scanned the signs in a
line of text; then,
if he knew the context of the sentence, he could eliminate the many

alternative meanings
of the signs and select only the definitions that made sense within the
given context
(imagine trying to read this sentence if every word had up to a dozen
different meanings
and pronunciations). If the context of the writing wasn’t known, it was
difficult to read
even a simple Sumerian sentence, even for another Sumerian.
It was easy to make a tablet unreadable because Sumerian writing is
barely readable
to begin with. If a scribe wanted to obscure the meaning of a tablet, the
simple and obvious method was to arbitrarily change some of the signs.
For “king”, write “dog”; for “plunder”,
write “bark”, and so on. This could make a tablet incomprehensible, and
only the scribe
would know its intended meaning. The scribes of the three tablets
discussed here take a different approach. They didn't want to make a
tablet completely unreadable. Instead, they write a story in a way that
makes it incomprehensible to the casual reader, but they provide
all the necessary clues for a diligent reader to eventually decode the tablet.
A few trick signs strategically placed can obscure or disguise the over-all
context of a tablet.
For instance, mahX disguises the “king” context of Tablet #36. Without
knowing the context
of the tablet makes it nearly impossible to decide which of the multiple
meanings of a sign
is the one being used (there can be up to a dozen different meaning for
each sign).
As described in the transliteration of Tablet #36, I spent months trying to
figure out the tablet
without making any visible progress in the translation. After I decoded
mahX and deciphered
the “king” context of the story, then I finally started to understand this
enigmatic tablet.
Within the context of a political satire, all of the signs suddenly made
sense.
Without this context, none of them did. This also explains why the tablet
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
4 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



was encoded
in the first place – to disguise the secret meaning of the satire. Since many
of the same
trick signs are also used on BE 31 28 and SEM 114, the translation of these
tablets was relatively easy for me (in as much as any Sumerian translation
can be considered “easy”)
even though they fooled numerous experts during the past 100 years.
The beauty and brilliance of these scribal tricks is they all make perfect
sense once you understand them.
To understand these tablets, you cannot read them too literally because
the scribes are
trying to trick the reader. You have to keep an open mind about it, to
think, “This is what
the scribe is saying, but what does he really mean?”
The scribes use five different methods to obscure the context of a political
satire:
1. Puns: signs that are puns for other signs. The signs are pronounced the
same, but they are written differently and they have different meanings.
2. Trick Signs: signs that are slightly altered so they look like other signs.
These signs have different meanings that do not fit into the context of the
sentences.
3. Wordplay: signs with definitions that are used in ways for which they
were never intended.
4. Punning with numbers
5. Emesal Dialect: used to make the tablets more difficult to read.
6. Double Rulings: disguises the nature of a tablet.
Some of the trick signs I have denoted with the subscript number “X”, e.g.,
mahX for mah2. Subscript numbers are modern conventions used to
indicate the different definitions of a sign. The “X” not only stands for an
unknown subscript number, it also means “mysterious” because the signs
were written to deceive.

Part of line o3 on Tablet #36
On Tablet #36, the first two signs of the first readable fragment of a line is
a hint to the
"hidden context" of the satire. The two signs are lu2-AL. Lu2 usually
means “man”, but AL
is more problematic (the capitalized sign name is used when it is not yet
known which of
its many meanings and pronunciations is the one being used). The sign is
used persistently and intrusively throughout the text, as if the scribe was
deliberately over-using the sign for some unknown reason; which seems
rather odd, because this ubiquitous sign is completely bewildering in every
sentence where it appears. Al is most often used as a “grammar sign”,
as a Compound Verb Nominal Element, to be precise, but this definition
doesn't fit into any
of the sentences.
AL (mah2) and mah.
One of the secondary definitions of AL is mah2, an adjective for a "mature,
milk producing cow". Mah2 refers to any female animal that has given
birth and is therefore capable of producing milk. I briefly considered it as
a possible translation for the sign, but I immediately discarded it because
it would be completely nonsensical in any sentence where it appeared.
However, the important thing about mah2 is that it's pronounced like mah
(the numerical subscripts of a sign are "silent", so mah and mah2 are
pronounced the same). Mah means “great, supreme, large, majestic”, etc. I
define mahX as the sign mah2 (cow) written to mean mah (great). As per
the pun meaning of mahX, the signs lu2-mahX can be translated as
"man-great". On this tablet, lu-mah is synonymous with the sign lugal
(man-great) meaning "lord or king". This is the secret context of the satire:
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
6 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



lu2-mahX = "man-great" = lugal = king. Lu-mah is the name of the Great
Fatted Bull. It is a name that describes his role in the story while at the
same time hiding his identity.
Even if mah2 is initially considered as a possible translation for the sign, it
would be immediately discarded as nonsensical (man dairy cow?) and so
the pun would be lost, and along with it, the hint to the secret context of
the tablet. This is the beauty and the genius of this sign (pun). Even if the
reader guesses the correct pronunciation of the sign, he does not believe it
because it is the wrong definition. In my opinion, it's very clever.
MahX is both the lock and the key to this tablet. It obscures the true
meaning of the text
(the lock), but once it's understood it reveals the hidden context of the
satire (the key),
which makes it possible to read the other signs on the tablet. The repeated
use of mahX
is like the tumblers of the lock. A key doesn't work until all of the tumblers
are in place.
When one single word fits in all eight sentences, only then does the tablet
finally open up
and its true meaning is revealed. As previously mentioned, I could not
translate the tablet
until I deciphered lu2-mahX.
MahX occurs multiple times on Tablet #36 (see lines o3, o7, o8, and r14).
Several “compressed” versions of the sign (that looks a lot like rah2) occur
in lines o11, r7, r10, and r11, where the word “great” fits seamlessly into the
context of the sentences. MahX is also used on BE 31,28 (lines o8, o13,
and o20) and on SEM 114, line o1. In all these examples, mahX (mah2,
“cow”) is written to mean mah, “great”.
MahX is described in greater detail in the Transliteration of Tablet #36.
Nunus, nu-nus, and nu-nus the way it is normally written
Nunus (one word) means “an egg or an ovoid bead”. Nu-nus (two words)
usually means “woman”. With two signs stacked on top of each other, it
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
7 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



would be difficult to fit nu-nus within the narrow lines of a tablet, so
naturally the scribes found an easier way to write it, as shown on the right.
NunusX is the most important trick sign on BE 31,28. I define nunusX as a
pun that means either “woman” or “not woman”.
Nu-nus is Emesal dialect for munus, meaning “woman”. Munus is the sign
most commonly used to mean “woman”. Nu-nus is rarely used. There are
3,065 citations for munus
on the ePSD and only 14 citations for nu-nus. The scribe uses this rare
sign to obscure the meaning of the text. The scribe also deploys the sign in
a very unusual manner. In line o16,
nu-nus is written simply as nunus. Since it is written at the very beginning
of the line, there is no pretense about including the nu portion of the sign.
This is a hint that the scribe intends
to use the sign this way (without nu) to mean “woman”. The scribe is using
the pronunciation
of nunus to mean “woman”, rather than the literal signs for nu-nus. The
sentence begins,
“Women in abundance...”
NunusX is mentioned a second time in line o16. It would be tempting to
read this sign as
nu-nus, “woman”, but it's a trick. Nu is also the Sumerian sign for
negation (no, not, without). In this case, nu-nus means “no woman”. The
entire sentence reads, “While the women live in abundance, Mulu has no
power, no women, and no virtue.” (See line o16 and note the recurring
appearance of the sign nu.)
NunusX also occurs in Iine o5. Now the nu negation applies to the
preceding sign, zu, meaning “to know”; i.e., Mulu “knows-not women”.
The signs may also mean that Mulu "knows-not beads (nunus)". Both
interpretations could easily apply to the context of the sentence.
Nu-nus occurs again in the very next sentence (r6). This is the only time
that the sign is
used correctly. In this case, nu-nus means what it is supposed to mean;
i.e., “woman”.
The line translates as, “All women are a prostitutes for men who plunder.”
The unusual way that nu-nus is used makes it difficult to translate the

tablet, and it makes the meaning of the text ambiguous, which was the
intent all along. The scribe is trying to confuse the reader. If the scribe
wanted to make his meaning clear, he would have simply used munus,
which is the standard sign for “woman”. That way there would be no
confusion. Instead, the scribe uses nunusX (nu-nus/nunus) to keep the
reader off balance.
Sipad, su8-ba, and su-ba
Sipad is the usual sign for "shepherd". Su8-ba is the lesser known Emesal
form of sipad. On the ePSD there are 2,641 citations for sipad, but only 25
for su8-ba. The scribe of Tablet #36 takes it a step further by using a pun
at the sign level, making it into su-ba. It is pronounced like su8-ba, but it
is unrecognizable as a "shepherd". Su-ba is the name of “the shepherd
brother”, the hero of the story. Like Lu-mah, the name of the Great Fatted
Bull, it is a name that describes the character’s role in the story while also
hiding his identity. The shepherd's identity is concealed because Sumerian
kings were often called the shepherds of their people; so by disguising the
shepherd, the "king" context of the tablet is also obscured.
2. Trick Signs:
Gu has two vertical lines, but it often written with only one, as shown on
the right.
Geme2 normal BE 31,28 Tablet #36 SEM 114
GemeX is a trick sign for geme2, meaning “a female servant or slave”. It is
a trick sign because it is written with only two reverse cunei instead of the
usual three. With just two reverse cunei, it looks just like gu, meaning
“rope or cord” The sign geme2 is disguised because people would be
interested in reading a story about slave women, but the scribe doesn't
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html

want anyone to read the tablet. Any story about slave women is bound to
be interesting, but who wants to read a story about cord? By hiding the
“slave woman”,
gemeX also helps to obscure the “lord and king” context of the satire, since
lords and kings (and possibly rich merchants) are the ones most likely to
be the owners of slave women.
GemeX is used four times on Tablet #36. Needless to say, gu (cord)
doesn’t fit into the context of any of the sentences. GemeX is also used on
BE31,28 (lines o12 and r1) and on SEM 114, line o2.
Gu4: normal, compressed, and the way it appears on Tablet #36.
Gu4 is the sign for “bull, ox”. On Tablet #36 it is written in its compressed
form, but it is also missing the vertical stroke. As written, the sign could be
interpreted as 2(eše3) or the Old Babylonian version of bi. The sign
2(eše3) is two of a particular unit of measure and it is meaningless in the
context of the sentences. The Old Babylonian version of bi is a sign that
has been stripped of most of its identifying structure, as part of the
process of simplifying the signs. It did not appear until very late in the Old
Babylonian period when lots of other signs were simplified almost beyond
recognition, which is not the case on this tablet. Gu4 is one of the simplest
of the Sumerian signs (it looks like a pictograph of a bull’s head) and it is
half of the context of Tablet #36, and yet it is miswritten four times out on
five. It is written correctly only once (at the end of line o8 where it is
written the smallest, crowded into the margin of the tablet) as a hint to the
true meaning of the sign. It is not a scribal mistake; it is used solely for the
purpose of concealing the “bull” context of the tablet. As a result, I had
great difficulty discerning the bull context of the story, which would have
been obvious if the signs were written correctly.
Gal-niga
When I first translated line o5 of Tablet #36, I naturally interpreted the

two signs as gal-niga, “great-fattened”. I noticed that the signs were a bit
unusual because the horizontal line of gal
is longer than normal, completely bisecting the niga (še) cluster of reverse
cunei. I didn't
pay much attention to it because I thought the signs were written this way
to save space on the line. Besides, in cuneiform writing it is easy to
accidentally write a horizontal line longer than intended. This can be seen
on many tablets, and it also occurs at the end of line r10 where the
horizontal line of be6 is much too long. I later discovered that in rare
instances
the sign gi4 is written in a way that looks a lot like gal-niga, as shown
below.
Gi4 and a rare variant
Here gi4 is written without the two vertical lines that distinguish the sign.
It is also written
with the še cluster instead of the simple linear strokes usually found on
gi4. As a result,
this version of gi4 looks just like gal-niga, so perhaps someone could read
the signs on
Tablet #36 as gi4 instead of gal-niga. Gi4 is nonsensical in the context of
the sentence,
rendering the entire sentence unreadable. If the scribe did indeed write
gi4, it means he
used the super-simplified version of gi4 that looks exactly like gal-niga to
trick the reader
into thinking it is not gal-niga.
The sign IN
Like all Sumerian signs, IN has a variety of meanings, but it is most often
used as a
“grammar sign”; for instance, a “third person singular pronominal

element”.
Henbur2, and henburX as written on Tablet #36.
Henbur2 grain is the edible parts of a reed or rush. I define henburX as
any sign that uses IN to mean “grain-his”, or any modification of the sign
henbur2 that makes it look like IN. HenburX is used extensively on Tablet
#36 and on BE 31,28. It makes sense that henburX is used to hide the
“grain” context of the tablets because these stories are all about grain,
which symbolizes wealth and plunder.
On Tablet #36, the scribe uses the IN cluster of reverse cunei for the sign
henbur. It should have the še (grain) cluster, but then again, the scribe
uses eight different versions of še in signs like zid, li, gal-niga, kur9, etc. As
written, henbur looks a lot like IN, but with only one vertical stroke. Of
course it could be three scribal errors, but it seems unlikely that the scribe
would mistakenly write IN this way in the exact three places where henbur
fits perfectly into the context of the sentences. IN is meaningless in these
sentences, both in terms of grammar and context.
HenburX "grain-his" on BE 31,28.
On BE 31 28, a different variant of henbur X is used. It is basically a pun
meaning “grain-his” (the second part of the sign is the possessive suffix
“-ni”, which translates as “his/her”. This version of henburX occurs twice
in line o12, as seen below:
HenburX on line o12 on BE 31,28
The translation is “wife his grain-his decide servant-her slave cut twig
this grain-his get”.
IN does not fit into the sentence’s grammar or context.

"HenburX-his" on BE 31,28.
A different variation of henburX is used in line o14. This version uses the
ŝe (grain) cluster
of reverse cunei, plus the “-ni” suffix for “his”, so it would be tempting to
read the sign as
“grain-his”, like the two examples from o12. However, notice that the sign
is followed by a-ni. This is the word for “his”, as opposed to the suffix –ni,
which also means “his” (I know, Sumerian can be very confusing). If the
first sign is readd as “grain-his” and it's followed by a-ni, “his”, then the
phrase translates as “grain-his his”, which of course is incorrect. In this
particular case, the first sign is actually a variation of henbur, like the one
used on
Tablet #36, with a slight difference:
Henbur, henburX on Tablet #36, and henburX on BE 31,28, line o14.
On Tablet #36, henburX has the incorrect IN cluster of reverse cunei,
followed by the correct single vertical stroke. On BE 31 28, henburX has
the correct še cluster of reverse cunei,
but it has the incorrect two vertical strokes.
Gaba/isin
Gaba-ri means “enemy/adversary”. It occurs in the sentence, “The lord
opens his mouth
and swears two oaths to his adversary.” This sentence appears word-for
word on BE 31,28
(line o9) and Tablet #36 (line r9). On BE 31,28 there is a slight difference.
A small vertical
mark is added to gaba. It is a very minor difference, but it's enough to
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
13 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



change the definition
of the sign. With the added mark, gaba becomes isin, meaning “stalk”.
Stalk doesn't
make any sense in the sentence, making it confusing for the reader. Plus, it
also “hides”
the enemy (gaba-ri). In a way, the enemy disappears completely behind
one single stalk.
Now there is no enemy in the sentence, only a stalk. Without an enemy in
this sentence, there is no conflict. Without a conflict, the overall context of
the tablet becomes difficult
to discern, making it harder to translate the tablet. When I was trying to
translate Tablet #36,
a big breakthrough occurred when I realized there is a conflict in the story,
so I was able to correctly interpret the signs by using this context.
Fortunately, I was able to easily read the sentence on BE 31,28 because I
already read it on Tablet #36 where it's written correctly. Otherwise it
would have been a struggle to decipher the sentence on BE 31,28 if I was
reading it for the first time. On this tablet, the conflict is obscured by the
simple addition
of one little mark.
The scribe of BE 31,28 makes extensive use of this technique. He
arbitrarily adds or deletes
a mark on a sign to change its meaning. Sometimes he adds a mark (gaba
in line o12
becomes isin, and še in line r9 becomes mu). Sometimes he omits a mark
(zu in line o13 becomes ba, and zuh in line r6 becomes saĝ). These are all
signs that are written correctly elsewhere on the tablet, so they are not
scribal errors. Their purpose is to obscure the meaning of the text. Their
true meaning can be discerned by the context of the sentences in which
they appear. As previously mentioned, context is everything.
3. Scribal Wordplay:
Lu
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
14 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



One of the methods that the scribes obscured the meaning of the texts was
to use signs
in ways for which they were never intended. For example, lu normally
means “to be/make abundant”, but on Tablet #36 it means “to make fat”
as seen in line r5. It's also used this way on BE 31,28. Mu-lu, the name of
The Great Fatted Donkey, means “man-abundant” – abundant in size and
possessions, meaning “fat and rich”. Like Lu-mah and Su-ba, it is a name
that describes the character’s role in the story while also hiding his
identity.
Du8
Another similar example of this kind of wordplay occurs in line r14. Du8
normally means
“to amass”, but the scribe uses it to mean “to grow fat”. Lu-mah’s fatness
is a symbol of
his greed.
i=5
The first sign on the left is i, likewise for the second sign. It is a commonly
used sign, but it is not a number, it's a word, one that has no meaning that
fits into the context of the three sentences where it appears. That's because
the scribe uses it to represent the number five.
5(aš) which is written horizontally (unlike the vertical diš format shown
below) always uses a
3-2 combination, as seen in the third sign. On Tablet #36, a 2-2-1
combination is used
to represent the number 5. In a line of text, the sign would naturally be
interpreted as i, which is meaningless in the context of the sentence,
causing some confusion, which helps to obscure the context of the tablet.
On the other hand, the "five" interpretation of the sign fits perfectly in all
three sentences where it appears: field 5, pasture 5, and 5 big bowls.

15 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



4(diš), ĝar, and 4(diš)
On the left, the number 4 is written in the vertical format, unlike the 5(aš)
horizontal format
shown above.The middle sign appears in line r11 on Tablet #36. It looks
just like 4(diš),
but it is actually the word ĝar, meaning “to place”. The sign for ĝar is often
written this way.
The sign on the right occurs in line r14. On a literary tablet which thus far
has no numbers
(the number 5 had previously been disguised as i), it would be logical to
again read this sign
as the word ĝar, but it is actually 4(diš) !! The scribe of Tablet #36
arbitrarily switches the
number formats to keep the reader off balance. He puns with numbers for
the same reason
that he puns with words, to obscure the meaning of the text.
5. Emesal Dialect:
Another method employed by the scribes to obscure the meaning of the
text is the heavy use of the Emesal dialect. As shown in the previous
discussion of sipad and nu-nus, Emesal words are the uncommon
variations of common Sumerian words. One example is umun on
BE 31,28, line o4. Umun (U) is substituted for en, the common sign for
“lord”. The ePSD has umun defined as the Emesal sign for en, and it has
1,631 citations for en, but there are no citations for umun, which shows
how rare it really is. On the other hand, the ePSD has 19 other definitions
for U that are more likely choices than umun. The scribe disguises the lord
(en) with umun at the beginning of the tablet where the reader is looking
for the context of the story. The scribe later uses en at the end of the story
(line r10), but by then the reader is totally confused because he does not
know the context. Of course, the reader can eventually figure out the
Emesal words, but at the beginning they impede the reader’s
understanding of the text.
6. Double Rulings:

16 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



Tablet #36 (reverse) showing three double rulings.
The scribe of Tablet #36 uses “double rulings” to disguise the nature of the
tablet.
A double ruling is two lines drawn between sentences instead of just one.
The lines
denote a division between paragraphs. The scribe uses five double rulings
on the tablet.
They do not delineate any major divisions in the story, so there must be
another reason
for them. Double rulings are often used to separate unrelated items of
text; for example,
a collection of proverbs. The double rulings on Tablet #36 would trick the
Sumerian Trick Signs about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/566201.html
17 of 19 8/18/2020, 3:41 PM



reader into
believing there are five different segments rather than a single cohesive
story. Double ruling
is also used extensively on administrative tablets. This is probably one of
the reasons why
Tablet #36 was originally classified as Administrative rather than
Literature (I also thought
it was an administrative tablet when I first saw it). The scribe fooled
everyone into thinking
Tablet #36 is just a boring clerical tablet that is dull to read, and not a
literary tablet
(and political satire) that is fun to read.
Conclusion:
As previously mentioned, I spent months trying to decipher Tablet #36
until I realized
the scribe was trying to trick me by disguising the satirical nature of the
tablet. Since
many of the same trick signs are also used on BE 31,28 and SEM 114, and
both tablets
have the same hidden context of a political satire, the translation of these
tablets was
relatively easy for me. That's because I was no longer fooled by scribal
tricks. I read
the tablets differently, I did not read them too literally, as the
Sumerologists had done,
because I knew the scribes were deliberately trying to mislead the readers.
I'm convinced that somewhere out there is a tablet about The Great Fatted
Goat,
to complement the stories of The Great Fatted Bull and The Great Fatted
Jackass.
That would be an interesting story because it would be very sexual. I
suggest the
most interesting tablets are the ones where the scribes felt compelled to
hide the
secret meaning of the story because it is too political, or too sexual, or
both.

I would suggest there many tablets that are currently unpublished, or
untranslatable,
or “incomprehensible”, that are actually readable if you don't get fooled by
scribal tricks.

Nu-nus trick sign
4 minutes
A “trick sign” is a sign that's written to deceive. It's designed to make a
tablet difficult to read, to hide the secret meaning of the story. Nu-nus is
the most important trick sign on BE 31 28, the story of The Princess Wife.
In this way, it is much like mahX on Tablet #36, the story of The Great
Fatted Bull. Both tablets use many of the same trick signs, but nu-nus
appears only on BE 31 28.
nunus: It means "egg" or "an ovoid bead".
Nunus, normal (left) and compressed (right).
As two signs stacked on top of each other, it would be difficult to fit nunus
within the narrow lines of a tablet, so naturally the scribes found an easier
way to write it, as shown above.
nu-nus munus
Nu-nus trick sign about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/577601.html
1 of 3 8/18/2020, 3:43 PM



The word on the left looks like it should be pronounced as nu-nunus,
since it is composed of the signs nu and nunus, but it is pronounced
simply as nu-nus. Nu-nus is Emesal dialect for munus, meaning “woman”.
Munus is the sign that is most commonly used to mean “woman”. Nu-nus
is rarely used. There are 3,065 citations for munus on the ePSD and only
14 citations for nu-nus. The scribe uses this rare sign as a way to help
obscure the meaning of the text. The scribe also uses the sign in a very
unusual manner.
nu-nus (normal) and the way it appears on BE 31,28
On line o16, nu-nus is written as nunus. Since it's written at the very
beginning of the line,
there’s no pretense about including the nu portion of the sign. It’s a hint
that the scribe intends to use the sign this way (without nu) to mean
“woman”. This led some modern Sumerologists to translate the sign as
nunus, “egg” rather than nu-nus,”woman”. The scribe is using the
pronunciation of nunus rather than the literal signs for nu-nus. It's very
clever.
Nu-nus is mentioned a second time in line o16. It would be tempting to
read this sign as
nu-nus, “woman”, but it’s a trick. Nu is also the Sumerian sign for
negation (no, not, without).
In this case, nu-nus means “no woman”. The translation of this phrase is,
“... Mulu has
no power, no women, and no virtue.” (See line o16 and note the recurring
appearance of the sign nu.)
Nu-nus trick sign about:reader?url=http://sumerianshakespeare.com/533701/577601.html
2 of 3 8/18/2020, 3:43 PM



So, does this sign mean “no woman” like the one above? Not exactly. Now
the negation
applies to the preceding sign, zu, meaning “to know”; i.e., Mulu “knows
not women”.
(See line r5.) The signs could also mean that Mulu "knows-not beads".
Both meanings fit perfectly into the context of the sentence and the
context of the story, as explained in line r5
of the Transliteration.
Nu-nus occurs again in the very next sentence (r6). Okay, so now we are
accustomed to the scribe’s tricks. This sign means “no/not woman”,
right? Wrong. This is the only time on the tablet that the sign is used
correctly. In this case, nu-nus means what it’s supposed to mean; i.e.,
“woman”. The line translates as, “All women are a prostitutes for men who
plunder.”
The unusual way that nu-nus is used makes it difficult to translate the
tablet, and it makes
the meaning of the text ambiguous, which was the intention all along. It is
a subtle indication that the scribe is trying to confuse the reader. To make
the meaning clear, the scribe would have simply used munus, which is the
standard sign for “woman”. That way, there would be no confusion.
Instead, the scribe uses nu-nus/nunus to keep the reader off balance.
It's brilliant the way the scribe uses this sign, absolutely brilliant.
