The intention of this essay is to provide simple and easy to understand overview of periods from Hittite and Macedonic most ancient history and culture. It avoids substantial and detailed explanations that consider wider historical background of the described events and persons, and is written primarily for those approaching the topic for the first time. It also avoids complex explanatory comments or insightful footnotes on the citations from the sources. The given explanatory notes are prevalently etymological.
The introduction comprises the periods from ancient history of Asia Minor and Macedonia, and presents a brief overall retrospective of advent of Hittite Empire in the second millennium BCE. The time-frame elaborated as a main theme of this essay ranges from the beginning of the 7th century of the second millennium BCE until the 8th-7th century of the first millennium BCE. The interpretations given here are meant to enhance our understanding and appreciation of the first civilization. They are focused strictly on the Hittite-Macedonic aspect of the story disregarding the wider geo-political perspective.
All the dates and references to centuries are „BCE“ (Before the Common Era). Throughout this essay, Macedonia/Macedonians generally refer to the area of the mainland north of Mount Olymp (lat. Olympus), southeast of the Mount Šar (lat. Scardus) and west of the Rhodope Mountains. Macedonian peninsula refers to what is called „Balkans“ as of the 19th century, occupying the part of southeastern Europe that lies south of the Danube and Sava rivers and forms a peninsula bounded by the Adriatic and Ionian seas in the west, the Aegean and Black seas in the east, and the Mediterranean Sea in the south.
Latinized/Anglicized or Macedonic names are given in parenthesis, some names and technical terms are transliterated and these will be obvious when they appear. Other technical terms and titles (e.g. Kartchemish, Iraklids, etc.) have been transliterated directly from their original forms with as few changes as possible: thus Irakle rather than „Heracles‟, and Kartchemish rather than 'Carchemish', which is neither English nor Latin.
The terminology and concepts that are modern inventions (such as 'Hellenistic' or 'Greek') are altogether avoided. Such empirically wrong terms, used improperly by the modern historiography, were originally meant to describe totally different categories (such as the artistic periods) and were unknown to the ancient world. Their continued use perpetuates misleading assumptions.
The modern-historiography 'privileged moments' are largely avoided too. For example - for historians today one such a privileged moment (of places and monuments as 'clasical') is 'Clasical Athens', the Athens of the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. But when and why is so regarded? Was 'Clasical Athens regarded as “Clasical” already in antiquity? By whom?
The definitions, current meanings and related concepts of the words in English are taken from the Oxford American Dictionary and Thesaurus (Mac OsX version 1.0.2 for PowerPC) and/or Meriam-Webster online dictionary. For the transliterated words in Macedonian is used the online ENCYCLOPÆDIA MACEDONICA (MAKEDONSKA ENCIKLOPEDIJA) vol. 1 & 2, and online Macedonian dictionaries (idividi.com, off.net, etc.).
The sources that were used are listed in the References at the end of this essay.

Hittites
(comparing Khita/Khatti and Kittim)
In the dictionary about the Hittites we find the following definition: ...ancient people who established an empire in Asia Minor and Syria that flourished from ca. 1700 to ca. 700 BCE. This thousand years lasting civilization had left behind numerous archaeological and linguistic monuments and artifacts, and we are at the very beginning of truly understanding their importance and real meaning. The excavations on the site of Karčemish (Anglicized „Carchemish‟)1, and the recognition of the important part once played by the Hittites, have revolutionized our conception of early history, and given us a knowledge of the religion and culture, the languages and inner life, of the old nations of the Eastern Mediterranean.
Ethnically the Hittites were in no way connected with the other inhabitants of Palestine and Syria. Their closest kin were the Phrygians (today Armenians) who also migrated to Asia Minor from the Macedonian Peninsula at the close of the 2nd millennium BCE (around 1300 BCE). It is generally presumed that the Hittites also migrated across the Hellespont and Bosporus straights into Anatolia from somewhere to the north. The time of their arrival is also uncertain, although to allow time for the linguistic differentiation between the sister languages Hittite, Luwian, and Palaic it has been suggested by comparative linguistics that these first Indo-European Aryan groups were in Anatolia by around 2300 BCE. They were the first group of people known to history that break away from the big family of Рroto-Indo-Europeans, also known as Pelasgians, Hyperboreans, Barbarians (i.e. Barb-Aryans), Danubian or Aegean-Central Balkan civilization2, Old Europe, etc. They were the first farmers and cattle herders in human history, the big lean
1 “Kart ” meaning „town‟, which is common to the Hittite Kartchemish and the Phoenician Carthage (directly related to Macedonic word for town/city - „Grad‟ and/or Sanskrit-Hindi „Gad‟); further: “che”- diminutive particle /če/, and “Mish” (Miš) - a mouse, thus the Kartchemish – the “town of the mouse,” i.e. „Mouse city‟, “Gratče-miš” in plain Macedonian. Similar animistic correspondence is to be found in the Macedonian city of Prilep [archaic] - the „Bat‟ (city), „Govedartsi‟ – „Bovine‟(city), Volkovo - „wolf‟s‟ (village), Konyare - „horse‟s‟ (village), Buf - „owl‟ (village), etc. 2 The „Old Europe‟; see “Gods and Godesses of Old Europe 7000-3500 BCE” by Maria Gimbutas.

forward of the humanity achievements that started some 12,000 years ago, after the ending of the last Ice Age. They are the prehistoric ancestors of the Aryans that arrived as far as India in several migration waves, the last of which was that incredibly titanic campaign of Alexander the Great of Macedon in the IV century BCE.

The very name “Barb-Aryans” (i.e. Barbarians), unexpectedly discovers their distinguished noble origin, as the prehistoric populace which gave the birth and forged the first known civilization. They gave the names to the early Indo-European terminology, going back - with the Macedonian rearrangement - to the characteristic Indo-European terms of cultural vocabulary. This Pre-Indo-European linguistic substrate is the source that influenced the Proto-Macedonic language, and later the Upper High Macedonic and Old Macedonian (later renamed „Old Church Slavonic‟), and has a very



9
peculiar linguistic role in the whole Indo-European language family. Importantly, certain number of evidences show that the mountainous Upper Macedonia region (i.e. Paionia) was the cradle-area praised as the Macedonian ancestral homeland. Regarded as country of giants - Peloros, situated to the north of the coastal Lower Macedonia. A country that gave the first deified ancient kings, the fathers of gods and Belasgians (lat. Pelasgians). This was also the ancient legendary “Hyperborea” mentioned above, before the distances of the old world were shortened by the more developed means of transportation and communication.
Below: the Pelasgian homeland according to different ancient authors
Gradually these prehistoric Hyperboreans/Pelasgians/Barb-Aryans, wave after wave, avenged from the Aegean Sea coasts and Macedonian Peninsula inland, and in several big migrations crossed Asia Minor, Mesopotamia, and further. It‟s important to underline the Hittite constant relations between Asia Minor and their primordial original homeland in the Macedonian Peninsula inland, as from prehistoric times, from where they expanded starting with the 3rd millennium BCE, during the migration period known as the Great Aegean Migration. It was the time when the very first proto-nations emerged from Neolithic oneness of the still primitive hunter-gatherers. Contemporary populations in northwestern and northeastern Europe will remain lagging behind and still didn‟t developed social concepts larger than their closest proper communities of hordes.

On contrary, according to archaeologic, linguistic and genetic researches, it was exactly in Macedonian Peninsula where the exceptional civilization development events kicked of for the first time, spanning some 12,000 years ago. Their first big migration before and during the 3rd millennium BCE remained remembered only through the popular narrative and mythology3. Thenafter at the beginning of the 2nd millennium BCE they migrated again as Naši (i.e. Hittites), then again in the 9th century BCE as Brygians/Phrygians, and finally under the lead of Alexander the Great in the 4th century BCE (as Macedonians) they settled again across the Asia Minor, Persia and Egypt, and reigned whole eastern Mediterranean for the next two and a half centuries.
Across the straits of the Bosphorous and Hellespont in the second half of the third millennium and beginning of the second millennium BCE the Naši (i.e. Hittites) poured into Asia Minor, and in the following centuries next to Cappadocia they established a magnificent and impregnable capital at Hatuša4, a vast fortress-city sprawling over the rocky terrain, with craggy citadels and elaborate temples. These first Arians put an end to

Hercules), and much later by Alexander III of Macedon. 4 The only plausible and comparable etymology is the one linked to the Macedonic-Russian noun “Katuša”[pronounced Katyusha] a diminutive of Catherine; see Ekaterineburg.

the Assyro-Babylonian cruel supremacy. Even more, many historians link the “Hyksos”5, i.e. the people who invaded Egypt and settled in the Nile delta ca. 1640 BCE, with the Naši/Hittites. They formed the 15th and 16th dynasties of Egypt and ruled a large part of the country until driven out ca. 1532 BCE.6
Afterward these migrations of the Macedonic people transformed into quite regular periodic movements back-and-forward from Macedonian Peninsula toward east, and contributed to the overall civilization development in Asia Minor in rather exceptional ways.
A striking testimony of the profound connections and original ethnic oneness of the Hittites and Macedonians is the particular apotropaic lustration custom, a rite of purification by passing the whole army, headed by their king, between the two separated раrts of the sacrificed dog cut in half.7 Practiced by Macedonians before war campaigns, or regularly in the dog-month of Perit 8, according to the ancient Macedonian calendar, this flagrant animalistic-magical ritual of purification is firmly reported by the ancient sources as common Hittite/Macedonic custom par excellence. Ritual‟s name “Peripetia”

See also Billie Jean Collins “The puppy in Hittite ritual (1992). 8 Lat. “Peritios” which now corresponds to the modern Julian-calendar month of January; today “Pess” - „dog‟ in plain modern Macedonian; see also Spanish “Pero” - „dog‟, remnant of the ancient pre-Latin Iberian idiom.

survived until modern times, but it lost its original meaning, and now is only Macedonian word for „a thrill‟. In the Hittite ritual of the Routed Army9 we see a typical dog-severing ritual: if the troops are defeated they must pass through a “gate” made of haw-thorn. The purpose of the gate with its thorns is to scrape off the impurity from the offerants as they pass through. The halves of the severed animal were placed on either side of the thorny gate, in order to absorb the impurity that falls from the passerby. It had been also suggested by some scholars that the passing between the two pieces of a severed dog was actually an admonition, as what awaits the army if they don‟t act united and strong.
Another particularity that bonds Hittites and Macedonians is the nationality color of their army uniforms. As testified from the reliefs from Egypt in the time of Ramesses II, which show the battle at Kadesh, the Hittites are depicted in white coverall – still the same color of the Macedonic soldier uniforms in the 4th-3rd centuries BCE.
Further, the Bible gives us a glimpse and another confirmation on the continuity and connections of the Hittites with their oversea Macedonian homeland. Namely, Hittites of the Bible are the Khita of the Egyptian monuments, the Khatti of the Assyrian cuneiforms, and the Kaιτειοι (pronounced Kay-tei-oi) of Homer. On the other side of the Aegean Sea the Macedonians of the Bible are the Kittim.10 This is far from semantic
9 Thus named by some Hittite scholar, although the logic of this assumption it is not clear. 10 In Dan. XI.30 the Macedonians are mentioned under the name “Kittim” (RV), and Eusebius and the Hebrew Josephus or Gorionides (Knobel, "Völkertafel," p. 103) use the same designation. The First Book of the Maccabees, which originally was written in Hebrew, also

coincidence, as Hittites (Naši) and Kittites (Macedons) of the second millennium BCE were one and the same, just being divided by numerous later historical constructions made by different authors, religions and politics. Linguistic affinities are undeniable, and even after 3000 years there are ancient Macedonic/Hittite words that are equal and still in use in modern Macedonian.
The Homeric name for the Lydians as Maiones is also indicative to this avail - Maiones homonymously can be compared only to the Paiones, yet another Macedonian tribe (i.e. Macedones) par excellence.11
Hittite toponyms in Asia Minor also underline their origin from Macedonian Peninsula. Λσκαονια (i.e. Lukaonia, an older name of Arcadia) corresponds to Hittite province of
uses the word “Kittim” for Macedonians, and mentions Philip and Alexander (I.1), as well as Philip III and his illegitimate son Perseus (VIII.5), as kings of the Macedonians. http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10238-macedonia 11 Maiones can only be compared with Paiones (i.e. “Upper-Ionians”; compare also Ionia, Paionia and Ionian sea). The /a/ in this form shows that the Homeric /η/ continues as long /ā/, the form which must be of Macedonic origin (a Dorian origin is improbable). This means that the oldest form was Maiones. Koine suffix -on indicates /him/, i.e. peoples in plural Kilkon(es), Migdon(es), Makedon(es). And also, Homer mentioned the Maiones immediately after the Phrygians, again another Macedonic tribe par excellence, with origins in Upper Macedonia.



14
Lukkā in Asia Minor; Πεδαζοζ (Pedasos, a city in Thessalia) corresponds to Petaša in central Anatolia, etc.
The last but not the least important and firm testimony of the Phrygian/Hittite continuity and heritage, long after the fall of their great empire, is to be found even in the 9th century Eastern Romeian Empire. The 9th century descents of the Hittites and Phrygians that originated from Macedonian Peninsula, the Amorite-Phrygian dynasty, ruled from Constantinople for 47 years.
It was once again the great and solemn period for the reinvigorated Macedonic civilization and its always progressive culture, the true beginning of the medieval renaissance (period that reached the backwater western Europe much, much later). It was exactly at the zenith of this magnificent time in the 9th century when the RomeianMacedonian emperor Michael III invoked the two Macedonian apostles, SS. Cyril and Methodius, on their extraordinary Christianization Mission across the Asia Minor, Eastern, Western and Central Europe. Their medieval popularization of the Glagolic and Cyrillic alphabets was a profound and qualitative literary reform, which expanded into marvelous and unprecedented cultural upheaval and beginning of the renaissance across the Macedonian peninsula and abroad. It is significant to note that the emperor Michael justified his choice by the words: "You two are from around Salonika, and all Salonikans speak pure Macedonic" (Vita Methodii, ch.V).
And, oddly enough for the western politically-biased conventional historiography, and its desperate fragmentation ways of hiding and mismanaging the facts, this prodigious Amorite-Phrygian Macedonic dynasty was succeeded by - Macedonic dynasty.



15
The birth of the Hittite Empire was the result of the epochal battles and fight for living space and territory in the 2nd millenium Asia Minor. The narratives from the Hittite texts reveal a scenario of the rise of the Hittite kingdom with Hattuša as capital: “The grandfather of Hattušili I was a Tabarna (holy king) in the Land of Hatti and his residence was at Sanahuitta. His son Hakkarpili seems to become ruler of Hattuša on request of the Elders of Hattuša. The „grandfather‟ made Labarna12 his heir, many of his sons, such as Pawahtelmah the father of Hatušili I, revolted against this decision. However all the rebels were defeated in a long violent conflict. Labarna with his “Bride from Hurma” allied with Hurma, a kingdom very near Kušara. The grandfather made the father king of Hurma. Hattušili I kept loyal to his grandfather and was adopted as son of Labarna, to become his successor.” The texts of the “Palace Chronicle” often mention the father of the old king at the court of Hurma. Also several other important members of the royal family are described in relation with Hurma: several brothers of Hattušili I, 33 sons of the grandfather, and Lady Hastayar.
12 first known king of the Hittites, before their unification under one aegis.



16
In order to overthrow the previous Assyrian rulers Macedonic Hittites naturally joined their forces under one aegis. The Egyptian monuments show that Hittites, Louvites13, Jebusites and Ama-Urites (Anglicized: Amorites) confederated together at Kadesh on the Orontes. Kadesh was a Hittite stronghold, nevertheless it is described as being „in the land of the Ama-Ur‟.14 The Hittites and Amorites were therefore mingled together in the mountains of Asia Minor and Palestine like the two Macedonic tribes which initially formed the Hittite Empire.
Further north, in the country which the Hittites had made peculiarly their own, cities existed which bore names, it would seem, compounded with that of the Amorite. For example, the common Assyrian title of the district in which Damascus stood, Garamaurit, is best explained as the „Gar of the Ama-Urites‟ (i.e. „Grad‟ of the Amorites).15
Shechem was taken by Jacob „out of the hand of the Amorite‟ (Genesis XLIII.22), and the Ama-Ur kingdom of Og and Sihon included large tracts on the eastern side of the Jordan.
South of Palestine the block of mountains in which the sanctuary of Kadesh-barnea stood was an Amorite possession (Genesis XIV.7, Deut I.19, 20); and we learn from Numb. XIII.29, that while the Amalekites dwelt „in the land of the south‟ and the Canaanites by
13 Now even erroneously renamed into “Luwians” instead of the correct Louvite i.e. Loudite - „the mad ones‟ (Ludite in plain Macedonian). See for example Emmanuel Laroche correct tittle „Dictionnaire de la langue Louvite‟, Paris,1959. For comparison: „Lud-Luv-Love‟ (see Latin Ludus) are from the same IE root word, which describes common abnormal behavior. 14 “Ama-Ur” - sacred cow/bull 15 “City of Amorites”, from Macedonic “Grad” - „city‟ in plain Macedonian, Belorussian, Russian, Czech, Slovenian, Slovakian, Polish, Serbo-Croatian, etc.



17
the sea and in the valley of the Jordan, the Hittites, Jebusites and Ama-Urites lived together in the mountains of the interior. Among the five kings of the Ama-Urites against whom Joshua fought (Joshua X.5) were the king of Jerusalem and the king of Hebron. Mr. Petrie points out their resemblance to the Dardanians of Asia Minor, who form an intermediate link between the white-skinned tribes across the Aegean Seas (see the ancient region of Dardania north of Skopje, the modern capital of Macedonia) and the fair-complexioned Libyans of Northern Africa. The latter are still found in large numbers in the mountainous regions which stretch eastward from Morocco, and are usually known among the French under the name of Kabyles. The traveler who first meets with them in Algeria cannot fail to be struck by their likeness to a certain part of the Macedonic population in Macedonian Peninsula.
An astonishing monument of these undeniable millennial links and relations between the Macedonians and local Hittites and later Phrygians is the one on the Mt. Nemrod, in the late antiquity kingdom of Comaggene in Asia Minor. Here we found the firm testimony of Macedonian king Antiochus the Great, son of the king Mithridates I Callinicus and queen Laodice VII Thea of Comaggene (from the Macedonian dynasty of Seleucids), who erected an enormous sepulchral tumulus with giant statues of gods and inscriptions on which is written as follows: “...all of the father-gods of Macedonia, Persia and our own country of Comaggene will continue to bless their children and their grandchildren...”
Above: the giant sculptures in front of the enormous and still untouched
sepulchral tumulus on the top of Mount Nemrod 16
This firm testimony shows their long lineage from and to Macedonian Peninsula, and the everlasting traditions of their predecessors that was transmitted throughout countless generations, a testimony confirmed also by comparative linguistics and genetic researches.

It is curious that wherever this particular branch of the white Macedonic race has extended it has been accompanied by their particular form of giant cromlechs, or sepulchral chambers, built of large uncut stones. The stones are placed upright in the ground and covered over with other large slabs, the whole chamber being subsequently concealed under a massive tumulus of small stones or earth. Frequently the entrance to the cromlech is approached by a sort of corridor. This ancient sepulchral chambers continued to appear well into the classic era of the antiquity (like the one on Mt. Nemrod), and are found all over the Macedonian Peninsula, but during the later period their construction became more sophisticated and made of precisely cut stone slabs.

History of the Hittites
The Hittites called themselves Naši - „ours, kin‟ in plain Macedonian17, and their language Našili.18 Their 1000 years period of dominance is divided into three periods, labeled the Old Kingdom (1700-1500 BCE), the Middle Kingdom (1400-1175 BCE) about which there is relatively little information, and finally a New Kingdom (1175-708 BCE). The historical records of the incessant continuity of Hittite cultural and civilization achievements are carved in stone, by means of a hieroglyphic (or pictographic) inscriptions on seals and other numerous archaeological monuments and artifacts discovered in the last years.
Above: Hittite rhyton in a form of fist
The Hittites are the “White Syrians” of Strabo, whom the ancient geographer contrasts with the “Black Syrians” of Semitic Aram (pp. 533, 544, 737. Cf. Schol. ad Apoll. Rhod. I. 948). Pindar (Fr.150, ed. Bergk) speaks of “a spear-armed Syrian host” at the mouth of the Thermodon (compare Herodotus II.104), the river on whose banks dwelt the Amazons, the Hittite priestesses of their goddess. But these „Syrians‟ were really the
17 https://recnik.off.net.mk/recnik/makedonskiangliski/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%B8* 18 It is incorrect that it is called the “Hittite” language, because the men of Anatolia, or any other people in the Bronze age in that time period had never heard of the word “Hittite”. Hittite is a western borrowing of the old Hebrew term „hittÎm/kittim‟ used in the Bible, which is by the way also a clear exonym-designation for Macedonians (a fact already mentioned above in the footnote on page 12).

Hittites, so called as coming from the country known to the Danaans from Egypt as „Syria‟19 (see also Herodotus VII.72). Strabo also states that the language of the Kataonians was the same as that of the “White Syrians.”20
Above: spear was the weapon of choice of Macedonians throughout millennia
An early ruler in the second half of the 18th century BCE, Anitta, left records indicating his achievements, such as capturing Hattuša, but he did not created an empire or found a dynasty. The period after him was characterized by internal struggles for power. Then the Old Kingdom was established by king Huzziya and his adopted son Labarna (ca. 16801650 BCE), which is only the title of him, his name remains unknown. Thus, Labarna I, the heir of the grandfather and his successor the grandson Hattušili chose the stronghold Hattuša, as their base to resist the rebellion against them, i.e. the Labarna I (holy king) and his Tawananna (holy queen) are remembered as the first dynastical rulers of Hattuša.
Hittite king Hattušili (1650-1620 BCE) consolidated the kingdom and extended its control over most of Asia Minor and Northern Syria. His grandson Mursilis I raided down along the Euphrates river and conquered the Amorite kingdom of Babylon, then one of the most cosmopolitan, rich and cultured cities. The austere highlanders felt out of place and far away from Hattuša and returned to their capital. Then for some time they

got embroiled in their own affairs and re-emerged as the new Hittite Empire in the 14th century BCE. Under Suppililumas I it reached the height of its power, extent and culture.
Above: Hittite soldiers from a relief in Kartchemish
As the later Proclamation of Telipinu (1525-1500 BCE) indicates, in the Old Kingdom beginning with the rule of Labarna and his successor Hattusilis I (ca. 1650-1620) the chief aim was to gain control over the various Hittite groups and consolidate the kingdom. The grandson and successor of Hattusilis, Mursilis I (ca. 1620-1590), conducted raids as far as Babylon. Telipinu proclamation goes on to indicate that he expected and maintained cooperation and peacefulness during his reign. But from the century after his death we have few records; hence little is known about this period, labeled the Middle Kingdom.
Then during the Middle Kingdom, roughly 1400-1180 BCE, the Hittites reached their greatest status under Šuppiluliuma I (ca. 1350-1320). Šuppiluliuma rebuilt the capital at Hattuša and reorganized the government; he also carried out campaigns against peoples in south and southwest Anatolia and established a Hittite presence in Syria that led to conflict with Egypt. Tusharatta, the last independent Mitanni king, defeated the Hittites first time around, but Šuppiluliuma I then went north and east, taking Wassukkanni by surprise. Tusharatta escaped to Kartchemish, but the Mitanni power was broken and its glory came to an end. Šuppiluliuma put his sons as kings of Aleppo and Kartchemish.

Letters from Šuppiluliuma I to the pharaons Amenhotep III and his successor Akhenaten are preserved in the Amarna Letters, among them one having to do with Mitanni. Egypt had formerly been a strong ally of the Mittani, and the withdrawal of Amenhotep III‟s support for the Mitanni king Tushratta left Šuppiluliuma I free to do as he pleased in the region.
Hittite king Muwatalli I (1320-1307 BCE) fought in 1295 BCE at Kadesh (in Syria) one of the greatest battles of ancient times against the pharaon Ramses II Miamun. It was



24
probably a draw, even though the latter claimed a victory. After the battle a peace treaty was signed and a marriage alliance concluded.
Below: the Battle of Kadesh, a sketch from an Egyptian stone relief
It is worth mentioning the name of the local king of Wiluša – Alaksandu, or Alaxandu, who also was an ally of Muwatalli at that time. His name it is a historic reminder of the Macedonic-Hittite millennial uniqueness, found again in the 5th and 4th century BCE, almost 900 years later as the very same name, but of incomparably more renown and famous Macedonian kings, of which Alexander III the Great was the most supreme example.
During the rule of Muwatalli II (ca. 1306-1282), there was another tremendous battle between the two countries at Kadesh on the Orontes River; the result was chaos and carnage, but both sides proclaimed victory -- after hastily withdrawing from the area. Later, under Hattusilis III (ca. 1275-1250), the two countries arranged a peace treaty and



25
a dynastic marriage. Then during the rule of Tuthalija IV (ca. 1250-1220), problems arose especially with the country of Ahhija (or Ahhijawa), often equated with the Mycenaeans. Early in the next century the kingdom was utterly destroyed and its capital city, like Troy before it, was burned. Vestiges of Hittite imperial power survived for a while in Syria, and other Anatolian languages were attested throughout the first millennium BCE, but the Hittite language died out and Anatolia remained fragmented for four centuries.

The decipherment of the inscriptions of Egypt and Assyria has poured a flood of light on Hittites character and origin, and their own monuments have been discovered not only in Syria, but also in Kappadokia and other parts of Asia Minor. Hittite Empire was the first in all the world's history in several civilized acts. The first mention made of the Hittites in any record, other than the Bible, is in an inscription of Sargon, king of Agadé, which is of the age of Abraham. At this time they were already troublesome to the Mesopotamians. In their memorable transaction with Abraham, when he purchases from them for a burying-place at the time of Sarah's death, the cave of Machpelah, we find them engaged in the first money transaction on record, making out the earliest title deeds, and effecting the earliest transfer of land.
The Egyptian monuments represent the Hittites as beardless, while their Syrian allies are bearded, as fighting three in a chariot, and as wearing boots that turn up at the toes.
This last characteristic indicates again their origin from the Macedonian Peninsula highlands, where leader shoes of that shape (called „Opintsi‟ in plain Macedonian) are even today convenient in traveling through the snow. They are still produced on a large



27
scale across whole Macedonian Peninsula, but mainly as traditional shoes for the folklore dancing ensembles, or as souvenir for the tourists.

From the Egyptian and Assyrian records we know that they excelled in the beauty and swiftness of their chariots. The use of these chariots, as well as of horses, in battle was further borrowed from the Hittites by other nations. And it is not by chance that the ones who made the next huge step forward in enhancing the cavalry warfare on higher level were of Macedonic descent too - Filip II and Alexander III of Macedon.
From the same monumental records we know, too, that the Hittites used just such sophisticated metal work as Schliemann found in the ancient ruins at Hissarlik, thus confirming their oneness across Aegean region even in metallurgic deeds. In the same battle of Megiddo just referred to, Thothmes III takes among the treasure a great flagon with a double handle, a work of the Khal. By “Khal” are meant the Phoenicians, they being then the naval power of the Hittite empire. The enumeration of the spoil in this battle includes, besides the prisoners, mares, chariots, iron suits of armor, bows, swords, precious stones, golden dishes, great water-gutters, gold rings, ivory, ebony, cedar wood, chairs, footstools for the same, tables, statues, iron vessels, and one plough inlaid with gold.
Naharina was the Biblical Aram Naharaim or „Syria of the two rivers,‟ better known as Mesopotamia, and its situation has been ascertained by recent discoveries. It was the district called Mitanni by the Assyrians, who describe it as being „in front of the land of the Hittites,‟ on the eastern bank of the Euphrates, between Kartchemish and the mouth of the river Balikh. In the age of Thothmes I, it was the leading state in Western Asia. The Hittites had not as yet made themselves formidable, and the most dangerous enemy the Egyptian monarch was called upon to face were the people over whom Chushanrishathaim was king in later days (Judgement III.8). It is not until the reign of his son, Thothmes III, that the Hittites come to the front. They are distinguished as „Great‟ and „Little‟, the latter name perhaps denoting the Hittites of the south of Judah. However this



29
may be, Thothmes received tribute from „the king of the great land of the Kheta/Khatti‟ which consisted of gold, black slaves, men-servants and maid-servants, oxen, etc.
But, neighbors so powerful could not remain long at peace. A fragmentary inscription records that the first military campaign of the Egyptian pharaon Thothmes IV, the grandson of Thothmes III, was directed against the Hittites, and Amenophis III, the son and successor of Thothmes IV, found it necessary to secure himself by entering into matrimonial alliance with the Hittite king of Naharina (i.e. Mesopotamia). The widow of Tutankhamon did not feel in beneath her dignity to ask king Šuppiluliuma of Hatti for on of his sons as her new husband.
In the Assyrian inscriptions the district of which Damascus was the centre is called GarEmeriš, and since the name of the Hittite capital Kartchemish is written Gar-Gamiš in the Assyrian texts, it is possible that Gar-Emeriš was a Hittite title signifying the „City of the Amorites.‟21
21 “Gar” - corrupted transcription of the Macedonic term “Grad”- city, from the verb “gradi”- builds, (Latinized „gradus‟); see Ivangrad, Leningrad, Stalingrad, Stuttgart, Višegrad, Volgograd, etc.

Hittite-Macedonic symbols
This marriage of the Hittite princess had different unexpected consequences for Egypt. The new queen brought with her not only a foreign name and foreign customs, but a foreign faith as well. She refused to worship Amon of Thebes and the other gods of Egypt, and clung to the religion of her forefathers, whose supreme object of adoration was the (winged) Solar Disk, i.e. the veneration of the primordial Creator Sun-God. From the earliest times this primordial deity was associated with the universe and was worshiped as the supreme creator of all life and sunlight. The ancient symbols representing the sun, like the swastika, the winged solar disk, the „flower of life‟, etc. are the most diffused and earliest found archaic venerated objects across the whole planet earth. In certain ways the sun-symbols are all similar, but some similarities are more striking and fascinating than others. That‟s the case of the Hittite symbols striking resemblance or sameness with ancient Macedonian symbols.

22 also commonly known today as “the flower of life”; most probably symbolizing the sun, or a two-dimensional bronze symbol-imitation of a pine cone from the tip of the Thyrsus, i.e. the Bacchic staff carried by Dionis and his Macedonic followers.

34
The Hittite monuments bear strong witness to the prevalence of this worship in Northern Syria and Asia Minor. The Winged Solar Disk also appears above the figure of a king that holds two lions in his hands, on the relief which has been stolen by the British Museum from Birejik on the Euphrates; and even at Boghaz Keui, far away in Northern Asia Minor, the Winged Solar Disk has been carved upon the rock by skilful Hittite sculptors.
Above: relief of Suttarna, son of Kirta, king of Mittani
The symbol of the Ѕolar Disk with wings is the Aedicula, a symbol of Hittite royalty. In Hittite inscriptions it is regularly supported by two pillars. Note the two eagles perched on the backs of the two lions. The symbol of the Winged Sun mounted on a pillar appears to be the prototype of the kaduceus, heralds staff, later adopted as a symbol of Hermes, the messenger of the gods. This symbol got wrapped with snakes and later became the emblem of the medical profession (caduceus). Also a snake appears adjacent to the Aedicula. Similar Solar Disks were objects of adoration among the Phrygians, and their predecessors Brygians and Paionians back in Macedonia.

Amenophis IV, the son of Amenophis III, was educated in the faith of his mother, and after his accession to the throne endeavored to impose this new Hittite-Macedonic creed upon his unwilling subjects. The powerful priesthood of Thebes withstood him for a while, but at last he assumed the name of Khu-n-Aten – „the refulgence of the solar disk‟ and quitting Thebes and its ancient temples he built himself a new capital dedicated to the new divinity. It stood on the eastern bank of the Nile, to the north of Assut, and its long line of ruins is now known to the natives under the name of Tel el-Amarna (of the AmaUrites, i.e. Hittites). The city was filled with the adherents of the new creed, and their tombs are yet to be found in the cliffs that enclose the desert on the east.
Above: The seal of the king Mursili III



36
Its existence, however, was of no long duration. After the death of Khu-n-Aten, 'the heretic king‟, his throne was occupied by one or two princes who had embraced his faith; but their reigns were brief, and they were succeeded by a monarch who returned once more to the religion of his Egyptian predecessors. The capital of Khu-n-Aten was deserted, and the objects found upon its site show that it was never again inhabited.
Among its ruins a discovery has recently been made which brings an unexpected light upon the history of the Oriental world in the century before the Exodus. A large collection of clay tablets has been found, similar to those unearthed from the mounds of Nineveh and Babylonia, and like the latter inscribed in cuneiform characters and in the Assyro-Babylonian language. They consist for the most part of letters and dispatches sent to Khu-n-Aten and his father, Amenophis III, by the governors and rulers of Palestine, Syria, Mesopotamia and Babylonia, and they prove that at that time the protoMacedonian was an international language, and the complicated cuneiform system of writing the common means of intercourse, of the educated world. These tablets were transferred by Khu-n-Aten from the royal archives of Thebes to his new city at Tel elAmarna. We learn from them that the Hittites were already pressing southward, and were causing serious alarm to the governors and allies of the Egyptian king. One of the tablets is a dispatch from Northern Syria, praying the Egyptian monarch to send assistance against them as soon as possible.
Nevertheless, the Hittite 'heresy' of Khu-n-Aten brought trouble and disunion into Egypt, and his immediate successors seem to have been forced to retire from Syria. So far from being able to aid their allies, the Egyptian generals found themselves no match for the Hittite armies.



37
Egyptian sources further tell us that Ramses I, the founder of the 19th Dynasty, was compelled to conclude a treaty, defensive and offensive, with the Hittite king Saplel (“Weaver” in plain Macedonian), and thus to recognize that Hittite power was on an equality with that of Egypt. From this time forward it becomes possible to speak of a Hittite Empire. Kadesh was once more in Hittite hands, and the influence formerly enjoyed by Egypt in Palestine and Syria was now enjoyed by its rival. The rude Hittite mountaineers of the Taurus had descended into the fertile plains of the south, interrupting the intercourse between Babylonia and Canaan, and superseding the cuneiform characters of Chaldaea by their own Hittite-Macedonic writing. From henceforth the previous common language ceased to be the language of diplomacy and education.
With Seti I, the son and successor of Ramses I, the power of Egypt again revived. He drove the Bedouin and other marauders across the frontiers of the desert and pushed the war against Hittites deep into Syria itself. The cities of the Philistines again received Egyptian garrisons; Seti marched his armies as far as the Orontes, fell suddenly upon Kadesh and took it by storm. The long war has now begun between Egypt and the Hittites, which lasted for the next half-century. It left Egypt utterly exhausted, and glad to make a peace, which virtually handed over again to her rival Hittite empire the possession of Asia Minor. But at first success waited on the arms of Seti. He led his armies once more to the Euphrates and the borders of Naharina, and compelled Muwatalli, the Hittite monarch, to sue for peace.
However, when Seti died the Hittites were again in possession of Kadesh, and war continued between them and his son Ramses II. The long reign of Ramses II was a



38
ceaseless struggle against his formidable Hittite foes. The war was waged with varying success. Sometimes victory inclined to the Egyptians, sometimes to their Hittite enemies. Its chief result was to bring ruin and disaster upon the cities of the Canaanites, which were thrown in between by their miserable destiny. Their land was devastated by the hostile armies which traversed it, their towns were sacked, now by the Hittite invaders from the north, now by the soldiers of Ramses from the south. It was no wonder that their inhabitants fled to island fastnesses, like Tyre, deserting the city on the mainland, which had been burnt not long before.
Ramses II was the Pharaon of the oppression; and the result was a disunited people and a country exhausted by the long and terrible wars of the preceding century.
Later on in Hittite history, when, after the great victorious battle at Kadesh, the ambassadors of their king, Khita-sira, went down to Egypt to negotiate a treaty of peace and alliance, they brought with them a silver plate on which the Hittite text of the treaty was engraved in the Hittite language and characters. This is the most ancient diplomatic act which has come down to us.
The treaty was ratified by the visit of the Hittite king Khita-sira in person to Egypt in his national costume, and the marriage of his daughter to Ramses II Miamun in the thirtyfourth year of the Pharaon's reign (1354 BCE). She took the Egyptian name of Ur-Maa Noferu-Ra, and her beauty was celebrated by the scribes of the court.
Syria was handed over to the Hittites as their legitimate possession and Egypt never again attempted to retake it back. For a time being, the great emperor of the Hittites preserved his power intact, his supremacy was acknowledged from the Euphrates in the east to the Aegean Sea in the west, from Kappadokia in the north to the tribes of Canaan in the south. Even Naharina, once the antagonist of the Egyptian Pharaons, acknowledged his sovereignty, and Pethor, the home of Balaam, at the, junction of the Euphrates and the Sajur, became a Hittite town. The cities of Philistia, indeed, still sent tribute to the Egyptian ruler, but northwards the Hittite sway seems to have been omnipotent. The Amorites of the mountains allied themselves with the children of Heth, and the Canaanites in the lowlands looked to them for protection. It was still possible for a Hittite sovereign to visit Egypt, and for an Egyptian traveler to explore the cities of Canaan.



39
After sixty-six years of vain glorious splendor the long reign of Ramses II Miamun came to an end (1322 BCE). His son and successor, Meneptah, was equally allied with the Hittite Empire. Early in his reign he had sent corn by sea to the Hittites, at a time when there was a famine in Syria, showing that the peaceful relations established during the reign of his father were still in force.
In the following centuries the dynasty of Ramses the Oppressor descended to its grave in bloodshed and disaster. Civil war broke out in Egypt, followed by another foreign invasion, and the crown was seized by Arisu the Phoenician. The great king and pharaon that saved Egypt was Ramses III, who in the meantime rescued his country from two invasions more formidable even than that which had been beaten back by Meneptah. They were conducted by the Libyans and the Sea Peoples of the Aegean, and the invaders were defeated partly on the land, partly on the water. But, then happened another, even more massive invasion of the Sea Peoples. The maritime confederacy this time included the Teukrians of the Troad, the Lykians and the Philistines, the natives of Sardinia (Shardana) and Sicily. They had landed in the first instance on the coasts of Phoenicia, and spread inland as far as Kartchemish. Laden with spoil, they fixed their camp in the land of the Amorites and then descended upon Egypt. The Hittites of Kartchemish and the people of Matenau of Naharina followed the suit and came in their train, and a long and terrible battle took place on the sea-shore between Raphia and Pelusium.



40
The Egyptians this time were victorious again, the ships of the enemy were sunk, and their soldiers slain or captured. Egypt was once more filled with captives, and the flame of its former glory flickered again for a moment before finally going out. The list of prisoners shows that the Hittite tribes had taken part in the struggle, Kartchemish, Aleppo, and Pethor being specially named as having sent contingents to the war. They had probably marched by land, while their allies from Asia Minor and the islands of the Mediterranean had attacked the Egyptian coast in ships.
So far as we can gather, the Hittite populations no longer acknowledged the suzerainty of an imperial sovereign, but were divided into smaller independent states. It would seem, too, that they had lost their hold upon Mysia and the far west. The Tsekkri and the Leku, the Shardana and the Shakalsha are said to have attacked their cities before proceeding on their southward march. Although, if we can trust the statement, we must conclude that the Hittite empire had already broken up before the invasion of the Sea Peoples. The reasons behind the collapse of the Hittite Empire are uncertain, though numerous causes, including ongoing drought followed by famine, plagues, internal disputes, and pressure from external powers are widely recognized as contributing factors.
Persian art and culture, however, as modified at Kartchemish, the Hittite capital, was carried by the Hittites throughout Asia Minor at the time to which the rise of the Persian Iraklid (Lat. Herakleid) dynasty would go back, according to the chronology of Herodotos; and as Kartchemish is called "Ninus Vetus" by Ammianus Marcellinus (XIV. 8; see too Diodorus II.3,7), it is clear that the genealogy given in the text is a legendary reminiscence of the Hittite occupation of Lydia and introduction of civilization and writing among the nations of Europe.
The Iraklids would seem to have grown into power when the Hittite empire began to decay and could no longer support the satraps of Sardes. Irakles, the Sun God of



41
Babylonia and Assyria, the Melkarth of Tyre, had been compatible if not identical with the one used by the Hittites system of worship, like the Asiatic goddess, and then carried into Asia Minor. Hence we find the Lydian name of the deity to have been Sandan (Joh. Lydus, De Mag. III.64), the Sandan, Sandes, or Sandakos23 of the Kilikians and Hittites. With Alkaios, “the strong one,” comparative to the Alkimos of Xanthos.
As to the sway of the Hittites in the lands east of the Mediterranean, we have abundant evidence from the Egyptian and Assyrian inscriptions of its wide extent. By the Egyptian records they are represented as the great leading people of the Upper Ruthen, which term was used to include all the land set down in our modern maps under the names of Palestine, Coele-Syria, and Syria. Their chief fortified cities were Kartchemish (the town of Kemish), Kadesh, and Megiddo. These names play a prominent part in the campaigns of Thothmes III, and Ra-messu Miamen.
But, if the identification of the Hittites with the Hyksos is correct, the rule of this great race extended at one time even farther than Hebron, where we find them quietly settled in the age of Abraham. It extended, in that event, over the greater part of Egypt.
The Egyptian capital of the Hyksos was Zoan. Wright calls attention to the singular entry “apparently superfluous” in the reference to Hebron in the Book of Numbers: “And they (the spies) ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak were (now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)”
There is certainly great significance in an “aside” like this. Is not the inference forced upon us that in the mind of the writer there was some close connection between Hebron and Zoan? This connection Wright believes to be the fact that both were built by the same race, and that seven years after the building of Hebron the Hittites went down into Egypt and took possession of it. Hence, he contends, the inveterate hostility of the Egyptian pharaons to the Hittites after the recovery of their country from the rule of the Hyksos.
Brugsch puts the reign of the Hyksos king Nub (meaning “Gold” in Egyptian), at about 1750 BCE, not many years before the expulsion of the Shepherd Kings. This would accord closely enough with the universal belief of the earlier chronologists that Joseph ruled Egypt as prime-minister under the Shepherd Kings. But whether the Hyksos and the Hittite kings were the same or not, one thing is certain - this great race of Hittites, whom Brugsch describes from the records of their hereditary enemies, as having a just reputation for brave and chivalrous qualities, ruled from the Aegean to the Euphrates, and from the Euxine to the frontier of Egypt some seven centuries before the greatness of Assyria began, some seven centuries before the children of Israel escaped from their slavery captivity in Egypt.
23 Still preserved as Sande, a common Macedonian mail name.



42
The Power of the 1000 Hittite Gods
Loyal to their Macedonic religious traditions and widely renown cosmopolitanism, the Hittites were tolerant in religion questions too, and their polytheism only absorbed the waste indigenous Anatolian, Syrian and Hurrian divinities. The local cults of the conquered people were not forbidden nor threatened in any way, but simply put under the “all inclusive” aegis of the Macedonic world. The very same policy can be equally traced back during the Alexander the Great conquest, when none of the submitted populations had to renounce to their beliefs, gods or temples.
The Hittite Empire was a cultural mosaic formed by many elements from different ethnicities. In a sense, the Hittites formed a cultural bridge between Mesopotamia and the most ancient Macedonian world. Deities from the same category often held different positions resulting from local tradition or different historical oaths of development of particular towns.
In some centers, the Storm-god stood at the head of the pantheon; in other, an important role was played by gods of vegetation and crops having much in common with the stormgods. For example, the Stormgod of the Growth, the Stormgod of the Rain, Stormgod of Clouds, and the Stormgod of the Lightning are attested (Volkert Haas 1970, Der Kult von Nerik, p.101). Thus, the Hittites themselves designated as „the people with a thousand gods.‟ However, they recognized the “twelve gods of the crossroads”, which corresponds again to the overall pattern of Zodiac and other mythologies.
The roots of Hittite complex religion are to be found deep into prehistoric times, in the most archaic animistic cults and rituals, when they were worshipers of the primordial mythical beings, animals, and gods of nature and woods. Аvailable evidence for them are to be found everywhere, but any more precise reconstruction of their particular forces and attributes is highly speculative, and depends on the highly doubtful translations of Comparative Linguistic scholars. However, some of the authentic findings of Macedonic words within the Hittite pantheon vocabulary confirm without doubt their one and same origin. That‟s the case of the Hittite word for „god‟ - “Sius” or “Siun” and “Siunas” („Allwithin-us‟, the „one-in-us‟)24 which corresponds to the Old Macedonian “Sviyu” - „of all‟;25 “Vsiyati/Sviyati”- „all-saints‟ (both from the archaic verb/predeterminer “Siya”„shines‟ and “Svi/Sive/Vsive/Vsite”- „all‟); also the medieval god “Svyatovid” - the „Bright/all-seeing‟; “Vselena/Vasiona/Svemir” (i.e. „All-shiny‟) - the „kosmos‟, etc. Final confirmation of the above said comes from some forty Vedic hymns addressed to “all the gods” with the same word - „Visve devāh‟ (i.e. “All gods”).
24 „Everybody‟ - “Site/Sive” in plain Macedonian, “Sički” in Bulgarian, “Svi/Svih” in SerboCroatian, etc. 25 “Sviyu sviyatih” („Cвию cвятиx' in Old ChurchCyrillic) and/or “Vsih vsyatih”(in Russian) - „all saint(s)‟; both pronunciations are correct, similar as in the Macedonian “Sive”, Serbo-Croatian “Svi”, and Russian “Vsih”, both of which mean „all‟.



43
For the most part the worshipped divine powers were still in animal or vegetal form, or at best anthropomorphic, which is the only clear conclusion about them that can be drawn from the available definitive evidence of the found artifacts.
One such adamant evidence that survived the passage of the millennia, a striking testimony still miraculously preserved throughout countless generations in its original archaic form, is the Macedonian word for „ancient‟, which is “Drevno” and is connected and still has the same meaning with the Hittite/Macedonian word for tree - “Daru” and/or “Drvo” respectively.26 Simply, the trees longevity surpassed the life expectation of the primitive Homo Sapiens for many generations27, and to our distant ancestors it seemed that the trees, which naturally lived for centuries, are almost eternal, and accordingly they related the idea of „ancient‟ to the trees. This primitive concept from the dawn of the humanity, and the word which descended from the term for trees, remained the same in all Macedonic languages until today - Drevno (i.e. Ancient).28
Primeval Deities from the oldest generation of the gods pantheon, were regarded as having been dethroned by the newer generation headed by Tessub, and banished to the underworld. Among them we may recognize A‟a, Anu, Antu,29 Enlil, Ninlil, NaraNapsara, Minki/Munki, Amunki, Ammezzadu, Muntara, Mutmuntara, Aduntarri, Zulki, Irbitiga, and Ishara. They still receive offerings and are addressed in a number of Hurrian rituals translated into Hittite and preserved in the archives of Hattuša. In the present collection of myths they appear in the so-called Kumarbi cycle, first in the proem of the
26 in Russian “Derevo”, Bulgarian “Dervo”, Czech “Dřevo”, Slovak “Drevo”, Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian “Drvo”, etc. Anglicized “tree” has the same root; the word for “Druid” or “Derwydd” also derived from “derw” (pronounced „derroo‟), “Celtic”(?) for „tree‟ and/or „oak‟ (“Dab” in plain Macedonian). These were the woods-priesthood, and presided over the dark mysteries of the consecrated groves. 27 From here also the Macedonic word for „hello/hi‟ - “Zdravo” in plain Macedonian, which simply means „health(y)‟, long live, salute. 28 Russian “Derevnoe, Bulgarian “Drevne”, Czech “Dřevnie”, Slovak “Drevnye”, Macedonian and Serbo-Croatian “Drevno”, etc. 29 Where the „A‟ stands for „1st‟.

This and numerous other animistic and plants-related concepts, numerous totems and idols with animal and floréal features, firmly demonstrate the Hittite-Macedonic continuity in religious and other cultural aspects from prehistoric times until today. The wolf-men (hunters) are regularly mentioned in the Hittite religious rituals. And the wolf was the ancient emblem par excellence of Makedon, the 3rd millennium mythical progenitor of the Macedonians.



45
Above: Wolf, the animal totem of Macedon, prince of Emathia / Æmatia (i.e. “Motherland”, the most archaic known name of Macedonia before him)
Nontheless, the ancient cult of Wolf had survived all these millennia, and it‟s still preserved and celebrated as “The Wolf-day Festivity” in the villages across the Republic of Macedonia on 24 November.
Hittite gods could have different functions in nature. From the Storm God cult of Nerik we know that the god could reach the „Underworld‟ through sources and rivers and that in the „underworld‟ several seas and rivers were situated. The Hittite king, deputy of the Stormgod, was also the commander in chief, chief judge and after death became a god. From the numerous Hittite clay tablets it was discovered that “the (lord) of the thousand” was called “Tabarna”. The term Tabarna was usually the Hittite religious title of a holy king and pointed to the religious function of the kingship. The practice is similar to the use of Alexander. It was accepted that the power of the king came from the gods, and any questioning of this fact was punishable by death. So, the regime of the Hittite Empire can be defined as theocratic monarchy, it reflected the millennial role of the Macedonic kings as intermediary chiefs (“Čelnik” in plain Macedonian) between the gods and Macedonians, a theocratic system that lasted until the fall of Constantinople and Romeian Empire in AD 1543.
There was also the unique Hittite ritual of burning the god(s) in effigy, a custom that was to be found much later in the Phoenicians (as obvious adoption of the older Hittite ritual). The practice was based on a conception of the purifying virtue of fire, which, by destroying the corruptible and perishable elements of man, was supposed to fit him for union with the eternal life in the other world.
The Hittite pantheon shows in reality how complex and intricate was this amalgamated Macedonic/Assyrian/Egyptian styled empire. As the Hittites had three languages/dialects detected so far - Louvite (i.e. Luwian), Našili and Hattian, that much complex was the nomenclature of their gods. Nevertheless, for some reason yet to be fully understand number 12 appears regularly, almost as a rule. There are 12 main gods per group of



46
deities in the Hittite pantheon of gods; 12 main gods within the pantheon of the Hurrians, known as the Biblical “Horites”; the Zodiac‟s 12 houses and the solar system‟s 12 celestial bodies; 12 months; Alexander the Great on the shores of river Hydaspes built monuments of the 12 “Kabiri” gods; the later 12 Apostles of Jesus, etc.
The Hittites “Thousand Gods” was a standard way of referring to the entire pantheon, of whom a staggering number appear in inscriptions, but remain nothing more than names today. This multiplicity has been ascribed to a Hittite resistance to syncretization, as many Hittite towns maintained individual storm-gods, sun-gods and godesses, declining to identify the local deities as manifestations of a single universal figure. The city of Arinna, a day's march from Hattuša, was perhaps the major cult center of the Hittites, and certainly of their major sun goddess, known as “d UTU URU Arinna” – „sun goddess of Arinna‟.
...The olden gods built heaven and earth upon Upelluri. They had a copper knife which they used to cleave the heaven from the earth, after which they stored it in ancient storehouses and sealed them up - only to open them and retrieve it for use on Ullikummi, the stone monster...
Hittite pantheon as follows:
A’a or Aya (the “First-one” in its literal sense) - supreme primordial god of wisdom and guardian of the cosmic law, he is a god over the “Waters”, ruler of “The Lower World”, “Abzu”; he is the keeper of the 'old tablets with the words of fate' (Tablets of Destiny? 'me'?). The Ullikummi‟s myth has him as the father of the Storm-god. comparable to the Mesopotamian god Enki (Ea), and Sanskrit Varuna.
Aduntarri - the diviner, chthonic.
Alalu - primordial entity who in the Kumarbi myths appears as the first king of the gods and father of Kumarbi. Anu served as his cupbearer for 9 years before defeating him and dispatching him to under the earth.
Allani - sun goddess of the earth, she is referred to with the descriptive title “Sun Deity of the Earth”.
Alauwaimi – a demon; properly propitiated with ritual, libation, and goat sacrifice, this demon drives away evil sickness.
Anu - originally a Mesopotamian Sky God, the supreme creator, who in the Hurro-Hittite Kumarbi myths appears as the second king of the gods, the “cup-bearer” of Alalu, and the father of Tešub and his brothers.
Although Alalu was primordial sky-god and king in heaven, Anu was more powerful. He served as Alalu's cup bearer for 9 years and then defeated him, dispatching him to under the earth. He took his seat on the throne and had Kumarbis as his cupbearer. Likewise, after nine years Kumarbis rebelled, chased Anu - who fled in the sky like a bird, and bit off and swallowed his phallus. In this act Anu had some revenge by impregnating Kumarbi with the Storm-god, the Aranzahu (Tigris) river, and Tašmisu. He then hid himself in heaven. He advised the Storm-god on the places where he might exit



47
Kumarbis. After the Storm-god's birth, they plotted to destroy Kumarbi and, with his other children, apparently succeeded.
Amunki (Munki/Minki) - chthonic deity.

Arma - minor moon god (Louvite/Luwian).
Aruna - god of the sea and son of Kamrušepa.

He defeated the Storm-god in Kiskilussa. Later he was lured from his lair with his children by a well dressed Inaras with a feast. After they were too engorged to get into their lair again, the Storm-god, accompanied by the other gods, killed him.
31 As “Ilovača” - a type of clayish earth, is just another Macedonic term for “earth/ground”; thus “Illuyanka” describes a chthonic being that crawls close to the earth/ground.



51
In another version of the myth, he defeated the Storm-god and stole his eyes and heart. Later, his daughter married the son of the Storm-god. Acting on the Storm-god's instruction, his son asked for the eyes and heart. When these were returned to him, the Storm-god vanquished Illuyankas, but slew his son as well when the youth sided with the dragon. The ritual of his defeat was invoked every spring to symbolize the earth's rebirth.

Kubaba (the “Great-Grandmother”) - the Great Mother Goddess of earth and fertility, spring waters, mountain tops and underworld; discovered also in Sumerian as Ki - as the primordial goddess of the earth. Her cult later spread and her name was adapted for the main goddess of the Hittite successor-kingdoms in Anatolia, which later developed into the Phrygian “Matar” (mother) and “Matar Kubileya” or Kybela/Kibela, whose image with inscriptions appear in rock-cut sculptures. The Phrygian Kybela/Kibela was then after transcribed into corrupted Latin as Cybebe/Cybele/Semele, and much later as the Medieval Kupalo. She is also identified as Kebat, or Hepat, one title of the HittiteHurrian Mother Goddess Hannahannah. Kubaba‟s Lydian name Kuvav or Kufav was transcribed by Ionian Danaans (so-called “Greex”) as Kybêbê, and 8th century she was further adopted as “the Kybêbê, daughter of Zevs“. The Phrygian goddess apart from the name, bears little resemblance to Kubaba, who was a sovereign deity at Sardis, known as Kybebe. Her annual festival was on March 24 (the New Year eve in the ancient Macedonic calendar), and her chief cult center in Hittite empire was the city of Kartchemish. Kubaba was the main goddess of Hittite successor kingdoms, with shrines throughout Mesopotamia, and the tutelary goddess who protected the ancient city of Kartchemish on the upper Euphrates, during the Early Hittite period.

Called “wise king” and “Father of the Gods” his chief cult center was the North Mesopotamian city of Urkis. Chief antagonist of Tešub in the cycle of Kumarbi myths. Couples sexually with various females, including a wife, Sertapsuruhi the daughter of the Sea God, and becomes the father of many gods and monsters: Tharunt the stormgod, Ullikummi the stone monster, Hedammu, Silver, and possibly Lamma; comparable to Egyptian Amun.

Maliya - (?)
Marasanta - mountain god, daughter of the Storm-god and Sun-goddess of Arinna.
Marwaizi - (?)
Mezulla - goddess of a real or mythical river, daughter of the sun-goddess Ariniti.
Mitra33 (Roman Mithras) - first appears in the Hittite records around 1380 BCE. It was mentioned in a peace treaty between the Hittite king Supiluliuma and the Mitani king Shattiwaza, where he is invoked as one of the protectors of treaties among other deities that honor the peace. Then after it was also adopted by Persians as Ahura Mitra (Lord Mitra) when Ahura Mazda himself legitimizes the worship of Mitra, according to Zoroastrian religious records. It was largely worshiped by Macedonians in the time of Alexander the Great. An exceptional showcase among Macedonian soldiers and their undisputed worship toward Mitra is the Mitraic symbolism of the undisputed power of acting without the constraint or necessity or fate, and the Mitraic benchmark of reliance par excellence, which is infront of the eyes of everyone - that typical “Phrygian” (i.e. Macedonian) helmet of the falankas of Filip II and Alexander III of Macedon. Worn by the large majority of the Macedonic soldiers it was a standard military equipment of the 4th century BCE Macedonian Army, and remained a symbol of the free world until our time. Mitra is also found as a god worshiped in the later Macedonic-Persian kingdom of Commagene in the 1st century BCE. His worship continues without interruption in the original Hittite homeland, thenafter renamed into Phrygia (corrupted form of Brygia, a region in Macedonia from where the Phrygians and Hittites originated).34 But, it‟s real height in popularity was reached in the late 1st century AD, when it was adopted by the Romans.
32 „Kum‟ in plain Macedonian. 33 Still in use as a common personal name Mitre in Macedonia. 34 Hittites probably moved to Asia Minor around middle of the 2nd millennium BCE, while their later Macedonic relatives Brygians/Phrygians moved there in the 9th century BCE.

Tarpatassi – a demon; properly propitiated with ritual and the sacrifice of a buck, this demon staves off sickness and grants long, healthy life.
Tapkina (or Damkina) - Ea's wife, imported from the Akkadians by way of the Hurrians.
Taru, Tarhunt - the supreme storm god of heaven, father of Telipinu; possibly predecessor of Taurus, which in the Mithraic worship of later days symbolized the passage of the sun into Taurus by the figure of a bull slain by a man; see also Taurus Mountains in southern Asia Minor.
He is chief among the gods and his symbol is the Bull. As Teshub he has been pictured as a bearded man astride two mountains and bearing a club. He is a god of battle and victory, especially when the battle is with a foreign power. As Taru, he is the consort of Wurušemu. He was the child of Anu and Kumarbi - conceived along with Tašmisu and the Aranzahu (Tigris) river when Kumarbi bit off and swallowed Anu phallus. He is, however, considered Ea's son in the myth of Ullikummi. He is informed by Anu of the possible exits from Kumarbi, and tries to exit through Kumarbi's 'tarnassas', causing him great pain. With the 'tarnassas' blocked, he exits through Kumarbis' 'good place'. He plots with Anu, Tašmisu, and Aranzhu to destroy Kumarbi, and apparently succeeds seizing the kingship in heaven.
He sent rain after the fallen Moon-god/Kashku when he fell from heaven.
Alerted to the imminent arrival of the Sun-god, who in some myths is his son, he has Tašmisu prepare a meal for their guest and listens to his report about the sudden appearance of the giant Ullikummi. He and Tašmisu then leave the Kuntarra and are led to Mount Hazzi by his sister, Ishtar, where they behold the monstrous creature. He looks upon Kumarbi' son with fear and Ishtar hides him. Later, emboldened, he has Tašmisu prepare his bulls and wagon for battle, and has him call out the thunderstorms, lightning and rains. Their first battle resulted in his incomplete defeat. He dispatches Tasmisus to his wife, Hebat, to tell her that he must remain in a 'lowly place' for a term. When Tašmisu returns, he encourages the Storm-god to seek Ea in the city Abzu/Apsu and ask for the 'tablets with the words of fate' (Tablets of Destiny? 'me'?). After Ea cleaves off Ullukummi' feet, he spurs Tašmisu and the Storm-god on to battle the crippled giant. Despite the diorite man's boasting, the Storm-god presumably defeats him.
He fought with the Dragon Illuyanka in Kiškilussa and was defeated. He called the gods for aid, asking that Inaras prepare a celebration. She does so and when the dragon and his children have gorged themselves on her feast, the mortal Hupasiyas binds him with a rope. Then the Storm-god, accompanied by the gods, sets upon them and destroys them. In another version of that myth, he looses his eyes and heart to Illuyankas after his first battle. He then marries a poor mortal woman and marries their son to Illuyankas daughter. He has the son ask for his eyes and heart. With their return, he attacks the dragon again. When his son sides with Illuyankas, the Storm-god kills them both.



58
When his son, Telepinu, is missing he despairs and complains to the Sun-god and then to Hannahanna, who tells him to search for him himself. After searching Telepinu' city he gives up.
In other versions of this myth, it is the Storm-god who is missing. One is almost exactly the same, and in another, he journeys to the Dark Earth in his anger, and is returned with the help of his mother, here Wuruntemu/Ereshkigal - the Sun-goddess of Arinna.
He sends Telipinu to recover the Sun-god who had been kidnapped by the Sea-god. The Sea-god is so intimidated that he gives Telipinu his daughter in marriage but demands a bride-price from the Storm-god. After consulting with Hannahanna, he pays the price of a thousand sheep and a thousand cattle.
He notices his daughter, Inara, is missing and sends a bee to Hannahanna to have her search for her.
Tarwaliya - (?)
Telia (or Hurris i.e. Urus) – one of the two holy bulls (“Tele"- „calf‟ in plain Macedonian). In preparation for battle, the Storm-god has ordered Tašmisu to plate their tails with gold and drive them together with Šeris („Šarets“ in plain Macedonian)37 and the battle wagon up to Mount Imgarra.
Tešub (or Tessub, maybe another name of Tarhunt) - storm god of the sky, weather and storms; the supreme reigning king of the gods according to Hurrian theology (however,
37 Macedonic term used for horse or bovine with patches of two different colors; see for example “Pinto horse”: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinto_horse



59
this name has no acceptable Hurrian etymology, but rather Indo-European); son of Anu, his consort is the Sun Goddess of Arinna. His sons are Šarruma and the Storm God of Nerik. His two divine bulls are Šerisu and Hurri (or Telia i.e. “Tele”(calf) in plain Macedonian). His principal cult center and "home" is Kummia in Northern Mesopotamia.
Tašmisu – a child of Anu and Kumarbi.
Teteshapi - goddess, maybe another name of Inara.
Telipinu - storm god of vegetation, agriculture and fertility (Hattic), son of the Storm god Tarhunt and the Sun goddess Arinniti. His prosperity and fertility is symbolized by a pole suspending the fleece of a sheep. The young oak is the symbol and image of the Telipinu. The only other confirmed veneration of the oak as sacred tree is found in ancient Macedonia.
Tiyaz - sungod, creator of the earth and of man (Macedonic/Paionian Dyaus/Dionis).
Tiwad - the sun goddess of the earth
Ubelluri - god of dreaming (Hurrian); dwelling in the underworld, the one who holds up the earth and sky. Similar to Atlas, this giant carries the world on his shoulders. The olden gods built the earth and heaven upon him though he did not notice, even when those two were separated with a cleaver. On the direction of Kumarbi's messenger Imbaluri, the Issira deities place Ullikummi on his right shoulder where the child grows. Ea asks him, in search of Ullikummi, and Upelluri admits to a small pain on his shoulder, although he can't identify which god is causing it.

Wurušemu - the sun goddess of city of Arinna, and consort of Tarhunt, the storm god. As mistress of the lands, the queen of heaven and earth, and mistress of the kings and queens of Hatti. She is a goddess of battle and is associated with Hittite military victory. She is



60
the mother of the Storm-god of Nerik, and thereby possibly associated with Ereshkigal. She aids in returning him from the underworld.
Yarri (Akkadian 'Erra' or 'Irra'; Ancient Macedonic 'Ares', from Macedonic 'Yara'- rage; also “Slavic” 'Yarilo'; Latin 'Irra') - he is a god of pestilence and destruction, drought and summer heat. Later he reappears as the Macedonian god of war Ares, and his was the month of March (from Latin 'Mars' => from Macedonic 'Ares' i.e. Yarets). This was also deduced from the name of this month in the Thesalian calendar – Αρειος , as well as from his animal-symbol – ram, i.e. Zodiacal „Aries‟. His erroneously Koine-transliterated name for the month as “Artemision” from ancient Macedonian calendar barely hides his original name, which descended from the Hittite-Macedonian “Yarets” - „Capricorn‟. Why this Aries-Capricorn duality? It is an etymological glitch, as the Macedonic word for Capricorn “Yarets” means „raging‟, and is actually an epithet which descended from the term “Yara” - „rage/heat‟ in plain Macedonian, Hittite and Akkadian. According to ancient tradition it is said that he was born as parthenogenetic child of the Great Mother Goddess.
Zababa/Zamama (or Astabi) - god of war, possibly another name for Wurrunkatte; ally of Tešub. Akkadian Ninurta.
Zaliyana („wetable/watered‟ in plain Macedonian) - mountain god, deified mountain; possibly later Phrygian Attis.

Zulki - the dream interpretess, chthonic.
Zur-wuna or Zurwan - supreme sun god (of the time, of the ancestors, and of everything that exists); comparable to Egypto-Macedonic Serapis.
Etc.
The holly mountain and god Zaliyana (i.e. „wet/watered‟ in plain Macedonian) himself was also considered the first of all the deities. In Nerik (north of the Land of Hatti) Zashapuna (i.e. “Zaspana”- „sleepy‟ in plain Macedonian) was the wife of the mountain god Zaliyana. But Prwa („the first one‟) seems to be her prefix/name too. The cult texts described that Zashapuna was even greater goddess of the Storm God of Nerik.

Next, Volkert Haas described the „mountain mother: “The belief of the great mountain queen was known in the Near East, as well in the whole Mediterranean and in areas of Eurasia. The mistress of the mountain is just a form of the Mother Goddess, who is manifesting herself in the throne realm of a mountain. The location of the mountain top as a throne for the goddess is of a latter development.38 First the mountain, the throne and the goddess were united in one. From the sky the Stormgod connect himself with the earth mother at the mountain. The mountain itself or the goddess sitting on the mountain forms the earth mother, who is receiving the rain god.”
38 as Macedonic-Phrygian Kibela/Cybele. Numerous are her sanctuaries found on the mount tops across the Republic of Macedonia in particular.



62
The Queen goddesses, who are mentioned in Hittite texts, were worshipped in many areas of Central Anatolia. For instance, Katahhi is a goddess of nature, fertility and the wild animals. In the Hittite texts this kind of goddesses are called Ḫassusara (Queen). Mother goddesses with epithet Amana/Mama have probably belonged to the category of the Queen deities, according to Piotr Taracha. He remarked: “There are good reasons to assume that they were goddesses of nature, fertility and wildlife”
Above: two different representations from two different periods (Hittite and Roman respectively) of the Great Mother Goddess (known as Kubaba/Kopala/Kibela/Cybele/Cybebe) as sitting on her throne with lions aside
In the city of Ulama, probably about 100 km northwest from Acem Höyük, there was the important goddess Kaititi together with the mountain god Arannapilanni. We know them, because they were taken away by king Hattusili I to the city of the Sun goddess of Arinna, when his army demolished the city Ulama. In Ankuwa the very important goddess Katahhi (later Katahha) and the mountain Daha were worshipped.
The goddess Ammamma was also known as a Queen deity in the land Zalpa. Recently Rostislav Oreshko has described a divine great Queen of Arzawa: Kubanta. Perhaps she



63
was a „Love and War‟ goddess like Ištar/Inanna, and it is probable that she was related with the realm of wild nature. In the Land of Kanesh the deity Askasepa is a huge vulcan, and also the tutelary God of the Gate. At least two important goddesses from Kanesh: Anna (the Goddess of Kanesh) and Kubaba (later Phrygian Kybela; Lat. Cybele/Cybebe)39, are mentioned in the Old Asyrian texts. It shows that the main goddesses of Kanesh, Ankuwa, Ulama and Acem Höyük (Purušhanda) had many similarities, in fact are one and the same goddess interpreted under different local dialect names. It seems that the female deities are at least as important as the male deities in the way they are pictured, for instance in molds and seals. And that they were the original leaders in the pantheon of these areas.
According to Maciej Popko the chief Luwian war-god was Iyarri40. Alfonso Archi stated that: “it would seem that he was conceived partially under the influence of the Mesopotamian Erra, a god of the plague with a similar name. For this reason Iyarri is referred to as the „Lord of the Bow‟, who strikes with his deadly arrows.” In the prayer of Mursili, Iyari is paired with another Luwian war-god: Sanda (DAMAR.UTU), who is armed with a bow too.
Sutekh, who was worshipped in every Hittite city as male god, Astartha being the female, is the same divinity whom the Egyptians worshipped under the name of Seth.
39 Kibela (Lat. Cybele), the universal mother goddess of the Phrygians, seated on a throne with two lions beside her feet, and as the great nature goddess had many attributes and was worshipped at Rome as a sacred black stone which was solemnly brought from Phrygia in 204 BCE. It was the first Oriental Religion adopted by the Romans and she received the name of “Mater Magna” (the Great Mother), and remains of a temple built for her on the Palatine Hill still exist; in Thebes the Great Goddes was named Demeter Cabiria (Dea Mater Kabira, Kabirian Demetra); also called by Etruscans Uni (by Romans „Juno‟) and by others Venus, or also known as the Ephesian Diana.
40 “Iyarra” - „rage‟ in plain Macedonian; accordingly “Yarets” or Koine “Ares” was the war-god in Classical Period; see also “Slavic” god “Yarilo”, Italian “Irra”(rage), etc.



64
Hittite language and script
Macedonic Hittie is today recognized as the earliest known representative of the IndoEuropean family of languages. It is very archaic, and thus extremely important for understanding Indo-European, but many aspects of its (historical) interpretation are still unclear or not agreed upon. It must‟ve be closely related to Palaic, which shows a few characteristics in which it is even more archaic than Hittite, but it is only known from a few texts discovered at Boğazköy. The recovered data from them is insufficient and the knowledge of this idiom is very limited and speculative. It is the language of the land Palā, which was situated to the northeast of Hattuša.
The writing of cuneiform Hittite started later than ca. 1650 BCE, and developed in the 16th century BCE. The script is a form of cuneiform. This causes many difficulties since it is a syllabic script, which means that each sign represents one syllable.
Why the adjective “Macedonic”? Because of the very fact that Hittites, who later mingled with and were inhered by their close Macedonic relatives Phrygians (i.e. Brygians from Macedonia), called their language „Našili‟ - “our language”, which in today modern



65
Macedonian is „Našinski‟, or in dialects from the Aegean (Southern) Macedonia: „Naški lafi ‟ – “ours-speech, speaks ours (language)”.41
Besides Hittite, which was the tongue spoken by the founders of the empire and always remained the primary idiom used by the royal bureaucracy, two other idioms were employed in the Hittite empire. The Palaic - along the coast of the Black Sea, and Louvite (Luvian) language which is known from two sources: cuneiform Louvite and hieroglyphic Louvite. Cuneiform Louvite/Luvian was written in the same way as the Hittite, which suggests that the cuneiform was the official writing of the state.
The ancestors of the speakers of all three of these first Indo-European languages entered Asia Minor from north, from the central regions of Macedonian Peninsula (Macedonia proper), as attested by the historical records (Herodotus), and proven by the recent Comparative Linguistics and Genetic researches.
Above: the dispersion of the Indo-European (Aryan) people and languages according to the Genetic (and Comparative Linguistics) findings summarized by A. A. Klyosov
The Hieroglyphic Hittite/Luvian used a special set of symbols unlike cuneiform. The earliest securely dated use of hieroglyphs as a language is said to be from ca. 1520 BCE on the seal of Ispuhtasu, king of Kizzuwatna, who was a contemporary of the Hittite king
41 „Naški‟ - “ours”; and „Lafi‟[archaic] - “speaks”; from the IE root “Ly” - logos/golos, lingua, language; Sanskrit: „lap‟, Macedonian: „laf ‟; thus: „Naš laf ‟ - “our speach”, and/or „lafi po naški‟ - “speaks by ours (tongue)”.

Telepinu. Certainly we can assume a long pre-stage of these hieroglyphs in Kizzuwatna and Hatti.
However, despite one of the biggest problems of Hittite studies is that the Hittite texts can be interpreted in many different ways, they stubornly show undeniable Macedonic features and etymology. Second millennium BCE toponyms in Hitiite like Maša, Viluša, Tiruša, Hattuša, etc. are only comparable to and echo the Macedonian Kruša, Wattaša, Bituša, Raduša, etc.42 Or the Hittite holy royal capital of Cybistra, which resembles the homonymous toponyms of Mt. Bistra, village and river Bistritsa in Macedonia.
The Hittite inscriptions are found cut generally in the living rock from the Aegean Sea to the Euphrates, and from Phrygia to Palestine. These inscriptions - in Asia Minor at Kartabel; in the neighborhood of Smyrna, at Gurum, Tyana, and other points in Kappadokia (the important Hittite remains at Eyuk and Boghaz Keui are within its borders, and there is plenty of evidence that it was at one time the headquarters of the Hittite empire); at various points in Phrygia; at Ibreez near Tarsus in Cilicia, etc.
Taken in consideration with the curious resemblance of the Hittite syllabic characters with the Cypriote, the Lycian (Lukka), and other slightly variant syllabaries of that region - seem to prove that the civilization and the political influence of the Hittite confederacy preceded that of the Phoenicians in Cyprus and Carthage by a long shot. Add to these considerations the fact that the Egyptian monumental inscriptions inform us that there were Dardanians43 from the plain of Troy fighting on the side of the Hittites at the battle

of Kadesh, and you will see that the weight of cumulative evidence for the extension of the Hittite empire and literacy over whole Asia Minor (and further) is very strong.
Because of its great antiquity, Hittite and its close relative Louvite/Luwian provided invaluable aid to the study of Indo-European linguistics. In particular, they were the only languages with hard evidence in support of the laryngeal theory, which profoundly changed the understanding of Proto-Indo-European, the supposed mother tongue of all Indo-European languages.
Above: Hittite hieroglyphic inscriptions from Commagene44
Laryngeal theory concluded that atypical Proto-Indo-European roots (abstract, basic form of words) were actually typical Proto-Indo-European roots that contained “laryngeal” consonants. Some of these laryngeal consonants “colored” or modified the vowels they preceded or followed. All laryngeals eventually coalesced with the vowels and disappeared, leaving no trace in most documented Indo-European languages. It is still in intense debate how many laryngeals there were, but most linguists agree on three:
h1: neutral laryngeal, meaning it doesn't change the vowel h2: a-coloring, turning vowel into /a/ h3: o-coloring, turning vowel into /o/
The original form of the theory was proposed in 1879 by Ferdinand de Saussure, but because of its purely analytical arguments and lack of evidence, it remained highly controversial. However, with the discovery of Hittite and its identification as the very first known Indo-European language, scholars started to notice cuneiform signs representing /h/-like sounds appearing in places where the theory predicted laryngeals would appear. For example, consider Macedonic verb “poe”45 (corrupted Latin pōtare), and Sanskrit “pā-”, both meaning “to drink”. Because of the long vowel /ō/ the reconstructed PIE form would be “pehz”, and in Hittite scholars found the word “pahs” which meant "to drink, to swallow".
44 “Anatolian studies 20 (1970)” by J.D.Hawkins. 45 Macedonian “Poilo” - „waterhole, drinking fountain‟ in plain Macedonian.



68
Similarly, we find the cognates in Macedonic “Anti” (Antigona, Antipater...) „from, of‟, Latin “Ante”- „in front of, before‟, and Sanskrit “Anti”- „near, in presence of‟. Because of the short /a/ vowel, the reconstructed PIE form would be „ḫænt‟, which is quite similar to Hittite “hants” – „front, face‟.
Numerous basic words are firm testimony of the oneness of the language of Louvites (Luwian) and Hittites (Nashili) and later Macedonic languages (Nashinski), despite the time lap of almost three and a half millennia between them. They testify the Continuity Paradigm as the one and only in the human history, regardless of the incessant modern political bias and manipulation.
On the next pages is presented a vocabulary that promotes a corpus of similar and/or totally equal Hittite/Macedonic words and concepts. All the transliterated Hittite words are cited from the 1985 Hittite Vocabulary by D. M. Weeks and the Indo-European Wordlists. Some of them are given in Serbo-Croatian (SC) Macedonic or in Old Church Macedonic (OCM) form, as some archaic features are preserved better within the words in these modern versions of Macedonic idiom.

When the inscriptions in their own tongue that have so far been gathered, and others which may yet be found, have been deciphered, it is likely that much may be added to the knowledge we already have of their life. Payne stated that multilingualism in the Hittite kingdom, in particular the strong linguistic position of Louvite and Našili (i.e. Našinski in plain Macedonian), is a good explanation for the existence of two writing systems in the Hittite empire.
The same sources of information furnish us with the names of their kings, as well as the generals of different corps engaged in battle, and the names of towns which yielded to the demand for tribute in the times of Egyptian conquest.
From the inscriptions on the outer wall of the temple at Karnak, we have not only the name of the king of the Khita who made peace with Rameses, but that of his daughter and those of his father and grandfather. The king is described as Khita-sira, son of Maro-sira, and grandson of Sapalala. Even his brother and predecessor, Mautenara, is named, as well as his daughter, Ur-Maa Nofirura, who became by the terms of the treaty the bride of Rameses II Miamen.
In the catalogue of towns whose inhabitants were captured at Megiddo by Thothmes III, one hundred places are enumerated, most of which have been identified as the towns and fortresses which some three or four centuries later fell into the hands of the children of Israel. Kadesh was, at the time of the battle of Megiddo, the chief city of the Hittites; and its king was followed by all the kings from the water of Egypt to the river-land of Naharain (Mesopotamia), “as well as by the Khalu (Phoenicians) and the Kiti (Macedonians),” a branch, no doubt, of the Khita (Hittites) who had taken possession of Cyprus.
As the result of later campaigns of Thothmes III, tribute was repeatedly brought him from Cyprus. The war-tax paid by cities of the Hittites during this period of temporary



77
subjection, consisted of corn, olive oil, wine, honey, wool, linen, balm of Gilead, resin, asphalt for embalming, dates, and the metals brought in by Phoenician commerce.
Between the reigns of Thothmes III and Rameses II the Hittites had recovered their independence. Rameses I had a war with them, which seems to have resulted in an alliance offensive and defensive, which shows that the Khita had fully recovered their strength since the harassing campaigns of Thothmes III. His son Seti made a brilliant campaign against the Asiatic tribes on the east, smote the Phoenicians, took Kadesh from the Hittites, defeated them in a great battle, and made the Canaanites of Lebanon fell great cedars for him to use in building a ship for the Nile, and tall masts to plant in front of the temple of Amen in Thebes.
Ra-messu Miamen was crowned king by his father Seti, when still a mere boy. Brugsch puts his accession about 1333 BCE. Ra-messu also warred with the Khita, and, as he had the poet Pentaur to sing his renown, he appears by the general tone of the records to have won a great victory at Kadesh. Brugsch, however, after a careful examination of the inscriptions, declares that he came out of that fight a doubtful conqueror, and had to thank his personal bravery for his life.
The king of Khita, before the fight began, made use of a stratagem to deceive and entrap the king of Kemi. He sent two Shasu (Bedouins of Edom) to play the part of deserters and induce Ra-messu to believe that the king of Khita was in the land of Khilibu (Haleb) when he was really lying in ambush behind the town of Kadesh. Pharaon fell into the trap, and his army was badly worsted. But, according to the official report prepared under his eye, and according also to the heroic poem of Pentaur, the king by his valor retrieved the day. The victory, however, could not have been very complete, as we find Ra-messu again at war with other Hittite towns, and in the end he makes the famous peace with Khita-sira, which puts the two races of Khita and Kemi apparently in the position of equals who cannot afford to quarrel.
This treaty seems to have been kept, probably on account of the marriage of Ra-messu with Khita-sira's daughter. Mineptah II kept up the most friendly relations with the Khita, and even supplied them with wheat in time of famine. He seems to have retained sway over the Phoenicians, and the Bedouins from Edom were allowed peaceful passage through the Delta, as loyal subjects.
The alliance between the Chaeldonians and their kinsmen, the children of Heth, makes it easy for us to understand the wide range of influence, exercised by Hittites and Phoenicians together, over all Asia Minor and the isles that begirt it. Whatever the character of the races already settled there, the warlike Hittites kept this influence contenuous and enduring by land, while the half trading, half-piratical Sidonians kept it up by sea.
