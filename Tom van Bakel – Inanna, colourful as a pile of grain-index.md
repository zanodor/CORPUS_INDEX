Inanna, colourful as a pile of grain
Picture 1
I this essay I examine this well known knotted bundle which is depicted on a number of cylinder seals. First of all: I think it is made of grain and not of reed as is commonly thought. Secondly: I don't think it is an emblem but it rather portrays Inanna herself as she is called ‘a shock of two-row barley’ in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid (R)’:
‘Maiden, glossy mane, lovely beauty, Inanna, glossy mane, lovely beauty! Maiden, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer, Inanna, mane of the ibex, ...... red deer, ...... red deer! Maiden, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for the king, Inanna, colourful as a pile of grain, fit for Dumuzid! Maiden, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness, Inanna, you are a shock of two-row barley, fully developed in loveliness!’
But there are even more possibilities, Dagon, an Ugaritic grain god, may be portrayed as a bundle of grain too:
‘In Ugaritic, the root dgn also means grain: in Hebrew דגן dāgān, Samaritan dīgan, is an archaic word for grain. The Phoenician author Sanchuniathon also says Dagon means siton, that being the Greek word for grain. Sanchuniathon further explains: ‘And Dagon, after he discovered grain and the plough, was called Zeus Arotrios.’ The word arotrios means ‘ploughman’, ‘pertaining to agriculture’ (confer ἄροτρον ‘plow’).
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagon



Picture 2
And on the above imprint the pictograph on the right may represent the goddess Ashan (Grain).
This pictograph means: XE, The Sumerian sign (Jaritz #669) reads še (for *ši), 'barley', and 'grain, seed'
Proto-Language Monosyllables with Correspondent Sumerian and Egyptian Signs
Her sister Lahar (Sheep) may be portrayed as a sheep, (what else).
‘Ashnan was the goddess of grain in Mesopotamia. She and her sister Lahar, both children of Enlil, were created by the gods to provide the Annunaki with food, but when the heavenly creatures were found unable to make use of their products, humankind was created to provide an outlet for their services’.
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashnan
And the so called ‘shrine’ may represent the storeroom.
This storeroom, the sheep as well as the grain are mentioned in ‘The debate between Grain and Sheep’. In this myth the gods created Grain (Ashan) and Sheep (Lahar) and sent them down from the Holy Mound. They brought wealth to the assembly and filled the storerooms of the Land with stock:
26-36. ‘At that time, at the place of the gods' formation, in their own home, on the Holy Mound, they created Sheep and Grain. Having gathered them in the divine banqueting chamber, the Anuna gods of the Holy Mound partook of the bounty of Sheep and Grain but were not sated; (-) For their own wellbeing in the holy sheepfold, they gave them to mankind as sustenance. 37-42. At that time Enki spoke to Enlil: ‘Father Enlil, now Sheep and Grain have been created on the Holy Mound, let us send them down from the Holy Mound.’ Enki and Enlil, having spoken their holy word, sent Sheep and Grain down from the Holy Mound. (-) 54-64. They brought wealth to the assembly. They brought sustenance to the Land. They fulfilled the ordinances of the gods. They filled the storerooms of the Land with stock. The barns of the Land were heavy with them. When they entered the homes of the poor who crouch in the dust they brought wealth. Both of them, wherever they directed their steps, added to the riches of the household with their weight. Where they stood, they were satisfying; where they settled, they were seemly. They gladdened the heart of An and the heart of Enlil’.



Picture 3
And the cognomen of Nisaba is: ‘Nunbarshegunu,’ which means ‘Lady (Whose) Body (Is) Dappled Barley’ (See: matrifocus.com) On this imprint she may be portrayed as a stalk of barley and the bull may represent her spouse Ḫaia who is called ‘great breed-bull’ in ‘a hymn to Ḫaia for Rīm-Sîn (B)’:
‘My king, I shall praise your eminence in song! Ḫaia, I will declare your greatness perpetually! Who among the gods is fitted like you for the holy divine powers? Your beloved spouse is the maiden Nisaba, the great queen of queens. Ninlil, who was born of her holy womb, the august wife of Nunamnir, sits with her on the dais of E-kur with head raised high, uniquely entitled to behave as queen of the gods, the peerless goddess. In the abzu shrine, Enki has bestowed his incantations of life on you, great breed-bull, who are recognised for your right understanding, who constantly care for the gods, Ḫaia, you who operate effectively the assigning of divine powers, who mark out the cult places’.
This imprint may also indicate an Akitu festival celebrated in March, which is indicated by the constellation Taurus:
‘Akitu ‘cutting of barley’, akiti-šununum ‘sowing of barley’, Babylonian akitu, also rêš-šattim ‘head of the year’) was a spring festival in ancient Mesopotamia. The name is from the Sumerian for ‘barley’, originally marking two festivals celebrating the beginning of each of the two half-years of the Sumerian calendar, marking the sowing of barley in autumn and the cutting of barley in spring. In Babylonian religion it came to be dedicated to Marduk's victory over Tiamat’.
en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Akitu



Picture 4
On this imprint Sud may be portrayed as a stalk of grain and her spouse Enlil may be depicted as a bull. In the myth ‘Enlil and Sud:’ Enlil says to her: ‘May my beautiful wife, who was born by holy Nisaba, be Ezina, the growing grain, the life of Sumer’:
156-170. ‘(Enlil speaks:) ‘From now on, a woman shall be the ......; a foreign woman shall be the
mistress of the house. May my beautiful wife, who was born by holy Nisaba, be Ezina, the growing grain, the life of Sumer. When you appear in the furrows like a beautiful young girl, may Ickur, the canal inspector, be your provider, supplying you with water from the ground. The height of the year is marked with your new prime flax and your new prime grain; Enlil and Ninlil procreate them (?) as desired’.



Picture 5
On this imprint the ear of barley may represent Inanna who is called ‘a shock of two-row barley’ in ‘a song of Inanna and Dumuzid (R)’.
And the bull may represent Dumuzid who is called ‘Wild bull’ in ‘a balbale (?) to Inanna (P):’
‘Make the milk yellow for me, my bridegroom, make the milk yellow for me, and I will drink the milk with you, my bridegroom! Wild bull Dumuzid, make the milk yellow for me, and I will drink the milk with you, my bridegroom! ...... the goat's milk ...... the fold’.
Below a small sheep may eat something. This scene may be mentioned in ‘a song of Inanna and Dumuzid (W)’:
‘May my sheep eat my ...... which is growing in the fields, my plants, my camel-thorn. May my sheep eat my ......, my plants, my winnowed barley. May my sheep eat my life of the Land which is growing in the fields, my plants, my stubble. May my sheep eat my support of orphans and sustenance of widows, my plants, my šakir plants. May my sheep eat my string of clay balls (?) which is growing in the fields, my plants, my colocynth. May my sheep eat my beer wort mixed with honey, my plants, my marsh reeds. May my sheep eat my calves going together with their bulls, my plants, my reed shoots. May my sheep eat my blossoming garden of apple trees, my plants, my reeds.
23-38. May my sheep eat my aromatic plants of the fields, dripping with syrup, my plants, my licorice. May my sheep eat my ...... waterskin hanging from the saddle, my plants, my ḫarub pods. May my sheep eat my grass spread out like a mantle, my plants, my meadow grass. May my sheep eat my nativeborn (?) of flourishing Sumer, my plants, my kali plants. May my sheep eat my unkempt long hair, my plants, my esparto grass. May my sheep eat my plants that ignore winter and summer, my plants, my date palm saplings. May my sheep eat my beautiful ...... plants with a head of fine hairs, my plants, my lilangi plants. May my sheep eat my ...... growing in the desert, my plants, my apple grass’.



Picture 6
On this imprint the stalk of barley is replaced by a so called ‘emblem of Inanna.’ This ‘emblem’ is a knotted bundle of barley moulded in the shape of a girl with a pigtail. It figures Inanna herself as she is called ‘a shock of two-row barley.’ The bull standing before her may represent her spouse Dumuzid.
Picture 7
This imprint may demonstrate the relationship between the knotted bundle and the long haired Inanna holding a stalk of barley.



Picture 8
This imprint may show a bundle of grain with a ‘face’ and a pigtail. Her hair is important to her as we read in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid (Dumuzid-Inanna Y)’:
‘My one distinguished by a shock of hair, my one distinguished by a shock of hair! My sweet, my one
distinguished by a shock of hair! My one distinguished by a shock of hair like a palm tree! My shaggynecked one like a tamarisk, my one distinguished by a shock of hair! My man distinguished in the assembly by your shock of hair! Rub it against our breast, my sweet! Noble one (?), honoured in the assembly with your shock of hair! Rub it against our breast, my brother with kindly eyes! My lapis lazuli beard, my fermenting-vat shock of hair! My beard mottled like lapis lazuli! My shock of hair sturdy as a fermenting vat! My ivory figurine, my golden figure! My object fashioned by a skilled carpenter! My one worked on by a skilled metal worker!’
Picture 9
It looks like the pigtail of a seated Egyptian goddess depicted on a wooden cylinder seal.



Picture 10
Here is another knotted bundle of grain moulded like a girl with a pigtail figuring Inanna again. In the middle may stand her house of silver and lapis lazuli, a storehouse built of gold as it is mentioned in ‘The temple hymns’:
‘O Ulmaš, upper land, ...... of the Land, terrifying lion battering a wild bull, net spreading over an enemy, making silence fall upon a rebel land on which, as long as it remains insubmissive, spittle is poured! House of Inanna of silver and lapis lazuli, a storehouse built of gold, your princess is an arabu bird, the Mistress of the Niĝin-ĝar’:
And the four sheep may be mentioned in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid:’
23-38. May my sheep eat my aromatic plants of the fields, dripping with syrup, my plants, my licorice. May my sheep eat my ...... waterskin hanging from the saddle, my plants, my ḫarub pods. May my sheep eat my grass spread out like a mantle, my plants, my meadow grass. May my sheep eat my native-born (?) of flourishing Sumer, my plants, my kali plants. May my sheep eat my unkempt long hair, my plants, my esparto grass. May my sheep eat my plants that ignore winter and summer, my plants, my date palm saplings. May my sheep eat my beautiful ...... plants with a head of fine hairs, my plants, my lilangi plants. May my sheep eat my ...... growing in the desert, my plants, my apple grass’.
Picture 11
Once again Inanna is figured as a knotted bundle of barley which is moulded like a girl with a pigtail. Her house of silver and lapis lazuli, her storehouse built of gold stands behind her. The upturned lion may represent Dumuzid who is called ‘a raging lion’ in the same hymn:
‘O house where lustrous herbs are strewn upon the flowery bed, the bed-chamber of holy Inanna, where the lady of the plain refreshes herself! Brick-built E-muš (House which is the precinct) is flowery and holy, its ...... clay established for him who tends the ewes on the high plain. Your ...... house of Arali (House which is the nether world) gives shade (?) to the shepherd. Your prince, a raging lion on the plain, the šuba jewel of the Mistress whose breast is holy and marvellous, the lord who is holy Inanna's husband, Dumuzid, the sovereign of E-muš, has erected a house in your precinct, O Bad-tibira, and taken his seat upon your dais’.
And the five sheep may be mentioned in a song of Inanna and Dumuzid: ‘May my sheep eat my aromatic plants of the fields, dripping with syrup, my plants, my licorice.’ ect.



Picture 13
On this bas-relief Asherah, alias Ishtar, alias Inanna gives barley to two sheep illustrating the sentence: ‘May my sheep eat my ......, my plants, my winnowed barley’ written in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid (W)’.
Picture 14
In the same way a god like Dumuzid may give something to eat to a sheep. Inanna depicted as a knotted bundle of barley is watching them. By the way, the Sumerian kings called themselves ‘shepherds’ who had to teem the people who were like a flock of sheep:
Ur-Namma the canal-digger (Ur-Namma D) ‘In Urim, in the E-mud-kura, he made the foundation of my throne firm. He ...... the holy sceptre to guide the numerous people in my hand. He ...... the staff and the shepherd's crook to ...... the expanding and teeming people. Lord Ašimbabbar ...... a long-lasting life. Enlil ...... of the four quarters of the world. He ...... a lasting name, a name worthy to be praised. Enki presented me with my broad wisdom’.



Picture 15
A cattle-pen is a place of birth as we read in ‘A praise poem of Šulgi (D)’:
‘O my king, great bull with splendid limbs, dragon with a lion's eyes! Shepherd Šulgi, great bull with splendid limbs, dragon with a lion's eyes! Bull-calf born in the cattle-pen of abundance, thriving there! Mighty one fit for heroism, the ornament of his Land! Righteous man, invested with justice by Utu! Fierce leopard who feeds on rich milk, rampant bull who was born to be a great beast! A lapis-lazuli beard, a holy breast -- marvellous to behold! O king, joy of the royal tiara! Šulgi, ornament of the legitimate crown, wearing the diadem of godhead, named by An with a good name! Good shepherd, endowed with strength by Enlil, Šulgi, the beloved of Ninlil's heart!’
In ‘Cattle of the Skies’ Gavin White writes that a ‘cattle-pen’ sign is used to write the verb ‘to give birth’ or more specifically ‘to bear a child’.
The Tu-sign
‘The basic image of the cattle-pen also forms the basis for another independent cuneiform sign. By tilting the ring-post over on its side, a new variant sign called Tu or Tud is made (right). The purpose of creating this variant sign is to assign it a different meaning. Accordingly, this sign is not used to write the name of any cattle enclosure but is instead specifically
used to write the verb ‘to give birth’ or more specifically ‘to bear a child’.5 Modern scholars agree that this sign was utilised for this purpose because the cattle-pen was used as a birthing shed where lambs, kids and calves were emerged into this world. This meaning refers back to the gate-like nature of the cattle-pen – just as the calf emerges from the gateway of the cattle-pen in ancient art so does the human baby emerge from the ‘gateway’ of its mother’s womb’.
The above imprint shows a cattle-pen with an emblem of Inanna on top. It may symbolize that Inanna is a mother goddess: she may have given birth to the depicted bulls and calves around her. She is even called ‘the mother of the land.’ in ‘A praise poem of Enlil’:
‘In the E-ana, Inanna has fixed a rejoicing heart to be your lot and has you brought grandly into her holy bedchamber to spend the night there. The mother of the Land, Ninisina, has caused you to lay the foundations with your hands in Isin. Utu, the judge, the king of heaven and earth, has confirmed for you in your hands the sceptre which brings the black-headed to justice’.



Picture 16
On this Uruk Trough we see a similar cattle-pen.
This scene shows that the sheepfold of Inanna is a place of abundance bringing forth cattle and barley more or less similar to what we read in ‘A love song of Išme-Dagan (J)’:
1-8. ‘Lady, going to the sweet-voiced cows and gentle-voiced calves in the cattle-pen, young woman, when you arrive there, Inanna, may the churn sound! May the churn of your spouse sound, Inanna, may the churn sound! May the churn of Dumuzid sound, Inanna, may the churn sound! 9-14. The rocking of the churn will sing (?) for you, Inanna, may it thus make you joyous! The good shepherd, the man of sweet songs, will loudly (?) sing songs for you; lady, with all the sweetest things, Inanna, may he make your heart joyous! 15-20. Lady, when you enter the cattle-pen, Inanna, the cattle-pen will indeed rejoice over you. Mistress, when you enter the sheepfold, Inanna, the sheepfold will indeed rejoice over you. When you enter the feeding-pen, healthy ewes will spread out their wool for you.
21-24. May the holy sheepfold abundantly provide (?) you with butter, may the cattle-pen produce butter and cream for you! May abundance endure in the sheepfold, may the days of Išme-Dagan be numerous!
25-26. May my spouse, a ewe cherishing its lamb, be praised with sweet admiration!’



Picture 17
Inanna bread The King
On this imprint Inanna holds her emblem: a bundle of barley, and a king holds a stalk of flax. Bread pictographs are depicted in-between them. Here Inanna may be the lover and the aid of the king like king Šulgi wishes that the grain goddess Ezina-Kusu is the lover and the aid of his son in ‘A lullaby for a son of Šulgi’:
57-63. ‘May a wife be your support, and may a son ....... May a son be your fortune. May winnowed grain be your lover, and may Ezina-Kusu (the goddess of grain) be your aid. May you have an
eloquent protective goddess. May you be brought up to a reign of favourable days. May you smile upon festivals. 64-66. My son is ......; he knows nothing. He does not know the length of his old age (?). He does not know the dwelling of the ....... 67-73. May you discover ....... May you eat ....... 3 lines fragmentary May you be ....... May you be .......’.
etcsl.orinst.ox.ac.uk/cgi-bin/etcsl.cgi?text=t.
Clay Token - Elam's & Mesopotamia heartlands en.numista.com
The two pictographs in the middle mean: ‘bread.’ They may symbolize that Inanna produces abundance for the king.



Picture 18
On the above imprint Inanna is depicted as a knotted bundle of barley placed in-between the Mesopotamian constellations Arrow and Bow.
All in all this imprint may depict five Mesopotamian spring constellations:
o On the right the bull may represent the constellation GU4.AN.NA: ‘The Bull of Heaven’; Taurus. o The two quadrupeds on top may represent the constellation MASH.TAB.BA.GAL.GAL = tu'amu rabûtu: ‘The Great Twins’; alpha and beta Geminorum. o The boy holding two arrows may represent the constellation KAK.SI.SÁ = shukudu: ‘The Arrow’; alpha Canis Maioris. o The archer may represent the constellation BAN (GISH.BAN) = qashtu: ‘The Bow’; tao, delta, sigma, and epsilon Canis Maioris o And the lion turned upside down may represent the constellation UR.GU.LA: ‘The Lion’; Leo.
On the above imprint Ishtar is depicted in-between the constellations Arrow and Bow. This scene clearly demonstrate that Inanna is the goddess of Sirius, the brightest star of Canis Majoris. In Babylonia this constellation was called ‘The Bow:’ mulBAN [Qastu] and according to the description given by Mul.Apin this constellation is the Elamite dIstar: the daughter of dEnlil. Published: reocities.com/astrologymulapin/pathofenlil.htm



Picture 19
On the above imprint Inanna is depicted as a knotted bundle of barley embedded in three constellations which indicate April/May:
o As usual the two lions represent the sun and the moon in the constellation Gemini: .BA.GAL.GAL = tu'amu rabûtu: ‘The Great Twins’; alpha and beta Geminorum indicating April. o And the archer may represent the constellation BAN (GISH.BAN) = qashtu: ‘The Bow’; tao, delta, sigma, and epsilon Canis Maioris, indicating April/May. According to the description given by Mul.Apin this constellation is the Elamite dIstar: the daughter of dEnlil. o The boy holding some arrows represent the constellation KAK.SI.SÁ = shukudu: ‘The Arrow’; allias Canis Maioris, indicating April/May. Published: reocities.com/astrologymulapin/pathofenlil.htm
Once again: Inanna is the brightest star of the Mesopotamian constellation Bow and on the above imprint this constellation is represented by an archer. Inanna is depicted as a bundle of barley standing close to two lions. These two lions represent the sun god Utu and the moon god Nanna passing Gemini. And thus this imprint demonstrates that in April, in Gemini,, at new moon, Inanna, the goddess of barley, the star of the constellation Bow, is ‘united’ with the sun and the moon.



Picture 20
On top of this imprint are five stars. They tell us something about Inanna. They indicate the position of Inanna toward new moon from March until July.
In ‘A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan’ we read that Inanna operates at new moon: ‘Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land gather around her so that the divine powers are perfected’:
20-33. ‘When standing in the heavens she is the good wild cow of An, on earth she instils respect; she is the lady of all the lands. She received the divine powers in the abzu, in Eridug; her father Enki presented them to her. He placed the lordship and kingship in her hands. She takes her seat on the great dais with An; she determines the fates in her Land with Enlil. Monthly, at the new moon, the gods of the Land
gather around her so that the divine powers are perfected. The great Anuna gods, having bowed before them, stand there with prayers and supplications and utter prayers on behalf of all the lands’.
In ‘The Joy of Sumer: The Sacred Marriage Rite’ we even read that she practices a Sacred Marriage at the disappearance of the moon, so also at new moon:
‘The exact first day of the month is closely examined, And on the day of the disappearance of the moon, On the day of the sleeping of the moon, The me are perfectly carried out So that the New Year’s Day, the day of rites, May be properly determined,
And a sleeping place be set up for Inanna.
The people cleanse the rushes with sweet-smelling cedar oil, They arrange the rushes for the bed.
They spread a bridal sheet over the bed’.
Around 2000 B.C. the Sirius star and the sun were in conjunction from about half April until about half June: rising and setting at the same time:
‘Egyptians based their calendar on the heliacal rising of Sirius, namely the day it becomes visible just before sunrise after moving far enough away from the glare of the Sun. This occurred just before the annual flooding of the Nile and the summer solstice, after a 70-day absence from the skies. Sirius was identified with the great goddess Isis, while the 70-day period symbolized the passing of Isis and Osiris through the duat (Egyptian underworld)’.
Publised:en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirius



This meant that for 70 days Sirius and the sun formed a couple. In the next verse the conjunction of Sirius with the sun is described as Inanna riding together with her brother, the sun god Utu:
24-30. ‘(Inanna speaks :) ‘My brother, awe-inspiring lord, let me ride with you to the mountains! Lord of heaven, awe-inspiring lord, lord, let me ride with you to the mountains; to the mountains of herbs, to the mountains of cedars, to the mountains; to the mountains of cedars, the mountains of cypresses, to the mountains; to the mountains of silver, the mountains of lapis lazuli, to the mountains; to the mountains where the gakkul plants grow, to the mountains; to the distant source of the rolling rivers, to the mountains’.
Name poem: A cir-namcub to Utu (Utu F) Published: The Electronic Text Corpus of Sumerian Literature
At new moon the moon god joined them and at that time the Sirius goddess formed a ‘trio’ with both the sun and the moon. In spring this happened two or three times and thus Inanna is depicted two or three times on some cylinder seals.
On the imprint the five stars indicate the position of Inanna toward new moon from March until July.
o The star beneath the crescent shows that she is following new moon in March which means that she is visable in the evening, and thus she is an evening star. o The three stars indicate her ‘union’ with new moon in April, May and June. o And the star above the crescent indicate her position in July when she is visible in the morning and she is the morning star.



Picture 21
On this imprint stand three knotted barley girls with a pigtail. They demonstrate that in spring Inanna operates three times at new moon. At the same time Dumuzid give her sheep blossom of apple trees as mentioned in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid (W):
‘May my sheep eat my ...... which is growing in the fields, my plants, my camel-thorn. May my sheep eat my ......, my plants, my winnowed barley. May my sheep eat my life of the Land which is growing in the fields, my plants, my stubble. May my sheep eat my support of orphans and sustenance of widows, my plants, my šakir plants. May my sheep eat my string of clay balls (?) which is growing in the fields, my plants, my colocynth. May my sheep eat my beer wort mixed with honey, my plants, my marsh reeds. May my sheep eat my calves going together with their bulls, my plants, my reed shoots. May my sheep eat my blossoming garden of apple trees, my plants, my reeds’.
Picture 22
On this imprint Inanna is pictured as two knotted barley girls with a pigtail: this time she operates two times at new moon in spring. At the same time Dumuzid give her sheep the blossom of apple trees as mentioned in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid.’ On the right a lamb is born. Birth is symbolized by two birth stones below. This scene may symbolize the phrases: ‘may he make the sheepfolds multiply, like a trustworthy shepherd. Under him, may the wild sheep and wild goats multiply in the forests’ as written in a song of Inanna and Dumuzid (D1):
47-59. ‘May he act as shepherd of the black-headed inhabitants; may he, like a farmer, make the fields productive; may he make the sheepfolds multiply, like a trustworthy shepherd. Under him, may there be flax, may there be barley; in the rivers may there be carp floods. Under him, may there be mottled barley in the fields; in the marshes, fish, and may the birds chatter. Under him, may the old reeds and the young reeds grow tall in the reedbeds; under him, may the mašgurum bushes flourish on the high plains. Under him, may the wild sheep and wild goats multiply in the forests; under him, may the irrigated orchards produce syrup and wine’.



Picture 22 a
Cancer Gemini Taurus
These three emblems of Inanna may indicate the three phases of Inanna, or Sirius in spring. When the sun passes Taurus it starts to conjunct with Sirius. When it passes Gemini it fully conjunct with Sirius. And when it passes Cancer the sun starts to separate from the sun and becomes the morning star.
‘Egyptians based their calendar on the heliacal rising of Sirius, namely the day it becomes visible just before sunrise after moving far enough away from the glare of the Sun. This occurred just before the annual flooding of the Nile and the summer solstice, after a 70-day absence from the skies. Sirius was identified with the great goddess Isis, while the 70-day period symbolized the passing of Isis and Osiris through the duat (Egyptian underworld)’.

The vase of Warka
picture 23
This is the alabaster Warka Vase from Uruk, Early Sumerian, third quarter of fourth millennium BCE. It is carved in low relief and it is dedicated to Inanna.
Picture 24
This is a drawing of the carvings. There are three registers and we will examine them one by one.



In the register on top a carpet of wool or a cloth of flax and bread are offered to Inanna.
In this scene Inanna is depicted three times: two times as a little girl standing on a goat and one time as a Grant Lady. Her emblem is depicted three times too, demonstrating that she is ‘united’ with the sun and the moon in April, May and June.
And here a carpet of wool or a cloth of flax may offered by Utu and Nanna to Inanna similar to what we read in ‘A balbale to Inanna (A):’
1-11. ‘The brother speaks gently to his sister, Utu speaks gently to his sister, he speaks tenderly to holy Inanna: ‘Young lady, the flax in the garden beds is full of loveliness, Inanna, the flax in the garden beds is full of loveliness, like the barley in the furrows, overflowing with loveliness and delight. Sister, you took a fancy to a grand length of linen; Inanna, you took a fancy to a grand length of linen. I will dig up the plants for you and give them to you. Young lady, I will bring you flax from the garden beds. Inanna, I will bring you flax from the garden beds.’ 12-14. ‘ Brother, when you have brought me flax from the garden beds, who will ret it for me? Who will ret it for me? Who will ret that flax for me?’ 15-16. ‘My sister, I will bring it to you already retted! Inanna, I will bring it to you already retted!’ 17-19. ‘ Brother, when you have brought it to me already retted, who will spin it for me? Who will spin it for me? Who will spin that flax for me?’ 20-21. ‘My sister, I will bring it to you already spun! Inanna, I will bring it to you already spun!’ 22-24. ‘Brother, when you have brought it to me already spun, who will twine it for me? Who will twine it for me? Who will twine that flax for me?’ 25-26. ‘My sister, I will bring it to you already twined! Inanna, I will bring it to you already twined!’ 27-29. ‘Brother, when you have brought it to me already twined, who will warp it for me? Who will warp it for me? Who will warp that flax for me?’



30-31. ‘My sister, I will bring it to you already warped! Inanna, I will bring it to you already warped!’ 32-34. ‘Brother, when you have brought it to me already warped, who will weave for me? Who will weave for me? Who will weave that flax for me?’ 35-36. ‘My sister, I will bring it to you already woven! Inanna, I will bring it to you already woven!’ 37-39. ‘Brother, when you have brought it to me already woven, who will bleach it for me? Who will bleach it for me? Who will bleach that linen for me?’ 40-41. ‘My sister, I will bring it to you already bleached! Inanna, I will bring it to you already bleached!’ 42-44. ‘Brother, when you have brought it to me already bleached, who will lie down on it with me? Who will lie down on it with me? Who will lie down on that linen with me?’ 45-50. ‘There shall lie down with you, there shall lie down with you, there shall lie down with you your bridegroom! Ama-ušumgal-ana shall lie down with you, the companion of Enlil shall lie down with you, the issue of a noble womb shall lie down with you, the offspring of a ruler shall lie down with you.’ 51-56. ‘Is it true?-- He is the man of my heart! He is the man of my heart! Brother, he is the man who has spoken to my heart! He does no hoeing, yet heaps up piles of grain; he delivers grain regularly to the storehouse, a farmer who has numerous piles of grain a shepherd whose sheep are heavy (?) with wool’. 57. A balbale of Inanna.’
In this scene a king may have offered bread to Inanna like Išme-Dagan did:
‘One of her ushers brought the gifts. The fowler brought choice birds, and the fisherman brought fat carp and put them ...... my lady. The shepherd carried butter in his hands, Dumuzid carried milk on his shoulders. He carried butter and milk in containers on his shoulders, he carried milk in the churn on his shoulders. ...... called out to the house; Dumuzid ......: ‘Open the house, my lady! Open the house!’
Name poem: A love song of Išme-Dagan (Išme-Dagan J)
The king makes the offerings first and after that Inanna will embrace him and allow him to sit next to her as we read in: ‘A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan (A)’.
‘Pour libations, to carry out purification rites, to heap up incense offerings, to burn juniper, to set out food offerings, to set out offering-bowls, he goes into her Egal-maḫ. She embraces her beloved spouse, holy Inanna embraces him. She shines like daylight on the great throne dais and makes the king position himself next (?) to her like the sun’.



Here the black-headed people may sacrifice bread, meat and butter for Inanna, more or less similar to what we read in: ‘A šir-namursaĝa to Ninsiana for Iddin-Dagan (Iddin-Dagan A):’
‘Everybody hastens to holy Inanna. For my lady in the midst of heaven the best of everything is prepared (?). In the pure places of the plain, at its good places, on the roofs, on the rooftops, the rooftops of the dwellings (?), in the sanctuaries (?) of mankind, incense offerings like a forest of
aromatic cedars are transmitted to her. They sacrifice alum sheep, long-haired sheep, and fattened sheep for her. They purify the earth for the Mistress, they carry out purification rites for her’.
The king offers and is the lover of Inanna in order to be the shepherd of the black-headed inhabitants; farmer who makes the fields productive; who makes the sheepfolds multiply, like a trustworthy shepherd. ‘Under him, may there be flax, may there be barley,’ as we read in ‘A song of Inanna and Dumuzid (D1)’:
47-59 ‘May he act as shepherd of the black-headed inhabitants; may he, like a farmer, make the fields productive; may he make the sheepfolds multiply, like a trustworthy shepherd. Under him, may there be flax, may there be barley; in the rivers may there be carp floods. Under him, may there be mottled barley in the fields; in the marshes, fish, and may the birds chatter. Under him, may the old reeds and the young reeds grow tall in the reedbeds; under him, may the mašgurum bushes flourish on the high plains. Under him, may the wild sheep and wild goats multiply in the forests; under him, may the irrigated orchards produce syrup and wine. Under him, may lettuce and cress flourish in the garden plots; under him, may there be long life in the palace.’
60-64 ‘May high flood-waters flow in the Tigris and Euphrates, may the grasses grow tall on their banks, and may the meadows be covered. May the holy lady Nisaba pile high the grain heaps and mounds. My lady, queen of heaven and earth, queen who encompasses heaven and earth, may he enjoy long days ...... embrace.’

Objekt: Rollsiegel, Marmor, 38,5 x 32,2 mm. Datierung: Protoliterate c (3200-3000) bzw. eventuell Uruk III (3200-3000). Herkunft: Diyālāgebiet, Fundkontext unbekannt. Sammlung: Fribourg, Sammlungen BIBEL+ORIENT, VR 1981.3. Darstellung: Je zwei übereinander angeordnete Vierbeiner (Schafe) flankieren eine Tempelfassade; Schilfringbündel als Trenner. Diskussion: Zum Vergleich des Horizontalfrieses mit Zickzackmuster über dem Tempelportal mit dem Schmuck auf zeitgenössischer Monumentalarchitektur s. Brandes 1979: 221 Anm. 2. Zum Schilfringbündel als Symbol der Göttin Innin akkad. Inanna s. Seidl 1957-71: 490 [ergänzter Text von Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 17: Die Kombination von Tempelfassade und Herde ist typisch für das DijalaGebiet. Das Schilfringbündel, das als Trenner figuriert, ist das Symbol der großen sumerischen Göttin Inanna, der akkadischen Ischtar. Die Darstellung dürfte eines ihrer Heiligtümer zeigen. Inanna bzw. Ischtar ist eine Göttin mit vielen Aspekten, vor allem der sexuell bestimmten Liebe, des Krieges und der damit zu gewinnenden Macht und des Morgen- und Abendsterns (Black/Green 1992: 108f). Durch die Übernahme der Rollen anderer Gottheiten, etwa der alter Muttergottheiten in der Sintflutgeschichte, wie sie in Taf. 11 des Gilgamesch-Epos erzählt wird, wachsen ihr auch Funktionen zu, die ihr von Haus aus fremd sind, so in diesem Falle die Rolle der Muttergöttin, die um die Vernichtung «ihrer Menschen, die sie geboren hat», klagt (XI,120-122). Die Anwesenheit des Göttlichen bzw. das Göttliche selbst wurde häufig durch nicht menschengestaltige Zeichen signalisiert, so in Ägypten etwa durch eine kleine Fahne (nṯr, sprich netscher) oder – besonders in der Levante – durch eine aufgestellte Steinplatte (mazzebah). Die genannten Symbole konnten verschiedene, sowohl weibliche wie männliche Gottheiten signalisieren oder symbolisieren. Andere waren einer bestimmten Gottheit vorbehalten, so z. B. das Schilfringbündel in Mesopotamien der Göttin Inanna, der «Herrin des Himmels» (nin.an.ak) bzw. der «Herrin der Datteltrauben» (nin.ana.ak). Die beiden Schilfringbündel auf dem obersten Register des berühmten Steingefässes von Uruk (Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 17a) symbolisieren den Eingang zum Heiligtum. Ob die menschliche Gestalt links davon, die den Gabenbringerzug empfängt, die Oberpriesterin oder die Göttin selbst in menschlicher Gestalt darstellt, ist unsicher. Sicher ist, dass Gottheiten keineswegs immer durch menschliche Gestalten dargestellt wurden. Nicht-anthropomorphe Zeichen oder extrem schematisierte menschliche Figuren (Keel/Schroer 2004: Nr. 10, 18-20) wurden oft als geeigneter empfunden, die geheimnisvolle Anwesenheit göttlicher Mächte zu symbolisieren].

Picture 23 Warka Vase, alabaster, Uruk, Early Sumerian, third quarter of fourth millenium BCE. From the Uruk - Southern Mesopotamian Period, 4000 BCE - 3100 BCE Found in Uruk (Warka) The Warka vase was one of a pair found in the temple treasury at Uruk. The carved limestone vase depicts, in four registers, the food chain or four stages of life. In the first register, at the bottom, are found plants; animals in the second; humans carrying offerings of food in the third register; and at the very top a royal figure (denoted by his net skirt) stands before the goddess Inanna who receives the bounties of the earth. These two details show a servant holding the belt of the king or royal figure; while below are shown the contents of Inanna's treasure house, full of offerings.
