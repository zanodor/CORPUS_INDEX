RUSSIA, CRADLE OF THE GAEL
JOHN CAREY
0. Introduction
One of the points of overlap between Celts and Slavs is a matter of
geography, although it is the geography of the imagination, not that of
conventional history: certain of the Celtic peoples claimed to have originated
in a region where certain of the Slavic peoples subsequently settled. This
is the territory known as Scythia: a term which was used by many ancient
writers as a general designation for the northernmost parts of the world,
but which was more specifically applied to the lands north and northeast
of the Black Sea, including what are now Russia and the Ukraine.
1. Medieval pseudohistorical tradition and Scythia
Although the notion of derivation from Scythia is, as we shall see, one of
the constants of Gaelic pseudohistorical tradition, it appears to have played
a relatively peripheral part in shaping Irish and Scottish conceptions of
identity. The doctrine that the Gaels invaded Ireland from Spain probably
arose as a result of cultural contacts between Ireland and Iberia in the seventh
century; it went on to serve the interests of propaganda in the attempts to
forge an Irish-Spanish alliance against England a thousand years later, and
is not without its adherents even today.1 The belief that they had also come
into contact with the Israelites, upon whose wanderings their own were
largely modelled, enabled the Irish to claim that their pagan ancestors had
had some knowledge of the Mosaic Law.2 An alternative view that the Gaels
were originally Greeks, often attested despite being at odds with the normative
pseudohistorical model canonised in Lebor Gabála, also had an obvious
motivation in that it linked Irish origins with the high culture of the ancient
world.3 But what was to be gained from an association with the Scythians?
On the face of it, such references to Scythia as would have been
available to a medieval Irish scholar would not have suggested that such

an association was a flattering one. Thus a reader of Orosius’s Seven Books
of History Against the Pagans would learn that Ninus taught the ancient
Scythians to drink human blood; that the heinousness of an atrocity could
best be evoked by saying that it would have been “loathsome... even to the
remotest barbarians of Scythia”; that “the vast Scythian peoples” were “feared
by all [our] ancestors, and even by Alexander the Great” ; and that the
barbarian leader Radagaisus was “truly a Scythian, who in his ravenous
cruelty loved not so much fame, or plunder, as carnage for the sake of
carnage”.4
For Isidore of Seville, Scythia was one of the remote refuges of the
monstrous races, home to the Panotii with their enormous ears, and to the
horse-footed Hippopods; “the land as a whole, on account of the barbarous
peoples by whom it is inhabited, is called Barbarica”.5 Elsewhere, Isidore
spoke of Scythia as containing
many peoples, who wander far and wide on account of the barrenness of the land. Some of them till the fields while others, monstrous and savage, subsist on human flesh and blood. Many regions in Scythia are prosperous, but many others are uninhabitable: for while they are, in many places, abundant in gold and gems, men can seldom come there because of the ferocity of the gryphons.6
In such an account, it is the exotic and gruesome which stick in the
mind: it is not surprising that Airbertach Mac Coise’s geographical poem,
based extensively on Isidore, says of Scythia only that it contains “gryphons
of valleys, guarding gold and pure gems”.7
The Irish were also accused of barbarism, and indeed of cannibalism, by
ancient writers.8 But such potential resemblances with the Scythians would
only be made the basis of comparison by hostile outsiders: it is difficult to
imagine that an Irish scholar would have claimed an ancestral connection
simply because of the Scythians’ reputation for savagery.9 Considerably

more plausible is the hypothesis that the derivation from Scythia originated
as etymological conjecture, a type of speculation which the Irish - like many
other medieval peoples - assiduously cultivated.10 A plausible scenario
was sketched by Eoin Mac Neill:
To provide a theory of the origin of the Gaels..., a search was made through the Latin historical and geographical writings that were used in the Christian schools of Ireland and suitable discoveries were made.... In those times, the ordinary Latin name for the people of Ireland was Scotti, Scots. It is the name used for them by Orosius, and also by St. Patrick, and it was accepted by all the early Irish writers who wrote in Latin. But this name Scotti does not appear in Latin before the fourth century and gave no direct clue to trace the origin of the Gaels. In the historical and geographical Latin writings to hand, the people’s name that most clearly resembled Scotti was Scythi, Scythians. Accordingly, we are told that the Gaelic people were of Scythian origin.11
This analysis has often been echoed since;12 and indeed I believe it to
be correct. It should however be noted that Mac Neill cites no medieval
text in its support. So far as I have been able to ascertain, the earliest Irish
source to explain the word Scot as coming from “Scythian” is Geoffrey
Keating’s Foras Feasa ar Éirinn, written in the 1630s. Dismissing the
view of “a certain author” that Scot is a synonym for saighdeóir ‘archer’,13
Keating stated that “it is the general opinion of the historians” (céadfaidh
choithchenn na seanchadh) that the reason why the descendants of Goídel
are called “the race of Scot” (cine Scuit) is “because of their having come
from Scythia, with respect to their origin”.14
“The general opinion of the historians” is rather a vague reference,
especially as Keating liked to invoke specific authorities wherever possible;
and our confidence that such a doctrine was in fact widespread among the
learned men of Ireland is not increased when John Colgan, making the
same assertion, seems merely to be echoing Keating.15 Prior to Keating, in
10 Thus Baumgarten 1983; Russell 1988: 16-27. 11 Mac Neill 1919: 90-91. Cf. Meyer 1913: p. 26; van Hamel 1914-15: 173. 12 E.g. by Macalister 1938-56: ii, 3; Baumgarten 1983: 226-7; Scowcroft 1988: 17; Carey 1994: 12.
13 That the word is to be taken in this its original sense, not more generally as “soldier” in accordance with later usage, is evident from the equivalent fear bogha “bowman” in the next sentence. The unnamed “author” presumably associated Scot with some form of the word “shoot” (Old English scéotan). 14 Comyn & Dinneen 1902-14: ii, 26.

russia, cradle of the gael
fact, explicit mentions of the Scot/Scyth equivalence are confined entirely
to English writers. Thus Edmund Spenser, in his View of the State of Ireland
(1595), wrote of how
the Scythians... at such time as the Northerne Nations overflowed all Christendome, came downe to the sea-coast, where inquiring for other countries abroad, and getting intelligence of this countrey of Ireland, finding shipping convenient, passed thither, and arrived in the North-part thereof, which is now called Ulster, which first inhabiting, and afterwards stretching themselves forth into the land, as their numbers increased, named it all of themselves Scuttenland, which more briefly is called Scutland, or Scotland.16
In England, the derivation goes back at least as far as the writings of
Ralph de Diceto (second half of the twelfth century),17 resurfacing in Ranulf
Higden’s Polychronicon (mid-fourteenth century),18 and then appearing
again a hundred years later in Thomas Walsingham’s Ypodigma Neustriae.19
Since Keating cites Walsingham earlier in the very chapter in which he
speaks of “the general opinion of the historians”, there would appear to be
some grounds for the suspicion that it was the monk of Saint Albans whom
he has swathed in the collective mantle of the seanchaidhe.
2. The question of Scythian etymology
There is one medieval Irish text which comes close to asserting the
Scythian etymology: the Third Recension of the influential pseudohistorical
treatise Lebor Gabála. Here we find for the most part a recapitulation of
ideas from the earlier recensions, some of which will be further discussed
below; but then there is something extra.
...Or else Scota is the name of the kingdom (túath) from which they came to Nimrod’s tower, out of Stony Scythia (ota in Sceithia Clochaig) in the east.... The kingdom (túath) from which they came was Scoititsianos.20
Have we finally found a medieval Irish witness to the Scythian etymology?
In fact, no. The passage is not saying that the Scots derived their name
from Scythia; rather, they are supposed to have come from a place some

18 Babington and Lumby 1865-86: i, 382-3. At ibid., 388, Higden provides the most ingenious explanation which I have yet encountered of St Andrew’s status as patron saint of Scotland, linking it with the apocryphal doctrine that Andrew preached among the Scythians. 19 Riley 1876: 107-8. 20 Book of Lecan, fol. 268 rb 48-va 3.

where within the borders of Scythia called Scota or Scoititsianos. The very
fact that such a fantastic name as the latter should have been added to the
story seems to indicate that the man responsible for the addition saw no
significant connection between the name Scot and that of Scythia itself.
Should all of this lead us to conclude that the standard explanation for
the Scythian ancestry of the Gaels is a purely English invention? The
question deserves to be squarely put, but in the end I am inclined to answer
it in the negative. The resemblance between the names Scoti and Scythae
seems, after all, too close to be coincidental; and I have argued elsewhere
that the derivation of the former from the latter could have been modelled
on a passage in Isidore, who used a closely analogous similarity of name
as a pretext for tracing the Gothi of Spain from the Getae on the Scythian
frontier.21 The principal question which confronts us is, rather, why the
Scythian etymology is not mentioned in any medieval Irish source.
The simplest answer is that it had been displaced by another explanation,
which derived the name Scot from that of the ancestress Scota daughter of
Pharaoh. This Scota was an important figure in the overall pseudohistorical
scheme, serving to anchor the Gaels in Egypt at the time of the Exodus:
her status as eponym of the Scotti is already mentioned in two ninth-century
manuscripts on the Continent,22 and is repeatedly asserted in Irish sources
throughout the Middle Ages. Eventually there came to be two Scotas, each
the daughter of a Pharaoh: one was the wife of Nél, son of the ruler of
Scythia; the other was one of the wives of Míl Espáine, patriarch of the
Gaelic conquerors of Ireland. With so conspicuous a figure to account for
the name, any alternative etymology would have been superfluous and might
even have cast doubt on the reality of Scota herself: thus Keating was at
pains to explain that Scota was so called “because the father of [her son]
Goídel was of the race of Scot (cine Scuit), from Scythia, and it was customary
among them for women to take their names from their husbands”.23 This
is by no means the only example of a pseudohistorical doctrine whose
etymological basis appears to have been forgotten within the tradition
21 Carey 1994: 12-13. After writing this, I was both startled and gratified to find that Ralph de Diceto had anticipated me by some eight centuries: A regione quadam quae dicitur Scitia,
dicitur Scita, Sciticus, Scoticus, Scotus, Scotia. Similiter a regione quadam quae dicitur Getia, dicitur Geta, Geticus, Goticus, Gotus, Ostrogotus, Witsigotus (Stubbs 1876: ii, 36). 22 Thus Contreni 1992.
23 Comyn & Dinneen 1902-14: ii, 20. He makes a similar statement regarding the second Scota, ibid., 44.

itself - although, as can be seen in the case of Higden and others, it remained
easy enough to recognise and rediscover it.24
Whatever its rationale, the Scythian origin of the Gaels is already to be
found in the oldest systematic account of Irish origins to have come down
to us, that which the Welsh author of the treatise Historia Brittonum, writing
in 829 or 830, claims to have received from the “most learned of the Irish”:
When the sons of Israel came through the Red Sea, the Egyptians came and followed them and were drowned, as is read in the Law. There was a noble man from Scythia, with a large family, dwelling with the Egyptians, who had been expelled from his own realm. And he was there when the Egyptians were drowned, and he did not set out to pursue the people of God. But those who had survived took counsel to drive him out, lest he should assail and occupy their realm, since the strong among them had been drowned in the Red Sea; and so he was driven out.
The route which the noble Scythian took through northern Africa to
Spain is then described; his descendants lived there for many centuries,
and eventually conquered Ireland.25 Here, as will be evident, the real purpose
of the story is to link Egypt with Spain: the ancestor-figure’s Scythian
origins are mentioned only in passing, and contribute nothing to our sense
of his identity or of that of his descendants.
It is otherwise with our next piece of evidence: the poem “Can a
mbunadas na nGoídel” [“Whence is the origin of the Gaels?”], plausibly
ascribed to Mael Muru Othna, a “royal poet” whose death is assigned by
the annals to the year 887.26 Retelling the story - already to be found in the
grammatical tract Auraicept na nÉces, as part of its first (eighth-century?)
stratum - of how one Fénius constructed the Irish language in the aftermath
of the building of the tower of Babel,27 Mael Muru adds the information
that Fénius journeyed to the tower “from Scythia”. He goes on to relate
how Fénius’s son Nél went to Egypt and married Pharaoh’s daughter
Scota; their descendants lived peacefully in Egypt until, as in Historia
24 Some eponyms were probably already opaque in the pre-Christian period: for the case of Íth see Koch 1991: 22-3. The name of Éremón son of Mil, although clearly contrived to be an eponym (cf. Scowcroft 1988: 19-20), is not so far as I know ever acknowledged as such in the sources. 25 Cited from Mommsen 1894-98: 156-8. 26 See Carey 2004. 27 For the background of this legend, see Carey 1990b.



155

Brittonum, their position became untenable following the flight of the
Israelites. At this point, Mael Muru’s account takes a different tack:28
The offspring of Nél feared Pharaoh’s anger, so that they were sorrowful; for they had not gone to take revenge along with the warrior.
Even when Pharaoh did not escape from the travelled (?) sea, they feared that the peoples of Egypt would enslave them.
They stole Pharaoh’s ships from the land where they dwelt. On a cold night they rowed upon the strait of the Red Sea.
They rowed past India, past Asia (so that you may know it), to Scythia, with lofty strength, to their own country.
They held sway over the channel of the Caspian Sea, a trusty war-band. They left Glas in Coronis, upon the Libyan Sea.
After a time Srú son of Esrú departed from Scythia on a difficult circuit, swiftly, around the north of the Rhipaean mountains.
He settled in Golgatha of the river-mouths, a shining covenant. His offspring remained there without reproach for two hundred years.
Brath son of Deáith journeyed thither, kingly ranks, into the Maeotic marsh (?) from the north, in the north of the world.
Therefore he went along the marshes with (their) islands, kingly exiles: to reach the crested Tyrrhenian Sea.
They rowed to Crete, to Sicily, chieftains upon an errand, past the Pillars of mighty Hercules to wealthy Spain.
Where Historia Brittonum brought the noble Scythian from Egypt to
Spain by the most direct route possible, across a northern Africa whose
landmarks are all drawn from the account of world geography at the beginning
of Orosius’s History,29 Mael Muru prolonged the migration by hundreds
of years and took the wanderers the long way round, by way of a protracted
sojourn in “their own country”, Scythia. Scythia has become an integral
part of the story: it is the homeland yearned for by the uprooted Gaels.
The geography, apart from certain baffling details (why is the Libyan
Sea near the Caspian Sea? what is Golgatha?), is again taken from Orosius.
From him, Mael Muru or his source would have learned that the Caspian
Sea opens onto the northern ocean, explaining how it was possible for the
28 In what follows I cite my own translation of the poem, from a critical edition which is still in progress. The only prior edition is Todd 1848: 220-71; cf. Best et al. 1954-83: lines 15990-6158. 29 Libri septem i.2 (Migne 1844-64: xxxi, 691-4).

Gaels to reach it by sailing “past India, past Asia”, and then around the
Asian landmass northwestward. Orosius went on to describe how the
Maeotic marshes (the ancient name for the Sea of Azov, north of the Black
Sea) can be reached by following the shore of the ocean further westward;
and he spoke too of the Rhipaean mountains in the farthest North, the
source of the Tanais (or Don) which flowed into the Maeotic marshes as
well as the Black Sea. The journeys of the Gaels, however difficult they
may be for us to visualise at first, make sense in Orosian terms.30
But why, having found their way home again to Scythia, did the Gaels
then wander further? This question is addressed in the poem “Goídel Glas,
ó tát Goídil” [“Goídel Glas, from whom are the Gaels”], written by Gilla
Coemáin mac Gilla Shamthainne (flourished 1072). The relationship of
this poem to the earliest version of Lebor Gabála is not altogether straight
forward;31 they cannot in any case have been very far apart in date. In
terms of doctrine, Gilla Coemáin seems to stand between Mael Muru and
Lebor Gabála, broadly conforming with what the latter has to tell us but
preserving a few scraps of information characteristic of the former. For most
purposes, citing the First Recension of Lebor Gabála gives a convenient
summary of his views as well. Again, it is Srú who leads the Gaels out of
Egypt and back to Scythia; but Scythia is not empty when they get there:
At that time Noenual descendant of Fénius died, i.e. the ruler of Scythia; and immediately after coming to Scythia Srú died also.
Éber Scot [son of Srú] took the kingship of Scythia by force from the children of Noenual, until he was killed by Noenual’s son Noenius.
There was strife between Noenius and Boamain son of Éber Scot. Boamain took the kingship until he was killed by Noenius.
Noenius took the sovereignty until he was killed by Ogamain son of Boamain, in vengeance for his father.
Ogamain took the kingship until he died.
Refill son of Noenius took the kingship until he was killed by Tait son of Ogamain.
Thereafter Tait fell by the hand of Reflóir son of Refill. There was strife concerning the sovereignty then, between Reflóir son of Noenius [sic] and Agnoman son of Tait, until Refloir was killed by Agnoman.
30 Orosius, Libri septem i.2 (Migne 1844-64: xxxi, 685); cf. Scowcroft 1988: 17-18. 31 For what is perhaps a too simplistic view, see Carey 1994: 22; cf. Scowcroft 1988: 4-5.



157
john carey
That is why the descendants of Goídel, i.e. Agnoman and his son Lámfhind, were driven into exile upon the sea, so that for seven years they were voyaging around the world to the north. They suffered more hardships than can be counted.
Their wanderings take the Gaels across the Caspian Sea and past the
Rhipaean Mountains to the Maeotic marshes, where they settle; after seven
generations there they migrate again, crossing the Mediterranean to Spain.
This account fills in the gap which Mael Muru had left, telling of a feud
extending over four or five generations between two rival lineages claiming
the rulership of Scythia. The background of these two lineages is spelled
out earlier in the text, where we are told of the expedition of Fénius Farsaid
to the tower of Babel:
Fénius had two sons. One was Noenual, whom Fénius left behind as lord of Scythia. The other, Nél, was born at the Tower; and he was a master of the many languages. That is why Pharaoh sent for him, so that he might learn the many languages from him. But Fénius returned from Asia to Scythia, from which he had gone for the building of the Tower; and forty years thereafter he died as lord of Scythia, and gave the lordship to his son Noenual.
The two lines are therefore descended from the two sons of Fénius, Nél
and Noenual: in their protracted struggle, the kingship of Scythia passes
back and forth between them.
3. The Scythian adventures of the Gaels and the scheme of
alternating kingship
There is an obvious analogy here to the tradition whereby the kingship of
Ireland alternated between two related dynasties. In the pre-Norman period,
this pattern was actually put into practice: from the time of Aed Allán in the
eighth century to that of Mael Sechnaill II in the eleventh, with only a single
disruption in the person of Congalach Cnogba, the high-kingship passed
back and forth between two branches of Uí Néill - Cenél nEógain in the
north and Clann Cholmáin in the midlands.32 The same pattern was projected
back into the legendary history of the centuries before Patrick, with the
kingship here alternating for the most part between the northern and southern
halves of the island, the ancestors therefore of Uí Néill and Eóganachta
respectively. In this artificial antiquity, as in the equally fabulous Scythian
32 The most recent discussion is Warntjes 2003-4.



158
russia, cradle of the gael
past, each king is portrayed as killing his predecessor, and being killed by
his successor.
More than analogy is at work in this resemblance between the fortunes
of the descendants of Fénius and the standard model of the trajectory of
Irish kingship: the primeval Gaels and their Scythian cousins appear
actually to be derived from the medieval Uí Néill. It was long ago suggested
that the name Nél is a form - perhaps in fact the oldest form, perhaps an
archaising back-formation - of Niall, the name of the king and patriarch
looked back upon as the ancestor of all of the Uí Néill dynasties.33 But
what of Noenual? I find it tempting to see this name as a version of Niall’s
epithet Noígiallach or Noí nGiall ‘of the Nine Hostages’. Noen- is certainly
close to noí ‘nine’, a numeral followed by the nasal mutation; and -ual as
an archaic or archaising counterpart of the suffix -al(l) (Bresual for Bresal,
Conual for Conall) was well known from early praise poetry.34 It is not at
all far from Niall Noí nGiall to Nél and Noenual.
If I am correct in this analysis, then the Scythian adventures of the
Gaels were deliberately constructed as a type, to be fulfilled in the antitype
of Irish history. The polarisation and rivalry which were intrinsic to the
scheme of alternating kingship are here symbolised, with vivid audacity,
by splitting the apical ancestor of the Uí Néill into two brothers. There is
something of Jacob and Esau about them: the clever one making his fortune
by marriage far away, while the other is intended by his father to succeed
him. But this last analogy is not one which I would wish to press too far.
What we can say is that some historian, writing probably in the tenth or the
early eleventh century, came up with the inspired notion of using Scythia
not just as a source which the Irish could use to explain their origins, but
as an exotic mirror in which they could see themselves foreshadowed.
For the medieval writers whom I have been discussing, Scythia was
little more than a blank screen on which to project their own concerns. The
name was of course important for the sake of the original etymology, and
a few scraps of geography could be used to make the story more vivid and
more plausible, but the pseudohistorians preferred to ignore the less
complimentary details regarding Scythia and the Scythians which it would
have been easy enough for them to find in the pages of Orosius and Isidore.

159
john carey
I know of only one Irish writer who attempted to arouse in his readers
a sense of pride in their Scythian heritage as such: again, this was Geoffrey
Keating.
...From Scythia too, of the race of Magog by origin, was Zeliorbes king of the Huns, who was at war with the emperor Justinian. And from Scythia came the Lombards, the Hungarians and all the Goths... From Scythia, moreover, came the Turks. What shall I say? Buchanan, a pursuer of the antiquity of the diffusion of the races of the world, cites Epiphanius to the effect that the people of Scythia took the supreme rule of the world directly after the Flood, and that their sovereignty lasted until the empire of Babylon. The same authors say that it is from Scythia that the other regions used to obtain laws and duties and ordinances; and also that they were the first race that began to be held in honour after the Flood.
Keating goes on to cite various authors, ancient and modern, as witnesses
to the great courage of the Scythians, and to their resistance to foreign
domination. Thus he quotes the historian Justin as saying that
They drove Darius king of Persia out of Scythia in disgrace; they killed Cyrus, with all his army; they annihilated Zophyron, leader of the army of Alexander the Great, together with his host; they heard of the power of the Romans, and they never felt it.35
It is not hard to see why Keating was prepared to turn a blind eye to the
savagery for which the Scythians were so notorious,36 and to celebrate their
ferocious defense of their own independence. Again, the present was shaping
the imagined past: if the Scythians were primordial Gaels, then one could
hope that the overwhelming might of England might eventually succumb to
the same fate which had overwhelmed the forces of Darius and Alexander.
But this of course was not to be.
4. Conlusion: seventeenth century Ireland and the Scythian origins
of the Gaels
Even so, curiosity concerning the Scythian origins of the Gaels continued
to bear various fruits as the seventeenth century advanced. Thus Roderick
O’Flaherty, writing in 1685, drew upon his extensive learning to find
traces of the Scythian ancestry of the Irish where none had been discerned
35 Comyn & Dinneen 1902-14: i, 226-8.
36 This is not to say that he was indifferent to testimonies to a more civilised side of the Scythians. Thus he approvingly cites the assertion of Polydore Virgil, in the latter’s De inuentoribus rerum (1499), that the Scythians were a more ancient race than the Egyptians, and had been their teachers (Comyn & Dinneen 1902-14: ii, 12).



160

before. He was able to point to passages in the Punica of Silius Italicus which
seemed to assert that the Scythian tribes of the Sarmatians and Massagetae
had once lived in Spain, supposedly the home of the Scythian exiles who
went on to people Ireland;37 and he found a copy of Gildas’s De excidio
Britanniae which spoke of piratical Scots and Picts attacking Britain not
“across the valley of Tethys” (trans Tithicam uallem) — the mannered
kenning for the sea which Gildas had actually used — but “across the
Scythian valley” (trans Scythicam uallem) — implying that the Scythian
origins of these peoples were reflected in one of the names for the Irish
Sea.38
A Scythian parallel more in keeping with the melancholy realities of
the Irish situation in the seventeenth century is adumbrated by Keating at
the end of the same chapter from which I have just quoted. In a passage
whose logic eludes me, but whose personal relevance it is easy enough to
recognise, Keating proposes that the Scots were so called precisely because
they did not have sovereignty in their ancestral homeland.
I take it that that is why the name of Scots is given specifically to the race of Goídel son of Nél son of Fénius Farsaid, to whom the supreme rule of Scythia came, and to his descendants after him. And Nél was the second son of Fénius, and got no share of territory at all, as the kin of Fénius had received territories from which they themselves and their descendants took their names. Therefore Nél ordained that his own race should take their name from Scythia, and call themselves Scots forever, for there was no land at all in their possession; and his father had left him no property save for the privilege of the arts and of the many languages...39
It is not a bad description of the position in which Irish men of learning
found themselves, after the flight of their patrons - their return, the
pseudohistorians would have said - to Spain. Once again, in the twilight of
the old order, the Scythians were a mirror in which the Irish saw themselves
reflected.
